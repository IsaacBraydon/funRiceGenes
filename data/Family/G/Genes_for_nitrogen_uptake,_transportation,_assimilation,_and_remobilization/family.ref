Nitrogen (N) as a macronutrient is an important determinant of plant growth. The excessive usage of chemical fertilizers is increasing environmental pollution; hence, the improvement of crop&#39;s nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is imperative for sustainable agriculture. N uptake, transportation, assimilation, and remobilization are four important determinants of plant NUE. Oryza sativa L. (rice) is a staple food for approximately half of the human population, around the globe and improvement in rice yield is pivotal for rice breeders. The N transporters, enzymes indulged in N assimilation, and several transcription factors affect the rice NUE and subsequent yield. Although, a couple of improvements have been made regarding rice NUE, the knowledge about regulatory mechanisms operating NUE is scarce. The current review provides a precise knowledge of how rice plants detect soil N and how this detection is translated into the language of responses that regulate the growth. Additionally, the transcription factors that control N-associated genes in rice are discussed in detail. This mechanistic insight will help the researchers to improve rice yield with minimized use of chemical fertilizers.
