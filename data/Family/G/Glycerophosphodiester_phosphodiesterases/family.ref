Rice and chickpea GDPD s are transcriptionally influenced by mineral deficiencies; especially, by phosphate starvation and CaGDP1 encodes an active glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase enzyme. Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (GDPDs) are enzymes involved in the degradation of glycerophosphodiesters into sn-glycerol-3-phosphate and corresponding alcohols. These phospholipid remodeling genes have been suggested to play important roles in phosphate homeostasis. However, comprehensive information about the role of GDPDs under low phosphate (P) and other nutrient deficiencies (N, K, Fe, Zn) in rice and chickpea is missing. Here, we identified 13 OsGDPDs and 6 CaGDPDs in rice and chickpea, respectively, and partly characterized their roles in multiple nutrient stresses. Expression profiling after 7 and 15Â days of deficiency treatments revealed unique and overlapping differential expression patterns of OsGDPDs and CaGDPDs under different nutrient stresses. Principal component analysis on the expression patterns of OsGDPDs and CaGDPDs revealed their preferential role in P starvation. Some of the GDPDs were also induced by N, K, Fe and Zn deficiency in temporal manner in both crops suggesting their roles in multiple nutrient stresses. Biochemical characterization of highly responsive chickpea GDPD, CaGDPD1, confirmed its in vitro GDPD activity and revealed its optimal temperature, pH and cofactor requirements. Further, CaGDPD1 showed its accumulation in ER and endomembranes. We hereby propose CaGDPD1 and various OsGDPDs as low P responsive marker genes in chickpea and rice, respectively. Our data uphold role of GDPDs in multinutrient responses and suggest them as candidates for rice and chickpea improvement for tolerance to various nutrient deficiencies.
