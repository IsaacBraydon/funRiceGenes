Theor. Appl. Genet.	Fine mapping of the qCTS12 locus, a major QTL for seedling cold tolerance in rice.	2006	Crops Pathology and Genetics Research Unit, Department of Plant Sciences, USDA-ARS, Davis, CA 95616, USA.	The temperate japonica rice cultivar M202 is the predominant variety grown in California due to its tolerance to low temperature stress, good grain quality and high yield. Earlier analysis of a recombinant inbred line mapping population derived from a cross between M202 and IR50, an indica cultivar that is highly sensitive to cold stress, resulted in the identification of a number of QTL conferring tolerance to cold-induced wilting and necrosis. A major QTL, qCTS12, located on the short arm of chromosome 12, contributes over 40% of the phenotypic variance. To identify the gene(s) underlying qCTS12, we have undertaken the fine mapping of this locus. Saturating the short arm of chromosome 12 with microsatellite markers revealed that qCTS12 is closest to RM7003. Using RM5746 and RM3103, which are immediately outside of RM7003, we screened 1,954 F(5)-F(10) lines to find recombinants in the qCTS12 region. Additional microsatellite markers were identified from publicly available genomic sequence and used to fine map qCTS12 to a region of approximately 87 kb located on the BAC clone OSJNBb0071I17. This region contains ten open reading frames (ORFs) consisting of five hypothetical and expressed proteins of unknown function, a transposon protein, a putative NBS-LRR disease resistance protein, two zeta class glutathione S-transferases (OsGSTZ1 and OsGSTZ2), and a DAHP synthetase. Further fine mapping with markers developed from the ORFs delimited the QTL to a region of about 55 kb. The most likely candidates for the gene(s) underlying qCTS12 are OsGSTZ1 and OsGSTZ2.
Molecular Genetics & Genomics (Molecular General Genetics up to 2001)	Organisation and structural evolution of the rice glutathione S-transferase gene family.	2004	Department of Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Milan, Via Celoria 26, 20133, Milano, Italy.	Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) comprise a large family of key defence enzymes against xenobiotic toxicity. Here we describe the comprehensive characterisation of this important multigene family in the model monocot species rice [ Oryza sativa(L.)]. Furthermore, we investigate the molecular evolution of the family based on the analysis of (1) the patterns of within-genome duplication, and (2) the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary divergence among rice, Arabidopsis, maize and soybean GSTs. By in-silico screening of the EST and genome divisions of the Genbank/EMBL/DDBJ database we have isolated 59 putative genes and two pseudogenes, making this the largest plant GST family characterised to date. Of these, 38 (62%) are represented by genomic and EST sequences and 23 (38%) are known only from their genomic sequences. A preliminary survey of EST collections shows a large degree of variability in gene expression between different tissues and environmental conditions, with a small number of genes (13) accounting for 80% of all ESTs. Rice GSTs are organised in four main phylogenetic classes, with 91% of all rice genes belonging to the two plant-specific classes Tau (40 genes) and Phi (16 genes). Pairwise identity scores range between 17 and 98% for proteins of the same class, and 7 and 21% for interclass comparisons. Rapid evolution by gene duplication is suggested by the discovery of two large clusters of 7 and 23 closely related genes on chromosomes 1 and 10, respectively. A comparison of the complete GST families in two monocot and two dicot species suggests a monophyletic origin for all Theta and Zeta GSTs, and no more than three common ancestors for all Phi and Tau genes.
BMC Genomics	Comprehensive expression analysis suggests overlapping and specific roles of rice glutathione S-transferase genes during development and stress responses	2010	National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR), Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi-110067, India. mjain@nipgr.res.in	BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are the ubiquitous enzymes that play a key role in cellular detoxification. Although several GSTs have been identified and characterized in various plant species, the knowledge about their role in developmental processes and response to various stimuli is still very limited. In this study, we report genome-wide identification, characterization and comprehensive expression analysis of members of GST gene family in crop plant rice, to reveal their function(s). RESULTS: A systematic analysis revealed the presence of at least 79 GST genes in the rice genome. Phylogenetic analysis grouped GST proteins into seven classes. Sequence analysis together with the organization of putative motifs indicated the potential diverse functions of GST gene family members in rice. The tandem gene duplications have contributed a major role in expansion of this gene family. Microarray data analysis revealed tissue-/organ- and developmental stage-specific expression patterns of several rice GST genes. At least 31 GST genes showed response to plant hormones auxin and cytokinin. Furthermore, expression analysis showed the differential expression of quite a large number of GST genes during various abiotic stress (20), arsenate stress (32) and biotic stress (48) conditions. Many of the GST genes were commonly regulated by developmental processes, hormones, abiotic and biotic stresses. CONCLUSION: The transcript profiling suggests overlapping and specific role(s) of GSTs during various stages of development in rice. Further, the study provides evidence for the role of GSTs in mediating crosstalk between various stress and hormone response pathways and represents a very useful resource for functional analysis of selected members of this family in rice.
