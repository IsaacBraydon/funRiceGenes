Plant Physiol Biochem	Updated inventory, evolutionary and expression analyses of G (PDR) type ABC transporter genes of rice.	2019	Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India.	ABC transporters constitute the largest family of transporter proteins in living organisms and divided into eight subfamilies, from A-H. ABCG members, specific to plants and fungi, belong to subfamily G. In this study, we provide updated inventory, detailed account of phylogeny, gene structure characteristics, and expression profiling during reproductive development, abiotic and biotic stresses of members of ABCG gene family in rice along with reannotation and cloning of FL-cDNA of OsABCG50/PDR23. We observed that of the 22 ABCGs/PDRs, four genes evolved as a result of gene duplication events and their expression pattern changed after duplication. Analysis of expression revealed seed and developmental stage preferential expression of five ABCG/PDR members. Transcript levels of eight ABCGs/PDRs were affected by abiotic and biotic stresses. Expression of seven ABCG/PDR genes was also altered by hormonal elicitors. The modulated expression is nicely correlated with the presence of tissue/stress specific cis-acting elements present in putative promoter region.
