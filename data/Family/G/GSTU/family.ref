Although several GSTs have been identified and characterized in various plant species, the knowledge about their role in developmental processes and response to various stimuli is still very limited. In this study, we report genome-wide identification, characterization and comprehensive expression analysis of members of GST gene family in crop plant rice, to reveal their function(s). RESULTS: A systematic analysis revealed the presence of at least 79 GST genes in the rice genome. Phylogenetic analysis grouped GST proteins into seven classes. Sequence analysis together with the organization of putative motifs indicated the potential diverse functions of GST gene family members in rice. The tandem gene duplications have contributed a major role in expansion of this gene family. Microarray data analysis revealed tissue-/organ- and developmental stage-specific expression patterns of several rice GST genes. At least 31 GST genes showed response to plant hormones auxin and cytokinin. Furthermore, expression analysis showed the differential expression of quite a large number of GST genes during various abiotic stress (20), arsenate stress (32) and biotic stress (48) conditions. Many of the GST genes were commonly regulated by developmental processes, hormones, abiotic and biotic stresses. CONCLUSION: The transcript profiling suggests overlapping and specific role(s) of GSTs during various stages of development in rice. Further, the study provides evidence for the role of GSTs in mediating crosstalk between various stress and hormone response pathways and represents a very useful resource for functional analysis of selected members of this family in rice.
Molecular Genetics & Genomics (Molecular General Genetics up to 2001)	Organisation and structural evolution of the rice glutathione S-transferase gene family.	2004	Department of Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Milan, Via Celoria 26, 20133, Milano, Italy.	Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) comprise a large family of key defence enzymes against xenobiotic toxicity. Here we describe the comprehensive characterisation of this important multigene family in the model monocot species rice [ Oryza sativa(L.)]. Furthermore, we investigate the molecular evolution of the family based on the analysis of (1) the patterns of within-genome duplication, and (2) the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary divergence among rice, Arabidopsis, maize and soybean GSTs. By in-silico screening of the EST and genome divisions of the Genbank/EMBL/DDBJ database we have isolated 59 putative genes and two pseudogenes, making this the largest plant GST family characterised to date. Of these, 38 (62%) are represented by genomic and EST sequences and 23 (38%) are known only from their genomic sequences. A preliminary survey of EST collections shows a large degree of variability in gene expression between different tissues and environmental conditions, with a small number of genes (13) accounting for 80% of all ESTs. Rice GSTs are organised in four main phylogenetic classes, with 91% of all rice genes belonging to the two plant-specific classes Tau (40 genes) and Phi (16 genes). Pairwise identity scores range between 17 and 98% for proteins of the same class, and 7 and 21% for interclass comparisons. Rapid evolution by gene duplication is suggested by the discovery of two large clusters of 7 and 23 closely related genes on chromosomes 1 and 10, respectively. A comparison of the complete GST families in two monocot and two dicot species suggests a monophyletic origin for all Theta and Zeta GSTs, and no more than three common ancestors for all Phi and Tau genes.
J. Plant Physiol.	D-Psicose induces upregulation of defense-related genes and resistance in rice against bacterial blight.	2011	Faculty of Agriculture, Gene Research Center, and Rare Sugar Research Center, Kagawa University, Miki, Kagawa 761-0795, Japan.	We examined rice responses to a rare sugar, d-psicose. Rice growth was inhibited by d-psicose but not by common sugars. Microarray analysis revealed that d-psicose treatment caused an upregulation of many defense-related genes in rice, and dose-dependent upregulation of these genes was confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The level of upregulation of defense-related genes by d-psicose was low compared with that by d-allose, which is another rare sugar known to confer induction of resistance to rice bacterial blight in rice. Treatment with d-psicose conferred resistance to bacterial blight in rice in a dose-dependent manner, and the results indicate that d-psicose might be a candidate plant activator for reducing disease development in rice.
FEBS Lett.	Osgstu3 and osgtu4, encoding tau class glutathione S-transferases, are heavy metal- and hypoxic stress-induced and differentially salt stress-responsive in rice roots.	2003	Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Ottawa, 30 Marie Curie, K1N 6N5 ON, Ottawa, Canada. ann.moons@nrc.ca	Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) have poorly understood roles in plant responses to environmental stresses. A polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced tau class GST was identified in rice roots by protein microsequencing. PEG and the heavy metals Cd (20 microM), Zn (30 microM), Co and Ni rapidly and markedly induced osgstu4 and osgstu3 in rice seedling roots. Osgstu4 and osgstu3 were also induced in roots by hypoxic stress but not by cold nor heat shock. Salt stress and abscisic acid (ABA) rapidly induced osgstu3 in rice roots, whereas osgstu4 exhibited a late salt stress and no ABA response. Salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and the auxin alpha-naphthalene acetic acid triggered osgstu4 and osgstu3 expression. Osgstu4 and osgstu3 were rapidly and markedly induced by the antioxidant dithiothreitol and the strong oxidant hydrogen peroxide, which suggested that redox perturbations and reactive oxygen species are involved in their stress response regulations.
Plant Cell Rep.	Isolation and characterization of a rice glutathione S-transferase gene promoter regulated by herbicides and hormones.	2011	Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, College of Bioengineering, Chongqing University, 400044 Chongqing, People's Republic of China. tzhu2002@yahoo.com.cn	OsGSTL2, encoding glutathione S-transferase, is a lambda class gene on chromosome 3 of rice (Oryza sativa L.). RNA blot analysis and semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays demonstrated that the transcription of OsGSTL2 in rice roots treated with chlorsulfuron increased significantly. To further understand OsGSTL2 promoter activity, a DNA fragment (GST2171) of 2,171 bp upstream of the OsGSTL2 coding region was isolated. In silico sequence analysis revealed that this fragment contains stress-regulated regulatory elements, hormone-responsive elements and three transposable elements. To define the core promoter sequence, a series of 5' truncation derivatives of GST2171 were fused to uidA gene. The chimeric genes were introduced into rice plants via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The expression of the GST2171::GUS transgene varied considerably. GUS staining indicated that the uidA gene is expressed in young seedlings, older leaves, flowering glumes and seeds, but not in older roots. Quantitative fluorescence assays revealed that the expression of the uidA gene is strong in young seedlings and decreases gradually over a period of 25 days. To our surprise, among the 5' truncation derivatives, the shortest promoter GST525 showed the highest GUS expression, and the second shortest promoter GST962 showed the lowest GUS expression. The uidA gene expression in the roots of transgenic rice seedlings is upregulated by chlorsulfuron, glyphosate, salicylic acid (SA) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). The possible roles of the repetitive elements on the OsGSTL2 promoter were discussed in terms of transcription repression and promoter induction by herbicides and hormones.
Plant Physiol.	Molecular cloning and characterization of genes related to chilling tolerance in rice	1992	Institute of Biology, National Center for Scientific Research of Vietnam, Nghia Do, Tu Liem, Hanoi, Vietnam.	Polyadenylated RNA was isolated and a cDNA library constructed from seedlings of a chilling-tolerant rice cultivar (Oryza sativa L. subsp. Japonica cv Nipponbare). Four clones were isolated by differential screening. Northern blot hybridization using RNAs from chilling-tolerant (Nipponbare) and -sensitive (IR36) cultivars revealed higher steady-state levels of transcripts for the four genes in Nipponbare than in IR36 maintained at the same low temperatures. The accumulation of transcripts homologous to selected cDNA sequences during chilling were tissue-specific. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of three clones, pBC121, pBC442, and pBC591, were determined, and no homology was identified by comparison with the latest version of EMBL and LASL gene data bases. The deduced protein sequences from the longest open reading frame of the clones pBC121 and pBC442 are rich in leucine and serine, whereas that of the clone pBC591 contains arginine-rich basic domains.
