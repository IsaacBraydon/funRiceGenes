Plant Cell Physiol.	Whole genome analysis of the OsGRF gene family encoding plant-specific putative transcription activators in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2004	Department of Energy Plant Research Laboratory, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824-1312, USA.	OsGRF1 (Oryza sativa GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR1) is a rice gene encoding a putative novel transcriptional regulator. We identified and characterized eleven homologs of OsGRF1 in the rice genome. All twelve OsGRF proteins have two highly conserved regions, the QLQ (Gln, Leu, Gln) and WRC (Trp, Arg, Cys) domains, and sequences reminiscent of transcription factors. OsGRF genes were preferentially expressed in young and growing tissues, and applied gibberellic acid (GA3) enhanced the expression of seven OsGRF genes. In situ hybridization showed high levels of OsGRF1 transcripts in the shoot apical meristem and in cells surrounding the vasculature of the intercalary meristem. In a GAL4-based yeast assay, the C-terminal region of OsGRF1 was found to have transactivation activity. These results indicate that OsGRF1 acts as a transcriptional activator. Based on the in situ expression pattern of OsGRF1, we postulate that it may be involved in regulating vegetative growth in rice.
