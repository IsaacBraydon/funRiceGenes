Plant Physiol.	A germin-like protein gene family functions as a complex quantitative trait locus conferring broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.	2009	Bioagricultural Sciences and Pest Management, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523-1177, USA.	Plant disease resistance governed by quantitative trait loci (QTL) is predicted to be effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens and long lasting. Use of these QTL to improve crop species, however, is hindered because the genes contributing to the trait are not known. Five disease resistance QTL that colocalized with defense response genes were accumulated by marker-aided selection to develop blast-resistant varieties. One advanced backcross line carrying the major-effect QTL on chromosome (chr) 8, which included a cluster of 12 germin-like protein (OsGLP) gene members, exhibited resistance to rice (Oryza sativa) blast disease over 14 cropping seasons. To determine if OsGLP members contribute to resistance and if the resistance was broad spectrum, a highly conserved portion of the OsGLP coding region was used as an RNA interference trigger to silence a few to all expressed chr 8 OsGLP family members. Challenge with two different fungal pathogens (causal agents of rice blast and sheath blight diseases) revealed that as more chr 8 OsGLP genes were suppressed, disease susceptibility of the plants increased. Of the 12 chr 8 OsGLPs, one clustered subfamily (OsGER4) contributed most to resistance. The similarities of sequence, gene organization, and roles in disease resistance of GLP family members in rice and other cereals, including barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), suggest that resistance contributed by the chr 8 OsGLP is a broad-spectrum, basal mechanism conserved among the Gramineae. Natural selection may have preserved a whole gene family to provide a stepwise, flexible defense response to pathogen invasion.
Gene	Screening and cloning of antimicrobial DNA sequences using a vital staining method	2009	Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Road, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1H 8M5. xiongying.cheng@vitegen.com	A novel method for cloning of genes coding for cytotoxic molecules based on a cell viability assay is described. The working hypothesis is that expression of DNA sequences coding for cytotoxic molecules in bacterial cells will lead to cell death or impairment, and the isolation of the impaired or dead cells could lead to identification of DNA sequences responsible for debilitating the host cells. We verified this concept by isolating the well known antimicrobial Puroindoline b gene in Escherichia coli cells. We further demonstrated the feasibility to use this approach for isolating DNA encoding for antimicrobials from cDNA expression libraries. Sequence analysis and bioassay indicated that the isolated clones encoded previously characterized antimicrobial proteins (AMPs), proteins not previously characterized as AMPs, as well as novel antimicrobial peptides. In addition, clones harboring ribosomal protein encoding cDNA were also identified. Therefore, this method could also be used to identify host genes important in maintaining bacterial cell viability.
