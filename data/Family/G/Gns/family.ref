Gene	Characterization of rice endo-beta-glucanase genes (Gns2-Gns14) defines a new subgroup within the gene family.	1998	Section of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616-8535, USA.	Thirteen new beta-glucanase-encoding genes have been identified in the rice genome. These genes, together with other monocot beta-glucanases, have now been classified into four subfamilies based on the structure and function of the genes. Two tandem gene clusters, Gns2-Gns3-Gns4 and Gns5-Gns6, were classified in the defense-related Subfamily A. Growth-related 1,3;1,4-beta-glucanase Gns1 was classified in Subfamily B. Gns7 and Gns8, together with the barley genes GVI and Hv34, represent Subfamily C. Gns9 and a beta-glucanase gene from wheat were grouped in Subfamily D. Genes in Subfamilies C and D have structures that are distinct from those of the other subfamilies, but there are very little data available on the biochemical or physiological roles of these genes. Gene expression in growing tissues and lack of gene induction in response to disease-related treatments suggest that Subfamilies C and D may function in control of plant growth.
