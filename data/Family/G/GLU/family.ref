Plant Mol. Biol.	Sequence of three members and expression of a new major subfamily of glutelin genes from rice.	1991	Department of Cell Biology, National Institute of Agrobiological Resources, Ibaraki, Japan.	Three members have been isolated of an additional glutelin gene subfamily, named subfamily B, consisting of about five members per haploid rice genome. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis showed major differences between Japonica and Indica lines, indicating the divergence of the subfamily since the split between the two varieties. While corresponding exons of the subfamily B showed 80 to 88% nucleotide sequence homology, those exons were only 60-65% homologous to those of the glutelin A subfamily, distinguishing them from the subfamily A. Intron position and derived polypeptide structure, in addition to the nucleotide sequence, confirm the subfamily B members as glutelins. Analysis of RNA from seeds of different stages of development showed that the subfamily B members were expressed at the same time as those of subfamily A, demonstrating coordinated regulation of the two subfamilies.

Plant J.	Expression of ER quality control-related genes in response to changes in BiP1 levels in developing rice endosperm.	2010	Transgenic Crop Research and Development Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	Binding protein (BiP) is the key chaperone involved in folding of secretory proteins such as seed storage proteins in the ER lumen. To obtain functional information about BiP1, a gene that is predominantly expressed during rice seed maturation, we generated several transgenic rice plants in which various levels of BiP1 protein accumulated in an endosperm-specific manner. Severe suppression (BiP1 KD) or significant over-expression (BiP1 OEmax) of BiP1 not only altered seed phenotype and the intracellular structure of endosperm cells, but also reduced seed storage protein content, starch accumulation and grain weight. Microarray and RT-PCR analyses indicated that expression of many chaperone and co-chaperone genes was induced in transgenic plants, with more prominent expression in the BiP1 KD line than in the BiP1 OEmax line. Transcriptional induction of most chaperones was observed in calli treated with dithiothreitol or tunicamycin, treatments that trigger ER stress, indicating that induction of the chaperone genes in transgenic rice was caused by an ER stress response. In transient assays using rice protoplasts, the ortholog (Os06g0622700) of the AtbZIP60 transcription factor was shown to be involved in activation of some chaperone genes. Slight increases in the BiP1 level compared with wild-type, accompanied by increased levels of calnexin and protein disulfide isomerase-like proteins, resulted in significant enhancement of seed storage protein content, without any change in intracellular structure or seed phenotype. Judicious modification of BiP1 levels in transgenic rice can provide suitable conditions for the production of secretory proteins by alleviating ER stress.

J. Exp. Bot.	Expression pattern and activity of six glutelin gene promoters in transgenic rice	2008	Key Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Environmental Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, PR China. lqqu@ibcas.ac.cn	The shortage of strong endosperm-specific expression promoters for driving the expression of recombinant protein genes in cereal endosperm is a major limitation in obtaining the required level and pattern of expression. Six promoters of seed storage glutelin genes (GluA-1, GluA-2, GluA-3, GluB-3, GluB-5, and GluC) were isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) genomic DNA by PCR. Their spatial and temporal expression patterns and expression potential in stable transgenic rice plants were examined with beta-glucuronidase (GUS) used as a reporter gene. All the promoters showed the expected spatial expression within the endosperm. The GluA-1, GluA-2, and GluA-3 promoters directed GUS expression mainly in the outer portion (peripheral region) of the endosperm. The GluB-5 and GluC promoters directed GUS expression in the whole endosperm, with the latter expressed almost evenly throughout the whole endosperm, a feature different from that of other rice glutelin gene promoters. The GluB-3 promoter directed GUS expression solely in aleurone and subaleurone layers. Promoter activities examined during seed maturation showed that the GluC promoter had much higher activity than the other promoters. These promoters are ideal candidates for achieving gene expression for multiple purposes in monocot endosperm but avoid promoter homology-based gene silencing. The GluC promoter did not contain the endosperm specificity-determining motifs GCN4, AACA, and the prolamin-box, which suggests the existence of additional regulatory mechanism in determining endosperm specificity.
Jpn. J. Genet.	Genomic DNA sequences of two new genes for new storage protein glutelin in rice.	1991	Department of Cell Biology, National Institute of Agrobiological Resources, Ibaraki.	A new cDNA and two genomic genes encoding the rice storage protein glutelin were isolated and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of one gene (GluA-3) was completely identical with that of the new cDNA identified here, and the other (GluA-4) was a pseudogene. These glutelin genes were closely related to each other, and belonged to the subfamily A containing the type I (GluA-1) and II (GluA-2) glutelin genes. The Northern blot analysis, using synthetic oligonucleotide specific to the GluA-3 gene as a probe, showed that this gene was expressed earlier than other glutelin genes during seed maturation.
