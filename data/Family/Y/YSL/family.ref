J. Biol. Chem.	Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants.	2011	Department of Global Agricultural Sciences, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657 Japan.	Eukaryotic organisms have developed diverse mechanisms for the acquisition of iron, which is required for their survival. Graminaceous plants use a chelation strategy. They secrete phytosiderophore compounds, which solubilize iron in the soil, and then take up the resulting iron-phytosiderophore complexes. Bacteria and mammals also secrete siderophores to acquire iron. Although phytosiderophore secretion is crucial for plant growth, its molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we show that the efflux of deoxymugineic acid, the primary phytosiderophore from rice and barley, involves the TOM1 and HvTOM1 genes, respectively. Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing TOM1 or HvTOM1 released (14)C-labeled deoxymugineic acid but not (14)C-labeled nicotianamine, a structural analog and biosynthetic precursor of deoxymugineic acid, indicating that the TOM1 and HvTOM1 proteins are the phytosiderophore efflux transporters. Under conditions of iron deficiency, rice and barley roots express high levels of TOM1 and HvTOM1, respectively, and the overexpression of these genes increased tolerance to iron deficiency. In rice roots, the efficiency of deoxymugineic acid secretion was enhanced by overexpression of TOM1 and decreased by its repression, providing further evidence that TOM1 encodes the efflux transporter of deoxymugineic acid. We have also identified two genes encoding efflux transporters of nicotianamine, ENA1 and ENA2. Our identification of phytosiderophore efflux transporters has revealed the final piece in the molecular machinery of iron acquisition in graminaceous plants.
Plant J.	OsYSL2 is a rice metal-nicotianamine transporter that is regulated by iron and expressed in the phloem.	2004	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	We identified 18 putative yellow stripe 1 (YS1)-like genes (OsYSLs) in the rice genome that exhibited 36-76% sequence similarity to maize iron(III)-phytosiderophore transporter YS1. Of particular interest was OsYSL2, the transcripts of which were not detected in the roots of either iron-sufficient or iron-deficient plants, but dramatic expression was induced in the leaves by iron deficiency. Based on the nucleotide sequence, OsYSL2 was predicted to encode a polypeptide of 674 amino acids containing 14 putative transmembrane domains. OsYSL2:green fluorescent protein (GFP) was localized in the plasma membrane of onion epidermal cells. Promoter:beta-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis revealed that OsYSL2 was expressed in companion cells in iron-sufficient roots. GUS activity was increased in companion cells, but no GUS staining was observed in epidermal or cortex cells, even in iron-deficient roots. In the leaves and leaf sheaths of iron-sufficient rice, GUS staining was observed in phloem cells of the vascular bundles. In iron-deficient leaves, the OsYSL2 promoter was active in all tissues with particularly strong GUS activity evident in companion cells. The phloem-specific expression of the OsYSL2 promoter suggests that OsYSL2 is involved in the phloem transport of iron. Strong OsYSL2 promoter activity was also detected in developing seeds. Electrophysiological measurements using Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that OsYSL2 transported iron(II)-nicotianamine (NA) and manganese(II)-NA, but did not transport iron(III)-phyosiderophore. These results suggest that OsYSL2 is a rice metal-NA transporter that is responsible for the phloem transport of iron and manganese, including the translocation of iron and manganese into the grain.
Plant Mol. Biol.	OsYSL18 is a rice iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid transporter specifically expressed in reproductive organs and phloem of lamina joints.	2009	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Iron uptake and translocation in plants are important processes for both plant and human nutrition, whereas relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms of iron transport within the plant body. Several reports have shown that yellow stripe 1 (YS1) and YS1-like (YSL) transporters mediate metal-phytosiderophore uptake and/or metal-nicotianamine translocation. Among the 18 YSL genes in rice (OsYSLs), OsYSL18 is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 679 amino acids containing 13 putative transmembrane domains. An OsYSL18-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion was localized to the plasma membrane when transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells. Electrophysiological measurements using Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that OsYSL18 transports iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid, but not iron(II)-nicotianamine, zinc(II)-deoxymugineic acid, or zinc(II)-nicotianamine. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis revealed more OsYSL18 transcripts in flowers than in shoots or roots. OsYSL18 promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis revealed that OsYSL18 was expressed in reproductive organs including the pollen tube. In vegetative organs, OsYSL18 was specifically expressed in lamina joints, the inner cortex of crown roots, and phloem parenchyma and companion cells at the basal part of every leaf sheath. These results suggest that OsYSL18 is an iron-phytosiderophore transporter involved in the translocation of iron in reproductive organs and phloem in joints.
Gene	Mapping QTLs and candidate genes for iron and zinc concentrations in unpolished rice of MadhukarXSwarna RILs.	2012	Directorate of Rice Research, Hyderabad, India.	Identifying QTLs/genes for iron and zinc in rice grains can help in biofortification programs. 168 F(7) RILs derived from MadhukarxSwarna were used to map QTLs for iron and zinc concentrations in unpolished rice grains. Iron ranged from 0.2 to 224 ppm and zinc ranged from 0.4 to 104ppm. Genome wide mapping using 101 SSRs and 9 gene specific markers showed 5 QTLs on chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 7 and 12 significantly linked to iron, zinc or both. In all, 14 QTLs were identified for these two traits. QTLs for iron were co-located with QTLs for zinc on chromosomes 7 and 12. In all, ten candidate genes known for iron and zinc homeostasis underlie 12 of the 14 QTLs. Another 6 candidate genes were close to QTLs on chromosomes 3, 5 and 7. Thus the high priority candidate genes for high Fe and Zn in seeds are OsYSL1 and OsMTP1 for iron, OsARD2, OsIRT1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2 for zinc and OsNAS3, OsNRAMP1, Heavy metal ion transport and APRT for both iron and zinc together based on our genetic mapping studies as these genes strictly underlie QTLs. Several elite lines with high Fe, high Zn and both were identified.

Plant Physiol. Biochem.	Expression profiling of Oryza sativa metal homeostasis genes in different rice cultivars using a cDNA macroarray.	2007	USDA-ARS Children's Nutrition Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, 1100 Bates Street, Houston, TX 77030, USA.	Rice is an important food crop, but it is a poor source of essential micronutrients such as iron and zinc. In order to improve the metal ion content of rice grains through breeding or biotechnology, more information is needed on the molecular players that help mobilize metals from leaves to developing seeds. To profile several genes simultaneously, a cDNA macroarray was developed using 36 metal-related genes from rice, including ZIPs, NRAMPs, and YSLs (coding for known or potential metal transporters), as well as NAS, FER, FRO, NAAT, FDH, GSTU, and PDR (involved in metal homeostasis). Because flag leaves are the major source of phloem-delivered photoassimilates and remobilized metals for developing seeds, we analyzed the expression of these metal-related genes in flag and non-flag leaves of four different rice cultivars (Cocodrie, Taipei 309, IR58, and IR68144) during the period of mid-grain fill. Genes (24 of 36) exhibited low to non-detectable signals in the macroarray, while 12 genes (OsIRT1, OsZIP1, OsZIP5, OsZIP8, OsYSL5, OsYSL6, OsYSL7, OsYSL8, OsYSL18, OsNRAMP2, OsNRAMP4 and OsNRAMP7) were found to be highly expressed in both flag and non-flag leaves of all four cultivars. Additional expression analysis using semi-quantitative or quantitative PCR provided results that were generally consistent with the macroarray, but semi-quantitative PCR confirmed that OsFDH, OsFER1, OsNAAT, OsNAS1, OsPDR9, OsYSL12, OsYSL13, OsZIP7, and OsZIP10 were also expressed in leaves. This specialized macroarray has provided a short list of potential candidate genes, expressed in leaves, which might contribute to the process of metal transport to distant sinks, such as seeds.
Mol. Cells	Activation of rice Yellow Stripe1-Like 16 (OsYSL16) enhances iron efficiency.	2012	Department of Biological Sciences, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA.	Graminaceous plants release ferric-chelating phytosiderophores that bind to iron. These ferric-phytosiderophore complexes are transported across the plasma membrane by a protein produced from Yellow Stripe 1 (YS1). Here, we report the characterization of OsYSL16, one of the YS1-like genes in rice. Real-time analysis revealed that this gene was constitutively expressed irrespective of metal status. Promoter fusions of OsYSL16 to beta-glucuronidase (GUS) showed that OsYSL16 was highly expressed in the vascular tissues of the root, leaf, and spikelet, and in leaf mesophyll cells. The OsYSL16-green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane. From a pool of rice T-DNA insertional lines, we identified two independent activation-tagging mutants in OsYSL16. On an Fe-deficient medium, those mutants retained relatively high chlorophyll concentrations compared with the wild-type (WT) controls, indicating that they are more tolerant to a lack of iron. The Fe concentration in shoots was also higher in the OsYSL16 activation lines than in the WT. During germination, the rate of Fe-utilization from the seeds was higher in the OsYSL16 activation lines than in the WT seeds. Our results suggest that the function of OsYSL16 in Fe-homeostasis is to enable distribution of iron within a plant.
