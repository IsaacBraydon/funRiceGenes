Plant Physiol. Biochem.	Expression profiling of Oryza sativa metal homeostasis genes in different rice cultivars using a cDNA macroarray.	2007	USDA-ARS Children's Nutrition Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, 1100 Bates Street, Houston, TX 77030, USA.	Rice is an important food crop, but it is a poor source of essential micronutrients such as iron and zinc. In order to improve the metal ion content of rice grains through breeding or biotechnology, more information is needed on the molecular players that help mobilize metals from leaves to developing seeds. To profile several genes simultaneously, a cDNA macroarray was developed using 36 metal-related genes from rice, including ZIPs, NRAMPs, and YSLs (coding for known or potential metal transporters), as well as NAS, FER, FRO, NAAT, FDH, GSTU, and PDR (involved in metal homeostasis). Because flag leaves are the major source of phloem-delivered photoassimilates and remobilized metals for developing seeds, we analyzed the expression of these metal-related genes in flag and non-flag leaves of four different rice cultivars (Cocodrie, Taipei 309, IR58, and IR68144) during the period of mid-grain fill. Genes (24 of 36) exhibited low to non-detectable signals in the macroarray, while 12 genes (OsIRT1, OsZIP1, OsZIP5, OsZIP8, OsYSL5, OsYSL6, OsYSL7, OsYSL8, OsYSL18, OsNRAMP2, OsNRAMP4 and OsNRAMP7) were found to be highly expressed in both flag and non-flag leaves of all four cultivars. Additional expression analysis using semi-quantitative or quantitative PCR provided results that were generally consistent with the macroarray, but semi-quantitative PCR confirmed that OsFDH, OsFER1, OsNAAT, OsNAS1, OsPDR9, OsYSL12, OsYSL13, OsZIP7, and OsZIP10 were also expressed in leaves. This specialized macroarray has provided a short list of potential candidate genes, expressed in leaves, which might contribute to the process of metal transport to distant sinks, such as seeds.
J. Exp. Bot.	The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice.	2011	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal toxic to humans and the accumulation of Cd in the rice grain is a major agricultural problem, particularly in Asia. The role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in Cd uptake and transport in rice was investigated here. An OsNRAMP1:GFP fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane in onion epidermal cells. The growth of yeast expressing OsNRAMP1 was impaired in the presence of Cd compared with yeast transformed with an empty vector. Moreover, the Cd content of OsNRAMP1-expressing yeast exceeded that of the vector control. The expression of OsNRAMP1 in the roots was higher in a high Cd-accumulating cultivar (Habataki) than a low Cd-accumulating cultivar (Sasanishiki) regardless of the presence of Cd, and the amino acid sequence of OsNRAMP1 showed 100% identity between Sasanishiki and Habataki. Over-expression of OsNRAMP1 in rice increased Cd accumulation in the leaves. These results suggest that OsNRAMP1 participates in cellular Cd uptake and Cd transport within plants, and the higher expression of OsNRAMP1 in the roots could lead to an increase in Cd accumulation in the shoots. Our results indicated that OsNRAMP1 is an important protein in high-level Cd accumulation in rice.

Plant Mol. Biol.	Cloning and characterization of the OsNramp family from Oryza sativa, a new family of membrane proteins possibly implicated in the transport of metal ions.	1997	Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal Quebec, Canada.	The mammalian Nramp1 protein is an integral membrane protein expressed exclusively in macrophages, where it plays a critical role in the ability of these cells to destroy ingested microbes. The bactericidal mechanism of action of Nramp1 remains unknown. We report the identification and characterization of cDNA clones corresponding to three homologues of the mammalian Nramp1 gene from the genome of Oryza sativa, OsNramp1, OsNramp2, and OsNramp3. These three genes encode a novel group of highly similar hydrophobic polypeptides sharing between 64% and 75% sequence similarity, that show similar hydropathy profiles, and predicted secondary structure, including the same number, position, and sequence characteristics (including conserved charges) of transmembrane domains. Together, these define a highly conserved membrane associated hydrophobic core. The three plant proteins show a remarkable degree of sequence similarity with their mammalian counterpart (60% to 70% similarity), including primary and secondary structure elements previously described in ion transporters and channels. Expression studies in normal plant tissues indicate that while OsNramp1 is expressed primarily in roots, and OsNramp2 is primarily expressed in leaves, OsNramp3 is expressed in both tissues. The recent discovery that the yeast Nramp homologue SMF1 functions as a manganese transporter raises the exciting possibility that OsNramp encodes a family of metal ion transporters in plants.
