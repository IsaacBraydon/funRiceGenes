Trends Plant Sci.	Plant ABC proteins--a unified nomenclature and updated inventory.	2008	Biomathematics and Bioinformatics Department, Rothamsted Research, Harpenden, AL5 2JQ, UK.	The ABC superfamily comprises both membrane-bound transporters and soluble proteins involved in a broad range of processes, many of which are of considerable agricultural, biotechnological and medical potential. Completion of the Arabidopsis and rice genome sequences has revealed a particularly large and diverse complement of plant ABC proteins in comparison with other organisms. Forward and reverse genetics, together with heterologous expression, have uncovered many novel roles for plant ABC proteins, but this progress has been accompanied by a confusing proliferation of names for plant ABC genes and their products. A consolidated nomenclature will provide much-needed clarity and a framework for future research.
Genome	Genome-wide identification, evolutionary and expression analyses of putative Fe-S biogenesis genes in rice (Oryza sativa).	2012	Department of Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, College of Agriculture, Indira Gandhi Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya, Krishak Nagar - 492 012 Raipur (CG), India. kesawatbsmahi@gmail.com	Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins are ubiquitous in nature and carry Fe-S clusters (ISCs) as prosthetic groups that are essential in maintaining basic biological processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, nitrogen fixation, and DNA repair. In the present investigation, a comprehensive genome-wide analysis was carried out to find all the genes involved in the formation of ISCs in rice ( Oryza sativa L.) through a systematic EST and genomic DNA sequence data mining. This analysis profiled 44 rice ISC genes (OsISCs) that were identified using in silico analysis. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis revealed that these genes were highly conserved among bacteria, fungi, animals, and plants. EST analysis and RT-PCR assays demonstrated that all OsISCs were active and that the transcript abundance of some OsISCs was tissue specific. The results of this study will assist further investigations to identify and elucidate the structural components involved in the assembly, biogenesis, and regulation of OsISCs. Thus, the outcome of the present study provides basic genomic information for the OsISC and will pave the way for elucidating the precise role of OsISCs in plant growth and development in the future. Also, it may enable us in the future to enhance the crop yield, uptake of Fe, and protection against abiotic and biotic stress.
