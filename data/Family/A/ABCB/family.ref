FEBS J.	Expression profile of PIN, AUX/LAX and PGP auxin transporter gene families in Sorghum bicolor under phytohormone and abiotic stress.	2010	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Auxin is transported by the influx carriers auxin resistant 1/like aux1 (AUX/LAX), and the efflux carriers pin-formed (PIN) and P-glycoprotein (PGP), which play a major role in polar auxin transport. Several auxin transporter genes have been characterized in dicotyledonous Arabidopsis, but most are unknown in monocotyledons, especially in sorghum. Here, we analyze the chromosome distribution, gene duplication and intron/exon of SbPIN, SbLAX and SbPGP gene families, and examine their phylogenic relationships in Arabidopsis, rice and sorghum. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that most of these genes were differently expressed in the organs of sorghum. SbPIN3 and SbPIN9 were highly expressed in flowers, SbLAX2 and SbPGP17 were mainly expressed in stems, and SbPGP7 was strongly expressed in roots. This suggests that individual genes might participate in specific organ development. The expression profiles of these gene families were analyzed after treatment with: (a) the phytohormones indole-3-acetic acid and brassinosteroid; (b) the polar auxin transport inhibitors 1-naphthoxyacetic acids, 1-naphthylphthalamic acid and 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid; and (c) abscissic acid and the abiotic stresses of high salinity and drought. Most of the auxin transporter genes were strongly induced by indole-3-acetic acid and brassinosteroid, providing new evidence for the synergism of these phytohormones. Interestingly, most genes showed similar trends in expression under polar auxin transport inhibitors and each also responded to abscissic acid, salt and drought. This study provides new insights into the auxin transporters of sorghum.
Trends Plant Sci.	Plant ABC proteins--a unified nomenclature and updated inventory.	2008	Biomathematics and Bioinformatics Department, Rothamsted Research, Harpenden, AL5 2JQ, UK.	The ABC superfamily comprises both membrane-bound transporters and soluble proteins involved in a broad range of processes, many of which are of considerable agricultural, biotechnological and medical potential. Completion of the Arabidopsis and rice genome sequences has revealed a particularly large and diverse complement of plant ABC proteins in comparison with other organisms. Forward and reverse genetics, together with heterologous expression, have uncovered many novel roles for plant ABC proteins, but this progress has been accompanied by a confusing proliferation of names for plant ABC genes and their products. A consolidated nomenclature will provide much-needed clarity and a framework for future research.
Genome	Genome-wide identification, evolutionary and expression analyses of putative Fe-S biogenesis genes in rice (Oryza sativa).	2012	Department of Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, College of Agriculture, Indira Gandhi Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya, Krishak Nagar - 492 012 Raipur (CG), India. kesawatbsmahi@gmail.com	Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins are ubiquitous in nature and carry Fe-S clusters (ISCs) as prosthetic groups that are essential in maintaining basic biological processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, nitrogen fixation, and DNA repair. In the present investigation, a comprehensive genome-wide analysis was carried out to find all the genes involved in the formation of ISCs in rice ( Oryza sativa L.) through a systematic EST and genomic DNA sequence data mining. This analysis profiled 44 rice ISC genes (OsISCs) that were identified using in silico analysis. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis revealed that these genes were highly conserved among bacteria, fungi, animals, and plants. EST analysis and RT-PCR assays demonstrated that all OsISCs were active and that the transcript abundance of some OsISCs was tissue specific. The results of this study will assist further investigations to identify and elucidate the structural components involved in the assembly, biogenesis, and regulation of OsISCs. Thus, the outcome of the present study provides basic genomic information for the OsISC and will pave the way for elucidating the precise role of OsISCs in plant growth and development in the future. Also, it may enable us in the future to enhance the crop yield, uptake of Fe, and protection against abiotic and biotic stress.
