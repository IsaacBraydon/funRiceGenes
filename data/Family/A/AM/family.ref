Plant Cell	Arbuscular mycorrhiza-specific signaling in rice transcends the common symbiosis signaling pathway.	2008	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Lausane, 1015 Lausane, Switzerland.	Knowledge about signaling in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses is currently restricted to the common symbiosis (SYM) signaling pathway discovered in legumes. This pathway includes calcium as a second messenger and regulates both AM and rhizobial symbioses. Both monocotyledons and dicotyledons form symbiotic associations with AM fungi, and although they differ markedly in the organization of their root systems, the morphology of colonization is similar. To identify and dissect AM-specific signaling in rice (Oryza sativa), we developed molecular phenotyping tools based on gene expression patterns that monitor various steps of AM colonization. These tools were used to distinguish common SYM-dependent and -independent signaling by examining rice mutants of selected putative legume signaling orthologs predicted to be perturbed both upstream (CASTOR and POLLUX) and downstream (CCAMK and CYCLOPS) of the central, calcium-spiking signal. All four mutants displayed impaired AM interactions and altered AM-specific gene expression patterns, therefore demonstrating functional conservation of SYM signaling between distant plant species. In addition, differential gene expression patterns in the mutants provided evidence for AM-specific but SYM-independent signaling in rice and furthermore for unexpected deviations from the SYM pathway downstream of calcium spiking.
Phytochemistry	The class III peroxidase multigenic family in rice and its evolution in land plants	2004	Laboratory of Plant Physiology, University of Geneva, Quai Ernest-Ansermet 30, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.	Plant peroxidases (class III peroxidases, E.C. 1.11.1.7) are secreted glycoproteins known to be involved in the mechanism of cell elongation, in cell wall construction and differentiation, and in the defense against pathogens. They usually form large multigenic families in angiosperms. The recent completion of rice (Oryza sativa japonica c.v. Nipponbare) genome sequencing allowed drawing up the full inventory of the genes encoding class III peroxidases in this plant. We found 138 peroxidase genes distributed among the 12 rice chromosomes. In contrast to several other gene families studied so far, peroxidase genes are twice as numerous in rice as in Arabidopsis. This large number of genes results from various duplication events that were tentatively traced back using a phylogenetic tree based on the alignment of conserved amino acid sequences. We also searched for peroxidase encoding genes in the major phyla of plant kingdom. In addition to gymnosperms and angiosperms, sequences were found in liverworts, mosses and ferns, but not in unicellular green algae. Two rice and one Arabidopsis peroxidase genes appeared to be rather close to the only known sequence from the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. The possible relationship of these peroxidases with the putative ancestor of peroxidase genes is discussed, as well as the connection between the development of the class III peroxidase multigenic family and the emergence of the first land plants.
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.	Comparative transcriptomics of rice reveals an ancient pattern of response to microbial colonization.	2005	Laboratory of Plant Genetics, University of Geneva, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland.	Glomalean fungi induce and colonize symbiotic tissue called arbuscular mycorrhiza on the roots of most land plants. Other fungi also colonize plants but cause disease not symbiosis. Whole-transcriptome analysis using a custom-designed Affymetrix Gene-Chip and confirmation with real-time RT-PCR revealed 224 genes affected during arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. We compared these transcription profiles with those from rice roots that were colonized by pathogens (Magnaporthe grisea and Fusarium moniliforme). Over 40% of genes showed differential regulation caused by both the symbiotic and at least one of the pathogenic interactions. A set of genes was similarly expressed in all three associations, revealing a conserved response to fungal colonization. The responses that were shared between pathogen and symbiont infection may play a role in compatibility. Likewise, the responses that are different may cause disease. Some of the genes that respond to mycorrhizal colonization may be involved in the uptake of phosphate. Indeed, phosphate addition mimicked the effect of mycorrhiza on 8% of the tested genes. We found that 34% of the mycorrhiza-associated rice genes were also associated with mycorrhiza in dicots, revealing a conserved pattern of response between the two angiosperm classes.
Plant Cell Physiol.	Identification of 33 rice aquaporin genes and analysis of their expression and function	2005	CO2 and Temperature Research Laboratory, National Agricultural Research Center for Tohoku Region, Morioka, 020-0198 Japan. junkoi@affrc.go.jp	Plant aquaporins form a large protein family including plasma membrane-type (PIPs) and tonoplast-type aquaporins (TIPs), and facilitate osmotic water transport across membranes as a key physiological function. We identified 33 genes for aquaporins in the genome sequence of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare). We investigated their expression levels in leaf blades, roots and anthers of rice (cv. Akitakomachi) using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). At both early tillering (21 d after germination) and panicle formation (56 d) stages, six genes, including OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;5, were expressed predominantly in roots, while 14 genes, including OsPIP2;7 and OsTIP1;2, were found in leaf blades. Eight genes, such as OsPIP1;1 and OsTIP4;1, were evenly expressed in leaf blades, roots and anthers. Analysis by stopped-flow spectrophotometry revealed high water channel activity when OsPIP2;4 or OsPIP2;5 were expressed in yeast but not when OsPIP1;1 or OsPIP1;2 were expressed. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;5 showed a clear diurnal fluctuation in roots; they showed a peak 3 h after the onset of light and dropped to a minimum 3 h after the onset of darkness. The mRNA levels of 10 genes including OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;5 markedly decreased in roots during chilling treatment and recovered after warming. The changes in mRNA levels during and after the chilling treatment were comparable with that of the bleeding sap volume. These results suggested the relationship between the root water uptake and mRNA levels of several aquaporins with high water channel activity, such as OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;5.
