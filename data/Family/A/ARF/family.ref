Genes Genet. Syst.	Auxin response factor family in rice.	2001		
Gene	Genome-wide analysis of the auxin response factors (ARF) gene family in rice (Oryza sativa).	2007	Crop Molecular Breeding Center, Institute of Crop and Nuclear Technology Utilization, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou 310021, P.R. China.	Auxin response factors (ARFs) are transcription factors that bind with specificity to TGTCTC-containing auxin response elements (AuxREs) found in promoters of primary/early auxin response genes and mediate responses to the plant hormone auxin. The ARF genes are represented by a large multigene family in plants. A comprehensive genome-wide analysis was carried out in this study to find all ARFs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa subsp. japonica), 23 and 25 ARF genes, named as AtARFs and OsARFs, were identified, respectively. Chromosomal locations of all OsARFs were presented and it was found that the duplication of OsARFs was associated with only the chromosomal block duplications but not local tandem duplications. A phylogenetic tree was generated from alignments of the full-length protein sequences of 25 OsARFs and 23 AtARFs to examine the phylogenetic relationships of rice and Arabidopsis ARF proteins. All 48 members of ARF gene families fell into three major classes, a total of 13 sister pairs, including 9 OsARF-OsARF, 2 AtARF-AtARF and 2 AtARF-OsARF sister pairs were formed, showing different orthologous relationships between AtARFs and OsARFs. EST analysis and RT-PCR assays demonstrated that 24 of all 25 OsARF genes were active and the transcript abundance of some OsARF genes was affected by auxin treatment or light- and dark-grown conditions. The outcome of the present study provides basic genomic information for the rice ARF gene family and will pave the way for elucidating the precise role of OsARFs in plant growth and development in the future.
Plant Mol. Biol.	OsARF1, an auxin response factor from rice, is auxin-regulated and classifies as a primary auxin responsive gene.	2002	Institut fur Biologie II, Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat, Freiburg. frankw@aist-nara.ac.jp	We screened for auxin-induced genes with an expression correlated to the auxin-induced growth response from rice coleoptiles by fluorescent differential display. A rice homologue of the auxin response factor (ARF) family of transcriptional regulators, OsARF1, was identified. An OsARF1:GFP fusion protein was localized to the nucleus. Steady-state levels of OsARF1 mRNA correlated positively with auxin-dependent differential growth: gravitropic stimulation enhanced the amount of OsARF1 transcript in the lower, faster-growing flank accompanied by a decrease in the upper flank of gravitropically stimulated rice coleoptiles. Exogenous auxin up-regulated the steady-state level of OsARF1 mRNA within 15-30 min. This up-regulation is independent of de novo protein synthesis. Thus, OsARF1 is the first ARF that classifies as an early auxin-responsive gene. The observed auxin-dependent regulation comprises a new level of regulation in auxin-induced gene expression and is discussed as a possible feedback mechanism in plant growth control.
J. Exp. Bot.	Functional analysis of the structural domain of ARF proteins in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2010	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Auxin response factors (ARFs) are key regulators of plant growth and development. Through interaction with auxin/indole acetic acid (Aux/IAA) proteins, they influence the expression of auxin response genes. An ARF gene family has been predicted in rice, but the functions of the individual structural domains of the OsARFs remain obscure. Bioinformatics was used to analyse the position of the DNA-binding domain (DBD), middle region (MR), and C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD) of OsARFs, and experimentally confirmed the presence of a classical monopartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the DBD. The DBD was shown to contribute to nuclear localization of OsARF proteins in addition to its known DNA-binding function. Interactions between 14 integrated OsARFs and 15 OsIAA proteins were tested using yeast two-hybrid assays. It was found that eight OsARF activators interacted with the 15 OsIAA proteins, while six OsARF repressors did not. The interactions between the MR+CTD or CTD of 10 OsARFs and 15 OsIAA proteins were also tested and the results were consistent with those of each intact OsARF, although some slight differences in interaction intensity were observed by alpha-galactosidase quantitative assays. The truncated CTD of OsARF11 did not interact with any OsIAA, implying that the CTD is required for ARF-IAA dimerization, and that the MR influences the interaction intensity in yeast. A subset of the interactions in yeast were also observed in tobacco plants using firefly luciferase complementation imaging assays, indicating that these interactions are specific in plants, and might have a special role in the auxin signalling response. This study provides new insight into the structure of OsARF proteins and ARF-Aux/IAA interactions.
Nucleic Acids Res.	'Evidence of an auxin signal pathway, MicroRNA167-ARF8-GH3, and its response to exogenous auxin in cultured rice cells'.	2006	Department of Biological Science and the Basic Science Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea 440-746.	MicroRNA167 (miR167) was shown to cleave auxin responsive factor 8 (ARF8) mRNA in cultured rice cells. MiR167 level was found to be controlled by the presence of auxin in the growth medium. When cells grew in auxin-free medium, miR167 level decreased, resulting in an increase in the level of ARF8 mRNA. Cells growing in the normal growth medium containing auxin showed a reversed trend. It was also shown that expression of OsGH3-2, an rice IAA-conjugating enzyme, was positively regulated by ARF8. Delivery of synthesized miR167 into cells led to decrease of both ARF8 mRNA and OsGH3-2 mRNA. This study provides an evidence in which the exogeneous auxin signal is transduced to OsGH3-2 through miR167 and ARF8 in sequence. This proposed auxin signal transduction pathway, auxin-miR167-ARF8-OsGH3-2, could be, in conjunction with the other microRNA-mediated auxin signals, an important one for responding to exogeneous auxin and for determining the cellular free auxin level which guides appropriate auxin responses.
