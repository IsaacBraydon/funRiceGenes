BMC Plant Biology	Proteomic identification of OsCYP2, a rice cyclophilin that confers salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings when overexpressed	2011	Plant Molecular Biology &amp; Proteomics Lab, Institute of Biotechnology, Hangzhou Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou 310024, PR China. ruansl1@hotmail.com	BACKGROUND: High Salinity is a major environmental stress influencing growth and development of rice. Comparative proteomic analysis of hybrid rice shoot proteins from Shanyou 10 seedlings, a salt-tolerant hybrid variety, and Liangyoupeijiu seedlings, a salt-sensitive hybrid variety, was performed to identify new components involved in salt-stress signaling. RESULTS: Phenotypic analysis of one protein that was upregulated during salt-induced stress, cyclophilin 2 (OsCYP2), indicated that OsCYP2 transgenic rice seedlings had better tolerance to salt stress than did wild-type seedlings. Interestingly, wild-type seedlings exhibited a marked reduction in maximal photochemical efficiency under salt stress, whereas no such change was observed for OsCYP2-transgenic seedlings. OsCYP2-transgenic seedlings had lower levels of lipid peroxidation products and higher activities of antioxidant enzymes than wild-type seedlings. Spatiotemporal expression analysis of OsCYP2 showed that it could be induced by salt stress in both Shanyou 10 and Liangyoupeijiu seedlings, but Shanyou 10 seedlings showed higher OsCYP2 expression levels. Moreover, circadian rhythm expression of OsCYP2 in Shanyou 10 seedlings occurred earlier than in Liangyoupeijiu seedlings. Treatment with PEG, heat, or ABA induced OsCYP2 expression in Shanyou 10 seedlings but inhibited its expression in Liangyoupeijiu seedlings. Cold stress inhibited OsCYP2 expression in Shanyou 10 and Liangyoupeijiu seedlings. In addition, OsCYP2 was strongly expressed in shoots but rarely in roots in two rice hybrid varieties. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data suggest that OsCYP2 may act as a key regulator that controls ROS level by modulating activities of antioxidant enzymes at translation level. OsCYP2 expression is not only induced by salt stress, but also regulated by circadian rhythm. Moreover, OsCYP2 is also likely to act as a key component that is involved in signal pathways of other types of stresses-PEG, heat, cold, or ABA.
Proteomics	Proteome analysis of differentially displayed proteins as a tool for investigating ozone stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings.	2002	Research Laboratory for Agricultural Biotechnology and Biochemistry (RLABB), Kathmandu, Nepal.	Employing classical two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), amino acid sequencing and immunoblot analysis, we examine for the first time the effect of ozone, a highly notorious environmental pollutant, on rice seedling proteins. Drastic visible necrotic damage to leaf by ozone and consequent increase in ascorbate peroxidase protein(s) was accompanied by rapid changes in the 2-DE protein profiles, over controls. Out of a total of 56 proteins investigated, which were reproducible in repeated experiments, 52 protein spots were visually identified as differentially expressed over controls. Six proteins were N-terminally blocked, and the sequence of 14 proteins could not be determined, whereas 36 proteins were N-terminally and one was internally sequenced. Ozone caused drastic reductions in the major leaf photosynthetic proteins, including the abundantly present ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, and induction of various defense/stress related proteins. Most prominent change in leaves, within 24 h post-treatment with ozone, was the induced accumulation of a pathogenesis related (PR) class 5 protein, three PR 10 class proteins, ascorbate peroxidase(s), superoxide dismutase, calcium-binding protein, calreticulin, a novel ATP-dependent CLP protease, and an unknown protein. Present results demonstrate the highly damaging effect of ozone on rice seedlings at the level of the proteome.
J. Plant Physiol.	Involvement of hydrogen peroxide in heat shock- and cadmium-induced expression of ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase in leaves of rice seedlings.	2012	Department of Agronomy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.	Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is considered a signal molecule inducing cellular stress. Both heat shock (HS) and Cd can increase H2O2 content. We investigated the involvement of H2O2 in HS- and Cd-mediated changes in the expression of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) in leaves of rice seedlings. HS treatment increased the content of H2O2 before it increased activities of APX and GR in rice leaves. Moreover, HS-induced H2O2 production and APX and GR activities could be counteracted by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors dipehenylene iodonium (DPI) and imidazole (IMD). HS-induced OsAPX2 gene expression was associated with HS-induced APX activity but was not regulated by H2O2. Cd-increased H2O2 content and APX and GR activities were lower with than without HS. Cd did not increase the expression of OsAPX and OsGR without HS treatment. Cd increased H2O2 content by Cd before it increased APX and GR activities without HS. Treatment with DPI and IMD effectively inhibited Cd-induced H2O2 production and APX and GR activities. Moreover, the effects of DPI and IMD could be rescued with H2O2 treatment. H2O2 may be involved in the regulation of HS- and Cd-increased APX and GR activities in leaves of rice seedlings.
Journal of Experimental Botany	Heat shock-mediated APX gene expression and protection against chilling injury in rice seedlings.	2001	Hokkaido National Agricultural Experiment Station, Hitsujigaoka 1, Toyohira-ku, Sapporo 062-8555, Japan. yutaka@cryo.affrc.go.jp	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings, when kept at 42 degrees C for 24 h before being kept at 5 degrees C for 7 d, did not develop chilling injury. Chilling resistance was enhanced in parallel with the period of heat-treatment. The level of APX activity was higher in heated seedlings whereas CAT activity was decreased by heat stress. There was no significant difference in SOD activity between heated and unheated seedlings. The elevated activity of APX was sustained after 7 d of chilling. The cytosolic APX gene expression in response to high and low temperature was analysed with an APXa gene probe. APXa mRNA levels increased within 1 h after seedlings were exposed to 42 degrees C. Elevated APXa mRNA levels could also be detected after 24 h of heating. The APXa mRNA level in preheated seedlings was still higher than unheated seedlings under cold stress. The promoter of the APXa gene was cloned from rice genomic DNA by TAIL-PCR, and characterized by DNA sequencing. The promoter had a minimal heat shock factor-binding motif, 5'-nGAAnnTTCn-3', located in the 81 bp upstream of the TATA box. Heat shock induction of the APXa gene could be a possible cause of reduced chilling injury in rice seedlings.
Planta.	Rice ascorbate peroxidase gene family encodes functionally diverse isoforms localized in different subcellular compartments.	2006	Laboratorio de Genetica Molecular Vegetal, Departamento de Genetica, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, 21944-970, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.	Aerobic organisms evolved a complex antioxidant system, which protect the cells against oxidative damage caused by partially reduced oxygen intermediates, also known as reactive oxygen species. In plants, ascorbate peroxidases (EC, 1.11.1.11) catalyze the conversion of H(2)O(2) to H(2)O, using ascorbate as the specific electron donor in this enzymatic reaction. Previously, eight APx genes were identified in the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome through in silico analysis: two cytosolic isoforms, two putative peroxisomal isoforms, and four putative chloroplastic ones. Using gene-specific probes, we confirmed the presence of the eight APx genes in the rice genome by Southern blot hybridization. Transcript accumulation analysis showed specific expression patterns for each member of the APx family according to developmental stage and in response to salt stress, revealing the complexity of the antioxidant system in plants. Finally, the subcellular localization of rice APx isoforms was determined using GFP-fusion proteins in BY-2 tobacco cells. In agreement with the initial prediction, OSAPX3 was localized in the peroxisomes. On the other hand, the OSAPX6-GFP fusion protein was found in mitochondria of the BY-2 cells, in contrast to the chloroplastic location predicted by sequence analysis. Our findings reveal the functional diversity of the rice APx genes and suggest complementation and coordination of the antioxidant defenses in different cellular compartments during development and abiotic stress.
J. Mol. Evol.	Analysis of the molecular evolutionary history of the ascorbate peroxidase gene family: inferences from the rice genome.	2004	Laboratorio de Genetica Molecular Vegetal, Departamento de Genetica, UFRJ, 21944-970 Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.	Ascorbate peroxidase (APx) is a class I peroxidase that catalyzes the conversion of H(2)O(2) to H(2)O and O(2) using ascorbate as the specific electron donor. This enzyme has a key function in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the protection against toxic effects of ROS in higher plants, algae, and Euglena. Here we report the identification of an APx multigene family in rice and propose a molecular evolutionary relationship between the diverse APx isoforms. In rice, the APx gene family has eight members, which encode two cytosolic, two putative peroxisomal, and four chloroplastic isoforms, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using all APx protein sequences available in the NCBI databases. The results indicate that the different APx isoforms arose by a complex evolutionary process involving several gene duplications. The structural organization of APx genes also reflects this process and provides evidence for a close relationship among proteins located in the same subcellular compartment. A molecular evolutionary pathway, in which cytosolic and peroxisomal isoforms diverged early from chloroplastic ones, is proposed.
Plant Cell Environ.	Role of peroxidases in the compensation of cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase knockdown in rice plants under abiotic stress.	2011	Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal do Ceara, Ceara, Brasil.	Current studies, particularly in Arabidopsis, have demonstrated that mutants deficient in cytosolic ascorbate peroxidases (APXs) are susceptible to the oxidative damage induced by abiotic stress. In contrast, we demonstrate here that rice mutants double silenced for cytosolic APXs (APx1/2s) up-regulated other peroxidases, making the mutants able to cope with abiotic stress, such as salt, heat, high light and methyl viologen, similar to non-transformed (NT) plants. The APx1/2s mutants exhibited an altered redox homeostasis, as indicated by increased levels of H(2)O(2) and ascorbate and glutathione redox states. Both mutant and NT plants exhibited similar photosynthesis (CO(2)) assimilation and photochemical efficiency) under both normal and stress conditions. Overall, the antioxidative compensatory mechanism displayed by the mutants was associated with increased expression of OsGpx genes, which resulted in higher glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity in the cytosolic and chloroplastic fractions. The transcript levels of OsCatA and OsCatB and the activities of catalase (CAT) and guaiacol peroxidase (GPOD; type III peroxidases) were also up-regulated. None of the six studied isoforms of OsApx were up-regulated under normal growth conditions. Therefore, the deficiency in cytosolic APXs was effectively compensated for by up-regulation of other peroxidases. We propose that signalling mechanisms triggered in rice mutants could be distinct from those proposed for Arabidopsis.
