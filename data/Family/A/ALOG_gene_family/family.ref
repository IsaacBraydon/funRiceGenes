The ALOG domain genes, named after the Arabidopsis LSH1 and Oryza G1 (ALOG) proteins, have frequently been reported as key developmental regulators in rice and Arabidopsis. However, the investigation of the ALOG gene family is limited. Here, we conducted a genome-wide investigation of the ALOG gene family in rice and six other species. In total, eighty-four ALOG domain genes were identified from the seven species, of which fourteen ALOG domain genes (OsG1/G1Ls) were identified in the rice genome. The fourteen OsG1/G1Ls were unevenly distributed on eight chromosomes, and we found that eight segmental duplications contributed to the expansion of OsG1/G1Ls in the rice genome. The eighty-four ALOG family genes from seven species were classified into six clusters, and the ALOG domain-defined motifs 1, 2, and 3 were highly conserved across species according to the phylogenetic and structural analysis. However, the newly identified motifs 4 and 5 were only present in monocots, indicating a specified function in monocots. Moreover, OsG1/G1Ls exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns. Coexpression analysis suggested that OsG1 integrates OsMADS50 and the downstream MADS-box genes, such as OsMADS1, to regulate the development of rice inflorescence; OsG1L7 potentially associates with OsMADS22 and OsMADS55 to regulate stem elongation. In addition, comparative expression analysis revealed the conserved biological functions of ALOG family genes among rice, maize, and Arabidopsis. These results have shed light on the functional study of ALOG family genes in rice and other plants.
