BMC Plant Biol.	Clustered metallothionein genes are co-regulated in rice and ectopic expression of OsMT1e-P confers multiple abiotic stress tolerance in tobacco via ROS scavenging.	2012	Stress Physiology and Molecular Biology Laboratory, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.	BACKGROUND: Metallothioneins (MT) are low molecular weight, cysteine rich metal binding proteins, found across genera and species, but their function(s) in abiotic stress tolerance are not well documented. RESULTS: We have characterized a rice MT gene, OsMT1e-P, isolated from a subtractive library generated from a stressed salinity tolerant rice genotype, Pokkali. Bioinformatics analysis of the rice genome sequence revealed that this gene belongs to a multigenic family, which consists of 13 genes with 15 protein products. OsMT1e-P is located on chromosome XI, away from the majority of other type I genes that are clustered on chromosome XII. Various members of this MT gene cluster showed a tight co-regulation pattern under several abiotic stresses. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of conserved cysteine residues in OsMT1e-P protein. Salinity stress was found to regulate the transcript abundance of OsMT1e-P in a developmental and organ specific manner. Using transgenic approach, we found a positive correlation between ectopic expression of OsMT1e-P and stress tolerance. Our experiments further suggest ROS scavenging to be the possible mechanism for multiple stress tolerance conferred by OsMT1e-P. CONCLUSION: We present an overview of MTs, describing their gene structure, genome localization and expression patterns under salinity and development in rice. We have found that ectopic expression of OsMT1e-P enhances tolerance towards multiple abiotic stresses in transgenic tobacco and the resultant plants could survive and set viable seeds under saline conditions. Taken together, the experiments presented here have indicated that ectopic expression of OsMT1e-P protects against oxidative stress primarily through efficient scavenging of reactive oxygen species.
Protein J.	Heterologous expression and metal-binding characterization of a type 1 metallothionein isoform (OsMTI-1b) from rice (Oryza sativa).	2013	Department of Agriculture Biotechnology, College of Agriculture, Isfahan University of Technology, 84156-83111 Isfahan, Iran.	Metallothioneins (MTs) are ubiquitous, low molecular mass and cysteine-rich proteins that play important roles in maintaining intracellular metal homeostasis, eliminating metal toxification and protecting the cells against oxidative damages. MTs are able to bind metal ions through the thiol groups of their cysteine residues. Plants have several MT isoforms which are classified into four types based on the arrangement of cysteine residues. In the present study, a rice (Oryza sativa) gene encoding type 1 MT isoform, OsMTI-1b, was inserted in vector pET41a and overexpressed in Escherichia coli as carboxy-terminal extensions of glutathione-S-transferase (GST). The recombinant protein GST-OsMTI-1b was purified using affinity chromatography and its ability to bind with Ni(2+), Cd(2+), Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) ions was analyzed. The results demonstrated that this isoform has ability to bind Ni(2+), Cd(2+) and Zn(2+) ions in vitro, whereas it has no substantial ability to bind Cu(2+) ions. From competitive reaction with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), DTNB, the affinity of metal ions for recombinant form of GST-OsMTI-1b was as follows: Ni(2+)/Cd(2+) &gt; Zn(2+) &gt; Cu(2+).
Gene	A novel MT gene of rice plants is strongly expressed in the node portion of the stem.	1998	Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.	We identified a cDNA encoding a metallothionein (MT)-like protein from a cDNA library of rice endosperm. This cDNA (ricMT) encoded an open reading frame of 80 amino acids, with two cysteine-rich domains at the amino-terminus and carboxy-terminus, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence was homologous to those of class I MT-like proteins. Southern blot analysis revealed that the gene exists at one locus in the rice genome. Northern blot analysis with rice seedlings showed that the transcript level in shoots was elevated by the addition of metal ions, such as Cu, Zn, Cd, Fe, Pb and A1, whereas in roots it was reduced in the presence of metal ions other than copper. The expression level of ricMT in mature rice plants was extremely high in stems relative to leaf blades, leaf sheaths, endosperm and roots. In the first nodes, the yield of the transcript was 150-times higher than that in leaf blades. These results suggest that ricMT protein may play an important role in the metabolism of metal elements in the stem.

Genes Genet. Syst.	DNA variation in the metallothionein genes in wild rice Oryza rufipogon: Relationship between DNA sequence polymorphism, codon bias and gene expression.	2005	Laboratory of Plant Genetics, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Japan.	This study examines the relationship between DNA sequence variation and level of gene expression in four metallothionein genes from wild rice Oryza rufipogon. The nucleotide diversity was 0.0028 to 0.0117 over the entire coding and non-coding region, and it was negatively correlated with gene expression for three type 2 metallothionein genes. In contrast, codon bias and percent of preferred codons correlated positively with gene expression. These results indicate that the intensity of natural selection depends on the level of gene expression, which in turn shapes the level of nucleotide polymorphism. In addition, significant linkage disequilibria were frequent between the metallothionein genes, although significance was not confirmed after multiple test correction. This result suggests that metallothionein genes expressed at different levels are epistatic with respect to fitness, and that gene expression is an important factor determining level of DNA polymorphism.
J. Exp. Bot.	Expression of iron-acquisition-related genes in iron-deficient rice is co-ordinately induced by partially conserved iron-deficiency-responsive elements	2005	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) utilize the iron chelators known as mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs) to acquire iron from the rhizosphere. Synthesis of MAs and uptake of MA-chelated iron are strongly induced under conditions of iron deficiency. Microarray analysis was used to characterize the expression profile of rice in response to iron deficiency at the genomic level. mRNA extracted from iron-deficient or iron-sufficient rice roots or leaves was hybridized to a rice array containing 8987 cDNA clones. An induction ratio of greater than 2.0 in roots was observed for 57 genes, many of which are involved in iron-uptake mechanisms, including every identified or predicted step in the methionine cycle and the biosynthesis of MAs from methionine. Northern analysis confirmed that the expression of genes encoding every step in the methionine cycle is thoroughly induced by iron deficiency in roots, and almost thoroughly induced in leaves. A promoter search revealed that the iron-deficiency-induced genes related to iron uptake possessed sequences homologous to the iron-deficiency-responsive cis-acting elements IDE1 and IDE2 in their promoter regions, at a higher rate than that showing no induction under Fe deficiency. These results suggest that rice genes involved in iron acquisition are co-ordinately regulated by conserved mechanisms in response to iron deficiency, in which IDE-mediated regulation plays a significant role.
Plant Cell	Rice MADS3 Regulates ROS Homeostasis during Late Anther Development.	2011	School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.	The rice (Oryza sativa) floral homeotic C-class gene, MADS3, was previously shown to be required for stamen identity determination during early flower development. Here, we describe a role for MADS3 in regulating late anther development and pollen formation. Consistent with this role, MADS3 is highly expressed in the tapetum and microspores during late anther development, and a newly identified MADS3 mutant allele, mads3-4, displays defective anther walls, aborted microspores, and complete male sterility. During late anther development, mads3-4 exhibits oxidative stress-related phenotypes. Microarray analysis revealed expression level changes in many genes in mads3-4 anthers. Some of these genes encode proteins involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis; among them is MT-1-4b, which encodes a type 1 small Cys-rich and metal binding protein. In vivo and in vitro assays showed that MADS3 is associated with the promoter of MT-1-4b, and recombinant MT-1-4b has superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. Reducing the expression of MT-1-4b causes decreased pollen fertility and an increased level of superoxide anion in transgenic plants. Our findings suggest that MADS3 is a key transcriptional regulator that functions in rice male reproductive development, at least in part, by modulating ROS levels through MT-1-4b.
