The multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP/ABCC) subfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters in plants.	2006	Zurich Basel Plant Science Center, University of Zurich, Plant Biology, Zollikerstrasse 107, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland. markus.klein@botinst.unizh.ch	In many different plant species, genes belonging to the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP, ABCC) subfamily of ABC transporters have been identified. Following the discovery of vacuolar transport systems for xenobiotic or plant-produced conjugated organic anions, plant MRPs were originally proposed to be primarily involved in the vacuolar sequestration of potentially toxic metabolites. Indeed, heterologous expression of different Arabidopsis MRPs in yeast demonstrates their activity as ATP-driven pumps for structurally diverse substrates. Recent analysis of protein-protein interactions and the characterization of knockout mutants in Arabidopsis suggests that apart from transport functions plant MRPs play additional roles including the control of plant transpiration through the stomata. Here, we review and discuss the diverse functions of plant MRP-type ABC transporters and present an organ-related and developmental analysis of the expression of Arabidopsis MRPs using the publicly available full-genome chip data.
Trends Plant Sci.	Plant ABC proteins--a unified nomenclature and updated inventory.	2008	Biomathematics and Bioinformatics Department, Rothamsted Research, Harpenden, AL5 2JQ, UK.	The ABC superfamily comprises both membrane-bound transporters and soluble proteins involved in a broad range of processes, many of which are of considerable agricultural, biotechnological and medical potential. Completion of the Arabidopsis and rice genome sequences has revealed a particularly large and diverse complement of plant ABC proteins in comparison with other organisms. Forward and reverse genetics, together with heterologous expression, have uncovered many novel roles for plant ABC proteins, but this progress has been accompanied by a confusing proliferation of names for plant ABC genes and their products. A consolidated nomenclature will provide much-needed clarity and a framework for future research.
Theor. Appl. Genet.	Characterization of OsMIK in a rice mutant with reduced phytate content reveals an insertion of a rearranged retrotransposon.	2013	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology and Key Laboratory of Nuclear-Agricultural Sciences of the Ministry of Agriculture and Zhejiang Province, Institute of Nuclear Agricultural Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310029, China.	The rice low phytic acid (lpa) mutant Os-lpa-XS110-1(XS-lpa) has ~45 % reduction in seed phytic acid (PA) compared with the wild-type cultivar Xiushui 110. Previously, a single recessive gene mutation was shown to be responsible for the lpa phenotype and was mapped to a region of chromosome 3 near OsMIK (LOC_Os03g52760) and OsIPK1 (LOC_Os03g51610), two genes involved in PA biosynthesis. Here, we report the identification of a large insert in the intron of OsMIK in the XS-lpa mutant. Sequencing of fragments amplified through TAIL-PCRs revealed that the insert was a derivative of the LINE retrotransposon gene LOC_Os03g56910. Further analyses revealed the following characteristics of the insert and its impacts: (1) the inserted sequence of LOC_Os03g56910 was split at its third exon and rejoined inversely, with its 5' and 3' flanking sequences inward and the split third exon segments outward; (2) the LOC_Os03g56910 remained in its original locus in XS-lpa, and the insertion probably resulted from homologous recombination repair of a DNA double strand break; (3) while the OsMIK transcripts of XS-lpa and Xiushui 110 were identical, substantial reductions of the transcript abundance (~87 %) and the protein level (~60 %) were observed in XS-lpa, probably due to increased methylation in its promoter region. The above findings are discussed in the context of plant mutagenesis, epigenetics and lpa breeding.
