FEBS J.	Rice cytosine DNA methyltransferases - gene expression profiling during reproductive development and abiotic stress.	2009	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, India.	DNA methylation affects important developmental processes in both plants and animals. The process of methylation of cytosines at C-5 is catalysed by DNA methyltransferases (MTases), which are highly conserved, both structurally and functionally, in eukaryotes. In this study, we identified and characterized cytosine DNA MTase genes that are activated with the onset of reproductive development in rice. The rice genome (Oryza sativa L. subsp. japonica) encodes a total of 10 genes that contain the highly conserved MTase catalytic domain. These genes have been categorized into subfamilies on the basis of phylogenetic relationships. A microarray-based gene expression profile of all 10 MTases during 22 stages/tissues that included 14 stages of reproductive development and five vegetative tissues together with three stresses, cold, salt and dehydration stress, revealed specific windows of MTase activity during panicle and seed development. The expression of six methylases was specifically/preferentially upregulated with the initiation of floral organs. Significantly, one of the MTases was also activated in young seedlings in response to cold and salt stress. The molecular studies presented here suggest a greater role for these proteins and the epigenetic process in affecting genome activity during reproductive development and stress than was previously anticipated.
Plant J.	Targeted disruption of an orthologue of DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLASE2, OsDRM2, impairs the growth of rice plants by abnormal DNA methylation.	2012	National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki 444-8585, Japan. moritoh@nips.ac.jp	Recent methylome analyses of the entire Arabidopsis thaliana genome using various mutants have provided detailed information about the DNA methylation pattern and its function. However, information about DNA methylation in other plants is limited, partly because of the lack of mutants. To study DNA methylation in rice (Oryza sativa) we applied homologous recombination-mediated gene targeting to generate targeted disruptants of OsDRM2, a rice orthologue of DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLASE 1 and 2 (DRM1/2), which encode DNA methyltransferases responsible for de novo and non-CG methylation in Arabidopsis. Whereas Arabidopsis drm1 drm2 double mutants showed no morphological alterations, targeted disruptants of rice OsDRM2 displayed pleiotropic developmental phenotypes in both vegetative and reproductive stages, including growth defects, semi-dwarfed stature, reductions in tiller number, delayed heading or no heading, abnormal panicle and spikelet morphology, and complete sterility. In these osdrm2 disruptants, a 13.9% decrease in 5-methylcytosine was observed by HPLC analysis. The CG and non-CG methylation levels were reduced in RIRE7/CRR1 retrotransposons, and in 5S rDNA repeats. Associated transcriptional activation was detected in RIRE7/CRR1. Furthermore, de novo methylation by an RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) process involving transgene-derived exogenous small interfering RNA (siRNA) was deficient in osdrm2-disrupted cells. Impaired growth and abnormal DNA methylation of osdrm2 disruptants were restored by the complementation of wild-type OsDRM2 cDNA. Our results suggest that OsDRM2 is responsible for de novo, CG and non-CG methylation in rice genomic sequences, and that DNA methylation regulated by OsDRM2 is essential for proper rice development in both vegetative and reproductive stages.
J. Mol. Biol.	De Novo Methyltransferase, OsDRM2, Interacts with the ATP-dependent RNA helicase, OseIF4A, in Rice.	2013	University School of Biotechnology, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Sector 16C, Dwarka, New Delhi 110078, India.	Domains rearranged methyltransferases (DRMs) are the de novo methyltransferases that regulate cytosine methylation in plants in a manner similar to the animal de novo methyltransferases, DNMT3a and DNMT3b. These enzymes catalyze the establishment of new methylation patterns and are guided to target sites by small RNAs through the process of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). In the current accepted view for RdDM, intricate interactions among transcription factors/chromatin modifying proteins and the large subunits of plant-specific polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V, regulate the 24-nt small interfering RNA guided de novo methylation of cytosines. The RNA-induced silencing complex assembled on Pol-V-transcribed non-coding RNA finally facilitates the recruitment of DRM2 by unknown mechanism/protein interactions to chromatin sites. In an attempt to determine the cellular proteins that specifically interact with DRM2, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using young rice panicles. We report that rice DRM2 interacts with the ATP-dependent RNA helicase, eIF4A. Direct interaction between the two proteins is demonstrated in vivo by bimolecular fluorescence complementation method and in vitro by histidine-pull-down assays. Deletion analysis reveals that interaction between OsDRM2 and OseIF4A is specifically mediated through ubiquitin-associated domain of OsDRM2 while, both domains 1 and 2 of OseIF4A are critical for mediating strong interaction with OsDRM2 in vivo. Interaction between Arabidopsis eIF4AI and eIF4AII with OsDRM2 and nuclear localization of these complexes suggests possible conservation of functional interaction between de novo methyltransferases and the translation initiation factor, eIF4A, in RdDM across plant species.
