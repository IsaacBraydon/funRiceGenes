Plant Mol. Biol.	Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of rice cell cycle genes.	2007	Shandong Key Laboratory of Crop Biology, College of Life Sciences, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, Shandong, 271018, China.	Cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and a number of other proteins control the progression of plant cell cycle. Although extensive studies have revealed the roles of some cell cycle regulators and the underlying mechanisms in Arabidopsis, relatively a small number of cell cycle regulators were functionally analyzed in rice. In this study, we describe 41 regulators in the rice genome. Our results indicate that the rice genome contains a less number of the core cell cycle regulators than the Arabidopsis one does, although the rice genome is much larger than the Arabidopsis one. Eight groups of CDKs similar to those in Arabidopsis were identified in the rice genome through phylogenetic analysis, and the corresponding members in the different groups include E2F, CKI, Rb, CKS and Wee. The structures of the core cell regulators were relatively conserved between the rice and Arabidopsis genomes. Furthermore, the expression of the majority of the core cell cycle genes was spatially regulated, and the most closely related ones showed very similar patterns of expression, suggesting functional redundancy and conservation between the highly similar core cell cycle genes in rice and Arabidopsis. Following auxin or cytokinin treatment, the expression of the core cell cycle genes was either upregulated or downregulated, suggesting that auxin and/or cytokinin may directly regulate the expression of the core cell cycle genes. Our results provide basic information to understand the mechanism of cell cycle regulation and the functions of the rice cell cycle genes.
Plant Physiol.	The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice.	2006	Department of Plant Systems Biology, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology, Ghent University, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.	Kip-related proteins (KRPs) play a major role in the regulation of the plant cell cycle. We report the identification of five putative rice (Oryza sativa) proteins that share characteristic motifs with previously described plant KRPs. To investigate the function of KRPs in rice development, we generated transgenic plants overexpressing the Orysa;KRP1 gene. Phenotypic analysis revealed that overexpressed KRP1 reduced cell production during leaf development. The reduced cell production in the leaf meristem was partly compensated by an increased cell size, demonstrating the existence of a compensatory mechanism in monocot species by which growth rate is less reduced than cell production, through cell expansion. Furthermore, Orysa;KRP1 overexpression dramatically reduced seed filling. Sectioning through the overexpressed KRP1 seeds showed that KRP overproduction disturbed the production of endosperm cells. The decrease in the number of fully formed seeds was accompanied by a drop in the endoreduplication of endosperm cells, pointing toward a role of KRP1 in connecting endocycle with endosperm development. Also, spatial and temporal transcript detection in developing seeds suggests that Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in the exit from the mitotic cell cycle during rice grain formation.
Ann. Bot.	Analyses of phylogeny, evolution, conserved sequences and genome-wide expression of the ICK/KRP family of plant CDK inhibitors.	2011	Department of Biology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The cell cycle is controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CDK inhibitors are major regulators of their activities. The ICK/KRP family of CDK inhibitors has been reported in several plants, with seven members in arabidopsis; however, the phylogenetic relationship among members in different species is unknown. Also, there is a need to understand how these genes and proteins are regulated. Furthermore, little information is available on the functional differences among ICK/KRP family members. METHODS: We searched publicly available databases and identified over 120 unique ICK/KRP protein sequences from more than 60 plant species. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using 101 full-length sequences from 40 species and intron-exon organization of ICK/KRP genes in model species. Conserved sequences and motifs were analysed using ICK/KRP protein sequences from arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa). In addition, gene expression was examined using microarray data from arabidopsis, rice and poplar, and further analysed by RT-PCR for arabidopsis. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Phylogenetic analysis showed that plant ICK/KRP proteins can be grouped into three major classes. Whereas the C-class contains sequences from dicotyledons, monocotyledons and gymnosperms, the A- and B-classes contain only sequences from dicotyledons or monocotyledons, respectively, suggesting that the A- and B-classes might have evolved from the C-class. This classification is also supported by exon-intron organization. Genes in the A- and B- classes have four exons, whereas genes in the C-class have only three exons. Analysis of sequences from arabidopsis, rice and poplar identified conserved sequence motifs, some of which had not been described previously, and putative functional sites. The presence of conserved motifs in different family members is consistent with the classification. In addition, gene expression analysis showed preferential expression of ICK/KRP genes in certain tissues. A model has been proposed for the evolution of this gene family in plants.
Ann. Bot.	Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development.	2011	Institute of Crop Science, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Kaixuan Road 268, Hangzhou, China.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Plants have a family of proteins referred to as ICKs (inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK) or KRPs (Kip-related proteins) that function to regulate the activities of CDK. Knowledge of these plant CDK inhibitors has been gained mostly from studies of selected members in dicotyledonous plants, particularly Arabidopsis. Much remains to be learned regarding the differences among various members of the ICK/KRP family, and regarding the function and regulation of these proteins in monocotyledonous plants. METHODS: We analysed ICK-related sequences in the rice (Orysa sativa L. subsp. indica) genome and determined that there are six members with the conserved C-terminal signature region for ICK/KRP proteins. They are referred to as OsiICKs and further analyses were performed. The interactions with CDKs and cyclins were determined by a yeast two-hybrid assay, and cellular localization by fusion with the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). The expression of OsiICK6 in different tissues and in response to several treatments was analysed by reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR. Furthermore, OsiICK6 was over-expressed in transgenic rice plants and significant phenotypes were observed. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Based on putative protein sequences, the six OsiICKs are grouped into two classes, with OsiICK1 and OsiICK6 in each of the two classes, respectively. Results showed that OsiICK1 and OsiICK6 interacted with OsCYCD, but differed in their interactions with CDKA. Both EGFP:OsiICK1 and EGFP:OsiICK6 were localized in the nucleus. Whereas EGFP:OsiICK6 showed a punctuate subnuclear distribution, OsiICK1 had a homogeneous pattern. Over-expression of OsiICK6 resulted in multiple phenotypic effects on plant growth, morphology, pollen viability and seed setting. In OsiICK6-over-expressing plants, leaves rolled toward the abaxial side, suggesting that cell proliferation is critical in maintaining an even growth along the dorsal-ventral plane of leaf blades.
Journal of Experimental Botany	The syncytium-specific expression of the Orysa;KRP3 CDK inhibitor: Implication of its involvement in the cell cycle control in the rice (Oryza sativa L.) syncytial endosperm	2010	United Graduate School of Agricultural Sciences, Iwate University, 3-18-8, Ueda, Morioka, Iwate 020-8550, Japan.	During rice (Oryza sativa L.) seed development, the primary endosperm nucleus undergoes a series of divisions without cytokinesis, producing a multinucleate cell, known as a syncytium. After several rounds of rapid nuclear proliferation, the syncytium ceases to undergo mitosis; thereafter, the syncytium is partitioned into individual cells by a specific type of cytokinesis called cellularization. The transition between syncytium and cellularization is important in determining the final seed size and is a model for studying the cell cycle and cytokinesis. The involvement of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (CKIs) in cell cycle control was investigated here during the transition between syncytium and cellularization. It was found that one of the rice CKIs, Orysa;KRP3, is strongly expressed in the caryopsis at 2 d after flowering (DAF), and its expression is significantly reduced at 3 DAF. The other CKI transcripts did not show such a shift at 2 DAF. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that Orysa;KRP3 is expressed in multinucleate syncytial endosperm at 2 DAF, but not in cellularized endosperm at 3 DAF. Two-hybrid assays showed that Orysa;KRP3 binds Orysa;CDKA;1, Orysa;CDKA;2, Orysa;CycA1;1, and Orysa;CycD2;2. By contrast, Orysa;CDKB2;1 and Orysa;CycB2;2 do not show binding to Orysa;KRP3. Orysa;KRP3 was able to rescue yeast premature cell division due to the dominant positive expression of mutant rice CDKA;1 indicating that Orysa;KRP3 inhibited rice CDK. These data suggest that Orysa;KRP3 is involved in cell cycle control of syncytial endosperm.
