Plant J.	Structure and expression of the rice class-1 type histone deacetylase genes OsHDAC1-3: OsHDAC1 overexpression in transgenic plants leads to increased growth rate and altered architecture.	2003	Department of Biological Science, Myongji University, Yongin 449-728, Korea.	Histone deacetylases (HDACs) modulate chromatin structure and transcription. HDACs have been studied as negative regulators in eukaryotic transcription. We isolated the rice OsHDAC1-3 genes for class I-type histone deacetylases, which are related to the RPD3 family. The OsHDAC1 gene encoded a protein of approximately 57 kDa that shared 73.5, 72.7, 79.9, and 57.1% amino acid sequence identity with the OsHDAC2, OsHDAC3, maize RPD3, and human HDAC1 proteins, respectively. Genomic structures and Southern blot analyses revealed that OsHDAC1-3 contained seven, six, and seven exons, respectively, and constituted a class I-type family in the rice genome. OsHDAC1 was expressed at similar levels in the leaves, roots, and callus cells, whereas OsHDAC2 and 3 were expressed in the roots and callus cells, but not in the leaves, exhibiting distinct tissue specificity. To explore the role of histone deacetylases in transgenic plants, we inserted the OsHDAC1 cDNA fragment into the expression vector Ai::OsHDAC1 under the control of the ABA-inducible promoter Ai, and transformed the construct into rice. Levels of mRNA, protein, and HDAC activity were significantly increased in Ai::OsHDAC1 callus cells. The amount of tetra-acetylated H4 in the transgenic cells was greatly reduced, and the reduction was abolished upon treatment with trichostatin A. These results demonstrate that OsHDAC1 overexpression in transgenic cells both yields enzymatically active HDAC complexes and induces changes in histone acetylation in vivo. The overexpression leads to a range of novel phenotypes, involving increased growth rate and altered plant architecture, suggesting that OsHDAC1 functions in the genome-wide programming of gene expression.
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.	Rice histone deacetylase genes display specific expression patterns and developmental functions.	2009	National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, 430070 Wuhan, China.	Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are important in plant gene expression. Here we show that the expression of rice HDAC genes is both tissue/organ-specific, and most of them are responsive to drought or salt stresses. Over-expression of several rice HDACs did not produce any visible phenotype, whereas down-regulation of a few HDAC genes affected different developmental aspects. Specifically, down-regulation of HDA703 by amiRNA reduced rice peduncle elongation and fertility, while inactivation of a closely related homolog HDA710 by RNAi affected vegetative growth. HDA704 RNAi altered plant height and flag leaf morphology. Down-regulation of HDT702 led to the production of narrowed leaves and stems. These data suggest that rice HDAC genes may have divergent developmental functions compared with closely related homologs in Arabidopsis.
