Gene	Organ-specific alternative transcripts of KNOX family class 2 homeobox genes of rice.	2002	Plant Genetics Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, 1111 Yata, Mishima, Shizuoka 411-8540, Japan.	We identified three genes (HOS58, HOS59 and HOS66) of rice (Oryza sativa), which encode predicted proteins with the KNOX family class 2 homeodomain. These proteins contain three conserved domains, the KNOX domain, ELK domain and homeodomain, from an N-terminus to a C-terminus. In addition to similarity of predicted amino acid sequences, these genes showed a similar exon/intron structure. cDNA cloning and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of these genes indicated tissue-specific expression of alternative transcripts. The expression of the longer mRNAs of HOS58 (HOS58L) and HOS59L was detected in all organs examined such as roots, leaf blades, leaf sheaths, flowers and calli, whereas the shorter mRNAs of HOS58 (HOS58S) and HOS59S were expressed in leaf blades, leaf sheaths and flowers. The expression of HOS66L was detected in roots, leaf blades, leaf sheaths and flowers, whereas the expression of HOS66S was detected in roots and flowers. The alternative transcripts of HOS66 arose by use of alternative transcription start sites. The longer transcripts contained an exon 1 which encodes an alanine/glycine-rich region, whereas the shorter ones lacked it. These results suggest that the expression of the alternative transcripts is organ-specific, and their products have different degrees of abilities for activation or repression of transcription.

Genome-wide identification, classification, evolutionary expansion and expression analyses of homeobox genes in rice.	2008	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, India.	Homeobox genes play a critical role in regulating various aspects of plant growth and development. In the present study, we identified a total of 107 homeobox genes in the rice genome and grouped them into ten distinct subfamilies based upon their domain composition and phylogenetic analysis. A significantly large number of homeobox genes are located in the duplicated segments of the rice genome, which suggests that the expansion of homeobox gene family, in large part, might have occurred due to segmental duplications in rice. Furthermore, microarray analysis was performed to elucidate the expression profiles of these genes in different tissues and during various stages of vegetative and reproductive development. Several genes with predominant expression during various stages of panicle and seed development were identified. At least 37 homeobox genes were found to be differentially expressed significantly (more than two-fold; P &lt; 0.05) under various abiotic stress conditions. The results of the study suggest a critical role of homeobox genes in reproductive development and abiotic stress signaling in rice, and will facilitate the selection of candidate genes of agronomic importance for functional validation.
