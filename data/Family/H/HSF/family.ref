J Zhejiang Univ Sci B	Identification and expression analysis of OsHsfs in rice.	2009	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Heat stress transcription factors (Hsfs) are the central regulators of defense response to heat stress. We identified a total of 25 rice Hsf genes by genome-wide analysis of rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome, including the subspecies of O. japonica and O. indica. Proteins encoded by OsHsfs were divided into three classes according to their structures. Digital Northern analysis showed that OsHsfs were expressed constitutively. The expressions of these OsHsfs in response to heat stress and oxidative stress differed among the members of the gene family. Promoter analysis identified a number of stress-related cis-elements in the promoter regions of these OsHsfs. No significant correlation, however, was found between the heat-shock responses of genes and their cis-elements. Overall, our results provide a foundation for future research of OsHsfs function.

Genomics	Heat shock factors in rice (Oryza sativa L.): genome-wide expression analysis during reproductive development and abiotic stress.	2011	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi, South Campus, Benito Juarez Road, Dhaula Kuan, New Delhi 110 021, India.	Plants respond to heat stress by enhancing the expression of genes encoding heat shock protein (HSPs) genes through activation of heat shock factors (HSFs) which interact with heat shock elements present in the promoter of HSP genes. Plant HSFs have been divided into three conserved classes viz A, B and C. In the present study, a detailed analysis has been done of all rice HSFs, along with their spliced variants. Their chromosomal localization reveals that six HSFs are segmentally duplicated and four pairs of these segmentally duplicated HSF encoding genes show pseudo-functionalization. Expression profiling through microarray and quantitative real-time PCR showed that eight OsHsfs express at a higher level during seed development, while six HSFs are up-regulated in all the abiotic stresses studied. The expression of OsHsfA2a gene in particular was greatly stimulated by heat stress in both root and shoot tissues and also during panicle and seed development. OsHsfA3 was found more responsive to cold and drought stress, while OsHsfA7 and OsHsfA9 showed developing seed-specific expression. This study also revealed that spliced variants generally accumulated at a higher level in all the tissues examined. Different hormones/elicitors like ABA, brassinosteroids and salicylic acid also alter OsHsf gene expression. Calcium in combination with heat stress elevated further the level of HSF transcripts. Expression analysis by both microarray and real-time RT-PCR revealed a unique stable constitutive expression of OsHsfA1 across all the tissues and stresses. A detailed in silico analysis involving identification of unidentified domains has been done by MEME-motif tool in their full-length proteins as well as in DNA-binding domains. Analysis of 1 kb putative promoter region revealed presence of tissue-specific, abiotic stress and hormone-related cis-acting elements, correlating with expression under stress conditions.
FEBS J.	Binding affinities and interactions among different heat shock element types and heat shock factors in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, India.	Binding of heat shock factors (Hsfs) to heat shock elements (HSEs) leads to transcriptional regulation of heat shock genes. Genome-wide, 953 rice genes contain perfect-type, 695 genes gap-type and 1584 genes step-type HSE sequences in their 1-kb promoter region. The rice genome contains 13 class A, eight class B and four class C Hsfs (OsHsfs) and has OsHsf26 (which is of variant type) genes. Chemical cross-linking analysis of in vitro synthesized OsHsf polypeptides showed formation of homotrimers of OsHsfA2c, OsHsfA9 and OsHsfB4b proteins. Binding analysis of polypeptides with oligonucleotide probes containing perfect-, gap-, and step-type HSE sequences showed that OsHsfA2c, OsHsfA9 and OsHsfB4b differentially recognize various model HSEs as a function of varying reaction temperatures. The homomeric form of OsHsfA2c and OsHsfB4b proteins was further noted by the bimolecular fluorescence complementation approach in onion epidermal cells. In yeast two-hybrid assays, OsHsfB4b showed homomeric interaction as well as distinct heteromeric interactions with OsHsfA2a, OsHsfA7, OsHsfB4c and OsHsf26. Transactivation activity was noted in OsHsfA2c, OsHsfA2d, OsHsfA9, OsHsfC1a and OsHsfC1b in yeast cells. These differential patterns pertaining to binding with HSEs and protein-protein interactions may have a bearing on the cellular functioning of OsHsfs under a range of different physiological and environmental conditions.
Plant Sci.	Gene expression analysis in response to low and high temperature and oxidative stresses in rice: combination of stresses evokes different transcriptional changes as against stresses applied individually.	2012	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.	Transcript expression profiles of rice seedlings were analyzed in response to (a) prior exposure with oxidative stress followed by heat or cold stress and (b) simultaneous exposure to oxidative stress along with heat stress or cold stress. The numbers of genes differentially regulated during stress combination of cold and oxidative stress as well as heat and oxidative stress treatments were higher when compared with the number of genes differentially regulated in response to individual stress conditions. A large number of transcript changes were noted unique to the stress combination mode as compared with when individual stresses were applied. Specific differences in the transcript expression profiles of OsHsf and OsClp gene family members were noted during combination of stresses as against individual stresses. For instance, OsHsf26 induction was specific to stress combinations, while OsHsfA2a, OsHsfA2f, and OsHsfA3 transcript levels were additively affected during combination of stresses. Unique promoter models and transcription factor binding sites (i.e. P$KNOX3_01, P$OSBZ8_Q6) were noted in the promoters of differentially regulated genes during combination of stresses. It is proposed that stress combinations represent a novel state of abiotic stresses for rice seedlings that might involve a different type of molecular response.

AoB Plants	Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica.	2012	Institute of Biochemistry and Biology , University of Potsdam , Karl-Liebknecht-Str. 24-25, 14476 Potsdam , Germany.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Salt stress leads to attenuated growth and productivity in rice. Transcription factors like heat shock factors (HSFs) represent central regulators of stress adaptation. Heat shock factors of the classes A and B are well established as regulators of thermal and non-thermal stress responses in plants; however, the role of class C HSFs is unknown. Here we characterized the function of the OsHsfC1b (Os01g53220) transcription factor from rice. METHODOLOGY: We analysed the expression of OsHsfC1b in the rice japonica cultivars Dongjin and Nipponbare exposed to salt stress as well as after mannitol, abscisic acid (ABA) and H(2)O(2) treatment. For functional characterization of OsHsfC1b, we analysed the physiological response of a T-DNA insertion line (hsfc1b) and two artificial micro-RNA (amiRNA) knock-down lines to salt, mannitol and ABA treatment. In addition, we quantified the expression of small Heat Shock Protein (sHSP) genes and those related to signalling and ion homeostasis by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in roots exposed to salt. The subcellular localization of OsHsfC1b protein fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) was determined in Arabidopsis mesophyll cell protoplasts. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Expression of OsHsfC1b was induced by salt, mannitol and ABA, but not by H(2)O(2). Impaired function of OsHsfC1b in the hsfc1b mutant and the amiRNA lines led to decreased salt and osmotic stress tolerance, increased sensitivity to ABA, and temporal misregulation of salt-responsive genes involved in signalling and ion homeostasis. Furthermore, sHSP genes showed enhanced expression in knock-down plants under salt stress. We observed retarded growth of hsfc1b and knock-down lines in comparison with control plants under non-stress conditions. Transient expression of OsHsfC1b fused to GFP in protoplasts revealed nuclear localization of the transcription factor. CONCLUSIONS: OsHsfC1b plays a role in ABA-mediated salt stress tolerance in rice. Furthermore, OsHsfC1b is involved in the response to osmotic stress and is required for plant growth under non-stress conditions.
