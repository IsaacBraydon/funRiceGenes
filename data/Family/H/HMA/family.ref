Plant Signal Behav	The role of heavy-metal ATPases, HMAs, in zinc and cadmium transport in rice.	2012	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.	The P(1B)-type heavy metal ATPases (HMAs) are diverse in terms of tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and metal specificity. Functional studies of HMAs have shown that these transporters can be divided into two subgroups based on their metal-substrate specificity: a copper (Cu)/silver (Ag) group and a zinc (Zn)/cobalt (Co)/cadmium (Cd)/lead (Pb) group. Studies on Arabidopsis thaliana and metal hyperaccumulator plants indicate that HMAs play an important role in the translocation or detoxification of Zn and Cd in plants. Rice possesses nine HMA genes, of which OsHMA1-OsHMA3 belong to the Zn/Co/Cd/Pb subgroup. OsHMA2 plays an important role in root-to-shoot translocation of Zn and Cd, and participates in Zn and Cd transport to developing seeds in rice. OsHMA3 transports Cd and plays a role in the sequestration of Cd into vacuoles in root cells. Modification of the expression of these genes might be an effective approach for reducing the Cd concentration in rice grains.
Plant Physiol.	Genomic comparison of P-type ATPase ion pumps in Arabidopsis and rice.	2003	Department of Cell Biology, Plant Division, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.	Members of the P-type ATPase ion pump superfamily are found in all three branches of life. Forty-six P-type ATPase genes were identified in Arabidopsis, the largest number yet identified in any organism. The recent completion of two draft sequences of the rice (Oryza sativa) genome allows for comparison of the full complement of P-type ATPases in two different plant species. Here, we identify a similar number (43) in rice, despite the rice genome being more than three times the size of Arabidopsis. The similarly large families suggest that both dicots and monocots have evolved with a large preexisting repertoire of P-type ATPases. Both Arabidopsis and rice have representative members in all five major subfamilies of P-type ATPases: heavy-metal ATPases (P1B), Ca2+-ATPases (endoplasmic reticulum-type Ca2+-ATPase and autoinhibited Ca2+-ATPase, P2A and P2B), H+-ATPases (autoinhibited H+-ATPase, P3A), putative aminophospholipid ATPases (ALA, P4), and a branch with unknown specificity (P5). The close pairing of similar isoforms in rice and Arabidopsis suggests potential orthologous relationships for all 43 rice P-type ATPases. A phylogenetic comparison of protein sequences and intron positions indicates that the common angiosperm ancestor had at least 23 P-type ATPases. Although little is known about unique and common features of related pumps, clear differences between some members of the calcium pumps indicate that evolutionarily conserved clusters may distinguish pumps with either different subcellular locations or biochemical functions.
Plant Physiol.	Rice P1B-type heavy-metal ATPase, OsHMA9, is a metal efflux protein.	2007	Division of Molecular and Life Science, Biotechnology Research Center, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang 790-784, Korea.	P(1B)-type heavy-metal ATPases (HMAs) are transmembrane metal-transporting proteins that play a key role in metal homeostasis. Despite their importance, very little is known about their functions in monocot species. We report the characterization of rice (Oryza sativa) OsHMA9, a member of the P(1B)-type ATPase family. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of seedlings showed that OsHMA9 expression was induced by a high concentration of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and cadmium. We also determined, through promoterbeta-glucuronidase analysis, that the main expression was in the vascular bundles and anthers. The OsHMA9:green fluorescence protein fusion was localized to the plasma membrane. Heterologous expression of OsHMA9 partially rescued the Cu sensitivity of the Escherichia coli copA mutant, which is defective in Cu-transporting ATPases. It did not rescue the Zn sensitivity of the zntA mutant, which is defective in Zn-transporting ATPase. To further elucidate the functional roles of OsHMA9, we isolated two independent null alleles, oshma9-1 and oshma9-2, from the T-DNA insertion population. Mutant plants exhibited the phenotype of increased sensitivity to elevated levels of Cu, Zn, and lead. These results support a role for OsHMA9 in Cu, Zn, and lead efflux from the cells. This article is the first report on the functional characterization of a P(1B)-type metal efflux transporter in monocots.
