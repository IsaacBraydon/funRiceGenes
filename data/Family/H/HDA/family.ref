Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are important in plant gene expression. Here we show that the expression of rice HDAC genes is both tissue/organ-specific, and most of them are responsive to drought or salt stresses. Over-expression of several rice HDACs did not produce any visible phenotype, whereas down-regulation of a few HDAC genes affected different developmental aspects. Specifically, down-regulation of HDA703 by amiRNA reduced rice peduncle elongation and fertility, while inactivation of a closely related homolog HDA710 by RNAi affected vegetative growth. HDA704 RNAi altered plant height and flag leaf morphology. Down-regulation of HDT702 led to the production of narrowed leaves and stems. These data suggest that rice HDAC genes may have divergent developmental functions compared with closely related homologs in Arabidopsis.
Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Sequence and expression analysis of histone deacetylases in rice.	2007	South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510650, China.	Histone acetylation levels are determined by the action of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Sequence similarity and profile searching tools were used to analyze the genome sequence of rice (Oryzae sativa) for genes encoding HDAC proteins. The rice RPD3/HDA1-family HDAC proteins can be divided into four classes based on sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis of sequences obtained from the rice genome. The spatial expression pattern of rice HDACs genes indicated that some HDAC genes have different expression profiles. Furthermore, our analysis indicated that expression of HDA705, HDT701, and HDT702 could be affected by salicylic acid, jasmonic acid or abscisic acid. Expression of HDA714, SRT702, and SRT701 could be modulated by abiotic stresses, such as cold, mannitol and salt. These results indicate that different HDAC genes have distinct expression patterns and members of rice HDAC families may be involved in plant response to environmental stresses.
