J Genet Genomics	Molecular evolution and functional divergence of HAK potassium transporter gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2009	Jiangsu Provincial Key laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology, Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics of Ministry of Education, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.	The high-affinity K(+) (HAK) transporter gene family is the largest family in plant that functions as potassium transporter and is important for various aspects of plant life. In the present study, we identified 27 members of this family in rice genome. The phylogenetic tree divided the land plant HAK transporter proteins into 6 distinct groups. Although the main characteristic of this family was established before the origin of seed plants, they also showed some differences between the members of non-seed and seed plants. The HAK genes in rice were found to have expanded in lineage-specific manner after the split of monocots and dicots, and both segmental duplication events and tandem duplication events contributed to the expansion of this family. Functional divergence analysis for this family provided statistical evidence for shifted evolutionary rate after gene duplication. Further analysis indicated that both point mutant with positive selection and gene conversion events contributed to the evolution of this family in rice.
Theor. Appl. Genet.	Targeted association analysis identified japonica rice varieties achieving Na(+)/K (+) homeostasis without the allelic make-up of the salt tolerant indica variety Nona Bokra.	2011	CIRAD, UPR AIVA, 34398 Montpellier, France. Nourollah.ahmadi@cirad.fr	During the last decade, a large number of QTLs and candidate genes for rice tolerance to salinity have been reported. Using 124 SNP and 52 SSR markers, we targeted 14 QTLs and 65 candidate genes for association mapping within the European Rice Core collection (ERCC) comprising 180 japonica accessions. Significant differences in phenotypic response to salinity were observed. Nineteen distinct loci significantly associated with one or more phenotypic response traits were detected. Linkage disequilibrium between these loci was extremely low, indicating a random distribution of favourable alleles in the ERCC. Analysis of the function of these loci indicated that all major tolerance mechanisms were present in the ERCC although the useful level of expression of the different mechanisms was scattered among different accessions. Under moderate salinity stress some accessions achieved the same level of control of Na(+) concentration and Na(+)/K(+) equilibrium as the indica reference variety for salinity tolerance Nona Bokra, although without sharing the same alleles at several loci associated with Na(+) concentration. This suggests (a) differences between indica and japonica subspecies in the effect of QTLs and genes involved in salinity tolerance and (b) further potential for the improvement of tolerance to salinity above the tolerance level of Nona Bokra, provided the underlying mechanisms are complementary at the whole plant level. No accession carried all favourable alleles, or showed the best phenotypic responses for all traits measured. At least nine accessions were needed to assemble the favourable alleles and all the best phenotypic responses. An effective strategy for the accumulation of the favourable alleles would be marker-assisted population improvement.
PLoS ONE	Comparison of ion balance and nitrogen metabolism in old and young leaves of alkali-stressed rice plants.	2012	Key laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of MOE, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, Jilin Province, China.	BACKGROUND: Alkali stress is an important agricultural contaminant and has complex effects on plant metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the alkali stress has different effects on the growth, ion balance, and nitrogen metabolism in old and young leaves of rice plants, and to compare functions of both organs in alkali tolerance. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The results showed that alkali stress only produced a small effect on the growth of young leaves, whereas strongly damaged old leaves. Rice protected young leaves from ion harm via the large accumulation of Na(+) and Cl(-) in old leaves. The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsAKT1, OsHAK1, OsHAK7, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 may contribute to the larger accumulation of Na(+) in old leaves under alkali stress. Alkali stress mightily reduced the NO(3)(-) contents in both organs. As old leaf cells have larger vacuole, under alkali stress these scarce NO(3)(-) was principally stored in old leaves. Accordingly, the expression of OsNRT1;1 and OsNRT1;2 in old leaves was up-regulated by alkali stress, revealing that the two genes might contribute to the accumulation of NO(3)(-) in old leaves. NO(3)(-) deficiency in young leaves under alkali stress might induce the reduction in OsNR1 expression and the subsequent lacking of NH(4)(+), which might be main reason for the larger down-regulation of OsFd-GOGAT and OsGS2 in young leaves. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results strongly indicated that, during adaptation of rice to alkali stress, young and old leaves have distinct mechanisms of ion balance and nitrogen metabolism regulation. We propose that the comparative studies of young and old tissues may be important for abiotic stress tolerance research.
Plant Physiol.	Inventory and functional characterization of the HAK potassium transporters of rice.	2002	Departamento de Biotecnologia, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.	Plants take up large amounts of K(+) from the soil solution and distribute it to the cells of all organs, where it fulfills important physiological functions. Transport of K(+) from the soil solution to its final destination is mediated by channels and transporters. To better understand K(+) movements in plants, we intended to characterize the function of the large KT-HAK-KUP family of transporters in rice (Oryza sativa cv Nipponbare). By searching in databases and cDNA cloning, we have identified 17 genes (OsHAK1-17) encoding transporters of this family and obtained evidence of the existence of other two genes. Phylogenetic analysis of the encoded transporters reveals a great diversity among them, and three distant transporters, OsHAK1, OsHAK7, and OsHAK10, were expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and bacterial mutants to determine their functions. The three transporters mediate K(+) influxes or effluxes, depending on the conditions of the experiment. A comparative kinetic analysis of HAK-mediated K(+) influx in yeast and in roots of K(+)-starved rice seedlings demonstrated the involvement of HAK transporters in root K(+) uptake. We discuss that all HAK transporters may mediate K(+) transport, but probably not only in the plasma membrane. Transient expression of the OsHAK10-green fluorescent protein fusion protein in living onion epidermal cells targeted this protein to the tonoplast.
J. Biosci. Bioeng.	Rice sodium-insensitive potassium transporter, OsHAK5, confers increased salt tolerance in tobacco BY2 cells.	2011	Group of Molecular and Functional Plant Biology, Research Institute for Bioresources, Okayama University, Kurashiki, Okayama 710-0046, Japan.	Potassium ion (K(+)) plays vital roles in many aspects of cellular homeostasis including competing with sodium ion (Na(+)) during potassium starvation and salt stress. Therefore, one way to engineer plant cells with improved salt tolerance is to enhance K(+) uptake activity of the cells, while keeping Na(+) out during salt stress. Here, in search for Na(+)-insensitive K(+) transporter for this purpose, bacterial expression system was used to characterize two K(+) transporters, OsHAK2 and OsHAK5, isolated from rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare). The two OsHAK transporters are members of a KT/HAK/KUP transporter family, which is one of the major K(+) transporter families in bacteria, fungi and plants. When expressed in an Escherichia coli K(+) transport mutant strain LB2003, both OsHAK transporters rescued the growth defect in K(+)-limiting conditions by significantly increasing the K(+) content of the cells. Under the condition with a large amount of extracellular Na(+), we found that OsHAK5 functions as a Na(+)-insensitive K(+) transporter, while OsHAK2 is sensitive to extracellular Na(+) and exhibits higher Na(+) over K(+) transport activities. Moreover, constitutive expression of OsHAK5 in cultured-tobacco BY2 (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Bright Yellow 2) cells enhanced the accumulation of K(+) but not Na(+) in the cells during salt stress and conferred increased salt tolerance to the cells. Transient expression experiment indicated that OsHAK5 is localized to the plant plasma membrane. These results suggest that the plasma-membrane localized Na(+) insensitive K(+) transporters, similar to OsHAK5 identified here, could be used as a tool to enhance salt tolerance in plant cells.

Cell Res	Genome-wide analysis of the phospholipase D family in Oryza sativa and functional characterization of PLD beta 1 in seed germination.	2007	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 300 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, China.	Phospholipase D (PLD) plays a critical role in plant growth and development, as well as in hormone and stress responses. PLD encoding genes constitute a large gene family that are present in higher plants. There are 12 members of the PLD family in Arabidopsis thaliana and several of them have been functionally characterized; however, the members of the PLD family in Oryza sativa remain to be fully described. Through genome-wide analysis, 17 PLD members found in different chromosomes have been identified in rice. Protein domain structural analysis reveals a novel subfamily, besides the C2-PLDs and PXPH-PLDs, that is present in rice - the SP-PLD. SP-PLD harbors a signal peptide instead of the C2 or PXPH domains at the N-terminus. Expression pattern analysis indicates that most PLD-encoding genes are differentially expressed in various tissues, or are induced by hormones or stress conditions, suggesting the involvement of PLD in multiple developmental processes. Transgenic studies have shown that the suppressed expression of rice PLD beta 1 results in reduced sensitivity to exogenous ABA during seed germination. Further analysis of the expression of ABA signaling-related genes has revealed that PLD beta 1 stimulates ABA signaling by activating SAPK, thus repressing GAmyb expression and inhibiting seed germination.
