Plant Cell Environ.	Heat shock-induced biphasic Ca(2+) signature and OsCaM1-1 nuclear localization mediate downstream signalling in acquisition of thermotolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Institute of Plant Biology &amp; Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.	We investigated heat shock (HS)-triggered Ca(2+) signalling transduced by a Ca(2+) sensor, calmodulin (CaM), linked to early transcriptome changes of HS-responsive genes in rice. We observed a biphasic [Ca(2+) ](cyt) signature in root cells that was distinct from that in epicotyl and leaf cells, which showed a monophasic response after HS. Treatment with Ca(2+) and A23187 generated an intense and sustained increase in [Ca(2+) ](cyt) in response to HS. Conversely, treatment with Ca(2+) chelator, L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker and CaM antagonist, but not intracellular Ca(2+) release inhibitor, strongly inhibited the increased [Ca(2+) ](cyt) . HS combined with Ca(2+) and A23187 accelerated the expression of OsCaM1-1 and sHSPC/N genes, which suggests that the HS-induced apoplastic Ca(2+) influx is responsible for the [Ca(2+) ](cyt) response and downstream HS signalling. In addition, the biphasic response of OsCaM1-1 in the nucleus followed the Ca(2+) signature, which may provide the information necessary to direct HS-related gene expression. Overexpression of OsCaM1-1 induced the expression of Ca(2+) /HS-related AtCBK3, AtPP7, AtHSF and AtHSP at a non-inducing temperature and enhanced intrinsic thermotolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis. Therefore, HS-triggered rapid increases in [Ca(2+) ](cyt) , together with OsCaM1-1 expression and its nuclear localization, are important in mediating downstream HS-related gene expression for the acquisition of thermotolerance in rice.
Plant Mol. Biol.	Characterization of the genomic structures and selective expression profiles of nine class I small heat shock protein genes clustered on two chromosomes in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2004	Institute of Plant Biology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan, ROC.	The cytosolic class I small heat shock proteins (sHSP-CI) represent the most abundant sHSP in plants. Here, we report the characterization and the expression profile of nine members of the sHSP-CI gene family in rice (Oryza sativa Tainung No.67), of which Oshsp16.9A, Oshsp16.9B, Oshsp16.9C, Oshsp16.9D and Oshsp17.9B are clustered on chromosome 1, and Oshsp17.3, Oshsp17.7, Oshsp17.9A and Oshsp18.0 are clustered on chromosome 3. Oshsp17.3 and Oshsp18.0 are linked by a 356-bp putative bi-directional promoter. Individual gene products were identified from the protein subunits of a heat shock complex (HSC) and from in vitro transcription/ translation products by two-dimensional gel electrophoreses (2-DE). All sHSP-CI genes except Oshsp17.9B were induced strongly after a 2-h heat shock treatment. The genes on chromosome 3 were induced rapidly at 32 and 41 degrees C, whereas those on chromosome 1 were induced slowly by similar conditions. Seven of these genes, except Oshsp16.9D and Oshsp17.9B, were induced by arsenite (As), but only genes on chromosome 3 were strongly induced by azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (Aze, a proline analog) and cadmium (Cd). A similar expression profile of all sHSP-CI genes at a lower level was evoked by ethanol, H2O2 and CuCl2 treatments. Transient expression assays of the promoter activity by linking to GUS reporter gene also supported the in vivo selective expression of the sHSP-CI genes by Aze treatment indicating the differential induction of rice sHSP-CI genes is most likely regulated at the transcriptional level. Only Oshsp16.9A abundantly accumulated in mature dry seed also suggested additionally prominent roles played by this HSP in development.

J. Plant Physiol.	Expression analysis of nine rice heat shock protein genes under abiotic stresses  and ABA treatment.	2009	Crop Gene Engineering Key Laboratory of Hunan Province, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha 410128, China; College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha 410128, China.	Expression profiles of nine rice heat shock protein genes (OsHSPs) were analyzed by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The nine genes exhibited distinctive expression in different organs. Expression of nine OsHSP genes was affected differentially by abiotic stresses and abscisic acid (ABA). All nine OsHSP genes were induced strongly by heat shock treatment, whereas none of them were induced by cold. The transcripts of OsHSP80.2, OsHSP71.1 and OsHSP23.7 were increased during salt tress treatment. Expression of OsHSP80.2 and OsHSP24.1 genes were enhanced while treated with 10% PEG. Only OsHSP71.1 was induced by ABA while OsHSP24.1 was suppressed by ABA. These observations imply that the nine OsHSP genes may play different roles in plant development and abiotic stress responses.
Genome	Genome-wide identification, evolutionary and expression analyses of putative Fe-S biogenesis genes in rice (Oryza sativa).	2012	Department of Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, College of Agriculture, Indira Gandhi Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya, Krishak Nagar - 492 012 Raipur (CG), India. kesawatbsmahi@gmail.com	Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins are ubiquitous in nature and carry Fe-S clusters (ISCs) as prosthetic groups that are essential in maintaining basic biological processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, nitrogen fixation, and DNA repair. In the present investigation, a comprehensive genome-wide analysis was carried out to find all the genes involved in the formation of ISCs in rice ( Oryza sativa L.) through a systematic EST and genomic DNA sequence data mining. This analysis profiled 44 rice ISC genes (OsISCs) that were identified using in silico analysis. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis revealed that these genes were highly conserved among bacteria, fungi, animals, and plants. EST analysis and RT-PCR assays demonstrated that all OsISCs were active and that the transcript abundance of some OsISCs was tissue specific. The results of this study will assist further investigations to identify and elucidate the structural components involved in the assembly, biogenesis, and regulation of OsISCs. Thus, the outcome of the present study provides basic genomic information for the OsISC and will pave the way for elucidating the precise role of OsISCs in plant growth and development in the future. Also, it may enable us in the future to enhance the crop yield, uptake of Fe, and protection against abiotic and biotic stress.
J. Plant Physiol.	Rice chloroplast-localized heat shock protein 70, OsHsp70CP1, is essential for chloroplast development under high-temperature conditions.	2013	Crop Biotech Institute &amp; Department of Genetic Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 446-701, Republic of Korea.	Heat is a primary abiotic stress that reduces crop yields. At the seedling stage, we identified heat-sensitive mutants that carried T-DNA inserted into a heat shock protein 70 gene, OsHsp70CP1. When grown under a constant high temperature (40 degrees C), the seedling leaves developed severe chlorosis whereas plants grown at a constant 27 degrees C showed a normal phenotype. This indicated that OsHsp70CP1 is essential for chloroplast differentiation from the proplastids under high temperatures. Transient expression analyses revealed that OsHsp70CP1 was localized to the stroma. OsHsp70CP1 was dominantly expressed in photosynthetic tissues; transcripts were greatly increased by heat stress. Some transcripts for plastid RNA metabolism were impaired in the mutant while others were not, demonstrating that a subset of nuclear-encoded proteins are substrates of OsHsp70CP1.
