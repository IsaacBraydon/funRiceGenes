Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.	A new hemoglobin gene from soybean: a role for hemoglobin in all plants.	1996	Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization Plant Industry, Canberra, Australia.	We have isolated a new hemoglobin gene from soybean. It is expressed in cotyledons, stems of seedlings, roots, young leaves, and in some cells in the nodules that are associated with the nitrogen-fixing Bradyrhizobium symbiont. This contrasts with the expression of the leghemoglobins, which are active only in the infected cells of the nodules. The deduced protein sequence of the new gene shows only 58% similarity to one of the soybean leghemoglobins, but 85-87% similarity to hemoglobins from the nonlegumes Parasponia, Casuarina, and barley. The pattern of expression and the gene sequence indicate that this new gene is a nonsymbiotic legume hemoglobin. The finding of this gene in legumes and similar genes in other species strengthens our previous suggestion that genomes of all plants contain hemoglobin genes. The specialized leghemoglobin gene family may have arisen from a preexisting nonsymbiotic hemoglobin by gene duplication.

Biochemistry	Hydroxylamine reduction to ammonium by plant and cyanobacterial hemoglobins.	2011	Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Molecular Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa 50011, United States.	Plants often face hypoxic stress as a result of flooding and waterlogged soils. During these periods, they must continue ATP production and nitrogen metabolism if they are to survive. The normal pathway of reductive nitrogen assimilation in non-legumes, nitrate, and nitrite reductase can be inhibited during low oxygen conditions that are associated with the buildup of toxic metabolites such as nitrite and nitric oxide, so the plant must also have a means of detoxifying these molecules. Compared to animal hemoglobins, plant and cyanobacterial hemoglobins are adept at reducing nitrite to nitric oxide under anaerobic conditions. Here we test their abilities to reduce hydroxylamine, a proposed intermediate of nitrite reductase, under anaerobic conditions. We find that class 1 rice nonsymbiotic hemoglobin (rice nsHb1) and the hemoglobin from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis (SynHb) catalyze the reduction of hydroxylamine to ammonium at rates 100-2500 times faster than animal hemoglobins including myoglobin, neuroglobin, cytoglobin, and blood cell hemoglobin. These results support the hypothesis that plant and cyanobacterial hemoglobins contribute to anaerobic nitrogen metabolism in support of anaerobic respiration and survival during hypoxia.
J. Exp. Bot.	Activation of the Oryza sativa non-symbiotic haemoglobin-2 promoter by the cytokinin-regulated transcription factor, ARR1.	2004	Department of Biochemistry and Plant Science Initiative, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska 68588, USA. eross2@unl.edu	Using in silico methods, several putative phytohormone-responsive cis-elements in the Oryza sativa non-symbiotic haemoglobin (NSHB) 1-4 and Arabidopsis thaliana NSHB1-2 promoters have been identified. An OsNSHB2 promoter::GUS reporter gene fusion shows tissue-specific expression in A. thaliana. GUS expression was observed in roots, the vasculature of young leaves, in flowers, and in the pedicel/stem junction. In transient assays, activity of the OsNSHB2 promoter was significantly up-regulated in the presence of the cytokinin, 6-benzylaminopurine (BA). Deletion analyses indicated that the full-length promoter was required for maximal trans-activation in the presence of cytokinin. Mutation of the single cytokinin-regulated ARR1-binding element abolished promoter activation in response to cytokinin. Constitutive expression of ARR1 under the control of the 35S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter enhanced wild-type OsNSHB2 promoter activity, but had no effect on the activity of the mutated promoter in the absence of cytokinin. However, overexpression of ARR1 in the presence of cytokinin resulted in super-activation of the wild-type promoter. The mutated promoter was only moderately activated in the presence of cytokinin and ARR1, indicating that the OsNSHB2 promoter can be regulated by the ARR1 protein, but requires other cytokinin-induced factors for optimal activation. This is the first report that identifies a trans-acting factor involved in the activation of a NSHB gene.
Plant Physiol.	Rice hemoglobins. Gene cloning, analysis, and O2-binding kinetics of a recombinant protein synthesized in Escherichia coli.	1997	Department of Biochemistry, University of Nebraska, Beadle Center, Lincoln 68588-0664, USA. ra@unlinfo.unl.edu	Although nonsymbiotic hemoglobins (Hbs) are found in different tissues of dicots and monocots, very little is known about hb genes in monocots and the function of Hbs in nonsymbiotic tissues. We report the cloning and analysis of two rice (Oryza sativa L.) hb genes, hb1 and hb2, that code for plant Hbs. Rice hb1 and hb2 genes contain four exons and three introns, as with all of the known plant hb genes. At least three copies of the hb gene were detected in rice DNA, and analysis of gene expression shows that hb1 and hb2 are expressed in leaves but only hb1 is expressed in roots. A cDNA for rice Hb1 was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant Hb (rHb1) shows an unusually high affinity for O2 because of a very low dissociation constant. The absorbance spectra of the ferric and deoxyferrous rHb1 indicate that, in contrast to symbiotic Hbs, a distal ligand is coordinated to the ligand-binding site. Mutation of the distal His demonstrates that this residue coordinates the heme Fe of ferric and deoxyferrous rHb1 and stabilizes O2 in oxy-rHb1. The biochemical properties of rice rHb1 suggest that this protein probably does not function to facilitate the diffusion of O2.
Gene	Plant hemoglobins: what we know six decades after their discovery.	2007	Laboratorio de Biofisica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Morelos, Ave. Universidad 1001, Col. Chamilpa, 62210 Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico.	This review describes contributions to the study of plant hemoglobins (Hbs) from a historical perspective with emphasis on non-symbiotic Hbs (nsHbs). Plant Hbs were first identified in soybean root nodules, are known as leghemoglobins (Lbs) and have been characterized in detail. It is widely accepted that a function of Lbs in nodules is to facilitate the diffusion of O(2) to bacteroids. For many years Hbs could not be identified in plants other than N(2)-fixing legumes, however in the 1980s a Hb was isolated from the nodules of the non-legume dicot plant Parasponia, a hb gene was cloned from the non-nodulating Trema, and Hbs were detected in nodules of actinorhizal plants. Gene expression analysis showed that Trema Hb transcripts exist in non-symbiotic roots. In the 1990s nsHb sequences were also identified in monocot and primitive (bryophyte) plants. In addition to Lbs and nsHbs, Hb sequences that are similar to microbial truncated (2/2) Hbs were also detected in plants. Plant nsHbs have been characterized in detail. These proteins have very high O(2)-affinities because of an extremely low O(2)-dissociation constant. Analysis of rice Hb1 showed that distal His coordinates heme Fe and stabilizes bound O(2); this means that O(2) is not released easily from oxygenated nsHbs. Non-symbiotic hb genes are expressed in specific plant tissues, and overexpress in organs of stressed plants. These observations suggest that nsHbs have functions additional to O(2)-transport, such as to modulate levels of ATP and NO.
