Plant Mol. Biol.	A genome-wide survey of HD-Zip genes in rice and analysis of drought-responsive family members	2008	Institute of Biology, Clusius Laboratory, Leiden University, PO Box 9505, 2300 RA, Leiden, The Netherlands.	The homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-Zip) genes encode transcription factors that have diverse functions in plant development and have often been implicated in stress adaptation. The HD-Zip genes are the most abundant group of homeobox (HB) genes in plants and do not occur in other eukaryotes. This paper describes the complete annotation of the HD-Zip families I, II and III from rice and compares these gene families with Arabidopsis in a phylogeny reconstruction. Orthologous pairs of rice and Arabidopsis HD-Zip genes were predicted based on neighbour joining and maximum parsimony (MP) trees with support of conserved intron-exon organization. Additionally, a number of HD-Zip genes appeared to be unique to rice. Searching of EST and cDNA databases and expression analysis using RT-PCR showed that 30 out of 31 predicted rice HD-Zip genes are expressed. Most HD-Zip genes were broadly expressed in mature plants and seedlings, but others showed more organ specific patterns. Like in Arabidopsis and other dicots, a subset of the rice HD-Zip I and II genes was found to be regulated by drought stress. We identified both drought-induced and drought-repressed HD-Zip genes and demonstrate that these genes are differentially regulated in drought-sensitive versus drought-tolerant rice cultivars. The drought-repressed HD-Zip family I gene, Oshox4, was selected for promoter-GUS analysis, showing that drought-responsiveness of Oshox4 is controlled by the promoter and that Oshox4 expression is predominantly vascular-specific. Loss-of-function analysis of Oshox4 revealed no specific phenotype, but overexpression analysis suggested a role for Oshox4 in elongation and maturation processes.
BMC Genomics	Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice.	2011	Universite Montpellier 2, UMR DAP, Place Eugene Bataillon, 34095 Montpellier Cedex 5, France.	BACKGROUND: In rice, the major part of the post-embryonic root system is made of stem-derived roots named crown roots (CR). Among the few characterized rice mutants affected in root development, crown rootless1 mutant is unable to initiate crown root primordia. CROWN ROOTLESS1 (CRL1) is induced by auxin and encodes an AS2/LOB-domain transcription factor that acts upstream of the gene regulatory network controlling CR development. RESULTS: To identify genes involved in CR development, we compared global gene expression profile in stem bases of crl1 mutant and wild-type (WT) plants. Our analysis revealed that 250 and 236 genes are down- and up-regulated respectively in the crl1 mutant. Auxin induces CRL1 expression and consequently it is expected that auxin also alters the expression of genes that are early regulated by CRL1. To identify genes under the early control of CRL1, we monitored the expression kinetics of a selected subset of genes, mainly chosen among those exhibiting differential expression, in crl1 and WT following exogenous auxin treatment. This analysis revealed that most of these genes, mainly related to hormone, water and nutrient, development and homeostasis, were likely not regulated directly by CRL1. We hypothesized that the differential expression for these genes observed in the crl1 mutant is likely a consequence of the absence of CR formation. Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM (FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM)/FAS1 (FASCIATA1), GTE4 (GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4) and MAP (MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN) were identified. FSM/FAS1 and GTE4 are known in rice and Arabidopsis to be involved in the maintenance of root meristem through chromatin remodelling and cell cycle regulation respectively. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that the differential regulation of most genes in crl1 versus WT may be an indirect consequence of CRL1 inactivation resulting from the absence of CR in the crl1 mutant. Nevertheless some genes, FAS1/FSM, GTE4 and MAP, require CRL1 to be induced by auxin suggesting that they are likely directly regulated by CRL1. These genes have a function related to polarized cell growth, cell cycle regulation or chromatin remodelling. This suggests that these genes are controlled by CRL1 and involved in CR initiation in rice.
Planta	Comparative functional analysis of six drought-responsive promoters in transgenic rice.	2013	Biological Resources and Post-harvest Division, Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences (JIRCAS), Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8686, Japan, kazuo.nakashima@affrc.go.jp.	Rice production is greatly affected by environmental stresses such as drought and high salinity. Transgenic rice plants tolerant to such stresses are expected to be produced. Stress-responsive promoters with low expression under normal growth conditions are needed to minimize the adverse effects of stress-tolerance genes on rice growth. We performed expression analyses of drought-responsive genes in rice plants using a microarray, and selected LIP9, OsNAC6, OsLEA14a, OsRAB16D, OsLEA3-1, and Oshox24 for promoter analysis. Transient assays using the promoters indicated that AREB/ABF (abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive element-binding protein/ABA-binding factor) transcription factors enhanced expressions of these genes. We generated transgenic rice plants containing each promoter and the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. GUS assays revealed that the LIP9 and OsNAC6 promoters were induced by drought, high salinity, and ABA treatment, and both promoters showed strong activity under normal growth conditions in the root. The other promoters were strongly induced by stresses and ABA, but showed low activity under normal growth conditions. In seeds, GUS staining showed that Oshox24 expression was low and expressions of the other genes were high. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsNAC6 under the control of the Oshox24 promoter showed increased tolerance to drought and high salinity, and no growth defects. These data suggest that the Oshox24 promoter is useful to overexpress stress-tolerance genes without adversely affecting growth.
Mol. Gen. Genet.	HD-Zip proteins of families I and II from rice: interactions and functional properties.	2000	Institute of Molecular Plant Sciences, Leiden University, Clusius Laboratory, The Netherlands. meijer@rulbim.leidenuniv.nl	Proteins of the closely related homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) families I and II in plants are putative transcription factors that interact with similar pseudopalindromic DNA recognition sites. We have previously described the Oshox1 gene from rice, which encodes an HD-Zip II protein. To identify further rice HD-Zip proteins, one-hybrid screens were performed in yeast strains containing a HIS3 reporter gene with upstream HD-Zip recognition sites. This resulted in the isolation of six new cDNAs encoding HD-Zip proteins belonging to family I (Oshox4, -5, -6) or family II (Oshox2, -3, -7). In transient assays, using rice suspension-cultured cells transformed by particle bombardment, we showed previously that Oshox1 can transcriptionally repress the activity of reporter gene constructs with upstream HD-Zip binding sites. Here, we confirm the repression properties of Oshox1 by showing that the repression function can be conferred on a heterologous DNA-binding domain. This portable functional domain (residues 1-155) is located proximal to the HD-Zip domain. In yeast, the same region of the Oshox1 protein was found to confer transcriptional activation instead of repression, pointing to the possibility that cell type-specific factors may determine the functional properties of the Oshox1 protein in rice. Like Oshox1, another HD-Zip family II protein (Oshox3) was also found to function as a transcriptional repressor in rice cells. In contrast, two HD-Zip I family proteins (Oshox4 and -5) appeared to act as activators in both rice and yeast cells. Results of two-hybrid assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays strongly suggest that all HD-Zip proteins of families I and II can form homodimers and also heterodimers with all HD-Zip proteins of the same family. Heterodimerization across the HD-Zip families I and II apparently does not to occur.
Plant J.	Development of an efficient method for the isolation of factors involved in gene transcription during rice embryo development.	2004	National Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 200032 Shanghai, China.	Summary An efficient yeast-based system was developed for the isolation of plant cDNAs encoding transcription factors (TFs) and proteins with transcription activation functions (co-activators). The system consists of two vectors: (i) a reporter vector (pG221) harboring the iso-1-cytochrome c (CYC1) core promoter and the beta-galactosidase (lacZ) gene; and (ii) a cDNA library construction vector (pYF503), which yields a library of plant peptides fused to the GAL4-binding domain (GAL4-BD). Expression of a peptide harboring the characteristics of a transcriptional activator leads to expression of lacZ, allowing for selection of relevant colonies. TFs during rice embryo development were isolated through this system. Approximately 200 confirmed positive colonies were obtained from screening 10(6) yeast colonies, and sequence analysis of conserved domains identified 75 independent cDNAs, 20 of which encoded plant TFs or co-activators, including members of the APETALA2 (AP2)/ethylene-responsive element-binding protein (EREBP), MYB and growth-regulating factor (GRF) families. Peptides encoded by 13 of the isolated cDNAs were classified as potential TFs or co-activators because of the presence of conserved TF-like domains. Additionally, 2, 11, and 13 clones encoded kinases, chromosome-related proteins, and unknown proteins, respectively, while the remaining 16 cDNAs were associated with specific functions seemingly unrelated to TFs. Expression pattern analysis of selected TF-encoding genes via RT-PCR revealed that these genes were expressed during seed development, with differential transcription observed during various stages. This work provides informative hints for further study of the regulatory mechanism of rice seed development and illustrates an identification strategy that will be of practical value for the isolation of TFs and co-activators associated with specific plant developmental processes.
