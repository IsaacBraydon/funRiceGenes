Plant Mol. Biol.	Functional Identification of a Trehalose 6-phosphate Phosphatase Gene that is Involved in Transient Induction of Trehalose Biosynthesis during Chilling Stress in Rice.	2005	Winter Stress Laboratory, National Agricultural Research Center for Hokkaido Region, National Agricultural and Bio-oriented Research Organization, Hitsujigaoka 1, 062-8555 Toyohira-ku, Sapporo, Japan.	Trehalose serves as a stress protectant and/or reserve carbohydrate in a variety of organisms including bacteria, yeast, and invertebrates. Recently, trace amounts of trehalose have been detected in higher plants, although the function of trehalose in plants remains unknown. A cDNA clone (OsTPP1) encoding a putative trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) for trehalose biosynthesis was isolated from rice. Functionality of the clone was demonstrated by complementation of a yeast mutant and enzymatic activity of the recombinant protein. Northern blots revealed that the OsTPP1 transcript levels were fairly low or under detectable limits in most of the tissues under ambient conditions but were highly induced within 1-2 h of chilling stress (12 degrees C) in both root and shoot tissues of seedlings. This induction was transient and disappeared after 6 h of the chilling stress. Transient expression of OsTPP1 was also induced under severe chilling stress (4 degrees C) as well as salinity and drought stresses at ambient temperatures. Application of exogenous ABA (50 microM) resulted in a transient increase of OsTPP1 expression within 20 min of the treatment, thereby suggesting involvement of ABA in OsTPP1 gene regulation. Measurements of total cellular TPP activity and trehalose content in roots indicated that both TPP activity and trehalose levels were transiently increased after chilling (12 degrees C) stress. Collectively, the data indicate that transient activation of trehalose biosynthesis is involved in early chilling stress response in rice. Possible functions of trehalose in the early stages of chilling stress response are discussed.
FEBS J.	Biochemical characterization of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases supports distinctive functions of these plant enzymes.	2007	Crop Cold Tolerance Research Team, National Agricultural Research Center for Hokkaido Region, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, Hitsujigaoka 1, Toyohira-ku, Sapporo 062-8555, Japan.	Substantial levels of trehalose accumulate in bacteria, fungi, and invertebrates, where it serves as a storage carbohydrate or as a protectant against environmental stresses. In higher plants, trehalose is detected at fairly low levels; therefore, a regulatory or signaling function has been proposed for this molecule. In many organisms, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase is the enzyme governing the final step of trehalose biosynthesis. Here we report that OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 are the two major trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase genes expressed in vegetative tissues of rice. Similar to results obtained from our previous OsTPP1 study, complementation analysis of a yeast trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase mutant and activity measurement of the recombinant protein demonstrated that OsTPP2 encodes a functional trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enzyme. OsTPP2 expression is transiently induced in response to chilling and other abiotic stresses. Enzymatic characterization of recombinant OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 revealed stringent substrate specificity for trehalose 6-phosphate and about 10 times lower K(m) values for trehalose 6-phosphate as compared with trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enzymes from microorganisms. OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 also clearly contrasted with microbial enzymes, in that they are generally unstable, almost completely losing activity when subjected to heat treatment at 50 degrees C for 4 min. These characteristics of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enzymes are consistent with very low cellular substrate concentration and tightly regulated gene expression. These data also support a plant-specific function of trehalose biosynthesis in response to environmental stresses.

Plant Physiol.	A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice.	2010	Institute of Biotechnology, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 701, Taiwan, Republic of China.	Rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings are particularly sensitive to chilling in early spring in temperate and subtropical zones and in high-elevation areas. Improvement of chilling tolerance in rice may significantly increase rice production. MYBS3 is a single DNA-binding repeat MYB transcription factor previously shown to mediate sugar signaling in rice. In this study, we observed that MYBS3 also plays a critical role in cold adaptation in rice. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses indicated that MYBS3 was sufficient and necessary for enhancing cold tolerance in rice. Transgenic rice constitutively overexpressing MYBS3 tolerated 4 degrees C for at least 1 week and exhibited no yield penalty in normal field conditions. Transcription profiling of transgenic rice overexpressing or underexpressing MYBS3 led to the identification of many genes in the MYBS3-mediated cold signaling pathway. Several genes activated by MYBS3 as well as inducible by cold have previously been implicated in various abiotic stress responses and/or tolerance in rice and other plant species. Surprisingly, MYBS3 repressed the well-known DREB1/CBF-dependent cold signaling pathway in rice, and the repression appears to act at the transcriptional level. DREB1 responded quickly and transiently while MYBS3 responded slowly to cold stress, which suggests that distinct pathways act sequentially and complementarily for adapting short- and long-term cold stress in rice. Our studies thus reveal a hitherto undiscovered novel pathway that controls cold adaptation in rice.
Planta.	Overexpression of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene OsTPS1 enhances abiotic stress tolerance in rice.	2011	Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering Drug and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, People's Republic of China.	Trehalose plays an important role in metabolic regulation and abiotic stress tolerance in a variety of organisms. In plants, its biosynthesis is catalyzed by two key enzymes: trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP). The genome of rice (Oryza sativa) contains 11 OsTPS genes, and only OsTPS1 shows TPS activity. To demonstrate the physiological function of OsTPS1, we introduced it into rice and found that OsTPS1 overexpression improved the tolerance of rice seedling to cold, high salinity and drought treatments without other significant phenotypic changes. In transgenic lines overexpressing OsTPS1, trehalose and proline concentrations were higher than in the wild type and some stress-related genes were up-regulated, including WSI18, RAB16C, HSP70, and ELIP. These results demonstrate that OsTPS1 may enhance the abiotic stress tolerance of plants by increasing the amount of trehalose and proline, and regulating the expression of stress-related genes. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of some Class II TPSs also enhanced plant tolerance of abiotic stress. This work will help to clarify the role of trehalose metabolism in abiotic stress response in higher plants.
