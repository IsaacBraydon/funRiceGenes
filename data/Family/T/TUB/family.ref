Plant Cell Physiol.	Expression Analyses of beta-tubulin Isotype Genes in Rice.	2003	Department of Molecular Genetics, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602 Japan.	Microtubules play important roles in many cellular processes, such as cell division and cell elongation in plants. beta-tubulins, which are the basic components of microtubules, are encoded by multigene family in eukaryotes and their nucleotide sequences are highly conserved in protein coding regions. A homology search within the rice expressed sequence tag database identified at least eight beta-tubulin (OsTUB) isotypes including three novel OsTUB genes. Northern analysis using specific probes to 3'-UTR of OsTUB isotypes showed differential and tissue-specific expression. Seven out of eight OsTUB genes dominantly expressed in leaf sheath, while OsTUB8 was preferentially expressed in anther including mature pollens. The existence of anther-specific beta-tubulin suggests its unique role in the formation of microtubules during the anther and pollen development or pollen tube growth. Furthermore, transcripts of OsTUB5, 6 and 7 genes were significantly enhanced by gibberellin but all eight OsTUB genes were repressed by abscisic acid. Our results imply that OsTUB genes are differentially regulated by developmental and hormonal signals and different OsTUB isotypes might play special role in the growth and development of specific organs in rice.

Plant Mol. Biol.	Isolation and characterization of two beta-tubulin cDNA clones from rice.	1994	Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Research Center, Gyeongsang National University, Chinju, Korea.	Two cDNA clones encoding two different beta-tubulins, RTUB-1 and RTUB-2, were isolated from a rice cDNA library and their nucleotide sequences were analyzed. The deduced amino acid sequences showed amino acid sequence identity between 92% and 97% with other plant beta-tubulins. Southern blot analysis using gene-specific and coding-region probes suggested that beta-tubulins in rice are encoded by multigene families. The two cDNA clones represent two subfamilies of rice tubulins, RTUB-1 and RTUB-2, consisting of 3 to 4 genes and a single gene, respectively. The transcript levels of RTUB-1 and RTUB-2 genes were higher in actively elongating tissues such as etiolated shoot tissues and light-grown root tissues of four-day old seedlings.
DNA Res.	cDNA sequences of three kinds of beta-tubulins from rice.	1995	Rice Genome Research Program, National Institute of Agrobiological Resources, Ibaraki, Japan.	Complete nucleotide sequences of three kinds of rice beta-tubulin cDNA clones (pTUB22, R1623 and R2242) were determined. Southern hybridization indicated that these beta-tubulins consist of one gene family. Using RFLP mapping, these three beta-tubulin cDNAs were mapped to different chromosomes indicating at least three loci for the beta-tubulin gene. The deduced amino acid sequences of these cDNAs showed a high similarity to other plant beta-tubulins. The asparagine residue located at the 100th amino acid from the N-terminus of plant beta-tubulins was also conserved with these three beta-tubulins. This asparagine is thought to be responsible for the sensitivity against rhizoxin, the toxin of the pathogen of rice seedling blight, Rhizopus sp. a soil-borne microorganism. Expression of the three beta-tubulin genes was analyzed by Northern blotting and all three clones were expressed in root, the possible target tissue of rhizoxin. These results suggest that these clones are candidates of beta-tubulins targeted by rhizoxin.
