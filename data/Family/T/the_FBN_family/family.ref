Fibrillins (FBNs) constitute a plastid-lipid-associated protein family that plays a role in chloroplast development, lipids metabolism and stress responses in plants. Until now, FBNs have been functionally characterized in stability of thylakoid and responses to the different stress stimuli. Consequently, phylogeny, domain composition and structural features of 121 FBNs family proteins from ten representative species have been identified. As results, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that FBNs proteins were grouped into 24 clades and further subdivided into three groups, including terrestrial plant-specific, algae-specific, and intermediate group. These FBNs genes had different numbers of introns and exons but encoded the conserved N-terminal chloroplast transport peptide (CTP) domains and plastid lipid-associated protein (PAP) domains, which greatly contributed to the sub-functionalization and neo-functionalization. Meanwhile, the CTP domains of eleven OsFBN proteins except OsFBN8 could help them transport into chloroplasts. The PAP domains of OsFBN2 and OsFBN4 showed the in vitro specific binding activity to C12-C22 fatty acids that were affected by YxD motif. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that OsFBN genes were differentially induced by heat stress and cold stress in rice. Collectively, this study has provided the new insights into the evolution, structure, and functions of FBN gene family and will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of these proteins functioning in growth, development and adaptations in the global climate change.
