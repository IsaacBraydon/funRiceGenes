There are many homologs of OsFTIPs in plants; however, the bioinformatics of them remains unclear. In the studies, 13 OsFTIP genes are identified in rice. OsFTIPs are unevenly located in 12 chromosomes. The OsFTIPs are phylogenetically divided into three clades. Cis-elements respond to abiotic stress, light, and hormones are found in the promoter region of OsFTIPs which are induced by the stimuli. All OsFTIPs are expressed with different profiles. Syntenic analysis of 128 OsFTIPs and FTIP-like homologs reveals that various number of gene pairs are identified between rice and other species. The 128 FTIP-like homologs are divided into six groups which fall into three classes. Ten motifs are shared by most OsFTIPs and their homologs. The studies provide a theoretical basis for further elucidating the functions of OsFTIP gene family.
