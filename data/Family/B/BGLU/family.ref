BMC Plant Biol.	Analysis of rice glycosyl hydrolase family 1 and expression of Os4bglu12 beta-glucosidase.	2006	Institute of Science, Suranaree University of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima 30000, Thailand. opassiri@hotmail.com &lt;opassiri@hotmail.com&gt;	BACKGROUND: Glycosyl hydrolase family 1 (GH1) beta-glucosidases have been implicated in physiologically important processes in plants, such as response to biotic and abiotic stresses, defense against herbivores, activation of phytohormones, lignification, and cell wall remodeling. Plant GH1 beta-glucosidases are encoded by a multigene family, so we predicted the structures of the genes and the properties of their protein products, and characterized their phylogenetic relationship to other plant GH1 members, their expression and the activity of one of them, to begin to decipher their roles in rice. RESULTS: Forty GH1 genes could be identified in rice databases, including 2 possible endophyte genes, 2 likely pseudogenes, 2 gene fragments, and 34 apparently competent rice glycosidase genes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that GH1 members with closely related sequences have similar gene structures and are often clustered together on the same chromosome. Most of the genes appear to have been derived from duplications that occurred after the divergence of rice and Arabidopsis thaliana lineages from their common ancestor, and the two plants share only 8 common gene lineages. At least 31 GH1 genes are expressed in a range of organs and stages of rice, based on the cDNA and EST sequences in public databases. The cDNA of the Os4bglu12 gene, which encodes a protein identical at 40 of 44 amino acid residues with the N-terminal sequence of a cell wall-bound enzyme previously purified from germinating rice, was isolated by RT-PCR from rice seedlings. A thioredoxin-Os4bglu12 fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli efficiently hydrolyzed beta-(1,4)-linked oligosaccharides of 3-6 glucose residues and laminaribiose. CONCLUSION: Careful analysis of the database sequences produced more reliable rice GH1 gene structure and protein product predictions. Since most of these genes diverged after the divergence of the ancestors of rice and Arabidopsis thaliana, only a few of their functions could be implied from those of GH1 enzymes from Arabidopsis and other dicots. This implies that analysis of GH1 enzymes in monocots is necessary to understand their function in the major grain crops. To begin this analysis, Os4bglu12 beta-glucosidase was characterized and found to have high exoglucanase activity, consistent with a role in cell wall metabolism.
Arch. Biochem. Biophys.	The crystal structure of rice (Oryza sativa L.) Os4BGlu12, an oligosaccharide and tuberonic acid glucoside-hydrolyzing beta-glucosidase with significant thioglucohydrolase activity.	2011	Institute of Science, Schools of Biochemistry and Chemistry, Suranaree University of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand.	Rice Os4BGlu12, a glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1) beta-glucosidase, hydrolyzes beta-(1,4)-linked oligosaccharides of 3-6 glucosyl residues and the beta-(1,3)-linked disaccharide laminaribiose, as well as certain glycosides. The crystal structures of apo Os4BGlu12, and its complexes with 2,4-dinitrophenyl-2-deoxyl-2-fluoroglucoside (DNP2FG) and 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose (G2F) were solved at 2.50, 2.45 and 2.40A resolution, respectively. The overall structure of rice Os4BGlu12 is typical of GH1 enzymes, but it contains an extra disulfide bridge in the loop B region. The glucose ring of the G2F in the covalent intermediate was found in a (4)C(1) chair conformation, while that of the noncovalently bound DNP2FG had a (1)S(3) skew boat, consistent with hydrolysis via a (4)H(3) half-chair transition state. The position of the catalytic nucleophile (Glu393) in the G2F structure was more similar to that of the Sinapsis alba myrosinase G2F complex than to that in covalent intermediates of other O-glucosidases, such as rice Os3BGlu6 and Os3BGlu7 beta-glucosidases. This correlated with a significant thioglucosidase activity for Os4BGlu12, although with 200- to 1200-fold lower k(cat)/K(m) values for S-glucosides than the comparable O-glucosides, while hydrolysis of S-glucosides was undetectable for Os3BGlu6 and Os3BGlu7.
Arch. Biochem. Biophys.	Enzymatic and structural characterization of hydrolysis of gibberellin A4 glucosyl ester by a rice beta-d-glucosidase.	2013	School of Biochemistry and Chemistry, Institute of Science, Suranaree University of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand.	In order to identify a rice gibberellin ester beta-D-glucosidase, gibberellin A4 beta-D-glucosyl ester (GA4-GE) was synthesized and used to screen rice beta-glucosidases. Os3BGlu6 was found to have the highest hydrolysis activity to GA4-GE among five recombinantly expressed rice glycoside hydrolase family GH1 enzymes from different phylogenic clusters. The kinetic parameters of Os3BGlu6 and its mutants E178Q, E178A, E394D, E394Q and M251N for hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside (pNPGlc) and GA4-GE confirmed the roles of the catalytic acid/base and nucleophile for hydrolysis of both substrates and suggested M251 contributes to binding hydrophobic aglycones. The activities of the Os3BGlu6 E178Q and E178A acid/base mutants were rescued by azide, which they transglucosylate to produce beta-D-glucopyranosyl azide, in a pH-dependent manner, while acetate also rescued Os3BGlu6 E178A at low pH. High concentrations of sodium azide (200-400 mM) inhibited Os3BGlu6 E178Q but not Os3BGlu6 E178A. The structures of Os3BGlu6 E178Q crystallized with either GA4-GE or pNPGlc had a native alpha-D-glucosyl moiety covalently linked to the catalytic nucleophile, E394, which showed the hydrogen bonding to the 2-hydroxyl in the covalent intermediate. These data suggest that a GH1 beta-glucosidase uses the same retaining catalytic mechanism to hydrolyze 1-O-acyl glucose ester and glucoside.
