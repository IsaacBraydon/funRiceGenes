Plant Physiol Biochem	Identification of jumonjiC domain containing gene family among the Oryza species and their expression analysis in FL478, a salt tolerant rice genotype.	2018	ICAR-National Research Centre on Plant Biotechnology, Lal-Bahadur Shastri Centre, IARI, Pusa, New Delhi, 110012, India.	The jumonji (JMJ)-C domain containing proteins belong to histone demethylases family with the ability to demethylate the tri-methylated histone residues. They act as chromatin regulators to regulate many physiological functions in plants. The present study deals with the characterization of JMJ-C gene family members in wild as well as cultivated rice species and their expression analysis in salt tolerant rice genotype, FL478. The genome wide study identified 151 members belonging to JMJ-C gene family in 11 different Oryza species. We also studied their structure, genomic location, gene duplication events, phylogenetic relationship, in silico expression analysis and identified cis elements in their promoters. We also found a few JMJ-C gene family members in rice which underwent duplication before the whole genome duplication event of the rice. The qRT-PCR based expression profiling revealed that out of the total 15 rice JMJ-C members, two were highly expressed in the flag leaf stage of FL478 under salt treatment. These two candidate JMJ-C members were also found to render salinity tolerance when over-expressed in yeast cells. Thus, the present study helps in further structural as well as functional characterization of JMJ-C genes under salinity stress in Oryza species.
