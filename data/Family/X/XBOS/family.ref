Plant Cell	Rice XA21 Binding Protein 3 Is a Ubiquitin Ligase Required for Full Xa21-Mediated Disease Resistance	2006	Department of Plant Pathology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611, USA.	XA21 is a receptor-like kinase protein in rice (Oryza sativa) that confers gene-for-gene resistance to specific races of the causal agent of bacterial blight disease, Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. We identified XA21 binding protein 3 (XB3), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a substrate for the XA21 Ser and Thr kinase. The interaction between XB3 and the kinase domain of XA21 has been shown in yeast and in vitro, and the physical association between XB3 and XA21 in vivo has also been confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays. XB3 contains an ankyrin repeat domain and a RING finger motif that is sufficient for its interaction with the kinase domain of XA21 and for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, respectively. Transgenic plants with reduced expression of the Xb3 gene are compromised in resistance to the avirulent race of X. oryzae pv oryzae. Furthermore, reduced levels of Xb3 lead to decreased levels of the XA21 protein. These results indicate that Xb3 is necessary for full accumulation of the XA21 protein and for Xa21-mediated resistance.
DNA Res.	Comprehensive Analysis of the Rice RING E3 Ligase Family Reveals Their Functional Diversity in Response to Abiotic stress.	2013	Department of Applied Plant Sciences Technology, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 200-713, Republic of Korea.	A large number of really interesting new gene (RING) E3 ligases contribute to the post-translational modification of target proteins during plant responses to environmental stresses. However, the physical interactome of RING E3 ligases in rice remains largely unknown. Here, we evaluated the expression patterns of 47 Oryza sativa RING finger protein (OsRFP) genes in response to abiotic stresses via semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in silico analysis. Subsequently, molecular dissection of nine OsRFPs was performed by the examination of their E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, subcellular localization, and physical interaction with target proteins. Most of the OsRFPs examined possessed E3 ligase activity and showed diverse subcellular localization. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was then employed to construct a physical interaction map of seven OsRFPs with their 120 interacting proteins. The results indicated that these OsRFPs required dynamic translocation and partitioning for their cellular activation. Heterogeneous overexpression of each of the OsRFP genes in Arabidopsis suggested that they have functionally diverse responses to abiotic stresses, which may have been acquired during evolution. This comprehensive study provides insights into the biological functions of OsRFPs, which may be useful in understanding how rice plants adapt to unfavourable environmental conditions.
