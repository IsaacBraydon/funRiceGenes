Plant Physiol.	A surprising diversity and abundance of xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases in rice. Classification and expression analysis.	2004	Department of Developmental Biology and Neurosciences, Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8578, Japan.	A search of the recently completed genomic database of rice (Oryza sativa) identified a 29-member xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (OsXTH) gene family. This first report of a complete XTH family from a monocotyledonous species reveals that the OsXTH family is comparable in size with that of the dicotyledon Arabidopsis thaliana, which consists of 33 AtXTH genes. This is surprising because xyloglucan, the specific substrate of XTHs, is considerably less abundant in cell walls of monocotyledons than dicotyledons and is not typically ascribed an important structural role in monocotyledons. As a first step toward determining the roles of rice XTHs, the expression patterns of all 29 OsXTH genes were examined using a quantitative DNA microarray procedure with gene-specific oligonucleotide probes. The analysis showed that most members of the rice XTH family exhibited organ- and growth stage-specific expression. This was confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of representative OsXTH members. This revealed in more detail the temporally and spatially controlled expression profiles of individual OsXTH genes at particular sites in rice. Previous reports indicated that grasses have relatively greater xyloglucan endotransglucosylase activities, one of the two enzyme activities catalyzed by XTHs, than in equivalent tissues in dicotyledons. This observation, together with the tissue-specific and growth stage-dependent expression of a large rice XTH gene family, suggests that xyloglucan metabolism plays a more central role in monocotyledon cell wall restructuring than has been reported previously.
Plant Physiol.	Characterization of XET-related genes of rice.	2000	Graduate School of Bioagricultural Science and BioScience Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan. uozu@nuagr1.agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp	To elucidate the mechanism of internodal elongation in rice (Oryza sativa L.), we analyzed genes encoding xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (XET), a cell wall-loosening enzyme essential for cell elongation. Four rice XET-related (XTR) genes, OsXTR1, OsXTR2, OsXTR3, and OsXTR4, were isolated and their expression patterns in rice plants determined. The expression of the four XTR genes showed different patterns of organ specificity and responses to several plant hormones. OsXTR1 and OsXTR3 were up-regulated by gibberellin and brassinosteroids, whereas OsXTR2 and OsXTR4 showed no clear response to these hormones. Expression of the four XTR genes was also investigated in elongating internodes at different developmental stages. OsXTR1 and OsXTR3 were preferentially expressed in the elongating zone of internodes, while OsXTR2 and OsXTR4 were expressed in nodes and in the divisional and elongating zones of internodes. In three genetic mutants with abnormal heights, the expression of OsXTR1 and OsXTR3 correlated with the height of the mutants, whereas no such correlation was observed for OsXTR2 and OsXTR4. Based on these observations, we discuss the roles that OsXTR1 and OsXTR3 may play in internodal elongation in rice.
Plant Mol. Biol.	T-DNA tagged knockout mutation of rice OsGSK1, an orthologue of Arabidopsis BIN2, with enhanced tolerance to various abiotic stresses.	2007	Department of Life Science, Sogang University, Seoul 121-742, Korea.	T-DNA-tagged rice plants were screened under cold- or salt-stress conditions to determine the genes involved in the molecular mechanism for their abiotic-stress response. Line 0-165-65 was identified as a salt-responsive line. The gene responsible for this GUS-positive phenotype was revealed by inverse PCR as OsGSK1 (Oryza sativa glycogen synthase kinase3-like gene 1), a member of the plant GSK3/SHAGGY-like protein kinase genes and an orthologue of the Arabidopsis brassinosteroid insensitive 2 (BIN2), AtSK21. Northern blot analysis showed that OsGSK1 was most highly detected in the developing panicles, suggesting that its expression is developmental stage specific. Knockout (KO) mutants of OsGSK1 showed enhanced tolerance to cold, heat, salt, and drought stresses when compared with non-transgenic segregants (NT). Overexpression of the full-length OsGSK1 led to a stunted growth phenotype similar to the one observed with the gain-of-function BIN/AtSK21 mutant. This suggests that OsGSK1 might be a functional rice orthologue that serves as a negative regulator of brassinosteroid (BR)-signaling. Therefore, we propose that stress-responsive OsGSK1 may have physiological roles in stress signal-transduction pathways and floral developmental processes.

Plant J.	A brassinolide-suppressed rice MADS-box transcription factor, OsMDP1, has a negative regulatory role in BR signaling.	2006	Key Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Environmental Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 20 Nanxincun Road, 100093 Beijing, China.	The MADS-box transcription factor-encoding genes are expressed mainly during plant reproductive development, where they play important roles in controlling floral organ initiation and identity. Few previous reports have investigated the functions of MADS-box transcription factors expressed in vegetative tissues. Here we describe the functional characterization of a rice AG-like MADS-box protein, OsMDP1 (Oryza sativa MADS-domain-containing protein 1). A partial cDNA encoding a MADS-box domain was identified via high-throughput screening of rice brassinolide-regulated genes, and the full-length cDNA was subsequently isolated via screening of a cDNA library constructed from rice materials at tillering stage. Expression pattern analyses indicated that OsMDP1 is transcribed mainly in vegetative tissues, including the mature leaf, coleoptile, root-elongation zone, culm internode, and especially the joint region between the leaf blade and sheath. Further studies revealed that transcription of OsMDP1 is stimulated by darkness and suppressed by brassinolide treatment. OsMDP1 deficiency resulted in shortened primary roots, elongated coleoptiles and enhanced lamina joint inclinations. Moreover, transgenic plants showed hypersensitivities to exogenous brassinolide in terms of lamina joint inclination and coleoptile elongation. OsMDP1 deficiency resulted in enhanced expression of OsXTR1, which encodes xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, the cell-wall loosening enzyme necessary for cell elongation, and modulated expressions of multiple genes involved in cell signalling and gene transcription, indicating the key negative regulatory role of OsMDP1 in BR signalling.
