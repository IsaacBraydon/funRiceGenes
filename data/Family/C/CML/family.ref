BMC Plant Biol.	Genome-wide identification and analyses of the rice calmodulin and related potential calcium sensor proteins.	2007	Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Payathai Road, Patumwan, Bangkok 10330, Thailand. b.bongkoj@gmail.com	BACKGROUND: A wide range of stimuli evoke rapid and transient increases in [Ca2+]cyt in plant cells which are transmitted by protein sensors that contain EF-hand motifs. Here, a group of Oryza sativa L. genes encoding calmodulin (CaM) and CaM-like (CML) proteins that do not possess functional domains other than the Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs was analyzed. RESULTS: By functional analyses and BLAST searches of the TIGR rice database, a maximum number of 243 proteins that possibly have EF-hand motifs were identified in the rice genome. Using a neighbor-joining tree based on amino acid sequence similarity, five loci were defined as Cam genes and thirty two additional CML genes were identified. Extensive analyses of the gene structures, the chromosome locations, the EF-hand motif organization, expression characteristics including analysis by RT-PCR and a comparative analysis of Cam and CML genes in rice and Arabidopsis are presented. CONCLUSION: Although many proteins have unknown functions, the complexity of this gene family indicates the importance of Ca2+-signals in regulating cellular responses to stimuli and this family of proteins likely plays a critical role as their transducers.
Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. (Shanghai)	Biophysical characterization of calmodulin and calmodulin-like proteins from rice, Oryza sativa L.	2011	Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.	Calmodulin (CaM) transduces the increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations by binding to and altering the activities of target proteins, thereby affecting the physiological responses to the vast array of stimuli. Here, we examined the purified recombinant proteins encoded by three Cam and eight Cam-like (CML) genes from rice. With the exception of one OsCML, all recombinant proteins could be purified by Ca(2+)-dependent hydrophobic chromatography and exhibited an electrophoretic mobility shift when incubated with Ca(2+). The three CaMs all bound CaM kinase II peptide, but none of the eight CMLs did, suggesting a possible differential target binding between the CaM and CML proteins. In addition, their conformational changes upon Ca(2+)-binding were evaluated by circular dichroism spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy using 8-Anilino-1-naphthalene-sulfonic acid. Taken together, OsCMLs were found exhibiting a spectrum of both structural and functional characteristics that ranged from typical to atypical of CaMs. From structural comparison, the OsCMLs have overall main-chain conformation nearly identical to OsCaMs, but with distinct distribution of some charged and hydrophobic amino acids on their target-binding site. These results suggest that genetic polymorphism has promoted the functional diversity of the OsCML family, whose members possess modes of actions probably different from, though maybe overlapping with, those of OsCaMs.
BMC Res Notes	Expression analysis of calmodulin and calmodulin-like genes from rice, Oryza sativa L.	2012	Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand.	BACKGROUND: In plants, a large family of calmodulin (CaM) and CaM-like (CML) proteins transduce the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations by binding to and altering the activities of target proteins, and thereby affecting the physiological responses to a vast array of stimuli. Here, transcript expression analysis of Cam and CML gene family members in rice (Oryza sativa L.) was extensively examined. RESULTS: Cam and CML genes in rice exhibited differential expression patterns in tissues/organs. Under osmotic stress and salt stress, expression of OsCam1-1, OsCML4, 5, 8, and 11 was induced with different kinetics and magnitude. OsCML4 and 8 mRNA levels significantly increased by 3 h after treatment and remained elevated for at least 24 h while expression of OsCam1-1, OsCML5 and 11 was up-regulated as early as 1-3 h before rapidly returning to normal levels. Several cis-acting elements in response to abiotic stresses, including DREs (important promoter elements responsive to drought, high salt, and cold stress), were detected in the 5' upstream regions of these genes. The observed induction of the GUS activity of transgenic rice plants via the OsCam1-1 promoter appeared to be biphasic and dependent on the severity of salt stress. CONCLUSIONS: Large OsCam and OsCML gene family members likely play differential roles as signal transducers in regulating various developmental processes and represent important nodes in the signal transduction and transcriptional regulation networks in abiotic stresss responses mediated by the complex Ca2+ signals in plants, which are rich in both spatial and temporal information.
Planta	A novel rice calmodulin-like gene, OsMSR2, enhances drought and salt tolerance and increases ABA sensitivity in Arabidopsis	2011	Laboratory for Agro-ecological Process in the Subtropical Region, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hunan 410125, China.	Many abiotic stimuli, such as drought and salt stresses, elicit changes in intracellular calcium levels that serve to convey information and activate adaptive responses. Ca(2)(+) signals are perceived by different Ca(2)(+) sensors, and calmodulin (CaM) is one of the best-characterized Ca(2)(+) sensors in eukaryotes. Calmodulin-like (CML) proteins also exist in plants, but their functions at the physiological and molecular levels are largely unknown. In this report, we present data on OsMSR2 (Oryza sativa L. Multi-Stress-Responsive gene 2), a novel calmodulin-like protein gene isolated from rice Pei'ai 64S (Oryza sativa L.). Expression of OsMSR2 was strongly up-regulated by a wide spectrum of stresses, including cold, drought, and heat in different tissues at different developmental stages of rice, as revealed by both microarray and quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses. Analysis of the recombinant OsMSR2 protein demonstrated its potential ability to bind Ca(2)(+) in vitro. Expression of OsMSR2 conferred enhanced tolerance to high salt and drought in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accompanied by altered expression of stress/ABA-responsive genes. Transgenic plants also exhibited hypersensitivity to ABA during the seed germination and post-germination stages. The results suggest that expression of OsMSR2 modulated salt and drought tolerance in Arabidopsis through ABA-mediated pathways.
Mol. Plant Pathol.	The arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis promotes the systemic induction of regulatory defence-related genes in rice leaves and confers resistance to pathogen infection.	2011	Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics (CRAG) CSIC-IRTA-UAB-UB, Parc de Recerca UAB, Edifici CRAG, Campus UAB, Bellaterra (Cerdanyola del Valles), 08193, Barcelona, Spain.	Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses are mutualistic associations between soil fungi and most vascular plants. Their association benefits the host plant by improving nutrition, mainly phosphorus nutrition, and by providing increased capability to cope with adverse conditions. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional changes triggered in rice leaves as a result of AM symbiosis, focusing on the relevance of the plant defence response. We showed that root colonization by the AM fungus Glomus intraradices is accompanied by the systemic induction of genes that play a regulatory role in the host defence response, such as OsNPR1, OsAP2, OsEREBP and OsJAmyb. Genes involved in signal transduction processes (OsDUF26 and OsMPK6) and genes that function in calcium-mediated signalling processes (OsCBP, OsCaM and OsCML4) are also up-regulated in leaves of mycorrhizal rice plants in the absence of pathogen infection. In addition, the mycorrhizal rice plants exhibit a stronger induction of defence marker genes [i.e. pathogenesis-related (PR) genes] in their leaves in response to infection by the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Evidence indicates that mycorrhizal rice plants show enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus. Overall, these results suggest that the protective effect of the AM symbiosis in rice plants relies on both the systemic activation of defence regulatory genes in the absence of pathogen challenge and the priming for stronger expression of defence effector genes during pathogen infection. The possible mechanisms involved in the mycorrhiza-induced resistance to M. oryzae infection are discussed.
