Lutein is the most abundant plant carotenoid and plays essential roles in photosystem assembly and stabilization, as well as protection against photostress. To date, only a few lutein biosynthesis genes have been identified in crop plants. In this study, the rice Cyt P450 gene CYP97A4 encoding a carotenoid beta-ring hydroxylase was shown to be involved in lutein biosynthesis. The results revealed that CYP97A4 was preferentially expressed in leaf compared with spikelet, sheath, stalk and root, and encoded a protein localized at the subcellular level to the chloroplasts. Compared with the wild type, the three allelic mutants of CYP97A4 displayed lutein reductions of 12-24% with substantially increased alpha-carotene, while Chl a/b levels were unaltered. The increased alpha-carotene in the mutants led to greater sensitivity under high light stress. Similarly, reactive oxygen species (ROS) imaging of leaves treated with intense light showed that the mutants generally accumulated greater levels of ROS compared with wild-type plants, which probably caused detrimental effects to the plant photosystem. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the important role of CYP97A4 in alpha-carotene hydroxylation in rice, and knock-out of the gene reduced lutein and increased alpha-carotene, contributing to sensitivity to intense light.
