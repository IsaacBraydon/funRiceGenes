Mol. Gen. Genet.	Diverse response of rice and maize genes encoding homologs of WPK4, an SNF1-related protein kinase from wheat, to light, nutrients, low temperature and cytokinins.	2000	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Breeding, Research and Education Center for Genetic Information, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Japan.	The wheat gene WPK4 encodes a 56-kDa protein kinase that belongs to group 3 of the SNF1-related protein kinase family (SnRK3), and is up-regulated by light and cytokinins and down-regulated by sucrose. In order to determine whether or not this particular regulation pattern is general among plant species, we isolated and characterized homologous genes from rice and maize. Two rice genes, OsPK4 and OsPK7, encode proteins comprising 508 and 520 amino acids, and show, respectively, 75% and 76% sequence similarity to WPK4. OsPK4 and OsPK7 proteins produced in Escherichia coli were able to phosphorylate themselves and myelin basic proteins, the reaction requiring magnesium and/or manganese ions. Transcripts of OsPK4 were detected in all tissues tested, and amounts were increased upon illumination, nutrient deprivation and treatment with cytokinins. In contrast, transcripts of OsPK7 were not found in any tissues except in mature leaves at low levels, and did not accumulate under any of the stress conditions examined. A maize gene, ZmPK4, encodes a protein with 518 amino acids that shows 74% similarity to WPK4. Its transcripts were constitutively expressed in all tissues, regardless of light, nutrient and cytokinin status, but were increased upon exposure to low temperature. These results indicate that, despite the sequence similarity between their products, genes for SnRK3 proteins are differentially regulated in response to environmental stimuli.
Gene	Expression analysis of the calcineurin B-like gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.) under environmental stresses	2008	State key lab of crop genetics and germplasm enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, PR China.	Calcium plays a crucial role as a second messenger in mediating various defense responses under environmental stresses. Calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins have been implicated as important Ca2+ sensors in plant-specific calcium signaling. Based on the similarity of sequence, ten CBL genes were identified by searching the rice japonica genome database, which were randomly distribute on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 and 12. By semi-quantitative RT-PCR approach the expression pattern of each gene was detected in various organs at the adult stage and seedlings treated with NaCl, PEG and cold stresses or exogenous ABA. The results showed that the induction of each rice CBL gene was not only responsive to different stress conditions, but also organ specific. In vivo targeting experiment revealed that OsCBL8 localized to the plasma membrane, which was consistent with OsCBL4 and SOS3 previously reported. To elucidate the putative function of OsCBL8 gene, transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsCBL8 gene were generated by the Agrobacterium-mediated approach. The OsCBL8 transgenic rice seedlings showed more tolerance to salt stress than non-transgenic seedlings.
Plant Physiol.	A gibberellin-regulated calcineurin B in rice localizes to the tonoplast and is implicated in vacuole function.	2005	Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720-3102, USA.	Many developmental and environmental signals are transduced through changes in intracellular calcium concentrations, yet only a few calcium-binding proteins have been identified in plants. Calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins are calcium-binding proteins that are thought to function as plant signal transduction elements. RNA profiling using a rice (Oryza sativa cv Nipponbare) oligonucleotide microarray was used to monitor gene expression in de-embryonated rice grains. This analysis showed that a putative rice CBL gene responded to gibberellic acid, but not abscisic acid, treatment. The CBL gene family in rice contains at least 10 genes and these have extensive similarity to the CBLs of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid assays, rice CBLs interact with the kinase partners of Arabidopsis CBLs. Only one rice CBL gene, OsCBL2, is up-regulated by GA in the aleurone layer. A homolog with 91% sequence identity to OsCBL2 was cloned from barley (Hordeum vulgare cv Himalaya), and designated HvCBL2. We examined the localization and function of OsCBL2 and HvCBL2 in rice and barley aleurone because changes in cytosolic calcium have been implicated in the response of the aleurone cell to GA. Green fluorescent protein translational fusions of OsCBL2 and OsCBL3 were localized to the tonoplast of aleurone cell protein storage vacuoles and OsCBL4-green fluorescent protein was localized to the plasma membrane. Data from experiments using antisense expression of OsCBL2 and HvCBL2 are consistent with a role for OsCBL2 in promoting vacuolation of barley aleurone cells following treatment with GA.
J. Biol. Chem.	Phosphorylation of calcineurin B-like (CBL) calcium sensor proteins by their CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) is required for full activity of CBL-CIPK complexes toward their target proteins.	2012	Institut fur Biologie und Biotechnologie der Pflanzen, Universitat Munster, Schlossplatz 4, 48149 Munster, Germany.	Calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs) represent a family of calcium sensor proteins that interact with a group of serine/threonine kinases designated as CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). CBL-CIPK complexes are crucially involved in relaying plant responses to many environmental signals and in regulating ion fluxes. However, the biochemical characterization of CBL-CIPK complexes has so far been hampered by low activities of recombinant CIPKs. Here, we report on an efficient wheat germ extract-based in vitro transcription/translation protocol that yields active full-length wild-type CIPK proteins. We identified a conserved serine residue within the C terminus of CBLs as being phosphorylated by their interacting CIPKs. Remarkably, our studies revealed that CIPK-dependent CBL phosphorylation is strictly dependent on CBL-CIPK interaction via the CIPK NAF domain. The phosphorylation status of CBLs does not appear to influence the stability, localization, or CIPK interaction of these calcium sensor proteins in general. However, proper phosphorylation of CBL1 is absolutely required for the in vivo activation of the AKT1 K(+) channel by CBL1-CIPK23 and CBL9-CIPK23 complexes in oocytes. Moreover, we show that by combining CBL1, CIPK23, and AKT1, we can faithfully reconstitute CBL-dependent enhancement of phosphorylation of target proteins by CIPKs in vitro. In addition, we report that phosphorylation of CBL1 by CIPK23 is also required for the CBL1-dependent enhancement of CIPK23 activity toward its substrate. Together, these data identify a novel general regulatory mechanism of CBL-CIPK complexes in that CBL phosphorylation at their flexible C terminus likely provokes conformational changes that enhance specificity and activity of CBL-CIPK complexes toward their target proteins.
Plant Physiol.	Calcium sensors and their interacting protein kinases: genomics of the Arabidopsis and rice CBL-CIPK signaling networks.	2004	Abteilung Pflanzenphysiologie, Universitat Rostock, Albert-Einstein-Strasse 3, 18051 Rostock, Germany.	Calcium signals mediate a multitude of plant responses to external stimuli and regulate a wide range of physiological processes. Calcium-binding proteins, like calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins, represent important relays in plant calcium signaling. These proteins form a complex network with their target kinases being the CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). Here, we present a comparative genomics analysis of the full complement of CBLs and CIPKs in Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa). We confirm the expression and transcript composition of the 10 CBLs and 25 CIPKs encoded in the Arabidopsis genome. Our identification of 10 CBLs and 30 CIPKs from rice indicates a similar complexity of this signaling network in both species. An analysis of the genomic evolution suggests that the extant number of gene family members largely results from segmental duplications. A phylogenetic comparison of protein sequences and intron positions indicates an early diversification of separate branches within both gene families. These branches may represent proteins with different functions. Protein interaction analyses and expression studies of closely related family members suggest that even recently duplicated representatives may fulfill different functions. This work provides a basis for a defined further functional dissection of this important plant-specific signaling system.

Theor. Appl. Genet.	Targeted association analysis identified japonica rice varieties achieving Na(+)/K (+) homeostasis without the allelic make-up of the salt tolerant indica variety Nona Bokra.	2011	CIRAD, UPR AIVA, 34398 Montpellier, France. Nourollah.ahmadi@cirad.fr	During the last decade, a large number of QTLs and candidate genes for rice tolerance to salinity have been reported. Using 124 SNP and 52 SSR markers, we targeted 14 QTLs and 65 candidate genes for association mapping within the European Rice Core collection (ERCC) comprising 180 japonica accessions. Significant differences in phenotypic response to salinity were observed. Nineteen distinct loci significantly associated with one or more phenotypic response traits were detected. Linkage disequilibrium between these loci was extremely low, indicating a random distribution of favourable alleles in the ERCC. Analysis of the function of these loci indicated that all major tolerance mechanisms were present in the ERCC although the useful level of expression of the different mechanisms was scattered among different accessions. Under moderate salinity stress some accessions achieved the same level of control of Na(+) concentration and Na(+)/K(+) equilibrium as the indica reference variety for salinity tolerance Nona Bokra, although without sharing the same alleles at several loci associated with Na(+) concentration. This suggests (a) differences between indica and japonica subspecies in the effect of QTLs and genes involved in salinity tolerance and (b) further potential for the improvement of tolerance to salinity above the tolerance level of Nona Bokra, provided the underlying mechanisms are complementary at the whole plant level. No accession carried all favourable alleles, or showed the best phenotypic responses for all traits measured. At least nine accessions were needed to assemble the favourable alleles and all the best phenotypic responses. An effective strategy for the accumulation of the favourable alleles would be marker-assisted population improvement.

PLoS ONE	Comparison of ion balance and nitrogen metabolism in old and young leaves of alkali-stressed rice plants.	2012	Key laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of MOE, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, Jilin Province, China.	BACKGROUND: Alkali stress is an important agricultural contaminant and has complex effects on plant metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the alkali stress has different effects on the growth, ion balance, and nitrogen metabolism in old and young leaves of rice plants, and to compare functions of both organs in alkali tolerance. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The results showed that alkali stress only produced a small effect on the growth of young leaves, whereas strongly damaged old leaves. Rice protected young leaves from ion harm via the large accumulation of Na(+) and Cl(-) in old leaves. The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsAKT1, OsHAK1, OsHAK7, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 may contribute to the larger accumulation of Na(+) in old leaves under alkali stress. Alkali stress mightily reduced the NO(3)(-) contents in both organs. As old leaf cells have larger vacuole, under alkali stress these scarce NO(3)(-) was principally stored in old leaves. Accordingly, the expression of OsNRT1;1 and OsNRT1;2 in old leaves was up-regulated by alkali stress, revealing that the two genes might contribute to the accumulation of NO(3)(-) in old leaves. NO(3)(-) deficiency in young leaves under alkali stress might induce the reduction in OsNR1 expression and the subsequent lacking of NH(4)(+), which might be main reason for the larger down-regulation of OsFd-GOGAT and OsGS2 in young leaves. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results strongly indicated that, during adaptation of rice to alkali stress, young and old leaves have distinct mechanisms of ion balance and nitrogen metabolism regulation. We propose that the comparative studies of young and old tissues may be important for abiotic stress tolerance research.
