BMC Plant Biol.	Classification of rice (Oryza sativa L. Japonica nipponbare) immunophilins (FKBPs, CYPs) and expression patterns under water stress.	2010	Plant Systems Engineering Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Daejeon 305-506, Korea.	BACKGROUND: FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs) and cyclophilins (CYPs) are abundant and ubiquitous proteins belonging to the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) superfamily, which regulate much of metabolism through a chaperone or an isomerization of proline residues during protein folding. They are collectively referred to as immunophilin (IMM), being present in almost all cellular organs. In particular, a number of IMMs relate to environmental stresses. RESULTS: FKBP and CYP proteins in rice (Oryza sativa cv. Japonica) were identified and classified, and given the appropriate name for each IMM, considering the ortholog-relation with Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas or molecular weight of the proteins. 29 FKBP and 27 CYP genes can putatively be identified in rice; among them, a number of genes can be putatively classified as orthologs of Arabidopsis IMMs. However, some genes were novel, did not match with those of Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas, and several genes were paralogs by genetic duplication. Among 56 IMMs in rice, a significant number are regulated by salt and/or desiccation stress. In addition, their expression levels responding to the water-stress have been analyzed in different tissues, and some subcellular IMMs located by means of tagging with GFP protein. CONCLUSION: Like other green photosynthetic organisms such as Arabidopsis (23 FKBPs and 29 CYPs) and Chlamydomonas (23 FKBs and 26 CYNs), rice has the highest number of IMM genes among organisms reported so far, suggesting that the numbers relate closely to photosynthesis. Classification of the putative FKBPs and CYPs in rice provides the information about their evolutional/functional significance when comparisons are drawn with the relatively well studied genera, Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas. In addition, many of the genes upregulated by water stress offer the possibility of manipulating the stress responses in rice.
Commun Integr Biol	Multiple abiotic stress responsive rice cyclophilin: (OsCYP-25) mediates a wide range of cellular responses.	2013	Plant Molecular Biology Group; International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology; Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, India.	Cyclophilins (CYP), a member of immunophillin group of proteins, are more often conserved in all genera including plants. Here, we report on the identification of a new cyclophilin gene OsCYP-25 (LOC_Os09 g39780) from rice which found to be upregulated in response to various abiotic stresses viz., salinity, cold, heat and drought. It has an ORF of 540 bp, encoding a protein of 179 amino acids, consisting of PPIase domain, which is highly conserved. The OsCYP-25 promoter analysis revealed that different cis-regulatory elements (e.g., MYBCORE, MYC, CBFHV, GT1GMSCAM4, DRECRTCOREAT, CCAATBOX1, WRKY71OS and WBOXATNPR1) are involved to mediate OsCYP-25 response under stress. We have also predicted interacting partners by STRING software. In interactome, protein partners includes WD domain containing protein, the 60S ribosome subunit biogenesis protein, the ribosomal protein L10, the DEAD-box helicase, the EIF-2alpha, YT521-B protein, the 60S ribosomal protein and the PPR repeat domain containing protein. The in silico analysis showed that OsCYP-25 interacts with different proteins involved in cell growth, differentiation, ribosome biogenesis, RNA metabolism, RNA editing, gene expression, signal transduction or stress response. These findings suggest that OsCYP-25 might perform an important function in mediating wide range of cellular response under multiple abiotic stresses.
Plant Cell Rep.	The rice thylakoid lumenal cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 confers enhanced environmental stress tolerance in tobacco and Arabidopsis.	2011	Plant Systems Engineering Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Daejeon, 305-806, Korea.	The role that the putative thylakoid lumenal cyclophilin (CYP) CYP20-2 locates in the thylakoid, and whether CYP20-2 is an essential gene, have not yet been elucidated. Here, we show that CYP20-2 is well conserved in several photosynthetic plants and that the transcript level of the rice OsCYP20-2 gene is highly regulated under abiotic stress. We found that ectopic expression of rice OsCYP20-2 in both tobacco and Arabidopsis confers enhanced tolerance to osmotic stress and extremely high light. Based on these results, we suggest that although the exact biochemical function of OsCYP20-2 in the thylakoid lumen (TL) remains unclear, it may be involved in photosynthetic acclimation to help plants cope with environmental stress; the OsCYP20-2 gene may be a candidate for enhancing multiple abiotic stress tolerance.
BMC Genomics	Genomic survey, expression profile and co-expression network analysis of OsWD40 family in rice.	2012	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research Wuhan, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	BACKGROUND: WD40 proteins represent a large family in eukaryotes, which have been involved in a broad spectrum of crucial functions. Systematic characterization and co-expression analysis of OsWD40 genes enable us to understand the networks of the WD40 proteins and their biological processes and gene functions in rice. RESULTS: In this study, we identify and analyze 200 potential OsWD40 genes in rice, describing their gene structures, genome localizations, and evolutionary relationship of each member. Expression profiles covering the whole life cycle in rice has revealed that transcripts of OsWD40 were accumulated differentially during vegetative and reproductive development and preferentially up or down-regulated in different tissues. Under phytohormone treatments, 25 OsWD40 genes were differentially expressed with treatments of one or more of the phytohormone NAA, KT, or GA3 in rice seedlings. We also used a combined analysis of expression correlation and Gene Ontology annotation to infer the biological role of the OsWD40 genes in rice. The results suggested that OsWD40 genes may perform their diverse functions by complex network, thus were predictive for understanding their biological pathways. The analysis also revealed that OsWD40 genes might interact with each other to take part in metabolic pathways, suggesting a more complex feedback network. CONCLUSIONS: All of these analyses suggest that the functions of OsWD40 genes are diversified, which provide useful references for selecting candidate genes for further functional studies.
