Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) is involved in the final step of the phenylpropanod pathway, catalyzing the NADPH-dependent reduction of hydroxy-cinnamaldehydes into the corresponding alcohols. The rice genome contains twelve CAD and CAD-like genes, collectively called OsCADs. To elucidate the biochemical function of the OsCADs, OsCAD1, 2, 6, and 7, which are highly expressed in rice, were cloned from rice tissues. The cloned OsCADs were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli as His-tag fusion proteins. The activity assay of the recombinant OsCADs showed that OsCAD2, 6, and 7 have CAD activity toward hydroxycinnamaldehydes, but OsCAD1 has no detectable catalytic activity. The kinetic parameters of the enzyme reactions demonstrated that OsCAD2 has the highest catalytic activity among the examined enzymes. This result agrees well with the finding that the Zn binding and NADPH binding motifs and the residues constituting the substrate binding pocket in bona fide plant CADs were fully conserved in OsCAD2. Although they have large variations in the residue for the substrate binding pocket, OsCAD6 and 7 catalyzed the reduction of hydroxycinnamaldehydes with a similar efficiency. Alignment of amino acid sequences showed that OsCAD1 lacks the GxxxxP motif for NADPH binding and has mismatches in residues important in the reduction process, which could be responsible for the loss of catalytic activity. OsCAD2 belongs to CAD Class I with bona fide CADs from other plant species and is constitutively expressed throughout the developmental stages of rice, with preferential expression in actively lignifying tissues such as the root, stem, and panicle, suggesting that it is mainly involved in developmental lignification in rice. The expression of OsCAD2 was also induced by biotic and abiotic stresses such as Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) infection and UV-irradiation, suggesting that it plays a role in the defense response of rice, in addition to a bona fide role in developmental lignification. OsCAD6 and 7 belong in CAD Class II. Their expression is relatively lower than that of OsCAD2 and is confined to certain tissues, such as the leaf sheath, stem, and panicle. The expression of OsCAD6 was stimulated by Xoo infection and UV-irradiation. Thus OsCAD6 appears to be an inducible OsCAD that is likely involved in the defense response of rice against biotic and abiotic stresses.
