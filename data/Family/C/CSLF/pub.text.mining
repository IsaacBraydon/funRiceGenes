Taken together,          Os05g0176100; OsCesA2, Os03g0808100; OsCesA3, these results suggest that this region of CesA is essential for    Os07g0424400; OsCesA5, Os03g0837100; OsCesA6, proper cellulose synthesis in secondary cell walls of both         Os07g0252400; OsCesA8, Os07g0208500; OsCslA1, Arabidopsis and rice. Supporting this hypothesis, the region       Os02g0192500; OsCslC1, Os01g0766900; OsCslD1, was found to be highly conserved among all CesAs of rice           Os10g0578200; OsCslE1, Os09g0478100; OsCslF1, (Fig. 3B).
