BMC Genomics.	Genome-wide analysis of CCCH zinc finger family in Arabidopsis and rice.	2008	State Key Laboratory of Crop Biology, College of Life Sciences, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, Shandong 271018, PR China. ideal.sam@gmail.com	BACKGROUND: Genes in the CCCH family encode zinc finger proteins containing the motif with three cysteines and one histidine residues. They have been known to play important roles in RNA processing as RNA-binding proteins in animals. To date, few plant CCCH proteins have been studied functionally. RESULTS: In this study, a comprehensive computational analysis identified 68 and 67 CCCH family genes in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively. A complete overview of this gene family in Arabidopsis was presented, including the gene structures, phylogeny, protein motifs, and chromosome locations. In addition, a comparative analysis between these genes in Arabidopsis and rice was performed. These results revealed that the CCCH families in Arabidopsis and rice were divided into 11 and 8 subfamilies, respectively. The gene duplication contributed to the expansion of the CCCH gene family in Arabidopsis genome. Expression studies indicated that CCCH proteins exhibit a variety of expression patterns, suggesting diverse functions. Finally, evolutionary analysis showed that one subfamily is higher plant specific. The expression profile indicated that most members of this subfamily are regulated by abiotic or biotic stresses, suggesting that they could have an effective role in stress tolerance. CONCLUSION: Our comparative genomics analysis of CCCH genes and encoded proteins in two model plant species provides the first step towards the functional dissection of this emerging family of potential RNA-binding proteins.

Plant Physiol.	The Arabidopsis tandem zinc finger protein AtTZF1 traffics between the nucleus and cytoplasmic foci and binds both DNA and RNA.	2010	Department of Horticulture and Crop Science, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.	Processing bodies (PBs) are specialized cytoplasmic foci where mRNA turnover and translational repression can take place. Stress granules are related cytoplasmic foci. The CCCH tandem zinc finger proteins (TZFs) play pivotal roles in gene expression, cell fate specification, and various developmental processes. Human TZF binds AU-rich elements at the 3' untranslated region and recruits decapping, deadenylation, and exonucleolytic enzymes to PBs for RNA turnover. Recent genetic studies indicate that plant TZFs are involved in gene regulation and hormone-mediated environmental responses. It is unknown if plant TZFs can bind RNA and be localized to PBs or stress granules. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtTZF1/AtCTH/AtC3H23 was identified as a sugar-sensitive gene in a previous microarray study. It is characterized by a TZF motif that is distinct from the human TZF. Higher plants such as Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa) each have a gene family containing this unique TZF motif. Here, we show that AtTZF1 can traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasmic foci. AtTZF1 colocalizes with markers of PBs, and the morphology of these cytoplasmic foci resembles that of mammalian PBs and stress granules. AtTZF1-associated cytoplasmic foci are dynamic and tissue specific. They can be induced by dark and wound stresses and are preferentially present in actively growing tissues and stomatal precursor cells. Since AtTZF1 can bind both DNA and RNA in vitro, it raises the possibility that AtTZF1 might be involved in DNA and/or RNA regulation.

DNA Res.	Comprehensive Analysis of the Rice RING E3 Ligase Family Reveals Their Functional Diversity in Response to Abiotic stress.	2013	Department of Applied Plant Sciences Technology, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 200-713, Republic of Korea.	A large number of really interesting new gene (RING) E3 ligases contribute to the post-translational modification of target proteins during plant responses to environmental stresses. However, the physical interactome of RING E3 ligases in rice remains largely unknown. Here, we evaluated the expression patterns of 47 Oryza sativa RING finger protein (OsRFP) genes in response to abiotic stresses via semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in silico analysis. Subsequently, molecular dissection of nine OsRFPs was performed by the examination of their E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, subcellular localization, and physical interaction with target proteins. Most of the OsRFPs examined possessed E3 ligase activity and showed diverse subcellular localization. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was then employed to construct a physical interaction map of seven OsRFPs with their 120 interacting proteins. The results indicated that these OsRFPs required dynamic translocation and partitioning for their cellular activation. Heterogeneous overexpression of each of the OsRFP genes in Arabidopsis suggested that they have functionally diverse responses to abiotic stresses, which may have been acquired during evolution. This comprehensive study provides insights into the biological functions of OsRFPs, which may be useful in understanding how rice plants adapt to unfavourable environmental conditions.
BMC Genomics	Genomic survey, expression profile and co-expression network analysis of OsWD40 family in rice.	2012	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research Wuhan, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	BACKGROUND: WD40 proteins represent a large family in eukaryotes, which have been involved in a broad spectrum of crucial functions. Systematic characterization and co-expression analysis of OsWD40 genes enable us to understand the networks of the WD40 proteins and their biological processes and gene functions in rice. RESULTS: In this study, we identify and analyze 200 potential OsWD40 genes in rice, describing their gene structures, genome localizations, and evolutionary relationship of each member. Expression profiles covering the whole life cycle in rice has revealed that transcripts of OsWD40 were accumulated differentially during vegetative and reproductive development and preferentially up or down-regulated in different tissues. Under phytohormone treatments, 25 OsWD40 genes were differentially expressed with treatments of one or more of the phytohormone NAA, KT, or GA3 in rice seedlings. We also used a combined analysis of expression correlation and Gene Ontology annotation to infer the biological role of the OsWD40 genes in rice. The results suggested that OsWD40 genes may perform their diverse functions by complex network, thus were predictive for understanding their biological pathways. The analysis also revealed that OsWD40 genes might interact with each other to take part in metabolic pathways, suggesting a more complex feedback network. CONCLUSIONS: All of these analyses suggest that the functions of OsWD40 genes are diversified, which provide useful references for selecting candidate genes for further functional studies.
J. Biol. Chem.	Multiple forms of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor U2AF subunits expressed in higher plants.	1998	Friedrich Miescher-Institut, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.	Requirements for intron recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in plants differ from those in vertebrates and yeast. Plant introns contain neither conserved branch points nor distinct 3' splice site-proximal polypyrimidine tracts characteristic of the yeast and vertebrate introns, respectively. However, they are strongly enriched in U residues throughout the intron, property essential for splicing. To understand the roles of different sequence elements in splicing, we are characterizing proteins involved in intron recognition in plants. In this work we show that Nicotiana plumbaginifolia, a dicotyledonous plant, contains two genes encoding different homologs of the large 50-65-kDa subunit of the polypyrimidine tract binding factor U2AF, characterized previously in animals and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Both plant U2AF65 isoforms, referred to as NpU2AF65a and NpU2AF65b, support splicing of an adenovirus pre-mRNA in HeLa cell nuclear extracts depleted of the endogenous U2AF factor. Both proteins interact with RNA fragments containing plant introns and show affinity for poly(U) and, to a lesser extend, poly(C) and poly(G). The branch point or the 3' splice site regions do not contribute significantly to intron recognition by NpU2AF65. The existence of multiple isoforms of U2AF may be quite general in plants because two genes expressing U2AF65 have been identified in Arabidopsis, and different isoforms of the U2AF small subunit are expressed in rice.
Plant Physiol.	Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type Ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis.	2011	Plant Functional Genomics Research Group, RIKEN, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 230-0045, Japan.	Ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase (FNR) mediates electron transfer between ferredoxin (Fd) and NADP(+); therefore, it is a key enzyme that provides the reducing power used in the Calvin cycle. Other than FNR, nitrite reductase, sulfite reductase, glutamate synthase, and Fd-thioredoxin reductase also accept electrons from Fd, an electron carrier protein in the stroma. Therefore, the regulation of electron partitioning in the chloroplast is important for photosynthesis and other metabolic pathways. The regulatory mechanism of electron partitioning, however, remains to be elucidated. We found, by taking advantage of a gain-of-function approach, that expression of two rice (Oryza sativa) full-length cDNAs of leaf-type FNRs (OsLFNR1 and OsLFNR2) led to altered chlorophyll fluorescence and growth in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice. We revealed that overexpression of the OsLFNR1 and OsLFNR2 full-length cDNAs resulted in distinct phenotypes despite the high sequence similarity between them. Expression of OsLFNR1 affected the nitrogen assimilation pathway without inhibition of photosynthesis under normal conditions. On the other hand, OsLFNR2 expression led to the impairment of photosynthetic linear electron transport as well as Fd-dependent cyclic electron flow around photosystem I. The endogenous protein level of OsLFNR was found to be suppressed in both OsLFNR1- and OsLFNR2-overexpressing rice plants, leading to changes in the stoichiometry of the two LFNR isoforms within the thylakoid and soluble fractions. Thus, we propose that the stoichiometry of two LFNR isoforms plays an important role in electron partitioning between carbon fixation and nitrogen assimilation.
