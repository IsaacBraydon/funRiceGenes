Genome	Distribution, structure, organ-specific expression, and phylogenic analysis of the pathogenesis-related protein-3 chitinase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Laboratory of Plant Breeding, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) pathogenesis-related (PR)-3 chitinases, like other PR proteins, are each coded by one of the genes of a multigene family in the plant genome. We assembled the database information about rice PR-3 chitinase sequences. A total of 12 PR-3 chitinase loci (Cht1 to Cht12) were found deployed in the rice genome. Some of the loci were occupied by 2 or more alleles. For all the loci expect Cht4, Cht5, Cht6, and Cht11, the amino acid sequence was polymorphic between japonica and indica varieties of rice, but glutamic acid acting as a catalytic residue was completely conserved in all the loci expect Cht7. All the genes except Cht7, which was not tested in this study, were transcripted in some organs (leaf, sheath, root, and meristem) of rice plants. These results suggest that chitinase proteins encoded by the genes at these loci have important biological effects, at least antifungal activities, on rice plants. We also proposed a new classification of rice PR-3 chitinases based on their domain structures. This classification was consistent with the results of phylogenetic analysis of rice chitinases.

Plant Mol. Biol.	A new class II rice chitinase, Rcht2, whose induction by fungal elicitor is abolished by protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitor.	1998	Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Research Center, Gyeongsang National University, Chinju, Korea.	Among the four classes of chitinase, a class II chitinase had not yet been reported for rice. We have isolated and characterized a class II acidic chitinase, Rcht2, from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Cheongcheongbyeo). The protein consists of a single polypeptide chain of 261 amino acid residues and includes a putative signal sequence of 29 amino acids at its N-terminus. It has a calculated molecular mass of 27,642 Da and an isoelectric point of 5.56. The Rcht2 chitinase lacks the cysteine-rich and hinge domains in the N-terminal region of the protein, which is the criterion for its classification as a class II chitinase. Comparison of the genomic and the cDNA sequence revealed that the coding region of Rcht2 consist of three exons of 301, 112, and 370 bp separated by two introns of 89 and 984 bp. In suspension-cultured rice cells, the transcript level of Rcht2 was dramatically increased by treatment with both glycol chitin and fungal elicitor. The application of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors, calyculin A and okadaic acid, effectively abolished the induction of Rcht2 in response to fungal elicitor. In contrast, the activation of Rcht2 transcript was not inhibited by both cycloheximide and protein kinase inhibitors. These results demonstrate that protein dephosphorylation events play a crucial role in the elicitor-mediated induction of Rcht2 in rice cells, while de novo protein synthesis is not required for induction.
