Plant Cell Physiol.	Genome-wide identification of the rice calcium-dependent protein kinase and its closely related kinase gene families: comprehensive analysis of the CDPKs gene family in rice.	2005	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602 Japan.	In plants, calcium acts as a universal second messenger in various signal transduction pathways. The plant-specific calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) play important roles regulating downstream components of calcium signaling. We conducted a genome-wide analysis of rice CDPKs and identified 29 CDPK genes and eight closely related kinase genes, including five CDPK-related kinases (CRKs), one calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) and two phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase kinase-related kinases (PEPRKs). The mRNA splicing sites of the rice CDPKs, CRKs and PEPRKs (but not OsCCaMK) are highly conserved, suggesting that these kinases are derived from a common ancestor. RNA gel blot analyses revealed that the majority of rice CDPK genes exhibited tissue-specific expression. Expression of OsCPK9 was elevated in seedlings infected by rice blast, indicating that this gene plays an important role in signaling in response to rice blast treatment. Our genomic and bioinformatic analyses will provide an important foundation for further functional dissection of the rice CDPK gene family.
Mol. Genet. Genomics	Expression analysis of calcium-dependent protein kinase gene family during reproductive development and abiotic stress conditions in rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica).	2007	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, Benito Juarez Road, New Delhi, 110021, India.	Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are important sensors of Ca(+2) flux in plants, which control plant development and responses by regulating downstream components of calcium signaling pathways. Availability of the whole genome sequence and microarray platform allows investigation of genome-wide organization and expression profile of CDPK genes in rice with a view to ultimately define their function in plant systems. Genome-wide analysis led to identification of 31 CDPK genes in rice after a thorough annotation exercise based upon HMM profiles. Twenty-nine already identified CDPK genes were verified and two new members were added to the CDPK gene family of rice. Relative expression of all these genes has been analyzed by using Affymetrix rice genome arraytrade mark during three vegetative stages, six stages of panicle (P1-P6) and five stages of seed (S1-S5) development along with three abiotic stress conditions, viz. cold, salt and desiccation, given to seedling. Thirty-one CDPK genes were found to express in at least one of the experimental stages studied. Of these, transcripts for twenty three genes accumulated differentially during reproductive developmental stages; nine of them were preferentially up-regulated only in panicle, five were up-regulated in stages of panicles as well as seed development, whereas, expression of one gene was found to be specific to the S1 stage of seed development. Eight genes were found to be down-regulated during the panicle and seed developmental stages. Six CDPK genes were found to be induced while the expression of one gene was down-regulated under stress conditions. The differential expression of CDPK genes during reproductive development and stress is suggestive of their involvement in the underlying signal transduction pathways. Furthermore, up-regulation of common genes both during reproductive development as well as stress responses is indicative of common element between reproduction and stress.
Plant Mol. Biol.	Rice gene expression in response to N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor: comprehensive analysis by DNA microarray with randomly selected ESTs.	2003	Department of Biochemistry, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba 305-8602, Japan. akimotoc@nias.affrc.go.jp	N-acetylchitooligosaccharides are potent elicitors to suspension-cultured rice cells, inducing a set of defense reactions. Expression of defense-related genes is considered to play an important role in defense reactions, and we employed microarray analysis of 8987 randomly selected expressed sequence tags to analyze the changes in gene expression caused by N-acetylchitooctaose. In this experiment, 166 genes were significantly induced and 93 genes were repressed. RNA gel blot analysis of 16 of these genes confirmed the microarray results. Of the 259 ESTs identified as responsive to N-acetylchytooctaose, 18 genes are related to signal transduction, including five calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs). Among these, three novel CDPKs responsive to N-acetylchitooctaose were isolated.
Plant Cell Physiol.	OIP30, a RuvB-Like DNA Helicase 2, is a Potential Substrate for the Pollen-Predominant OsCPK25/26 in Rice	2011	Graduate Institute of Biotechnology, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, 40227 ROC.	Calcium ions are a well-known essential component for pollen germination and tube elongation. Several calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are expressed predominantly in mature pollen grains and play a critical role in pollen. However, none of their interacting proteins or downstream substrates has been identified. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we isolated OsCPK25/26-interacting protein 30 (OIP30), which is also predominantly expressed in pollen. OIP30 encodes a RuvB-like DNA helicase 2 (RuvBL2) that is well conserved in eukaryotic species from yeast to human. Yeast and Drosophila defective in RuvBL2 are non-viable. The interaction between OsCPK26 and OIP30 was confirmed by far-Western blot and pull-down experiments. OIP30 was phosphorylated in a calcium-dependent manner by OsCPK26 but not OsCPK2, which is highly similar to OsCPK26 in sequence and expression profile. OIP30 unwound partial duplex DNA with a 3' to 5' directionality by ATP hydrolysis. Concurrently, the ATPase activity of OIP30 depended on single-stranded DNA. OsCPK26 phosphorylated OIP30 and enhanced both its helicase and ATPase activity about 3-fold. OIP30 may be the potential downstream substrate for OsCPK25/26 in pollen. This report characterizes a RuvBL in plants and links its activities with its upstream regulator.
BMC Plant Biology	A rice calcium-dependent protein kinase is expressed in cortical root cells during the presymbiotic phase of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis	2011	Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics CSIC-IRTA-UAB, Department of Molecular Genetics, Campus UAB, Edifici CRAG, Bellaterra (Cerdanyola del Valles) 08193 Barcelona, Spain.	BACKGROUND: The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis consists of a mutualistic relationship between soil fungi and roots of most plant species. This association provides the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus with sugars while the fungus improves the uptake of water and mineral nutrients in the host plant. Then, the establishment of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis requires the fine tuning of host gene expression for recognition and accommodation of the fungal symbiont. In plants, calcium plays a key role as second messenger during developmental processes and responses to environmental stimuli. Even though calcium transients are known to occur in host cells during the AM symbiosis, the decoding of the calcium signal and the molecular events downstream are only poorly understood. RESULTS: The expression of seventeen Calcium-dependent Protein Kinase (CPK) genes representative of the four distinct phylogenetic groups of rice CPKs was monitored during the presymbiotic phase of the AM symbiosis. Among them, OsCPK18 and OsCPK4, were found to be transcriptionally activated in response to inoculation with the AM fungus Glomus intraradices. OsCPK18 and OsCPK4 gene expression was also up-regulated by fungal-produced diffusible molecules. Laser microdissection revealed expression of OsCPK18 in cortical cells, and not in epidermal cells of G. intraradices-inoculated rice roots, suggesting a preferential role of this gene in the root cortex. Moreover, a plasma membrane localization of OsCPK18 was observed by transient expression assays of green fluorescent protein-tagged OsCPK18 in onion epidermal cells. We also show that the myristoylation site of the OsCPK18 N-terminus is required for plasma membrane targeting. CONCLUSION: The rapid activation of OsCPK18 expression in response to AM inoculation, its expression being also induced by fungal-secreted signals, together with the observed plasma membrane localization of OsCPK18, points to a role for OsCPK18 in perception of the AM fungus. The OsCPK18 gene might be considered as a marker for the presymbiotic phase of the symbiotic process. These findings provide a better understanding of the signaling mechanisms operating during the AM symbiosis and will greatly facilitate their molecular dissection.
Mol. Cells	Rice small C2-domain proteins are phosphorylated by calcium-dependent protein kinase.	2013	Division of Applied Life Sciences (Brain Korea 21 Program), Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Research Center, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 660-701, Korea.	We previously reported that OsERG1 and OsERG3 encode rice small C2-domain proteins with different biochemical properties in Ca(2+)- and phospholipid-binding assays. Os-ERG1 exhibited Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid binding, which was not observed with OsERG3. In the present study, we show that both OsERG1 and OsERG3 proteins exhibit oligomerization properties as determined by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments. Furthermore, in vitro phosphorylation assays reveal the phosphorylation of OsERG1 and OsERG3 by a rice calcium-dependent protein kinase, OsCDPK5. Our mutation analysis on putative serine phosphorylation sites shows that the first serine (Ser) at position 41 of OsERG1 may be an essential residue for phosphorylation by OsCDPK5. Mutation of Ser41 to alanine (OsERG1S41A) and aspartate (OsERG1S41D) abolishes the ability of OsERG1 to bind phospholipids regardless of the presence or absence of Ca(2+) ions. In addition, unlike the OsERG1 wild-type form, the mutant OsERG1 (S41A)::smGFP construct lost the ability to translocate from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in response to calcium ions or fungal elicitor. These results indicate that Ser41 may be essential for the function of OsERG1.
Plant Mol. Biol.	Molecular cloning of two novel rice cDNA sequences encoding putative calcium-dependent protein kinases.	1995	Istituto Biosintesi Vegetali, C.N.R., Milan, Italy.	We have isolated, from a cDNA library constructed from rice coleoptiles, two sequences, OSCPK2 and OSCPK11, that encode for putative calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) proteins. OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 cDNAs are related to SPK, another gene encoding a rice CDPK that is specifically expressed in developing seeds [20]. OSCPK2 and OSCPK11-predicted protein sequences are 533 and 542 amino acids (aa) long with a corresponding molecular mass of 59436 and 61079 Da respectively. Within their polypeptide chain, they all contain those conserved features that define a plant CDPK; kinase catalytic sequences are linked to a calmodulin-like regulatory domain through a junction region. The calmodulin-like regulatory domain of the predicted OSCPK2 protein contains 4 EF-hand calcium-binding sites while OSCPK11 has conserved just one canonical EF-hand motif. In addition, OSCPK2- and OSCPK11-predicted proteins contain, at their N-terminal region preceding the catalytic domain, a stretch of 80 or 74 residues highly rich in hydrophilic amino acids. Comparison of the NH2-terminal sequence of all three rice CDPKs so far identified (OSCPK2, OSCPK11 and SPK) indicates the presence of a conserved MGxxC(S/Q)xxT motif that may define a consensus signal for N-myristoylation. OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 proteins are both encoded by a single-copy gene and their polyadenylated transcripts are 2.4 and 3.5 kb long respectively. OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 mRNAs are equally abundant in rice roots and coleoptiles. A 12 h white light treatment of the coleoptiles reduces the amount of OSCPK2 mRNA with only a slight effect on the level of OSCPK11 transcript. With anoxic treatments, OSCPK2 mRNA level declined significantly and promptly while the amount of OSCPK11 transcript remained constant.
