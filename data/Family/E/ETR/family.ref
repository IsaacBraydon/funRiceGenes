J Exp Bot	Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions.	2004	Department of Botany, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.	Five ethylene receptor genes, OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 were isolated and characterized from rice. The genomic structure of OS-ERS1 and OS-ERS2 revealed that the introns within the coding sequences occurred in conserved positions to those of At-ETR1 and At-ERS1, whereas each of the OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 genes contained 1 intron within its coding region located at a position equivalent to those of At-ERS2, At-ETR2, and At-EIN4. Deduced amino acid sequences of OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 showed that they exhibited significant homology to the prokaryotic two-component signal transducer and a wide range of ethylene receptors in a variety of plant species. Northern analysis revealed that the level of OS-ETR2 mRNA was markedly elevated either by the exogenous application of IAA or by ethylene treatment in young etiolated rice seedlings, whereas the OS-ERS1 transcript level was only slightly induced under the same experimental conditions. Pretreatment with silver prevented IAA-induced and ethylene-induced accumulation of both mRNAs (OS-ERS1 and OS-ETR2). However, the abundance of OS-ERS2 mRNA was shown to be down-regulated by both IAA and ethylene treatments, indicating that it was not positively regulated by ethylene. Analysis of the expression of the three ethylene receptor genes in different tissues of rice has unravelled their corresponding tissue-specificity in which OS-ERS1 was constitutively expressed in considerable amounts in all tissues studied, while OS-ERS2 and OS-ETR2 exhibited differential expression patterns in different tissues of rice. Moreover, higher levels of these three mRNAs were commonly observed in anthers when compared with their corresponding levels in other tissues, suggesting the important role played by ethylene involved in the regulation of pollen development in rice. Among the five ethylene receptor genes, the expression levels of both OS-ETR3 and OS-ETR4 were too low to be detected by the northern blot analysis. Results from RT-PCR illustrated that both mRNAs were present in young green rice seedlings and anthers.
