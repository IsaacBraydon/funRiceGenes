Plant Physiol.	Expression of beta-expansins is correlated with internodal elongation in deepwater rice.	2001	Department of Energy Plant Research Laboratory, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824-1312, USA.	Fourteen putative rice (Oryza sativa) beta-expansin genes, Os-EXPB1 through Os-EXPB14, were identified in the expressed sequence tag and genomic databases. The DNA and deduced amino acid sequences are highly conserved in all 14 beta-expansins. They have a series of conserved C (cysteine) residues in the N-terminal half of the protein, an HFD (histidine-phenylalanine-aspartate) motif in the central region, and a series of W (tryptophan) residues near the carboxyl terminus. Five beta-expansin genes are expressed in deepwater rice internodes, with especially high transcript levels in the growing region. Expression of four beta-expansin genes in the internode was induced by treatment with gibberellin and by wounding. The wound response resulted from excising stem sections or from piercing pinholes into the stem of intact plants. The level of wound-induced beta-expansin transcripts declined rapidly 5 h after cutting of stem sections. We conclude that the expression of beta-expansin genes is correlated with rapid elongation of deepwater rice internodes, it is induced by gibberellin and wounding, and wound-induced beta-expansin mRNA appears to turn over rapidly.
Curr. Opin. Plant Biol.	Expansins: ever-expanding numbers and functions.	2001	MSU-DOE Plant Research Laboratory, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824, USA.	Expansins were first identified as cell-wall-loosening proteins that, at least in part, mediate pH-dependent extension of the plant cell wall and growth of the cell. More recently, it has been realized that expansins belong to two protein families, the alpha-and beta-expansins, and that they appear to be involved in regulating, besides cell expansion, a variety of plant processes, including morphogenesis, softening of fruits, and growth of the pollen tube of grasses through the stigma and the style. The Arabidopsis genome contains 26 alpha-expansin genes and the rice genome at least 26. There are more beta-expansin genes in monocots than in dicots, at least 14 in rice and five in Arabidopsis. Expansin genes are differentially regulated by environmental and hormonal signals, and hormonal regulatory elements have been found in their promoter regions. An analysis of exon/intron structure led to the hypothesis that alpha-and beta-expansins evolved from a common ancestral gene.
Ann. Bot.	Cell division and cell elongation in the coleoptile of rice alcohol dehydrogenase 1-deficient mutant are reduced under complete submergence.	2011	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: When rice seeds germinate under complete submergence, only the coleoptile elongates efficiently. It has been reported previously that coleoptile elongation is reduced in the rice alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1)-deficient mutant, reduced adh activity (rad). The aim of this study was to elucidate how expressions of genes responsible for coleoptile elongation are affected by the ADH1 deficiency in the rad mutant under submergence. METHODS: To identify genes whose expressions are changed in the rad coleoptile at an early stage in germination (i.e. 1 d after imbibition), coleoptiles of the rad mutant and its wild type (WT) were isolated by laser microdissection, and their mRNA levels were examined with a microarray. KEY RESULTS: The microarray analysis identified 431 genes whose transcript levels were different between rad and WT. Interestingly, among the down-regulated genes in the rad coleoptile, 17.5 % were cell division-related genes and 5.1 % were cell elongation-related genes. It was found that cell division started at 1 d after imbibition and then gradually ceased, whereas in the WT coleoptile cell elongation started between 1 d and 2 d after imbibition and then continued. However, neither cell division nor cell elongation actively occurred in the rad coleoptile, in which the amounts of ATP were reduced. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that cell division, as well as cell elongation, occur during coleoptile elongation in rice under complete submergence, and that the reduced ATP levels caused by the ADH1 deficiency repress both of them, thereby impairing coleoptile elongation in the rad mutant under submerged conditions.
Plant Physiol.	Transcript Profiling of the Anoxic Rice Coleoptile.	2007	Plant and Crop Physiology Laboratory, Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, 56124 Pisa, Italy.	Rice (Oryza sativa) seeds can germinate in the complete absence of oxygen. Under anoxia, the rice coleoptile elongates, reaching a length greater than that of the aerobic one. In this article, we compared and investigated the transcriptome of rice coleoptiles grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The results allow drawing a detailed picture of the modulation of the transcripts involved in anaerobic carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting up-regulation of the steps required to produce and metabolize pyruvate and its derivatives. Sugars appear to play a signaling role under anoxia, with several genes indirectly up-regulated by anoxia-driven sugar starvation. Analysis of the effects of anoxia on the expansin gene families revealed that EXPA7 and EXPB12 are likely to be involved in rice coleoptile elongation under anoxia. Genes coding for ethylene response factors and heat shock proteins are among the genes modulated by anoxia in both rice and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Identification of anoxia-induced ethylene response factors is suggestive because genes belonging to this gene family play a crucial role in rice tolerance to submergence, a process closely related to, but independent from, the ability to germinate under anoxia. Genes coding for some enzymes requiring oxygen for their activity are dramatically down-regulated under anoxia, suggesting the existence of an energy-saving strategy in the regulation of gene expression.
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.	Group I allergens of grass pollen as cell wall-loosening agents.	1997	Department of Biology, 208 Mueller Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA. dcosgrove@psu.edu	Group I allergens are the major allergens of grass pollen, but their biological function is unknown. These proteins are shown here to be structurally related to expansins, which are able to induce extension (creep) of plant cell walls. Extracts of maize pollen possess potent expansin-like activity, as measured in wall extension and wall stress-relaxation assays. This activity is selective for grass cell walls and is, at least partly, due to the action of maize group I allergens. We propose that group I allergens facilitate invasion of the pollen tube into the maternal tissues by loosening the cell walls of the grass stigma and style. Additionally, the presence of related mRNAs in vegetative tissues of rice, Arabidopsis, and soybean implies that allergen homologs may function to loosen walls in growing vegetative tissues as well.
Gene	Cloning, expression and immunological characterization of Ory s 1, the major allergen of rice pollen.	1995	School of Botany, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.	We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, Ory s 1, encoding a group-1 allergen of rice pollen. The Ory s 1 protein shows significant sequence identity to the major allergen of rye-grass pollen, Lol p 1. RNA gel blot analysis shows that the Ory s 1 gene is expressed in mature anthers, but not in vegetative or other floral tissues tested. Southern blot analysis indicates that this clone represents a member of a small gene family in rice. Western blot analyses of total rice pollen proteins with the group-1 allergen-specific monoclonal 3A2 and IgE antibodies from grass pollen-allergic patients, revealed the presence of cross-reactive antigenic and allergenic epitopes in Ory s 1.
Plant J.	MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways.	2013	Institute of Biochemistry and Biology, University of Potsdam, Karl Liebknecht Strasse 24-25, Haus 20, 14476, Potsdam, Germany; Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology, Am Muhlenberg 1, 14476, Potsdam, Germany.	Growth regulation is an important aspect of plant adaptation during environmental perturbations. Here, the role of MULTIPASS (OsMPS), an R2R3-type MYB transcription factor of rice, was explored. OsMPS is induced by salt stress and expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues. Over-expression of OsMPS reduces growth under non-stress conditions, while knockdown plants display increased biomass. OsMPS expression is induced by abscisic acid and cytokinin, but is repressed by auxin, gibberellin and brassinolide. Growth retardation caused by OsMPS over-expression is partially restored by auxin application. Expression profiling revealed that OsMPS negatively regulates the expression of EXPANSIN (EXP) and cell-wall biosynthesis as well as phytohormone signaling genes. Furthermore, the expression of OsMPS-dependent genes is regulated by auxin, cytokinin and abscisic acid. Moreover, we show that OsMPS is a direct upstream regulator of OsEXPA4, OsEXPA8, OsEXPB2, OsEXPB3, OsEXPB6 and the endoglucanase genes OsGLU5 and OsGLU14. The multiple responses of OsMPS and its target genes to various hormones suggest an integrative function of OsMPS in the cross-talk between phytohormones and the environment to regulate adaptive growth.
