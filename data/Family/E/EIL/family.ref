Plant Mol. Biol.	OsEIL1, a rice homolog of the Arabidopsis EIN3 regulates the ethylene response as a positive component.	2006	Institute of Plant Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, PR China.	The plant gaseous hormone ethylene regulates many aspects of plant growth, development and responses to the environment. ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) is a transcription factor involved in the ethylene signal transduction pathway in Arabidopsis. To gain a better understanding of the ethylene signal transduction pathway in rice, six EIN3-like genes (designated OsEIL1-6) were identified. OsEIL1, which showed highest similarity with EIN3, was isolated and functionally characterized. Ectopic expression of OsEIL1 in Arabidopsis can partially complement the ein3-1 mutant. The transgenic rice plants with overexpression of OsEIL1 exhibit short root, coiled primary root and slightly short shoot phenotype and elevated response to exogenous ethylene. OsEBP89, an ethylene responsive element binding protein (EREBP) and OsACO1, an ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) oxidase gene were enhanced in the OsEIL1 overexpressing transgenic plants. These results indicate that OsEIL1 is involved in ethylene signal transduction pathway and acts as a positive regulator of ethylene response in rice.
Mol. Genet. Genomics	Involvement of two rice ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE genes in wound signaling.	2009	National Institute of Crop Science, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8518, Japan.	Ethylene and jasmonic acid (JA) have been proposed as key compounds for wound signaling in plants. In Arabidopsis, ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3), which is an essential transcription factor for ethylene signaling, is regulated at the post-transcriptional level, while transcriptional regulation of EIN3 or EIN3-LIKE (EIL) genes has not been well documented. The expression of 6 rice EIL genes (OsEIL1-6) was analyzed and only OsEIL1 and 2 were found to be wound-inducible EIL. OsEIL2 was also induced by JA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that recombinant OsEIL1 and 2 proteins bound to specific DNA sequences that are recognized by a wound-inducible tobacco EIL. Accumulation of OsEIL1 and 2 transcripts reached a maximum at 1 and 0.5 h after wounding, respectively, and the corresponding DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts of rice leaves was increased at 1 h after wounding. Candidates for OsEIL-target genes were selected by microarray analysis of wounded rice and by promoter sequence analyses of wound-inducible genes identified by microarray analysis. In OsEIL1- and/or 2-suppressed rice plants, the expression of at least four of 18 candidate genes analyzed was down-regulated. These results indicate the importance of inducible OsEILs in wound signaling in rice.
