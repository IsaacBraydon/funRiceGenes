BACKGROUND: Lectins, defined as &#39;Proteins that can recognize and bind specific carbohydrate structures&#39;, are widespread among all kingdoms of life and play an important role in various biological processes in the cell. Most plant lectins are involved in stress signaling and/or defense. The family of Euonymus-related lectins (EULs) represents a group of stress-related lectins composed of one or two EUL domains. The latter protein domain is unique in that it is ubiquitous in land plants, suggesting an important role for these proteins. RESULTS: Despite the availability of multiple completely sequenced rice genomes, little is known on the occurrence of lectins in rice. We identified 329 putative lectin genes in the genome of Oryza sativa subsp. japonica belonging to nine out of 12 plant lectin families. In this paper, an in-depth molecular characterization of the EUL family of rice was performed. In addition, analyses of the promoter sequences and investigation of the transcript levels for these EUL genes enabled retrieval of important information related to the function and stress responsiveness of these lectins. Finally, a comparative analysis between rice cultivars and several monocot and dicot species revealed a high degree of sequence conservation within the EUL domain as well as in the domain organization of these lectins. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of EULs throughout the plant kingdom and the high degree of sequence conservation in the EUL domain suggest that these proteins serve an important function in the plant cell. Analysis of the promoter region of the rice EUL genes revealed a diversity of stress responsive elements. Furthermore analysis of the expression profiles of the EUL genes confirmed that they are differentially regulated in response to several types of stress. These data suggest a potential role for the EULs in plant stress signaling and defense.
