PLoS ONE	The phytocyanin gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.): genome-wide identification, classification and transcriptional analysis.	2011	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.	BACKGROUND: Phytocyanins (PCs) are plant-specific blue copper proteins involved in electron transport, and a large number of known PCs are considered to be chimeric arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs). To date there has not been a genome-wide overview of the OsPC gene family. Therefore, as the first step and a useful strategy to elucidate the functions of OsPCs, there is an urgent need for a thorough genome-wide analysis of this gene family. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, a total of 62 OsPC genes were identified through a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome. Based on phylogeny and motif constitution, the family of OsPCs was classified into three subclasses: uclacyanin-like proteins (OsUCLs), stellacyanin-like proteins (OsSCLs) and early nodulin-like proteins (OsENODLs). Structure and glycosylation prediction indicated that 46 OsPCs were glycosylphosphatigylinositol-anchored proteins and 38 OsPCs were chimeric AGPs. Gene duplication analysis revealed that chromosomal segment and tandem duplications contributed almost equally to the expansion of this gene family, and duplication events were mostly happened in the OsUCL subfamily. The expression profiles of OsPC genes were analyzed at different stages of vegetative and reproductive development and under abiotic stresses. It revealed that a large number of OsPC genes were abundantly expressed in the various stages of development. Moreover, 17 genes were regulated under the treatments of abiotic stresses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The genome-wide identification and expression analysis of OsPC genes should facilitate research in this gene family and give new insights toward elucidating their functions in higher plants.
Plant Cell Physiol.	Isolation and identification of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored arabinogalactan proteins and novel beta-glucosyl Yariv-reactive proteins from seeds of rice (Oryza sativa)	2004	Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657 Japan.	Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are highly glycosylated extracellular glycoproteins playing important roles in plant growth and development. We have previously reported the possibility that AGPs are involved in the induction of alpha-amylase by gibberellin (GA) in barley aleurone layers by using the beta-glucosyl Yariv reagent (beta-GlcY), which has been presumed to specifically bind AGPs. In this present study, we isolated beta-GlcY-reactive proteins from rice bran rich in aleurone cells. The N-terminal sequences of classical AGP and AG peptides were determined from hydrophilic fractions obtained by reversed phase HPLC. Interestingly, a novel non-specific lipid transfer protein-like protein (OsLTPL1) and a novel early nodulin-like protein (OsENODL1) were also identified in the more hydrophobic fractions from HPLC as beta-GlcY-reactive proteins. Expression analysis of the genes coding for these proteins was performed. While classical AGP, AG peptides and OsLTPL1 were expressed in various parts of rice, OsENODL1 showed temporally and spatially specific expression in the aleurone layers. This new beta-GlcY-reactive protein is a promising candidate for the extracellular signaling factors of GA action in cereal seeds. Furthermore, the possibility that proteins with the AG glycomodule might react with beta-GlcY may broaden the definition of AGPs.
Mol. Biol. Rep.	Genome-wide identification, classification and expression analysis of genes encoding putative fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins in Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L.).	2012	Oil Crops Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Key Laboratory of Biology and Genetic Improvement of Oil Crops, Ministry of Agriculture, Wuhan, 430062, People's Republic of China.	Fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins (FLAs), a subclass of arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), have both predicted AGP-like glycosylated regions and putative fasciclin (FAS) domains, which may function in cell adhesion and communication. Previous studies have identified 21, 27, and 34 FLAs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), and wheat (Triticum aestivum), respectively. In this study, we identified 33 FLAs in the annotated genome of Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis line Chiifu-401-42). Sequence analysis indicated that FAS domains each contain two highly conserved regions, named H1 and H2, and that 17 FLAs from B. rapa (BrFLAs) possess both of these regions. Prediction of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) modification sites suggested that 15 BrFLAs were GPI-anchored to the plasma membrane. Additionally, 25 BrFLAs may have been duplicated during the processes that shaped the triplicated genome of the mesopolyploid B. rapa. Expression analyses indicated that BrFLA1, BrFLA11, BrFLA13, BrFLA28 and BrFLA32 were specifically expressed in inflorescence. Meanwhile, BrFLA9 (homologous to AtFLA12) is specifically expressed in stem, and BrFLA6/22 (homologous to AtFLA11) is also highly expressed in stem, suggesting BrFLA6/9/22 may have the same functions as AtFLA11/12 in A. thaliana. Taken together, the identification and bioinformatic analysis of FLAs in B. rapa will open the way for studying their biological functions in plant growth and development as well as evolutionary history of this gene family from A. thaliana to B. rapa.
Plant Physiol.	Posttranscriptional Control of Photosynthetic mRNA Decay under Stress Conditions Requires 3' and 5' Untranslated Regions and Correlates with Differential Polysome Association in Rice.	2012	School of Biotechnology and Environmental Engineering, Myongji University, Yongin 449-728, Korea.	Abiotic stress, including drought, salinity, and temperature extremes, regulates gene expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Expression profiling of total messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from rice (Oryza sativa) leaves grown under stress conditions revealed that the transcript levels of photosynthetic genes are reduced more rapidly than others, a phenomenon referred to as stress-induced mRNA decay (SMD). By comparing RNA polymerase II engagement with the steady-state mRNA level, we show here that SMD is a posttranscriptional event. The SMD of photosynthetic genes was further verified by measuring the half-lives of the small subunit of Rubisco (RbcS1) and Chlorophyll a/b-Binding Protein1 (Cab1) mRNAs during stress conditions in the presence of the transcription inhibitor cordycepin. To discern any correlation between SMD and the process of translation, changes in total and polysome-associated mRNA levels after stress were measured. Total and polysome-associated mRNA levels of two photosynthetic (RbcS1 and Cab1) and two stress-inducible (Dehydration Stress-Inducible Protein1 and Salt-Induced Protein) genes were found to be markedly similar. This demonstrated the importance of polysome association for transcript stability under stress conditions. Microarray experiments performed on total and polysomal mRNAs indicate that approximately half of all mRNAs that undergo SMD remain polysome associated during stress treatments. To delineate the functional determinant(s) of mRNAs responsible for SMD, the RbcS1 and Cab1 transcripts were dissected into several components. The expressions of different combinations of the mRNA components were analyzed under stress conditions, revealing that both 3' and 5' untranslated regions are necessary for SMD. Our results, therefore, suggest that the posttranscriptional control of photosynthetic mRNA decay under stress conditions requires both 3' and 5' untranslated regions and correlates with differential polysome association.
