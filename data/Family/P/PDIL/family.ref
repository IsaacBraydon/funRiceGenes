Plant Cell Physiol.	Overexpression of BiP has inhibitory effects on the accumulation of seed storage  proteins in endosperm cells of rice.	2009	Transgenic Crop Research and Development Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	Seed storage proteins are specifically and highly synthesized during seed maturation and are deposited into protein bodies (PBs) via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. The accumulation process is mediated by ER chaperones such as luminal binding protein (BiP) and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). To examine the role of ER chaperones and the relationship between ER chaperones and levels of accumulation of seed storage proteins, we generated transgenic rice plants in which the rice BiP and PDI genes were overexpressed in an endosperm-specific manner under the control of the rice seed storage protein glutelin promoter. The seed phenotype of the PDI-overexpressing transformant was almost identical to that of the wild type, whereas overexpression of BiP resulted in transgenic rice seed that displayed an opaque phenotype with floury and shrunken features. In the BiP-overexpressing line, the levels of accumulation of seed storage proteins and starch contents were significantly lower compared with the wild type. Interestingly, overproduction of BiP in the endosperm of the transformant not only altered the morphological structure of ER-derived PB-I, but also generated unusual new PB-like structures composed of a high electron density matrix containing glutelin and BiP and a low electron density matrix containing prolamins. Notably, polysomes were attached around the aberrant PB-like structures, indicating that this aberrant structure is an ER-derived PB-I derivative. These results suggested that the PB-like structure may be formed in the ER lumen, resulting in inhibition of translation, folding and transport of seed proteins.
Plant Biotechnol. J.	Analysis of ER stress in developing rice endosperm accumulating beta-amyloid peptide.	2010	Transgenic Crop Research and Development Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	The common neurodegenerative disorder known as Alzheimer's disease is characterized by cerebral neuritic plaques of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide. Plaque formation is related to the highly aggregative property of this peptide, because it polymerizes to form insoluble plaques or fibrils causing neurotoxicity. Here, we expressed Abeta peptide as a new causing agent to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to study ER stress occurred in plant. When the dimer of Abeta(1-42) peptide was expressed in maturing seed under the control of the 2.3-kb glutelin GluB-1 promoter containing its signal peptide, a maximum of about 8 mug peptide per grain accumulated and was deposited at the periphery of distorted ER-derived PB-I protein bodies. Synthesis of Abeta peptide in the ER lumen severely inhibited the synthesis and deposition of seed storage proteins, resulting in the generation of many small and abnormally appearing PB bodies. This ultrastructural change was accounted for by ER stress leading to the accumulation of aggregated Abeta peptide in the ER lumen and a coordinated increase in ER-resident molecular chaperones such as BiPs and PDIs in Abeta-expressing plants. Microarray analysis also confirmed that expression of several BiPs, PDIs and OsbZIP60 containing putative transmembrane domains was affected by the ER stress response. Abeta-expressing transgenic rice kernels exhibited an opaque and shrunken phenotype. When grain phenotype and expression levels were compared among transgenic rice grains expressing several different recombinant peptides, such detrimental effects on grain phenotype were correlated with the expressed peptide causing ER stress rather than expression levels.
Plant J.	Expression of ER quality control-related genes in response to changes in BiP1 levels in developing rice endosperm.	2010	Transgenic Crop Research and Development Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	Binding protein (BiP) is the key chaperone involved in folding of secretory proteins such as seed storage proteins in the ER lumen. To obtain functional information about BiP1, a gene that is predominantly expressed during rice seed maturation, we generated several transgenic rice plants in which various levels of BiP1 protein accumulated in an endosperm-specific manner. Severe suppression (BiP1 KD) or significant over-expression (BiP1 OEmax) of BiP1 not only altered seed phenotype and the intracellular structure of endosperm cells, but also reduced seed storage protein content, starch accumulation and grain weight. Microarray and RT-PCR analyses indicated that expression of many chaperone and co-chaperone genes was induced in transgenic plants, with more prominent expression in the BiP1 KD line than in the BiP1 OEmax line. Transcriptional induction of most chaperones was observed in calli treated with dithiothreitol or tunicamycin, treatments that trigger ER stress, indicating that induction of the chaperone genes in transgenic rice was caused by an ER stress response. In transient assays using rice protoplasts, the ortholog (Os06g0622700) of the AtbZIP60 transcription factor was shown to be involved in activation of some chaperone genes. Slight increases in the BiP1 level compared with wild-type, accompanied by increased levels of calnexin and protein disulfide isomerase-like proteins, resulted in significant enhancement of seed storage protein content, without any change in intracellular structure or seed phenotype. Judicious modification of BiP1 levels in transgenic rice can provide suitable conditions for the production of secretory proteins by alleviating ER stress.
Plant Physiol.	The rice mutant esp2 greatly accumulates the glutelin precursor and deletes the protein disulfide isomerase.	2002	Institute of Genetic Resources, Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Hakozaki, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan.	Rice (Oryza sativa) accumulates prolamins and glutelins as storage proteins. The latter storage protein is synthesized on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a 57-kD proglutelin precursor, which is then processed into acidic and basic subunits in the protein storage vacuole. Three esp2 mutants, CM1787, EM44, and EM747, contain larger amounts of the 57-kD polypeptide and corresponding lower levels of acidic and basic glutelin subunits than normal. Electron microscopic observation revealed that esp2 contained normal-appearing glutelin-containing protein bodies (PB-II), but lacked the normal prolamin-containing PB (PB-I). Instead, numerous small ER-derived PBs of uniform size (0.5 microm in diameter) and low electron density were readily observed. Immunoblot analysis of purified subcellular fractions and immunocytochemistry at the electron microscopy level showed that these new PBs contained the 57-kD proglutelin precursor and prolamin polypeptides. The 57-kD proglutelin was extracted with 1% (v/v) lactic acid solution only after removal of cysteine-rich prolamin polypeptides, suggesting that these proteins form glutelin-prolamin aggregates via interchain disulfide bonds within the ER lumen. The endosperm of esp2 mutants contains the lumenal chaperones, binding protein and calnexin, but lacks protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) at the protein and RNA levels. The transcript of PDI was expressed in the seed only during the early stage of seed development in the wild type. These results suggest that PDI plays an essential role in the segregation of proglutelin and prolamin polypeptides within the ER lumen.
Plant Cell Physiol.	Protein Disulfide Isomerase Like 1-1 Participates in the Maturation of Proglutelin Within the Endoplasmic Reticulum in Rice Endosperm.	2010	Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Hakozaki 6-10-1, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan.	The rice esp2 mutation was previously characterized by the abnormal accumulation of elevated levels of proglutelin and the absence of an endosperm-specific protein disulfide isomerase like (PDIL1-1). Here we show that Esp2 is the structural gene for PDIL1-1 and that this lumenal chaperone is asymmetrically distributed within the cortical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and largely restricted to the cisternal ER. Temporal studies indicate that PDIL1-1 is essential for the maturation of proglutelin only when its rate of synthesis significantly exceeds its export from the ER, a condition resulting in its build up in the ER lumen and the induction of ER quality control processes which lower glutelin levels as well as those of the other storage proteins. As proglutelin is initially synthesized on the cisternal ER, its deposition within prolamine protein bodies in esp2 suggests that PDIL1-1 helps retain proglutelin in the cisternal ER lumen until it attains competence for ER export and, thereby, indirectly preventing heterotypic interactions with prolamine polypeptides.
Plant Cell	Distinct Roles of Protein Disulfide Isomerase and P5 Sulfhydryl Oxidoreductases in Multiple Pathways for Oxidation of Structurally Diverse Storage Proteins in Rice.	2011	Division of Plant Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	In the rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm, storage proteins are synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in which prolamins are sorted to protein bodies (PBs) called type-I PB (PB-I). Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family oxidoreductase PDIL2;3, an ortholog of human P5, contains a conserved structural disulfide in the redox-inactive thioredoxin-like (TRX) domain and was efficiently targeted to the surface of PB-I in a redox active site-dependent manner, whereas PDIL1;1, an ortholog of human PDI, was localized in the ER lumen. Complementation analyses using PDIL1;1 knockout esp2 mutant indicated that the a and a' TRX domains of PDIL1;1 exhibited similar redox activities and that PDIL2;3 was unable to perform the PDIL1;1 functions. PDIL2;3 knockdown inhibited the accumulation of Cys-rich 10-kD prolamin (crP10) in the core of PB-I. Conversely, crP10 knockdown dispersed PDIL2;3 into the ER lumen. Glutathione S-transferase-PDIL2;3 formed a stable tetramer when it was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant PDIL2;3 tetramer facilitated alpha-globulin(C79F) mutant protein to form nonnative intermolecular disulfide bonds in vitro. These results indicate that PDIL2;3 and PDIL1;1 are not functionally redundant in sulfhydryl oxidations of structurally diverse storage proteins and play distinct roles in PB development. We discuss PDIL2;3-dependent and PDIL2;3-independent oxidation pathways that sustain disulfide bonds of crP10 in PB-I.
Plant Mol. Biol.	ER stress response induced by the production of human IL-7 in rice endosperm cells.	2013	Functional Transgenic Crops Research Unit, Genetically Modified Organism Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602, Japan.	Rice seed has been used as a production platform for high value recombinant proteins. When mature human interleukin 7 (hIL-7) was expressed as a secretory protein in rice endosperm by ligating the N terminal glutelin signal peptide and the C terminal KDEL endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal to the hIL-7 cytokine to improve production yield, this protein accumulated at levels visible by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. However, the production of this protein led not only to a severe reduction of endogenous seed storage proteins but also to a deterioration in grain quality. The appearance of aberrant grain phenotypes (such as floury and shrunken) was attributed to ER stress induced by the retention of highly aggregated unfolded hIL-7 in the ER lumen, and the expression levels of chaperones such as BiPs and PDIs were enhanced in parallel with the increase in hIL-7 levels. The activation of this ER stress response was shown to be mainly mediated by the OsIRE1-OsbZIP50 signal cascade, based on the appearance of unconventional splicing of OsbZIP50 mRNA and the induction of OsBiP4&amp;5. Interestingly, the ER stress response could be induced by lower concentrations of hIL-7 versus other types of cytokines such as IL-1b, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-18. Furthermore, several ubiquitin 26S proteasome-related genes implicated in ER-associated degradation were upregulated by hIL-7 production. These results suggest that severe detrimental effects on grain properties were caused by proteo-toxicity induced by unfolded hIL-7 aggregates in the ER, resulting in the triggering of ER stress.
Plant Physiol.	Phylogenetic analyses identify 10 classes of the protein disulfide isomerase family in plants, including single-domain protein disulfide isomerase-related proteins.	2005	Department of Botany, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695-7612, USA.	Protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) are molecular chaperones that contain thioredoxin (TRX) domains and aid in the formation of proper disulfide bonds during protein folding. To identify plant PDI-like (PDIL) proteins, a genome-wide search of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) was carried out to produce a comprehensive list of 104 genes encoding proteins with TRX domains. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted for these sequences using Bayesian and maximum-likelihood methods. The resulting phylogenetic tree showed that evolutionary relationships of TRX domains alone were correlated with conserved enzymatic activities. From this tree, we identified a set of 22 PDIL proteins that constitute a well-supported clade containing orthologs of known PDIs. Using the Arabidopsis PDIL sequences in iterative BLAST searches of public and proprietary sequence databases, we further identified orthologous sets of 19 PDIL sequences in rice (Oryza sativa) and 22 PDIL sequences in maize (Zea mays), and resolved the PDIL phylogeny into 10 groups. Five groups (I-V) had two TRX domains and showed structural similarities to the PDIL proteins in other higher eukaryotes. The remaining five groups had a single TRX domain. Two of these (quiescin-sulfhydryl oxidase-like and adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase-like) had putative nonisomerase enzymatic activities encoded by an additional domain. Two others (VI and VIII) resembled small single-domain PDIs from Giardia lamblia, a basal eukaryote, and from yeast. Mining of maize expressed sequence tag and RNA-profiling databases indicated that members of all of the single-domain PDIL groups were expressed throughout the plant. The group VI maize PDIL ZmPDIL5-1 accumulated during endoplasmic reticulum stress but was not found within the intracellular membrane fractions and may represent a new member of the molecular chaperone complement in the cell.
Plant J.	Signal transduction by IRE1-mediated splicing of bZIP50 and other stress sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response of rice.	2012	Genetically Modified Organism Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor IRE1 transduces signals by inducing the unconventional splicing of mRNAs encoding key transcription factors: HAC1 in yeast and XBP1 in animals. However, no HAC1 or XBP1 homologues have been found in plants, and until recently the substrate for plant IRE1 has remained unknown. This study demonstrates that the Oryza sativa (rice) OsbZIP50 transcription factor, an orthologue of Arabidopsis AtbZIP60, is regulated by IRE1-mediated splicing of its RNA. Despite the presence of a transcriptional activation domain, OsbZIP50 protein is not translocated into the nucleus efficiently in the absence of OsbZIP50 mRNA splicing. Unconventional splicing of OsbZIP50 mRNA causes a frame shift, which results in the appearance of a nuclear localization signal in the newly translated OsbZIP50. OsbZIP50 mRNA is spliced in a similar manner to HAC1 and XBP1 mRNAs; however, this splicing has very different effects on the translation products, a finding that shows the diversity of IRE1-related transcription factors in eukaryotes. In addition, the expression of OsbZIP50 is affected by ER stress sensor proteins OsIRE1, OsbZIP39 and OsbZIP60. ER stress-related genes differ with respect to their dependency on OsbZIP50 for their expression. The findings of this study improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the plant ER stress response.
