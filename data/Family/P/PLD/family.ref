The Chloroplast-Localized Phospholipases D alpha4 and alpha5 Regulate Herbivore-Induced Direct and Indirect Defenses in Rice.	2011	National Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Institute of Insect Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310029, China.	The oxylipin pathway is of central importance for plant defensive responses. Yet, the first step of the pathway, the liberation of linolenic acid following induction, is poorly understood. Phospholipases D (PLDs) have been hypothesized to mediate this process, but data from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) regarding the role of PLDs in plant resistance have remained controversial. Here, we cloned two chloroplast-localized PLD genes from rice (Oryza sativa), OsPLDalpha4 and OsPLDalpha5, both of which were up-regulated in response to feeding by the rice striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis, mechanical wounding, and treatment with jasmonic acid (JA). Antisense expression of OsPLDalpha4 and -alpha5 (as-pld), which resulted in a 50% reduction of the expression of the two genes, reduced elicited levels of linolenic acid, JA, green leaf volatiles, and ethylene and attenuated the SSB-induced expression of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (OsMPK3), a lipoxygenase (OsHI-LOX), a hydroperoxide lyase (OsHPL3), as well as a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (OsACS2). The impaired oxylipin and ethylene signaling in as-pld plants decreased the levels of herbivore-induced trypsin protease inhibitors and volatiles, improved the performance of SSB and the rice brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, and reduced the attractiveness of plants to a larval parasitoid of SSB, Apanteles chilonis. The production of trypsin protease inhibitors in as-pld plants could be partially restored by JA, while the resistance to rice brown planthopper and SSB was restored by green leaf volatile application. Our results show that phospholipases function as important components of herbivore-induced direct and indirect defenses in rice.

Phospholipase D (PLD) has emerged as an important enzyme involved in signal transduction, stress responses, protein trafficking, and membrane metabolism. This report describes the cloning and characterization of three novel PLD genes from rice, designated RPLD3, RPLD4 and RPLD5. The rice PLDs, including the previously isolated RPLD1 and RPLD2, are similar to PLD subfamilies of Arabidopsis: Based on sequence homology and domain conservation, RPLD1 is most similar to the PLDalpha subfamily of PLDs while RPLD5 most closely resembles the PLDdelta type. RPLD2, 3 and 4 represent a unique subfamily, although they are most similar to PLDalpha. RPLD1 is located on chromosome 1, RPLD5 on chromosome 3, and RPLD2, RPLD3, and RPLD4 are tandemly arrayed on chromosome 5. Transcriptional analysis reveals that RPLD1, present in healthy rice vegetative tissues, is induced rapidly but transiently in wounded leaf tissues. RPLD2, also induced by wounding, is present at lower levels but for a more prolonged duration than RPLD1. Immunolocalization with peptide specific antibodies to each of the five PLDs was used to demonstrate that the isoforms have overlapping but distinct patterns of distribution in healthy rice cells. RPLD1 was detected in mesophyll cell wall, membranes, and chloroplasts, whereas RPLD3 and RPLD4 were located predominantly in the chloroplasts. Labeling of RPLD2 and RPLD5 was sparse, and was most concentrated in the secondary walls of xylem (RPLD2) and guard cells (RPLD2 and RPLD5). This combined information on structural features, expression profiles, and cellular localization will assist the basis for dissection of PLD isoform function in rice.
Cell Res	Genome-wide analysis of the phospholipase D family in Oryza sativa and functional characterization of PLD beta 1 in seed germination.	2007	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 300 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, China.	Phospholipase D (PLD) plays a critical role in plant growth and development, as well as in hormone and stress responses. PLD encoding genes constitute a large gene family that are present in higher plants. There are 12 members of the PLD family in Arabidopsis thaliana and several of them have been functionally characterized; however, the members of the PLD family in Oryza sativa remain to be fully described. Through genome-wide analysis, 17 PLD members found in different chromosomes have been identified in rice. Protein domain structural analysis reveals a novel subfamily, besides the C2-PLDs and PXPH-PLDs, that is present in rice - the SP-PLD. SP-PLD harbors a signal peptide instead of the C2 or PXPH domains at the N-terminus. Expression pattern analysis indicates that most PLD-encoding genes are differentially expressed in various tissues, or are induced by hormones or stress conditions, suggesting the involvement of PLD in multiple developmental processes. Transgenic studies have shown that the suppressed expression of rice PLD beta 1 results in reduced sensitivity to exogenous ABA during seed germination. Further analysis of the expression of ABA signaling-related genes has revealed that PLD beta 1 stimulates ABA signaling by activating SAPK, thus repressing GAmyb expression and inhibiting seed germination.
