In model plants like Arabidopsis, the PERK gene family has been well investigated. Conversely, no information available on the PERK gene family and their biological functions largely remained unknown in rice. This study analyzed the basic physicochemical properties, phylogeny, gene structure, cis-acting elements, Gene ontology (GO) annotation and protein-protein interaction of OsPERK gene family members using various bioinformatics tools based on the whole-genome data of O. sativa. Thus, in this work, 8 PERK genes in rice were identified, and their roles in plant development, growth, and response to various stresses were studied. A phylogenetic study revealed that OsPERKs are grouped into seven classes. Chromosomal mapping also displayed that 8 PERK genes were unevenly distributed on 12 chromosomes. Further, the prediction of subcellular localization indicated that OsPERKs were mainly located at the endomembrane system. Gene structure analysis of OsPERKs has shown a distinctive evolutionary path. In addition, synteny analysis exhibited the 40 orthologous gene pairs in Arabidopsis thaliana, Triticum aestivum, Hordeum vulgare and Medicago truncatula. Furthermore, Ka to Ks proportion shows that most OsPERK genes experienced resilient purifying selection during evolutionary processes. The OsPERK promoters contained several cis-acting regulatory, which are crucial for plant development processes, phytohormone signaling, stress, and defense response. Moreover, the expression pattern of OsPERK family members showed differential expression patterns in different tissues and various stress conditions. Taken together, these results provide clear messages for a better understanding the roles of OsPERK genes in various development stages, tissues, and multifactorial stress as well as enriched the related research of OsPERK family members in rice.
