Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem.	Circadian-Associated Rice Pseudo Response Regulators (OsPRRs): Insight into the Control of Flowering Time.	2005	Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, School of Agriculture, Nagoya University, Japan.	A small family of plant proteins, designated PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATORS (PRRs), is crucial for a better understanding of the molecular link between circadian rhythm and photoperiodic control of flowering time in the dicotyledonous model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Recently, we showed that the monocotyledonous model plant Oryza sativa also has homologous members of the OsPRR family (Oryza sativa PRR). In the previous experiments with rice, we mainly characterized a japonica variety (Nipponbare). By employing an indica variety (Kasalath), in this study we further characterized OsPRRs with reference to the photoperiod sensitivity Hd (Heading date) QTL (quantitative trait loci) implicated in the control of flowering time in rice. The circadian-controlled and sequential expression profiles of the five OsPRR genes were observed not only for Nipponbare but also for Kasalath. Then each of these OsPRR genes was mapped on the rice chromosomes. Among these OsPRR genes, OsPRR37 was mapped very closely to Hd2-QTL, which was identified as the major locus that enhances the photoperiod sensitivity of flowering in Nipponbare. Furthermore, we found that Kasalath has a severe mutational lesion in the OsPRR37 coding sequence.
Plant Physiol.	Whole-genome analysis of Oryza sativa reveals similar architecture of two-component signaling machinery with Arabidopsis.	2006	Stress Physiology and Molecular Biology Laboratory, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110067, India. ashwanip@mail.jnu.ac.in	The two-component system (TCS), which works on the principle of histidine-aspartate phosphorelay signaling, is known to play an important role in diverse physiological processes in lower organisms and has recently emerged as an important signaling system in plants. Employing the tools of bioinformatics, we have characterized TCS signaling candidate genes in the genome of Oryza sativa L. subsp. japonica. We present a complete overview of TCS gene families in O. sativa, including gene structures, conserved motifs, chromosome locations, and phylogeny. Our analysis indicates a total of 51 genes encoding 73 putative TCS proteins. Fourteen genes encode 22 putative histidine kinases with a conserved histidine and other typical histidine kinase signature sequences, five phosphotransfer genes encoding seven phosphotransfer proteins, and 32 response regulator genes encoding 44 proteins. The variations seen between gene and protein numbers are assumed to result from alternative splicing. These putative proteins have high homology with TCS members that have been shown experimentally to participate in several important physiological phenomena in plants, such as ethylene and cytokinin signaling and phytochrome-mediated responses to light. We conclude that the overall architecture of the TCS machinery in O. sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana is similar, and our analysis provides insights into the conservation and divergence of this important signaling machinery in higher plants.
Plant Cell	Os-GIGANTEA Confers Robust Diurnal Rhythms on the Global Transcriptome of Rice in the Field.	2011	Photosynthesis and Photobiology Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Japan. tizawa@nias.affrc.go.jp	The circadian clock controls physiological traits such as flowering time, photosynthesis, and growth in plants under laboratory conditions. Under natural field conditions, however, little is known about the significance of the circadian clock in plants. By time-course transcriptome analyses of rice (Oryza sativa) leaves, using a newly isolated rice circadian clock-related mutant carrying a null mutation in Os-GIGANTEA (Os-GI), we show here that Os-GI controlled 75% (false discovery rate = 0.05) of genes among 27,201 genes tested and was required for strong amplitudes and fine-tuning of the diurnal rhythm phases of global gene expression in the field. However, transcripts involved in primary metabolism were not greatly affected by osgi. Time-course metabolome analyses of leaves revealed no trends of change in primary metabolites in osgi plants, and net photosynthetic rates and grain yields were not affected. By contrast, some transcripts and metabolites in the phenylpropanoid metabolite pathway were consistently affected. Thus, net primary assimilation of rice was still robust in the face of such osgi mutation-related circadian clock defects in the field, unlike the case with defects caused by Arabidopsis thaliana toc1 and ztl mutations in the laboratory.

Plant Physiol.	Characterization of genes involved in cytokinin signaling and metabolism from rice.	2012	Department of Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA.	Two-component signaling elements play important roles in plants, including a central role in cytokinin signaling. We characterized two-component elements from the monocot rice (Oryza sativa) using several complementary approaches. Phylogenetic analysis reveals relatively simple orthologous relationships among the histidine kinases in rice and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In contrast, the histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins (OsHPs) and response regulators (OsRRs) display a higher degree of lineage-specific expansion. The intracellular localizations of several OsHPs and OsRRs were examined in rice and generally found to correspond to the localizations of their dicot counterparts. The functionality of rice type-B OsRRs was tested in Arabidopsis; one from a clade composed of both monocot and dicot type-B OsRRs complemented an Arabidopsis type-B response regulator mutant, but a type-B OsRR from a monocot-specific subfamily generally did not. The expression of genes encoding two-component elements and proteins involved in cytokinin biosynthesis and degradation was analyzed in rice roots and shoots and in response to phytohormones. Nearly all type-A OsRRs and OsHK4 were up-regulated in response to cytokinin, but other cytokinin signaling elements were not appreciably affected. Furthermore, multiple cytokinin oxidase (OsCKX) genes were up-regulated by cytokinin. Abscisic acid treatment decreased the expression of several genes involved in cytokinin biosynthesis and degradation. Auxin affected the expression of a few genes; brassinosteroid and gibberellin had only modest effects. Our results support a shared role for two-component elements in mediating cytokinin signaling in monocots and dicots and reveal how phytohormones can impact cytokinin function through modulating gene expression.
Plant Cell Physiol.	Comparative Overviews of Clock-Associated Genes of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.	2007	Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, School of Agriculture, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan. t2706775@mbox.nagoya-u.ac.jp	In higher plants, circadian rhythms are highly relevant to a wide range of biological processes. To such circadian rhythms, the clock (oscillator) is central, and recent intensive studies on the model higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana have begun to shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of the central clock. Such representative clock-associated genes of A. thaliana are the homologous CCA1 and LHY genes, and five PRR genes that belong to a small family of pseudo-response regulators including TOC1. Others are GI, ZTL, ELF3, ELF4, LUX/PCL1, etc. In this context, a simple question arose as to whether or not the molecular picture of the model Arabidopsis clock is conserved in other higher plants. Here we made an effort to answer the question with special reference to Oryza sativa, providing experimental evidence that this model monocot also has a set of highly conserved clock-associated genes, such as those designated as OsCCA1, OsPRR-series including OsTOC1/OsPRR1, OsZTLs, OsPCL1 as well as OsGI. These results will provide us with insight into the general roles of plant circadian clocks, such as those for the photoperiodic control of flowering time that has a strong impact on the reproduction and yield in many higher plants.
Plant Cell Physiol.	The evolutionarily conserved OsPRR quintet: rice pseudo-response regulators implicated in circadian rhythm.	2003	Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, School of Agriculture, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, 464-8601 Japan.	In Arabidopsis thaliana, a number of circadian-associated factors have been identified, including TOC1 (TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1) that is believed to be a component of the central oscillator. TOC1 is a member of a small family of proteins, designated as ARABIDOPSIS PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATORS (APRR1/TOC1, APRR3, APRR5, APRR7, and APRR9). As demonstrated previously, these APRR1/TOC1 quintet members are crucial for a better understanding of the molecular links between circadian rhythms, control of flowering time through photoperiodic pathways, and also photosensory signal transduction in this dicotyledonous plant. In this respect, both the dicotyledonous (e.g. A. thaliana) and monocotyledonous (e.g. Oryza sativa) plants might share the evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanism underlying the circadian rhythm. Based on such an assumption, and as the main objective of this study, we asked the question of whether rice also has a set of pseudo-response regulators, and if so, whether or not they are associated with the circadian rhythm. Here we showed that rice has five members of the OsPRR family (Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator), and also that the expressions of these OsPRR genes are under the control of circadian rhythm. They are expressed in a diurnal and sequential manner in the order of OsPRR73 (OsPRR37)--&gt;OsPRR95 (OsPRR59)--&gt;OsPRR1, which is reminiscent of the circadian waves of the APRR1/TOC1 quintet in A. thaliana. These and other results of this study suggested that the OsPRR quintet, including the ortholog of APRR1/TOC1, might play important roles within, or close to, the circadian clock of rice.

BMC Genomics	Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice.	2011	Universite Montpellier 2, UMR DAP, Place Eugene Bataillon, 34095 Montpellier Cedex 5, France.	BACKGROUND: In rice, the major part of the post-embryonic root system is made of stem-derived roots named crown roots (CR). Among the few characterized rice mutants affected in root development, crown rootless1 mutant is unable to initiate crown root primordia. CROWN ROOTLESS1 (CRL1) is induced by auxin and encodes an AS2/LOB-domain transcription factor that acts upstream of the gene regulatory network controlling CR development. RESULTS: To identify genes involved in CR development, we compared global gene expression profile in stem bases of crl1 mutant and wild-type (WT) plants. Our analysis revealed that 250 and 236 genes are down- and up-regulated respectively in the crl1 mutant. Auxin induces CRL1 expression and consequently it is expected that auxin also alters the expression of genes that are early regulated by CRL1. To identify genes under the early control of CRL1, we monitored the expression kinetics of a selected subset of genes, mainly chosen among those exhibiting differential expression, in crl1 and WT following exogenous auxin treatment. This analysis revealed that most of these genes, mainly related to hormone, water and nutrient, development and homeostasis, were likely not regulated directly by CRL1. We hypothesized that the differential expression for these genes observed in the crl1 mutant is likely a consequence of the absence of CR formation. Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM (FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM)/FAS1 (FASCIATA1), GTE4 (GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4) and MAP (MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN) were identified. FSM/FAS1 and GTE4 are known in rice and Arabidopsis to be involved in the maintenance of root meristem through chromatin remodelling and cell cycle regulation respectively. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that the differential regulation of most genes in crl1 versus WT may be an indirect consequence of CRL1 inactivation resulting from the absence of CR in the crl1 mutant. Nevertheless some genes, FAS1/FSM, GTE4 and MAP, require CRL1 to be induced by auxin suggesting that they are likely directly regulated by CRL1. These genes have a function related to polarized cell growth, cell cycle regulation or chromatin remodelling. This suggests that these genes are controlled by CRL1 and involved in CR initiation in rice.
