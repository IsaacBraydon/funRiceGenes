The elite rice cultivar Yuejingsimiao 2 (YJ2) is characterized by a high level of grain quality and yield, and resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae. YJ2 showed 100% resistance to four fungal populations collected from Guangdong, Sichuan, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang Provinces, which is a higher frequency than that shown by the well-known resistance (R) gene donor cultivars such as Sanhuangzhan 2 and 28zhan. Segregation analysis for resistance with F(2) and F(4) populations indicated the resistance of YJ2 was controlled by multiple genes that are dominant or recessive. The putative R genes of YJ2 were roughly tagged by SSR markers, located on chromosomes 2, 6, 8, and 12, in a bulked-segregant analysis using genome-wide selected SSR markers with F(4) lines that segregated into 3 resistant (R):1 susceptible (S) or 1R:3S. The recessive R gene on chromosome 8 was further mapped to an interval approximately 1.9 cM/152 kb in length by linkage analysis with genomic position-ready markers in the mapping population derived from an F(4) line that segregated into 1R:3S. Given that no major R gene was mapped to this interval, the novel R gene was designated as pi55(t). Out of 26 candidate genes predicted in the region based on the reference genomic sequence of the cultivar Nipponbare, two genes that encode a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein and heavy-metal-associated domain-containing protein, respectively, were suggested as the most likely candidates for pi55(t).
Plant Mol. Biol.	Molecular characterization, expression pattern, and functional analysis of the OsIRL gene family encoding intracellular Ras-group-related LRR proteins in rice.	2010	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Leucine-rich repeat proteins constitute a large gene family and play important roles in plant growth and development. Among them, Arabidopsis PIRL is a plant-specific class of intracellular Ras-group-related leucine-rich repeat proteins. In this study, we identified eight homologues of PIRLs in rice and designated them as OsIRL proteins. We described the gene structures, chromosome localizations, protein motifs, and phylogenetic relationships of the OsIRL gene family. The expression profiles of OsIRL genes were analyzed throughout the entire rice life cycle, along with light and three hormone stress conditions, using quantitative RT-PCR and microarray data. All OsIRL genes were expressed in at least one experimental stage and exhibited divergent expression patterns, with several genes showing preferential expression at specific stages. OsIRL4 and OsIRL5 showed higher expression levels under light compared to dark. OsIRL4 and OsIRL7 exhibited significant differential expression in response to hormone treatments. Six T-DNA or Tos17 insertion lines for five individual OsIRL genes were identified and examined morphologically. The comprehensive expression profile elucidated in this investigation together with the characterized insertion lines will provide a solid foundation for in-depth dissection of OsIRL functions.
6th International Rice Genetics Symposium	NBS-LRR gene clusters contributing to durable resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice variety SHZ-2	2009		
Theor. Appl. Genet.	Fine-mapping and molecular marker development for Pi56(t), a NBS-LRR gene conferring broad-spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.	2013	International Rice Research Institute, Plant Breeding, Genetics and Biotechnology Division, DAPO Box 7777, Metro Manila, Philippines.	The major quantitative trait locus qBR9.1 confers broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast, and was mapped to a ~69.1 kb region on chromosome 9 that was inherited from resistant variety Sanhuangzhan No 2 (SHZ-2). Within this region, only one predicted disease resistance gene with nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) domains was found. Specific markers corresponding to this gene cosegregated with blast resistance in F2 and F3 populations derived from crosses of susceptible variety Texianzhan 13 (TXZ-13) to SHZ-2 and the resistant backcross line BC-10. We tentatively designate the gene as Pi56(t). Sequence analysis revealed that Pi56(t) encodes an NBS-LRR protein composed of 743 amino acids. Pi56(t) was highly induced by blast infection in resistant lines SHZ-2 and BC-10. The corresponding allele of Pi56(t) in the susceptible line TXZ-13 encodes a protein with an NBS domain but without LRR domain, and it was not induced by Magnaporthe oryzae infection. Three new cosegregating gene-specific markers, CRG4-1, CRG4-2 and CRG4-3, were developed. In addition, we evaluated polymorphism of the gene-based markers among popular varieties from national breeding programs in Asia and Africa. The presence of the CRG4-2 SHZ-2 allele cosegregated with a blast-resistant phenotype in two BC2F1 families of SHZ-2 crossed to recurrent parents IR64-Sub1 and Swarna-Sub1. CRG4-1 and CRG4-3 showed clear polymorphism among 19 varieties, suggesting that they can be used in marker-assisted breeding to combine Pi56(t) with other target genes in breeding lines.
