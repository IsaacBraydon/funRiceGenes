Gene	Comprehensive sequence and expression profile analysis of PEX11 gene family in rice.	2008	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research Wuhan, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	PEX11 gene family has been shown to be involved in peroxisome biogenesis but very little is known about this gene family in rice. Here we show that five putative PEX11 genes (OsPEX11-1-5) present in rice genome and each contain three conserved motifs. The PEX11 sequences from rice and other species can be classified into three major groups. Among the five rice PEX11 genes, OsPEX11-2 and -3 are most likely duplicated. Expression profile and RT-PCR analysis suggested that the members of PEX11 family in rice had differential expression patterns: OsPEX11-1 and OsPEX11-4 had higher expression levels in leaf tissues than in the other tissues, OsPEX11-2 was detected only in germinated seeds, OsPEX11-3 was expressed predominantly in endosperm and germinated seeds, and OsPEX11-5 was expressed in all the tissues investigated. We also observed that the rice PEX11 genes had differential expression patterns under different abiotic stresses. OsPEX11-1 and OsPEX11-4 were induced by abscisic acid (ABA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), salt and low nitrogen stress conditions. OsPEX11-3 was responsive to ABA and H2O2 treatments, and OsPEX11-5 was responsive to ABA, H2O2, and salt treatments. However, OsPEX11-2 had no response to any of the stresses. Our results suggest that the rice PEX11 genes have diversification not only in sequences but also in expression patterns under normal and various stress conditions.
