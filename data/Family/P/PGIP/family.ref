Plant Cell Rep.	Expression profile analysis of the polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein genes in rice and their responses to phytohormones and fungal infection.	2012	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Centre of Plant Gene Research, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, People's Republic of China. luliaoxun@hotmail.com	Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are typically leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins that can inhibit the activity of fungal polygalacturonases (PGs). In this study, two new Ospgip genes, named Ospgip6 and Ospgip7 with consensus sequence of ten imperfect LRR motif located on rice chromosomes 8 and 9, were identified using BLAST analysis. Both of them appear to be extracellular glycoproteins. To have a global view of the dynamic gene expression pattern, seven Ospgip genes were first analyzed using the Affymetrix rice genome array data from online resource. All of these seven Ospgip genes showed variable expression patterns among tissues/organs. In order to further investigate the potential function of these Ospgip genes, the responses of Ospgip genes to the treatment of various phytohormones (abscisic acid, brassinosteroid, gibberellic acid, 3-indole acetic acid, jasmonic acid, kinetin, naphthalene acetic acid and salicylic acid) as well as fungal infection were analyzed by real-time PCR using time course array. Generally, all the Ospgip genes were slightly up-regulated in the indica rice cultivar Minghui 63 under GA(3), KT and NAA treatments (except Ospgip2, which was down-regulated under KT treatment). In the japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua 11, Ospgip genes were regulated by most treatments with the response time variability. We also analyzed putative cis-elements in the promoter regions of Ospgip genes. This dataset provided a versatile resource to understand the regulatory network of Ospgip genes during the process of phytohormones treatment and fungal infection in the model monocotyledonous plant, rice, and could aid in the transgenic breeding against rice fungal diseases. KEY MESSAGE: All the seven Ospgip genes showed variable expression patterns in Minghui 63 and their expressions were regulated by different phytohormone treatments or fungal infection in Minghui 63 and Zhonghua 11.
Theor. Appl. Genet.	Characterization of expressed Pgip genes in rice and wheat reveals similar extent of sequence variation to dicot PGIPs and identifies an active PGIP lacking an entire LRR repeat.	2006	Dipartimento di Agrobiologia e Agrochimica, Universita della Tuscia, Via San Camillo de Lellis, s.n.c., 01100 Viterbo, Italy.	Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins involved in plant defence. A number of PGIPs have been characterized from dicot species, whereas only a few data are available from monocots. Database searches and genome-specific cloning strategies allowed the identification of four rice (Oryza sativa L.) and two wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Pgip genes. The rice Pgip genes (Ospgip1, Ospgip2, Ospgip3 and Ospgip4) are distributed over a 30 kbp region of the short arm of chromosome 5, whereas the wheat Pgip genes, Tapgip1 and Tapgip2, are localized on the short arm of chromosome 7B and 7D, respectively. Deduced amino acid sequences show the typical LRR modular organization and a conserved distribution of the eight cysteines at the N- and C-terminal regions. Sequence comparison suggests that monocot and dicot PGIPs form two separate clusters sharing about 40% identity and shows that this value is close to the extent of variability observed within each cluster. Gene-specific RT-PCR and biochemical analyses demonstrate that both Ospgips and Tapgips are expressed in the whole plant or in a tissue-specific manner, and that OsPGIP1, lacking an entire LRR repeat, is an active inhibitor of fungal polygalacturonases. This last finding can contribute to define the molecular features of PG-PGIP interactions and highlights that the genetic events that can generate variability at the Pgip locus are not only limited to substitutions or small insertions/deletions, as so far reported, but can also involve variation in the number of LRRs.
