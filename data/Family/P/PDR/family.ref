Trends Plant Sci.	Plant ABC proteins--a unified nomenclature and updated inventory.	2008	Biomathematics and Bioinformatics Department, Rothamsted Research, Harpenden, AL5 2JQ, UK.	The ABC superfamily comprises both membrane-bound transporters and soluble proteins involved in a broad range of processes, many of which are of considerable agricultural, biotechnological and medical potential. Completion of the Arabidopsis and rice genome sequences has revealed a particularly large and diverse complement of plant ABC proteins in comparison with other organisms. Forward and reverse genetics, together with heterologous expression, have uncovered many novel roles for plant ABC proteins, but this progress has been accompanied by a confusing proliferation of names for plant ABC genes and their products. A consolidated nomenclature will provide much-needed clarity and a framework for future research.

Organization and function of the plant pleiotropic drug resistance ABC transporter family.	2006	Unite de Biochimie Physiologique, Institut des Sciences de la Vie, Univerisity of Louvain, Croix du Sud 5-15, 1348 Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.	Among the ABC transporters, the pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) family is particular in that its members are found only in fungi and plants and have a reverse domain organization, i.e., the nucleotide binding domain precedes the transmembrane domain. In Arabidopsis and rice, for which the full genome has been sequenced, the family of plant ABC transporters contains 15 and 23 PDR genes, respectively, which can be tentatively organized using the sequence data into five subfamilies. Most of the plant PDR genes so far characterized belong to subfamily I and have been shown to be involved in responses to abiotic and biotic stress, in the latter case, probably by transporting antimicrobial secondary metabolites to the cell surface. Only a single subfamily II member has been characterized. Induction of its expression by iron deficiency suggests its involvement in iron deficiency stress, thus, enlightening a new physiological role for a PDR gene.
Planta.	The plant PDR family of ABC transporters 	2002	Department of Plant Biochemistry and Physiology, Institute of Plant Sciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich, Universitatsstrasse 2, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.	The plant pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters has been implicated in the transport of antifungal agents. In this paper, we provide an analysis of the entire family of PDR genes present in the Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. genome. This analysis both resolves discrepancies in published inventories of plant ABC proteins and provides an expression analysis of all the annotated Arabidopsis PDR genes. The results indicate that the Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding PDR proteins and that these genes show a spectrum of specific expression patterns, both at the organ level and in response to various hormonal, environmental and chemical factors. These data provide a scaffold for the future molecular genetic analysis of this important family of ABC transporters. In addition, we demonstrate the usefulness of such data by using them to identify an Arabidopsis PDR protein that may play a role in the extrusion of the antifungal diterpene sclareol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.	An ATP-binding cassette subfamily G full transporter is essential for the retention of leaf water in both wild barley and rice.	2011	Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou 730000, China. guoxiong@lzb.ac.cn	Land plants have developed a cuticle preventing uncontrolled water loss. Here we report that an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily G (ABCG) full transporter is required for leaf water conservation in both wild barley and rice. A spontaneous mutation, eibi1.b, in wild barley has a low capacity to retain leaf water, a phenotype associated with reduced cutin deposition and a thin cuticle. Map-based cloning revealed that Eibi1 encodes an HvABCG31 full transporter. The gene was highly expressed in the elongation zone of a growing leaf (the site of cutin synthesis), and its gene product also was localized in developing, but not in mature tissue. A de novo wild barley mutant named "eibi1.c," along with two transposon insertion lines of rice mutated in the ortholog of HvABCG31 also were unable to restrict water loss from detached leaves. HvABCG31 is hypothesized to function as a transporter involved in cutin formation. Homologs of HvABCG31 were found in green algae, moss, and lycopods, indicating that this full transporter is highly conserved in the evolution of land plants.
Planta.	Transcriptional profiling of the PDR gene family in rice roots in response to plant growth regulators, redox perturbations and weak organic acid stresses.	2008	Montreal General Hospital, 1650 Cedar Ave, L5-312, Montreal, QC H3G 1A4, Canada. ann.moons@mail.mcgill.ca	The role of plant pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) type ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters remains poorly understood. We characterized the expression of the rice pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) gene family in roots, where PDR transporters are believed to have major functions. A prototypical oligonucleotide array was developed containing 70-mers chosen in the gene-specific 3' untranslated regions of the rice PDR genes, other full-molecule rice ABC transporter genes and relevant marker genes. Jasmonates, which are involved in plant defense and secondary metabolism, proved major inducers of PDR gene expression. Over half of the PDR genes were JA-induced in roots of rice; OsPDR9 to the highest level. Salicylic acid, involved in plant pathogen defense, markedly induced the expression of OsPDR20. OsPDR20 was cDNA cloned and characterized. Abscisic acid, typically involved in water deficit responses, particularly induced OsPDR3 in roots and shoot and OsPDR6 in rice leaves. OsPDR9 and OsPDR20 were furthermore up-regulated in response to dithiothreitol- or glutathione-induced redox perturbations. Exogenous application of the weak organic acids lactic acid, malic acid, and citric acid differentially induced the expression of OsPDR3, OsPDR8, OsPDR9 and OsPDR20 in rice seedling roots. This transcriptional survey represents a guide for the further functional analysis of individual PDR transporters in roots of rice.
