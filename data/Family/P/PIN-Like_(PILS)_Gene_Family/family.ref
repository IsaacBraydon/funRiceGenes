The phytohormone auxin is one of the most important signaling molecules that undergo accumulation or depletion in a temporal or spatial manner due to wide arrays of changes in developmental or stress programs. Proper distribution, maintenance and homeostasis of auxin molecules across the plant systems are one of the most important phenomena required for proper growth and development of plant. The distribution and homeostasis of auxin is maintained by auxin transport systems across the plant. The auxin transportation is carried out by auxin transporter family proteins, popularly known as auxin efflux carriers (PINs). In this study, a sub-family of auxin efflux carrier (OsPILS) genes was identified from Oryza sativa and relative expression profile was studied by treating them with auxin and cytokinin. Oryza sativa encodes seven putative sub-cellularly localized transmembrane OsPILS genes distributed in five chromosomes. Differential expression of OsPILS genes was found to be modulated by auxin and cytokinin treatment. In auxin treated plants, all OsPILS genes were up-regulated in leaves and down regulated in roots during the third week time period of developmental stages. In the cytokinin treated plants, the maximum of OsPILS genes were up-regulated during the third week time period in root and leaf tissue. Regulation of gene expression of OsPILS genes by auxin and cytokinin during the third week time period revealed its important role in plant growth and development.
