Plant Physiol.	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX Gene Represses a YABBY Gene Expression Required for Rice Leaf Development.	2007	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	YABBY and WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX (WOX) genes have been shown to play important roles in lateral organ formation and meristem function. Here, we report the characterization of functional relationship between rice (Oryza sativa) YAB3 and WOX3 in rice leaf development. Rice YAB3 is closely related to maize (Zea mays) ZmYAB14 and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL), whereas rice WOX3 is highly conserved with maize narrow sheath1 (NS1) and NS2 and Arabidopsis PRESSED FLOWER (PRS). In situ hybridization experiments revealed that the expression of both genes was excluded from the shoot apical meristem, but the transcripts were detected in leaf primordia, young leaves, and reproductive organs without any polar distribution. The function of the two genes was studied by both overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) in transgenic rice. YAB3 RNAi induced twisted and knotted leaves lacking specialized structures such as ligule and auricles, while no phenotypic change was observed in YAB3 overexpression plants, suggesting that rice YAB3 may be required for leaf cell growth and differentiation. Overexpression of WOX3 repressed YAB3 and showed a YAB3 RNAi phenotype. The expression of class I KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX (KNOX) genes was ectopically induced in leaves of YAB3 RNAi or WOX3 overexpression plants. Data from inducible WOX3 expression and DNA-protein interaction assays suggested that WOX3 acted as a transcriptional repressor of YAB3. These data reveal a regulatory network involving YAB3, WOX3, and KNOX genes required for rice leaf development.
Plant Cell	WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice.	2013	Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8654, Japan.	The shoot apical meristem is the ultimate source of the cells that constitute the entire aboveground portion of the plant body. In Arabidopsis thaliana, meristem maintenance is regulated by the negative feedback loop of WUSCHEL-CLAVATA (WUS-CLV). Although CLV-like genes, such as FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER1 (FON1) and FON2, have been shown to be involved in maintenance of the reproductive meristems in rice (Oryza sativa), current understanding of meristem maintenance remains insufficient. In this article, we demonstrate that the FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1) and FCP2 genes encoding proteins with similar CLE domains are involved in negative regulation of meristem maintenance in the vegetative phase. In addition, we found that WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 (WOX4) promotes the undifferentiated state of the meristem in rice and that WOX4 function is associated with cytokinin action. Consistent with similarities in the shoot apical meristem phenotypes caused by overexpression of FCP1 and downregulation of WOX4, expression of WOX4 was negatively regulated by FCP1 (FCP2). Thus, FCP1/2 and WOX4 are likely to be involved in maintenance of the vegetative meristem in rice.
Mol. Biol. Evol.	The shoot stem cell niche in angiosperms: expression patterns of WUS orthologues in rice and maize imply major modifications in the course of mono- and dicot evolution	2006	Institut fur Entwicklungsbiologie, Koln, Germany.	In Arabidopsis, stem cell homeostasis in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is controlled by a feedback loop between WUS and CLV functions. We have identified WUS orthologues in maize and rice by a detailed phylogenetic analysis of the WOX gene family and subsequent cloning. A single WUS orthologue is present in the rice genome (OsWUS), whereas the allotetraploid maize genome contains 2 WUS paralogues (ZmWUS1 and ZmWUS2). None of the isolated grass WUS orthologues displays an organizing center-type expression pattern in the vegetative SAM as in Arabidopsis. In contrast, the grass-specific expression patterns relate to the specification of new phytomers consistent with the transcriptional expression patterns of TD1 and FON1 (CLV1 orthologues of maize and rice, respectively). Moreover, the grass WUS and CLV1 orthologues are coexpressed in all reproductive meristems, where fasciation and supernumerary floral organs occur in td1 or fon1 loss-of-function mutants. The expression patterns of WUS orthologues in both grass species compared with those of dicots imply that major changes in WUS function, which are correlated with changes in CLV1 signaling, have occurred during angiosperm evolution and raise doubts about the uniqueness of the WUS/CLV antagonism in the maintenance of the shoot stem cell niche in grasses.
Mol. Biol. Evol.	WOX Gene Phylogeny in Poaceae: A Comparative Approach Addressing Leaf and Embryo Development	2007	Institut fur Entwicklungsbiologie, Universitat zu Koln, Koln, Germany.	The phylogeny based on the homeodomain (HD) amino acid sequence of the WOX (WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene family) was established in the 3 major radiations of the Poaceae family: Pooideae (Brachypodium distachyon), Bambusoideae (Oryza sativa), and Panicoideae (Zea mays). The genomes of all 3 grasses contain an ancient duplication in the WOX3 branch, and the cellular expression patterns in maize and rice indicate subfunctionalization of paralogues during leaf development, which may relate to the architecture of the grass leaf and the encircling of the stem. The use of maize WOX gene family members as molecular markers in maize embryo development for the first time allowed us to visualize cellular decisions in the maize proembryo, including specification of the shoot/root axis at an oblique angle to the apical-basal polarity of the zygote. All molecular marker data are compatible with the conclusion that the embryonic shoot/root axis comprises a discrete domain from early proembryo stages onward. Novel cell fates of the shoot and the root are acquired within this distinct morphogenic axis domain, which elongates and thus separates the shoot apical meristem and root apical meristem (RAM) anlagen in the maize embryo.
