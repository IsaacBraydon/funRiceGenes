Arch Biochem Biophys	Characterization of soluble and putative membrane-bound UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase (OsUXS) isoforms in rice.	2004	Graduate School of Agriculture and Biological Sciences, Osaka Prefecture University, Gakuen-cho 1-1, Sakai, Osaka 599-8531, Japan.	Arabinoxylans in crop plants are the major sugar components of the cell walls, and UDP-xylose is a key substrate in the biosynthesis of xylans. In this study, the six putative UDP-D-glucuronic acid decarboxylase genes from rice (Oryza sativa UDP-xylose synthase; OsUXS) were cloned. Except for the soluble form of OsUXS3 (GenBank Accession No. \AB079064), the remaining five OsUXS enzymes contain a putative membrane-bound region. The six OsUXS genes were classified into three types by phylogenetic analysis and were expressed during the development of rice seeds. The HPLC retention times of the enzyme products and NMR data, indicate that the recombinant OsUXS2 enzyme catalyzes the conversion of UDP-D-glucuronic acid to UDP-D-xylose. Interestingly, the reactions catalyzed by the recombinant OsUXS2 and OsUXS3 enzymes were inhibited by NADP+, and accelerated by NADPH. The catalytic activities of the recombinant OsUXS2 and OsUXS3 enzymes were strongly inhibited by UDP, UTP, TDP, and TTP. The expression levels of OsUXS genes changed in different manners during the development of rice seeds, suggesting that each corresponding OsUXS enzyme plays a significant role in rice seed development at a certain stage. In the present study, we report that the UXS2-type enzyme of rice is not only characterized for the first time but also show significant findings involved in the gene expression of OsUXSs.
