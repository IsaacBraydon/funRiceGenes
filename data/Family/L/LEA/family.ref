Planta.	Overexpression of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene OsTPS1 enhances abiotic stress tolerance in rice.	2011	Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering Drug and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, People's Republic of China.	Trehalose plays an important role in metabolic regulation and abiotic stress tolerance in a variety of organisms. In plants, its biosynthesis is catalyzed by two key enzymes: trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP). The genome of rice (Oryza sativa) contains 11 OsTPS genes, and only OsTPS1 shows TPS activity. To demonstrate the physiological function of OsTPS1, we introduced it into rice and found that OsTPS1 overexpression improved the tolerance of rice seedling to cold, high salinity and drought treatments without other significant phenotypic changes. In transgenic lines overexpressing OsTPS1, trehalose and proline concentrations were higher than in the wild type and some stress-related genes were up-regulated, including WSI18, RAB16C, HSP70, and ELIP. These results demonstrate that OsTPS1 may enhance the abiotic stress tolerance of plants by increasing the amount of trehalose and proline, and regulating the expression of stress-related genes. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of some Class II TPSs also enhanced plant tolerance of abiotic stress. This work will help to clarify the role of trehalose metabolism in abiotic stress response in higher plants.
Gene	Screening and cloning of antimicrobial DNA sequences using a vital staining method	2009	Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Road, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1H 8M5. xiongying.cheng@vitegen.com	A novel method for cloning of genes coding for cytotoxic molecules based on a cell viability assay is described. The working hypothesis is that expression of DNA sequences coding for cytotoxic molecules in bacterial cells will lead to cell death or impairment, and the isolation of the impaired or dead cells could lead to identification of DNA sequences responsible for debilitating the host cells. We verified this concept by isolating the well known antimicrobial Puroindoline b gene in Escherichia coli cells. We further demonstrated the feasibility to use this approach for isolating DNA encoding for antimicrobials from cDNA expression libraries. Sequence analysis and bioassay indicated that the isolated clones encoded previously characterized antimicrobial proteins (AMPs), proteins not previously characterized as AMPs, as well as novel antimicrobial peptides. In addition, clones harboring ribosomal protein encoding cDNA were also identified. Therefore, this method could also be used to identify host genes important in maintaining bacterial cell viability.

Planta	bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP52/RISBZ5: a potential negative regulator of cold and drought stress response in rice.	2011	Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Regulation of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, People's Republic of China.	OsbZIP52/RISBZ5 is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor (TF) family in rice (Oryza sativa) isolated from rice (Zhonghua11) panicles. Expression of the OsbZIP52 gene was strongly induced by low temperature (4 degrees C) but not by drought, PEG, salt, or ABA. The subcellular localization of OsbZIP52-GFP in onion (Allium cepa) epidermis cells revealed that OsbZIP52 is a nuclear localized protein. A transactivation assay in yeast demonstrated that OsbZIP52 functions as a transcriptional activator and can specifically bind to the G-box promoter motif. In a yeast two-hybrid (Y-2-H) experiment, OsbZIP52 was able to form homodimeric complexes. Rice plants overexpressing OsbZIP52 showed significantly increased sensitivity to cold and drought stress. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that some abiotic stress-related genes, such as OsLEA3, OsTPP1, Rab25, gp1 precursor, beta-gal, LOC_Os05g11910 and LOC_Os05g39250, were down-regulated in OsbZIP52 overexpression lines. These results suggest that OsbZIP52/RISBZ5 could function as a negative regulator in cold and drought stress environments.
Plant Mol. Biol.	Induction of chilling resistance by water stress, and cDNA sequence analysis and expression of water stress-regulated genes in rice.	1994	Plant Genetic Engineering Laboratory, Akita Prefectural College of Agriculture, Japan.	Exposure of seedlings of a chilling-sensitive variety of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Wasetoittu) to water stress (0.5 M mannitol, 30 min) at room temperature induced a degree of chilling resistance. No such resistance was induced by exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) application (10 microM, 60 min). Upon short-term water stress, new transcripts were expressed in both seedlings and suspension-cultured cells. We suggest that the genes induced by short-term water stress, and not those induced by ABA, are related to acquired chilling resistance in this chilling-sensitive rice variety. A total of nine different cDNA clones, specifically induced by short-term water stress, were isolated by differential hybridization and partial sequencing. Northern hybridization analysis using RNAs from the seedlings subjected to chilling after water stress treatment reveal three distinct groups of above mentioned nine cDNA clones: wsi (water stress-induced) 18, 76, and 724, representative of genes whose expression increases, decreases, and remains almost fixed during chilling, respectively. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the three representative clones were determined. Characteristic features of wsi18 are the presence of one set of amino acid sequence repeats, a conserved amino acid sequence common to LEA-group genes in the N-terminal region, and an alanine- and lysine-rich tract in the C-terminal region.
