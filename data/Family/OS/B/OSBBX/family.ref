PLoS ONE	The rice B-box zinc finger gene family: genomic identification, characterization, expression profiling and diurnal analysis.	2012	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	BACKGROUND: The B-box (BBX) -containing proteins are a class of zinc finger proteins that contain one or two B-box domains and play important roles in plant growth and development. The Arabidopsis BBX gene family has recently been re-identified and renamed. However, there has not been a genome-wide survey of the rice BBX (OsBBX) gene family until now. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we identified 30 rice BBX genes through a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. Each gene was assigned a uniform nomenclature. We described the chromosome localizations, gene structures, protein domains, phylogenetic relationship, whole life-cycle expression profile and diurnal expression patterns of the OsBBX family members. Based on the phylogeny and domain constitution, the OsBBX gene family was classified into five subfamilies. The gene duplication analysis revealed that only chromosomal segmental duplication contributed to the expansion of the OsBBX gene family. The expression profile of the OsBBX genes was analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays throughout the entire life-cycle of rice cultivar Zhenshan 97 (ZS97). In addition, microarray analysis was performed to obtain the expression patterns of these genes under light/dark conditions and after three phytohormone treatments. This analysis revealed that the expression patterns of the OsBBX genes could be classified into eight groups. Eight genes were regulated under the light/dark treatments, and eleven genes showed differential expression under at least one phytohormone treatment. Moreover, we verified the diurnal expression of the OsBBX genes using the data obtained from the Diurnal Project and qPCR analysis, and the results indicated that many of these genes had a diurnal expression pattern. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The combination of the genome-wide identification and the expression and diurnal analysis of the OsBBX gene family should facilitate additional functional studies of the OsBBX genes.

To understand the functions of rice homologues of the Arabidopsis flowering-time gene CONSTANS (CO) and salt-tolerance gene STO, we performed a similarity search of the single-run sequence data of cDNA clones accumulated by the Rice Genome Research Program, and isolated seven rice cDNA clones (S3574, C60910, S12569, R2931, R1479, R1577, and E10707) coding for proteins containing one of two zinc-finger-like motifs. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences between these cDNAs and the CO gene revealed significant similarities (46%-61%) in the region of zinc-finger motifs. A domain having a high content of basic amino acids at the C-terminus of the CO protein was found in the corresponding region of proteins predicted by from cDNAs S3574, C60910, and S12569. Two amino acid sequences, "CCADEAAL" and "FCV(L)EDRA," which were present inside each zinc-finger in the Arabidposis regulatory protein STO, were also found in each of the two zinc-finger regions of proteins predicted from cDNAs R2931, R1479, R1577, and E10707. Using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) linkage analysis, we determined the chromosomal location of the seven cDNA clones. The position of R2931 on the RFLP linkage map was closely linked to Hd-3, one of the putative quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling heading date in rice.
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.	Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia.	2013	National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Flowering time (i.e., heading date in crops) is an important ecological trait that determines growing seasons and regional adaptability of plants to specific natural environments. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a short-day plant that originated in the tropics. Increasing evidence suggests that the northward expansion of cultivated rice was accompanied by human selection of the heading date under noninductive long-day (LD) conditions. We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of DTH2 (for Days to heading on chromosome 2), a minor-effect quantitative trait locus that promotes heading under LD conditions. We show that DTH2 encodes a CONSTANS-like protein that promotes heading by inducing the florigen genes Heading date 3a and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1, and it acts independently of the known floral integrators Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1. Moreover, association analysis and transgenic experiments identified two functional nucleotide polymorphisms in DTH2 that correlated with early heading and increased reproductive fitness under natural LD conditions in northern Asia. Our combined population genetics and network analyses suggest that DTH2 likely represents a target of human selection for adaptation to LD conditions during rice domestication and/or improvement, demonstrating an important role of minor-effect quantitative trait loci in crop adaptation and breeding.
