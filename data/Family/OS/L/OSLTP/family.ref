Mol Plant	Evolutionary history of the non-specific lipid transfer proteins.	2011	IFM Molecular Genetics, Linkoping University, 581 83 Linkoping, Sweden.	The non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are small, basic proteins characterized by a tunnel-like hydrophobic cavity, capable of transferring various lipid molecules between lipid bilayers. Most nsLTPs are synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide that localizes the protein to the apoplastic space. The nsLTPs have only been identified in seed plants, where they are encoded by large gene families. We have initiated an analysis of the evolutionary history of the nsLTP family using genomic and EST information from non-seed land plants and green algae to determine: (1) when the nsLTP family arose, (2) how often new nsLTP subfamilies have been created, and (3) how subfamilies differ in their patterns of expansion and loss in different plant lineages. In this study, we searched sequence databases and found that genes and transcripts encoding nsLTPs are abundant in liverworts, mosses, and all other investigated land plants, but not present in any algae. The tertiary structures of representative liverwort and moss nsLTPs were further studied with homology modeling. The results indicate that the nsLTP family has evolved after plants conquered land. Only two of the four major subfamilies of nsLTPs found in flowering plants are present in mosses and liverworts. The additional subfamilies have arisen later, during land plant evolution. In this report, we also introduce a modified nsLTP classification system.

Plant Physiol.	OsC6, encoding a lipid transfer protein, is required for postmeiotic anther development in rice.	2010	School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.	Synthesis of lipidic components in anthers, including of the pollen exine, is essential for plant male reproductive development. Plant lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are small, abundant lipid-binding proteins that have the ability to exchange lipids between membranes in vitro. However, their biological role in male reproductive development remains less understood. Here, we report the crucial role of OsC6 in regulating postmeiotic anther development in rice (Oryza sativa). Found in monocots, OsC6 belongs to a distinct clade from previously identified LTP1 and LTP2 family members found in both dicots and monocots. OsC6 expression is mainly detectable in tapetal cells and weakly in microspores from stage 9 to stage 11 of anther development. Immunological assays indicated that OsC6 is widely distributed in anther tissues such as the tapetal cytoplasm, the extracellular space between the tapetum and middle layer, and the anther locule and anther cuticle. Biochemical assays indicated that recombinant OsC6 has lipid binding activity. Moreover, plants in which OsC6 was silenced had defective development of orbicules (i.e. Ubisch bodies) and pollen exine and had reduced pollen fertility. Furthermore, additional evidence is provided that the expression of OsC6 is positively regulated by a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Tapetum Degeneration Retardation (TDR). Extra granule-like structures were observed on the inner surface of the tdr tapetal layer when the expression of OsC6 was driven by the TDR promoter compared with the tdr mutant. These data suggest that OsC6 plays a crucial role in the development of lipidic orbicules and pollen exine during anther development in rice.
Gene	Rice lipid transfer protein (LTP) genes belong to a complex multigene family and are differentially regulated.	1997	Laboratoire de Physiologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, URA CNRS 1180, Universite de Paris VI, France.	Several cDNA clones encoding three different lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) have been isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) in order to analyse the complexity, the evolution and the expression of the LTP gene family. The mature proteins deduced from three clones exhibited a molecular mass of 9 kDa, in agreement with the molecular mass of other LTPs from plants. The clones were shown to be homologous in the coding region, while the 3' non-coding regions diverged strongly between the clones. The occurrence of at least three small multigene families encoding these proteins in rice was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. When compared with each other and with LTPs from other plants, the cluster including rice LTPs and other cereal LTPs indicated that these genes duplicated rather recently and independently in the different plant phyla. The expression pattern of each gene family was also investigated. Northern blot experiments demonstrated that they are differentially regulated in the different tissues analysed. Components such as salt, salicylic acid and abscisic acid were shown to modulate Ltp gene expression, depending on tissues and gene classes, suggesting a complex regulation of these genes.
Protein Sci.	Lipid binding in rice nonspecific lipid transfer protein-1 complexes from Oryza sativa.	2004	Institute of Bioinformatics and Structural Biology, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan 300, Republic of China.	Nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) facilitate the transfer of phospholipids, glycolipids, fatty acids and steroids between membranes, with wide-ranging binding affinities. Three crystal structures of rice nsLTP1 from Oryza sativa, complexed with myristic (MYR), palmitic (PAL) or stearic acid (STE) were determined. The overall structures of the rice nsLTP1 complexes belong to the four-helix bundle folding with a long C-terminal loop. The nsLTP1-MYR and the nsLTP1-STE complexes bind a single fatty acid while the nsLTP1-PAL complex binds two molecules of fatty acids. The C-terminal loop region is elastic in order to accommodate a diverse range of lipid molecules. The lipid molecules interact with the nsLTP1-binding cavity mainly with hydrophobic interactions. Significant conformational changes were observed in the binding cavity and the C-terminal loop of the rice nsLTP1 upon lipid binding.
J. Biol. Chem.	Solution structure of plant nonspecific lipid transfer protein-2 from rice (Oryza sativa).	2002	Department of Life Sciences, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan 300, China.	The three-dimensional structure of rice nonspecific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP2) has been solved for the first time. The structure of nsLTP2 was obtained using 813 distance constraints, 30 hydrogen bond constraints, and 19 dihedral angle constraints. Fifteen of the 50 random simulated annealing structures satisfied all of the constraints and possessed good nonbonded contacts. The novel three-dimensional fold of rice nsLTP2 contains a triangular hydrophobic cavity formed by three prominent helices. The four disulfide bonds required for stabilization of the nsLTP2 structure show a different pattern of cysteine pairing compared with nsLTP1. The C terminus of the protein is very flexible and forms a cap over the hydrophobic cavity. Molecular modeling studies suggested that the hydrophobic cavity could accommodate large molecules with rigid structures, such as sterols. The positively charged residues on the molecular surface of nsLTP2 are structurally similar to other plant defense proteins.
