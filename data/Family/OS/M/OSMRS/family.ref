Plant Cell Physiol.	Expression and Functional Analysis of the CorA-MRS2-ALR-Type Magnesium Transporter Family in Rice.	2013	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657 Japan.	Maintenance of an appropriate magnesium ion (Mg(2+)) concentration is essential for plant growth. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the CorA-MRS2-ALR-type proteins, named MRS2/MGT family proteins, are reportedly localized in various membranes and they function in Mg transport. However, knowledge of this family in other plant species is extremely limited. Furthermore, differential diversification among dicot and monocot plants suggested by phylogenetic analysis indicates that the role of the Arabidopsis MRS2/MGT family proteins is not the same in monocot plants. For a further understanding of this family in higher plants, functional analysis and gene expression profiling of rice MRS2/MGT family members were performed. A phylogenetic tree based on the isolated mRNA sequences of nine members of the OsMRS2 family confirmed that the MRS2/MGT family consists of five clades (A-E). A complementation assay in the yeast CM66 strain showed that four of the nine members possessed the Mg(2+) transport ability. Transient green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in the isolated rice protoplast indicated that OsMRS2-5 and OsMRS2-6, belonging to clades D and A, respectively, localized in the chloroplast. Expression levels of these genes were low in the unexpanded yellow-green leaf, but increased considerably with leaf maturation. In addition, diurnal oscillation of expression was observed, particularly in OsMRS2-6 expression in the expanded leaf blade. We conclude that OsMRS2 family members function as Mg transporters and suggest that the genes belonging to clade A encode the chloroplast-localized Mg(2+) transporter in plants.
Plant Cell	A root-expressed magnesium transporter of the MRS2/MGT gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana allows for growth in low-Mg2+ environments.	2009	Institut fur Zellulare und Molekulare Botanik, Universitat Bon, D-53115 Bon, Germany.	The MRS2/MGT gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana belongs to the superfamily of CorA-MRS2-ALR-type membrane proteins. Proteins of this type are characterized by a GMN tripeptide motif (Gly-Met-Asn) at the end of the first of two C-terminal transmembrane domains and have been characterized as magnesium transporters. Using the recently established mag-fura-2 system allowing direct measurement of Mg(2+) uptake into mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we find that all members of the Arabidopsis family complement the corresponding yeast mrs2 mutant. Highly different patterns of tissue-specific expression were observed for the MRS2/MGT family members in planta. Six of them are expressed in root tissues, indicating a possible involvement in plant magnesium supply and distribution after uptake from the soil substrate. Homozygous T-DNA insertion knockout lines were obtained for four members of the MRS2/MGT gene family. A strong, magnesium-dependent phenotype of growth retardation was found for mrs2-7 when Mg(2+) concentrations were lowered to 50 microM in hydroponic cultures. Ectopic overexpression of MRS2-7 from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter results in complementation and increased biomass accumulation. Green fluorescent protein reporter gene fusions indicate a location of MRS2-7 in the endomembrane system. Hence, contrary to what is frequently found in analyses of plant gene families, a single gene family member knockout results in a strong, environmentally dependent phenotype.
