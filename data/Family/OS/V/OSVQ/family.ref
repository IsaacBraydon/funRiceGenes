WRKY transcription factors are encoded by a large gene superfamily with a broad range of roles in plants. Proteins containing a short VQ (FxxxVQxLTG) motif have been recently shown to interact with WRKY transcription factors, implying that AtVQ proteins are important in the plant defense responses in Arabidopsis, either as positive or negative cofactors of WRKY transcription factors. Thirty-nine Oryza sativa genes containing the VQ motif (OsVQs) were identified and the genome structures of OsVQ proteins were characterized through genome-wide analysis in rice. Also, phylogenetic tree analysis was performed with the VQ domain of Arabidopsis and rice. The expression patterns of these OsVQ genes in plants under several stress treatments were assessed, specifically, following infection with the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), treatment with abscisic acid (ABA), or exposure to drought. The cellular localization of a few OsVQ proteins was examined using rice protoplast system. Based on our results, we suggest that OsVQ proteins function as important co-regulators during the plant defense response to biotic and abiotic stresses.
