Planta	Molecular characterization and functional analysis of "fruit-weight2.2-like" gene family in rice.	2013	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Tomato fruit-weight 2.2 (FW2.2) was reported to control up to 30 % fruit weight. Recent studies demonstrated that FW2.2-like (FWL) genes also play important roles in plant growth and development. For instance, a maize homolog of FW2.2, named cell number regulator 1 (CNR1), negatively regulates plant and organ size. However, FWL genes in rice have not been characterized yet. In this study, eight FWL genes were identified in rice genome and designated as OsFWL1-8. The chromosome location, gene structure, protein motif, and phylogenetic relationship of OsFWL genes were analyzed. RT-PCR result and microarray data revealed that OsFWL genes exhibited diverse expression patterns and the detailed expression patterns of OsFWL5, 6, and 7 negatively correlated with leaf growth activity. Rice protoplast transient transformation experiment showed that most OsFWL proteins locate at cell membrane but OsFWL8 is present in the nucleus. In addition, the functions of OsFWL genes were investigated by analyzing two T-DNA insertion lines for OsFWL3 and 5. Compared with wild type, the grain weight of osfwl3 mutant and the plant height of osfwl5 mutant were increased by 5.3 and 12.5 %, respectively. We also found that the increase in grain length of osfwl3 mutant was due chiefly to incremental cell number, not cell size and the expression of OsFWL3 negatively correlated with glume growth activity. These results provide a comprehensive foundation for further study of OsFWL functions in rice.
Plant Physiol.	A novel family of cys-rich membrane proteins mediates cadmium resistance in Arabidopsis.	2004	National Research Laboratory of Phytoremediation, Division of Molecular Life Science, POSTECH, Pohang, 790-784, Korea.	Cadmium (Cd) is a widespread pollutant that is toxic to plant growth. However, only a few genes that contribute to Cd resistance in plants have been identified. To identify additional Cd(II) resistance genes, we screened an Arabidopsis cDNA library using a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) expression system employing the Cd(II)-sensitive yeast mutant ycf1. This screening process yielded a small Cys-rich membrane protein (Arabidopsis plant cadmium resistance, AtPcrs). Database searches revealed that there are nine close homologs in Arabidopsis. Homologs were also found in other plants. Four of the five homologs that were tested also increased resistance to Cd(II) when expressed in ycf1. AtPcr1 localizes at the plasma membrane in both yeast and Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtPcr1 exhibited increased Cd(II) resistance, whereas antisense plants that showed reduced AtPcr1 expression were more sensitive to Cd(II). AtPcr1 overexpression reduced Cd uptake by yeast cells and also reduced the Cd contents of both yeast and Arabidopsis protoplasts treated with Cd. Thus, it appears that the Pcr family members may play an important role in the Cd resistance of plants.
