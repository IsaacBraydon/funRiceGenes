Plant J.	DNA binding and dimerization specificity and potential targets for the TCP protein family.	2002	Molecular Genetics Department, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The TCP domain is a plant-specific DNA binding domain found in proteins from a diverse array of species, including the cycloidea (cyc) and teosinte branched1 (tb1) gene products and the PCF1 and PCF2 proteins. To understand the role in transcriptional regulation of proteins with this domain, we have analysed the DNA binding and dimerization specificity of the TCP protein family using rice PCF proteins, and further evaluated potential targets for the TCP protein. The seven PCF members including five newly isolated proteins, were able to be grouped into two classes, I and II, based on sequence similarity in the TCP domain. Random binding site selection experiments and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) revealed the consensus DNA binding sequences of these two classes to be distinct but overlapping; GGNCCCAC for class I and GTGGNCCC for class II. The TB1 protein from maize, which belongs to class II, had the same specificity as the rice class II proteins, suggesting the conservation of binding specificity between TCP domains from different species. The yeast 2-hybrid assay and EMSA revealed that these proteins tend to form a homodimer or a heterodimer between members of the same class. We searched predicted 5' flanking sequences of Arabidopsis genes for the consensus binding sequences and found that the consensus sites are distributed in the genome at a considerably lower frequency. We further analysed eight promoters containing the class I consensus TCP sites. The transcriptional activities of six promoters were decreased by a mutation of the TCP binding site, which is consistent with the observation that the class I TCP site can confer transactivation function on a heterologous promoter. These results suggest that the two classes of TCP protein are distinct in DNA binding specificity and transcriptional regulation.
Plant Physiol.	Constitutive expression of a miR319 gene alters plant development and enhances salt and drought tolerance in transgenic creeping bentgrass.	2013	Department of Genetics and Biochemistry, Clemson University, Clemson, SC 29634, USA.	MicroRNA319 (miR319) is one of the first characterized and conserved microRNA families in plants and has been demonstrated to target TCP (for TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTORS [PCF]) genes encoding plant-specific transcription factors. MiR319 expression is regulated by environmental stimuli, suggesting its involvement in plant stress response, although experimental evidence is lacking and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. This study investigates the role that miR319 plays in the plant response to abiotic stress using transgenic creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) overexpressing a rice (Oryza sativa) miR319 gene, Osa-miR319a. We found that transgenic plants overexpressing Osa-miR319a displayed morphological changes and exhibited enhanced drought and salt tolerance associated with increased leaf wax content and water retention but reduced sodium uptake. Gene expression analysis indicated that at least four putative miR319 target genes, AsPCF5, AsPCF6, AsPCF8, and AsTCP14, and a homolog of the rice NAC domain gene AsNAC60 were down-regulated in transgenic plants. Our results demonstrate that miR319 controls plant responses to drought and salinity stress. The enhanced abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic plants is related to significant down-regulation of miR319 target genes, implying their potential for use in the development of novel molecular strategies to genetically engineer crop species for enhanced resistance to environmental stress.
Ann. Bot.	High time for a roll call: gene duplication and phylogenetic relationships of TCP-like genes in monocots.	2011	Department of Cell Biology and Plant Biochemistry, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany. mariana.mondragon@biologie.uni-regensburg.de	BaCKGROUND AND AIMS: The TCP family is an ancient group of plant developmental transcription factors that regulate cell division in vegetative and reproductive structures and are essential in the establishment of flower zygomorphy. In-depth research on eudicot TCPs has documented their evolutionary and developmental role. This has not happened to the same extent in monocots, although zygomorphy has been critical for the diversification of Orchidaceae and Poaceae, the largest families of this group. Investigating the evolution and function of TCP-like genes in a wider group of monocots requires a detailed phylogenetic analysis of all available sequence information and a system that facilitates comparing genetic and functional information. METHODS: The phylogenetic relationships of TCP-like genes in monocots were investigated by analysing sequences from the genomes of Zea mays, Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa and Sorghum bicolor, as well as EST data from several other monocot species. KEY RESULTS: All available monocot TCP-like sequences are associated in 20 major groups with an average identity &gt;/=64 % and most correspond to well-supported clades of the phylogeny. Their sequence motifs and relationships of orthology were documented and it was found that 67 % of the TCP-like genes of Sorghum, Oryza, Zea and Brachypodium are in microsyntenic regions. This analysis suggests that two rounds of whole genome duplication drove the expansion of TCP-like genes in these species. CONCLUSIONS: A system of classification is proposed where putative or recognized monocot TCP-like genes are assigned to a specific clade of PCF-, CIN- or CYC/tb1-like genes. Specific biases in sequence data of this family that must be tackled when studying its molecular evolution and phylogeny are documented. Finally, the significant retention of duplicated TCP genes from Zea mays is considered in the context of balanced gene drive.
