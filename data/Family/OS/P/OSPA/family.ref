Gene	Primary structural features of the 20S proteasome subunits of rice (Oryza sativa).	2000	Kihara Institute for Biological Research &amp; Graduate School of Integrated Science, Yokohama City University, Totsuka-ku, Japan.	The 20S proteasome is the proteolytic complex that is involved in removing abnormal proteins, and it also has other diverse biological functions. Its structure comprises 28 subunits arranged in four rings of seven subunits, and exists as a hollow cylinder. The two outer rings and two inner rings form an alpha7beta7beta7alpha7 structure, and each subunit, alpha and beta, exists as seven different types, thus giving 14 kinds of subunits. In this study, we report the primary structures of the 14 proteasomal subunit subfamilies in rice (Oryza sativa), representing the first set for all of the subunits from monocots. Amino acid sequence homology within the rice family (alpha-type: 28.9-42.1%; beta-type: 17.2-31. 9%) were lower than those between rice subunits and corresponding orthologs from Arabidopsis and yeast (alpha-type: 49.2-94.5%; beta-type: 34.8-87.7%). Structural features observed in eukaryotic proteasome subunits, i.e., alpha- or beta-type signature at the N-termini, Thr active sites in beta1, beta2 and beta5 subunits, and nuclear localization signal-like sequences in some alpha-type subunits, were shown to be conserved in rice.
FEBS Lett.	Phosphorylation of the C2 subunit of the proteasome in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1997	Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.	Proteasomes function mainly in the ATP-dependent degradation of proteins that have been conjugated with ubiquitin. To demonstrate the phosphorylation of proteasomes in plants, we conducted an enzymatic dephosphorylation experiment with a crude extract of rice cultured cells. The results indicated that the C2 subunit of the 20S proteasome is phosphorylated in vivo in cultured cells. An in-gel kinase assay and analysis of phospho-amino acids revealed that the C2 subunit is phosphorylated by a 40-kDa serine/threonine protein kinase, the activity of which is inhibited by heparin, a specific inhibitor of casein kinase II. The catalytic subunit of casein kinase II from Arabidopsis was also able to phosphorylate the C2 subunit. These results suggest that the C2 subunit in rice is probably phosphorylated by casein kinase II. Our demonstration of the phosphorylation of proteasomes in plants suggests that phosphorylation might be involved in the general regulation of the functions of proteasomes.
Mol. Gen. Genet.	Molecular and biochemical characterization of a proteasome subunit from rice and carrot cells.	1997	Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.	Proteasomes function mainly in the ATP-dependent degradation of proteins that have been conjugated with ubiquitin. We isolated a cDNA clone for a rice protein that exhibited high homology to subunit C2 of proteasomes. Southern blot analysis revealed that the corresponding gene was present as a single copy in the rice genome. After fractionation of a crude extract from cultured cells, a 35-kDa protein that cross-reacted with antibodies against the C2 subunit was recovered in the peak fraction of both 20 S and 26 S complexes. The same antibodies cross-reacted with two proteins in seedlings, one of which was the same as that detected in cultured cells. The level of the protein was reduced in roots under conditions of high salinity. The 35-kDa protein was not detected in the nuclei of rice of carrot cells. However, during somatic embryogenesis of carrot cells, the C2 subunit was found in the nucleus at the globular stage, and it gradually disappeared in the period from the heart to the torpedo stage. Cells at the globular stage are proliferating rapidly, thus, it is possible that proteasomes are associated with the proliferation of plant cells.
