Physiol Plant	Association of specific pectin methylesterases with?Al-induced root elongation inhibition in rice.	2012	Key Laboratory of Conservation Biology for Endangered Wildlife of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	The negative charges of cell wall pectin molecules attributed by pectin methylesterase (PME, EC 3.1.1.11) contribute to Al binding capacity. We examined the expression profiles of 35 members of the PME gene family in the root apex of an Al-sensitive rice 'Zhefu802' under Al stress. While root elongation was inhibited by 40% after 3-h exposure to 25 microM Al, cell wall PME activity and the abundance of eight PME genes transcripts were increased. The same Al treatment which had almost no effect on root elongation of an Al-resistant rice ssp. japonica 'Nipponbare' did not change the expression patterns of these eight PME genes. However, when Al concentration was increased to 50 microM, by which the root elongation of 'Nipponbare' was inhibited by 40% too, the expression of these PME genes were also upregulated except two genes with no signal. These suggest a possible correlation between the upregulated genes and Al-induced inhibition of root elongation in rice. Furthermore, these eight PME genes behaved differently when subjected to CdCl2 and LaCl3 treatments, implying the specificity of different PME genes in response to different metal toxicities. The transgenic rice overexpressing one of these eight PME genes OsPME14 showed higher PME activity and Al content in root tip cell wall, and became more sensitive to Al stress, verifying the involvement of the specific PME gene in Al toxicity. Therefore, our results provided the molecular evidence to connect the expression of specific PME genes with the Al-induced inhibition of root elongation in rice.
J Plant Physiol	Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of rice pectin methylesterases: Implication of functional roles of pectin modification in rice physiology	2015	Graduate School of Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 446-701, Republic of Korea	Pectin, which is enriched in primary cell walls and middle lamellae, is an essential polysaccharide in all higher plants. Homogalacturonans (HGA), a major form of pectin, are synthesized and methylesterified by enzymes localized in the Golgi apparatus and transported into the cell wall. Depending on cell type, the degree and pattern of pectin methylesterification are strictly regulated by cell wall-localized pectin methylesterases (PMEs). Despite its importance in plant development and growth, little is known about the physiological functions of pectin in rice, which contains 43 different types of PME. The presence of pectin in rice cell walls has been substantiated by uronic acid quantification and immunodetection of JIM7 monoclonal antibodies. We performed PME activity assays with cell wall proteins isolated from different rice tissues. In accordance with data from Arabidopsis, the highest activity was observed in germinating tissues, young culm, and spikelets, where cells are actively elongating. Transcriptional profiling of OsPMEs by real-time PCR and meta-analysis indicates that PMEs exhibit spatial- and stress-specific expression patterns during rice development. Based on in silico analysis, we identified subcellular compartments, isoelectric point, and cleavage sites of OsPMEs. Our findings provide an important tool for further studies seeking to unravel the functional importance of pectin modification during plant growth and abiotic and biotic responses of grass plants.
