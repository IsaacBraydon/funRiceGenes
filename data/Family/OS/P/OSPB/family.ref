Gene	Primary structural features of the 20S proteasome subunits of rice (Oryza sativa).	2000	Kihara Institute for Biological Research &amp; Graduate School of Integrated Science, Yokohama City University, Totsuka-ku, Japan.	The 20S proteasome is the proteolytic complex that is involved in removing abnormal proteins, and it also has other diverse biological functions. Its structure comprises 28 subunits arranged in four rings of seven subunits, and exists as a hollow cylinder. The two outer rings and two inner rings form an alpha7beta7beta7alpha7 structure, and each subunit, alpha and beta, exists as seven different types, thus giving 14 kinds of subunits. In this study, we report the primary structures of the 14 proteasomal subunit subfamilies in rice (Oryza sativa), representing the first set for all of the subunits from monocots. Amino acid sequence homology within the rice family (alpha-type: 28.9-42.1%; beta-type: 17.2-31. 9%) were lower than those between rice subunits and corresponding orthologs from Arabidopsis and yeast (alpha-type: 49.2-94.5%; beta-type: 34.8-87.7%). Structural features observed in eukaryotic proteasome subunits, i.e., alpha- or beta-type signature at the N-termini, Thr active sites in beta1, beta2 and beta5 subunits, and nuclear localization signal-like sequences in some alpha-type subunits, were shown to be conserved in rice.
Mol Cell Proteomics	Low temperature treatment at the young microspore stage induces protein changes in rice anthers.	2006	Research Council Centre of Excellence for Integrative Legume Research, Research School of Biological Sciences, Australian National University, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory 0200, Australia. nijat.imin@anu.edu.au	Male reproductive development in rice is very sensitive to various forms of environmental stresses including low temperature. A few days of cold treatment (&lt;20 degrees C) at the young microspore stage induce severe pollen sterility and thus large grain yield reductions. To investigate this phenomenon, anther proteins at the early stages of microspore development, with or without cold treatment at 12 degrees C, were extracted, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and compared. The cold-sensitive cultivar Doongara and the relatively cold-tolerant cultivar HSC55 were used. The abundance of 37 anther proteins was changed more than 2-fold after 1, 2, and 4 days of cold treatment in cv. Doongara. Among them, one protein was newly induced, 32 protein spots were up-regulated, and four protein spots were down-regulated. Of these 37 protein spots, we identified two anther-specific proteins (putative lipid transfer protein and Osg6B) and a calreticulin that were down-regulated and a cystine synthase, a beta-6 subunit of the 20 S proteasome, an H protein of the glycine cleavage system, cytochrome c oxidase subunit VB, an osmotin protein homologue, a putative 6-phosphogluconolactonase, a putative adenylate kinase, a putative cysteine proteinase inhibitor, ribosomal protein S12E, a caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, and a monodehydroascorbate reductase that were up-regulated. Identification of these proteins is available upon request. Accumulation of these proteins did not vary greatly after cold treatment in panicles of cv. Doongara or in the anthers of the cv. HSC55. The newly induced protein named Oryza sativa cold-induced anther protein (OsCIA) was identified as an unknown protein. The OsCIA protein was detected in panicles, leaves, and seedling tissues under normal growth conditions. Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis of OsCIA mRNA expression showed no significant change between low temperature-treated and untreated plants. A possible regulatory role for the newly induced protein is proposed.
