Mol. Genet. Genomics	SUMO-conjugating enzyme (Sce) and FK506-binding protein (FKBP) encoding rice (Oryza sativa L.) genes: genome-wide analysis, expression studies and evidence for their involvement in abiotic stress response.	2008	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, Benito Juarez Road, New Delhi, 110021, India.	We report an in-depth characterization of two major stress proteins namely SUMO-conjugating enzyme (Sce) and peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Sce mediates addition of SUMO group to various cell proteins, through process referred to as SUMOylation. Rice nuclear genome has two putative genes encoding the Sce protein (OsSce1 and OsSce2). PCR-amplified full-length OsSce1 cDNA functionally complemented the growth defect in yeast cells lacking the equivalent Ubc9 protein (ScDeltaubc9). RT-PCR analysis showed that transcript levels of OsSce1 and OsSce2 in rice seedlings were regulated by temperature stress. OsSce1 protein was localized to the nucleus in onion epidermal cells as evidenced by the transient GFP expression analysis following micro-projectile gun-based shooting of an OsSce1-GFP fusion construct. PPIase proteins assist molecular chaperones in reactions associated with protein folding and protein transport across membrane. There are 23 putative genes encoding for FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs; specific class of PPIase) in rice genome. OsFKBP20 cDNA was isolated as a stress-inducible EST clone. Largest ORF of 561 bases in OsFKBP20 showed characteristic FK506-binding domain at N-terminus and a coiled-coil motif at C-terminus. RNA expression analysis indicated that OsFKBP20 transcript is heat-inducible. OsFKBP20 over-expression in yeast endowed capacity of high temperature tolerance to yeast cells. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that OsSce1 protein physically interacts with the OsFKBP20 protein. It is thus proposed that OsSce1 and OsFKBP20 proteins in concert mediate the stress response of rice plants.
