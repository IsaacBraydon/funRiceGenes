The gene OsSRP-LRS (Os03g41419), encoding a putative orthologue of Arabidopsis   gene was OsSRP-PLP (Os11g11500), encoding a non-inhibitory serpin with a surprisingly well-conserved cleaved is known as the stressed-to-relaxed (SR) tran-         (Os11g11500), featured an RCL sequence that strongly                                                                                  of the housekeeping gene, Actin (Os03g50885).

The CP value of 20.00 was convenient because           genes OsSRP-LGC (Os01g56010), -FRS (Os03g41438), the basal expression of Actin (the most highly expressed           -PTY (Os04g45110), -PGY (Os04g45120), -FAS (Os11g12460), gene measured) corresponded to CP ~20.
