Int J Plant Genomics	Structural characterization and expression analysis of the SERK/SERL gene family in rice (Oryza sativa).	2009	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, India.	Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is the developmental restructuring of somatic cells towards the embryogenic pathway and forms the basis of cellular totipotency in angiosperms. With the availability of full-length cDNA sequences from Knowledge-based Oryza Molecular Biological Encylopedia (KOME), we identified the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) genes from rice (Oryza sativa), which also encompasses genes involved in regulating somatic embryogenesis. Eight out of eleven of the rice SERK and SERL (SERK-like) genes have the TIGR annotation as (putative) brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase (precursor). Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was undertaken to quantify transcript levels of these 11 genes. Most of these genes were upregulated by brassinosteroids although only a few of these displayed auxin induction. The expression profile of these genes is nearly uniform in the zygotic embryogenic tissue, but the expression pattern is more complex in the somatic embryogenic tissue. It is likely that OsSERKs and OsSERLs may be involved in somatic embryogenesis and also perform a role in morphogenesis and various other plant developmental processes. Functional validation of these somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase genes may help in elucidating their precise functions in regulating various facets of plant development.
Mol. Cells	A subset of OsSERK genes, including OsBAK1, affects normal growth and leaf development of rice.	2011	Department of Biological Science, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 140-742, Korea.	Since the identification of BRI1-Associated receptor Kinase 1 (BAK1), a member of the Somatic Embryogenesis Receptor Kinase (SERK) family, the dual functions of BAK1 in BR signaling and innate immunity in Arabidopsis have attracted considerable attention as clues for understanding developmental processes that must be balanced between growth and defense over the life of plants. Here, we extended our research to study cellular functions of OsSERKs in rice. As it was difficult to identify an authentic ortholog of AtBAK1 in rice, we generated transgenic rice in which the expression of multiple OsSERK genes, including OsBAK1, was reduced by OsBAK1 RNA interference. Resulting transgenic rice showed reduced levels of Os-BAK1 and decreased sensitivity to BL, leading to semidwarfism in overall growth. Moreover, they resulted in abnormal growth patterns, especially in leaf development. Most of the OsBAK1RNAi transgenic rice plants were defective in the development of bulliform cells in the leaf epidermal layer. They also showed increased expression level of pathogenesis-related gene and enhanced susceptibility to a rice blast-causing fungal pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae. These results indicate that OsSERK genes, such as OsBAK1, play versatile roles in rice growth and development.
