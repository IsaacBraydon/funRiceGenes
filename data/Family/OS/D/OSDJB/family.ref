Cell Stress Chaperones	Functional relevance of J-protein family of rice (Oryza sativa).	2013	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, 110021, India.	Protein folding and disaggregation are crucial processes for survival of cells under unfavorable conditions. A network of molecular chaperones supports these processes. Collaborative action of Hsp70 and Hsp100 proteins is an important component of this network. J-proteins/DnaJ members as co-chaperones assist Hsp70. As against 22 DnaJ sequences noted in yeast, rice genome contains 104 J-genes. Rice J-genes were systematically classified into type A (12 sequences), type B (9 sequences), and type C (83 sequences) classes and a scheme of nomenclature of these proteins is proposed. Transcript expression profiles revealed that J-proteins are possibly involved in basal cellular activities, developmental programs, and in stress. Ydj1 is the most abundant J-protein in yeast. Ydj1 deleted yeast cells are nonviable at 37 degrees C. Two rice ortholog proteins of yeast Ydj1 protein namely OsDjA4 and OsDjA5 successfully rescued the growth defect in mutant yeast. As Hsp70 and J-proteins work in conjunction, it emerges that rice J-proteins can partner with yeast Hsp70 proteins in functioning. It is thus shown that J-protein machine is highly conserved.
Plant J.	Expression of ER quality control-related genes in response to changes in BiP1 levels in developing rice endosperm.	2010	Transgenic Crop Research and Development Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	Binding protein (BiP) is the key chaperone involved in folding of secretory proteins such as seed storage proteins in the ER lumen. To obtain functional information about BiP1, a gene that is predominantly expressed during rice seed maturation, we generated several transgenic rice plants in which various levels of BiP1 protein accumulated in an endosperm-specific manner. Severe suppression (BiP1 KD) or significant over-expression (BiP1 OEmax) of BiP1 not only altered seed phenotype and the intracellular structure of endosperm cells, but also reduced seed storage protein content, starch accumulation and grain weight. Microarray and RT-PCR analyses indicated that expression of many chaperone and co-chaperone genes was induced in transgenic plants, with more prominent expression in the BiP1 KD line than in the BiP1 OEmax line. Transcriptional induction of most chaperones was observed in calli treated with dithiothreitol or tunicamycin, treatments that trigger ER stress, indicating that induction of the chaperone genes in transgenic rice was caused by an ER stress response. In transient assays using rice protoplasts, the ortholog (Os06g0622700) of the AtbZIP60 transcription factor was shown to be involved in activation of some chaperone genes. Slight increases in the BiP1 level compared with wild-type, accompanied by increased levels of calnexin and protein disulfide isomerase-like proteins, resulted in significant enhancement of seed storage protein content, without any change in intracellular structure or seed phenotype. Judicious modification of BiP1 levels in transgenic rice can provide suitable conditions for the production of secretory proteins by alleviating ER stress.
J. Exp. Bot.	Analysis of rice ER-resident J-proteins reveals diversity and functional differentiation of the ER-resident Hsp70 system in plants.	2013	Functional Transgenic Crops Research Unit, Genetically Modified Organism Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) chaperone system participates in protein folding and quality control of unfolded proteins. To examine the roles of co-chaperones in the rice Hsp70 chaperone system in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the functions of six ER-resident J-proteins (OsP58A, OsP58B, OsERdj2, OsERdj3A, OsERdj3B, and OsERdj7) in rice were investigated. The expression of OsP58B, OsERdj3A, and OsERdj3B was predominantly up-regulated in roots subjected to ER stress. This response was mediated by signalling through ATF6 orthologues such as OsbZIP39 and OsbZIP60, but not through the IRE1/OsbZIP50 pathway. A co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that OsP58A, OsP58B, and OsERdj3B preferentially interact with the major OsBiP, OsBiP1, while OsERdj3A interacts preferentially with OsBiP5, suggesting that there are different affinities between OsBiPs and J-proteins. In the endosperm tissue, OsP58A, OsP58B, and OsERdj2 were mainly localized in the ER, whereas OsERdj2 was localized around the outer surfaces of ER-derived protein bodies (PB-Is). Furthermore, OsERdj3A was not expressed in wild-type seeds but was up-regulated in transgenic seeds accumulating human interleukin-7 (hIL-7). Since ERdj3A-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was also detected in vacuoles of callus cells under ER stress conditions, OsERdj3A is a bona fide vacuole-localized protein. OsP58A, OsP58B and OsERdj3A were differentially accumulated in transgenic plants expressing various recombinant proteins. These results reveal the functional diversity of the rice ER-resident Hsp70 system.
Plant J.	Signal transduction by IRE1-mediated splicing of bZIP50 and other stress sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response of rice.	2012	Genetically Modified Organism Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor IRE1 transduces signals by inducing the unconventional splicing of mRNAs encoding key transcription factors: HAC1 in yeast and XBP1 in animals. However, no HAC1 or XBP1 homologues have been found in plants, and until recently the substrate for plant IRE1 has remained unknown. This study demonstrates that the Oryza sativa (rice) OsbZIP50 transcription factor, an orthologue of Arabidopsis AtbZIP60, is regulated by IRE1-mediated splicing of its RNA. Despite the presence of a transcriptional activation domain, OsbZIP50 protein is not translocated into the nucleus efficiently in the absence of OsbZIP50 mRNA splicing. Unconventional splicing of OsbZIP50 mRNA causes a frame shift, which results in the appearance of a nuclear localization signal in the newly translated OsbZIP50. OsbZIP50 mRNA is spliced in a similar manner to HAC1 and XBP1 mRNAs; however, this splicing has very different effects on the translation products, a finding that shows the diversity of IRE1-related transcription factors in eukaryotes. In addition, the expression of OsbZIP50 is affected by ER stress sensor proteins OsIRE1, OsbZIP39 and OsbZIP60. ER stress-related genes differ with respect to their dependency on OsbZIP50 for their expression. The findings of this study improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the plant ER stress response.
