Plant Mol. Biol.	Isolation, characterization and mRNA expression of four cDNAs encoding translation elongation factor 1A from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1998	Institute for Cell Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Japan.	Four different cDNA clones encoding protein synthesis elongation factor 1A, eEF1A, were isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.). The genes encoded by these cDNAs were designated rice elongation factor 1A genes refa1, refa2, refa3 and refa4. The genes encoded identical eEF-1A polypeptides and shared high amino acid identity with eEF1A of other eukaryotes. Southern blot analysis suggested that some of these refa genes may be organized in a cluster on the same chromosome within a short distance. PCR analysis of rice genomic DNA showed that refa1 and refa4, and refa3 and refa2 are in neighboring locations on the rice genome. The mRNAs of the four refa genes accumulated to nearly equal levels in a variety of tissues and at different stages of growth. Suspension-cultured cells were the most abundant in refa mRNAs. Dormant seeds contained a small amount of the four refa mRNAs. Transcript accumulation was highly induced after seed germination, and the same expression levels were maintained even in old leaf blades of mature plants.
Arch. Virol.	Identification and characterization of the interaction between viroplasm-associated proteins from two different plant-infecting reoviruses and eEF-1A of rice.	2013	Institute of Plant Virology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, Fujian, China.	A rice protein homologous to eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF-1A) was found to interact with the Pns6 of rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV), the type member of the genus Oryzavirus, family Reoviridae, in yeast two-hybrid screening. The interaction between the rice protein, designated OseEF-1A, and RRSV Pns6 was confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Besides Pns6, OseEF-1A also interacted with the viroplasm matrix protein, Pns10, of RRSV. When expressed together, OseEF-1A co-localized with RRSV Pns10 in epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana. Pns6 of southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV), a newly reported member of the genus Fijivirus, family Reoviridae, was the only non-structural SRBSDV protein studied here that also interacted with OseEF-1A. Like Pns6 of rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), SRBSDV Pns6 interacted with itself and co-localized with Pns9-1 in N. benthamiana. In the presence of Pns6, OseEF-1A co-localized with Pns9-1, the putative viroplasm matrix protein of SRBSDV.
