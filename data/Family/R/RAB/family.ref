Gene	Screening and cloning of antimicrobial DNA sequences using a vital staining method	2009	Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Road, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1H 8M5. xiongying.cheng@vitegen.com	A novel method for cloning of genes coding for cytotoxic molecules based on a cell viability assay is described. The working hypothesis is that expression of DNA sequences coding for cytotoxic molecules in bacterial cells will lead to cell death or impairment, and the isolation of the impaired or dead cells could lead to identification of DNA sequences responsible for debilitating the host cells. We verified this concept by isolating the well known antimicrobial Puroindoline b gene in Escherichia coli cells. We further demonstrated the feasibility to use this approach for isolating DNA encoding for antimicrobials from cDNA expression libraries. Sequence analysis and bioassay indicated that the isolated clones encoded previously characterized antimicrobial proteins (AMPs), proteins not previously characterized as AMPs, as well as novel antimicrobial peptides. In addition, clones harboring ribosomal protein encoding cDNA were also identified. Therefore, this method could also be used to identify host genes important in maintaining bacterial cell viability.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.	Nuclear proteins bind conserved elements in the abscisic acid-responsive promoter of a rice rab gene.	1990	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10021.	We have previously shown that the expression of a rice gene, rab-16A, is responsive to abscisic acid (ABA) and osmotic stress in plant tissues and cultured suspension cells. We demonstrate here that transcriptional elements between -294 and -52 of this gene are sufficient to confer ABA-dependent expression on the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in rice protoplasts. Sequence motifs within this 242-base-pair region of the rab-16A gene are conserved among the 5' upstream regions of other ABA-responsive genes. Gel retardation and DNAse I experiments show nuclear factor(s) binding to these sequences. This correlative data indicate that these motifs are involved in the transcription of the rab genes and suggest that they may be ABA-responsive-elements (ABREs).
Plant Mol. Biol.	Four tightly linked rab genes are differentially expressed in rice.	1990	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Biology, Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10021.	We have cloned and sequenced the four members of a rice rab (responsive to abscisic acid) gene family that are tandemly arrayed in a locus approximately 30 kbp in length. Each of the genes contains a single, small intron. They are all transcriptionally active and encode proteins of Mr 15,500-16,800 with two highly conserved domains. Northern analysis with gene-specific probes showed slightly different patterns of expression for the four genes in rice plant tissues and in response to osmotic stress. Comparison of the promoter regions revealed a conserved GC-rich sequence (CGG/CCGCGCT) with some homology to the SP1 binding site (Briggs et al., 1986). Another conserved sequence (PuTACGTGGCPu), whose core is found in the promoter regions of ABA-responsive cotton genes, is reminiscent of the cAMP responsive element (Deutsch et al., 1988).
Planta	Comparative functional analysis of six drought-responsive promoters in transgenic rice.	2013	Biological Resources and Post-harvest Division, Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences (JIRCAS), Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8686, Japan, kazuo.nakashima@affrc.go.jp.	Rice production is greatly affected by environmental stresses such as drought and high salinity. Transgenic rice plants tolerant to such stresses are expected to be produced. Stress-responsive promoters with low expression under normal growth conditions are needed to minimize the adverse effects of stress-tolerance genes on rice growth. We performed expression analyses of drought-responsive genes in rice plants using a microarray, and selected LIP9, OsNAC6, OsLEA14a, OsRAB16D, OsLEA3-1, and Oshox24 for promoter analysis. Transient assays using the promoters indicated that AREB/ABF (abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive element-binding protein/ABA-binding factor) transcription factors enhanced expressions of these genes. We generated transgenic rice plants containing each promoter and the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. GUS assays revealed that the LIP9 and OsNAC6 promoters were induced by drought, high salinity, and ABA treatment, and both promoters showed strong activity under normal growth conditions in the root. The other promoters were strongly induced by stresses and ABA, but showed low activity under normal growth conditions. In seeds, GUS staining showed that Oshox24 expression was low and expressions of the other genes were high. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsNAC6 under the control of the Oshox24 promoter showed increased tolerance to drought and high salinity, and no growth defects. These data suggest that the Oshox24 promoter is useful to overexpress stress-tolerance genes without adversely affecting growth.

Plant J.	Over-expression of a single Ca2+-dependent protein kinase confers both cold and salt/drought tolerance on rice plants.	2000	Division of Applied Biosciences, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan.	A rice gene encoding a calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK), OsCDPK7, was induced by cold and salt stresses. To elucidate the physiological function of OsCDPK7, we generated transgenic rice plants with altered levels of the protein. The extent of tolerance to cold and salt/drought stresses of these plants correlated well with the level of OsCDPK7 expression. Therefore, OsCDPK7 was shown to be a positive regulator commonly involved in the tolerance to both stresses in rice. Over-expression of OsCDPK7 enhanced induction of some stress-responsive genes in response to salinity/drought, but not to cold. Thus, it was suggested that the downstream pathways leading to the cold and salt/drought tolerance are different from each other. It seems likely that at least two distinct pathways commonly use a single CDPK, maintaining the signalling specificity through unknown post-translational regulation mechanisms. These results demonstrate that simple manipulation of CDPK activity has great potential with regard to plant improvement.

Planta.	Overexpression of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene OsTPS1 enhances abiotic stress tolerance in rice.	2011	Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering Drug and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, People's Republic of China.	Trehalose plays an important role in metabolic regulation and abiotic stress tolerance in a variety of organisms. In plants, its biosynthesis is catalyzed by two key enzymes: trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP). The genome of rice (Oryza sativa) contains 11 OsTPS genes, and only OsTPS1 shows TPS activity. To demonstrate the physiological function of OsTPS1, we introduced it into rice and found that OsTPS1 overexpression improved the tolerance of rice seedling to cold, high salinity and drought treatments without other significant phenotypic changes. In transgenic lines overexpressing OsTPS1, trehalose and proline concentrations were higher than in the wild type and some stress-related genes were up-regulated, including WSI18, RAB16C, HSP70, and ELIP. These results demonstrate that OsTPS1 may enhance the abiotic stress tolerance of plants by increasing the amount of trehalose and proline, and regulating the expression of stress-related genes. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of some Class II TPSs also enhanced plant tolerance of abiotic stress. This work will help to clarify the role of trehalose metabolism in abiotic stress response in higher plants.
J. Exp. Bot.	OsWRKY45 alleles play different roles in abscisic acid signalling and salt stress tolerance but similar roles in drought and cold tolerance in rice.	2011	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Although allelic diversity of genes has been shown to contribute to many phenotypic variations associated with different physiological processes in plants, information on allelic diversity of abiotic stress-responsive genes is limited. Here it is shown that the alleles OsWRKY45-1 and OsWRKY45-2 play different roles in abscisic acid (ABA) signalling and salt stress adaptation in rice. The two alleles had different transcriptional responses to ABA and salt stresses. OsWRKY45-1-overexpressing lines showed reduced ABA sensitivity, whereas OsWRKY45-1-knockout lines showed increased ABA sensitivity. OsWRKY45-1 transgenic plants showed no obvious difference from negative controls in response to salt stress. In contrast, OsWRKY45-2-overexpressing lines showed increased ABA sensitivity and reduced salt stress tolerance, and OsWRKY45-2-suppressing lines showed reduced ABA sensitivity and increased salt stress tolerance. OsWRKY45-1 and OsWRKY45-2 transgenic plants showed differential expression of a set of ABA- and abiotic stress-responsive genes, but they showed similar responses to cold and drought stresses. These results suggest that OsWRKY45-1 negatively and OsWRKY45-2 positively regulates ABA signalling and, in addition, OsWRKY45-2 but not OsWRKY45-1 negatively regulates rice response to salt stress. The different roles of the two alleles in ABA signalling and salt stress may be due to their transcriptional mediation of different signalling pathways.
