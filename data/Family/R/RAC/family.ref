Plant J.	SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice.	2012	Department of Advanced Bioscience, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kinki University, 3327-204 Nakamachi, Nara 631-8505, Japan.	Rho family small GTPases are involved in diverse signaling processes including immunity, growth, and development. The activity of Rho GTPases is regulated by cycling between guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound inactive and guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound active forms, in which guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) predominantly function to promote activation of the GTPases. In animals, most Rho GEFs possess a Dbl (diffuse B-cell lymphoma) homology (DH) domain which functions as a GEF-catalytic domain. However, no proteins with the DH domain have been identified in plants so far. Instead, plant-specific Rho GEFs with the PRONE domain responsible for GEF activity have been found to constitute a large family in plants. In this study, we found rice homologs of human SWAP70, Oryza sativa (Os) SWAP70A and SWAP70B, containing the DH domain. OsSWAP70A interacted with rice Rho GTPase OsRac1, an important signaling factor for immune responses. The DH domain of OsSWAP70A exhibited the GEF-catalytic activity toward OsRac1 as found in animal Rho GEFs, indicating that plants have the functional DH domains. Transient expression of OsSWAP70A enhanced OsRac1-mediated production of reactive oxygen species in planta. Reduction of OsSWAP70A and OsSWAP70B mRNA levels by RNA interference resulted in the suppression of chitin elicitor-induced defense gene expression and ROS production. Thus, it is likely that OsSWAP70 regulates immune responses through activation of OsRac1.
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.	The small GTP-binding protein rac is a regulator of cell death in plants.	1999	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma 630-0101, Japan.	Cell death plays important roles in the development and defense of plants as in other multicellular organisms. Rapid production of reactive oxygen species often is associated with plant defense against pathogens, but their molecular mechanisms are not known. We introduced the constitutively active and the dominant negative forms of the small GTP-binding protein OsRac1, a rice homolog of human Rac, into the wild type and a lesion mimic mutant of rice and analyzed H(2)O(2) production and cell death in transformed cell cultures and plants. The results indicate that Rac is a regulator of reactive oxygen species production as well as cell death in rice.
Plant Physiol.	Conserved Subgroups and Developmental Regulation in the Monocot rop Gene Family.	2003	Department of Botany and Plant Pathology and Center for Gene Research and Biotechnology, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon 97331, USA.	Rop small GTPases are plant-specific signaling proteins with roles in pollen and vegetative cell growth, abscisic acid signal transduction, stress responses, and pathogen resistance. We have characterized the rop family in the monocots maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa). The maize genome contains at least nine expressed rops, and the fully sequenced rice genome has seven. Based on phylogenetic analyses of all available Rops, the family can be subdivided into four groups that predate the divergence of monocots and dicots; at least three have been maintained in both lineages. However, the Rop family has evolved differently in the two lineages, with each exhibiting apparent expansion in different groups. These analyses, together with genetic mapping and identification of conserved non-coding sequences, predict orthology for specific rice and maize rops. We also identified consensus protein sequence elements specific to each Rop group. A survey of ROP-mRNA expression in maize, based on multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and a massively parallel signature sequencing database, showed significant spatial and temporal overlap of the nine transcripts, with high levels of all nine in tissues in which cells are actively dividing and expanding. However, only a subset of rops was highly expressed in mature leaves and pollen. Intriguingly, the grouping of maize rops based on hierarchical clustering of expression profiles was remarkably similar to that obtained by phylogenetic analysis. We hypothesize that the Rop groups represent classes with distinct functions, which are specified by the unique protein sequence elements in each group and by their distinct expression patterns.
Plant Cell Physiol.	Simple RNAi vectors for stable and transient suppression of gene function in rice.	2004	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma, 630-0101 Japan.	Since the recent sequencing of the rice genome, the functional identification of rice genes has become increasingly important. Various tagged lines have been generated; however, the number of tagged genes available is not sufficient for extensive study of gene function. To help identify the functions of genes in rice, we developed a Gateway vector, pANDA, for RNA interference of rice genes. This vector can be used for Agrobacterium transformation of rice and allows easy and fast construction of efficient RNAi vectors. In the construct, hairpin RNA derived from a given gene is transcribed from a strong maize ubiquitin promoter, and an intron is placed 5' upstream of inverted repeats to enhance RNA expression. Analysis of rice genes using this vector showed that suppression of mRNA expression was observed in more than 90% of transgenic plants examined, and short interfering RNA indicative of RNA silencing was detected in each silenced plant. A similar vector, pANDA-mini, was also developed for direct transfer into leaf cells or protoplasts. This vector can be used for transient suppression of gene function in rice. These vectors should help identify the functions of rice genes whose tagged mutants are not available at present and complement existing methods for functional genomics of rice.
Plant Physiol.	RNA silencing of single and multiple members in a gene family of rice.	2005	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma 630-0101, Japan.	RNA silencing with inverted repeat (IR) constructs has been used to suppress gene expression in various organisms. However, the transitive RNA-silencing effect described in plants may preclude the use of RNA silencing for a gene family. Here, we show that, in rice (Oryza sativa), transitive RNA silencing (spreading of double-stranded RNA along the target mRNA) occurred with the green fluorescent protein transgene but not with the endogenous phytoene desaturase gene. We fused IR copies of unique 3' untranslated regions derived from the rice OsRac gene family to a strong promoter and stably introduced them into rice. Each of the seven members of the OsRac gene family was specifically suppressed by its respective IR construct. We also examined IR constructs in which multiple 3' untranslated regions were fused and showed that three members of the OsRac gene family were effectively suppressed by a single construct. Using highly conserved regions of the two members of the OsRac gene family, we also suppressed the expression of all members of the gene family with variable efficiencies. These results suggest that RNA silencing is a useful method for the functional analysis of gene families in rice and other plants.
