Plant Sci.	TFL1/CEN-like genes control intercalary meristem activity and phase transition in rice	2005	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Department of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China	Members in the TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1)/CENTRORADIALIS (CEN) gene family play important roles in controlling inflorescence architecture and phase transition in several different plant species. To investigate the biological functions of TFL1/CEN homologs in rice, we isolated and analyzed four rice TFL1/CEN-like genes, Oscen1â€“4. We showed that these genes have weak basal expression throughout rice development, and most have distinct expression patterns mainly in the secondary meristems as revealed by mRNA in situ hybridization analyses. The 35S::Oscen1 and 35S::Oscen2 transgenic rice plants exhibit increased numbers of internodes, shortened length and altered radial patterns in the elongated internodes, as well as delayed heading and abnormal panicle architecture. These findings suggest that the TFL1/CEN-like genes in rice play distinct roles in regulating the development of basic structures by stimulating the activities of secondary meristems in the uppermost phytomers.
Plant J.	Overexpression of RCN1 and RCN2, rice TERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIS homologs, confers delay of phase transition and altered panicle morphology in rice	2002	Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Takayama 8916-5, Ikoma, Nara 630-0101, Japan	TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1)/CENTRORADIALIS (CEN)-like genes play important roles in determining plant architecture, mainly by controlling the timing of phase transition. To investigate the possibility of similar mechanisms operating in the control of inflorescence architecture in rice, we analysed the functions of RCN1 and RCN2, rice TFL1/CEN homologs. Constitutive overexpression of RCN1 or RCN2 in Arabidopsis caused a late-flowering and highly branching phenotype, indicating that they possess conserved biochemical functions as TFL1. In 35S::RCN1 and 35S::RCN2 transgenic rice plants, the delay of transition to the reproductive phase was observed. The transgenic rice plants exhibited a more branched, denser panicle morphology. Detailed observation of the panicle structure revealed that the phase change from the branch shoot to the floral meristem state was also delayed, leading to the generation of higher-order panicle branches. These results suggest rice has a pathway that can respond to the overexpressed TFL1/CEN-like functions, and the molecular mechanisms controlling the phase transition of meristems are conserved between grass and dicot species, at least to some extent.
J. Mol. Evol.	Phylogenomic analysis of the PEBP gene family in cereals.	2005	Station de genetique vegetale, UMR de Genetique Vegetale, INRA/UPS/CNRS/INAPG, Ferme du Moulon, 91190 Gif-sur-Yvette, France.	The TFL1 and FT genes, which are key genes in the control of flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana, belong to a small multigene family characterized by a specific phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein domain, termed the PEBP gene family. Several PEBP genes are found in dicots and monocots, and act on the control of flowering time. We investigated the evolution of the PEBP gene family in cereals. First, taking advantage of the complete rice genome sequence and EST databases, we found 19 PEBP genes in this species, 6 of which were not previously described. Ten genes correspond to five pairs of paralogs mapped on known duplicated regions of the rice genome. Phylogenetic analysis of Arabidopsis and rice genes indicates that the PEBP gene family consists of three main homology classes (the so-called TFL1-LIKE, MFT-LIKE, and FT-LIKE subfamilies), in which gene duplication and/or loss occurred independently in Arabidopsis and rice. Second, phylogenetic analyses of genomic and EST sequences from five cereal species indicate that the three subfamilies of PEBP genes have been conserved in cereals. The tree structure suggests that the ancestral grass genome had at least two MFT-like genes, two TFL1-like genes, and eight FT-like genes. A phylogenomic approach leads to some hypotheses about conservation of gene function within the subfamilies.
