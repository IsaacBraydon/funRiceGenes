Plant Mol. Biol.	Presence of three rice sucrose synthase genes as revealed by cloning and sequencing of cDNA.	1992	Department of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei, ROC.	By sequencing cDNA clones, we have concluded that three distinct sucrose genes are expressed in rice (Oryza sativa cv. Tainong 67). When the amino acid sequences deduced from these cDNAs as well as those of known sucrose synthase are compared, the highest divergence is found in the C-termini. The most suitable DNA sequences for use as specific for the mRNA derived from these genes have been suggested.

Plant Cell Physiol.	Differentially and developmentally regulated expression of three rice sucrose synthase genes.	1999	Department of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei, R.O.C.	The spatial and temporal distribution of sucrose synthase (RSuS) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) was studied by Western and immunohistochemical analyses using the monospecific antibodies for three RSuS isoforms. In leaf tissues, RSuS1 was localized in the mesophyll while RSuS2 was in the phloem in addition to the mesophyll. In the roots, only RSuS1 was found in the phloem. No RSuS3 could be detected in any parts of etiolated seedlings. The expression of each RSus gene is closely linked to the seed development. RSuS1 was present in the aleurone layers of developing seeds, and at a low level in endosperm cells. RSuS2 was evenly distributed in seed tissues other than the endosperm. RSuS3 was localized predominantly in the endosperm cells. The tissue specific localizations of the three gene products suggest that RSuS1 plays a role in sugar transport into endosperm cells where the reaction catalyzed by RSuS3 provides the precursor of starch synthesis. RSus2, which is ubiquitously expressed, may play a housekeeping role.

PLoS Genet.	A rice plastidial nucleotide sugar epimerase is involved in galactolipid biosynthesis and improves photosynthetic efficiency.	2011	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Photosynthesis is the final determinator for crop yield. To gain insight into genes controlling photosynthetic capacity, we selected from our large T-DNA mutant population a rice stunted growth mutant with decreased carbon assimilate and yield production named photoassimilate defective1 (phd1). Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed that PHD1 encodes a novel chloroplast-localized UDP-glucose epimerase (UGE), which is conserved in the plant kingdom. The chloroplast localization of PHD1 was confirmed by immunoblots, immunocytochemistry, and UGE activity in isolated chloroplasts, which was approximately 50% lower in the phd1-1 mutant than in the wild type. In addition, the amounts of UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose substrates in chloroplasts were significantly higher and lower, respectively, indicating that PHD1 was responsible for a major part of UGE activity in plastids. The relative amount of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), a major chloroplast membrane galactolipid, was decreased in the mutant, while the digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) amount was not significantly altered, suggesting that PHD1 participates mainly in UDP-galactose supply for MGDG biosynthesis in chloroplasts. The phd1 mutant showed decreased chlorophyll content, photosynthetic activity, and altered chloroplast ultrastructure, suggesting that a correct amount of galactoglycerolipids and the ratio of glycolipids versus phospholipids are necessary for proper chloroplast function. Downregulated expression of starch biosynthesis genes and upregulated expression of sucrose cleavage genes might be a result of reduced photosynthetic activity and account for the decreased starch and sucrose levels seen in phd1 leaves. PHD1 overexpression increased photosynthetic efficiency, biomass, and grain production, suggesting that PHD1 plays an important role in supplying sufficient galactolipids to thylakoid membranes for proper chloroplast biogenesis and photosynthetic activity. These findings will be useful for improving crop yields and for bioenergy crop engineering.
Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem.	Complete structures of three rice sucrose synthase isogenes and differential regulation of their expressions.	1996	Department of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei.	By cloning and sequencing cDNA and genomic DNA and transcription initiation site mapping, the total structures including at least 1 kb of putative regulatory sequences upstream of the transcription initiation sites of three genes encoding rice sucrose synthase isoprotomers were either newly established or amended. The third type of SS gene, RSus3, has not been found in other plants. The structures of the three genes and the gene products were compared and their evolutionary sequence was proposed. Specific probes for the three SS mRNA's were developed and used for analyzing their steady state levels at different organs and under some physiological stress conditions. It appears that RSus2 is a house-keeping gene, RSus3 is highly specific to the grain, and the expression of RSus1 shows a tendency to complement that of RSus3. A possible cause of the presence of the third rice SS gene was discussed. We also reported a novel method to synthesize single-stranded DNA for S1 mapping of a transcription initiation site associated with extended secondary structures.
Physiol Plant	The purine-rich DNA-binding protein OsPuralpha participates in the regulation of the rice sucrose synthase 1 gene expression.	2011	Department of Biochemical Science and Technology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.	The rice sucrose synthase 1 (RSus1) gene is transcriptionally induced by sucrose, and a region within its promoter, at -1117 to -958 upstream of the transcription initiation site, was found to be essential for enhancing the sucrose-induced expression. Further dissection of this region revealed that a group of nuclear proteins interact with a 39-bp fragment named A-3-2 (-1045 to -1007). A protein that specifically and directly interacted with A-3-2 was isolated from the suspension-cultured cells of rice and was subsequently identified as a purine-rich DNA-binding protein. The amino acid sequence of this protein, OsPuralpha, exhibited 73% identity with the Arabidopsis Puralpha-1 protein, and its modeled structure resembled the structure of Pur-alpha in Drosophila. Recombinant OsPuralpha expressed and purified from Escherichia coli was demonstrated to have DNA-binding activity and to interact with A-3-2 specifically. Moreover, OsPuralpha was able to enhance sucrose-induced expression of the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, which was transcriptionally fused to two copies of a DNA fragment containing A-3-2 and the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S minimal promoter, in vivo. The level of OsPuralpha bound to A-3-2 was higher in cells cultured in the presence of sucrose; however, the level of OsPuralpha mRNA in cells was not affected by sucrose. The results of this study demonstrate that OsPuralpha participates in the regulation of RSus1 expression in response to sucrose; nevertheless, it may require other partner proteins for full function.
Mol. Cells	Identification and characterization of the duplicate rice sucrose synthase genes OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 which are associated with the plasma membrane.	2011	Graduate School of Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, 446-701, Korea.	Systematic searches using the complete genome sequence of rice (Oryza sativa) identified OsSUS7, a new member of the rice sucrose synthase (OsSUS) gene family, which shows only nine single nucleotide substitutions in the OsSUS5 coding sequence. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the synteny between OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 is conserved, and that significant numbers of transposable elements are scattered at both loci. In particular, a 17.6-kb genomic region containing transposable elements was identified in the 5' upstream sequence of the OsSUS7 gene. GFP fusion experiments indicated that OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 are largely associated with the plasma membrane and partly with the cytosol in maize mesophyll protoplasts. RT-PCR analysis and transient expression assays revealed that OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 exhibit similar expression patterns in rice tissues, with the highest expression evident in roots. These results suggest that two redundant genes, OsSUS5 and OsSUS7, evolved via duplication of a chromosome region and through the transposition of transposable elements.
Plant Mol. Biol.	A complete sequence of the rice sucrose synthase-1 (RSs1) gene.	1992	Department of Biological Sciences, University of Durham, UK.	Using a fragment of the maize sucrose synthase gene Sh-1 as probe, the rice genome was shown to contain at least three genes encoding sucrose synthase. One of these genes was isolated from a genomic library, and its full sequence, including 1.7 kb of 5' flanking sequence and 0.9 kb of 3' flanking sequence, is reported. The new rice gene, designated RSs1, is highly homologous to maize Sh-1 (approx. 94% identity in derived amino acid sequence), and contains an identical intron-exon structure (16 exons and 15 introns). Both RSs1 and maize Sh-1 show similar sequence homologies to a second rice sucrose synthase gene described recently (designated RSs2, Yu et al. (1992) Plant Mol Biol 18: 139-142), although both the rice genes predict an extra 6 amino acids at the C-terminus of the protein when compared to the maize gene. The RSs1 5' flanking sequence contains a number of promoter-like sequences, including putative protein-binding regions similar to maize zein genes.
Tree Physiol.	Evaluation of four phloem-specific promoters in vegetative tissues of transgenic citrus plants	2012	Citrus Research and Education Center, University of Florida-IFAS, Lake Alfred, FL 33850, USA.	'Mexican' lime (Citrus aurantifolia Swingle) was transformed with constructs that contained chimeric promoter-gus gene fusions of phloem-specific rolC promoter of Agrobacterium rhizogenes, Arabidopsis thaliana sucrose-H(+) symporter (AtSUC2) gene promoter of Arabidopsis thaliana, rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) promoter and sucrose synthase l (RSs1) gene promoter of Oryza sativa (rice). Histochemical beta-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis revealed vascular-specific expression of the GUS protein in citrus. The RTBV promoter was the most efficient promoter in this study while the RSs1 promoter could drive low levels of gus gene expression in citrus. These results were further validated by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting. Southern blot analysis confirmed stable transgene integration, which ranged from a single insertion to four copies per genome. The use of phloem-specific promoters in citrus will allow targeted transgene expression of antibacterial constructs designed to battle huanglongbing disease (HLB or citrus greening disease), associated with a phloem-limited Gram-negative bacterium.
