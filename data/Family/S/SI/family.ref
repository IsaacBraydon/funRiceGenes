Gene	Identification of sucrose-regulated genes in cultured rice cells using mRNA differential display	1995	Institute of Life Science, National Tsing-Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC.	In order to get more information about carbon metabolite regulation pathways, cloning and sequence analysis of sucrose-regulated genes from rice-suspension-cultured cells were performed. We used a new method, mRNA differential display, to screen differentially expressed genes under conditions of 3% and no sucrose in the cultured medium. Six candidate clones were identified and sequenced. Clones SI1 and SI2 were repressed by sucrose starvation, while clones SR1, SR2, SR3 and SR4 were induced by sucrose starvation. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that clone SR2 has 94.8% homology to the salT gene, and clones SI1 and SR3 show 88.3 and 96.9% identity, respectively, to partial cDNA sequences in the GenBank database. The results suggest that mRNA differential display provides an easy and quick way to clone genes involved in the carbon metabolite regulation pathway.
