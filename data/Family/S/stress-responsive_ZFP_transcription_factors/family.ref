Zinc-finger protein (ZFP) is the largest family of DNA-binding transcription factors that also plays an essential role in eukaryote. In plant we have already identified and characterized different useful ZFP-genes. While, the main objective of this research was to observe and identify more targeted stress responsive genes of ZFPs epigenetically throughout genome in rice for the first time. A comprehensive correlation analysis was performed through methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)-chip hybridization in rice under salt and osmotic stresses. High salinity and drought are two major abiotic hazards that are destroying the crop world-wide. As a result, Through-out genome 14 unique stress responsive transcription factors of ZFP-genes with varying level of methylation and expression under two conditions (control vs. stress) were isolated. All the identified genes were confirmed from different databases for their specific structure, cis-regulatory elements, phylogenetic analysis, and synteny analysis. Moreover, the tissue-specific expression patterns, and expression under abiotic and phytohormones stresses were also investigated. Phylogenetically all the genes were divided into 6 distinct subgroups with Arabidopsis and orthologous proteins were find-out through synteny analysis. Available RNA-seq data in response to various phytohormones provided hormone inducible gene expression profile. Through Reverse Transcriptase qPCR (RT-qPCR) analysis tissue-specific expression in shoot and root over various time points against salt and osmotic stresses exhibited the diverse expression patterns of identified genes. Overall, the present study providing a foundation for in-depth characterization of identified genes and to further understand the epigenetic role of DNA methylation for genes expression and environmental stresses regulation in higher plant.
