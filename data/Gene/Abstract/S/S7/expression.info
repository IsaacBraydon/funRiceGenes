S7	 Transformation experiments demonstrated that ORF3 is the candidate gene: down-regulated expression of ORF3 restored spikelet fertility and eliminated absolutely preferential transmission of S7(ai) in heterozygote S7(ai)/S7(cp); sterility occurred in the transformants Cpslo17-S7(ai) Our results may provide implications for overcoming hybrid embryo sac sterility in inter-subspecific hybrid rice and utilization of hybrid heterosis for cultivated rice improvement
