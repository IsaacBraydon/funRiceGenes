SLG1	temperature	Natural variations of SLG1 confer high-temperature tolerance in indica rice	 Dysfunction of SLG1 results in plants with thermosensitive phenotype, while overexpression of SLG1 enhances the tolerance of plants to high temperature
SLG1	seedling	Natural variations of SLG1 confer high-temperature tolerance in indica rice	 SLG1 plays a key role in the response of rice plants to high-temperature stress at both seedling and reproductive stages
SLG1	tolerance	Natural variations of SLG1 confer high-temperature tolerance in indica rice	Natural variations of SLG1 confer high-temperature tolerance in indica rice
