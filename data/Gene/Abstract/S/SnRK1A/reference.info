erq145.pdf	Interference with oxidative phosphorylation enhances anoxic expression of rice alpha-amylase genes through abolishing sugar regulation	2010	J Exp Bot	Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Seoul 143-701, Republic of Korea.	Rice has the unique ability to express alpha-amylase under anoxic conditions, a feature that is critical for successful anaerobic germination and growth. Previously, anaerobic conditions were shown to up-regulate the expression of Amy3 subfamily genes (Amy3B/C, 3D, and 3E) in rice embryos. These genes are known to be feedback regulated by the hydrolytic products of starchy endosperm such as the simple sugar glucose. It was found that oxygen deficiency interferes with the repression of Amy3D gene expression imposed by low concentrations of glucose but not with that imposed by higher amounts. This differential anoxic de-repression depending on sugar concentration suggests the presence of two distinct pathways for sugar regulation of Amy3D gene expression. Anoxic de-repression can be mimicked by treating rice embryos with inhibitors of ATP synthesis during respiration. Other sugar-regulated rice alpha-amylase genes, Amy3B/C and 3E, behave similarly to Amy3D. Treatment with a respiratory inhibitor or anoxia also relieved the sugar repression of the rice CIPK15 gene, a main upstream positive regulator of SnRK1A that is critical for Amy3D expression in response to sugar starvation. SnRK1A accumulation was previously shown to be required for MYBS1 expression, which transactivates Amy3D by binding to a cis-acting element found in the proximal region of all Amy3 subfamily gene promoters (the TA box). Taken together, these results suggest that prevention of oxidative phosphorylation by oxygen deficiency interferes with the sugar repression of Amy3 subfamily gene expression, leading to their enhanced expression in rice embryos during anaerobic germination.
Plant Cell-2007-Lu-2484-99.pdf	The SnRK1A protein kinase plays a key role in sugar signaling during germination and seedling growth of rice	2007	Plant Cell	Department of Life Sciences, National Central University, Jhongli City, Taoyuan County 320, Taiwan, Republic of China.	Sugars repress alpha-amylase expression in germinating embryos and cell cultures of rice (Oryza sativa) through a sugar response complex (SRC) in alpha-amylase gene promoters and its interacting transcription factor MYBS1. The Snf1 protein kinase is required for the derepression of glucose-repressible genes in yeast. In this study, we explored the role of the yeast Snf1 ortholog in rice, SnRK1, in sugar signaling and plant growth. Rice embryo transient expression assays indicated that SnRK1A and SnRK1B act upstream and relieve glucose repression of MYBS1 and alphaAmy3 SRC promoters. Both SnRK1s contain N-terminal kinase domains serving as activators and C-terminal regulatory domains as dominant negative regulators of SRC. The accumulation and activity of SnRK1A was regulated by sugars posttranscriptionally, and SnRK1A relieved glucose repression specifically through the TA box in SRC. A transgenic RNA interference approach indicated that SnRK1A is also necessary for the activation of MYBS1 and alphaAmy3 expression under glucose starvation. Two mutants of SnRK1s, snrk1a and snrk1b, were obtained, and the functions of both SnRK1s were further studied. Our studies demonstrated that SnRK1A is an important intermediate in the sugar signaling cascade, functioning upstream from the interaction between MYBS1 and alphaAmy3 SRC and playing a key role in regulating seed germination and seedling growth in rice.
sigtrans.pdf	Coordinated responses to oxygen and sugar deficiency allow rice seedlings to tolerate flooding	2009	Sci Signal	Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Neihu, Taipei 114, Taiwan, ROC.	Flooding is a widespread natural disaster that leads to oxygen (O(2)) and energy deficiency in terrestrial plants, thereby reducing their productivity. Rice is unusually tolerant to flooding, but the underlying mechanism for this tolerance has remained elusive. Here, we show that protein kinase CIPK15 [calcineurin B-like (CBL)-interacting protein kinase] plays a key role in O(2)-deficiency tolerance in rice. CIPK15 regulates the plant global energy and stress sensor SnRK1A (Snf1-related protein kinase 1) and links O(2)-deficiency signals to the SnRK1-dependent sugar-sensing cascade to regulate sugar and energy production and to enable rice growth under floodwater. Our studies contribute to understanding how rice grows under the conditions of O(2) deficiency necessary for growing rice in irrigated lowlands.
NA	The energy sensor OsSnRK1a confers broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.	2018	Sci Rep	Laboratory of Phytopathology, Department Plants and Crops, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.	Sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase-1 (SnRK1) belongs to a family of evolutionary conserved kinases with orthologs in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeasts (SnF1) to mammals (AMP-Activated kinase). These kinases sense energy deficits caused by nutrient limitation or stress and coordinate the required adaptations to maintain energy homeostasis and survival. In plants, SnRK1 is a global regulator of plant metabolism and is also involved in abiotic stress responses. Its role in the response to biotic stress, however, is only starting to be uncovered. Here we studied the effect of altered SnRK1a expression on growth and plant defense in rice. OsSnRK1a overexpression interfered with normal growth and development and increased resistance against both (hemi)biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens, while OsSnRK1a silencing in RNAi lines increased susceptibility. OsSnRK1a overexpression positively affected the salicylic acid pathway and boosted the jasmonate-mediated defense response after inoculation with the blast fungus Pyricularia oryzae. Together these findings strongly suggest OsSnRK1a to be involved in plant basal immunity and favor a model whereby OsSnRK1a acts as a master switch that regulates growth-immunity trade-offs.
NA	The Rice Small Auxin-Up RNA Gene OsSAUR33 Regulates Seed Vigor via Sugar Pathway during Early Seed Germination	2021	Int J Mol Sci	The Laboratory of Seed Science and Technology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Breeding, Guangdong Laboratory of Lingnan Modern Agriculture, State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.	Seed vigor affects seed germination and seedling emergence, and therefore is an important agronomic trait in rice. Small auxin-up RNAs (SAURs) function in a range of developmental processes, but their role in seed vigor remains unclear. Here, we observed that disruption of OsSAUR33 resulted in reduced germination rates and low seed uniformity in early germination. Expression of OsSAUR33 was higher in mature grains and early germinating seeds. RNA-seq analysis revealed that OsSAUR33 modulated seed vigor by affecting the mobilization of stored reserves during germination. Disruption of OsSAUR33 increased the soluble sugar content in dry mature grains and seeds during early germination. OsSAUR33 interacted with the sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase OsSnRK1A, a regulator of the sugar signaling pathway, which influences the expression of sugar signaling-related genes during germination. Disruption of OsSAUR33 increased sugar-sensitive phenotypes in early germination, suggesting OsSAUR33 likely affects seed vigor through the sugar pathway. One elite haplotype of OsSAUR33 associated with higher seed vigor was identified mainly in indica accessions. This study provides insight into the effects of OsSAUR33 on seed vigor in rice.
NA	SnRK1 stimulates the histone H3K27me3 demethylase JMJ705 to regulate a transcriptional switch to control energy homeostasis	2021	Plant Cell	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Hubei Hongshan Laboratory, Huazhong Agricultural University, 430070 Wuhan, China.	Plant SNF1-Related Kinase1 (SnRK1) is an evolutionarily conserved energy sensing protein kinase that orchestrates transcriptional networks to maintain cellular energy homeostasis when energy supplies become limited. However, the mechanism by which SnRK1 regulates this gene expression switch to gauge cellular energy status remains largely unclear. In this work, we show that the rice histone H3K27me3 demethylase JMJ705 is required for low energy stress tolerance in rice plants. The genetic inactivation of JMJ705 resulted in similar effects as those of the rice snrk1 mutant on the transcriptome, which impair not only the promotion of the low energy stress-triggered transcriptional program but also the repression of the program under an energy-sufficient state. We show that the α-subunit of OsSnRK1 interacts with and phosphorylates JMJ705 to stimulate its H3K27me3 demethylase activity. Further analysis revealed that JMJ705 directly targets a set of low energy stress-responsive transcription factor genes. These results uncover the chromatin mechanism of SnRK1-regulated gene expression in both energy-sufficient and -limited states in plants and suggest that JMJ705 functions as an upstream regulator of the SnRK1α-controlled transcriptional network.
NA	Sucrose nonfermenting-1-related protein kinase 1 regulates sheath-to-panicle transport of nonstructural carbohydrates during rice grain filling.	2022	Plant Physiol	College of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	The remobilization of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) reserved in rice (Oryza sativa) sheaths is essential for grain filling. This assimilate distribution between plant tissues and organs is determined by sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1). However, the SnRK1-mediated mechanism regulating the sheath-to-panicle transport of NSCs in rice remains unknown. In this study, leaf cutting treatment was used to accelerate NSC transport in the rice sheaths. Accelerated NSC transport was accompanied by increased levels of OsSnRK1a mRNA expression, SnRK1a protein expression, catalytic subunit phosphorylation of SnRK1, and SnRK1 activity, indicating that SnRK1 activity plays an important role in sheath NSC transport. We also discovered that trehalose-6-phosphate, a signal of sucrose availability, slightly reduced SnRK1 activity in vitro. Since SnRK1 activity is mostly regulated by OsSnRK1a transcription in response to low sucrose content, we constructed an snrk1a mutant to verify the function of SnRK1 in NSC transport. NSCs accumulated in the sheaths of snrk1a mutant plants and resulted in a low seed setting rate and grain weight, verifying that SnRK1 activity is essential for NSC remobilization. Using phosphoproteomics and parallel reaction monitoring, we identified 20 SnRK1-dependent phosphosites that are involved in NSC transport. In addition, the SnRK1-mediated phosphorylation of the phosphosites directly affected starch degradation, sucrose metabolism, phloem transport, sugar transport across the tonoplast, and glycolysis in rice sheaths to promote NSC transport. Therefore, our findings reveal the importance, function, and possible regulatory mechanism of SnRK1 in the sheath-to-panicle transport of NSCs in rice.
