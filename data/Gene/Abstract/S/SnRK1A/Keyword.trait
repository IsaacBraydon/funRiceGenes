SnRK1A|OsSnRK1a	growth	Coordinated responses to oxygen and sugar deficiency allow rice seedlings to tolerate flooding	CIPK15 regulates the plant global energy and stress sensor SnRK1A (Snf1-related protein kinase 1) and links O(2)-deficiency signals to the SnRK1-dependent sugar-sensing cascade to regulate sugar and energy production and to enable rice growth under floodwater
SnRK1A|OsSnRK1a	seedling	The SnRK1A protein kinase plays a key role in sugar signaling during germination and seedling growth of rice	Our studies demonstrated that SnRK1A is an important intermediate in the sugar signaling cascade, functioning upstream from the interaction between MYBS1 and alphaAmy3 SRC and playing a key role in regulating seed germination and seedling growth in rice
