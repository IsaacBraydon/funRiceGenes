SnRK1A|OsSnRK1a	growth	Coordinated responses to oxygen and sugar deficiency allow rice seedlings to tolerate flooding	CIPK15 regulates the plant global energy and stress sensor SnRK1A (Snf1-related protein kinase 1) and links O(2)-deficiency signals to the SnRK1-dependent sugar-sensing cascade to regulate sugar and energy production and to enable rice growth under floodwater
