SnRK1A	¦ÁAmy3|OsAmy3D|RAmy3D	Interference with oxidative phosphorylation enhances anoxic expression of rice alpha-amylase genes through abolishing sugar regulation	 Treatment with a respiratory inhibitor or anoxia also relieved the sugar repression of the rice CIPK15 gene, a main upstream positive regulator of SnRK1A that is critical for Amy3D expression in response to sugar starvation| SnRK1A accumulation was previously shown to be required for MYBS1 expression, which transactivates Amy3D by binding to a cis-acting element found in the proximal region of all Amy3 subfamily gene promoters (the TA box)
OsMYBS1	SnRK1A	Interference with oxidative phosphorylation enhances anoxic expression of rice alpha-amylase genes through abolishing sugar regulation	 SnRK1A accumulation was previously shown to be required for MYBS1 expression, which transactivates Amy3D by binding to a cis-acting element found in the proximal region of all Amy3 subfamily gene promoters (the TA box)
OsCIPK15	SnRK1A	Interference with oxidative phosphorylation enhances anoxic expression of rice alpha-amylase genes through abolishing sugar regulation	 Treatment with a respiratory inhibitor or anoxia also relieved the sugar repression of the rice CIPK15 gene, a main upstream positive regulator of SnRK1A that is critical for Amy3D expression in response to sugar starvation
OsMYBS1	SnRK1A	The SnRK1A protein kinase plays a key role in sugar signaling during germination and seedling growth of rice	 Rice embryo transient expression assays indicated that SnRK1A and SnRK1B act upstream and relieve glucose repression of MYBS1 and alphaAmy3 SRC promoters| A transgenic RNA interference approach indicated that SnRK1A is also necessary for the activation of MYBS1 and alphaAmy3 expression under glucose starvation| Our studies demonstrated that SnRK1A is an important intermediate in the sugar signaling cascade, functioning upstream from the interaction between MYBS1 and alphaAmy3 SRC and playing a key role in regulating seed germination and seedling growth in rice
SnRK1A	SnRK1B	The SnRK1A protein kinase plays a key role in sugar signaling during germination and seedling growth of rice	 Rice embryo transient expression assays indicated that SnRK1A and SnRK1B act upstream and relieve glucose repression of MYBS1 and alphaAmy3 SRC promoters| Two mutants of SnRK1s, snrk1a and snrk1b, were obtained, and the functions of both SnRK1s were further studied
OsCIPK15	SnRK1A	Coordinated responses to oxygen and sugar deficiency allow rice seedlings to tolerate flooding	 CIPK15 regulates the plant global energy and stress sensor SnRK1A (Snf1-related protein kinase 1) and links O(2)-deficiency signals to the SnRK1-dependent sugar-sensing cascade to regulate sugar and energy production and to enable rice growth under floodwater
