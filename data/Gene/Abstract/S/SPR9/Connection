CHR729|OsCHD3|CRL6|RFS	SPR9	SPR9 encodes a 60 S ribosomal protein that modulates panicle spreading and affects resistance to false smut in rice (Oryza sativa. L).	 RESULTS: In this study, we show that a simple spreading panicle change in rice panicle shape, controlled by the Spreading Panicle 9 (SPR9) locus, also has a significant impact on the resistance to rice false smut (RFS)
CHR729|OsCHD3|CRL6|RFS	SPR9	SPR9 encodes a 60 S ribosomal protein that modulates panicle spreading and affects resistance to false smut in rice (Oryza sativa. L).	 Interestingly, the spr9 mutant was found to improve resistance to RFS without affecting major agronomic traits
