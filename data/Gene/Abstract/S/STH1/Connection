D3	STH1	An α/β hydrolase family member negatively regulates salt tolerance but promotes flowering through three distinct functions in rice.	 Meanwhile, we demonstrated that STH1 forms a protein complex with D3 and a vital regulatory factor in salt tolerance, OsHAL3, to regulate the protein abundance of OsHAL3 via the 26S proteasome pathway
