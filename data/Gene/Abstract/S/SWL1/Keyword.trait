SWL1	chloroplast	A mutable albino allele in rice reveals that formation of thylakoid membranes requires the SNOW-WHITE LEAF1 gene.	 The variegated albino phenotype was caused by insertion and excision of nDart1-0 in the 5&#39;-untranslated region of the SWL1 gene predicted to encode an unknown protein with the N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide
SWL1	chloroplast	A mutable albino allele in rice reveals that formation of thylakoid membranes requires the SNOW-WHITE LEAF1 gene.	 This study revealed that SWL1 is essential for the beginning of thylakoid membrane organization during chloroplast development
SWL1	development	A mutable albino allele in rice reveals that formation of thylakoid membranes requires the SNOW-WHITE LEAF1 gene.	 This study revealed that SWL1 is essential for the beginning of thylakoid membrane organization during chloroplast development
SWL1	chloroplast development	A mutable albino allele in rice reveals that formation of thylakoid membranes requires the SNOW-WHITE LEAF1 gene.	 This study revealed that SWL1 is essential for the beginning of thylakoid membrane organization during chloroplast development
SWL1	stroma	A mutable albino allele in rice reveals that formation of thylakoid membranes requires the SNOW-WHITE LEAF1 gene.	 In the swl1 mutant, formations of grana and stroma thylakoids and prolamellar bodies were inhibited
