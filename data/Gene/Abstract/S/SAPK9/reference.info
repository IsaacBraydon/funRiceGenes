The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) induces gene expression via the ABA-response element (ABRE) present in the promoters of ABA-regulated genes. A group of bZIP proteins have been identified as ABRE-binding factors (ABFs) that activate transcription through this cis element. A rice ABF, TRAB1, has been shown to be activated via ABA-dependent phosphorylation. While a large number of signalling factors have been identified that are involved in stomatal regulation by ABA, relatively less is known about the ABA-signalling pathway that leads to gene expression. We have shown recently that three members of the rice SnRK2 protein kinase family, SAPK8, SAPK9 and SAPK10, are activated by ABA signal as well as by hyperosmotic stress. Here we show that transient overexpression in cultured cell protoplasts of these ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinases leads to the activation of an ABRE-regulated promoter, suggesting that these kinases are involved in the gene-regulation pathway of ABA signalling. We further show several lines of evidence that these ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinases directly phosphorylate TRAB1 in response to ABA. Kinetic analysis of SAPK10 activation and TRAB1 phosphorylation indicated that the latter immediately followed the former. TRAB1 was found to be phosphorylated not only in response to ABA, but also in response to hyperosmotic stress, which was interpreted as the consequence of phosphorylation of TRAB1 by hyperosmotically activated SAPKs. Physical interaction between TRAB1 and SAPK10 in vivo was demonstrated by a co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Finally, TRAB1 was phosphorylated in vitro by the ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinases at Ser102, which is phosphorylated in vivo in response to ABA and is critical for the activation function.
tpc1601163.pdf	Differential Activation of the Rice Sucrose Nonfermenting1-Related Protein Kinase2 Family by Hyperosmotic Stress and Abscisic Acid	2004	The Plant Cell Online	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan	To date, a large number of sequences of protein kinases that belong to the sucrose nonfermenting1â€“related protein kinase2 (SnRK2) family are found in databases. However, only limited numbers of the family members have been characterized and implicated in abscisic acid (ABA) and hyperosmotic stress signaling. We identified 10 SnRK2 protein kinases encoded by the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Each of the 10 members was expressed in cultured cell protoplasts, and its regulation was analyzed. Here, we demonstrate that all family members are activated by hyperosmotic stress and that three of them are also activated by ABA. Surprisingly, there were no members that were activated only by ABA. The activation was found to be regulated via phosphorylation. In addition to the functional distinction with respect to ABA regulation, dependence of activation on the hyperosmotic strength was different among the members. We show that the relatively diverged C-terminal domain is mainly responsible for this functional distinction, although the kinase domain also contributes to these differences. The results indicated that the SnRK2 protein kinase family has evolved specifically for hyperosmotic stress signaling and that individual members have acquired distinct regulatory properties, including ABA responsiveness by modifying the C-terminal domain.
NA	Stress-Activated Protein Kinase OsSAPK9 Regulates Tolerance to Salt Stress and Resistance to Bacterial Blight in Rice.	2019	Rice (N Y)	Institute of Crop Sciences/National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 12 South Zhong-Guan-Cun Street, Beijing, 100081, China.	Salt stress and bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) are key limiting factors of rice (Oryza sativa L.) yields. Members of sucrose non-fermenting 1 (SNF1)-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2), which is a family of plant-specific Ser/Thr kinases, are important components of signaling pathways involved in plant developmental processes and responses to stresses. There are 10 members of the SnRK2 family in rice; however, their functions are poorly understood, as are the underlying molecular mechanisms.In this study, we found that OsSAPK9, which belongs to the SnRK2 family, positively regulated salt-stress tolerance and strain-specific resistance to bacterial blight in rice. RNA sequencing revealed that there were 404 and 1324 genes differentially expressed in OsSAPK9-RNAi in comparison with wild-type plants under salt-stress conditions and after Xoo inoculation, respectively, which participate in basic metabolic processes. In total, 65 common differentially expressed genes involved mainly in defense responses were detected both under salt-stress conditions and after Xoo inoculation. Moreover, in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that OsSAPK9 forms a protein complex with the molecular chaperones OsSGT1 and OsHsp90, and transgenic plants overexpressing OsSGT1 exhibited decreased tolerances to salt stress and significantly increased resistance levels to bacterial blight. Thus, OsSAPK9 may function as a center node regulator of salt-stress responses and disease-resistance pathways through its interaction with OsSGT1 in rice.This study confirms that OsSAPK9 functions as a positive regulator of salt-stress responses and disease resistance through its interaction with OsSGT1 in rice.
NA	Endogenous ABA alleviates rice ammonium toxicity by reducing ROS and free ammonium via regulation of the SAPK9-bZIP20 pathway 	2020	J Exp Bot	  State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.	Ammonium (NH4+) is one of the principal nitrogen (N) sources in soils, but is typically toxic already at intermediate concentrations. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a pivotal role in responses to environmental stresses. However, the role of ABA under high-NH4+ stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is only marginally understood. Here, we report that elevated NH4+ can significantly accelerate tissue ABA accumulation. Mutants with high (Osaba8ox) and low levels of ABA (Osphs3-1) exhibit elevated tolerance or sensitivity to high-NH4+ stress, respectively. Furthermore, ABA can decrease NH4+-induced oxidative damage and tissue NH4+ accumulation by enhancing antioxidant and glutamine synthetase (GS)/glutamate synthetasae (GOGAT) enzyme activities. Using RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR approaches, we ascertain that two genes, OsSAPK9 and OsbZIP20, are induced both by high NH4+ and by ABA. Our data indicate that OsSAPK9 interacts with OsbZIP20, and can phosphorylate OsbZIP20 and activate its function. When OsSAPK9 or OsbZIP20 are knocked out in rice, ABA-mediated antioxidant and GS/GOGAT activity enhancement under high-NH4+ stress disappear, and the two mutants are more sensitive to high-NH4+ stress compared with their wild types. Taken together, our results suggest that ABA plays a positive role in regulating the OsSAPK9-OsbZIP20 pathway in rice to increase tolerance to high-NH4+ stress.
