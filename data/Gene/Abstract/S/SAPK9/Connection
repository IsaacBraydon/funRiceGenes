OsPIE3|OsPUB16	SAPK9|OsSAPK9	Rice OsPUB16 modulates the &#x27;SAPK9-OsMADS23-OsAOC&#x27; pathway to reduce plant water-deficit tolerance by repressing ABA and JA biosynthesis.	 Mechanistic investigations revealed that OsPUB16 mediated the ubiquitination and degradation of OsMADS23, which is the substrate of OSMOTIC STRESS/ABA-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 9 (SAPK9) and increases rice drought tolerance by promoting ABA biosynthesis

OsNF-YA3	SAPK9|OsSAPK9	OsNF-YA3 regulates plant growth and osmotic stress tolerance by interacting with SLR1 and SAPK9 in rice.	OsNF-YA3 regulates plant growth and osmotic stress tolerance by interacting with SLR1 and SAPK9 in rice.
OsNF-YA3	SAPK9|OsSAPK9	OsNF-YA3 regulates plant growth and osmotic stress tolerance by interacting with SLR1 and SAPK9 in rice.	 Furthermore, OSMOTIC STRESS/ABA-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 9 (SAPK9), the positive component in ABA signaling, interacts with OsNF-YA3 and mediates OsNF-YA3 phosphorylation, resulting in its degradation in plants
