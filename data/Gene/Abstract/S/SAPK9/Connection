OsSAPK8|SAPK8	SAPK9|OsSAPK9	Abscisic acid-activated SNRK2 protein kinases function in the gene-regulation pathway of ABA signal transduction by phosphorylating ABA response element-binding factors	We have shown recently that three members of the rice SnRK2 protein kinase family, SAPK8, SAPK9 and SAPK10, are activated by ABA signal as well as by hyperosmotic stress
SAPK10|OsSAPK10	SAPK9|OsSAPK9	Abscisic acid-activated SNRK2 protein kinases function in the gene-regulation pathway of ABA signal transduction by phosphorylating ABA response element-binding factors	We have shown recently that three members of the rice SnRK2 protein kinase family, SAPK8, SAPK9 and SAPK10, are activated by ABA signal as well as by hyperosmotic stress
OsPIE3|OsPUB16	SAPK9|OsSAPK9	Rice OsPUB16 modulates the &#x27;SAPK9-OsMADS23-OsAOC&#x27; pathway to reduce plant water-deficit tolerance by repressing ABA and JA biosynthesis.	 Mechanistic investigations revealed that OsPUB16 mediated the ubiquitination and degradation of OsMADS23, which is the substrate of OSMOTIC STRESS/ABA-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 9 (SAPK9) and increases rice drought tolerance by promoting ABA biosynthesis
