SUI3	PSS domain	SUI-family genes encode phosphatidylserine synthases and regulate stem development in rice 	The truncated SUI3 possesses the intact PSS domain indicating that NF1828 is a leaky mutation of SUI3
SUI3	internode development	SUI-family genes encode phosphatidylserine synthases and regulate stem development in rice 	This result demonstrates that SUI3 also plays a role in internode development in rice.
