SUI3	PSS domain	SUI-family genes encode phosphatidylserine synthases and regulate stem development in rice 	The truncated SUI3 possesses the intact PSS domain indicating that NF1828 is a leaky mutation of SUI3
SUI3	internode development	SUI-family genes encode phosphatidylserine synthases and regulate stem development in rice 	This result demonstrates that SUI3 also plays a role in internode development in rice.
SUI3	panicle	SUI-family genes encode phosphatidylserine synthases and regulate stem development in rice 	We showed that sui2 mutations and transgenic plants with down-regulation of SUI1, SUI2, and SUI3 impaired the development of the panicle.
