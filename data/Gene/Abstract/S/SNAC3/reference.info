NA	A stress-responsive NAC transcription factor SNAC3 confers heat and drought tolerance through modulation of reactive oxygen species in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Adverse environmental conditions such as high temperature and drought stress greatly limit the growth and production of crops worldwide. Several NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) proteins have been documented as important regulators in stress responses, but the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, a stress-responsive NAC gene, SNAC3 (ONAC003, LOC_Os01g09550), conferring drought and heat tolerance in rice is reported. SNAC3 was ubiquitously expressed and its transcript level was induced by drought, high temperature, salinity stress, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Overexpression (OE) of SNAC3 in rice resulted in enhanced tolerance to high temperature, drought, and oxidative stress caused by methyl viologen (MV), whereas suppression of SNAC3 by RNAi resulted in increased sensitivity to these stresses. The SNAC3-OE transgenic plants exhibited significantly lower levels of H2O2, malondiadehyde (MDA), and relative electrolyte leakage than the wild-type control under heat stress conditions, implying that SNAC3 may confer stress tolerance by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Quantitative PCR experiments showed that the expression of a large number of ROS-scavenging genes was dramatically increased in the SNAC3-OE plants, but significantly decreased in the SNAC3-RNAi transgenic plants. Five ROS-associated genes which were up-regulated in SNAC3-OE plants showed co-expression patterns with SNAC3, and three of the co-expressed ROS-associated enzyme genes were verified to be direct target genes of SNAC3. These results suggest that SNAC3 plays important roles in stress responses, and it is likely to be useful for engineering crops with improved tolerance to heat and drought stress.
NA	NAC transcription factor ONAC066 positively regulates disease resistance by suppressing the ABA signaling pathway in rice	2018	Plant Mol Biol	Guangdong Key Laboratory of New Technology in Rice Breeding, Rice Research Institute, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Wushan, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, 510640, China.	This is the first time to dissect the mechanism of NACs-mediated disease resistance in plants using metabolomic approach and discover the involvement of ABA signaling pathway in NACs-mediated disease resistance. NAC transcription factors have been validated as important regulators in stress responses, but their molecular mechanisms in plant disease resistance are still largely unknown. Here we report that the NAC gene ONAC066 (LOC_Os01g09550) is significantly activated by rice blast infection. ONAC066 is ubiquitously expressed and this protein is localized in the nucleus. Overexpression of ONAC066 quantitatively enhances resistance to blast disease and bacterial blight in rice. The transcript levels of PR genes are also dramatically induced in ONAC066 overexpressing plants. Exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) strongly activates the transcription of ONAC066 in rice. Further analysis shows that overexpression of ONAC066 remarkably suppresses the expression of ABA-related genes, whereas there  are no obvious differences for salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA)-related genes between wild-type and ONAC066 overexpressing plants. Consistently, lower endogenous ABA levels are identified in ONAC066 overexpressing plants compared with wild-type plants before and after blast inoculation, while no significant differences are observed for the SA and JA levels. Yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrate that ONAC066 directly binds to the promoters of LIP9 and NCED4 to modulate their expression. Moreover, the metabolomic study reveals that the ONAC066 overexpressing plants accumulated higher contents of soluble sugars and amino acids both before and after pathogen attack, when compared to wild-type plants. Taken together, our results suggest that ONAC066 positively regulates rice resistance to blast and bacterial blight, and ONAC066 exerts its functions on disease resistance by modulating of ABA signaling pathway, sugars and amino acids accumulation in rice.
NA	Rice NAC transcription factor ONAC066 functions as a positive regulator of drought and oxidative stress response.	2019	BMC Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory for Rice Biology, Institute of Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	NAC (NAM, ATAF and CUC) transcriptional factors constitute a large family with more than 150 members in rice and several members of this family have been demonstrated to play crucial roles in rice abiotic stress response. In the present study, we report the function of a novel stress-responsive NAC gene, ONAC066, in rice drought and oxidative stress tolerance.ONAC066 was localized in nuclei of cells when transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana and is a transcription activator with the binding ability to NAC recognition sequence (NACRS) and AtJUB1 binding site (JBS). Expression of ONAC066 was significantly induced by PEG, NaCl, H2O2 and abscisic acid (ABA). Overexpression of ONAC066 in transgenic rice improved drought and oxidative stress tolerance and increased ABA sensitivity, accompanied with decreased rate of water loss, increased contents of proline and soluble sugars, decreased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and upregulated expression of stress-related genes under drought stress condition. By contrast, RNAi-mediated suppression of ONAC066 attenuated drought and oxidative stress tolerance and decreased ABA sensitivity, accompanied with increased rate of water loss, decreased contents of proline and soluble sugars, elevated accumulation of ROS and downregulated expression of stress-related genes under drought stress condition. Furthermore, yeast one hybrid and chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR analyses revealed that ONAC066 bound directly to a JBS-like cis-elements in OsDREB2A promoter and activated the transcription of OsDREB2A.ONAC066 is a nucleus-localized transcription activator that can respond to multiple abiotic stress factors. Functional analyses using overexpression and RNAi-mediated suppression transgenic lines demonstrate that ONAC066 is a positive regulator of drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice.
NA	Knockout of the OsNAC006 Transcription Factor Causes Drought and Heat Sensitivity in Rice.	2020	Int J Mol Sci	College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.	Rice (Oryza sativa) responds to various abiotic stresses during growth. Plant-specific NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2 (NAC) transcription factors (TFs) play an important role in controlling numerous vital growth and developmental processes. To date, 170 NAC TFs have been reported in rice, but their roles remain largely unknown. Herein, we discovered that the TF OsNAC006 is constitutively expressed in rice, and regulated by H2O2, cold, heat, abscisic acid (ABA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), gibberellin (GA), NaCl, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 treatments. Furthermore, knockout of OsNAC006 using the CRISPR-Cas9 system resulted in drought and heat sensitivity. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) transcriptome analysis revealed that OsNAC006 regulates the expression of genes mainly involved in response to stimuli, oxidoreductase activity, cofactor binding, and membrane-related pathways. Our findings elucidate the important role of OsNAC006 in drought responses, and provide valuable information for genetic manipulation to enhance stress tolerance in future plant breeding programs.
NA	ONAC066, A Stress-Responsive NAC Transcription Activator, Positively Contributes to Rice Immunity Against Magnaprothe oryzae Through Modulating Expression of OsWRKY62 and Three Cytochrome P450 Genes.	2021	Front Plant Sci	National Key Laboratory for Rice Biology, Institute of Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	NAC transcriptional factors constitute a large family in rice and some of them have been demonstrated to play crucial roles in rice immunity. The present study investigated the function and mechanism of ONAC066 in rice immunity. ONAC066 shows transcription activator activity that depends on its C-terminal region in rice cells. ONAC066-OE plants exhibited enhanced resistance while ONAC066-Ri and onac066-1 plants showed attenuated resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae. A total of 81 genes were found to be up-regulated in ONAC066-OE plants, and 26 of them were predicted to be induced by M. oryzae. Four OsWRKY genes, including OsWRKY45 and OsWRKY62, were up-regulated in ONAC066-OE plants but down-regulated in ONAC066-Ri plants. ONAC066 bound to NAC core-binding site in OsWRKY62 promoter and activated OsWRKY62 expression, indicating that OsWRKY62 is a ONAC066 target. A set of cytochrome P450 genes were found to be co-expressed with ONAC066 and 5 of them were up-regulated in ONAC066-OE plants but down-regulated in ONAC066-Ri plants. ONAC066 bound to promoters of cytochrome P450 genes LOC_Os02g30110, LOC_Os06g37300, and LOC_Os02g36150 and activated their transcription, indicating that these three cytochrome P450 genes are ONAC066 targets. These results suggest that ONAC066, as a transcription activator, positively contributes to rice immunity through modulating the expression of OsWRKY62 and a set of cytochrome P450 genes to activate defense response.
