OsDREB2A	SNAC3|ONAC066|OsNAC006	Rice NAC transcription factor ONAC066 functions as a positive regulator of drought and oxidative stress response.	 Furthermore, yeast one hybrid and chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR analyses revealed that ONAC066 bound directly to a JBS-like cis-elements in OsDREB2A promoter and activated the transcription of OsDREB2A
OsWRKY62	SNAC3|ONAC066|OsNAC006	ONAC066, A Stress-Responsive NAC Transcription Activator, Positively Contributes to Rice Immunity Against Magnaprothe oryzae Through Modulating Expression of OsWRKY62 and Three Cytochrome P450 Genes.	ONAC066, A Stress-Responsive NAC Transcription Activator, Positively Contributes to Rice Immunity Against Magnaprothe oryzae Through Modulating Expression of OsWRKY62 and Three Cytochrome P450 Genes.
OsWRKY62	SNAC3|ONAC066|OsNAC006	ONAC066, A Stress-Responsive NAC Transcription Activator, Positively Contributes to Rice Immunity Against Magnaprothe oryzae Through Modulating Expression of OsWRKY62 and Three Cytochrome P450 Genes.	 ONAC066 bound to NAC core-binding site in OsWRKY62 promoter and activated OsWRKY62 expression, indicating that OsWRKY62 is a ONAC066 target
OsWRKY62	SNAC3|ONAC066|OsNAC006	ONAC066, A Stress-Responsive NAC Transcription Activator, Positively Contributes to Rice Immunity Against Magnaprothe oryzae Through Modulating Expression of OsWRKY62 and Three Cytochrome P450 Genes.	 These results suggest that ONAC066, as a transcription activator, positively contributes to rice immunity through modulating the expression of OsWRKY62 and a set of cytochrome P450 genes to activate defense response
ONAC096	SNAC3|ONAC066|OsNAC006	A Pathogen-Inducible Rice NAC Transcription Factor ONAC096 Contributes to Immunity Against Magnaprothe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae by Direct Binding to the Promoters of OsRap2.6, OsWRKY62, and OsPAL1.	 ONAC096 interacts with ONAC066, which is a positive regulator of rice immunity
