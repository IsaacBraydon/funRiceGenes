SNAC3	 Overexpression (OE) of SNAC3 in rice resulted in enhanced tolerance to high temperature, drought, and oxidative stress caused by methyl viologen (MV), whereas suppression of SNAC3 by RNAi resulted in increased sensitivity to these stresses |  Quantitative PCR experiments showed that the expression of a large number of ROS-scavenging genes was dramatically increased in the SNAC3-OE plants, but significantly decreased in the SNAC3-RNAi transgenic plants |  Five ROS-associated genes which were up-regulated in SNAC3-OE plants showed co-expression patterns with SNAC3, and three of the co-expressed ROS-associated enzyme genes were verified to be direct target genes of SNAC3	 Overexpression (OE) of SNAC3 in rice resulted in enhanced tolerance to high temperature, drought, and oxidative stress caused by methyl viologen (MV), whereas suppression of SNAC3 by RNAi resulted in increased sensitivity to these stresses	 Overexpression (OE) of SNAC3 in rice resulted in enhanced tolerance to high temperature, drought, and oxidative stress caused by methyl viologen (MV), whereas suppression of SNAC3 by RNAi resulted in increased sensitivity to these stresses |  Quantitative PCR experiments showed that the expression of a large number of ROS-scavenging genes was dramatically increased in the SNAC3-OE plants, but significantly decreased in the SNAC3-RNAi transgenic plants
SNAC3|ONAC066	 Expression of ONAC066 was significantly induced by PEG, NaCl, H2O2 and abscisic acid (ABA) |  Overexpression of ONAC066 in transgenic rice improved drought and oxidative stress tolerance and increased ABA sensitivity, accompanied with decreased rate of water loss, increased contents of proline and soluble sugars, decreased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and upregulated expression of stress-related genes under drought stress condition |  By contrast, RNAi-mediated suppression of ONAC066 attenuated drought and oxidative stress tolerance and decreased ABA sensitivity, accompanied with increased rate of water loss, decreased contents of proline and soluble sugars, elevated accumulation of ROS and downregulated expression of stress-related genes under drought stress condition |  Functional analyses using overexpression and RNAi-mediated suppression transgenic lines demonstrate that ONAC066 is a positive regulator of drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice	 Overexpression of ONAC066 in transgenic rice improved drought and oxidative stress tolerance and increased ABA sensitivity, accompanied with decreased rate of water loss, increased contents of proline and soluble sugars, decreased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and upregulated expression of stress-related genes under drought stress condition |  Functional analyses using overexpression and RNAi-mediated suppression transgenic lines demonstrate that ONAC066 is a positive regulator of drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice	 By contrast, RNAi-mediated suppression of ONAC066 attenuated drought and oxidative stress tolerance and decreased ABA sensitivity, accompanied with increased rate of water loss, decreased contents of proline and soluble sugars, elevated accumulation of ROS and downregulated expression of stress-related genes under drought stress condition |  Functional analyses using overexpression and RNAi-mediated suppression transgenic lines demonstrate that ONAC066 is a positive regulator of drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice
SNAC3|ONAC066|OsNAC006	 The results revealed that SNAC3 overexpression significantly improved rice tolerance to As stress and boosted grain yield traits |  Under both levels of As stress (25 and 50 ÂµM), SNAC3-OX rice lines exhibited significantly lower levels of oxidative stress biomarkers and OsCRY1b (cryptochrome 1b) expression, but they revealed increased levels of gas exchange characters, chlorophyll, osmolytes (soluble sugars, proteins, proline, phenols, and flavonoids), antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, APX, and POD), and stress-tolerant genes expression (OsSOD-Cu/Zn, OsCATA, OsCATB, OsAPX2, OsLEA3, OsDREB2B, OsDREB2A, OsSNAC2, and OsSNAC1) in comparison to wild-type plants |  Taken together, this study is the first to demonstrate that SNAC3 plays a vital role in boosting As stress resistance and grain productivity in rice through modulating antioxidants, photosynthesis, osmolyte accumulation, and stress-related genes expression, and may be a useful candidate for further genetic enhancement of stress resistance in many crops	 The results revealed that SNAC3 overexpression significantly improved rice tolerance to As stress and boosted grain yield traits	 Two SNAC3-overexpressing (SNAC3-OX) and two SNAC3-RNAi transgenic lines were created and validated |  By contrast, SNAC3 suppression (RNAi) reduced grain yield components and reversed the aforementioned measured physio-biochemical and molecular traits
