Reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) play a pivotal role in the hypersensitive response (HR) in disease resistance. NADPH oxidase is a major source of ROI; however, the mechanisms of its regulation are unclear. Rice spl mutants spontaneously form lesions which resemble those occurring during the HR, suggesting that the mutations affect regulation of the HR. We found that spl2, spl7 and spl11 mutant cells accumulated increased amounts of H(2)O(2) in response to rice blast fungal elicitor. Increased accumulation of ROIs was suppressed by inhibition of NADPH oxidase in the spl cells, and was also observed in the ozone-exposed spl plants. These mutants have sufficient activities of ROI-scavenging enzymes compared with the wild type. In addition, spl7 mutant cells accumulated higher amounts of H(2)O(2) when treated with calyculin A (CA), an inhibitor of protein phosphatase. Furthermore, spl2 mutant plants exhibited accelerated accumulation of H(2)O(2) and increased rates of cell death in response to wounding. These results suggest that the spl2, spl7 and spl11 mutants are defective in the regulation of NADPH oxidase, and the spl7 mutation may give rise to enhancement of the signaling pathway which protein dephosphorylation controls, while the spl2 mutation affects both the pathogen-induced and wound-induced signaling pathways.
PNAS-2002-Yamanouchi-7530-5.pdf	A rice spotted leaf gene, Spl7, encodes a heat stress transcription factor protein	2002	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Institute of the Society for Techno-Innovation of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0854, Japan.	A rice spotted leaf (lesion-mimic) gene, Spl7, was identified by map-based cloning. High-resolution mapping with cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers enabled us to define a genomic region of 3 kb as a candidate for Spl7. We found one ORF that showed high similarity to a heat stress transcription factor (HSF). Transgenic analysis verified the function of the candidate gene for Spl7: leaf spot development was suppressed in spl7 mutants with a wild-type Spl7 transgene. Thus, we conclude that Spl7 encodes the HSF protein. The transcript of spl7 was observed in mutant plants. The levels of mRNAs (Spl7 in wild type and spl7 in mutant) increased under heat stress. Sequence analysis revealed only one base substitution in the HSF DNA-binding domain of the mutant allele, causing a change from tryptophan to cysteine.
NA	Cadmium induced a non-coding RNA microRNA535 mediates Cd accumulation in rice.	2022	J Environ Sci (China)	College of Environment, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, China; Institute of Crop Science, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China; Institute of Crops, Hangzhou Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou 310021, China.	Identifying key regulators related to cadmium (Cd) tolerance and accumulation is the main factor for genetic engineering to improve plants for bioremediation and ensure crop food safety. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), as fine-tuning regulators of genes, participate in various abiotic stress processes. MiR535 is an ancient conserved non-coding small RNA in land plants, positively responding to Cd stress. We investigated the effects of knocking out (mir535) and overexpressing miR535 (mir535 and OE535) under Cd stress in rice plants in this study. The mir535 plants showed better Cd tolerance than wild type (WT), whereas the OE535 showed the opposite effect. Cd accumulated approximately 71.9% and 127% in the roots of mir535 and OE535 plants, respectively, compared to WT, after exposure to 2 Âµmol/L Cd. In brown rice, the total Cd accumulation of OE535 and mir535 was about 78% greater and 35% lower than WT. When growing in 2 mg/kg Cd of soil, the Cd concentration was significantly lower in mir535 and higher in OE535 than in the WT; afterward, we further revealed the most possible target gene SQUAMOSA promoter binding-like transcription factor 7(SPL7) and it negatively regulates Nramp5 expression, which in turn regulates Cd metabolism. Therefore, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology may be a valuable strategy for creating new rice varieties to ensure food safety.
