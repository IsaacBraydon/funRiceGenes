SPL11	Spl7	Regulatory mechanisms of ROI generation are affected by rice spl mutations	We found that spl2, spl7 and spl11 mutant cells accumulated increased amounts of H(2)O(2) in response to rice blast fungal elicitor
SPL11	Spl7	Regulatory mechanisms of ROI generation are affected by rice spl mutations	These results suggest that the spl2, spl7 and spl11 mutants are defective in the regulation of NADPH oxidase, and the spl7 mutation may give rise to enhancement of the signaling pathway which protein dephosphorylation controls, while the spl2 mutation affects both the pathogen-induced and wound-induced signaling pathways
