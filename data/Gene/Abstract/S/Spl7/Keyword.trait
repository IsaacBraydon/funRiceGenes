Spl7	leaf	A rice spotted leaf gene, Spl7, encodes a heat stress transcription factor protein	A rice spotted leaf (lesion-mimic) gene, Spl7, was identified by map-based cloning
Spl7	leaf	A rice spotted leaf gene, Spl7, encodes a heat stress transcription factor protein	Transgenic analysis verified the function of the candidate gene for Spl7: leaf spot development was suppressed in spl7 mutants with a wild-type Spl7 transgene
Spl7	leaf	A rice spotted leaf gene, Spl7, encodes a heat stress transcription factor protein	A rice spotted leaf gene, Spl7, encodes a heat stress transcription factor protein
Spl7	transcription factor	A rice spotted leaf gene, Spl7, encodes a heat stress transcription factor protein	A rice spotted leaf gene, Spl7, encodes a heat stress transcription factor protein
Spl7	blast	Regulatory mechanisms of ROI generation are affected by rice spl mutations	We found that spl2, spl7 and spl11 mutant cells accumulated increased amounts of H(2)O(2) in response to rice blast fungal elicitor
