SDS2	cell death	The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.	The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.
SDS2	immunity	The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.	The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.
SDS2	immunity	The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.	 In addition, SDS2 interacts with related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases, OsRLCK118/176, that positively regulate immunity by phosphorylating the NADPH oxidase OsRbohB to stimulate ROS production
