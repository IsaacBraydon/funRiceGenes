OsrbohB|Osrboh7	SDS2	The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.	 In addition, SDS2 interacts with related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases, OsRLCK118/176, that positively regulate immunity by phosphorylating the NADPH oxidase OsRbohB to stimulate ROS production
SDS2	SPL11	The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.	 We show that SPL11 cell-death suppressor 2 (SDS2), an S-domain receptor-like kinase, positively regulates PCD and immunity in rice by engaging and regulating SPL11 and related kinases controlling defense responses
SDS2	SPL11	The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.	 SDS2 interacts with and phosphorylates SPL11, which in turn ubiquitinates SDS2, leading to its degradation
SDS2	SPL11	The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.	 Thus, a plasma membrane-resident protein complex consisting of SDS2, SPL11, and OsRLCK118/176 controls PCD and immunity in rice
