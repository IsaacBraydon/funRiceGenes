SOR1	root	Isolation of a novel mutant gene for soil-surface rooting in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Segregation analyses by using an F2 population derived from a cross between the soil-surface rooting mutant and wild-type Nipponbare indicated that the trait was controlled by a single recessive gene, designated as sor1
SOR1	root	Isolation of a novel mutant gene for soil-surface rooting in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 CONCLUSION: These results suggest that sor1, a rice mutant causing soil-surface rooting and altered root gravitropic response, is allelic to Os04g0101800, and that a 33-bp deletion in the coding region of this gene causes the mutant phenotypes
