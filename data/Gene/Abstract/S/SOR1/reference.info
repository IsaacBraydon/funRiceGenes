BACKGROUND: Root system architecture is an important trait affecting the uptake of nutrients and water by crops. Shallower root systems preferentially take up nutrients from the topsoil and help avoid unfavorable environments in deeper soil layers. We have found a soil-surface rooting mutant from an M2 population that was regenerated from seed calli of a japonica rice cultivar, Nipponbare. In this study, we examined the genetic and physiological characteristics of this mutant. RESULTS: The primary roots of the mutant showed no gravitropic response from the seedling stage on, whereas the gravitropic response of the shoots was normal. Segregation analyses by using an F2 population derived from a cross between the soil-surface rooting mutant and wild-type Nipponbare indicated that the trait was controlled by a single recessive gene, designated as sor1. Fine mapping by using an F2 population derived from a cross between the mutant and an indica rice cultivar, Kasalath, revealed that sor1 was located within a 136-kb region between the simple sequence repeat markers RM16254 and 2935-6 on the terminal region of the short arm of chromosome 4, where 13 putative open reading frames (ORFs) were found. We sequenced these ORFs and detected a 33-bp deletion in one of them, Os04g0101800. Transgenic plants of the mutant transformed with the genomic fragment carrying the Os04g0101800 sequence from Nipponbare showed normal gravitropic responses and no soil-surface rooting. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that sor1, a rice mutant causing soil-surface rooting and altered root gravitropic response, is allelic to Os04g0101800, and that a 33-bp deletion in the coding region of this gene causes the mutant phenotypes.
NA	E3 ubiquitin ligase SOR1 regulates ethylene response in rice root by modulating stability of Aux/IAA protein.	2018	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100101 Beijing, China.	Plant hormones ethylene and auxin synergistically regulate plant root growth and development. Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors by the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFTIR1/AFB triggers a transcription-based auxin signaling. Here we show that rice (Oryza sativa L.) soil-surface rooting 1 (SOR1), which is a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase identified from analysis of a rice ethylene-insensitive mutant mhz2/sor1-2, controls root-specific ethylene responses by modulating Aux/IAA protein stability. SOR1 physically interacts with OsIAA26 and OsIAA9, which are atypical and canonical Aux/IAA proteins, respectively. SOR1 targets OsIAA26 for ubiquitin/26S proteasome-mediated degradation, whereas OsIAA9 protects the OsIAA26 protein from degradation by inhibiting the E3 activity of SOR1. Auxin promotes SOR1-dependent degradation of OsIAA26 by facilitating SCFOsTIR1/AFB2-mediated and SOR1-assisted destabilization of OsIAA9 protein. Our study provides a candidate mechanism by which the SOR1-OsIAA26 module acts downstream of the OsTIR1/AFB2-auxin-OsIAA9 signaling to modulate ethylene inhibition of root growth in rice seedlings.
