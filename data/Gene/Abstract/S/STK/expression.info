STK	 Previous reports have demonstrated that overexpression of an RLCK gene SALT TOLERANCE KINASE (STK) enhances salt tolerance in rice, and that STK may regulate the expression of GST (Glutathione S-transferase) genes |  RESULTS: The expression of STK was rapidly induced by ABA |  Overexpression of STK in rice increased tolerance to salt stress and oxidative stress by increasing ROS scavenging ability and ABA sensitivity |  Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that STK increased the expression of GST genes (LOC_Os03g17480, LOC_Os10g38140 and LOC_Os10g38710) under salt stress	 Previous reports have demonstrated that overexpression of an RLCK gene SALT TOLERANCE KINASE (STK) enhances salt tolerance in rice, and that STK may regulate the expression of GST (Glutathione S-transferase) genes |  Overexpression of STK in rice increased tolerance to salt stress and oxidative stress by increasing ROS scavenging ability and ABA sensitivity
