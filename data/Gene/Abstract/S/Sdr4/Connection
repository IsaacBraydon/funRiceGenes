OSVP1|VP1	Sdr4	Molecular cloning of Sdr4, a regulator involved in seed dormancy and domestication of rice	Sdr4 expression is positively regulated by OsVP1, a global regulator of seed maturation, and in turn positively regulates potential regulators of seed dormancy and represses the expression of postgerminative genes, suggesting that Sdr4 acts as an intermediate regulator of dormancy in the seed maturation program
