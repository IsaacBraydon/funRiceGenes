Seed dormancy provides a strategy for flowering plants to survive adverse natural conditions. It is also an important agronomic trait affecting grain yield, quality, and processing performance. We cloned a rice quantitative trait locus, Sdr4, which contributes substantially to differences in seed dormancy between japonica (Nipponbare) and indica (Kasalath) cultivars. Sdr4 expression is positively regulated by OsVP1, a global regulator of seed maturation, and in turn positively regulates potential regulators of seed dormancy and represses the expression of postgerminative genes, suggesting that Sdr4 acts as an intermediate regulator of dormancy in the seed maturation program. Japonica cultivars have only the Nipponbare allele (Sdr4-n), which endows reduced dormancy, whereas both the Kasalath allele (Srd4-k) and Sdr4-n are widely distributed in the indica group, indicating prevalent introgression. Srd4-k also is found in the wild ancestor Oryza rufipogon, whereas Sdr4-n appears to have been produced through at least two mutation events from the closest O. rufipogon allele among the accessions examined. These results are discussed with respect to possible selection of the allele during the domestication process.
NA	Sdr4 dominates pre-harvest sprouting and facilitates adaptation to local climatic condition in Asia cultivated rice.	2022	J Integr Plant Biol	Shenzhen Branch, Guangdong Laboratory for Lingnan Modern Agriculture, Genome Analysis Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture, Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, 518120, China.	Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS), which reduces grain yield and quality, is controlled by seed dormancy genes. Because few dormancy-related genes have been cloned, the genetic basis of seed dormancy in rice (Oryza sativa L.) remains unclear. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study and linkage mapping to dissect the genetic basis of seed dormancy in rice. Our findings suggest that Seed Dormancy4 (Sdr4), a central modulator of seed dormancy, integrates the abscisic acid and gibberellic acid signaling pathways at the transcriptional level. Haplotype analysis revealed that three Sdr4 alleles in rice cultivars already existed in ancestral Oryza rufipogon accessions. Furthermore, like the semi-dwarf 1 (SD1) and Rc loci, Sdr4 underwent selection during the domestication and improvement of Asian cultivated rice. The distribution frequency of the Sdr4-n allele in different locations in Asia is negatively associated with local annual temperature and precipitation. Finally, we developed functional molecular markers for Sdr4, SD1, and Rc for use in molecular breeding. Our results provide clues about the molecular basis of Sdr4-regulated seed dormancy. Moreover, these findings provide guidance for utilizing the favorable alleles of Sdr4 and Rc to synergistically boost PHS resistance, yield, and quality in modern rice varieties.
