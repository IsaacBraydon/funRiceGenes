Sdr4	dormancy	Molecular cloning of Sdr4, a regulator involved in seed dormancy and domestication of rice	We cloned a rice quantitative trait locus, Sdr4, which contributes substantially to differences in seed dormancy between japonica (Nipponbare) and indica (Kasalath) cultivars
Sdr4	dormancy	Molecular cloning of Sdr4, a regulator involved in seed dormancy and domestication of rice	Sdr4 expression is positively regulated by OsVP1, a global regulator of seed maturation, and in turn positively regulates potential regulators of seed dormancy and represses the expression of postgerminative genes, suggesting that Sdr4 acts as an intermediate regulator of dormancy in the seed maturation program
Sdr4	dormancy	Molecular cloning of Sdr4, a regulator involved in seed dormancy and domestication of rice	Japonica cultivars have only the Nipponbare allele (Sdr4-n), which endows reduced dormancy, whereas both the Kasalath allele (Srd4-k) and Sdr4-n are widely distributed in the indica group, indicating prevalent introgression
