Histone lysine methylation is known to be involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in all eukaryotes including plants. Here we show that the rice SDG714 is primarily responsible for dimethylation but not trimethylation on histone H3K9 in vivo. Overexpression of YFP-SDG714 in Arabidopsis significantly inhibits plant growth and this inhibition is associated with an enhanced level of H3K9 dimethylation. Our microarray results show that many genes essential for the plant growth and development were downregulated in transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing YFP-SDG714. By chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we show that YFP-SDG714 is targeted to specific chromatin regions and dimethylate the H3K9, which is linked with heterochromatinization and the downregulation of genes. Most interestingly, when YFP-SDG714 production is stopped, the inhibited plants can partially restore their growth, suggesting that the perturbation of gene expression caused by YFP-SDG714 is revertible. Taken together, our results point to an important role of SDG714 in H3K9 dimethylation, suppression of gene expression and plant growth, and provide a potential method to regulate gene expression and plant development by an on-off switch of SDG714 expression.
Mol. Plant-2010-Qin-773-82.pdf	Rice SUVH histone methyltransferase genes display specific functions in chromatin modification and retrotransposon repression	2010	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, 430070 Wuhan, China.	Histone lysine methylation plays an important role in heterochromatin formation and reprogramming of gene expression. SET-domain-containing proteins are shown to have histone lysine methyltransferase activities. A large number of SET-domain genes are identified in plant genomes. The function of most SET-domain genes is not known. In this work, we studied the 12 rice (Oryza sativa) homologs of Su(var)3-9, the histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase identified in Drosophila. Several rice SUVHs (i.e. SDG714, SDG727, and SDG710) were found to have an antagonistic function to the histone H3K9 demethylase JMJ706, as down-regulation of these genes could partially complement the jmj706 phenotype and reduced histone H3K9 methylation. Down-regulation of a rice Su(var)3-9 homolog (SUVH), namely SDG728, decreased H3K9 methylation and altered seed morphology. Overexpression of the gene increased H3K9 methylation. SDG728 and other SUVH genes were found to be involved in the repression of retrotransposons such as Tos17 and a Ty1-copia element. Analysis of histone methylation suggested that SDG728-mediated H3K9 methylation may play an important role in retrotransposon repression.
Plant Cell-2007-Ding-9-22.pdf	SDG714, a histone H3K9 methyltransferase, is involved in Tos17 DNA methylation and transposition in rice	2007	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Although the role of H3K9 methylation in rice (Oryza sativa) is unclear, in Arabidopsis thaliana the loss of histone H3K9 methylation by mutation of Kryptonite [also known as SU(VAR)3-9 homolog] reduces genome-wide DNA methylation and increases the transcription of transposable elements. Here, we report that rice SDG714 (for SET Domain Group Protein714) encodes a histone H3K9-specific methyltransferase. The C terminus of SDG714 confers enzymatic activity and substrate specificity, whereas the N terminus localizes it in the nucleus. Loss-of-function mutants of SDG714 (SDG714IR transformants) generated by RNA interference display a mostly glabrous phenotype as a result of the lack of macro trichomes in glumes, leaves, and culms compared with control plants. These mutants also show decreased levels of CpG and CNG cytosine methylation as well as H3K9 methylation at the Tos17 locus, a copia-like retrotransposon widely used for the generation of rice mutants. Most interestingly, loss of function of SDG714 can enhance transcription and cause the transposition of Tos17. Together, these results suggest that histone H3K9 methylation mediated by SDG714 is involved in DNA methylation, the transposition of transposable elements, and genome stability in rice.
