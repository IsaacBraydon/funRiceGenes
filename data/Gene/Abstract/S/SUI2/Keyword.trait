SUI2|ES5	vegetative	SUI-family genes encode phosphatidylserine synthases and regulate stem development in rice	Overexpression of SUI1 and SUI2 caused outgrowths of internodes during vegetative development, and we showed that expression patterns of Oryza Sativa Homeobox 15 (OSH15) and Histone4 were impaired

SUI2|ES5	leaf	ES5 is involved in the regulation of phosphatidylserine synthesis and impacts on early senescence in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 We have characterized an early senile mutant es5 (early leaf senescence 5) in rice exhibiting leaf yellowing phenotype after the 4-leaf stage
