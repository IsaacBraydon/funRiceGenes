In vascular plants, the regulation of stem cell niche determines development of aerial shoot which consists of stems and lateral organs. Intercalary meristem (IM) controls internode elongation in rice and other grasses, however little attention has been paid to the underlying mechanism of stem cell maintenance. Here, we investigated the stem development in rice and showed that the Shortened Uppermost Internode 1 (SUI1) family of genes are pivotal for development of rice stems. We demonstrated that SUI-family genes regulate the development of IM for internode elongation and also the cell expansion of the panicle stem rachis in rice. The SUI-family genes encoded base-exchange types of phosphatidylserine synthases (PSSs), which possessed enzymatic activity in a yeast complementary assay. Overexpression of SUI1 and SUI2 caused outgrowths of internodes during vegetative development, and we showed that expression patterns of Oryza Sativa Homeobox 15 (OSH15) and Histone4 were impaired. Furthermore, genome-wide gene expression analysis revealed that overexpression and RNA knockdown of SUI-family genes affected downstream gene expression related to phospholipid metabolic pathways. Moreover, using Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometry, we analyzed PS contents in different genetic backgrounds of rice and showed that the quantity of very long chain fatty acids PS is affected by transgene of SUI-family genes. Our study reveals a new mechanism conveyed by the SUI1 pathway and provides evidence to link lipid metabolism with plant stem cell maintenance.
NA	ES5 is involved in the regulation of phosphatidylserine synthesis and impacts on early senescence in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2020	Plant Mol Biol	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, Zhejiang, China.	Leaf senescence, which affects plant growth and yield in rice, is an ideal target for crop improvement and remarkable advances have been made to identify the mechanism underlying this process. We have characterized an early senile mutant es5 (early leaf senescence 5) in rice exhibiting leaf yellowing phenotype after the 4-leaf stage. This phenotype was confirmed by the higher accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), the disintegration of chloroplasts, reduction in chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate and up-regulation of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) like Osh36, OsI57, and OsI85. Positional cloning revealed that the es5 phenotype is the result of one base substitution in ES5, encoding phosphatidylserine synthase (PSS) family protein, which is involved in the base-exchange type reaction to synthesize the minor membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine. Functional complementation of ES5 in the es5 plants completely restored the wild-type phenotype. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) analysis showed that es5 plants had increased levels of phosphatidylserine (PS) and decreased level of phosphatidylcholine (PC). These results provide evidence about the role of PS in rice leaf senescence.
