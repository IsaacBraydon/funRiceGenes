SG1	 BR 	Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice	 However, the endogenous BR level in the SG1 overexpressor (SG1:OX) plants was comparable to the wild type
SG1	brassinosteroid	Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice	 Overexpression of SG1 in rice produced a phenotype with short grains and dwarfing reminiscent of brassinosteroid (BR)-deficient mutants, with wide, dark-green, and erect leaves
SG1	seed	Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice	 Taken together, these results suggest that SG1 decreases responses to BRs and elongation of organs such as seeds and the internodes of rachis branches through decreased cellular proliferation
SG1	dwarf	Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice	 Overexpression of SG1 in rice produced a phenotype with short grains and dwarfing reminiscent of brassinosteroid (BR)-deficient mutants, with wide, dark-green, and erect leaves
SG1	panicle	Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice	 The causative gene, SG1, encodes a protein with unknown function that is preferentially expressed in roots and developing panicles
SG1	lamina	Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice	 SG1:OX plants were insensitive to brassinolide in the lamina inclination assay
SG1	root	Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice	 The causative gene, SG1, encodes a protein with unknown function that is preferentially expressed in roots and developing panicles
SG1	erect	Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice	 Overexpression of SG1 in rice produced a phenotype with short grains and dwarfing reminiscent of brassinosteroid (BR)-deficient mutants, with wide, dark-green, and erect leaves
SG1	cellular proliferation	Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice	 Taken together, these results suggest that SG1 decreases responses to BRs and elongation of organs such as seeds and the internodes of rachis branches through decreased cellular proliferation
SG1	grain	Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice	We identified a short-grain mutant (Short grain1 (Sg1) Dominant) via phenotypic screening of 13,000 rice (Oryza sativa) activation-tagged lines
SG1	grain	Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice	 Overexpression of SG1 in rice produced a phenotype with short grains and dwarfing reminiscent of brassinosteroid (BR)-deficient mutants, with wide, dark-green, and erect leaves
SG1	grain	Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice	 In contrast to the SG1:OX plants, RNA interference knockdown plants that down-regulated SG1 and a related gene, SG1-LIKE PROTEIN1, had longer grains and internodes in rachis branches than in the wild type
