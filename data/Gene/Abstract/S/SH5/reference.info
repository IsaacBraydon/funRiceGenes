NA	The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis	2014	Plant J	Crop Biotech Institute, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, 446-701, Korea; Department of Life Science, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, 790-784, Korea.	Seed shattering is an important trait that influences grain yield. A major controlling quantitative trait locus in rice is qSH1. Although the degree of shattering is correlated with the level of expression of qSH1, some qSH1-defective cultivars display moderate shattering while others show a non-shattering phenotype. Os05 g38120 (SH5) on chromosome 5 is highly homologous to qSH1. Although we detected SH5 transcripts in various organs, this gene was highly expressed at the abscission zone (AZ) in the pedicels. When expression of this gene was suppressed in easy-shattering 'Kasalath', development of the AZ was reduced and thereby so was seed loss. By contrast, the extent of shattering, as well as AZ development, was greatly enhanced in moderate-shattering 'Dongjin' rice when SH5 was overexpressed. Likewise, overexpression of SH5 in the non-shattering 'Ilpum' led to an increase in seed shattering because lignin levels were decreased in the basal region of spikelets in the absence of development of an AZ. We also determined that two shattering-related genes, SHAT1 and Sh4, which are necessary for proper formation of an AZ, were induced by SH5. Based on these observations, we propose that SH5 modulates seed shattering by enhancing AZ development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis.
NA	BELL1-like homeobox genes regulate inflorescence architecture and meristem maintenance in rice.	2019	Plant J	Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan.	Inflorescence architecture is diverse in angiosperms and is mainly determined by the arrangement of the branches and flowers, known as phyllotaxy. In rice (Oryza sativa), the main inflorescence axis, called the rachis, generates primary branches in a spiral phyllotaxy, and flowers (spikelets) are formed on these branches. Here, we have studied a classical mutant, named verticillate rachis (ri), which produces branches in a partially whorled phyllotaxy. Gene isolation revealed that RI encodes a BELL1-type homeodomain transcription factor, similar to Arabidopsis PENNYWISE/ BELLRINGER/REPLUMLESS, and is expressed in the specific regions within the inflorescence and branch meristems where their descendant meristems would soon initiate. Genetic combination of an ri homozygote and a mutant allele of RI-LIKE1 (RIL1) (designated ri ril1/+ plant), a close paralog of RI, enhanced the ri inflorescence phenotype, including the abnormalities in branch phyllotaxy and rachis internode patterning. During early inflorescence development, the timing and arrangement of primary branch meristem (pBM) initiation was disturbed in both ri and ri ril1/+ plants. These findings suggest that RI and RIL1 involved in regulating the phyllotactic pattern of the pBMs to form normal inflorescences. In addition, both RI and RIL1 seem to be involved in meristem maintenance, because the ri ril1 double mutant failed to establish or maintain the shoot apical meristem during embryogenesis.
