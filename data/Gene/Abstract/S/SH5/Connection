qSH1|RIL1	SH5|RI	The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis	Os05 g38120 (SH5) on chromosome 5 is highly homologous to qSH1
SH5|RI	SHAT1	The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis	We also determined that two shattering-related genes, SHAT1 and Sh4, which are necessary for proper formation of an AZ, were induced by SH5.
sh4|SHA1	SH5|RI	The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis	We also determined that two shattering-related genes, SHAT1 and Sh4, which are necessary for proper formation of an AZ, were induced by SH5.
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	SH5|RI	KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes.	 Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that OSH15 interacts with SH5 and qSH1, two proteins in the BELL homeobox family
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	SH5|RI	KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes.	 Analyses of osh15 SH5-D double mutants showed that SH5 could not increase the degree of seed shattering when OSH15 was absent, indicating that SH5 functions together with OSH15
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	SH5|RI	KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that both OSH15 and SH5 directly interact with CAD2 chromatin
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	SH5|RI	KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes.	 We conclude that OSH15 and SH5 form a dimer that enhances seed shattering by directly inhibiting lignin biosynthesis genes
OsAAP5	SH5|RI	The amino acid permease OsAAP5 regulates tiller number and grain yield in rice.	 Downregulation of OsAAP5 expression in japonica using RNA interference (Ri) and CRISPR led to increases in tiller number and grain yield, while OsAAP5 overexpression (OE) had the opposite effect
