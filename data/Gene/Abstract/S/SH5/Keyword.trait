SH5|RI	transcription factor	BELL1-like homeobox genes regulate inflorescence architecture and meristem maintenance in rice.	 Gene isolation revealed that RI encodes a BELL1-type homeodomain transcription factor, similar to Arabidopsis PENNYWISE/ BELLRINGER/REPLUMLESS, and is expressed in the specific regions within the inflorescence and branch meristems where their descendant meristems would soon initiate
SH5|RI	shoot	BELL1-like homeobox genes regulate inflorescence architecture and meristem maintenance in rice.	 In addition, both RI and RIL1 seem to be involved in meristem maintenance, because the ri ril1 double mutant failed to establish or maintain the shoot apical meristem during embryogenesis
SH5|RI	meristem	BELL1-like homeobox genes regulate inflorescence architecture and meristem maintenance in rice.	 During early inflorescence development, the timing and arrangement of primary branch meristem (pBM) initiation was disturbed in both ri and ri ril1/+ plants
SH5|RI	meristem	BELL1-like homeobox genes regulate inflorescence architecture and meristem maintenance in rice.	 In addition, both RI and RIL1 seem to be involved in meristem maintenance, because the ri ril1 double mutant failed to establish or maintain the shoot apical meristem during embryogenesis
SH5|RI	inflorescence	BELL1-like homeobox genes regulate inflorescence architecture and meristem maintenance in rice.	 Gene isolation revealed that RI encodes a BELL1-type homeodomain transcription factor, similar to Arabidopsis PENNYWISE/ BELLRINGER/REPLUMLESS, and is expressed in the specific regions within the inflorescence and branch meristems where their descendant meristems would soon initiate
SH5|RI	inflorescence	BELL1-like homeobox genes regulate inflorescence architecture and meristem maintenance in rice.	 Genetic combination of an ri homozygote and a mutant allele of RI-LIKE1 (RIL1) (designated ri ril1/+ plant), a close paralog of RI, enhanced the ri inflorescence phenotype, including the abnormalities in branch phyllotaxy and rachis internode patterning

SH5|RI	shoot apical meristem	BELL1-like homeobox genes regulate inflorescence architecture and meristem maintenance in rice.	 In addition, both RI and RIL1 seem to be involved in meristem maintenance, because the ri ril1 double mutant failed to establish or maintain the shoot apical meristem during embryogenesis
