ST2	mitochondria	STRIPE2 encodes a putative dCMP deaminase that plays an important role in chloroplast development in rice.	 Subcellular localization assay showed that the ST2 protein was located in mitochondria
ST2	map-based cloning	STRIPE2 encodes a putative dCMP deaminase that plays an important role in chloroplast development in rice.	 The ST2 gene was finely confined to a 27-kb region on chromosome 1 by the map-based cloning strategy and a 5-bp deletion in Os01g0765000 was identified by sequence analysis
