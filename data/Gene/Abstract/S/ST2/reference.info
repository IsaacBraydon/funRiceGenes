Mutants with abnormal leaf coloration are good genetic materials for understanding the mechanism of chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis. In this study, a rice mutant st2 (stripe2) with stripe leaves was identified from the ¦Ã-ray irradiated mutant pool. The st2 mutant exhibited decreased accumulation of chlorophyll and aberrant chloroplasts. Genetic analysis indicated that the st2 mutant was controlled by a single recessive locus. The ST2 gene was finely confined to a 27-kb region on chromosome 1 by the map-based cloning strategy and a 5-bp deletion in Os01g0765000 was identified by sequence analysis. The deletion happened in the joint of exon 3 and intron 3 and led to new spliced products of mRNA. Genetic complementation confirmed that Os01g0765000 is the ST2 gene. We found that the ST2 gene was expressed ubiquitously. Subcellular localization assay showed that the ST2 protein was located in mitochondria. ST2 belongs to the cytidine deaminase-like family and possibly functions as the dCMP deaminase, which catalyzes the formation of dUMP from dCMP by deamination. Additionally, exogenous application of dUMP could partially rescue the st2 phenotype. Therefore, our study identified a putative dCMP deaminase as a novel regulator in chloroplast development for the first time.
NA	ALR encoding dCMP deaminase is critical for DNA damage repair, cell cycle progression and plant development in rice.	2017	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, China.	Deoxycytidine monophosphate deaminase (dCMP deaminase, DCD) is crucial to the production of dTTP needed for DNA replication and damage repair. However, the effect of DCD deficiency and its molecular mechanism are poorly understood in plants. Here, we isolated and characterized a rice albinic leaf and growth retardation (alr) mutant that is manifested by albinic leaves, dwarf stature and necrotic lesions. Map-based cloning and complementation revealed that ALR encodes a DCD protein. OsDCD was expressed ubiquitously in all tissues. Enzyme activity assays showed that OsDCD catalyses conversion of dCMP to dUMP, and the Î”DCD protein in the alr mutant is a loss-of-function protein that lacks binding ability. We report that alr plants have typical DCD-mediated imbalanced dNTP pools with decreased dTTP; exogenous dTTP recovers the wild-type phenotype. A comet assay and Trypan Blue staining showed that OsDCD deficiency causes accumulation of DNA damage in the alr mutant, sometimes leading to cell apoptosis. Moreover, OsDCD deficiency triggered cell cycle checkpoints and arrested cell progression at the G1/S-phase. The expression of nuclear and plastid genome replication genes was down-regulated under decreased dTTP, and together with decreased cell proliferation and defective chloroplast development in the alr mutant this demonstrated the molecular and physiological roles of DCD-mediated dNTP pool balance in plant development.
