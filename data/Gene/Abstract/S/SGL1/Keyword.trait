SGL1	plant height	Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice.	In comparison with the wild-type plants, the SGL1:OX plants showed a 45% decrease in plant height due to a uniform decrease of culm internode elongation
SGL1	grain length	Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice.	Lengths of seeds, panicles, and internodes in the rachis branches were 17%, 39%, and 31% shorter than those of the wild-type plants, respectively, and all differences were statistically significant
