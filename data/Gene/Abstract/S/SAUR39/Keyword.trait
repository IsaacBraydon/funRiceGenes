SAUR39	cytokinin	SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice	 The expression of the rice (Oryza sativa) SAUR39 gene showed rapid induction by transient change in different environmental factors, including auxin, nitrogen, salinity, cytokinin, and anoxia
SAUR39	yield	SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice	 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the SAUR39 gene resulted in lower shoot and root growth, altered shoot morphology, smaller vascular tissue, and lower yield compared with wild-type plants
SAUR39	salinity	"SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice"	" The expression of the rice (Oryza sativa) SAUR39 gene showed rapid induction by transient change in different environmental factors, including auxin, nitrogen, salinity, cytokinin, and anoxia"
SAUR39	growth	SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice	 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the SAUR39 gene resulted in lower shoot and root growth, altered shoot morphology, smaller vascular tissue, and lower yield compared with wild-type plants
SAUR39	auxin	SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice	 The expression of the rice (Oryza sativa) SAUR39 gene showed rapid induction by transient change in different environmental factors, including auxin, nitrogen, salinity, cytokinin, and anoxia| The SAUR39 gene was expressed at higher levels in older leaves, unlike auxin biosynthesis, which occurs largely in the meristematic region| Taken together, the results suggest that SAUR39 acts as a negative regulator for auxin synthesis and transport|SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice
SAUR39	nitrogen	SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice	 The expression of the rice (Oryza sativa) SAUR39 gene showed rapid induction by transient change in different environmental factors, including auxin, nitrogen, salinity, cytokinin, and anoxia
SAUR39	root	SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice	 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the SAUR39 gene resulted in lower shoot and root growth, altered shoot morphology, smaller vascular tissue, and lower yield compared with wild-type plants
SAUR39	shoot	SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice	 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the SAUR39 gene resulted in lower shoot and root growth, altered shoot morphology, smaller vascular tissue, and lower yield compared with wild-type plants
SAUR39	meristem	SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice	 The SAUR39 gene was expressed at higher levels in older leaves, unlike auxin biosynthesis, which occurs largely in the meristematic region
