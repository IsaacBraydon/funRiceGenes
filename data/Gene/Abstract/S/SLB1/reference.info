Rice (Oryza sativa) cultivar Azucena--belonging to the Japonica subspecies--exudes high strigolactone (SL) levels and induces high germination of the root parasitic plant Striga hermonthica. Consistent with the fact that SLs also inhibit shoot branching, Azucena is a low-tillering variety. In contrast, Bala, an Indica cultivar, is a low-SL producer, stimulates less Striga germination, and is highly tillered. Using a Bala x Azucena F6 population, a major quantitative trait loci--qSLB1.1--for the exudation of SL, tillering, and induction of Striga germination was detected on chromosome 1. Sequence analysis of the corresponding locus revealed a rearrangement of a 51- to 59-kbp stretch between 28.9 and 29 Mbp in the Bala genome, resulting in the deletion of two cytochrome P450 genes--SLB1 and SLB2--with high homology to the Arabidopsis SL biosynthesis gene, MAX1. Both rice genes rescue the Arabidopsis max1-1 highly branched mutant phenotype and increase the production of the SL, ent-2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol, when overexpressed in Bala. Furthermore, analysis of this region in 367 cultivars of the publicly available Rice Diversity Panel population shows that the rearrangement at this locus is a recurrent natural trait associated with the Indica/Japonica divide in rice.
NA	Rice cytochrome P450 MAX1 homologs catalyze distinct steps in strigolactone biosynthesis	2014	Nat Chem Biol	Laboratory of Plant Physiology, Wageningen University, Wageningen, the Netherlands.	Strigolactones (SLs) are a class of phytohormones and rhizosphere signaling compounds with high structural diversity. Three enzymes, carotenoid isomerase DWARF27 and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases CCD7 and CCD8, were previously shown to convert all-trans-¦Â-carotene to carlactone (CL), the SL precursor. However, how CL is metabolized to SLs has remained elusive. Here, by reconstituting the SL biosynthetic pathway in Nicotiana benthamiana, we show that a rice homolog of Arabidopsis MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 1 (MAX1), encodes a cytochrome P450 CYP711 subfamily member that acts as a CL oxidase to stereoselectively convert CL into ent-2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol (B-C lactone ring formation), the presumed precursor of rice SLs. A protein encoded by a second rice MAX1 homolog then catalyzes the conversion of ent-2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol to orobanchol. We therefore report that two members of CYP711 enzymes can catalyze two distinct steps in SL biosynthesis, identifying the first enzymes involved in B-C ring closure and a subsequent structural diversification step of SLs.
NA	Disruption of the cytochrome CYP711A5 gene reveals MAX1 redundancy in rice strigolactone biosynthesis.	2023	J Plant Physiol	The BioActives Lab, Center for Desert Agriculture, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia.	Strigolactones (SLs) inhibit shoot branching/tillering and are secreted by plant roots as a signal to attract symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi in the rhizosphere, particularly under phosphate starvation. However, SLs are also hijacked by root parasitic weeds as inducer for the germination of their seeds. There are around 35 natural SLs divided, based on their structures, into canonical and non-canonical SLs. Cytochrome P450 enzymes of the 711 clade, such as MORE AXILLARY GROWTH1 (MAX1) in Arabidopsis, are a major driver of SL structural diversity. Monocots, such as rice, contain several MAX1 homologs that participate in SL biosynthesis. To investigate the function of OsMAX1-1900 in planta, we generated CRISPR/Cas9 mutants disrupted in the corresponding gene. Characterizing of the generated mutants at metabolite and phenotype level suggests that OsMAX1-1900 loss-of-function does neither affect the SL pattern nor rice architecture, indicating functional redundancy among rice MAX1 homologs.
