NA	Loss of Rice PARAQUAT TOLERANCE 3 Confers Enhanced Resistance to Abiotic Stresses and Increases Grain Yield in Field	2020	Plant Cell Environ	School of Life Sciences and Division of Molecular & Cell Biophysics, Hefei National Science Center for Physical Sciences at the Microscale, University of Science and Technology of China, The Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui Province, China.	Plants frequently suffer from environmental stresses in nature and have evolved sophisticated and efficient mechanisms to cope with the stresses. To balance between growth and stress response, plants are equipped with efficient means to switch off the activated stress responses when stresses diminish. We previously revealed such an off-switch mechanism conferred by Arabidopsis PARAQUAT TOLERANCE 3 (AtPQT3) encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase, knockout of which significantly enhances resistance to abiotic stresses. To explore whether the rice homolog OsPQT3 is functionally conserved, we generated three knockout mutants with CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The OsPQT3 knockout mutants (ospqt3) display enhanced resistance to oxidative and salt stress with elevated expression of OsGPX1, OsAPX1, and OsSOD1. More importantly, the ospqt3 mutants show significantly enhanced agronomic performance with higher yield compared with the wild type under salt stress in greenhouse as well as in field conditions. We further showed that OsPQT3 expression rapidly decreased in response to oxidative and other abiotic stresses as AtPQT3 does. Taken together, these results show that OsPQT3 is functionally well conserved in rice as an off-switch in stress response as AtPQT3 in Arabidopsis. Therefore, PQT3 locus provides a promising candidate for crop improvement with enhanced stress resistance by gene editing technology.
NA	The copper economy response is partially conserved in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2021	Plant Physiol Biochem	Programa de PÃ³s-Gradua<U+00E7><U+00E3>o em Agrobiologia, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Santa Maria, Brazil.	Copper (Cu) is an essential element for plants, especially in photosynthesis, as it is required for plastocyanin function in electron transfer reactions at thylakoid membranes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, Cu deficiency leads to the Cu economy response, in which plants prioritize Cu usage by plastocyanin in detriment of non-essential cupric proteins. In rice (Oryza sativa), however, this response has not been characterized. Rice OsHMA5 is a Cu xylem-loading transporter involved in Cu translocation from roots to shoots, as suggested by the analysis of oshma5 mutant plants. Aiming to understand how rice plants respond to Cu deficiency and how decreased Cu translocation to shoots can affect this response, we characterized the physiological and molecular responses of WT and oshma5 plants under control and Cu deficiency treatments. We found evidence that shoots of oshma5 plants are more prone to Cu deficiency compared to shoots of WT plants, as demonstrated by decreased chlorophyll and Cu concentrations, and electron transport rate. Gene expression analysis revealed that Cu high-affinity transporters OsCOPT1 and OsCOPT5, along with a set of miRNAs and three Cu/Zn superoxide dismutases are responsive to Cu deficiency in both WT and oshma5 plants, suggesting their involvement in the Cu economy response. However, Fe superoxide dismutase was not up-regulated in rice, indicating a difference compared to the A. thaliana Cu economy model. Therefore, we provide evidence for a partially conserved Cu economy response in rice, in comparison to A. thaliana.
