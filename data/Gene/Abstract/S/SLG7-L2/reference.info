NA	Natural Variations in SLG7 Regulate Grain Shape in Rice.	2015	Genetics	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology/Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics of the Ministry of Education, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, China.	Rice (Oryza sativa) grain shape, which is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTL), has a strong effect on yield production and quality. However, the molecular basis for grain development remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified a novel QTL, Slender grain on chromosome 7 (SLG7), that is responsible for grain shape, using backcross introgression lines derived from 9311 and Azucena. The SLG7 allele from Azucena produces longer and thinner grains, although it has no influence on grain weight and yield production. SLG7 encodes a protein homologous to LONGIFOLIA 1 and LONGIFOLIA 2, both of which increase organ length in Arabidopsis. SLG7 is constitutively expressed in various tissues in rice, and the SLG7 protein is located in plasma membrane. Morphological and cellular analyses suggested that SLG7 produces slender grains by longitudinally increasing cell length, while transversely decreasing cell width, which is independent from cell division. Our findings show that the functions of SLG7 family members are conserved across monocots and dicots and that the SLG7 allele could be applied in breeding to modify rice grain appearance.
