SEM1	map-based cloning	Plasma membrane-localized SEM1 protein mediates sugar movement to sink rice tissues.	 Map-based cloning identified two allelic mutations in a gene encoding a GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE (GSL) protein, thus indicating a role for SEM1 in callose biosynthesis
SEM1	phloem	Plasma membrane-localized SEM1 protein mediates sugar movement to sink rice tissues.	 In situ expression analysis and GUS staining showed that SEM1 was mainly expressed in vascular phloem cells
SEM1	sugar	Plasma membrane-localized SEM1 protein mediates sugar movement to sink rice tissues.	Plasma membrane-localized SEM1 protein mediates sugar movement to sink rice tissues.
SEM1	plasma membrane	Plasma membrane-localized SEM1 protein mediates sugar movement to sink rice tissues.	Plasma membrane-localized SEM1 protein mediates sugar movement to sink rice tissues.
SEM1	plasma membrane	Plasma membrane-localized SEM1 protein mediates sugar movement to sink rice tissues.	 Subcellular localization in rice showed that SEM1 localized to the plasma membrane
SEM1	callose biosynthesis	Plasma membrane-localized SEM1 protein mediates sugar movement to sink rice tissues	Map-based cloning identified two allelic mutations in a gene encoding a GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE (GSL) protein, thus indicating a role for SEM1 in callose biosynthesis.
SEM1	starch accumulation	Plasma membrane-localized SEM1 protein mediates sugar movement to sink rice tissues	Reduced sucrose transport was found in the sem1-1/1-2 mutant, which led to excessive starch accumulation in source leaves and inhibited photosynthesis.
