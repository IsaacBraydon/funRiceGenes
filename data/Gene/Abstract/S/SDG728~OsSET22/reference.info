BACKGROUND: SET domain is responsible for the catalytic activity of histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs) during developmental process. Histone lysine methylation plays a crucial and diverse regulatory function in chromatin organization and genome function. Although several SET genes have been identified and characterized in plants, the understanding of OsSET gene family in rice is still very limited. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, a systematic analysis was performed and revealed the presence of at least 43 SET genes in rice genome. Phylogenetic and structural analysis grouped SET proteins into five classes, and supposed that the domains out of SET domain were significant for the specific of histone lysine methylation, as well as the recognition of methylated histone lysine. Based on the global microarray, gene expression profile revealed that the transcripts of OsSET genes were accumulated differentially during vegetative and reproductive developmental stages and preferentially up or down-regulated in different tissues. Cis-elements identification, co-expression analysis and GO analysis of expression correlation of 12 OsSET genes suggested that OsSET genes might be involved in cell cycle regulation and feedback. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study will facilitate further studies on OsSET family and provide useful clues for functional validation of OsSETs.

Plant-2010-Qin-773-82.pdf	Rice SUVH histone methyltransferase genes display specific functions in chromatin modification and retrotransposon repression	2010	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, 430070 Wuhan, China.	Histone lysine methylation plays an important role in heterochromatin formation and reprogramming of gene expression. SET-domain-containing proteins are shown to have histone lysine methyltransferase activities. A large number of SET-domain genes are identified in plant genomes. The function of most SET-domain genes is not known. In this work, we studied the 12 rice (Oryza sativa) homologs of Su(var)3-9, the histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase identified in Drosophila. Several rice SUVHs (i.e. SDG714, SDG727, and SDG710) were found to have an antagonistic function to the histone H3K9 demethylase JMJ706, as down-regulation of these genes could partially complement the jmj706 phenotype and reduced histone H3K9 methylation. Down-regulation of a rice Su(var)3-9 homolog (SUVH), namely SDG728, decreased H3K9 methylation and altered seed morphology. Overexpression of the gene increased H3K9 methylation. SDG728 and other SUVH genes were found to be involved in the repression of retrotransposons such as Tos17 and a Ty1-copia element. Analysis of histone methylation suggested that SDG728-mediated H3K9 methylation may play an important role in retrotransposon repression.
