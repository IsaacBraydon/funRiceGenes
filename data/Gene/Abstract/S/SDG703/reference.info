Plant defense responses against insect pests are intricately regulated by highly complex regulatory networks. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones modulate the expression of genes involved in various biological processes. However, the role of PTMs in conferring insect resistance remains unclear. Through the screening of a T-DNA insertion activation-tagged mutant collection in rice, we identified the mutant planthopper susceptible 1 (phs1), which exhibits heightened expression of SET domain group 703 (SDG703). This overexpression is associated with increased susceptibility to the small brown planthopper (SBPH), an economically significant insect pest affecting rice crops. SDG703 is constitutively expressed in multiple tissues and shows substantial upregulation in response to SBPH feeding. SDG703 demonstrates the activity of histone H3K9 methyltransferase. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the downregulation of genes involved in effector-triggered immunity (ETI) and pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in plants overexpressing SDG703. Among the downregulated genes, the overexpression of SDG703 in plants resulted in a higher level of histone H3K9 methylation compared to control plants. Collectively, these findings indicate that SDG703 suppresses the expression of defense-related genes through the promotion of histone methylation, consequently leading to reduced resistance against SBPH. The defense-related genes regulated by histone methylation present valuable targets for developing effective pest management strategies in future studies. Furthermore, our study provides novel insight into the epigenetic regulation involved in plant-insect resistance.
