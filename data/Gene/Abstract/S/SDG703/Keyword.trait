SDG703	resistance	SET Domain Group 703 Regulates Planthopper Resistance by Suppressing the Expression of Defense-Related Genes.	 Collectively, these findings indicate that SDG703 suppresses the expression of defense-related genes through the promotion of histone methylation, consequently leading to reduced resistance against SBPH
SDG703	immunity	SET Domain Group 703 Regulates Planthopper Resistance by Suppressing the Expression of Defense-Related Genes.	 Transcriptomic analysis revealed the downregulation of genes involved in effector-triggered immunity (ETI) and pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in plants overexpressing SDG703
SDG703	methyltransferase	SET Domain Group 703 Regulates Planthopper Resistance by Suppressing the Expression of Defense-Related Genes.	 SDG703 demonstrates the activity of histone H3K9 methyltransferase
