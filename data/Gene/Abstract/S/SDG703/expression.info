SDG703	 Through the screening of a T-DNA insertion activation-tagged mutant collection in rice, we identified the mutant planthopper susceptible 1 (phs1), which exhibits heightened expression of SET domain group 703 (SDG703) |  Among the downregulated genes, the overexpression of SDG703 in plants resulted in a higher level of histone H3K9 methylation compared to control plants |  Collectively, these findings indicate that SDG703 suppresses the expression of defense-related genes through the promotion of histone methylation, consequently leading to reduced resistance against SBPH	 Among the downregulated genes, the overexpression of SDG703 in plants resulted in a higher level of histone H3K9 methylation compared to control plants
