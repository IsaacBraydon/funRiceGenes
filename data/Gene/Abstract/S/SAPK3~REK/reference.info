However, only limited numbers of the family members have been characterized and implicated in abscisic acid (ABA) and hyperosmotic stress signaling. We identified 10 SnRK2 protein kinases encoded by the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Each of the 10 members was expressed in cultured cell protoplasts, and its regulation was analyzed. Here, we demonstrate that all family members are activated by hyperosmotic stress and that three of them are also activated by ABA. Surprisingly, there were no members that were activated only by ABA. The activation was found to be regulated via phosphorylation. In addition to the functional distinction with respect to ABA regulation, dependence of activation on the hyperosmotic strength was different among the members. We show that the relatively diverged C-terminal domain is mainly responsible for this functional distinction, although the kinase domain also contributes to these differences. The results indicated that the SnRK2 protein kinase family has evolved specifically for hyperosmotic stress signaling and that individual members have acquired distinct regulatory properties, including ABA responsiveness by modifying the C-terminal domain.
NA	Molecular characterization reveals that OsSAPK3 improves drought tolerance and grain yield in rice.	2023	BMC Plant Biol	School of Chemical, Biological and Environmental Sciences, Yuxi Normal University, Yuxi, 653100, China.	BACKGROUND: Many data suggest that the sucrose non-fermenting 1-related kinases 2 (SnRK2s) are very important to abiotic stress for plants. In rice, these kinases are known as osmotic stress/ABA-activated protein kinases (SAPKs). Osmotic stress/ABA-activated protein kinase 3 (OsSAPK3) is a member of SnRK2II in rice, but its function is still unclear. RESULTS: The expression of OsSAPK3 was up regulated by drought, NaCl, PEG and ABA. OsSAPK3 mutated seedings (sapk3-1 and sapk3-2) showed reduced hypersensitivity to exogenous ABA. In addition, under drought conditions, sapk3-1 and sapk3-2 showed more intolerance to drought, including decreased survival rate, increased water loss rate, increased stomatal conductance and significantly decreased expression levels of SLAC1 and SLAC7. Physiological and metabolic analyses showed that OsSAPK3 might play an important role in drought stress signaling pathway by affecting osmotic adjustment and osmolytes, ROS detoxification and expression of ABA dependent and independent dehydration-responsive genes. All gronomic traits analyses demonstrated that OsSAPK3 could improve rice yield by affecting the regulation of tiller numbers and grain size. CONCLUSION: OsSAPK3 plays an important role in both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent drought stress responses. More interestingly, OsSAPK3 could improve rice yield by indirectly regulating tiller number and grain size. These findings provide new insight for the development of drought-resistant rice.
