SS1|ONAC025	shoot apical meristem	SUPER STARCHY1/ONAC025 participates in rice grain filling	Furthermore, rice transgenic plants ectopically expressing SS1/ ONAC025 have a plantlet lethal phenotype with hampered vegetative growth, but increased tillers and an altered shoot apical meristem structure. 
SS1|ONAC025	grain filling	SUPER STARCHY1/ONAC025 participates in rice grain filling	The article shows that SS1/ ONAC025 is a seed©\specific gene promoting grain filling in rice, and negatively affecting vegetative growth.
SS1|ONAC025	vegetative	SUPER STARCHY1/ONAC025 participates in rice grain filling	The article shows that SS1/ ONAC025 is a seed©\specific gene promoting grain filling in rice, and negatively affecting vegetative growth.
SS1|ONAC025	seed development	SUPER STARCHY1/ONAC025 participates in rice grain filling	In short, the expression pattern of the reporter gene, driven by the promoter of SS1/ ONAC025, indicated an important role of this gene in seed development, which has been explored in detail in this paper.
SS1|ONAC025	transcriptional repressor	SUPER STARCHY1/ONAC025 participates in rice grain filling	A repression in the activation ability of rGAL4 on fusion with SS1/ ONAC025 suggests that SS1/ ONAC025 functions as a transcriptional repressor in yeast.
