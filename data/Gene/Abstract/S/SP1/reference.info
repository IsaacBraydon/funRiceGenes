The architecture of the rice inflorescence, which is determined mainly by the number and length of primary and secondary inflorescence branches, is of importance in both agronomy and developmental biology. The position and number of primary branches are established during the phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, and several of the genes identified as participating in this process do so by regulating the meristemic activities of inflorescence. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism that controls inflorescence branch elongation. Here, we report on a novel rice mutant, short panicle1 (sp1), which is defective in rice panicle elongation, and thus leads to the short-panicle phenotype. Gene cloning and characterization indicate that SP1 encodes a putative transporter that belongs to the peptide transporter (PTR) family. This conclusion is based on the findings that SP1 contains a conserved PTR2 domain consisting of 12 transmembrane domains, and that the SP1-GFP fusion protein is localized in the plasma membrane. The SP1 gene is highly expressed in the phloem of the branches of young panicles, which is consistent with the predicted function of SP1 and the sp1 phenotype. Phylogenetic analysis implies that SP1 might be a nitrate transporter. However, neither nitrate transporter activity nor any other compounds transported by known PTR proteins could be detected in either a Xenopus oocyte or yeast system, in our study, suggesting that SP1 may need other component(s) to be able to function as a transporter, or that it transports unknown substrates in the monocotyledonous rice plant.
NA	BPB1 regulates rice (Oryza sative L.) panicle length and panicle branch development by promoting lignin and inhibiting cellulose accumulation.	2023	Mol Breed	Zhengzhou, 450046 Henan Province China Henan Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Henan Grain Crops, Henan Agricultural University. GRID: grid.108266.b. ISNI: 0000 0004 1803 0494	Panicle structure is one of the most important agronomic traits directly related to rice yield. This study identified a rice mutant basal primary branch 1 (bpb1), which exhibited a phenotype of reduced panicle length and arrested basal primary branch development. In addition, lignin content was found to be increased while cellulose content was decreased in bpb1 young panicles. Map-based cloning methods characterized the gene BPB1, which encodes a peptide transporter (PTR) family transporter. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the BPB1 family is highly conserved in plants, especially the PTR2 domain. It is worth noting that BPB1 is divided into two categories based on monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. Transcriptome analysis showed that BPB1 mutation can promote lignin synthesis and inhibit cellulose synthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, cell cycle, expression of various plant hormones, and some star genes, thereby inhibiting rice panicle length, resulting in basal primary branch development stagnant phenotypes. In this study, BPB1 provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of rice panicle structure regulation by BPB1 by regulating lignin and cellulose content and several transcriptional metabolic pathways.
