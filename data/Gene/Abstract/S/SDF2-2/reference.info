Plant genomes contain large number of plasma membrane (PM)-localized immune receptors, also called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then translocated to the PM, where they recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and activate innate immune response. The rice XA21 immune receptor confers resistance to the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). To identify components that mediate XA21-mediated signaling, we performed co-purification experiments using C-terminal GFP tagged XA21 protein. Several endoplasmic reticulum-quality control (ER-QC) proteins including stromal-derived factor 2 (SDF2) co-purified with XA21. Silencing of the SDF2 genes in the XA21 rice genetic background compromises resistance to Xoo but does not affect plant growth and development.
