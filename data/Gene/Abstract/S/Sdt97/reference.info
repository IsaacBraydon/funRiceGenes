NA	Sdt97, a Point Mutation in 5' Untranslated Region, Confers Semi-dwarfism in Rice.	2016	G3 (Bethesda)	Tianjin Crop Istitute; tongjiping@sina.com.	Semi-dwarfism is an important agronomic trait in rice breeding programs. A semi- dwarf mutant gene Sdt97 was previously described. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the mutant is yet to be elucidated. In this study, we identified the mutant gene by a map-based cloning method. Using a residual heterozygous line (RHL) population, Sdt97 was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 6 at the interval nearly 60 kb between STS marker N6 and SNP marker N16 within the PAC clone P0453H04. Sequence of the candidate genes in the target region revealed that a base transversion from G to C occurred in the 5' untranslated region of Sdt97 qRT-PCR results confirmed that the transversion induced obvious change in the expression pattern of Sdt97 at different growth and developmental stages. Transgenic of Sdt97 resulted in the restoration of semi-dwarfism of the mutant phenotype, or displayed a dwarfer phenotype compared with the mutant. Our results indicate that the Sdt97, a point mutation in 5' untranslated region, confers semi-dwarfism in rice. Functional analysis of Sdt97 will open a new field of study for rice semi-dwarfism, and also expand our knowledge of the molecular mechanism of semi-dwarfism in rice.
