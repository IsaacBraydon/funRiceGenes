Sdt97	growth	Sdt97, a Point Mutation in 5' Untranslated Region, Confers Semi-dwarfism in Rice.	Sequence of the candidate genes in the target region revealed that a base transversion from G to C occurred in the 5' untranslated region of Sdt97 qRT-PCR results confirmed that the transversion induced obvious change in the expression pattern of Sdt97 at different growth and developmental stages
Sdt97	dwarf	Sdt97, a Point Mutation in 5' Untranslated Region, Confers Semi-dwarfism in Rice.	A semi- dwarf mutant gene Sdt97 was previously described
