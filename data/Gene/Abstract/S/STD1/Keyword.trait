STD1	development	Reduction of ATPase activity in the rice kinesin protein Stemless Dwarf1 inhibits cell division and organ development.	 Therefore, these results indicate that the MT-dependent ATPase activity is indispensible for STD1 in regulating normal cell division and organ development
STD1	ATPase	Reduction of ATPase activity in the rice kinesin protein Stemless Dwarf1 inhibits cell division and organ development.	 In the std1 mutant, the substitution of Val-40-Glu in the motor domain of STD1 significantly reduced its MT-dependent ATPase activity
STD1	ATPase	Reduction of ATPase activity in the rice kinesin protein Stemless Dwarf1 inhibits cell division and organ development.	 Therefore, these results indicate that the MT-dependent ATPase activity is indispensible for STD1 in regulating normal cell division and organ development
STD1	map-based cloning	Reduction of ATPase activity in the rice kinesin protein Stemless Dwarf1 inhibits cell division and organ development.	 Map-based cloning revealed that STD1 encodes a phragmoplast-associated kinesin-related protein, a homolog of the Arabidopsis thaliana PAKRP2, and is mainly expressed in the actively dividing tissues
STD1	cell division	Reduction of ATPase activity in the rice kinesin protein Stemless Dwarf1 inhibits cell division and organ development.	 Therefore, these results indicate that the MT-dependent ATPase activity is indispensible for STD1 in regulating normal cell division and organ development
