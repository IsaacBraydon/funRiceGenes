OsNAC19|SNAC1|OsNAC9	 In this study, we performed Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and RNA-Seq of SNAC1-overexpression transgenic rice (SNAC1-OE) lines and wild-type under normal and moderate drought stress conditions, to identify all SNAC1 target genes at a genome-wide scale by RNA-Seq analyses |  SNAC1 can bind to the OsbZIP23 promoter, an important ABA signaling regulator, and positively regulate the expression of several ABA signaling genes	 In this study, we performed Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and RNA-Seq of SNAC1-overexpression transgenic rice (SNAC1-OE) lines and wild-type under normal and moderate drought stress conditions, to identify all SNAC1 target genes at a genome-wide scale by RNA-Seq analyses
OsNAC19|SNAC1|OsNAC9	Transcription factor OsSNAC1 positively regulates nitrate transporter gene expression in rice. |  OsSNAC1 overexpression significantly upregulated OsNRT2 | 1A/B expression, while the mutation of OsSNAC1 significantly downregulated OsNRT2 |  Y1H, transient co-expression and ChIP assays showed OsSNAC1 directly binds to the upstream promoter region of OsNRT2	 OsSNAC1 overexpression significantly upregulated OsNRT2
