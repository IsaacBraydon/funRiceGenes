SODX	disease resistance	Osa-miR398b boosts H 2 O 2 production and rice blast disease-resistance via multiple superoxide dismutases	These data indicate that upon M. oryzae infection, miR398b silences target genes CSD1, CSD2 and SODX, which in turn triggers upregulation of other SOD family members resulting in higher total SOD enzyme activity, leading to higher H2O2 production and enhanced blast disease©\resistance.
