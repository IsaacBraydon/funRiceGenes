OsCYT-INV1|SRT5	growth	Analysis of the rice SHORT-ROOT5 gene revealed functional diversification of plant neutral/alkaline invertase family	We previously described a rice mutant, srt5, which exhibits extremely stunted post-embryonic root growth that is rescuable by metabolizable sugars
OsCYT-INV1|SRT5	root development	Analysis of the rice SHORT-ROOT5 gene revealed functional diversification of plant neutral/alkaline invertase family	Sucrose levels in srt5 root cells were elevated, consistent with a crucial role for SRT5 in cytosolic sucrose cleavage at early root developmental stages
OsCYT-INV1|SRT5	root development	Analysis of the rice SHORT-ROOT5 gene revealed functional diversification of plant neutral/alkaline invertase family	These results suggest that SRT5 is the key isoform of Inv-Ns required for carbon and energy supply during early root development

OsCYT-INV1|SRT5	growth	OsCYT-INV1 for alkaline/neutral invertase is involved in root cell development and reproductivity in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Exogenously supplying glucose could rescue the root growth defects of the Oscyt-inv1 mutant

OsCYT-INV1|SRT5	root	OsCYT-INV1 for alkaline/neutral invertase is involved in root cell development and reproductivity in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	These results indicated that OsCyt-inv1 played important roles in root cell development and reproductivity in rice
OsCYT-INV1|SRT5	root	OsCYT-INV1 for alkaline/neutral invertase is involved in root cell development and reproductivity in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	OsCYT-INV1 for alkaline/neutral invertase is involved in root cell development and reproductivity in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
