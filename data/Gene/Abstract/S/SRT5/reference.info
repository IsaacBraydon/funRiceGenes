Although the rice genome contains eight Inv-N-like genes, their functions in plant development are unknown. We previously described a rice mutant, srt5, which exhibits extremely stunted post-embryonic root growth that is rescuable by metabolizable sugars. In the present study, we performed a functional analysis of the SRT5 gene. We showed that SRT5 encodes a putative cytosolic Inv-N that cleaves sucrose at pH 7.0 and 8.0. An SRT5-GFP fusion protein was localized to the cytosol. Sucrose levels in srt5 root cells were elevated, consistent with a crucial role for SRT5 in cytosolic sucrose cleavage at early root developmental stages. SRT5 was found to be ubiquitously expressed in various plant organs, whereas the other seven rice Inv-Ns were differentially expressed, suggesting that the functions of these latter proteins are distinct from that of SRT5. In support of this view, molecular evolutionary analysis revealed that all of the most closely related paralogs of SRT5 (OsNIN5, OsNIN6, and OsNIN7) have multiple non-conservative amino acid substitutions not found in SRT5. These results suggest that SRT5 is the key isoform of Inv-Ns required for carbon and energy supply during early root development.

A short root mutant was isolated from an EMS-generated rice mutant library. Under normal growth conditions, the mutant exhibited short root, delayed flowering, and partial sterility. Some sections of the roots revealed that the cell length along the longitudinal axis was reduced and the cell shape in the root elongation zone shrank. Genetic analysis indicated that the short root phenotype was controlled by a recessive gene. Map-based cloning revealed that a nucleotide substitution causing an amino acid change from Gly to Arg occurred in the predicted rice gene (Os02g0550600). It coded an alkaline/neutral invertase and was homologous to Arabidopsis gene AtCyt-inv1. This gene was designated as OsCyt-inv1. The results of carbohydrate analysis showed an accumulation of sucrose and reduction of hexose in the Oscyt-inv1 mutant. Exogenously supplying glucose could rescue the root growth defects of the Oscyt-inv1 mutant. These results indicated that OsCyt-inv1 played important roles in root cell development and reproductivity in rice.
