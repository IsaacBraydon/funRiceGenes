Sub1C	submergence	Development of submergence-tolerant rice cultivars: the Sub1 locus and beyond	The objectives of this study were to (a) develop mega varieties with Sub1 introgression that are submergence tolerant, (b) assess the performance of Sub1 in different genetic backgrounds, (c) determine the roles of the Sub1A and Sub1C genes in conferring tolerance, and (d) assess the level of tolerance in F(1) hybrids heterozygous for the Sub1A-1-tolerant allele
