1674.pdf	The submergence tolerance regulator Sub1A mediates stress-responsive expression of AP2/ERF transcription factors	2010	Plant Physiol	Department of Plant Pathology, University of California, Davis, California 95616, USA.	We previously characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) Submergence1 (Sub1) locus encoding three ethylene-responsive factor (ERF) transcriptional regulators. Genotypes carrying the Sub1A-1 allele are tolerant of prolonged submergence. To elucidate the mechanism of Sub1A-1-mediated tolerance, we performed transcriptome analyses comparing the temporal submergence response of Sub1A-1-containing tolerant M202(Sub1) with the intolerant isoline M202 lacking this gene. We identified 898 genes displaying Sub1A-1-dependent regulation. Integration of the expression data with publicly available metabolic pathway data identified submergence tolerance-associated pathways governing anaerobic respiration, hormone responses, and antioxidant systems. Of particular interest were a set of APETALA2 (AP2)/ERF family transcriptional regulators that are associated with the Sub1A-1-mediated response upon submergence. Visualization of expression patterns of the AP2/ERF superfamily members in a phylogenetic context resolved 12 submergence-regulated AP2/ERFs into three putative functional groups: (1) anaerobic respiration and cytokinin-mediated delay in senescence via ethylene accumulation during submergence (three ERFs); (2) negative regulation of ethylene-dependent gene expression (five ERFs); and (3) negative regulation of gibberellin-mediated shoot elongation (four ERFs). These results confirm that the presence of Sub1A-1 impacts multiple pathways of response to submergence.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Submergence is a recurring problem in the rice-producing rainfed lowlands of south and south-east Asia. Developing rice cultivars with tolerance of submergence and with agronomic and quality traits acceptable to farmers is a feasible approach to address this problem. The objectives of this study were to (a) develop mega varieties with Sub1 introgression that are submergence tolerant, (b) assess the performance of Sub1 in different genetic backgrounds, (c) determine the roles of the Sub1A and Sub1C genes in conferring tolerance, and (d) assess the level of tolerance in F(1) hybrids heterozygous for the Sub1A-1-tolerant allele. METHODS: Tolerant varieties were developed by marker-assisted backcrossing through two or three backcrosses, and their performance was evaluated to determine the effect of Sub1 in different genetic backgrounds. The roles of Sub1A and Sub1C in conferring the tolerant phenotype were further investigated using recombinants identified within the Sub1 gene cluster based on survival and gene expression data. KEY RESULTS: All mega varieties with Sub1 introgression had a significantly higher survival rate than the original parents. An intolerant Sub1C allele combined with the tolerant Sub1A-1 allele did not significantly reduce the level of tolerance, and the Sub1C-1 expression appeared to be independent of the Sub1A allele; however, even when Sub1C-1 expression is completely turned off in the presence of Sub1A-2, plants remained intolerant. Survival rates and Sub1A expression were significantly lower in heterozygotes compared with the homozygous tolerant parent. CONCLUSIONS: Sub1 provided a substantial enhancement in the level of tolerance of all the sensitive mega varieties. Sub1A is confirmed as the primary contributor to tolerance, while Sub1C alleles do not seem important. Lack of dominance of Sub1 suggests that the Sub1A-1 allele should be carried by both parents for developing tolerant rice hybrids.

Submergence of plant organs perturbs homeostasis by limiting diffusion of oxygen, carbon dioxide and ethylene. In rice (Oryza sativa L.), the haplotype at the multigenic SUBMERGENCE1 (SUB1) locus determines whether plants survive prolonged submergence. SUB1 encodes two or three transcription factors of the group VII ethylene response factor family: SUB1A, SUB1B and SUB1C. The presence of SUB1A-1 and its strong submergence-triggered ethylene-mediated induction confers submergence tolerance through a quiescence survival strategy that inhibits gibberellin (GA)-induced carbohydrate consumption and elongation growth. SUB1C is invariably present and acts downstream of the enhancement of GA responsiveness during submergence. In this study, heterologous ectopic expression of rice SUB1A and SUB1C in Arabidopsis thaliana was used to explore conserved mechanisms of action associated with these genes using developmental, physiological and molecular metrics. As in rice transgenic plants that ectopically express SUB1A-1, Arabidopsis transgenic plants that constitutively express SUB1A displayed GA insensitivity and abscisic acid hypersensitivity. Ectopic SUB1C expression had more limited effects on development, stress responses and the transcriptome. Observation of a delayed flowering phenotype in lines over-expressing SUB1A led to the finding that inhibition of floral initiation is a component of the quiescence survival strategy in rice. Together, these analyses demonstrate conserved as well as specific roles for group VII ethylene response factors in integration of abiotic responses with development.
