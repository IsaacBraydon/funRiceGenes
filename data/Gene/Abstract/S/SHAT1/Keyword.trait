SHAT1	transcription factor	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	 The SHAT1 gene, which encodes an APETALA2 transcription factor, is required for seed shattering through specifying abscission zone (AZ) development in rice
SHAT1	transcription factor	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	 Genetic analyses revealed that the expression of SHAT1 in AZ was positively regulated by the trihelix transcription factor SH4
SHAT1	seed	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	 Here, we identified a seed shattering abortion1 (shat1) mutant in a wild rice introgression line
SHAT1	seed	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	 The SHAT1 gene, which encodes an APETALA2 transcription factor, is required for seed shattering through specifying abscission zone (AZ) development in rice
SHAT1	shattering	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	 Here, we identified a seed shattering abortion1 (shat1) mutant in a wild rice introgression line
SHAT1	shattering	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	 The SHAT1 gene, which encodes an APETALA2 transcription factor, is required for seed shattering through specifying abscission zone (AZ) development in rice
SHAT1	spikelet	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	 Our results suggest a genetic model in which the persistent and concentrated expression of active SHAT1 and SH4 in the AZ during early spikelet developmental stages is required for conferring AZ identification
