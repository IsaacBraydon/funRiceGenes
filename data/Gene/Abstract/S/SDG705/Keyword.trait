SDG705	development	SDG721 and SDG705 are required for rice growth.	 Here, we report that SDG721 (SET-domain group protein 721) and SDG705 are involved in regulating rice development
SDG705	development	SDG721 and SDG705 are required for rice growth.	 Together, these results suggest that SDG721 and SDG705 regulate H3K4 methylation, which is crucial for plant development in rice
SDG705	plant development	SDG721 and SDG705 are required for rice growth.	 Together, these results suggest that SDG721 and SDG705 regulate H3K4 methylation, which is crucial for plant development in rice
SDG705	panicle	SDG721 and SDG705 are required for rice growth.	 Loss of SDG721 and SDG705 function resulted in GA-deficient phenotypes, including semi-dwarfism, reduced cell length, and reduced panicle branching
SDG705	 ga 	SDG721 and SDG705 are required for rice growth.	 The transcripts levels and H3K4me3 levels of GA biosynthesis genes and GA signaling pathway genes were downregulated in the sdg721 sdg705 plants
SDG705	branching	SDG721 and SDG705 are required for rice growth.	 Loss of SDG721 and SDG705 function resulted in GA-deficient phenotypes, including semi-dwarfism, reduced cell length, and reduced panicle branching
SDG705	GA	SDG721 and SDG705 are required for rice growth.	 The transcripts levels and H3K4me3 levels of GA biosynthesis genes and GA signaling pathway genes were downregulated in the sdg721 sdg705 plants
SDG705	GA biosynthesis	SDG721 and SDG705 are required for rice growth.	 The transcripts levels and H3K4me3 levels of GA biosynthesis genes and GA signaling pathway genes were downregulated in the sdg721 sdg705 plants
