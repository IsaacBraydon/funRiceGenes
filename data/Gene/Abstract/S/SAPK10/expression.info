SAPK10|OsSAPK10	) osa-miR2105 (miR2105) and the Stress/ABA-activated protein kinase (OsSAPK10) coordinately regulate the rice basic region-leucine zipper transcription factor (bZIP TF; OsbZIP86) at the posttranscriptional and posttranslational levels to control drought-induced ABA biosynthesis via modulation of rice 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (OsNCED3) expression |  OsSAPK10 can phosphorylate and activate OsbZIP86 to enhance the expression of OsNCED3
