The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) induces gene expression via the ABA-response element (ABRE) present in the promoters of ABA-regulated genes. A group of bZIP proteins have been identified as ABRE-binding factors (ABFs) that activate transcription through this cis element. A rice ABF, TRAB1, has been shown to be activated via ABA-dependent phosphorylation. While a large number of signalling factors have been identified that are involved in stomatal regulation by ABA, relatively less is known about the ABA-signalling pathway that leads to gene expression. We have shown recently that three members of the rice SnRK2 protein kinase family, SAPK8, SAPK9 and SAPK10, are activated by ABA signal as well as by hyperosmotic stress. Here we show that transient overexpression in cultured cell protoplasts of these ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinases leads to the activation of an ABRE-regulated promoter, suggesting that these kinases are involved in the gene-regulation pathway of ABA signalling. We further show several lines of evidence that these ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinases directly phosphorylate TRAB1 in response to ABA. Kinetic analysis of SAPK10 activation and TRAB1 phosphorylation indicated that the latter immediately followed the former. TRAB1 was found to be phosphorylated not only in response to ABA, but also in response to hyperosmotic stress, which was interpreted as the consequence of phosphorylation of TRAB1 by hyperosmotically activated SAPKs. Physical interaction between TRAB1 and SAPK10 in vivo was demonstrated by a co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Finally, TRAB1 was phosphorylated in vitro by the ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinases at Ser102, which is phosphorylated in vivo in response to ABA and is critical for the activation function.
tpc1601163.pdf	Differential Activation of the Rice Sucrose Nonfermenting1-Related Protein Kinase2 Family by Hyperosmotic Stress and Abscisic Acid	2004	The Plant Cell Online	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan	To date, a large number of sequences of protein kinases that belong to the sucrose nonfermenting1â€“related protein kinase2 (SnRK2) family are found in databases. However, only limited numbers of the family members have been characterized and implicated in abscisic acid (ABA) and hyperosmotic stress signaling. We identified 10 SnRK2 protein kinases encoded by the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Each of the 10 members was expressed in cultured cell protoplasts, and its regulation was analyzed. Here, we demonstrate that all family members are activated by hyperosmotic stress and that three of them are also activated by ABA. Surprisingly, there were no members that were activated only by ABA. The activation was found to be regulated via phosphorylation. In addition to the functional distinction with respect to ABA regulation, dependence of activation on the hyperosmotic strength was different among the members. We show that the relatively diverged C-terminal domain is mainly responsible for this functional distinction, although the kinase domain also contributes to these differences. The results indicated that the SnRK2 protein kinase family has evolved specifically for hyperosmotic stress signaling and that individual members have acquired distinct regulatory properties, including ABA responsiveness by modifying the C-terminal domain.
NA	SAPK10-Mediated Phosphorylation on WRKY72 Releases Its Suppression on Jasmonic Acid Biosynthesis and Bacterial Blight Resistance.	2019	iScience	State Key Lab of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 311400, China.	Bacterial blight caused by the infection of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is a devastating disease that severely challenges the yield of rice. Here, we report the identification of a &quot;SAPK10-WRKY72-AOS1&quot; module, through which Xoo infection stimulates the suppression of jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis to cause Xoo susceptibility. WRKY72 directly binds to the W-box in the promoter of JA biosynthesis gene AOS1 and represses its transcription by inducing DNA hypermethylation on the target site, which finally led to lower endogenous JA level and higher Xoo susceptibility. Abscisic acid (ABA)-inducible SnRK2-type kinase SAPK10 phosphorylates WRKY72 at Thr 129. The SAPK10-mediated phosphorylation impairs the DNA-binding ability of WRKY72 and releases its suppression on AOS1 and JA biosynthesis. Our work highlights a module of how pathogen stimuli lead to plant susceptibility, as well as a potential pathway for ABA-JA interplay with post-translational modification and epigenetic regulation mechanism involved.
NA	miR2105 and the kinase OsSAPK10 co-regulate OsbZIP86 to mediate drought-induced ABA biosynthesis in rice.	2021	Plant Physiol	Key Laboratory of South China Agricultural Plant Molecular Analysis and Genetic Improvement &amp; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Botany, South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510650, China.	Mediating induced abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis is important for enhancing plant stress tolerance. Here, we found that rice (Oryza sativa L.) osa-miR2105 (miR2105) and the Stress/ABA-activated protein kinase (OsSAPK10) coordinately regulate the rice basic region-leucine zipper transcription factor (bZIP TF; OsbZIP86) at the posttranscriptional and posttranslational levels to control drought-induced ABA biosynthesis via modulation of rice 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (OsNCED3) expression. OsbZIP86 expression is regulated by miR2105-directed cleavage of the OsbZIP86 mRNA. OsbZIP86 encodes a nuclear TF that binds to the promoter of the ABA biosynthetic gene OsNCED3. OsSAPK10 can phosphorylate and activate OsbZIP86 to enhance the expression of OsNCED3. Under normal growth conditions, altered expression of miR2105 and OsbZIP86 displayed no substantial effect on rice growth. However, under drought conditions, miR2105 knockdown or OsbZIP86 overexpression transgenic rice plants showed higher ABA content, enhanced tolerance to drought, lower rates of water loss, and more stomatal closure of seedlings, compared with wild-type rice Zhonghua 11; in contrast, miR2105 overexpression, OsbZIP86 downregulation, and OsbZIP86 knockout plants displayed opposite phenotypes. Collectively, our results show that the &quot;miR2105-(OsSAPK10)-OsbZIP86-OsNCED3&quot; module regulates the drought-induced ABA biosynthesis without penalty on rice growth under normal conditions, suggesting candidates for improving drought tolerance in rice.
