NA	Genome-edited ATP BINDING CASSETTE B1 transporter SD8 knockouts have optimized rice architecture without yield penalty.	2022	Plant Commun	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, Beijing 100081, China.	In this work we identified that a putative rice ORF Semi-Dwarf in chr8 (SD8) that encodes a putative ortholog of the Arabidopsis thaliana ABCB1. Genome-edited SD8 could optimize rice architecture by reducing plant height and flag leaf angle without yield penalty. Moreover, SD8 knockouts may even have the potential for increased yield under high density planting in rice.
