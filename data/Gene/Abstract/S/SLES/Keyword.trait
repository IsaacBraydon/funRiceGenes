SLES	leaf	Identification of a Spotted Leaf Sheath Gene Involved in Early Senescence and Defense Response in Rice.	 The sles phenotype differed from that of other LMMs in that lesion mimic spots were observed on the leaf sheath rather than on leaves
SLES	leaf	Identification of a Spotted Leaf Sheath Gene Involved in Early Senescence and Defense Response in Rice.	 Taken together, our results revealed that SLES was associated with the formation of lesion mimic spots on the leaf sheath resulting early senescence and defense responses
SLES	senescence	Identification of a Spotted Leaf Sheath Gene Involved in Early Senescence and Defense Response in Rice.	 Taken together, our results revealed that SLES was associated with the formation of lesion mimic spots on the leaf sheath resulting early senescence and defense responses
SLES	resistance	Identification of a Spotted Leaf Sheath Gene Involved in Early Senescence and Defense Response in Rice.	 Further examination of SLES will facilitate a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in ROS homeostasis and may also provide opportunities to improve pathogen resistance in rice
