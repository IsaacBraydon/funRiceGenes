sd1|GA20ox2|OsGA20ox2	 The expression of the OsGA20ox2 gene was significantly suppressed in mutant plants, while the expression level was not affected for other GA biosynthesis (OsGA2ox3 and OsGA3ox2) and signaling (D1, GIDI and SLR1) genes |  Total 30 protein spots were exercised, and 24 proteins were identified, and results showed that OsGA20ox2 editing altered protein expression
