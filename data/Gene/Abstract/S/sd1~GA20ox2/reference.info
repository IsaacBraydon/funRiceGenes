10.1007-s00425-010-1263-1.pdf	Identification and characterization of dwarf 62, a loss-of-function mutation in DLT/OsGRAS-32 affecting gibberellin metabolism in rice	2010	Planta	Department of Agronomy, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310029, China.	A dwarf mutant, dwarf 62 (d62), was isolated from rice cultivar 93-11 by mutagenesis with gamma-rays. Under normal growth conditions, the mutant had multiple abnormal phenotypes, such as dwarfism, wide and dark-green leaf blades, reduced tiller numbers, late and asynchronous heading, short roots, partial male sterility, etc. Genetic analysis indicated that the abnormal phenotypes were controlled by the recessive mutation of a single nuclear gene. Using molecular markers, the D62 gene was fine mapped in 131-kb region at the short arm of chromosome 6. Positional cloning of D62 gene revealed that it was the same locus as DLT/OsGRAS-32, which encodes a member of the GRAS family. In previous studies, the DLT/OsGRAS-32 is confirmed to play positive roles in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Sequence analysis showed that the d62 carried a 2-bp deletion in ORF region of D62 gene which led to a loss-of-function mutation. The function of D62 gene was confirmed by complementation experiment. RT-PCR analysis and promoter activity analysis showed that the D62 gene expressed in all tested tissues including roots, stems, leaves and panicles of rice plant. The d62 mutant exhibited decreased activity of alpha-amylase in endosperm and reduced content of endogenous GA(1). The expression levels of gibberellin (GA) biosynthetic genes including OsCPS1, OsKS1, OsKO1, OsKAO, OsGA20ox2/SD1 and OsGA2ox3 were significantly increased in d62 mutant. Briefly, these results demonstrated that the D62 (DLT/OsGRAS-32) not only participated in the regulation of BR signaling, but also influenced GA metabolism in rice.
10.1007-s11103-004-1692-y.pdf	A role of OsGA20ox1 , encoding an isoform of gibberellin 20-oxidase, for regulation of plant stature in rice	2004	Plant Mol Biol	Laboratory of Bio-control, Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Niigata University, 2-8050 Ikarashi, Niigata 950-2181, Japan.	Gibberellin (GA) 20-oxidase (GA20ox) is a key enzyme that normally catalyzes the penultimate steps in GA biosynthesis. One of the GA20ox genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.), OsGA20ox2 ( SD1 ), is well known as the "Green Revolution gene", and loss-of function mutation in this locus causes semi-dwarfism. Another GA20ox gene, OsGA20ox1, has also been identified, but its contribution to plant stature has remained unclear because no suitable mutants have been available. We isolated a mutant, B142, tagged with a T-DNA containing three CaMV 35S promoters, which showed a tall, GA-overproduction phenotype. The final stature of the B142 mutant reflects internode overgrowth and is approximately twice that of its wild-type parent. This mutant responds to application of both GA3 and a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, indicating that it is a novel tall mutant of rice distinct from GA signaling mutants such as slr1 . The integrated T-DNAs, which contain three CaMV 35S promoters, are located upstream of the OsGA20ox1 open reading frame (ORF) in the B142 mutant genome. Analysis of mRNA and the endogenous GAs reveal that biologically active GA level is increased by up-regulation of the OsGA20ox1 gene in B142. Introduction of OsGA20ox1 cDNA driven by 35S promoter into the wild type phenocopies the morphological characteristics of B142. These results indicate that the elongated phenotype of the B142 mutant is caused by up-regulation of the OsGA20ox1 gene. Moreover, the final stature of rice was reduced by specific suppression of the OsGA20ox1 gene expression. This result indicates that not only OsGA20ox2 but also OsGA20ox1 affects plant stature.
416701a.pdf	Green revolution: a mutant gibberellin-synthesis gene in rice	2002	Nature	Bioscience Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan. makoto@nuagr1.agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp	The chronic food shortage that was feared after the rapid expansion of the world population in the 1960s was averted largely by the development of a high-yielding semi-dwarf variety of rice known as IR8, the so-called rice 'green revolution'. The short stature of IR8 is due to a mutation in the plant's sd1 gene, and here we identify this gene as encoding an oxidase enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of gibberellin, a plant growth hormone. Gibberellin is also implicated in green-revolution varieties of wheat, but the reduced height of those crops is conferred by defects in the hormone's signalling pathway.
DNA Res-2002-Monna-11-7.pdf	Positional Cloning of Rice Semidwarfing Gene, sd-1: Rice "Green Revolution Gene" Encodes a Mutant Enzyme Involved in Gibberellin Synthesis	2002	DNA Research	Plant Genome Center 1-25-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0856, Japan	A rice semidwarfing gene, sd-1, known as the â€œgreen revolution gene,â€<U+393C><U+3E64> was isolated by positional cloning and revealed to encode gibberellin 20-oxidase, the key enzyme in the gibberellin biosynthesis pathway. Analysis of 3477 segregants using several PCR-based marker technologies, including cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence, derived-CAPS, and single nucleotide polymorphisms revealed 1 ORF in a 6-kb candidate interval. Normal-type rice cultivars have an identical sequence in this region, consisting of 3 exons (558, 318, and 291 bp) and 2 introns (105 and 1471 bp). Dee-Geo-Woo-Gen-type sd-1 mutants have a 383-bp deletion from the genome (278-bp deletion from the expressed sequence), from the middle of exon 1 to upstream of exon 2, including a 105-bp intron, resulting in a frame-shift that produces a termination codon after the deletion site. The radiation-induced sd-1 mutant Calrose 76 has a 1-bp substitution in exon 2, causing an amino acid substitution (Leu [CTC] to Phe [TTC]). Expression analysis suggests the existence of at least one more locus of gibberellin 20-oxidase which may prevent severe dwarfism from developing in sd-1 mutants.
Itoh-2005-Overexpression of a.pdf	Overexpression of a GRAS protein lacking the DELLA domain confers altered gibberellin responses in rice	2005	Plant J	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya, Aichi 464-8601, Japan.	The rice SLR1 (SLENDER RICE 1) gene encodes a DELLA protein that belongs to a subfamily of the GRAS protein superfamily and that functions as a repressor of gibberellin (GA) signaling. Based on the constitutive GA response phenotype of slr1 mutants, SLR1 has been thought to be the sole DELLA-type protein suppressing GA signals in rice. However, in rice genome databases we identified two sequences homologous to SLR1: SLR1-like1 and -2 (SLRL1 and -2). SLRL1 and SLRL2 contain regions with high similarity to the C-terminal conserved domains in SLR1, but lack the N-terminal conserved region of the DELLA proteins. The expression of SLRL1 was positively regulated by GA at the mRNA level and occurred preferentially in reproductive organs, whereas SLRL2 was moderately expressed in mature leaf organs and was not affected by GA. Transformation of SLRL1 into the slr1 mutant rescued the slender phenotype of this mutant. Moreover, overexpression of SLRL1 in normal rice plants induced a dwarf phenotype with an increased level of OsGA20ox2 gene expression and diminished the GA-induced shoot elongation, suggesting that SLRL1 acts as a repressor of GA signaling. Consistent with the fact that SLRL1 does not have a DELLA domain, which is essential for degradation of DELLA proteins, a level of SLRL1 protein was not degraded by application of gibberellic acid. However, the repressive activity of SLRL1 against GA signaling was much weaker than a truncated SLR1 lacking the DELLA domain. Based on these characteristics of SLRL1, the functional roles of SLRL1 in GA signaling in rice are discussed.
j.1365-313X.2006.02875.x.pdf	The rice SPINDLY gene functions as a negative regulator of gibberellin signaling by controlling the suppressive function of the DELLA protein, SLR1, and modulating brassinosteroid synthesis	2006	Plant J	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya, Aichi 464-8601, Japan.	SPINDLY (SPY) encodes an O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase that is considered to be a negative regulator of gibberellin (GA) signaling through an unknown mechanism. To understand the function of SPY in GA signaling in rice, we isolated a rice SPINDLY homolog (OsSPY) and produced knockdown transgenic plants in which OsSPY expression was reduced by introducing its antisense or RNAi construct. In knockdown plants, the enhanced elongation of lower internodes was correlated with decreased levels of OsSPY expression, similar to the spindly phenotype of Arabidopsis spy mutants, suggesting that OsSPY also functions as a negative factor in GA signaling in rice. The suppressive function of OsSPY in GA signaling was supported by the findings that the dwarfism was partially rescued and OsGA20ox2 (GA20 oxidase) expression was reduced in GA-deficient and GA-insensitive mutants by the knockdown of OsSPY function. The suppression of OsSPY function in a GA-insensitive mutant, gid2, also caused an increase in the phosphorylation of a rice DELLA protein, SLR1, but did not change the amount of SLR1. This indicates that the function of OsSPY in GA signaling is not via changes in the amount or stability of SLR1, but probably involves control of the suppressive function of SLR1. In addition to the GA-related phenotypes, OsSPY antisense and RNAi plants showed increased lamina joint bending, which is a brassinosteroid-related phenotype, indicating that OsSPY may play roles both in GA signaling and in the brassinosteroid pathway.
j.1365-313X.2008.03707.x.pdf	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice	2009	Plant J	Research Center for Molecular & Developmental Biology, Key Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Environmental Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	Gibberellins (GAs) and brassinosteroids (BRs), two growth-promoting phytohormones, regulate many common physiological processes. Their interactions at the molecular level remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that OsGSR1, a member of the GAST (GA-stimulated transcript) gene family, is induced by GA and repressed by BR. RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic rice plants with reduced OsGSR1 expression show phenotypes similar to plants deficient in BR, including short primary roots, erect leaves and reduced fertility. The OsGSR1 RNAi transgenic rice shows a reduced level of endogenous BR, and the dwarf phenotype could be rescued by the application of brassinolide. The yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that OsGSR1 interacts with DIM/DWF1, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion from 24-methylenecholesterol to campesterol in BR biosynthesis. These results suggest that OsGSR1 activates BR synthesis by directly regulating a BR biosynthetic enzyme at the post-translational level. Furthermore, OsGSR1 RNAi plants show a reduced sensitivity to GA treatment, an increased expression of the GA biosynthetic gene OsGA20ox2, which is feedback inhibited by GA signaling, and an elevated level of endogenous GA: together, these suggest that OsGSR1 is a positive regulator of GA signaling. These results demonstrate that OsGSR1 plays important roles in both BR and GA pathways, and also mediates an interaction between the two signaling pathways.
Plant Physiol.-2007-Dai-121-33.pdf	The rice YABBY1 gene is involved in the feedback regulation of gibberellin metabolism	2007	Plant Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis is regulated by feedback control providing a mechanism for GA homeostasis in plants. However, regulatory elements involved in the feedback control are not known. In this report, we show that a rice (Oryza sativa) YABBY1 (YAB1) gene had a similar expression pattern as key rice GA biosynthetic genes GA3ox2 and GA20ox2. Overexpression of YAB1 in transgenic rice resulted in a semidwarf phenotype that could be fully rescued by applied GA. Quantification of the endogenous GA content revealed increases of GA(20) and decreases of GA(1) levels in the overexpression plants, in which the transcripts of the biosynthetic gene GA3ox2 were decreased. Cosuppression of YAB1 in transgenic plants induced expression of GA3ox2. The repression of GA3ox2 could be obtained upon treatment by dexamethasone of transgenic plants expressing a YAB1-glucocorticoid receptor fusion. Importantly, we show that YAB1 bound to a GA-responsive element within the GA3ox2 promoter. In addition, the expression of YAB1 was deregulated in GA biosynthesis and signaling mutants and could be either transiently induced by GA or repressed by a GA inhibitor. Finally, either overexpression or cosuppression of YAB1 impaired GA-mediated repression of GA3ox2. These data together suggest that YAB1 is involved in the feedback regulation of GA biosynthesis in rice.
PNAS-2002-Spielmeyer-9043-8.pdf	Semidwarf (sd-1), "green revolution" rice, contains a defective gibberellin 20-oxidase gene	2002	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Division of Plant Industry, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, GPO Box 1600, Canberra ACT 2601, Australia. wolfgang.spielmeyer@csiro.au	The introduction of semidwarf rice (Oryza sativa L.) led to record yield increases throughout Asia in the 1960s. The major semidwarfing allele, sd-1, is still extensively used in modern rice cultivars. The phenotype of sd-1 is consistent with dwarfism that results from a deficiency in gibberellin (GA) plant growth hormones. We propose that the semidwarf (sd-1) phenotype is the result of a deficiency of active GAs in the elongating stem arising from a defective 20-oxidase GA biosynthetic enzyme. Sequence data from the rice genome was combined with previous mapping studies to locate a putative GA 20-oxidase gene (Os20ox2) at the predicted map location of sd-1 on chromosome 1. Two independent sd-1 alleles contained alterations within Os20ox2: a deletion of 280 bp within the coding region of Os20ox2 was predicted to encode a nonfunctional protein in an indica type semidwarf (Doongara), whereas a substitution in an amino acid residue (Leu-266) that is highly conserved among dioxygenases could explain loss of function of Os20ox2 in a japonica semidwarf (Calrose76). The quantification of GAs in elongating stems by GC-MS showed that the initial substrate of GA 20-oxidase activity (GA53) accumulated, whereas the content of the major product (GA20) and of bioactive GA1 was lower in semidwarf compared with tall lines. We propose that the Os20ox2 gene corresponds to the sd-1 locus.
NA	Control of grain protein contents through SEMIDWARF1 mutant alleles: sd1 increases the grain protein content in Dee-geo-woo-gen but not in Reimei.	2014	Mol Genet Genomics	Hokuriku Research Center, NARO Agricultural Research Center, 1-2-1, Inada, Joetsu, Niigata, 943-0193, Japan	A new possibility for genetic control of the protein content of rice grains was suggested by the allele differences of the SEMIDWARF1 (SD1) mutation. Two quantitative trait loci-qPROT1 and qPROT12-were found on chromosomes 1 and 12, respectively, using backcrossed inbred lines of Sasanishiki/Habataki//Sasanishiki///Sasanishiki. One of them, qPROT1, increased almost all grain proteins instead of only certain proteins in the recessive Habataki allele. Fine mapping of qPROT1 revealed that two gene candidates-Os01g0883800 and Os01g0883900-were included in this region. Os01g0883800 encoded Gibberellin 20 oxidase 2 as well as SD1, the dwarf gene used in the so-called 'Green Revolution'. Mutant analyses as well as sequencing analysis using the semi-dwarf mutant cultivars Dee-geo-woo-gen and Calrose 76 revealed that the sd1 mutant showed significantly higher grain protein contents than their corresponding wild-type cultivars, strongly suggesting that the high protein contents were caused by sd1 mutation. However, the sd1 mutant Reimei did not have high grain protein contents. It is possible to control the grain protein content and column length separately by selecting for sd1 alleles. From this finding, the genetic control of grain protein content, as well as the column length of rice cultivars, might be possible. This ability might be useful to improve rice nutrition, particularly in areas where the introduction of semi-dwarf cultivars is not advanced.
NA	Intragenic recombination between two non-functional semi-dwarf 1 alleles produced a functional SD1 allele in a tall recombinant inbred line in rice.	2017	PLoS One	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	Intragenic recombination is one of the most important sources of genetic variability. In our previous study, RI92 a tall line (160 cm of plant height) was observed in the cross progeny between two semi-dwarf indica cultivars Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63. Genome-wide genotyping and sequencing indicated that the genome constitution of RI92 was completely from both parents. Bulk segregant analysis in a BC3F2 population revealed that &quot;green revolution gene&quot; semi-dwarf 1 (sd1) was most likely the gene controlling the tall plant height in RI92. Sequencing analysis of SD1 revealed that an intragenic recombination occurred between two parental non-functional sd1 alleles and generated a functional SD1 in RI92. Four-fold high recombination rate in SD1 located bins to the genome-wide average was observed in two RIL populations, indicating recombination hotspot in the SD1 region. Intragenic recombination creates new alleles in the progeny distinct from parental alleles and diversifies natural variation.
NA	Ethylene-gibberellin signaling underlies adaptation of rice to periodic flooding.	2018	Science	Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Miyagi 890-8577, Japan. tkuroha@m.tohoku.ac.jp srm4@cornell.edu ashi@agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp.	Most plants do poorly when flooded. Certain rice varieties, known as deepwater rice, survive periodic flooding and consequent oxygen deficiency by activating internode growth of stems to keep above the water. Here, we identify the gibberellin biosynthesis gene, SD1 (SEMIDWARF1), whose loss-of-function allele catapulted the rice Green Revolution, as being responsible for submergence-induced internode elongation. When submerged, plants carrying the deepwater rice-specific SD1 haplotype amplify a signaling relay in which the SD1 gene is transcriptionally activated by an ethylene-responsive transcription factor, OsEIL1a. The SD1 protein directs increased synthesis of gibberellins, largely GA4, which promote internode elongation. Evolutionary analysis shows that the deepwater rice-specific haplotype was derived from standing variation in wild rice and selected for deepwater rice cultivation in Bangladesh.
