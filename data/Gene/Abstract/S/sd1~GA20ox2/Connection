DLT|OsGRAS-32|D62|GS6|SMOS2	sd1|GA20ox2	Identification and characterization of dwarf 62, a loss-of-function mutation in DLT/OsGRAS-32 affecting gibberellin metabolism in rice	The expression levels of gibberellin (GA) biosynthetic genes including OsCPS1, OsKS1, OsKO1, OsKAO, OsGA20ox2/SD1 and OsGA2ox3 were significantly increased in d62 mutant
OsKOS4|OsKO1	sd1|GA20ox2	Identification and characterization of dwarf 62, a loss-of-function mutation in DLT/OsGRAS-32 affecting gibberellin metabolism in rice	The expression levels of gibberellin (GA) biosynthetic genes including OsCPS1, OsKS1, OsKO1, OsKAO, OsGA20ox2/SD1 and OsGA2ox3 were significantly increased in d62 mutant
OsCPS|OsCPS1	sd1|GA20ox2	Identification and characterization of dwarf 62, a loss-of-function mutation in DLT/OsGRAS-32 affecting gibberellin metabolism in rice	The expression levels of gibberellin (GA) biosynthetic genes including OsCPS1, OsKS1, OsKO1, OsKAO, OsGA20ox2/SD1 and OsGA2ox3 were significantly increased in d62 mutant
OsKS1	sd1|GA20ox2	Identification and characterization of dwarf 62, a loss-of-function mutation in DLT/OsGRAS-32 affecting gibberellin metabolism in rice	The expression levels of gibberellin (GA) biosynthetic genes including OsCPS1, OsKS1, OsKO1, OsKAO, OsGA20ox2/SD1 and OsGA2ox3 were significantly increased in d62 mutant
OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	sd1|GA20ox2	A role of OsGA20ox1 , encoding an isoform of gibberellin 20-oxidase, for regulation of plant stature in rice	This result indicates that not only OsGA20ox2 but also OsGA20ox1 affects plant stature
OsSPY	sd1|GA20ox2	The rice SPINDLY gene functions as a negative regulator of gibberellin signaling by controlling the suppressive function of the DELLA protein, SLR1, and modulating brassinosteroid synthesis	The suppressive function of OsSPY in GA signaling was supported by the findings that the dwarfism was partially rescued and OsGA20ox2 (GA20 oxidase) expression was reduced in GA-deficient and GA-insensitive mutants by the knockdown of OsSPY function
OsGSR1|GW6|OsGASR7	sd1|GA20ox2	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice	Furthermore, OsGSR1 RNAi plants show a reduced sensitivity to GA treatment, an increased expression of the GA biosynthetic gene OsGA20ox2, which is feedback inhibited by GA signaling, and an elevated level of endogenous GA: together, these suggest that OsGSR1 is a positive regulator of GA signaling
d18|OsGA3ox2	sd1|GA20ox2	The rice YABBY1 gene is involved in the feedback regulation of gibberellin metabolism	In this report, we show that a rice (Oryza sativa) YABBY1 (YAB1) gene had a similar expression pattern as key rice GA biosynthetic genes GA3ox2 and GA20ox2
OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	sd1|GA20ox2	The rice YABBY1 gene is involved in the feedback regulation of gibberellin metabolism	In this report, we show that a rice (Oryza sativa) YABBY1 (YAB1) gene had a similar expression pattern as key rice GA biosynthetic genes GA3ox2 and GA20ox2
sd1|GA20ox2	SDT	Regulation of OsmiR156h through Alternative Polyadenylation Improves Grain Yield in Rice.	Most importantly, pyramiding of the sdt allele and the green revolution gene sd1 enhances grain yield by about 20% in hybrid rice breeding
OsYABBY4	sd1|GA20ox2	The rice YABBY4 gene regulates plant growth and development through modulating the gibberellin pathway.	We report on an important role for OsYABBY4 in negative control of the expression of a GA biosynthetic gene by binding to the promoter region of the gibberellin 20-oxidase 2 gene (GA20ox2), which is a direct target of SLR1 (the sole DELLA protein negatively controlling GA responses in rice)
HTD1|OsCCD7|D17	sd1|GA20ox2	A Strigolactone Biosynthesis Gene Contributed to the Green Revolution in Rice.	 We found that the HTD1 gene had been widely utilized and co-selected with Semidwarf 1 (SD1), both contributing to the improvement of plant architecture in modern rice varieties since the Green Revolution in the 1960s
OsZFP7|ZFP207	sd1|GA20ox2	A Cys2/His2 zinc finger protein acts as a repressor of green revolution gene SD1/OsGA20ox2 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Moreover, ZFP207 repressed the expression of OsGA20ox2 via binding to its promoter region.
