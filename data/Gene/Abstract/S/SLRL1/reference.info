SLR1 (SLENDER RICE 1) was thought to be the sole DELLA protein in rice considering the constitutive GA response phenotype of slr1 mutants. There were two other SLR1 homologous SLRL1 and SLRL2 (SLR1 like 1 and 2) which did not have DELLA domain but still shared high level similarity to the C-terminal region of SLR1 found after searching the whole rice genome. SLRL2 specially expressed in the embryo of immature rice seeds and the expression of SLRL2 was increased when treated with GA(3). The SLRL2 over-expressed transgenic Arabidopsis plants were semi-dwarfed, late flowering, and insensitive to GA. Moreover, the expression of AtGA20ox1 and AtGA3ox1 was increased and the expression of AtGA2ox1 decreased, indicating SLRL2 was a repressor of GA signaling. We suggested SLRL2 might function to overcome too strong GA responses and maintained a basic repression. Furthermore, a different form of DELLA family in monocots against dicots was discussed.
Fukao-2008-Submergence toleranc.pdf	Submergence tolerance conferred by Sub1A is mediated by SLR1 and SLRL1 restriction of gibberellin responses in rice	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, Center for Plant Cell Biology, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA.	Submergence-tolerant rice maintains viability during complete submergence by limiting underwater elongation until floodwaters recede. Acclimation responses to submergence are coordinated by the submergence-inducible Sub1A, which encodes an ethylene-responsive factor-type transcription factor (ERF). Sub1A is limited to tolerant genotypes and sufficient to confer submergence tolerance to intolerant accessions. Here we evaluated the role of Sub1A in the integration of ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA), and gibberellin (GA) signaling during submergence. The submergence-stimulated decrease in ABA content was Sub1A-independent, whereas GA-mediated underwater elongation was significantly restricted by Sub1A. Transgenics that ectopically express Sub1A displayed classical GA-insensitive phenotypes, leading to the hypothesis that Sub1A limits the response to GA. Notably Sub1A increased the accumulation of the GA signaling repressors Slender Rice-1 (SLR1) and SLR1 Like-1 (SLRL1) and concomitantly diminished GA-inducible gene expression under submerged conditions. In the Sub1A overexpression line, SLR1 protein levels declined under prolonged submergence but were accompanied by an increase in accumulation of SLRL1, which lacks the DELLA domain. In the presence of Sub1A, the increase in these GA signaling repressors and decrease in GA responsiveness were stimulated by ethylene, which promotes Sub1A expression. Conversely, ethylene promoted GA responsiveness and shoot elongation in submergence-intolerant lines. Together, these results demonstrate that Sub1A limits ethylene-promoted GA responsiveness during submergence by augmenting accumulation of the GA signaling repressors SLR1 and SLRL1.
Hirano-2008-Comprehensive transc.pdf	Comprehensive transcriptome analysis of phytohormone biosynthesis and signaling genes in microspore/pollen and tapetum of rice	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, 464-8601 Japan.	To investigate the involvement of phytohormones during rice microspore/pollen (MS/POL) development, endogenous levels of IAA, gibberellins (GAs), cytokinins (CKs) and abscisic acid (ABA) in the mature anther were analyzed. We also analyzed the global expression profiles of genes related to seven phytohormones, namely auxin, GAs, CKs, brassinosteroids, ethylene, ABA and jasmonic acids, in MS/POL and tapetum (TAP) using a 44K microarray combined with a laser microdissection technique (LM-array analysis). IAA and GA(4) accumulated in a much higher amount in the mature anther compared with the other tissues, while CKs and ABA did not. LM-array analysis revealed that sets of genes required for IAA and GA synthesis were coordinately expressed during the later stages of MS/POL development, suggesting that these genes are responsible for the massive accumulation of IAA and GA(4) in the mature anther. In contrast, genes for GA signaling were preferentially expressed during the early developmental stages of MS/POL and throughout TAP development, while their expression was down-regulated at the later stages of MS/POL development. In the case of auxin signaling genes, such mirror-imaged expression observed in GA synthesis and signaling genes was not observed. IAA receptor genes were mostly expressed during the late stages of MS/POL development, and various sets of AUX/IAA and ARF genes were expressed during the different stages of MS/POL or TAP development. Such cell type-specific expression profiles of phytohormone biosynthesis and signaling genes demonstrate the validity and importance of analyzing the expression of phytohormone-related genes in individual cell types independently of other cells/tissues.
Itoh-2005-Overexpression of a.pdf	Overexpression of a GRAS protein lacking the DELLA domain confers altered gibberellin responses in rice	2005	Plant J	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya, Aichi 464-8601, Japan.	The rice SLR1 (SLENDER RICE 1) gene encodes a DELLA protein that belongs to a subfamily of the GRAS protein superfamily and that functions as a repressor of gibberellin (GA) signaling. Based on the constitutive GA response phenotype of slr1 mutants, SLR1 has been thought to be the sole DELLA-type protein suppressing GA signals in rice. However, in rice genome databases we identified two sequences homologous to SLR1: SLR1-like1 and -2 (SLRL1 and -2). SLRL1 and SLRL2 contain regions with high similarity to the C-terminal conserved domains in SLR1, but lack the N-terminal conserved region of the DELLA proteins. The expression of SLRL1 was positively regulated by GA at the mRNA level and occurred preferentially in reproductive organs, whereas SLRL2 was moderately expressed in mature leaf organs and was not affected by GA. Transformation of SLRL1 into the slr1 mutant rescued the slender phenotype of this mutant. Moreover, overexpression of SLRL1 in normal rice plants induced a dwarf phenotype with an increased level of OsGA20ox2 gene expression and diminished the GA-induced shoot elongation, suggesting that SLRL1 acts as a repressor of GA signaling. Consistent with the fact that SLRL1 does not have a DELLA domain, which is essential for degradation of DELLA proteins, a level of SLRL1 protein was not degraded by application of gibberellic acid. However, the repressive activity of SLRL1 against GA signaling was much weaker than a truncated SLR1 lacking the DELLA domain. Based on these characteristics of SLRL1, the functional roles of SLRL1 in GA signaling in rice are discussed.
