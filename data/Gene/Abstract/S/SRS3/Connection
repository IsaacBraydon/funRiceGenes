D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	SRS3|OsKINESIN-13A|BHS1	The kinesin-13 protein BR HYPERSENSITIVE 1 is a negative brassinosteroid signaling component regulating rice growth and development.	 Furthermore, we found that the BR-induced degradation of BHS1 was attenuated in Osbri1 and Osbak1 mutants, but not in Osbzr1 and Oslic mutants
