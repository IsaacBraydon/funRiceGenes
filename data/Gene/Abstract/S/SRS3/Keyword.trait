SRS3	grain	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	 Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants
SRS3	seed	A novel kinesin 13 protein regulating rice seed length	The causal gene of a novel small and round seed mutant phenotype (srs3) in rice was identified by map-based cloning and named the SRS3 gene| Using scanning electron microscopy, we determined that the cell length of seeds in the longitudinal direction in srs3 is shorter than that in the wild type| The number of cells of seeds in the longitudinal direction in srs3 was not very different from that in the wild type| The result suggests that the small and round seed phenotype of srs3 is due to a reduction in cell length of seeds in the longitudinal direction
