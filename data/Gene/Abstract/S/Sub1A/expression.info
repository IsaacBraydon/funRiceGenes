Sub1A	 Furthermore, the tolerant allele SUB1A1 binds to the MPK3 promoter and regulates its expression in a positive regulatory loop during submergence stress signalling
Sub1A	Allelic variants of OsSUB1A cause differential expression of transcription factor genes in response to submergence in rice. |  As a first step, we have therefore quantified and compared the expression of nearly 2500 rice TF genes between IR64 and its derived tolerant near isogenic line IR64-Sub1, which carries the SUB1A-1 allele
