Sub1A	Sub1C	Development of submergence-tolerant rice cultivars: the Sub1 locus and beyond	The objectives of this study were to (a) develop mega varieties with Sub1 introgression that are submergence tolerant, (b) assess the performance of Sub1 in different genetic backgrounds, (c) determine the roles of the Sub1A and Sub1C genes in conferring tolerance, and (d) assess the level of tolerance in F(1) hybrids heterozygous for the Sub1A-1-tolerant allele
Sub1A	Sub1C	Development of submergence-tolerant rice cultivars: the Sub1 locus and beyond	The roles of Sub1A and Sub1C in conferring the tolerant phenotype were further investigated using recombinants identified within the Sub1 gene cluster based on survival and gene expression data
Sub1A	Sub1C	Development of submergence-tolerant rice cultivars: the Sub1 locus and beyond	An intolerant Sub1C allele combined with the tolerant Sub1A-1 allele did not significantly reduce the level of tolerance, and the Sub1C-1 expression appeared to be independent of the Sub1A allele; however, even when Sub1C-1 expression is completely turned off in the presence of Sub1A-2, plants remained intolerant
Sub1A	Sub1C	Development of submergence-tolerant rice cultivars: the Sub1 locus and beyond	Sub1A is confirmed as the primary contributor to tolerance, while Sub1C alleles do not seem important
SLR1|OsGAI|OsSLR1	Sub1A	Submergence tolerance conferred by Sub1A is mediated by SLR1 and SLRL1 restriction of gibberellin responses in rice	Notably Sub1A increased the accumulation of the GA signaling repressors Slender Rice-1 (SLR1) and SLR1 Like-1 (SLRL1) and concomitantly diminished GA-inducible gene expression under submerged conditions
SLR1|OsGAI|OsSLR1	Sub1A	Submergence tolerance conferred by Sub1A is mediated by SLR1 and SLRL1 restriction of gibberellin responses in rice	In the Sub1A overexpression line, SLR1 protein levels declined under prolonged submergence but were accompanied by an increase in accumulation of SLRL1, which lacks the DELLA domain
SLR1|OsGAI|OsSLR1	Sub1A	Submergence tolerance conferred by Sub1A is mediated by SLR1 and SLRL1 restriction of gibberellin responses in rice	Together, these results demonstrate that Sub1A limits ethylene-promoted GA responsiveness during submergence by augmenting accumulation of the GA signaling repressors SLR1 and SLRL1

Sub1A	Sub1C	Expression of rice SUB1A and SUB1C transcription factors in Arabidopsis uncovers flowering inhibition as a submergence tolerance mechanism	In this study, heterologous ectopic expression of rice SUB1A and SUB1C in Arabidopsis thaliana was used to explore conserved mechanisms of action associated with these genes using developmental, physiological and molecular metrics

OsCIPK15	Sub1A	Regulatory interplay of the Sub1A and CIPK15 pathways in the regulation of alpha-amylase production in flooded rice plants	It is still unknown whether the Sub1A- and CIPK15-mediated pathways act as complementary processes for rice survival under O(2) deprivation
OsCIPK15	Sub1A	Regulatory interplay of the Sub1A and CIPK15 pathways in the regulation of alpha-amylase production in flooded rice plants	In adult plants Sub1A and CIPK15 may perhaps play an antagonistic role in terms of carbohydrate consumption, with Sub1A acting as a starch degradation repressor and CIPK15 as an activator
OsCIPK15	Sub1A	Regulatory interplay of the Sub1A and CIPK15 pathways in the regulation of alpha-amylase production in flooded rice plants	The relation between the Sub1A and the CIPK15 pathways was investigated
OsCIPK15	Sub1A	Regulatory interplay of the Sub1A and CIPK15 pathways in the regulation of alpha-amylase production in flooded rice plants	The results show that under O(2) deprivation, the CIPK15 pathway is repressed in the tolerant, Sub1A-containing, FR13A variety
OsCIPK15	Sub1A	Regulatory interplay of the Sub1A and CIPK15 pathways in the regulation of alpha-amylase production in flooded rice plants	CIPK15 is likely to play a role in the up-regulation of Ramy3D in flooding-intolerant rice varieties that display fast elongation under flooding and that do not possess Sub1A

OsTPP7|AG1	Sub1A	Flood resilience loci SUBMERGENCE 1 and ANAEROBIC GERMINATION 1 interact in seedlings established underwater	To better understand the roles of TPP7 and SUB1A-1 and their interaction, temporal changes in carbohydrates and shoot transcriptomes were monitored in the four genotypes varying at the two loci at four developmental timeponts, from day 2 after seeding through day 14 of complete submergence.
OsTPP7|AG1	Sub1A	Flood resilience loci SUBMERGENCE 1 and ANAEROBIC GERMINATION 1 interact in seedlings established underwater	These results suggest that interactions between AG1/TPP7 and SUB1/SUB1A-1 could impact seedling establishment if paddy depth is not effectively managed after direct seeding.
