SPIN1	SPL11	RBS1, an RNA Binding Protein, Interacts with SPIN1 and Is Involved in Flowering Time Control in Rice	The rice U-box/ARM E3 ubiquitin ligase SPL11 negatively regulates programmed cell death (PCD) and disease resistance, and controls flowering time through interacting with the novel RNA/DNA binding KH domain protein SPIN1| Rbs1 is upregulated in both Spin1 overexpression plants and in the spl11 mutant| Interestingly, Spin1 expression is increased but Spl11 expression is repressed in the Rbs1 overexpression plants| These results suggest that RBS1 is a new negative regulator of flowering time that itself is positively regulated by SPIN1 but negatively regulated by SPL11 in rice

SPL11	Spl7	Regulatory mechanisms of ROI generation are affected by rice spl mutations	 We found that spl2, spl7 and spl11 mutant cells accumulated increased amounts of H(2)O(2) in response to rice blast fungal elicitor| These results suggest that the spl2, spl7 and spl11 mutants are defective in the regulation of NADPH oxidase, and the spl7 mutation may give rise to enhancement of the signaling pathway which protein dephosphorylation controls, while the spl2 mutation affects both the pathogen-induced and wound-induced signaling pathways
SPIN1	SPL11	SPIN1, a K homology domain protein negatively regulated and ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase SPL11, is involved in flowering time control in rice	 We demonstrate here that SPL11 also regulates flowering via interaction with SPIN1 (for SPL11-interacting protein1), a Signal Transduction and Activation of RNA family member| SPIN1 binds RNA and DNA in vitro and interacts with SPL11 in the nucleus| Both Spin1 and Spl11 are regulated diurnally in opposing phases| SPL11 negatively regulates Spin1 transcript levels, while SPIN1 also affects Spl11 expression| SPIN1 is monoubiquitinated by SPL11, suggesting that it is not targeted for degradation| Our data are consistent with a model in which SPIN1 acts as a negative regulator of flowering that itself is negatively regulated by SPL11, possibly via ubiquitination|SPIN1, a K homology domain protein negatively regulated and ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase SPL11, is involved in flowering time control in rice
