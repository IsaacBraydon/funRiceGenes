OsDCL1a	SHO1|OsDCL4	Roles of DCL4 and DCL3b in rice phased small RNA biogenesis	Our results revealed significant roles of OsDCL4, OsDCL3b and OsDCL1 in the 21- and 24-nucleotide phased small RNA biogenesis pathway in rice
OsDCL3b	SHO1|OsDCL4	Roles of DCL4 and DCL3b in rice phased small RNA biogenesis	Our results revealed significant roles of OsDCL4, OsDCL3b and OsDCL1 in the 21- and 24-nucleotide phased small RNA biogenesis pathway in rice

OsAGO7|shl4|SHO2	SHO1|OsDCL4	Shoot organization genes regulate shoot apical meristem organization and the pattern of leaf primordium initiation in rice	The mechanism regulating the pattern of leaf initiation was analyzed by using shoot organization (sho) mutants derived from three loci (SHO1, SHO2, and SHO3)
OsDCL1a	SHO1|OsDCL4	Loss of function of OsDCL1 affects microRNA accumulation and causes developmental defects in rice	An RNA interference approach was applied to knock down two OsDCLs, OsDCL1 and OsDCL4, respectively
OsDCL1a	SHO1|OsDCL4	Loss of function of OsDCL1 affects microRNA accumulation and causes developmental defects in rice	Moreover, all miRNAs tested were greatly reduced in OsDCL1IR but not OsDCL4IR transformants, indicating that OsDCL1 plays a critical role in miRNA processing in rice
OsDCL1a	SHO1|OsDCL4	Loss of function of OsDCL1 affects microRNA accumulation and causes developmental defects in rice	In contrast, the production of siRNA from transgenic inverted repeats and endogenous CentO regions were not affected in either OsDCL1IR or OsDCL4IR transformants, suggesting that the production of miRNAs and siRNAs is via distinct OsDCLs
OsAGO7|shl4|SHO2	SHO1|OsDCL4	The small interfering RNA production pathway is required for shoot meristem initiation in rice	Mutations in rice SHOOTLESS2 (SHL2), SHL4/SHOOT ORGANIZATION2 (SHO2), and SHO1 cause complete deletion or abnormal formation of the SAM
OsAGO7|shl4|SHO2	SHO1|OsDCL4	The small interfering RNA production pathway is required for shoot meristem initiation in rice	Rice SHL2, SHL4/SHO2, and SHO1 encoded orthologues of Arabidopsis RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6, ARGONAUTE (AGO) 7, and DICER-like 4, respectively, whose mutations affect leaf development through the trans-acting siRNA (ta-siRNA) pathway
SHO1|OsDCL4	WAF1|OsHEN1	DCL2 is highly expressed in the egg cell in both rice and Arabidopsis	In this article, we show that OsDCL2, OsDCL4, and OsHEN1 are preferentially expressed in the egg cell
