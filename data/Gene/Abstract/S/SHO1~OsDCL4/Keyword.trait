SHO1|OsDCL4	leaf development	The small interfering RNA production pathway is required for shoot meristem initiation in rice	 Rice SHL2, SHL4/SHO2, and SHO1 encoded orthologues of Arabidopsis RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6, ARGONAUTE (AGO) 7, and DICER-like 4, respectively, whose mutations affect leaf development through the trans-acting siRNA (ta-siRNA) pathway
SHO1|OsDCL4	shoot	Shoot organization genes regulate shoot apical meristem organization and the pattern of leaf primordium initiation in rice	The mechanism regulating the pattern of leaf initiation was analyzed by using shoot organization (sho) mutants derived from three loci (SHO1, SHO2, and SHO3)
SHO1|OsDCL4	shoot	The small interfering RNA production pathway is required for shoot meristem initiation in rice	 Mutations in rice SHOOTLESS2 (SHL2), SHL4/SHOOT ORGANIZATION2 (SHO2), and SHO1 cause complete deletion or abnormal formation of the SAM
