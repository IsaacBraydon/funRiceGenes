NA	Beyond gene ontology (GO): using biocuration approach to improve the gene nomenclature and functional annotation of rice S-domain kinase subfamily.	2021	PeerJ	Botany and Plant Pathology, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA.	The S-domain subfamily of receptor-like kinases (SDRLKs) in plants is poorly characterized. Most members of this subfamily are currently assigned gene function based on the S-locus Receptor Kinase from Brassica that acts as the female determinant of self-incompatibility (SI). However, Brassica like SI mechanisms does not exist in most plants. Thus, automated Gene Ontology (GO) pipelines are not sufficient for functional annotation of SDRLK subfamily members and lead to erroneous association with the GO biological process of SI. Here, we show that manual bio-curation can help to correct and improve the gene annotations and association with relevant biological processes. Using publicly available genomic and transcriptome datasets, we conducted a detailed analysis of the expansion of the rice (Oryza sativa) SDRLK subfamily, the structure of individual genes and proteins, and their expression.The 144-member SDRLK family in rice consists of 82 receptor-like kinases (RLKs) (67 full-length, 15 truncated),12 receptor-like proteins, 14 SD kinases, 26 kinase-like and 10 GnK2 domain-containing kinases and RLKs. Except for nine genes, all other SDRLK family members are transcribed in rice, but they vary in their tissue-specific and stress-response expression profiles. Furthermore, 98 genes show differential expression under biotic stress and 98 genes show differential expression under abiotic stress conditions, but share 81 genes in common.Our analysis led to the identification of candidate genes likely to play important roles in plant development, pathogen resistance, and abiotic stress tolerance. We propose a nomenclature for 144 SDRLK gene family members based on gene/protein conserved structural features, gene expression profiles, and literature review. Our biocuration approach, rooted in the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability, sets forth an example of how manual annotation of large-gene families can fill in the knowledge gap that exists due to the implementation of automated GO projections, thereby helping to improve the quality and contents of public databases.
NA	PWL1, a G-type lectin receptor-like kinase, positively regulates leaf senescence and heat tolerance but negatively regulates resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice.	2023	Plant Biotechnol J	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Plant leaf senescence, caused by multiple internal and environmental factors, has an important impact on agricultural production. The lectin receptor-like kinase (LecRLK) family members participate in plant development and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, but their roles in regulating leaf senescence remain elusive. Here, we identify and characterize a rice premature withered leaf 1 (pwl1) mutant, which exhibits premature leaf senescence throughout the plant life cycle. The pwl1 mutant displayed withered and whitish leaf tips, decreased chlorophyll content, and accelerated chloroplast degradation. Map-based cloning revealed an amino acid substitution (Gly412Arg) in LOC_Os03g62180 (PWL1) was responsible for the phenotypes of pwl1. The expression of PWL1 was detected in all tissues, but predominantly in tillering and mature leaves. PWL1 encodes a G-type LecRLK with active kinase and autophosphorylation activities. PWL1 is localized to the plasma membrane and can self-associate, mainly mediated by the plasminogen-apple-nematode (PAN) domain. Substitution of the PAN domain significantly diminished the self-interaction of PWL1. Moreover, the pwl1 mutant showed enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, cell death, and severe DNA fragmentation. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that PWL1 was involved in the regulation of multiple biological processes, like carbon metabolism, ribosome, and peroxisome pathways. Meanwhile, interfering of biological processes induced by the PWL1 mutation also enhanced heat sensitivity and resistance to bacterial blight and bacterial leaf streak with excessive accumulation of ROS and impaired chloroplast development in rice. Natural variation analysis indicated more variations in indica varieties, and the vast majority of japonica varieties harbour the PWL1(Hap1) allele. Together, our results suggest that PWL1, a member of LecRLKs, exerts multiple roles in regulating plant growth and development, heat-tolerance, and resistance to bacterial pathogens.
