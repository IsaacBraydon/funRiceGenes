SaF	SaM	Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes	Here we show that a locus for indica-japonica hybrid male sterility, Sa, comprises two adjacent genes, SaM and SaF, encoding a small ubiquitin-like modifier E3 ligase-like protein and an F-box protein, respectively
SaF	SaM	Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes	Most indica cultivars contain a haplotype SaM(+)SaF(+), whereas all japonica cultivars have SaM(-)SaF(-) that diverged by nucleotide variations in wild rice
SaF	SaM	Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes	This allele-specific gamete elimination results from a selective interaction of SaF(+) with SaM(-), a truncated protein, but not with SaM(+) because of the presence of an inhibitory domain, although SaM(+) is required for this male sterility
SaF	SaM	Suppression or knockout of SaF/SaM overcomes the Sa-mediated hybrid male sterility in rice.	 The complex locus Sa comprises two adjacently located genes, SaF and SaM, which interact to cause abortion of pollen grains carrying the japonica allele in japonica-indica hybrids
SaF	SaM	Suppression or knockout of SaF/SaM overcomes the Sa-mediated hybrid male sterility in rice.	 Here we showed that silencing of SaF or SaM by RNA interference restored male fertility in indica-japonica hybrids with heterozygous Sa
SaF	SaM	Suppression or knockout of SaF/SaM overcomes the Sa-mediated hybrid male sterility in rice.	 We further used CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing to knockout the SaF and SaM alleles respectively of an indica rice line to create hybrid-compatible lines
SaF	SaM	Suppression or knockout of SaF/SaM overcomes the Sa-mediated hybrid male sterility in rice.	 Our results firmly proved that SaF and SaM are required for the hybrid male sterility, but are not essential for pollen development
