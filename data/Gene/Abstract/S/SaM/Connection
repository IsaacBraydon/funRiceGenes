SaF	SaM	Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes	Here we show that a locus for indica-japonica hybrid male sterility, Sa, comprises two adjacent genes, SaM and SaF, encoding a small ubiquitin-like modifier E3 ligase-like protein and an F-box protein, respectively
SaF	SaM	Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes	Most indica cultivars contain a haplotype SaM(+)SaF(+), whereas all japonica cultivars have SaM(-)SaF(-) that diverged by nucleotide variations in wild rice
SaF	SaM	Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes	This allele-specific gamete elimination results from a selective interaction of SaF(+) with SaM(-), a truncated protein, but not with SaM(+) because of the presence of an inhibitory domain, although SaM(+) is required for this male sterility
LBD12-1	SaM	The LBD12-1 transcription factor suppresses apical meristem size by repressing Argonaute 10 expression.	In this research we showed that transgenic rice plants overexpressing LBD12-1, an LBD family transcription factor, exhibited stunted growth, twisted leaves, abnormal anthers, and reduced SAM size
LBD12-1	SaM	The LBD12-1 transcription factor suppresses apical meristem size by repressing Argonaute 10 expression.	lbd12-1 loss-of-function mutants showed similar phenotypes and SAM size to WT under normal conditions, but lbd12-1 had a larger SAM under salt stress
OsARID3	SaM	OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.	 Herein we demonstrate that OsARID3, a member of the rice (Oryza sativa) AT-rich Interaction Domain (ARID) family, is required for SAM development
OsARID3	SaM	OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.	 Disruption of OsARID3 leads to a defective SAM, early seedling lethality, and impaired capacity of in<U+00A0>vitro shoot regeneration
OsARID3	SaM	OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.	 We conclude that OsARID3 is an AT-rich specific DNA-binding protein and that it plays a major role in SAM development in rice
