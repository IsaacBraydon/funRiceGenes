SaF	SaM	Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes	Here we show that a locus for indica-japonica hybrid male sterility, Sa, comprises two adjacent genes, SaM and SaF, encoding a small ubiquitin-like modifier E3 ligase-like protein and an F-box protein, respectively
SaF	SaM	Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes	Most indica cultivars contain a haplotype SaM(+)SaF(+), whereas all japonica cultivars have SaM(-)SaF(-) that diverged by nucleotide variations in wild rice
SaF	SaM	Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes	This allele-specific gamete elimination results from a selective interaction of SaF(+) with SaM(-), a truncated protein, but not with SaM(+) because of the presence of an inhibitory domain, although SaM(+) is required for this male sterility
OsFTIP1	SaM	OsFTIP1-Mediated Regulation of Florigen Transport in Rice Is Negatively Regulated by a Ubiquitin-like Domain Kinase OsUbDK¦Ã4.	 We further reveal that a ubiquitin-like domain kinase ¦Ã4, OsUbDK¦Ã4, interacts with OsFTIP1, and modulates its degradation in leaves through the 26S proteasome, which in turn affects RFT1 transport to the SAM
