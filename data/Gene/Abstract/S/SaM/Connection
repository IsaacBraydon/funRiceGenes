SaF	SaM	Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes	Here we show that a locus for indica-japonica hybrid male sterility, Sa, comprises two adjacent genes, SaM and SaF, encoding a small ubiquitin-like modifier E3 ligase-like protein and an F-box protein, respectively
SaF	SaM	Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes	Most indica cultivars contain a haplotype SaM(+)SaF(+), whereas all japonica cultivars have SaM(-)SaF(-) that diverged by nucleotide variations in wild rice
SaF	SaM	Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes	This allele-specific gamete elimination results from a selective interaction of SaF(+) with SaM(-), a truncated protein, but not with SaM(+) because of the presence of an inhibitory domain, although SaM(+) is required for this male sterility
SaF	SaM	Suppression or knockout of SaF/SaM overcomes the Sa-mediated hybrid male sterility in rice.	 The complex locus Sa comprises two adjacently located genes, SaF and SaM, which interact to cause abortion of pollen grains carrying the japonica allele in japonica-indica hybrids
SaF	SaM	Suppression or knockout of SaF/SaM overcomes the Sa-mediated hybrid male sterility in rice.	 Here we showed that silencing of SaF or SaM by RNA interference restored male fertility in indica-japonica hybrids with heterozygous Sa
SaF	SaM	Suppression or knockout of SaF/SaM overcomes the Sa-mediated hybrid male sterility in rice.	 We further used CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing to knockout the SaF and SaM alleles respectively of an indica rice line to create hybrid-compatible lines
SaF	SaM	Suppression or knockout of SaF/SaM overcomes the Sa-mediated hybrid male sterility in rice.	 Our results firmly proved that SaF and SaM are required for the hybrid male sterility, but are not essential for pollen development
OsFH15	SaM	OsFH15, a class I formin, interacts with microfilaments and microtubules to regulate grain size via affecting cell expansion in rice.	 OsFH15 was mainly expressed in shoot apical meristem (SAM), spikelets, spikelet hulls and seeds in rice
OsFD1	SaM	Antagonistic Transcription Factor Complexes Modulate the Floral Transition in Rice.	 In the SAM, they form a transcriptional activation complex with the bZIP transcription factor OsFD1, to start panicle development
RFT1	SaM	Overexpression of RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1) Induces Extremely Early Flowering in Rice.	RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1) is a major florigen that functions to induce reproductive development in the shoot apical meristem (SAM)
MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	SaM	TILLERS ABSENT1, the WUSCHEL ortholog, is not involved in stem cell maintenance in the shoot apical meristem in rice.	 We previously showed that, in rice (Oryza sativa), the WUS ortholog TILLERS ABSENT1 (TAB1, also known as OsWUS) has no function in SAM maintenance, whereas it plays a crucial role in axillary meristem development
MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	SaM	TILLERS ABSENT1, the WUSCHEL ortholog, is not involved in stem cell maintenance in the shoot apical meristem in rice.	 In this paper, we confirmed that TAB1 is also unrelated to the enlargement of the SAM in the vegetative phase of the fon2 and fon2 asp1 mutants
MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	SaM	TILLERS ABSENT1, the WUSCHEL ortholog, is not involved in stem cell maintenance in the shoot apical meristem in rice.	 In addition, misexpression of TAB1 under the promoter of FON1 led to a slight reduction of the SAM size in wild type, suggesting that TAB1 is not a positive regulator of stem cells
MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	SaM	Antagonistic action of TILLERS ABSENT1 and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 regulates stem cell maintenance during axillary meristem development in rice.	 To elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying axillary meristem development in rice (Oryza sativa), we undertook a molecular genetic analysis focusing on TILLERS ABSENT1 (TAB1) and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2), respective orthologs of the WUSCHEL and CLAVATA3 genes involved in SAM maintenance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)
FON2|FON4|TG1	SaM	Antagonistic action of TILLERS ABSENT1 and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 regulates stem cell maintenance during axillary meristem development in rice.	 To elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying axillary meristem development in rice (Oryza sativa), we undertook a molecular genetic analysis focusing on TILLERS ABSENT1 (TAB1) and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2), respective orthologs of the WUSCHEL and CLAVATA3 genes involved in SAM maintenance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)
CUR1	SaM	CURLED LATER1 encoding the largest subunit of the Elongator complex has a unique role in leaf development and meristem function in rice 	 The shoot apical meristem (SAM) was small and the leaf initiation rate was low, suggesting that the activity of the SAM seemed to be partially reduced in cur1
