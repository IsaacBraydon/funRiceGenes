SaM	pollen	Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes	Male semi-sterility in this heterozygous complex locus is caused by abortion of pollen carrying SaM(-)
SaM	sterility	Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes	Here we show that a locus for indica-japonica hybrid male sterility, Sa, comprises two adjacent genes, SaM and SaF, encoding a small ubiquitin-like modifier E3 ligase-like protein and an F-box protein, respectively
SaM	sterility	Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes	Male semi-sterility in this heterozygous complex locus is caused by abortion of pollen carrying SaM(-)
SaM	sterility	Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes	This allele-specific gamete elimination results from a selective interaction of SaF(+) with SaM(-), a truncated protein, but not with SaM(+) because of the presence of an inhibitory domain, although SaM(+) is required for this male sterility
