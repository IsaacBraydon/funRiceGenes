STS1|OsLDDT1|OsSTS1	fertility	SWOLLEN TAPETUM AND STERILITY 1 Is Required for Tapetum Degeneration and Pollen Wall Formation in Rice.	 Collectively, our results indicate that STS1 is an important factor for lipid biosynthesis in reproduction, providing a target for the artificial control of male fertility in hybrid rice breeding and insight into the function of DUF726-containing protein in plants
STS1|OsLDDT1|OsSTS1	pollen	SWOLLEN TAPETUM AND STERILITY 1 Is Required for Tapetum Degeneration and Pollen Wall Formation in Rice.	 Moreover, STS1 interacts with Polyketide Synthase 2 (OsPKS2) and Acyl-CoA Synthetase 12 (OsACOS12), two enzymes crucial in lipidic sporopollenin biosynthesis in pollen wall formation, suggesting a potentially lipidic metabolon for sporopollenin biosynthesis in rice
STS1|OsLDDT1|OsSTS1	anther	SWOLLEN TAPETUM AND STERILITY 1 Is Required for Tapetum Degeneration and Pollen Wall Formation in Rice.	 Lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses showed that STS1 is involved in anther lipid homeostasis
STS1|OsLDDT1|OsSTS1	homeostasis	SWOLLEN TAPETUM AND STERILITY 1 Is Required for Tapetum Degeneration and Pollen Wall Formation in Rice.	 Lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses showed that STS1 is involved in anther lipid homeostasis
