NA	SWOLLEN TAPETUM AND STERILITY 1 Is Required for Tapetum Degeneration and Pollen Wall Formation in Rice.	2022	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.	The pollen wall is important for protecting the male gametophyte and for fertilization. The lipid components of the pollen wall are mainly synthesized and transported from the sporophytic tapetum. Although several factors related to lipid biosynthesis have been characterized, the molecular mechanisms underlying lipid biosynthesis during pollen development in rice (Oryza sativa L.) remain elusive. Here, we showed that mutation in the SWOLLEN TAPETUM AND STERILITY 1 (STS1) gene causes delayed tapetum degradation and aborted pollen wall formation in rice. STS1 encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized protein that contains domain of unknown function (DUF) 726 and exhibits lipase activity. Lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses showed that STS1 is involved in anther lipid homeostasis. Moreover, STS1 interacts with Polyketide Synthase 2 (OsPKS2) and Acyl-CoA Synthetase 12 (OsACOS12), two enzymes crucial in lipidic sporopollenin biosynthesis in pollen wall formation, suggesting a potentially lipidic metabolon for sporopollenin biosynthesis in rice. Collectively, our results indicate that STS1 is an important factor for lipid biosynthesis in reproduction, providing a target for the artificial control of male fertility in hybrid rice breeding and insight into the function of DUF726-containing protein in plants.
NA	OsLDDT1, encoding a transmembrane structural DUF726 family protein, is essential for tapetum degradation and pollen formation in rice.	2023	Plant Sci	Key Laboratory for Zhejiang Super Rice Research, Chinese National Center for Rice Improvement and Stat Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, HangZhou 311402, China.	Formation of the pollen wall, which is mainly composed of lipid substances secreted by tapetal cells, is important to ensure pollen development in rice. Although several regulatory factors related to lipid biosynthesis during pollen wall formation have been identified in rice, the molecular mechanisms controlling lipid biosynthesis are unclear. In this study, we isolated the male-sterile rice mutant oslddt1 (leaked and delayed degraded tapetum 1). oslddt1 plants show complete pollen abortion resulting from delayed degradation of the tapetum and blocked formation of Ubisch bodies and pollen walls. OsLDDT1 (LOC_Os03g02170) encodes a DUF726 containing protein of unknown function with highly conserved transmembrane and α/β Hydrolase domains. OsLDDT1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and the gene is highly expressed in rice panicles. Genes involved in regulating fatty acid synthesis and formation of sporopollenin and pollen exine during anther development showed significantly different expression patterns in oslddt1 plants. Interestingly, the wax and cutin contents in mature oslddt1-1 anthers were decreased by 74.07 % and 72.22 % compared to WT, indicating that OsLDDT1 is involved in fatty acid synthesis and affects formation of the anther epidermis. Our results provide as deeper understanding of the role of OsLDDT1 in regulating male sterility and also provide materials for hybrid rice breeding.
