SNORKEL1	gibberellin	The ethylene response factors SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 allow rice to adapt to deep water	The products of SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 then trigger remarkable internode elongation via gibberellin
SNORKEL1	ethylene	The ethylene response factors SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 allow rice to adapt to deep water	Here we show the molecular mechanism of deepwater response through the identification of the genes SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2, which trigger deepwater response by encoding ethylene response factors involved in ethylene signalling
SNORKEL1	ethylene	The ethylene response factors SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 allow rice to adapt to deep water	The ethylene response factors SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 allow rice to adapt to deep water
