SBDCP1	starch	Re-programming of gene expression in the CS8 rice line over-expressing ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase induces a suppressor of starch biosynthesis.	 Reciprocal immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays indicated an interaction between SBDCP1 and starch synthase IIIa (SSIIIa), which was down-regulated at the protein level in the CS8 line
SBDCP1	starch	Re-programming of gene expression in the CS8 rice line over-expressing ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase induces a suppressor of starch biosynthesis.	 Furthermore, binding by SBDCP1 inhibited SSIIIa starch polymerization activity in a non-competitive manner
SBDCP1	starch	Re-programming of gene expression in the CS8 rice line over-expressing ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase induces a suppressor of starch biosynthesis.	 Surprisingly, artificial microRNA gene suppression of SBDCP1 restored protein expression levels of SSIIIa in the CS8 line resulting in starch with lower amylose content and increased amylopectin chains with a higher degree of polymerization
SBDCP1	amylose content	Re-programming of gene expression in the CS8 rice line over-expressing ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase induces a suppressor of starch biosynthesis.	 Surprisingly, artificial microRNA gene suppression of SBDCP1 restored protein expression levels of SSIIIa in the CS8 line resulting in starch with lower amylose content and increased amylopectin chains with a higher degree of polymerization
