NA	Two dioxygenases, SLC1 and SLC2, play essential roles in shoot development of rice.	2019	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.	The critical functions of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (2OGD) for the metabolism of salicylic acid (SA) in plants have been demonstrated, yet, the role of 2OGD in SA biosynthesis is poorly understood. Here, we report that two dioxygenase-encoding genes, SLC1 (slender and crinklyleaf 1) and SLC2 (slender and crinklyleaf 2), play essential roles in shoot development and SA production in rice (Oryza sativa). Overexpression of SLC1 (SLC1-OE) or SLC2 (SLC2-OE) in rice produced bizarre infertile plants with slender and crinkly leaves. Disruption of SLC1 or SLC2 led to dwarf plants. Down-regulation of SLC1 and SLC2 at the same time in the SLC1-SLC2 RNAi lines resulted in a severe defect in early leaf development. Enhanced SA level in the SLC1-OE plants and decreased SA level in the slc1 and slc2 mutants were scored. Accordingly, altered expression level of a set of SA-related genes in plants of SLC1-OE, slc1 and slc2 mutants was observed. The results from exploring the putative interacting proteins for SLC1 indicated that, either the KNOX1- or ELK-domain of OSH1 (homeobox1) is sufficient for accomplishing the interaction between SLC1 and OSH1. Collectively, our data revealed the importance of SLC1 and SLC2 in the shoot development of rice.
