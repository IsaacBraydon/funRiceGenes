SLC2	 Overexpression of SLC1 (SLC1-OE) or SLC2 (SLC2-OE) in rice produced bizarre infertile plants with slender and crinkly leaves |  Accordingly, altered expression level of a set of SA-related genes in plants of SLC1-OE, slc1 and slc2 mutants was observed	 Overexpression of SLC1 (SLC1-OE) or SLC2 (SLC2-OE) in rice produced bizarre infertile plants with slender and crinkly leaves	 Down-regulation of SLC1 and SLC2 at the same time in the SLC1-SLC2 RNAi lines resulted in a severe defect in early leaf development
