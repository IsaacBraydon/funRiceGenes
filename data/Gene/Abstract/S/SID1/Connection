Ehd2|RID1	SID1	Suppressor of rid1 (SID1) shares common targets with RID1 on florigen genes to initiate floral transition in rice.	Suppressor of rid1 (SID1) shares common targets with RID1 on florigen genes to initiate floral transition in rice.
Ehd2|RID1	SID1	Suppressor of rid1 (SID1) shares common targets with RID1 on florigen genes to initiate floral transition in rice.	 Here, we identified a Suppressor of rid1 (SID1), which rescues the never-flowering phenotype of rid1
Ehd2|RID1	SID1	Suppressor of rid1 (SID1) shares common targets with RID1 on florigen genes to initiate floral transition in rice.	 Gain-of-function of SID1, OsIDD1, or OsIDD6 could restore the rid1 to flowering
Ehd2|RID1	SID1	Suppressor of rid1 (SID1) shares common targets with RID1 on florigen genes to initiate floral transition in rice.	 Further analyses showed SID1 and RID1 directly target the promoter regions of Hd3a and RFT1, two florigen genes in rice
Hd3a	SID1	Suppressor of rid1 (SID1) shares common targets with RID1 on florigen genes to initiate floral transition in rice.	 Further analyses showed SID1 and RID1 directly target the promoter regions of Hd3a and RFT1, two florigen genes in rice
RFT1	SID1	Suppressor of rid1 (SID1) shares common targets with RID1 on florigen genes to initiate floral transition in rice.	 Further analyses showed SID1 and RID1 directly target the promoter regions of Hd3a and RFT1, two florigen genes in rice
