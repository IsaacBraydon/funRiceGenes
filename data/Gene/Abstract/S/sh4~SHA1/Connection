qSH1|RIL1	sh4|SHA1|SG5	Selection on grain shattering genes and rates of rice domestication	Here, we studied nucleotide variation at the shattering loci, sh4 and qSH1, for cultivated rice, Oryza sativa ssp
sh4|SHA1|SG5	SHAT1	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	Genetic analyses revealed that the expression of SHAT1 in AZ was positively regulated by the trihelix transcription factor SH4
sh4|SHA1|SG5	SHAT1	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	Our results suggest a genetic model in which the persistent and concentrated expression of active SHAT1 and SH4 in the AZ during early spikelet developmental stages is required for conferring AZ identification
sh4|SHA1|SG5	SHAT1	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	qSH1 functioned downstream of SHAT1 and SH4, through maintaining SHAT1 and SH4 expression in AZ, thus promoting AZ differentiation
sh4|SHA1|SG5	SH5|RI	The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis	We also determined that two shattering-related genes, SHAT1 and Sh4, which are necessary for proper formation of an AZ, were induced by SH5.
BG1	sh4|SHA1|SG5	Short grain 5 controls grain length in rice by regulating cell expansion.	 Moreover, the expression levels of BG1, GS2, and DEP1 were reduced in sg5 plants, and dual-luciferase (LUC) assays showed that SG5 can bind to the BG1 gene promoter
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	sh4|SHA1|SG5	Short grain 5 controls grain length in rice by regulating cell expansion.	 Moreover, the expression levels of BG1, GS2, and DEP1 were reduced in sg5 plants, and dual-luciferase (LUC) assays showed that SG5 can bind to the BG1 gene promoter
GS2|OsGRF4|GL2|GLW2|LGS1	sh4|SHA1|SG5	Short grain 5 controls grain length in rice by regulating cell expansion.	 Moreover, the expression levels of BG1, GS2, and DEP1 were reduced in sg5 plants, and dual-luciferase (LUC) assays showed that SG5 can bind to the BG1 gene promoter
GS3	sh4|SHA1|SG5	Short grain 5 controls grain length in rice by regulating cell expansion.	 The effect of pyramiding sg5 and GS3 suggests that sg5 and GS3 regulate grain length independently
