sh4|SHA1	seed	Origin of seed shattering in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Here we show that the seed shattering is controlled by a single dominant gene, Shattering1 (SHA1), encoding a member of the trihelix family of plant-specific transcription factors| Our results demonstrate that the g237t mutation in SHA1 accounts for the elimination of seed shattering, and that all the domesticated rice cultivars harbor the mutant sha1 gene and therefore have lost the ability to shed their seeds at maturity
sh4|SHA1	transcription factor	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	 Genetic analyses revealed that the expression of SHAT1 in AZ was positively regulated by the trihelix transcription factor SH4
sh4|SHA1	domestication	Selection on grain shattering genes and rates of rice domestication	 The sh4 phylogeny together with the neutrality tests and coalescent simulations suggested that sh4 had a single origin and was fixed by artificial selection during the domestication of rice
sh4|SHA1	domestication	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	 SH4 (for grain shattering quantitative trait locus on chromosome 4) and qSH1 (for quantitative trait locus of seed shattering on chromosome 1) genes have been identified as required for reduced seed shattering during rice (Oryza sativa) domestication
sh4|SHA1	transcription factor	Origin of seed shattering in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Here we show that the seed shattering is controlled by a single dominant gene, Shattering1 (SHA1), encoding a member of the trihelix family of plant-specific transcription factors
sh4|SHA1	shattering	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	 SH4 (for grain shattering quantitative trait locus on chromosome 4) and qSH1 (for quantitative trait locus of seed shattering on chromosome 1) genes have been identified as required for reduced seed shattering during rice (Oryza sativa) domestication| We also identified a frameshift mutant of SH4 that completely eliminated AZs and showed nonshattering
sh4|SHA1	shattering	Selection on grain shattering genes and rates of rice domestication	 Here, we studied nucleotide variation at the shattering loci, sh4 and qSH1, for cultivated rice, Oryza sativa ssp| The nonshattering sh4 allele was fixed in all rice cultivars, with levels of sequence polymorphism significantly reduced in both indica and japonica cultivars relative to the wild progenitors| The slow fixation of the nonshattering phenotype observed at the archeological sites might be a result of relatively weak selection on mutations other than sh4 in early rice cultivation
sh4|SHA1	grain	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	 SH4 (for grain shattering quantitative trait locus on chromosome 4) and qSH1 (for quantitative trait locus of seed shattering on chromosome 1) genes have been identified as required for reduced seed shattering during rice (Oryza sativa) domestication
sh4|SHA1	seed	Molecular evolution of shattering loci in U.S. weedy rice	 We assessed allelic identity and diversity at the major shattering locus, sh4, in weedy rice; we find that all cultivated and weedy rice, regardless of population, share similar haplotypes at sh4, and all contain a single derived mutation associated with decreased seed shattering
sh4|SHA1	shattering	Origin of seed shattering in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Here we show that the seed shattering is controlled by a single dominant gene, Shattering1 (SHA1), encoding a member of the trihelix family of plant-specific transcription factors| Our results demonstrate that the g237t mutation in SHA1 accounts for the elimination of seed shattering, and that all the domesticated rice cultivars harbor the mutant sha1 gene and therefore have lost the ability to shed their seeds at maturity
sh4|SHA1	spikelet	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	 Our results suggest a genetic model in which the persistent and concentrated expression of active SHAT1 and SH4 in the AZ during early spikelet developmental stages is required for conferring AZ identification
sh4|SHA1	shattering	Molecular evolution of shattering loci in U.S. weedy rice	 We assessed allelic identity and diversity at the major shattering locus, sh4, in weedy rice; we find that all cultivated and weedy rice, regardless of population, share similar haplotypes at sh4, and all contain a single derived mutation associated with decreased seed shattering| The combination of a shared cultivar sh4 allele and a highly shattering phenotype, suggests that U
sh4|SHA1	seed	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	 SH4 (for grain shattering quantitative trait locus on chromosome 4) and qSH1 (for quantitative trait locus of seed shattering on chromosome 1) genes have been identified as required for reduced seed shattering during rice (Oryza sativa) domestication
