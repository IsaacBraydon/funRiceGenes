sh4|SHA1	spikelet	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	Our results suggest a genetic model in which the persistent and concentrated expression of active SHAT1 and SH4 in the AZ during early spikelet developmental stages is required for conferring AZ identification
