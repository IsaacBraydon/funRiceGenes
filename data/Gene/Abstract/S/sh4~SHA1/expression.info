sh4|SHA1	Multiple tissue-specific expression of rice seed-shattering gene SH4 regulated by its promoter pSH4. |  We isolated and ligated pSH4 to the Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, and transformed it into a japonica rice cultivar to determine the multiple expression pattern of SH4 |  Histochemical location and fluorescence analyses of GUS activity of transgenic plants indicated multiple tissue-specific expression of pSH4 in the seed-pedicel junction region of mature panicles (with highest level), stems, coleoptiles of germinated seeds, and scutella of mature seeds | The multiple tissue-specific expression pSH4 is categorized as a spatiotemporal promoter that drives the expression of the SH4 gene in different rice tissues, in addition to the seed-pedicel junction region
