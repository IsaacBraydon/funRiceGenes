NA	Small Grain and Dwarf 2, encoding an HD-Zip II family transcription factor, regulates plant development by modulating gibberellin biosynthesis in rice.	2019	Plant Sci	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, PR China.	Homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-Zip) proteins are transcription factors that regulate plant development. Bioactive gibberellin (GA) is a key endogenous hormone that participates in plant growth. However, the relationship between HD-Zip genes and modulation of GA biosynthesis in rice remains elusive. Here, we identified a rice mutant, designated as small grain and dwarf 2 (sgd2), which had reduced height and grain size compared with the wild type. Cytological observations indicated that the defective phenotype was mainly due to decreased cell length. Map-based cloning and complementation tests demonstrated that a 9 bp deletion in a homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-Zip) II family transcription factor was responsible for the sgd2 mutant phenotype. Expression of SGD2 was pronounced in developing panicles, and its protein was localized in nucleus. Luciferase reporter system and transactivation assays in yeast suggested that SGD2 functioned as a transcriptional repressor. High performance liquid chromatography assays showed that the endogenous GA1 level in the sgd2 mutant was dramatically decreased, and exogenous GA3 recovered the second leaf sheath to normal length. Results of qRT-PCR showed that the expression levels of genes positively regulating GA-biosynthesis were mostly down-regulated in the mutant. Our data identified the role of an HD-Zip transcription factor that affects rice plant development by modulating gibberellin biosynthesis.
NA	Regain flood adaptation in rice through a 14-3-3 protein OsGF14h.	2022	Nat Commun	Rice Research Institute, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, 110866, China. sunjian811119@syau.edu.cn.	Contemporary climatic stress seriously affects rice production. Unfortunately, long-term domestication and improvement modified the phytohormones network to achieve the production needs of cultivated rice, thus leading to a decrease in adaptation. Here, we identify a 14-3-3 protein-coding gene OsGF14h in weedy rice that confers anaerobic germination and anaerobic seedling development tolerance. OsGF14h acts as a signal switch to balance ABA signaling and GA biosynthesis by interacting with the transcription factors OsHOX3 and OsVP1, thereby boosting the seeding rate from 13.5% to 60.5% for anaerobic sensitive variety under flooded direct-seeded conditions. Meanwhile, OsGF14h co-inheritance with the Rc (red pericarp gene) promotes divergence between temperate japonica cultivated rice and temperate japonica weedy rice through artificial and natural selection. Our study retrieves a superior allele that has been lost during modern japonica rice improvement and provides a fine-tuning tool to improve flood adaptation for elite rice varieties.
