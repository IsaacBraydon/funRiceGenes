SGD2	leaf	Small Grain and Dwarf 2, encoding an HD-Zip II family transcription factor, regulates plant development by modulating gibberellin biosynthesis in rice.	 High performance liquid chromatography assays showed that the endogenous GA1 level in the sgd2 mutant was dramatically decreased, and exogenous GA3 recovered the second leaf sheath to normal length
SGD2	transcription factor	Small Grain and Dwarf 2, encoding an HD-Zip II family transcription factor, regulates plant development by modulating gibberellin biosynthesis in rice.	 Map-based cloning and complementation tests demonstrated that a 9 bp deletion in a homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-Zip) II family transcription factor was responsible for the sgd2 mutant phenotype
SGD2	sheath	Small Grain and Dwarf 2, encoding an HD-Zip II family transcription factor, regulates plant development by modulating gibberellin biosynthesis in rice.	 High performance liquid chromatography assays showed that the endogenous GA1 level in the sgd2 mutant was dramatically decreased, and exogenous GA3 recovered the second leaf sheath to normal length
SGD2	map-based cloning	Small Grain and Dwarf 2, encoding an HD-Zip II family transcription factor, regulates plant development by modulating gibberellin biosynthesis in rice.	 Map-based cloning and complementation tests demonstrated that a 9 bp deletion in a homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-Zip) II family transcription factor was responsible for the sgd2 mutant phenotype
SGD2	nucleus	Small Grain and Dwarf 2, encoding an HD-Zip II family transcription factor, regulates plant development by modulating gibberellin biosynthesis in rice.	 Expression of SGD2 was pronounced in developing panicles, and its protein was localized in nucleus
