NA	Two RING-finger ubiquitin E3 ligases regulate the degradation of SPX4, the internal phosphate sensor, for phosphate homeostasis and signaling in rice.	2019	Mol Plant	Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilizer, Ministry of Agriculture, Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	SPX-domain containing proteins play an important role in inorganic phosphate (Pi) sensing, signaling and transport in eukaryotes. In plants, the only SPX-domain containing proteins (SPXs) are known to integrate cellular Pi status and negatively regulate the activity of Pi central regulators, PHOSPATE STARVATION RESPONSE proteins (PHRs). The stability of SPX proteins, such as SPX4 was reduced under Pi-deficient condition. However, the mechanism by which SPXs are degraded is still unknown. In a yeast-two hybrid screen to identify SPX4 stability regulators in rice, we isolated two candidate SPX4 degradation E3 ligases (designed as SDELs), which were post-transcriptionally induced by the Pi starvation. We found that the nucleus and cytoplasm located SDELs had ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and directly ubiquitinated the K213 and K299 lysine residues in SPX4, therefore regulating SPX4 stability. Furthermore, PHR2, the Pi central regulator in rice, could compete with SDELs by interacting with SPX4 under Pi sufficient conditions, which protects SPX4 from ubiquitination and degradation. Consistent with this biochemical function of SDEL1 and SDEL2, enhancing the expression of SDEL1 and SDEL2 results in Pi over-accumulation and induces Pi-starvation signaling even under Pi-sufficient conditions. Conversely, the loss-of-function mutants display lower Pi accumulation and reduced Pi-starvation signaling. Therefore SDEL1 and SDEL2 facilitate the degradation of SPX4 to modulate PHR2 activity and regulate Pi-homeostasis and Pi-signaling in response to external Pi availability in rice.
NA	The transcription factor OsMYBc and an E3 ligase regulate expression of a K+ transporter during salt stress.	2022	Plant Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Na+ and K+ homeostasis is essential for plant survival in saline soils. A member of the High-Affinity K+ Transporter (HKT) family in rice (Oryza sativa), OsHKT1;1, is a vital regulator of Na+ exclusion from shoots and is bound by a MYB transcription factor (OsMYBc). Here, we generated transgenic rice lines in the oshkt1;1 mutant background for genetic complementation using genomic OsHKT1;1 containing a native (Com) or mutated (mCom) promoter that cannot be bound by OsMYBc. In contrast to wild-type (WT) or Com lines, the mCom lines were not able to recover the salt-sensitive phenotype of oshkt1;1. The OsMYBc-overexpressing plants were more tolerant to salt stress than WT plants. A yeast two-hybrid screen using the OsMYBc N terminus as bait identified a rice MYBc stress-related RING finger protein (OsMSRFP). OsMSRFP is an active E3 ligase that ubiquitinated OsMYBc in vitro and mediated 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of OsMYBc under semi-in vitro and in vivo conditions. OsMSRFP attenuated OsMYBc-mediated OsHKT1;1 expression, and knockout of OsMSRFP led to rice salt tolerance. These findings uncover a regulatory mechanism of salt response that fine-tunes OsHKT1;1 transcription by ubiquitination of OsMYBc.
NA	The D14-SDEL1-SPX4 cascade integrates the strigolactone and phosphate signalling networks in rice.	2023	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics &amp; Germplasm Enhancement and Utilization, Nanjing Agricultural University, 210095, Nanjing, China.	Modern agriculture needs large quantities of phosphate (Pi) fertilisers to obtain high yields. Information on how plants sense and adapt to Pi is required to enhance phosphorus-use efficiency (PUE) and thereby promote agricultural sustainability. Here, we show that strigolactones (SLs) regulate riceÂ root developmental and metabolic adaptations to low Pi, by promoting efficient Pi uptake and translocation from roots to shoots. Low Pi stress triggers the synthesis of SLs, which dissociate the Pi central signalling module of SPX domain-containing protein (SPX4) and PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE protein (PHR2), leading to the release of PHR2 into the nucleus and activating the expression of Pi-starvation-induced genes including Pi transporters. The SL synthetic analogue GR24 enhances the interaction between the SL receptor DWARF 14 (D14) and a RING-finger ubiquitin E3 ligase (SDEL1). The sdel mutants have a reduced response to Pi starvation relative to wild-type plants, leading to insensitive root adaptation to Pi. Also, SLs induce the degradation of SPX4 via forming the D14-SDEL1-SPX4 complex. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism underlying crosstalk between the SL and Pi signalling networks in response to Pi fluctuations, which will enable breeding of high-PUE crop plants.
