SPX-domain containing proteins play an important role in inorganic phosphate (Pi) sensing, signaling and transport in eukaryotes. In plants, the only SPX-domain containing proteins (SPXs) are known to integrate cellular Pi status and negatively regulate the activity of Pi central regulators, PHOSPATE STARVATION RESPONSE proteins (PHRs). The stability of SPX proteins, such as SPX4 was reduced under Pi-deficient condition. However, the mechanism by which SPXs are degraded is still unknown. In a yeast-two hybrid screen to identify SPX4 stability regulators in rice, we isolated two candidate SPX4 degradation E3 ligases (designed as SDELs), which were post-transcriptionally induced by the Pi starvation. We found that the nucleus and cytoplasm located SDELs had ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and directly ubiquitinated the K213 and K299 lysine residues in SPX4, therefore regulating SPX4 stability. Furthermore, PHR2, the Pi central regulator in rice, could compete with SDELs by interacting with SPX4 under Pi sufficient conditions, which protects SPX4 from ubiquitination and degradation. Consistent with this biochemical function of SDEL1 and SDEL2, enhancing the expression of SDEL1 and SDEL2 results in Pi over-accumulation and induces Pi-starvation signaling even under Pi-sufficient conditions. Conversely, the loss-of-function mutants display lower Pi accumulation and reduced Pi-starvation signaling. Therefore SDEL1 and SDEL2 facilitate the degradation of SPX4 to modulate PHR2 activity and regulate Pi-homeostasis and Pi-signaling in response to external Pi availability in rice.
