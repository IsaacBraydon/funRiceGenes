OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	SDEL1|OsMSRFP	The transcription factor OsMYBc and an E3 ligase regulate expression of a K+ transporter during salt stress.	 OsMSRFP attenuated OsMYBc-mediated OsHKT1;1 expression, and knockout of OsMSRFP led to rice salt tolerance
OsROC1|OsMYBc	SDEL1|OsMSRFP	The transcription factor OsMYBc and an E3 ligase regulate expression of a K+ transporter during salt stress.	 A yeast two-hybrid screen using the OsMYBc N terminus as bait identified a rice MYBc stress-related RING finger protein (OsMSRFP)
OsROC1|OsMYBc	SDEL1|OsMSRFP	The transcription factor OsMYBc and an E3 ligase regulate expression of a K+ transporter during salt stress.	 OsMSRFP is an active E3 ligase that ubiquitinated OsMYBc in vitro and mediated 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of OsMYBc under semi-in vitro and in vivo conditions
HTD2|D88|D14	SDEL1|OsMSRFP	The D14-SDEL1-SPX4 cascade integrates the strigolactone and phosphate signalling networks in rice.	 The SL synthetic analogue GR24 enhances the interaction between the SL receptor DWARF 14 (D14) and a RING-finger ubiquitin E3 ligase (SDEL1)
OsSPX4	SDEL1|OsMSRFP	The D14-SDEL1-SPX4 cascade integrates the strigolactone and phosphate signalling networks in rice	The D14-SDEL1-SPX4 cascade integrates the strigolactone and phosphate signalling networks in rice
