SSD1	root	SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice	ssd1 exhibits pleiotropic defects in elongation of various organs such as stems, roots, leaves, and flowers
SSD1	dwarf	SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice	In this study we analyzed a novel dwarf mutant, ssd1, of which phenotype is different from typical GA- or BR-related dwarf phenotype
SSD1	dwarf	SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice	Map-based cloning and complementation test demonstrated that the dwarf phenotype in ssd1 mutant was caused by insertion of retrotransposon in a gene, which encodes plant-specific protein with unknown biochemical function
SSD1	flower	SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice	ssd1 exhibits pleiotropic defects in elongation of various organs such as stems, roots, leaves, and flowers
SSD1	stem	SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice	ssd1 exhibits pleiotropic defects in elongation of various organs such as stems, roots, leaves, and flowers
SSD1	cell division	SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice	ssd1 also shows abnormal cell files and shapes, which suggests defects of normal cell division in the mutant
SSD1	cell division	SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice	Our results demonstrate that SSD1 controls plant elongation by controlling cell division in higher plants
SSD1	cell division	SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice	SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice
