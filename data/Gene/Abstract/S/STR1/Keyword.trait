STR1	transporter	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice	 Mutation of either of the Oryza sativa (rice) ABCG transporters blocked arbuscule growth of different AM fungi at a small and stunted stage, recapitulating the phenotype of Medicago truncatula stunted arbuscule 1 and 2 (str1 and str2) mutants that are deficient in homologous ABCG genes|The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice
STR1	root	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice	 Analogous to STR1 and STR2, at the root cortex level, the antiSTR1 transcript is specifically detected in arbusculated cells, suggesting unexpected modes of STR1 regulation in rice
STR1	growth	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice	 Mutation of either of the Oryza sativa (rice) ABCG transporters blocked arbuscule growth of different AM fungi at a small and stunted stage, recapitulating the phenotype of Medicago truncatula stunted arbuscule 1 and 2 (str1 and str2) mutants that are deficient in homologous ABCG genes| Malnutrition of the fungus underlying limited arbuscular growth was excluded by the absence of complementation of the str1 phenotype by wild-type nurse plants
STR1	strigolactone	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice	 Strigolactones have previously been hypothesized to operate as intracellular hyphal branching signals and possible substrates of STR1 and STR2| However, full arbuscule development in the strigolactone biosynthesis mutants d10 and d17 suggested strigolactones to be unlikely substrates of STR1/STR2
STR1	branching	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice	 Strigolactones have previously been hypothesized to operate as intracellular hyphal branching signals and possible substrates of STR1 and STR2
