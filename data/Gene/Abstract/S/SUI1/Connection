OsSUI1	SUI2	SUI-family genes encode phosphatidylserine synthases and regulate stem development in rice	 Overexpression of SUI1 and SUI2 caused outgrowths of internodes during vegetative development, and we showed that expression patterns of Oryza Sativa Homeobox 15 (OSH15) and Histone4 were impaired
