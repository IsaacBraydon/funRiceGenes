OSBZ8|OsbZIP05	SAPK4|OSPDK	Spermidine-mediated in vitro phosphorylation of transcriptional regulator OSBZ8 by SNF1-type serine/threonine protein kinase SAPK4 homolog in indica rice	 In this report, we demonstrate that spermidine mediates in vitro phosphorylation of OSBZ8, a bZIP class of ABRE-binding transcription factor, by OSPDK|Spermidine-mediated in vitro phosphorylation of transcriptional regulator OSBZ8 by SNF1-type serine/threonine protein kinase SAPK4 homolog in indica rice
OsCLC1	SAPK4|OSPDK	The SNF1-type serine-threonine protein kinase SAPK4 regulates stress-responsive gene expression in rice	 SAPK4-regulated genes with functions in ion homeostasis and oxidative stress response were identified: the vacuolar H+-ATPase, the Na+/H+ antiporter NHX1, the Cl- channel OsCLC1 and a catalase
