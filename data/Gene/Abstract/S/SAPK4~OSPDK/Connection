OSBZ8|OsbZIP05	SAPK4|OSPDK	Spermidine-mediated in vitro phosphorylation of transcriptional regulator OSBZ8 by SNF1-type serine/threonine protein kinase SAPK4 homolog in indica rice	In this report, we demonstrate that spermidine mediates in vitro phosphorylation of OSBZ8, a bZIP class of ABRE-binding transcription factor, by OSPDK
OSBZ8|OsbZIP05	SAPK4|OSPDK	Spermidine-mediated in vitro phosphorylation of transcriptional regulator OSBZ8 by SNF1-type serine/threonine protein kinase SAPK4 homolog in indica rice	Spermidine-mediated in vitro phosphorylation of transcriptional regulator OSBZ8 by SNF1-type serine/threonine protein kinase SAPK4 homolog in indica rice
OsCLC1	SAPK4|OSPDK	The SNF1-type serine-threonine protein kinase SAPK4 regulates stress-responsive gene expression in rice	SAPK4-regulated genes with functions in ion homeostasis and oxidative stress response were identified: the vacuolar H+-ATPase, the Na+/H+ antiporter NHX1, the Cl- channel OsCLC1 and a catalase
OsbZIP42	SAPK4|OSPDK	OsbZIP42 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling and confers drought tolerance to rice.	 The activation of OsbZIP42 depends on stress-/ABA-activated protein kinase 4 (SAPK4) and an additional ABA-dependent modification of OsbZIP42
OsbZIP42	SAPK4|OSPDK	OsbZIP42 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling and confers drought tolerance to rice.	 Although the full-length OsbZIP42 protein did not, the N-terminus of the protein interacted with SAPK4
OsbZIP42	SAPK4|OSPDK	OsbZIP42 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling and confers drought tolerance to rice.	 Our results suggest that the activation of OsbZIP42 by SAPK4 requires another ABA-dependent modification of OsbZIP42
