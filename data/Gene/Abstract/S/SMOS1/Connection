OsPHI-1	SMOS1|SHB|RLA1|NGR5	A novel AP2-type transcription factor, SMALL ORGAN SIZE1, controls organ size downstream of an auxin signaling pathway	Among the down-regulated genes, we demonstrated by gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments that OsPHI-1, which is involved in cell expansion, is a target of SMOS1
OsPHI-1	SMOS1|SHB|RLA1|NGR5	Small Organ Size 1 and Small Organ Size 2/Dwarf and Low Tillering form a Complex to Integrate Auxin and Brassinosteroid Signaling in Rice.	Consistently, the expression of OsPHI-1, a direct target of SMOS1, is up-regulated only when SMOS1 and SMOS2/DLT proteins were both present in rice cells
