OsPHI-1	SMOS1|SHB|RLA1|NGR5|GR5	A novel AP2-type transcription factor, SMALL ORGAN SIZE1, controls organ size downstream of an auxin signaling pathway	Among the down-regulated genes, we demonstrated by gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments that OsPHI-1, which is involved in cell expansion, is a target of SMOS1
OsPHI-1	SMOS1|SHB|RLA1|NGR5|GR5	Small Organ Size 1 and Small Organ Size 2/Dwarf and Low Tillering form a Complex to Integrate Auxin and Brassinosteroid Signaling in Rice.	Consistently, the expression of OsPHI-1, a direct target of SMOS1, is up-regulated only when SMOS1 and SMOS2/DLT proteins were both present in rice cells
NAC028	SMOS1|SHB|RLA1|NGR5|GR5	Red-light receptor phytochrome B inhibits BZR1-NAC028-CAD8B signaling to negatively regulate rice resistance to sheath blight.	 It was also found that the BZR1 ligand NAC028 positively regulated resistance to ShB
PHYB|OsphyB	SMOS1|SHB|RLA1|NGR5|GR5	Red-light receptor phytochrome B inhibits BZR1-NAC028-CAD8B signaling to negatively regulate rice resistance to sheath blight.	 Here, we found that PhyB mutation or shade treatment promoted rice resistance to ShB, while resistance was reduced by PhyB overexpression
PHYB|OsphyB	SMOS1|SHB|RLA1|NGR5|GR5	Red-light receptor phytochrome B inhibits BZR1-NAC028-CAD8B signaling to negatively regulate rice resistance to sheath blight.	 Plants overexpressing PIL15 were more susceptible to ShB in contrast to bzr1-D-overexpressing plants compared with the wild-type, suggesting that PhyB may inhibit BZR1 to negatively regulate rice resistance to ShB
OsBZR1|BZR1	SMOS1|SHB|RLA1|NGR5|GR5	Red-light receptor phytochrome B inhibits BZR1-NAC028-CAD8B signaling to negatively regulate rice resistance to sheath blight.	 Plants overexpressing PIL15 were more susceptible to ShB in contrast to bzr1-D-overexpressing plants compared with the wild-type, suggesting that PhyB may inhibit BZR1 to negatively regulate rice resistance to ShB
OsBZR1|BZR1	SMOS1|SHB|RLA1|NGR5|GR5	Red-light receptor phytochrome B inhibits BZR1-NAC028-CAD8B signaling to negatively regulate rice resistance to sheath blight.	 Although BZR1 is known to regulate brassinosteroid (BR) signalling, the observation that BR signalling negatively regulated resistance to ShB indicated an independent role for BZR1 in controlling rice resistance

NAC028	SMOS1|SHB|RLA1|NGR5|GR5	bZIP23 interacts with NAC028 to modulate rice resistance to sheath blight disease.	 Results of the transcriptome and qRT-PCR analyses demonstrated that CAD8B, a key enzyme for lignin biosynthesis and ShB resistance, is regulated by both bZIP23 and NAC028
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	SMOS1|SHB|RLA1|NGR5|GR5	GR5 acts in the G protein pathway to regulate grain size in rice.	 We demonstrated that GR5 physically interacts with five Gγ subunit proteins (RGG1, RGG2, DEP1, GS3, and GGC2) and acts downstream of the G protein complex
