Plant Cell Physiol-2014-Aya-pcp-pcu023.pdf	A novel AP2-type transcription factor, SMALL ORGAN SIZE1, controls organ size downstream of an auxin signaling pathway	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, 464-8601 Japan.	The organ size of flowering plants is determined by two post-embryonic developmental events: cell proliferation and cell expansion. In this study, we identified a new rice loss-of-function mutant, small organ size1 (smos1), that decreases the final size of various organs due to decreased cell size and abnormal microtubule orientation. SMOS1 encodes an unusual APETALA2 (AP2)-type transcription factor with an imperfect AP2 domain, and its product belongs to the basal AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) lineage, including WRINKLED1 (WRI1) and ADAP. SMOS1 expression was induced by exogenous auxin treatment, and the auxin response element (AuxRE) of the SMOS1 promoter acts as a cis-motif through interaction with auxin response factor (ARF). Furthermore, a functional fluorophore-tagged SMOS1 was localized to the nucleus, supporting the role of SMOS1 as a transcriptional regulator for organ size control. Microarray analysis showed that the smos1 mutation represses expression of several genes involved in microtubule-based movement and DNA replication. Among the down-regulated genes, we demonstrated by gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments that OsPHI-1, which is involved in cell expansion, is a target of SMOS1. SMOS1 homologs in early-diverged land plants partially rescued the smos1 phenotype of rice. We propose that SMOS1 acts as an auxin-dependent regulator for cell expansion during organ size control, and that its function is conserved among land plants.
NA	SHOEBOX Modulates Root Meristem Size in Rice through Dose-Dependent Effects of Gibberellins on Cell Elongation and Proliferation.	2015	PLoS Genet	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	Little is known about how the size of meristem cells is regulated and whether it participates in the control of meristem size in plants. Here, we report our findings on shoebox (shb), a mild gibberellin (GA) deficient rice mutant that has a short root meristem size. Quantitative analysis of cortical cell length and number indicates that shb has shorter, rather than fewer, cells in the root meristem until around the fifth day after sowing, from which the number of cortical cells is also reduced. These defects can be either corrected by exogenous application of bioactive GA or induced in wild-type roots by a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of paclobutrazol on GA biosynthesis, suggesting that GA deficiency is the primary cause of shb mutant phenotypes. SHB encodes an AP2/ERF transcription factor that directly activates transcription of the GA biosynthesis gene KS1. Thus, root meristem size in rice is modulated by SHB-mediated GA biosynthesis that regulates the elongation and proliferation of meristem cells in a developmental stage-specific manner.
NA	The RLA1/SMOS1 Transcription Factor Functions with OsBZR1 to Regulate Brassinosteroid Signaling and Rice Architecture.	2017	Plant Cell	Fudan University CITY: Shanghai China [CN].	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant-specific steroid hormones that control plant growth and development. Recent studies have identified key components of the BR signaling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana and in rice (Oryza sativa); however, the mechanism of BR signaling in rice, especially downstream of GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase (GSK2), remains unclear. Here we identified a BR-insensitive rice mutant, reduced leaf angle 1 (rla1), and cloned the corresponding gene. RLA1 was identical to the previously reported SMALL ORGAN SIZE 1 (SMOS1) which was cloned from another allele. RLA1/SMOS1 encodes a transcription factor with an APETALA2 DNA-binding domain. Genetic analysis indicated that RLA1/SMOS1 functions as a positive regulator in the BR signaling pathway and is required for the function of BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (OsBZR1). In addition, RLA1/SMOS1 can interact with OsBZR1 to enhance its transcriptional activity. GSK2 can interact with and phosphorylate RLA1/SMOS1 to reduce its stability. These results demonstrate that RLA1/SMOS1 acts as an integrator of the transcriptional complex directly downstream of GSK2 and plays an essential role in BR signaling and plant development in rice.
