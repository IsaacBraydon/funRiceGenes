10.1007-BF00222200.pdf	Molecular analysis of the inheritance of the S-5 locus, conferring wide compatibility in Indica/Japonica hybrids of rice (O. sativa L.)	1995	Theor Appl Genet	Department of Plant Breeding and Biometry, Cornell University, 14853-1902, Ithaca, NY, USA.	RFLP analysis was conducted on a population derived from a three-way cross to determine the location of the hybrid sterility locus, S-5, in relation to mapped molecular markers and to identify markers that would be useful for selection in breeding. S-5 is of interest to rice breeders because it is associated with spikelet sterility of F1 hybrids in Indica/Japonica crosses. Identification of an S-5 allele which confers fertility in Indica/Japonica hybrids when introgressed into either the Indica or the Japonica parent has been reported. Varieties carrying this S-5 (n) allele are known as "wide compatibility varieties (WCV)". Our data suggests that RFLP marker RG213 on chromosome 6 is closely linked to the S-5 locus and can be efficiently used to identify wide compatibility (WC) lines. RG213 is a single-copy genomic clone that detects three bands of different molecular weights in DNA from Japonica ('Akihikari') and Indica ('IR36') varieties and WC line ('Nekken 2'). We demonstrate that the three alleles detected by this marker could be used to trace the inheritance of the "wide compatible" phenotype in breeders' material.
11436.full.pdf	A triallelic system of S5 is a major regulator of the reproductive barrier and compatibility of indica-japonica hybrids in rice	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Centre of Plant Gene Research, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Hybrid sterility is a major form of postzygotic reproductive isolation. Although reproductive isolation has been a key issue in evolutionary biology for many decades in a wide range of organisms, only very recently a few genes for reproductive isolation were identified. The Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) is divided into two subspecies, indica and japonica. Hybrids between indica and japonica varieties are usually highly sterile. A special group of rice germplasm, referred to as wide-compatibility varieties, is able to produce highly fertile hybrids when crossed to both indica and japonica. In this study, we cloned S5, a major locus for indica-japonica hybrid sterility and wide compatibility, using a map-based cloning approach. We show that S5 encodes an aspartic protease conditioning embryo-sac fertility. The indica (S5-i) and japonica (S5-j) alleles differ by two nucleotides. The wide compatibility gene (S5-n) has a large deletion in the N terminus of the predicted S5 protein, causing subcellular mislocalization of the protein, and thus is presumably nonfunctional. This triallelic system has a profound implication in the evolution and artificial breeding of cultivated rice. Genetic differentiation between indica and japonica would have been enforced because of the reproductive barrier caused by S5-i and S5-j, and species coherence would have been maintained by gene flow enabled by the wide compatibility gene.
1319.pdf	Molecular basis underlying the S5-dependent reproductive isolation and compatibility of indica/japonica rice hybrids	2012	Plant Physiol	National Maize Improvement Center of China, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, People's Republic of China.	The S5 locus regulates spikelet fertility of indica/japonica hybrid rice (Oryza sativa). There are three alleles at the S5 locus, including an indica allele (S5i), a japonica allele (S5j), and a wide-compatibility allele (S5n). This study analyzed the molecular basis for S5-dependent reproductive isolation and compatibility of indica/japonica rice hybrids. Three S5 alleles were expressed at extremely low levels, and only in the ovary. S5n was more similar to S5i in both RNA and protein expression profiles. The S5 locus was not essential for embryo sac development, although deleterious interactions between S5i and S5j resulted in reduced rates of spikelet fertility. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to test direct interactions between S5-encoded proteins. The results indicated that the S5i- and S5j-encoded eukaryotic aspartyl proteases formed both homodimers and heterodimers, whereas the S5n-encoded aspartyl protease was incapable of dimerization. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that a single amino acid difference between S5i- and S5j-encoded aspartyl proteases (phenylalanine/leucine at residue 273) was primarily responsible for embryo sac abortion. The S5 locus may have promoted the subspeciation of indica and japonica, but it also enables gene flow between them.
liukd1997.pdf	A genome-wide analysis of wide compatibility in rice and the precise location of the S 5 locus in the molecular map	1997	TAG Theoretical and Applied Genetics	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China, CN	The discovery of wide-compatibility varieties (WCVs) that are able to produce normal fertility hybrids when crossed both to indica and japonica rice has enabled the fertility barrier between indica and japonica subspecies to be broken and provided the possibility of developing inter-subspecific hybrids in rice breeding programs. However, a considerable variation in the fertility level of hybrids from the same WCV crossed to different varieties has often been observed. One hypothesis for this variable fertility is that additional genes are involved in hybrid fertility besides the wide-compatibility gene (WCG). To assess such a possibility, we performed a genome-wide analysis by assaying a large population from a three-way cross â€<U+393C><U+3E38>02428â€<U+393C><U+3E39>/â€˜Nanjing 11â€<U+393C><U+3E39>//â€˜Balillaâ€<U+393C><U+3E39> using a total of 171 RFLP probes detecting 191 polymorphic loci distributed throughout the entire rice linkage map. Our analysis recovered 3 loci conferring significant effects on hybrid fertility. The major locus on chromosome 6 coincided in chromosomal location with the previously identified S 5 locus, and the 2 minor loci that mapped to chromosomes 2 and 12, respectively, were apparently distinct from all previously reported hybrid sterility genes. Interaction between the indica and japonica alleles at each of the loci caused a reduction in hybrid fertility. The joint effect of the 2 minor loci could lead to partial sterility even in the presence of the WCG. The location of the S 5 locus on the molecular marker linkage map was determined to be approximately 1.0 cM from the RFLP locus R2349. This tight linkage will be useful for marker-aided transfer of the WCG in hybrid rice breeding and for map-based cloning.
Qiusq_TAG_2005.pdf	Delimitation of the rice wide compatibility gene S5 ( n ) to a 40-kb DNA fragment	2005	Theor Appl Genet	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, and National Center of Plant Gene Research-Wuhan, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Wide compatibility varieties (WCVs) are a special class of rice (Oryza sativa L.) germplasm that produces hybrids with normal pollen and spikelet fertility when crossed with both indica and japonica subspecies. The wide compatibility gene S5 ( n ) has been used extensively in inter-subspecific hybrid breeding programs. We previously mapped the S5 locus to a 2.2-cM genomic region between RM253 and R2349 on chromosome 6, using a population of 356 F(1) plants derived from the three-way cross 02428/Nanjing11//Balilla. In this study, a chromosome walking strategy was employed to construct a physical map covering this genomic region using these two closest markers as the starting points. A physical map consisting of six overlapping BAC clones was formed, spanning a genomic region of 540-kb in length. By analyzing recombination events from a population of 8,000 F(1) plants derived from a three-way cross based on near isogenic lines of the S5 locus, the S5 locus was localized to a DNA fragment of 40-kb in length, flanked by two shotgun subclones, 7B1 and 15D2. Sequence analysis of this fragment predicted five open reading frames, encoding xyloglucan fucosyltransferases, dnak-type molecular chaperone BiP, a putative eukaryotic aspartyl protease, and a hypothetical protein. This result will be very useful in molecular cloning of the S5 ( n ) allele and marker-assisted transferring of the wide compatibility gene in rice breeding programs.
s5-du.pdf	Complex evolution of S5, a major reproductive barrier regulator, in the cultivated rice Oryza sativa and its wild relatives	2011	New Phytol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Centre of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	* The hybrid sterility gene S5 comprises three types of alleles in cultivated rice. Such tri-allelic system provided a unique opportunity to study the molecular bases of evolutionary changes underlying reproductive isolation in plants. * We analysed the sequence diversity and evolutionary history of S5 in 138 Oryza accessions. We also examined the effect of the two functional variations (C819A and C1412T) in determining hybrid sterility by transformation. * Nineteen haplotypes were identified, which were classified into the indica-like, the japonica-like and the wide-compatibility gene (WCG)-like group, according to the sequence features of the tri-allelic system. The origin and evolutionary course of the three allelic groups were investigated, thus confirming the independent origins of indica and japonica subspecies. There were perfect associations between C819A and C1412T in the rice germplasm assayed, and the combination of C819 and C1412 was required for hybrid sterility. Evidence of positive selection in the WCG-like alleles suggested that they might have been favored by selection for higher compatibility in hybrids. * The complex evolution of S5 revealed the counteractive function of the three allelic groups at the species level. S5 might perform an important primary function in an evolutionary scale, and hybrid sterility acts as a 'byproduct' of this speciation gene.
Science-2012-Yang-1336-40.pdf	A killer-protector system regulates both hybrid sterility and segregation distortion in rice	2012	Science	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Centre of Plant Gene Research, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Hybrid sterility is a major form of postzygotic reproductive isolation that restricts gene flow between populations. Cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) consists of two subspecies, indica and japonica; inter-subspecific hybrids are usually sterile. We show that a killer-protector system at the S5 locus encoded by three tightly linked genes [Open Reading Frame 3 (ORF3) to ORF5] regulates fertility in indica-japonica hybrids. During female sporogenesis, the action of ORF5+ (killer) and ORF4+ (partner) causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. ORF3+ (protector) prevents ER stress and produces normal gametes, but ORF3- cannot prevent ER stress, resulting in premature programmed cell death and leads to embryo-sac abortion. Preferential transmission of ORF3+ gametes results in segregation distortion in the progeny. These results add to our understanding of differences between indica and japonica rice and may aid in rice genetic improvement.
