OsSGRL	SGR	The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice	The relationship between SGRL and SGR and their effects on the degradation of the light-harvesting Chl a/b-binding protein are also discussed
OsPAO	SGR	Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice	SGR, like the gene for pheophorbide a oxygenase (PaO), was constitutively expressed, but was upregulated by dark-induced senescence in rice leaves
OsPAO	SGR	Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice	Senescence-induced expression of SGR and PaO was enhanced by ABA, but inhibited by cytokinin
OsPAO	SGR	Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice	According to these observations, we propose that SGR may be involved in regulating or taking part in the activity of PaO, and then may influence Chl breakdown and degradation of pigment-protein complex
ONAC106	SGR	Rice ONAC106 inhibits leaf senescence and increases salt tolerance and tiller angle.	Using yeast one-hybrid assays, we found that ONAC106 binds to the promoter regions of SGR, NYC1, OsNAC5, and LPA1
OsBBS1|OsRLCK109|LMM24	SGR	LMM24 Encodes Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase 109, Which Regulates Cell Death and Defense Responses in Rice.	 Chloroplast degradation was observed in lmm24 leaves, with decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes and increased expression of the senescence-induced STAYGREEN (SGR) gene and other senescence-associated genes
