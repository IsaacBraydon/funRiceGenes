OsSGRL	SGR	The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice	 An SGR homologue, SGR-like (SGRL), has been detected in many plant species| We show that SGRL is primarily expressed in green tissues, and is significantly downregulated in rice leaves undergoing natural and dark-induced senescence| As the light intensity increases during the natural photoperiod, the intensity of SGRL expression declines while that of SGR expression increases| Overexpression of SGRL reduces the levels of Chl and Chl-binding proteins in leaves, and accelerates their degradation in dark-induced senescence leaves in rice| Our results suggest that the SGRL protein is also involved in Chl degradation| The relationship between SGRL and SGR and their effects on the degradation of the light-harvesting Chl a/b-binding protein are also discussed|The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice
OsPAO	SGR	Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice	 SGR, like the gene for pheophorbide a oxygenase (PaO), was constitutively expressed, but was upregulated by dark-induced senescence in rice leaves| Senescence-induced expression of SGR and PaO was enhanced by ABA, but inhibited by cytokinin| According to these observations, we propose that SGR may be involved in regulating or taking part in the activity of PaO, and then may influence Chl breakdown and degradation of pigment-protein complex
