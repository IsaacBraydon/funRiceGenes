The Stay-Green Rice (SGR) protein is encoded by the SGR gene and has been shown to affect chlorophyll (Chl) degradation during natural and dark-induced leaf senescence. An SGR homologue, SGR-like (SGRL), has been detected in many plant species. We show that SGRL is primarily expressed in green tissues, and is significantly downregulated in rice leaves undergoing natural and dark-induced senescence. As the light intensity increases during the natural photoperiod, the intensity of SGRL expression declines while that of SGR expression increases. Overexpression of SGRL reduces the levels of Chl and Chl-binding proteins in leaves, and accelerates their degradation in dark-induced senescence leaves in rice. Our results suggest that the SGRL protein is also involved in Chl degradation. The relationship between SGRL and SGR and their effects on the degradation of the light-harvesting Chl a/b-binding protein are also discussed.

Chloroplasts undergo drastic morphological and physiological changes during senescence with a visible symptom of chlorophyll (Chl) degradation. A stay green mutant was identified and then isolated from the japonica rice (Oryza sativa) cv. Huazhiwu by gamma-ray irradiation. The stay green mutant was characterized by Chl retention, stable Chl-protein complexes, and stable thylakoid membrane structures, but lost its photosynthetic competence during senescence. The gene, designated Stay Green Rice (SGR), was cloned by a positional cloning strategy encoding an ancient protein containing a putative chloroplast transit peptide. SGR protein was found in both soluble and thylakoid membranes in rice. SGR, like the gene for pheophorbide a oxygenase (PaO), was constitutively expressed, but was upregulated by dark-induced senescence in rice leaves. Senescence-induced expression of SGR and PaO was enhanced by ABA, but inhibited by cytokinin. Overexpression of SGR reduced the number of lamellae in the grana thylakoids and reduced the Chl content of normally growing leaves. This indicates that upregulation of SGR increases Chl breakdown during senescence in rice. A small quantity of chlorophyllide a accumulated in sgr leaves, but this also accumulated in wild-type rice leaves during senescence. Some pheophorbide a was detected in sgr leaves in the dark. According to these observations, we propose that SGR may be involved in regulating or taking part in the activity of PaO, and then may influence Chl breakdown and degradation of pigment-protein complex.

It is thought that the Stay Green Rice (SGR) gene is involved in the disaggregation of the light harvesting complex and in the subsequent breakdown of chlorophyll and apo-protein during senescence. In this study, we found that overexpression of SGR (Ov-SGR) resulted in the generation of singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species and produced a chlorophyll-dependent regional cell death phenotype on leaves of rice seedlings. Transcriptome analyses using Affymetrix Rice GeneChips revealed that Ov-SGR rice seedlings exhibited a number of signs of singlet oxygen response. The genes and their associated biochemical pathways identified provide an insight into how rice plants respond to singlet oxygen at the molecular and physiologic level.
NA	Natural variations at the Stay-Green gene promoter control lifespan and yield in rice cultivars.	2020	Nat Commun	Department of Southern Area Crop Science, National Institute of Crop Science (NICS), RDA, Miryang, Republic of Korea.	Increased grain yield will be critical to meet the growing demand for food, and could be achieved by delaying crop senescence. Here, via quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, we uncover the genetic basis underlying distinct life cycles and senescence patterns of two rice subspecies, indica and japonica. Promoter variations in the Stay-Green (OsSGR) gene encoding the chlorophyll-degrading Mg++-dechelatase were found to trigger higher and earlier induction of OsSGR in indica, which accelerated senescence of indica rice cultivars. The indica-type promoter is present in a progenitor subspecies O. nivara and thus was acquired early during the evolution of rapid cycling trait in rice subspecies. Japonica OsSGR alleles introgressed into indica-type cultivars in Korean rice fields lead to delayed senescence, with increased grain yield and enhanced photosynthetic competence. Taken together, these data establish that naturally occurring OsSGR promoter and related lifespan variations can be exploited in breeding programs to augment rice yield.
NA	Characterization of a novel allele encoding pheophorbide a oxygenase in rice	2020	Plant Signal Behav	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute , Hangzhou, China.	We identified a rapid cell death 2 (rcd2) mutant from an indica cultivar Zhongjian100 mutant bank. The red-brown lesions appeared firstly on young seedling leaves, then gradually merged and the leaves completely withered at the late tillering stage. rcd2 displayed apparent cell death at/around the lesions, accumulation of superoxide anion (O2 -) and disturbed ROS scavenging system, impaired photosynthetic capacity with significantly reduced chlorophyll content. The lesion formation was controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene and induced by natural light as well as mechanical wounding. A single base mutation (A1726T) at the 6th exon of OsMH_03G0040800 resulted in I576F substitution in the encoding protein, pheophorbide a oxygenase (PAO). Functional complementation could rescue the mutant phenotype and PAO-knockout lines exhibited the similar phenotype to rcd2. The activity of PAO decreased significantly while the content of PAO substrate, pheophorbide a, increased apparently in rcd2. The expression of chlorophyll synthesis/degradation-related genes and the contents of metabolic intermediates were largely changed. Furthermore, the level of chlorophyllide a, the product of chlorophyllase, increased significantly, indicating chlorophyllase might play a role in chlorophyll degradation in rice. Our results suggested that the I576F substitution disrupted PAO function, leading to O2 - accumulation and chlorophyll degradation breakdown in rice.
