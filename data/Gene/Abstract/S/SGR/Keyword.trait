SGR|OsSGR	senescence	The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice	We show that SGRL is primarily expressed in green tissues, and is significantly downregulated in rice leaves undergoing natural and dark-induced senescence
SGR|OsSGR	senescence	The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice	Overexpression of SGRL reduces the levels of Chl and Chl-binding proteins in leaves, and accelerates their degradation in dark-induced senescence leaves in rice
SGR|OsSGR	chloroplast	Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice	The gene, designated Stay Green Rice (SGR), was cloned by a positional cloning strategy encoding an ancient protein containing a putative chloroplast transit peptide
SGR|OsSGR	senescence	Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings	It is thought that the Stay Green Rice (SGR) gene is involved in the disaggregation of the light harvesting complex and in the subsequent breakdown of chlorophyll and apo-protein during senescence
SGR|OsSGR	cell death	Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings	In this study, we found that overexpression of SGR (Ov-SGR) resulted in the generation of singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species and produced a chlorophyll-dependent regional cell death phenotype on leaves of rice seedlings
