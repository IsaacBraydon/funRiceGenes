SGR	senescence	Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice	 SGR, like the gene for pheophorbide a oxygenase (PaO), was constitutively expressed, but was upregulated by dark-induced senescence in rice leaves
SGR	senescence	Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice	 Senescence-induced expression of SGR and PaO was enhanced by ABA, but inhibited by cytokinin
SGR	senescence	Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice	 This indicates that upregulation of SGR increases Chl breakdown during senescence in rice
SGR	senescence	Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice	 A small quantity of chlorophyllide a accumulated in sgr leaves, but this also accumulated in wild-type rice leaves during senescence
SGR	seedling	Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings	 In this study, we found that overexpression of SGR (Ov-SGR) resulted in the generation of singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species and produced a chlorophyll-dependent regional cell death phenotype on leaves of rice seedlings
SGR	seedling	Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings	 Transcriptome analyses using Affymetrix Rice GeneChips revealed that Ov-SGR rice seedlings exhibited a number of signs of singlet oxygen response
SGR	seedling	Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings	Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings
SGR	oxidative	Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings	Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings
SGR	leaf	The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice	The Stay-Green Rice (SGR) protein is encoded by the SGR gene and has been shown to affect chlorophyll (Chl) degradation during natural and dark-induced leaf senescence
SGR	cytokinin	Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice	 Senescence-induced expression of SGR and PaO was enhanced by ABA, but inhibited by cytokinin
SGR	senescence	The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice	The Stay-Green Rice (SGR) protein is encoded by the SGR gene and has been shown to affect chlorophyll (Chl) degradation during natural and dark-induced leaf senescence
SGR	senescence	The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice	 We show that SGRL is primarily expressed in green tissues, and is significantly downregulated in rice leaves undergoing natural and dark-induced senescence
SGR	senescence	The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice	 Overexpression of SGRL reduces the levels of Chl and Chl-binding proteins in leaves, and accelerates their degradation in dark-induced senescence leaves in rice
SGR	chloroplast	Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice	 The gene, designated Stay Green Rice (SGR), was cloned by a positional cloning strategy encoding an ancient protein containing a putative chloroplast transit peptide
SGR	senescence	Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings	It is thought that the Stay Green Rice (SGR) gene is involved in the disaggregation of the light harvesting complex and in the subsequent breakdown of chlorophyll and apo-protein during senescence
SGR	cell death	Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings	 In this study, we found that overexpression of SGR (Ov-SGR) resulted in the generation of singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species and produced a chlorophyll-dependent regional cell death phenotype on leaves of rice seedlings
SGR	cell death	Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings	Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings
