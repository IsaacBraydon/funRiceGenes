OsAGO7|shl4|SHO2	shoot	The SHOOT ORGANIZATION2 gene coordinates leaf domain development along the central-marginal axis in rice	 The shoot organization2 (sho2) mutant, a weak allele of SHOOTLESS4 that is a ZIPPY/ARGONAUTE7 homolog in rice, shows a variety of leaf abnormalities; filamentous leaves, bi- or trifurcated leaves, separation of the filamentous structure from the leaf blade or deletion of the margin| The expression pattern of SHO2 in the outer layer of the shoot apical meristem and the adaxial surface of the leaf, as well as the altered expression of HD-ZIP III and ETTIN homologs in the central domain of sho2 leaves, suggest that normal development of the central domain is a prerequisite for the synchronous growth of the three domains

OsAGO7|shl4|SHO2	shoot	Shoot organization genes regulate shoot apical meristem organization and the pattern of leaf primordium initiation in rice	The mechanism regulating the pattern of leaf initiation was analyzed by using shoot organization (sho) mutants derived from three loci (SHO1, SHO2, and SHO3)
OsAGO7|shl4|SHO2	leaf development	The small interfering RNA production pathway is required for shoot meristem initiation in rice	 Rice SHL2, SHL4/SHO2, and SHO1 encoded orthologues of Arabidopsis RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6, ARGONAUTE (AGO) 7, and DICER-like 4, respectively, whose mutations affect leaf development through the trans-acting siRNA (ta-siRNA) pathway

OsAGO7|shl4|SHO2	leaf	Over-expression of rice OsAGO7 gene induces upward curling of the leaf blade that enhanced erect-leaf habit	 According to high-sequence conservation, the rolled-leaf gene in rice could be orthologous to the Arabidopsis ZIP/Ago7 gene, so we called it OsAGO7|Over-expression of rice OsAGO7 gene induces upward curling of the leaf blade that enhanced erect-leaf habit
