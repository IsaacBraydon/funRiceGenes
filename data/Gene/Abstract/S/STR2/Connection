STR1	STR2	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice	Mutation of either of the Oryza sativa (rice) ABCG transporters blocked arbuscule growth of different AM fungi at a small and stunted stage, recapitulating the phenotype of Medicago truncatula stunted arbuscule 1 and 2 (str1 and str2) mutants that are deficient in homologous ABCG genes
STR1	STR2	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice	This phenotypic resemblance and phylogenetic analysis suggest functional conservation of STR1 and STR2 across the angiosperms
STR1	STR2	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice	Strigolactones have previously been hypothesized to operate as intracellular hyphal branching signals and possible substrates of STR1 and STR2
STR1	STR2	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice	However, full arbuscule development in the strigolactone biosynthesis mutants d10 and d17 suggested strigolactones to be unlikely substrates of STR1/STR2
STR1	STR2	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice	Analogous to STR1 and STR2, at the root cortex level, the antiSTR1 transcript is specifically detected in arbusculated cells, suggesting unexpected modes of STR1 regulation in rice
STR1	STR2	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice
