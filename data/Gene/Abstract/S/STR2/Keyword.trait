STR2	growth	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice	 Mutation of either of the Oryza sativa (rice) ABCG transporters blocked arbuscule growth of different AM fungi at a small and stunted stage, recapitulating the phenotype of Medicago truncatula stunted arbuscule 1 and 2 (str1 and str2) mutants that are deficient in homologous ABCG genes
STR2	strigolactone	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice	 Strigolactones have previously been hypothesized to operate as intracellular hyphal branching signals and possible substrates of STR1 and STR2
STR2	strigolactone	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice	 However, full arbuscule development in the strigolactone biosynthesis mutants d10 and d17 suggested strigolactones to be unlikely substrates of STR1/STR2
STR2	transporter	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice	 Mutation of either of the Oryza sativa (rice) ABCG transporters blocked arbuscule growth of different AM fungi at a small and stunted stage, recapitulating the phenotype of Medicago truncatula stunted arbuscule 1 and 2 (str1 and str2) mutants that are deficient in homologous ABCG genes
STR2	transporter	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice
STR2	root	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice	 Analogous to STR1 and STR2, at the root cortex level, the antiSTR1 transcript is specifically detected in arbusculated cells, suggesting unexpected modes of STR1 regulation in rice
STR2	branching	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice	 Strigolactones have previously been hypothesized to operate as intracellular hyphal branching signals and possible substrates of STR1 and STR2
