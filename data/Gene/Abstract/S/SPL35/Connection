OsUBC5a	SPL35	Disruption of gene SPL35, encoding a novel CUE domain-containing protein, leads to cell death and enhanced disease response in rice.	 SPL35 directly interacts with the E2 protein OsUBC5a and the coatomer subunit delta proteins Delta-COP1 and Delta-COP2 through the CUE domain, and down-regulation of these interacting proteins also cause development of HR-like lesions resembling those in spl35 and activation of defence responses, indicating that SPL35 may be involved in the ubiquitination and vesicular trafficking pathways
OsLMP1|OsUBP2|LMM22	SPL35	A ubiquitin-specific protease functions in regulating cell death and immune responses in rice.	 LMM22 interacts with SPOTTED LEAF 35 (SPL35), a coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to ER degradation domain-containing protein that is known to participate in ubiquitination and the regulation of cell death and disease response in rice
OsLMP1|OsUBP2|LMM22	SPL35	A ubiquitin-specific protease functions in regulating cell death and immune responses in rice.	 Additional analyses suggest that LMM22 can positively regulate and stabilise the abundance of SPL35 protein likely through its deubiquitination activity
OsLMP1|OsUBP2|LMM22	SPL35	A ubiquitin-specific protease functions in regulating cell death and immune responses in rice.	 These data therefore improve our understanding of the function of UBP in rice innate immune responses by demonstrating that LMM22 functions as a critical regulator of SPL35 in cell death and disease resistance
