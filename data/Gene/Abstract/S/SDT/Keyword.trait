SDT	panicle	Regulation of OsmiR156h through Alternative Polyadenylation Improves Grain Yield in Rice.	 We also show that combining the sdt allele with the OsSPL14WFP allele can be effective in simultaneously improving tillering capacity and panicle branching, thereby leading to higher harvest index and grain yield
SDT	grain	Regulation of OsmiR156h through Alternative Polyadenylation Improves Grain Yield in Rice.	 The plants carrying the semidominant sdt allele exhibit reduced plant height, enhanced lodging resistance, increased tiller numbers per plant, and resulting in an increased grain yield
