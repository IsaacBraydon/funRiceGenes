OsSWAP70A	OsSWAP70B	SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice	 Reduction of OsSWAP70A and OsSWAP70B mRNA levels by RNA interference resulted in the suppression of chitin elicitor-induced defense gene expression and ROS production| In this study, we found rice homologs of human SWAP70, Oryza sativa (Os) SWAP70A and SWAP70B, containing the DH domain
