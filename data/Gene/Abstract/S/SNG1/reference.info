We report the map-based cloning and functional characterization of SNG1, which encodes OsHXK3, a hexokinase-like protein that plays a pivotal role in controlling grain size in rice. Grain size is an important agronomic trait determining grain yield and appearance quality in rice. Here, we report the discovery of rice mutant short and narrow grain1 (sng1) with reduced grain length, width and weight. Map-based cloning revealed that the mutant phenotype was caused by loss of function of gene OsHXK3 that encodes a hexokinase-like (HKL) protein. OsHXK3 was associated with the mitochondria and was ubiquitously distributed in various organs, predominately in younger organs. Analysis of glucose (Glc) phosphorylation activities in young panicles and protoplasts showed that OsHXK3 was a non-catalytic hexokinase (HXK). Overexpression of OsHXK3 could not complement the Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2-1 (gin2-1) mutant, indicating that OsHXK3 lacked Glc signaling activity. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that OsHXK3 affects grain size by promoting spikelet husk cell expansion. Knockout of other nine OsHXK genes except OsHXK3 individually did not change grain size, indicating that functions of OsHXKs have differentiated in rice. OsHXK3 influences gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis and homeostasis. Compared with wild type, OsGA3ox2 was significantly up-regulated and OsGA2ox1 was significantly down-regulated in young panicle of sng1, and concentrations of biologically active GAs were significantly decreased in young panicles of the mutants. The yield per plant of OsHXK3 overexpression lines (OE-4 and OE-35) was increased by 10.91% and 7.62%, respectively, compared to that of wild type. Our results provide evidence that an HXK lacking catalytic and sensory functions plays an important role in grain size and has the potential to increase yield in rice.
