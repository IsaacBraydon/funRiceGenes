d18|OsGA3ox2	SNG1|OsHXK3	OsHXK3 encodes a hexokinase-like protein that positively regulates grain size in rice.	 Compared with wild type, OsGA3ox2 was significantly up-regulated and OsGA2ox1 was significantly down-regulated in young panicle of sng1, and concentrations of biologically active GAs were significantly decreased in young panicles of the mutants
