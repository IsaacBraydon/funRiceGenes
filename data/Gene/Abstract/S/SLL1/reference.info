An sll1 mutant has decreased lateral root growth due to a defect in the cell elongation. The SLL1 gene encodes a member of the stearoyl-acyl carrier protein fatty acid desaturase family that is the key regulator of overall fatty acid desaturation in plants. We measured the fatty acid content and found that the 18:0 content in the sll1 mutant root was approximately 4 times that in the wild-type root. When the sll1 mutant was grown at 33 degrees C, it complemented the mutant phenotype to a moderate level, which reflects the importance of the low 18:0 content in maintaining the cell membrane structure. The SLL1 gene was expressed at the lateral root tip, whereas SLL1 expression was not detected in the elongation zone of the crown roots. These results indicate that the lateral root specific defect in sll1 mutant is caused by the different expression patterns of SLL1 in lateral and crown roots. In addition, SLL1 over-expressers produced significantly longer lateral roots compared to the wild-type, and thus SLL1 gene would be very useful for improving rice root architecture.
Plant Cell-2009-Zhang-719-35.pdf	SHALLOT-LIKE1 is a KANADI transcription factor that modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating leaf abaxial cell development	2009	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, Zhejiang, China.	As an important agronomic trait, rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaf rolling has attracted much attention from plant biologists and breeders. Moderate leaf rolling increases the photosynthesis of cultivars and hence raises grain yield. However, the relevant molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show the isolation and functional characterization of SHALLOT-LIKE1 (SLL1), a key gene controlling rice leaf rolling. sll1 mutant plants have extremely incurved leaves due to the defective development of sclerenchymatous cells on the abaxial side. Defective development can be functionally rescued by expression of SLL1. SLL1 is transcribed in various tissues and accumulates in the abaxial epidermis throughout leaf development. SLL1 encodes a SHAQKYF class MYB family transcription factor belonging to the KANADI family. SLL1 deficiency leads to defective programmed cell death of abaxial mesophyll cells and suppresses the development of abaxial features. By contrast, enhanced SLL1 expression stimulates phloem development on the abaxial side and suppresses bulliform cell and sclerenchyma development on the adaxial side. Additionally, SLL1 deficiency results in increased chlorophyll and photosynthesis. Our findings identify the role of SLL1 in the modulation of leaf abaxial cell development and in sustaining abaxial characteristics during leaf development. These results should facilitate attempts to use molecular breeding to increase the photosynthetic capacity of rice, as well as other crops, by modulating leaf development and rolling.

Appropriate leaf shape has proved to be useful in improving photosynthesis and increasing grain yield. To understand the molecular mechanism of leaf morphogenesis, we identified a rice mutant nrl1, which was characterized by a phenotype of narrow and rolled leaves. Microscopic observation showed that the mutation significantly decreased the number of vascular bundles of leaf and stem. Genetic analysis revealed that the mutation was controlled by a single nuclear-encoded recessive gene. To isolate the nrl1 gene, 756 F(2) and F(3) mutant individuals from a cross of the nrl1 mutant with Longtepu were used and a high-resolution physical map of the chromosomal region around the nrl1 gene was made. Finally, the gene was mapped in 16.5 kb region between marker RL21 and marker RL36 within the BAC clone OSJNBa0027H05. Cloning and sequencing of the target region from the mutant showed that there was a 58 bp deletion within the second exon of the cellulose synthase-like D4 gene (TIGR locus Os12g36890). The nrl1 mutation was rescued by transformation with the wild-type cellulose synthase-like D4 gene. Accordingly, the cellulose synthase-like D4 gene was identified as the NRL1 gene. NRL1 was transcribed in various tissues and was mainly expressed in panicles and internodes. NAL7 and SLL1 were found to be upregulated, whereas OsAGO7 were downregulated in the nrl1 mutant. These findings suggested that there might be a functional association between these genes in regulating leaf development.

Leaves, the collective organ produced by the shoot apical meristem (SAM), are polarized along their adaxial-abaxial axis. In this study, we characterized two rice (Oryza sativa) allelic rolled-leaf mutants, rolled leaf 9-1 (rl9-1) and rl9-2, which display very similar phenotypes with completely adaxialized leaves and malformed spikelets. We cloned the RL9 gene by way of a map-based cloning strategy. Molecular studies have revealed that RL9 encodes a GARP protein, an orthologue of Arabidopsis KANADIs. RL9 is mainly expressed in roots, leaves, and flowers. The transient expression of a RL9-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein has indicated that RL9 protein is localized in the nucleus, suggesting that RL9 acts as a putative transcription factor.
NA	AH2 encodes a MYB domain protein that determines hull fate and affects grain yield and quality in rice.	2019	Plant J	State Key Lab of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, China.	The palea and lemma (hull) are grass-specific organs, and determine grain size and quality. In the study, AH2 encodes a MYB domain protein, and functions in the development of hull and grain. Mutation of AH2 produces smaller grains and alters grain quality including decreased amylose content and gel consistency, and increased protein content. Meantime, part of the hull lost the outer silicified cells, and induces a transformation of the outer rough epidermis to inner smooth epidermis cells, and the body of the palea was reduced in the ah2 muant. We confirmed the function of AH2 by complementation, CRISPR-Cas9, and cytological and molecular tests. Additionally, AH2, as a repressor, repress transcription of the downstream genes. Our results revealed that AH2 plays an important role in the determination of hull epidermis development, palea identity, and grain size. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
