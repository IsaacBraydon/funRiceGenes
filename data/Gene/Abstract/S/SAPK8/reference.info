The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) induces gene expression via the ABA-response element (ABRE) present in the promoters of ABA-regulated genes. A group of bZIP proteins have been identified as ABRE-binding factors (ABFs) that activate transcription through this cis element. A rice ABF, TRAB1, has been shown to be activated via ABA-dependent phosphorylation. While a large number of signalling factors have been identified that are involved in stomatal regulation by ABA, relatively less is known about the ABA-signalling pathway that leads to gene expression. We have shown recently that three members of the rice SnRK2 protein kinase family, SAPK8, SAPK9 and SAPK10, are activated by ABA signal as well as by hyperosmotic stress. Here we show that transient overexpression in cultured cell protoplasts of these ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinases leads to the activation of an ABRE-regulated promoter, suggesting that these kinases are involved in the gene-regulation pathway of ABA signalling. We further show several lines of evidence that these ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinases directly phosphorylate TRAB1 in response to ABA. Kinetic analysis of SAPK10 activation and TRAB1 phosphorylation indicated that the latter immediately followed the former. TRAB1 was found to be phosphorylated not only in response to ABA, but also in response to hyperosmotic stress, which was interpreted as the consequence of phosphorylation of TRAB1 by hyperosmotically activated SAPKs. Physical interaction between TRAB1 and SAPK10 in vivo was demonstrated by a co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Finally, TRAB1 was phosphorylated in vitro by the ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinases at Ser102, which is phosphorylated in vivo in response to ABA and is critical for the activation function.
tpc1601163.pdf	Differential Activation of the Rice Sucrose Nonfermenting1-Related Protein Kinase2 Family by Hyperosmotic Stress and Abscisic Acid	2004	The Plant Cell Online	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan	To date, a large number of sequences of protein kinases that belong to the sucrose nonfermenting1â€“related protein kinase2 (SnRK2) family are found in databases. However, only limited numbers of the family members have been characterized and implicated in abscisic acid (ABA) and hyperosmotic stress signaling. We identified 10 SnRK2 protein kinases encoded by the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Each of the 10 members was expressed in cultured cell protoplasts, and its regulation was analyzed. Here, we demonstrate that all family members are activated by hyperosmotic stress and that three of them are also activated by ABA. Surprisingly, there were no members that were activated only by ABA. The activation was found to be regulated via phosphorylation. In addition to the functional distinction with respect to ABA regulation, dependence of activation on the hyperosmotic strength was different among the members. We show that the relatively diverged C-terminal domain is mainly responsible for this functional distinction, although the kinase domain also contributes to these differences. The results indicated that the SnRK2 protein kinase family has evolved specifically for hyperosmotic stress signaling and that individual members have acquired distinct regulatory properties, including ABA responsiveness by modifying the C-terminal domain.
NA	Protein kinase OsSAPK8 functions as an essential activator of S-type anion channel OsSLAC1, which is nitrate-selective in rice.	2015	Planta	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200032, China.	OsSAPK8 is an essential activator of OsSLAC1 by phosphorylation, and OsSLAC1 is a nitrate-selective anion channel. S-type anion channel AtSLAC1 and protein kinase AtOST1 have been well-characterized as two core components of ABA signaling cascade in Arabidopsis guard cells, and AtOST1 functions as a main upstream activator of AtSLAC1 for drought stress- and ABA-induced stomata closure. However, the identity of the ortholog of AtOST1 in rice, the main activator of OsSLAC1, is still unknown. Here, we report that protein kinase OsSAPK8 interacts with and activates OsSLAC1 mainly by phosphorylating serine 129 (S129) of OsSLAC1, and this phosphorylating site corresponds to the specific phosphorylating site serine 120 (S120) of AtSLAC1 for AtOST1. Additionally, we found that OsSLAC1 is a nitrate-selective anion channel without obvious permeability to chloride, malate, and sulfate, and the expression of OsSLAC1 in Arabidopsis slac1-3 (atslac1-3) mutant successfully rescued the hypersensitive phenotype of this mutant to drought stress. Together, this research suggests that OsSAPK8 is a counterpart of AtOST1 for the activation of OsSLAC1, which is a nitrate-selective anion channel.
