The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) induces gene expression via the ABA-response element (ABRE) present in the promoters of ABA-regulated genes. A group of bZIP proteins have been identified as ABRE-binding factors (ABFs) that activate transcription through this cis element. A rice ABF, TRAB1, has been shown to be activated via ABA-dependent phosphorylation. While a large number of signalling factors have been identified that are involved in stomatal regulation by ABA, relatively less is known about the ABA-signalling pathway that leads to gene expression. We have shown recently that three members of the rice SnRK2 protein kinase family, SAPK8, SAPK9 and SAPK10, are activated by ABA signal as well as by hyperosmotic stress. Here we show that transient overexpression in cultured cell protoplasts of these ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinases leads to the activation of an ABRE-regulated promoter, suggesting that these kinases are involved in the gene-regulation pathway of ABA signalling. We further show several lines of evidence that these ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinases directly phosphorylate TRAB1 in response to ABA. Kinetic analysis of SAPK10 activation and TRAB1 phosphorylation indicated that the latter immediately followed the former. TRAB1 was found to be phosphorylated not only in response to ABA, but also in response to hyperosmotic stress, which was interpreted as the consequence of phosphorylation of TRAB1 by hyperosmotically activated SAPKs. Physical interaction between TRAB1 and SAPK10 in vivo was demonstrated by a co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Finally, TRAB1 was phosphorylated in vitro by the ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinases at Ser102, which is phosphorylated in vivo in response to ABA and is critical for the activation function.
tpc1601163.pdf	Differential Activation of the Rice Sucrose Nonfermenting1-Related Protein Kinase2 Family by Hyperosmotic Stress and Abscisic Acid	2004	The Plant Cell Online	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan	To date, a large number of sequences of protein kinases that belong to the sucrose nonfermenting1â€“related protein kinase2 (SnRK2) family are found in databases. However, only limited numbers of the family members have been characterized and implicated in abscisic acid (ABA) and hyperosmotic stress signaling. We identified 10 SnRK2 protein kinases encoded by the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Each of the 10 members was expressed in cultured cell protoplasts, and its regulation was analyzed. Here, we demonstrate that all family members are activated by hyperosmotic stress and that three of them are also activated by ABA. Surprisingly, there were no members that were activated only by ABA. The activation was found to be regulated via phosphorylation. In addition to the functional distinction with respect to ABA regulation, dependence of activation on the hyperosmotic strength was different among the members. We show that the relatively diverged C-terminal domain is mainly responsible for this functional distinction, although the kinase domain also contributes to these differences. The results indicated that the SnRK2 protein kinase family has evolved specifically for hyperosmotic stress signaling and that individual members have acquired distinct regulatory properties, including ABA responsiveness by modifying the C-terminal domain.
NA	Protein kinase OsSAPK8 functions as an essential activator of S-type anion channel OsSLAC1, which is nitrate-selective in rice.	2015	Planta	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200032, China.	OsSAPK8 is an essential activator of OsSLAC1 by phosphorylation, and OsSLAC1 is a nitrate-selective anion channel. S-type anion channel AtSLAC1 and protein kinase AtOST1 have been well-characterized as two core components of ABA signaling cascade in Arabidopsis guard cells, and AtOST1 functions as a main upstream activator of AtSLAC1 for drought stress- and ABA-induced stomata closure. However, the identity of the ortholog of AtOST1 in rice, the main activator of OsSLAC1, is still unknown. Here, we report that protein kinase OsSAPK8 interacts with and activates OsSLAC1 mainly by phosphorylating serine 129 (S129) of OsSLAC1, and this phosphorylating site corresponds to the specific phosphorylating site serine 120 (S120) of AtSLAC1 for AtOST1. Additionally, we found that OsSLAC1 is a nitrate-selective anion channel without obvious permeability to chloride, malate, and sulfate, and the expression of OsSLAC1 in Arabidopsis slac1-3 (atslac1-3) mutant successfully rescued the hypersensitive phenotype of this mutant to drought stress. Together, this research suggests that OsSAPK8 is a counterpart of AtOST1 for the activation of OsSLAC1, which is a nitrate-selective anion channel.
NA	Rice SnRK protein kinase OsSAPK8 acts as a positive regulator in abiotic stress responses.	2019	Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Genetics, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Science, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China.	SnRK2 (sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinases 2) protein kinase family involves in several abiotic stress response in plants. Although the regulatory mechanism of SnRK2 have been well demonstrated in Arabidopsis thaliana, their functions in rice are still largely unknown. Here, we report a SnRK2 family gene, OsSAPK8, can be strongly induced by abiotic stresses, including low-temperature, drought and high salt stress. The ossapk8 mutants showed lower tolerance to low-temperature, high salinity and drought stresses at the vegetative stages. Moreover, the expressions of marker genes for those abiotic stresses, e.g. OsDREB1, OsDREB2, OsNCED and OsRAB21, were downregulated in the ossapk8 mutants. We further confirmed that the yield was reduced in ossapk8 mutant lines compared with the wild type. Our results provide evidence for OsSAPK8 acting as a positive regulator in cold, drought, and salt stress responses.
NA	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice	2020	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China; National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Low temperature is a major environmental factor limiting plant growth and productivity. Although transient elevation of cytoplasmic calcium has long been recognized as a critical signal for plant cold tolerance, the calcium channels responsible for this process have remained largely elusive. Here, we reported that OsCNGC9, a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel, positively regulates chilling tolerance by mediating cytoplasmic calcium elevation in rice (Oryza sativa). We showed that the loss-of-function mutant of OsCNGC9 is defective in cold-induced calcium influx and more sensitive to prolonged cold treatment while OsCNGC9 overexpression confers enhanced cold tolerance. Mechanistically, we showed that in response to chilling stress, OsSAPK8, a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana OST1, phosphorylates and activates OsCNGC9 to trigger Ca2+ influx. In addition, transcription of OsCNGC9 is activated by a rice dehydration responsive element binding transcription factor, OsDREB1A. Together, our results suggested that OsCNGC9 enhances chilling tolerance in rice through regulating cold-induced calcium influx and cytoplasmic calcium elevation.
NA	Exogenous abscisic acid represses rice flowering via SAPK8-ABF1-Ehd1/Ehd2 pathway.	2023	J Adv Res	State key laboratory of rice biology and breeding, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 311400, China.	INTRODUCTION: Rice flowering is a major agronomic trait, determining yield and ecological adaptability in particular regions. ABA plays an essential role in rice flowering, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely elusive. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we demonstrated a &quot;SAPK8-ABF1-Ehd1/Ehd2&quot; pathway, through which exogenous ABA represses rice flowering in a photoperiod-independent manner. METHODS: We generated abf1 and sapk8 mutants using the CRISPR-Cas9 method. Using yeast two-hybrid, Pull down, BiFC and kinase assays, SAPK8 interacted and phosphorylated ABF1. ABF1 directly bound to the promoters of Ehd1 and Ehd2 using ChIP-qPCR, EMSA, and LUC transient transcriptional activity assay, and suppressed the transcription of these genes. RESULTS: Under both long day and short day conditions, simultaneous knock-out of ABF1 and its homolog bZIP40 accelerated flowering, while SAPK8 and ABF1 over-expression lines exhibited delayed flowering and hypersensitivity to ABA-mediated flowering repression. After perceiving the ABA signal, SAPK8 physically binds to and phosphorylates ABF1 to enhance its binding to the promoters of master positive flowering regulators Ehd1 and Ehd2. Upon interacting with FIE2, ABF1 recruited PRC2 complex to deposit H3K27me3 suppressive histone modification on Ehd1 and Ehd2 to suppress these genes transcription, thereby leading to later flowering. CONCLUSION: Our work highlighted the biological functions of SAPK8 and ABF1 in ABA signaling, flowering control and the involvement of a PRC2-mediated epigenetic repression mechanism in the transcription regulation governed by ABF1 on ABA-mediated rice flowering repression.
