OsBIABP1|SLAC1|OsSLAC1	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	Protein kinase OsSAPK8 functions as an essential activator of S-type anion channel OsSLAC1, which is nitrate-selective in rice	Protein kinase OsSAPK8 functions as an essential activator of S-type anion channel OsSLAC1, which is nitrate-selective in rice
OsABIL2	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	Abscisic acid regulates subcellular redistribution of OsABI-LIKE2, a negative regulator in ABA signaling, to control root architecture and drought resistance in Oryza Sativa.	OsABIL2 interacts with OsPYL1, SAPK8 and SAPK10 both in vitro and in vivo, and the phosphatase activity of OsABIL2 was repressed by ABA-bound OsPYL1

OsABIL2 interacts with OsPYL1, SAPK8 and SAPK10 both in vitro and in vivo, and the phosphatase activity of OsABIL2 was repressed by ABA-bound OsPYL1
CDS1|OsCNGC9	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice	 Mechanistically, we showed that in response to chilling stress, OsSAPK8, a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana OST1, phosphorylates and activates OsCNGC9 to trigger Ca2+ influx
OsNAC016	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.
OsNAC016	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.	 Further, OSMOTIC STRESS/ABA-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE8 (SAPK8) phosphorylated OsNAC016 and reduced its stability
OsNAC016	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.	 Our findings establish that OsNAC016 is positively involved in BR-regulated rice architecture, negatively modulates ABA-mediated drought tolerance, and is regulated by GSK2, SAPK8, and OsPUB43 through post-translational modification
Ehd1	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	Exogenous abscisic acid represses rice flowering via SAPK8-ABF1-Ehd1/Ehd2 pathway.	 After perceiving the ABA signal, SAPK8 physically binds to and phosphorylates ABF1 to enhance its binding to the promoters of master positive flowering regulators Ehd1 and Ehd2
Ehd2|RID1	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	Exogenous abscisic acid represses rice flowering via SAPK8-ABF1-Ehd1/Ehd2 pathway.	 After perceiving the ABA signal, SAPK8 physically binds to and phosphorylates ABF1 to enhance its binding to the promoters of master positive flowering regulators Ehd1 and Ehd2
