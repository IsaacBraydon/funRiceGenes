FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	SPP	Duplication of an upstream silencer of FZP increases grain yield in rice.	 The CNV-18bp duplication repressed FZP expression, prolonged the panicle branching period and increased grain yield by more than 15% through substantially increasing the number of spikelets per panicle (SPP) and slightly decreasing the 1,000-grain weight (TGW)
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	SPP	Duplication of an upstream silencer of FZP increases grain yield in rice.	 These findings showed that the silencer CNVs coordinate a trade-off between SPP and TGW by fine-tuning FZP expression, and balancing the trade-off could enhance yield potential
