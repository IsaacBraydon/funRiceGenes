SPP	root	A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development	 The present results reveal that SPP is essential for chloroplast biogenesis at the early growth stage and for rice root development; this is the first report on the function of SPP in monocot plants
SPP	chloroplast	A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development	 Subcellular localization analysis indicates that SPP is targeted to the chloroplast| The expression of some genes associated with chloroplast development was decreased in young seedlings of the spp mutant, but not in 14-day-old seedlings| The present results reveal that SPP is essential for chloroplast biogenesis at the early growth stage and for rice root development; this is the first report on the function of SPP in monocot plants
SPP	seedling	A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development	 The expression of some genes associated with chloroplast development was decreased in young seedlings of the spp mutant, but not in 14-day-old seedlings| Western blot analysis revealed that the Rubisco small subunit is not precisely processed in the spp mutant in 7-day-old seedlings, but the processing activity in the spp mutant is restored in 14-day-old seedlings
