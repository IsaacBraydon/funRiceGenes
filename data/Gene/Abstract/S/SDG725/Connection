BU1|OsbHLH174	SDG725	H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice	Consistently, transcriptome analyses revealed that SDG725 depletion results in down-regulation by more than two-fold of over 1000 genes, including D11, BRI1 and BU1, which are known to be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis or signaling pathways
D11|CPB1|CYP724B1|GNS4|PMM1	SDG725	H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice	Consistently, transcriptome analyses revealed that SDG725 depletion results in down-regulation by more than two-fold of over 1000 genes, including D11, BRI1 and BU1, which are known to be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis or signaling pathways

MRG702	SDG725	MRG702, a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, is involved in brassinosteroid-regulated growth and flowering time control in rice.	Similar to the loss-of-function mutants of the rice H3K36 methyltransferase gene SDG725, the MRG702 knock-down mutants displayed typical BR-deficient mutant and late-flowering phenotypes
MRG702	SDG725	MRG702, a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, is involved in brassinosteroid-regulated growth and flowering time control in rice.	Together, our results demonstrate that MRG702 acts as a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 and deciphers the H3K36 methylation information set by SDG725
SDG725	SIP1|OsSUF4	The transcription factor OsSUF4 interacts with SDG725 in promoting H3K36me3 establishment.	The transcription factor OsSUF4 interacts with SDG725 in promoting H3K36me3 establishment.
SDG725	SIP1|OsSUF4	The transcription factor OsSUF4 interacts with SDG725 in promoting H3K36me3 establishment.	 Here, we show that the transcription factor OsSUF4 recognizes a specific 7-bp DNA element, broadly distributes throughout the rice genome, and recruits the H3K36 methyltransferase SDG725 to target a set of genes including the key florigen genes RFT1 and Hd3a to promote flowering in rice
