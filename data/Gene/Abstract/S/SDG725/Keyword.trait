SDG725	seed	H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice	Here, we report that rice SDG725 encodes a H3K36 methyltransferase, and its down-regulation causes wide-ranging defects, including dwarfism, shortened internodes, erect leaves and small seeds
SDG725	growth	H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice	Taken together, our data indicate that SDG725-mediated H3K36 methylation modulates brassinosteroid-related gene expression, playing an important role in rice plant growth and development
SDG725	erect	H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice	Here, we report that rice SDG725 encodes a H3K36 methyltransferase, and its down-regulation causes wide-ranging defects, including dwarfism, shortened internodes, erect leaves and small seeds
SDG725	dwarf	H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice	Here, we report that rice SDG725 encodes a H3K36 methyltransferase, and its down-regulation causes wide-ranging defects, including dwarfism, shortened internodes, erect leaves and small seeds
SDG725	brassinosteroid	H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice	Consistently, transcriptome analyses revealed that SDG725 depletion results in down-regulation by more than two-fold of over 1000 genes, including D11, BRI1 and BU1, which are known to be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis or signaling pathways
SDG725	brassinosteroid	H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice	Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that levels of H3K36me2/3 are reduced in chromatin at some regions of these brassinosteroid-related genes in SDG725 knockdown plants, and that SDG725 protein is able to directly bind to these target genes
SDG725	brassinosteroid	H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice	Taken together, our data indicate that SDG725-mediated H3K36 methylation modulates brassinosteroid-related gene expression, playing an important role in rice plant growth and development
