By a differential cDNA screening technique, we have isolated a dehydration-inducible gene (designated OSRK1) that encodes a 41.8 kD protein kinase of SnRK2 family from Oryza sativa. The OSRK1 transcript level was undetectable in vegetative tissues, but significantly increased by hyperosmotic stress and Abscisic acid (ABA). To determine its biochemical properties, we expressed and isolated OSRK1 and its mutants as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. In vitro kinase assay showed that OSRK1 can phosphorylate itself and generic substrates as well. Interestingly, OSRK1 showed strong substrate preference for rice bZIP transcription factors and uncommon cofactor requirement for Mn(2+) over Mg(2+). By deletion of C-terminus 73 amino acids or mutations of Ser-158 and Thr-159 to aspartic acids (Asp) in the activation loop, the activity of OSRK1 was dramatically decreased. OSRK1 can transphosphorylate the inactive deletion protein. A rice family of abscisic acid-responsive element (ABRE) binding factor, OREB1 was phosphorylated in vitro by OSRK1 at multiple sites of different functional domains. MALDI-TOF analysis identified a phosphorylation site at Ser44 of OREB1 and mutation of the residue greatly decreased the substrate specificity for OSRK1. The recognition motif for OSRK1, RQSS is highly similar to the consensus substrate sequence of AMPK/SNF1 kinase family. We further showed that OSRK1 interacts with OREB1 in a yeast two-hybrid system and co-localized to nuclei by transient expression analysis of GFP-fused protein in onion epidermis. Finally, ectopic expression of OSRK1 in transgenic tobacco resulted in a reduced sensitivity to ABA in seed germination and root elongation. These findings suggest that OSRK1 is associated with ABA signaling, possibly through the phosphorylation of ABF family in vivo. The interaction between SnRK2 family kinases and ABF transcription factors may constitute an important part of cross-talk mechanism in the stress signaling networks in plants.

MYB-type transcription factors (TFs) play essential roles in plant growth, development and respond to environmental stresses. Role of MYB-related TFs of rice in drought stress tolerance is not well documented. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel MYB-related TF, OsMYB48-1, of rice. Expression of OsMYB48-1 was strongly induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG), abscisic acid (ABA), H2O2, and dehydration, while being slightly induced by high salinity and cold treatment. The OsMYB48-1 protein was localized in the nucleus with transactivation activity at the C terminus. Overexpression of OsMYB48-1 in rice significantly improved tolerance to simulated drought and salinity stresses caused by mannitol, PEG, and NaCl, respectively, and drought stress was caused by drying the soil. In contrast to wild type plants, the overexpression lines exhibited reduced rate of water loss, lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content and higher proline content under stress conditions. Moreover, overexpression plants were hypersensitive to ABA at both germination and post-germination stages and accumulated more endogenous ABA under drought stress conditions. Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of OsMYB48-1 could regulate the expression of some ABA biosynthesis genes (OsNCED4, OsNCED5), early signaling genes (OsPP2C68, OSRK1) and late responsive genes (RAB21, OsLEA3, RAB16C and RAB16D) under drought stress conditions. Collectively, these results suggested that OsMYB48-1 functions as a novel MYB-related TF which plays a positive role in drought and salinity tolerance by regulating stress-induced ABA synthesis.

However, only limited numbers of the family members have been characterized and implicated in abscisic acid (ABA) and hyperosmotic stress signaling. We identified 10 SnRK2 protein kinases encoded by the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Each of the 10 members was expressed in cultured cell protoplasts, and its regulation was analyzed. Here, we demonstrate that all family members are activated by hyperosmotic stress and that three of them are also activated by ABA. Surprisingly, there were no members that were activated only by ABA. The activation was found to be regulated via phosphorylation. In addition to the functional distinction with respect to ABA regulation, dependence of activation on the hyperosmotic strength was different among the members. We show that the relatively diverged C-terminal domain is mainly responsible for this functional distinction, although the kinase domain also contributes to these differences. The results indicated that the SnRK2 protein kinase family has evolved specifically for hyperosmotic stress signaling and that individual members have acquired distinct regulatory properties, including ABA responsiveness by modifying the C-terminal domain.
NA	Co-overexpression of the Constitutively Active Form of OsbZIP46 and ABA-Activated Protein Kinase SAPK6 Improves Drought and Temperature Stress Resistance in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural UniversityWuhan, China.	Drought is one of the major abiotic stresses threatening rice (Oryza sativa) production worldwide. Drought resistance is controlled by multiple genes, and therefore, a multi-gene genetic engineering strategy is theoretically useful for improving drought resistance. However, the experimental evidence for such a strategy is still lacking. In this study, a few drought-responsive genes from rice were assembled by a multiple-round site-specific assembly system, and the constructs were introduced into the rice cultivar KY131 via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The transgenic lines of the multi-gene and corresponding single-gene constructs were pre-evaluated for drought resistance. We found that the co-overexpression of two genes, encoding a constitutively active form of a bZIP transcription factor (OsbZIP46CA1) and a protein kinase (SAPK6) involved in the abscisic acid signaling pathway, showed significantly enhanced drought resistance compared with the single-gene transgenic lines and the negative transgenic plants. Single-copy lines of this bi-gene combination (named XL22) and the corresponding single-gene lines were further evaluated for drought resistance in the field using agronomical traits. The results showed that XL22 exhibited greater yield, biomass, spikelet number, and grain number under moderate drought stress conditions. The seedling survival rate of XL22 and the single-gene overexpressors after drought stress treatment also supported the drought resistance results. Furthermore, expression profiling by RNA-Seq revealed that many genes involved in the stress response were specifically up-regulated in the drought-treated XL22 lines and some of the stress-related genes activated in CA1-OE and SAPK6-OE were distinct, which could partially explain the different performances of these lines with respect to drought resistance. In addition, the XL22 seedlings showed improved tolerance to heat and cold stresses. Our results demonstrate that the multi-gene assembly in an appropriate combination may be a promising approach in the genetic improvement of drought resistance.
NA	Chilling-induced phosphorylation of IPA1 by OsSAPK6 activates chilling tolerance responses in rice.	2022	Cell Discov	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Chilling is a major abiotic stress harming rice development and productivity. The C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR (CBF)-dependent transcriptional regulatory pathway plays a central role in cold stress and acclimation in Arabidopsis. In rice, several genes have been reported in conferring chilling tolerance, however, the chilling signaling in rice remains largely unknown. Here, we report the chilling-induced OSMOTIC STRESS/ABA-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 6 (OsSAPK6)-IDEAL PLANT ARCHITECTURE 1 (IPA1)-OsCBF3 signal pathway in rice. Under chilling stress, OsSAPK6 could phosphorylate IPA1 and increase its stability. In turn, IPA1 could directly bind to the GTAC motif on the OsCBF3 promoter to elevate its expression. Genetic evidence showed that OsSAPK6, IPA1 and OsCBF3 were all positive regulators of rice chilling tolerance. The function of OsSAPK6 in chilling tolerance depended on IPA1, and overexpression of OsCBF3 could rescue the chilling-sensitive phenotype of ipa1 loss-of-function mutant. Moreover, the natural gain-of-function allele ipa1-2D could simultaneously enhance seedling chilling tolerance and increase grain yield. Taken together, our results revealed a chilling-induced OsSAPK6-IPA1-OsCBF signal cascade in rice, which shed new lights on chilling stress-tolerant rice breeding.
