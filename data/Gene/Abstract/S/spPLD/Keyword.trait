spPLD	shoot	A secretory phospholipase D hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to suppress rice heading time.	 Interestingly, rice Hd3a and RFT1 bind to phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and a further analysis by lipidomic approach using mass spectrometry revealed the altered phospholipids profiles in shoot apical meristem, particularly the PC species, under altered spPLD expressions
