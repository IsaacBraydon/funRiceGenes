spPLD	 spPLD overexpression results in delayed heading time which is dependent on its secretory character, while suppression or deficiency of spPLD led to the early heading of rice under both short-day and long-day conditions, which is consistent with that spPLD overexpression/suppression indeed led to the reduced/increased Hd3a/RFT1 (Arabidopsis Flowing Locus T homolog) activities |  Interestingly, rice Hd3a and RFT1 bind to phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and a further analysis by lipidomic approach using mass spectrometry revealed the altered phospholipids profiles in shoot apical meristem, particularly the PC species, under altered spPLD expressions	 spPLD overexpression results in delayed heading time which is dependent on its secretory character, while suppression or deficiency of spPLD led to the early heading of rice under both short-day and long-day conditions, which is consistent with that spPLD overexpression/suppression indeed led to the reduced/increased Hd3a/RFT1 (Arabidopsis Flowing Locus T homolog) activities
