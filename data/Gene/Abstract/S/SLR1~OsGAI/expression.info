SLR1|OsGAI	 We found that the expression of the rice DELLA gene OsSLR1 was down-regulated by an infestation of female adults of the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens
SLR1|OsGAI	 Expression of SLR1 and five key GA biosynthetic genes were disturbed in Slr1-d6 and the interaction between Slr1-d6 and GID1 was decreased
SLR1|OsGAI|OsSLR1	 Moreover, under the low-temperature (LT) condition, the osmkkk62/70 mutant had slightly higher Gibberellin (GA) contents, increased expression of GA biosynthesis genes, and lower protein level of OsSLR1 in anthers than those in WT
