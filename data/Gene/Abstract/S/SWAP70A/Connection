OsSWAP70A	OsSWAP70B	SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice	 Reduction of OsSWAP70A and OsSWAP70B mRNA levels by RNA interference resulted in the suppression of chitin elicitor-induced defense gene expression and ROS production
OsSWAP70A	OsSWAP70B	SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice	 In this study, we found rice homologs of human SWAP70, Oryza sativa (Os) SWAP70A and SWAP70B, containing the DH domain
OsRac1	OsSWAP70A	SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice	 OsSWAP70A interacted with rice Rho GTPase OsRac1, an important signaling factor for immune responses
OsRac1	OsSWAP70A	SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice	 The DH domain of OsSWAP70A exhibited the GEF-catalytic activity toward OsRac1 as found in animal Rho GEFs, indicating that plants have the functional DH domains
OsRac1	OsSWAP70A	SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice	 Transient expression of OsSWAP70A enhanced OsRac1-mediated production of reactive oxygen species in planta
