NA	Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.	2016	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Moderate leaf rolling maintains the erectness of leaves and minimizes the shadowing between leaves which is helpful to establish ideal plant architecture. Here, we describe a srl2 (semi-rolled leaf2) rice mutant, which has incurved leaves due to the presence of defective sclerenchymatous cells on the abaxial side of the leaf and displays narrow leaves and reduced plant height. Map-based cloning revealed that SRL2 encodes a novel plant-specific protein of unknown biochemical function. SRL2 was mainly expressed in the vascular bundles of leaf blades, leaf sheaths, and roots, especially in their sclerenchymatous cells. The transcriptional activities of several leaf development-related YABBY genes were significantly altered in the srl2 mutant. Double mutant analysis suggested that SRL2 and SHALLOT-LIKE1 (SLL1)/ROLLED LEAF9 (RL9) function in distinct pathways that regulate abaxial-side leaf development. Hence, SRL2 plays an important role in regulating leaf development, particularly during sclerenchymatous cell differentiation.
NA	ABNORMAL VASCULAR BUNDLES regulates cell proliferation and procambium cell establishment during aerial organ development in rice.	2016	New Phytol	Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, China.	To understand the molecular mechanisms of rice aerial organ development, we identified a mutant gene that caused a significant decrease in the width of aerial organs, termed ABNORMAL VASCULAR BUNDLES (AVB). Histological analysis showed that the slender aerial organs were caused by cell number reduction. In avb, the number of vascular bundles in aerial organs was reduced, whereas the area of the vascular bundles was increased. Ploidy analysis and the inÂ situ expression patterns of histone H4 confirmed that cell proliferation was impaired during lateral primordia development, whereas procambium cells showed a greater ability to undergo cell division in avb. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that the development process was affected in avb. Map-based cloning and genetic complementation demonstrated that AVB encodes a land plant conserved protein with unknown functions. Our research shows that AVB is involved in the maintenance of the normal cell division pattern in lateral primordia development and that the AVB gene is required for procambium establishment following auxin signaling.
NA	NARROW AND ROLLED LEAF 2 regulates leaf shape, male fertility, and seed size in rice.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	National Center for Evaluation of Agricultural Wild Plants (Rice), Beijing Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Laboratory of Crop Heterosis and Utilization, MOE, Department of Plant Genetics and Breeding, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.	Grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is closely related to leaf and flower development. Coordinative regulation of leaf, pollen, and seed development in rice as a critical biological and agricultural question should to be addressed. Here we identified two allelic rice mutants with narrow and semi-rolled leaves, named narrow and rolled leaf 2-1 (nrl2-1) and nrl2-2. Map-based molecular cloning revealed that NRL2 encodes a novel protein with unknown biochemical function. The mutation of NRL2 caused pleiotropic effects, including a reduction in the number of longitudinal veins, defective abaxial sclerenchymatous cell differentiation, abnormal tapetum degeneration and microspore development, and the formation of more slender seeds compared with the wild type (WT). The NRL2 protein interacted with Rolling-leaf (RL14), causing the leaves of the nrl2 mutants to have a higher cellulose content and lower lignin content than the WT, which may have been related to sclerenchymatous cell differentiation and tapetum degeneration. Thus, this gene is an essential developmental regulator controlling fundamental cellular and developmental processes, serving as a potential breeding target for high-yielding rice cultivars.
