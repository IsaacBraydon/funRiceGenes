RL9|SLL1|AH2	SRL2|AVB|NRL2|NRL3	Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.	Double mutant analysis suggested that SRL2 and SHALLOT-LIKE1 (SLL1)/ROLLED LEAF9 (RL9) function in distinct pathways that regulate abaxial-side leaf development
RL14	SRL2|AVB|NRL2|NRL3	NARROW AND ROLLED LEAF 2 regulates leaf shape, male fertility, and seed size in rice.	The NRL2 protein interacted with Rolling-leaf (RL14), causing the leaves of the nrl2 mutants to have a higher cellulose content and lower lignin content than the WT, which may have been related to sclerenchymatous cell differentiation and tapetum degeneration
SRL2|AVB|NRL2|NRL3	VYL|NAL9	Rice Morphogenesis and Chlorophyll Accumulation Is Regulated by the Protein Encoded by NRL3 and Its Interaction With NAL9.	Rice Morphogenesis and Chlorophyll Accumulation Is Regulated by the Protein Encoded by NRL3 and Its Interaction With NAL9.
