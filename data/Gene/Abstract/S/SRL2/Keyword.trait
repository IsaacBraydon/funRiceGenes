SRL2|AVB|NRL2	leaf	Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.	 Here, we describe a srl2 (semi-rolled leaf2) rice mutant, which has incurved leaves due to the presence of defective sclerenchymatous cells on the abaxial side of the leaf and displays narrow leaves and reduced plant height
SRL2|AVB|NRL2	leaf	Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.	 SRL2 was mainly expressed in the vascular bundles of leaf blades, leaf sheaths, and roots, especially in their sclerenchymatous cells
SRL2|AVB|NRL2	leaf	Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.	 The transcriptional activities of several leaf development-related YABBY genes were significantly altered in the srl2 mutant
SRL2|AVB|NRL2	leaf	Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.	 Double mutant analysis suggested that SRL2 and SHALLOT-LIKE1 (SLL1)/ROLLED LEAF9 (RL9) function in distinct pathways that regulate abaxial-side leaf development
SRL2|AVB|NRL2	leaf	Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.	 Hence, SRL2 plays an important role in regulating leaf development, particularly during sclerenchymatous cell differentiation

SRL2|AVB|NRL2	development	ABNORMAL VASCULAR BUNDLES regulates cell proliferation and procambium cell establishment during aerial organ development in rice.	 RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that the development process was affected in avb
SRL2|AVB|NRL2	development	ABNORMAL VASCULAR BUNDLES regulates cell proliferation and procambium cell establishment during aerial organ development in rice.	 Our research shows that AVB is involved in the maintenance of the normal cell division pattern in lateral primordia development and that the AVB gene is required for procambium establishment following auxin signaling
SRL2|AVB|NRL2	map-based cloning	ABNORMAL VASCULAR BUNDLES regulates cell proliferation and procambium cell establishment during aerial organ development in rice.	 Map-based cloning and genetic complementation demonstrated that AVB encodes a land plant conserved protein with unknown functions
SRL2|AVB|NRL2	cell division	ABNORMAL VASCULAR BUNDLES regulates cell proliferation and procambium cell establishment during aerial organ development in rice.	 Ploidy analysis and the in situ expression patterns of histone H4 confirmed that cell proliferation was impaired during lateral primordia development, whereas procambium cells showed a greater ability to undergo cell division in avb
