SRL2|AVB	leaf	Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.	 Here, we describe a srl2 (semi-rolled leaf2) rice mutant, which has incurved leaves due to the presence of defective sclerenchymatous cells on the abaxial side of the leaf and displays narrow leaves and reduced plant height
SRL2|AVB	leaf	Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.	 SRL2 was mainly expressed in the vascular bundles of leaf blades, leaf sheaths, and roots, especially in their sclerenchymatous cells
SRL2|AVB	leaf	Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.	 The transcriptional activities of several leaf development-related YABBY genes were significantly altered in the srl2 mutant
SRL2|AVB	leaf	Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.	 Double mutant analysis suggested that SRL2 and SHALLOT-LIKE1 (SLL1)/ROLLED LEAF9 (RL9) function in distinct pathways that regulate abaxial-side leaf development
SRL2|AVB	leaf	Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.	 Hence, SRL2 plays an important role in regulating leaf development, particularly during sclerenchymatous cell differentiation

SRL2|AVB	map-based cloning	Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.	 Map-based cloning revealed that SRL2 encodes a novel plant-specific protein of unknown biochemical function
SRL2|AVB	height	Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.	 Here, we describe a srl2 (semi-rolled leaf2) rice mutant, which has incurved leaves due to the presence of defective sclerenchymatous cells on the abaxial side of the leaf and displays narrow leaves and reduced plant height
SRL2|AVB	plant height	Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.	 Here, we describe a srl2 (semi-rolled leaf2) rice mutant, which has incurved leaves due to the presence of defective sclerenchymatous cells on the abaxial side of the leaf and displays narrow leaves and reduced plant height
