qGW8|OsSPL16|GW8	SLG2	SLG2 specifically regulates grain width through WOX11-mediated cell expansion control in rice.	 We also present that finer grains with different widths could be produced by combining SLG2 with the grain width regulator GW8
SLG2	WOX11	SLG2 specifically regulates grain width through WOX11-mediated cell expansion control in rice.	 SLG2 encodes a WD40 domain containing protein, and our biochemical analyses show that SLG2 acts as a transcription activator of its interacting WOX family protein WOX11
SLG2	WOX11	SLG2 specifically regulates grain width through WOX11-mediated cell expansion control in rice.	 We show that knockout of WOX11 results in plants with a slender grain phenotype similar to the slg2 mutant
