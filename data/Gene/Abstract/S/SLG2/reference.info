Grain size is specified by three dimensions of length, width and thickness, and slender grain is a desirable quality trait in rice. Up to now, many grain size regulators have been identified. However, most of these molecules show influence on multi-dimensions of grain development, and only a few of them function specifically in grain width, a key factor determining grain yield and appearance quality. In this study, we identify the SLG2 (SLENDER GUY2) gene that specifically regulates grain width by affecting cell expansion in the spikelet hulls. SLG2 encodes a WD40 domain containing protein, and our biochemical analyses show that SLG2 acts as a transcription activator of its interacting WOX family protein WOX11. We demonstrate that the SLG2-associated WOX11 binds directly to the promoter of OsEXPB7, one of the downstream cell expansion genes. We show that knockout of WOX11 results in plants with a slender grain phenotype similar to the slg2 mutant. We also present that finer grains with different widths could be produced by combining SLG2 with the grain width regulator GW8. Collectively, we uncover the crucial role of SLG2 in grain width control, and provide a promising route to design rice plants with better grain shape and quality.
