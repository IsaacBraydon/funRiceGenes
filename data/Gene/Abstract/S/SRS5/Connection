D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	TID1|SRS5|OsTubA2	Small and round seed 5 gene encodes alpha-tubulin regulating seed cell elongation in rice	Seeds of the double mutant of Srs5 and d61-2 were smaller than those of Srs5 or d61-2
D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	TID1|SRS5|OsTubA2	Small and round seed 5 gene encodes alpha-tubulin regulating seed cell elongation in rice	Furthermore, SRS5 and BRI1 genes were highly expressed in Srs5 and d61-2 mutants
