TID1|SRS5	Overexpression of SRS5 improves grain size of brassinosteroid-related dwarf mutants in rice (Oryza sativa L.). |  In this study, we showed that overexpression of SRS5 can promote grain length and demonstrated that the overexpression of SRS5 in BR-related mutants rescued the shortened grain length, which is an unfavorable phenotype in the yield potential of BR-related mutants, while preserving the useful semi-dwarf and erect leaf phenotypes	Overexpression of SRS5 improves grain size of brassinosteroid-related dwarf mutants in rice (Oryza sativa L.). |  In this study, we showed that overexpression of SRS5 can promote grain length and demonstrated that the overexpression of SRS5 in BR-related mutants rescued the shortened grain length, which is an unfavorable phenotype in the yield potential of BR-related mutants, while preserving the useful semi-dwarf and erect leaf phenotypes
