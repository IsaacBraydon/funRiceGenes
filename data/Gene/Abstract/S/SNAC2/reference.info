The transcription factor OsNAC5 in rice is a member of the plant-specific NAC family that regulates stress responses. Expression of OsNAC5 is induced by abiotic stresses such as drought, cold, high salinity, abscisic acid and methyl jasmonic acid. Transactivation assays using rice protoplasts demonstrated that OsNAC5 is a transcriptional activator, and subcellular localization studies using OsNAC5-GFP fusion proteins showed that it is localized to the nucleus. Pull-down assays revealed that OsNAC5 interacts with OsNAC5, OsNAC6 and SNAC1. To analyze the function of OsNAC5 in rice plants, we generated transgenic plants that overexpressed OsNAC5. The growth of these plants was similar to that of control plants, whereas the growth of OsNAC6-overexpressing transgenic plants was retarded. OsNAC5-overexpressing transgenic plants also had improved tolerance to high salinity compared to control plants. By microarray analysis, many stress-inducible genes, including the "late embryogenesis abundant" gene OsLEA3, were upregulated in rice plants that overexpressed OsNAC5. By gel mobility shift assay, OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 were shown to bind to the OsLEA3 promoter. Collectively, our results indicate that the stress-responsive proteins OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 are transcriptional activators that enhance stress tolerance by upregulating the expression of stress-inducible rice genes such as OsLEA3, although the effects of these proteins on growth are different. Furthermore, because OsNAC5 overexpression did not retard growth, OsNAC5 may be a useful gene that can improve the stress tolerance of rice without affecting its growth.
80_135.pdf	OsNAC6, a member of the NAC gene family, is induced by various stresses in rice	2005	Genes Genet Syst	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo	Members of the NAC gene family encode plant-specific transcription factors and are widely distributed in plant species. The OsNAC6 gene is one of many NAC genes in rice and has high similarity to genes in the ATAF subfamily. Here we show that OsNAC6 is induced by cold, salt, drought and abscisic acid (ABA). We found that OsNAC6 is also induced by wounding. The response of OsNAC6 to wounding is very rapid and strong. OsNAC6 was also induced by jasmonic acid (JA), a plant hormone that activates defense responses against herbivores and pathogens. Our results imply that OsNAC6, besides having a role in plant adaptation to abiotic stresses, also integrates signals derived from both abiotic and biotic stresses.
HuHH_PMB_2008.pdf	Characterization of transcription factor gene SNAC2 conferring cold and salt tolerance in rice	2008	Plant Mol Biol	National Center of Plant Gene Research Wuhan, National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	Plants respond to adverse environment by initiating a series of signaling processes including activation of transcription factors that can regulate expression of arrays of genes for stress response and adaptation. NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) is a plant specific transcription factor family with diverse roles in development and stress regulation. In this report, a stress-responsive NAC gene (SNAC2) isolated from upland rice IRA109 (Oryza sativa L. ssp japonica) was characterized for its role in stress tolerance. SNAC2 was proven to have transactivation and DNA-binding activities in yeast and the SNAC2-GFP fusion protein was localized in the rice nuclei. Northern blot and SNAC2 promoter activity analyses suggest that SNAC2 gene was induced by drought, salinity, cold, wounding, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. The SNAC2 gene was over-expressed in japonica rice Zhonghua 11 to test the effect on improving stress tolerance. More than 50% of the transgenic plants remained vigorous when all WT plants died after severe cold stress (4-8 degrees C for 5 days). The transgenic plants had higher cell membrane stability than wild type during the cold stress. The transgenic rice had significantly higher germination and growth rate than WT under high salinity conditions. Over-expression of SNAC2 can also improve the tolerance to PEG treatment. In addition, the SNAC2-overexpressing plants showed significantly increased sensitivity to ABA. DNA chip profiling analysis of transgenic plants revealed many up-regulated genes related to stress response and adaptation such as peroxidase, ornithine aminotransferase, heavy metal-associated protein, sodium/hydrogen exchanger, heat shock protein, GDSL-like lipase, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase. Interestingly, none of the up-regulated genes in the SNAC2-overexpressing plants matched the genes up-regulated in the transgenic plants over-expressing other stress responsive NAC genes reported previously. These data suggest SNAC2 is a novel stress responsive NAC transcription factor that possesses potential utility in improving stress tolerance of rice.

The OsNAC6 gene is a member of the NAC transcription factor gene family in rice. Expression of OsNAC6 is induced by abiotic stresses, including cold, drought and high salinity. OsNAC6 gene expression is also induced by wounding and blast disease. A transactivation assay using a yeast system demonstrated that OsNAC6 functions as a transcriptional activator, and transient localization studies with OsNAC6-sGFP fusion protein revealed its nuclear localization. Transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsNAC6 constitutively exhibited growth retardation and low reproductive yields. These transgenic rice plants showed an improved tolerance to dehydration and high-salt stresses, and also exhibited increased tolerance to blast disease. By utilizing stress-inducible promoters, such as the OsNAC6 promoter, it is hoped that stress-inducible over-expression of OsNAC6 in rice can improve stress tolerance by suppressing the negative effects of OsNAC6 on growth under normal growth conditions. The results of microarray analysis revealed that many genes that are inducible by abiotic and biotic stresses were upregulated in rice plants over-expressing OsNAC6. A transient transactivation assay showed that OsNAC6 activates the expression of at least two genes, including a gene encoding peroxidase. Collectively, these results indicate that OsNAC6 functions as a transcriptional activator in response to abiotic and biotic stresses in plants. We conclude that OsNAC6 may serve as a useful biotechnological tool for the improvement of stress tolerance in various kinds of plants.
j.1365-313X.2009.03908.x.pdf	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice	2009	The Plant Journal	School of Biotechnology and Environmental Engineering, Myongji University, Yongin, Korea.	We have previously isolated a rice gene encoding a histone deacetylase, OsHDAC1, and observed that its transgenic overexpression increases seedling root growth. To identify the transcriptional repression events that occur as a result of OsHDAC1 overexpression (OsHDAC1(OE)), a global profiling of root-expressed genes was performed on OsHDAC1(OE) or HDAC inhibitor-treated non-transgenic (NT) roots, in comparison with untreated NT roots. We selected 39 genes that are induced and repressed in HDAC inhibitor-treated NT and OsHDAC1(OE) roots, compared with NT roots, respectively. Interestingly, OsNAC6, a member of the NAM-ATAF-CUC (NAC) family, was identified as a key component of the OsHDAC1 regulon, and was found to be epigenetically repressed by OsHDAC1 overexpression. The root phenotype of OsNAC6 knock-out seedlings was observed to be similar to that of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings. Conversely, the root phenotype of the OsNAC6 overexpressors was similar to that of the OsHDAC1 knock-out seedlings. These observations indicate that OsHDAC1 negatively regulates the OsNAC6 gene that primarily mediates the alteration in the root growth of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of the OsNAC6 promoter region using antibodies specific to acetylated histones H3 and H4 revealed that OsHDAC1 epigenetically represses the expression of OsNAC6 by deacetylating K9, K14 and K18 on H3 and K5, K12 and K16 on H4.
NA	The rice OsNAC6 transcription factor orchestrates multiple molecular mechanisms involving root structural adaptions and nicotianamine biosynthesis for drought tolerance.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	Graduate School of International Agricultural Technology and Crop Biotechnology Institute/GreenBio Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Pyeongchang, 25354, Korea.	Drought has a serious impact on agriculture worldwide. A plant's ability to adapt to rhizosphere drought stress requires reprograming of root growth and development. Although physiological studies have documented the root adaption for tolerance to the drought stress, underlying molecular mechanisms is still incomplete, which is essential for crop engineering. Here, we identified OsNAC6-mediated root structural adaptations, including increased root number and root diameter, which enhanced drought tolerance. Multiyear drought field tests demonstrated that the grain yield of OsNAC6 root-specific overexpressing transgenic rice lines was less affected by drought stress than were non-transgenic controls. Genome-wide analyses of loss- and gain-of-function mutants revealed that OsNAC6 up-regulates the expression of direct target genes involved in membrane modification, nicotianamine (NA) biosynthesis, glutathione relocation, 3'-phophoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate accumulation, and glycosylation, which represent multiple drought tolerance pathways. Moreover, overexpression of NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE genes, direct targets of OsNAC6, promoted the accumulation of the metal chelator NA and, consequently, drought tolerance. Collectively, OsNAC6 orchestrates novel molecular drought tolerance mechanisms and has potential for the biotechnological development of high-yielding crops under water limiting conditions.
