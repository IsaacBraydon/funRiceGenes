OsHDAC1	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice	Interestingly, OsNAC6, a member of the NAM-ATAF-CUC (NAC) family, was identified as a key component of the OsHDAC1 regulon, and was found to be epigenetically repressed by OsHDAC1 overexpression
OsHDAC1	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice	The root phenotype of OsNAC6 knock-out seedlings was observed to be similar to that of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings
OsHDAC1	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice	Conversely, the root phenotype of the OsNAC6 overexpressors was similar to that of the OsHDAC1 knock-out seedlings
OsHDAC1	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice	These observations indicate that OsHDAC1 negatively regulates the OsNAC6 gene that primarily mediates the alteration in the root growth of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings
OsHDAC1	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice	Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of the OsNAC6 promoter region using antibodies specific to acetylated histones H3 and H4 revealed that OsHDAC1 epigenetically represses the expression of OsNAC6 by deacetylating K9, K14 and K18 on H3 and K5, K12 and K16 on H4

OsNAC6|SNAC2	OsTZF5	Expression of the CCCH-tandem zinc finger protein gene OsTZF5 under a stress-inducible promoter mitigates the effect of drought stress on rice grain yield under field conditions.	 By introducing OsTZF5 behind the stress-responsive OsNAC6 promoter in two commercial upland cultivars, Curinga and NERICA4, we obtained transgenic plants that showed no growth retardation
OsFLP	OsNAC6|SNAC2	A Rice R2R3-Type MYB Transcription Factor OsFLP Positively Regulates Drought Stress Response via OsNAC.	 The yeast-one-hybrid assay indicated that OsFLP can specifically bind and positively regulate OsNAC1 and OsNAC6
OsFLP	OsNAC6|SNAC2	A Rice R2R3-Type MYB Transcription Factor OsFLP Positively Regulates Drought Stress Response via OsNAC.	 These findings suggested that OsFLP positively participates in drought stress, mainly through regulating regulators&#x27; transcripts of OsNAC1 and OsNAC6
OsNAC5	OsNAC6|SNAC2	Enhanced expression of OsNAC5 leads to up-regulation of OsNAC6 and changes rice (Oryza sativa L.) ionome.	Enhanced expression of OsNAC5 leads to up-regulation of OsNAC6 and changes rice (Oryza sativa L.) ionome.
OsNAC5	OsNAC6|SNAC2	Enhanced expression of OsNAC5 leads to up-regulation of OsNAC6 and changes rice (Oryza sativa L.) ionome.	 In addition, we evaluated the expression level of OsNAC6, which is co-expressed with OsNAC5, and found that enhanced expression of OsNAC5 leads to increased expression of OsNAC6, suggesting that OsNAC5 might regulate OsNAC6 expression
