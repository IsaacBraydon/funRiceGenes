Snl6	Xoo	Rice Snl6, a cinnamoyl-CoA reductase-like gene family member, is required for NH1-mediated immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae	We show that Snl6 is required for NH1-mediated resistance to Xoo.
Snl6	resistance	Rice Snl6, a cinnamoyl-CoA reductase-like gene family member, is required for NH1-mediated immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae	While both lines are susceptible to inoculation with Xoo, snl6-RGT plants developed longer lesions suggesting that Snl6 contributes to resistance in Nipponbare
