SDS|OsSDS	flower	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens
SDS|OsSDS	flower	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	Because rice and Arabidopsis, respectively, are members of monocots and eudicots, two largest groups of flowering plants, our results suggest that the functions of SDS and RCK are likely conserved in flowering plants
SDS|OsSDS	fertility	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens
SDS|OsSDS	sterile	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens
SDS|OsSDS	vegetative	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens
SDS|OsSDS	meiosis	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	The Arabidopsis SDS (SOLO DANCERS) and RCK (ROCK-N-ROLLERS) genes are important for male meiosis, but it is still unknown whether they represent conserved functions in plants
SDS|OsSDS	meiosis	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice
SDS|OsSDS	pollen	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens
SDS|OsSDS	pollen	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	SDS deficiency also caused a decrease in pollen amounts
SDS|OsSDS	meiotic	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	Further cytological examination of male meiocytes revealed that the SDS deficiency led to defects in homolog interaction and bivalent formation in meiotic prophase I, and RCK deficiency resulted in defective meiotic crossover formation
SDS|OsSDS	meiotic	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice
SDS|OsSDS	growth	OsSDS is essential for DSB formation in rice meiosis.	The Ossds mutant is normal in vegetative growth but both male and female gametes are inviable
SDS|OsSDS	vegetative	OsSDS is essential for DSB formation in rice meiosis.	The Ossds mutant is normal in vegetative growth but both male and female gametes are inviable
SDS|OsSDS	meiotic	OsSDS is essential for DSB formation in rice meiosis.	No Î³H2AX immunosignals in Ossds meiocytes together with the suppression of chromosome fragmentation in Ossds-1 Osrad51c, both provide strong evidences that OsSDS is essential for meiotic DSB formation
SDS|OsSDS	meiotic	OsSDS is essential for DSB formation in rice meiosis.	Immunostaining investigations revealed that meiotic chromosome axes are normally formed but both SC installation and localization of recombination elements are failed in Ossds
