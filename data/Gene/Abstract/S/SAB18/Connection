OsNHX1	SAB18|OsGTgamma-2	The trihelix transcription factor OsGT¦Ã-2 is involved adaption to salt stress in rice.	 Several major genes responsible for ion transporting, such as the OsHKT2; 1, OsHKT1; 3 and OsNHX1 were transcriptionally regulated by OsGT¦Ã-2
OsNHX1	SAB18|OsGTgamma-2	The trihelix transcription factor OsGT¦Ã-2 is involved adaption to salt stress in rice.	 A subsequent yeast one-hybrid assay and EMSA indicated that OsGT¦Ã-2 directly interacted with the promoters of OsHKT2; 1, OsNHX1 and OsHKT1; 3
OsRAV2	SAB18|OsGTgamma-2	The trihelix transcription factor OsGT¦Ã-2 is involved adaption to salt stress in rice.	 Here, we identified a rice OsGT¦Ã family member, OsGT¦Ã-2, which directly interacted with the GT-1 element in the OsRAV2 promoter
