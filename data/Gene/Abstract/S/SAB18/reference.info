NA	Towards establishment of a rice stress response interactome.	2011	PLoS Genet	Department of Plant Pathology, University of California Davis, Davis, California, United States of America.	Rice (Oryza sativa) is a staple food for more than half the world and a model for studies of monocotyledonous species, which include cereal crops and candidate bioenergy grasses. A major limitation of crop production is imposed by a suite of abiotic and biotic stresses resulting in 30%-60% yield losses globally each year. To elucidate stress response signaling networks, we constructed an interactome of 100 proteins by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays around key regulators of the rice biotic and abiotic stress responses. We validated the interactome using protein-protein interaction (PPI) assays, co-expression of transcripts, and phenotypic analyses. Using this interactome-guided prediction and phenotype validation, we identified ten novel regulators of stress tolerance, including two from protein classes not previously known to function in stress responses. Several lines of evidence support cross-talk between biotic and abiotic stress responses. The combination of focused interactome and systems analyses described here represents significant progress toward elucidating the molecular basis of traits of agronomic importance.
NA	The trihelix transcription factor OsGT¦Ã-2 is involved adaption to salt stress in rice.	2020	Plant Mol Biol.	College of Agronomy, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, 230036, China.	OsGT¦Ã-2, a trihelix transcription factor, is a positive regulator of rice responses to salt stress by regulating the expression of ion transporters. Salinity stress seriously restricts rice growth and yield. Trihelix transcription factors (GT factors) specifically bind to GT elements and play a diverse role in plant morphological development and responses to abiotic stresses. In our previous study, we found that the GT-1 element (GAAAAA) is a key element in the salinity-induced OsRAV2 promoter. Here, we identified a rice OsGT¦Ã family member, OsGT¦Ã-2, which directly interacted with the GT-1 element in the OsRAV2 promoter. OsGT¦Ã-2 specifically targeted the nucleus, was mainly expressed in roots, sheathes, stems and seeds, and was induced by salinity, osmotic and oxidative stresses and abscisic acid (ABA). The seed germination rate, seedling growth and survival rate under salinity stress was improved in OsGT¦Ã-2 overexpressing lines (PZmUbi::OsGT¦Ã-2). In contrast, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated OsGT¦Ã-2 knockout lines (osgt¦Ã-2) showed salt-hypersensitive phenotypes. In response to salt stress, different Na+ and K+ acclamation patterns were observed in PZmUbi::OsGT¦Ã-2 lines and osgt¦Ã-2 plants were observed. The molecular mechanism of OsGT¦Ã-2 in rice salt adaptation was also investigated. Several major genes responsible for ion transporting, such as the OsHKT2; 1, OsHKT1; 3 and OsNHX1 were transcriptionally regulated by OsGT¦Ã-2. A subsequent yeast one-hybrid assay and EMSA indicated that OsGT¦Ã-2 directly interacted with the promoters of OsHKT2; 1, OsNHX1 and OsHKT1; 3. Taken together, these results suggest that OsGT¦Ã-2 is an important positive regulator involved in rice responses to salt stress and suggest a potential role for OsGT¦Ã-2 in regulating salinity adaptation in rice.
