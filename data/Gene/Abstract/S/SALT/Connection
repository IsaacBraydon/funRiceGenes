OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	SALT	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.
OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	SALT	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.	 Suppression of OsJAZ9 resulted in reduced salt tolerance
OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	SALT	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.	 These results together suggest that OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator by forming a transcriptional regulation complex with OsNINJA and OsbHLH to fine tune the expression of JA-responsive genes involved in salt stress tolerance in rice
