ONAC022	SALT	Overexpression of a Stress-Responsive NAC Transcription Factor Gene ONAC022 Improves Drought and Salt Tolerance in Rice.	Overexpression of a Stress-Responsive NAC Transcription Factor Gene ONAC022 Improves Drought and Salt Tolerance in Rice.
ONAC022	SALT	Overexpression of a Stress-Responsive NAC Transcription Factor Gene ONAC022 Improves Drought and Salt Tolerance in Rice.	 Three independent transgenic rice lines with overexpression of ONAC022 were generated and used to explore the function of ONAC022 in drought and salt stress tolerance
ONAC022	SALT	Overexpression of a Stress-Responsive NAC Transcription Factor Gene ONAC022 Improves Drought and Salt Tolerance in Rice.	 Our data demonstrate that ONAC022 functions as a stress-responsive NAC with transcriptional activator activity and plays a positive role in drought and salt stress tolerance through modulating an ABA-mediated pathway
OsOTS1	SALT	Rice OVERLY TOLERANT TO SALT 1(OTS1) SUMO protease is a positive regulator of seed germination and root development.	 We recently identified the SUMO protease gene family in rice and demonstrated a role for OsOTS1 SUMO proteases in salt stress
OsSIRP1	SALT	Molecular dissection of Oryza sativa salt-induced RING finger protein 1 (OsSIRP1): possible involvement in the sensitivity response to salinity stress.	 Transcript levels of OsSIRP1 in rice leaves after various stress treatments, including salt, heat, drought, and hormone (ABA), were observed
