OsCPK12	SALT	A rice calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK12 oppositely modulates salt-stress tolerance and blast disease resistance	 OsCPK12-overexpressing (OsCPK12-OX) plants exhibited increased tolerance to salt stress| These results suggest that OsCPK12 promotes tolerance to salt stress by reducing the accumulation of ROS| Collectively, our results suggest that OsCPK12 functions in multiple signaling pathways, positively regulating salt tolerance and negatively modulating blast resistance|A rice calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK12 oppositely modulates salt-stress tolerance and blast disease resistance
OsHAK5	SALT	The role of a potassium transporter OsHAK5 in potassium acquisition and transport from roots to shoots in rice at low potassium supply levels.	 Overexpression of OsHAK5 increased the K-sodium concentration ratio in the shoots and salt stress tolerance (shoot growth), while knockout of OsHAK5 decreased the K-sodium concentration ratio in the shoots, resulting in sensitivity to salt stress
OsMKK1	SALT	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	 In this study, we found that the transcript of a rice (Oryza sativa) MAPKK (OsMKK1) was markedly increased by salt stress
OsMKK1	SALT	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	 By examining the survival rate and Na(+) content in shoot, we found that OsMKK1-knockout (osmkk1) mutant was more sensitive to salt stress than the wild type
OsMKK1	SALT	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	 OsMKK1 activity in the wild-type seedlings and protoplasts was increased by salt stress
OsMKK1	SALT	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	 OsMPK4 activity was increased by salt, which was impaired in osmkk1 plants
OsMKK1	SALT	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	 Taken together, the data suggest that OsMKK1 and OsMPK4 constitute a signaling pathway that regulates salt stress tolerance in rice
