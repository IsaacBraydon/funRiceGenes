Asano-2012-A rice calcium-depen.pdf	A rice calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK12 oppositely modulates salt-stress tolerance and blast disease resistance	2012	Plant J	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan. tasano@affrc.go.jp	Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) regulate the downstream components in calcium signaling pathways. We investigated the effects of overexpression and disruption of an Oryza sativa (rice) CDPK (OsCPK12) on the plant's response to abiotic and biotic stresses. OsCPK12-overexpressing (OsCPK12-OX) plants exhibited increased tolerance to salt stress. The accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ) in the leaves was less in OsCPK12-OX plants than in wild-type (WT) plants. Genes encoding reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes (OsAPx2 and OsAPx8) were more highly expressed in OsCPK12-OX plants than in WT plants, whereas the expression of the NADPH oxidase gene, OsrbohI, was decreased in OsCPK12-OX plants compared with WT plants. Conversely, a retrotransposon (Tos17) insertion mutant, oscpk12, and plants transformed with an OsCPK12 RNA interference (RNAi) construct were more sensitive to high salinity than were WT plants. The level of H(2) O(2) accumulation was greater in oscpk12 and OsCPK12 RNAi plants than in the WT. These results suggest that OsCPK12 promotes tolerance to salt stress by reducing the accumulation of ROS. We also observed that OsCPK12-OX seedlings had increased sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) and increased susceptibility to blast fungus, probably resulting from the repression of ROS production and/or the involvement of OsCPK12 in the ABA signaling pathway. Collectively, our results suggest that OsCPK12 functions in multiple signaling pathways, positively regulating salt tolerance and negatively modulating blast resistance.
Claes-1990-Characterization of.pdf	Characterization of a rice gene showing organ-specific expression in response to salt stress and drought	1990	Plant Cell	Laboratorium voor Genetica, Rijksuniversiteit Gent, Belgium.	Protein changes induced by salinity stress were investigated in the roots of the salt-sensitive rice cultivar Taichung native 1. We found eight proteins to be induced and obtained partial sequences of one with a molecular mass of 15 kilodaltons and an isoelectric point of 5.5. Using an oligonucleotide probe based on this information, a cDNA clone, salT, was selected and found to contain an open reading frame coding for a protein of 145 amino acid residues. salT mRNA accumulates very rapidly in sheaths and roots from mature plants and seedlings upon treatment with Murashige and Skoog salts (1%), air drying, abscisic acid (20 microM), polyethylene glycol (5%), sodium chloride (1%), and potassium chloride (1%). Generally, no induction was seen in the leaf lamina even when the stress should affect all parts of the plant uniformly. The organ-specific response of salT is correlatable with the pattern of Na+ accumulation during salt stress.
Fukao-2011-The submergence tole.pdf	The submergence tolerance regulator SUB1A mediates crosstalk between submergence and drought tolerance in rice	2011	Plant Cell	Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, Center for Plant Cell Biology, University of California, Riverside, California 92521, USA.	Submergence and drought are major constraints to rice (Oryza sativa) production in rain-fed farmlands, both of which can occur sequentially during a single crop cycle. SUB1A, an ERF transcription factor found in limited rice accessions, dampens ethylene production and gibberellic acid responsiveness during submergence, economizing carbohydrate reserves and significantly prolonging endurance. Here, we evaluated the functional role of SUB1A in acclimation to dehydration. Comparative analysis of genotypes with and without SUB1A revealed that SUB1A enhanced recovery from drought at the vegetative stage through reduction of leaf water loss and lipid peroxidation and increased expression of genes associated with acclimation to dehydration. Overexpression of SUB1A augmented ABA responsiveness, thereby activating stress-inducible gene expression. Paradoxically, vegetative tissue undergoes dehydration upon desubmergence even though the soil contains sufficient water, indicating that leaf desiccation occurs in the natural progression of a flooding event. Desubmergence caused the upregulation of gene transcripts associated with acclimation to dehydration, with higher induction in SUB1A genotypes. SUB1A also restrained accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aerial tissue during drought and desubmergence. Consistently, SUB1A increased the abundance of transcripts encoding ROS scavenging enzymes, resulting in enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress. Therefore, in addition to providing robust submergence tolerance, SUB1A improves survival of rapid dehydration following desubmergence and water deficit during drought.

A rice gene encoding a calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK), OsCDPK7, was induced by cold and salt stresses. To elucidate the physiological function of OsCDPK7, we generated transgenic rice plants with altered levels of the protein. The extent of tolerance to cold and salt/drought stresses of these plants correlated well with the level of OsCDPK7 expression. Therefore, OsCDPK7 was shown to be a positive regulator commonly involved in the tolerance to both stresses in rice. Over-expression of OsCDPK7 enhanced induction of some stress-responsive genes in response to salinity/drought, but not to cold. Thus, it was suggested that the downstream pathways leading to the cold and salt/drought tolerance are different from each other. It seems likely that at least two distinct pathways commonly use a single CDPK, maintaining the signalling specificity through unknown post-translational regulation mechanisms. These results demonstrate that simple manipulation of CDPK activity has great potential with regard to plant improvement.
j.1742-4658.2007.05658.x.pdf	Biochemical characterization of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases supports distinctive functions of these plant enzymes	2007	FEBS J	Crop Cold Tolerance Research Team, National Agricultural Research Center for Hokkaido Region, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, Hitsujigaoka 1, Toyohira-ku, Sapporo 062-8555, Japan.	Substantial levels of trehalose accumulate in bacteria, fungi, and invertebrates, where it serves as a storage carbohydrate or as a protectant against environmental stresses. In higher plants, trehalose is detected at fairly low levels; therefore, a regulatory or signaling function has been proposed for this molecule. In many organisms, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase is the enzyme governing the final step of trehalose biosynthesis. Here we report that OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 are the two major trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase genes expressed in vegetative tissues of rice. Similar to results obtained from our previous OsTPP1 study, complementation analysis of a yeast trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase mutant and activity measurement of the recombinant protein demonstrated that OsTPP2 encodes a functional trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enzyme. OsTPP2 expression is transiently induced in response to chilling and other abiotic stresses. Enzymatic characterization of recombinant OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 revealed stringent substrate specificity for trehalose 6-phosphate and about 10 times lower K(m) values for trehalose 6-phosphate as compared with trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enzymes from microorganisms. OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 also clearly contrasted with microbial enzymes, in that they are generally unstable, almost completely losing activity when subjected to heat treatment at 50 degrees C for 4 min. These characteristics of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enzymes are consistent with very low cellular substrate concentration and tightly regulated gene expression. These data also support a plant-specific function of trehalose biosynthesis in response to environmental stresses.
Sharma-2013-Exogenous applicatio.pdf	Exogenous application of brassinosteroid offers tolerance to salinity by altering stress responses in rice variety Pusa Basmati-1	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	Department of Biotechnology, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar 143005, Punjab, India. ishashrikhand@yahoo.com	Plant steroidal hormones, brassinosteroids, play a pivotal role in variety of plant developmental processes and adaptation to various environmental stresses. The present work investigates the response of various stress markers upon exogenous application of 24-epibrassinolide (EBL) on Pusa Basmati-1, a commercially important rice variety, under salt stress conditions. Rice seeds after treatment with different concentrations of NaCl alone or in combination with different concentrations of 24-epibrassinolide (EBL) were analysed for various growth parameters, protein, proline and malondialdehyde content (MDA) and antioxidant enzymes activities. The seedlings exposed to NaCl exhibited a significant decline in growth parameters and changes in the levels of antioxidant enzymes, however, treatment with EBL showed an improvement in growth, levels of protein and proline content and antioxidant enzymes activity. The enhanced levels of MDA content during salt stress in rice seedlings was decreased with EBL treatment. Further, the treatment with EBL increased the expression of various oxidative stress marker genes, although to different levels. Expression of various brassinosteroids (OsBRI1, OsDWF4) and salt (SalT) responsive genes, revealed the down regulation of OsDWF4 with application of EBL and upregulation of SalT in presence of salt stress thereby confirming the efficacy of the treatments. Interestingly, a significant down regulation of SalT gene was observed on application of EBL along with salt compared to salt treatment alone. On the other hand, the application of EBL alone and in combination with salt has resulted in upregulation of OsBRI1.
Tseng-1995-Identification of su.pdf	Identification of sucrose-regulated genes in cultured rice cells using mRNA differential display	1995	Gene	Institute of Life Science, National Tsing-Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan 300, ROC	In order to get more information about carbon metabolite regulation pathways, cloning and sequence analysis of sucrose-regulated genes from rice-suspension-cultured cells were performed. We used a new method, mRNA differential display, to screen differentially expressed genes under conditions of 3% and no sucrose in the cultured medium. Six candidate clones were identified and sequenced. Clones SI1 and SI2 were repressed by sucrose starvation, while clones SR1, SR2, SR3 and SR4 were induced by sucrose starvation. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that clone SR2 has 94.8% homology to the salT gene, and clones SI1 and SR3 show 88.3 and 96.9% identity, respectively, to partial cDNA sequences in the GenBank database. The results suggest that mRNA differential display provides an easy and quick way to clone genes involved in the carbon metabolite regulation pathway.
NA	A Magnaporthe Chitinase Interacts with a Rice Jacalin-related Lectin to Promote Host Colonization.	2019	Plant Physiol	Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University CITY: Fuzhou China [CN].	The genome of rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae) encodes fifteen GH_18 family chitinases. In this study we characterized the function of a M. oryzae extracellular chitinase, MoChi1, and its interaction with a host protein, OsMBL1, a jacalin-related Mannose-Binding Lectin in rice (Oryza sativa). Deletion of MoChi1 resulted in reduced aerial hyphal formation and reduced virulence in rice by activating the expression of defense-responsive genes. We confirmed MoChi1 interaction with rice OsMBL1 in vitro and in vivo. OsMBL1 was induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns and M. oryzae infection. Overexpression of OsMBL1 led to activation of rice defense responsive genes and a chitin-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, thereby enhancing resistance to M. oryzae. Knockdown of OsMBL1 enhances susceptibility of rice plants to M. oryzae. Furthermore, MoChi1 suppressed chitin-induced ROS in rice cells and competed with OsMBL1 for chitin binding. Taken together, our study reveals a mechanism in which MoChi1 targets a host lectin to suppress rice immunity.
