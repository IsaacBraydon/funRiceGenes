sps1|SPS	growth	Identification of a new gene controlling plant height in rice using the candidate-gene strategy	 In agreement with this hypothesis, transgenic rice plants with a maize SPS gene that had about 3 times the SPS activity of that in Nipponbare (control plants) were significantly taller than Nipponbare from the early growth stage

sps1|SPS	height	Identification of a new gene controlling plant height in rice using the candidate-gene strategy	 The higher level of SPS transcripts and the activity of SPS in NIL6 compared to control plants, and the fact that the relative SPS activity per SPS protein content was almost the same between NIL6 and Nipponbare suggested that the higher plant height in NIL6 compared to Nipponbare was due to the high SPS activity in NIL6
