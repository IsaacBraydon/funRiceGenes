NA	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.	2018	New Phytol	CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, School of Life Sciences, University of Science &amp; Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230027, China.	Flowering time (heading date) in rice (Oryza sativa) is an important agronomic trait that determines yield. The levels of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) modulated by TRITHORAX-like proteins regulate gene transcription, flowering time and environmental stress responses. However, plant TRITHORAX-like proteins have no known DNA-binding domain, and therefore the mechanism that gives sequence specificity to these proteins remains unclear. Here, we show that the rice TRITHORAX-like protein OsTrx1 is recruited to its target, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), by the C2H2 zinc finger protein SDG723/OsTrx1/OsSET33 Interaction Protein 1 (SIP1). SIP1 binds to the promoter of Ehd1 and interacts with OsTrx1. Mutations in SIP1 led to a late heading date under long-day and short-day conditions. Defects in OsTrx1 or SIP1 led to reduced H3K4me3 levels at Ehd1, thus reducing Ehd1 expression. Together, our results show that the transcription factor SIP1 interacts with OxTrx1, allowing OsTrx1 to specifically target Ehd1, altering H3K4me3 levels, increasing Ehd1 expression and thereby promoting flowering.
NA	The transcription factor OsSUF4 interacts with SDG725 in promoting H3K36me3 establishment.	2019	Nat Commun	Department of Biochemistry, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development, International Associated Laboratory of CNRS-Fudan-HUNAU on Plant Epigenome Research, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, 200438, Shanghai, China.	The different genome-wide distributions of tri-methylation at H3K36 (H3K36me3) in various species suggest diverse mechanisms for H3K36me3 establishment during evolution. Here, we show that the transcription factor OsSUF4 recognizes a specific 7-bp DNA element, broadly distributes throughout the rice genome, and recruits the H3K36 methyltransferase SDG725 to target a set of genes including the key florigen genes RFT1 and Hd3a to promote flowering in rice. Biochemical and structural analyses indicate that several positive residues within the zinc finger domain are vital for OsSUF4 function in planta. Our results reveal a regulatory mechanism contributing to H3K36me3 distribution in plants.
NA	Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant. In addition to serving as a model plant for molecular genetic studies of monocots, rice is a staple crop for about half of the world population. Heading date is a critical agronomic trait, and many genes controlling heading date have been cloned during the last two decades. The mechanism of flowering in rice from recognition of day length by leaves to floral activation in the shoot apical meristem has been extensively studied. In this review, we summarize current progress on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice with emphasis on post-translational modifications of key regulators, including Heading Date 1 (Hd1), Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Grain Number, Plant Height, and Heading Date7 (Ghd7). The contribution of heading date genes to heterosis and the expansion of rice cultivation areas from low-latitude to high-latitude regions are also discussed. To overcome limitations of diverse genetic backgrounds used in heading date studies and to gain a clearer understanding of flowering in rice, we propose a systematic collection of genetic resources in a common genetic background. Strategies in breeding adapted cultivars by rational design are also discussed.
