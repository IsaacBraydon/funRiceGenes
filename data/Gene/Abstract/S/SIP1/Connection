Ehd1	SIP1	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.
Ehd1	SIP1	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.	 Here, we show that the rice TRITHORAX-like protein OsTrx1 is recruited to its target, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), by the C2H2 zinc finger protein SDG723/OsTrx1/OsSET33 Interaction Protein 1 (SIP1)
Ehd1	SIP1	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.	 SIP1 binds to the promoter of Ehd1 and interacts with OsTrx1
Ehd1	SIP1	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.	 Defects in OsTrx1 or SIP1 led to reduced H3K4me3 levels at Ehd1, thus reducing Ehd1 expression
Ehd1	SIP1	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.	 Together, our results show that the transcription factor SIP1 interacts with OxTrx1, allowing OsTrx1 to specifically target Ehd1, altering H3K4me3 levels, increasing Ehd1 expression and thereby promoting flowering
