SIP1|OsSUF4	transcription factor	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.	 Together, our results show that the transcription factor SIP1 interacts with OxTrx1, allowing OsTrx1 to specifically target Ehd1, altering H3K4me3 levels, increasing Ehd1 expression and thereby promoting flowering
SIP1|OsSUF4	heading date	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.	 Mutations in SIP1 led to a late heading date under long-day and short-day conditions
SIP1|OsSUF4	flowering time	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.
