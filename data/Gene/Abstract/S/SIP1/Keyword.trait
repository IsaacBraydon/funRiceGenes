SIP1|OsSUF4	transcription factor	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.	 Together, our results show that the transcription factor SIP1 interacts with OxTrx1, allowing OsTrx1 to specifically target Ehd1, altering H3K4me3 levels, increasing Ehd1 expression and thereby promoting flowering
SIP1|OsSUF4	heading date	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.	 Mutations in SIP1 led to a late heading date under long-day and short-day conditions
SIP1|OsSUF4	flowering time	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.
SIP1|OsSUF4	transcription factor	The transcription factor OsSUF4 interacts with SDG725 in promoting H3K36me3 establishment.	The transcription factor OsSUF4 interacts with SDG725 in promoting H3K36me3 establishment.
SIP1|OsSUF4	transcription factor	The transcription factor OsSUF4 interacts with SDG725 in promoting H3K36me3 establishment.	 Here, we show that the transcription factor OsSUF4 recognizes a specific 7-bp DNA element, broadly distributes throughout the rice genome, and recruits the H3K36 methyltransferase SDG725 to target a set of genes including the key florigen genes RFT1 and Hd3a to promote flowering in rice
SIP1|OsSUF4	zinc	The transcription factor OsSUF4 interacts with SDG725 in promoting H3K36me3 establishment.	 Biochemical and structural analyses indicate that several positive residues within the zinc finger domain are vital for OsSUF4 function in planta
SIP1|OsSUF4	methyltransferase	The transcription factor OsSUF4 interacts with SDG725 in promoting H3K36me3 establishment.	 Here, we show that the transcription factor OsSUF4 recognizes a specific 7-bp DNA element, broadly distributes throughout the rice genome, and recruits the H3K36 methyltransferase SDG725 to target a set of genes including the key florigen genes RFT1 and Hd3a to promote flowering in rice
