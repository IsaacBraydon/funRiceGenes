SRWD3	shoot	SRWD: a novel WD40 protein subfamily regulated by salt stress in rice (OryzasativaL.)	For SRWD3, it showed higher expression level in shoot and endosperm.
SRWD3	endosperm	SRWD: a novel WD40 protein subfamily regulated by salt stress in rice (OryzasativaL.)	For SRWD3, it showed higher expression level in shoot and endosperm.
SRWD3	abiotic stress	SRWD: a novel WD40 protein subfamily regulated by salt stress in rice (OryzasativaL.)	Finally, we found SRWD3 specifically contained RSRE which was a recently identified cis-acting element that rapidly responds to biotic and abiotic stress
