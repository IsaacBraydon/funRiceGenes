SRWD3	shoot	SRWD: a novel WD40 protein subfamily regulated by salt stress in rice (OryzasativaL.)	For SRWD3, it showed higher expression level in shoot and endosperm.
SRWD3	endosperm	SRWD: a novel WD40 protein subfamily regulated by salt stress in rice (OryzasativaL.)	For SRWD3, it showed higher expression level in shoot and endosperm.
SRWD3	abiotic stress	SRWD: a novel WD40 protein subfamily regulated by salt stress in rice (OryzasativaL.)	Finally, we found SRWD3 specifically contained RSRE which was a recently identified cis-acting element that rapidly responds to biotic and abiotic stress
SRWD3	biotic stress	SRWD: a novel WD40 protein subfamily regulated by salt stress in rice (OryzasativaL.)	Finally, we found SRWD3 specifically contained RSRE which was a recently identified cis-acting element that rapidly responds to biotic and abiotic stress
SRWD3	cellular activities	SRWD: a novel WD40 protein subfamily regulated by salt stress in rice (OryzasativaL.)	The higher accumulations for SRWD2 and SRWD3 mRNAs in all rice tissues detected suggested they might play basic roles in maintaining cellular activities, such as cytoskeletal dynamics, protein trafficking, nuclear export, ribosomal RNA biogenesis and chromatin modification and transcription
