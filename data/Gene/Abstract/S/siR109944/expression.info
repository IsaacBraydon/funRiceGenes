siR109944	 We screened rice<U+00A0>(Oryza sativa) sRNA expression patterns against Rhizoctonia solani and found that Tourist-miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE)-derived small interfering RNA (siRNA) (herein referred to as siR109944) expression was obviously suppressed upon R |  Additionally, multiple agronomic traits of rice, including root length and flag leaf inclination, were affected by siR109944 expression
