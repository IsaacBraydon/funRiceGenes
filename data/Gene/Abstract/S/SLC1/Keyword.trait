SLC1	leaf	Two dioxygenases, SLC1 and SLC2, play essential roles in shoot development of rice.	 Down-regulation of SLC1 and SLC2 at the same time in the SLC1-SLC2 RNAi lines resulted in a severe defect in early leaf development
SLC1	leaf development	Two dioxygenases, SLC1 and SLC2, play essential roles in shoot development of rice.	 Down-regulation of SLC1 and SLC2 at the same time in the SLC1-SLC2 RNAi lines resulted in a severe defect in early leaf development
SLC1	shoot	Two dioxygenases, SLC1 and SLC2, play essential roles in shoot development of rice.	Two dioxygenases, SLC1 and SLC2, play essential roles in shoot development of rice.
SLC1	shoot	Two dioxygenases, SLC1 and SLC2, play essential roles in shoot development of rice.	 Here, we report that two dioxygenase-encoding genes, SLC1 (slender and crinklyleaf 1) and SLC2 (slender and crinklyleaf 2), play essential roles in shoot development and SA production in rice (Oryza sativa)
SLC1	shoot	Two dioxygenases, SLC1 and SLC2, play essential roles in shoot development of rice.	 Collectively, our data revealed the importance of SLC1 and SLC2 in the shoot development of rice

SLC1	dwarf	Two dioxygenases, SLC1 and SLC2, play essential roles in shoot development of rice.	 Disruption of SLC1 or SLC2 led to dwarf plants
SLC1	 sa 	Two dioxygenases, SLC1 and SLC2, play essential roles in shoot development of rice.	 Here, we report that two dioxygenase-encoding genes, SLC1 (slender and crinklyleaf 1) and SLC2 (slender and crinklyleaf 2), play essential roles in shoot development and SA production in rice (Oryza sativa)
SLC1	 sa 	Two dioxygenases, SLC1 and SLC2, play essential roles in shoot development of rice.	 Enhanced SA level in the SLC1-OE plants and decreased SA level in the slc1 and slc2 mutants were scored
