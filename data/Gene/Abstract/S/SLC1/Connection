OSH1|Oskn1	SLC1	Two dioxygenases, SLC1 and SLC2, play essential roles in shoot development of rice.	 The results from exploring the putative interacting proteins for SLC1 indicated that, either the KNOX1- or ELK-domain of OSH1 (homeobox1) is sufficient for accomplishing the interaction between SLC1 and OSH1
OsSLC1	SLC1	OsSLC1 Encodes a Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Essential for Early Chloroplast Development and Seedling Survival.	 Map-based cloning of OsSLC1 revealed that a single base (G) deletion was detected in the first exon of Os06g0710800 in the slc1 mutant, which caused a premature stop codon
OsSLC1	SLC1	OsSLC1 Encodes a Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Essential for Early Chloroplast Development and Seedling Survival.	 Knockout and complementation experiments further confirmed that OsSLC1 is responsible for the seedling-lethal chlorosis phenotype in the slc1 mutant
