OSH1|Oskn1	SLC1	Two dioxygenases, SLC1 and SLC2, play essential roles in shoot development of rice.	 The results from exploring the putative interacting proteins for SLC1 indicated that, either the KNOX1- or ELK-domain of OSH1 (homeobox1) is sufficient for accomplishing the interaction between SLC1 and OSH1
