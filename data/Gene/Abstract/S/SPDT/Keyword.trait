SPDT	xylem	Reducing phosphorus accumulation in rice grains with an impaired transporter in the node.	 SPDT is expressed in the xylem region of both enlarged- and diffuse-vascular bundles of the nodes, and encodes a plasma-membrane-localized transporter for phosphorus
SPDT	vascular bundle	Reducing phosphorus accumulation in rice grains with an impaired transporter in the node.	 SPDT is expressed in the xylem region of both enlarged- and diffuse-vascular bundles of the nodes, and encodes a plasma-membrane-localized transporter for phosphorus
SPDT	transporter	Reducing phosphorus accumulation in rice grains with an impaired transporter in the node.	 SPDT is expressed in the xylem region of both enlarged- and diffuse-vascular bundles of the nodes, and encodes a plasma-membrane-localized transporter for phosphorus
SPDT	phosphorus	Reducing phosphorus accumulation in rice grains with an impaired transporter in the node.	 SPDT is expressed in the xylem region of both enlarged- and diffuse-vascular bundles of the nodes, and encodes a plasma-membrane-localized transporter for phosphorus
SPDT	phosphorus	Reducing phosphorus accumulation in rice grains with an impaired transporter in the node.	 These results indicate that SPDT functions in the rice node as a switch to allocate phosphorus preferentially to the grains
SPDT	node	Reducing phosphorus accumulation in rice grains with an impaired transporter in the node.	 These results indicate that SPDT functions in the rice node as a switch to allocate phosphorus preferentially to the grains
