NA	A very-long-chain fatty acid synthesis gene, SD38, influences plant height by activating ethylene biosynthesis in rice.	2022	Plant J	Rice Research Institute, Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, People&#x27;s Republic of China.	As an important trait in crop breeding, plant height is associated with lodging resistance and yield. With the identification and cloning of several semi-dwarfing genes, increasing numbers of semi-dwarf cultivars have emerged, which has led to a &#x27;green revolution&#x27; in rice (Oryza sativa) production. In this study, we identified a rice semi-dwarf mutant, semi-dwarf 38 (sd38), which showed significantly reduced cell length. SD38 encodes a fatty acid elongase, Î²-ketoacyl-CoA synthase, which is involved in the synthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). Expression analysis showed that SD38 was localized on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, and was expressed in all analyzed tissues with differential abundance. The mutation of SD38 affected lipid metabolism in the sd38 mutant. A functional complementarity test in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated that SD38 was capable of complementing the deficiency of ELO3p activity in BY4741-elo3 knockout yeast cells by participating in the synthesis of C24:0 VLCFA. Significant changes were observed in the expression of genes involved in ethylene synthesis, which resulted in reduced content of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) in the sd38 mutant. Exogenously supplied VLCFA (C24:0) increased the expression levels of OsACS3, OsACS4, and OsACO7 and the plant height of sd38 mutant seedlings, similar to the effect of exogenous application of ACC and ethephon. These results reveal a relationship among VLCFAs, ethylene biosynthesis, and plant height and improve our understanding of plant height development in crops.
