SD38	ethylene	A very-long-chain fatty acid synthesis gene, SD38, influences plant height by activating ethylene biosynthesis in rice.	 Significant changes were observed in the expression of genes involved in ethylene synthesis, which resulted in reduced content of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) in the sd38 mutant
SD38	height	A very-long-chain fatty acid synthesis gene, SD38, influences plant height by activating ethylene biosynthesis in rice.	 Exogenously supplied VLCFA (C24:0) increased the expression levels of OsACS3, OsACS4, and OsACO7 and the plant height of sd38 mutant seedlings, similar to the effect of exogenous application of ACC and ethephon
