NA	Short Panicle 3 controls panicle architecture by upregulating APO2/RFL and increasing cytokinin content in rice.	2018	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Lab of Crop Genetic improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Inflorescence architecture is a major determinant of spikelet numbers per panicle, a key component of grain yield in rice. In this study, Short Panicle 3 (SP3) was identified from a short panicle 3 (sp3) mutant in which T-DNA was inserted in the promoter of SP3, resulting in a knockdown mutation. SP3 encodes a DNA binding with one finger (Dof) transcriptional activator. Quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR and RNA in situ hybridization assays confirmed that SP3 is preferentially expressed in the young rice inflorescence, specifically in the branch primordial regions. SP3 acts as a negative regulator of inflorescence meristem abortion by upregulating APO2/RFL. SP3 both up- and down-regulates expression of genes involved in cytokinin biosynthesis and catabolism, respectively. Consequently, cytokinin concentrations are decreased in young sp3 panicles, thereby leading to small panicles having fewer branches and spikelets. Our findings support a model in which SP3 regulates panicle architecture by modulating cytokinin homeostasis. Potential applications to rice breeding, through gene-editing of the SP3 promoter are assessed.
NA	Identification and characterization of the first cytokinin glycosyltransferase from rice.	2019	Rice (N Y)	College of Pharmacy, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng, 252000, Shandong, China.	Cytokinins are one of the five major hormones families in plants and are important for their normal growth and environmental adaptability. In plants, cytokinins are mostly present as glycosides in plants, and their glycosylation modifications are catalyzed by family 1 glycosyltransferases. Current research on cytokinin glycosylation has focused on the biochemical identification of enzymes and the analysis of metabolites in Arabidopsis. There are few studies that examine how cytokinin glycosylation affects its synthesis and accumulation in plants. It is particularly important to understand these processes in food crops such as rice (Oryza sativa); however, to date, cytokinin glycosyltransferase genes in rice have not been reported.In this study, we identified eight rice genes that were functionally homologous to an Arabidopsis cytokinin glycosyltransferase gene. These genes were cloned and expressed in a prokaryotic system to obtain their purified proteins. Through enzymatic analysis and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, a single rice glycosyltransferase, Os6, was identified that glycosylated cytokinin in vitro. Os6 was overexpressed in Arabidopsis, and the extraction of cytokinin glycosides showed that Os6 is functionally active in planta.The identification and characterization of the first cytokinin glycosyltransferase from rice is important for future studies on the cytokinin metabolic pathway in rice. An improved understanding of rice cytokinin glycosyltransferases may facilitate genetic improvements in rice quality.
