SP3|OsDOF15	panicle	Short Panicle 3 controls panicle architecture by upregulating APO2/RFL and increasing cytokinin content in rice.	 Our findings support a model in which SP3 regulates panicle architecture by modulating cytokinin homeostasis
SP3|OsDOF15	cytokinin	Short Panicle 3 controls panicle architecture by upregulating APO2/RFL and increasing cytokinin content in rice.	 SP3 both up- and down-regulates expression of genes involved in cytokinin biosynthesis and catabolism, respectively
SP3|OsDOF15	cytokinin	Short Panicle 3 controls panicle architecture by upregulating APO2/RFL and increasing cytokinin content in rice.	 Consequently, cytokinin concentrations are decreased in young sp3 panicles, thereby leading to small panicles having fewer branches and spikelets
SP3|OsDOF15	cytokinin	Short Panicle 3 controls panicle architecture by upregulating APO2/RFL and increasing cytokinin content in rice.	 Our findings support a model in which SP3 regulates panicle architecture by modulating cytokinin homeostasis
SP3|OsDOF15	meristem	Short Panicle 3 controls panicle architecture by upregulating APO2/RFL and increasing cytokinin content in rice.	 SP3 acts as a negative regulator of inflorescence meristem abortion by upregulating APO2/RFL
SP3|OsDOF15	inflorescence	Short Panicle 3 controls panicle architecture by upregulating APO2/RFL and increasing cytokinin content in rice.	 SP3 acts as a negative regulator of inflorescence meristem abortion by upregulating APO2/RFL
SP3|OsDOF15	architecture	Short Panicle 3 controls panicle architecture by upregulating APO2/RFL and increasing cytokinin content in rice.	 Our findings support a model in which SP3 regulates panicle architecture by modulating cytokinin homeostasis
SP3|OsDOF15	homeostasis	Short Panicle 3 controls panicle architecture by upregulating APO2/RFL and increasing cytokinin content in rice.	 Our findings support a model in which SP3 regulates panicle architecture by modulating cytokinin homeostasis
SP3|OsDOF15	panicle architecture	Short Panicle 3 controls panicle architecture by upregulating APO2/RFL and increasing cytokinin content in rice.	 Our findings support a model in which SP3 regulates panicle architecture by modulating cytokinin homeostasis
SP3|OsDOF15	transcriptional activator	Short Panicle 3 controls panicle architecture by upregulating APO2/RFL and increasing cytokinin content in rice.	 SP3 encodes a DNA binding with one finger (Dof) transcriptional activator
