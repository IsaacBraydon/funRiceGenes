NA	The Receptor-Like Kinase SIT1 Mediates Salt Sensitivity by Activating MAPK3/6 and Regulating Ethylene Homeostasis in Rice	2014	Plant Cell	Hebei Key Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Hebei 050024, P.R.

High salinity causes growth inhibition and shoot bleaching in plants that do not tolerate high salt (glycophytes), including most crops. The molecules affected directly by salt and linking the extracellular stimulus to intracellular responses remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that rice (Oryza sativa) Salt Intolerance 1 (SIT1), a lectin receptor-like kinase expressed mainly in root epidermal cells, mediates salt sensitivity. NaCl rapidly activates SIT1, and in the presence of salt, as SIT1 kinase activity increased, plant survival decreased. Rice MPK3 and MPK6 function as the downstream effectors of SIT1. SIT1 phosphorylates MPK3 and 6, and their activation by salt requires SIT1. SIT1 mediates ethylene production and salt-induced ethylene signaling. SIT1 promotes accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to growth inhibition and plant death under salt stress, which occurred in an MPK3/6- and ethylene signaling-dependent manner in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our findings demonstrate the existence of a SIT1-MPK3/6 cascade that mediates salt sensitivity by affecting ROS and ethylene homeostasis and signaling. These results provide important information for engineering salt-tolerant crops.
NA	Mutual regulation of receptor-like kinase SIT1 and B'κ-PP2A shapes the early response of rice to salt stress.	2019	Plant Cell	Hebei Key Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology CITY: Shijiazhuang STATE: Hebei China [CN].	The receptor-like kinase SIT1 acts as a sensor in rice roots, relaying salt stress signals via elevated kinase activity to enhance salt sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate that Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulatory subunit B'κ constrains SIT1 activity under salt stress. B'κ-PP2A deactivates SIT1 directly by dephosphorylating the kinase at Thr515/516, a salt-induced phosphorylation site in the activation loop that is essential for SIT1 activity. B'κ overexpression suppresses the salt sensitivity of rice plants expressing high levels of SIT1, thereby contributing to salt tolerance. B'κ functions in a SIT1 kinase-dependent manner. During early salt stress, activated SIT1 phosphorylates B'κ; this not only enhances its binding with SIT1, it also promotes B'κ protein accumulation via Ser502 phosphorylation. Consequently, by blocking SIT1 phosphorylation, B'κ inhibits and fine tunes SIT1 activity to balance plant growth and stress adaptation.
