OsCCT38|OsPRR59	SDG724|lvp1	Crosstalk between the Circadian Clock and Histone Methylation.	 Furthermore, we identified three candidate targets (OsGI, OsCCT38, and OsPRR95) of OsLHY and one candidate target (OsCRY1a) of SDG724 in the clock pathway
OsCRY1a	SDG724|lvp1	Crosstalk between the Circadian Clock and Histone Methylation.	 Furthermore, we identified three candidate targets (OsGI, OsCCT38, and OsPRR95) of OsLHY and one candidate target (OsCRY1a) of SDG724 in the clock pathway
OsGI	SDG724|lvp1	Crosstalk between the Circadian Clock and Histone Methylation.	 Furthermore, we identified three candidate targets (OsGI, OsCCT38, and OsPRR95) of OsLHY and one candidate target (OsCRY1a) of SDG724 in the clock pathway
OsLHY	SDG724|lvp1	Crosstalk between the Circadian Clock and Histone Methylation.	 Previously, we reported that SDG724 and OsLHY are two rice heading date regulators in rice
OsLHY	SDG724|lvp1	Crosstalk between the Circadian Clock and Histone Methylation.	 SDG724 encodes a histone H3K36 methyltransferase, and OsLHY is a vital circadian rhythm transcription factor
OsLHY	SDG724|lvp1	Crosstalk between the Circadian Clock and Histone Methylation.	 To explore the crosstalk between the circadian clock and histone methylation in rice, we studied the relationship between OsLHY and SDG724 via the transcriptome analysis of their single and double mutants, oslhy, sdg724, and oslhysdg724
OsLHY	SDG724|lvp1	Crosstalk between the Circadian Clock and Histone Methylation.	 Screening of overlapped DEGs and KEGG pathways between OsLHY and SDG724 revealed that they could control many overlapped pathways indirectly
OsLHY	SDG724|lvp1	Crosstalk between the Circadian Clock and Histone Methylation.	 Furthermore, we identified three candidate targets (OsGI, OsCCT38, and OsPRR95) of OsLHY and one candidate target (OsCRY1a) of SDG724 in the clock pathway
OsLHY	SDG724|lvp1	Crosstalk between the Circadian Clock and Histone Methylation.	 Our results showed a regulatory relationship between OsLHY and SDG724, which paved the way for revealing the interaction between the circadian clock and histone H3K36 methylation
OsPRR95	SDG724|lvp1	Crosstalk between the Circadian Clock and Histone Methylation.	 Furthermore, we identified three candidate targets (OsGI, OsCCT38, and OsPRR95) of OsLHY and one candidate target (OsCRY1a) of SDG724 in the clock pathway
