Chromatin modifications affect flowering time in the long-day plant Arabidopsis thaliana, but the role of histone methylation in flowering time regulation of rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant, remains to be elucidated. We identified a late-flowering long vegetative phase1 (lvp1) mutant in rice and used map-based cloning to reveal that lvp1 affects the SET domain group protein 724 (SDG724). SDG724 functions as a histone methyltransferase in vitro and contributes to a major fraction of global histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) methylation in vivo. Expression analyses of flowering time genes in wild-type and lvp1 mutants revealed that Early heading date1, but not Heading date1, are misregulated in lvp1 mutants. In addition, the double mutant of lvp1 with photoperiod sensitivity5 (se5) flowered later than the se5 single mutant, indicating that lvp1 delays flowering time irrespective of photoperiod. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that lvp1 had reduced levels of H3K36me2/3 at MADS50 and RFT1. This suggests that the divergent functions of paralogs RFT1 and Hd3a, and of MADS50 and MADS51, are in part due to differential H3K36me2/3 deposition, which also correlates with higher expression levels of MADS50 and RFT1 in flowering promotion in rice.
NA	Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant. In addition to serving as a model plant for molecular genetic studies of monocots, rice is a staple crop for about half of the world population. Heading date is a critical agronomic trait, and many genes controlling heading date have been cloned during the last two decades. The mechanism of flowering in rice from recognition of day length by leaves to floral activation in the shoot apical meristem has been extensively studied. In this review, we summarize current progress on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice with emphasis on post-translational modifications of key regulators, including Heading Date 1 (Hd1), Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Grain Number, Plant Height, and Heading Date7 (Ghd7). The contribution of heading date genes to heterosis and the expansion of rice cultivation areas from low-latitude to high-latitude regions are also discussed. To overcome limitations of diverse genetic backgrounds used in heading date studies and to gain a clearer understanding of flowering in rice, we propose a systematic collection of genetic resources in a common genetic background. Strategies in breeding adapted cultivars by rational design are also discussed.
NA	Crosstalk between the Circadian Clock and Histone Methylation.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.	The circadian clock and histone modifications could form a feedback loop in Arabidopsis; whether a similar regulatory mechanism exists in rice is still unknown. Previously, we reported that SDG724 and OsLHY are two rice heading date regulators in rice. SDG724 encodes a histone H3K36 methyltransferase, and OsLHY is a vital circadian rhythm transcription factor. Both could be involved in transcription regulatory mechanisms and could affect gene expression in various pathways. To explore the crosstalk between the circadian clock and histone methylation in rice, we studied the relationship between OsLHY and SDG724 via the transcriptome analysis of their single and double mutants, oslhy, sdg724, and oslhysdg724. Screening of overlapped DEGs and KEGG pathways between OsLHY and SDG724 revealed that they could control many overlapped pathways indirectly. Furthermore, we identified three candidate targets (OsGI, OsCCT38, and OsPRR95) of OsLHY and one candidate target (OsCRY1a) of SDG724 in the clock pathway. Our results showed a regulatory relationship between OsLHY and SDG724, which paved the way for revealing the interaction between the circadian clock and histone H3K36 methylation.
