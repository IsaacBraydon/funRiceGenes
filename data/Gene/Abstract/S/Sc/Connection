OsCLR1|DSNP1	Sc	The E3 ubiquitin ligase DESYNAPSIS1 regulates synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis.	 Here, we reveal that a functional RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, DESYNAPSIS1 (DSNP1), plays significant roles in SC assembly and homologous recombination during rice meiosis
OsCLR1|DSNP1	Sc	The E3 ubiquitin ligase DESYNAPSIS1 regulates synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis.	 Collectively, DSNP1 stabilizes the canonical tripartite SC structure along paired homologous chromosomes and further promotes the formation of COs
