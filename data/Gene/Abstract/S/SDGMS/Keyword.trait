SDGMS	stress	Spontaneous movement of a retrotransposon generated genic dominant male sterility providing a useful tool for rice breeding.	 The activation of SDGMS triggers transcription reprogramming of genes responsive to biotic stress leading to a hypersensitive response which causes sterility
SDGMS	anther	Spontaneous movement of a retrotransposon generated genic dominant male sterility providing a useful tool for rice breeding.	 We found that spontaneous movement of a 1978-bp long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon into the promoter region of the SDGMS gene activates its expression in anther tapetum, which causes abnormal programmed cell death of tapetal cells resulting in dominant male sterility
SDGMS	sterility	Spontaneous movement of a retrotransposon generated genic dominant male sterility providing a useful tool for rice breeding.	 Here we characterized the Sanming Dominant Genic Male Sterility in rice and identified the gene SDGMS using a map-based cloning approach
