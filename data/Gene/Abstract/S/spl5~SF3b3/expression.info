spl5|SF3b3	 Interestingly, according to our microarray and real-time PCR assays, the expressions of a transcription factor OsWRKY14 and genes responsible for the biosynthesis of serotonin, anthranilate synthase (AS), indole-3-glycerolphosphate synthase (IGPS), tryptophan synthase (TS) and tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) were significantly up-regulated in the spl5 mutant
spl5|SF3b3	 Expression analysis of 7 candidate genes lying within this region across SD, CP and two low P susceptible rice genotypes has revealed that expression of four genes including SPL4, SPL5, ACA9 and MLO8 is significantly upregulated only in SD under low P conditions |  In CP, there is low expression of MLO8 under low P conditions, whereas SPL4, SPL5 and Os02g08120 are downregulated
