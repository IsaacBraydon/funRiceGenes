Previously, the spl5 gene was already mapped to the 80-kb region between two markers SSR7 and RM7121 through a map-based cloning approach. Here, we further showed that the spl5 gene was delimitated into a 15.1-kb genomic region by the high-resolution sequence target site (STS) markers. Subsequent sequencing in this region of spl5 mutant revealed that one candidate gene harbored a single-base deletion, resulting in a frame-shift mutation and a premature stop codon. Bioinformatic analysis showed that SPL5 gene encodes a putative splicing factor 3b subunit 3 (SF3b3) and might be involved in splicing reactions of pre-mature RNAs participating in the regulation of cell death and resistance responses. Further analysis showed that wild-type SPL5 did functionally complement the spl5 phenotype. The data presented here clearly indicate that the SPL5 negatively regulates cell death and resistance responses via modulating RNA splicing in plants.
NA	Transcriptome profiling of the spl5 mutant reveals that SPL5 has a negative role in the biosynthesis of serotonin for rice disease resistance.	2015	Rice (N Y)	College of Chemistry &amp; Life Sciences, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua, 321004 China.	Rice mutant, spl5 (spotted leaf 5), has spontaneous hypersensitive-like lesions on its leaves and shows enhanced resistance to pathogens, indicating that SPL5 plays a role in programmed cell death (PCD) and disease resistance. To understand the molecular mechanism of SPL5 gene, we investigated the transcriptome profiles of the spl5 mutant leaves with few lesions (FL) and leaves with many lesions (ML) compared to the wild-type (WT) leaves respectively by microarray.The data from microarray revealed that 243 and 896 candidate genes (Fold change ≥ 3.0) were up- or down-regulated in the spl5-FL and spl5-ML, respectively, and a large number of these genes involved in biotic defense responses or reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. Interestingly, according to our microarray and real-time PCR assays, the expressions of a transcription factor OsWRKY14 and genes responsible for the biosynthesis of serotonin, anthranilate synthase (AS), indole-3-glycerolphosphate synthase (IGPS), tryptophan synthase (TS) and tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) were significantly up-regulated in the spl5 mutant. It has been reported previously that TS and TDC expressions are regulated by OsWRKY14 in rice, which raises the possibility that OsWRKY14 regulates serotonin production through the up-regulation of TS and TDC. Our HPLC analysis further confirmed that serotonin levels were higher in the leaves of spl5 mutant than that in WT.Since the serotonin plays a critical role in inducing disease-resistance, the increased serotonin level may contribute, at least partly, to the disease resistance in spl5. The SPL5 gene may act as a negative regulatory factor activating the serotonin metabolic pathway, and these results might provide a new insight into the spl5-induced defense response mechanisms in plants.
NA	A 1.84-Mb region on rice chromosome 2 carrying SPL4, SPL5 and MLO8 genes is associated with higher yield under phosphorus-deficient acidic soil	2021	J Appl Genet	School of Crop Improvement, College of Post Graduate Studies in Agricultural Sciences, Central Agricultural University (Imphal), Umiam, Meghalaya, India.	Phosphorus (P) deficiency is one of the major limiting factors for rice productivity with only one locus (PSTOL1) available for field based application. A biparental mapping population (F6) derived from two P deficiency tolerant genotypes (Sahbhagi Dhan (SD) (PSTOL1+) and Chakhao Poreiton (CP) (PSTOL1-)), in which, transcriptome data generated from our lab had previously shown existence of diverse mechanisms was used to identify novel regions for better yield under lowland acidic soils. Phenotyping at F4, F5 and F6 generations revealed significant correlation between traits like tiller number at 30 days (TN 30), tiller number at 60 days (TN 60), filled grains (FG), percent spikelet fertility (SF%), panicle number (PN) and grain yield per panicle (GYPP) and also association with better yield/performance under low P acidic soil conditions. Through selected genotyping on a set of forty superior and inferior lines using SSR, candidate gene-based and SNP polymorphic markers, 5 genomic regions associated with various yield-related traits were identified. Marker trait association studies revealed 13 markers significantly associated with yield attributing traits and PUE under lowland acidic field conditions. Chi-square and regression analyses of markers run on the entire population identified seven and six markers for SF% and GYPP, respectively, and two for biological yield with positive allele derived from SD which constitute a novel 1.847-Mb region on chromosome 2 flanked by two markers RM12550 and PR9-2. Expression analysis of 7 candidate genes lying within this region across SD, CP and two low P susceptible rice genotypes has revealed that expression of four genes including SPL4, SPL5, ACA9 and MLO8 is significantly upregulated only in SD under low P conditions. In CP, there is low expression of MLO8 under low P conditions, whereas SPL4, SPL5 and Os02g08120 are downregulated. In the case of the two susceptible genotypes, there is no expression of Os02g08120 either in optimum or limiting conditions. Sequence data across a panel of 3024 rice genotypes also suggests that there is polymorphism for these differentially expressed genes. The genes and underlying markers identified on chromosome 2 will be key to imparting tolerance to low P in diverse genetic backgrounds and for marker-assisted selection for higher yield under lowland acidic conditions.
