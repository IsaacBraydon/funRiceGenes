However, only limited numbers of the family members have been characterized and implicated in abscisic acid (ABA) and hyperosmotic stress signaling. We identified 10 SnRK2 protein kinases encoded by the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Each of the 10 members was expressed in cultured cell protoplasts, and its regulation was analyzed. Here, we demonstrate that all family members are activated by hyperosmotic stress and that three of them are also activated by ABA. Surprisingly, there were no members that were activated only by ABA. The activation was found to be regulated via phosphorylation. In addition to the functional distinction with respect to ABA regulation, dependence of activation on the hyperosmotic strength was different among the members. We show that the relatively diverged C-terminal domain is mainly responsible for this functional distinction, although the kinase domain also contributes to these differences. The results indicated that the SnRK2 protein kinase family has evolved specifically for hyperosmotic stress signaling and that individual members have acquired distinct regulatory properties, including ABA responsiveness by modifying the C-terminal domain.
NA	OsSAPK2 Confers Abscisic Acid Sensitivity and Tolerance to Drought Stress in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Tropical Plant Resources and Sustainable Use, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of SciencesKunming, China.	SNF 1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE 2 (SnRK2) is a family of plant-specific protein kinases which is the key regulator of hyper-osmotic stress signaling and abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent development in various plants. Among the rice subclass-I and -II SnRK2s, osmotic stress/ABA-activated protein kinase 2 (SAPK2) may be the primary mediator of ABA signaling. However, SAPK2 has not been comprehensively characterized. In this study, we elucidated the functional properties of SAPK2 using loss-of-function mutants produced with the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The SAPK2 expression level was strongly upregulated by drought, high-salinity, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatments. The sapk2 mutants exhibited an ABA-insensitive phenotype during the germination and post-germination stages, suggesting that SAPK2 had a pivotal role related to ABA-mediated seed dormancy. The sapk2 mutants were more sensitive to drought stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) than the wild-type plants, indicating that SAPK2 was important for responses to drought conditions in rice. An additional investigation revealed that SAPK2 increased drought tolerance in the following two ways: (i) by reducing water loss via the accumulation of compatible solutes, promoting stomatal closure, and upregulating the expression levels of stress-response genes such as OsRab16b, OsRab21, OsbZIP23, OsLEA3, OsOREB1 and slow anion channel (SLAC)-associated genes such as OsSLAC1 and OsSLAC7; (ii) by inducing the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes to promote ROS-scavenging abilities that will ultimately decrease ROS damages. Moreover, we also observed that SAPK2 significantly increased the tolerance of rice plants to salt and PEG stresses. These findings imply that SAPK2 is a potential candidate gene for future crop improvement studies.
NA	The sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinases SAPK1 and SAPK2 function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance in rice.	2018	BMC Plant Biol	Key Laboratory of Tropical Plant Resources and Sustainable Use, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, 650223, Yunnan, China.	The sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase 2 family (SnRK2s) unifies different abiotic stress signals in plants. To date, the functions of two rice SnRK2s, osmotic stress/ABA-activated protein kinase 1 (SAPK1) and SAPK2, have been unknown. We investigated their roles in response to salt stress by generating loss-of-function lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and by overexpressing these proteins in transgenic rice plants.Expression profiling revealed that SAPK1 and SAPK2 expression were strongly induced by drought, NaCl, and PEG treatment, but not by ABA. SAPK2 expression was highest in the leaves, followed by the roots, whereas SAPK1 was highest expressed in roots followed by leaves. Both proteins were localized to the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Under salt stress, sapk1, sapk2 and, in particular, sapk1/2 mutants, exhibited reduced germination rates, more severe growth inhibition, more distinct chlorosis, reduced chlorophyll contents, and reduced survival rates in comparison with the wild-type plants. In contrast, SAPK1- and SAPK2-overexpression lines had increased germination rates and reduced sensitivities to salt; including mild reductions in growth inhibition, reduced chlorosis, increased chlorophyll contents and improved survival rates in comparison with the wild-type plants. These results suggest that SAPK1 and SAPK2 may function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance at the germination and seedling stages. We also found that SAPK1 and SAPK2 affected the osmotic potential following salt stress by promoting the generation of osmotically active metabolites such as proline. SAPK1 and SAPK2 also improved reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification following salt stress by promoting the generation of ROS scavengers such as ascorbic acid, and by increasing the expression levels of proteins such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). SAPK1 and SAPK2 may function collaboratively in reducing Na+ toxicity by affecting the Na+ distribution between roots and shoots, Na+ exclusion from the cytoplasm, and Na+ sequestration into the vacuoles. These effects may be facilitated through the expression of Na+-and K+-homeostasis-related genes.SAPK1 and SAPK2 may function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance at the germination and seedling stages in rice. SAPK1 and SAPK2 may be useful to improve salt tolerance in crop plants.
NA	SAPK2 contributes to rice yield by modulating nitrogen metabolic processes under reproductive stage drought stress.	2020	Rice	 School of Chemical, Biological and Environmental Sciences, Yuxi Normal University, Yuxi, 653100, China.	BACKGROUND: The sucrose non-fermenting 1-related kinases 2 (SnRK2s) play important roles in osmotic stress responses in A. thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa L.). Osmotic stress/ABA-activated protein kinase 2 (SAPK2) is a member of SnRK2s subclass II in rice, but its function in rice yield under drought stress is unclear.  RESULTS: Compared with wild-type (Oryza.Sativa L.spp.japonica, WT) plants, the sapk2 rice mutant lines were shorter and produced fewer grains per panicle, smaller grains and lower grain yield under reproductive stage drought stress (RDS). Subsequent analysis suggested that SAPK2 considerably influences the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium contents of rice grains. The examination of rice seedling growth and development under nutrient-deprived conditions (-N, -K, and<U+2009>-<U+2009>P) proved that SAPK2 can significantly affect rice seedling growth and root development in hydroponic cultures lacking N and K. Moreover, the NO3- influx rate and nitrate concentration analysis indicated that SAPK2 promotes nitrate uptake and assimilation by regulating nitrate-related transporters.  CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SAPK2 could enhance grain production by regulating nitrogen utilization efficiency under RDS. Our work provided insights to breeding drought tolerant rice with high nutrient uptake.
NA	Stress-induced F-Box protein-coding gene OsFBX257 modulates drought stress adaptations and ABA responses in rice.	2022	Plant Cell Environ	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics &amp; Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, India.	F-box (FB) proteins that form part of SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF) type of E3 ubiquitin ligases are important components of plant growth and development. Here we characterized OsFBX257, a rice FB protein-coding gene that is differentially expressed under drought conditions and other abiotic stresses. Population genomics analysis suggest that OsFBX257 shows high allelic diversity in aus accessions and has been under positive selection in some japonica, aromatic and indica cultivars. Interestingly, allelic variation at OsFBX257 in aus cultivar Nagina22 is associated with an alternatively spliced transcript. Conserved among land plants, OsFBX257 is a component of the SCF complex, can form homomers and interact molecularly with the 14-3-3 rice proteins GF14b and GF14c. OsFBX257 is co-expressed in a network involving protein kinases and phosphatases. We show that OsFBX257 can bind the kinases OsCDPK1 and OsSAPK2, and that its phosphorylation can be reversed by phosphatase OsPP2C08. OsFBX257 expression level modulates root architecture and drought stress tolerance in rice. OsFBX257 knockdown (OsFBX257(KD) ) lines show reduced total root length and depth, crown root number, panicle size and survival under stress. In contrast, its overexpression (OsFBX257(OE) ) increases root depth, leaf and grain length, number of panicles, and grain yield in rice. OsFBX257 is a promising breeding target for alleviating drought stress-induced damage in rice.
NA	ABA-triggered ROS burst in rice developing anthers is critical for tapetal programmed cell death induction and heat stress-induced pollen abortion.	2023	Plant Cell Environ	School of Biological and Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University of Science and Technology, Hangzhou, China.	High temperatures (HT) cause pollen abortion and poor floret fertility in rice, which is closely associated with excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the developing anthers. However, the relationships between accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) and ROS, and their effects on tapetum-specific programmed cell death (PCD) in HT-stressed anthers are poorly characterised. Here, we determined the spatiotemporal changes in ABA and ROS levels, and their relationships with tapetal PCD under HT exposure. Mutants lacking ABA-activated protein kinase 2 (SAPK2) functions and exogenous ABA treatments were used to explore the effects of ABA signalling on the induction of PCD and ROS accumulation during pollen development. HT-induced pollen abortion was tightly associated with ABA accumulation and oxidative stress. The higher ABA level in HT-stressed anthers resulted in the earlier initiation of PCD induction and subsequently abnormal tapetum degeneration by activating ROS accumulation in developing anthers. Interactions between SAPK2 and DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase elF4A-1 (RH4) were required for ABA-induced ROS generation in developing anthers. The OsSAPK2 knockout mutants showed the impaired PCD responses in the absence of HT. However, the deficiency of SAPK2 functions did not suppress the ABA-mediated ROS generation in HT-stressed anthers.
