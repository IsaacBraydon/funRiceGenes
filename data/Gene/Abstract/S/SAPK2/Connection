OsbZIP23	SAPK2	Feedback regulation of ABA signaling and biosynthesis by a bZIP transcription factor targets drought resistance related genes.	 A homolog of SnRK2 protein kinase SAPK2 was found to interact with and phosphorylate OsbZIP23 for its transcriptional activation
OsbZIP23	SAPK2	Feedback regulation of ABA signaling and biosynthesis by a bZIP transcription factor targets drought resistance related genes.	 SAPK2 also interacted with OsPP2C49, an ABI1 homolog, which deactivated the SAPK2 to inhibit the transcriptional activation activity of OsbZIP23
