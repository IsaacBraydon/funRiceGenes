SRT702|Sir2|OsSRT2	cell death	Genome-wide gene expression profiling of introgressed indica rice alleles associated with seedling cold tolerance improvement in a japonica rice background	Candidate gene prediction based on introgressed regions in K354 revealed genotype-dependent CT enhancement mechanisms, associated with Sir2, OsFAD7, OsWAK112d, and programmed cell death (PCD) related genes, present in CT IL K354 but absent in its recurrent parent C418
SRT702|Sir2|OsSRT2	growth	Ustilaginoidea virens-secreted effector Uv1809 suppresses rice immunity by enhancing OsSRT2-mediated histone deacetylation.
