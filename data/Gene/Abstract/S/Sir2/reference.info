Zhang-2012-Genome-wide gene exp.pdf	Genome-wide gene expression profiling of introgressed indica rice alleles associated with seedling cold tolerance improvement in a japonica rice background	2012	BMC Genomics	Institute of Crop Sciences/National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China	ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Rice in tropical and sub-tropical areas is often subjected to cold stress at the seedling stage, resulting in poor growth and yield loss. Although japonica rice is generally more cold tolerant (CT) than indica rice, there are several favorable alleles for CT exist in indica that can be used to enhance CT in rice with a japonica background. Genome-wide gene expression profiling is an efficient way to decipher the molecular genetic mechanisms of CT enhancement and to provide valuable information for CT improvement in rice molecular breeding. In this study, the transcriptome of the CT introgression line (IL) K354 and its recurrent parent C418 under cold stress were comparatively analyzed to explore the possible CT enhancement mechanisms of K354. RESULTS: A total of 3184 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 195 transcription factors, were identified in both lines under cold stress. About half of these DEGs were commonly regulated and involved in major cold responsive pathways associated with OsDREB1 and OsMyb4 regulons. K354-specific cold-induced genes were functionally related to stimulus response, cellular cell wall organization, and microtubule-based movement processes that may contribute to increase CT. A set of genes encoding membrane fluidity and defensive proteins were highly enriched only in K354, suggesting that they contribute to the inherent CT of K354. Candidate gene prediction based on introgressed regions in K354 revealed genotype-dependent CT enhancement mechanisms, associated with Sir2, OsFAD7, OsWAK112d, and programmed cell death (PCD) related genes, present in CT IL K354 but absent in its recurrent parent C418. In K354, a number of DEGs were co-localized onto introgressed segments associated with CT QTLs, providing a basis for gene cloning and elucidation of molecular mechanisms responsible for CT in rice. CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide gene expression analysis revealed that genotype-specific cold induced genes and genes with higher basal expression in the CT genotype contribute jointly to CT improvement. The molecular genetic pathways of cold stress tolerance uncovered in this study, as well as the DEGs co-localized with CT-related QTLs, will serve as useful resources for further functional dissection of the molecular mechanisms of cold stress response in rice.
NA	Ustilaginoidea virens-secreted effector Uv1809 suppresses rice immunity by enhancing OsSRT2-mediated histone deacetylation.	2023	Plant Biotechnol J	Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Crop Integrated Pest Management, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China.	Rice false smut caused by Ustilaginoidea virens is a devastating rice (Oryza sativa) disease worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying U. virens-rice interactions are largely unknown. In this study, we identified a secreted protein, Uv1809, as a key virulence factor. Heterologous expression of Uv1809 in rice enhanced susceptibility to rice false smut and bacterial blight. Host-induced gene silencing of Uv1809 in rice enhanced resistance to U. virens, suggesting that Uv1809 inhibits rice immunity and promotes infection by U. virens. Uv1809 suppresses rice immunity by targeting and enhancing rice histone deacetylase OsSRT2-mediated histone deacetylation, thereby reducing H4K5ac and H4K8ac levels and interfering with the transcriptional activation of defence genes. CRISPR-Cas9 edited ossrt2 mutants showed no adverse effects in terms of growth and yield but displayed broad-spectrum resistance to rice pathogens, revealing a potentially valuable genetic resource for breeding disease resistance. Our study provides insight into defence mechanisms against plant pathogens that inactivate plant immunity at the epigenetic level.
