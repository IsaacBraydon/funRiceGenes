TGW6|OsTGW6	Phylogenetic and expression analyses of grain weight genes TaTGW6 and OsTGW6 and investigation of substrate availability indicate TGW6 does not regulate auxin content of grains but may affect pollen development
TGW6|OsTGW6	Expression, purification and crystallization of TGW6, which limits grain weight in rice. |  In the present study, we describe an improved heterologous expression system of TGW6 in Escherichia coli to enable purification of the recombinant protein |  The best expression was achieved using codon optimized TGW6 with a 30 amino acid truncation at the N-terminus (Î”30TGW6) in the Rosetta-gami 2(DE3) host strain
