Grain weight is a major determining factor of yield. Here, we report the cloning and functional analysis of THOUSAND-GRAIN WEIGHT 6 (TGW6), a gene from the Indian landrace rice Kasalath. TGW6 encodes a novel protein with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-glucose hydrolase activity. In sink organs, the Nipponbare tgw6 allele affects the timing of the transition from the syncytial to the cellular phase by controlling IAA supply and limiting cell number and grain length. Most notably, loss of function of the Kasalath allele enhances grain weight through pleiotropic effects on source organs and leads to significant yield increases. Our findings suggest that TGW6 may be useful for further improvements in yield characteristics in most cultivars.
NA	Bin-based genome-wide association studies reveal superior alleles for improvement of appearance quality using a 4-way MAGIC population in rice	2020	J Adv Res	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agriculture University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Introduction: The multiparental population provides us the chance to identify superior alleles controlling a trait for genetic improvement. Genome wide association studies at bin level (bin-GWAS) are expected to be more power in QTL mapping than GWAS at SNP level (SNP-GWAS).  Objectives: This study is to estimate genetic effects of QTL conferring grain appearance quality in rice by SNP-GWAS and bin-GWAS, compare their power in QTL mapping and identify the superior alleles of all detected QTL from 4 parents for genetic improvement.  Methods: A 4-way MAGIC population and its four founders were cultivated in two environments to dissect the genetic basis of rice grain appearance quality. Both SNP-GWAS and bin-GWAS were conducted for QTL mapping. Multiple comparison among 4 parental bin/alleles was used to identify the superior alleles.  Results: A total of 16 and 20 QTL associated with grain appearance quality were identified by SNP- and bin-GWAS, respectively. A minor chalkiness QTL qPGWC8.2/qDEC8 was assigned to a 30-kb genomic region, in which OsMH_08T0121900 is the potential candidate gene because its encoded protein, glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase precursor is involved in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway. The superior parental alleles for GS3, GL3.1, GW5, GW7, and Chalk5 and two QTLs were almost carried by the high-quality parents Cypress and Yuejingsimiao (YJSM), while the poor-quality parent Guichao-2 (GC2) always carried the inferior alleles. The top five recombinant inbred lines with the highest quality of grain shape and chalkiness traits all carried gene combinations of superior alleles.  Conclusions: Both SNP- and bin-GWAS methods are encouraged for joint QTL mapping with MAGIC population. qPGWC8.2/qDEC8 is a novel candidate gene strongly associated with chalkiness. The superior alleles of GS3, GW5, GL3.1, GW7, Chalk5 and qPGWC8.2 were identified, and the pyramiding of these superior alleles is helpful to improve rice appearance quality.
NA	Reinvestigation of THOUSAND-GRAIN WEIGHT 6 grain weight genes in wheat and rice indicates a role in pollen development rather than regulation of auxin content in grains	2021	Theor Appl Genet	School of Science and Technology, University of New England, Armidale, NSW, 2351, Australia.	Phylogenetic and expression analyses of grain weight genes TaTGW6 and OsTGW6 and investigation of substrate availability indicate TGW6 does not regulate auxin content of grains but may affect pollen development. The THOUSAND-GRAIN WEIGHT 6 genes (TaTGW6 and OsTGW6) are reported to result in larger grains of wheat and rice by reducing production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in developing grains. However, a critical comparison of data on TaTGW6 and OsTGW6 with other reports on IAA synthesis in cereal grains requires that this hypothesis be reinvestigated. Here, we show that TaTGW6 and OsTGW6 are members of a large gene family that has undergone major, lineage-specific gene expansion. Wheat has nine genes, and rice three genes encoding proteins with more than 80% amino acid identity with TGW6, making it difficult to envisage how a single inactive allele could have a major effect on IAA levels in grains. In our study, we show that neither TaTGW6 nor OsTGW6 is expressed in developing grains. Instead, both genes and their close homologues are exclusively expressed in pre-emergent inflorescences; TaTGW6 is expressed particularly in microspores prior to mitosis. This evidence, combined with our observation that developing wheat grains have undetectable levels of ester IAA in comparison to free IAA and do not express an IAA-glucose synthase suggests that TaTGW6 and OsTGW6 do not regulate grain size via the hydrolysis of IAA-glucose. Instead, their similarity to rice strictosidine synthase-like (OsSTRL2) suggests they play a key role in pollen development.
