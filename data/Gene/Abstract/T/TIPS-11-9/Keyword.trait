TIPS-11-9	root	Genome-wide association and gene validation studies for early root vigour to improve direct seeding of rice.	 Abolishment of Tips-11-9 function through T-DNA insertion in a qTIPS-11-positive background resulted in a reduction of lateral root number, which negatively affected biomass accumulation, particularly under phosphorous-limiting conditions
TIPS-11-9	auxin	Genome-wide association and gene validation studies for early root vigour to improve direct seeding of rice.	 TIPS-11-9 was differentially expressed in emerging lateral roots of contrasting qTIPS-11 haplotypes, which was likely due to differences in cis-regulatory elements and auxin responsiveness
TIPS-11-9	biomass	Genome-wide association and gene validation studies for early root vigour to improve direct seeding of rice.	 Abolishment of Tips-11-9 function through T-DNA insertion in a qTIPS-11-positive background resulted in a reduction of lateral root number, which negatively affected biomass accumulation, particularly under phosphorous-limiting conditions
