TMS10L	temperature	Two rice receptor-like kinases maintain male fertility under changing temperatures.	 These findings demonstrate that TMS10 and TMS10L act as a key switch in postmeiotic tapetal development and pollen development by buffering environmental temperature changes, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms by which plants develop phenotypic plasticity via genotype-environment temperature interaction
TMS10L	pollen	Two rice receptor-like kinases maintain male fertility under changing temperatures.	 These findings demonstrate that TMS10 and TMS10L act as a key switch in postmeiotic tapetal development and pollen development by buffering environmental temperature changes, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms by which plants develop phenotypic plasticity via genotype-environment temperature interaction
TMS10L	sterility	Two rice receptor-like kinases maintain male fertility under changing temperatures.	 tms10 displays male sterility under high temperatures but male fertility under low temperatures, and the tms10 tms10l double mutant shows complete male sterility under both high and low temperatures
