Nozoye-2011-Phytosiderophore eff.pdf	Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants	2011	J Biol Chem	Department of Global Agricultural Sciences, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657 Japan.	Eukaryotic organisms have developed diverse mechanisms for the acquisition of iron, which is required for their survival. Graminaceous plants use a chelation strategy. They secrete phytosiderophore compounds, which solubilize iron in the soil, and then take up the resulting iron-phytosiderophore complexes. Bacteria and mammals also secrete siderophores to acquire iron. Although phytosiderophore secretion is crucial for plant growth, its molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we show that the efflux of deoxymugineic acid, the primary phytosiderophore from rice and barley, involves the TOM1 and HvTOM1 genes, respectively. Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing TOM1 or HvTOM1 released (14)C-labeled deoxymugineic acid but not (14)C-labeled nicotianamine, a structural analog and biosynthetic precursor of deoxymugineic acid, indicating that the TOM1 and HvTOM1 proteins are the phytosiderophore efflux transporters. Under conditions of iron deficiency, rice and barley roots express high levels of TOM1 and HvTOM1, respectively, and the overexpression of these genes increased tolerance to iron deficiency. In rice roots, the efficiency of deoxymugineic acid secretion was enhanced by overexpression of TOM1 and decreased by its repression, providing further evidence that TOM1 encodes the efflux transporter of deoxymugineic acid. We have also identified two genes encoding efflux transporters of nicotianamine, ENA1 and ENA2. Our identification of phytosiderophore efflux transporters has revealed the final piece in the molecular machinery of iron acquisition in graminaceous plants.
pce2569.pdf	Identification of OsbHLH133 as a regulator of iron distribution between roots and shoots in Oryza sativa	2013	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry Joint Research Laboratory in Genomics and Nutriomics, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient element for plant growth. Regulation of Fe-deficiency signalling networks is one of the many functions reported for basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors in plants. In the present study, OsbHLH133 was found to be induced by Fe-deficiency conditions in Oryza sativa. Insertional inactivation of OsbHLH133 (bhlh133) resulted in growth retardation, with enhanced Fe concentration seen in shoots, and reduced Fe concentration in roots. Overexpression of OsbHLH133 had the opposite effect, that is resulted in an enhanced Fe concentration in roots and reduced Fe concentration in shoots and also in xylem sap. Microarray analysis showed that some of the genes encoding Fe-related functions were up-regulated under Fe-sufficient conditions, in bhlh133 mutant plants compared to wild-type plants. Significant differential expression of a number of signalling pathways, including calcium signalling, was also seen in bhlh133 plants compared to wild-type plants, independent of Fe conditions.
Ricachenevsky-2011-ZINC-INDUCED FACILIT.pdf	ZINC-INDUCED FACILITATOR-LIKE family in plants: lineage-specific expansion in monocotyledons and conserved genomic and expression features among rice (Oryza sativa) paralogs	2011	BMC Plant Biol	Centro de Biotecnologia, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Avenida Bento Goncalves 9500, Porto Alegre, Brazil.	BACKGROUND: Duplications are very common in the evolution of plant genomes, explaining the high number of members in plant gene families. New genes born after duplication can undergo pseudogenization, neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization. Rice is a model for functional genomics research, an important crop for human nutrition and a target for biofortification. Increased zinc and iron content in the rice grain could be achieved by manipulation of metal transporters. Here, we describe the ZINC-INDUCED FACILITATOR-LIKE (ZIFL) gene family in plants, and characterize the genomic structure and expression of rice paralogs, which are highly affected by segmental duplication. RESULTS: Sequences of sixty-eight ZIFL genes, from nine plant species, were comparatively analyzed. Although related to MSF_1 proteins, ZIFL protein sequences consistently grouped separately. Specific ZIFL sequence signatures were identified. Monocots harbor a larger number of ZIFL genes in their genomes than dicots, probably a result of a lineage-specific expansion. The rice ZIFL paralogs were named OsZIFL1 to OsZIFL13 and characterized. The genomic organization of the rice ZIFL genes seems to be highly influenced by segmental and tandem duplications and concerted evolution, as rice genome contains five highly similar ZIFL gene pairs. Most rice ZIFL promoters are enriched for the core sequence of the Fe-deficiency-related box IDE1. Gene expression analyses of different plant organs, growth stages and treatments, both from our qPCR data and from microarray databases, revealed that the duplicated ZIFL gene pairs are mostly co-expressed. Transcripts of OsZIFL4, OsZIFL5, OsZIFL7, and OsZIFL12 accumulate in response to Zn-excess and Fe-deficiency in roots, two stresses with partially overlapping responses. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that ZIFL genes have different evolutionary histories in monocot and dicot lineages. In rice, concerted evolution affected ZIFL duplicated genes, possibly maintaining similar expression patterns between pairs. The enrichment for IDE1 boxes in rice ZIFL gene promoters suggests a role in Zn-excess and Fe-deficiency up-regulation of ZIFL transcripts. Moreover, this is the first description of the ZIFL gene family in plants and the basis for functional studies on this family, which may play important roles in Zn and Fe homeostasis in plants.
NA	Novel rice iron biofortification approaches using expression of ZmYS1 and OsTOM1 controlled by tissue-specific promoters.	2022	J Exp Bot	Plant Biotechnology, Department of Biology, ETH Zurich, Universit√§tstrasse 2, 8092 Zurich, Switzerland.	Intrinsic improvement of Fe concentration in the rice grains, called rice Fe biofortification, is a promising countermeasure against widespread human Fe deficiency. In this study, two novel rice Fe biofortification approaches are reported. The first approach (Y approach) involved the expression of maize YELLOW STRIPE 1 controlled by the HEAVY METAL ATPASE 2 promoter. Y approach increased the polished grain Fe concentrations up to 4.8-fold compared to the non-transgenic (NT) line. The second approach (T approach) involved the expression of rice TRANSPORTER OF MUGINEIC ACID 1 controlled by the FERRIC REDUCTASE DEFECTIVE LIKE 1 promoter. T approach increased the polished grain Fe concentrations by up to 3.2-fold. No synergistic increases in the polished grain Fe concentrations were observed when Y and T approaches were combined (YT approach). However, the polished grain Fe concentrations further increased by to 9.3-fold compared to the NT line, when YT approach was combined with the endosperm-specific FERRITIN expression (YTF approach) or when YTF approach was combined with the constitutive NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE expression (YTFN approach). Total grain weight per plant in most Y, T, YT and YTFN lines was comparable to that in the NT line, while it was significantly decreased in most YTF lines.
