TOM1|OsZIFL4	transporter	Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants	 Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing TOM1 or HvTOM1 released (14)C-labeled deoxymugineic acid but not (14)C-labeled nicotianamine, a structural analog and biosynthetic precursor of deoxymugineic acid, indicating that the TOM1 and HvTOM1 proteins are the phytosiderophore efflux transporters
TOM1|OsZIFL4	transporter	Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants	 In rice roots, the efficiency of deoxymugineic acid secretion was enhanced by overexpression of TOM1 and decreased by its repression, providing further evidence that TOM1 encodes the efflux transporter of deoxymugineic acid
TOM1|OsZIFL4	iron	Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants	 Under conditions of iron deficiency, rice and barley roots express high levels of TOM1 and HvTOM1, respectively, and the overexpression of these genes increased tolerance to iron deficiency
TOM1|OsZIFL4	root	Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants	 Under conditions of iron deficiency, rice and barley roots express high levels of TOM1 and HvTOM1, respectively, and the overexpression of these genes increased tolerance to iron deficiency
TOM1|OsZIFL4	root	Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants	 In rice roots, the efficiency of deoxymugineic acid secretion was enhanced by overexpression of TOM1 and decreased by its repression, providing further evidence that TOM1 encodes the efflux transporter of deoxymugineic acid
TOM1|OsZIFL4	root	ZINC-INDUCED FACILITATOR-LIKE family in plants: lineage-specific expansion in monocotyledons and conserved genomic and expression features among rice (Oryza sativa) paralogs	 Transcripts of OsZIFL4, OsZIFL5, OsZIFL7, and OsZIFL12 accumulate in response to Zn-excess and Fe-deficiency in roots, two stresses with partially overlapping responses
