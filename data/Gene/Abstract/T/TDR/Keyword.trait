TDR	transcription factor	OsC6, encoding a lipid transfer protein, is required for postmeiotic anther development in rice	Furthermore, additional evidence is provided that the expression of OsC6 is positively regulated by a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Tapetum Degeneration Retardation (TDR)
TDR	anther	Identification of gamyb-4 and analysis of the regulatory role of GAMYB in rice anther development	While the GAMYB expression was not obviously changed in tdr and udt1-1, and no apparent expression fold change of UDT1 in tdr and gamyb-4, suggesting that TDR may act downstream of GAMYB and UDT1, and GAMYB and UDT1 work in parallel to regulate rice early anther development
