OsC6	TDR	High temperatures cause male sterility in rice plants with transcriptional alterations during pollen development	The expression levels of Osc6, OsRAFTIN and TDR, which are tapetum-specific genes, were unaffected by high temperatures
OsC6	TDR	OsC6, encoding a lipid transfer protein, is required for postmeiotic anther development in rice	Furthermore, additional evidence is provided that the expression of OsC6 is positively regulated by a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Tapetum Degeneration Retardation (TDR)
OsC6	TDR	OsC6, encoding a lipid transfer protein, is required for postmeiotic anther development in rice	Extra granule-like structures were observed on the inner surface of the tdr tapetal layer when the expression of OsC6 was driven by the TDR promoter compared with the tdr mutant
OsC6	TDR	The rice tapetum degeneration retardation gene is required for tapetum degradation and anther development	More importantly, two genes, Os CP1 and Os c6, encoding a Cys protease and a protease inhibitor, respectively, were shown to be the likely direct targets of TDR through chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay
OsCP1	TDR	The rice tapetum degeneration retardation gene is required for tapetum degradation and anther development	More importantly, two genes, Os CP1 and Os c6, encoding a Cys protease and a protease inhibitor, respectively, were shown to be the likely direct targets of TDR through chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay
TDR	TIP2|bHLH142	The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.	We revealed that TIP2 acts upstream of TDR and EAT1 and directly regulates the expression of TDR and EAT1.
TDR	TIP2|bHLH142	The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.	In addition, TIP2 can interact with TDR, indicating a role of TIP2 in later anther development.
OsADF	TDR	An anther development F-box (ADF) protein regulated by tapetum degeneration retardation (TDR) controls rice anther development.	In this study, we reported that a F-box protein, OsADF, as one of the direct targets of TDR , plays a critical role in rice tapetum cell development and pollen formation
OsADF	TDR	An anther development F-box (ADF) protein regulated by tapetum degeneration retardation (TDR) controls rice anther development.	Furthermore, we demonstrated that the TDR, a key regulator in controlling rice anther development, could regulate directly the expression of OsADF by binding to E-box motifs of its promoter
DTC1	TDR	Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.	Moreover, levels of DTC1 transcripts are diminished in udt1, tdr, and eat1 anthers
OsTDF1	TDR	The functional analysis of OsTDF1 reveals a conserved genetic pathway for tapetal development between rice and Arabidopsis	The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that OsTDF1 acts downstream of UDT1 and upstream of TDR, EAT1, OsMYB103 and PTC1 in rice, suggesting that the genetic pathway for tapetum development is generally conserved between rice and Arabidopsis
