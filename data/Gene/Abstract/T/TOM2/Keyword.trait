TOM2	root	The phytosiderophore efflux transporter TOM2 is involved in metal transport in rice.	In onion epidermal and rice root cells, the TOM2-GFP fusion protein localized to the cell membrane, indicating that the TOM2 protein is a transporter for phytosiderophore efflux to the cell exterior
TOM2	growth	The phytosiderophore efflux transporter TOM2 is involved in metal transport in rice.	Transgenic rice in which TOM2 expression was repressed by RNA interference showed growth defects compared to non-transformants and TOM3-repressed rice
TOM2	growth	The phytosiderophore efflux transporter TOM2 is involved in metal transport in rice.	Our results indicate that TOM2 is involved in the internal transport of DMA, which is required for normal plant growth
TOM2	seed	The phytosiderophore efflux transporter TOM2 is involved in metal transport in rice.	Strong TOM2 expression was observed in developing tissues during seed maturation and germination, while TOM3 expression was weak during seed maturation
TOM2	transporter	The phytosiderophore efflux transporter TOM2 is involved in metal transport in rice.	The phytosiderophore efflux transporter TOM2 is involved in metal transport in rice.
TOM2	transporter	The phytosiderophore efflux transporter TOM2 is involved in metal transport in rice.	In the present study, we analyzed TOM2 and TOM3, rice homologs of transporter of mugineic acid family phytosiderophores 1 (TOM1), a crucial efflux transporter directly involved in phytosiderophore secretion into the soil
TOM2	transporter	The phytosiderophore efflux transporter TOM2 is involved in metal transport in rice.	In onion epidermal and rice root cells, the TOM2-GFP fusion protein localized to the cell membrane, indicating that the TOM2 protein is a transporter for phytosiderophore efflux to the cell exterior
TOM2	plant growth	The phytosiderophore efflux transporter TOM2 is involved in metal transport in rice.	Our results indicate that TOM2 is involved in the internal transport of DMA, which is required for normal plant growth
