NA	The Tyrosine Aminomutase TAM1 Is Required for β-Tyrosine Biosynthesis in Rice.	2015	Plant Cell	Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Ithaca, New York 14853.	Non-protein amino acids, often isomers of the standard 20 protein amino acids, have defense-related functions in many plant species. A targeted search for jasmonate-induced metabolites in cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) identified (R)-β-tyrosine, an isomer of the common amino acid (S)-α-tyrosine in the seeds, leaves, roots, and root exudates of the Nipponbare cultivar. Assays with 119 diverse cultivars showed a distinct presence/absence polymorphism, with β-tyrosine being most prevalent in temperate japonica cultivars. Genetic mapping identified a candidate gene on chromosome 12, which was confirmed to encode a tyrosine aminomutase (TAM1) by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana and in vitro enzyme assays. A point mutation in TAM1 eliminated β-tyrosine production in Nipponbare. Rice cultivars that do not produce β-tyrosine have a chromosome 12 deletion that encompasses TAM1. Although β-tyrosine accumulation was induced by the plant defense signaling molecule jasmonic acid, bioassays with hemipteran and lepidopteran herbivores showed no negative effects at physiologically relevant β-tyrosine concentrations. In contrast, root growth of Arabidopsis thaliana and other tested dicot plants was inhibited by concentrations as low as 1 μM. As β-tyrosine is exuded into hydroponic medium at higher concentrations, it may contribute to the allelopathic potential of rice.
NA	A Tyrosine Aminomutase from Rice (Oryza sativa) Isomerizes S-α- to R-β-Tyrosine with High Enantioselectivity and Retention-of-Configuration.	2015	Biochemistry	Fail	A recently discovered 3,5-dihydro-5-methylidene-4H-imidazol-4-one (MIO)-dependent tyrosine aminomutase (OsTAM) from rice (Plant Cell 2015, 27, 1265) converts (S)-α-tyrosine to a mixture of (R)- and (S)-β-tyrosines, with high (94%) enantiomeric excess. which does not change with pH, like it does for bacterial TAMs. The KM = 490 μM and kcat = 0.005 s(-1) are similar for other TAM enzymes. OsTAM is unique and also catalyzes (R)-β- from (S)-α-phenylalanine. OsTAM principally retains the configuration at the reactive Cα and Cβ centers during catalysis much like the phenylalanine aminomutase on the Taxol biosynthetic pathway in Taxus plants.
