THIS1	tillering	THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice	 This study characterized a rice mutant, the most obvious phenotypes of which are high tillering, reduced height, and infertile spikelets (named this1)|THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice
THIS1	growth	THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice	 Similarly to the high tiller number and dwarf mutants in rice, the increased tiller number of this1 plants is ascribed to the release of tiller bud outgrowth rather than to increased tiller bud formation
THIS1	tiller	THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice	 This study characterized a rice mutant, the most obvious phenotypes of which are high tillering, reduced height, and infertile spikelets (named this1)| Similarly to the high tiller number and dwarf mutants in rice, the increased tiller number of this1 plants is ascribed to the release of tiller bud outgrowth rather than to increased tiller bud formation|THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice
THIS1	seed	THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice	 The seed-setting rate of this1 was less than half that of the wild type, owing to defects in pollen maturation, anther dehiscence, and flower opening
THIS1	dwarf	THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice	 Similarly to the high tiller number and dwarf mutants in rice, the increased tiller number of this1 plants is ascribed to the release of tiller bud outgrowth rather than to increased tiller bud formation
THIS1	flower	THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice	 The seed-setting rate of this1 was less than half that of the wild type, owing to defects in pollen maturation, anther dehiscence, and flower opening
THIS1	anther	THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice	 The seed-setting rate of this1 was less than half that of the wild type, owing to defects in pollen maturation, anther dehiscence, and flower opening
THIS1	branching	THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice	 In the this1 mutant, however, the accelerated rate of branching was delayed until the stem elongation stage, while other mutants lost the ability to control branching at all developmental stages| Thus, This1 provides joint control between shoot branching and reproductive development
THIS1	fertility	THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice	 Homology searches revealed that THIS1 is conserved in both monocots and eudicots, suggesting that it plays fundamental role in regulating branch and spikelet fertility, as well as other aspects of developmental control|THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice
THIS1	spikelet	THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice	 This study characterized a rice mutant, the most obvious phenotypes of which are high tillering, reduced height, and infertile spikelets (named this1)| Homology searches revealed that THIS1 is conserved in both monocots and eudicots, suggesting that it plays fundamental role in regulating branch and spikelet fertility, as well as other aspects of developmental control|THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice

THIS1	phytohormone	THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice	 The relative change in expression of marker genes highlighted the possibility that This1 is involved in phytohormone signalling pathways, such as those for strigolactone and auxin
THIS1	auxin	THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice	 The relative change in expression of marker genes highlighted the possibility that This1 is involved in phytohormone signalling pathways, such as those for strigolactone and auxin
THIS1	tiller number	THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice	 Similarly to the high tiller number and dwarf mutants in rice, the increased tiller number of this1 plants is ascribed to the release of tiller bud outgrowth rather than to increased tiller bud formation
THIS1	pollen	THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice	 The seed-setting rate of this1 was less than half that of the wild type, owing to defects in pollen maturation, anther dehiscence, and flower opening
THIS1	stem	THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice	 In the this1 mutant, however, the accelerated rate of branching was delayed until the stem elongation stage, while other mutants lost the ability to control branching at all developmental stages
THIS1	reproductive	THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice	 Thus, This1 provides joint control between shoot branching and reproductive development
