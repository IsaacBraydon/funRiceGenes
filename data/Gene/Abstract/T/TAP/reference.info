NA	THERMOSENSITIVE BARREN PANICLE (TAP) is required for rice panicle and spikelet development at high ambient temperature.	2022	New Phytol	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic &amp; Developmental Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 20040, China.	In cereal plants, the size of the panicle (inflorescence) is a critical factor for yield. Panicle size is determined by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, but the mechanisms underlying adaptations to temperature stress during panicle development remain largely unknown. We identify the rice THERMOSENSITIVE BARREN PANICLE (TAP) gene, which encodes a transposase-derived FAR1-RELATED SEQUENCE (FRS) protein and is responsible for regulating panicle and spikelet development at high ambient temperature. The tap mutants display high temperature-dependent reproductive abnormalities, including compromised secondary branch and spikelet initiation and pleiotropic floral organ defects. Consistent with its thermosensitive phenotype, TAP expression is induced by high temperature. TAP directly promotes the expression of OsYABBY3 (OsYAB3), OsYAB4, and OsYAB5, which encode key transcriptional regulators in panicle and spikelet development. In addition, TAP physically interacts with OsYAB4 and OsYAB5 proteins; phenotypic analysis of osyab4 tap-1 and osyab5 tap-1 double mutants indicates that TAP-OsYAB4/OsYAB5 complexes act to maintain normal panicle and spikelet development. Taken together, our study reveals the novel role of a TE-derived transcription factor in controlling rice panicle development under high ambient temperatures, shedding light on the molecular mechanism underlying the adaptation of cereal crops to increasing environmental temperatures.
NA	Thermo-Sensitive Spikelet Defects 1 acclimatizes rice spikelet initiation and development to high temperature.	2022	Plant Physiol	Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Genetics, Breeding and Multiple Utilization of Crops and Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Breeding by Design of Plant, Fujian Agriculture &amp; Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China.	Crop reproductive development is vulnerable to heat stress, and the genetic modulation of thermotolerance during the reproductive phase, especially the early stage, remains poorly understood. We isolated a Poaceae-specific FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYLS3 (FHY3)/FAR-RED IMPAIRED RESPONSE1 (FAR1)family transcription factor, Thermo-sensitive Spikelet Defects 1 (TSD1), derived from transposase in rice (Oryza sativa) TSD1 was highly expressed in spikelets, induced by heat, and specifically enhanced the thermotolerance of spikelet morphogenesis. Disrupting TSD1 did not affect vegetative growth but markedly retarded spikelet initiation and development, as well as caused varying degrees of spikelet degeneration, depending on the temperature. Most tsd1 spikelets were normal at low temperature but gradually degenerated as temperature increased, and all disappeared at high temperature, leading to naked branches. TSD1 directly promoted the transcription of YABBY1 and YABBY3 and could physically interact with YABBY1 and three TOB proteins, YABBY5, YABBY4, and YABBY3. These YABBY proteins can form either homodimers or heterodimers and play an important role in spikelet morphogenesis, similar to TSD1. Notably, the knockout mutant yab5-ko and double mutant tsd1 yab5-ko resembled tsd1 in spikelet appearance and response to temperature, indicating that these genes likely participate in spikelet development through the cooperative TSD1-YABBY module. These findings reveal a distinctive function of FHY3/FAR1 family genes and a unique TSD1-YABBY complex to acclimate spikelet development to high temperature in rice, providing insight into the regulating pathway of enhancing thermotolerance in plant reproductive development.
