OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	TAP	THERMOSENSITIVE BARREN PANICLE (TAP) is required for rice panicle and spikelet development at high ambient temperature.	 TAP directly promotes the expression of OsYABBY3 (OsYAB3), OsYAB4, and OsYAB5, which encode key transcriptional regulators in panicle and spikelet development
OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	TAP	THERMOSENSITIVE BARREN PANICLE (TAP) is required for rice panicle and spikelet development at high ambient temperature.	 In addition, TAP physically interacts with OsYAB4 and OsYAB5 proteins; phenotypic analysis of osyab4 tap-1 and osyab5 tap-1 double mutants indicates that TAP-OsYAB4/OsYAB5 complexes act to maintain normal panicle and spikelet development

OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	TAP	Mutation of OsPIN1b by CRISPR/Cas9 Reveals a Role for Auxin Transport in Modulating Rice Architecture and Root Gravitropism.	 Moreover, ospin1b mutants displayed a curly root phenotype cultured with tap water regardless of lighting conditions, while nutrient solution culture could partially rescue the curly root phenotype in light and almost completely abolish this phenotype in darkness, indicating the involvement of the integration of light and nutrient signals in root gravitropism regulation
