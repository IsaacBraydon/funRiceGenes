TIP2|bHLH142	 Recently, bHLH142, a bHLH transcription factor encoding gene of rice has been found to show anther-specific expression and mutant analyses suggest its functions in regulating tapetum differentiation and degeneration during anther development |  Temporally dissimilar pattern of bHLH142 transcript and polypeptide accumulation suggested regulation of its expression beyond transcriptional level |  Overexpression of bHLH142 in transgenic rice resulted in indehiscent anthers and aborted pollen grains |  Thus, bHLH142 is an anther-specific gene whose expression is regulated at transcriptional and post-transcriptional/translational levels	 Overexpression of bHLH142 in transgenic rice resulted in indehiscent anthers and aborted pollen grains
