TDR	TIP2|bHLH142	The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.	We revealed that TIP2 acts upstream of TDR and EAT1 and directly regulates the expression of TDR and EAT1.
DTD|EAT1	TIP2|bHLH142	The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.	We revealed that TIP2 acts upstream of TDR and EAT1 and directly regulates the expression of TDR and EAT1.
TDR	TIP2|bHLH142	The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.	In addition, TIP2 can interact with TDR, indicating a role of TIP2 in later anther development.
TIP2|bHLH142	Udt1	The bHLH142 Transcription Factor Coordinates with TDR1 to Modulate the Expression of EAT1 and Regulate Pollen Development in Rice	bHLH142 acts downstream of UDT1 and GAMYB but upstream of TDR1 and EAT1 in pollen development.
AP37|OsERF3	TIP2|bHLH142	The bHLH142 Transcription Factor Coordinates with TDR1 to Modulate the Expression of EAT1 and Regulate Pollen Development in Rice	EAT1 positively regulates the expression of AP37 and AP25, which induce tapetal programmed cell death.
DTD|EAT1	TIP2|bHLH142	Tightly Controlled Expression of bHLH142 Is Essential for Timely Tapetal Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development in Rice.	 We previously showed that knockout of bHLH142 in rice (Oryza sativa) causes pollen sterility by interrupting tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) and bHLH142 coordinates with TDR to modulate the expression of EAT1

DTD|EAT1	TIP2|bHLH142	EAT1 transcription factor, a non-cell-autonomous regulator of pollen production, activates meiotic small RNA biogenesis in rice anther tapetum.	 The transient assay also demonstrated that UNDEVELOPED TAPETUM1 (UDT1)/bHLH164 is a potential interacting partner of both EAT1 and TIP2 during early meiosis
DTD|EAT1	TIP2|bHLH142	EAT1 transcription factor, a non-cell-autonomous regulator of pollen production, activates meiotic small RNA biogenesis in rice anther tapetum.	 This study indicates that EAT1 is one of key regulators triggering meiotic phasiRNA biogenesis in anther tapetum, and that other bHLH proteins, TIP2 and UDT1, also play some important roles in this process
PTC1|OsMS1	TIP2|bHLH142	OsMS1 functions as a transcriptional activator to regulate programmed tapetum development and pollen exine formation in rice.	 Y2H and BiFC assays demonstrated that OsMS1 can interact with OsMADS15 and TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 (TIP2)
OsMYB80|BM1	TIP2|bHLH142	The MYB transcription factor Baymax1 plays a critical role in rice male fertility	 BM1 can physically interacts with bHLH protein TIP2, EAT1, and PHD (plant homeodomain)-finger member TIP3, respectively
TIP2|bHLH142	Udt1	OsMS188 Is a Key Regulator of Tapetum Development and Sporopollenin Synthesis in Rice	 UDT1, OsTDF1, TDR, bHLH142 and EAT1 are upstream regulators of rice tapetum development
