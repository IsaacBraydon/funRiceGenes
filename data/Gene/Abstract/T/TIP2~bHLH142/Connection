TDR	TIP2|bHLH142	The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.	We revealed that TIP2 acts upstream of TDR and EAT1 and directly regulates the expression of TDR and EAT1.
DTD|EAT1	TIP2|bHLH142	The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.	We revealed that TIP2 acts upstream of TDR and EAT1 and directly regulates the expression of TDR and EAT1.
TDR	TIP2|bHLH142	The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.	In addition, TIP2 can interact with TDR, indicating a role of TIP2 in later anther development.
TIP2|bHLH142	Udt1	The bHLH142 Transcription Factor Coordinates with TDR1 to Modulate the Expression of EAT1 and Regulate Pollen Development in Rice	bHLH142 acts downstream of UDT1 and GAMYB but upstream of TDR1 and EAT1 in pollen development.
AP37|OsERF3	TIP2|bHLH142	The bHLH142 Transcription Factor Coordinates with TDR1 to Modulate the Expression of EAT1 and Regulate Pollen Development in Rice	EAT1 positively regulates the expression of AP37 and AP25, which induce tapetal programmed cell death.
