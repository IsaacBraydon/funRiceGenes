TCD3	chloroplast	Chloroplast development at low temperature requires the pseudouridine synthase gene TCD3 in rice	Chloroplast development at low temperature requires the pseudouridine synthase gene TCD3 in rice
TCD3	chloroplast	Chloroplast development at low temperature requires the pseudouridine synthase gene TCD3 in rice	 The disruption of TCD3 severely affected the transcript levels of various chloroplast-associated genes, as well as ribosomal genes involved in chloroplast rRNA assembly at low temperature (20<U+2009>°„C), whereas the transcript levels of these genes were normal at high temperature (32<U+2009>°„C)
