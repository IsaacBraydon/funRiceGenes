NA	Chloroplast development at low temperature requires the pseudouridine synthase gene TCD3 in rice	2020	Sci Rep	College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, 200234, China.	Low temperature affects a broad spectrum of cellular components in plants, such as chloroplasts, as well as plant metabolism. On the other hand, pseudouridine (¶∑) synthases are required for the most abundant post-transcriptional modification of RNA in Escherichia coli. However, the role of rice ¶∑ synthases in regulating chloroplast development at low temperature remains elusive. In this study, we identified the rice thermo-sensitive chlorophyll-deficient (tcd3) mutant, which displays an albino phenotype before the 4-leaf stage and ultimately dies when grown at 20<U+2009>°„C, but can grow normally at 32<U+2009>°„C. Genetic analysis showed that the mutant trait is controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene (tcd3). Map-based cloning, complementation and knockout tests revealed that TCD3 encodes a chloroplast-localized ¶∑ synthase. TCD3 is a cold-induced gene that is mainly expressed in leaves. The disruption of TCD3 severely affected the transcript levels of various chloroplast-associated genes, as well as ribosomal genes involved in chloroplast rRNA assembly at low temperature (20<U+2009>°„C), whereas the transcript levels of these genes were normal at high temperature (32<U+2009>°„C). These results provide a first glimpse into the importance of rice ¶∑ synthase gene in chloroplast development at low temperatures.
NA	The Germin-like protein OsGER4 is involved in promoting crown root development under exogenous jasmonic acid treatment in rice.	2022	Plant J	University of Science and Technology of Hanoi, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, 18 Hoang Quoc Viet, Cau Giay, Hanoi, 100000, Vietnam.	In rice (Oryza sativa L.), crown roots (CRs) have many important roles in processes such as root system expansion, water and mineral uptake, and adaptation to environmental stresses. Phytohormones such as auxin, cytokinin, and ethylene are known to control CR initiation and development in rice. However, the role of jasmonic acid (JA) in CR development remained elusive. Here, we report that JA promotes CR development by regulating OsGER4, a rice Germin-like protein. Root phenotyping analysis revealed that exogenous JA treatment induced an increase in CR number in a concentration-dependent manner. A subsequent genome-wide association study and gene expression analyses pinpointed a strong association between the Germin-like protein OsGER4 and the increase in CR number under exogenous JA treatment. The ProGER4::GUS reporter line showed that OsGER4 is a hormone-responsive gene involved in various stress responses, mainly confined to epidermal and vascular tissues during CR primordia development and to vascular bundles of mature crown and lateral roots. Notable changes in OsGER4 expression patterns caused by the polar auxin transport inhibitor NPA support its connection to auxin signaling. Phenotyping experiments with OsGER4 knockout mutants confirmed that this gene is required for CR development under exogenous JA treatment. Overall, our results provide important insights into JA-mediated regulation of CR development in rice.
