NA	Chloroplast development at low temperature requires the pseudouridine synthase gene TCD3 in rice	2020	Sci Rep	College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, 200234, China.	Low temperature affects a broad spectrum of cellular components in plants, such as chloroplasts, as well as plant metabolism. On the other hand, pseudouridine (¶∑) synthases are required for the most abundant post-transcriptional modification of RNA in Escherichia coli. However, the role of rice ¶∑ synthases in regulating chloroplast development at low temperature remains elusive. In this study, we identified the rice thermo-sensitive chlorophyll-deficient (tcd3) mutant, which displays an albino phenotype before the 4-leaf stage and ultimately dies when grown at 20<U+2009>°„C, but can grow normally at 32<U+2009>°„C. Genetic analysis showed that the mutant trait is controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene (tcd3). Map-based cloning, complementation and knockout tests revealed that TCD3 encodes a chloroplast-localized ¶∑ synthase. TCD3 is a cold-induced gene that is mainly expressed in leaves. The disruption of TCD3 severely affected the transcript levels of various chloroplast-associated genes, as well as ribosomal genes involved in chloroplast rRNA assembly at low temperature (20<U+2009>°„C), whereas the transcript levels of these genes were normal at high temperature (32<U+2009>°„C). These results provide a first glimpse into the importance of rice ¶∑ synthase gene in chloroplast development at low temperatures.
