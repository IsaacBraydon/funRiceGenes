Tiller angle is a key feature of the architecture of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa), since it determines planting density and influences rice yield. Our previous work identified Tiller Angle Control 1 (TAC1) as a major quantitative trait locus that controls rice tiller angle. To further clarify the evolutionary characterization of the TAC1 gene, we compared a TAC1-containing 3164-bp genomic region among 113 cultivated varieties and 48 accessions of wild rice, including 43 accessions of O. rufipogon and five accessions of O. nivara. Only one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), a synonymous substitution, was detected in TAC1 coding regions of the cultivated rice varieties, whereas one synonymous and one nonsynonymous SNP were detected among the TAC1 coding regions of wild rice accessions. These data indicate that little natural mutation and modification in the TAC1 coding region occurred within the cultivated rice and its progenitor during evolution. Nucleotide diversities in the TAC1 gene regions of O. sativa and O. rufipogon of 0.00116 and 0.00112, respectively, further indicate that TAC1 has been highly conserved during the course of rice domestication. A functional nucleotide polymorphism (FNP) of TAC1 was only found in the japonica rice group. A neutrality test revealed strong selection, especially in the 3'-flanking region of the TAC1 coding region containing the FNP in the japonica rice group. However, no selection occurred in the indica and wild-rice groups. A phylogenetic tree derived from TAC1 sequence analysis suggests that the indica and japonica subspecies arose independently during the domestication of wild rice.

A critical step during rice (Oryza sativa) cultivation is dense planting: a wider tiller angle will increase leaf shade and decrease photosynthesis efficiency, whereas a narrower tiller angle makes for more efficient plant architecture. The molecular basis of tiller angle remains unknown. This research demonstrates that tiller angle is controlled by a major quantitative trait locus, TAC1 (Tiller Angle Control 1). TAC1 was mapped to a 35-kb region on chromosome 9 using a large F(2) population from crosses between an indica rice, IR24, which displays a relatively spread-out plant architecture, and an introgressed line, IL55, derived from japonica rice Asominori, which displays a compact plant architecture with extremely erect tillers. Genetic complementation further identified the TAC1 gene, which harbors three introns in its coding region and a fourth 1.5-kb intron in the 3'-untranslated region. A mutation in the 3'-splicing site of this 1.5-kb intron from 'AGGA' to 'GGGA' decreases the level of tac1, resulting in a compact plant architecture with a tiller angle close to zero. Further sequence verification of the mutation in the 3'-splicing site of the 1.5-kb intron revealed that the tac1 mutation 'GGGA' was present in 88 compact japonica rice accessions and TAC1 with 'AGGA' was present in 21 wild rice accessions and 43 indica rice accessions, all with the spread-out form, indicating that tac1 had been extensively utilized in densely planted rice grown in high-latitude temperate areas and at high altitudes where japonica rice varieties are widely cultivated.

Crop architecture parameters such as tiller number, angle and plant height are important agronomic traits that have been considered for breeding programmes. Auxin distribution within the plant has long been recognized to alter architecture. The rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome contains 12 putative PIN genes encoding auxin efflux transporters, including four PIN1 and one PIN2 genes. Here, we report that over-expression of OsPIN2 through a transgenic approach in rice (Japonica cv. Nipponbare) led to a shorter plant height, more tillers and a larger tiller angle when compared with wild type (WT). The expression patterns of the auxin reporter DR5::GUS and quantification of auxin distribution showed that OsPIN2 over-expression increased auxin transport from the shoot to the root-shoot junction, resulting in a non-tissue-specific accumulation of more free auxin at the root-shoot junction relative to WT. Over-expression of OsPIN2 enhanced auxin transport from shoots to roots, but did not alter the polar auxin pattern in the roots. Transgenic plants were less sensitive to N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, an auxin transport inhibitor, than WT in their root growth. OsPIN2-over-expressing plants had suppressed the expression of a gravitropism-related gene OsLazy1 in the shoots, but unaltered expression of OsPIN1b and OsTAC1, which were reported as tiller angle controllers in rice. The data suggest that OsPIN2 has a distinct auxin-dependent regulation pathway together with OsPIN1b and OsTAC1 controlling rice shoot architecture. Altering OsPIN2 expression by genetic transformation can be directly used for modifying rice architecture.
