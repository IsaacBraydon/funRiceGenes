TPS46	 Potential roles or constitutive emissions of specific volatiles may due to the constitutive expressions of tps46 in rice |  Therefore, in the present study, RNA interference (Ri) and overexpression (Oe) rice lines were generated to investigate the potential function of TPS46 in Oryza sativa sp |  Interestingly, the rice plants become more susceptible to Rhopalosiphum padi when expression of tps46 was silenced compared with Wt in greenhouse conditions |  Our data suggested that the constitutive emissions of EÎ²f and limonene regulated by the constitutive expression of tps46 may play a crucial role in rice defense against R	 Therefore, in the present study, RNA interference (Ri) and overexpression (Oe) rice lines were generated to investigate the potential function of TPS46 in Oryza sativa sp
