TPS46|OsTPS31	resistance	TPS46, a Rice Terpene Synthase Conferring Natural Resistance to Bird Cherry-Oat Aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (Linnaeus).	Consequently, tps46 could be a potential target gene to be employed for improving the resistance of plants to aphids
TPS46|OsTPS31	defense	TPS46, a Rice Terpene Synthase Conferring Natural Resistance to Bird Cherry-Oat Aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (Linnaeus).	Our data suggested that the constitutive emissions of EÎ²f and limonene regulated by the constitutive expression of tps46 may play a crucial role in rice defense against R
TPS46|OsTPS31	resistance	Cloning of the promoter of rice brown planthopper feeding-inducible gene OsTPS31 and identification of related cis-regulatory elements.	 CONCLUSION: The findings provide a new promoter and a new cis-regulatory sequence tool for the research on and application of rice BPH resistance genes, as well as a new perspective for functional analysis of the OsTPS31 gene
TPS46|OsTPS31	brown planthopper	Cloning of the promoter of rice brown planthopper feeding-inducible gene OsTPS31 and identification of related cis-regulatory elements.	Cloning of the promoter of rice brown planthopper feeding-inducible gene OsTPS31 and identification of related cis-regulatory elements.
