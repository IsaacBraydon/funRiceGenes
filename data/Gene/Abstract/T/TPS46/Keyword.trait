TPS46	resistance	TPS46, a Rice Terpene Synthase Conferring Natural Resistance to Bird Cherry-Oat Aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (Linnaeus).	 Consequently, tps46 could be a potential target gene to be employed for improving the resistance of plants to aphids
TPS46	defense	TPS46, a Rice Terpene Synthase Conferring Natural Resistance to Bird Cherry-Oat Aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (Linnaeus).	 Our data suggested that the constitutive emissions of E¦Âf and limonene regulated by the constitutive expression of tps46 may play a crucial role in rice defense against R
