Symbol	Expression
TCD10	 In addition, TCD10 is specific expression in tissues |  The disruption of TCD10 resulted in an evidently reduced expression of chloroplast-associated genes under cold stress (20<U+00A0>°„C), whereas they did recovered to normal levels at high temperature (32<U+00A0>°„C) | The TCD10 encodes a novel rice PPR protein, mainly located in chloroplasts, which is important for chloroplast development, growth and the maintenance of photosynthetic electron transport and its disorder would lead to an aberrant chloroplast and abnormal expressions in these genes for chloroplast development and photosynthesis in rice under cold stress
