TGW2	grain	Natural variation in the promoter of TGW2 determines grain width and weight in rice.	Natural variation in the promoter of TGW2 determines grain width and weight in rice.
TGW2	grain	Natural variation in the promoter of TGW2 determines grain width and weight in rice.	 <U+2022> A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation at 1818<U+00A0>bp upstream of TGW2 is responsible for its different expression, leading to alteration in grain width and weight by influencing cell proliferation and expansion in glumes
TGW2	grain	Natural variation in the promoter of TGW2 determines grain width and weight in rice.	 TGW2 interacts with KRP1, a regulator of cell cycle in plant, to negatively regulate grain width and weight
TGW2	cell cycle	Natural variation in the promoter of TGW2 determines grain width and weight in rice.	 TGW2 interacts with KRP1, a regulator of cell cycle in plant, to negatively regulate grain width and weight
TGW2	breeding	Natural variation in the promoter of TGW2 determines grain width and weight in rice.	 Genetic diversity analysis of TGW2 in 141 rice accessions revealed it as a breeding target in a selective sweep region
TGW2	cell proliferation	Natural variation in the promoter of TGW2 determines grain width and weight in rice.	 <U+2022> A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation at 1818<U+00A0>bp upstream of TGW2 is responsible for its different expression, leading to alteration in grain width and weight by influencing cell proliferation and expansion in glumes
TGW2	grain width	Natural variation in the promoter of TGW2 determines grain width and weight in rice.	Natural variation in the promoter of TGW2 determines grain width and weight in rice.
