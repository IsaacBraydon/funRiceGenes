TAW1	inflorescence	TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition	 In contrast, reductions in TAWAWA1 (TAW1) activity cause precocious IM abortion and spikelet formation, resulting in the generation of small inflorescences| We thus propose that TAW1 is a unique regulator of meristem activity in rice and regulates inflorescence development through the promotion of IM activity and suppression of the phase change to SM identity
TAW1	spikelet	TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition	 In contrast, reductions in TAWAWA1 (TAW1) activity cause precocious IM abortion and spikelet formation, resulting in the generation of small inflorescences| TAW1 expression disappears from incipient spikelet meristems (SMs)
TAW1	shoot	TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition	 TAW1 encodes a nuclear protein of unknown function and shows high levels of expression in the shoot apical meristem, the IM, and the BMs
TAW1	spikelet meristem	TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition	 TAW1 expression disappears from incipient spikelet meristems (SMs)
TAW1	shoot apical meristem	TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition	 TAW1 encodes a nuclear protein of unknown function and shows high levels of expression in the shoot apical meristem, the IM, and the BMs
TAW1	meristem	TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition	 TAW1 encodes a nuclear protein of unknown function and shows high levels of expression in the shoot apical meristem, the IM, and the BMs| TAW1 expression disappears from incipient spikelet meristems (SMs)| We thus propose that TAW1 is a unique regulator of meristem activity in rice and regulates inflorescence development through the promotion of IM activity and suppression of the phase change to SM identity
TAW1	vegetative	TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition	 We also demonstrate that members of the SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE subfamily of MADS-box genes function downstream of TAW1
