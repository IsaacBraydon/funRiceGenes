OsG1L1	TAW1	The ALOG family members OsG1L1 and OsG1L2 regulate inflorescence branching in rice.	 Recently, by combining precise laser microdissection of inflorescence meristems with RNA-seq, we observed that two ALOG genes, OsG1-like 1 (OsG1L1) and OsG1L2, have expression profiles similar to that of TAW1
OsG1L1	TAW1	The ALOG family members OsG1L1 and OsG1L2 regulate inflorescence branching in rice.	 Here, we report that osg1l1 and osg1l2 loss-of-function CRISPR mutants have similar phenotypes to the phenotype of the previously published taw1 mutant, suggesting that these genes might act on related pathways during inflorescence development
