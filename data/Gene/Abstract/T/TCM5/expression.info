TCM5	 The TCM5 transcripts were highly expressed in all green tissues and undetectable in other tissues, showing the tissue-specific expression | The TCM5 encodes chloroplast-targeted Deg protease protein which is important for chloroplast development and the maintenance of PSII function and its disruption would lead to a defective chloroplast and affected expression levels of genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis at early rice seedling stage under high temperatures
