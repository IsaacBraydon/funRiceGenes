TPI|OsTPI1.1	culm	Cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase is a single gene in rice	A single TPI mRNA species of about 1100 nucleotides was detected by gel blot hybridization analysis of RNA isolated from root, culm, and leaf tissues, indicating that its expression is ubiquitous
TPI|OsTPI1.1	root	Cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase is a single gene in rice	A single TPI mRNA species of about 1100 nucleotides was detected by gel blot hybridization analysis of RNA isolated from root, culm, and leaf tissues, indicating that its expression is ubiquitous
TPI|OsTPI1.1	chloroplast	Cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase is a single gene in rice	Based on sequence comparison and molecular analysis, we propose that the chloroplast-located TPI may be encoded by divergent structural nuclear genes in rice
TPI|OsTPI1.1	leaf	Cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase is a single gene in rice	A single TPI mRNA species of about 1100 nucleotides was detected by gel blot hybridization analysis of RNA isolated from root, culm, and leaf tissues, indicating that its expression is ubiquitous
