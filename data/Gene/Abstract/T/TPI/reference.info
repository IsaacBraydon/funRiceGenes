Umeda-1994-Expressed sequence t.pdf	Expressed sequence tags from cultured cells of rice (Oryza sativa L.) under stressed conditions: analysis of transcripts of genes engaged in ATP-generating pathways	1994	Plant Mol Biol	Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.	Large-scale sequencing of randomly selected cDNA clones was used to isolate numerous genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Total RNA used for cDNA synthesis was prepared from suspension-cultured cells of rice grown under stressed conditions, such as in saline or nitrogen-starvation conditions. A total of 780 cDNA clones were partially sequenced and about 15% could be identified as putative genes. In the library constructed under saline conditions, we identified several genes associated with signal transduction, such as protein kinase and small GTP-binding protein genes. Many stress-related genes were isolated from both the saline and nitrogen-starvation libraries. These results indicate that stress treatment of suspension-cultured cells makes it possible to efficiently isolate various types of plant genes. To examine the usefulness of such tagged cDNAs for the study of gene expression in a specific metabolic pathway, we analyzed mRNA levels of genes engaged in the ATP-generating pathways in cultured cells of rice under different stresses, such as 20% sucrose, salt stress, cold stress and nitrogen-starvation stress. The results suggest that the coordinated induction of several genes in key steps under stressed conditions may be essential for activation of the entire energy-producing pathway to maintain homeostasis in rice cells. Expressed sequence tags identified by random cDNA sequencing provide the opportunity to generate a transcript map of rice genes.
Xu-1993-Cytosolic triosephos.pdf	Cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase is a single gene in rice	1993	Plant Physiol	Institute of Developmental and Molecular Biology, Texas A&M University, College Station 77843-3155.	A cDNA clone encoding rice (Oryza sativa L.) cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), an important glycolytic enzyme, was isolated and characterized. The clone (pRTPI-6) contains an open reading frame of 759 base pairs, encoding a polypeptide chain of 253 amino acid residues (M(r) 27,060). The identity of this clone was defined by its high homology (85% nucleotide sequence and 89% amino acid sequence identical match) with a maize mRNA sequence encoding the cytosolic TPI and with TPIs from other species. Genomic DNA blot analysis using the cDNA as a probe showed that the cytosolic TPI gene is present as a single copy per haploid rice genome, as opposed to that found in maize, in which multiple TPI gene copies exist. A single TPI mRNA species of about 1100 nucleotides was detected by gel blot hybridization analysis of RNA isolated from root, culm, and leaf tissues, indicating that its expression is ubiquitous. Based on sequence comparison and molecular analysis, we propose that the chloroplast-located TPI may be encoded by divergent structural nuclear genes in rice.
