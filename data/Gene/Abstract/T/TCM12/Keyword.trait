TCM12	chloroplast	Mutation of the rice TCM12 gene encoding 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase affects chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development at seedling stage at low temperatures.	Mutation of the rice TCM12 gene encoding 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase affects chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development at seedling stage at low temperatures.
TCM12	development	Mutation of the rice TCM12 gene encoding 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase affects chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development at seedling stage at low temperatures.	Mutation of the rice TCM12 gene encoding 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase affects chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development at seedling stage at low temperatures.
TCM12	seedling	Mutation of the rice TCM12 gene encoding 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase affects chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development at seedling stage at low temperatures.	Mutation of the rice TCM12 gene encoding 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase affects chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development at seedling stage at low temperatures.
TCM12	map-based cloning	Mutation of the rice TCM12 gene encoding 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase affects chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development at seedling stage at low temperatures.	 The inheritance behaviour and function of TCM12 were then analysed thorough map-based cloning, transgenic complementation and subcellular localisation
TCM12	photosynthesis	Mutation of the rice TCM12 gene encoding 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase affects chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development at seedling stage at low temperatures.	Mutation of the rice TCM12 gene encoding 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase affects chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development at seedling stage at low temperatures.
TCM12	photosynthesis	Mutation of the rice TCM12 gene encoding 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase affects chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development at seedling stage at low temperatures.	 In addition, TCM12 was constitutively expressed, and its disruption resulted in down-regulation of some genes associated with chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis at low temperatures (20 °C)
TCM12	nucleus	Mutation of the rice TCM12 gene encoding 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase affects chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development at seedling stage at low temperatures.	 The thermo-sensitive chlorosis phenotype was caused by a single nucleotide mutation (T→C) on the fifth exon of TCM12 (LOC_Os12g35040) encoding iPGAM, localised to both nucleus and membranes
TCM12	chloroplast development	Mutation of the rice TCM12 gene encoding 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase affects chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development at seedling stage at low temperatures.	Mutation of the rice TCM12 gene encoding 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase affects chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development at seedling stage at low temperatures.
