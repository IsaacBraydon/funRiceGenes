Male reproductive development involves a complex series of biological events and precise transcriptional regulation is essential for this biological process in flowering plants. Several transcriptional factors have been reported to regulate tapetum and pollen development; however, the transcriptional mechanism underlying Ubisch bodies and pollen wall formation remains less understood. Here, we characterized and isolated a male sterility mutant of TDR INTERACTION PROTEIN 3 (TIP3) in rice. The tip3 mutant displayed smaller and pale yellow anthers without mature pollen grains, abnormal Ubisch body morphology, no pollen wall formation as well as delayed tapetum degeneration. Map-based cloning demonstrated that TIP3 encodes a conserved PHD-finger protein and further study confirmed TIP3 functioned as a transcription factor with transcriptional activation activity. TIP3 is preferentially expressed in the tapetum and microspores during anther development. Moreover, TIP3 can physically interact with TDR which is a key component of the transcriptional cascade in regulating tapetum development and pollen wall formation. Furthermore, disruption of TIP3 changed the expression of several genes involved in tapetum development and degradation, biosynthesis and transport of lipid monomers of sporopollenin in tip3 mutant. Taken together, our results reveal an unprecedented role of TIP3 in regulating Ubisch bodies and pollen exine formation, which presents a potential tool to manipulate male fertility for hybrid rice breeding.
