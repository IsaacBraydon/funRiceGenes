TDR	TIP3	TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN 3 encoding a PHD-finger transcription factor regulates Ubisch bodies and pollen wall formation in rice.	 Here, we characterized and isolated a male sterility mutant of TDR INTERACTION PROTEIN 3 (TIP3) in rice
TDR	TIP3	TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN 3 encoding a PHD-finger transcription factor regulates Ubisch bodies and pollen wall formation in rice.	 Moreover, TIP3 can physically interact with TDR which is a key component of the transcriptional cascade in regulating tapetum development and pollen wall formation
