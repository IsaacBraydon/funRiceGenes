NA	A myosin XI adaptor, TAPE, is essential for pollen tube elongation in rice.	2022	Plant Physiol	Graduate School of Green-Bio Science &amp; Crop Biotech Institute, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, 17104, Republic of Korea.	Pollen tube (PT) elongation is important for double fertilization in angiosperms and affects the seed-setting rate and, therefore, crop productivity. Compared to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana L.), information on PT elongation in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is limited by the difficulty in obtaining homozygous mutants. In a screen of T-DNA insertional mutants, we identified a mutant in the Tethering protein of actomyosin transport in pollen tube elongation (TAPE) gene with an unusual segregation ratio by genotyping analysis. A CRISPR/Cas9 knockout mutant of TAPE that produced a short PT was sterile, and TAPE was expressed specifically in pollen grains. TAPE is a homolog of a myosin XI adaptor in Arabidopsis with three tetratricopeptide repeat and Phox and Bem1 protein domains. TAPE showed latrunculin B-sensitive, actin-dependent localization to the endoplasmic reticulum. Yeast two-hybrid screening and transcriptome analysis revealed that TAPE interacted with pollen-specific LIM protein 2b and elongation factor 1-alpha. Loss of TAPE affected transcription of 1,259 genes, especially genes related to cell organization, which were downregulated. In summary, TAPE encodes a myosin XI adaptor essential for rice PT elongation.
