NA	Natural Variations at TIG1 Encoding a TCP Transcription Factor Contribute to Plant Architecture Domestication in Rice.	2019	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.	The modification of plant architecture was a crucial target in rice domestication and modern genetic improvement. Although a fraction of genes regulating rice plant architecture have been characterized, the molecular mechanisms underlying rice plant architecture domestication has not been elucidated. Here we show that the phenotype of inclined growth tiller in wild rice is controlled by a single dominant gene, TILLER INCLINED GROWTH 1 (TIG1), which is on chromosome 8 and encodes a TCP transcriptional activator. The TIG1 mRNA is primarily enriched in the far-land side of tiller base, promotes cell elongation and enlarges the tiller angle in wild rice. Variations in the tig1 promoter of indica cultivars led to decreased expression of TIG1 in the far-land side of tiller base, reduced cell length and tiller angle, which led to the transition from inclined growth tiller of wild rice to the erect growth tiller during rice domestication. The TIG1 protein activates the expression of EXPA3, EXPB5 and SAUR39 to regulate cell elongation and increase the tiller angle. Selective sweep analysis revealed that the tig1 allele had been selected in indica cultivars by human beings. The cloning of TIG1 supports a new scenario of plant architecture evolution in rice.
