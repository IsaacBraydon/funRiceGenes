Symbol	Expression
TAC4|SG2	 In addition, OsOFP19, a negative regulator of grain shape, interacts with SG2 and plays an antagonistic role with SG2 in controlling gene expression and grain size
TAC4|SG2|OsBC17	 Caffeyl alcohol can be polymerized to the catechyl lignin monomer by laccase ChLAC8; however, ChLAC8 and OsBC17 are not homologous proteins, which suggests that the osbc17 gene is involved in this process by regulating laccase expression
