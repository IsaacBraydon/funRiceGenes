NA	TAC4 controls tiller angle by regulating the endogenous auxin content and distribution in rice 	2020	Plant Biotechnol J .	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.	Tiller angle, an important component of plant architecture, greatly influences the grain yield of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, we identified Tiller Angle Control 4 (TAC4) as a novel regulator of rice tiller angle. TAC4 encodes a plant-specific, highly conserved nuclear protein. The loss of TAC4 function leads to a significant increase in the tiller angle. TAC4 can regulate rice shoot gravitropism by increasing the indole acetic acid content and affecting the auxin distribution. A sequence analysis revealed that TAC4 has undergone a bottleneck and become fixed in indica cultivars during domestication and improvement. Our findings facilitate an increased understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of tiller angle and also provide a potential gene resource for the improvement of rice plant architecture. 
NA	Ribonuclease H-like gene Small Grain2 regulates grain size in rice through brassinosteroids signal pathway.	2022	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Nanjing National Field Scientific Observation and Research Station for Rice Germplasm, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Grain size is a key agronomic trait that determines the yield in plants. Regulation of grain size by brassinosteroids (BRs) in rice has been widely reported. However, the relationship between the BR signaling pathway and grain size still requires further study. Here, we isolated a rice mutant, named small grain2 (sg2), which displayed smaller grain and a semi-dwarf phenotype. The decreased grain size was caused by repressed cell expansion in spikelet hulls of the sg2 mutant. Using map-based cloning combined with a MutMap approach, we cloned SG2, which encodes a plant-specific protein with a Ribonuclease H-like domain. SG2 is a positive regulator downstream of GSK2 in response to BR signaling, and its mutation causes insensitivity to exogenous BR treatment. Genetical and biochemical analysis showed that GSK2 interacts with and phosphorylates SG2. We further found that BRs enhance the accumulation of SG2 in the nucleus, and subcellular distribution of SG2 is regulated by GSK2 kinase activity. In addition, OsOFP19, a negative regulator of grain shape, interacts with SG2 and plays an antagonistic role with SG2 in controlling gene expression and grain size. Our results indicated that SG2 is a new component of GSK2-related BR signaling response and regulates grain size by interacting with OsOFP19. This article is protected by copyright.
