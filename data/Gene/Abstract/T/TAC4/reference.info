NA	TAC4 controls tiller angle by regulating the endogenous auxin content and distribution in rice 	2020	Plant Biotechnol J .	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.	Tiller angle, an important component of plant architecture, greatly influences the grain yield of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, we identified Tiller Angle Control 4 (TAC4) as a novel regulator of rice tiller angle. TAC4 encodes a plant-specific, highly conserved nuclear protein. The loss of TAC4 function leads to a significant increase in the tiller angle. TAC4 can regulate rice shoot gravitropism by increasing the indole acetic acid content and affecting the auxin distribution. A sequence analysis revealed that TAC4 has undergone a bottleneck and become fixed in indica cultivars during domestication and improvement. Our findings facilitate an increased understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of tiller angle and also provide a potential gene resource for the improvement of rice plant architecture. 
NA	Ribonuclease H-like gene Small Grain2 regulates grain size in rice through brassinosteroids signal pathway.	2022	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Nanjing National Field Scientific Observation and Research Station for Rice Germplasm, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Grain size is a key agronomic trait that determines the yield in plants. Regulation of grain size by brassinosteroids (BRs) in rice has been widely reported. However, the relationship between the BR signaling pathway and grain size still requires further study. Here, we isolated a rice mutant, named small grain2 (sg2), which displayed smaller grain and a semi-dwarf phenotype. The decreased grain size was caused by repressed cell expansion in spikelet hulls of the sg2 mutant. Using map-based cloning combined with a MutMap approach, we cloned SG2, which encodes a plant-specific protein with a Ribonuclease H-like domain. SG2 is a positive regulator downstream of GSK2 in response to BR signaling, and its mutation causes insensitivity to exogenous BR treatment. Genetical and biochemical analysis showed that GSK2 interacts with and phosphorylates SG2. We further found that BRs enhance the accumulation of SG2 in the nucleus, and subcellular distribution of SG2 is regulated by GSK2 kinase activity. In addition, OsOFP19, a negative regulator of grain shape, interacts with SG2 and plays an antagonistic role with SG2 in controlling gene expression and grain size. Our results indicated that SG2 is a new component of GSK2-related BR signaling response and regulates grain size by interacting with OsOFP19. This article is protected by copyright.

NA	BRITTLE CULM17, a Novel Allele of TAC4, Affects the Mechanical Properties of Rice Plants.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	The State Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide and Agricultural Biological Engineering, Center for Research and Development of Fine Chemicals, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China.	Lodging resistance of rice (Oryza sativa L.) has always been a hot issue in agricultural production. A brittle stem mutant, osbc17, was identified by screening an EMS (Ethylmethane sulfonate) mutant library established in our laboratory. The stem segments and leaves of the mutant were obviously brittle and fragile, with low mechanical strength. Examination of paraffin sections of flag leaf and internode samples indicated that the number of cell layers in mechanical tissue of the mutant was decreased compared with the wild type, Pingtangheinuo, and scanning electron microscopy revealed that the mechanical tissue cell walls of the mutant were thinner. Lignin contents of the internodes of mature-stage rice were significantly lower in the mutant than in the wild type. By the MutMap method, we found candidate gene OsBC17, which was located on rice chromosome 2 and had a 2433 bp long coding sequence encoding a protein sequence of 810 amino acid residues with unknown function. According to LC-MS/MS analysis of intermediate products of the lignin synthesis pathway, the accumulation of caffeyl alcohol in the osbc17 mutant was significantly higher than in Pingtangheinuo. Caffeyl alcohol can be polymerized to the catechyl lignin monomer by laccase ChLAC8; however, ChLAC8 and OsBC17 are not homologous proteins, which suggests that the osbc17 gene is involved in this process by regulating laccase expression.
