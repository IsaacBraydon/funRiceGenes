GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	TAC4|SG2|OsBC17	Ribonuclease H-like gene Small Grain2 regulates grain size in rice through brassinosteroids signal pathway.	 SG2 is a positive regulator downstream of GSK2 in response to BR signaling, and its mutation causes insensitivity to exogenous BR treatment
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	TAC4|SG2|OsBC17	Ribonuclease H-like gene Small Grain2 regulates grain size in rice through brassinosteroids signal pathway.	 Genetical and biochemical analysis showed that GSK2 interacts with and phosphorylates SG2
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	TAC4|SG2|OsBC17	Ribonuclease H-like gene Small Grain2 regulates grain size in rice through brassinosteroids signal pathway.	 We further found that BRs enhance the accumulation of SG2 in the nucleus, and subcellular distribution of SG2 is regulated by GSK2 kinase activity
OsOFP19	TAC4|SG2|OsBC17	Ribonuclease H-like gene Small Grain2 regulates grain size in rice through brassinosteroids signal pathway.	 In addition, OsOFP19, a negative regulator of grain shape, interacts with SG2 and plays an antagonistic role with SG2 in controlling gene expression and grain size
OsOFP19	TAC4|SG2|OsBC17	Ribonuclease H-like gene Small Grain2 regulates grain size in rice through brassinosteroids signal pathway.	 Our results indicated that SG2 is a new component of GSK2-related BR signaling response and regulates grain size by interacting with OsOFP19
