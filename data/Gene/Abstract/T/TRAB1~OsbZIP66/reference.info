Nijhawan-2008-Genomic survey and g.pdf	Genomic survey and gene expression analysis of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family in rice	2008	Plant Physiol	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.	The basic leucine (Leu) zipper (bZIP) proteins compose a family of transcriptional regulators present exclusively in eukaryotes. The bZIP proteins characteristically harbor a bZIP domain composed of two structural features: a DNA-binding basic region and the Leu zipper dimerization region. They have been shown to regulate diverse plant-specific phenomena, including seed maturation and germination, floral induction and development, and photomorphogenesis, and are also involved in stress and hormone signaling. We have identified 89 bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Their chromosomal distribution and sequence analyses suggest that the bZIP transcription factor family has evolved via gene duplication. The phylogenetic relationship among rice bZIP domains as well as with bZIP domains from other plant bZIP factors suggests that homologous bZIP domains exist in plants. Similar intron/exon structural patterns were observed in the basic and hinge regions of their bZIP domains. Detailed sequence analysis has been done to identify additional conserved motifs outside the bZIP domain and to predict their DNA-binding site specificity as well as dimerization properties, which has helped classify them into different groups and subfamilies, respectively. Expression of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes has been analyzed by full-length cDNA and expressed sequence tag-based expression profiling. This expression profiling was complemented by microarray analysis. The results indicate specific or coexpression patterns of rice bZIP transcription factors starting from floral transition to various stages of panicle and seed development. bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice also displayed differential expression patterns in rice seedlings in response to abiotic stress and light irradiation. An effort has been made to link the structure and expression pattern of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice to their function, based on the information obtained from our analyses and earlier known results. This information will be important for functional characterization of bZIP transcription factors in rice.
PC14123177.pdf	Abscisic Acid-Induced Transcription Is Mediated by Phosphorylation of an Abscisic Acid Response Element Binding Factor, TRAB1	2002	The Plant Cell Online	Center for Molecular Biology and Genetics, Mie University, 1515 Kamihama-cho, Tsu 514-8507, Japan.	The rice basic domain/Leu zipper factor TRAB1 binds to abscisic acid (ABA) response elements and mediates ABA signals to activate transcription. We show that TRAB1 is phosphorylated rapidly in an in vivo labeling experiment and by phosphatase-sensitive mobility shifts on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. We had shown previously that a chimeric promoter containing GAL4 binding sites became ABA inducible when a GAL4 binding domain-TRAB1 fusion protein was present. This expression system allowed us to assay the ABA response function of TRAB1. Using this system, we show that Ser-102 of TRAB1 is critical for this function. Because no ABA-induced mobility shift was observed when Ser-102 was replaced by Ala, we suggest that this Ser residue is phosphorylated in response to ABA. Cell fractionation experiments, as well as fluorescence microscopy observations of transiently expressed green fluorescent protein-TRAB1 fusion protein, indicated that TRAB1 was localized in the nucleus independently of ABA. Our results suggest that the terminal or nearly terminal event of the primary ABA signal transduction pathway is the phosphorylation in the nucleus of preexisting TRAB1.
PNAS-1999-Hobo-15348-53.pdf	A bZIP factor, TRAB1, interacts with VP1 and mediates abscisic acid-induced transcription	1999	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Center for Molecular Biology, Mie University, 1515 Kamihama-cho, Tsu 514-8507, Japan.	The transcription factor VP1 regulates maturation and dormancy in plant seeds by activating genes responsive to the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Although activation involves ABA-responsive elements (ABREs), VP1 itself does not specifically bind ABREs. Instead, we have identified and cloned a basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) factor, TRAB1, that interacts with both VP1 and ABREs. Transcription from a chimeric promoter with GAL4-binding sites was ABA-inducible if cells expressed a GAL4 DNA-binding domain::TRAB1 fusion protein. Results indicate that TRAB1 is a true trans-acting factor involved in ABA-regulated transcription and reveal a molecular mechanism for the VP1-dependent, ABA-inducible transcription that controls maturation and dormancy in plant embryos.
NA	OsMFT2 is involved in the regulation of ABA signaling-mediated seed germination through interacting with OsbZIP23/66/72 in rice 	2020	plant J.	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Seed germination is a complex process involving various physical and biochemical cues, determined by exogenous and endogenous factors. Here, we identified a gene, OsMFT2, that negatively regulates seed germination in rice. OsMFT2 knock-out lines exhibited pre-harvest sprouting, whereas OsMFT2 overexpression lines showed delayed germination. RNA expression profiling showed that OsMFT2 was specifically expressed in seeds. Subcellular localization indicated that OsMFT2 was a nuclear protein. Exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatment of imbibed seeds and seedlings indicated that OsMFT2 altered ABA sensitivity during seed germination and post-germination growth. In vivo and in vitro assays showed that three bZIP transcription factors, OsbZIP23, OsbZIP66 and OsbZIP72, interacted with OsMFT2. OsbZIP23/66/72 bound to the promoter of Rab16A, a typical gene containing the ABA-responsive element, and OsMFT2 enhanced the binding to the Rab16A promoter. Moreover, several ABA-responsive genes were differentially expressed in the imbibed seeds of OsMFT2 transgenic lines and the wild type. The performance of the transgenic plants demonstrated that overexpressing OsbZIP23 rescued the pre-harvest sprouting phenotype and the decrease in ABA-signaling genes expression caused by OsMFT2 knock-out. All of these results demonstrate that OsMFT2 positively regulates ABA-responsive genes through interacting with OsbZIP23/66/72 and functions in seed germination.
