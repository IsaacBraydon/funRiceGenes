TRAB1|OsbZIP66	dormancy	A bZIP factor, TRAB1, interacts with VP1 and mediates abscisic acid-induced transcription	Results indicate that TRAB1 is a true trans-acting factor involved in ABA-regulated transcription and reveal a molecular mechanism for the VP1-dependent, ABA-inducible transcription that controls maturation and dormancy in plant embryos
TRAB1|OsbZIP66	 ABA 	Abscisic Acid-Induced Transcription Is Mediated by Phosphorylation of an Abscisic Acid Response Element Binding Factor, TRAB1	The rice basic domain/Leu zipper factor TRAB1 binds to abscisic acid (ABA) response elements and mediates ABA signals to activate transcription
TRAB1|OsbZIP66	 ABA 	Abscisic Acid-Induced Transcription Is Mediated by Phosphorylation of an Abscisic Acid Response Element Binding Factor, TRAB1	We had shown previously that a chimeric promoter containing GAL4 binding sites became ABA inducible when a GAL4 binding domain-TRAB1 fusion protein was present
TRAB1|OsbZIP66	 ABA 	Abscisic Acid-Induced Transcription Is Mediated by Phosphorylation of an Abscisic Acid Response Element Binding Factor, TRAB1	This expression system allowed us to assay the ABA response function of TRAB1
TRAB1|OsbZIP66	 ABA 	Abscisic Acid-Induced Transcription Is Mediated by Phosphorylation of an Abscisic Acid Response Element Binding Factor, TRAB1	Our results suggest that the terminal or nearly terminal event of the primary ABA signal transduction pathway is the phosphorylation in the nucleus of preexisting TRAB1
