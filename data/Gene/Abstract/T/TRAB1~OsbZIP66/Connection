OSVP1|VP1	TRAB1|OsbZIP66	A bZIP factor, TRAB1, interacts with VP1 and mediates abscisic acid-induced transcription	Instead, we have identified and cloned a basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) factor, TRAB1, that interacts with both VP1 and ABREs
OSVP1|VP1	TRAB1|OsbZIP66	A bZIP factor, TRAB1, interacts with VP1 and mediates abscisic acid-induced transcription	Results indicate that TRAB1 is a true trans-acting factor involved in ABA-regulated transcription and reveal a molecular mechanism for the VP1-dependent, ABA-inducible transcription that controls maturation and dormancy in plant embryos
OSVP1|VP1	TRAB1|OsbZIP66	A bZIP factor, TRAB1, interacts with VP1 and mediates abscisic acid-induced transcription	A bZIP factor, TRAB1, interacts with VP1 and mediates abscisic acid-induced transcription
OsMFT2	TRAB1|OsbZIP66	OsMFT2 is involved in the regulation of ABA signaling-mediated seed germination through interacting with OsbZIP23/66/72 in rice.	 In vivo and in vitro assays showed that three bZIP transcription factors, OsbZIP23, OsbZIP66 and OsbZIP72, interacted with OsMFT2
