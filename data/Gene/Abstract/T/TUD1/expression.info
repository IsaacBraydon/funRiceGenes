Symbol	Expression
TUD1|DSG1	 The DSG1 protein is nuclear- and cytoplasm-localized and does not show tissue specificity in terms of its expression, which occurs in roots, culms, leaves, sheaths, and spikelets |  The dsg1 mutant is less sensitive to brassinosteroid treatment than the wild-type, and DSG1 expression is negatively regulated by brassinosteroids, ethylene, auxin, and salicylic acid
TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	 Microarray analysis showed that the gene expression profile of elf1-1 was distinct from that of d61-12 (a leaky mutant of OsBRI1 with a phenotype similar to that of elf1-1), and fewer than half of genes differentially expressed between the wild-type and elf1-1 showed similar differences in d61-12 relative to the wild-type |  Gene expression analysis showed that some stress response-related genes were induced in elf1-1 but not in d61-12, and 8 of 9 genes oppositely regulated in elf1-1 and d61-12 were significantly up- or down-regulated in both elf1-1 and jasmonic acid-treated wild-type
