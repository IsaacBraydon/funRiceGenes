D1|RGA1	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase TUD1 functions with a heterotrimeric G alpha subunit to regulate Brassinosteroid-mediated growth in rice	In this study, we report a D1 genetic interactor Taihu Dwarf1 (TUD1) that encodes a functional U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase
D1|RGA1	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase TUD1 functions with a heterotrimeric G alpha subunit to regulate Brassinosteroid-mediated growth in rice	Genetic, phenotypic, and physiological analyses have shown that tud1 is epistatic to d1 and is less sensitive to BR treatment
D1|RGA1	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase TUD1 functions with a heterotrimeric G alpha subunit to regulate Brassinosteroid-mediated growth in rice	Furthermore, we found that D1 directly interacts with TUD1
D1|RGA1	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase TUD1 functions with a heterotrimeric G alpha subunit to regulate Brassinosteroid-mediated growth in rice	Taken together, these results demonstrate that D1 and TUD1 act together to mediate a BR-signaling pathway
D61|OsBRI1	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	Rice ERECT LEAF 1 acts in an alternative brassinosteroid signaling pathway independent of the receptor kinase OsBRI1.	 A double mutant obtained by crossing elf1-1 (a null mutant of ELF1) with d61-1 (a leaky mutant of OsBRI1) showed a more severe phenotype than did the elf1-1 single mutant, resembling that of a severe brassinosteroid-deficient mutant
D61|OsBRI1	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	Rice ERECT LEAF 1 acts in an alternative brassinosteroid signaling pathway independent of the receptor kinase OsBRI1.	 These results indicate that less than half of ELF1-regulated genes in rice seedlings are affected by OsBRI1, and suggest that ELF1 acts in a rice brassinosteroid signaling pathway different from that initiated by OsBRI1
