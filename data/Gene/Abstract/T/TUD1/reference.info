Heterotrimeric G proteins are an important group of signaling molecules found in eukaryotes. They function with G-protein-coupled-receptors (GPCRs) to transduce various signals such as steroid hormones in animals. Nevertheless, their functions in plants are not well-defined. Previous studies suggested that the heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit known as D1/RGA1 in rice is involved in a phytohormone gibberellin-mediated signaling pathway. Evidence also implicates D1 in the action of a second phytohormone Brassinosteroid (BR) and its pathway. However, it is unclear how D1 functions in this pathway, because so far no partner has been identified to act with D1. In this study, we report a D1 genetic interactor Taihu Dwarf1 (TUD1) that encodes a functional U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase. Genetic, phenotypic, and physiological analyses have shown that tud1 is epistatic to d1 and is less sensitive to BR treatment. Histological observations showed that the dwarf phenotype of tud1 is mainly due to decreased cell proliferation and disorganized cell files in aerial organs. Furthermore, we found that D1 directly interacts with TUD1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that D1 and TUD1 act together to mediate a BR-signaling pathway. This supports the idea that a D1-mediated BR signaling pathway occurs in rice to affect plant growth and development.
NA	Dwarf and short grain 1, encoding a putative U-box protein regulates cell division and elongation in rice.	2016	J Plant Physiol	Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, Rice Research Institute of Southwest University, Chongqing, 400716, PR China.	Plant hormones coordinate a plant's responses to environmental stimuli and the endogenous developmental programs for cell division and elongation. Brassinosteroids are among the most important of these hormones in plant development. Recently, the ubiquitin-26S-proteasome system was identified to play a key role in hormone biology. In this study, we analyzed the function of a rice (Oryza sativa) gene, DSG1, which encodes a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase. In the dsg1 mutant (an allelic mutant of tud1), the lengths of the roots, internodes, panicles, and seeds were shorter than that in the wild-type, which was due to defects in cell division and elongation. In addition, the leaves of the dsg1 mutant were wider and curled. The DSG1 protein is nuclear- and cytoplasm-localized and does not show tissue specificity in terms of its expression, which occurs in roots, culms, leaves, sheaths, and spikelets. The dsg1 mutant is less sensitive to brassinosteroid treatment than the wild-type, and DSG1 expression is negatively regulated by brassinosteroids, ethylene, auxin, and salicylic acid. These results demonstrate that DSG1 positively regulates cell division and elongation and may be involved in multiple hormone pathways.
NA	Rice ERECT LEAF 1 acts in an alternative brassinosteroid signaling pathway independent of the receptor kinase OsBRI1.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	a Department of Bioproduction Science , Faculty of Bioresources and Environmental Sciences, Ishikawa Prefectural University , Ishikawa , Japan.	ERECT LEAF 1 (ELF1) was previously identified as a component of brassinosteroid signaling in rice. A double mutant obtained by crossing elf1-1 (a null mutant of ELF1) with d61-1 (a leaky mutant of OsBRI1) showed a more severe phenotype than did the elf1-1 single mutant, resembling that of a severe brassinosteroid-deficient mutant. Microarray analysis showed that the gene expression profile of elf1-1 was distinct from that of d61-12 (a leaky mutant of OsBRI1 with a phenotype similar to that of elf1-1), and fewer than half of genes differentially expressed between the wild-type and elf1-1 showed similar differences in d61-12 relative to the wild-type. These results indicate that less than half of ELF1-regulated genes in rice seedlings are affected by OsBRI1, and suggest that ELF1 acts in a rice brassinosteroid signaling pathway different from that initiated by OsBRI1. Gene expression analysis showed that some stress response-related genes were induced in elf1-1 but not in d61-12, and 8 of 9 genes oppositely regulated in elf1-1 and d61-12 were significantly up- or down-regulated in both elf1-1 and jasmonic acid-treated wild-type. These results imply that ELF1 suppresses stress-induced signalling, and that jasmonic acid signaling is stimulated in elf1-1; therefore, ELF1 may be involved in the brassinosteroid-mediated suppression of jasmonic acid response in rice.
NA	An E3 ubiquitin ligase, ERECT LEAF1, functions in brassinosteroid signaling of rice.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	RIKEN Advanced Science Institute; Saitama, Japan.	A spontaneous rice mutant, erect leaf1 (elf1-1), produced a dwarf phenotype with erect leaves and short grains. Physiological analyses suggested that elf1-1 is brassinosteroid-insensitive, so we hypothesized that ELF1 encodes a positive regulator of brassinosteroid signaling. ELF1, identified by means of positional cloning, encodes a protein with both a U-box domain and ARMADILLO (ARM) repeats. U-box proteins have been shown to function as E3 ubiquitin ligases; in fact, ELF1 possessed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. However, ELF1 itself does not appear to be polyubiquitinated. Mutant phenotypes of 2 more elf1 alleles indicate that the entire ARM repeats is indispensable for ELF1 activity. These results suggest that ELF1 ubiquitinates target proteins through an interaction mediated by ARM repeats. Similarities in the phenotypes of elf1 and d61 mutants (mutants of brassinosteroid receptor gene OsBRI1), and in the regulation of ELF1 and OsBRI1 expression, imply that ELF1 functions as a positive regulator of brassinosteroid signaling in rice.
NA	ERECT LEAF1 suppresses jasmonic acid response in rice by decreasing OsWRKY4 stability.	2018	Plant Signal Behav	a Faculty of Bioresources and Environmental Sciences , Ishikawa Prefectural University , Ishikawa , Japan.	ERECT LEAF 1 (ELF1), which was identified as a component of brassinosteroid signaling in rice, is involved in brassinosteroid-mediated suppression of jasmonic acid response. Here, by conducting yeast two-hybrid assay and in vitro ubiquitination experiments, we demonstrate that ELF1 interacts with the OsWRKY4 transcription factor, a positive regulator of defense responses to rice sheath blight. ELF1 decreased the stability of OsWRKY4, whereas exogenous jasmonic acid treatment suppressed this effect of ELF1, resulting in OsWRKY4 accumulation in rice plants. In wild-type rice, OsWRKY4 expression was up-regulated by jasmonic acid treatment but down-regulated by brassinosteroid treatment, suggesting that jasmonic acid-induced OsWRKY4 accumulation was caused by a combination of increased production and suppressed degradation. The expression levels of the OsWRKY4 target genes, PR1b and PR5, seemed to be correlated with the OsWRKY4 level. These results suggest that ELF1 indirectly controls the expression of PR1b and PR5 genes by regulating the OsWRKY4 protein level, and support a hypothesis that brassinosteroid and jasmonic acid cooperate to maintain the balance between growth and defense responses. We conclude that ELF1 participates in the antagonistic interaction between these two phytohormones by suppressing the jasmonic acid response through the down-regulation of OsWRKY4 protein level in rice.
