NA	RNase Z(S1) processes UbL40 mRNAs and controls thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice	2014	Nat Commun	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources; Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Biotechnology of Guangdong Provincial Higher Education Institutions; College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.	Thermosensitive genic male-sterile (TGMS) lines, which are male-sterile at restrictive (high) temperatures but male-fertile at permissive (low) temperatures, have been widely used in breeding two-line hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here we find that mutation of thermosensitive genic male sterile 5 (tms5) in rice causes the TGMS trait through a loss of RNase Z(S1) function. We show that RNase Z(S1) processes the mRNAs of three ubiquitin fusion ribosomal protein L40 (UbL40) genes into multiple fragments in vitro and in vivo. In tms5 mutants, high temperature results in increased levels of UbL40 mRNAs. Overaccumulation of UbL40 mRNAs causes defective pollen production and male sterility. Our results uncover a novel mechanism of RNase Z(S1)-mediated UbL40 mRNA regulation and shows that loss of this regulation produces TGMS in rice, a finding with potential applications in hybrid crop breeding.
NA	Development of Commercial Thermo-sensitive Genic Male Sterile Rice Accelerates Hybrid Rice Breeding Using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated TMS5 Editing System.	2016	Sci Rep	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, Guangzhou 510642, China.	Hybrid rice breeding offers an important strategy to improve rice production, in which the cultivation of a male sterile line is the key to the success of cross-breeding. CRISPR/Cas9 systems have been widely used in target-site genome editing, whereas their application for crop genetic improvement has been rarely reported. Here, using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we induced specific mutations in TMS5, which is the most widely applied thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) gene in China, and developed new &quot;transgene clean&quot; TGMS lines. We designed 10 target sites in the coding region of TMS5 for targeted mutagenesis using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and assessed the potential rates of on- and off-target effects. Finally, we established the most efficient construct, the TMS5ab construct, for breeding potentially applicable &quot;transgene clean&quot; TGMS lines. We also discussed factors that affect the editing efficiency according to the characteristics of different target sequences. Notably, using the TMS5ab construct, we developed 11 new &quot;transgene clean&quot; TGMS lines with potential applications in hybrid breeding within only one year in both rice subspecies. The application of our system not only significantly accelerates the breeding of sterile lines but also facilitates the exploitation of heterosis.
NA	Generation of a new thermo-sensitive genic male sterile rice line by targeted mutagenesis of TMS5 gene through CRISPR/Cas9 system.	2019	BMC Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, China.	BACKGROUND: Two-line hybrid rice with high yield potential is increasingly popular and temperature-sensitive male sterile line is one of the basic components for two-line hybrid rice breeding. The development of male sterile lines through conventional breeding is a lengthy and laborious process, whereas developing thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) lines for two-line hybrid breeding by editing a temperature-sensitivity gene by CRISPR/Cas9 is efficient and convenient. RESULTS: Here, thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) was induced by employing the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to modify the gene TMS5. Two TGMS mutants, tms5-1 and tms5-2, both lacking any residual T-DNA, were generated in the indica rice cultivar Zhongjiazao17 (cv. YK17) background. When grown at a sub-optimal temperature (22 °C), both mutants produced viable pollen and successfully produced grain through self-fertilization, but at temperatures 24 and 26 °C, their pollen was sterile and no grain was set. F(1) hybrids derived from the crosses between YK17S (tms5-1) and three different restorer lines outperformed both parental lines with respect to grain yield and related traits. CONCLUSION: The YK17S generated by CRISPR/Cas9 system was proved to be a new TGMS line with superior yield potential and can be widely utilized in two-line hybrid breeding of indica rice.
NA	CRISPR/Cas9-Induced Mutagenesis of TMS5 Confers Thermosensitive Genic Male Sterility by Influencing Protein Expression in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2022	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, College of Agriculture, Guangxi University, Nanning 530004, China.	The development of thermosensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) lines is the key to breeding two-line hybrid rice, which has been widely applied in China to increase grain yield. CRISPR/Cas9 has been widely used in genome editing to create novel mutants in rice. In the present study, a super grain quality line, GXU 47, was used to generate a new TGMS line with specific mutations in a major TGMS gene tms5 generated with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in order to improve the rice quality of two-line hybrids. A mutagenesis efficiency level of 75% was achieved, and three homozygous T-DNA-free mutant lines were screened out. The mutants exhibited excellent thermosensitive male fertility transformation characteristics with complete male sterility at ≥24 °C and desirable male fertility at around 21 °C. Proteomic analysis based on isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) was performed to unveil the subsequent proteomic changes. A total of 192 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), including 35 upregulated and 157 downregulated, were found. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the DEPs were involved in a single-organism biosynthetic process, a single-organism metabolic process, oxidoreductase activity, and catalytic activity. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the DEPs were involved in ubiquinone and other terpenoid quinone biosynthesis, the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, metabolic pathways, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Our study shows that high mutation efficiency was achieved in both target sites, and T-DNA-free mutant lines were obtained in the T(1) generation. The present study results prove that it is feasible and efficient to generate an excellent mutant line with CRISPR/Cas9, which provides a novel molecular mechanism of male sterility caused by the mutation of tms5.
