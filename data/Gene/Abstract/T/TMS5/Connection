OsbHLH138	TMS5	The transcription factor OsbHLH138 regulates thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice via activation of TMS5.	The transcription factor OsbHLH138 regulates thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice via activation of TMS5.
OsbHLH138	TMS5	The transcription factor OsbHLH138 regulates thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice via activation of TMS5.	 By altering expression of OsbHLH138, we can regulate the expression level of TMS5 and the accumulation of UbL40 mRNAs to command the male fertility in different temperatures
