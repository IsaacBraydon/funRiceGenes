OsbHLH138	TMS5	The transcription factor OsbHLH138 regulates thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice via activation of TMS5.	The transcription factor OsbHLH138 regulates thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice via activation of TMS5.
OsbHLH138	TMS5	The transcription factor OsbHLH138 regulates thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice via activation of TMS5.	 By altering expression of OsbHLH138, we can regulate the expression level of TMS5 and the accumulation of UbL40 mRNAs to command the male fertility in different temperatures
OsTMS18	TMS5	Mutation of glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase leads to thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice and Arabidopsis.	 ostms18 sterility is more stable in summer than the TGMS line carrying the widely used locus tms5 in the ZH11 genetic background, suggesting its potential application for rice breeding
