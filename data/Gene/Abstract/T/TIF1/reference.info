NA	Natural variation in Tiller Number 1 affects its interaction with TIF1 to regulate tillering in rice.	2023	Plant Biotechnol J	MOE Key Laboratory of Crop Heterosis and Utilization/Beijing Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.	Tiller number per plant-a cardinal component of ideal plant architecture-affects grain yield potential. Thus, alleles positively affecting tillering must be mined to promote genetic improvement. Here, we report a Tiller Number 1 (TN1) protein harbouring a bromo-adjacent homology domain and RNA recognition motifs, identified through genome-wide association study of tiller numbers. Natural variation in TN1 affects its interaction with TIF1 (TN1 interaction factor 1) to affect DWARF14 expression and negatively regulate tiller number in rice. Further analysis of variations in TN1 among indica genotypes according to geographical distribution revealed that low-tillering varieties with TN1-hap(L) are concentrated in Southeast Asia and East Asia, whereas high-tillering varieties with TN1-hap(H) are concentrated in South Asia. Taken together, these results indicate that TN1 is a tillering regulatory factor whose alleles present apparent preferential utilization across geographical regions. Our findings advance the molecular understanding of tiller development.
