NA	Temperature-sensitive albino gene TCD5, encoding a monooxygenase, affects chloroplast development at low temperatures.	2016	J Exp Bot	Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China.	Chloroplasts are essential for photosynthesis and play critical roles in plant development. In this study, we characterized the temperature-sensitive chlorophyll-deficient rice mutant tcd5, which develops albino leaves at low temperatures (20 째C) and normal green leaves at high temperatures (32 째C). The development of chloroplasts and etioplasts is impaired in tcd5 plants at 20 째C, and the temperature-sensitive period for the albino phenotype is the P4 stage of leaf development. The development of thylakoid membranes is arrested at the mid-P4 stage in tcd5 plants at 20 째C. We performed positional cloning of TCD5 and then complementation and knock-down experiments, and the results showed that the transcript LOC_Os05g34040.1 from the LOC_Os05g34040 gene corresponded to the tcd5 phenotype. TCD5 encodes a conserved plastid-targeted monooxygenase family protein which has not been previously reported associated with a temperature-sensitive albino phenotype in plants. TCD5 is abundantly expressed in young leaves and immature spikes, and low temperatures increased this expression. The transcription of some genes involved in plastid transcription/translation and photosynthesis varied in the tcd5 mutant. Although the phenotype and temperature dependence of the TCD5 orthologous mutant phenotype were different in rice and Arabidopsis, OsTCD5 could rescue the phenotype of the Arabidopsis mutant, suggesting that TCD5 function is conserved between monocots and dicots.
NA	Heavy-ion beam mutagenesis identified an essential gene for chloroplast development under cold stress conditions during both early growth and tillering stages in rice.	2016	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	a Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science, RIKEN, Wako , Japan.	We isolated a cold sensitive virescent1 (csv1) mutant from a rice (Oryza sativa L.) population mutagenized by carbon ion irradiation. The mutant exhibited chlorotic leaves during the early growth stages, and produced normal green leaves as it grew. The growth of csv1 plants displayed sensitivity to low temperatures. In addition, the mutant plants that were transferred to low temperatures at the fifth leaf stage produced chlorotic leaves subsequently. Genetic and molecular analyses revealed translocation of a 13-kb genomic fragment that disrupted the causative gene (CSV1; LOC_Os05g34040). CSV1 encodes a plastid-targeted oxidoreductase-like protein conserved among land plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria. Furthermore, CSV1 transcripts were more abundant in immature than in mature leaves, and they did not markedly increase or decrease with temperature. Taken together, our results indicate that CSV1 supports chloroplast development under cold stress conditions, in both the early growth and tillering stages in rice.
