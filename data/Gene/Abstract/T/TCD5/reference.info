NA	Temperature-sensitive albino gene TCD5, encoding a monooxygenase, affects chloroplast development at low temperatures.	2016	J Exp Bot	Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China.	Chloroplasts are essential for photosynthesis and play critical roles in plant development. In this study, we characterized the temperature-sensitive chlorophyll-deficient rice mutant tcd5, which develops albino leaves at low temperatures (20 째C) and normal green leaves at high temperatures (32 째C). The development of chloroplasts and etioplasts is impaired in tcd5 plants at 20 째C, and the temperature-sensitive period for the albino phenotype is the P4 stage of leaf development. The development of thylakoid membranes is arrested at the mid-P4 stage in tcd5 plants at 20 째C. We performed positional cloning of TCD5 and then complementation and knock-down experiments, and the results showed that the transcript LOC_Os05g34040.1 from the LOC_Os05g34040 gene corresponded to the tcd5 phenotype. TCD5 encodes a conserved plastid-targeted monooxygenase family protein which has not been previously reported associated with a temperature-sensitive albino phenotype in plants. TCD5 is abundantly expressed in young leaves and immature spikes, and low temperatures increased this expression. The transcription of some genes involved in plastid transcription/translation and photosynthesis varied in the tcd5 mutant. Although the phenotype and temperature dependence of the TCD5 orthologous mutant phenotype were different in rice and Arabidopsis, OsTCD5 could rescue the phenotype of the Arabidopsis mutant, suggesting that TCD5 function is conserved between monocots and dicots.
NA	Heavy-ion beam mutagenesis identified an essential gene for chloroplast development under cold stress conditions during both early growth and tillering stages in rice.	2016	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	a Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science, RIKEN, Wako , Japan.	We isolated a cold sensitive virescent1 (csv1) mutant from a rice (Oryza sativa L.) population mutagenized by carbon ion irradiation. The mutant exhibited chlorotic leaves during the early growth stages, and produced normal green leaves as it grew. The growth of csv1 plants displayed sensitivity to low temperatures. In addition, the mutant plants that were transferred to low temperatures at the fifth leaf stage produced chlorotic leaves subsequently. Genetic and molecular analyses revealed translocation of a 13-kb genomic fragment that disrupted the causative gene (CSV1; LOC_Os05g34040). CSV1 encodes a plastid-targeted oxidoreductase-like protein conserved among land plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria. Furthermore, CSV1 transcripts were more abundant in immature than in mature leaves, and they did not markedly increase or decrease with temperature. Taken together, our results indicate that CSV1 supports chloroplast development under cold stress conditions, in both the early growth and tillering stages in rice.
NA	TSV, a putative plastidic oxidoreductase, protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress during development by interacting with plastidic thioredoxin Z.	2017	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice is vulnerable to cold stress. Seedlings are very sensitive to cold stress and this harms global rice production. The effects of cold on chloroplast development are well known, but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we isolated a temperature-sensitive virescent (tsv) mutant that is extremely sensitive to cold stress. It displayed defective chloroplasts, decreased chlorophyll and zero survivorship under cold stress. We isolated and identified TSV by map-based cloning and rescue experiments, combined with genetic, cytological and molecular biological analyses. We found that TSV, a putative plastidic oxidoreductase, is a new type of virescent protein. A mutation in tsv causes premature termination of the gene product. The activity of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) and the expression of genes participating in chlorophyll synthesis were severely reduced in the tsv mutant under cold stress, but not at normal temperatures. TSV expression was induced by low temperatures. Strikingly, TSV interacted with OsTrxZ (a subunit of PEP in chloroplasts) and enhanced OsTrxZ stability under low temperatures. We demonstrated that TSV protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress by interacting with OsTrxZ. These results provide novel insights into ways in which rice chloroplast development and chlorophyll synthesis are protected by TSV under cold stress.
