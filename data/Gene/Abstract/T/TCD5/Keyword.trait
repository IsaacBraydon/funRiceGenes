TCD5|CSV1	leaf	Temperature-sensitive albino gene TCD5, encoding a monooxygenase, affects chloroplast development at low temperatures.	 The development of chloroplasts and etioplasts is impaired in tcd5 plants at 20 째C, and the temperature-sensitive period for the albino phenotype is the P4 stage of leaf development
TCD5|CSV1	temperature	Temperature-sensitive albino gene TCD5, encoding a monooxygenase, affects chloroplast development at low temperatures.	 Although the phenotype and temperature dependence of the TCD5 orthologous mutant phenotype were different in rice and Arabidopsis, OsTCD5 could rescue the phenotype of the Arabidopsis mutant, suggesting that TCD5 function is conserved between monocots and dicots
TCD5|CSV1	leaf development	Temperature-sensitive albino gene TCD5, encoding a monooxygenase, affects chloroplast development at low temperatures.	 The development of chloroplasts and etioplasts is impaired in tcd5 plants at 20 째C, and the temperature-sensitive period for the albino phenotype is the P4 stage of leaf development
TCD5|CSV1	development	Temperature-sensitive albino gene TCD5, encoding a monooxygenase, affects chloroplast development at low temperatures.	 The development of chloroplasts and etioplasts is impaired in tcd5 plants at 20 째C, and the temperature-sensitive period for the albino phenotype is the P4 stage of leaf development
TCD5|CSV1	development	Temperature-sensitive albino gene TCD5, encoding a monooxygenase, affects chloroplast development at low temperatures.	 The development of thylakoid membranes is arrested at the mid-P4 stage in tcd5 plants at 20 째C
TCD5|CSV1	photosynthesis	Temperature-sensitive albino gene TCD5, encoding a monooxygenase, affects chloroplast development at low temperatures.	 The transcription of some genes involved in plastid transcription/translation and photosynthesis varied in the tcd5 mutant
