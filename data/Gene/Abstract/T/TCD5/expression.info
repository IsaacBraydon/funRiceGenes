Symbol	Expression
TCD5	 TCD5 is abundantly expressed in young leaves and immature spikes, and low temperatures increased this expression
TCD5|CSV1|TSV	 The activity of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) and the expression of genes participating in chlorophyll synthesis were severely reduced in the tsv mutant under cold stress, but not at normal temperatures |  TSV expression was induced by low temperatures
