NA	RiceTCM1Encoding a Component of the TAC Complex is Required for Chloroplast Development under Cold Stress.	2018	Plant Genome	Fail	Transcriptionally active chromosome (TAC) is a component of protein-DNA complexes with RNA polymerase activity, expressed in the plastid. However, the function of rice TAC proteins is still poorly understood. In this paper, we first report the identification of a new rice ( L.) mutant () in the gene encoding TAC. The mutant displayed an albino phenotype and malformed chloroplasts before the three-leaf stage when grown at low temperatures (20°„C) and a normal phenotype at higher temperatures (&gt;28°„C). Map-based cloning revealed that encodes a novel chloroplast-targeted TAC protein in rice. In addition, the transcript levels of all examined plastid-encoded polymerase (PEP)-dependent genes were clearly downregulated in mutants at low temperatures, although partially recovering levels were obtained at high temperatures, comparable to wild-type plants. Furthermore, the transcripts were ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues, with high expression levels in green tissues. The data suggest that the rice nuclear-encoded TAC protein TCM1 is essential for proper chloroplast development and maintaining PEP activity under cold stress.
