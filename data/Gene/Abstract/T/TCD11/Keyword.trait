TCD11	leaf	The rice TCD11 encoding plastid ribosomal protein S6 is essential for chloroplast development at low temperature	 The alteration of leaf color in tcd11 mutants was aligned with chlorophyll (Chl) content and chloroplast development
TCD11	temperature	The rice TCD11 encoding plastid ribosomal protein S6 is essential for chloroplast development at low temperature	The rice TCD11 encoding plastid ribosomal protein S6 is essential for chloroplast development at low temperature
TCD11	temperature	The rice TCD11 encoding plastid ribosomal protein S6 is essential for chloroplast development at low temperature	 In addition, the disruption of TCD11 greatly reduced the transcript levels of certain chloroplasts-associated genes and prevented the assembly of ribosome in chloroplasts at low temperature (20 °C), whereas they recovered to nearly normal levels at high temperature (32 °C)
