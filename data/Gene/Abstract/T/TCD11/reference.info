NA	The rice TCD11 encoding plastid ribosomal protein S6 is essential for chloroplast development at low temperature	2017	Plant Science	Development Center of Plant Germplasm Resources, College of Life and Environment Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China	Plastid ribosome proteins (PRPs) are important components for chloroplast biogenesis and early chloroplast development. Although it has been known that chloroplast ribosomes are similar to bacterial ones, the precise molecular function of ribosomal proteins remains to be elucidated in rice. Here, we identified a novel rice mutant, designated tcd11 (thermo-sensitive chlorophyll-deficient mutant 11), characterized by the albino phenotype until it died at 20 °„C, while displaying normal phenotype at 32 °„C. The alteration of leaf color in tcd11 mutants was aligned with chlorophyll (Chl) content and chloroplast development. The map-based cloning and molecular complementation showed that TCD11 encodes the ribosomal small subunit protein S6 in chloroplasts (RPS6). TCD11 was abundantly expressed in leaves, suggesting its different expressions in tissues. In addition, the disruption of TCD11 greatly reduced the transcript levels of certain chloroplasts-associated genes and prevented the assembly of ribosome in chloroplasts at low temperature (20 °„C), whereas they recovered to nearly normal levels at high temperature (32 °„C). Thus, our data indicate that TCD11 plays an important role in chloroplast development at low temperature. Upon our knowledge, the observations from this study provide a first glimpse into the importance of RPS6 function in rice chloroplast development.
