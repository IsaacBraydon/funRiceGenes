TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	cytokinin	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants	The expression of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was differentially regulated by the plant hormones, auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid
TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	auxin	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants	The expression of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was differentially regulated by the plant hormones, auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid
TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	flower	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants	The transcript abundance of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was also higher in prepollinated flowers and callus
TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	pollen	Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis	 Similar to Osspo11-1, the pollen mother cells of Osspo11-2 T1 progeny plants, showed an absence of bivalent formation at metaphase I, aberrant segregation of homologous chromosomes and formation of nonviable tetrads
TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	panicle	Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis	 Similar to Osspo11-1, biallelic mutations in OsSPO11-2 first exon led to complete panicle sterility, and consequently, none of these primary transformants produced seeds
TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	meiosis	Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis	Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis
TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	meiosis	Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis	 Altogether, this study demonstrates that whereas OsSPO11-1 and OsSPO11-2 are the likely orthologs of Arabidopsis AtSPO11-1 and AtSPO11-2, the additional OsSPO11-4 gene has no major role in wild-type rice meiosis
TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	sterile	Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis	 As expected, we observed very few DMC1 foci (19 on average) in the sterile Osspso11-1 mutant but surprisingly 85 foci in the sterile Osspo11-2 mutant, indicative of a divergent function between these two SPO11 genes in rice
