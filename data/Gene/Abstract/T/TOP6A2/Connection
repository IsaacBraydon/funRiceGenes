OsTOP6B	TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants	The transcript abundance of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was also higher in prepollinated flowers and callus
OsTOP6B	TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants	The expression of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was differentially regulated by the plant hormones, auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid
OsTOP6B	TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants	Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the full-length OsTOP6B protein interacts with both OsTOP6A2 and OsTOP6A3, but not with OsTOP6A1

DMC1A|DMC1	TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis	 As expected, we observed very few DMC1 foci (19 on average) in the sterile Osspso11-1 mutant but surprisingly 85 foci in the sterile Osspo11-2 mutant, indicative of a divergent function between these two SPO11 genes in rice
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis	 To clarify the roles of these SPO11 paralogs, we used CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to induce null mutants in OsSPO11-1, OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis	 Similar to Osspo11-1, biallelic mutations in OsSPO11-2 first exon led to complete panicle sterility, and consequently, none of these primary transformants produced seeds
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis	 Similar to Osspo11-1, the pollen mother cells of Osspo11-2 T1 progeny plants, showed an absence of bivalent formation at metaphase I, aberrant segregation of homologous chromosomes and formation of nonviable tetrads
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis	 Altogether, this study demonstrates that whereas OsSPO11-1 and OsSPO11-2 are the likely orthologs of Arabidopsis AtSPO11-1 and AtSPO11-2, the additional OsSPO11-4 gene has no major role in wild-type rice meiosis
OsSpo11-4|OsSPO11D	TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis	Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis
