OsTOP6B	TOP6A2	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants	 The transcript abundance of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was also higher in prepollinated flowers and callus| The expression of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was differentially regulated by the plant hormones, auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid| Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the full-length OsTOP6B protein interacts with both OsTOP6A2 and OsTOP6A3, but not with OsTOP6A1
OsTOP6A3	TOP6A2	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants	 The transcript abundance of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was also higher in prepollinated flowers and callus| The expression of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was differentially regulated by the plant hormones, auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid| Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the full-length OsTOP6B protein interacts with both OsTOP6A2 and OsTOP6A3, but not with OsTOP6A1
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	TOP6A2	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants	 Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the full-length OsTOP6B protein interacts with both OsTOP6A2 and OsTOP6A3, but not with OsTOP6A1
