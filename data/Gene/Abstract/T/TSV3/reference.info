NA	Rice TSV3 Encoding Obg-Like GTPase Protein Is Essential for Chloroplast Development During the Early Leaf Stage Under Cold Stress.	2017	G3 (Bethesda)	Shanghai Normal University.	The Spo0B-associated GTP-binding (Obg) proteins are essential for the viability of nearly all bacteria. However, detailed roles of Obg proteins in higher plants have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we identified a novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) thermo-sensitive virescent mutant, tsv3 that displayed albino phenotype at 20°„C before the 3-leaf stage while being normal green at 32°„C or even at 20°„C after the 4-leaf stage. The mutant phenotype was consistent with altered chlorophyll content and chloroplast structure in leaves. Map-based cloning and complementation experiments showed that TSV3 encoded a small GTP-binding protein. Subcellular localization studies revealed that TSV3 was localized to the chloroplasts. Expression of TSV3 was high in leaves and weak or undetectable in other tissues, suggesting a tissue-specific expression of TSV3 In the tsv3 mutant, expression levels of genes associated with the biogenesis of the chloroplast ribosome 50S subunit were severely decreased at the 3-leaf-stage under cold stress (20°„C), but could be recovered to normal levels at a higher temperature (32°„C). These observations suggest that the rice nuclear-encoded TSV3 plays important roles in chloroplast development at early leaf stage under cold stress.
