Symbol	Expression
TSV3	 Expression of TSV3 was high in leaves and weak or undetectable in other tissues, suggesting a tissue-specific expression of TSV3 In the tsv3 mutant, expression levels of genes associated with the biogenesis of the chloroplast ribosome 50S subunit were severely decreased at the 3-leaf-stage under cold stress (20°„C), but could be recovered to normal levels at a higher temperature (32°„C)
