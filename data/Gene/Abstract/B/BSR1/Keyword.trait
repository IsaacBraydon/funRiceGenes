BSR1	resistance	Tyrosine phosphorylation of a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, BSR1, plays a crucial role in resistance to multiple pathogens in rice.	 Importantly, tyrosine phosphorylation of BSR1 was critical for proper localization of BSR1 in rice cells and played a crucial role in BSR1-mediated resistance to multiple diseases, as evidenced by compromised disease resistance in transgenic plants overexpressing a mutant BSR1 in which Tyr-63 was substituted with Ala
BSR1	resistance	Tyrosine phosphorylation of a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, BSR1, plays a crucial role in resistance to multiple pathogens in rice.	 Overall, our data indicate that BSR1 is a nonreceptor dual-specificity kinase and that both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase activities are critical for the normal functioning of BSR1 in the resistance to multiple pathogens
BSR1	disease	Tyrosine phosphorylation of a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, BSR1, plays a crucial role in resistance to multiple pathogens in rice.

BSR1	Kinase	Tyrosine phosphorylation of a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, BSR1, plays a crucial role in resistance to multiple pathogens in rice.	 In the present study, we report that BSR1 is a functional protein kinase that autophosphorylates and transphosphorylates an artificial substrate, in vitro
BSR1	Kinase	Tyrosine phosphorylation of a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, BSR1, plays a crucial role in resistance to multiple pathogens in rice.	 Although BSR1 is classified as a serine/threonine kinase, it was shown to autophosphorylate on tyrosine as well as on serine/threonine residues when expressed in bacteria, demonstrating that it is a dual-specificity kinase
