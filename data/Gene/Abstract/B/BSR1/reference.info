Approximately 20,000 of the rice-FOX Arabidopsis transgenic lines, which overexpress 13,000 rice full-length cDNAs at random in Arabidopsis, were screened for bacterial disease resistance by dip inoculation with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000). The identities of the overexpressed genes were determined in 72 lines that showed consistent resistance after three independent screens. Pst DC3000 resistance was verified for 19 genes by characterizing other independent Arabidopsis lines for the same genes in the original rice-FOX hunting population or obtained by reintroducing the genes into ecotype Columbia by floral dip transformation. Thirteen lines of these 72 selections were also resistant to the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum. Eight genes that conferred resistance to Pst DC3000 in Arabidopsis have been introduced into rice for overexpression, and transformants were evaluated for resistance to the rice bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. One of the transgenic rice lines was highly resistant to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Interestingly, this line also showed remarkably high resistance to Magnaporthe grisea, the fungal pathogen causing rice blast, which is the most devastating rice disease in many countries. The causal rice gene, encoding a putative receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, was therefore designated as BROAD-SPECTRUM RESISTANCE 1. Our results demonstrate the utility of the rice-FOX Arabidopsis lines as a tool for the identification of genes involved in plant defence and suggest the presence of a defence mechanism common between monocots and dicots.
NA	Tyrosine phosphorylation of a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, BSR1, plays a crucial role in resistance to multiple pathogens in rice.	2018	Plant J	Plant Function Research Unit, Division of Plant and Microbial Sciences, Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602, Japan.	Plants have evolved many receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) to modulate their growth, development, and innate immunity. Broad-Spectrum Resistance 1 (BSR1) encodes a rice RLCK whose overexpression confers resistance to multiple diseases, including fungal rice blast and bacterial leaf blight; however, the mechanisms underlying the resistance remain largely unknown. In the present study, we report that BSR1 is a functional protein kinase that autophosphorylates and transphosphorylates an artificial substrate, in vitro. Although BSR1 is classified as a serine/threonine kinase, it was shown to autophosphorylate on tyrosine as well as on serine/threonine residues when expressed in bacteria, demonstrating that it is a dual-specificity kinase. Protein kinase activity was found to be indispensable for resistance to rice blast and leaf blight in BSR1-overexpressing plants. Importantly, tyrosine phosphorylation of BSR1 was critical for proper localization of BSR1 in rice cells and played a crucial role in BSR1-mediated resistance to multiple diseases, as evidenced by compromised disease resistance in transgenic plants overexpressing a mutant BSR1 in which Tyr-63 was substituted with Ala. Overall, our data indicate that BSR1 is a nonreceptor dual-specificity kinase and that both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase activities are critical for the normal functioning of BSR1 in the resistance to multiple pathogens. Our results support the notion that tyrosine phosphorylation plays a major regulatory role in the transduction of defense signals from cell-surface receptor complexes to downstream signaling components in plants.

NA	Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance Conferred by the Overexpression of Rice RLCK BSR1 Results from an Enhanced Immune Response to Multiple MAMPs.	2019	Int J Mol Sci	Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, NARO (NIAS), Tsukuba 305-8602, Japan.	Plants activate their immune system through intracellular signaling pathways after perceiving microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases mediate the intracellular signaling downstream of pattern-recognition receptors. BROAD-SPECTRUM RESISTANCE 1 (BSR1), a rice (Oryza sativa) receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase subfamily-VII protein, contributes to chitin-triggered immune responses. It is valuable for agriculture because its overexpression confers strong disease resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens. However, it remains unclear how overexpressed BSR1 reinforces plant immunity. Here we analyzed immune responses using rice suspension-cultured cells and sliced leaf blades overexpressing BSR1. BSR1 overexpression enhances MAMP-triggered production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and transcriptional activation of the defense-related gene in cultured cells and leaf strips. Furthermore, the co-cultivation of leaves with conidia of the blast fungus revealed that BSR1 overexpression allowed host plants to produce detectable oxidative bursts against compatible pathogens. BSR1 was also involved in the immune responses triggered by peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide. Thus, we concluded that the hyperactivation of MAMP-triggered immune responses confers BSR1-mediated robust resistance to broad-spectrum pathogens.
NA	Overexpressed BSR1-Mediated Enhancement of Disease Resistance Depends on the MAMP-Recognition System	2020	Int J Mol Sci	Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, NARO (NIAS), Tsukuba 305-8602, Japan.	Plant plasma membrane-localized receptors recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and activate immune responses via various signaling pathways. Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) are considered key signaling factors in plant immunity. BROAD-SPECTRUM RESISTANCE 1 (BSR1), a rice RLCK, plays a significant role in disease resistance. Overexpression of BSR1 confers strong resistance against fungal and bacterial pathogens. Our recent study revealed that MAMP-triggered immune responses are mediated by BSR1 in wild-type rice and are hyperactivated in BSR1-overexpressing rice. It was suggested that hyperactivated immune responses were responsible for the enhancement of broad-spectrum disease resistance; however, this remained to be experimentally validated. In this study, we verified the above hypothesis by disrupting the MAMP-recognition system in BSR1-overexpressing rice. To this end, we knocked out OsCERK1, which encodes a well-characterized MAMP-receptor-like protein kinase. In the background of BSR1 overaccumulation, the knockout of OsCERK1 nearly abolished the enhancement of blast resistance. This finding indicates that overexpressed BSR1-mediated enhancement of disease resistance depends on the MAMP-triggered immune system, corroborating our previously suggested model.
