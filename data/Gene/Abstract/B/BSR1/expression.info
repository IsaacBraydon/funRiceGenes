BSR1	 Broad-Spectrum Resistance 1 (BSR1) encodes a rice RLCK whose overexpression confers resistance to multiple diseases, including fungal rice blast and bacterial leaf blight; however, the mechanisms underlying the resistance remain largely unknown	 Broad-Spectrum Resistance 1 (BSR1) encodes a rice RLCK whose overexpression confers resistance to multiple diseases, including fungal rice blast and bacterial leaf blight; however, the mechanisms underlying the resistance remain largely unknown
BSR1	Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance Conferred by the Overexpression of Rice RLCK BSR1 Results from an Enhanced Immune Response to Multiple MAMPs. |  BSR1 overexpression enhances MAMP-triggered production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and transcriptional activation of the defense-related gene in cultured cells and leaf strips |  Furthermore, the co-cultivation of leaves with conidia of the blast fungus revealed that BSR1 overexpression allowed host plants to produce detectable oxidative bursts against compatible pathogens	Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance Conferred by the Overexpression of Rice RLCK BSR1 Results from an Enhanced Immune Response to Multiple MAMPs. |  BSR1 overexpression enhances MAMP-triggered production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and transcriptional activation of the defense-related gene in cultured cells and leaf strips |  Furthermore, the co-cultivation of leaves with conidia of the blast fungus revealed that BSR1 overexpression allowed host plants to produce detectable oxidative bursts against compatible pathogens
