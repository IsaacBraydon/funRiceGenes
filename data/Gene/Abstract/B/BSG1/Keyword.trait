BLS1|BSG1	inflorescence	BEAK LIKE SPIKELET1 is Required for Lateral Development of Lemma and Palea in Rice	 BLS1 is expressed strongly in young inflorescence, specifically the young lemmas and paleas of spikelets
BLS1|BSG1	architecture	BEAK LIKE SPIKELET1 is Required for Lateral Development of Lemma and Palea in Rice	 In bls1 mutant, floral-organ identity and floral-organ patterning are normal, and the defects occur at the stage of the lemma and palea expansion, whereas the other aspects of floral architecture and form are not affected
BLS1|BSG1	lemma	Beak-shaped grain 1/TRIANGULAR HULL 1, a DUF640 gene, is associated with grain shape, size and weight in rice	 Here, we isolated a rice mutant, beak-shaped grain1 (bsg1), which produced beak-shaped grains of decreased width, thickness and weight with a loosely interlocked lemma and palea that were unable to close tightly| Consistent with the lemma and palea shapes, the outer parenchyma cell layers of these bsg1 tissues developed fewer cells with decreased size
BLS1|BSG1	cell division	Beak-shaped grain 1/TRIANGULAR HULL 1, a DUF640 gene, is associated with grain shape, size and weight in rice	 Our results suggest that BSG1 determines grain shape and size probably by modifying cell division and expansion in the grain hull
BLS1|BSG1	grain size	Beak-shaped grain 1/TRIANGULAR HULL 1, a DUF640 gene, is associated with grain shape, size and weight in rice	 The BSG1 mutation affected the expression of genes potentially involved in the cell cycle and GW2, an important regulator of grain size in rice
