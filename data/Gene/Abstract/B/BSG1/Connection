BLS1|BSG1|OsG1L6|TH1|AFD1	GW2	Beak-shaped grain 1/TRIANGULAR HULL 1, a DUF640 gene, is associated with grain shape, size and weight in rice	The BSG1 mutation affected the expression of genes potentially involved in the cell cycle and GW2, an important regulator of grain size in rice
BLS1|BSG1|OsG1L6|TH1|AFD1	EG1	A role for TRIANGULAR HULL1 in fine-tuning spikelet morphogenesis in rice.	We then examined the effect of th1 mutation on the lemma-like structure formed in the long sterile lemma/glume1 (g1) and extra glume1 (eg1) mutants
BLS1|BSG1|OsG1L6|TH1|AFD1	EG1	A role for TRIANGULAR HULL1 in fine-tuning spikelet morphogenesis in rice.	The result showed that the th1 mutation strongly affected the morphology of the extra lemma of eg1, but had no significant effect on the transformed lemma of g1
