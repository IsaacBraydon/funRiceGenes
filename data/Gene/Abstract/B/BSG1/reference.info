However, the mechanism underlying specification of their morphology remains unclear. In this study, we characterized a rice mutant, beak like spikelet1 (bls1), which specifically affects development of the lemma and palea. In bls1 mutant, floral-organ identity and floral-organ patterning are normal, and the defects occur at the stage of the lemma and palea expansion, whereas the other aspects of floral architecture and form are not affected. We isolated BLS1 by positional cloning and found that it encodes a protein with a conserved domain of unknown function. BLS1 is expressed strongly in young inflorescence, specifically the young lemmas and paleas of spikelets. Subcellular localization analysis showed that BLS1 is localized in the nucleus. Expression of the AP1-like and SEP-like floral homeotic genes were not changed in the bls1 mutant. Our study suggested that BLS1 is required for lateral development of the lemma and palea and does not function at stages of floral-organ initiation and patterning.
10.1007-s11427-013-4449-5.pdf	Beak-shaped grain 1/TRIANGULAR HULL 1, a DUF640 gene, is associated with grain shape, size and weight in rice	2013	Sci China Life Sci	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China.	Grain shape and size both determine grain weight and therefore crop yield. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling grain shape and size are still largely unknown. Here, we isolated a rice mutant, beak-shaped grain1 (bsg1), which produced beak-shaped grains of decreased width, thickness and weight with a loosely interlocked lemma and palea that were unable to close tightly. Starch granules were also irregularly packaged in the bsg1 grains. Consistent with the lemma and palea shapes, the outer parenchyma cell layers of these bsg1 tissues developed fewer cells with decreased size. Map-based cloning revealed that BSG1 encoded a DUF640 domain protein, TRIANGULAR HULL 1, of unknown function. Quantitative PCR and GUS fusion reporter assays showed that BSG1 was expressed mainly in the young panicle and elongating stem. The BSG1 mutation affected the expression of genes potentially involved in the cell cycle and GW2, an important regulator of grain size in rice. Our results suggest that BSG1 determines grain shape and size probably by modifying cell division and expansion in the grain hull.
NA	A role for TRIANGULAR HULL1 in fine-tuning spikelet morphogenesis in rice.	2014	Genes Genet Syst	Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, The University of Tokyo.	The lemma and palea, which enclose the pistil, stamens, and lodicules, are the most conspicuous organs in the rice spikelet. We isolated a mutant line (ng6569) in which the lemma and palea were narrower than those of the wild type, and found that the mutant had a defect in TRIANGULAR HULL1 (TH1), which encodes a nuclear protein with an ALOG domain. Detailed morphological analysis indicated that the th1 mutation caused a reduction in the size of tubercles, which are convex structures on the surface of the lemma and palea. This reduction was more pronounced in the apical region of the lemma than in the basal region, resulting in the formation of a beak-like spikelet. By contrast, the number of tubercle rows and their spatial distribution on the lemma were not affected in the th1 mutant. Thus, the TH1 gene seems to be involved in fine-tuning the morphogenesis of the lemma and palea. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that TH1 was highly expressed in the primordia of the lemma and palea, but only weakly expressed in the primordia of the sterile lemma and rudimentary glume. We then examined the effect of th1 mutation on the lemma-like structure formed in the long sterile lemma/glume1 (g1) and extra glume1 (eg1) mutants. The result showed that the th1 mutation strongly affected the morphology of the extra lemma of eg1, but had no significant effect on the transformed lemma of g1.
NA	The pleiotropic ABNORMAL FLOWER AND DWARF1 affects plant height, floral development and grain yield in rice.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Lab for Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, China.	Moderate plant height and successful establishment of reproductive organs play pivotal roles in rice grain production. The molecular mechanism that controls the two aspects remains unclear in rice. In the study, we characterized a rice gene, ABNORMAL FLOWER AND DWARF1 (AFD1) that determined plant height, floral development and grain yield. The afd1 mutant showed variable defects including the dwarfism, long panicle, low seed setting and reduced grain yield. In addition, abnormal floral organs were also observed in the afd1 mutant including slender and thick hulls, and hull-like lodicules. AFD1 encoded a DUF640 domain protein and was expressed in all tested tissues and organs. Subcellular localization showed AFD1-green fluorescent fusion protein (GFP) was localized in the nucleus. Meantime, our results suggested that AFD1 regulated the expression of cell division and expansion related genes.
NA	The rice TRIANGULAR HULL1 protein acts as a transcriptional repressor in regulating lateral development of spikelet.	2017	Sci Rep	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, China.	As a basic unit of rice inflorescence, spikelet has profound influence on grain size, weight and yield. The molecular mechanism underlying spikelet development has not been fully elucidated. Here, we identified four allelic rice mutants, s2-89, xd151, xd281 and xd425, which exhibited reduced width of spikelet, especially in the apical region. Map-based cloning revealed that all these mutants had missense mutation in the TRIANGULAR HULL1 (TH1) gene, encoding an ALOG family protein. TH1 has been shown to regulate the lateral development of spikelet, but its mode of action remains unclear. Microscopic analysis revealed that the reduction in spikelet width was caused by decreased cell size rather than cell division. The TH1 protein was shown to localize in the nucleus and possess transcriptional repression activity. TH1 could form a homodimer and point mutation in the s2-89, xd281 and xd425 mutant inhibited homodimerization. The transcriptional repression activity of TH1 was partially relieved by the His129Tyr substitution in the s2-89 mutant. Fusion of an exogenous EAR transcription suppression domain to the mutant protein TH1(s2-89) could largely complemented the narrow spikelet phenotype. These results indicate that TH1 functions as a transcription repressor and regulates cell expansion during the lateral development of spikelet.
