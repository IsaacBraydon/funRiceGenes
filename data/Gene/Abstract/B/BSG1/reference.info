However, the mechanism underlying specification of their morphology remains unclear. In this study, we characterized a rice mutant, beak like spikelet1 (bls1), which specifically affects development of the lemma and palea. In bls1 mutant, floral-organ identity and floral-organ patterning are normal, and the defects occur at the stage of the lemma and palea expansion, whereas the other aspects of floral architecture and form are not affected. We isolated BLS1 by positional cloning and found that it encodes a protein with a conserved domain of unknown function. BLS1 is expressed strongly in young inflorescence, specifically the young lemmas and paleas of spikelets. Subcellular localization analysis showed that BLS1 is localized in the nucleus. Expression of the AP1-like and SEP-like floral homeotic genes were not changed in the bls1 mutant. Our study suggested that BLS1 is required for lateral development of the lemma and palea and does not function at stages of floral-organ initiation and patterning.

Grain shape and size both determine grain weight and therefore crop yield. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling grain shape and size are still largely unknown. Here, we isolated a rice mutant, beak-shaped grain1 (bsg1), which produced beak-shaped grains of decreased width, thickness and weight with a loosely interlocked lemma and palea that were unable to close tightly. Starch granules were also irregularly packaged in the bsg1 grains. Consistent with the lemma and palea shapes, the outer parenchyma cell layers of these bsg1 tissues developed fewer cells with decreased size. Map-based cloning revealed that BSG1 encoded a DUF640 domain protein, TRIANGULAR HULL 1, of unknown function. Quantitative PCR and GUS fusion reporter assays showed that BSG1 was expressed mainly in the young panicle and elongating stem. The BSG1 mutation affected the expression of genes potentially involved in the cell cycle and GW2, an important regulator of grain size in rice. Our results suggest that BSG1 determines grain shape and size probably by modifying cell division and expansion in the grain hull.
