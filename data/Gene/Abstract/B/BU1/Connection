BU1	D11|CPB1|CYP724B1|GNS4	H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice	Consistently, transcriptome analyses revealed that SDG725 depletion results in down-regulation by more than two-fold of over 1000 genes, including D11, BRI1 and BU1, which are known to be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis or signaling pathways
BU1	D61|OsBRI1	H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice	Consistently, transcriptome analyses revealed that SDG725 depletion results in down-regulation by more than two-fold of over 1000 genes, including D11, BRI1 and BU1, which are known to be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis or signaling pathways

BU1	D1|RGA1	BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1, encoding a helix-loop-helix protein, is a novel gene involved in brassinosteroid signaling and controls bending of the lamina joint in rice	In addition, compared to the wild type, the induction of BU1 by exogenous brassinolide did not require de novo protein synthesis and it was weaker in a BR receptor mutant OsbriI (Oryza sativa brassinosteroid insensitive1, d61) and a rice G protein alpha subunit (RGA1) mutant d1
BU1	D1|RGA1	BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1, encoding a helix-loop-helix protein, is a novel gene involved in brassinosteroid signaling and controls bending of the lamina joint in rice	These results indicate that BU1 protein is a positive regulator of BR response: it controls bending of the lamina joint in rice and it is a novel primary response gene that participates in two BR signaling pathways through OsBRI1 and RGA1

BU1	MRG702	MRG702, a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, is involved in brassinosteroid-regulated growth and flowering time control in rice.	Gene transcription analyses showed that MRG702 knock-down resulted in the down-regulation of BR-related genes, including D11, BRI1, and BU1, and several flowering genes including Ehd1, Ehd2/OsID1/RID1, Ehd3,OsMADS50, Hd3a, and RFT1
