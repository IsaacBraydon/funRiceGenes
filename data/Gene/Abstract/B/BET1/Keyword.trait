BET1	tolerance	Suppression of a NAC-like transcription factor gene improves boron-toxicity tolerance in rice.	Suppression of a NAC-like transcription factor gene improves boron-toxicity tolerance in rice.
BET1	boron-toxicity tolerance	Suppression of a NAC-like transcription factor gene improves boron-toxicity tolerance in rice.	Suppression of a NAC-like transcription factor gene improves boron-toxicity tolerance in rice.
BET1	boron-toxicity tolerance	Suppression of a NAC-like transcription factor gene improves boron-toxicity tolerance in rice.	In this report, we attempted to clone BET1 using the map-based cloning method, and identified it as a NAC-like transcription factor gene that has not been previously reported to be an excess B-tolerance-related gene.
