The receptor-like kinase SIT1 acts as a sensor in rice (Oryza sativa) roots, relaying salt stress signals via elevated kinase activity to enhance salt sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate that Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulatory subunit B&#39;κ constrains SIT1 activity under salt stress. B&#39;κ-PP2A deactivates SIT1 directly by dephosphorylating the kinase at Thr515/516, a salt-induced phosphorylation site in the activation loop that is essential for SIT1 activity. B&#39;κ overexpression suppresses the salt sensitivity of rice plants expressing high levels of SIT1, thereby contributing to salt tolerance. B&#39;κ functions in a SIT1 kinase-dependent manner. During early salt stress, activated SIT1 phosphorylates B&#39;κ; this not only enhances its binding with SIT1, it also promotes B&#39;κ protein accumulation via Ser502 phosphorylation. Consequently, by blocking SIT1 phosphorylation, B&#39;κ inhibits and fine-tunes SIT1 activity to balance plant growth and stress adaptation.
