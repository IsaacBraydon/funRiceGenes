NA	Allelic diversity in an NLR gene BPH9 enables rice to combat planthopper variation.	2016	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	National Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China.	Brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens St<U+00E5>l, is one of the most devastating insect pests of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Currently, 30 BPH-resistance genes have been genetically defined, most of which are clustered on specific chromosome regions. Here, we describe molecular cloning and characterization of a BPH-resistance gene, BPH9, mapped on the long arm of rice chromosome 12 (12L). BPH9 encodes a rare type of nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-containing protein that localizes to the endomembrane system and causes a cell death phenotype. BPH9 activates salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-signaling pathways in rice plants and confers both antixenosis and antibiosis to BPH. We further demonstrated that the eight BPH-resistance genes that are clustered on chromosome 12L, including the widely used BPH1, are allelic with each other. To honor the priority in the literature, we thus designated this locus as BPH1/9 These eight genes can be classified into four allelotypes, BPH1/9-1, -2, -7, and -9 These allelotypes confer varying levels of resistance to different biotypes of BPH. The coding region of BPH1/9 shows a high level of diversity in rice germplasm. Homologous fragments of the nucleotide-binding (NB) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains exist, which might have served as a repository for generating allele diversity. Our findings reveal a rice plant strategy for modifying the genetic information to gain the upper hand in the struggle against insect herbivores. Further exploration of natural allelic variation and artificial shuffling within this gene may allow breeding to be tailored to control emerging biotypes of BPH.
NA	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.	2017	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.	The brown planthopper (BPH) has become the most destructive and a serious threat to the rice production in Asia. Breeding the resistant varieties with improved host resistance is the most effective and ecosystem-friendly strategy of BPH biological management. As host resistance was always broken down by the presence of the upgrading BPH biotype, the more resistant varieties with novel resistance genes or pyramiding known identified BPH resistance genes would be needed urgently for higher resistant level and more durability of resistance.Here, we developed near isogenic lines of Bph9 (NIL-Bph9) by backcrossing elite cultivar 93-11 with Pokkali (harboring Bph9) using marker-assisted selection (MAS). Subsequently, we pyramided Bph6 and Bph9 in 93-11 genetic background through MAS. The resulting Bph6 and Bph9 pyramided line LuoYang69 had stronger antixenotic and antibiosis effects on BPH and exhibited significantly enhanced resistance to BPH than near isogenic lines NIL-Bph6 and NIL-Bph9. LuoYang69 derived hybrids, harboring heterozygous Bph6 and Bph9 genes, also conferred high level of resistance to BPH. Furthermore, LuoYang69 did not affect the elite agronomic traits and rice grain quality of 93-11. The current study also developed functional markers for Bph9. Using functional dominant marker, we screened and evaluated worldwide accessions of rice germplasm. Of the 673 varieties tested, 8 cultivars were identified to harbor functional Bph9 gene.The development of Bph6 and Bph9 pyramided line LuoYang69 provides valuable resource to develop hybrid rice with highly and durable BPH resistance. The development of functional markers will promote MAS of Bph9. The identified Bph9 containing cultivars can be used as new sources for BPH resistance breeding programs.
