BPH9	salicylic acid	Allelic diversity in an NLR gene BPH9 enables rice to combat planthopper variation.	BPH9 activates salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-signaling pathways in rice plants and confers both antixenosis and antibiosis to BPH
BPH9	cell death	Allelic diversity in an NLR gene BPH9 enables rice to combat planthopper variation.	BPH9 encodes a rare type of nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-containing protein that localizes to the endomembrane system and causes a cell death phenotype
BPH9	jasmonic	Allelic diversity in an NLR gene BPH9 enables rice to combat planthopper variation.	BPH9 activates salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-signaling pathways in rice plants and confers both antixenosis and antibiosis to BPH
BPH9	jasmonic acid	Allelic diversity in an NLR gene BPH9 enables rice to combat planthopper variation.	BPH9 activates salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-signaling pathways in rice plants and confers both antixenosis and antibiosis to BPH
BPH9	resistance	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.	 The resulting Bph6 and Bph9 pyramided line LuoYang69 had stronger antixenotic and antibiosis effects on BPH and exhibited significantly enhanced resistance to BPH than near isogenic lines NIL-Bph6 and NIL-Bph9
BPH9	resistance	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.	 LuoYang69 derived hybrids, harboring heterozygous Bph6 and Bph9 genes, also conferred high level of resistance to BPH
BPH9	resistance	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.	The development of Bph6 and Bph9 pyramided line LuoYang69 provides valuable resource to develop hybrid rice with highly and durable BPH resistance
BPH9	resistance	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.	 The identified Bph9 containing cultivars can be used as new sources for BPH resistance breeding programs
BPH9	development	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.
BPH9	development	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.	The development of Bph6 and Bph9 pyramided line LuoYang69 provides valuable resource to develop hybrid rice with highly and durable BPH resistance
BPH9	development	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.	 The development of functional markers will promote MAS of Bph9
BPH9	breeding	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.	 The identified Bph9 containing cultivars can be used as new sources for BPH resistance breeding programs
