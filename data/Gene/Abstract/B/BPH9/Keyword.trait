BPH9	salicylic acid	Allelic diversity in an NLR gene BPH9 enables rice to combat planthopper variation.	BPH9 activates salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-signaling pathways in rice plants and confers both antixenosis and antibiosis to BPH
BPH9	cell death	Allelic diversity in an NLR gene BPH9 enables rice to combat planthopper variation.	BPH9 encodes a rare type of nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-containing protein that localizes to the endomembrane system and causes a cell death phenotype
BPH9	jasmonic	Allelic diversity in an NLR gene BPH9 enables rice to combat planthopper variation.	BPH9 activates salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-signaling pathways in rice plants and confers both antixenosis and antibiosis to BPH
BPH9	jasmonic acid	Allelic diversity in an NLR gene BPH9 enables rice to combat planthopper variation.	BPH9 activates salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-signaling pathways in rice plants and confers both antixenosis and antibiosis to BPH
