BPH9	MAS|OsMAS	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.	Here, we developed near isogenic lines of Bph9 (NIL-Bph9) by backcrossing elite cultivar 93-11 with Pokkali (harboring Bph9) using marker-assisted selection (MAS)
BPH9	MAS|OsMAS	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.	 Subsequently, we pyramided Bph6 and Bph9 in 93-11 genetic background through MAS
BPH9	MAS|OsMAS	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.	 The development of functional markers will promote MAS of Bph9
