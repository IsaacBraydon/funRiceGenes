BC10	cellulose	BC10, a DUF266-containing and Golgi-located type II membrane protein, is required for cell-wall biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Monosaccharide analysis of total and fractioned wall residues revealed that bc10 showed impaired cellulose biosynthesis
BC10	cellulose	BC10, a DUF266-containing and Golgi-located type II membrane protein, is required for cell-wall biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 BC10 is mainly expressed in the developing sclerenchyma and vascular bundle cells, and its deficiency causes a reduction in the levels of cellulose and AGPs, leading to inferior mechanical properties
BC10	vascular bundle	BC10, a DUF266-containing and Golgi-located type II membrane protein, is required for cell-wall biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 BC10 is mainly expressed in the developing sclerenchyma and vascular bundle cells, and its deficiency causes a reduction in the levels of cellulose and AGPs, leading to inferior mechanical properties
BC10	culm	BC10, a DUF266-containing and Golgi-located type II membrane protein, is required for cell-wall biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 We report here the isolation and in-depth characterization of a brittle rice mutant, brittle culm 10 (bc10)
BC10	growth	BC10, a DUF266-containing and Golgi-located type II membrane protein, is required for cell-wall biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 bc10 plants show pleiotropic phenotypes, including brittleness of the plant body and retarded growth
