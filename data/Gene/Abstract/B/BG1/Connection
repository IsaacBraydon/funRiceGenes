BG1	OsMADS34|PAP2	Regulatory Role of OsMADS34 in the Determination of Glumes Fate, Grain Yield, and Quality in Rice.	Interesting, transcriptional activity analysis revealed that OsMADS34 protein was a transcription repressor and it may influence grain yield by suppressing the expressions of BG1, GW8, GW2, and GL7 in the m34-z mutant
BG1	sh4|SHA1|SG5	Short grain 5 controls grain length in rice by regulating cell expansion.	 Moreover, the expression levels of BG1, GS2, and DEP1 were reduced in sg5 plants, and dual-luciferase (LUC) assays showed that SG5 can bind to the BG1 gene promoter
