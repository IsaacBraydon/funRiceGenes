BG1	grain	Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.	 Overexpression of BG1 leads to significantly increased grain size, and the severe lines exhibit obviously perturbed gravitropism
BG1	seed	Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.	 Manipulation of BG1 in both rice and Arabidopsis can enhance plant biomass, seed weight, and yield
BG1	yield	Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.	 Manipulation of BG1 in both rice and Arabidopsis can enhance plant biomass, seed weight, and yield
BG1	grain size	Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.	 Overexpression of BG1 leads to significantly increased grain size, and the severe lines exhibit obviously perturbed gravitropism
BG1	auxin	Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.	 In addition, the mutant has increased sensitivities to both auxin and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, an auxin transport inhibitor, whereas knockdown of BG1 results in decreased sensitivities and smaller grains
BG1	auxin	Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.	 Moreover, BG1 is specifically induced by auxin treatment, preferentially expresses in the vascular tissue of culms and young panicles, and encodes a novel membrane-localized protein, strongly suggesting its role in regulating auxin transport
BG1	auxin transport	Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.	 In addition, the mutant has increased sensitivities to both auxin and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, an auxin transport inhibitor, whereas knockdown of BG1 results in decreased sensitivities and smaller grains

BG1	biomass	Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice	Manipulation of BG1 in both rice and Arabidopsis can enhance plant biomass, seed weight, and yield
BG1	seed weight	Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice	Manipulation of BG1 in both rice and Arabidopsis can enhance plant biomass, seed weight, and yield
