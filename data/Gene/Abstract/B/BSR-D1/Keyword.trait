BSR-D1	transcription factor	A Natural Allele of a Transcription Factor in Rice Confers Broad-Spectrum Blast Resistance.	 This allele causes a single nucleotide change in the promoter of the bsr-d1 gene, which results in reduced expression of the gene through the binding of the repressive MYB transcription factor and, consequently, an inhibition of H2O2 degradation and enhanced disease resistance
