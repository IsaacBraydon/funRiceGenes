Symbol	Expression
BSR-D1	 This allele causes a single nucleotide change in the promoter of the bsr-d1 gene, which results in reduced expression of the gene through the binding of the repressive MYB transcription factor and, consequently, an inhibition of H2O2 degradation and enhanced disease resistance
BSR-D1|ZFP36	 oryzae-induced expression of Bsr-d1 RNA and degradation of hydrogen peroxide to achieve resistance to M
