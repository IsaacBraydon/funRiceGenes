NA	A Natural Allele of a Transcription Factor in Rice Confers Broad-Spectrum Blast Resistance.	2017	Cell	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Key Laboratory of Major Crop Diseases and Collaborative Innovation Center for Hybrid Rice in Yangtze River Basin, Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University at Wenjiang, Chengdu, Sichuan 611130, China.	Rice feeds half the world's population, and rice blastÂ is often a destructive disease that results in significant crop loss. Non-race-specific resistance has been more effective in controlling crop diseases than race-specific resistance because of its broad spectrum and durability. Through a genome-wide association study, we report the identification of a natural allele of a C2H2-type transcription factor in rice that confers non-race-specific resistance to blast. A survey of 3,000 sequenced rice genomes reveals that this allele exists in 10% of rice, suggesting that this favorable trait has been selected through breeding. This allele causes a single nucleotide change in the promoter of the bsr-d1 gene, which results in reduced expression of the gene through the binding of the repressive MYB transcription factor and, consequently, an inhibition of H2O2 degradation and enhanced disease resistance. Our discovery highlights this novel allele as a strategy for breeding durable resistance in rice.
NA	The ascorbate peroxidase APX1 is a direct target of a zinc finger transcription factor ZFP36 and a late embryogenesis abundant protein OsLEA5 interacts with ZFP36 to co-regulate OsAPX1 in seed germination in rice.	2017	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210095, China; National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Seed germination is a vital developmental process. Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential repressor of seed germination, while ROS (reactive oxygen species) also plays a vital role in regulating seed germination. ABA could inhibit the production of ROS in seed germination, but the mechanism of ABA reduced ROS production in seed germination was hitherto unknown. Here, by ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation)-seq, we found that ZFP36, a rice zinc finger transcription factor, could directly bind to the promoter of OsAPX1, coding an ascorbate peroxidase (APX) which has the most affinity for H2O2 (substrate; a type of ROS), and act as a transcriptional activator of OsAPX1 promoter. Moreover, ZFP36 could interact with a late embryogenesis abundant protein OsLEA5 to co-regulate the promoter activity of OsAPX1. The seed germination is highly inhibited in ZFP36 overexpression plants under ABA treatment, while an RNA interference (RNAi) mutant of OsLEA5 rice seeds were less sensitive to ABA, and exogenous ASC (ascorbate acid) could alleviate the inhibition induced by ABA. Thus, our conclusion is that OsAPX1 is a direct target of ZFP36 and OsLEA5 could interact with ZFP36 to co-regulate ABA-inhibited seed germination by controlling the expression of OsAPX1.
NA	New insights into bsr-d1-mediated broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast 	2020	Mol Plant Pathol.	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Key Laboratory of Major Crop Diseases and Collaborative Innovation Center for Hybrid Rice in Yangtze River Basin, Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University at Wenjiang, Chengdu, China.	bsr-d1, an allele encoding a transcription factor identified from the rice cultivar Digu, confers durable, broad-spectrum resistance to infections by strains of Magnaporthe oryzae. bsr-d1 was predicted to inhibit M. oryzae-induced expression of Bsr-d1 RNA and degradation of hydrogen peroxide to achieve resistance to M. oryzae. However, the global effect of biological process and molecular function on blast resistance mediated by Bsr-d1 remains unknown. In this study, we compared transcriptomic profiling between Bsr-d1 knockout (Bsr-d1KO) lines and the wild type, TP309. Our study revealed that bsr-d1 mainly regulates the redox state of plant cells, but also affects amino acid and unsaturated fatty acid metabolism. We further found that BSR-D1 indirectly regulates salicylic acid biosynthesis, metabolism, and signal transduction downstream of the activation of H2 O2 signalling in the bsr-d1-mediated immune response. Furthermore, we identified a novel peroxidase-encoding gene, Perox3, as a new BSR-D1 target gene that reduces resistance to M. oryzae when overexpressed in TP309. These results provide new insights into the bsr-d1-mediated blast resistance
