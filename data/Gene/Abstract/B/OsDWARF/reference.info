8536004.pdf	Loss-of-function of a rice brassinosteroid biosynthetic enzyme, C-6 oxidase, prevents the organized arrangement and polar elongation of cells in the leaves and stem	2002	The Plant Journal	BioScience Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan	Molecular genetic and physiological studies on brassinosteroid (BR)-related mutants of dicot plants have revealed that BRs play important roles in normal plant growth and development. However, little is known about the function of BR in monocots (grasses), except for the phenotypic analysis of a rice mutant partially insensitive to BR signaling. To investigate the function of BR in monocots, we identified and characterized BR-deficient mutants of rice, BR-deficient dwarf1 (brd1). The brd1 mutants showed a range of abnormalities in organ development and growth, the most striking of which were defects in the elongation of the stem and leaves. Light microscopic observations revealed that this abnormality was primarily owing to a failure in the organization and polar elongation of the leaf and stem cells. The accumulation profile of BR compounds in the brd1 mutants suggested that these plants may be deficient in the activity of BR C-6 oxidase. Therefore, we cloned a rice gene, OsDWARF, which has a high sequence similarity to the tomato C-6 oxidase gene, DWARF. Introduction of the wild-type OsDWARF gene into brd1 rescued the abnormal phenotype of the mutants. The OsDWARF gene was expressed at a low level in all of the examined tissues, with preferential expression in the leaf sheath, and the expression was negatively regulated by brassinolide treatment. On the basis of these findings, we discuss the biological function of BRs in rice plants.

Under normal growth conditions, the mutant has very short leaf sheaths; has short, curled, and frizzled leaf blades; has few tillers; and is sterile. Longitudinal sections of the leaf sheaths revealed that the cell length along the longitudinal axis is reduced, which explains the short leaf sheaths. Transverse sections of the leaf blades revealed enlargement of the motor cells along the dorsal-ventral axis, which explains the curled and frizzled leaf blades. In addition, the number of crown roots was smaller and the growth of branch roots was weaker than those in the wild-type plant. Because exogenously supplied brassinolide considerably restored the normal phenotypes, we designated the mutant brassinosteroid-dependent 1 (brd1). Further, under darkness, brd1 showed constitutive photomorphogenesis. Quantitative analyses of endogenous sterols and brassinosteroids (BRs) indicated that BR-6-oxidase, a BR biosynthesis enzyme, would be defective. In fact, a 0.2-kb deletion was detected in the genomic region of OsBR6ox (a rice BR-6-oxidase gene) in the brd1 mutant. These results indicate that BRs are involved in many morphological and physiological processes in rice, including the elongation and unrolling of leaves, development of tillers, skotomorphogenesis, root differentiation, and reproductive growth, and that the defect of BR-6-oxidase caused the brd1 phenotype.
NA	Promotion of BR biosynthesis by miR444 is required for ammonium-triggered inhibition of root growth.	2019	Plant Physiol	Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences CITY: Beijing China [CN].	Rice (Oryza sativa), the staple food for almost half of the world's population, prefers ammonium (NH4+) as the major nitrogen resource, and while NH4+ has profound effects on rice growth and yields, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of steroidal hormones playing key roles in plant growth and development. In this study, we show that NH4+ promotes BR biosynthesis through miR444 to regulate rice root growth. miR444 targeted five homologous MADS-box transcription repressors potentially forming homologous or heterogeneous complexes in rice. miR444 positively regulated BR biosynthesis through its MADS-box targets, which directly repress the transcription of BR-deficient dwarf1 (OsBRD1), a key BR biosynthetic gene. NH4+ induced the miR444-OsBRD1 signaling cascade in roots, thereby increasing the amount of BRs, whose biosynthesis and signaling were required for NH4+-dependent root elongation inhibition. Consistently, miR444-overexpressing rice roots were hypersensitive to NH4+ depending on BR biosynthesis, and overexpression of miR444's target, OsMADS57, resulted in rice hyposensitivity to NH4+ in root elongation, which was associated with a reduction of BR content. In summary, our findings reveal a crosstalk mechanism between NH4+ and BR in which NH4+ activates miR444-OsBRD1, an undescribed BR biosynthesis-promoting signaling cascade, to increase BR content, inhibiting root elongation in rice.
