8536004.pdf	Loss-of-function of a rice brassinosteroid biosynthetic enzyme, C-6 oxidase, prevents the organized arrangement and polar elongation of cells in the leaves and stem	2002	The Plant Journal	BioScience Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan	Molecular genetic and physiological studies on brassinosteroid (BR)-related mutants of dicot plants have revealed that BRs play important roles in normal plant growth and development. However, little is known about the function of BR in monocots (grasses), except for the phenotypic analysis of a rice mutant partially insensitive to BR signaling. To investigate the function of BR in monocots, we identified and characterized BR-deficient mutants of rice, BR-deficient dwarf1 (brd1). The brd1 mutants showed a range of abnormalities in organ development and growth, the most striking of which were defects in the elongation of the stem and leaves. Light microscopic observations revealed that this abnormality was primarily owing to a failure in the organization and polar elongation of the leaf and stem cells. The accumulation profile of BR compounds in the brd1 mutants suggested that these plants may be deficient in the activity of BR C-6 oxidase. Therefore, we cloned a rice gene, OsDWARF, which has a high sequence similarity to the tomato C-6 oxidase gene, DWARF. Introduction of the wild-type OsDWARF gene into brd1 rescued the abnormal phenotype of the mutants. The OsDWARF gene was expressed at a low level in all of the examined tissues, with preferential expression in the leaf sheath, and the expression was negatively regulated by brassinolide treatment. On the basis of these findings, we discuss the biological function of BRs in rice plants.

Under normal growth conditions, the mutant has very short leaf sheaths; has short, curled, and frizzled leaf blades; has few tillers; and is sterile. Longitudinal sections of the leaf sheaths revealed that the cell length along the longitudinal axis is reduced, which explains the short leaf sheaths. Transverse sections of the leaf blades revealed enlargement of the motor cells along the dorsal-ventral axis, which explains the curled and frizzled leaf blades. In addition, the number of crown roots was smaller and the growth of branch roots was weaker than those in the wild-type plant. Because exogenously supplied brassinolide considerably restored the normal phenotypes, we designated the mutant brassinosteroid-dependent 1 (brd1). Further, under darkness, brd1 showed constitutive photomorphogenesis. Quantitative analyses of endogenous sterols and brassinosteroids (BRs) indicated that BR-6-oxidase, a BR biosynthesis enzyme, would be defective. In fact, a 0.2-kb deletion was detected in the genomic region of OsBR6ox (a rice BR-6-oxidase gene) in the brd1 mutant. These results indicate that BRs are involved in many morphological and physiological processes in rice, including the elongation and unrolling of leaves, development of tillers, skotomorphogenesis, root differentiation, and reproductive growth, and that the defect of BR-6-oxidase caused the brd1 phenotype.
