OsDWARF|OsBRD1|OsBR6ox	sheath	Loss-of-function of a rice brassinosteroid biosynthetic enzyme, C-6 oxidase, prevents the organized arrangement and polar elongation of cells in the leaves and stem	The OsDWARF gene was expressed at a low level in all of the examined tissues, with preferential expression in the leaf sheath, and the expression was negatively regulated by brassinolide treatment
OsDWARF|OsBRD1|OsBR6ox	dwarf	Loss-of-function of a rice brassinosteroid biosynthetic enzyme, C-6 oxidase, prevents the organized arrangement and polar elongation of cells in the leaves and stem	Therefore, we cloned a rice gene, OsDWARF, which has a high sequence similarity to the tomato C-6 oxidase gene, DWARF
OsDWARF|OsBRD1|OsBR6ox	dwarf	Loss-of-function of a rice brassinosteroid biosynthetic enzyme, C-6 oxidase, prevents the organized arrangement and polar elongation of cells in the leaves and stem	Introduction of the wild-type OsDWARF gene into brd1 rescued the abnormal phenotype of the mutants
OsDWARF|OsBRD1|OsBR6ox	dwarf	Loss-of-function of a rice brassinosteroid biosynthetic enzyme, C-6 oxidase, prevents the organized arrangement and polar elongation of cells in the leaves and stem	The OsDWARF gene was expressed at a low level in all of the examined tissues, with preferential expression in the leaf sheath, and the expression was negatively regulated by brassinolide treatment
OsDWARF|OsBRD1|OsBR6ox	leaf	Loss-of-function of a rice brassinosteroid biosynthetic enzyme, C-6 oxidase, prevents the organized arrangement and polar elongation of cells in the leaves and stem	The OsDWARF gene was expressed at a low level in all of the examined tissues, with preferential expression in the leaf sheath, and the expression was negatively regulated by brassinolide treatment
OsDWARF|OsBRD1|OsBR6ox	growth	OsBR6ox, a member in the brassinosteroid synthetic pathway facilitates degradation of pesticides in rice through a specific DNA demethylation mechanism.	 Genetic disruption of OsBR6ox increased rice sensitivity and led to more accumulation of ATZ and ACT, whereas transgenic rice overexpressing OsBR6ox lines (OEs) showed opposite effects with improved growth and lower ATZ and ACT accumulation in various tissues, including grains
OsDWARF|OsBRD1|OsBR6ox	stress	OsBR6ox, a member in the brassinosteroid synthetic pathway facilitates degradation of pesticides in rice through a specific DNA demethylation mechanism.	 OsBR6ox was transcriptionally induced under ATZ and ACT stress
OsDWARF|OsBRD1|OsBR6ox	detoxification	OsBR6ox, a member in the brassinosteroid synthetic pathway facilitates degradation of pesticides in rice through a specific DNA demethylation mechanism.	 Such an epigenetic modification marker was responsible for the increased OsBR6ox expression and consequent detoxification of ATZ/ACT in rice and environment
