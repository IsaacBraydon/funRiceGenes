BK-PP2A	salt sensitivity	Mutual Regulation of Receptor-Like Kinase SIT1 and B'百-PP2A Shapes the Early Response of Rice to Salt Stress 	Together, these results suggest that B'百-PP2A dephosphorylates SIT1 in planta under normal conditions and at the onset of salt exposure to maintain SIT1 phosphorylation at a low level, which consequently suppresses plant salt sensitivity.
BK-PP2A	salt tolerance	Mutual Regulation of Receptor-Like Kinase SIT1 and B'百-PP2A Shapes the Early Response of Rice to Salt Stress 	 In this way, SIT1 activity is decreased to a low level by salt, and MAPK signaling is limited to benefit plant growth. An increase in B'百-PP2A holoenzyme may target other substrates to positively regulate salt tolerance.
