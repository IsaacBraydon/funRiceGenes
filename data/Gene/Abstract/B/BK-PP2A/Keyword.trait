BK-PP2A	salt sensitivity	Mutual Regulation of Receptor-Like Kinase SIT1 and B'¦Ê-PP2A Shapes the Early Response of Rice to Salt Stress 	Together, these results suggest that B'¦Ê-PP2A dephosphorylates SIT1 in planta under normal conditions and at the onset of salt exposure to maintain SIT1 phosphorylation at a low level, which consequently suppresses plant salt sensitivity.
