BBM1	meiosis	A male-expressed rice embryogenic trigger redirected for asexual propagation through seeds.	 When genome editing to substitute mitosis for meiosis (MiMe)3,4 is combined with the expression of BBM1 in the egg cell, clonal progeny can be obtained that retain genome-wide parental heterozygosity
