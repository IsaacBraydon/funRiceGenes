BBM1|OsASGR-BBML1	meiosis	A male-expressed rice embryogenic trigger redirected for asexual propagation through seeds.	 When genome editing to substitute mitosis for meiosis (MiMe)3,4 is combined with the expression of BBM1 in the egg cell, clonal progeny can be obtained that retain genome-wide parental heterozygosity

BBM1|OsASGR-BBML1	development	Expression of genes from paternal alleles in rice zygotes and involvement of OsASGR-BBML1 in initiation of zygotic development.	 In addition, the suppression of the function of OsASGR-BBML1 and its homologues in zygotes resulted in the developmental arrest, suggesting that OsASGR-BBML1 possesses an important role in initiating zygotic development
BBM1|OsASGR-BBML1	cell division	Expression of genes from paternal alleles in rice zygotes and involvement of OsASGR-BBML1 in initiation of zygotic development.	 Interestingly, ectopic expression of OsASGR-BBML1 in egg cells induced nuclear and cell divisions, indicating that exogenously expressed OsASGR-BBML1 converts the proliferation status of the egg cell from quiescent to active
