BBM1|OsASGR-BBML1|OsBBM1	meiosis	A male-expressed rice embryogenic trigger redirected for asexual propagation through seeds.	 When genome editing to substitute mitosis for meiosis (MiMe)3,4 is combined with the expression of BBM1 in the egg cell, clonal progeny can be obtained that retain genome-wide parental heterozygosity
BBM1|OsASGR-BBML1|OsBBM1	mitosis	A male-expressed rice embryogenic trigger redirected for asexual propagation through seeds.

BBM1|OsASGR-BBML1|OsBBM1	development	Expression of genes from paternal alleles in rice zygotes and involvement of OsASGR-BBML1 in initiation of zygotic development.	 In addition, the suppression of the function of OsASGR-BBML1 and its homologues in zygotes resulted in the developmental arrest, suggesting that OsASGR-BBML1 possesses an important role in initiating zygotic development
BBM1|OsASGR-BBML1|OsBBM1	cell division	Expression of genes from paternal alleles in rice zygotes and involvement of OsASGR-BBML1 in initiation of zygotic development.	 Interestingly, ectopic expression of OsASGR-BBML1 in egg cells induced nuclear and cell divisions, indicating that exogenously expressed OsASGR-BBML1 converts the proliferation status of the egg cell from quiescent to active
BBM1|OsASGR-BBML1|OsBBM1	auxin	Somatic embryo initiation by rice BABY BOOM1 involves activation of zygote-expressed auxin biosynthesis genes.	 We identify OsYUCCA (OsYUC) auxin biosynthesis genes as direct targets of OsBBM1
BBM1|OsASGR-BBML1|OsBBM1	auxin	Somatic embryo initiation by rice BABY BOOM1 involves activation of zygote-expressed auxin biosynthesis genes.	 In somatic embryogenesis, exogenous auxin triggers OsBBM1 expression, which then activates endogenous auxin biosynthesis OsYUC genes
BBM1|OsASGR-BBML1|OsBBM1	auxin biosynthesis	Somatic embryo initiation by rice BABY BOOM1 involves activation of zygote-expressed auxin biosynthesis genes.	 We identify OsYUCCA (OsYUC) auxin biosynthesis genes as direct targets of OsBBM1
BBM1|OsASGR-BBML1|OsBBM1	auxin biosynthesis	Somatic embryo initiation by rice BABY BOOM1 involves activation of zygote-expressed auxin biosynthesis genes.	 In somatic embryogenesis, exogenous auxin triggers OsBBM1 expression, which then activates endogenous auxin biosynthesis OsYUC genes
BBM1|OsASGR-BBML1|OsBBM1	embryo	Somatic embryo initiation by rice BABY BOOM1 involves activation of zygote-expressed auxin biosynthesis genes.	 We used gene editing, transcriptome profiling, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to determine the molecular players involved in embryo initiation downstream of OsBBM1
BBM1|OsASGR-BBML1|OsBBM1	embryo	Somatic embryo initiation by rice BABY BOOM1 involves activation of zygote-expressed auxin biosynthesis genes.	 Zygotic embryo initiation involves a partnership of male and female genomes, through which paternal OsBBM1 activates maternal OsYUC genes
BBM1|OsASGR-BBML1|OsBBM1	somatic embryogenesis	Somatic embryo initiation by rice BABY BOOM1 involves activation of zygote-expressed auxin biosynthesis genes.	 Ectopic OsBBM1 initiates somatic embryogenesis without exogenous auxins but requires functional OsYUC genes
BBM1|OsASGR-BBML1|OsBBM1	somatic embryogenesis	Somatic embryo initiation by rice BABY BOOM1 involves activation of zygote-expressed auxin biosynthesis genes.	 In somatic embryogenesis, exogenous auxin triggers OsBBM1 expression, which then activates endogenous auxin biosynthesis OsYUC genes
