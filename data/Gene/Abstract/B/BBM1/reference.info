NA	A male-expressed rice embryogenic trigger redirected for asexual propagation through seeds.	2018	Nature	Department of Plant Biology, University of California, Davis, CA, USA.	The molecular pathways that trigger the initiation of embryogenesis after fertilization in flowering plants, and prevent its occurrence without fertilization, are not well understood1. Here we show in rice (Oryza sativa) that BABY BOOM1 (BBM1), a member of the AP2 family2 of transcription factors that is expressed in sperm cells, has a key role in this process. Ectopic expression of BBM1 in the egg cell is sufficient for parthenogenesis, which indicates that a single wild-type gene can bypass the fertilization checkpoint in the female gamete. Zygotic expression of BBM1 is initially specific to the male allele but is subsequently biparental, and this is consistent with its observed auto-activation. Triple knockout of the genes BBM1, BBM2 and BBM3 causes embryo arrest and abortion, which are fully rescued by male-transmitted BBM1. These findings suggest that the requirement for fertilization in embryogenesis is mediated by male-genome transmission of pluripotency factors. When genome editing to substitute mitosis for meiosis (MiMe)3,4 is combined with the expression of BBM1 in the egg cell, clonal progeny can be obtained that retain genome-wide parental heterozygosity. The synthetic asexual-propagation trait is heritable through multiple generations of clones. Hybrid crops provide increased yields that cannot be maintained by their progeny owing to genetic segregation. This work establishes the feasibility of asexual reproduction in crops, and could enable the maintenance of hybrids clonally through seed propagation5,6.
NA	Expression of genes from paternal alleles in rice zygotes and involvement of OsASGR-BBML1 in initiation of zygotic development.	2019	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Biological Sciences, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, 192-0392 Japan.	Upon fertilization in angiosperms, one sperm cell fuses with the egg cell to produce a zygote, and, via karyogamy, the parental genetic information is combined to form the diploid zygotic genome. Recently, analyses with parentally imbalanced rice zygotes indicated that parental genomes are utilized synergistically in zygotes with different functions, and that genes transcribed from the paternal or maternal allele might play important roles in zygotic development. Herein, we first conducted SNP-based mRNA-sequencing using intersubspecific rice zygotes. Twenty-three genes, with paternal allele-specific expression in zygotes, were identified, and, surprisingly, their allele dependencies in the globular-like embryo tended to be biallelic. This suggests that the paternal-dependent expression of these genes is temporary, occurring during the early stages of zygote development. Of the 23 genes, we focused on Oryza sativa Apospory-specific Genome Region (ASGR)-BABY-BOOM LIKE (BBML) 1 (OsASGR-BBML1), presumed to encode an AP2-transcription factor, due to its reported role in zygotic development. Interestingly, ectopic expression of OsASGR-BBML1 in egg cells induced nuclear and cell divisions, indicating that exogenously expressed OsASGR-BBML1 converts the proliferation status of the egg cell from quiescent to active. In addition, the suppression of the function of OsASGR-BBML1 and its homologues in zygotes resulted in the developmental arrest, suggesting that OsASGR-BBML1 possesses an important role in initiating zygotic development. Monoallelic or preferential gene expression from the paternal genome in the zygote might be a safety mechanism allowing egg cells to suppress the gene expression cascade toward early embryogenesis that is normally triggered by fusion with a sperm cell.
