Bph32	leaf	Bph32, a novel gene encoding an unknown SCR domain-containing protein, confers resistance against the brown planthopper in rice.	Expression analysis revealed that Bph32 was highly expressed in the leaf sheaths, where BPH primarily settles and feeds, at 2 and 24<U+2009>h after BPH infestation, suggesting that Bph32 may inhibit feeding in BPH
Bph32	resistance	Bph32, a novel gene encoding an unknown SCR domain-containing protein, confers resistance against the brown planthopper in rice.	The transgenic introgression of Bph32 into a susceptible rice variety significantly improved resistance to BPH
