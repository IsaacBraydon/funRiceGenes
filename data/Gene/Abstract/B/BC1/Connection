BC1	OsMYB103L|CEF1	CEF1/OsMYB103L is involved in GA-mediated regulation of secondary wall biosynthesis in rice.	OsMYB103L mediates cellulose biosynthesis and secondary walls formation mainly through directly binding the CESA4, CESA7, CESA9 and BC1 promoters and regulating their expression
BC1	RLI1	An SPX-RLI1 module regulates leaf inclination in response to phosphate availability in rice.	 RLI1 directly activates the downstream genes BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 (BU1) and BU1-LIKE 1 COMPLEX1 (BC1) to control elongation of the lamina joint cells, therefore enhancing leaf inclination
BC1	BC16	Glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor lipid remodeling directs proteins to the plasma membrane and governs cell wall mechanics.	 Loss of BC16 alters GPI lipid structure and disturbs the targeting of BC1, a GPI-AP for cellulose biosynthesis, to the PM lipid nanodomains
