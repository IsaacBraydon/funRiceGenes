BG3|OsPUP4	OsAGO2	ARGONAUTE2 Enhances Grain Length and Salt Tolerance by Activating BIG GRAIN3 to Modulate Cytokinin Distribution in Rice.	ARGONAUTE2 Enhances Grain Length and Salt Tolerance by Activating BIG GRAIN3 to Modulate Cytokinin Distribution in Rice.
BG3|OsPUP4	OsAGO2	ARGONAUTE2 Enhances Grain Length and Salt Tolerance by Activating BIG GRAIN3 to Modulate Cytokinin Distribution in Rice.	AGO2 can  become enriched on the BG3 locus and alter its histone methylation level, thus promoting BG3 expression.
BG3|OsPUP4	ONAC083	The NAC transcription factor ONAC083 negatively regulates rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae by directly activating transcription of the RING-H2 gene OsRFPH2-6.	 ONAC083 activated the transcription of the genes OsRFPH2-6, OsTrx1, and OsPUP4 by directly binding to the ACGCAA element
