bc15|OsCTL1	cellulose	Brittle culm15 encodes a membrane-associated chitinase-like protein required for cellulose biosynthesis in rice	Mutation of BC15/OsCTL1 causes reduced cellulose content and mechanical strength without obvious alterations in plant growth
bc15|OsCTL1	cellulose	Brittle culm15 encodes a membrane-associated chitinase-like protein required for cellulose biosynthesis in rice	Investigation of the global expression profile of wild-type and bc15 plants, using Illumina RNA sequencing, further suggested a possible mechanism by which BC15/OsCTL1 mediates cellulose biosynthesis and cell wall remodeling
bc15|OsCTL1	cell wall	Brittle culm15 encodes a membrane-associated chitinase-like protein required for cellulose biosynthesis in rice	Investigation of the global expression profile of wild-type and bc15 plants, using Illumina RNA sequencing, further suggested a possible mechanism by which BC15/OsCTL1 mediates cellulose biosynthesis and cell wall remodeling
bc15|OsCTL1	culm	Brittle culm15 encodes a membrane-associated chitinase-like protein required for cellulose biosynthesis in rice	In this study, we report the isolation of a brittle culm mutant, bc15, and the map-based cloning of the BC15/OsCTL1 (for chitinase-like1) gene affected in the mutant
bc15|OsCTL1	growth	Brittle culm15 encodes a membrane-associated chitinase-like protein required for cellulose biosynthesis in rice	Mutation of BC15/OsCTL1 causes reduced cellulose content and mechanical strength without obvious alterations in plant growth
