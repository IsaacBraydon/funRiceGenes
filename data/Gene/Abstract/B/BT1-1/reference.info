Toyota-2006-Expression profiling.pdf	Expression profiling of starch metabolism-related plastidic translocator genes in rice	2006	Planta	CREST, Japan Science and Technology Corporation, Omiya, Saitama, Japan.	The genes encoding the major putative rice plastidic translocators involved in the carbon flow related to starch metabolism were identified by exhaustive database searches. The genes identified were two for the triose phosphate/phosphate translocator (TPT), five for the glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate translocator (GPT) including putatively non-functional ones, four for the phosphoenolpyruvate/phosphate translocator (PPT), three for the putative ADP-glucose translocator (or Brittle-1 protein, BT1), two for the plastidic nucleotide transport protein (NTT), and one each for the plastidic glucose translocator (pGlcT) and the maltose translocator (MT). The expression patterns of the genes in various photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organs were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. OsBT1-1 was specifically expressed in the seed and its transcript level tremendously increased at the onset of vigorous starch production in the endosperm, suggesting that the ADP-glucose synthesized in the cytosol is a major precursor for starch biosynthesis in the endosperm amyloplast. In contrast, all of the genes for OsTPT, OsPPT, and OsNTT were mainly expressed in source tissues, suggesting that their proteins play essential roles in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in chloroplasts. Substantial expression of the four OsGPT genes and the OspGlcT gene in both source and sink organs suggests that the transport of glucose phosphate and glucose is physiologically important in both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues. The present study shows that comprehensive analysis of expression patterns of the plastidic translocator genes is a valuable tool for the elucidation of the functions of the translocators in the regulation of starch metabolism in rice.
NA	Analysis of the rice ADPglucose transporter (OsBT1) indicates the presence of regulatory processes in the amyloplast stroma that control ADPglucose flux into starch	2016	Plant Physiol	Washington State University CITY: Pullman STATE: Washington POSTAL_CODE: 99164-6340 United States Of America	Previous studies showed that efforts to further elevate starch synthesis in rice seeds overproducing ADPglucose (ADPglc) were prevented by processes downstream of ADPglc synthesis. Here we identified the major ADPglc transporter by studying the shrunken3 (shr3) locus of EM1093 rice line which harbors a mutation in the BRITTLE-1 (BT1) adenylate transporter (OsBt1) gene. Despite containing elevated ADPglc levels (~10 fold) compared to WT, EM1093 grains are small and shriveled due to the reduction in the amounts and size of starch granules. Increases in ADPglc levels in EM1093 were due to their poor uptake of ADP-[14C]glc by amyloplasts. To assess the potential role of BT1 as a rate determining step in starch biosynthesis, the maize ZmBt1 gene was over-expressed in WT and GlgC (CS8) transgenic line expressing a bacterial glgC-TM gene. ADPglc transport assays indicated that transgenic lines expressing ZmBT1 alone or combined with GlgC exhibited higher rates of transport (~ 2 fold) with the GlgC (CS8) and GlgC/ZmBT1 (CS8/AT5) lines showing elevated ADPglc levels in amyloplasts. These increases, however, did not lead to further enhancement in seed weights even when these plant lines were grown under elevated CO2. Overall, our results indicate that rice lines with enhanced ADPglc synthesis and import into amyloplasts reveal additional barriers within the stroma that restrict maximum carbon flow into starch.
