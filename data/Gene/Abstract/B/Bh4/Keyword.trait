Bh4	transporter	Genetic control of a transition from black to straw-white seed hull in rice domestication	Bh4 encodes an amino acid transporter
Bh4	domestication	The role of Bh4 in parallel evolution of hull colour in domesticated and weedy rice	Tests for selection indicate that Asian crops and straw hull weeds deviate from neutrality at this gene, suggesting possible selection on Bh4 during both rice domestication and de-domestication
