brd2|DIM|DWF1|LHDD10	 Our data showed that lhdd10 influences heading date by controlling the expression of heading date regulators, such as OsMADS50 in both LD and SD conditions |  lhdd10 also negatively regulated expression of chlorophyll biosynthetic genes to reduce the chlorophyll content
BRD2|DIM|DWF1|LHDD10|LTBSG1	 Furthermore, LTBSG1 along with other BR-related genes were feedback-regulated due to their obvious altered expression in mutant ltbsg1
BRD2|DIM|DWF1|LHDD10|LTBSG1	 Over-expression of BRD2 driven by different promoters into indica rice variety Jiafuzhan (JFZ) results in slender grains, suggesting its function on regulating grain shape
