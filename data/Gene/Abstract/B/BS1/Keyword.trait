BS1|DR	cell wall	Control of secondary cell wall patterning involves xylan deacetylation by a GDSL esterase.	 Cell wall composition, detailed xylan structure characterization and enzyme kinetics and activity assays on acetylated sugars and xylooligosaccharides demonstrate that BS1 is an esterase that cleaves acetyl moieties from the xylan backbone at O-2 and O-3 positions of xylopyranosyl residues
