BS1|DR	cell wall	Control of secondary cell wall patterning involves xylan deacetylation by a GDSL esterase.	 Cell wall composition, detailed xylan structure characterization and enzyme kinetics and activity assays on acetylated sugars and xylooligosaccharides demonstrate that BS1 is an esterase that cleaves acetyl moieties from the xylan backbone at O-2 and O-3 positions of xylopyranosyl residues
BS1|DR	leaf	The DROOPING LEAF (DR) gene encoding GDSL esterase is involved in silica deposition in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 This study suggests that the dr gene is involved in the regulation of silica deposition and that disruption of silica processes lead to drooping leaf phenotypes
BS1|DR	height	The DROOPING LEAF (DR) gene encoding GDSL esterase is involved in silica deposition in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Compared with the wild type, dr plants exhibited drooping leaves accompanied by a small midrib, short panicle, and reduced plant height
BS1|DR	plant height	The DROOPING LEAF (DR) gene encoding GDSL esterase is involved in silica deposition in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Compared with the wild type, dr plants exhibited drooping leaves accompanied by a small midrib, short panicle, and reduced plant height
