NA	Control of secondary cell wall patterning involves xylan deacetylation by a GDSL esterase.	2017	Nat Plants	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	O-acetylation, a ubiquitous modification of cell wall polymers, has striking impacts on plant growth and biomass utilization and needs to be tightly controlled. However, the mechanisms that underpin the control of cell wall acetylation remain elusive. Here, we show a rice brittle leaf sheath1 (bs1) mutant, which contains a lesion in a Golgi-localized GDSL esterase that deacetylates the prominent hemicellulose xylan. Cell wall composition, detailed xylan structure characterization and enzyme kinetics and activity assays on acetylated sugars and xylooligosaccharides demonstrate that BS1 is an esterase that cleaves acetyl moieties from the xylan backbone at O-2 and O-3 positions of xylopyranosyl residues. BS1 thus plays an important role in the maintenance of proper acetylation level on the xylan backbone, which is crucial for secondary wall formation and patterning. Our findings outline a mechanism for how plants modulate wall acetylation and endow a plethora of uncharacterized GDSL esterases with surmisable activities.
NA	The DROOPING LEAF (DR) gene encoding GDSL esterase is involved in silica deposition in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2020	PLoS One	Department of Plant Science and Research Institute for Agriculture and Life Sciences, and Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.	Leaf morphology is one of the most important agronomic traits in rice breeding because of its contribution to crop yield. The drooping leaf (dr) mutant was developed from the Ilpum rice cultivar by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis. Compared with the wild type, dr plants exhibited drooping leaves accompanied by a small midrib, short panicle, and reduced plant height. The phenotype of the dr plant was caused by a mutation within a single recessive gene on chromosome 2, dr (LOC_Os02g15230), which encodes a GDSL esterase. Analysis of wild-type and dr sequences revealed that the dr allele carried a single nucleotide substitution, glycine to aspartic acid. RNAi targeted to LOC_Os02g15230 produced same phenotypes to the dr mutation, confirming LOC_Os02g15230 as the dr gene. Microscopic observations and plant nutrient analysis of SiO2 revealed that silica was less abundant in dr leaves than in wild-type leaves. This study suggests that the dr gene is involved in the regulation of silica deposition and that disruption of silica processes lead to drooping leaf phenotypes.
