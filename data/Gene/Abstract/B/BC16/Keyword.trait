BC16	cellulose	Glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor lipid remodeling directs proteins to the plasma membrane and governs cell wall mechanics.	 The bc16 mutant exhibits fragile internodes, resulting from reduced cell wall thickness and cellulose content
BC16	cellulose	Glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor lipid remodeling directs proteins to the plasma membrane and governs cell wall mechanics.	 Loss of BC16 alters GPI lipid structure and disturbs the targeting of BC1, a GPI-AP for cellulose biosynthesis, to the PM lipid nanodomains
BC16	cell wall	Glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor lipid remodeling directs proteins to the plasma membrane and governs cell wall mechanics.	 The bc16 mutant exhibits fragile internodes, resulting from reduced cell wall thickness and cellulose content
