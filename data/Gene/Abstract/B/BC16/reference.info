Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring is a common protein modification that targets proteins to the plasma membrane (PM). Knowledge about the GPI lipid tail, which guides the secretion of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs), is limited in plants. Here, we report that rice (Oryza sativa) BRITTLE CULM16 (BC16), a membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) remodels GPI lipid tails and governs cell wall biomechanics. The bc16 mutant exhibits fragile internodes, resulting from reduced cell wall thickness and cellulose content. BC16 is the only MBOAT in rice and is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Yeast gup1Î” mutant restoring assay and GPI lipid composition analysis demonstrated BC16 as a GPI lipid remodelase. Loss of BC16 alters GPI lipid structure and disturbs the targeting of BC1, a GPI-AP for cellulose biosynthesis, to the PM lipid nanodomains. Atomic force microscopy revealed compromised deposition of cellulosic nanofibers in bc16, leading to an increased Young&#x27;s modulus and abnormal mechanical properties. Therefore, BC16-mediated lipid remodeling directs the GPI-APs, such as BC1, to the cell surface to fulfil multiple functions, including cellulose organization. Our work unravels a mechanism by which GPI lipids are remodeled in plants and provides insights into the control of cell wall biomechanics, offering a tool for breeding elite crops with improved support strength.
