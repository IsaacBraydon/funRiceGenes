BC12|GDD1|YD1|LGW	 Overexpression of LGW increased the grain length, indicating that LGW is a positive regulator for regulating grain length |  In addition, LGW/BC12 is directly bound to the promoter of GW7 and activates its expression |  Elevating the GW7 expression levels in lgw plants rescued the small grain size phenotype |  We conclude that LGW regulates grain development by directly binding to the GW7 promoter and activating its expression	 Overexpression of LGW increased the grain length, indicating that LGW is a positive regulator for regulating grain length
