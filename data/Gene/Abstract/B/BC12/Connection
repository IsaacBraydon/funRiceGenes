BC12|GDD1|YD1|LGW	GW7|GL7|SLG7|Chalk7	Low grain weight, a new allele of BRITTLE CULM12, affects grain size through regulating GW7 expression in rice.	 Elevating the GW7 expression levels in lgw plants rescued the small grain size phenotype
BC12|GDD1|YD1|LGW	GW7|GL7|SLG7|Chalk7	Low grain weight, a new allele of BRITTLE CULM12, affects grain size through regulating GW7 expression in rice.	 We conclude that LGW regulates grain development by directly binding to the GW7 promoter and activating its expression
