Kinesins are encoded by a large gene family involved in many basic processes of plant development. However, the number of functionally identified kinesins in rice is very limited. Here, we report the functional characterization of Brittle Culm12 (BC12), a gene encoding a kinesin-4 protein. bc12 mutants display dwarfism resulting from a significant reduction in cell number and brittleness due to an alteration in cellulose microfibril orientation and wall composition. BC12 is expressed mainly in tissues undergoing cell division and secondary wall thickening. In vitro biochemical analyses verified BC12 as an authentic motor protein. This protein was present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and associated with microtubule arrays during cell division. Mitotic microtubule array comparison, flow cytometric analysis and expression assays of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes in root-tip cells showed that cell-cycle progression is affected in bc12 mutants. BC12 is very probably regulated by CDKA;3 based on yeast two-hybrid and microarray data. Therefore, BC12 functions as a dual-targeting kinesin protein and is implicated in cell-cycle progression, cellulose microfibril deposition and wall composition in the monocot plant rice.
Plant Cell-2011-Li-628-40.pdf	Mutation of rice BC12/GDD1, which encodes a kinesin-like protein that binds to a GA biosynthesis gene promoter, leads to dwarfism with impaired cell elongation	2011	Plant Cell	Research Center for Molecular and Developmental Biology, Key Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Environmental Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	The kinesins are a family of microtubule-based motor proteins that move directionally along microtubules and are involved in many crucial cellular processes, including cell elongation in plants. Less is known about kinesins directly regulating gene transcription to affect cellular physiological processes. Here, we describe a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, gibberellin-deficient dwarf1 (gdd1), that has a phenotype of greatly reduced length of root, stems, spikes, and seeds. This reduced length is due to decreased cell elongation and can be rescued by exogenous gibberellic acid (GA(3)) treatment. GDD1 was cloned by a map-based approach, was expressed constitutively, and was found to encode the kinesin-like protein BRITTLE CULM12 (BC12). Microtubule cosedimentation assays revealed that BC12/GDD1 bound to microtubules in an ATP-dependent manner. Whole-genome microarray analysis revealed the expression of ent-kaurene oxidase (KO2), which encodes an enzyme involved in GA biosynthesis, was downregulated in gdd1. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that GDD1 bound to the element ACCAACTTGAA in the KO2 promoter. In addition, GDD1 was shown to have transactivation activity. The level of endogenous GAs was reduced in gdd1, and the reorganization of cortical microtubules was altered. Therefore, BC12/GDD1, a kinesin-like protein with transcription regulation activity, mediates cell elongation by regulating the GA biosynthesis pathway in rice.
NA	Characterization of a novel allele of bc12/gdd1 indicates a differential leaf color function for BC12/GDD1 in Indica and Japonica backgrounds	2020	Plant Science	Rice Research Institute, State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; Institute of Biotechnology and Nuclear Technology, Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chengdu 610061, China.	Leaf color is directly associated with plant photosynthesis. Here, we have isolated and identified a spontaneous rice mutant named yd1 that has yellowish leaves and dwarf stature. Map-based cloning reveals that YD1 encodes a previously reported kinesin protein from the kinesin-4 subfamily, BC12/GDD1. Arginine-328 is replaced by leucine in yd1, BC12328Leu. YD1 is mainly expressed in leaves and is involved in chlorophyll (Chl) synthesis. The yd1 mutant had less Chl and a reduced and disordered thylakoid ultrastructure. In yd1 plants, Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis associated gene expression was decreased and Chl degradation gene expression was increased, thereby leading to a reduced photosynthesis rate and grain yield. In this study we reveal that the novel BC12328Leu allele of BC12 modulated plant leaf color in yd1 plants, which has not been previously reported in studies of BC12/GDD1/MTD1/SRG1. Gene knockout results indicated that YD1 regulates leaf color in the indica rice background, but not in the japonica rice background. Our study provides new insights into molecular regulation of rice growth by BC12/GDD1 in different genetic backgrounds.
