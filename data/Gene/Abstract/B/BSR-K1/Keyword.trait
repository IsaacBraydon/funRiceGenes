BSR-K1	cytoplasm	Loss of function of a rice TPR-domain RNA-binding protein confers broad-spectrum disease resistance	Together, these results suggest that BSR-K1 functions in the cytoplasm.
BSR-K1	broad-spectrum disease resistance	Loss of function of a rice TPR-domain RNA-binding protein confers broad-spectrum disease resistance	We conclude that the bsr-k1 mutant clearly confers broad-spectrum disease resistance. 
BSR-K1	immunity	Loss of function of a rice TPR-domain RNA-binding protein confers broad-spectrum disease resistance	Thus, BSR-K1 regulates plant immunity through a mechanism different from those of previously identified RNA-binding proteins
