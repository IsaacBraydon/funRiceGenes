NA	Loss of function of a rice TPR-domain RNA-binding protein confers broad-spectrum disease resistance.	2018	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Key Laboratory of Major Crop Diseases, Sichuan Agricultural University, Wenjiang, Chengdu, Sichuan 611130, China.	Crops carrying broad-spectrum resistance loci provide an effective strategy for controlling infectious disease because these loci typically confer resistance to diverse races of a pathogen or even multiple species of pathogens. Despite their importance, only a few crop broad-spectrum resistance loci have been reported. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the ricebsr-k1(broad-spectrum resistance Kitaake-1) mutant, which confers broad-spectrum resistance againstMagnaporthe oryzaeandXanthomonas oryzaepvoryzaewith no major penalty on key agronomic traits. Map-based cloning reveals thatBsr-k1encodes a tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs)-containing protein, which binds to mRNAs of multipleOsPAL(OsPAL1-7) genes and promotes their turnover. Loss of function of theBsr-k1gene leads to accumulation ofOsPAL1-7mRNAs in thebsr-k1mutant. Furthermore, overexpression ofOsPAL1in wild-type rice TP309 confers resistance toM. oryzae, supporting the role ofOsPAL1Our discovery of thebsr-k1allele constitutes a significant conceptual advancement and provides a valuable tool for breeding broad-spectrum resistant rice.
