Development of hybrid rice has greatly contributed to increased yields during the past three decades. Two bentazon-lethal mutants 8077S and Norin8m are being utilized in developing new hybrid rice systems. When the male sterile lines are developed in such a mutant background, the problem of F1 seed contamination by self-seeds from the sterile lines can be solved by spraying bentazon at seedling stage. We first determined the sensitivity of the mutant plants to bentazon. Both mutants showed symptoms to bentazon starting from 100 mg/l, which was about 60-fold, lower than the sensitivity threshold of their wild-type controls. In addition, both mutants were sensitive to sulfonylurea-type herbicides. The locus for the mutant phenotype is bel for 8077S and bsl for Norin8m. Tests showed that the two loci are allelic to each other. The two genes were cloned by map-based cloning. Interestingly, both mutant alleles had a single-base deletion, which was confirmed by PCR-RFLP. The two loci are renamed bel ( a ) (for bel) and bel ( b ) (for bsl). The wild-type Bel gene encodes a novel cytochrome P450 monooxgenase, named CYP81A6. Analysis of the mutant protein sequence also revealed the reason for bel ( a ) being slightly tolerant than bel ( b ). Introduction of the wild-type Bel gene rescued the bentazon- and sulfonylurea-sensitive phenotype of bel ( a ) mutant. On the other hand, expression of antisense Bel in W6154S induced a mutant phenotype. Based on these results we conclude that the novel cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP81A6 encoded by Bel confers resistance to two different classes of herbicides.
Plant Physiol.-2014-Saika-pp.113.231266.pdf	A novel rice cytochrome P450 gene, CYP72A31, confers tolerance to acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides in rice and Arabidopsis	2014	Plant Physiol	Agrogenomics Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences	Target-site and non-target-site herbicide tolerance are caused by the prevention of herbicide binding to the target enzyme and the reduction to a non-lethal dose of herbicide reaching the target enzyme, respectively. There is little information on the molecular mechanisms involved in non-target-site herbicide tolerance, although it poses the greater threat in the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds and could potentially be useful for the production of herbicide-tolerant crops because it is often involved in tolerance to multi-herbicides. Bispyribac sodium (BS) is a herbicide that inhibits the activity of acetolactate synthase (ALS). Rice of the indica variety show BS tolerance while japonica rice varieties are BS sensitive. Map-based cloning and complementation tests revealed that a novel cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, CYP72A31, is involved in BS tolerance. Interestingly, BS tolerance was correlated with CYP72A31 mRNA levels in transgenic plants of rice and Arabidopsis. Moreover, Arabidopsis overexpressing CYP72A31 showed tolerance to bensulfuron-methyl (BSM), which belongs to a different class of ALS-inhibiting herbicides, suggesting that CYP72A31 can metabolize BS and BSM to a compound with reduced phytotoxicity. On the other hand, we showed that the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP81A6, which has been reported to confer BSM tolerance, is barely involved, if at all, in BS tolerance, suggesting that the CYP72A31 enzyme has different herbicide specificities compared to CYP81A6. Thus, the CYP72A31 gene is a potentially useful genetic resource in the field of weed control, herbicide development, and molecular breeding in broad range of crop species.
