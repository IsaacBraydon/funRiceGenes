The Rice BZ1 Locus Is Required for Glycosylation of Arabinogalactan Proteins and  Galactolipid and Plays a Role in both Mechanical Strength and Leaf Color.
BZ1	leaf	The Rice BZ1 Locus Is Required for Glycosylation of Arabinogalactan Proteins and  Galactolipid and Plays a Role in both Mechanical Strength and Leaf Color.	 Molecular and biochemical analysis revealed that BZ1 encodes a functional UDP-galactose/glucose epimerase (UGE) and is ubiquitously expressed with higher expression in stem and leaf tissues
BZ1	chloroplast	The Rice BZ1 Locus Is Required for Glycosylation of Arabinogalactan Proteins and  Galactolipid and Plays a Role in both Mechanical Strength and Leaf Color.	 Lipid profiling assay showed that the amount of monogalactosyldiacylglycerols (MGDG), a major chloroplast membrane glycolipid, was significantly decreased in bz1
BZ1	chloroplast	The Rice BZ1 Locus Is Required for Glycosylation of Arabinogalactan Proteins and  Galactolipid and Plays a Role in both Mechanical Strength and Leaf Color.	 Taken together, these results strongly demonstrate that BZ1 participates in UDP-galactose supply for the sugar chains biosynthesis of AGPs and MGDG, which thereby, respectively, results in altered cell wall and abnormal chloroplast development
BZ1	stem	The Rice BZ1 Locus Is Required for Glycosylation of Arabinogalactan Proteins and  Galactolipid and Plays a Role in both Mechanical Strength and Leaf Color.	 Molecular and biochemical analysis revealed that BZ1 encodes a functional UDP-galactose/glucose epimerase (UGE) and is ubiquitously expressed with higher expression in stem and leaf tissues
BZ1	growth	The Rice BZ1 Locus Is Required for Glycosylation of Arabinogalactan Proteins and  Galactolipid and Plays a Role in both Mechanical Strength and Leaf Color.	 Due to inferior mechanical strength and reduced photosynthesis, bz1 plants displayed detrimental agronomic traits, whereas BZ1 overexpressing lines showed enhanced plant growth
BZ1	development	The Rice BZ1 Locus Is Required for Glycosylation of Arabinogalactan Proteins and  Galactolipid and Plays a Role in both Mechanical Strength and Leaf Color.	 Taken together, these results strongly demonstrate that BZ1 participates in UDP-galactose supply for the sugar chains biosynthesis of AGPs and MGDG, which thereby, respectively, results in altered cell wall and abnormal chloroplast development
BZ1	photosynthesis	The Rice BZ1 Locus Is Required for Glycosylation of Arabinogalactan Proteins and  Galactolipid and Plays a Role in both Mechanical Strength and Leaf Color.	 Transcriptome analysis of stems and leaves further showed that numerous key genes involved in AGPs biosynthesis and photosynthesis metabolism were substantially suppressed in bz1
BZ1	breeding	The Rice BZ1 Locus Is Required for Glycosylation of Arabinogalactan Proteins and  Galactolipid and Plays a Role in both Mechanical Strength and Leaf Color.	 CONCLUSIONS: Our finding identifies BZ1 as a dual-targeting UGE protein for glycosylation of AGPs and MGDG and suggests a strategy for breeding robust elite  crops
BZ1	plant growth	The Rice BZ1 Locus Is Required for Glycosylation of Arabinogalactan Proteins and  Galactolipid and Plays a Role in both Mechanical Strength and Leaf Color.	 Due to inferior mechanical strength and reduced photosynthesis, bz1 plants displayed detrimental agronomic traits, whereas BZ1 overexpressing lines showed enhanced plant growth
BZ1	cellulose	The Rice BZ1 Locus Is Required for Glycosylation of Arabinogalactan Proteins and  Galactolipid and Plays a Role in both Mechanical Strength and Leaf Color.	 Multiple techniques analyses, including immunoblots, immuno-gold, and cryogenic scanning electron microscopy, demonstrated a significantly impaired glycosylation of arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) and disordered cellulose microfibril deposition in bz1
BZ1	cell wall	The Rice BZ1 Locus Is Required for Glycosylation of Arabinogalactan Proteins and  Galactolipid and Plays a Role in both Mechanical Strength and Leaf Color.	 Taken together, these results strongly demonstrate that BZ1 participates in UDP-galactose supply for the sugar chains biosynthesis of AGPs and MGDG, which thereby, respectively, results in altered cell wall and abnormal chloroplast development
BZ1	chloroplast development	The Rice BZ1 Locus Is Required for Glycosylation of Arabinogalactan Proteins and  Galactolipid and Plays a Role in both Mechanical Strength and Leaf Color.	 Taken together, these results strongly demonstrate that BZ1 participates in UDP-galactose supply for the sugar chains biosynthesis of AGPs and MGDG, which thereby, respectively, results in altered cell wall and abnormal chloroplast development
