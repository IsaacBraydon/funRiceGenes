BSR2	growth	The rice CYP78A gene BSR2 confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice.	The rice CYP78A gene BSR2 confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice.
BSR2	growth	The rice CYP78A gene BSR2 confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice.	 Both Arabidopsis and rice plants overexpressing BSR2 had slower growth and produced longer seeds than wild-type control plants
BSR2	growth	The rice CYP78A gene BSR2 confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice.	 These results indicate that BSR2 is associated with disease resistance, growth rate and seed size in rice and suggest that its function is evolutionarily conserved in both monocot rice and dicot Arabidopsis
BSR2	resistance	The rice CYP78A gene BSR2 confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice.	The rice CYP78A gene BSR2 confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice.
BSR2	resistance	The rice CYP78A gene BSR2 confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice.	 When overexpressed in rice, BSR2 also conferred resistance to two R
BSR2	seed	The rice CYP78A gene BSR2 confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice.	The rice CYP78A gene BSR2 confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice.
BSR2	seed	The rice CYP78A gene BSR2 confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice.	 These results indicate that BSR2 is associated with disease resistance, growth rate and seed size in rice and suggest that its function is evolutionarily conserved in both monocot rice and dicot Arabidopsis
BSR2	disease	The rice CYP78A gene BSR2 confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice.	 These results indicate that BSR2 is associated with disease resistance, growth rate and seed size in rice and suggest that its function is evolutionarily conserved in both monocot rice and dicot Arabidopsis
BSR2	disease resistance	The rice CYP78A gene BSR2 confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice.	 These results indicate that BSR2 is associated with disease resistance, growth rate and seed size in rice and suggest that its function is evolutionarily conserved in both monocot rice and dicot Arabidopsis
BSR2	seed size	The rice CYP78A gene BSR2 confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice.	The rice CYP78A gene BSR2 confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice.
BSR2	seed size	The rice CYP78A gene BSR2 confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice.	 These results indicate that BSR2 is associated with disease resistance, growth rate and seed size in rice and suggest that its function is evolutionarily conserved in both monocot rice and dicot Arabidopsis
BSR2	growth rate	The rice CYP78A gene BSR2 confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice.	 These results indicate that BSR2 is associated with disease resistance, growth rate and seed size in rice and suggest that its function is evolutionarily conserved in both monocot rice and dicot Arabidopsis
