bZIP65	transcription factor	Transcription factor bZIP65 delays flowering via suppressing Ehd1 expression in rice.	Transcription factor bZIP65 delays flowering via suppressing Ehd1 expression in rice.
bZIP65	heading date	Transcription factor bZIP65 delays flowering via suppressing Ehd1 expression in rice.	 Taken together, we cloned a new gene, bZIP65, regulating rice heading date, and uncovered the mechanism of bZIP65 delaying flowering time, where bZIP65 increases the H3K27me3 level of Ehd1 and transcriptionally represses the expression of Ehd1, similar to its homolog bZIP71
bZIP65	flowering time	Transcription factor bZIP65 delays flowering via suppressing Ehd1 expression in rice.	 The overexpression of bZIP65 delays flowering, while bzip65 mutants have similar flowering time to SJ2 (Songjing2) in both long-day and short-day conditions
