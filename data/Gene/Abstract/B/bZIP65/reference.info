GRID: grid.412064.5. ISNI: 0000 0004 1808 3449	Flowering time is one of the most fundamental factors that determine the distribution and final yield of rice. Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) is a B-type response regulator which functions as a flowering time activator. Although diverse flowering time genes have been reported as regulatory factors of Ehd1 expression, the potential regulators of Ehd1 largely remain to be identified. Here, we identified a basic leucine zipper transcription factor bZIP65, a homolog of bZIP71, as a new negative regulator of Ehd1. The overexpression of bZIP65 delays flowering, while bzip65 mutants have similar flowering time to SJ2 (Songjing2) in both long-day and short-day conditions. Biochemically, bZIP65 associates with Ehd1 promoter and transcriptionally represses the expression of Ehd1. Moreover, we found that bZIP65 enhances H3K27me3 level of Ehd1. Taken together, we cloned a new gene, bZIP65, regulating rice heading date, and uncovered the mechanism of bZIP65 delaying flowering time, where bZIP65 increases the H3K27me3 level of Ehd1 and transcriptionally represses the expression of Ehd1, similar to its homolog bZIP71.
