bZIP65	Ehd1	Transcription factor bZIP65 delays flowering via suppressing Ehd1 expression in rice.	Transcription factor bZIP65 delays flowering via suppressing Ehd1 expression in rice.
bZIP65	Ehd1	Transcription factor bZIP65 delays flowering via suppressing Ehd1 expression in rice.	 Here, we identified a basic leucine zipper transcription factor bZIP65, a homolog of bZIP71, as a new negative regulator of Ehd1
bZIP65	Ehd1	Transcription factor bZIP65 delays flowering via suppressing Ehd1 expression in rice.	 Biochemically, bZIP65 associates with Ehd1 promoter and transcriptionally represses the expression of Ehd1
bZIP65	Ehd1	Transcription factor bZIP65 delays flowering via suppressing Ehd1 expression in rice.	 Moreover, we found that bZIP65 enhances H3K27me3 level of Ehd1
bZIP65	Ehd1	Transcription factor bZIP65 delays flowering via suppressing Ehd1 expression in rice.	 Taken together, we cloned a new gene, bZIP65, regulating rice heading date, and uncovered the mechanism of bZIP65 delaying flowering time, where bZIP65 increases the H3K27me3 level of Ehd1 and transcriptionally represses the expression of Ehd1, similar to its homolog bZIP71
