In this study, we conducted a molecular marker-based genetic analysis of the BPH resistance of â€™B5â€<U+393C><U+3E39>, a highly resistant line that derived its resistant genes from the wild rice Oryza officinalis. Insect resistance was evaluated using 250 F3 families from a cross between â€™B5â€<U+393C><U+3E39> and â€™Minghui 63â€<U+393C><U+3E39>, based on which the resistance of each F2 plant was inferred. Two bulks were made by mixing, respectively, DNA samples from highly resistant plants and highly susceptible plants selected from the F2 population. The bulks were surveyed for restriction fragment length polymorphism using probes representing all 12 chromosomes at regular intervals. The survey revealed two genomic regions on chromosome 3 and chromosome 4 respectively that contained genes for BPH resistance. The existence of the two loci were further assessed by QTL (quantitative trait locus) analysis, which resolved these two loci to a 14.3-cM interval on chromosome 3 and a 0.4-cM interval on chromosome 4. Comparison of the chromosomal locations and reactions to BPH biotypes indicated that these two genes are different from at least nine of the ten previously identified BPH resistance genes. Both of the genes had large effects on BPH resistance and the two loci acted essentially independent of each other in determining t he resistance. These two genes may be a useful BPH resistance resource for rice breeding programs.
PNAS-2009-Du-0912139106.pdf	Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Plant Development Biology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China.	Planthoppers are highly destructive pests in crop production worldwide. Brown planthopper (BPH) causes the most serious damage of the rice crop globally among all rice pests. Growing resistant varieties is the most effective and environment-friendly strategy for protecting the crop from BPH. More than 19 BPH-resistance genes have been reported and used to various extents in rice breeding and production. In this study, we cloned Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to BPH at seedling and maturity stages of the rice plant, using a map-base cloning approach. We show that Bph14 encodes a coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding, and leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR) protein. Sequence comparison indicates that Bph14 carries a unique LRR domain that might function in recognition of the BPH insect invasion and activating the defense response. Bph14 is predominantly expressed in vascular bundles, the site of BPH feeding. Expression of Bph14 activates the salicylic acid signaling pathway and induces callose deposition in phloem cells and trypsin inhibitor production after planthopper infestation, thus reducing the feeding, growth rate, and longevity of the BPH insects. Our work provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of rice defense against insects and facilitates the development of resistant varieties to control this devastating insect.
NA	The Coiled-coil and Nucleotide Binding Domains of BROWN PLANTHOPPER RESISTANCE14 Function in Signaling and Resistance Against Planthopper in Rice.	2017	Plant Cell	Wuhan University CITY: Wuhan STATE: Hubei China [CN].	BROWN PLANTHOPPER RESISTANCE14 (BPH14), the first planthopper-resistance gene isolated via map-based cloning in rice (Oryza sativa), encodes a coiled-coil-, nucleotide-binding site-, leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR) protein. Several planthopper and aphid resistance genes encoding proteins with similar structures have recently been identified. Here, we analyzed the functions of the domains of BPH14 to identify molecular mechanisms underpinning BPH14-mediated planthopper resistance. The CC or NB domains alone or in combination (CC-NB [CN]) conferred a similar level of brown planthopper resistance to that of full-length (FL) BPH14. Both domains activated the salicylic acid signaling pathway and defense gene expression. In rice protoplasts and Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, these domains increased reactive oxygen species levels without triggering cell death. Additionally, the resistance domains and FL BPH14 protein formed homo-complexes that interacted with transcription factors WRKY46 and WRKY72. In rice protoplasts, the expression of FL BPH14 or its CC, NB, and CN domains increased the accumulation of WRKY46 and WRKY72 as well as WRKY46- and WRKY72-dependent transactivation activity. WRKY46 and WRKY72 bind to the promoters of the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase gene RLCK281 and the callose synthase gene LOC_Os01g67364.1, whose transactivation activity is dependent on WRKY46 or WRKY72. These findings shed light on this important insect-resistance mechanism.
NA	The control of the brown planthopper by the rice Bph14 gene is affected by nitrogen.	2020	Pest Manag Sci.	College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	BACKGROUND: The brown rice planthopper (BPH) is a devastating rice pest in Asia.  Bph14 is the first cloned BPH-resistance gene in rice, inducing callose deposition while impeding BPH's feeding. Nitrogen application affects plant growth and resistance. However, there is little evidence on the influence of nitrogen on callose content or regulation of rice BPH resistance. In this study,  Luoyou9348 (containing Bph14 and highly resistance to BPH) and Yangliangyou6 (without Bph14 and susceptible to BPH) were planted under varying nitrogen regimes (0 kg ha-1 , 90 kg ha-1 , 180 kg ha-1 ) to determine their effects on the resistance levels of the rice to BPH feeding. The experiments involved BPH performance, plant volatiles profiling and BPH preferences in laboratory and filed experiments. RESULTS: We found that BPH eggs hatching rate, total eggs laid and BPH preference increased with increase in nitrogen application in both rice varieties. However,  the expression of Bph14, callose content and BPH feeding significantly declined with an increase in nitrogen fertilization in Luoyou9348, when compared to Yangliangyou6. Also, the emission of volatile terpene compounds increased with increase in nitrogen application, which resulted in an increase in BPH numbers on both varieties. Two-way ANOVA indicated a significant interaction between rice variety and nitrogen in BPH feeding behavior. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide an insight for addressing problems involved in the incorporation of insecticidal genes into crop plants. The effects of nitrogen on insecticidal gene expression in rice plant defense are discussed.
