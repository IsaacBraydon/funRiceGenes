Bph14	salicylic acid	Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice	 Expression of Bph14 activates the salicylic acid signaling pathway and induces callose deposition in phloem cells and trypsin inhibitor production after planthopper infestation, thus reducing the feeding, growth rate, and longevity of the BPH insects
Bph14	defense	"Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice"	 Sequence comparison indicates that Bph14 carries a unique LRR domain that might function in recognition of the BPH insect invasion and activating the defense response
Bph14	growth	Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice	 Expression of Bph14 activates the salicylic acid signaling pathway and induces callose deposition in phloem cells and trypsin inhibitor production after planthopper infestation, thus reducing the feeding, growth rate, and longevity of the BPH insects
Bph14	brown planthopper	Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice	Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice
Bph14	defense response	"Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice"	 Sequence comparison indicates that Bph14 carries a unique LRR domain that might function in recognition of the BPH insect invasion and activating the defense response
Bph14	vascular bundle	Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice	 Bph14 is predominantly expressed in vascular bundles, the site of BPH feeding
Bph14	insect	Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice	 Sequence comparison indicates that Bph14 carries a unique LRR domain that might function in recognition of the BPH insect invasion and activating the defense response
Bph14	insect	Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice	 Expression of Bph14 activates the salicylic acid signaling pathway and induces callose deposition in phloem cells and trypsin inhibitor production after planthopper infestation, thus reducing the feeding, growth rate, and longevity of the BPH insects
Bph14	seedling	Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice	 In this study, we cloned Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to BPH at seedling and maturity stages of the rice plant, using a map-base cloning approach
