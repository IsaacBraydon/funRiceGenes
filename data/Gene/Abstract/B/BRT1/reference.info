NA	Rice florigens control a common set of genes at the shoot apical meristem including the F-BOX BROADER TILLER ANGLE 1 that regulates tiller angle and spikelet development.	2023	Plant J	Department of Biosciences, University of Milan, via Celoria 26, 20133, Milan, Italy.	Rice flowering is triggered by transcriptional reprogramming at the shoot apical meristem (SAM) mediated by florigenic proteins produced in leaves in response to changes in photoperiod. Florigens are more rapidly expressed under short days (SDs) compared to long days (LDs) and include the HEADING DATE 3a (Hd3a) and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (RFT1) Phosphatidyl Ethanolamine Binding Proteins. Hd3a and RFT1 are largely redundant at converting the SAM into an inflorescence, but whether they activate the same target genes and convey all photoperiodic information that modifies gene expression at the SAM is currently unclear. We uncoupled the contribution of Hd3a and RFT1 to transcriptome reprogramming at the SAM by RNA-sequencing of dexamethasone-inducible over-expressors of single florigens and wild type plants exposed to photoperiodic induction. Fifteen highly differentially expressed genes common to Hd3a, RFT1 and SDs were retrieved, ten of which still uncharacterized. Detailed functional studies on some candidates revealed a role for LOC_Os04g13150 in determining tiller angle and spikelet development and the gene was renamed BROADER TILLER ANGLE 1 (BRT1). We identified a core set of genes controlled by florigen-mediated photoperiodic induction and defined the function of a novel florigen target controlling tiller angle and spikelet development.
