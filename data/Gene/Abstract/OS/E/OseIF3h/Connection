OseIF3h	OsMTA2	OseIF3h Regulates Plant Growth and Pollen Development at Translational Level Presumably through Interaction with OsMTA2	OseIF3h Regulates Plant Growth and Pollen Development at Translational Level Presumably through Interaction with OsMTA2
OseIF3h	OsMTA2	OseIF3h Regulates Plant Growth and Pollen Development at Translational Level Presumably through Interaction with OsMTA2	 Further investigation demonstrated an interaction between OseIF3h and OsMTA2 (mRNA adenosine methylase 2), a rice homolog of METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3) in mammals, which provided new insight into how N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of messenger RNA (mRNA) is engaged in the translation initiation process in monocot species
OseIF3h	OsMTA2	OseIF3h Regulates Plant Growth and Pollen Development at Translational Level Presumably through Interaction with OsMTA2	 Therefore, we infer that OseIF3h interacts with OsMTA2 to target a particular subset of genes at translational level, regulating plant growth and pollen development
