OseEF1A1	 Overexpression of either OsWD40-193 or OseEF1A1 led to enhance susceptibility to H |  Further transcriptomic analysis showed that OseEF1A1 deletion altered the expression of genes association with salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and abolic acid signaling pathways and increased the accumulation of secondary metabolites to enhance resistance in rice	 Overexpression of either OsWD40-193 or OseEF1A1 led to enhance susceptibility to H
