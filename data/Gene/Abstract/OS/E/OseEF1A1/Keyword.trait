OseEF1A1	resistance	Interaction of negative regulator OsWD40-193 with OseEF1A1 inhibits Oryza sativa resistance to Hirschmanniella mucronata infection.	Interaction of negative regulator OsWD40-193 with OseEF1A1 inhibits Oryza sativa resistance to Hirschmanniella mucronata infection.
OseEF1A1	resistance	Interaction of negative regulator OsWD40-193 with OseEF1A1 inhibits Oryza sativa resistance to Hirschmanniella mucronata infection.	 Here, we demonstrated that protein OsWD40-193 interacted with the extension factor OseEF1A1 and both were negative regulators inhibiting rice resistance to H
OseEF1A1	resistance	Interaction of negative regulator OsWD40-193 with OseEF1A1 inhibits Oryza sativa resistance to Hirschmanniella mucronata infection.	 mucronata, whereas the absence of OsWD40-193 or OseEF1A1 led to resistance
OseEF1A1	resistance	Interaction of negative regulator OsWD40-193 with OseEF1A1 inhibits Oryza sativa resistance to Hirschmanniella mucronata infection.	 Further transcriptomic analysis showed that OseEF1A1 deletion altered the expression of genes association with salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and abolic acid signaling pathways and increased the accumulation of secondary metabolites to enhance resistance in rice
OseEF1A1	salicylic acid	Interaction of negative regulator OsWD40-193 with OseEF1A1 inhibits Oryza sativa resistance to Hirschmanniella mucronata infection.	 Further transcriptomic analysis showed that OseEF1A1 deletion altered the expression of genes association with salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and abolic acid signaling pathways and increased the accumulation of secondary metabolites to enhance resistance in rice
OseEF1A1	jasmonic	Interaction of negative regulator OsWD40-193 with OseEF1A1 inhibits Oryza sativa resistance to Hirschmanniella mucronata infection.	 Further transcriptomic analysis showed that OseEF1A1 deletion altered the expression of genes association with salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and abolic acid signaling pathways and increased the accumulation of secondary metabolites to enhance resistance in rice
OseEF1A1	jasmonic acid	Interaction of negative regulator OsWD40-193 with OseEF1A1 inhibits Oryza sativa resistance to Hirschmanniella mucronata infection.	 Further transcriptomic analysis showed that OseEF1A1 deletion altered the expression of genes association with salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and abolic acid signaling pathways and increased the accumulation of secondary metabolites to enhance resistance in rice
