Rice is a crucial food crop worldwide, but it is highly susceptible to Hirschmanniella mucronata, a migratory parasitic nematode. No rice variety has been identified that could resist H. mucronata infection. Therefore, it is very important to study the interaction between rice and H. mucronata to breed resistant rice varieties. Here, we demonstrated that protein OsWD40-193 interacted with the extension factor OseEF1A1 and both were negative regulators inhibiting rice resistance to H. mucronata infection. Overexpression of either OsWD40-193 or OseEF1A1 led to enhance susceptibility to H. mucronata, whereas the absence of OsWD40-193 or OseEF1A1 led to resistance. Further transcriptomic analysis showed that OseEF1A1 deletion altered the expression of genes association with salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and abolic acid signaling pathways and increased the accumulation of secondary metabolites to enhance resistance in rice. Our study showed that H. mucronata infection affected the expression of negative regulators in rice and inhibited rice resistance, which was conducive to the infection of nematode. Together, our data showed that H. mucronata affected the expression of negative regulators to facilitate its infection and provided potential target genes to engineering resistance germplasm via gene editing of the negative regulators.
