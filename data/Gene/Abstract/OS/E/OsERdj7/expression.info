OsERdj7	 Next, to investigate its role during seed maturation, expression of OsERdj7 was specifically downregulated using RNA interference (RNAi) under the control of the endosperm-specific 16<U+2009>kDa prolamin promoter in transgenic rice |  On the other hand, induction of ER associated degradation (ERAD) increased OsERdj7 expression in transgenic rice seeds in which ERAD related genes were highly expressed	 Next, to investigate its role during seed maturation, expression of OsERdj7 was specifically downregulated using RNA interference (RNAi) under the control of the endosperm-specific 16<U+2009>kDa prolamin promoter in transgenic rice
