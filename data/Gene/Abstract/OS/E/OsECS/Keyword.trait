OsECS	grain	Homologous expression of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase increases grain yield and tolerance of transgenic rice plants to environmental stresses	Under paddy field conditions, OsECS-overexpression in transgenic rice plants increased rice grain yield (TGW) and improved biomass
OsECS	grain	Homologous expression of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase increases grain yield and tolerance of transgenic rice plants to environmental stresses	Our findings suggest that increases in grain yield by OsECS overexpression could improve crop yields under natural environmental conditions
OsECS	abiotic stress	Homologous expression of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase increases grain yield and tolerance of transgenic rice plants to environmental stresses	Overall, our results show that OsECS overexpression in transgenic rice increases tolerance and germination rate in the presence of abiotic stress by improving redox homeostasis via an enhanced GSH pool
