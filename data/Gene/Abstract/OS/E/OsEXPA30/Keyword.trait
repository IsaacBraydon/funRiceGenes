OsEXPA30	root hair	Root hair-specific expansins modulate root hair elongation in rice	 Complementation of the OsEXPA17 mutant with other root hair EXPAs (OsEXPA30 and Arabidopsis EXPA7) can restore root hair elongation, indicating functional conservation of these root hair EXPAs in monocots and dicots
