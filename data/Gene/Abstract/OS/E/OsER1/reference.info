NA	Phylogenetic and CRISPR/Cas9 Studies in Deciphering the Evolutionary Trajectory and Phenotypic Impacts of Rice ERECTA Genes.	2018	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.	The ERECTA family genes (ERfs) have been found to play diverse functions in Arabidopsis, including controlling cell proliferation and cell growth, regulating stomata patterning, and responding to various stresses. This wide range of functions has rendered them as a potential candidate for crop improvement. However, information on their functional roles, particularly their morphological impact, in crop genomes, such as rice, is limited. Here, through evolutionary prediction, we first depict the evolutionary trajectory of the ER family, and show that the ER family is actually highly conserved across different species, suggesting that most of their functions may also be observed in other plant species. We then take advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated nuclease 9) system to assess their morphological impact on one of the most important crops, rice. Loss-of-function mutants of OsER1 and OsER2 display shortened plant stature and reduced panicle size, suggesting they possibly also functioned in regulating cell proliferation and cell growth in rice. In addition to functions similar to that in Arabidopsis, we also find clues that rice ERfs may play unique functional roles. The OsER2 displayed more severe phenotypic changes than OsER1, indicating putative differentiation in their functions. The OsERL might be of essential in its function, and the proper function of all three rice ER genes might be dependent of their genetic background. Future investigations relating to these functions are key to exploiting ERfs in crop development.
NA	ERECTA1 Acts Upstream of the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 Cascade to Control Spikelet Number by Regulating Cytokinin Metabolism in Rice 	2020	plant cell	Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, SIBS, CAS CITY: Shanghai China [CN].	Grain number is a flexible trait that strongly contributes to grain yield. In rice (Oryza sativa), the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 cascade, which is negatively regulated by the dual-specificity phosphatase GSN1, coordinates the trade-off between grain number and grain size. However, the specific components upstream and downstream of the GSN1-MAPK module that regulate spikelet number per panicle remain obscure. Here, we report that ERECTA1 (OsER1), a negative regulator of spikelet number per panicle, acts upstream of the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 cascade and that the OsER1-OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 pathway is required to maintain cytokinin homeostasis. OsMPK6 directly interacts with and phosphorylates the zinc finger transcription factor DST to enhance its transcriptional activation of CYTOKININ OXIDASE2 (OsCKX2), indicating that the OsER1-OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 pathway shapes panicle morphology by regulating cytokinin metabolism. Furthermore, overexpression of either DST or OsCKX2 rescued the spikelet number phenotype of the oser1, osmkkk10, osmkk4, and osmpk6 mutants, suggesting that the DST-OsCKX2 module genetically functions downstream of the OsER1-OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 pathway. These findings reveal specific crosstalk between a MAPK signaling pathway and cytokinin metabolism, shedding light on how developmental signals modulate phytohormone homeostasis to shape the inflorescence.
