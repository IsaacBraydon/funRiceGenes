NA	Novel crosstalk between ethylene- and jasmonic acid-pathway responses to a piercing-sucking insect in rice.	2019	New Phytol	Key Laboratory of Insect Developmental and Evolutionary Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200032, China.	Ethylene (ET) and jasmonic acid (JA) play important roles in plant defenses against biotic stresses. Crosstalk between JA and ET has been well studied in mediating pathogen resistance, but its roles in piercing-sucking insect resistance are unclear. The brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens) is the most notorious piercing-sucking insect specific to rice (Oryza sativa) that severely affects yield. A genetic analysis revealed that OsEBF1 and OsEIL1, which are in the ET signaling pathway, positively and negatively regulated BPH resistance, respectively. Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed direct interactions between OsEBF1 and OsEIL1. OsEBF1, an E3 ligase, mediated the degradation of OsEIL1 through the ubiquitination pathway, indicating the negative regulation of the ET-signaling pathway in response to BPH infestation. An RNA-seq analysis revealed that a JA biosynthetic pathway-related gene, OsLOX9, was down-regulated significantly in the oseil1 mutant. Biochemical analyses including yeast one-hybrid, Dual-LUC (Dual luciferase) and EMSA (Electrophoretic mobility shift assay) confirmed the direct regulation of OsLOX9 by OsEIL1. This study revealed the synergistic and negative regulation of JA and ET pathways in response to piercing-sucking insect attack. The synergistic mechanism was realized by transcriptional regulation of OsEIL1 on OsLOX9. OsEIL1-OsLOX9 is a novel crosstalk site in these two phytohormone signaling pathways.
NA	The F-box protein OsEBF2 confers the resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilparvata lugens St√•l).	2022	Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Plant Genetics and Molecular Breeding, Zhoukou Normal University, Zhoukou 466001, China.	The brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens) is a piercing-sucking insect pest specific to rice plants and may cause severe declines in rice yields. Therefore, it is of great theoretical significance and practical application value to elucidate the molecular mechanism of rice resistance to BPH. Previous studies have shown that an ethylene (ET) signaling pathway gene, OsEBF1, positively regulates BPH resistance in rice. OsEBF1 is an E3 ligase that mediates the degradation of another ET pathway gene, OsEIL1. OsEBF2 is the homologous gene of OsEBF1, and the sequence identity between the two genes is 78.5%. Our results indicated that OsEBF2 can directly interact with OsEIL1 and positively regulate rice resistance to BPH. More importantly, there were no obvious differences in agronomic traits between WT and OsEBF2OE transgenic lines. The resistance mechanism of the OsEBF2 gene may be to reduce the content of ET in rice by inhibiting the expression of ethylene response factor genes. This study revealed that OsEBF2 is an F-box protein that positively regulates the rice resistance to BPH and can be used as an effective target gene for rice BPH resistance breeding.
NA	Phytochrome B mediates dim-light-reduced insect resistance by promoting the ethylene pathway in rice.	2022	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Province and Ministry Co-sponsored Collaborative Innovation Center for Modern Crop Production, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Increasing planting density is one of the most effective ways to improve crop yield. However, one major factor that limits crop planting density is the weakened immunity of plants to pathogens and insects caused by dim light (DL) under shade conditions. The molecular mechanism underlying how DL compromises plant immunity remains unclear. Here, we report that DL reduces rice (Oryza sativa) resistance against brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens) by elevating ethylene (ET) biosynthesis and signaling in an Phytochrome B (OsPHYB)-dependent manner. The DL-reduced BPH resistance is relieved in osphyB mutants, but aggravated in OsPHYB overexpressing plants. Further, we found that DL reduces the nuclear accumulation of OsphyB, thus alleviating Phytochrome Interacting Factor Like14 (OsPIL14) degradation, consequently leading to the up-regulation of 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-Carboxylate Oxidase1 (OsACO1) and an increase in ET levels. In addition, we found that nuclear OsphyB stabilizes Ethylene Insensitive Like2 (OsEIL2) by competitively interacting with EIN3 Binding F-Box Protein (OsEBF1) to enhance ET signaling in rice, which contrasts with previous findings that phyB blocks ET signaling by facilitating Ethylene Insensitive3 (EIN3) degradation in other plant species. Thus, enhanced ET biosynthesis and signaling reduces BPH resistance under DL conditions. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism of the light-regulated ET pathway and host-insect interactions and potential strategies for sustainable insect management.
