OsEBF1	OsEIL1|MHZ6	Novel crosstalk between ethylene- and jasmonic acid-pathway responses to a piercing-sucking insect in rice.	 A genetic analysis revealed that OsEBF1 and OsEIL1, which are in the ET signaling pathway, positively and negatively regulated BPH resistance, respectively
OsEBF1	OsEIL1|MHZ6	Novel crosstalk between ethylene- and jasmonic acid-pathway responses to a piercing-sucking insect in rice.	 Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed direct interactions between OsEBF1 and OsEIL1
OsEBF1	OsEIL1|MHZ6	Novel crosstalk between ethylene- and jasmonic acid-pathway responses to a piercing-sucking insect in rice.	 OsEBF1, an E3 ligase, mediated the degradation of OsEIL1 through the ubiquitination pathway, indicating the negative regulation of the ET-signaling pathway in response to BPH infestation
OsEBF1	OsEBF2	The F-box protein OsEBF2 confers the resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilparvata lugens Stål).	 OsEBF2 is the homologous gene of OsEBF1, and the sequence identity between the two genes is 78
OsEBF1	OsEIL1|MHZ6	The F-box protein OsEBF2 confers the resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilparvata lugens Stål).	 OsEBF1 is an E3 ligase that mediates the degradation of another ET pathway gene, OsEIL1
OsEBF1	OsEIL2	Phytochrome B mediates dim-light-reduced insect resistance by promoting the ethylene pathway in rice.	 In addition, we found that nuclear OsphyB stabilizes Ethylene Insensitive Like2 (OsEIL2) by competitively interacting with EIN3 Binding F-Box Protein (OsEBF1) to enhance ET signaling in rice, which contrasts with previous findings that phyB blocks ET signaling by facilitating Ethylene Insensitive3 (EIN3) degradation in other plant species
OsEBF1	PHYB|OsphyB	Phytochrome B mediates dim-light-reduced insect resistance by promoting the ethylene pathway in rice.	 In addition, we found that nuclear OsphyB stabilizes Ethylene Insensitive Like2 (OsEIL2) by competitively interacting with EIN3 Binding F-Box Protein (OsEBF1) to enhance ET signaling in rice, which contrasts with previous findings that phyB blocks ET signaling by facilitating Ethylene Insensitive3 (EIN3) degradation in other plant species
