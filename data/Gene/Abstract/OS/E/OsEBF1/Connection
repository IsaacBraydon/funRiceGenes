OsEBF1	OsEIL1|MHZ6	Novel crosstalk between ethylene- and jasmonic acid-pathway responses to a piercing-sucking insect in rice.	 A genetic analysis revealed that OsEBF1 and OsEIL1, which are in the ET signaling pathway, positively and negatively regulated BPH resistance, respectively
OsEBF1	OsEIL1|MHZ6	Novel crosstalk between ethylene- and jasmonic acid-pathway responses to a piercing-sucking insect in rice.	 Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed direct interactions between OsEBF1 and OsEIL1
OsEBF1	OsEIL1|MHZ6	Novel crosstalk between ethylene- and jasmonic acid-pathway responses to a piercing-sucking insect in rice.	 OsEBF1, an E3 ligase, mediated the degradation of OsEIL1 through the ubiquitination pathway, indicating the negative regulation of the ET-signaling pathway in response to BPH infestation
