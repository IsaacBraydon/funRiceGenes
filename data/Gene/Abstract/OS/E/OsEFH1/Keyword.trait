OsEFH1	grain	Rice miR1432 Fine-Tunes the Balance of Yield and Blast Disease Resistance via Different Modules.	 Overexpression of OsEFH1 leads to enhanced rice resistance but decreased grain yield
OsEFH1	resistance	Rice miR1432 Fine-Tunes the Balance of Yield and Blast Disease Resistance via Different Modules.	 Overexpression of OsEFH1 leads to enhanced rice resistance but decreased grain yield
OsEFH1	grain yield	Rice miR1432 Fine-Tunes the Balance of Yield and Blast Disease Resistance via Different Modules.	 Overexpression of OsEFH1 leads to enhanced rice resistance but decreased grain yield
OsEFH1	yield	Rice miR1432 Fine-Tunes the Balance of Yield and Blast Disease Resistance via Different Modules.	 Overexpression of OsEFH1 leads to enhanced rice resistance but decreased grain yield
OsEFH1	immunity	Rice miR1432 Fine-Tunes the Balance of Yield and Blast Disease Resistance via Different Modules.	 Consistently, blocking miR1432 or overexpression of OsEFH1 improves chitin-triggered immunity responses
