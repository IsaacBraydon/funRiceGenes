OsEFH1	 miR1432 suppresses the expression of LOC_Os03g59790, which encodes an EF-hand family protein 1 (OsEFH1) |  Overexpression of OsEFH1 leads to enhanced rice resistance but decreased grain yield |  Consistently, blocking miR1432 or overexpression of OsEFH1 improves chitin-triggered immunity responses	 Overexpression of OsEFH1 leads to enhanced rice resistance but decreased grain yield |  Consistently, blocking miR1432 or overexpression of OsEFH1 improves chitin-triggered immunity responses
