NA	CURLED LATER1 encoding the largest subunit of the Elongator complex has a unique role in leaf development and meristem function in rice	2020	Plant Journal	School of Science, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo ku, Tokyo, 113 8654 Japan	The Elongator complex, which is conserved in eukaryotes, has multiple roles in diverse organisms. In Arabidopsis thaliana , Elongator is shown to be involved in development, hormone action and environmental responses. However, except for Arabidopsis, our knowledge of its function is poor in plants. In this study, we initially carried out a genetic analysis to characterize a rice mutant with narrow and curled leaves, termed curled later1 (cur1 ). The cur1 mutant displayed a heteroblastic change, whereby the mutant leaf phenotype appeared specifically at a later adult phase of vegetative development. The shoot apical meristem (SAM) was small and the leaf initiation rate was low, suggesting that the activity of the SAM seemed to be partially reduced in cur1 . We then revealed that CUR1 encodes a yeast ELP1 like protein, the largest subunit of Elongator. Furthermore, disruption of OsELP3 encoding the catalytic subunit of Elongator resulted in phenotypes similar to those of cur1 , including the timing of the appearance of mutant phenotypes. Thus, Elongator activity seems to be specifically required for leaf development at the late vegetative phase. Transcriptome analysis showed that genes involved in protein quality control were highly upregulated in the cur1 shoot apex at the later vegetative phase, suggesting the restoration of impaired proteins probably produced by partial defects in translational control due to the loss of function of Elongator. The differences in the mutant phenotype and gene expression profile between CUR1 and its Arabidopsis ortholog suggest that Elongator has evolved to play a unique role in rice development.
NA	OsEDM2L mediates m 6 A of EAT1 transcript for proper alternative splicing and polyadenylation regulating rice tapetal degradation	2021	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	N6 -methyladenosine (m6 A) modification affects the post-transcriptional regulation of eukaryotic gene expression, but the underlying mechanisms and their effects in plants remain largely unknown. Here, we report that the N6 -adenine methyltransferase-like (MTL) domain-containing protein ENHANCED DOWNY MILDEW 2-LIKE (OsEDM2L) is essential for rice (Oryza sativa L.) anther development. The osedm2l knockout mutant showed delayed tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) and defective pollen development. OsEDM2L interacts with the transcription factors bHLH142 and TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION to regulate the expression of ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 (EAT1), a positive regulator of tapetal PCD. Mutation of OsEDM2L altered the transcriptomic m6 A landscape, and caused a distinct m6 A modification of the EAT1 transcript leading to dysregulation of its alternative splicing and polyadenylation, followed by suppression of the EAT1 target genes OsAP25 and OsAP37 for tapetal PCD. Therefore, OsEDM2L is indispensable for proper mRNA m6 A modification in rice anther development.
