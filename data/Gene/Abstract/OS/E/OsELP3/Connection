CUR1	OsELP3	CURLED LATER1 encoding the largest subunit of the Elongator complex has a unique role in leaf development and meristem function in rice.	 Furthermore, disruption of OsELP3 encoding the catalytic subunit of Elongator resulted in phenotypes similar to those of cur1, including the timing of the appearance of mutant phenotypes
