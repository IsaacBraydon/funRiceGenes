NA	CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis of OsERA1 confers enhanced responses to abscisic acid and drought stress and increased primary root growth under nonstressed conditions in rice	2021	PLoS One	Biological Resources and Post-harvest Division, Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences (JIRCAS), Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	Abscisic acid (ABA) signaling components play an important role in the drought stress response in plants. Arabidopsis thaliana ENHANCED RESPONSE TO ABA1 (ERA1) encodes the ¦Â-subunit of farnesyltransferase and regulates ABA signaling and the dehydration response. Therefore, ERA1 is an important candidate gene for enhancing drought tolerance in numerous crops. However, a rice (Oryza sativa) ERA1 homolog has not been characterized previously. Here, we show that rice osera1 mutant lines, harboring CRISPR/Cas9-induced frameshift mutations, exhibit similar leaf growth as control plants but increased primary root growth. The osera1 mutant lines also display increased sensitivity to ABA and an enhanced response to drought stress through stomatal regulation. These results illustrate that OsERA1 is a negative regulator of primary root growth under nonstressed conditions and also of responses to ABA and drought stress in rice. These findings improve our understanding of the role of ABA signaling in the drought stress response in rice and suggest a strategy to genetically improve rice.
