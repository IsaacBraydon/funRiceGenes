OsEPFL2	development	Small EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE2 peptides regulate awn development in rice.	 OsEPFL2 is strongly expressed in the young panicle, consistent with a role in regulating awn and grain development
OsEPFL2	grain	Small EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE2 peptides regulate awn development in rice.	 Loss of function of most OsEPF/EPFL genes generated no obvious phenotype alteration, whilst disruption of OsEPFL2 in Kasalath caused a short or no awn phenotype and reduced grain size
OsEPFL2	grain	Small EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE2 peptides regulate awn development in rice.	 OsEPFL2 is strongly expressed in the young panicle, consistent with a role in regulating awn and grain development
OsEPFL2	grain size	Small EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE2 peptides regulate awn development in rice.	 Loss of function of most OsEPF/EPFL genes generated no obvious phenotype alteration, whilst disruption of OsEPFL2 in Kasalath caused a short or no awn phenotype and reduced grain size
OsEPFL2	domestication	Small EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE2 peptides regulate awn development in rice.	 Nucleotide diversity and genetic differentiation analyses suggested that OsEPFL2 was positively selected during the domestication of rice
OsEPFL2	awn	Small EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE2 peptides regulate awn development in rice.	 Loss of function of most OsEPF/EPFL genes generated no obvious phenotype alteration, whilst disruption of OsEPFL2 in Kasalath caused a short or no awn phenotype and reduced grain size
OsEPFL2	awn	Small EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE2 peptides regulate awn development in rice.	 OsEPFL2 is strongly expressed in the young panicle, consistent with a role in regulating awn and grain development
