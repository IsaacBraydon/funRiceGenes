High salinity causes remarkable losses in rice productivity worldwide mainly because it inhibits growth and reduces grain yield. To cope with environmental changes, plants evolved several adaptive mechanisms, which involve the regulation of many stress-responsive genes. Among these, we have chosen OsRMC to study its transcriptional regulation in rice seedlings subjected to high salinity. Its transcription was highly induced by salt treatment and showed a stress-dose-dependent pattern. OsRMC encodes a receptor-like kinase described as a negative regulator of salt stress responses in rice. To investigate how OsRMC is regulated in response to high salinity, a salt-induced rice cDNA expression library was constructed and subsequently screened using the yeast one-hybrid system and the OsRMC promoter as bait. Thereby, two transcription factors (TFs), OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2, belonging to the AP2/ERF family were identified. Both TFs were shown to bind to the same GCC-like DNA motif in OsRMC promoter and to negatively regulate its gene expression. The identified TFs were characterized regarding their gene expression under different abiotic stress conditions. This study revealed that OsEREBP1 transcript level is not significantly affected by salt, ABA or severe cold (5 degrees C) and is only slightly regulated by drought and moderate cold. On the other hand, the OsEREBP2 transcript level increased after cold, ABA, drought and high salinity treatments, indicating that OsEREBP2 may play a central role mediating the response to different abiotic stresses. Gene expression analysis in rice varieties with contrasting salt tolerance further suggests that OsEREBP2 is involved in salt stress response in rice.

Since the OsEREBP1-like gene EBL1 (OsEREBP1-LIKE 1) was significantly downregulated in phyAphyBphyC mutants, EBL1 was suspected to repress ACO1 expression in wild-type plants. However, ACO1 was downregulated in EBL1 RNA interference plants, and the total length of these plants was slightly shorter than that of wild-type plants. This study shows that EBL1 is positively regulated by phytochrome B and associated with ACO1 upregulation.
1321961.pdf	BWMK1, a Rice Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, Locates in the Nucleus and Mediates Pathogenesis-Related Gene Expression by Activation of a Transcription Factor	2003	Plant Physiol	Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 Program), Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 660-701, Korea.	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are known to transduce plant defense signals, but the downstream components of the MAPK have as yet not been elucidated. Here, we report an MAPK from rice (Oryza sativa), BWMK1, and a transcription factor, OsEREBP1, phosphorylated by the kinase. The MAPK carries a TDY phosphorylation motif instead of the more common TEY motif in its kinase domain and has an unusually extended C-terminal domain that is essential to its kinase activity and translocation to the nucleus. The MAPK phosphorylates OsEREBP1 that binds to the GCC box element (AGCCGCC) of the several basic pathogenesis-related gene promoters, which in turn enhances DNA-binding activity of the factor to the cis element in vitro. Transient co-expression of the BWMK1 and OsEREBP1 in Arabidopsis protoplasts elevates the expression of the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene driven by the GCC box element. Furthermore, transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants overexpressing BWMK1 expressed many pathogenesis-related genes at higher levels than wild-type plants with an enhanced resistance to pathogens. These findings suggest that MAPKs contribute to plant defense signal transduction by phosphorylating one or more transcription factors.
