High salinity causes remarkable losses in rice productivity worldwide mainly because it inhibits growth and reduces grain yield. To cope with environmental changes, plants evolved several adaptive mechanisms, which involve the regulation of many stress-responsive genes. Among these, we have chosen OsRMC to study its transcriptional regulation in rice seedlings subjected to high salinity. Its transcription was highly induced by salt treatment and showed a stress-dose-dependent pattern. OsRMC encodes a receptor-like kinase described as a negative regulator of salt stress responses in rice. To investigate how OsRMC is regulated in response to high salinity, a salt-induced rice cDNA expression library was constructed and subsequently screened using the yeast one-hybrid system and the OsRMC promoter as bait. Thereby, two transcription factors (TFs), OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2, belonging to the AP2/ERF family were identified. Both TFs were shown to bind to the same GCC-like DNA motif in OsRMC promoter and to negatively regulate its gene expression. The identified TFs were characterized regarding their gene expression under different abiotic stress conditions. This study revealed that OsEREBP1 transcript level is not significantly affected by salt, ABA or severe cold (5 degrees C) and is only slightly regulated by drought and moderate cold. On the other hand, the OsEREBP2 transcript level increased after cold, ABA, drought and high salinity treatments, indicating that OsEREBP2 may play a central role mediating the response to different abiotic stresses. Gene expression analysis in rice varieties with contrasting salt tolerance further suggests that OsEREBP2 is involved in salt stress response in rice.
10529_2010_Article_405.pdf	Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice	2011	Biotechnol Lett	Division of Plant Sciences, Photobiology and Photosynthesis Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602, Japan. iwamas@nias.affrc.go.jp	The 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase gene (ACO1) was upregulated in rice (Oryza sativa L.) phyAphyBphyC mutants lacking any phytochrome and containing the GCC box element, a binding site for rice ethylene-responsive element binding protein 1 (OsEREBP1), in its promoter region. Since the OsEREBP1-like gene EBL1 (OsEREBP1-LIKE 1) was significantly downregulated in phyAphyBphyC mutants, EBL1 was suspected to repress ACO1 expression in wild-type plants. However, ACO1 was downregulated in EBL1 RNA interference plants, and the total length of these plants was slightly shorter than that of wild-type plants. This study shows that EBL1 is positively regulated by phytochrome B and associated with ACO1 upregulation.
1321961.pdf	BWMK1, a Rice Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, Locates in the Nucleus and Mediates Pathogenesis-Related Gene Expression by Activation of a Transcription Factor	2003	Plant Physiol	Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 Program), Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 660-701, Korea.	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are known to transduce plant defense signals, but the downstream components of the MAPK have as yet not been elucidated. Here, we report an MAPK from rice (Oryza sativa), BWMK1, and a transcription factor, OsEREBP1, phosphorylated by the kinase. The MAPK carries a TDY phosphorylation motif instead of the more common TEY motif in its kinase domain and has an unusually extended C-terminal domain that is essential to its kinase activity and translocation to the nucleus. The MAPK phosphorylates OsEREBP1 that binds to the GCC box element (AGCCGCC) of the several basic pathogenesis-related gene promoters, which in turn enhances DNA-binding activity of the factor to the cis element in vitro. Transient co-expression of the BWMK1 and OsEREBP1 in Arabidopsis protoplasts elevates the expression of the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene driven by the GCC box element. Furthermore, transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants overexpressing BWMK1 expressed many pathogenesis-related genes at higher levels than wild-type plants with an enhanced resistance to pathogens. These findings suggest that MAPKs contribute to plant defense signal transduction by phosphorylating one or more transcription factors.
NA	Overexpression of an AP2/ERF Type Transcription Factor OsEREBP1 Confers Biotic and Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Rice.	2015	PLoS One	Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, India.	AP2/ERF-type transcription factors regulate important functions of plant growth and development as well as responses to environmental stimuli. A rice AP2/ERF transcription factor, OsEREBP1 is a downstream component of a signal transduction pathway in a specific interaction between rice (Oryza sativa) and its bacterial pathogen, Xoo (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae). Constitutive expression of OsEREBP1 in rice driven by maize ubiquitin promoter did not affect normal plant growth. Microarray analysis revealed that over expression of OsEREBP1 caused increased expression of lipid metabolism related genes such as lipase and chloroplastic lipoxygenase as well as several genes related to jasmonate and abscisic acid biosynthesis. PR genes, transcription regulators and Aldhs (alcohol dehydrogenases) implicated in abiotic stress and submergence tolerance were also upregulated in transgenic plants. Transgenic plants showed increase in endogenous levels of Î±-linolenate, several jasmonate derivatives and abscisic acid but not salicylic acid. Soluble modified GFP (SmGFP)-tagged OsEREBP1 was localized to plastid nucleoids. Comparative analysis of non-transgenic and OsEREBP1 overexpressing genotypes revealed that OsEREBP1 attenuates disease caused by Xoo and confers drought and submergence tolerance in transgenic rice. Our results suggest that constitutive expression of OsEREBP1 activates the jasmonate and abscisic acid signalling pathways thereby priming the rice plants for enhanced survival under abiotic or biotic stress conditions. OsEREBP1 is thus, a good candidate gene for engineering plants for multiple stress tolerance.
NA	Gene Expression Dynamics in Rice Peduncles at the Heading Stage	2020	Front Genet	Grass Genetics and Informatics Group, School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.	Improving grain yield in the staple food crop rice has been long sought goal of plant biotechnology. One of the traits with significant impact on rice breeding programs is peduncle elongation at the time of heading failing which leads to significant reduction in grain yield due to incomplete panicle exsertion. To decipher transcriptional dynamics and molecular players underlying peduncle elongation, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of elongating and non-elongating peduncles in two Indian cultivars, Swarna and Pokkali, at the time of heading. Along with genes associated with cell division and cell wall biosynthesis, we observed significant enrichment of genes associated with auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis/signaling in the elongating peduncles before heading in both the genotypes. Similarly, genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and mobilization, abiotic stress response along with cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene biosynthesis/signaling were enriched in non-elongating peduncles post heading. Significant enrichment of genes belonging to key transcription factor families highlights their specialized roles in peduncle elongation and grain filling before and after heading, respectively. A comparison with anther/pollen development-related genes provided 76 candidates with overlapping roles in anther/pollen development and peduncle elongation. Some of these are important for carbohydrate remobilization to the developing grains. These can be engineered to combat with incomplete panicle exsertion in male sterile lines and manipulate carbohydrate dynamics in grasses. Overall, this study provides baseline information about potential target genes for engineering peduncle elongation with implications on plant height, biomass composition and grain yields in rice.
