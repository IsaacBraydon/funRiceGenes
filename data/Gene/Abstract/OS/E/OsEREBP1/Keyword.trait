OsEREBP1	transcription factor	BWMK1, a Rice Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, Locates in the Nucleus and Mediates Pathogenesis-Related Gene Expression by Activation of a Transcription Factor	 Here, we report an MAPK from rice (Oryza sativa), BWMK1, and a transcription factor, OsEREBP1, phosphorylated by the kinase
OsEREBP1	salt	"OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"	" This study revealed that OsEREBP1 transcript level is not significantly affected by salt, ABA or severe cold (5 degrees C) and is only slightly regulated by drought and moderate cold"
OsEREBP1	drought	"OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"	" This study revealed that OsEREBP1 transcript level is not significantly affected by salt, ABA or severe cold (5 degrees C) and is only slightly regulated by drought and moderate cold"
OsEREBP1	ethylene	Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice	) phyAphyBphyC mutants lacking any phytochrome and containing the GCC box element, a binding site for rice ethylene-responsive element binding protein 1 (OsEREBP1), in its promoter region
OsEREBP1	transcription factor	OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors	 Thereby, two transcription factors (TFs), OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2, belonging to the AP2/ERF family were identified
OsEREBP1	 ABA 	OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors	 This study revealed that OsEREBP1 transcript level is not significantly affected by salt, ABA or severe cold (5 degrees C) and is only slightly regulated by drought and moderate cold
