OsEREBP1	OsEREBP2|ERF99	OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors	 Thereby, two transcription factors (TFs), OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2, belonging to the AP2/ERF family were identified
OsACO1	OsEREBP1	Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice	 Since the OsEREBP1-like gene EBL1 (OsEREBP1-LIKE 1) was significantly downregulated in phyAphyBphyC mutants, EBL1 was suspected to repress ACO1 expression in wild-type plants
EBL1	OsEREBP1	Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice	 Since the OsEREBP1-like gene EBL1 (OsEREBP1-LIKE 1) was significantly downregulated in phyAphyBphyC mutants, EBL1 was suspected to repress ACO1 expression in wild-type plants
OsEREBP1	OsWJUMK1|OsMPK12|OsBWMK1	BWMK1, a Rice Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, Locates in the Nucleus and Mediates Pathogenesis-Related Gene Expression by Activation of a Transcription Factor	 Here, we report an MAPK from rice (Oryza sativa), BWMK1, and a transcription factor, OsEREBP1, phosphorylated by the kinase| Transient co-expression of the BWMK1 and OsEREBP1 in Arabidopsis protoplasts elevates the expression of the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene driven by the GCC box element
