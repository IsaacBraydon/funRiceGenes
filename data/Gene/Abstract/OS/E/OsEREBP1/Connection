OsEREBP1	OsEREBP2|ERF99	OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors	 Thereby, two transcription factors (TFs), OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2, belonging to the AP2/ERF family were identified
OsACO1	OsEREBP1	Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice	 Since the OsEREBP1-like gene EBL1 (OsEREBP1-LIKE 1) was significantly downregulated in phyAphyBphyC mutants, EBL1 was suspected to repress ACO1 expression in wild-type plants
EBL1	OsEREBP1	Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice	 Since the OsEREBP1-like gene EBL1 (OsEREBP1-LIKE 1) was significantly downregulated in phyAphyBphyC mutants, EBL1 was suspected to repress ACO1 expression in wild-type plants
OsEREBP1	OsWJUMK1|OsMPK12|OsBWMK1	BWMK1, a Rice Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, Locates in the Nucleus and Mediates Pathogenesis-Related Gene Expression by Activation of a Transcription Factor	 Here, we report an MAPK from rice (Oryza sativa), BWMK1, and a transcription factor, OsEREBP1, phosphorylated by the kinase
OsEREBP1	OsWJUMK1|OsMPK12|OsBWMK1	BWMK1, a Rice Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, Locates in the Nucleus and Mediates Pathogenesis-Related Gene Expression by Activation of a Transcription Factor	 Transient co-expression of the BWMK1 and OsEREBP1 in Arabidopsis protoplasts elevates the expression of the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene driven by the GCC box element
OsEREBP1	OsHOS1	The rice E3 ubiquitin ligase OsHOS1 modulates the expression of OsRMC, a gene involved in root mechano-sensing, through the interaction with two ERF transcription factors.	 Using the yeast two-hybrid system and BiFC assays we showed that OsHOS1 interacts with two ERF transcription factors (TFs), OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2, known to regulate OsRMC gene expression
OsEREBP1	OsHOS1	The rice E3 ubiquitin ligase OsHOS1 modulates the expression of OsRMC, a gene involved in root mechano-sensing, through the interaction with two ERF transcription factors.	 In addition, we showed that OsHOS1 affects the stability of both TFs in a proteasome dependent way, suggesting that this E3-ubiquitin ligase targets OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2 for degradation
