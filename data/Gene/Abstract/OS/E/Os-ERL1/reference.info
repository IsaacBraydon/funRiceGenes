1-s2.0-S0378111905004130-main.pdf	Identification and characterization of a novel water-deficit-suppressed gene OsARD encoding an aci-reductone-dioxygenase-like protein in rice	2005	Gene	The State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310029, PR China.	The aci-reductone dioxygenase (ARD) family common to bacteria, plants and animals is involved in the methionine salvage pathway. A water-deficit-suppressed gene, OsARD encoding an aci-reductone-dioxygenase-like protein, was identified from rice (Oryza sativa L.). Northern blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that the OsARD expression is regulated by abiotic stresses and phytohormones. OsARD was mainly expressed in roots under flood conditions. It was suppressed by abiotic stresses including water deficit, high salinity and low temperature, and induced by ethylene and gibberellin acid (GA). Our results showed that the genes for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthase and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase were upregulated in RNA-interference (RNAi) transgenic rice plants with a significant reduction of OsARD expression. Furthermore, the expression of two genes for ethylene signal transduction, ETR2 and EIN3, increased in these RNAi transgenic plants, whereas the expression of ERF3 was suppressed. These results suggest that OsARD may play a role in the metabolism of methionine and ethylene in response to abiotic stresses.
J. Exp. Bot.-2004-Watanabe-1145-8.pdf	Cloning of a cDNA encoding an ETR2-like protein (Os-ERL1) from deep water rice (Oryza sativa L.) and increase in its mRNA level by submergence, ethylene, and gibberellin treatments	2004	J Exp Bot	Division of Biological Resource Science, Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Kawatabi, Naruko Miyagi 989-6711, Japan. watanabe@bios.tohoku.ac.jp	A cDNA from deep water rice treated with ethylene, encoding an ethylene receptor homologous to Arabidopsis thaliana ETR2 and EIN4, was isolated using differential display and RACE techniques. The cDNA (2880 bp), corresponding to the Os-ERL1 gene (Oryza sativa ETHYLENE RESPONSE 2 like 1; GenBank accession number AB107219), contained an open reading frame of 2289 bp coding for 763 amino acids. The protein Os-ERL1 has 50% and 52% similarity to Arabidopsis ETR2 and EIN4, respectively. The Os-ERL1 gene was up-regulated by flooding, and by treatment with ethylene and gibberellin. These results suggest that deep water rice responds to flooding by increasing the number of its ethylene receptors.
Plant Cell-2009-Wuriyanghan-1473-94.pdf	The ethylene receptor ETR2 delays floral transition and affects starch accumulation in rice	2009	Plant Cell	Plant Gene Research Center, National Key Lab of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Ethylene regulates multiple aspects of plant growth and development in dicotyledonous plants; however, its roles in monocotyledonous plants are poorly known. Here, we characterized a subfamily II ethylene receptor, ETHYLENE RESPONSE2 (ETR2), in rice (Oryza sativa). The ETR2 receptor with a diverged His kinase domain is a Ser/Thr kinase, but not a His kinase, and can phosphorylate its receiver domain. Mutation of the N box of the kinase domain abolished the kinase activity of ETR2. Overexpression of ETR2 in transgenic rice plants reduced ethylene sensitivity and delayed floral transition. Conversely, RNA interference (RNAi) plants exhibited early flowering and the ETR2 T-DNA insertion mutant etr2 showed enhanced ethylene sensitivity and early flowering. The effective panicles and seed-setting rate were reduced in the ETR2-overexpressing plants, while thousand-seed weight was substantially enhanced in both the ETR2-RNAi plants and the etr2 mutant compared with controls. Starch granules accumulated in the internodes of the ETR2-overexpressing plants, but not in the etr2 mutant. The GIGANTEA and TERMINAL FLOWER1/CENTRORADIALIS homolog (RCN1) that cause delayed flowering were upregulated in ETR2-overexpressing plants but downregulated in the etr2 mutant. Conversely, the alpha-amylase gene RAmy3D was suppressed in ETR2-overexpressing plants but enhanced in the etr2 mutant. Thus, ETR2 may delay flowering and cause starch accumulation in stems by regulating downstream genes.
NA	The Differentiated Localized Rice Ethylene Receptors OsERS1 and OsETR2 and their Potential Role during Submergence.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	b Institute of Plant and Microbial Biology, Academia Sinica , Taipei , Taiwan, R.O.C.	Ethylene is gaseous plant hormone that controls a variety of physiological activities. OsERS1 and OsETR2 are major ethylene receptors in rice that have been reported to have different regulatory functions. The GFP fused N-terminus of OsERS1 and OsETR2 showed differentially localization patterns when transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells. Base on the results, we suggested that OsERS1 could be localized to plasma membranes, whereas OsETR2 could be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, instead of the constitutive expression profile of OsERS1, OsETR2 is differentially expressed in seedlings of light/dark-grown conditions, submergence or exogenous ethylene treatments. Our results and others support the notion that OsERS1 and OsETR2 could have different roles during rice plant submergence.
