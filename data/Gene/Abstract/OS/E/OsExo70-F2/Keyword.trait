OsExo70-F2|OsExo70F2	resistance	Rice Exo70 interacts with a fungal effector, AVR-Pii, and is required for AVR-Pii-triggered immunity.	Simultaneous knockdown of OsExo70-F2 and F3 totally abrogated Pii immune receptor-dependent resistance, but had no effect on Pia- and Pik-dependent resistance
OsExo70-F2|OsExo70F2	resistance	Rice Exo70 interacts with a fungal effector, AVR-Pii, and is required for AVR-Pii-triggered immunity.	Knockdown levels of OsExo70-F3 but not OsExo70-F2 correlated with reduction of Pii function, suggesting that OsExo70-F3 is specifically involved in Pii-dependent resistance
OsExo70-F2|OsExo70F2	blast	A blast fungus zinc-finger fold effector binds to a hydrophobic pocket in host Exo70 proteins to modulate immune recognition in rice.	 Here, we show the molecular basis of the association between the effector AVR-Pii of the blast fungus Maganaporthe oryzae and rice Exo70 alleles OsExo70F2 and OsExo70F3, which is sensed by the immune receptor pair Pii via an integrated RIN4/NOI domain
