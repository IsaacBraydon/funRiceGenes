OsEm|EMP1|OsEm1	Overexpression of OsEm1 encoding a group I LEA protein confers enhanced drought tolerance in rice. |  Overexpression of OsEm1 increases ABA sensitivity and enhances osmotic tolerance in rice |  Compared with wild type, the OsEm1-overexpressing rice plants showed enhanced plant survival ratio at the vegetative stage; moreover, over expression of OsEm1 in rice increased the expression of other LEA genes, including RAB16A, RAB16C, RAB21, and LEA3, likely protecting organ integrity against harsh environments	Overexpression of OsEm1 encoding a group I LEA protein confers enhanced drought tolerance in rice. |  Overexpression of OsEm1 increases ABA sensitivity and enhances osmotic tolerance in rice
