OsEGL2	panicle	Expression of an endo-(1,3;1,4)-beta-glucanase in response to wounding, methyl jasmonate, abscisic acid and ethephon in rice seedlings	 Little or no expression of the OsEGL2 gene was observed in all tissues or treatments tested, but database and RT-PCR analysis indicated it is expressed in ripening panicle
OsEGL2	cellulose	Expression of an endo-(1,3;1,4)-beta-glucanase in response to wounding, methyl jasmonate, abscisic acid and ethephon in rice seedlings	 Purified OsEGL1 and OsEGL2 proteins hydrolyzed (1,3;1,4)-beta-glucans, but not (1,3;1,6)-beta-linked or (1,3)-beta-linked glucopolysaccharides nor carboxymethyl cellulose, similar to previously characterized grass endo-(1,3;1,4)-beta-glucanases
