OsAPX1|APXa	OsEBP-89|OsEBP89	An APETALA2/ethylene responsive factor, OsEBP89 knockout enhances adaptation to direct-seeding on wet land and tolerance to drought stress in rice.	 Transcriptome data indicates that knockout of OsEBP89 improved the expression of specific genes in response to adverse factors, such as OsAPX1, OsHsfA3, and OsP5CS
