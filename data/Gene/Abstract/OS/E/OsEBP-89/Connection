OsAPX1|APXa	OsEBP-89|OsEBP89	An APETALA2/ethylene responsive factor, OsEBP89 knockout enhances adaptation to direct-seeding on wet land and tolerance to drought stress in rice.	 Transcriptome data indicates that knockout of OsEBP89 improved the expression of specific genes in response to adverse factors, such as OsAPX1, OsHsfA3, and OsP5CS
OsEBP-89|OsEBP89	OsHSFA3	An APETALA2/ethylene responsive factor, OsEBP89 knockout enhances adaptation to direct-seeding on wet land and tolerance to drought stress in rice.	 Transcriptome data indicates that knockout of OsEBP89 improved the expression of specific genes in response to adverse factors, such as OsAPX1, OsHsfA3, and OsP5CS
OsEBP-89|OsEBP89	OsP5CS|OsP5CS1	An APETALA2/ethylene responsive factor, OsEBP89 knockout enhances adaptation to direct-seeding on wet land and tolerance to drought stress in rice.	 Transcriptome data indicates that knockout of OsEBP89 improved the expression of specific genes in response to adverse factors, such as OsAPX1, OsHsfA3, and OsP5CS
OsEBP-89|OsEBP89	qTGW3|TGW3|GL3.3|OsGSK5|OsSK41	The kinase OsSK41/OsGSK5 negatively regulates amylose content in rice endosperm by affecting the interaction between OsEBP89 and OsBP5.	 Here, we determined that the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 5 (OsGSK5, also named SHAGGY-like kinase 41 [OsSK41]) inhibits the transcriptional activation activity of OsEBP89 in rice grains during amylose biosynthesis
