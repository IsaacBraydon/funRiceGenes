OsEPF1	 To understand their possible involvement in stomatal formation, in this study we generated a series of transgenic lines including reporter promoter fusions, down-regulation and overexpression and demonstrated drastic differences in stomatal densities between different genotypes, as elevated expression of OsEPF1 or OsEPF2 greatly reduced stomatal density in rice, whereas ectopic overexpression of either OsEPF1 or OsEPF2 significantly decreased the high stomatal frequency of both mutant lines of epf2 and epf1epf2 Arabidopsis	 To understand their possible involvement in stomatal formation, in this study we generated a series of transgenic lines including reporter promoter fusions, down-regulation and overexpression and demonstrated drastic differences in stomatal densities between different genotypes, as elevated expression of OsEPF1 or OsEPF2 greatly reduced stomatal density in rice, whereas ectopic overexpression of either OsEPF1 or OsEPF2 significantly decreased the high stomatal frequency of both mutant lines of epf2 and epf1epf2 Arabidopsis
OsEPF1	 We reveal that in the bract-like organs, stomatal development follows the same cell lineage transitions as in rice leaves and demonstrate that the overexpression of the stomatal development regulators OsEPFL9-1 and OsEPF1 leads to dramatic changes in stomatal density in rice floral organs, producing lemma with approximately twice as many stomata (OsEPFL9-1_oe) or lemma where stomata are practically absent (OsEPF1_oe) |  Finally, although we were unable to detect an impact on plant reproduction linked to changes in the density of floral stomata, we report alterations in global gene expression in lines overexpressing OsEPF1 and discuss how our results reflect on the possible role(s) of floral stomata	 We reveal that in the bract-like organs, stomatal development follows the same cell lineage transitions as in rice leaves and demonstrate that the overexpression of the stomatal development regulators OsEPFL9-1 and OsEPF1 leads to dramatic changes in stomatal density in rice floral organs, producing lemma with approximately twice as many stomata (OsEPFL9-1_oe) or lemma where stomata are practically absent (OsEPF1_oe)
