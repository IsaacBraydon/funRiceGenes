NA	Rice with reduced stomatal density conserves water and has improved drought tolerance under future climate conditions.	2018	New Phytol	Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, S10 2TN, UK.	Much of humanity relies on rice (Oryza sativa) as a food source, but cultivation is water intensive and the crop is vulnerable to drought and high temperatures. Under climate change, periods of reduced water availability and high temperature are expected to become more frequent, leading to detrimental effects on rice yields. We engineered the high-yielding rice cultivar 'IR64' to produce fewer stomata by manipulating the level of a developmental signal. We overexpressed the rice epidermal patterning factor OsEPF1, creating plants with substantially reduced stomatal density and correspondingly low stomatal conductance. Low stomatal density rice lines were more able to conserve water, using c. 60% of the normal amount between weeks 4 and 5 post germination. When grown at elevated atmospheric CO2 , rice plants with low stomatal density were able to maintain their stomatal conductance and survive drought and high temperature (40°„C) for longer than control plants. Low stomatal density rice gave equivalent or even improved yields, despite a reduced rate of photosynthesis in some conditions. Rice plants with fewer stomata are drought tolerant and more conservative in their water use, and they should perform better in the future when climate change is expected to threaten food security.
NA	Homologous genes of epidermal patterning factor regulate stomatal development in rice.	2019	J Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Department of Plant Science, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China.	Stomata are microscopic pores on the surface of leaves through which water as vapor passes to the atmosphere and CO2 uptake for the photosynthesis. The signaling peptides of the epidermal patterning factor (EPF) family regulate stomatal development and density in Arabidopsis. Several putative homologs of EPF/EPFL exist in rice genome. To understand their possible involvement in stomatal formation, in this study we generated a series of transgenic lines including reporter promoter fusions, down-regulation and overexpression and demonstrated drastic differences in stomatal densities between different genotypes, as elevated expression of OsEPF1 or OsEPF2 greatly reduced stomatal density in rice, whereas ectopic overexpression of either OsEPF1 or OsEPF2 significantly decreased the high stomatal frequency of both mutant lines of epf2 and epf1epf2 Arabidopsis. Conversely, knocking down OsEPFL9 transcription conferred transgenic plants with fewer stomata than WT in rice, whereas overexpressing rice OsEPFL9 gene could cause excessive production of stomata in Arabidopsis. In conclusion, homologs of EPF/EPFL regulate stomatal development in a generally highly conserved way yet there exist function distinctions between dicot and monocot plants.
NA	Rice plants overexpressing OsEPF1 show reduced stomatal density and increased root cortical aerenchyma formation.	2019	Sci Rep	Division of Plant and Crop Science, School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington campus, LE12 5RD, Nottingham, UK.	Stomata are adjustable pores in the aerial epidermis of plants. The role of stomata is usually described in terms of the trade-off between CO2 uptake and water loss. Little consideration has been given to their interaction with below-ground development or diffusion of other gases. We overexpressed the rice EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR1 (OsEPF1) to produce rice plants with reduced stomatal densities, resulting in lowered leaf stomatal conductance and enhanced water use efficiency. Surprisingly, we found that root cortical aerenchyma (RCA) is formed constitutively in OsEPF1OE lines regardless of tissue age and position. Aerenchyma is tissue containing air-spaces that can develop in the plant root during stressful conditions, e.g. oxygen deficiency when it functions to increase O2 diffusion from shoot to root. The relationship with stomata is unknown. We conclude that RCA development and stomatal development are linked by two possible mechanisms: first that reduced stomatal conductance inhibits the diffusion of oxygen to the root, creating an oxygen deficit and stimulating the formation of RCA, second that an unknown EPF signalling pathway may be involved. Our observations have fundamental implications for the understanding of whole plant gas diffusion and root-to-shoot signalling events.
