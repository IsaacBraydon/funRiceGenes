NA	The OsERF115/AP2EREBP110 Transcription Factor Is Involved in the Multiple Stress Tolerance to Heat and Drought in Rice Plants	2021	Int J Mol Sci	Gene Engineering Division, National Institute of Agricultural Sciences, RDA, Jeonju 54874, Korea.	The AP2/EREBP family transcription factors play important roles in a wide range of stress tolerance and hormone signaling. In this study, a heat-inducible rice ERF gene was isolated and functionally characterized. The OsERF115/AP2EREBP110 was categorized to Group-IIIc of the rice AP2/EREBP family and strongly induced by heat and drought treatment. The OsERF115/AP2EREBP110 protein targeted to nuclei and suppressed the ABA-induced transcriptional activation of Rab16A promoter in rice protoplasts. Overexpression of OsERF115/AP2EREBP110 enhanced thermotolerance of seeds and vegetative growth stage plants. The OsERF115/AP2EREBP110 overexpressing (OE) plants exhibited higher proline level and increased expression of a proline biosynthesis P5CS1 gene. Phenotyping of water use dynamics of the individual plant indicates that the OsERF115/AP2EREBP110-OE plant exhibited better water saving traits under heat and drought combined stress. Our combined results suggest the potential use of OsERF115/AP2EREBP110 as a candidate gene for genetic engineering approaches to develop heat and drought stress-tolerant crops.
NA	The OsEIL1-OsERF115-target gene regulatory module controls grain size and weight in rice.	2022	Plant Biotechnol J	Shunde Graduate School, Research Center of Biology and Agriculture, Zhongzhi International Institute of Agricultural Biosciences, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China.	Grain size is one of the essential determinants of rice yield. Our previous studies revealed that ethylene plays an important role in grain-size control; however, the precise mechanism remains to be determined. Here, we report that the ethylene response factor OsERF115 functions as a key downstream regulator for ethylene-mediated grain development. OsERF115 encodes an AP2/ERF-type transcriptional factor that is specifically expressed in young spikelets and developing caryopses. Overexpression of OsERF115 significantly increases grain length, width, thickness and weight by promoting longitudinal elongation and transverse division of spikelet hull cells, as well as enhancing grain-filling activity, whereas its knockout mutations lead to the opposite effects, suggesting that OsERF115 positively regulates grain size and weight. OsERF115 transcription is strongly induced by ethylene, and OsEIL1 directly binds to the promoter to activate its expression. OsERF115 acts as a transcriptional repressor to directly or indirectly modulate a set of grain-size genes during spikelet growth and endosperm development. Importantly, haplotype analysis reveals that the SNP variations in the EIN3-binding sites of OsERF115 promoter are significantly associated with the OsERF115 expression levels and grain weight, suggesting that natural variations in the OsERF115 promoter contribute to grain-size diversity. In addition, the OsERF115 orthologues are identified only in grass species, implying a conserved and unique role in the grain development of cereal crops. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanism of ethylene-mediated grain-size control and a potential strategy based on the OsEIL1-OsERF115-target gene regulatory module for genetic improvement of rice yield.
