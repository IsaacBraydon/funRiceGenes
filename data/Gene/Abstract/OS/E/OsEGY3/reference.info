NA	The OsABF1 transcription factor improves drought tolerance by activating the transcription of COR413-TM1 in rice.	2017	J Exp Bot	Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Water deprivation causes substantial losses in crop yields around the world. In this study, we show that when overexpressed in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa), the bZIP transcription factor OsABF1 confers distinctly different drought-tolerance phenotypes when tethered to the transcriptional activator VP16 versus the transcriptional repressor EAR. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) assays on transgenic rice lines and determined that OsABF1 binds to DNA sequences containing an ACGT core motif. Analysis of the overlap between the RNA-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing data identified 242 OsABF1 target genes involved in multiple aspects of the drought response. Overexpression of one of these genes, COR413-TM1, which encodes a putative thylakoid membrane protein, resulted in a drought-tolerance phenotype without obvious side effects. In addition, OsABF1 directly regulates the expression of the protein phosphatase 2C (OsPP48 and OsPP108) and bZIP (OsbZIP23, OsbZIP46, and OsbZIP72) genes, thus forming a complex feedback circuit in the drought/abscisic acid signaling pathway.
