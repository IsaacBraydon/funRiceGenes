Drought is one of the most serious stresses affecting rice growth. Drought stress causes accelerated senescence, reduced fertility, and subsequent reductions in crop yield. Eukaryotic translation elongation factor EF1A is an important multifunctional protein that plays an essential role in the translation of eukaryotic proteins. In this study, we localized and cloned the OsEF1A gene in rice (Oryza sativa) in order to clarify its role in drought tolerance and yield. Subcellular localization revealed that it was mainly localized to the cell membrane, cytoskeleton and nucleus. Compared with the wild-type, OsEF1A overexpressing transgenic plants had significantly more tillers and grains per plant, resulting in a significantly higher yield. Increases in the relative water content and proline content were also observed in the transgenic seedlings under drought stress, with a decrease in the malondialdehyde content, all of which are representative of drought tolerance. Taken together, these findings suggest that OsEF1A plays a positive regulatory role in rice nutritional development under drought stress. These findings will help support future studies aimed at improving yield and stress tolerance in rice at the molecular level, paving the way for a new green revolution.
