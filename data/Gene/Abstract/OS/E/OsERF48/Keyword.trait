OsERF48	root	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.
OsERF48	root	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.	 When OsERF48 was overexpressed in an either a root-specific (ROX(OsERF48) ) or whole-body (OX(OsERF48) ) manner, transgenic plants showed a longer and denser root phenotype compared to the nontransgenic (NT) controls

OsERF48	growth	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.
OsERF48	growth	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.	 Our results demonstrated that OsERF48 regulates OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhance root growth and drought tolerance
OsERF48	drought	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.
OsERF48	drought	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.	 Our results demonstrated that OsERF48 regulates OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhance root growth and drought tolerance
OsERF48	tolerance	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.	 Our results demonstrated that OsERF48 regulates OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhance root growth and drought tolerance
