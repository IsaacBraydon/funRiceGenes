OsERF48	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance. |  We constructed a putative OsERF48 regulatory network by cross-referencing ROX(OsERF48) root-specific RNA-seq data with a co-expression network database, from which we inferred the involvement of 20 drought-related genes in OsERF48-mediated responses |  They included, OsCML16, a key gene in calcium signaling during abiotic stress, which was shown to be a direct target of OsERF48 by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR analysis and a transient protoplast expression assay	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.
