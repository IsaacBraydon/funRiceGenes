1970.pdf	Rice LHS1/OsMADS1 controls floret meristem specification by coordinated regulation of transcription factors and hormone signaling pathways	2013	Plant Physiol	Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.	SEPALLATA (SEP) MADS box transcription factors mediate floral development in association with other regulators. Mutants in five rice (Oryza sativa) SEP genes suggest both redundant and unique functions in panicle branching and floret development. leafy hull sterile1/OsMADS1, from a grass-specific subgroup of LOFSEP genes, is required for specifying a single floret on the spikelet meristem and for floret organ development, but its downstream mechanisms are unknown. Here, key pathways and directly modulated targets of OsMADS1 were deduced from expression analysis after its knockdown and induction in developing florets and by studying its chromatin occupancy at downstream genes. The negative regulation of OsMADS34, another LOFSEP gene, and activation of OsMADS55, a SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE-like floret meristem identity gene, show its role in facilitating the spikelet-to-floret meristem transition. Direct regulation of other transcription factor genes like OsHB4 (a class III homeodomain Leu zipper member), OsBLH1 (a BEL1-like homeodomain member), OsKANADI2, OsKANADI4, and OsETTIN2 show its role in meristem maintenance, determinacy, and lateral organ development. We found that the OsMADS1 targets OsETTIN1 and OsETTIN2 redundantly ensure carpel differentiation. The multiple effects of OsMADS1 in promoting auxin transport, signaling, and auxin-dependent expression and its direct repression of three cytokinin A-type response regulators show its role in balancing meristem growth, lateral organ differentiation, and determinacy. Overall, we show that OsMADS1 integrates transcriptional and signaling pathways to promote rice floret specification and development.
tpj12411.pdf	The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice	2014	Plant J	Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan.	The awn is a long needle-like appendage that, in some grass species, is formed on the lemma that encloses floral organs together with the palea. In rice, most wild species and most strains of Oryza sativa ssp. indica generate an awn, whereas most strains of O. sativa ssp. japonica do not. In japonica, the long-awn characteristic appears to have been lost during domestication and breeding programs. Here, we found that the genes DROOPING LEAF (DL) and OsETTIN2 (OsETT2) are involved in awn development in the awned indica strain Kasalath. Genetic analyses and RNA-silencing experiments indicate that DL and OsETT2 act independently in awn formation, and that either gene alone is not sufficient for awn development. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the top region of the lemma (a putative awn primordium) is larger in an awned floret than in an awnless floret. OsETT2 is expressed in the awn primordium in the awned indica floret, but not in the awnless japonica floret except in the provascular bundle. DL is expressed underneath the primordium at similar levels in both indica and japonica florets, suggesting non-cell-autonomous action. We hypothesize that loss of expression of OsETT2 in the awn primordium is probably associated with the failure of awn formation in japonica strains.
NA	Control of OsARF3a by OsKANADI1 contributes to lemma development in rice.	2022	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	In rice (Oryza sativa), the lemma and palea protect the internal organs of the floret，provide nutrients for seed development, and determine grain size. We previously revealed that a trans-acting small interfering RNA targeting AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORS (tasiR-ARF) regulates lemma polarity establishment via post-transcriptional repression of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORS (ARFs) in rice. TasiR-ARF formation requires RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6). However, the underlying molecular mechanism of the tasiR-ARF-ARF regulon in lemma development remains unclear. Here, by genetic screening for suppressors of the thermosensitive mutant osrdr6-1, we identified three suppressors, huifu 1 (hf1), hf9, and hf17. Mapping-by-sequencing revealed that HF1 encodes a MYB transcription factor belonging to the KANADI1 family. The hf1 mutation partially rescued the osrdr6-1 lemma defect but not the defect in tasiR-ARF levels. DNA affinity purification sequencing analysis identified 17 725 OsKANADI1-associated sites, most of which contain the SPBP-box binding motif (RGAATAWW) and are located in the promoter, protein-coding, intron, and intergenic regions. Moreover, we found that OsKANADI1 could directly bind to the intron of OsARF3a in vitro and in vivo and promote OsARF3a expression at the transcriptional level. In addition, hf9 and hf17 are intragenic suppressors containing mutations in OsRDR6 that partially rescue tasiR-ARF levels by restoring OsRDR6 protein levels. Collectively, our results demonstrate that OsKANADI1 and tasiR-ARFs synergistically maintain the proper expression of OsARF3a and thus contribute to rice lemma development.
