OsETT2|OsETTIN2	OsETTIN1|OsARF15	Rice LHS1/OsMADS1 controls floret meristem specification by coordinated regulation of transcription factors and hormone signaling pathways	 We found that the OsMADS1 targets OsETTIN1 and OsETTIN2 redundantly ensure carpel differentiation
OsETT2|OsETTIN2	OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	Rice LHS1/OsMADS1 controls floret meristem specification by coordinated regulation of transcription factors and hormone signaling pathways	 We found that the OsMADS1 targets OsETTIN1 and OsETTIN2 redundantly ensure carpel differentiation
OsETT2|OsETTIN2	OSHB4|OsHox32	Rice LHS1/OsMADS1 controls floret meristem specification by coordinated regulation of transcription factors and hormone signaling pathways	 Direct regulation of other transcription factor genes like OsHB4 (a class III homeodomain Leu zipper member), OsBLH1 (a BEL1-like homeodomain member), OsKANADI2, OsKANADI4, and OsETTIN2 show its role in meristem maintenance, determinacy, and lateral organ development
DL	OsETT2|OsETTIN2	The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice	 Here, we found that the genes DROOPING LEAF (DL) and OsETTIN2 (OsETT2) are involved in awn development in the awned indica strain Kasalath
DL	OsETT2|OsETTIN2	The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice	 Genetic analyses and RNA-silencing experiments indicate that DL and OsETT2 act independently in awn formation, and that either gene alone is not sufficient for awn development
DL	OsETT2|OsETTIN2	The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice	 OsETT2 is expressed in the awn primordium in the awned indica floret, but not in the awnless japonica floret except in the provascular bundle
