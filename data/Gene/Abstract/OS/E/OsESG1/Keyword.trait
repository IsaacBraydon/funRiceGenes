OsESG1	root	An S-domain receptor-like kinase, OsESG1, regulates early crown root development and drought resistance in rice.	 Here, we identified an S-domain receptor-like kinase OsESG1 from rice (Oryza sativa), and identified its involvement in early crown root (CR) development and drought response
OsESG1	auxin	An S-domain receptor-like kinase, OsESG1, regulates early crown root development and drought resistance in rice.	 Results above suggested that OsESG1 may regulate CR initiation and development by controlling auxin response and distribution, and participate in stress response by regulating the activities of antioxidants and expressions of stress-regulated genes
OsESG1	development	An S-domain receptor-like kinase, OsESG1, regulates early crown root development and drought resistance in rice.	 Here, we identified an S-domain receptor-like kinase OsESG1 from rice (Oryza sativa), and identified its involvement in early crown root (CR) development and drought response
OsESG1	development	An S-domain receptor-like kinase, OsESG1, regulates early crown root development and drought resistance in rice.	 Results above suggested that OsESG1 may regulate CR initiation and development by controlling auxin response and distribution, and participate in stress response by regulating the activities of antioxidants and expressions of stress-regulated genes
OsESG1	drought	An S-domain receptor-like kinase, OsESG1, regulates early crown root development and drought resistance in rice.	 Here, we identified an S-domain receptor-like kinase OsESG1 from rice (Oryza sativa), and identified its involvement in early crown root (CR) development and drought response
OsESG1	stress	An S-domain receptor-like kinase, OsESG1, regulates early crown root development and drought resistance in rice.	 Results above suggested that OsESG1 may regulate CR initiation and development by controlling auxin response and distribution, and participate in stress response by regulating the activities of antioxidants and expressions of stress-regulated genes

Results above suggested that OsESG1 may regulate CR initiation and development by controlling auxin response and distribution, and participate in stress response by regulating the activities of antioxidants and expressions of stress-regulated genes
OsESG1	Kinase	An S-domain receptor-like kinase, OsESG1, regulates early crown root development and drought resistance in rice.	 Here, we identified an S-domain receptor-like kinase OsESG1 from rice (Oryza sativa), and identified its involvement in early crown root (CR) development and drought response
OsESG1	Kinase	An S-domain receptor-like kinase, OsESG1, regulates early crown root development and drought resistance in rice.	 The OsESG1 kinase domain possessed auto-phosphorylation activity and was able to phosphorylate MBP and His proteins
OsESG1	crown	An S-domain receptor-like kinase, OsESG1, regulates early crown root development and drought resistance in rice.	 Here, we identified an S-domain receptor-like kinase OsESG1 from rice (Oryza sativa), and identified its involvement in early crown root (CR) development and drought response
OsESG1	crown root	An S-domain receptor-like kinase, OsESG1, regulates early crown root development and drought resistance in rice.	 Here, we identified an S-domain receptor-like kinase OsESG1 from rice (Oryza sativa), and identified its involvement in early crown root (CR) development and drought response
OsESG1	stress response	An S-domain receptor-like kinase, OsESG1, regulates early crown root development and drought resistance in rice.	 Results above suggested that OsESG1 may regulate CR initiation and development by controlling auxin response and distribution, and participate in stress response by regulating the activities of antioxidants and expressions of stress-regulated genes
