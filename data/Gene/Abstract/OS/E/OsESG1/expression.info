Symbol	Expression
OsESG1	 OsESG1 was expressed ubiquitously in all tissues that were examined, with relatively higher expression in the embryo |  Transgenic plants carrying anti-sense (AS) OsESG1 were generated by knockdown of OsESG1 expression |  Results above suggested that OsESG1 may regulate CR initiation and development by controlling auxin response and distribution, and participate in stress response by regulating the activities of antioxidants and expressions of stress-regulated genes
