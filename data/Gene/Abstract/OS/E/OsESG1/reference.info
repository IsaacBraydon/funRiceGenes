Plant receptor-like kinase (RLKs) are serine/threonine protein kinases that play fundamental roles in development, innate immunity, and abiotic stress response. Here, we identified an S-domain receptor-like kinase OsESG1 from rice (Oryza sativa), and identified its involvement in early crown root (CR) development and drought response. The OsESG1 kinase domain possessed auto-phosphorylation activity and was able to phosphorylate MBP and His proteins. OsESG1 was expressed ubiquitously in all tissues that were examined, with relatively higher expression in the embryo. And it could be induced to express by treating with PEG, NaCl and ABA. Transgenic plants carrying anti-sense (AS) OsESG1 were generated by knockdown of OsESG1 expression. At the early seedling stage, AS lines had fewer CRs and shorter shoot compared with wild type (WT) plants. IAA flux and the genes' expressions of the auxin responsive and efflux carrier were infected in the AS lines. These results indicated that auxin signaling and polar auxin transport (PAT) were disrupted. The AS lines were more sensitive to osmotic stress compared to WT, and showed excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), lower activities of antioxidant enzymes, and impaired expressions of stress-related genes under PEG treatment. Results above suggested that OsESG1 may regulate CR initiation and development by controlling auxin response and distribution, and participate in stress response by regulating the activities of antioxidants and expressions of stress-regulated genes.
