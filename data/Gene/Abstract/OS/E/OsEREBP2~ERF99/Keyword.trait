OsEREBP2|ERF99	drought	OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors	On the other hand, the OsEREBP2 transcript level increased after cold, ABA, drought and high salinity treatments, indicating that OsEREBP2 may play a central role mediating the response to different abiotic stresses
OsEREBP2|ERF99	salt tolerance	OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors	Gene expression analysis in rice varieties with contrasting salt tolerance further suggests that OsEREBP2 is involved in salt stress response in rice
OsEREBP2|ERF99	salinity	OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors	On the other hand, the OsEREBP2 transcript level increased after cold, ABA, drought and high salinity treatments, indicating that OsEREBP2 may play a central role mediating the response to different abiotic stresses
OsEREBP2|ERF99	abiotic stress	OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors	On the other hand, the OsEREBP2 transcript level increased after cold, ABA, drought and high salinity treatments, indicating that OsEREBP2 may play a central role mediating the response to different abiotic stresses
OsEREBP2|ERF99	transcription factor	OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors	Thereby, two transcription factors (TFs), OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2, belonging to the AP2/ERF family were identified
OsEREBP2|ERF99	salt	OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors	Gene expression analysis in rice varieties with contrasting salt tolerance further suggests that OsEREBP2 is involved in salt stress response in rice
OsEREBP2|ERF99	salt stress	OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors	Gene expression analysis in rice varieties with contrasting salt tolerance further suggests that OsEREBP2 is involved in salt stress response in rice
