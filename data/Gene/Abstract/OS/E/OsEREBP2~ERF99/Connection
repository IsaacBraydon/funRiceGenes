OsEREBP1	OsEREBP2|ERF99	OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors	Thereby, two transcription factors (TFs), OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2, belonging to the AP2/ERF family were identified
OsEREBP2|ERF99	OsHOS1	The rice E3 ubiquitin ligase OsHOS1 modulates the expression of OsRMC, a gene involved in root mechano-sensing, through the interaction with two ERF transcription factors.	Using the yeast two-hybrid system and BiFC assays we showed that OsHOS1 interacts with two ERF transcription factors (TFs), OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2, known to regulate OsRMC gene expression
OsEREBP2|ERF99	OsHOS1	The rice E3 ubiquitin ligase OsHOS1 modulates the expression of OsRMC, a gene involved in root mechano-sensing, through the interaction with two ERF transcription factors.	In addition, we showed that OsHOS1 affects the stability of both TFs in a proteasome dependent way, suggesting that this E3-ubiquitin ligase targets OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2 for degradation
OsEREBP2|ERF99	OsPM19L1|OsPM1	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	 Quantitative real time RT-PCR suggested that seven genes may be regulated by OsNAC45 including OsCYP89G1, OsDREB1F, OsEREBP2, OsERF104, OsPM1, OsSAMDC2, and OsSIK1
OsDREB1F|RCBF2	OsEREBP2|ERF99	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	 Quantitative real time RT-PCR suggested that seven genes may be regulated by OsNAC45 including OsCYP89G1, OsDREB1F, OsEREBP2, OsERF104, OsPM1, OsSAMDC2, and OsSIK1
