OsEro1	seed	ER membrane-localized oxidoreductase Ero1 is required for disulfide bond formation in the rice endosperm	 Inhibition of the formation of native disulfide bonds was also observed in the seeds of the esp2 mutant, which lacks protein disulfide isomerase-like (PDIL)1;1, but shows enhanced OsEro1 expression
OsEro1	endosperm	ER membrane-localized oxidoreductase Ero1 is required for disulfide bond formation in the rice endosperm	 Here, we investigated an electron transfer pathway for the formation of protein disulfide bonds in the rER of the rice endosperm, focusing on the roles of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, OsEro1
