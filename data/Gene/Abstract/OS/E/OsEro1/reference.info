Hayashi-2012-Signal transduction.pdf	Signal transduction by IRE1-mediated splicing of bZIP50 and other stress sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response of rice	2012	Plant J	Genetically Modified Organism Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor IRE1 transduces signals by inducing the unconventional splicing of mRNAs encoding key transcription factors: HAC1 in yeast and XBP1 in animals. However, no HAC1 or XBP1 homologues have been found in plants, and until recently the substrate for plant IRE1 has remained unknown. This study demonstrates that the Oryza sativa (rice) OsbZIP50 transcription factor, an orthologue of Arabidopsis AtbZIP60, is regulated by IRE1-mediated splicing of its RNA. Despite the presence of a transcriptional activation domain, OsbZIP50 protein is not translocated into the nucleus efficiently in the absence of OsbZIP50 mRNA splicing. Unconventional splicing of OsbZIP50 mRNA causes a frame shift, which results in the appearance of a nuclear localization signal in the newly translated OsbZIP50. OsbZIP50 mRNA is spliced in a similar manner to HAC1 and XBP1 mRNAs; however, this splicing has very different effects on the translation products, a finding that shows the diversity of IRE1-related transcription factors in eukaryotes. In addition, the expression of OsbZIP50 is affected by ER stress sensor proteins OsIRE1, OsbZIP39 and OsbZIP60. ER stress-related genes differ with respect to their dependency on OsbZIP50 for their expression. The findings of this study improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the plant ER stress response.
zpq14156.pdf	ER membrane-localized oxidoreductase Ero1 is required for disulfide bond formation in the rice endosperm	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Division of Plant Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The developing endosperm of rice (Oryza sativa, Os) synthesizes a large amount of storage proteins on the rough (r)ER. The major storage proteins, glutelins and prolamins, contain either intra or intermolecular disulfide bonds, and oxidative protein folding is necessary for the sorting of the proteins to the protein bodies. Here, we investigated an electron transfer pathway for the formation of protein disulfide bonds in the rER of the rice endosperm, focusing on the roles of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, OsEro1. Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that N-glycosylated OsEro1 is localized to the rER membrane in the subaleurone cells, and that targeting of OsEro1 to the rER membrane depends on the N-terminal region from Met-1 to Ser-55. The RNAi knockdown of OsERO1 inhibited the formation of native disulfide bonds in the glutelin precursors (proglutelins) and promoted aggregation of the proglutelins through nonnative intermolecular disulfide bonds in the rER. Inhibition of the formation of native disulfide bonds was also observed in the seeds of the esp2 mutant, which lacks protein disulfide isomerase-like (PDIL)1;1, but shows enhanced OsEro1 expression. We detected the generation of H(2)O(2) in the rER of the WT subaleurone cells, whereas the rER-derived H(2)O(2) levels decreased markedly in EM49 homozygous mutant seeds, which have fewer sulfhydryl groups than the WT seeds. Together, we propose that the formation of native disulfide bonds in proglutelins depends on an electron transfer pathway involving OsEro1 and OsPDIL.
