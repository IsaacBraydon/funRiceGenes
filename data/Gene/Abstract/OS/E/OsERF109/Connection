AP37|OsERF3	OsERF109	The ethylene response factor OsERF109 negatively affects ethylene biosynthesis and drought tolerance in rice.	 Quantitative real-time PCR analysis also proved the regulation of OsERF109 in the expression of OSACS6, OSACO2, and OsERF3, which have been identified to play important roles in ethylene biosynthesis
