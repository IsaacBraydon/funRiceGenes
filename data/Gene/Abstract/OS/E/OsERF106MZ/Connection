OsAO3	OsERF106MZ	Overexpression of OsERF106MZ promotes parental root growth in rice seedlings by relieving the ABA-mediated inhibition of root growth under salinity stress conditions.	 Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR and luciferase (LUC) reporter assays showed that OsERF106MZ can bind directly to the sequence containing the GCC box in the promoter region of the OsAO3 gene and repress the expression of OsAO3
