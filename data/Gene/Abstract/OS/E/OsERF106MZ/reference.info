NA	Overexpression of a Novel ERF-X-Type Transcription Factor, OsERF106MZ, Reduces Shoot Growth and Tolerance to Salinity Stress in Rice.	2021	Rice (N Y)	Department of Agronomy, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Section 4, Roosevelt Road, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.	Transcription factors (TFs) such as ethylene-responsive factors (ERFs) are important for regulating plant growth, development, and responses to abiotic stress. Notably, more than half of the rice ERF-X group members, including ethylene-responsive factor 106 (OsERF106), are abiotic stress-responsive genes. However, their regulatory roles in abiotic stress responses remain poorly understood. OsERF106, a salinity-induced gene of unknown function, is annotated differently in RAP-DB and MSU RGAP. In this study, we isolated a novel (i.e., previously unannotated) OsERF106 gene, designated OsERF106MZ (GenBank accession No. MZ561461), and investigated its role in regulating growth and the response to salinity stress in rice. OsERF106MZ is expressed in germinating seeds, primary roots, and developing flowers. Overexpression of OsERF106MZ led to retardation of growth, relatively high levels of both malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced catalase (CAT) activity, and overaccumulation of both sodium (Na(+)) and potassium (K(+)) ions in transgenic rice shoots. Additionally, the expression of OsHKT1.3 was downregulated in the shoots of transgenic seedlings grown under both normal and NaCl-treated conditions, while the expression of OsAKT1 was upregulated in the same tissues grown under NaCl-treated conditions. Further microarray and qPCR analyses indicated that the expression of several abiotic stress-responsive genes such as OsABI5 and OsSRO1c was also altered in the shoots of transgenic rice grown under either normal or NaCl-treated conditions. The novel transcription factor OsERF106MZ negatively regulates shoot growth and salinity tolerance in rice through the disruption of ion homeostasis and modulation of stress-responsive gene expression.
