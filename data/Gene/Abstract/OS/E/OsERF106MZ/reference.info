NA	Overexpression of a Novel ERF-X-Type Transcription Factor, OsERF106MZ, Reduces Shoot Growth and Tolerance to Salinity Stress in Rice.	2021	Rice (N Y)	Department of Agronomy, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Section 4, Roosevelt Road, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.	Transcription factors (TFs) such as ethylene-responsive factors (ERFs) are important for regulating plant growth, development, and responses to abiotic stress. Notably, more than half of the rice ERF-X group members, including ethylene-responsive factor 106 (OsERF106), are abiotic stress-responsive genes. However, their regulatory roles in abiotic stress responses remain poorly understood. OsERF106, a salinity-induced gene of unknown function, is annotated differently in RAP-DB and MSU RGAP. In this study, we isolated a novel (i.e., previously unannotated) OsERF106 gene, designated OsERF106MZ (GenBank accession No. MZ561461), and investigated its role in regulating growth and the response to salinity stress in rice. OsERF106MZ is expressed in germinating seeds, primary roots, and developing flowers. Overexpression of OsERF106MZ led to retardation of growth, relatively high levels of both malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced catalase (CAT) activity, and overaccumulation of both sodium (Na(+)) and potassium (K(+)) ions in transgenic rice shoots. Additionally, the expression of OsHKT1.3 was downregulated in the shoots of transgenic seedlings grown under both normal and NaCl-treated conditions, while the expression of OsAKT1 was upregulated in the same tissues grown under NaCl-treated conditions. Further microarray and qPCR analyses indicated that the expression of several abiotic stress-responsive genes such as OsABI5 and OsSRO1c was also altered in the shoots of transgenic rice grown under either normal or NaCl-treated conditions. The novel transcription factor OsERF106MZ negatively regulates shoot growth and salinity tolerance in rice through the disruption of ion homeostasis and modulation of stress-responsive gene expression.
NA	Overexpression of OsERF106MZ promotes parental root growth in rice seedlings by relieving the ABA-mediated inhibition of root growth under salinity stress conditions.	2023	BMC Plant Biol	Department of Agronomy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.	BACKGROUND: Roots are essential for plant growth and have a variety of functions, such as anchoring the plant to the ground, absorbing water and nutrients from the soil, and sensing abiotic stresses, among others. OsERF106MZ is a salinity-induced gene that is expressed in germinating seeds and rice seedling roots. However, the roles of OsERF106MZ in root growth remain poorly understood. RESULTS: Histochemical staining to examine β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity in transgenic rice seedlings harboring OsERF106MZp::GUS indicated that OsERF106MZ is mainly expressed in the root exodermis, sclerenchyma layer, and vascular system. OsERF106MZ overexpression in rice seedlings leads to an increase in primary root (PR) length. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is thought to act as a hidden architect of root system structure. The expression of the ABA biosynthetic gene OsAO3 is downregulated in OsERF106MZ-overexpressing roots under normal conditions, while the expression of OsNPC3, an AtNPC4 homolog involved in ABA sensitivity, is reduced in OsERF106MZ-overexpressing roots under both normal and NaCl-treated conditions. Under normal conditions, OsERF106MZ-overexpressing roots show a significantly reduced ABA level; moreover, exogenous application of 1.0 µM ABA can suppress OsERF106MZ-mediated root growth promotion. Additionally, OsERF106MZ-overexpressing roots display less sensitivity to ABA-mediated root growth inhibition when treated with 5.0 µM ABA under normal conditions or exposed to NaCl-treated conditions. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR and luciferase (LUC) reporter assays showed that OsERF106MZ can bind directly to the sequence containing the GCC box in the promoter region of the OsAO3 gene and repress the expression of OsAO3. CONCLUSIONS: OsERF106MZ may play a role in maintaining root growth for resource uptake when rice seeds germinate under salinity stress by alleviating ABA-mediated root growth inhibition.
