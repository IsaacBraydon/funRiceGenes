OsERF106MZ	Overexpression of a Novel ERF-X-Type Transcription Factor, OsERF106MZ, Reduces Shoot Growth and Tolerance to Salinity Stress in Rice. |  Overexpression of OsERF106MZ led to retardation of growth, relatively high levels of both malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced catalase (CAT) activity, and overaccumulation of both sodium (Na(+)) and potassium (K(+)) ions in transgenic rice shoots |  The novel transcription factor OsERF106MZ negatively regulates shoot growth and salinity tolerance in rice through the disruption of ion homeostasis and modulation of stress-responsive gene expression	Overexpression of a Novel ERF-X-Type Transcription Factor, OsERF106MZ, Reduces Shoot Growth and Tolerance to Salinity Stress in Rice. |  Overexpression of OsERF106MZ led to retardation of growth, relatively high levels of both malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced catalase (CAT) activity, and overaccumulation of both sodium (Na(+)) and potassium (K(+)) ions in transgenic rice shoots
