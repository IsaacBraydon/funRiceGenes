OsEPFL9	Kinase	Optimization of rice panicle architecture by specifically suppressing ligand-receptor pairs.	 Here, we report that the EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR (EPF)/EPF-LIKE (EPFL) small secreted peptide family members OsEPFL6, OsEPFL7, OsEPFL8, and OsEPFL9 synergistically contribute to rice panicle morphogenesis by recognizing the OsER1 receptor and activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade
OsEPFL9	spikelet	Optimization of rice panicle architecture by specifically suppressing ligand-receptor pairs.	 Notably, OsEPFL6, OsEPFL7, OsEPFL8, and OsEPFL9 negatively regulate spikelet number per panicle, but OsEPFL8 also controls rice spikelet fertility
