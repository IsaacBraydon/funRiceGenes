OsEXPB2	 Analysis of spatial and temporal expression patterns demonstrated that OsEXPB2 was predominantly expressed in root of rice |  OsEXPB2 expression levels were up-regulated by abiotic stresses, such as phosphate or iron deficiency, and also suppressed by abscisic acid	 A clear difference was observed between RNA interference (RNAi) lines and wild-type in root system architecture and plant height, and the suppression of OsEXPB2 resulted in a visible alteration of the width of the leaf blade
