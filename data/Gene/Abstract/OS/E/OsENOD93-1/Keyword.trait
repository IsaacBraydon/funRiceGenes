OsENOD93-1	shoot	Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling	Transgenic rice plants over-expressing the OsENOD93-1 gene had increased shoot dry biomass and seed yield
OsENOD93-1	biomass	Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling	Transgenic rice plants over-expressing the OsENOD93-1 gene had increased shoot dry biomass and seed yield
OsENOD93-1	root	Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling	This OsENOD93-1 gene was expressed at high levels in roots of wild-type (WT) plants, and its protein product was localized in mitochondria
OsENOD93-1	vascular bundle	Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling	In situ hybridization revealed that OsENOD93-1 is expressed in vascular bundles, as well as in epidermis and endodermis
OsENOD93-1	mitochondria	Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling	This OsENOD93-1 gene was expressed at high levels in roots of wild-type (WT) plants, and its protein product was localized in mitochondria
OsENOD93-1	seed	Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling	Transgenic rice plants over-expressing the OsENOD93-1 gene had increased shoot dry biomass and seed yield
OsENOD93-1	yield	Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling	Transgenic rice plants over-expressing the OsENOD93-1 gene had increased shoot dry biomass and seed yield
