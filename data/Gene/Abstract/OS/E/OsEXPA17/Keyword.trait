OsEXPA17	root hair	Root hair-specific expansins modulate root hair elongation in rice	We identified a gene encoding EXPA17 (OsEXPA17) from a rice mutant with short root hairs
OsEXPA17	root hair	Root hair-specific expansins modulate root hair elongation in rice	Promoter::reporter transgenic lines exhibited exclusive OsEXPA17 expression in root hair cells
OsEXPA17	root hair	Root hair-specific expansins modulate root hair elongation in rice	Suppression of OsEXPA17 by RNA interference further confirmed requirement for the gene in root hair elongation
OsEXPA17	root hair	Root hair-specific expansins modulate root hair elongation in rice	Complementation of the OsEXPA17 mutant with other root hair EXPAs (OsEXPA30 and Arabidopsis EXPA7) can restore root hair elongation, indicating functional conservation of these root hair EXPAs in monocots and dicots
