REP-1|OsEP3A	seedling	Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice	 In rice (Oryza sativa), REP-1 is a primary cysteine proteinase responsible for the digestion of seed storage proteins to provide nutrients to support the growth of young seedlings
REP-1|OsEP3A	gibberellin	Two cis-acting elements necessary and sufficient for gibberellin-upregulated proteinase expression in rice seeds	 The expression of the gene for REP-1 (Rep1) is induced by gibberellins (GAs) and repressed by abscisic acid (ABA)
REP-1|OsEP3A	seed	Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice	 In rice (Oryza sativa), REP-1 is a primary cysteine proteinase responsible for the digestion of seed storage proteins to provide nutrients to support the growth of young seedlings
REP-1|OsEP3A	seed	Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice	 An OsEP3A-specific DNA probe was used to study the effect of various factors on the expression of OsEP3A in germinating seeds and vegetative tissues of rice| The expression of OsEP3A is hormonally regulated in germinating seeds, spatially and temporally regulated in vegetative tissues, and nitrogen-regulated in suspension-cultured cells| Histochemical studies also indicate that the OsEP3A promoter is sufficient to confer the hormonal regulation of GUS expression in germinating seeds
REP-1|OsEP3A	growth	Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice	 In rice (Oryza sativa), REP-1 is a primary cysteine proteinase responsible for the digestion of seed storage proteins to provide nutrients to support the growth of young seedlings
REP-1|OsEP3A	vegetative	Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice	 An OsEP3A-specific DNA probe was used to study the effect of various factors on the expression of OsEP3A in germinating seeds and vegetative tissues of rice| The expression of OsEP3A is hormonally regulated in germinating seeds, spatially and temporally regulated in vegetative tissues, and nitrogen-regulated in suspension-cultured cells
REP-1|OsEP3A	seed	Two cis-acting elements necessary and sufficient for gibberellin-upregulated proteinase expression in rice seeds	In germinating rice seeds, a cysteine proteinase (REP-1), synthesized in aleurone-layer cells, is a key enzyme in the degradation of the major storage protein, glutelin
REP-1|OsEP3A	nitrogen	Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice	 The expression of OsEP3A is hormonally regulated in germinating seeds, spatially and temporally regulated in vegetative tissues, and nitrogen-regulated in suspension-cultured cells| The OsEP3A promoter is sufficient to confer nitrogen regulation of GUS expression in suspension-cultured cells
