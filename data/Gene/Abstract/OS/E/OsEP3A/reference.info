Extracellular matrix proteins play crucial roles in plant development, morphogenesis, cell division, and proliferation. To identify extracellular proteins that regulate cell growth, the soluble proteins of extracellular matrix were extracted from suspension-cultured rice cells for different lengths of time. The extract obtained from 3-d cultures was found to increase cells' fresh weight, while extracts from 6-d and 9-d cultures showed no effect on cells' growth. A comparative proteomic analysis was used to identify soluble extracellular proteins differentially expressed between 3 and 6 days in suspension-cultured cells. Ten unique protein spots were isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. Among them, included a cysteine protease (OsCP) and a putative cysteine protease inhibitor (cystatin, OC-I). OsCP has been down regulated in vivo using RNAi transgenic lines. The fresh and dry weight growth rates of OsCP RNAi cell lines were lower than empty vector control. Recombinant protein of OC-I could inhibit the OsCP protease activity, also it could inhibit the weight increase of suspension-culture cell as well as extracellular protease activity. These results suggest that OsCP and OC-I may be involved in the process of suspension-cultured rice cells proliferation.
j.1365-313X.2003.01753.x.pdf	Two cis-acting elements necessary and sufficient for gibberellin-upregulated proteinase expression in rice seeds	2003	The Plant Journal	Department of Biological Sciences, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Minami-ohsawa 1-1, Hachioji-shi, Tokyo 192-0397, Japan.	In germinating rice seeds, a cysteine proteinase (REP-1), synthesized in aleurone-layer cells, is a key enzyme in the degradation of the major storage protein, glutelin. The expression of the gene for REP-1 (Rep1) is induced by gibberellins (GAs) and repressed by abscisic acid (ABA). To identify GA-responsive elements in the Rep1 promoter, we developed a transient expression system in rice aleurone cells. Deletion and point-mutation analyses indicated that the GA-response complex was composed of TAACAGA, TAACGTA, and two copies of CAACTC. The two former sequences were identical to GAREs conserved in the promoter of genes for alpha-amylase and proteinases in cereals. The latter, termed as CAACTC regulatory elements (CAREs), were novel GAREs. Gain-of-function experiments revealed that two pairs of GARE and CARE were necessary and sufficient to confer GA inducibility. The sequences were also required for effective transactivation by the transcription factor OsGAMyb. Four copies of either GARE or CARE showed transactivation neither by OsGAMyb nor by GA induction. CARE and GARE were also found in the promoters of a rice alpha-amylase gene, RAmy1A, and a barley proteinase gene, EPB1, which are expressed in germinating seeds. Mutations of CARE in their promoters caused a loss of GA inducibility and GAMyb transactivation, suggesting that CARE is the regulatory element for GA-inducible expression of hydrolase genes in the germinating seeds.
Plant Physiol.-2000-Ho-57-66.pdf	Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice	2000	Plant Physiol	Department of Biology, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei 11650, Taiwan, Republic of China.	In many plants, cysteine proteinases play essential roles in a variety of developmental and physiological processes. In rice (Oryza sativa), REP-1 is a primary cysteine proteinase responsible for the digestion of seed storage proteins to provide nutrients to support the growth of young seedlings. In the present study, the gene encoding REP-1 was isolated, characterized, and designated as OsEP3A. An OsEP3A-specific DNA probe was used to study the effect of various factors on the expression of OsEP3A in germinating seeds and vegetative tissues of rice. The expression of OsEP3A is hormonally regulated in germinating seeds, spatially and temporally regulated in vegetative tissues, and nitrogen-regulated in suspension-cultured cells. The OsEP3A promoter was linked to the coding sequence of the reporter gene, gusA, which encodes beta-glucuronidase (GUS), and the chimeric gene was introduced into the rice genome. The OsEP3A promoter is sufficient to confer nitrogen regulation of GUS expression in suspension-cultured cells. Histochemical studies also indicate that the OsEP3A promoter is sufficient to confer the hormonal regulation of GUS expression in germinating seeds. These studies demonstrate that in rice the REP-1 protease encoded by OsEP3A may play a role in various physiological responses and processes, and that multiple mechanisms regulate the expression of OsEP3A.
