OsEXO1	OsRPA2|OsRPA32-1	Rice exonuclease-1 homologue, OsEXO1, that interacts with DNA polymerase lambda and RPA subunit proteins, is involved in cell proliferation	 Yeast two-hybrid analysis shows that OsEXO1 interacted with rice DNA polymerase lambda (OsPol lambda), the 70 kDa subunit b of rice replication protein A (OsRPA70b), and the 32 kDa subunit 1 of rice replication protein A (OsRPA32-1)
OsEXO1	OsRecQl4	Overexpression of OsRecQl4 and/or OsExo1 enhances DSB-induced homologous recombination in rice	 Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of rice proteins OsRecQl4 (BLM counterpart) and/or OsExo1 (Exo1 homolog) can enhance DSB processing, as evaluated by recombination substrate reporter lines in rice
