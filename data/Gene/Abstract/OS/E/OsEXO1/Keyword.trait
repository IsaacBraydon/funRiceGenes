OsEXO1	cell cycle	Rice exonuclease-1 homologue, OsEXO1, that interacts with DNA polymerase lambda and RPA subunit proteins, is involved in cell proliferation	 Inhibition of cell proliferation by removal of sucrose from the medium or by the addition of cell cycle inhibitors decreased OsEXO1 expression
OsEXO1	meristem	Rice exonuclease-1 homologue, OsEXO1, that interacts with DNA polymerase lambda and RPA subunit proteins, is involved in cell proliferation	 The transcript of OsEXO1 is highly expressed in meristematic tissues and panicles
OsEXO1	panicle	Rice exonuclease-1 homologue, OsEXO1, that interacts with DNA polymerase lambda and RPA subunit proteins, is involved in cell proliferation	 The transcript of OsEXO1 is highly expressed in meristematic tissues and panicles
