OsEIN2	ethylene	ACO1, a gene for aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase: effects on internode elongation at the heading stage in rice	 Interestingly, expression of the ACC synthase gene ACS1 and ethylene signalling gene OsEIN2 was up-regulated in the aco1 mutants
OsEIN2	ethylene	OsEIN2 is a positive component in ethylene signaling in rice	 In the OsEIN2 antisense plants, the expression levels of two ethylene-responsive genes, SC129 and SC255, were decreased compared with the wild types| These results suggest that OsEIN2 is a positive component of the ethylene-signaling pathway in rice, just as AtEIN2 is in Arabidopsis|OsEIN2 is a positive component in ethylene signaling in rice
