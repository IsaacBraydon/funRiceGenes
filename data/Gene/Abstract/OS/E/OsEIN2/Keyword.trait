OsEIN2	ethylene	ACO1, a gene for aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase: effects on internode elongation at the heading stage in rice	Interestingly, expression of the ACC synthase gene ACS1 and ethylene signalling gene OsEIN2 was up-regulated in the aco1 mutants
OsEIN2	ethylene	OsEIN2 is a positive component in ethylene signaling in rice	In the OsEIN2 antisense plants, the expression levels of two ethylene-responsive genes, SC129 and SC255, were decreased compared with the wild types
OsEIN2	ethylene	OsEIN2 is a positive component in ethylene signaling in rice	These results suggest that OsEIN2 is a positive component of the ethylene-signaling pathway in rice, just as AtEIN2 is in Arabidopsis
OsEIN2	ethylene	OsEIN2 is a positive component in ethylene signaling in rice	OsEIN2 is a positive component in ethylene signaling in rice
OsEIN2	resistance	Dual impact of ambient humidity on the virulence of Magnaporthe oryzae and basal resistance in rice.	 Knock out of ethylene signaling genes OsEIL1 and OsEIN2 or exogenous application of 1-methylcyclopropene (ethylene inhibitor) and ethephon (ethylene analogues) eliminated the difference of blast resistance between the 70% and 90% relative humidity conditions, suggesting that the activation of ethylene signaling contributes to humidity-modulated basal resistance against M
