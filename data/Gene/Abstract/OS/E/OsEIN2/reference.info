The tissue-specificity of ACO1 expression indicated that its transcript significantly accumulated in lower parts of elongating internodes at the heading stage. Histochemical analysis and in situ hybridization showed that the ACO1 expression was localized in the basal parts of leaf sheaths immediately above nodes or the lower parts of elongating internodes. To further examine the role of ACO1, ACO1-deficient (aco1) and overexpressing (ACO1-OX) mutants were characterized. The total length of the elongated internodes of aco1 mutants was slightly shorter than that of wild-type plants and that of ACO1-OX mutants was longer. Interestingly, expression of the ACC synthase gene ACS1 and ethylene signalling gene OsEIN2 was up-regulated in the aco1 mutants. This study suggests that the ACO1 has a little effect on internode elongation at the heading stage, and that up-regulation of the ACS1 and OsEIN2 expression may attenuate inhibition of internode elongation.
Plant Cell Physiol-2004-Jun-281-9.pdf	OsEIN2 is a positive component in ethylene signaling in rice	2004	Plant and Cell Physiology	National Research Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics, Division of Molecular and Life Sciences, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, 790-784 Korea.	EIN2 is a central signal transducer in the ethylene-signaling pathway, and a unique membrane-anchored protein. By screening a cDNA library, we have isolated a cDNA clone (OsEIN2) that encodes the rice EIN2 homolog. The full-length ORF clone was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. OsEIN2 shares significant amino acid sequence similarity with Arabidopsis EIN2 (57% similarity and 42% identity). Both the numbers and positions of introns and exons in the OsEIN2 and AtEIN2 coding regions are also conserved. To address whether this structural similarity is indicative of functional conservation of the corresponding proteins, we also generated transgenic lines expressing the antisense construct of OsEIN2. Those plants were stunted and shoot elongation was severely inhibited. Their phenotypes were similar to that found with wild-type rice seedlings that were treated with AgNO3, an ethylene signal inhibitor. In the OsEIN2 antisense plants, the expression levels of two ethylene-responsive genes, SC129 and SC255, were decreased compared with the wild types. These results suggest that OsEIN2 is a positive component of the ethylene-signaling pathway in rice, just as AtEIN2 is in Arabidopsis. Our antisense transgenic plants produced approximately 3.5 times more ethylene than the wild-type plants. Expression analysis of rice ACS and ACO genes showed that the transcript levels of OsACS1 and OsACS1 were elevated in the transgenic plants.
NA	The Polycistronic miR166k-166h Positively Regulates Rice Immunity via Post-transcriptional Control ofEIN2.	2018	Front Plant Sci	Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics CSIC-IRTA-UAB-UB, Universitat Aut¨°noma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs acting as regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In plants, most miRNAs are generated from independent transcriptional units, and only a few polycistronic miRNAs have been described. miR166 is a conserved miRNA in plants targeting theHD-ZIP IIItranscription factor genes. Here, we show that a polycistronic miRNA comprising two miR166 family members, miR166k and miR166h, functions as a positive regulator of rice immunity. Rice plants with activatedMIR166k-166hexpression showed enhanced resistance to infection by the fungal pathogensMagnaporthe oryzaeandFusarium fujikuroi, the causal agents of the rice blast and bakanae disease, respectively. Disease resistance in rice plants with activatedMIR166k-166hexpression was associated with a stronger expression of defense responses during pathogen infection. Stronger induction ofMIR166k-166hexpression occurred in resistant but not susceptible rice cultivars. Notably, theethylene-insensitive 2(EIN2) gene was identified as a novel target gene for miR166k. The regulatory role of the miR166h-166k polycistron on the newly identified target gene results from the activity of the miR166k-5p specie generated from the miR166k-166h precursor. Collectively, our findings support a role for miR166k-5p in rice immunity by controllingEIN2expression. Because rice blast is one of the most destructive diseases of cultivated rice worldwide, unraveling miR166k-166h-mediated mechanisms underlying blast resistance could ultimately help in designing appropriate strategies for rice protection.
