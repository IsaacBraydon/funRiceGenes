Common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) is an important genetic reservoir for rice improvement. We investigated a quantitative trait locus (QTL), qGP5-1, which is related to plant height, leaf size and panicle architecture, using a set of introgression lines of O. rufipogon in the background of the Indica cultivar Guichao2 (Oryza sativa L.). We cloned and characterized qGP5-1 and confirmed that the newly identified gene OsEBS (enhancing biomass and spikelet number) increased plant height, leaf size and spikelet number per panicle, leading to an increase in total grain yield per plant. Our results showed that the increased size of vegetative organs in OsEBS-expressed plants was enormously caused by increasing cell number. Sequence alignment showed that OsEBS protein contains a region with high similarity to the N-terminal conserved ATPase domain of Hsp70, but it lacks the C-terminal regions of the peptide-binding domain and the C-terminal lid. More results indicated that OsEBS gene did not have typical characteristics of Hsp70 in this study. Furthermore, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transformed with OsEBS showed a similar phenotype to OsEBS-transgenic rice, indicating a conserved function of OsEBS among plant species. Together, we report the cloning and characterization of OsEBS, a new QTL that controls rice biomass and spikelet number, through map-based cloning, and it may have utility in improving grain yield in rice.
NA	RNA-Seq Transcriptome Analysis and Evolution of OsEBS, a Gene Involved in Enhanced Spikelet Number per Panicle in Rice.	2023	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering and MOE Engineering Research Center of Gene Technology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China.	Spikelet number per panicle (SNP) is one of the most important yield components in rice. Rice ENHANCING BIOMASS AND SPIKELET NUMBER (OsEBS), a gene involved in improved SNP and yield, has been cloned from an accession of Dongxiang wild rice. However, the mechanism of OsEBS increasing rice SNP is poorly understood. In this study, the RNA-Seq technology was used to analyze the transcriptome of wildtype Guichao 2 and OsEBS over-expression line B102 at the heading stage, and analysis of the evolution of OsEBS was also conducted. A total of 5369 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between Guichao2 and B102, most of which were down-regulated in B102. Analysis of the expression of endogenous hormone-related genes revealed that 63 auxin-related genes were significantly down-regulated in B102. Gene Ontogeny (GO) enrichment analysis showed that the 63 DEGs were mainly enriched in eight GO terms, including auxin-activated signaling pathway, auxin polar transport, auxin transport, basipetal auxin transport, and amino acid transmembrane transport, most of which were directly or indirectly related to polar auxin transport. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathway analysis further verified that the down-regulated genes related to polar auxin transport had important effects on increased SNP. Analysis of the evolution of OsEBS found that OsEBS was involved in the differentiation of indica and japonica, and the differentiation of OsEBS supported the multi-origin model of rice domestication. Indica (XI) subspecies harbored higher nucleotide diversity than japonica (GJ) subspecies in the OsEBS region, and XI experienced strong balancing selection during evolution, while selection in GJ was neutral. The degree of genetic differentiation between GJ and Bas subspecies was the smallest, while it was the highest between GJ and Aus. Phylogenetic analysis of the Hsp70 family in O. sativa, Brachypodium distachyon, and Arabidopsis thaliana indicated that changes in the sequences of OsEBS were accelerated during evolution. Accelerated evolution and domain loss in OsEBS resulted in neofunctionalization. The results obtained from this study provide an important theoretical basis for high-yield rice breeding.
