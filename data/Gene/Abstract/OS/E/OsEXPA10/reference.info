NA	An Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10 is involved in root cell elongation of rice.	2016	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, , Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, China.	Expansins are cell-wall loosening proteins, which are encoded by multigene families. However, the physiological role of most expansin genes is still poorly understood. Here, we functionally characterized an Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10, which is regulated by a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor, ART1 in rice. A detailed expression analysis showed that OsEXPA10 was expressed in both the roots and shoots at a similar level, but only the expression in the roots was rapidly up-regulated in response to Al. Furthermore, spatial expression analysis showed that the Al-induced expression was only found in the root tips (0-3 mm), but not in the mature root zones. The expression was neither induced by other metals including Cd and La nor by low pH. Immunostaining showed that OsEXPA10 was localized at all cells of the root tips. Knockout of OsEXPA10 resulted in a significant decrease in the cell elongation of the roots in the absence of Al. In the presence of Al, knockout of OsEXPA10 did not alter the Al sensitivity evaluated by relative root elongation, but the root cell wall of knockout lines accumulated less Al compared to those of the wild-type rice. Collectively, our results indicate that OsEXPA10 expressed in the root tips is required for the root cell elongation, but that the contribution of this gene to high Al tolerance in rice is small.

NA	OsEXPA10 mediates the balance between growth and resistance to biotic stress in rice.	2018	Plant Cell Rep	Key Laboratory of Insect Developmental and Evolutionary Biology, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200032, China.	OsEXPA10 gene coordinates the balance between rice development and biotic resistance. Expansins are proteins that can loosen the cell wall. Previous studies have indicated that expansin-encoding genes were involved in defense against abiotic stress, but little is known about the involvement of expansins in biotic stress. Brown planthopper (BPH) is one of the worst insect pests of rice in the Asia-Pacific planting area, and many efforts have been made to identify and clone BPH-resistance genes for use in breeding resistant cultivars. At the same time, rice blast caused by Magnaporthe grisea is one of the three major diseases that severely affect rice production worldwide. Here, we demonstrated that one rice expansin-encoding gene, OsEXPA10, functions in both rice growth and biotic resistance. Over expression of OsEXPA10 improved rice growth but also increased susceptibility to BPH infestation and blast attack, while knock-down OsEXPA10 gene expression resulted in reduced plant height and grain size, but also increased resistance to BPH and the blast pathogen. These results imply that OsEXPA10 mediates the balance between rice development and biotic resistance.
