OsEXPA10	root	An Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10 is involved in root cell elongation of rice.	An Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10 is involved in root cell elongation of rice.
OsEXPA10	root	An Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10 is involved in root cell elongation of rice.	Immunostaining showed that OsEXPA10 was localized at all cells of the root tips
OsEXPA10	root	An Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10 is involved in root cell elongation of rice.	In the presence of Al, knockout of OsEXPA10 did not alter the Al sensitivity evaluated by relative root elongation, but the root cell wall of knockout lines accumulated less Al compared to those of the wild-type rice
OsEXPA10	root	An Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10 is involved in root cell elongation of rice.	Collectively, our results indicate that OsEXPA10 expressed in the root tips is required for the root cell elongation, but that the contribution of this gene to high Al tolerance in rice is small
OsEXPA10	tolerance	An Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10 is involved in root cell elongation of rice.	Collectively, our results indicate that OsEXPA10 expressed in the root tips is required for the root cell elongation, but that the contribution of this gene to high Al tolerance in rice is small
OsEXPA10	root elongation	An Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10 is involved in root cell elongation of rice.	In the presence of Al, knockout of OsEXPA10 did not alter the Al sensitivity evaluated by relative root elongation, but the root cell wall of knockout lines accumulated less Al compared to those of the wild-type rice
OsEXPA10	Al tolerance	An Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10 is involved in root cell elongation of rice.	Collectively, our results indicate that OsEXPA10 expressed in the root tips is required for the root cell elongation, but that the contribution of this gene to high Al tolerance in rice is small
OsEXPA10	cell wall	An Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10 is involved in root cell elongation of rice.	In the presence of Al, knockout of OsEXPA10 did not alter the Al sensitivity evaluated by relative root elongation, but the root cell wall of knockout lines accumulated less Al compared to those of the wild-type rice
OsEXPA10	cell elongation	An Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10 is involved in root cell elongation of rice.	An Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10 is involved in root cell elongation of rice.
OsEXPA10	cell elongation	An Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10 is involved in root cell elongation of rice.	Knockout of OsEXPA10 resulted in a significant decrease in the cell elongation of the roots in the absence of Al
OsEXPA10	cell elongation	An Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10 is involved in root cell elongation of rice.	Collectively, our results indicate that OsEXPA10 expressed in the root tips is required for the root cell elongation, but that the contribution of this gene to high Al tolerance in rice is small
