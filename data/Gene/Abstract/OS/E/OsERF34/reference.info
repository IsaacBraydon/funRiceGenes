Cellulose and lignin are critical cell wall components for plant morphogenesis and adaptation to environmental conditions. The cytoskeleton supports cell wall deposition, but much of the underpinning regulatory components remain unknown. Here, we show that an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) family and microtubule-binding protein Rice Morphology Determinant (RMD) in rice (Oryza sativa) peduncles. OsERF34 and RMD are highly expressed in sclerenchymatous peduncle cells that are fortified by thick secondary cell walls (SCWs) that provide mechanical peduncle strength. erf34 and rmd-1 mutants contained lower cellulose and lignin contents and thinner SCWs, while ERF34 over-expressing (OE) lines maintained high cellulose and lignin content with thicker SCWs. These characteristics impacted peduncle mechanical strength, that is, reduced strength in erf34 and rmd-1 and increased strength of ERF34 OE plants. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the OsERF34-RMD cascade positively regulates SCW synthesis and mechanical strength in rice peduncles, which is important for yield, and provide a potential guide for improved peduncle breeding efforts in rice.
