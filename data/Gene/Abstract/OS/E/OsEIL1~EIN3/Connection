ETR2|Os-ERL1	OsEIL1|MHZ6	Identification and characterization of a novel water-deficit-suppressed gene OsARD encoding an aci-reductone-dioxygenase-like protein in rice	 Furthermore, the expression of two genes for ethylene signal transduction, ETR2 and EIN3, increased in these RNAi transgenic plants, whereas the expression of ERF3 was suppressed
AP37|OsERF3	OsEIL1|MHZ6	Identification and characterization of a novel water-deficit-suppressed gene OsARD encoding an aci-reductone-dioxygenase-like protein in rice	 Furthermore, the expression of two genes for ethylene signal transduction, ETR2 and EIN3, increased in these RNAi transgenic plants, whereas the expression of ERF3 was suppressed
OsACO1	OsEIL1|MHZ6	OsEIL1, a rice homolog of the Arabidopsis EIN3 regulates the ethylene response as a positive component	 OsEBP89, an ethylene responsive element binding protein (EREBP) and OsACO1, an ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) oxidase gene were enhanced in the OsEIL1 overexpressing transgenic plants
OsEIL1|MHZ6	OsEIN2	Activation of ethylene signaling pathways enhances disease resistance by regulating ROS and phytoalexin production in rice.	 Ethylene signaling components OsEIN2 and the downstream transcription factor OsEIL1 positively regulated disease resistance
