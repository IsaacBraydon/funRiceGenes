1-s2.0-S0378111905004130-main.pdf	Identification and characterization of a novel water-deficit-suppressed gene OsARD encoding an aci-reductone-dioxygenase-like protein in rice	2005	Gene	The State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310029, PR China.	The aci-reductone dioxygenase (ARD) family common to bacteria, plants and animals is involved in the methionine salvage pathway. A water-deficit-suppressed gene, OsARD encoding an aci-reductone-dioxygenase-like protein, was identified from rice (Oryza sativa L.). Northern blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that the OsARD expression is regulated by abiotic stresses and phytohormones. OsARD was mainly expressed in roots under flood conditions. It was suppressed by abiotic stresses including water deficit, high salinity and low temperature, and induced by ethylene and gibberellin acid (GA). Our results showed that the genes for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthase and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase were upregulated in RNA-interference (RNAi) transgenic rice plants with a significant reduction of OsARD expression. Furthermore, the expression of two genes for ethylene signal transduction, ETR2 and EIN3, increased in these RNAi transgenic plants, whereas the expression of ERF3 was suppressed. These results suggest that OsARD may play a role in the metabolism of methionine and ethylene in response to abiotic stresses.
10.1007-s00438-009-0483-1.pdf	Involvement of two rice ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE genes in wound signaling	2009	Mol Genet Genomics	National Institute of Crop Science, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8518, Japan.	Ethylene and jasmonic acid (JA) have been proposed as key compounds for wound signaling in plants. In Arabidopsis, ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3), which is an essential transcription factor for ethylene signaling, is regulated at the post-transcriptional level, while transcriptional regulation of EIN3 or EIN3-LIKE (EIL) genes has not been well documented. The expression of 6 rice EIL genes (OsEIL1-6) was analyzed and only OsEIL1 and 2 were found to be wound-inducible EIL. OsEIL2 was also induced by JA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that recombinant OsEIL1 and 2 proteins bound to specific DNA sequences that are recognized by a wound-inducible tobacco EIL. Accumulation of OsEIL1 and 2 transcripts reached a maximum at 1 and 0.5 h after wounding, respectively, and the corresponding DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts of rice leaves was increased at 1 h after wounding. Candidates for OsEIL-target genes were selected by microarray analysis of wounded rice and by promoter sequence analyses of wound-inducible genes identified by microarray analysis. In OsEIL1- and/or 2-suppressed rice plants, the expression of at least four of 18 candidate genes analyzed was down-regulated. These results indicate the importance of inducible OsEILs in wound signaling in rice.
OsEIL1.pdf	OsEIL1, a rice homolog of the Arabidopsis EIN3 regulates the ethylene response as a positive component	2006	Plant Mol Biol	Institute of Plant Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, PR China.	The plant gaseous hormone ethylene regulates many aspects of plant growth, development and responses to the environment. ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) is a transcription factor involved in the ethylene signal transduction pathway in Arabidopsis. To gain a better understanding of the ethylene signal transduction pathway in rice, six EIN3-like genes (designated OsEIL1-6) were identified. OsEIL1, which showed highest similarity with EIN3, was isolated and functionally characterized. Ectopic expression of OsEIL1 in Arabidopsis can partially complement the ein3-1 mutant. The transgenic rice plants with overexpression of OsEIL1 exhibit short root, coiled primary root and slightly short shoot phenotype and elevated response to exogenous ethylene. OsEBP89, an ethylene responsive element binding protein (EREBP) and OsACO1, an ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) oxidase gene were enhanced in the OsEIL1 overexpressing transgenic plants. These results indicate that OsEIL1 is involved in ethylene signal transduction pathway and acts as a positive regulator of ethylene response in rice.
NA	MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 Regulate Ethylene Response of Roots and Coleoptiles and Negatively Affect Salt Tolerance in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	CITY: Beijng China [CN] Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, CAS University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.	Ethylene plays important roles in plant growth and development and stress responses. The ethylene signaling pathway has been extensively studied mainly in Arabidopsis. Howeverï¼Œthe molecular mechanism of ethylene signaling is largely unknown in rice. Previously, we have isolated a set of rice ethylene-response mutants. Here, we characterized the mutant mhz6. Through map-based cloning, we found that MHZ6 encodes OsEIL1, a rice homolog of EIN3, which is the master transcriptional regulator of ethylene signaling in Arabidopsis. Disruption of MHZ6/OsEIL1 caused ethylene insensitivity mainly in roots, whereas silencing of the closely-related OsEIL2 led to ethylene insensitivity mainly in coleoptiles of etiolated seedlings. This organ-specific functional divergence is different from the functional features of EIN3 and EIL1, both of which mediate the incomplete ethylene-responses of Arabidopsis etiolated seedlings. In Arabidopsis, EIN3 and EIL1 play positive roles in plant salt tolerance. In rice, however, lack of MHZ6/OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 functions improves salt tolerance, whereas the overexpression lines exhibits salt hypersensitivity at seedling stage, indicating that MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 negatively regulate salt tolerance in rice. Furthermore, this negative regulation by MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in salt tolerance is likely in part attributable to the direct regulation of OsHKT2;1 expression and Na+ uptake in roots. Additionally, MHZ6/OsEIL1 overexpression promotes grain size and thousand-grain-weight. Together, our study provides insights for functional diversification of MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in ethylene response and finds a novel mode of ethylene-regulated salt stress response which could be helpful for engineering salt-tolerant crops.
NA	Activation of ethylene signaling pathways enhances disease resistance by regulating ROS and phytoalexin production in rice.	2016	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Ethylene plays diverse roles in plant growth, development and stress responses. However, the roles of ethylene signaling in immune responses remain largely unknown. In this study, we showed that the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae infection activated ethylene biosynthesis in rice. Resistant rice cultivars accumulated higher levels of ethylene than susceptible ones. Ethylene signaling components OsEIN2 and the downstream transcription factor OsEIL1 positively regulated disease resistance. Mutation of OsEIN2 led to enhanced disease susceptibility. Whole-genome transcription analysis revealed that responsive genes of ethylene, jasmonates (JAs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling as well as phytoalexin biosynthesis genes were remarkably induced. Transcription of OsrbohA/B, which encode NADPH oxidases, and OsOPRs, the JA biosynthesis genes, were induced by M. oryzae infection. Furthermore, we demonstrated that OsEIL1 binds to the promoters of OsrbohA/OsrbohB and OsOPR4 to activate their expression. These data suggest that OsEIN2-mediated OsrbohA/OsrbohB and OsOPR transcription may play essential roles in ROS generation, JA biosynthesis and the subsequent phytoalexin accumulation. Therefore, the involvement of ethylene signaling in disease resistance is probably by activation of ROS and phytoalexin production in rice during M. oryzae infection.

NA	The activation of OsEIL1 on YUC8M transcription and auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice early seedling development.	2017	PLoS Genet	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Rice is an important monocotyledonous crop worldwide; it differs from the dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis in many aspects. In Arabidopsis, ethylene and auxin act synergistically to regulate root growth and development. However, their interaction in rice is still unclear. Here, we report that the transcriptional activation of OsEIL1 on the expression of YUC8/REIN7 and indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA)-dependent auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation. Using an inhibitor of YUC activity, which regulates auxin biosynthesis via the conversion of IPA to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), we showed that ethylene-inhibited primary root elongation is dependent on YUC-based auxin biosynthesis. By screening phenotypes of seedling primary root from mutagenesis libraries following ethylene treatment, we identified a rice ethylene-insensitive mutant, rein7-1, in which YUC8/REIN7 is truncated at its C-terminus. Mutation in YUC8/REIN7 reduced auxin biosynthesis in rice, while YUC8/REIN7 overexpression enhanced ethylene sensitivity in the roots. Moreover, YUC8/REIN7 catalyzed the conversion of IPA to IAA, truncated version at C-terminal end of the YUC8/REIN7 resulted in significant reduction of enzymatic activity, indicating that YUC8/REIN7 is required for IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis and ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice early seedlings. Further investigations indicated that ethylene induced YUC8/REIN7 expression and promoted auxin accumulation in roots. Addition of low concentrations of IAA rescued the ethylene response in the rein7-1, strongly demonstrating that ethylene-inhibited root elongation depends on IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis. Genetic studies revealed that YUC8/REIN7-mediated auxin biosynthesis functioned downstream of OsEIL1, which directly activated the expression of YUC8/REIN7. Thus, our findings reveal a model of interaction between ethylene and auxin in rice seedling primary root elongation, enhancing our understanding of ethylene signaling in rice.
NA	OsEIL1 protects rice growth under NH(4) (+) nutrition by regulating OsVTC1-3-dependent N-glycosylation and root NH(4) (+) efflux.	2022	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, China.	Rice is known for its superior adaptation to ammonium (NH(4) (+) ) as a nitrogen source. Compared to many other cereals, it displays lower NH(4) (+) efflux in roots and higher nitrogen-use efficiency on NH(4) (+) . A critical role for GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (VTC1) in controlling root NH(4) (+) fluxes was previously documented in Arabidopsis, but the molecular pathways involved in regulating VTC1-dependent NH(4) (+) efflux remain unclear. Here, we report that ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3-LIKE1 (OsEIL1) acts as a key transcription factor regulating OsVTC1-3-dependent NH(4) (+) efflux and protein N-glycosylation in rice grown under NH(4) (+) nutrition. We show that OsEIL1 in rice plays a contrasting role to Arabidopsis-homologous ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (AtEIN3) and maintains rice growth under NH(4) (+) by stabilizing protein N-glycosylation and reducing root NH(4) (+) efflux. OsEIL1 constrains NH(4) (+) efflux by activation of OsVTC1-3, but not OsVTC1-1 or OsVTC1-8. OsEIL1 binds directly to the promoter EIN3-binding site (EBS) of OsVTC1-3 in vitro and in vivo and acts to increase the transcription of OsVTC1-3. Our work demonstrates an important link between excessive root NH(4) (+) efflux and OsVTC1-3-mediated protein N-glycosylation in rice grown under NH(4) (+) nutrition and identifies OsEIL1 as a direct genetic regulator of OsVTC1-3 expression.
NA	The OsEIL1-OsERF115-target gene regulatory module controls grain size and weight in rice.	2022	Plant Biotechnol J	Shunde Graduate School, Research Center of Biology and Agriculture, Zhongzhi International Institute of Agricultural Biosciences, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China.	Grain size is one of the essential determinants of rice yield. Our previous studies revealed that ethylene plays an important role in grain-size control; however, the precise mechanism remains to be determined. Here, we report that the ethylene response factor OsERF115 functions as a key downstream regulator for ethylene-mediated grain development. OsERF115 encodes an AP2/ERF-type transcriptional factor that is specifically expressed in young spikelets and developing caryopses. Overexpression of OsERF115 significantly increases grain length, width, thickness and weight by promoting longitudinal elongation and transverse division of spikelet hull cells, as well as enhancing grain-filling activity, whereas its knockout mutations lead to the opposite effects, suggesting that OsERF115 positively regulates grain size and weight. OsERF115 transcription is strongly induced by ethylene, and OsEIL1 directly binds to the promoter to activate its expression. OsERF115 acts as a transcriptional repressor to directly or indirectly modulate a set of grain-size genes during spikelet growth and endosperm development. Importantly, haplotype analysis reveals that the SNP variations in the EIN3-binding sites of OsERF115 promoter are significantly associated with the OsERF115 expression levels and grain weight, suggesting that natural variations in the OsERF115 promoter contribute to grain-size diversity. In addition, the OsERF115 orthologues are identified only in grass species, implying a conserved and unique role in the grain development of cereal crops. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanism of ethylene-mediated grain-size control and a potential strategy based on the OsEIL1-OsERF115-target gene regulatory module for genetic improvement of rice yield.
NA	Rice EIL1 interacts with OsIAAs to regulate auxin biosynthesis mediated by the tryptophan aminotransferase MHZ10/OsTAR2 during root ethylene responses.	2022	Plant Cell	State Key Lab of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Ethylene plays essential roles in adaptive growth of rice (Oryza sativa). Understanding of the crosstalk between ethylene and auxin (Aux) is limited in rice. Here, from an analysis of the root-specific ethylene-insensitive rice mutant mao hu zi 10 (mhz10), we identified the tryptophan aminotransferase (TAR) MHZ10/OsTAR2, which catalyzes the key step in indole-3-pyruvic acid-dependent Aux biosynthesis. Genetically, OsTAR2 acts downstream of ethylene signaling in root ethylene responses. ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 like1 (OsEIL1) directly activated OsTAR2 expression. Surprisingly, ethylene induction of OsTAR2 expression still required the Aux pathway. We also show that Os indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)1/9 and OsIAA21/31 physically interact with OsEIL1 and show promotive and repressive effects on OsEIL1-activated OsTAR2 promoter activity, respectively. These effects likely depend on their EAR motif-mediated histone acetylation/deacetylation modification. The special promoting activity of OsIAA1/9 on OsEIL1 may require both the EAR motifs and the flanking sequences for recruitment of histone acetyltransferase. The repressors OsIAA21/31 exhibit earlier degradation upon ethylene treatment than the activators OsIAA1/9 in a TIR1/AFB-dependent manner, allowing OsEIL1 activation by activators OsIAA1/9 for OsTAR2 expression and signal amplification. This study reveals a positive feedback regulation of ethylene signaling by Aux biosynthesis and highlights the crosstalk between ethylene and Aux pathways at a previously underappreciated level for root growth regulation in rice.
