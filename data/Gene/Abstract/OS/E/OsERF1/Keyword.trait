OsERF1	ethylene	Overexpression of OsERF1, a novel rice ERF gene, up-regulates ethylene-responsive genes expression besides affects growth and development in Arabidopsis	 Here, we report a novel member of ERF group in rice, OsERF1 (Ethylene Response Factor gene in Oryza sativa)
OsERF1	ethylene	Overexpression of OsERF1, a novel rice ERF gene, up-regulates ethylene-responsive genes expression besides affects growth and development in Arabidopsis	 OsERF1 expressed consistently in different organs of rice and could be up-regulated by ethylene, a plant hormone associated with stress response
OsERF1	ethylene	Overexpression of OsERF1, a novel rice ERF gene, up-regulates ethylene-responsive genes expression besides affects growth and development in Arabidopsis	 Overexpression of OsERF1 in Arabidopsis up-regulated the expression of two known ethylene-responsive genes, PDF1
OsERF1	ethylene	Overexpression of OsERF1, a novel rice ERF gene, up-regulates ethylene-responsive genes expression besides affects growth and development in Arabidopsis	 These results suggest the involvement of OsERF1 in ethylene response
OsERF1	ethylene	Overexpression of OsERF1, a novel rice ERF gene, up-regulates ethylene-responsive genes expression besides affects growth and development in Arabidopsis	Overexpression of OsERF1, a novel rice ERF gene, up-regulates ethylene-responsive genes expression besides affects growth and development in Arabidopsis
OsERF1	salt	RSOsPR10 expression in response to environmental stresses is regulated antagonistically by jasmonate/ethylene and salicylic acid signaling pathways in rice roots	" Expression of OsERF1, a transcription factor in the JA/ET pathway, was induced earlier than that of RSOsPR10 after salt, JA and ACC treatments"
OsERF1	 sa 	RSOsPR10 expression in response to environmental stresses is regulated antagonistically by jasmonate/ethylene and salicylic acid signaling pathways in rice roots	 Simultaneous SA treatment strongly inhibited the induction of RSOsPR10 expression and, to a lesser extent, induction of OsERF1 expression
OsERF1	 sa 	RSOsPR10 expression in response to environmental stresses is regulated antagonistically by jasmonate/ethylene and salicylic acid signaling pathways in rice roots	 These results suggest that JA/ET and SA pathways function in the stress-responsive induction of RSOsPR10, and that OsERF1 may be one of the transcriptional factors in the JA/ET pathway
OsERF1	 ja 	RSOsPR10 expression in response to environmental stresses is regulated antagonistically by jasmonate/ethylene and salicylic acid signaling pathways in rice roots	 Expression of OsERF1, a transcription factor in the JA/ET pathway, was induced earlier than that of RSOsPR10 after salt, JA and ACC treatments
OsERF1	transcription factor	RSOsPR10 expression in response to environmental stresses is regulated antagonistically by jasmonate/ethylene and salicylic acid signaling pathways in rice roots	 Expression of OsERF1, a transcription factor in the JA/ET pathway, was induced earlier than that of RSOsPR10 after salt, JA and ACC treatments
OsERF1	growth	Overexpression of OsERF1, a novel rice ERF gene, up-regulates ethylene-responsive genes expression besides affects growth and development in Arabidopsis	Overexpression of OsERF1, a novel rice ERF gene, up-regulates ethylene-responsive genes expression besides affects growth and development in Arabidopsis
