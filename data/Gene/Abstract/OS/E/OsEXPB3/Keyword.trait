OsEXPB3	vegetative	Biochemical properties and localization of the beta-expansin OsEXPB3 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Using antibodies specific for OsEXPB3, a vegetative beta-expansin of rice (Oryza sativa L
OsEXPB3	cell wall	Biochemical properties and localization of the beta-expansin OsEXPB3 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	), we found that OsEXPB3 is tightly bound to the cell wall and, unlike alpha-expansins, cannot be solubilized with extraction buffer containing 1 M NaCl
OsEXPB3	root	Biochemical properties and localization of the beta-expansin OsEXPB3 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Immunohistochemistry showed that OsEXPB3 is present in all regions of the coleoptile and root tissues tested
