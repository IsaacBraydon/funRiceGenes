OsERF83	 OsERF83 expression was also induced by treatments with methyl jasmonate, ethephon, and salicylic acid, indicating that multiple phytohormones could be involved in the regulation of OsERF83 expression under biotic stress |  Taken together, our findings show that OsERF83 is a novel ERF transcription factor that confers blast resistance by regulating the expression of defense-related genes in rice
