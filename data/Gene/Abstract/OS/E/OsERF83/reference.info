NA	The rice ethylene response factor OsERF83 positively regulates disease resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae.	2018	Plant Physiol Biochem	Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Kannondai, Tsukuba, 305-8602, Japan; Graduate School of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Kita-ku, Sapporo, 060-8589, Japan.	Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most destructive diseases of rice (Oryza sativa) worldwide. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of a novel ethylene response factor (ERF) gene, OsERF83, which was expressed in rice leaves in response to rice blast fungus infection. OsERF83 expression was also induced by treatments with methyl jasmonate, ethephon, and salicylic acid, indicating that multiple phytohormones could be involved in the regulation of OsERF83 expression under biotic stress. Subcellular localization and transactivation analyses demonstrated that OsERF83 is a nucleus-localized transcriptional activator. A gel-shift assay using recombinant OsERF83 protein indicated that, like other ERFs, it binds to the GCC box. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsERF83 exhibited significantly suppressed lesion formation after rice blast infection, indicating that OsERF83 positively regulates disease resistance in rice. Genes encoding several classes of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, including PR1, PR2, PR3, PR5, and PR10, were upregulated in the OsERF83ox plants. Taken together, our findings show that OsERF83 is a novel ERF transcription factor that confers blast resistance by regulating the expression of defense-related genes in rice.
NA	Overexpression of OsERF83, a Vascular Tissue-Specific Transcription Factor Gene, Confers Drought Tolerance in Rice	2021	Int J Mol Sci	Crop Biotechnology Institute, GreenBio Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Pyeongchang 25354, Korea.	Abiotic stresses severely affect plant growth and productivity. To cope with abiotic stresses, plants have evolved tolerance mechanisms that are tightly regulated by reprogramming transcription factors (TFs). APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF) transcription factors are known to play an important role in various abiotic stresses. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms remains incomplete. In this study, we identified the role of OsERF83, a member of the AP2/ERF transcription factor family, in response to drought stress. OsERF83 is a transcription factor localized to the nucleus and induced in response to various abiotic stresses, such as drought and abscisic acid (ABA). Overexpression of OsERF83 in transgenic plants (OsERF83OX) significantly increased drought tolerance, with higher photochemical efficiency in rice. OsERF83OX was also associated with growth retardation, with reduced grain yields under normal growth conditions. OsERF83 is predominantly expressed in the vascular tissue of all organs. Transcriptome analysis revealed that OsERF83 regulates drought response genes, which are related to the transporter (OsNPF8.10, OsNPF8.17, OsLH1), lignin biosynthesis (OsLAC17, OsLAC10, CAD8D), terpenoid synthesis (OsTPS33, OsTPS14, OsTPS3), cytochrome P450 family (Oscyp71Z4, CYP76M10), and abiotic stress-related genes (OsSAP, OsLEA14, PCC13-62). OsERF83 also up-regulates biotic stress-associated genes, including PATHOGENESIS-RELATED PROTEIN (PR), WALL-ASSOCIATED KINASE (WAK), CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE PROTEIN E1 (CslE1), and LYSM RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (RLK) genes. Our results provide new insight into the multiple roles of OsERF83 in the cross-talk between abiotic and biotic stress signaling pathways.
