Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most destructive diseases of rice (Oryza sativa) worldwide. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of a novel ethylene response factor (ERF) gene, OsERF83, which was expressed in rice leaves in response to rice blast fungus infection. OsERF83 expression was also induced by treatments with methyl jasmonate, ethephon, and salicylic acid, indicating that multiple phytohormones could be involved in the regulation of OsERF83 expression under biotic stress. Subcellular localization and transactivation analyses demonstrated that OsERF83 is a nucleus-localized transcriptional activator. A gel-shift assay using recombinant OsERF83 protein indicated that, like other ERFs, it binds to the GCC box. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsERF83 exhibited significantly suppressed lesion formation after rice blast infection, indicating that OsERF83 positively regulates disease resistance in rice. Genes encoding several classes of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, including PR1, PR2, PR3, PR5, and PR10, were upregulated in the OsERF83ox plants. Taken together, our findings show that OsERF83 is a novel ERF transcription factor that confers blast resistance by regulating the expression of defense-related genes in rice.
