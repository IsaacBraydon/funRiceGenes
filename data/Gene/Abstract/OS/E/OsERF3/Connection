AP37|OsERF3	AP59|OsBIERF3|OsAP59	Overexpression of the Transcription Factor AP37 in Rice Improves Grain Yield under Drought Conditions	Two genes, AP37 and AP59, representing subgroups I and II, respectively, were functionally characterized
AP37|OsERF3	AP59|OsBIERF3|OsAP59	Overexpression of the Transcription Factor AP37 in Rice Improves Grain Yield under Drought Conditions	The overexpression of AP37 and AP59 in rice under the control of the constitutive promoter OsCc1 increased the tolerance to drought and high salinity at the vegetative stage
AP37|OsERF3	AP59|OsBIERF3|OsAP59	Overexpression of the Transcription Factor AP37 in Rice Improves Grain Yield under Drought Conditions	Microarray experiments identified 10 and 38 genes that are up-regulated by AP37 and AP59, respectively, in addition to 37 genes that are commonly induced by both factors
AP37|OsERF3	TIP2|bHLH142	The bHLH142 Transcription Factor Coordinates with TDR1 to Modulate the Expression of EAT1 and Regulate Pollen Development in Rice	EAT1 positively regulates the expression of AP37 and AP25, which induce tapetal programmed cell death.
AP37|OsERF3	WOX11	The Interaction between Rice ERF3 and WOX11 Promotes Crown Root Development by Regulating Gene Expression Involved in Cytokinin Signaling	Here, we identified a rice AP2/ERF protein, ERF3, which interacts with WOX11 and was expressed in crown root initials and during crown root growth.
AP37|OsERF3	WOX11	The Interaction between Rice ERF3 and WOX11 Promotes Crown Root Development by Regulating Gene Expression Involved in Cytokinin Signaling	Also, increased expression of ERF3 could partially complement wox11, indicating that the two genes functioned cooperatively to regulate crown root development.
AP37|OsERF3	WOX11	The Interaction between Rice ERF3 and WOX11 Promotes Crown Root Development by Regulating Gene Expression Involved in Cytokinin Signaling	ERF3 and WOX11 shared a common target, the cytokinin-responsive gene RR2.
AP37|OsERF3	WOX11	The Interaction between Rice ERF3 and WOX11 Promotes Crown Root Development by Regulating Gene Expression Involved in Cytokinin Signaling	Furthermore, ERF3-regulated RR2 expression was involved in crown root initiation, while the ERF3/WOX11 interaction likely repressed RR2 during crown root elongation.
AP37|OsERF3	OsERF109	The ethylene response factor OsERF109 negatively affects ethylene biosynthesis and drought tolerance in rice.	Quantitative real-time PCR analysis also proved the regulation of OsERF109 in the expression of OSACS6, OSACO2, and OsERF3, which have been identified to play important roles in ethylene biosynthesis
