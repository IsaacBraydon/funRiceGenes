OsCCR1	OsERF71	Overexpression of the OsERF71 transcription factor Alters Rice Root Structure and Drought Resistance.	Furthermore, OsERF71 was found to directly bind to the promoter of OsCCR1, a key gene in lignin biosynthesis
OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059|OsPRI3	OsERF71	Identification of two transcription factors activating the expression of OsXIP in rice defence response.	 Using yeast one-hybrid screening, coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, a basic helix-loop-helix protein (OsbHLH59) and an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) transcription factor OsERF71 directly binding to the 562<U+00A0>bp key sequence to activate the expression of OsXIP were identified, which is further supported by transient expression assay
OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059|OsPRI3	OsERF71	Identification of two transcription factors activating the expression of OsXIP in rice defence response.	 Moreover, transcriptional analysis revealed that mechanical wounding and treatment with MeJA resulted in an obvious increase in transcript levels of OsbHLH59 and OsERF71 in root and shoot tissues
OsERF71	OsXIP	Identification of two transcription factors activating the expression of OsXIP in rice defence response.	 Using yeast one-hybrid screening, coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, a basic helix-loop-helix protein (OsbHLH59) and an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) transcription factor OsERF71 directly binding to the 562<U+00A0>bp key sequence to activate the expression of OsXIP were identified, which is further supported by transient expression assay
