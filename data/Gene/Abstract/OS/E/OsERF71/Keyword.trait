OsERF71	root	Overexpression of the OsERF71 transcription factor Alters Rice Root Structure and Drought Resistance.	Overexpression of the OsERF71 transcription factor Alters Rice Root Structure and Drought Resistance.
OsERF71	root	Overexpression of the OsERF71 transcription factor Alters Rice Root Structure and Drought Resistance.	OsERF71 overexpression in roots elevated the expression levels of genes related to cell wall loosening and lignin biosynthetic genes, which correlated with changes in root structure, the formation of enlarged aerenchyma and high lignification levels
OsERF71	growth	Overexpression of the OsERF71 transcription factor Alters Rice Root Structure and Drought Resistance.	Overexpression of OsERF71 either throughout the entire plant or specifically in roots, resulted in a drought resistance phenotype at the vegetative growth stage, indicating that overexpression in roots was sufficient to confer drought resistance

OsERF71	transcription factor	Identification of two transcription factors activating the expression of OsXIP in rice defence response.	 Using yeast one-hybrid screening, coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, a basic helix-loop-helix protein (OsbHLH59) and an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) transcription factor OsERF71 directly binding to the 562<U+00A0>bp key sequence to activate the expression of OsXIP were identified, which is further supported by transient expression assay
