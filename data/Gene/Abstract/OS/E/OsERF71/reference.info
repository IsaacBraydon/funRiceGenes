NA	Overexpression of the OsERF71 transcription factor Alters Rice Root Structure and Drought Resistance.	2016	Plant Physiol	Graduate School of International Agricultural Technology and Crop Biotechnology Institute/GreenBio Science and Technology, Seoul National University CITY: Pyeongchang Korea (South), Republic Of.	Plant responses to drought stress require the regulation of transcriptional networks via drought responsive transcription factors, which mediate a range of morphological and physiological changes. AP2/ERF transcription factors are known to act as key regulators of drought resistance transcriptional networks; however, little is known about the associated molecular mechanisms that give rise to specific morphological and physiological adaptations. In this study, we functionally characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) drought responsive AP2/ERF transcription factor, OsERF71, which is predominantly expressed in the root meristem, pericycle, and endodermis. Overexpression of OsERF71 either throughout the entire plant or specifically in roots, resulted in a drought resistance phenotype at the vegetative growth stage, indicating that overexpression in roots was sufficient to confer drought resistance. The root specific overexpression was more effective in conferring drought resistance at the reproductive stage, such that grain yield was increased by 23-42% over wild type plants or whole-body overexpressing transgenic lines under drought conditions. OsERF71 overexpression in roots elevated the expression levels of genes related to cell wall loosening and lignin biosynthetic genes, which correlated with changes in root structure, the formation of enlarged aerenchyma and high lignification levels. Furthermore, OsERF71 was found to directly bind to the promoter of OsCCR1, a key gene in lignin biosynthesis. These results indicate that the OsERF71-mediated drought resistance pathway recruits factors involved in cell wall modification to enable root morphological adaptations, thereby providing a mechanism for enhancing drought resistance.
NA	Rice OsERF71-mediated root modification affects shoot drought tolerance.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	a Graduation School of International Agricultural Technology and Crop Biotechnology Institute/GreenBio Science and Technology, Seoul National University , Pyeongchang 25354 , Korea.	Drought is the most serious problem that impedes crop development and productivity worldwide. Although several studies have documented the root architecture adaption for drought tolerance, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our latest study demonstrated that overexpression of the OsERF71 in rice roots under drought conditions modifies root structure including larger aerenchyma and radial root growth, and thereby, protects the rice plants from drought stresses. The OsERF71-mediated root modifications are caused by combinatory overexpression of general stress-inducible, cell wall-associated and lignin biosynthesis genes that contribute to drought tolerance. Here we addressed that the OsERF71-mediated root modifications alter physiological capacity in shoots without evidence of developmental changes for drought tolerance. Thus, the OsERF71-mediated root modifications provide novel molecular insights into drought tolerance mechanisms.
