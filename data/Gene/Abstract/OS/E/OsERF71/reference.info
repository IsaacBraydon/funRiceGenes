NA	Overexpression of the OsERF71 transcription factor Alters Rice Root Structure and Drought Resistance.	2016	Plant Physiol	Graduate School of International Agricultural Technology and Crop Biotechnology Institute/GreenBio Science and Technology, Seoul National University CITY: Pyeongchang Korea (South), Republic Of.	Plant responses to drought stress require the regulation of transcriptional networks via drought responsive transcription factors, which mediate a range of morphological and physiological changes. AP2/ERF transcription factors are known to act as key regulators of drought resistance transcriptional networks; however, little is known about the associated molecular mechanisms that give rise to specific morphological and physiological adaptations. In this study, we functionally characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) drought responsive AP2/ERF transcription factor, OsERF71, which is predominantly expressed in the root meristem, pericycle, and endodermis. Overexpression of OsERF71 either throughout the entire plant or specifically in roots, resulted in a drought resistance phenotype at the vegetative growth stage, indicating that overexpression in roots was sufficient to confer drought resistance. The root specific overexpression was more effective in conferring drought resistance at the reproductive stage, such that grain yield was increased by 23-42% over wild type plants or whole-body overexpressing transgenic lines under drought conditions. OsERF71 overexpression in roots elevated the expression levels of genes related to cell wall loosening and lignin biosynthetic genes, which correlated with changes in root structure, the formation of enlarged aerenchyma and high lignification levels. Furthermore, OsERF71 was found to directly bind to the promoter of OsCCR1, a key gene in lignin biosynthesis. These results indicate that the OsERF71-mediated drought resistance pathway recruits factors involved in cell wall modification to enable root morphological adaptations, thereby providing a mechanism for enhancing drought resistance.
NA	Rice OsERF71-mediated root modification affects shoot drought tolerance.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	a Graduation School of International Agricultural Technology and Crop Biotechnology Institute/GreenBio Science and Technology, Seoul National University , Pyeongchang 25354 , Korea.	Drought is the most serious problem that impedes crop development and productivity worldwide. Although several studies have documented the root architecture adaption for drought tolerance, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our latest study demonstrated that overexpression of the OsERF71 in rice roots under drought conditions modifies root structure including larger aerenchyma and radial root growth, and thereby, protects the rice plants from drought stresses. The OsERF71-mediated root modifications are caused by combinatory overexpression of general stress-inducible, cell wall-associated and lignin biosynthesis genes that contribute to drought tolerance. Here we addressed that the OsERF71-mediated root modifications alter physiological capacity in shoots without evidence of developmental changes for drought tolerance. Thus, the OsERF71-mediated root modifications provide novel molecular insights into drought tolerance mechanisms.
NA	Identification of two transcription factors activating the expression of OsXIP in rice defence response.	2017	BMC Biotechnol	College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Xylanase inhibitors have been confirmed to be involved in plant defence. OsXIP is a XIP-type rice xylanase inhibitor, yet its transcriptional regulation remains unknown.Herbivore infestation, wounding and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment enhanced mRNA levels and protein levels of OsXIP. By analyzing different 5' deletion mutants of OsXIP promoter exposed to rice brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens stress, a 562<U+00A0>bp region (-1451 - -889) was finally identified as the key sequence for the herbivores stress response. Using yeast one-hybrid screening, coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, a basic helix-loop-helix protein (OsbHLH59) and an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) transcription factor OsERF71 directly binding to the 562<U+00A0>bp key sequence to activate the expression of OsXIP were identified, which is further supported by transient expression assay. Moreover, transcriptional analysis revealed that mechanical wounding and treatment with MeJA resulted in an obvious increase in transcript levels of OsbHLH59 and OsERF71 in root and shoot tissues.Our data shows that two proteins as direct transcriptional activators of OsXIP responding to stress were identified. These results reveal a coordinated regulatory mechanism of OsXIP, which may probably be involved in defence responses via a JA-mediated signaling pathway.
NA	Transcriptional Network Analysis Reveals Drought Resistance Mechanisms of AP2/ERF Transgenic Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National UniversitySeoul, South Korea.	This study was designed to investigate at the molecular level how a transgenic version of rice &quot;Nipponbare&quot; obtained a drought-resistant phenotype. Using multi-omics sequencing data, we compared wild-type rice (WT) and a transgenic version (erf71) that had obtained a drought-resistant phenotype by overexpressing OsERF71, a member of the AP2/ERF transcription factor (TF) family. A comprehensive bioinformatics analysis pipeline, including TF networks and a cascade tree, was developed for the analysis of multi-omics data. The results of the analysis showed that the presence of OsERF71 at the source of the network controlled global gene expression levels in a specific manner to make erf71 survive longer than WT. Our analysis of the time-series transcriptome data suggests that erf71 diverted more energy to survival-critical mechanisms related to translation, oxidative response, and DNA replication, while further suppressing energy-consuming mechanisms, such as photosynthesis. To support this hypothesis further, we measured the net photosynthesis level under physiological conditions, which confirmed the further suppression of photosynthesis in erf71. In summary, our work presents a comprehensive snapshot of transcriptional modification in transgenic rice and shows how this induced the plants to acquire a drought-resistant phenotype.
NA	OsERF71 confers drought tolerance via modulating ABA signaling and proline biosynthesis.	2018	Plant Sci	Key Lab of Crop Heterosis and Utilization of Ministry of Education and Beijing Key Lab of Crop Genetic Improvement, China Agricultural University, Beijing, People's Republic of China.	Plants have evolved multiple protective strategies to adapt to adverse environmental conditions. Upland rice (UR) has evolved as a &quot;drought-resistant type&quot;. However, little is known about genes or mechanisms in UR that underlying drought tolerance at the molecular level. Here we report isolation and functional characterization of the ERF gene, OsERF71, from the UR variety, IRAT109. The expression of OsERF71 was induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and various abiotic stresses preferentially in IRAT109 under ABA, dehydration, and polyethyleneglycol (PEG) treatments. OsERF71 was verified as a nuclear-localized protein and had transcriptional activity in yeast cells. Overexpression of the OsERF71 in Nipponbare demonstrated a significant increase in tolerance to drought stress and a reduced rate of water loss. In contrast, OsERF71 interference lines were sensitive to drought stress and exhibited a higher rate of water loss. OsERF71-overexpressing lines also showed enhanced tolerance to high salinity. Moreover, OsERF71 regulated the expression of several ABA- responsive and proline biosynthesis genes under drought stress, resulting in enhanced sensitivity to exogenous ABA treatment and proline accumulation. Accordingly, we suggest that OsERF71 plays a positive role in drought stress tolerance by increasing the expression of genes associated with ABA signaling and proline biosynthesis under stress.
