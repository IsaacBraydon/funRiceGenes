OsERF71	Overexpression of the OsERF71 transcription factor Alters Rice Root Structure and Drought Resistance. |  Overexpression of OsERF71 either throughout the entire plant or specifically in roots, resulted in a drought resistance phenotype at the vegetative growth stage, indicating that overexpression in roots was sufficient to confer drought resistance |  OsERF71 overexpression in roots elevated the expression levels of genes related to cell wall loosening and lignin biosynthetic genes, which correlated with changes in root structure, the formation of enlarged aerenchyma and high lignification levels	Overexpression of the OsERF71 transcription factor Alters Rice Root Structure and Drought Resistance. |  Overexpression of OsERF71 either throughout the entire plant or specifically in roots, resulted in a drought resistance phenotype at the vegetative growth stage, indicating that overexpression in roots was sufficient to confer drought resistance |  OsERF71 overexpression in roots elevated the expression levels of genes related to cell wall loosening and lignin biosynthetic genes, which correlated with changes in root structure, the formation of enlarged aerenchyma and high lignification levels
OsERF71	 Our latest study demonstrated that overexpression of the OsERF71 in rice roots under drought conditions modifies root structure including larger aerenchyma and radial root growth, and thereby, protects the rice plants from drought stresses |  The OsERF71-mediated root modifications are caused by combinatory overexpression of general stress-inducible, cell wall-associated and lignin biosynthesis genes that contribute to drought tolerance	 Our latest study demonstrated that overexpression of the OsERF71 in rice roots under drought conditions modifies root structure including larger aerenchyma and radial root growth, and thereby, protects the rice plants from drought stresses |  The OsERF71-mediated root modifications are caused by combinatory overexpression of general stress-inducible, cell wall-associated and lignin biosynthesis genes that contribute to drought tolerance
OsERF71	 The expression of OsERF71 was induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and various abiotic stresses preferentially in IRAT109 under ABA, dehydration, and polyethyleneglycol (PEG) treatments |  Overexpression of the OsERF71 in Nipponbare demonstrated a significant increase in tolerance to drought stress and a reduced rate of water loss |  Moreover, OsERF71 regulated the expression of several ABA- responsive and proline biosynthesis genes under drought stress, resulting in enhanced sensitivity to exogenous ABA treatment and proline accumulation |  Accordingly, we suggest that OsERF71 plays a positive role in drought stress tolerance by increasing the expression of genes associated with ABA signaling and proline biosynthesis under stress	 Overexpression of the OsERF71 in Nipponbare demonstrated a significant increase in tolerance to drought stress and a reduced rate of water loss
