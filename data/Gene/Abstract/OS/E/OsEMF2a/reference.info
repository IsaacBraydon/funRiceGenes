Some core PcG proteins, such as Enhancer of Zeste (E(z)), Suppressor of Zeste (12) (Su(z)12), and Extra Sex Combs (ESC), are conserved in plants. The rice genome contains two E(z)-like genes, OsiEZ1 and OsCLF, two homologs of Su(z)12, OsEMF2a and OsEMF2b, and two ESC-like genes, OsFIE1 and OsFIE2. OsFIE1 is expressed only in endosperm; the maternal copy is expressed while the paternal copy is not active. Other rice PcG genes are expressed in a wide range of tissues and are not imprinted in the endosperm. The two E(z)-like genes appear to have duplicated before the separation of the dicots and monocots; the two homologs of Su(z)12 possibly duplicated during the evolution of the Gramineae and the two ESC-like genes are likely to have duplicated in the ancestor of the grasses. No homologs of the Arabidopsis seed-expressed PcG genes MEA and FIS2 were identified in the rice genome. We have isolated T-DNA insertion lines in the rice homologs of three PcG genes. There is no autonomous endosperm development in these T-DNA insertion lines. One line with a T-DNA insertion in OsEMF2b displays pleiotropic phenotypes including altered flowering time and abnormal flower organs, suggesting important roles in rice development for this gene.
NA	The maternally expressed polycomb group gene OsEMF2a is essential for endosperm cellularization and imprinting in rice	2021	Plant Commun	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology, Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics of the Ministry of Education, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Agricultural College of Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.	Cellularization is a key event in endosperm development. Polycomb group (PcG) genes, such as Fertilization-Independent Seed 2 (FIS2), are vital for the syncytium-to-cellularization transition in Arabidopsis plants. In this study, we found that OsEMF2a, a rice homolog of the Arabidopsis PcG gene Embryonic Flower2 (EMF2), plays a role similar to that of FIS2 in regard to seed development, although there is limited sequence similarity between the genes. Delayed cellularization was observed in osemf2a, associated with an unusual activation of type I MADS-box genes. The cell cycle was persistently activated in osemf2a caryopses, which was likely caused by cytokinin overproduction. However, the overaccumulation of auxin was not found to be associated with the delayed cellularization. As OsEMF2a is a maternally expressed gene in the endosperm, a paternally inherited functional allele was unable to recover the maternal defects of OsEMF2a. Many imprinted rice genes were deregulated in the defective hybrid seeds of osemf2a (¡â)/9311 (¡á) (m9). The paternal expression bias of some paternally expressed genes was disrupted in m9 due to either the activation of maternal alleles or the repression of paternal alleles. These findings suggest that OsEMF2a-PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 is necessary for endosperm cellularization and genomic imprinting in rice.
