OsELF4a	flowering time	LUX ARRHYTHMO Interacts With ELF3a and ELF4a to Coordinate Vegetative Growth and Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.	 Unlike OsLUX, loss OsELF4a displayed a marginal influence under short-day (SD) condition, but markedly delayed flowering time under long-day (LD) condition
OsELF4a	flowering	LUX ARRHYTHMO Interacts With ELF3a and ELF4a to Coordinate Vegetative Growth and Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.	 OsLUX combined with OsELF4a and OsELF3a or OsELF3b to form two ECs, of which the OsLUX-OsELF3a-OsELF4a was likely the dominant promoter for photoperiodic flowering
OsELF4a	flowering	LUX ARRHYTHMO Interacts With ELF3a and ELF4a to Coordinate Vegetative Growth and Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.	 In addition, OsELF4a was also essential for promoting rice flowering
