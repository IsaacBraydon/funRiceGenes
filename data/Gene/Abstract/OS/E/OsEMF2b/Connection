OsEMF2b	OsFIE1|Epi-df	Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes	 The rice genome contains two E(z)-like genes, OsiEZ1 and OsCLF, two homologs of Su(z)12, OsEMF2a and OsEMF2b, and two ESC-like genes, OsFIE1 and OsFIE2
OsCLF	OsEMF2b	Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes	 The rice genome contains two E(z)-like genes, OsiEZ1 and OsCLF, two homologs of Su(z)12, OsEMF2a and OsEMF2b, and two ESC-like genes, OsFIE1 and OsFIE2
OsEMF2b	OsFIE2	Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes	 The rice genome contains two E(z)-like genes, OsiEZ1 and OsCLF, two homologs of Su(z)12, OsEMF2a and OsEMF2b, and two ESC-like genes, OsFIE1 and OsFIE2
OsEMF2b	OsiEZ1|OsSET1	Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes	 The rice genome contains two E(z)-like genes, OsiEZ1 and OsCLF, two homologs of Su(z)12, OsEMF2a and OsEMF2b, and two ESC-like genes, OsFIE1 and OsFIE2

Ehd1	OsEMF2b	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	 As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression
OsEMF2b	OsLFL1	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	 As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression
OsEMF2b	OsVIL2	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	 We showed that OsVIL2 physically interacts with OsEMF2b, a component of polycomb repression complex 2| As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression
