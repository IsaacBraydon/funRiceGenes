Ehd1	OsEMF2b	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression
OsEMF2b	OsLFL1	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression
OsEMF2b	OsVIL2	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	We showed that OsVIL2 physically interacts with OsEMF2b, a component of polycomb repression complex 2
