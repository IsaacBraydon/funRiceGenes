OsEMF2b	flowering time	Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes	 One line with a T-DNA insertion in OsEMF2b displays pleiotropic phenotypes including altered flowering time and abnormal flower organs, suggesting important roles in rice development for this gene
OsEMF2b	flower	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	 As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression
OsEMF2b	flower	Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes	 One line with a T-DNA insertion in OsEMF2b displays pleiotropic phenotypes including altered flowering time and abnormal flower organs, suggesting important roles in rice development for this gene
