OsEMF2b	flowering time	Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes	One line with a T-DNA insertion in OsEMF2b displays pleiotropic phenotypes including altered flowering time and abnormal flower organs, suggesting important roles in rice development for this gene
OsEMF2b	flower	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression
OsEMF2b	flower	Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes	One line with a T-DNA insertion in OsEMF2b displays pleiotropic phenotypes including altered flowering time and abnormal flower organs, suggesting important roles in rice development for this gene
OsEMF2b	floral meristem determinacy	The polycomb group gene EMF2B is essential for maintenance of floral meristem determinacy in rice	The polycomb group gene EMF2B is essential for maintenance of floral meristem determinacy in rice
OsEMF2b	floral meristem	The polycomb group gene EMF2B is essential for maintenance of floral meristem determinacy in rice	The polycomb group gene EMF2B is essential for maintenance of floral meristem determinacy in rice
OsEMF2b	floral	The polycomb group gene EMF2B is essential for maintenance of floral meristem determinacy in rice	The polycomb group gene EMF2B is essential for maintenance of floral meristem determinacy in rice
OsEMF2b	sterility	The polycomb group gene EMF2B is essential for maintenance of floral meristem determinacy in rice	Loss of EMF2B in rice results in complete sterility, and mutant flowers have severe floral organ defects and indeterminacy that resemble loss-of-function mutants in E-function floral organ specification genes.
OsEMF2b	floral organ	The polycomb group gene EMF2B is essential for maintenance of floral meristem determinacy in rice	Loss of EMF2B in rice results in complete sterility, and mutant flowers have severe floral organ defects and indeterminacy that resemble loss-of-function mutants in E-function floral organ specification genes.
