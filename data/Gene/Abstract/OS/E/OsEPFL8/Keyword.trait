OsEPFL8	spikelet	Optimization of rice panicle architecture by specifically suppressing ligand-receptor pairs.	 Notably, OsEPFL6, OsEPFL7, OsEPFL8, and OsEPFL9 negatively regulate spikelet number per panicle, but OsEPFL8 also controls rice spikelet fertility
OsEPFL8	fertility	Optimization of rice panicle architecture by specifically suppressing ligand-receptor pairs.	 Notably, OsEPFL6, OsEPFL7, OsEPFL8, and OsEPFL9 negatively regulate spikelet number per panicle, but OsEPFL8 also controls rice spikelet fertility
