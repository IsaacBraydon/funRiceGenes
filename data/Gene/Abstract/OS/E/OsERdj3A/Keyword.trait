OsERdj3A	root	Analysis of rice ER-resident J-proteins reveals diversity and functional differentiation of the ER-resident Hsp70 system in plants	 The expression of OsP58B, OsERdj3A, and OsERdj3B was predominantly up-regulated in roots subjected to ER stress
OsERdj3A	seed	Analysis of rice ER-resident J-proteins reveals diversity and functional differentiation of the ER-resident Hsp70 system in plants	 Furthermore, OsERdj3A was not expressed in wild-type seeds but was up-regulated in transgenic seeds accumulating human interleukin-7 (hIL-7)
