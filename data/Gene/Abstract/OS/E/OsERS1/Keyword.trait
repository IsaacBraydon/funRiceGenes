OsERS1	anther	A Rice Glutamyl-tRNA Synthetase Modulates Early Anther Cell Division and Patterning.	 Notably, the anther defects of osers1 are causally associated with the abnormal accumulation of H2O2, which can reconstitute the osers1 phenotype when applied to wild type
OsERS1	node	A Rice Glutamyl-tRNA Synthetase Modulates Early Anther Cell Division and Patterning.	 Further, metabolomics profiling reveals that OsERS1 is an important node for multiple metabolic pathways, indicated by the accumulation of amino acids and TCA components in osers1 anthers
