OsEBF1	OsEBF2	The F-box protein OsEBF2 confers the resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilparvata lugens Stål).	 OsEBF2 is the homologous gene of OsEBF1, and the sequence identity between the two genes is 78
OsEBF2	OsEIL1|MHZ6	The F-box protein OsEBF2 confers the resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilparvata lugens Stål).	 Our results indicated that OsEBF2 can directly interact with OsEIL1 and positively regulate rice resistance to BPH
