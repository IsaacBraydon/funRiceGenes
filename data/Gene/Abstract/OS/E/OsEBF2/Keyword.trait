OsEBF2	resistance	The F-box protein OsEBF2 confers the resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilparvata lugens Stål).	The F-box protein OsEBF2 confers the resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilparvata lugens Stål).
OsEBF2	resistance	The F-box protein OsEBF2 confers the resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilparvata lugens Stål).	 Our results indicated that OsEBF2 can directly interact with OsEIL1 and positively regulate rice resistance to BPH
OsEBF2	resistance	The F-box protein OsEBF2 confers the resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilparvata lugens Stål).	 The resistance mechanism of the OsEBF2 gene may be to reduce the content of ET in rice by inhibiting the expression of ethylene response factor genes
OsEBF2	resistance	The F-box protein OsEBF2 confers the resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilparvata lugens Stål).	 This study revealed that OsEBF2 is an F-box protein that positively regulates the rice resistance to BPH and can be used as an effective target gene for rice BPH resistance breeding
OsEBF2	ethylene	The F-box protein OsEBF2 confers the resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilparvata lugens Stål).	 The resistance mechanism of the OsEBF2 gene may be to reduce the content of ET in rice by inhibiting the expression of ethylene response factor genes
OsEBF2	brown planthopper	The F-box protein OsEBF2 confers the resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilparvata lugens Stål).	The F-box protein OsEBF2 confers the resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilparvata lugens Stål).
OsEBF2	breeding	The F-box protein OsEBF2 confers the resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilparvata lugens Stål).	 This study revealed that OsEBF2 is an F-box protein that positively regulates the rice resistance to BPH and can be used as an effective target gene for rice BPH resistance breeding
OsEBF2	ethylene response	The F-box protein OsEBF2 confers the resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilparvata lugens Stål).	 The resistance mechanism of the OsEBF2 gene may be to reduce the content of ET in rice by inhibiting the expression of ethylene response factor genes
