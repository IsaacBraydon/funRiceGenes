The brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens) is a piercing-sucking insect pest specific to rice plants and may cause severe declines in rice yields. Therefore, it is of great theoretical significance and practical application value to elucidate the molecular mechanism of rice resistance to BPH. Previous studies have shown that an ethylene (ET) signaling pathway gene, OsEBF1, positively regulates BPH resistance in rice. OsEBF1 is an E3 ligase that mediates the degradation of another ET pathway gene, OsEIL1. OsEBF2 is the homologous gene of OsEBF1, and the sequence identity between the two genes is 78.5%. Our results indicated that OsEBF2 can directly interact with OsEIL1 and positively regulate rice resistance to BPH. More importantly, there were no obvious differences in agronomic traits between WT and OsEBF2OE transgenic lines. The resistance mechanism of the OsEBF2 gene may be to reduce the content of ET in rice by inhibiting the expression of ethylene response factor genes. This study revealed that OsEBF2 is an F-box protein that positively regulates the rice resistance to BPH and can be used as an effective target gene for rice BPH resistance breeding.
