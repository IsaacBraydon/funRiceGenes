j.1438-8677.2008.00156.x.pdf	OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice	2009	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agriculture University, Chengdu, China.	Heading date is an important agronomic trait in rice. A rice mutant with a late heading date and no photoperiodic sensitivity in long or short day conditions was obtained from rice T-DNA insertion mutants in Zhonghua11 (ZH11). Through isolation and analysis of the flanking sequence of the T-NDA insertion site, the target sequence of insertion was obtained and found to locate in AP003296, the sequence accession number of rice chromosome 1 of RGP (http://rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp). The putative amino acid sequences of this target gene are homologous to the Arabidopsis protein ELF3 encoded by an early flowering gene. The rice target gene orthologous to Arabidopsis ELF3 is named OsEF3; this encodes a putative nematode responsive protein-like protein. OsEF3 has pleiotropic effects in rice that differ from the effects of Arabidopsis ELF3, which only affects biological rhythms. OsEF3 regulates heading date by influencing the BVG stage and does not affect photoperiodic sensitivity, which suggests that the OsEF3 gene may be involved in an autonomous pathway in rice. OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation.
journal.pone.0043705.pdf	OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering	2012	PLoS One	Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.	Arabidopsis thaliana early flowering 3 (ELF3) as a zeitnehmer (time taker) is responsible for generation of circadian rhythm and regulation of photoperiodic flowering. There are two orthologs (OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2) of ELF3 in rice (Oryza sativa), but their roles have not yet been fully identified. Here, we performed a functional characterization of OsELF3-1 and revealed it plays a more predominant role than OsELF3-2 in rice heading. Our results suggest OsELF3-1 can affect rice circadian systems via positive regulation of OsLHY expression and negative regulation of OsPRR1, OsPRR37, OsPRR73 and OsPRR95 expression. In addition, OsELF3-1 is involved in blue light signaling by activating early heading date 1 (Ehd1) expression to promote rice flowering under short-day (SD) conditions. Moreover, OsELF3-1 suppresses a flowering repressor grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7) to indirectly accelerate flowering under long-day (LD) conditions. Taken together, our results indicate OsELF3-1 is essential for circadian regulation and photoperiodic flowering in rice.
NA	A clock regulatory module is required for salt tolerance and control of heading date in rice	2021	Plant Cell Environ	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	The circadian clock plays multiple roles in plant stress responses and developmental transition phases. Nevertheless, the underlying molecular mechanisms and individual clock components that coordinately regulate important agronomic traits of rice such as salt tolerance and heading date remain to be elucidated. Here, we identify a rice ternary repressive protein complex composed of OsELF4a, OsELF3-1 and OsLUX, which was designated as OsEC1 in analogy to a similar complex in Arabidopsis. OsELF4a physically interacts with OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2 in nucleus, whilst OsELF3-1 rather than OsELF3-2 strongly interacts with OsLUX, a Myb-domain containing transcriptional factor. Phenotypic analyses show a role for this complex in heading and salt tolerance. The loss-of-function mutants of OsEC1 exhibit lower survival rate under salt stress and late heading date. Transcriptomic profiling together with biochemical assays identified the GIGANTEA homologue OsGI as a direct transcriptional target of OsEC1. Notably, the osgi-101 mutant, generated by CRISPR/Cas9, is salt tolerant and exhibits early heading date in long day conditions. Together, our findings characterized a transcriptional module in rice composed by the OsEC1 repressing OsGI, which links the circadian clock with salt tolerance and control of heading date.
