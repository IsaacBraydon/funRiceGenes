Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering	There are two orthologs (OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2) of ELF3 in rice (Oryza sativa), but their roles have not yet been fully identified
Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering	Here, we performed a functional characterization of OsELF3-1 and revealed it plays a more predominant role than OsELF3-2 in rice heading
APIP6	OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	OsELF3-2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis ELF3, interacts with the E3 ligase APIP6 and negatively regulates immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice	OsELF3-2 interacts with APIP6 and negatively regulates basal resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae.
Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	Genetic relationship between phytochromes and OsELF3-1 reveals the mode of regulation for the suppression of phytochrome signaling in rice.	 The rice genome carries two ELF3 homologs, namely OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2
Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	Genetic relationship between phytochromes and OsELF3-1 reveals the mode of regulation for the suppression of phytochrome signaling in rice.	 A comparison between the oself3-1 mutant and transgenic rice lines in which OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2 are simultaneously silenced uncovered a role for OsELF3-1 in addition to the canonical ELF3 function as an evolutionarily conserved role for a nighttime repressor that regulates the rice circadian clock
OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	OsELF4a	A clock regulatory module is required for salt tolerance and control of heading date in rice	 OsELF4a physically interacts with OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2 in nucleus, whilst OsELF3-1 rather than OsELF3-2 strongly interacts with OsLUX, a Myb-domain containing transcriptional factor
