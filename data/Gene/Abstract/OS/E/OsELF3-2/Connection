Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1	OsEF3|OsELF3-2	OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering	 There are two orthologs (OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2) of ELF3 in rice (Oryza sativa), but their roles have not yet been fully identified
Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1	OsEF3|OsELF3-2	OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering	 Here, we performed a functional characterization of OsELF3-1 and revealed it plays a more predominant role than OsELF3-2 in rice heading
APIP6	OsEF3|OsELF3-2	OsELF3-2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis ELF3, interacts with the E3 ligase APIP6 and negatively regulates immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice	OsELF3-2 interacts with APIP6 and negatively regulates basal resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae.
