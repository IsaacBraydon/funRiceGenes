OsEF3|OsELF3-2	grain weight	OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice	 OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
OsEF3|OsELF3-2	root	OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice	 OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
OsEF3|OsELF3-2	heading date	OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice	 OsEF3 regulates heading date by influencing the BVG stage and does not affect photoperiodic sensitivity, which suggests that the OsEF3 gene may be involved in an autonomous pathway in rice
OsEF3|OsELF3-2	grain	OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice	 OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
OsEF3|OsELF3-2	root development	OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice	 OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
OsEF3|OsELF3-2	cell division	OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice	 OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
OsEF3|OsELF3-2	cell elongation	OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice	 OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
