OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	grain weight	OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice	 OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	root	OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice	 OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	heading date	OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice	 OsEF3 regulates heading date by influencing the BVG stage and does not affect photoperiodic sensitivity, which suggests that the OsEF3 gene may be involved in an autonomous pathway in rice
OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	grain	OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice	 OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	root development	OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice	 OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	cell division	OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice	 OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	cell elongation	OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice	 OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	immunity	OsELF3-2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis ELF3, interacts with the E3 ligase APIP6 and negatively regulates immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice	Functional analysis shows that OsELF3-2 negatively regulates immunity against M. oryzae in rice.
OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	blast resistance	OsELF3-2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis ELF3, interacts with the E3 ligase APIP6 and negatively regulates immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice	All together, these results demonstrate that OsELF3-2 negatively regulates blast resistance in rice
OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	resistance	OsELF3-2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis ELF3, interacts with the E3 ligase APIP6 and negatively regulates immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice	All together, these results demonstrate that OsELF3-2 negatively regulates blast resistance in rice
