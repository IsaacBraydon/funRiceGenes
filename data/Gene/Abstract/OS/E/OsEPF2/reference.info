Stomata are microscopic pores on the surface of leaves through which water as vapor passes to the atmosphere and CO2 uptake for the photosynthesis. The signaling peptides of the epidermal patterning factor (EPF) family regulate stomatal development and density in Arabidopsis. Several putative homologs of EPF/EPFL exist in rice genome. To understand their possible involvement in stomatal formation, in this study we generated a series of transgenic lines including reporter promoter fusions, down-regulation and overexpression and demonstrated drastic differences in stomatal densities between different genotypes, as elevated expression of OsEPF1 or OsEPF2 greatly reduced stomatal density in rice, whereas ectopic overexpression of either OsEPF1 or OsEPF2 significantly decreased the high stomatal frequency of both mutant lines of epf2 and epf1epf2 Arabidopsis. Conversely, knocking down OsEPFL9 transcription conferred transgenic plants with fewer stomata than WT in rice, whereas overexpressing rice OsEPFL9 gene could cause excessive production of stomata in Arabidopsis. In conclusion, homologs of EPF/EPFL regulate stomatal development in a generally highly conserved way yet there exist function distinctions between dicot and monocot plants.
