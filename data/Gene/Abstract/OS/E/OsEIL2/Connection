OsEIL2	OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 Regulate Ethylene Response of Roots and Coleoptiles and Negatively Affect Salt Tolerance in Rice.	Furthermore, this negative regulation by MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in salt tolerance is likely in part attributable to the direct regulation of OsHKT2;1 expression and Na+ uptake in roots
OsBURP16	OsEIL2	Ethylene insensitive3-like2 (OsEIL2) confers stress sensitivity by regulating OsBURP16, the ¦Â subunit of polygalacturonase (PG1¦Â-like) subfamily gene in rice.	Ethylene insensitive3-like2 (OsEIL2) confers stress sensitivity by regulating OsBURP16, the ¦Â subunit of polygalacturonase (PG1¦Â-like) subfamily gene in rice.
OsBURP16	OsEIL2	Ethylene insensitive3-like2 (OsEIL2) confers stress sensitivity by regulating OsBURP16, the ¦Â subunit of polygalacturonase (PG1¦Â-like) subfamily gene in rice.	 We further found that OsEIL2 functions upstream of OsBURP14 and OsBURP16
OsBURP16	OsEIL2	Ethylene insensitive3-like2 (OsEIL2) confers stress sensitivity by regulating OsBURP16, the ¦Â subunit of polygalacturonase (PG1¦Â-like) subfamily gene in rice.	 OsEIL2 binds directly to the promoter of OsBURP14 and OsBURP16 and activates their transcript levels
OsEBF1	OsEIL2	Phytochrome B mediates dim-light-reduced insect resistance by promoting the ethylene pathway in rice.	 In addition, we found that nuclear OsphyB stabilizes Ethylene Insensitive Like2 (OsEIL2) by competitively interacting with EIN3 Binding F-Box Protein (OsEBF1) to enhance ET signaling in rice, which contrasts with previous findings that phyB blocks ET signaling by facilitating Ethylene Insensitive3 (EIN3) degradation in other plant species
