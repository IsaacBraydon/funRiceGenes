Ethylene and jasmonic acid (JA) have been proposed as key compounds for wound signaling in plants. In Arabidopsis, ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3), which is an essential transcription factor for ethylene signaling, is regulated at the post-transcriptional level, while transcriptional regulation of EIN3 or EIN3-LIKE (EIL) genes has not been well documented. The expression of 6 rice EIL genes (OsEIL1-6) was analyzed and only OsEIL1 and 2 were found to be wound-inducible EIL. OsEIL2 was also induced by JA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that recombinant OsEIL1 and 2 proteins bound to specific DNA sequences that are recognized by a wound-inducible tobacco EIL. Accumulation of OsEIL1 and 2 transcripts reached a maximum at 1 and 0.5 h after wounding, respectively, and the corresponding DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts of rice leaves was increased at 1 h after wounding. Candidates for OsEIL-target genes were selected by microarray analysis of wounded rice and by promoter sequence analyses of wound-inducible genes identified by microarray analysis. In OsEIL1- and/or 2-suppressed rice plants, the expression of at least four of 18 candidate genes analyzed was down-regulated. These results indicate the importance of inducible OsEILs in wound signaling in rice.
NA	MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 Regulate Ethylene Response of Roots and Coleoptiles and Negatively Affect Salt Tolerance in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	CITY: Beijng China [CN] Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, CAS University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.	Ethylene plays important roles in plant growth and development and stress responses. The ethylene signaling pathway has been extensively studied mainly in Arabidopsis. Howeverï¼Œthe molecular mechanism of ethylene signaling is largely unknown in rice. Previously, we have isolated a set of rice ethylene-response mutants. Here, we characterized the mutant mhz6. Through map-based cloning, we found that MHZ6 encodes OsEIL1, a rice homolog of EIN3, which is the master transcriptional regulator of ethylene signaling in Arabidopsis. Disruption of MHZ6/OsEIL1 caused ethylene insensitivity mainly in roots, whereas silencing of the closely-related OsEIL2 led to ethylene insensitivity mainly in coleoptiles of etiolated seedlings. This organ-specific functional divergence is different from the functional features of EIN3 and EIL1, both of which mediate the incomplete ethylene-responses of Arabidopsis etiolated seedlings. In Arabidopsis, EIN3 and EIL1 play positive roles in plant salt tolerance. In rice, however, lack of MHZ6/OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 functions improves salt tolerance, whereas the overexpression lines exhibits salt hypersensitivity at seedling stage, indicating that MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 negatively regulate salt tolerance in rice. Furthermore, this negative regulation by MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in salt tolerance is likely in part attributable to the direct regulation of OsHKT2;1 expression and Na+ uptake in roots. Additionally, MHZ6/OsEIL1 overexpression promotes grain size and thousand-grain-weight. Together, our study provides insights for functional diversification of MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in ethylene response and finds a novel mode of ethylene-regulated salt stress response which could be helpful for engineering salt-tolerant crops.
NA	Ethylene insensitive3-like2 (OsEIL2) confers stress sensitivity by regulating OsBURP16, the ¦Â subunit of polygalacturonase (PG1¦Â-like) subfamily gene in rice.	2019	Plant Sci	Tongji University, No. 1239 Siping Road, Shanghai, 200092, China; Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Environment, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 300 Fenglin Road, Shanghai, 200032, China; University of Chinese Academy of Science, China.	The transcription factors EIN3 (ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE 3) and EILs (EIN3-Likes) play important roles in plant development and defense responses; however, their mechanism in these processes remain unclear. Here, we report that OsEIL2, an EIN3-like transcription factor from rice (Oryza sativa), plays important roles in abiotic stress and leaf senescence. OsEIL2 is a nuclear-localized protein with transactivation activity in the C-terminus (amino acids 344-583) and can be induced by NaCl, polyethylene glycol (PEG), dark, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Transgenic plants of overexpressing OsEIL2 (OsEIL2-OX) show reduced tolerance to salt and drought stress compared with the controls. While the transgenic plants of overexpressing OsEIL2-RNA interference (OsEIL2-RNAi) exhibit enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stress compared with the controls. Moreover, seedlings of OsEIL2-overexpressing transgenic plants exhibit delayed leaf development and an accelerated dark-induced senescence phenotype, whereas OsEIL2-RNAi plants display the opposite phenotype. We further found that OsEIL2 functions upstream of OsBURP14 and OsBURP16. OsBURP14 and OsBURP16 are the members of the ¦Â subunit of polygalacturonase subfamilies. OsBURP16 overexpression reduced pectin content and cell adhesion and increased abiotic stress sensitivity in rice. OsEIL2 binds directly to the promoter of OsBURP14 and OsBURP16 and activates their transcript levels. We also found that OsEIL2 overexpression decreased the pectin content by increasing polygalacturonase (PG) activity. Taken together, these results revealed a new mechanism of OsEIL2 in abiotic stress responses. These findings provide new insights into plant resistance to abiotic stress.
