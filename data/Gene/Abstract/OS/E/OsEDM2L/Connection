DTD|EAT1	OsEDM2L	OsEDM2L mediates m 6 A of EAT1 transcript for proper alternative splicing and polyadenylation regulating rice tapetal degradation	OsEDM2L mediates m 6 A of EAT1 transcript for proper alternative splicing and polyadenylation regulating rice tapetal degradation
DTD|EAT1	OsEDM2L	OsEDM2L mediates m 6 A of EAT1 transcript for proper alternative splicing and polyadenylation regulating rice tapetal degradation	 OsEDM2L interacts with the transcription factors bHLH142 and TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION to regulate the expression of ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 (EAT1), a positive regulator of tapetal PCD
DTD|EAT1	OsEDM2L	OsEDM2L mediates m 6 A of EAT1 transcript for proper alternative splicing and polyadenylation regulating rice tapetal degradation	 Mutation of OsEDM2L altered the transcriptomic m6 A landscape, and caused a distinct m6 A modification of the EAT1 transcript leading to dysregulation of its alternative splicing and polyadenylation, followed by suppression of the EAT1 target genes OsAP25 and OsAP37 for tapetal PCD
OsAP25	OsEDM2L	OsEDM2L mediates m 6 A of EAT1 transcript for proper alternative splicing and polyadenylation regulating rice tapetal degradation	 Mutation of OsEDM2L altered the transcriptomic m6 A landscape, and caused a distinct m6 A modification of the EAT1 transcript leading to dysregulation of its alternative splicing and polyadenylation, followed by suppression of the EAT1 target genes OsAP25 and OsAP37 for tapetal PCD
OsAP37	OsEDM2L	OsEDM2L mediates m 6 A of EAT1 transcript for proper alternative splicing and polyadenylation regulating rice tapetal degradation	 Mutation of OsEDM2L altered the transcriptomic m6 A landscape, and caused a distinct m6 A modification of the EAT1 transcript leading to dysregulation of its alternative splicing and polyadenylation, followed by suppression of the EAT1 target genes OsAP25 and OsAP37 for tapetal PCD
