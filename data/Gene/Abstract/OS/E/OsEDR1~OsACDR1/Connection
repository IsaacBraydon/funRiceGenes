OsEDR1|OsACDR1|OsMAPKKK1|SPL3	OsMPK6|OsMPK4	Pathogen-inducible OsMPKK10.2-OsMPK6 cascade phosphorylates the Raf-like kinase OsEDR1 and inhibits its scaffold function to promote rice disease resistance	 Interestingly, activated OsMPK6 phosphorylates OsEDR1 at S861, which destabilizes OsEDR1 and thus releases the inhibition of OsMPKK10
