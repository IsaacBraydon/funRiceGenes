OsAP2-39	OsWRKY55|WRKY55a|WRKY55b	Rice Transcription Factor OsWRKY55 Is Involved in the Drought Response and Regulation of Plant Growth 	 In addition, based on a dual luciferase reporter assay, OsWRKY55 was shown to bind to the promoter of OsAP2-39 through a yeast one-hybrid assay and positively regulate OsAP2-39 expression
OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	OsWRKY55|WRKY55a|WRKY55b	Rice Transcription Factor OsWRKY55 Is Involved in the Drought Response and Regulation of Plant Growth 	 Through yeast two-hybrid assays, we found that OsWRKY55 interacted with four mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that could be induced by drought, including OsMPK7, OsMPK9, OsMPK20-1, and OsMPK20-4
