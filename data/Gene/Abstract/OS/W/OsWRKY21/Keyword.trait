OsWRKY21	nucleus	OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions	 OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 interact within the nucleus and both bind to the W-box in the OsPHT1;1 promoter
OsWRKY21	phosphate	OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions	OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions
OsWRKY21	Pi	OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions	 Overexpression of OsWRKY21 or OsWRKY108 led to increased Pi accumulation, resulting from elevated expression of OsPHT1;1
OsWRKY21	Pi	OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions	 By contrast, oswrky21 oswrky108 double mutants showed decreased Pi accumulation and OsPHT1;1 expression in a Pi-dependent manner
OsWRKY21	 pi 	OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions	 Overexpression of OsWRKY21 or OsWRKY108 led to increased Pi accumulation, resulting from elevated expression of OsPHT1;1
OsWRKY21	 pi 	OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions	 By contrast, oswrky21 oswrky108 double mutants showed decreased Pi accumulation and OsPHT1;1 expression in a Pi-dependent manner
OsWRKY21	transcription factor	Genome-Wide Association Study in Rice Revealed a Novel Gene in Determining Plant Height and Stem Development, by Encoding a WRKY Transcription Factor	 The peak QTN (C/T) was located in the first coding region of a group III WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY21 (LOC_Os01g60640)
OsWRKY21	height	Genome-Wide Association Study in Rice Revealed a Novel Gene in Determining Plant Height and Stem Development, by Encoding a WRKY Transcription Factor	 These data suggest the essential role of OsWRKY21 in regulation of internode elongation and plant height in rice
OsWRKY21	heading date	Genome-Wide Association Study in Rice Revealed a Novel Gene in Determining Plant Height and Stem Development, by Encoding a WRKY Transcription Factor	 Most notably, overexpressing OsWRKY21 resulted in the semi-dwarf phenotype, early heading date and short internodes compared to the wild type, while the knockout mutant plants by CRISPR/Cas9 technology yielded the opposite
OsWRKY21	plant height	Genome-Wide Association Study in Rice Revealed a Novel Gene in Determining Plant Height and Stem Development, by Encoding a WRKY Transcription Factor	 These data suggest the essential role of OsWRKY21 in regulation of internode elongation and plant height in rice
OsWRKY21	internode elongation	Genome-Wide Association Study in Rice Revealed a Novel Gene in Determining Plant Height and Stem Development, by Encoding a WRKY Transcription Factor	 These data suggest the essential role of OsWRKY21 in regulation of internode elongation and plant height in rice
