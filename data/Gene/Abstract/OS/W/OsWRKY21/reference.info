NA	OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Plant Phosphate Transporter 1 (PHT1) proteins, probably the only influx transporters for phosphate (Pi) uptake, are partially degraded on sufficient Pi levels to prevent excessive Pi accumulation. Therefore, the basal/constitutive expression level of PHT1 genes is vital for maintaining Pi uptake under Pi-replete conditions. Rice (Oryza sativa) OsPHT1;1 is a unique gene as it is highly expressed and not responsive to Pi, however the mechanism for maintaining its basal/constitutive expression remains unknown. Using biochemical and genetic approaches, we identified and functionally characterised the transcription factors maintaining the basal/constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1. OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 interact within the nucleus and both bind to the W-box in the OsPHT1;1 promoter. Overexpression of OsWRKY21 or OsWRKY108 led to increased Pi accumulation, resulting from elevated expression of OsPHT1;1. By contrast, oswrky21 oswrky108 double mutants showed decreased Pi accumulation and OsPHT1;1 expression in a Pi-dependent manner. Moreover, similar to ospht1;1 mutants, plants expressing the OsWRKY21-SRDX fusion protein (a chimeric dominant suppressor) were impaired in Pi accumulation in Pi-replete roots, accompanied by downregulation of OsPHT1;1 expression. Our findings demonstrated that rice WRKY transcription factors function redundantly to promote Pi uptake by activating OsPHT1;1 expression under Pi-replete conditions, and represent a novel pathway independent of the central Pi signalling system.
NA	Genome-Wide Association Study in Rice Revealed a Novel Gene in Determining Plant Height and Stem Development, by Encoding a WRKY Transcription Factor	2021	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory for Conservation & Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, College of Agriculture, Guangxi University, Nanning 530004, China.	Semi-dwarfism is a main agronomic trait in crop breeding. In this study, we performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) and identified a new quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN) for rice shoot length. The peak QTN (C/T) was located in the first coding region of a group III WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY21 (LOC_Os01g60640). Interestingly, further haplotype analysis showed that C/T difference only existed in the indica group but not in the japonica group, resulting in significant differences in plant height among the different indica rice varieties. OsWRKY21 was expressed in embryo, radicle, shoots, leaves, and stems. Most notably, overexpressing OsWRKY21 resulted in the semi-dwarf phenotype, early heading date and short internodes compared to the wild type, while the knockout mutant plants by CRISPR/Cas9 technology yielded the opposite. The overexpressing lines exhibited the decreased length of the cells near sclerenchyma epidermis, accompanied with the lower levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and gibberellin 3 (GA3), but increased levels of the abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA) in the internodes at heading stage. Moreover, the semi-dwarf phenotype could be fully rescued by exogenous GA3 application at seedling stage. The RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the differential expression levels of genes in development and the stress responses in rice, including GA metabolism (GA20ox2, GA2ox6, and YABY1) and cell wall biosynthesis (CesA4, 7, and 9) and regulation (MYB103L). These data suggest the essential role of OsWRKY21 in regulation of internode elongation and plant height in rice.
NA	OsDREB2B, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, negatively regulates plant height by conferring GA metabolism in rice.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Jilin Provincial Engineering Laboratory of Plant Genetic Improvement, College of Plant Science, Jilin University, Changchun, China.	The AP2/ERF family is a large group of plant-specific transcription factors that play an important role in many biological processes, such as growth, development, and abiotic stress responses. OsDREB2B, a dehydration responsive factor (DRE/CRT) in the DREB subgroup of the AP2/ERF family, is associated with abiotic stress responses, such as cold, drought, salt, and heat stress, in Arabidopsis or rice. However, its role in regulating plant growth and development in rice is unclear. In this study, we reported a new function of OsDREB2B, which negatively regulates plant height in rice. Compared with wild type (WT), OsDREB2B-overexpressing (OE) rice exhibited dwarf phenotypes, such as reduction in plant height, internode length, and seed length, as well as grain yield, while the knockout mutants developed by CRISPR/Cas9 technology exhibited similar phenotypes. Spatial expression analysis revealed that OsDREB2B was highly expressed in the leaf sheaths. Under exogenous GA(3) application, OsDREB2B expression was induced, and the length of the second leaf sheath of the OsDREB2B-OE lines recovered to that of the WT. OsDREB2B localized to the nucleus of the rice protoplast acted as a transcription activator and upregulated OsAP2-39 by directly binding to its promoter. OsDREB2B-OE lines reduced endogenous bioactive GA levels by downregulating seven GA biosynthesis genes and upregulating eight GA deactivation genes but not GA signaling genes. The yeast two-hybrid assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay showed that OsDREB2B interacted with OsWRKY21. In summary, our study suggests that OsDREB2B plays a negative role in rice growth and development by regulating GA metabolic gene expression, which is mediated by OsAP2-39 and OsWRKY21, thereby reducing GA content and rice plant height.
