OsPR1a|OsSCP	OsWRKY114	Rice transcription factor WRKY114 directly regulates the expression of OsPR1a and Chitinase to enhance resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae	 By using genetic- and cell-based functional analyses, we showed OsWRKY114 directly associates with the promoters of OsPR1a and Chitinase and increases the promoter activities
OsPR1a|OsSCP	OsWRKY114	Rice transcription factor WRKY114 directly regulates the expression of OsPR1a and Chitinase to enhance resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae	 These results suggest that OsWRKY114 enhances the innate immunity of Asian rice against Xoo through direct activation of defense genes that include OsPR1a and chtinase
