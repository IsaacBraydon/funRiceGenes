OsWRKY114	 The overexpression of OsWRKY114 significantly increased drought sensitivity in rice, which resulted in a lower survival rate after drought stress |  The expression levels of PYR/PYL/RCAR genes, such as OsPYL2 and OsPYL10 that confer drought tolerance through stomatal closure, were also markedly lower in the OsWRKY114-overexpressing plants	 The overexpression of OsWRKY114 significantly increased drought sensitivity in rice, which resulted in a lower survival rate after drought stress
