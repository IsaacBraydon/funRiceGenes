OsWRKY63	salinity	The OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B module regulates chilling tolerance in rice.	 OsWRKY63 was expressed in all rice tissues and was induced under cold stress, dehydration stress, high salinity stress, and ABA treatment
OsWRKY63	tolerance	The OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B module regulates chilling tolerance in rice.	 Thus, our study suggests that OsWRKY63 negatively regulates chilling tolerance in a model of the OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B transcriptional regulatory cascade in rice
OsWRKY63	nucleus	The OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B module regulates chilling tolerance in rice.	 OsWRKY63 localized in the nucleus plays a role as a transcription repressor and downregulates many cold stress-related genes and reactive oxygen species scavenging-related genes
OsWRKY63	cold stress	The OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B module regulates chilling tolerance in rice.	 OsWRKY63 was expressed in all rice tissues and was induced under cold stress, dehydration stress, high salinity stress, and ABA treatment
OsWRKY63	cold stress	The OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B module regulates chilling tolerance in rice.	 OsWRKY63 localized in the nucleus plays a role as a transcription repressor and downregulates many cold stress-related genes and reactive oxygen species scavenging-related genes
OsWRKY63	ABA	The OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B module regulates chilling tolerance in rice.	 OsWRKY63 was expressed in all rice tissues and was induced under cold stress, dehydration stress, high salinity stress, and ABA treatment
OsWRKY63	cold	The OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B module regulates chilling tolerance in rice.	 OsWRKY63 was expressed in all rice tissues and was induced under cold stress, dehydration stress, high salinity stress, and ABA treatment

OsWRKY63	salinity stress	The OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B module regulates chilling tolerance in rice.	 OsWRKY63 was expressed in all rice tissues and was induced under cold stress, dehydration stress, high salinity stress, and ABA treatment
OsWRKY63	chilling	The OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B module regulates chilling tolerance in rice.	 Thus, our study suggests that OsWRKY63 negatively regulates chilling tolerance in a model of the OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B transcriptional regulatory cascade in rice
OsWRKY63	transcriptional regulator	The OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B module regulates chilling tolerance in rice.	 Thus, our study suggests that OsWRKY63 negatively regulates chilling tolerance in a model of the OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B transcriptional regulatory cascade in rice
OsWRKY63	 ABA 	The OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B module regulates chilling tolerance in rice.	 OsWRKY63 was expressed in all rice tissues and was induced under cold stress, dehydration stress, high salinity stress, and ABA treatment
OsWRKY63	reactive oxygen species	The OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B module regulates chilling tolerance in rice.	 OsWRKY63 localized in the nucleus plays a role as a transcription repressor and downregulates many cold stress-related genes and reactive oxygen species scavenging-related genes
