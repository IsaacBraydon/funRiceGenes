Rice (Oryza sativa) is sensitive to low temperatures, which affects the yield and quality of rice. Therefore, uncovering the molecular mechanisms behind chilling tolerance is a critical task for improving cold tolerance in rice cultivars. Here, we report that OsWRKY63, a WRKY transcription factor with an unknown function, negatively regulates chilling tolerance in rice. OsWRKY63-overexpressing lines rendered rice more sensitive to cold stress. Conversely, using a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing approach, OsWRKY63-knockout mutants led to increased chilling tolerance. OsWRKY63 was expressed in all rice tissues and was induced under cold stress, dehydration stress, high salinity stress, and ABA treatment. OsWRKY63 localized in the nucleus plays a role as a transcription repressor and downregulates many cold stress-related genes and reactive oxygen species scavenging-related genes. Molecular, biochemical, and genetic assays showed that OsWRKY76 is a direct target gene of OsWRKY63 and that its expression was suppressed by OsWRKY63. OsWRKY76-knockout lines had dramatically decreased cold tolerance, and they repressed the cold-induced expression of five OsDREB1 genes. OsWRKY76 interacted with OsbHLH148, transactivating the expression of OsDREB1B to enhance chilling tolerance in rice. Thus, our study suggests that OsWRKY63 negatively regulates chilling tolerance in a model of the OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B transcriptional regulatory cascade in rice.
