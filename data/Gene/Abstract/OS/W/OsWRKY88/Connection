OsWRKY47	OsWRKY88	WRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades in rice are involved in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance 	 In the second transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of OsWRKY10, and OsWRKY88 acted upstream
OsWRKY6	OsWRKY88	The OsWRKY6 transcriptional cascade functions in basal defense and Xa1-mediated defense of rice against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	 Two OsWRKY6 RNAi knockdown lines showed significantly reduced defense even against an incompatible Xoo infection, and the expression of OsWRKY6 was not regulated by OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY88
OsWRKY102	OsWRKY88	Binding of stress-responsive OsWRKY proteins through WRKYGQK heptapeptide residue with the promoter region of two rice blast disease resistance genes Pi2 and Pi54 is important for development of blast resistance.	 The WRKY proteins (OsWRKY88 and OsWRKY102), whose transcript levels decrease when drought and blast stresses are overlapped, interact with the two resistance genes mostly involving the residues of the zinc finger structure
