OsWRKY74	nitrogen	OsWRKY74, a WRKY transcription factor, modulates tolerance to phosphate starvation in rice.	In addition, OsWRKY74 may also be involved in the response to deficiencies in iron (Fe) and nitrogen (N) as well as cold stress in rice
OsWRKY74	tolerance	OsWRKY74, a WRKY transcription factor, modulates tolerance to phosphate starvation in rice.	Here, we demonstrated that a rice OsWRKY74 belonging to group III of the WRKY transcription factor family was involved in tolerance to phosphate (Pi) starvation
OsWRKY74	tolerance	OsWRKY74, a WRKY transcription factor, modulates tolerance to phosphate starvation in rice.	Overexpression of OsWRKY74 significantly enhanced tolerance to Pi starvation, whereas transgenic lines with down-regulation of OsWRKY74 were sensitive to Pi starvation
OsWRKY74	transcription factor	OsWRKY74, a WRKY transcription factor, modulates tolerance to phosphate starvation in rice.	Here, we demonstrated that a rice OsWRKY74 belonging to group III of the WRKY transcription factor family was involved in tolerance to phosphate (Pi) starvation
OsWRKY74	cold stress	OsWRKY74, a WRKY transcription factor, modulates tolerance to phosphate starvation in rice.	In addition, OsWRKY74 may also be involved in the response to deficiencies in iron (Fe) and nitrogen (N) as well as cold stress in rice
OsWRKY74	cold stress	OsWRKY74, a WRKY transcription factor, modulates tolerance to phosphate starvation in rice.	These findings highlight the role of OsWRKY74 in modulation of Pi homeostasis and potential crosstalk between P starvation and Fe starvation, and cold stress in rice
OsWRKY74	stress	OsWRKY74, a WRKY transcription factor, modulates tolerance to phosphate starvation in rice.	In addition, OsWRKY74 may also be involved in the response to deficiencies in iron (Fe) and nitrogen (N) as well as cold stress in rice
