NA	WRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades in rice are involved in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance 	2020	J Exp Bot	  National Institute of Agricultural Science, Rural Development Administration, Jeonju, Korea.	WRKY proteins play essential roles as negative or positive regulators of pathogen defense. This study explored the roles of different OsWRKY proteins in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) infection in rice. Assays of disease in OsWRKY10KD and OsWRKY88KD lines following infection with an incompatible Xoo race, which induced Xa1-mediated resistance in wild-type plants, showed that OsWRKY10 and OsWRKY88 were positive regulators of Xa1-mediated resistance. OsWRKY10 also acted as a positive regulator in basal defense by directly or indirectly activating transcription of defense-related genes. OsWRKY10 activated the OsPR1a promoter by binding to specific WRKY binding sites. Two transcriptional regulatory cascades of OsWRKY10 were identified in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance. In the first transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of OsWRKY10 whereas OsWRKY51 acted upstream. OsWRKY10 activated OsPR1a in two distinct ways: by binding to its promoter and, at the same time, by indirect activation through OsWRKY47. In the second transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of OsWRKY10, and OsWRKY88 acted upstream. These OsWRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades played important roles in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance to enable the mounting of a rapid immune response against pathogens. 
NA	The transcription factor OsWRKY10 inhibits phosphate uptake via suppressing OsPHT1;2 expression under phosphate-replete condition in rice.	2022	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Plants have evolved delicate systems for stimulating or inhibiting inorganic phosphate (Pi) uptake in response to the fluctuating Pi availability in soil. However, the negative regulators inhibiting Pi uptake at the transcriptional level are widely unexplored. Here, we functionally characterized a transcription factor in rice (Oryza sativa), OsWRKY10. OsWRKY10 encodes a nucleus-localized protein and showed preferential tissue localization. Knockout of OsWRKY10 led to increased Pi uptake and accumulation under Pi-replete condition. In accordance with this phenotype, OsWRKY10 was transcriptionally induced by Pi, and a subset of Phosphate Transporter 1 (PHT1) genes were up-regulated upon its mutation, suggesting that OsWRKY10 is a transcriptional repressor in Pi uptake. Moreover, rice plants expressing the OsWRKY10-VP16 fusion protein (a dominant transcriptional activator) accumulated even more Pi than oswrky10. Several lines of biochemical evidence demonstrated that OsWRKY10 directly suppressed OsPHT1;2 expression. Genetic analysis showed that OsPHT1;2 was responsible for the increased Pi accumulation in oswrky10. Furthermore, during Pi starvation, OsWRKY10 protein was degraded through the 26S proteasome. Altogether, the OsWRKY10-OsPHT1;2 module represents a crucial loop in the Pi signaling network in rice, inhibiting Pi uptake when Pi is ample in environment.
