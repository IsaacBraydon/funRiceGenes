NA	WRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades in rice are involved in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance 	2020	J Exp Bot	  National Institute of Agricultural Science, Rural Development Administration, Jeonju, Korea.	WRKY proteins play essential roles as negative or positive regulators of pathogen defense. This study explored the roles of different OsWRKY proteins in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) infection in rice. Assays of disease in OsWRKY10KD and OsWRKY88KD lines following infection with an incompatible Xoo race, which induced Xa1-mediated resistance in wild-type plants, showed that OsWRKY10 and OsWRKY88 were positive regulators of Xa1-mediated resistance. OsWRKY10 also acted as a positive regulator in basal defense by directly or indirectly activating transcription of defense-related genes. OsWRKY10 activated the OsPR1a promoter by binding to specific WRKY binding sites. Two transcriptional regulatory cascades of OsWRKY10 were identified in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance. In the first transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of OsWRKY10 whereas OsWRKY51 acted upstream. OsWRKY10 activated OsPR1a in two distinct ways: by binding to its promoter and, at the same time, by indirect activation through OsWRKY47. In the second transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of OsWRKY10, and OsWRKY88 acted upstream. These OsWRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades played important roles in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance to enable the mounting of a rapid immune response against pathogens. 
NA	The transcription factor OsWRKY10 inhibits phosphate uptake via suppressing OsPHT1;2 expression under phosphate-replete condition in rice.	2022	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Plants have evolved delicate systems for stimulating or inhibiting inorganic phosphate (Pi) uptake in response to the fluctuating Pi availability in soil. However, the negative regulators inhibiting Pi uptake at the transcriptional level are widely unexplored. Here, we functionally characterized a transcription factor in rice (Oryza sativa), OsWRKY10. OsWRKY10 encodes a nucleus-localized protein and showed preferential tissue localization. Knockout of OsWRKY10 led to increased Pi uptake and accumulation under Pi-replete condition. In accordance with this phenotype, OsWRKY10 was transcriptionally induced by Pi, and a subset of Phosphate Transporter 1 (PHT1) genes were up-regulated upon its mutation, suggesting that OsWRKY10 is a transcriptional repressor in Pi uptake. Moreover, rice plants expressing the OsWRKY10-VP16 fusion protein (a dominant transcriptional activator) accumulated even more Pi than oswrky10. Several lines of biochemical evidence demonstrated that OsWRKY10 directly suppressed OsPHT1;2 expression. Genetic analysis showed that OsPHT1;2 was responsible for the increased Pi accumulation in oswrky10. Furthermore, during Pi starvation, OsWRKY10 protein was degraded through the 26S proteasome. Altogether, the OsWRKY10-OsPHT1;2 module represents a crucial loop in the Pi signaling network in rice, inhibiting Pi uptake when Pi is ample in environment.
NA	OsWRKY10 extensively activates multiple rice diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis to enhance rice blast resistance.	2023	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, 611130, China.	Phytoalexin is the main chemical weapon against disease pathogens in plants. Rice produces a number of phytoalexins to defend pathogens, most of which belong to diterpenoid phytoalexins. Three biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and a few non-cluster genes are responsible for rice diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis. The corresponding regulatory mechanism of these phytoalexins in response to pathogen challenges still remains unclear. Here we identified a transcription factor, OsWRKY10, positively regulating rice diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis. Knockout mutants of OsWRKY10 obtained by the CRISPR/Cas9 technology are more susceptible to Magnaporthe oryzae infection, while overexpression of OsWRKY10 enhances resistance to rice blast. Further analysis reveals that overexpression of OsWRKY10 increases accumulation of multiple rice diterpenoid phytoalexins and expression of genes in three BGCs and non-clustered genes in response to M. oryzae infection. Knockout of OsWRKY10 impairs upregulation of rice diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis gene expression by blast pathogen and CuCl(2) treatment. OsWRKY10 directly binds to the W-boxes or W-box-like elements (WLEs) of rice diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis gene promoters to regulate the corresponding gene expression. This study identified an extensive regulator (OsWRKY10) with the broad transcriptional regulation on rice diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis, providing the insight to characterize regulation of rice chemical defense for improving disease resistance.
