OsPR1a|OsSCP	OsWRKY10	WRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades in rice are involved in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance 	 OsWRKY10 activated the OsPR1a promoter by binding to specific WRKY binding sites
OsPR1a|OsSCP	OsWRKY10	WRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades in rice are involved in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance 	 OsWRKY10 activated OsPR1a in two distinct ways: by binding to its promoter and, at the same time, by indirect activation through OsWRKY47
OsWRKY10	OsWRKY47	WRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades in rice are involved in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance 	 In the first transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of OsWRKY10 whereas OsWRKY51 acted upstream
