OsWRKY80	Here we demonstrate that the expression of Oryza sativa WRKY80 gene (OsWRKY80) is rapidly and strongly induced upon infection of Rhizoctonia solani,  the causal agent of rice sheath blight disease |  OsWRKY80 expression is also induced by exogenous jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET), but not by salicylic acid (SA) |  OsWRKY80-GFP is localized in the nuclei of onion epidermal cells in a  transient expression assay |  Overexpression of OsWRKY80 in rice plants significantly enhanced disease resistance to R |  Results of yeast one-hybrid assay and transient expression assay in tobacco cells have revealed that OsWRKY80 specifically binds to the promoter regions of OsWRKY4, which contain W-box (TTGAC[C/T]) or W-box like (TGAC[C/T]) cis-elements	 Overexpression of OsWRKY80 in rice plants significantly enhanced disease resistance to R	 Suppression of OsWRKY80 by RNA interference (RNAi), on the other hand, compromised disease resistance to R
