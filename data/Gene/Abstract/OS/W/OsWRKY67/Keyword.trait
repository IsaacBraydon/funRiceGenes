OsWRKY67	growth	OsWRKY67 Plays a Positive Role in Basal and XA21-Mediated Resistance in Rice.	 Overexpression of OsWRKY67 in rice confirmed enhanced disease resistance, but led to a restriction of plant growth in transgenic lines with high levels of OsWRKY67 protein
OsWRKY67	resistance	OsWRKY67 Plays a Positive Role in Basal and XA21-Mediated Resistance in Rice.	OsWRKY67 Plays a Positive Role in Basal and XA21-Mediated Resistance in Rice.
OsWRKY67	resistance	OsWRKY67 Plays a Positive Role in Basal and XA21-Mediated Resistance in Rice.	 Activation of OsWRKY67 by T-DNA tagging significantly improved the resistance against two rice pathogens, Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv
OsWRKY67	resistance	OsWRKY67 Plays a Positive Role in Basal and XA21-Mediated Resistance in Rice.	 OsWRKY67 RNAi lines significantly reduced resistance to M
OsWRKY67	resistance	OsWRKY67 Plays a Positive Role in Basal and XA21-Mediated Resistance in Rice.	 oryzae and Xoo isolates tested, and abolished XA21-mediated resistance, implying the possibility of broad-spectrum resistance from OsWRKY67
OsWRKY67	resistance	OsWRKY67 Plays a Positive Role in Basal and XA21-Mediated Resistance in Rice.	 Therefore, these results suggest that OsWRKY67 positively regulates basal and XA21-mediated resistance, and is a promising candidate for genetic improvement of disease resistance in rice
