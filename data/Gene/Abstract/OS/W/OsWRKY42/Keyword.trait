OsWRKY42|WRKY42	leaf	OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d and induces reactive oxygen species and leaf senescence in rice.	OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d and induces reactive oxygen species and leaf senescence in rice.
OsWRKY42|WRKY42	leaf	OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d and induces reactive oxygen species and leaf senescence in rice.	Our results thus suggest that OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d-mediated ROS scavenging and thereby promotes leaf senescence in rice
OsWRKY42|WRKY42	senescence	OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d and induces reactive oxygen species and leaf senescence in rice.	OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d and induces reactive oxygen species and leaf senescence in rice.
