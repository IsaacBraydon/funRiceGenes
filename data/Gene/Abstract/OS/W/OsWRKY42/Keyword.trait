OsWRKY42	leaf	OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d and induces reactive oxygen species and leaf senescence in rice.	OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d and induces reactive oxygen species and leaf senescence in rice.
OsWRKY42	leaf	OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d and induces reactive oxygen species and leaf senescence in rice.	 Our results thus suggest that OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d-mediated ROS scavenging and thereby promotes leaf senescence in rice
OsWRKY42	senescence	OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d and induces reactive oxygen species and leaf senescence in rice.	OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d and induces reactive oxygen species and leaf senescence in rice.
OsWRKY42	senescence	OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d and induces reactive oxygen species and leaf senescence in rice.	 Our results thus suggest that OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d-mediated ROS scavenging and thereby promotes leaf senescence in rice
OsWRKY42	leaf senescence	OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d and induces reactive oxygen species and leaf senescence in rice	OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d and induces reactive oxygen species and leaf senescence in rice
