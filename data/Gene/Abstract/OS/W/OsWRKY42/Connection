OsNADK1	OsWRKY42|WRKY42	The NAD kinase OsNADK1 affects the intracellular redox balance and enhances the tolerance of rice to drought.	, OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY42, showed correlated co-expression patterns with OsNADK1 in osnadk1 and the plants overexpressing or underexpressing OsNADK1, implying roles for these transcription factors in OsNADK1-mediated processes
OsMBTB32	OsWRKY42|WRKY42	OsMBTB32, a MATH-BTB domain-containing protein that interacts with OsCUL1s to regulate salt tolerance in rice.	 Moreover, OsWRKY42, a homolog of ZmWRKY114 which negatively regulates salt stress in rice, directly binds to the W-box of OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-3 promoters to promote the interaction of OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-3 with OsMBTB32 protein in rice
