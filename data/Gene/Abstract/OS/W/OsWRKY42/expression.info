OsWRKY42	 Analysis of OsWRKY42-GFP expression and its effects on transcriptional activation in maize protoplasts suggested that the OsWRKY42 protein functions as a nuclear transcriptional repressor |  Expression analysis of ROS producing and scavenging genes revealed that the metallothionein genes clustered on chromosome 12, especially OsMT1d, were strongly repressed in OsWRKY42OX plants |  An OsMT1d promoter:LUC construct was found to be repressed by OsWRKY42 overexpression in rice protoplasts	 An OsMT1d promoter:LUC construct was found to be repressed by OsWRKY42 overexpression in rice protoplasts
OsWRKY42|WRKY42	Overexpression of a cell wall damage induced transcription factor, OsWRKY42, leads to enhanced callose deposition and tolerance to salt stress but does not enhance tolerance to bacterial infection. |  Treatment with either one of the two different cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs), LipaseA and CellulaseA, induces immune responses and enhances the expression of OsWRKY42 in rice | Expression of the rice transcription factor OsWRKY42 is induced upon treatment of rice leaves with CWDEs, wounding and salt |  Overexpression of OsWRKY42 leads to enhanced callose deposition in rice and Arabidopsis but this does not enhance tolerance to bacterial infection |  Ectopic expression of OsWRKY42 results in reduced expression of cell wall damage and salt stress induced jasmonic acid biosynthesis and response genes	Overexpression of a cell wall damage induced transcription factor, OsWRKY42, leads to enhanced callose deposition and tolerance to salt stress but does not enhance tolerance to bacterial infection. |  Overexpression of OsWRKY42 leads to enhanced callose deposition in rice and Arabidopsis but this does not enhance tolerance to bacterial infection
