OsWRKY6	 The salicylic acid (SA)-inducible Oryza sativa WRKY6 (OsWRKY6) was identified as a positive regulator of Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related 10a (OsPR10a) by transient expression assays |  A physical interaction between OsWRKY6 and W-box-like element 1 (WLE1), which positively regulates OsPR10a/probenazole induced protein 1 expression, was verified inÂ vitro |  This indicates that OsWRKY6 can directly regulate OsICS1 expression and thereby increase SA concentrations |  OsWRKY6 autoregulates its own expression |  Our results suggest that OsWRKY6 positively regulates defense responses through activation of OsICS1 expression and OsWRKY6 stabilization	 By contrast, PR gene induction was compromised in transgenic OsWRKY6-RNAi lines, suggesting that OsWRKY6 is a positive regulator of defense responses
OsWRKY6	The rice protein OsWRKY6 directly activates OsWRKY45 and OsWRKY47 expression, and also activates OsPR1a and OsPR1b through the two OsWRKYs, and this transcriptional module participates in Xa1-mediated defense against the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv |  Two OsWRKY6 RNAi knockdown lines showed significantly reduced defense even against an incompatible Xoo infection, and the expression of OsWRKY6 was not regulated by OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY88	 Two OsWRKY6 RNAi knockdown lines showed significantly reduced defense even against an incompatible Xoo infection, and the expression of OsWRKY6 was not regulated by OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY88
