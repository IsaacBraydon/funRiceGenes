OsWRKY6 was isolated based on expression profiling data carried out with samples infected by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). OsWRKY6 encodes a DNA binding protein that contains one WRKY domain, a nuclear localization signal and C(2)H(2)-type zinc finger motif. OsWRKY6 is a member of the group II family of WRKY proteins. Based on the result of yeast one hybrid assay this OsWRKY6 protein binds to the typical W box ((T)TGACC/T). OsWRKY6 functions as a transcriptional activator in yeast. OsWRKY6 enhanced the expression of the reporter gene downstream of OsPR1 promoter, indicating that OsWRKY6 is a transcriptional activator in rice as well. Heterologous expression of OsWRKY6 enhanced disease resistance to pathogen. Defense-related genes were constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis transgenic lines overexpressing OsWRKY6. All together, OsWRKY6 functions as a positive transcriptional regulator of the plant defense response.
j.1744-7909.2007.00504.x.pdf	The WRKY Gene Family in Rice (Oryza sativa)	2007	J Integr Plant Biol	Bioinformatics Core, School of Life Sciences, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada 89154, USA	WRKY genes encode transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of various biological processes. These zinc-finger proteins, especially those members mediating stress responses, are uniquely expanded in plants. To facilitate the study of the evolutionary history and functions of this supergene family, we performed an exhaustive search for WRKY genes using HMMER and a Hidden Markov Model that was specifically trained for rice. This work resulted in a comprehensive list of WRKY gene models in Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and L. ssp. japonica. Mapping of these genes to individual chromosomes facilitated elimination of the redundant, leading to the identification of 98 WRKY genes in japonica and 102 in indica rice. These genes were further categorized according to the number and structure of their zinc-finger domains. Based on a phylogenetic tree of the conserved WRKY domains and the graphic display of WRKY loci on corresponding indica and japonica chromosomes, we identified possible WRKY gene duplications within, and losses between the two closely related rice subspecies. Also reviewed are the roles of WRKY genes in disease resistance and responses to salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, seed development and germination mediated by gibberellins, other developmental processes including senescence, and responses to abiotic stresses and abscisic acid in rice and other plants. The signaling pathways mediating WRKY gene expression are also discussed.

The WRKY proteins are a superfamily of regulators that control diverse developmental and physiological processes. This family was believed to be plant specific until the recent identification of WRKY genes in nonphotosynthetic eukaryotes. We have undertaken a comprehensive computational analysis of the rice (Oryza sativa) genomic sequences and predicted the structures of 81 OsWRKY genes, 48 of which are supported by full-length cDNA sequences. Eleven OsWRKY proteins contain two conserved WRKY domains, while the rest have only one. Phylogenetic analyses of the WRKY domain sequences provide support for the hypothesis that gene duplication of single- and two-domain WRKY genes, and loss of the WRKY domain, occurred in the evolutionary history of this gene family in rice. The phylogeny deduced from the WRKY domain peptide sequences is further supported by the position and phase of the intron in the regions encoding the WRKY domains. Analyses for chromosomal distributions reveal that 26% of the predicted OsWRKY genes are located on chromosome 1. Among the dozen genes tested, OsWRKY24, -51, -71, and -72 are induced by abscisic acid (ABA) in aleurone cells. Using a transient expression system, we have demonstrated that OsWRKY24 and -45 repress ABA induction of the HVA22 promoter-beta-glucuronidase construct, while OsWRKY72 and -77 synergistically interact with ABA to activate this reporter construct. This study provides a solid base for functional genomics studies of this important superfamily of regulatory genes in monocotyledonous plants and reveals a novel function for WRKY genes, i.e. mediating plant responses to ABA.
NA	Molecular characterization of Oryza sativa WRKY6, which binds to W-box-like element 1 of the Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related (PR) 10a promoter and confers reduced susceptibility to pathogens.	2015	New Phytol	National Academy of Agricultural Science, Rural Development Administration, Jeonju, 560-500, Korea.	WRKY proteins are transcription factors (TFs) that regulate the expression of defense-related genes. The salicylic acid (SA)-inducible Oryza sativa WRKY6 (OsWRKY6) was identified as a positive regulator of Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related 10a (OsPR10a) by transient expression assays. A physical interaction between OsWRKY6 and W-box-like element 1 (WLE1), which positively regulates OsPR10a/probenazole induced protein 1 expression, was verified in vitro. Several pathogenesis-related (PR) genes were constitutively activated, including OsPR10a, and transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plants overexpressing (ox) OsWRKY6 exhibited enhanced disease resistance to pathogens. By contrast, PR gene induction was compromised in transgenic OsWRKY6-RNAi lines, suggesting that OsWRKY6 is a positive regulator of defense responses. OsWRKY6-ox lines displayed leaf lesions, and increased OsWRKY6 levels caused cell death. Salicylic acid (SA) concentrations were higher in OsWRKY6-ox lines than in wild-type (WT) plants, and transcript levels of Oryza sativa isochorismate synthase 1 (OsICS1), which encodes a major enzyme involved in SA biosynthesis, were higher in OsWRKY6-ox lines than in WT. OsWRKY6 directly bound to the OsICS1 promoter in vivo. This indicates that OsWRKY6 can directly regulate OsICS1 expression and thereby increase SA concentrations. OsWRKY6 autoregulates its own expression. OsWRKY6 protein degradation is possibly regulated by ubiquitination. Our results suggest that OsWRKY6 positively regulates defense responses through activation of OsICS1 expression and OsWRKY6 stabilization.
NA	The OsWRKY6 transcriptional cascade functions in basal defense and Xa1-mediated defense of rice against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2022	Planta	National Institute of Agricultural Science, Rural Development Administration, Jeonju, 54874, Republic of Korea.	The rice protein OsWRKY6 directly activates OsWRKY45 and OsWRKY47 expression, and also activates OsPR1a and OsPR1b through the two OsWRKYs, and this transcriptional module participates in Xa1-mediated defense against the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Biotic stress, the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) in particular, negatively impacts worldwide productivity and yield in the staple crop rice (Oryza sativa). OsWRKY transcription factors are involved in various biotic stress responses in rice, and OsWRKY6 specifically acts as an important defense regulator against Xoo. However, the relationship between OsWRKY6 and other OsWRKYs, as well as its role in resistance (R) gene-mediated defense, have yet to be studied in depth. Here, we characterized a transcriptional cascade triggered by OsWRKY6 that regulated defense against Xoo infection mediated by the NBS-LRR protein Xa1. OsWRKY45 and OsWRKY47 were identified as direct transcriptional targets of OsWRKY6, and their two gene products reciprocally activated their two genes. Furthermore, OsWRKY6 activated OsPR1a and OsPR1b via the OsWRKY45 and OsWRKY47. Two OsWRKY6 RNAi knockdown lines showed significantly reduced defense even against an incompatible Xoo infection, and the expression of OsWRKY6 was not regulated by OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY88. This study reveals that a novel downstream transcriptional pathway activated by OsWRKY6 is involved in Xa1-mediated defense against Xoo.
