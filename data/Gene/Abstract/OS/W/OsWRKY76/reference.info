WRKY transcription factors form a large family of plant-specific transcription factors and participate in plant defense responses either as positive or negative regulators. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the role of one of the group IIa WRKY transcription factors in rice, OsWRKY28, in the regulation of basal defense responses to a compatible race of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, strain Ina86-137. The expression analyses of the group IIa WRKY transcription factors in rice revealed that OsWRKY28, together with OsWRKY71, exhibit an early-induced expression prior to the late-induced expressions of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76. The GFP-OsWRKY28 fusion protein localized mainly in the nuclei of onion epidermal cells, and the maltose-binding protein-fused OsWRKY28 recombinant protein specifically bound to W-box elements. A transient reporter gene assay clearly showed that OsWRKY28 functions as a transcriptional repressor. Overexpression of OsWRKY28 in rice plants resulted in enhanced susceptibility to Ina86-137. Finally, transcriptome analysis revealed that the induction of several defense-related genes in the wild type after Ina86-137 infection was counteracted in OsWRKY28-overexpressing rice plants. These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY28 is a negative regulator of basal defense responses against Ina86-137 and acts as a modulator to maintain the responses at an appropriate level by attenuating the activation of defense-related gene expression levels.
ert298.pdf	WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance	2013	J Exp Bot	Disease Resistant Crops Research Unit, GMO Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	OsWRKY76 encodes a group IIa WRKY transcription factor of rice. The expression of OsWRKY76 was induced within 48h after inoculation with rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae), and by wounding, low temperature, benzothiadiazole, and abscisic acid. Green fluorescent protein-fused OsWRKY76 localized to the nuclei in rice epidermal cells. OsWRKY76 showed sequence-specific DNA binding to the W-box element in vitro and exhibited W-box-mediated transcriptional repressor activity in cultured rice cells. Overexpression of OsWRKY76 in rice plants resulted in drastically increased susceptibility to M. oryzae, but improved tolerance to cold stress. Microarray analysis revealed that overexpression of OsWRKY76 suppresses the induction of a specific set of PR genes and of genes involved in phytoalexin synthesis after inoculation with blast fungus, consistent with the observation that the levels of phytoalexins in the transgenic rice plants remained significantly lower than those in non-transformed control plants. Furthermore, overexpression of OsWRKY76 led to the increased expression of abiotic stress-associated genes such as peroxidase and lipid metabolism genes. These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY76 plays dual and opposing roles in blast disease resistance and cold tolerance.
j.1744-7909.2007.00504.x.pdf	The WRKY Gene Family in Rice (Oryza sativa)	2007	J Integr Plant Biol	Bioinformatics Core, School of Life Sciences, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada 89154, USA	WRKY genes encode transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of various biological processes. These zinc-finger proteins, especially those members mediating stress responses, are uniquely expanded in plants. To facilitate the study of the evolutionary history and functions of this supergene family, we performed an exhaustive search for WRKY genes using HMMER and a Hidden Markov Model that was specifically trained for rice. This work resulted in a comprehensive list of WRKY gene models in Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and L. ssp. japonica. Mapping of these genes to individual chromosomes facilitated elimination of the redundant, leading to the identification of 98 WRKY genes in japonica and 102 in indica rice. These genes were further categorized according to the number and structure of their zinc-finger domains. Based on a phylogenetic tree of the conserved WRKY domains and the graphic display of WRKY loci on corresponding indica and japonica chromosomes, we identified possible WRKY gene duplications within, and losses between the two closely related rice subspecies. Also reviewed are the roles of WRKY genes in disease resistance and responses to salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, seed development and germination mediated by gibberellins, other developmental processes including senescence, and responses to abiotic stresses and abscisic acid in rice and other plants. The signaling pathways mediating WRKY gene expression are also discussed.
