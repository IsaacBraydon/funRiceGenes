WRKY transcription factors form a large family of plant-specific transcription factors and participate in plant defense responses either as positive or negative regulators. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the role of one of the group IIa WRKY transcription factors in rice, OsWRKY28, in the regulation of basal defense responses to a compatible race of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, strain Ina86-137. The expression analyses of the group IIa WRKY transcription factors in rice revealed that OsWRKY28, together with OsWRKY71, exhibit an early-induced expression prior to the late-induced expressions of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76. The GFP-OsWRKY28 fusion protein localized mainly in the nuclei of onion epidermal cells, and the maltose-binding protein-fused OsWRKY28 recombinant protein specifically bound to W-box elements. A transient reporter gene assay clearly showed that OsWRKY28 functions as a transcriptional repressor. Overexpression of OsWRKY28 in rice plants resulted in enhanced susceptibility to Ina86-137. Finally, transcriptome analysis revealed that the induction of several defense-related genes in the wild type after Ina86-137 infection was counteracted in OsWRKY28-overexpressing rice plants. These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY28 is a negative regulator of basal defense responses against Ina86-137 and acts as a modulator to maintain the responses at an appropriate level by attenuating the activation of defense-related gene expression levels.
ert298.pdf	WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance	2013	J Exp Bot	Disease Resistant Crops Research Unit, GMO Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	OsWRKY76 encodes a group IIa WRKY transcription factor of rice. The expression of OsWRKY76 was induced within 48h after inoculation with rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae), and by wounding, low temperature, benzothiadiazole, and abscisic acid. Green fluorescent protein-fused OsWRKY76 localized to the nuclei in rice epidermal cells. OsWRKY76 showed sequence-specific DNA binding to the W-box element in vitro and exhibited W-box-mediated transcriptional repressor activity in cultured rice cells. Overexpression of OsWRKY76 in rice plants resulted in drastically increased susceptibility to M. oryzae, but improved tolerance to cold stress. Microarray analysis revealed that overexpression of OsWRKY76 suppresses the induction of a specific set of PR genes and of genes involved in phytoalexin synthesis after inoculation with blast fungus, consistent with the observation that the levels of phytoalexins in the transgenic rice plants remained significantly lower than those in non-transformed control plants. Furthermore, overexpression of OsWRKY76 led to the increased expression of abiotic stress-associated genes such as peroxidase and lipid metabolism genes. These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY76 plays dual and opposing roles in blast disease resistance and cold tolerance.
j.1744-7909.2007.00504.x.pdf	The WRKY Gene Family in Rice (Oryza sativa)	2007	J Integr Plant Biol	Bioinformatics Core, School of Life Sciences, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada 89154, USA	WRKY genes encode transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of various biological processes. These zinc-finger proteins, especially those members mediating stress responses, are uniquely expanded in plants. To facilitate the study of the evolutionary history and functions of this supergene family, we performed an exhaustive search for WRKY genes using HMMER and a Hidden Markov Model that was specifically trained for rice. This work resulted in a comprehensive list of WRKY gene models in Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and L. ssp. japonica. Mapping of these genes to individual chromosomes facilitated elimination of the redundant, leading to the identification of 98 WRKY genes in japonica and 102 in indica rice. These genes were further categorized according to the number and structure of their zinc-finger domains. Based on a phylogenetic tree of the conserved WRKY domains and the graphic display of WRKY loci on corresponding indica and japonica chromosomes, we identified possible WRKY gene duplications within, and losses between the two closely related rice subspecies. Also reviewed are the roles of WRKY genes in disease resistance and responses to salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, seed development and germination mediated by gibberellins, other developmental processes including senescence, and responses to abiotic stresses and abscisic acid in rice and other plants. The signaling pathways mediating WRKY gene expression are also discussed.
NA	Alternative splicing of rice WRKY62 and WRKY76 transcription factor genes in pathogen defense	2016	Plant Physiology	China Agricultural University CITY: Beijing China	The WRKY family of transcription factors (TFs) function as transcriptional activators or repressors in various signaling pathways. In this study we discovered that two IIa subfamily of WRKY genes, OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76, undergo constitutive and inducible alternative splicing. The full-length OsWRKY62.1 and OsWRKY76.1 proteins formed homo- and hetero-complexes, but the heterocomplex dominates in the nuclei when analyzed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Transgenic overexpression of OsWRKY62.1 and OsWRKY76.1 enhanced susceptibility to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae SZ and the rice leaf blight bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae J18, whereas RNAi and loss-of-function knockout plants exhibited elevated resistance. The dsOW62/76 and knockout lines of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 also showed greatly increased expressions of defense-related genes and accumulation of phytoalexins. Unlike other WRKY genes analyzed so far, we observed prominent alternative transcripts for OsWRKY62.1, OsWRKY76.1 and, most interestingly, the ratio of full-length vs. truncated transcripts changed in dsOW62/76 plants as well as in response to pathogen infection. The short OsWRKY62.2 and OsWRKY76.2 proteins could interact each other and with full-length proteins. OsWRKY62.2 showed a reduced repressor activity in planta and two sequence determinants required for the repressor activity were identified in the N-terminus of OsWRKY62.1. The N-termini of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 splice variants also showed reduced binding to the canonical W box motif. These results enhance our understanding of the DNA binding property, the repressor sequence motifs and the negative feedback regulation of the IIa subfamily of WRKYs and provide the first evidence for alternative splicing of WRKY TFs.
NA	Metabolic and transcriptional alternations for defense by interfering OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 transcriptions in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Key Laboratory of Pest Monitoring and Green Management, MOA, Department of Plant Pathology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.	Metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches were used to dissect the enhanced disease resistance in the plants harbouring a RNA interfering construct of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 (dsOW62/76) genes. The primary metabolic pathways were activated in dsOW62/76 compared with wild-type (ZH17) plants, revealed by increased accumulation of amino acids and constituents of citric acid cycle etc. Contents of phenolic acids derived from phenylpropanoid pathway were elevated in dsOW62/76 plants. Importantly, phenolamides, conjugates of the phenolic acids with amines, were detected in large number and mostly at higher levels in dsOW62/76 compared with ZH17 plants; however, the free pools of flavonoids were mostly decreased in dsOW62/76. Salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA)/JA-Ile contents were increased in dsOW62/76 and knockout lines of individual OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 genes. Transcription of isochorismate synthase (OsICS1) gene was suppressed in dsOW62/76 and in MeJA-treated rice plants, whereas the transcription level of cinnamoyl-CoA hydratase-dehydrogenase (OsCHD) gene for ¦Â-oxidation in peroxisome was increased. The calli with OsCHD mutation showed markedly decreased SA accumulation. These results indicate that OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 function as negative regulators of biosynthetic defense-related metabolites and provide evidence for an important role of phenylpropanoid pathway in SA production in rice.
NA	The CC-NB-LRR OsRLR1 mediates rice disease resistance through interaction with OsWRKY19	2020	Plant Biotechnol J	Rice Research Institute, Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, China.	Nucleotide-binding site, leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) resistance proteins are critical for plant resistance to pathogens; however, their mechanism of activation and signal transduction are still not well understood. We identified a mutation in an as yet uncharacterized rice coiled-coil (CC)-NB-LRR, Oryza sativa RPM1-like resistance gene 1 (OsRLR1), which leads to hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesions on the leaf blade and broad range resistance to the fungal pathogen Pyricularia oryzae (syn. Magnaporthe oryzae) and the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, together with strong growth reduction. Consistently, OsRLR1-overexpression lines showed enhanced resistance to both pathogens. Moreover, we found that OsRLR1 mediates the defence response through direct interaction in the nucleus with the transcription factor OsWRKY19. Down-regulation of OsWRKY19 in the rlr1 mutant compromised the HR-like phenotype and resistance response, and largely restored plant growth. OsWRKY19 binds to the promoter of OsPR10 to activate the defence response. Taken together, our data highlight the role of a new residue involved in the NB-LRR activation mechanism, allowing identification of a new NB-LRR downstream signalling pathway.
