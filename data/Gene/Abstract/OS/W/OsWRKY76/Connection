OsWRKY62	OsWRKY76	OsWRKY28, a PAMP-responsive transrepressor, negatively regulates innate immune responses in rice against rice blast fungus	 The expression analyses of the group IIa WRKY transcription factors in rice revealed that OsWRKY28, together with OsWRKY71, exhibit an early-induced expression prior to the late-induced expressions of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76

OsWRKY62	OsWRKY76	Alternative splicing of rice WRKY62 and WRKY76 transcription factor genes in pathogen defense	 In this study we discovered that two IIa subfamily of WRKY genes, OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76, undergo constitutive and inducible alternative splicing
OsWRKY62	OsWRKY76	Alternative splicing of rice WRKY62 and WRKY76 transcription factor genes in pathogen defense	 The dsOW62/76 and knockout lines of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 also showed greatly increased expressions of defense-related genes and accumulation of phytoalexins
OsWRKY62	OsWRKY76	Alternative splicing of rice WRKY62 and WRKY76 transcription factor genes in pathogen defense	 The N-termini of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 splice variants also showed reduced binding to the canonical W box motif
