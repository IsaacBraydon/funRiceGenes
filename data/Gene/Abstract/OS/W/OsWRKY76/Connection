OsWRKY62	OsWRKY76	Alternative splicing of rice WRKY62 and WRKY76 transcription factor genes in pathogen defense	In this study we discovered that two IIa subfamily of WRKY genes, OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76, undergo constitutive and inducible alternative splicing
OsWRKY62	OsWRKY76	Alternative splicing of rice WRKY62 and WRKY76 transcription factor genes in pathogen defense	The dsOW62/76 and knockout lines of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 also showed greatly increased expressions of defense-related genes and accumulation of phytoalexins
OsWRKY62	OsWRKY76	Alternative splicing of rice WRKY62 and WRKY76 transcription factor genes in pathogen defense	The N-termini of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 splice variants also showed reduced binding to the canonical W box motif
OsWRKY62	OsWRKY76	Metabolic and transcriptional alternations for defense by interfering OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 transcriptions in rice.	Metabolic and transcriptional alternations for defense by interfering OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 transcriptions in rice.
OsWRKY62	OsWRKY76	Metabolic and transcriptional alternations for defense by interfering OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 transcriptions in rice.	Metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches were used to dissect the enhanced disease resistance in the plants harbouring a RNA interfering construct of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 (dsOW62/76) genes
OsWRKY62	OsWRKY76	Metabolic and transcriptional alternations for defense by interfering OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 transcriptions in rice.	 Salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA)/JA-Ile contents were increased in dsOW62/76 and knockout lines of individual OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 genes
OsWRKY62	OsWRKY76	Metabolic and transcriptional alternations for defense by interfering OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 transcriptions in rice.	 These results indicate that OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 function as negative regulators of biosynthetic defense-related metabolites and provide evidence for an important role of phenylpropanoid pathway in SA production in rice
