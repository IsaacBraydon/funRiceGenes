OsWRKY76	 The dsOW62/76 and knockout lines of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 also showed greatly increased expressions of defense-related genes and accumulation of phytoalexins
OsWRKY76	 OsWRKY76 expression was induced by PEG treatment, dehydration stress, and exogenous MeJA rather than by no treatment |  OsJAZ12 was significantly induced by drought stress, and its expression was significantly higher in OsWRKY76-knockout mutants than in wild-type ZH11 under drought stress |  Moreover, OsDREB1E expression was lower in OsWRKY76-knockout mutants than in wild-type ZH11 under drought stress, but it was upregulated under normal growth conditions |  Yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift, and dual-luciferase assays showed that OsWRKY76 and OsbHLH148 bound directly to the OsDREB1E promoter and activated OsDREB1E expression in response to drought stress
