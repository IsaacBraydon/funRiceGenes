Salt stress is a critical limiting factor for rice growth and production. Although numerous salt-tolerant genes have been identified, the mechanism underlying salt stress tolerance in rice remains unclear. This study reports the need for an uncharacterized WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY54 for rice salt-tolerance. Salt stress resulted in a rapid induction of OsWRKY54 expression in roots. Immunostaining analysis showed that it was mainly expressed in the stele. The loss of OsWRKY54 resulted in greater Na accumulation in shoots and enhanced sensitivity of rice plants to salt stress. The real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and transcriptome analysis revealed that OsWRKY54 regulated the expression of some essential genes related to salt tolerance, such as OsNHX4 and OsHKT1;5. Furthermore, OsWRKY54 was found to regulate OsHKT1;5 expression by directly binding to the W-box motif in its promoter. Thus, these results indicated that OsWRKY54 was a critical regulatory factor in salt tolerance in rice.
