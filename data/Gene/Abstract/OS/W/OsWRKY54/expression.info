OsWRKY54	 Salt stress resulted in a rapid induction of OsWRKY54 expression in roots |  The real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and transcriptome analysis revealed that OsWRKY54 regulated the expression of some essential genes related to salt tolerance, such as OsNHX4 and OsHKT1;5 |  Furthermore, OsWRKY54 was found to regulate OsHKT1;5 expression by directly binding to the W-box motif in its promoter
