OsWAK91	resistance	Several wall-associated kinases participate positively and negatively in basal defense against rice blast fungus.	 While OsWAK14, OsWAK91 and OsWAK92 positively regulate quantitative resistance, OsWAK112d is a negative regulator of blast resistance
OsWAK91	defense	Several wall-associated kinases participate positively and negatively in basal defense against rice blast fungus.	 Finally, we show that OsWAK91 is required for H2O2 production and sufficient to enhance defense gene expression during infection
OsWAK91	blast	Several wall-associated kinases participate positively and negatively in basal defense against rice blast fungus.	 While OsWAK14, OsWAK91 and OsWAK92 positively regulate quantitative resistance, OsWAK112d is a negative regulator of blast resistance
