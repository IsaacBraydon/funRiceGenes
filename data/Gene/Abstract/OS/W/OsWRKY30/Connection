OsAOS2|AOS	OsWRKY30	Constitutive expression of rice WRKY30 gene increases the endogenous jasmonic acid accumulation, PR gene expression and resistance to fungal pathogens in rice	The enhanced resistance in the transgenic lines overexpressing WRKY30 was associated with activated expression of JA synthesis-related genes LOX, AOS2 and pathogenesis-related (PR)3 and PR10, and increased endogenous JA accumulation under the challenge of fungal pathogens
OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	OsWRKY30	OsWRKY30 is activated by MAP kinases to confer drought tolerance in rice	Here, we have shown that OsWRKY30 interacted with OsMPK3, OsMPK4, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, OsMPK20-4, and OsMPK20-5, and could be phosphorylated by OsMPK3, OsMPK7, and OsMPK14
OsMPK14	OsWRKY30	OsWRKY30 is activated by MAP kinases to confer drought tolerance in rice	Here, we have shown that OsWRKY30 interacted with OsMPK3, OsMPK4, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, OsMPK20-4, and OsMPK20-5, and could be phosphorylated by OsMPK3, OsMPK7, and OsMPK14
OsMPK6|OsMPK4	OsWRKY30	OsWRKY30 is activated by MAP kinases to confer drought tolerance in rice	Here, we have shown that OsWRKY30 interacted with OsMPK3, OsMPK4, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, OsMPK20-4, and OsMPK20-5, and could be phosphorylated by OsMPK3, OsMPK7, and OsMPK14
OsMKK3	OsWRKY30	Functional Involvement of a Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Module, OsMKK3-OsMPK7-OsWRK30 in Mediating Resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae in Rice.	 Here we report involvement of a poorly characterized group C MAPK of rice namely, OsMPK7 along with its upstream MAPK kinase, OsMKK3 and downstream target, OsWRKY30 during Xanthomonas oryzae infection, a causal agent of leaf blight disease in rice
OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	OsWRKY30	Functional Involvement of a Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Module, OsMKK3-OsMPK7-OsWRK30 in Mediating Resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae in Rice.	 Here we report involvement of a poorly characterized group C MAPK of rice namely, OsMPK7 along with its upstream MAPK kinase, OsMKK3 and downstream target, OsWRKY30 during Xanthomonas oryzae infection, a causal agent of leaf blight disease in rice
OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	OsWRKY30	Functional Involvement of a Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Module, OsMKK3-OsMPK7-OsWRK30 in Mediating Resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae in Rice.	 Furthermore, OsWRKY30 was identified as downstream target of OsMPK7 through protein-protein interaction techniques and was found to be a positive regulator of defence response against X
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsWRKY30	OsMAPK6 phosphorylates a zinc finger protein OsLIC to promote downstream OsWRKY30 for rice resistance to bacterial blight and leaf streak.	OsMAPK6 phosphorylates a zinc finger protein OsLIC to promote downstream OsWRKY30 for rice resistance to bacterial blight and leaf streak.
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsWRKY30	OsMAPK6 phosphorylates a zinc finger protein OsLIC to promote downstream OsWRKY30 for rice resistance to bacterial blight and leaf streak.	 Biochemical assays showed that OsLIC bound to OsWRKY30 promoter and suppressed its transcription
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsWRKY30	OsMAPK6 phosphorylates a zinc finger protein OsLIC to promote downstream OsWRKY30 for rice resistance to bacterial blight and leaf streak.	 Genetic assays confirmed that the osilc knockout mutants and OsWRKY30-overexpressing plants exhibited enhanced resistance to Xoo and Xoc, knocking out OsWRKY30 in the oslic mutants attenuated the resistance against bacterial pathogens
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsWRKY30	OsMAPK6 phosphorylates a zinc finger protein OsLIC to promote downstream OsWRKY30 for rice resistance to bacterial blight and leaf streak.	 In addition, both OsMAPK6-phosphorylated activation of OsLIC and phosphorylation-mimic OsLIC(5D) had reduced DNA-binding activity towards OsWRKY30 promoter, thereby promoting OsWRKY30 transcription
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsWRKY30	OsMAPK6 phosphorylates a zinc finger protein OsLIC to promote downstream OsWRKY30 for rice resistance to bacterial blight and leaf streak.	 Collectively, these results reveal that OsMAPK6-mediated phosphorylation of OsLIC positively regulates rice resistance to Xoo and Xoc by modulating OsWRKY30 transcription, suggesting that OsMAPK6-OsLIC-OsWRKY30 module is an immune signaling pathway in response to the bacterial pathogens
OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsWRKY30	OsMAPK6 phosphorylates a zinc finger protein OsLIC to promote downstream OsWRKY30 for rice resistance to bacterial blight and leaf streak.	OsMAPK6 phosphorylates a zinc finger protein OsLIC to promote downstream OsWRKY30 for rice resistance to bacterial blight and leaf streak.
