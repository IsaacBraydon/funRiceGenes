To understand the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of host genes during the activation of defense responses in rice, we isolated WRKY transcription factors whose expressions were altered upon attack of the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of the devastating rice blast disease. A systematic expression analysis of OsWRKYs (Oryza sativa L. WRKYs) revealed that among 45 tested genes the expression of 15 genes was increased remarkably in an incompatible interaction between rice and M. grisea. Twelve of the M. grisea-inducible OsWRKY genes were also differentially regulated in rice plants infected with the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). In experiments with defense signaling molecules, the expression of two genes, OsWRKY45 and OsWRKY62, was increased in salicylic acid (SA)-treated leaves and the expression of three genes, OsWRKY10, OsWRKY82, and OsWRKY85 was increased by jasmonic acid (JA) treatment. OsWRKY30 and OsWRKY83 responded to both SA- and JA treatments. The expression profiles suggest that a large number of WRKY DNA-binding proteins are involved in the transcriptional activation of defense-related genes in response to rice pathogens.

WRKY transcription factors are crucial regulatory components of plant responses to pathogen infection. In the present study, we report isolation and functional characterization of the pathogen-responsive rice WRKY30 gene, whose transcripts accumulate rapidly in response to salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) treatment. Overexpression of WRKY30 in rice enhanced resistance to rice sheath blight fungus Rhizoctonia solani and blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea. The enhanced resistance in the transgenic lines overexpressing WRKY30 was associated with activated expression of JA synthesis-related genes LOX, AOS2 and pathogenesis-related (PR)3 and PR10, and increased endogenous JA accumulation under the challenge of fungal pathogens. WRKY30 was nuclear-localized and had transcriptional activation ability in yeast cells, supporting that it functions as a transcription factor. Together, our findings indicate that JA plays a crucial role in the WRKY30-mediated defense responses to fungal pathogens, and that the rice WRKY30 seems promising as an important candidate gene to improve disease resistance in rice.

Both the WRKY transcription factor (TF) and MAP kinases have been shown to regulate gene expression in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. Several reports have shown that WRKY TFs may function downstream of MAPK cascades. Here, we have shown that OsWRKY30 interacted with OsMPK3, OsMPK4, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, OsMPK20-4, and OsMPK20-5, and could be phosphorylated by OsMPK3, OsMPK7, and OsMPK14. Overexpression of OsWRKY30 in rice dramatically increased drought tolerance. Overexpression of OsWRKY30AA, in which all SP (serine residue followed by proline residue) sites were replaced by AP (A, alanine), resulted in no improvement in drought tolerance. In addition, the function of transcriptional activation of OsWRKY30 was impaired after SP was replaced by AP. These results proved that the phosphorylation of OsWRKY30 by MAPKs was crucial in order for OsWRKY30 to perform its biological function.

These zinc-finger proteins, especially those members mediating stress responses, are uniquely expanded in plants. To facilitate the study of the evolutionary history and functions of this supergene family, we performed an exhaustive search for WRKY genes using HMMER and a Hidden Markov Model that was specifically trained for rice. This work resulted in a comprehensive list of WRKY gene models in Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and L. ssp. japonica. Mapping of these genes to individual chromosomes facilitated elimination of the redundant, leading to the identification of 98 WRKY genes in japonica and 102 in indica rice. These genes were further categorized according to the number and structure of their zinc-finger domains. Based on a phylogenetic tree of the conserved WRKY domains and the graphic display of WRKY loci on corresponding indica and japonica chromosomes, we identified possible WRKY gene duplications within, and losses between the two closely related rice subspecies. Also reviewed are the roles of WRKY genes in disease resistance and responses to salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, seed development and germination mediated by gibberellins, other developmental processes including senescence, and responses to abiotic stresses and abscisic acid in rice and other plants. The signaling pathways mediating WRKY gene expression are also discussed.
NA	Functional Involvement of a Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Module, OsMKK3-OsMPK7-OsWRK30 in Mediating Resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae in Rice.	2016	Sci Rep	National Institute of Plant Genome Research, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, 110067, India.	Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are highly conserved signaling modules in eukaryotes, transmitting signals from upstream receptor to downstream target by phosphorelay mechanism. Here we report involvement of a poorly characterized group C MAPK of rice namely, OsMPK7 along with its upstream MAPK kinase, OsMKK3 and downstream target, OsWRKY30 during Xanthomonas oryzae infection, a causal agent of leaf blight disease in rice. X. oryzae infection resulted in induction of OsMPK7 and OsMKK3. OsMKK3 was found to physically interact and phosphorylate OsMPK7. Overexpression of OsMPK7 and OsMKK3, individually and in combinations resulted in inhibition of disease symptoms caused by X. oryzae, however silencing of OsMPK7 resulted in disease susceptibility. Furthermore, OsWRKY30 was identified as downstream target of OsMPK7 through protein-protein interaction techniques and was found to be a positive regulator of defence response against X. oryzae pathogen. The overexpression of OsMKK3-OsMPK7 upregulated genes involved in pathogenesis, cell wall structure maintenance and cell metabolism indicating possible mechanism of disease resistance. These leaves also showed restricted movement of the pathogen from the point of infection to uninfected area. Taken together, this work suggests a positive involvement of OsMKK3-OsMPK7-OsWRKY30 module in imparting disease resistance against X. oryzae infection in rice.
