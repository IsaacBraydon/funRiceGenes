OsWRI1a	growth	Ectopic expression of WRINKLED1 in rice improves lipid biosynthesis but retards plant growth and development.	 Overexpression of OsWRI1a under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter severely retarded plant growth and development in rice
OsWRI1a	growth	Ectopic expression of WRINKLED1 in rice improves lipid biosynthesis but retards plant growth and development.	 Thus, ectopic expression of OsWRI1a in rice enhances oil biosynthesis, but also leads to abnormal plant growth and development
OsWRI1a	development	Ectopic expression of WRINKLED1 in rice improves lipid biosynthesis but retards plant growth and development.	 Overexpression of OsWRI1a under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter severely retarded plant growth and development in rice
OsWRI1a	development	Ectopic expression of WRINKLED1 in rice improves lipid biosynthesis but retards plant growth and development.	 Thus, ectopic expression of OsWRI1a in rice enhances oil biosynthesis, but also leads to abnormal plant growth and development
OsWRI1a	plant growth	Ectopic expression of WRINKLED1 in rice improves lipid biosynthesis but retards plant growth and development.	 Overexpression of OsWRI1a under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter severely retarded plant growth and development in rice
OsWRI1a	plant growth	Ectopic expression of WRINKLED1 in rice improves lipid biosynthesis but retards plant growth and development.	 Thus, ectopic expression of OsWRI1a in rice enhances oil biosynthesis, but also leads to abnormal plant growth and development
OsWRI1a	endosperm	Ectopic expression of WRINKLED1 in rice improves lipid biosynthesis but retards plant growth and development.	 Expressing the OsWRI1a gene under the control of the P1 promoter of Brittle2 (highly expressed in endosperm but low in leaves and roots) increased the oil content of both leaves and endosperms and upregulated the expression of several genes related to late glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis
OsWRI1a	protoplasts	Ectopic expression of WRINKLED1 in rice improves lipid biosynthesis but retards plant growth and development.	 The subcellular localization of Arabidopsis protoplasts showed that OsWRI1a encoded a nuclear localized protein
OsWRI1a	fatty acid biosynthesis	Ectopic expression of WRINKLED1 in rice improves lipid biosynthesis but retards plant growth and development.	 Expressing the OsWRI1a gene under the control of the P1 promoter of Brittle2 (highly expressed in endosperm but low in leaves and roots) increased the oil content of both leaves and endosperms and upregulated the expression of several genes related to late glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis
