OsWIH2	transcription factor	The bHLH transcription factor regulated gene OsWIH2 is a positive regulator of drought tolerance in rice.	 We further demonstrated that the drought-inducible bHLH transcription factor OsbHLH130 could activate the expression of OsWIH2
OsWIH2	drought	The bHLH transcription factor regulated gene OsWIH2 is a positive regulator of drought tolerance in rice.	The bHLH transcription factor regulated gene OsWIH2 is a positive regulator of drought tolerance in rice.
OsWIH2	drought	The bHLH transcription factor regulated gene OsWIH2 is a positive regulator of drought tolerance in rice.	 In this study, we characterized a novel drought tolerance induced WIH gene in rice, OsWIH2
OsWIH2	drought	The bHLH transcription factor regulated gene OsWIH2 is a positive regulator of drought tolerance in rice.	 Overexpression of OsWIH2 in rice resulted in significantly higher drought tolerance, probably due to the decreased water loss rate and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation under drought stress
