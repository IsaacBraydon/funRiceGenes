OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Development of disease-resistant rice by optimized expression of WRKY45. |  This was achieved by optimizing the promoter driving WRKY45 expression |  We isolated 16 constitutive promoters from rice genomic DNA and tested their ability to drive WRKY45 expression |  Comparisons among different transformant lines showed that, overall, the strength of WRKY45 expression was positively correlated with disease resistance and negatively correlated with agronomic traits |  Interestingly, excessive WRKY45 expression rendered rice plants sensitive to low temperature and salinity, and stress sensitivity was correlated with the induction of defence genes by these stresses
OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Development of disease-resistant rice by pathogen-responsive expression of WRKY45.
OsWRKY45|WRKY45	 Expression of WRKY45-1, but not WRKY45-2, generated TE-siR815, which in turn repressed ST1, an important component in WRKY45-mediated resistance, by RdDM
OsWRKY45|WRKY45	 Here, we cloned a rice WRKY gene OsWRKY45, whose expression was induced by mechanical wounding, by infestation of the brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) and by treatment with jasmonic acid (JA) or salicylic acid (SA) |  The antisense expression of OsWRKY45 (as-wrky) enhanced BPH-induced levels of and ethylene, reduced feeding and oviposition preference as well as the survival rate of BPH, and delayed the development of BPH nymphs
OsWRKY45|WRKY45	 ARF8 protein binds directly to the promoter and suppresses the expression of WRKY45, which acts as a positive regulator of rice immunity
