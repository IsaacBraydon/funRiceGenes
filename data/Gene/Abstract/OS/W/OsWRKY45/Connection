OsNPR1|NH1	OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Cytokinins act synergistically with salicylic acid to activate defense gene expression in rice	 These effects were diminished by RNAi-knockdown of OsNPR1 or WRKY45, the key regulators of the SA signaling pathway in rice, indicating that the effects of CK depend on these two regulators
OsSSI2	OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Suppression of the rice fatty-acid desaturase gene OsSSI2 enhances resistance to blast and leaf blight diseases in rice	 Taken together, our results suggest that induction of SA-responsive genes, including WRKY45, is likely responsible for enhanced disease resistance in OsSSI2-kd rice plants
GLO1	OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Reduced expression of glycolate oxidase leads to enhanced disease resistance in rice	 Silencing of GLO1 results in enhanced resistance to Xoo, increased expression of defense regulators NH1, NH3, and WRKY45, and activation of PR1 expression

OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Pb1	Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein Pb1 is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction	 The Pb1 protein interacted with WRKY45, a transcription factor involved in induced resistance via the salicylic acid signaling pathway that is regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system| Pb1-mediated panicle blast resistance was largely compromised when WRKY45 was knocked down in a Pb1-containing rice cultivar| Leaf-blast resistance by Pb1 overexpression (Pb1-ox) was also compromised in WRKY45 knockdown/Pb1-ox rice| Blast infection induced higher accumulation of WRKY45 in Pb1-ox than in control Nipponbare rice| Overexpression of Pb1-Quad, a coiled-coil domain mutant that had weak interaction with WRKY45, resulted in significantly weaker blast resistance than that of wild-type Pb1| These results suggest that the blast resistance of Pb1 depends on its interaction with WRKY45 in the nucleus| In a transient system using rice protoplasts, coexpression of Pb1 enhanced WRKY45 accumulation and increased WRKY45-dependent transactivation activity, suggesting that protection of WRKY45 from ubiquitin proteasome system degradation is possibly involved in Pb1-dependent blast resistance|Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein Pb1 is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction
