In this study, we have shown that the rice WRKY45 (OsWRKY45) expression is markedly induced in response to stress-related hormone abscisic acid (ABA) and various stress factors, e.g., application of NaCl, PEG, mannitol or dehydration, treatment with 0 °C and 42 °C as well as infection by Pyricularia oryzae Cav. and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Together, these results indicate that the OsWRKY45 may be involved in the signal pathways of both biotic and abiotic stress response. Further analyses of 35S:OsWRK45 Arabidopsis plants have shown that ectopic, constitutive over-expression of the OsWRKY45 transgene confers a number of properties to transgenic plants. These properties include significantly increased expression of PR genes, enhanced resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae tomato DC3000, enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stresses, decreased sensitivity toward ABA signalling during seed germination and post-germination processes, and modulation of ABA/stress-regulated genes during drought induction. In addition, higher levels of OsWRKY45 expression in transgenic plants correlate positively with the strength of the abiotic and biotic responses mentioned above. More specifically, the decreased ABA sensitivities, the enhanced disease resistance and drought tolerances may be attributed, in part, to stomatal closure and induction of stress-related genes during drought induction. The relationship between OsWRKY45 expression and ABA signalling is discussed.
J. Exp. Bot.-2011-Tao-jxb-err144.pdf	OsWRKY45 alleles play different roles in abscisic acid signalling and salt stress tolerance but similar roles in drought and cold tolerance in rice	2011	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Although allelic diversity of genes has been shown to contribute to many phenotypic variations associated with different physiological processes in plants, information on allelic diversity of abiotic stress-responsive genes is limited. Here it is shown that the alleles OsWRKY45-1 and OsWRKY45-2 play different roles in abscisic acid (ABA) signalling and salt stress adaptation in rice. The two alleles had different transcriptional responses to ABA and salt stresses. OsWRKY45-1-overexpressing lines showed reduced ABA sensitivity, whereas OsWRKY45-1-knockout lines showed increased ABA sensitivity. OsWRKY45-1 transgenic plants showed no obvious difference from negative controls in response to salt stress. In contrast, OsWRKY45-2-overexpressing lines showed increased ABA sensitivity and reduced salt stress tolerance, and OsWRKY45-2-suppressing lines showed reduced ABA sensitivity and increased salt stress tolerance. OsWRKY45-1 and OsWRKY45-2 transgenic plants showed differential expression of a set of ABA- and abiotic stress-responsive genes, but they showed similar responses to cold and drought stresses. These results suggest that OsWRKY45-1 negatively and OsWRKY45-2 positively regulates ABA signalling and, in addition, OsWRKY45-2 but not OsWRKY45-1 negatively regulates rice response to salt stress. The different roles of the two alleles in ABA signalling and salt stress may be due to their transcriptional mediation of different signalling pathways.
j.1364-3703.2011.00732.x.pdf	Rice WRKY45 plays important roles in fungal and bacterial disease resistance	2012	Mol Plant Pathol	Disease Resistant Crops Research Unit, GMO Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	Plant 'activators', such as benzothiadiazole (BTH), protect plants from various diseases by priming the plant salicylic acid (SA) signalling pathway. We have reported previously that a transcription factor identified in rice, WRKY45 (OsWRKY45), plays a pivotal role in BTH-induced disease resistance by mediating SA signalling. Here, we report further functional characterization of WRKY45. Different plant activators vary in their action points, either downstream (BTH and tiadinil) or upstream (probenazole) of SA. Rice resistance to Magnaporthe grisea, induced by both types of plant activator, was markedly reduced in WRKY45-knockdown (WRKY45-kd) rice, indicating a universal role for WRKY45 in chemical-induced resistance. Fungal invasion into rice cells was blocked at most attempted invasion sites (pre-invasive defence) in WRKY45-overexpressing (WRKY45-ox) rice. Hydrogen peroxide accumulated within the cell wall underneath invading fungus appressoria or between the cell wall and the cytoplasm, implying a possible role for H(2)O(2) in pre-invasive defence. Moreover, a hypersensitive reaction-like reaction was observed in rice cells, in which fungal growth was inhibited after invasion (post-invasive defence). The two levels of defence mechanism appear to correspond to Type I and II nonhost resistances. The leaf blast resistance of WRKY45-ox rice plants was much higher than that of other known blast-resistant varieties. WRKY45-ox plants also showed strong panicle blast resistance. BTH-induced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae was compromised in WRKY45-kd rice, whereas WRKY45-ox plants were highly resistant to this pathogen. However, WRKY45-ox plants were susceptible to Rhizoctonia solani. These results indicate the versatility and limitations of the application of this gene.
j.1744-7909.2007.00504.x.pdf	The WRKY Gene Family in Rice (Oryza sativa)	2007	J Integr Plant Biol	Bioinformatics Core, School of Life Sciences, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada 89154, USA	WRKY genes encode transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of various biological processes. These zinc-finger proteins, especially those members mediating stress responses, are uniquely expanded in plants. To facilitate the study of the evolutionary history and functions of this supergene family, we performed an exhaustive search for WRKY genes using HMMER and a Hidden Markov Model that was specifically trained for rice. This work resulted in a comprehensive list of WRKY gene models in Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and L. ssp. japonica. Mapping of these genes to individual chromosomes facilitated elimination of the redundant, leading to the identification of 98 WRKY genes in japonica and 102 in indica rice. These genes were further categorized according to the number and structure of their zinc-finger domains. Based on a phylogenetic tree of the conserved WRKY domains and the graphic display of WRKY loci on corresponding indica and japonica chromosomes, we identified possible WRKY gene duplications within, and losses between the two closely related rice subspecies. Also reviewed are the roles of WRKY genes in disease resistance and responses to salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, seed development and germination mediated by gibberellins, other developmental processes including senescence, and responses to abiotic stresses and abscisic acid in rice and other plants. The signaling pathways mediating WRKY gene expression are also discussed.
MPMI-06-12-0152-R.pdf	Cytokinins act synergistically with salicylic acid to activate defense gene expression in rice	2013	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Japan. cjjiang@affrc.go.jp	Hormone crosstalk is pivotal in plant-pathogen interactions. Here, we report on the accumulation of cytokinins (CK) in rice seedlings after infection of blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and its potential significance in rice-M. oryzae interaction. Blast infection to rice seedlings increased levels of N(6)-(Delta(2)-isopentenyl) adenine (iP), iP riboside (iPR), and iPR 5'-phosphates (iPRP) in leaf blades. Consistent with this, CK signaling was activated around the infection sites, as shown by histochemical staining for beta-glucuronidase activity driven by a CK-responsive OsRR6 promoter. Diverse CK species were also detected in the hyphae (mycelium), conidia, and culture filtrates of blast fungus, indicating that M. oryzae is capable of production as well as hyphal secretion of CK. Co-treatment of leaf blades with CK and salicylic acid (SA), but not with either one alone, markedly induced pathogenesis-related genes OsPR1b and probenazole-induced protein 1 (PBZ1). These effects were diminished by RNAi-knockdown of OsNPR1 or WRKY45, the key regulators of the SA signaling pathway in rice, indicating that the effects of CK depend on these two regulators. Taken together, our data imply a coevolutionary rice-M. oryzae interaction, wherein M. oryzae probably elevates rice CK levels for its own benefits such as nutrient translocation. Rice plants, on the other hand, sense it as an infection signal and activate defense reactions through the synergistic action with SA.
MPMI-OsSSI2.pdf	Suppression of the rice fatty-acid desaturase gene OsSSI2 enhances resistance to blast and leaf blight diseases in rice	2009	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Plant Disease Resistance Research Unit, Division of Plant Science, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Japan.	Fatty acids and their derivatives play important signaling roles in plant defense responses. It has been shown that suppressing a gene for stearoyl acyl carrier protein fatty-acid desaturase (SACPD) enhances the resistance of Arabidopsis (SSI2) and soybean to multiple pathogens. In this study, we present functional analyses of a rice homolog of SSI2 (OsSSI2) in disease resistance of rice plants. A transposon insertion mutation (Osssi2-Tos17) and RNAi-mediated knockdown of OsSSI2 (OsSSI2-kd) reduced the oleic acid (18:1) level and increased that of stearic acid (18:0), indicating that OsSSI2 is responsible for fatty-acid desaturase activity. These plants displayed spontaneous lesion formation in leaf blades, retarded growth, slight increase in endogenous free salicylic acid (SA) levels, and SA/benzothiadiazole (BTH)-specific inducible genes, including WRKY45, a key regulator of SA/BTH-induced resistance, in rice. Moreover, the OsSSI2-kd plants showed markedly enhanced resistance to the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and leaf-blight bacteria Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. These results suggest that OsSSI2 is involved in the negative regulation of defense responses in rice, as are its Arabidopsis and soybean counterparts. Microarray analyses identified 406 genes that were differentially expressed (>or=2-fold) in OsSSI2-kd rice plants compared with wild-type rice and, of these, approximately 39% were BTH responsive. Taken together, our results suggest that induction of SA-responsive genes, including WRKY45, is likely responsible for enhanced disease resistance in OsSSI2-kd rice plants.
peerj-01-28.pdf	Reduced expression of glycolate oxidase leads to enhanced disease resistance in rice	2013	PeerJ	Department of Plant Pathology , University of California Davis , California , USA.	Glycolate oxidase (GLO) is a key enzyme in photorespiration, catalyzing the oxidation of glycolate to glyoxylate. Arabidopsis GLO is required for nonhost defense responses to Pseudomonas syringae and for tobacco Pto/AvrPto-mediated defense responses. We previously described identification of rice GLO1 that interacts with a glutaredoxin protein, which in turn interacts with TGA transcription factors. TGA transcription factors are well known to participate in NPR1/NH1-mediated defense signaling, which is crucial to systemic acquired resistance in plants. Here we demonstrate that reduction of rice GLO1 expression leads to enhanced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo). Constitutive silencing of GLO1 leads to programmed cell death, resulting in a lesion-mimic phenotype and lethality or reduced plant growth and development, consistent with previous reports. Inducible silencing of GLO1, employing a dexamethasone-GVG (Gal4 DNA binding domain-VP16 activation domain-glucocorticoid receptor fusion) inducible system, alleviates these detrimental effects. Silencing of GLO1 results in enhanced resistance to Xoo, increased expression of defense regulators NH1, NH3, and WRKY45, and activation of PR1 expression.
Plant Cell-2007-Shimono-2064-76.pdf	Rice WRKY45 plays a crucial role in benzothiadiazole-inducible blast resistance	2007	Plant Cell	Plant Disease Resistance Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Ibaraki, Japan.	Benzothiadiazole (BTH) is a so-called plant activator and protects plants from diseases by activating the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway. By microarray screening, we identified BTH- and SA-inducible WRKY transcription factor (TF) genes that were upregulated within 3 h after BTH treatment. Overexpression of one of them, WRKY45, in rice (Oryza sativa) markedly enhanced resistance to rice blast fungus. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of WRKY45 compromised BTH-inducible resistance to blast disease, indicating that it is essential for BTH-induced defense responses. In a transient expression system, WRKY45 activated reporter gene transcription through W-boxes. Epistasis analysis suggested that WRKY45 acts in the SA signaling pathway independently of NH1, a rice ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana NPR1, which distinguishes WRKY45 from known Arabidopsis WRKY TFs. Two defense-related genes, encoding a glutathione S-transferase and a cytochrome P450, were found to be regulated downstream of WRKY45 but were not regulated by NH1, consistent with the apparent independence of the WRKY45- and NH1-dependent pathways. Defense gene expression in WRKY45-overexpressed rice plants varied with growth conditions, suggesting that some environmental factor(s) acts downstream of WRKY45 transcription. We propose a role for WRKY45 in BTH-induced and SA-mediated defense signaling in rice and its potential utility in improving disease resistance of rice, an importance food resource worldwide.
Plant Physiol.-2009-Tao-936-48.pdf	A pair of allelic WRKY genes play opposite roles in rice-bacteria interactions	2009	Plant Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Although allelic diversity of genes has been reported to play important roles in different physiological processes, information on allelic diversity of defense-responsive genes in host-pathogen interactions is limited. Here, we report that a pair of allelic genes, OsWRKY45-1 and OsWRKY45-2, which encode proteins with a 10-amino acid difference, play opposite roles in rice (Oryza sativa) resistance against bacterial pathogens. Bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo), bacterial streak caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzicola (Xoc), and fungal blast caused by Magnaporthe grisea are devastating diseases of rice worldwide. OsWRKY45-1-overexpressing plants showed increased susceptibility and OsWRKY45-1-knockout plants showed enhanced resistance to Xoo and Xoc. In contrast, OsWRKY45-2-overexpressing plants showed enhanced resistance and OsWRKY45-2-suppressing plants showed increased susceptibility to Xoo and Xoc. Interestingly, both OsWRKY45-1- and OsWRKY45-2-overexpressing plants showed enhanced resistance to M. grisea. OsWRKY45-1-regulated Xoo resistance was accompanied by increased accumulation of salicylic acid and jasmonic acid and induced expression of a subset of defense-responsive genes, while OsWRKY45-2-regulated Xoo resistance was accompanied by increased accumulation of jasmonic acid but not salicylic acid and induced expression of another subset of defense-responsive genes. These results suggest that both OsWRKY45-1 and OsWRKY45-2 are positive regulators in rice resistance against M. grisea, but the former is a negative regulator and the latter is a positive regulator in rice resistance against Xoo and Xoc. The opposite roles of the two allelic genes in rice-Xoo interaction appear to be due to their mediation of different defense signaling pathways.
PNAS-2013-Inoue-1222155110.pdf	Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein Pb1 is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Disease Resistant Crops Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba 305-8602, Japan.	Panicle blast 1 (Pb1) is a panicle blast resistance gene derived from the indica rice cultivar "Modan." Pb1 encodes a coiled-coil-nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR) protein and confers durable, broad-spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae races. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying Pb1-mediated blast resistance. The Pb1 protein interacted with WRKY45, a transcription factor involved in induced resistance via the salicylic acid signaling pathway that is regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Pb1-mediated panicle blast resistance was largely compromised when WRKY45 was knocked down in a Pb1-containing rice cultivar. Leaf-blast resistance by Pb1 overexpression (Pb1-ox) was also compromised in WRKY45 knockdown/Pb1-ox rice. Blast infection induced higher accumulation of WRKY45 in Pb1-ox than in control Nipponbare rice. Overexpression of Pb1-Quad, a coiled-coil domain mutant that had weak interaction with WRKY45, resulted in significantly weaker blast resistance than that of wild-type Pb1. Overexpression of Pb1 with a nuclear export sequence failed to confer blast resistance to rice. These results suggest that the blast resistance of Pb1 depends on its interaction with WRKY45 in the nucleus. In a transient system using rice protoplasts, coexpression of Pb1 enhanced WRKY45 accumulation and increased WRKY45-dependent transactivation activity, suggesting that protection of WRKY45 from ubiquitin proteasome system degradation is possibly involved in Pb1-dependent blast resistance.
pp1370176.pdf	Annotations and functional analyses of the rice WRKY gene superfamily reveal positive and negative regulators of abscisic acid signaling in aleurone cells	2005	Plant Physiol	Department of Biological Sciences, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada 89154, USA.	The WRKY proteins are a superfamily of regulators that control diverse developmental and physiological processes. This family was believed to be plant specific until the recent identification of WRKY genes in nonphotosynthetic eukaryotes. We have undertaken a comprehensive computational analysis of the rice (Oryza sativa) genomic sequences and predicted the structures of 81 OsWRKY genes, 48 of which are supported by full-length cDNA sequences. Eleven OsWRKY proteins contain two conserved WRKY domains, while the rest have only one. Phylogenetic analyses of the WRKY domain sequences provide support for the hypothesis that gene duplication of single- and two-domain WRKY genes, and loss of the WRKY domain, occurred in the evolutionary history of this gene family in rice. The phylogeny deduced from the WRKY domain peptide sequences is further supported by the position and phase of the intron in the regions encoding the WRKY domains. Analyses for chromosomal distributions reveal that 26% of the predicted OsWRKY genes are located on chromosome 1. Among the dozen genes tested, OsWRKY24, -51, -71, and -72 are induced by abscisic acid (ABA) in aleurone cells. Using a transient expression system, we have demonstrated that OsWRKY24 and -45 repress ABA induction of the HVA22 promoter-beta-glucuronidase construct, while OsWRKY72 and -77 synergistically interact with ABA to activate this reporter construct. This study provides a solid base for functional genomics studies of this important superfamily of regulatory genes in monocotyledonous plants and reveals a novel function for WRKY genes, i.e. mediating plant responses to ABA.
tpj12035.pdf	The nuclear ubiquitin proteasome degradation affects WRKY45 function in the rice defense program	2012	Plant J	Disease Resistant Crops Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602, Japan.	The transcriptional activator WRKY45 plays a major role in the salicylic acid (SA)/benzothiadiazole-induced defense program in rice. Here, we show that the nuclear ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) plays a role in regulating the function of WRKY45. Proteasome inhibitors induced accumulation of polyubiquitinated WRKY45 and transient upregulation of WRKY45 target genes in rice cells, suggesting that WRKY45 is constantly degraded by the UPS to suppress defense responses in the absence of defense signals. Mutational analysis of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) indicated that UPS-dependent WRKY45 degradation occurs in the nuclei. Interestingly, transcriptional activity of WRKY45 after SA treatment was impaired by proteasome inhibition. The same C-terminal region in WRKY45 was essential for both transcriptional activity and UPS-dependent degradation. These results suggest that UPS regulation also plays a role in transcriptional activity of WRKY45. It has been reported that AtNPR1, the central regulator of the SA pathway in Arabidopsis, is regulated by the UPS. We found that OsNPR1/NH1, the rice counterpart of NPR1, was not stabilized by proteasome inhibition under an uninfected condition. We discuss the differences in the post-translational regulation of the SA-pathway components between rice and Arabidopsis. (c) 2012 The Authors. The Plant Journal (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs11103-012-9981-3.pdf	Functions of rice NAC transcriptional factors, ONAC122 and ONAC131, in defense responses against Magnaporthe grisea	2013	Plant Mol Biol	National Key Laboratory for Rice Biology, Institute of Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, China.	NAC (NAM/ATAF/CUC) transcription factors have important functions in regulating plant growth, development, and abiotic and biotic stress responses. Here, we characterized two rice pathogen-responsive NAC transcription factors, ONAC122 and ONAC131. We determined that these proteins localized to the nucleus when expressed ectopically and had transcriptional activation activities. ONAC122 and ONAC131 expression was induced after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of rice blast disease, and the M. grisea-induced expression of both genes was faster and higher in the incompatible interaction compared with the compatible interaction during early stages of infection. ONAC122 and ONAC131 were also induced by treatment with salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate or 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (a precursor of ethylene). Silencing ONAC122 or ONAC131 expression using a newly modified Brome mosaic virus (BMV)-based silencing vector resulted in an enhanced susceptibility to M. grisea. Furthermore, expression levels of several other defense- and signaling-related genes (i.e. OsLOX, OsPR1a, OsWRKY45 and OsNH1) were down-regulated in plants silenced for ONAC122 or ONAC131 expression via the BMV-based silencing system. Our results suggest that both ONAC122 and ONAC131 have important roles in rice disease resistance responses through the regulated expression of other defense- and signaling-related genes.
NA	Development of disease-resistant rice by optimized expression of WRKY45.	2014	Plant Biotechnol J	Disease Resistant Crops Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602, Japan.	The rice transcription factor WRKY45 plays a central role in the salicylic acid signalling pathway and mediates chemical-induced resistance to multiple pathogens, including Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Previously, we reported that rice transformants overexpressing WRKY45 driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter were strongly resistant to both pathogens; however, their growth and yield were negatively affected because of the trade-off between the two conflicting traits. Also, some unknown environmental factor(s) exacerbated this problem. Here, we report the development of transgenic rice lines resistant to both pathogens and with agronomic traits almost comparable to those of wild-type rice. This was achieved by optimizing the promoter driving WRKY45 expression. We isolated 16 constitutive promoters from rice genomic DNA and tested their ability to drive WRKY45 expression. Comparisons among different transformant lines showed that, overall, the strength of WRKY45 expression was positively correlated with disease resistance and negatively correlated with agronomic traits. We conducted field trials to evaluate the growth of transgenic and control lines. The agronomic traits of two lines expressing WRKY45 driven by the OsUbi7 promoter (PO sUbi7 lines) were nearly comparable to those of untransformed rice, and both lines were pathogen resistant. Interestingly, excessive WRKY45 expression rendered rice plants sensitive to low temperature and salinity, and stress sensitivity was correlated with the induction of defence genes by these stresses. These negative effects were barely observed in the PO sUbi7 lines. Moreover, their patterns of defence gene expression were similar to those in plants primed by chemical defence inducers.
NA	Development of disease-resistant rice by pathogen-responsive expression of WRKY45.	2015	Plant Biotechnol J	Disease Resistant Crops Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	WRKY45 is an important transcription factor in the salicylic acid signalling pathway in rice that mediates chemical-induced resistance against multiple pathogens. Its constitutive overexpression confers extremely strong resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae to rice, but has adverse effects on agronomic traits. Here, a new strategy to confer rice with strong disease resistance without any negative effects on agronomic traits was established by expressing WRKY45 under the control of pathogen-responsive promoters in combination with a translational enhancer derived from a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of rice alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Rice promoters that responded to M. oryzae and X. oryzae pv. oryzae infections within 24 h were identified, and 2-kb upstream sequences from nine of them were isolated, fused to WRKY45 cDNA with or without the ADH 5'-UTR, and introduced into rice. Although pathogen-responsive promoters alone failed to confer effective disease resistance, the use of the ADH 5'-UTR in combination with them, in particular the PR1b and GST promoters, enhanced disease resistance. Field trials showed that overall, PR1b promoter-driven (with ADH 5'-UTR) lines performed the best and one had agronomic traits comparable to control untransformed rice. Thus, expressing WRKY45 under the control of the PR1b promoter with the ADH 5'-UTR is an excellent strategy to develop disease-resistant rice, and the line established could serve as a mother line for breeding disease-resistant rice.
