OsWSS1	chloroplast	WATER-SOAKED SPOT1 Controls Chloroplast Development and Leaf Senescence via Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species Homeostasis in Rice.	 In addition, we found that the expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) was significantly higher, while the expression of genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis was significantly downregulated in oswss1 as compared with the wild type

OsWSS1	kinase	WATER-SOAKED SPOT1 Controls Chloroplast Development and Leaf Senescence via Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species Homeostasis in Rice.	 Map-based cloning revealed that OsWSS1 encodes transmembrane kinase TMK1
OsWSS1	map-based cloning	WATER-SOAKED SPOT1 Controls Chloroplast Development and Leaf Senescence via Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species Homeostasis in Rice.	 Map-based cloning revealed that OsWSS1 encodes transmembrane kinase TMK1
OsWSS1	photosynthesis	WATER-SOAKED SPOT1 Controls Chloroplast Development and Leaf Senescence via Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species Homeostasis in Rice.	 In addition, we found that the expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) was significantly higher, while the expression of genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis was significantly downregulated in oswss1 as compared with the wild type
OsWSS1	cell death	WATER-SOAKED SPOT1 Controls Chloroplast Development and Leaf Senescence via Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species Homeostasis in Rice.	 Mutation of OsWSS1 led to hyper-accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), more severe DNA fragmentation, and cell death than that of the wild-type control

In addition, we found that the expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) was significantly higher, while the expression of genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis was significantly downregulated in oswss1 as compared with the wild type
OsWSS1	plasma membrane	WATER-SOAKED SPOT1 Controls Chloroplast Development and Leaf Senescence via Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species Homeostasis in Rice.	 OsWSS1 was constitutively expressed in all tissues and its encoded protein is localized to the plasma membrane
OsWSS1	chlorophyll	WATER-SOAKED SPOT1 Controls Chloroplast Development and Leaf Senescence via Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species Homeostasis in Rice.	 Moreover, oswss1 exhibits slightly rolled leaves with irregular epidermal cells, decreased chlorophyll contents, and defective stomata and chloroplasts as compared with the wild type
OsWSS1	chlorophyll content	WATER-SOAKED SPOT1 Controls Chloroplast Development and Leaf Senescence via Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species Homeostasis in Rice.	 Moreover, oswss1 exhibits slightly rolled leaves with irregular epidermal cells, decreased chlorophyll contents, and defective stomata and chloroplasts as compared with the wild type
OsWSS1	reactive oxygen species	WATER-SOAKED SPOT1 Controls Chloroplast Development and Leaf Senescence via Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species Homeostasis in Rice.
