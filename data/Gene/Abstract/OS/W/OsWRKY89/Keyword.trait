OsWRKY89	abiotic stress	Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants	These results suggest that OsWRKY89 plays an important role in response to biotic and abiotic stresses
OsWRKY89	biotic stress	Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants	These results suggest that OsWRKY89 plays an important role in response to biotic and abiotic stresses
OsWRKY89	growth	Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants	Overexpression of OsWRKY89 led to growth retardation at the early stage and reduction of internode length
OsWRKY89	jasmonate	Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants	RNA gel blot analysis indicated that OsWRKY89 was strongly induced by treatments of methyl jasmonate and UV-B radiation
OsWRKY89	leaf	Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants	Scanning electron microscopy revealed an increase in wax deposition on leaf surfaces of the OsWRKY89 overexpression lines and a decrease in wax loading in the RNAi-mediated OsWRKY89 suppression lines
OsWRKY89	blast	Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants	Interestingly, overexpression of the OsWRKY89 gene enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus and white-backed planthopper as well as tolerance to UV-B irradiation
