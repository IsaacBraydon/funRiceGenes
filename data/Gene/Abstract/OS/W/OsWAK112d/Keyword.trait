OsWAK112d	resistance	Several wall-associated kinases participate positively and negatively in basal defense against rice blast fungus.	While OsWAK14, OsWAK91 and OsWAK92 positively regulate quantitative resistance, OsWAK112d is a negative regulator of blast resistance
OsWAK112d	blast	Several wall-associated kinases participate positively and negatively in basal defense against rice blast fungus.	While OsWAK14, OsWAK91 and OsWAK92 positively regulate quantitative resistance, OsWAK112d is a negative regulator of blast resistance
