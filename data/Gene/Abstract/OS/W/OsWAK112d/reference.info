NA	Several wall-associated kinases participate positively and negatively in basal defense against rice blast fungus.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	CIRAD, UMR BGPI INRA/CIRAD/SupAgro, Campus International de Baillarguet, TA A 54/K, 34398, Montpellier, France. amandine.delteil@laposte.net.	Receptor-like kinases are well-known to play key roles in disease resistance. Among them, the Wall-associated kinases (WAKs) have been shown to be positive regulators of fungal disease resistance in several plant species. WAK genes are often transcriptionally regulated during infection but the pathways involved in this regulation are not known. In rice, the OsWAK gene family is significantly amplified compared to Arabidopsis. The possibility that several WAKs participate in different ways to basal defense has not been addressed. Moreover, the direct requirement of rice OSWAK genes in regulating defense has not been explored.Here we show using rice (Oryza sativa) loss-of-function mutants of four selected OsWAK genes, that individual OsWAKs are required for quantitative resistance to the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. While OsWAK14, OsWAK91 and OsWAK92 positively regulate quantitative resistance, OsWAK112d is a negative regulator of blast resistance. In addition, we show that the very early transcriptional regulation of the rice OsWAK genes is triggered by chitin and is partially under the control of the chitin receptor CEBiP. Finally, we show that OsWAK91 is required for H2O2 production and sufficient to enhance defense gene expression during infection.We conclude that the rice OsWAK genes studied are part of basal defense response, potentially mediated by chitin from fungal cell walls. This work also shows that some OsWAKs, like OsWAK112d, may act as negative regulators of disease resistance.
NA	OsWAK112, A Wall-Associated Kinase, Negatively Regulates Salt Stress Responses by Inhibiting Ethylene Production.	2021	Front Plant Sci	Hebei Key Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Ministry of Education, Hebei Collaboration Innovation Center for Cell Signaling, College of Life Sciences, Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang, China.	The wall-associated kinase (WAK) multigene family plays critical roles in various cellular processes and stress responses in plants, however, whether WAKs are involved in salt tolerance is obscure. Herein, we report the functional characterization of a rice WAK, WAK112, whose expression is suppressed by salt. Overexpression of OsWAK112 in rice and heterologous expression of OsWAK112 in Arabidopsis significantly decreased plant survival under conditions of salt stress, while knocking down the OsWAK112 in rice increased plant survival under salt stress. OsWAK112 is universally expressed in plant and associated with cell wall. Meanwhile, in vitro kinase assays and salt tolerance analyses showed that OsWAK112 possesses kinase activity and that it plays a negative role in the response of plants to salt stress. In addition, OsWAK112 interacts with S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase (SAMS) 1/2/3, which catalyzes SAM synthesis from ATP and L-methionine, and promotes OsSAMS1 degradation under salt stress. Furthermore, in OsWAK112-overexpressing plants, there is a decreased SAMS content and a decreased ethylene content under salt stress. These results indicate that OsWAK112 negatively regulates plant salt responses by inhibiting ethylene production, possibly via direct binding with OsSAMS1/2/3.
