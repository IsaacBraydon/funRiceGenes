OsDEES1|OsWAK91	OsWAK112d|OsWAK112	Several wall-associated kinases participate positively and negatively in basal defense against rice blast fungus.	While OsWAK14, OsWAK91 and OsWAK92 positively regulate quantitative resistance, OsWAK112d is a negative regulator of blast resistance
OsSAMS1	OsWAK112d|OsWAK112	OsWAK112, A Wall-Associated Kinase, Negatively Regulates Salt Stress Responses by Inhibiting Ethylene Production.	 In addition, OsWAK112 interacts with S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase (SAMS) 1/2/3, which catalyzes SAM synthesis from ATP and L-methionine, and promotes OsSAMS1 degradation under salt stress
