OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsWRKY5	OsWRKY5 Promotes Rice Leaf Senescence via Senescence-Associated NAC and Abscisic Acid Biosynthesis Pathway.	 Furthermore, RT-qPCR and yeast one-hybrid analysis demonstrated that OsWRKY5 indirectly upregulates the expression of senescence-associated NAM/ATAF1/2/CUC2 (NAC) genes including OsNAP and OsNAC2
