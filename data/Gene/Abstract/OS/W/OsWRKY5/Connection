OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsWRKY5	OsWRKY5 Promotes Rice Leaf Senescence via Senescence-Associated NAC and Abscisic Acid Biosynthesis Pathway.	 Furthermore, RT-qPCR and yeast one-hybrid analysis demonstrated that OsWRKY5 indirectly upregulates the expression of senescence-associated NAM/ATAF1/2/CUC2 (NAC) genes including OsNAP and OsNAC2

Osmyb2	OsWRKY5	Inactivating transcription factor OsWRKY5 enhances drought tolerance through abscisic acid signaling pathways.	 Transcriptome deep sequencing and RT-qPCR analyses demonstrated that the expression of abiotic stress-related genes including rice MYB2 (OsMYB2) was upregulated in oswrky5 knockout mutants and downregulated in oswrky5-D mutants
Osmyb2	OsWRKY5	Inactivating transcription factor OsWRKY5 enhances drought tolerance through abscisic acid signaling pathways.	 Moreover, dual-luciferase, yeast one-hybrid, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that OsWRKY5 directly binds to the W-box sequences in the promoter region of OsMYB2 and represses OsMYB2 expression, thus downregulating genes downstream of OsMYB2 in the ABA signaling pathways
