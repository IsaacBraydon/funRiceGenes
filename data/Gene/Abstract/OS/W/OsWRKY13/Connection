OsPR1a	OsWRKY13	Suppression of expression of the putative receptor-like kinase gene NRRB enhances resistance to bacterial leaf streak in rice	 Furthermore, transcription of some salicylic acid synthesis-related and pathogenesis-related genes including PAD4, PR1a and WRKY13 in transgenic plants was activated, implying that enhanced resistance to BLS might be mediated by the activation of the SA signaling pathway
