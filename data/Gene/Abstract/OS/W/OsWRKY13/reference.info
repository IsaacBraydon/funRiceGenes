Bacterial leaf streak (BLS) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) is an important disease of rice, which is responsible for the economic losses worldwide. Functional investigation of differentially expressed protein genes (DEPGs) from rice (Oryza sativa L.) upon Xoc infection provides insight into the molecular mechanism of rice-Xoc interactions. Here, we show that one of DEPGs designated NRRB plays a role in rice-Xoc interactions. NRRB, a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase gene was preferentially expressed in leaf blades and leaf sheaths where the pathogen colonized. Its transcription was depressed by two defense-signal compounds salicylic acid and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic-acid, but was activated by wounding and abscisic acid. Additionally, a plenty of cis-elements associated with stress responses were discovered in the promoter region of NRRB. These data suggest that NRRB is involved in stress responses. More importantly, the NRRB-suppressing rice plants exhibited enhanced resistance against BLS, with the markedly shorter average lesion length than that of the wild type. Furthermore, transcription of some salicylic acid synthesis-related and pathogenesis-related genes including PAD4, PR1a and WRKY13 in transgenic plants was activated, implying that enhanced resistance to BLS might be mediated by the activation of the SA signaling pathway. In conclusion, NRRB gene is involved in various stress responses and regulating resistance to BLS, therefore it might be one of useful genes for rice improvement in future.
1471-2229-9-74.pdf	Exploring transcriptional signalling mediated by OsWRKY13, a potential regulator of multiple physiological processes in rice	2009	BMC Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, PR China. qiudeyun@hotmail.com	BACKGROUND: Rice transcription regulator OsWRKY13 influences the functioning of more than 500 genes in multiple signalling pathways, with roles in disease resistance, redox homeostasis, abiotic stress responses, and development. RESULTS: To determine the putative transcriptional regulation mechanism of OsWRKY13, the putative cis-acting elements of OsWRKY13-influenced genes were analyzed using the whole genome expression profiling of OsWRKY13-activated plants generated with the Affymetrix GeneChip Rice Genome Array. At least 39 transcription factor genes were influenced by OsWRKY13, and 30 of them were downregulated. The promoters of OsWRKY13-upregulated genes were overrepresented with W-boxes for WRKY protein binding, whereas the promoters of OsWRKY13-downregulated genes were enriched with cis-elements putatively for binding of MYB and AP2/EREBP types of transcription factors. Consistent with the distinctive distribution of these cis-elements in up- and downregulated genes, nine WRKY genes were influenced by OsWRKY13 and the promoters of five of them were bound by OsWRKY13 in vitro; all seven differentially expressed AP2/EREBP genes and six of the seven differentially expressed MYB genes were suppressed by in OsWRKY13-activated plants. A subset of OsWRKY13-influenced WRKY genes were involved in host-pathogen interactions. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that OsWRKY13-mediated signalling pathways are partitioned by different transcription factors. WRKY proteins may play important roles in the monitoring of OsWRKY13-upregulated genes and genes involved in pathogen-induced defence responses, whereas MYB and AP2/EREBP proteins may contribute most to the control of OsWRKY13-downregulated genes.
dingxinhua103283-self-201108-2.pdf	Identification of novel pathogen-responsive cis-elements and their binding proteins in the promoter of OsWRKY13, a gene regulating rice disease resistance	2008	Plant Cell Environ	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	The WRKY transcription factor superfamily controls diverse developmental and physiological processes in plants. However, little is known about the factors that directly regulate the function of WRKY genes. In this study, we identified cis-acting elements and their binding proteins of rice OsWRKY13, a gene that plays a pivotal role in disease resistance against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Two novel pathogen-responsive cis-elements, PRE2 and PRE4, were characterized from the promoter region of OsWRKY13. The two cis-elements negatively regulate gene expression without pathogen challenge, and positively regulate gene expression after pathogen-induced protein binding. OsWRKY13 binds to PRE4, which harbours a novel W-like box. Another five proteins (Rad51-like; tubby-like; SWIM zinc finger and nucleotide-binding adaptor shared by APAF-1, certain R proteins and CED-4 (NB-ARC) domain containing proteins; and an unknown protein) also bind to one of the two cis-elements. Different proteins interacting with the same cis-element appear to have different DNA-binding core sequences. These proteins localize in the nucleus and show differential expression upon pathogen challenge. These results suggest that OsWRKY13 expression is regulated by multiple factors to achieve disease resistance.
dingxinhua103283-self-201108-3.pdf	OsWRKY13 mediates rice disease resistance by regulating defense-related genes in salicylate- and jasmonate-dependent signaling	2007	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center for Plant Gene Research, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Although 109 WRKY genes have been identified in the rice genome, the functions of most are unknown. Here, we show that OsWRKY13 plays a pivotal role in rice disease resistance. Overexpression of OsWRKY13 can enhance rice resistance to bacterial blight and fungal blast, two of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide, at both the seedling and adult stages, and shows no influence on the fertility. This overexpression was accompanied by the activation of salicylic acid (SA) synthesis-related genes and SA-responsive genes and the suppression of jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis-related genes and JA-responsive genes. OsWRKY13 bound to the promoters of its own and at least three other genes in SA- and JA-dependent signaling pathways. Its DNA-binding activity was influenced by pathogen infection. These results suggest that OsWRKY13, as an activator of the SA-dependent pathway and a suppressor of JA-dependent pathways, mediates rice resistance by directly or indirectly regulating the expression of a subset of genes acting both upstream and downstream of SA and JA. Furthermore, OsWRKY13 will provide a transgenic tool for engineering wider-spectrum and whole-growth-stage resistance rice in breeding programs.
j.1744-7909.2007.00504.x.pdf	The WRKY Gene Family in Rice (Oryza sativa)	2007	J Integr Plant Biol	Bioinformatics Core, School of Life Sciences, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada 89154, USA	WRKY genes encode transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of various biological processes. These zinc-finger proteins, especially those members mediating stress responses, are uniquely expanded in plants. To facilitate the study of the evolutionary history and functions of this supergene family, we performed an exhaustive search for WRKY genes using HMMER and a Hidden Markov Model that was specifically trained for rice. This work resulted in a comprehensive list of WRKY gene models in Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and L. ssp. japonica. Mapping of these genes to individual chromosomes facilitated elimination of the redundant, leading to the identification of 98 WRKY genes in japonica and 102 in indica rice. These genes were further categorized according to the number and structure of their zinc-finger domains. Based on a phylogenetic tree of the conserved WRKY domains and the graphic display of WRKY loci on corresponding indica and japonica chromosomes, we identified possible WRKY gene duplications within, and losses between the two closely related rice subspecies. Also reviewed are the roles of WRKY genes in disease resistance and responses to salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, seed development and germination mediated by gibberellins, other developmental processes including senescence, and responses to abiotic stresses and abscisic acid in rice and other plants. The signaling pathways mediating WRKY gene expression are also discussed.
journal.pone.0059699.pdf	Functional analysis and expressional characterization of rice ankyrin repeat-containing protein, OsPIANK1, in basal defense against Magnaporthe oryzae attack	2013	PLoS One	College of Life Science, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.	The ankyrin repeat-containing protein gene OsPIANK1 (AK068021) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) was previously shown to be upregulated following infection with the rice leaf blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo). In this study, we further characterized the role of OsPIANK1 in basal defense against Magnaporthe oryzae (M.oryzae) by 5' deletion analysis of its promoter and overexpression of the gene. The promoter of OsPIANK1 with 1,985 bps in length was sufficient to induce the OsPIANK1 response to inoculation with M.oryzae and to exogenous application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or salicylic acid (SA), but not to exogenous application of abscisic acid (ABA). A TCA-element present in the region between -563 bp and -249 bp may be responsible for the OsPIANK1 response to both M.oryzae infection and exogenous SA application. The JERE box, CGTCA-box, and two MYB binding sites locating in the region between -1985 bp and -907 bp may be responsible for the response of OsPIANK1 to exogenous MeJA. OsPIANK1 expression was upregulated after inoculation with M.oryzae and after treatment with exogenous SA and MeJA. Overexpression of OsPIANK1 enhanced resistance of rice to M.oryzae, although it did not confer complete resistance. The enhanced resistance to M.oryzae was accompanied by enhanced transcriptional expression of SA- and JA-dependent genes such as NH1, WKRY13, PAL, AOS2, PR1b, and PR5. This evidence suggests that OsPIANK1 acted as a positive regulator in rice basal defense mediated by SA- and JA-signaling pathways.
Mol. Plant-2008-Qiu-538-51.pdf	Rice gene network inferred from expression profiling of plants overexpressing OsWRKY13, a positive regulator of disease resistance	2008	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Accumulating information indicates that plant disease resistance signaling pathways frequently interact with other pathways regulating developmental processes or abiotic stress responses. However, the molecular mechanisms of these types of crosstalk remain poorly understood in most cases. Here we report that OsWRKY13, an activator of rice resistance to both bacterial and fungal pathogens, appears to function as a convergent point for crosstalk among the pathogen-induced salicylate-dependent defense pathway and five other physiologic pathways. Genome-wide analysis of the expression profiles of OsWRKY13-overexpressing lines suggests that OsWRKY13 directly or indirectly regulates the expression of more than 500 genes that are potentially involved in different physiologic processes according to the classification of the Gene Ontology database. By comparing the expression patterns of genes functioning in known pathways or cellular processes of pathogen infection and the phenotypes between OsWRKY13-overexpressing and wild-type plants, our data suggest that OsWRKY13 is also a regulator of other physiologic processes during pathogen infection. The OsWRKY13-associated disease resistance pathway synergistically interacts via OsWRKY13 with the glutathione/glutaredoxin system and flavonoid biosynthesis pathway to monitor redox homeostasis and to putatively enhance the biosynthesis of antimicrobial flavonoid phytoalexins, respectively, in OsWRKY13-overexpressing lines. Meanwhile, the OsWRKY13-associated disease resistance pathway appears to interact antagonistically with the SNAC1-mediated abiotic stress defense pathway, jasmonic acid signaling pathway, and terpenoid metabolism pathway via OsWRKY13 to suppress salt and cold defense responses as well as to putatively retard rice growth and development.
NA	The WRKY45-2-WRKY13-WRKY42 Transcriptional Regulatory Cascade Is Required for Rice Resistance to Fungal Pathogen.	2015	Plant Physiol	Huazhong Agricultural University.	Blast caused by fungal Magnaporthe oryzae is a devastating disease of rice worldwide, and this fungus also infects barley. At least 11 rice WRKY transcription factors have been reported to regulate rice response to M. oryzae either positively or negatively. However, the relationships of these WRKYs in the rice defense signaling pathway against M. oryzae are unknown. Previous studies have revealed that rice WRKY13 (as a transcriptional repressor) and WRKY45-2 enhance resistance to M. oryzae. Here we show that rice WRKY42, functioning as a transcriptional repressor, suppresses resistance to M. oryzae. WRKY42-RNA interference (RNAi) and WRKY42-overexpressing (oe) plants showed increased resistance and susceptibility to M. oryzae, accompanied by increased or reduced jasmonate acid (JA) content, respectively, compared with wild-type plants. JA pretreatment enhanced the resistance of WRKY42-oe plants to M. oryzae. WRKY13 directly suppressed WRKY42. WRKY45-2, functioning as a transcriptional activator, directly activated WRKY13. In addition, WRKY13 directly suppressed WRKY45-2 by feedback regulation. The WRKY13-RNAi WRKY45-2-oe and WRKY13-oe WRKY42-oe double transgenic lines showed increased susceptibility to M. oryzae compared with WRKY45-2-oe and WRKY13-oe plants, respectively. These results suggest that the three WRKYs form a sequential transcriptional regulatory cascade. WRKY42 may negatively regulate rice response to M. oryzae by suppressing JA signaling-related genes, and WRKY45-2 transcriptionally activates WRKY13, whose encoding protein in turn transcriptionally suppresses WRKY42 to regulate rice resistance to M. oryzae.
NA	Gene network mediated by WRKY13 to regulate resistance against sheath infecting fungi in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2018	Plant Sci	School of Bio Sciences and Technology, Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, 632014, Tamil Nadu, India.	OsWRKY13 TF gene is known to play a regulatory role of signaling in physiological pathways related to either development or disease resistance in rice plants. Rice cultivars IR 50 and TRY 3, resistant and susceptible respectively to sheath blight, TRY 3 and CO 43 resistant and susceptible respectively to sheath rot were challenged with fungal pathogens and disease scoring was carried out. Percent Disease Index (PDI) was significantly higher in susceptible varieties than resistant varieties. RT-PCR and qPCR analyses of WRKY13 using RNA extracted from the plant tissues revealed higher WRKY13 expression in resistant varieties (both diseases) upon pathogen challenge compared to uninfected control and also the susceptible varieties. To compute and evaluate the possible molecular mechanism for observed resistance correlated to WRKY13 gene expression, rice gene expression profiles against bacterial leaf blight and leaf blast disease from ROAD database were used to prioritize the locus IDs that were used as input in RiceNet v2 tool. The expression of WRKY13-regulated TIFY9 gene was predicted and validated using RT-PCR and qRT-PCR along with WRKY12 and PR2. All three genes showed induced expression in R. solani challenged sheath blight resistant variety. WRKY12 and PR2 expression in S. oryzae challenged sheath rot resistant variety was higher. Agrobacterium mediated transformation was carried out in rice plants using overexpression construct of WRKY13 (agroinfection in seeds of varieties susceptible to sheath blight and sheath rot, followed by selection in antibiotic media, germinating and hardening of putative transgenic lines). Based on qPCR analysis, the expression level of WRKY13 and the co-expression levels of WRKY12, TIFY9 and PR2 were found higher in PCR-positive T1 plants compared to wild-type. Infection bioassays in the transgenic plants of both varieties revealed enhanced resistance to the pathogens. A mechanism by which WRKY13 would influence the MAPK cascade with TIFY9 acting as a mediator, is proposed.
NA	The CC-NB-LRR OsRLR1 mediates rice disease resistance through interaction with OsWRKY19	2020	Plant Biotechnol J	Rice Research Institute, Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, China.	Nucleotide-binding site, leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) resistance proteins are critical for plant resistance to pathogens; however, their mechanism of activation and signal transduction are still not well understood. We identified a mutation in an as yet uncharacterized rice coiled-coil (CC)-NB-LRR, Oryza sativa RPM1-like resistance gene 1 (OsRLR1), which leads to hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesions on the leaf blade and broad range resistance to the fungal pathogen Pyricularia oryzae (syn. Magnaporthe oryzae) and the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, together with strong growth reduction. Consistently, OsRLR1-overexpression lines showed enhanced resistance to both pathogens. Moreover, we found that OsRLR1 mediates the defence response through direct interaction in the nucleus with the transcription factor OsWRKY19. Down-regulation of OsWRKY19 in the rlr1 mutant compromised the HR-like phenotype and resistance response, and largely restored plant growth. OsWRKY19 binds to the promoter of OsPR10 to activate the defence response. Taken together, our data highlight the role of a new residue involved in the NB-LRR activation mechanism, allowing identification of a new NB-LRR downstream signalling pathway.
NA	Rice WRKY13 TF protein binds to motifs in the promoter region to regulate downstream disease resistance-related genes.	2023	Funct Integr Genomics	School of Bio Science and Technology, Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, 632014, India. jimmyjohn10290@gmail.com.	In plants, pathogen resistance is brought about by the binding of certain transcription factor (TF) proteins to the cis-elements of certain target genes. These cis-elements are present upstream in the motif of the promoters of each gene. This ensures the binding of a specific TF to a specific promoter, therefore regulating the expression of that gene. Therefore, the study of each promoter sequence of all the rice genes would help identify the target genes of a specific TF. Rice 1 kb upstream promoter sequences of 55,986 annotated genes were analyzed using the Perl program algorithm to detect WRKY13 binding motifs (bm). The resulting genes were grouped using Gene Ontology and gene set enrichment analysis. A gene with more than 4 TF bm in their promoter was selected. Ten genes reported to have a role in rice disease resistance were selected for further analysis. Cis-acting regulatory element analysis was carried out to find the cis-elements and confirm the presence of the corresponding motifs in the promoter sequences of these genes. The 3D structure of WRKY13 TF and the corresponding ten genes were built, and the interacting residues were determined. The binding capacity of WRKY13 to the promoter of these selected genes was analyzed using docking studies. WRKY13 was considered for docking analysis based on the prior reports of autoregulation. Molecular dynamic simulations provided more details regarding the interactions. Expression data revealed the expression of the genes that helped provide the mechanism of interaction. Further co-expression network helped to characterize the interaction of these selected disease resistance-related genes with the WRKY13 TF protein. This study suggests downstream target genes that are regulated by the WRKY13 TF. The molecular mechanism involving the gene network regulated by WRKY13 TF in disease resistance against rice fungal pathogens is explored.
