OsWRKY115	 Only the LOC_Os07g27670 expression level encoding the OsWRKY115 transcription factor on the locus was specifically induced by cold stress in the cold-tolerant cultivar |  Overexpression and knockout of OsWRKY115 significantly affected cold tolerance in seedlings |  Our experiments identified OsWRKY115 as a novel regulatory gene associated with cold response in rice, and the Kong-Yu-131 allele with specific cold-induced expression may be an important molecular variant	 Overexpression and knockout of OsWRKY115 significantly affected cold tolerance in seedlings
