NA	OsWRKY115 on qCT7 links to cold tolerance in rice.	2022	Theor Appl Genet	Key Laboratory of Germplasm Enhancement, Physiology and Ecology of Food Crops in Cold Region, Ministry of Education, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin, 150030, China.	qCT7, a novel QTL for increasing seedling cold tolerance in rice, was fine-mapped to a 70.9-kb region on chromosome 7, and key OsWRKY115 was identified in transgenic plants. Cold stress caused by underground cold-water irrigation seriously limits rice productivity. We systemically measured the cold-responsive traits of 2,570 F2 individuals derived from two widely cultivated rice cultivars, Kong-Yu-131 and Dong-Nong-422, to identify the major genomic regions associated with cold tolerance. A novel major QTL, qCT7, was mapped on chromosome 7 associated with the cold tolerance and survival, using whole-genome re-sequencing with bulked segregant analysis. Local QTL linkage analysis with F(2) and fine mapping with recombinant plant revealed a 70.9-kb core region on qCT7 encoding 13 protein-coding genes. Only the LOC_Os07g27670 expression level encoding the OsWRKY115 transcription factor on the locus was specifically induced by cold stress in the cold-tolerant cultivar. Moreover, haplotype analysis and the KASP8 marker indicated that OsWRKY115 was significantly associated with cold tolerance. Overexpression and knockout of OsWRKY115 significantly affected cold tolerance in seedlings. Our experiments identified OsWRKY115 as a novel regulatory gene associated with cold response in rice, and the Kong-Yu-131 allele with specific cold-induced expression may be an important molecular variant.
