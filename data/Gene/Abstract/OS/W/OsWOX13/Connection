OsWOX13	RAB21|Rab16A|OsRab16A	A WUSCHEL Homeobox Transcription Factor, OsWOX13, Enhances Drought Tolerance and Triggers Early Flowering in Rice.	 Overexpression of OsWOX13 (OsWOX13-ov) in rice under the rab21 promoter resulted in drought resistance and early flowering by 7-10 days
OsWOX13	RISBZ1|OsbZIP58|OsSMF1	Rice protein-binding microarrays: a tool to detect cis-acting elements near promoter regions in rice	 To confirm the efficiency of RPBM technology, we selected two previously studied TFs, OsWOX13 and OsSMF1, and an uncharacterized TF, OsWRKY34
OsWOX13	RISBZ1|OsbZIP58|OsSMF1	Rice protein-binding microarrays: a tool to detect cis-acting elements near promoter regions in rice	 We identified the ATTGATTG and CCACGTCA DNA-binding sequences of OsWOX13 and OsSMF1, respectively
OsWOX13	RISBZ1|OsbZIP58|OsSMF1	Rice protein-binding microarrays: a tool to detect cis-acting elements near promoter regions in rice	 In total, 635 and 932 putative feature genes were identified for OsWOX13 and OsSMF1, respectively
