NA	A WUSCHEL Homeobox Transcription Factor, OsWOX13, Enhances Drought Tolerance and Triggers Early Flowering in Rice.	2018	Mol Cells	Department of Bioscience and Bioinformatics, Myongji University, Yongin 17058, Korea.	Plants have evolved strategies to cope with drought stress by maximizing physiological capacity and adjusting developmental processes such as flowering time. The WOX13 orthologous group is the most conserved among the clade of WOX homeodomain-containing proteins and is found to function in both drought stress and flower development. In this study, we isolated and characterized OsWOX13 from rice. OsWOX13<U+00A0>was regulated spatially in vegetative organs but temporally in flowers and seeds. Overexpression of OsWOX13 (OsWOX13-ov) in rice under the rab21 promoter resulted in drought resistance and early flowering by 7-10 days. Screening of gene expression profiles in mature leaf and panicles of OsWOX13-ov showed a broad spectrum of effects on biological processes, such as abiotic and biotic stresses, exerting a cross-talk between responses. Protein binding microarray and electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses supported ATTGATTG as the putative cis-element binding of OsWOX13. OsDREB1A<U+00A0>and OsDREB1F, drought stress response transcription factors, contain ATTGATTG motif(s) in their promoters and are preferentially expressed in OsWOX13-ov. In addition, Heading date 3a and OsMADS14, regulators in the flowering pathway and development, were enhanced in OsWOX13-ov. These results suggest that OsWOX13 mediates the stress response and early flowering and, thus, may be a regulator of genes involved in drought escape.
NA	Rice protein-binding microarrays: a tool to detect cis-acting elements near promoter regions in rice	2021	Planta	Department of Biosciences and Bioinformatics, Myongji University, 116 Myongji-ro, Cheoin-gu, Yongin, Gyeonggi-do, 17060, Republic of Korea.	The present study showed that a rice (Oryza sativa)-specific protein-binding microarray (RPBM) can be applied to analyze DNA-binding motifs with a TF where binding is evaluated in extended natural promoter regions. The analysis may facilitate identifying TFs and their downstream genes and constructing gene networks through cis-elements. Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level by binding a specific DNA sequence. Thus, predicting the DNA-binding motifs of TFs is one of the most important areas in the functional analysis of TFs in the postgenomic era. Although many methods have been developed to address this challenge, many TFs still have unknown DNA-binding motifs. In this study, we designed RPBM with 40-bp probes and 20-bp of overlap, yielding 49 probes spanning the 1-kb upstream region before the translation start site of each gene in the entire genome. To confirm the efficiency of RPBM technology, we selected two previously studied TFs, OsWOX13 and OsSMF1, and an uncharacterized TF, OsWRKY34. We identified the ATTGATTG and CCACGTCA DNA-binding sequences of OsWOX13 and OsSMF1, respectively. In total, 635 and 932 putative feature genes were identified for OsWOX13 and OsSMF1, respectively. We discovered the CGTTGACTTT DNA-binding sequence and 195 putative feature genes of OsWRKY34. RPBM could be applicable in the analysis of DNA-binding motifs for TFs where binding is evaluated in the promoter and 5' upstream CDS regions. The analysis may facilitate identifying TFs and their downstream genes and constructing gene networks through cis-elements.
