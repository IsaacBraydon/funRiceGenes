OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsWRKY29	WRKY Transcription Factor OsWRKY29 Represses Seed Dormancy in Rice by Weakening Abscisic Acid Response.	 In addition, the expression levels of ABA positive response factors OsVP1 and OsABF1 were higher in the OsWRKY29 mutants but were lower in its overexpression lines
OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsWRKY29	WRKY Transcription Factor OsWRKY29 Represses Seed Dormancy in Rice by Weakening Abscisic Acid Response.	 Further assays showed that OsWRKY29 could bind to the promoters of OsABF1 and OsVP1 to inhibit their expression
OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsWRKY29	WRKY Transcription Factor OsWRKY29 Represses Seed Dormancy in Rice by Weakening Abscisic Acid Response.	 In summary, we identified a new ABA signaling repressor OsWRKY29 that represses seed dormancy by directly downregulating the expression of OsABF1 and OsVP1
