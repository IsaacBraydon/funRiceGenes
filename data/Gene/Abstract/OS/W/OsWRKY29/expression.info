OsWRKY29	 The genetic analyses showed that both knockout and RNAi lines of OsWRKY29 had enhanced seed dormancy whereas its overexpression lines displayed reduced seed dormancy |  When treated with ABA, OsWRKY29 knockout and RNAi lines showed greater sensitivity than its overexpression lines |  In addition, the expression levels of ABA positive response factors OsVP1 and OsABF1 were higher in the OsWRKY29 mutants but were lower in its overexpression lines |  Further assays showed that OsWRKY29 could bind to the promoters of OsABF1 and OsVP1 to inhibit their expression |  In summary, we identified a new ABA signaling repressor OsWRKY29 that represses seed dormancy by directly downregulating the expression of OsABF1 and OsVP1	 The genetic analyses showed that both knockout and RNAi lines of OsWRKY29 had enhanced seed dormancy whereas its overexpression lines displayed reduced seed dormancy |  When treated with ABA, OsWRKY29 knockout and RNAi lines showed greater sensitivity than its overexpression lines |  In addition, the expression levels of ABA positive response factors OsVP1 and OsABF1 were higher in the OsWRKY29 mutants but were lower in its overexpression lines	 The genetic analyses showed that both knockout and RNAi lines of OsWRKY29 had enhanced seed dormancy whereas its overexpression lines displayed reduced seed dormancy |  When treated with ABA, OsWRKY29 knockout and RNAi lines showed greater sensitivity than its overexpression lines
