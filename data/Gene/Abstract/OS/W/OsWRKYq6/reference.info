NA	Applying HPLC to Screening QTLs for BLB Resistance in Rice.	2021	Plants (Basel)	Biosafety Division, National Academy of Agricultural Science, Rural Development Administration, Jeonju 54874, Korea.	Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) is caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and is a major cause of rice yield reductions around the world. When diseased, plants produce a variety of metabolites to resist pathogens. In this study, the various defense metabolites were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after Xoo inoculation in a 120 Cheongcheong/Nagdong double haploid (CNDH) population. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was conducted using the concentration of the plant defense metabolites. HPLC analyzes the concentration of substances according to the severity of disease symptoms. Searching for BLB resistance candidate genes by applying this analysis method is very effective when mapping related genes. These resistance genes can be mapped directly to the causative pathogens. A total of 17 metabolites were detected by means of HPLC analysis after Xoo inoculation in the 120 CNDH population. QTL mapping of the metabolite concentrations resulted in the detection of the BLB resistance candidate gene, OsWRKYq6, in RM3343 of chromosome 6. OsWRKYq6 has a very high homology sequence with WRKY transcription factor 39, and when inoculated with Xoo, the relative expression level of the resistant population was higher than that of the susceptible population. Resistance genes have previously been detected using only phenotypic change data. In this study, resistance candidate genes were detected using the concentration of metabolites produced in plants after inoculation with pathogens. This newly developed analysis method can be used to effectively detect and identify genes directly involved in disease resistance for future studies.
