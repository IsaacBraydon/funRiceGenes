OsWRKYq6	transcription factor	Applying HPLC to Screening QTLs for BLB Resistance in Rice.	 OsWRKYq6 has a very high homology sequence with WRKY transcription factor 39, and when inoculated with Xoo, the relative expression level of the resistant population was higher than that of the susceptible population
