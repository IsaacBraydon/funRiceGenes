OsWRKY22	biotic stress	OsWRKY22, a monocot WRKY gene, plays a role in the resistance response to blast	In contrast, inquiring a subset of biotic stress-related Affymetrix data, a large number of resistance and defence-related genes were found to be putatively co-expressed with OsWRKY22
OsWRKY22	blast	OsWRKY22, a monocot WRKY gene, plays a role in the resistance response to blast	oryzae strain, confirming that OsWRKY22 is involved in rice resistance to blast
OsWRKY22	blast	OsWRKY22, a monocot WRKY gene, plays a role in the resistance response to blast	OsWRKY22, a monocot WRKY gene, plays a role in the resistance response to blast
OsWRKY22	tolerance	Transcription factor WRKY22 promotes aluminum tolerance via activation of OsFRDL4 expression and enhancement of citrate secretion in rice (Oryza sativa).	 We conclude that OsWRKY22 promotes Al-induced increases in OsFRDL4 expression, thus enhancing Al-induced citrate secretion and Al tolerance in rice
OsWRKY22	stress	Transcription factor WRKY22 promotes aluminum tolerance via activation of OsFRDL4 expression and enhancement of citrate secretion in rice (Oryza sativa).	 We define the role of OsWRKY22 in response to Al stress in rice by using mutation and transgenic complementation assays, and characterize the regulation of OsFRDL4 by OsWRKY22 via yeas one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and ChIP-quantitative PCR
OsWRKY22	Al tolerance	Transcription factor WRKY22 promotes aluminum tolerance via activation of OsFRDL4 expression and enhancement of citrate secretion in rice (Oryza sativa).	 We conclude that OsWRKY22 promotes Al-induced increases in OsFRDL4 expression, thus enhancing Al-induced citrate secretion and Al tolerance in rice
OsWRKY22	transcriptional activator	Transcription factor WRKY22 promotes aluminum tolerance via activation of OsFRDL4 expression and enhancement of citrate secretion in rice (Oryza sativa).	 We next show that OsWRKY22 is localized in the nucleus, functions as a transcriptional activator and is able to bind to the promoter of OsFRDL4 via W-box elements
