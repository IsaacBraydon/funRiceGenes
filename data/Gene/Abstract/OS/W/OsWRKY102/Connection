OsWRKY102	OsWRKY88	Binding of stress-responsive OsWRKY proteins through WRKYGQK heptapeptide residue with the promoter region of two rice blast disease resistance genes Pi2 and Pi54 is important for development of blast resistance.	 The WRKY proteins (OsWRKY88 and OsWRKY102), whose transcript levels decrease when drought and blast stresses are overlapped, interact with the two resistance genes mostly involving the residues of the zinc finger structure
