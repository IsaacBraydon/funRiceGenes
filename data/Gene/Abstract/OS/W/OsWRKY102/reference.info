NA	Double knockout of OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102 boosts lignification with altering culm morphology of rice 	2020	Plant Sci	Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere, Kyoto University, Uji, Kyoto, 611-0011, Japan.	Breeding to enrich lignin, a major component of lignocelluloses, in plants contributes to enhanced applications of lignocellulosic biomass into solid biofuels and valuable aromatic chemicals. To collect information on enhancing lignin deposition in grass species, important lignocellulose feedstocks, we generated rice (Oryza sativa) transgenic lines deficient in OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102, which encode putative transcriptional repressors for secondary cell wall formation. We used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis and closely characterized their altered cell walls using chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods. Both OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102 mutations significantly increased lignin content by up to 28 % and 32 %, respectively. Additionally, OsWRKY36/OsWRKY102-double-mutant lines displayed lignin enrichment of cell walls (by up to 41 %) with substantially altered culm morphology over the single-mutant lines as well as the wild-type controls. Our chemical and NMR analyses showed that relative abundances of guaiacyl and p-coumarate units were slightly higher and lower, respectively, in the WRKY mutant lignins compared with those in the wild-type lignins. Our results provide evidence that both OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102 are associated with repression of rice lignification. 
NA	Binding of stress-responsive OsWRKY proteins through WRKYGQK heptapeptide residue with the promoter region of two rice blast disease resistance genes Pi2 and Pi54 is important for development of blast resistance.	2023	3 Biotech	Varanasi, 221005 India Department of Mycology and Plant Pathology, Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Banaras Hindu University. GRID: grid.411507.6. ISNI: 0000 0001 2287 8816	Molecular docking was done to investigate the interactions between five differentially expressed rice WRKY proteins when challenged with the rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae and drought stresses applied either individually or overlapped, with the promoter region of two blast resistance genes (Pi2 and Pi54). Molecular docking was performed using the HDOCK server. Initially, the homology models for each of the five rice WRKY proteins were prepared using I-TASSER server, and then the secondary structure as well as the DNA-binding pockets were predicted using PSIPRED and BindUP servers, respectively. The molecular docking study revealed a differential binding pattern of the rice WRKYs with the two blast resistance genes. The WRKY proteins (OsWRKY88 and OsWRKY102), whose transcript levels decrease when drought and blast stresses are overlapped, interact with the two resistance genes mostly involving the residues of the zinc finger structure. On the other hand, the WRKY proteins (OsWRKY53-1 and OsWRKY113), whose transcript levels did not reduce significantly when challenged by drought and blast overlapped condition compared to individual treatment of blast, interact mostly involving the residues of the conserved WRKYGQK heptapeptide sequence. Interestingly, the protein OsWRKY74 whose transcript levels are unaffected in both individual and overlapped stresses, interacts with both the blast resistance genes involving few residues of both WRKYGQK heptapeptide and the zinc finger structure. The findings thus indicate that the interaction of OsWRKY proteins involving the conserved WRKYGQK heptapeptide sequence with the blast resistance genes Pi2 and Pi54 is important to mitigate the blast challenge in rice even during overlapping challenges of drought.
