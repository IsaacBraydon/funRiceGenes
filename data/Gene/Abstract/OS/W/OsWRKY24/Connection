OsWRKY24	OsWRKY71	A negative regulator encoded by a rice WRKY gene represses both abscisic acid and gibberellins signaling in aleurone cells	Third, unlike OsWRKY71, OsWRKY24 is stable upon GA treatment
OsWRKY24	OsWRKY72	Annotations and functional analyses of the rice WRKY gene superfamily reveal positive and negative regulators of abscisic acid signaling in aleurone cells	Using a transient expression system, we have demonstrated that OsWRKY24 and -45 repress ABA induction of the HVA22 promoter-beta-glucuronidase construct, while OsWRKY72 and -77 synergistically interact with ABA to activate this reporter construct
OsDREB4-2|CR250|OsAP2	OsWRKY24	Overexpression of OsAP2 and OsWRKY24 in Arabidopsis results in reduction of plant size.	Overexpression of OsAP2 and OsWRKY24 in Arabidopsis results in reduction of plant size.
OsDREB4-2|CR250|OsAP2	OsWRKY24	Overexpression of OsAP2 and OsWRKY24 in Arabidopsis results in reduction of plant size.	Recently, two rice genes, OsAPETALA2 (OsAP2) and OsWRKY24 have been reported to be positive regulators involved in increased lamina inclination and grain size through cell elongation
OsI-BAK1	OsWRKY24	Silencing a Simple Extracellular Leucine-Rich Repeat Gene OsI-BAK1 Enhances the Resistance of Rice to Brown Planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.	 Silencing OsI-BAK1 (ir-ibak1) in rice enhanced the BPH-induced transcript levels of three defense-related WRKY genes (OsWRKY24, OsWRKY53 and OsWRKY70) but decreased the induced levels of ethylene
OsWRKY24	OsWRKY53	Silencing a Simple Extracellular Leucine-Rich Repeat Gene OsI-BAK1 Enhances the Resistance of Rice to Brown Planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.	 Silencing OsI-BAK1 (ir-ibak1) in rice enhanced the BPH-induced transcript levels of three defense-related WRKY genes (OsWRKY24, OsWRKY53 and OsWRKY70) but decreased the induced levels of ethylene
OsWRKY24	WRKY70|OsWRKY70	Silencing a Simple Extracellular Leucine-Rich Repeat Gene OsI-BAK1 Enhances the Resistance of Rice to Brown Planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.	 Silencing OsI-BAK1 (ir-ibak1) in rice enhanced the BPH-induced transcript levels of three defense-related WRKY genes (OsWRKY24, OsWRKY53 and OsWRKY70) but decreased the induced levels of ethylene
OsWRKY24	OsWRKY53	Functions of OsWRKY24, OsWRKY70 and OsWRKY53 in regulating grain size in rice.	Functions of OsWRKY24, OsWRKY70 and OsWRKY53 in regulating grain size in rice.
OsWRKY24	OsWRKY53	Functions of OsWRKY24, OsWRKY70 and OsWRKY53 in regulating grain size in rice.	OsWRKY24 functions redundantly with OsWRKY53, while OsWRKY70 functions differently from OsWRKY53 in regulating grain size
OsWRKY24	OsWRKY53	Functions of OsWRKY24, OsWRKY70 and OsWRKY53 in regulating grain size in rice.	 However, whether the OsWRKY53 homologs OsWRKY24 and OsWRKY70 also contribute to grain size which remains unknown
OsWRKY24	OsWRKY53	Functions of OsWRKY24, OsWRKY70 and OsWRKY53 in regulating grain size in rice.	 However, the oswrky24 oswrky53 double mutant produced smaller grains than the oswrky53 single mutant, indicating functional redundancy between OsWRKY24 and OsWRKY53
OsWRKY24	OsWRKY53	Functions of OsWRKY24, OsWRKY70 and OsWRKY53 in regulating grain size in rice.	 Importantly, a systematic characterization of seed length in the oswrky70 single, the oswrky53 oswrky70 double and the oswrky24 oswrky53 oswrky70 triple mutant indicated that loss of OsWRKY70 also leads to increased seed length, suggesting that OsWRKY70 might play a role distinct from that of OsWRKY53 in regulating grain size
OsWRKY24	OsWRKY53	Functions of OsWRKY24, OsWRKY70 and OsWRKY53 in regulating grain size in rice.	 Taken together, these findings suggest that OsWRKY24 and OsWRKY70 regulate rice grain size redundantly and independently from OsWRKY53
