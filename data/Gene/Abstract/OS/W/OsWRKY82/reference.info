China	WRKY transcription factors are involved in the regulation of response to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. A full-length cDNA clone of rice WRKY82 gene (OsWRKY82) was isolated from a cDNA library generated from leaves infected by Magnaporthe grisea. OsWRKY82 contained an entire open reading frame in length of 1701 bp, and was predicted to encode a polypeptide of 566 amino acid residues consisting of two WRKY domains, each with a zinc finger motif of C(2)H(2), belonging to the WRKY subgroup I. OsWRKY82 shared high identity at the amino acid level with those from Sorghum bicolor, Hordeum vulgare, and Zea mays. The transcript level of OsWRKY82 was relatively higher in stems, leaves, and flowers, and less abundant in grains. It was induced by inoculation with M grisea and Rhizoctonia solani. However, the inducible expression in incompatible rice-M grisea interactions was earlier and greater than that in compatible interactions. The expression of OsWRKY82 was up-regulated by methyl jasmonate and ethephon, whereas salicylic acid exerted no effects on its expression. Moreover, OsWRKY82 exhibited transcriptional activation ability in yeast. Additionally, OsWRKY82 transcripts could be induced by wounding and heat shocking, but not by abscisic acid, cold, high salinity and dehydration. By contrast, gibberellin suppressed the expression of OsWRKY82. These indicate that OsWRKY82 is a multiply stress-inducible gene responding to both biotic and abiotic stresses, and may be involved in the regulation of defense response to pathogens and tolerance against abiotic stresses by jasmonic acid/ethylene-dependent signaling pathway.

These zinc-finger proteins, especially those members mediating stress responses, are uniquely expanded in plants. To facilitate the study of the evolutionary history and functions of this supergene family, we performed an exhaustive search for WRKY genes using HMMER and a Hidden Markov Model that was specifically trained for rice. This work resulted in a comprehensive list of WRKY gene models in Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and L. ssp. japonica. Mapping of these genes to individual chromosomes facilitated elimination of the redundant, leading to the identification of 98 WRKY genes in japonica and 102 in indica rice. These genes were further categorized according to the number and structure of their zinc-finger domains. Based on a phylogenetic tree of the conserved WRKY domains and the graphic display of WRKY loci on corresponding indica and japonica chromosomes, we identified possible WRKY gene duplications within, and losses between the two closely related rice subspecies. Also reviewed are the roles of WRKY genes in disease resistance and responses to salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, seed development and germination mediated by gibberellins, other developmental processes including senescence, and responses to abiotic stresses and abscisic acid in rice and other plants. The signaling pathways mediating WRKY gene expression are also discussed.
