OsWRKY51	OsWRKY71	Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells	To address the cross-talk of GA and ABA signaling, we studied two rice WRKY genes (OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY71) that are ABA-inducible and GA-repressible in embryos and aleurone cells
OsWRKY51	OsWRKY71	Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells	The physical interactions of OsWRKY71 proteins themselves and that of OsWRKY71 and OsWRKY51 are revealed in the nuclei of aleurone cells using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays
OsWRKY51	OsWRKY71	Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells	Although OsWRKY51 itself does not bind to the Amy32b promoter in vitro, it interacts with OsWRKY71 and enhances the binding affinity of OsWRKY71 to W boxes in the Amy32b promoter
OsWRKY51	OsWRKY71	Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells	In contrast, the third non-DNA-binding mutant enhances GA induction of Amy32b-GUS, by interfering with the binding of the wild-type OsWRKY71 or the OsWRKY71/OsWRKY51 repressing complex
OsPR10a|PBZ1	OsWRKY51	OsWRKY51, a rice transcription factor, functions as a positive regulator in defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	OsWRKY51 bound to the W-box and WLE1 elements of the OsPR10a promoter
OsPR10a|PBZ1	OsWRKY51	OsWRKY51, a rice transcription factor, functions as a positive regulator in defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	Based on these results, we suggest that OsWRKY51 is a positive transcriptional regulator of defense signaling and has direct DNA binding ability to the promoter of OsPR10a, although it is reported to be a negative regulator in GA signaling
OsWRKY10	OsWRKY51	WRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades in rice are involved in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance 	 In the first transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of OsWRKY10 whereas OsWRKY51 acted upstream
OsWRKY47	OsWRKY51	WRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades in rice are involved in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance 	 In the first transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of OsWRKY10 whereas OsWRKY51 acted upstream
