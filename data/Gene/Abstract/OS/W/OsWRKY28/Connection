OSBZ8|OsbZIP05	OsWRKY28	OsWRKY28 positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice.	 Under salt stress treatment, the expression levels of OsbZIP05, OsHKT1;1 and OsDREB1B were significantly lower yet the level of OsHKT2;1 was significantly higher in oswrky28 mutants than those in wide type plants
OsDREB1B	OsWRKY28	OsWRKY28 positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice.	OsWRKY28 positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice.
OsDREB1B	OsWRKY28	OsWRKY28 positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice.	OsWRKY28 confers salinity tolerance by directly binding to OsDREB1B promoter and increasing its transcriptional activity, and negatively regulates abscisic acid mediated seedling establishment in rice
OsDREB1B	OsWRKY28	OsWRKY28 positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice.	 Under salt stress treatment, the expression levels of OsbZIP05, OsHKT1;1 and OsDREB1B were significantly lower yet the level of OsHKT2;1 was significantly higher in oswrky28 mutants than those in wide type plants
OsDREB1B	OsWRKY28	OsWRKY28 positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice.	 Our data of yeast one-hybrid assay and dual-luciferase assay supported that OsWRKY28 could directly bind to the promoter of OsDREB1B to enhance salinity tolerance in rice
OsDREB1B	OsWRKY28	OsWRKY28 positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice.	 Together, OsWRKY28 confers salinity tolerance through directly targeting OsDREB1B promoter and further activating its transcription in rice
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsWRKY28	OsWRKY28 positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice.	 Under salt stress treatment, the expression levels of OsbZIP05, OsHKT1;1 and OsDREB1B were significantly lower yet the level of OsHKT2;1 was significantly higher in oswrky28 mutants than those in wide type plants
OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	OsWRKY28	OsWRKY28 positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice.	 Under salt stress treatment, the expression levels of OsbZIP05, OsHKT1;1 and OsDREB1B were significantly lower yet the level of OsHKT2;1 was significantly higher in oswrky28 mutants than those in wide type plants
OsMPK11|OsMAPK11	OsWRKY28	OsWRKY28 positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice.	 Based on the results of yeast two-hybrid assay and GAL4-dependent chimeric transactivation assay, OsWRKY28 physically interacts with OsMPK11 and its transcriptional activity could be regulated by OsMPK11
