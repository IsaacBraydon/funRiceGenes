NA	Expression of OsWNK9 in Arabidopsis conferred tolerance to salt and drought stress.	2018	Plant Sci	Department of Biological Sciences, Birla Institute of Technology &amp; Science Pilani, K. K. Birla Goa Campus, Goa, 403726, India.	With No Lysine (WNK) kinase belongs to ser/thr protein kinase group in which conserved catalytic lysine (K) residue of subdomain II is shifted to subdomain I. In this study, we cloned full-length coding region of WNK9 from Oryza sativa (OsWNK9) and performed in silico studies to confirm the presence of all kinase signature regulatory elements. The transcript analysis revealed that OsWNK9 was strongly down regulated under salinity, drought and ABA stress in shoots. Constitutive expression of OsWNK9 in Arabidopsis thaliana imparted increased tolerance to salt, drought, and ABA stress. Transgenic lines showed healthy phenotypes such as green leaves, achieved higher fresh weight and longer roots under salt, drought and ABA stress as compared to wild-type (WT). Transgenic plants showed better seed germination, higher chlorophyll retention and less water loss under salt and drought stress compared to WT. Promoter/gene expression studies revealed that OsWNK9 were expressed throughout plant tissues with higher expression in roots. Subcellular localization studies of OsWNK9 showed their presence in the nucleus. The transcript analysis of abiotic stress marker genes and ABA dependent genes showed they were highly expressed in transgenic lines compared to WT in response to salt and drought stress. The endogenous ABA level under salt and drought stress in transgenic lines was higher than WT. The results indicated that OsWNK9 may regulate salt and drought response in ABA dependent manner.
