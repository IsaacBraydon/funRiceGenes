NA	Expression of OsWNK9 in Arabidopsis conferred tolerance to salt and drought stress.	2018	Plant Sci	Department of Biological Sciences, Birla Institute of Technology &amp; Science Pilani, K. K. Birla Goa Campus, Goa, 403726, India.	With No Lysine (WNK) kinase belongs to ser/thr protein kinase group in which conserved catalytic lysine (K) residue of subdomain II is shifted to subdomain I. In this study, we cloned full-length coding region of WNK9 from Oryza sativa (OsWNK9) and performed in silico studies to confirm the presence of all kinase signature regulatory elements. The transcript analysis revealed that OsWNK9 was strongly down regulated under salinity, drought and ABA stress in shoots. Constitutive expression of OsWNK9 in Arabidopsis thaliana imparted increased tolerance to salt, drought, and ABA stress. Transgenic lines showed healthy phenotypes such as green leaves, achieved higher fresh weight and longer roots under salt, drought and ABA stress as compared to wild-type (WT). Transgenic plants showed better seed germination, higher chlorophyll retention and less water loss under salt and drought stress compared to WT. Promoter/gene expression studies revealed that OsWNK9 were expressed throughout plant tissues with higher expression in roots. Subcellular localization studies of OsWNK9 showed their presence in the nucleus. The transcript analysis of abiotic stress marker genes and ABA dependent genes showed they were highly expressed in transgenic lines compared to WT in response to salt and drought stress. The endogenous ABA level under salt and drought stress in transgenic lines was higher than WT. The results indicated that OsWNK9 may regulate salt and drought response in ABA dependent manner.
NA	Overexpression of rice OsWNK9 promotes arsenite tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants 	2021	J Biotechnol	Nuclear Agriculture and Biotechnology Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, 400084, India; Department of Biological Sciences, Birla Institute of Technology & Science Pilani, K.

Protein kinases are involved in the transfer of phosphate group to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues of a target protein. With No Lysine (WNK) kinase is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family, which has conserved catalytic lysine (K) residue in subdomain I instead of being in subdomain II.The WNKs family members in plants are stress inducible and have been validated for their role in abiotic stress tolerance. In the present study, we have characterized Arabidopsis overexpressed lines of OsWNK9 regulated by the constitutive promoter under arsenite stress. Moreover, we have performed In silico expression analysis of OsWNK9 under nutrient deficiency and heavy metal stress. Three independent transgenic Arabidopsis (OsWNK9-OX T11, T12,andT13) lines showed tolerance to arsenite stress compared to wild-type (WT) plants. Under arsenite stress, transgenic lines T11, T12 and T13 showed 56.46, 57.8 and 51.66 % increased biomass respectively, as compared to WT plants. All three ArabidopsisOsWNK9-OX lines exhibited higher proline content, increased antioxidant enzyme activities and lower hydrogen peroxide levels under arsenite stress. Besides, the total antioxidant capacity in terms of DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging percentage was increased by 8-15 % in three independent OsWNK9-OX lines compared with those of WT plants. Protein-protein interaction analysis of OsWNK9 predicted interaction partners with protein kinase and oxidative stress-responsive protein. Co-expression analysis of OsWNK9 in phosphate deficiency and arsenate stress condition predicted various proteins including membrane transporter and transcription factors. Taken together, our results, for the first time, provide evidence that OsWNK9 could positively mediate arsenite stress tolerance in plants.
