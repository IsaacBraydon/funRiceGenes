OsWRKY4	TLP|PR5	Rice WRKY4 acts as a transcriptional activator mediating defense responses toward Rhizoctonia solani, the causing agent of rice sheath blight.	Modulation of OsWRKY4 transcript levels by constitutive overexpression increases resistance to the necrotrophic sheath blight fungus, concomitant with elevated expression of JA- and ET-responsive pathogenesis-related (PR) genes such as PR1a, PR1b, PR5 and PR10/PBZ1
OsWRKY4	TLP|PR5	Rice WRKY4 acts as a transcriptional activator mediating defense responses toward Rhizoctonia solani, the causing agent of rice sheath blight.	Yeast one-hybrid assay and transient expression in tobacco cells reveal that OsWRKY4 specifically binds to the promoter regions of PR1b and PR5 which contain W-box (TTGAC[C/T]), or W-box like (TGAC[C/T]) cis-elements
OsPR1b	OsWRKY4	Rice WRKY4 acts as a transcriptional activator mediating defense responses toward Rhizoctonia solani, the causing agent of rice sheath blight	Yeast one-hybrid assay and transient expression in tobacco cells reveal that OsWRKY4 specifically binds to the promoter regions of PR1b and PR5 which contain W-box (TTGAC[C/T]), or W-box like (TGAC[C/T]) cis-elements.
OsWRKY4	OsWRKY80	OsWRKY80-OsWRKY4 Module as a Positive Regulatory Circuit in Rice Resistance Against Rhizoctonia solani.	Results of yeast one-hybrid assay and transient expression assay in tobacco cells have revealed that OsWRKY80 specifically binds to the promoter regions of OsWRKY4, which contain W-box (TTGAC[C/T]) or W-box like (TGAC[C/T]) cis-elements
OsWRKY4	OsWRKY80	OsWRKY80-OsWRKY4 Module as a Positive Regulatory Circuit in Rice Resistance Against Rhizoctonia solani.	We propose that OsWRKY80 functions upstream of OsWRKY4 as an important positive regulatory circuit that is implicated in rice defense response to sheath blight pathogen R
OsWRKY4	OsWRKY80	OsWRKY80-OsWRKY4 Module as a Positive Regulatory Circuit in Rice Resistance Against Rhizoctonia solani	Results of yeast one-hybrid assay and transient expression assay in tobacco cells have revealed that OsWRKY80 specifically binds to the promoter regions of OsWRKY4, which contain W-box (TTGAC[C/T]) or W-box like (TGAC[C/T]) cis-elements
OsWRKY4	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	ERECT LEAF1 suppresses jasmonic acid response in rice by decreasing OsWRKY4 stability.	 Here, by conducting yeast two-hybrid assay and in vitro ubiquitination experiments, we demonstrate that ELF1 interacts with the OsWRKY4 transcription factor, a positive regulator of defense responses to rice sheath blight
OsWRKY4	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	ERECT LEAF1 suppresses jasmonic acid response in rice by decreasing OsWRKY4 stability.	 ELF1 decreased the stability of OsWRKY4, whereas exogenous jasmonic acid treatment suppressed this effect of ELF1, resulting in OsWRKY4 accumulation in rice plants
OsWRKY4	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	ERECT LEAF1 suppresses jasmonic acid response in rice by decreasing OsWRKY4 stability.	 These results suggest that ELF1 indirectly controls the expression of PR1b and PR5 genes by regulating the OsWRKY4 protein level, and support a hypothesis that brassinosteroid and jasmonic acid cooperate to maintain the balance between growth and defense responses
OsWRKY4	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	ERECT LEAF1 suppresses jasmonic acid response in rice by decreasing OsWRKY4 stability.	 We conclude that ELF1 participates in the antagonistic interaction between these two phytohormones by suppressing the jasmonic acid response through the down-regulation of OsWRKY4 protein level in rice
