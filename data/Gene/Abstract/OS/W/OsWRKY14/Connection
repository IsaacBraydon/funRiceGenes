OsWRKY14|OsWRKY33	spl5|SF3b3	Transcriptome profiling of the spl5 mutant reveals that SPL5 has a negative role in the biosynthesis of serotonin for rice disease resistance.	 Interestingly, according to our microarray and real-time PCR assays, the expressions of a transcription factor OsWRKY14 and genes responsible for the biosynthesis of serotonin, anthranilate synthase (AS), indole-3-glycerolphosphate synthase (IGPS), tryptophan synthase (TS) and tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) were significantly up-regulated in the spl5 mutant
