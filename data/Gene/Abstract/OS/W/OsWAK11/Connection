D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	OsWAK11	The receptor kinase OsWAK11 monitors cell wall pectin changes to fine-tune brassinosteroid signaling and regulate cell elongation in rice.	 OsWAK11 directly binds and phosphorylates the BR receptor OsBRI1 at residue Thr752, within a motif conserved across most monocot graminaceous crops, thus hindering OsBRI1 interaction with its co-receptor OsSERK1/OsBAK1 and inhibiting BR signaling
