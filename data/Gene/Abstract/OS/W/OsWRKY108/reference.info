NA	OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Plant Phosphate Transporter 1 (PHT1) proteins, probably the only influx transporters for phosphate (Pi) uptake, are partially degraded on sufficient Pi levels to prevent excessive Pi accumulation. Therefore, the basal/constitutive expression level of PHT1 genes is vital for maintaining Pi uptake under Pi-replete conditions. Rice (Oryza sativa) OsPHT1;1 is a unique gene as it is highly expressed and not responsive to Pi, however the mechanism for maintaining its basal/constitutive expression remains unknown. Using biochemical and genetic approaches, we identified and functionally characterised the transcription factors maintaining the basal/constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1. OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 interact within the nucleus and both bind to the W-box in the OsPHT1;1 promoter. Overexpression of OsWRKY21 or OsWRKY108 led to increased Pi accumulation, resulting from elevated expression of OsPHT1;1. By contrast, oswrky21 oswrky108 double mutants showed decreased Pi accumulation and OsPHT1;1 expression in a Pi-dependent manner. Moreover, similar to ospht1;1 mutants, plants expressing the OsWRKY21-SRDX fusion protein (a chimeric dominant suppressor) were impaired in Pi accumulation in Pi-replete roots, accompanied by downregulation of OsPHT1;1 expression. Our findings demonstrated that rice WRKY transcription factors function redundantly to promote Pi uptake by activating OsPHT1;1 expression under Pi-replete conditions, and represent a novel pathway independent of the central Pi signalling system.
NA	OsWRKY108 is an integrative regulator of phosphorus homeostasis and leaf inclination in rice.	2021	Plant Signal Behav	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Phosphorus (P), which is taken up by plants as inorganic phosphate (Pi), is one of the most important macronutrients for plant growth and development. Meanwhile, it determines plant architecture in several ways, including leaf inclination. However, the molecular basis underlying the crosstalk between the signaling pathways of plant P homeostasis and architecture maintenance remains elusive. We recently characterized a WRKY transcription factor, OsWRKY108, in rice (Oryza sativa). It functions redundantly with OsWRKY21 to promote Pi uptake in response to Pi supply. Overexpression of either OsWRKY108 or OsWRKY21 led to up-regulation of Pi transporter genes and thus enhanced Pi accumulation. By contrast, transgenic rice plants expressing OsWRKY21-SRDX (a fusion protein transforming OsWRKY21 from an activator into a dominant repressor) but not the OsWRKY108-SRDX fusion showed decreased Pi accumulation under Pi-replete conditions. Here, we report that OsWRKY108 acts as a positive regulator of leaf inclination. OsWRKY108 overexpressors showed increased leaf inclination and OsWRKY108-SRDX plants showed an erect-leaf phenotype, irrespective of the Pi regimes. Nevertheless, the response of leaf inclination to Pi starvation was largely impaired upon OsWRKY108 overexpression. Moreover, in both OsWRKY108-SRDX plants and OsWRKY108 overexpressors, the &#39;percentage of leaf angle alteration relative to wild-type&#39; under Pi-starvation condition was more significant than that under Pi-replete condition. These results suggest that the regulation of OsWRKY108 on leaf inclination is in part dependent on Pi availability. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that OsWRKY108 is an integrative regulator of P homeostasis and leaf inclination, serving as a link between plant nutrient signaling and developmental cues.
