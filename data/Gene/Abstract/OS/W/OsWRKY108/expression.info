OsWRKY108	OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions |  Overexpression of OsWRKY21 or OsWRKY108 led to increased Pi accumulation, resulting from elevated expression of OsPHT1;1 |  By contrast, oswrky21 oswrky108 double mutants showed decreased Pi accumulation and OsPHT1;1 expression in a Pi-dependent manner	 Overexpression of OsWRKY21 or OsWRKY108 led to increased Pi accumulation, resulting from elevated expression of OsPHT1;1
OsWRKY108	 Overexpression of either OsWRKY108 or OsWRKY21 led to up-regulation of Pi transporter genes and thus enhanced Pi accumulation |  Nevertheless, the response of leaf inclination to Pi starvation was largely impaired upon OsWRKY108 overexpression	 Overexpression of either OsWRKY108 or OsWRKY21 led to up-regulation of Pi transporter genes and thus enhanced Pi accumulation |  Nevertheless, the response of leaf inclination to Pi starvation was largely impaired upon OsWRKY108 overexpression
