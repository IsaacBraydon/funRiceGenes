OsWRKY108	OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions |  Overexpression of OsWRKY21 or OsWRKY108 led to increased Pi accumulation, resulting from elevated expression of OsPHT1;1 |  By contrast, oswrky21 oswrky108 double mutants showed decreased Pi accumulation and OsPHT1;1 expression in a Pi-dependent manner	 Overexpression of OsWRKY21 or OsWRKY108 led to increased Pi accumulation, resulting from elevated expression of OsPHT1;1
