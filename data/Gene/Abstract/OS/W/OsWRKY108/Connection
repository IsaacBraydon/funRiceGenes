OsPht1;1|OsPT1	OsWRKY108	OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions	OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions
OsPht1;1|OsPT1	OsWRKY108	OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions	 OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 interact within the nucleus and both bind to the W-box in the OsPHT1;1 promoter
OsPht1;1|OsPT1	OsWRKY108	OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions	 Overexpression of OsWRKY21 or OsWRKY108 led to increased Pi accumulation, resulting from elevated expression of OsPHT1;1
OsPht1;1|OsPT1	OsWRKY108	OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions	 By contrast, oswrky21 oswrky108 double mutants showed decreased Pi accumulation and OsPHT1;1 expression in a Pi-dependent manner
OsWRKY108	OsWRKY21	OsWRKY108 is an integrative regulator of phosphorus homeostasis and leaf inclination in rice.	 Overexpression of either OsWRKY108 or OsWRKY21 led to up-regulation of Pi transporter genes and thus enhanced Pi accumulation
