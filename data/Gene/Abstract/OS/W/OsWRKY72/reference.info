WRKY transcription factors play a central role in transcriptional reprogramming associated with plant immune responses. However, due to functional redundancy, typically the contribution of individual members of this family to immunity is only subtle. Using microarray analysis, we found that the paralogous tomato WRKY genes SlWRKY72a and b are transcriptionally up-regulated during disease resistance mediated by the R gene Mi-1. Virus-induced gene silencing of these two genes in tomato resulted in a clear reduction of Mi-1-mediated resistance as well as basal defense against root-knot nematodes (RKN) and potato aphids. Using Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutants, we found that their Arabidopsis ortholog, AtWRKY72, is also required for full basal defense against RKN as well as to the oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. Despite their similar roles in basal defense against RKN in both tested plant species, WRKY72-type transcription factors in tomato, but not in Arabidopsis, clearly contributed to basal defense against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Of the five R genes that we tested in tomato and Arabidopsis, only Mi-1 appeared to be dependent on WRKY72-type transcription factors. Interestingly, AtWRKY72 target genes, identified by microarray analysis of H. arabidopsidis-triggered transcriptional changes, appear to be largely non-responsive to analogs of the defense hormone salicylic acid (SA). Thus, similarly to Mi-1, which in part acts independently of SA, AtWRKY72 appears to utilize SA-independent defense mechanisms. We propose that WRKY72-type transcription factors play a partially conserved role in basal defense in tomato and Arabidopsis, a function that has been recruited to serve Mi-1-dependent immunity.
j.1744-7909.2007.00504.x.pdf	The WRKY Gene Family in Rice (Oryza sativa)	2007	J Integr Plant Biol	Bioinformatics Core, School of Life Sciences, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada 89154, USA	WRKY genes encode transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of various biological processes. These zinc-finger proteins, especially those members mediating stress responses, are uniquely expanded in plants. To facilitate the study of the evolutionary history and functions of this supergene family, we performed an exhaustive search for WRKY genes using HMMER and a Hidden Markov Model that was specifically trained for rice. This work resulted in a comprehensive list of WRKY gene models in Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and L. ssp. japonica. Mapping of these genes to individual chromosomes facilitated elimination of the redundant, leading to the identification of 98 WRKY genes in japonica and 102 in indica rice. These genes were further categorized according to the number and structure of their zinc-finger domains. Based on a phylogenetic tree of the conserved WRKY domains and the graphic display of WRKY loci on corresponding indica and japonica chromosomes, we identified possible WRKY gene duplications within, and losses between the two closely related rice subspecies. Also reviewed are the roles of WRKY genes in disease resistance and responses to salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, seed development and germination mediated by gibberellins, other developmental processes including senescence, and responses to abiotic stresses and abscisic acid in rice and other plants. The signaling pathways mediating WRKY gene expression are also discussed.
pce12078.pdf	Knockdown of GDCH gene reveals reactive oxygen species-induced leaf senescence in rice	2013	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.	Glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC) is a multi-protein complex, comprising P-, H-, T- and L-protein subunits, which plays a major role in photorespiration in plants. While structural analysis has demonstrated that the H subunit of GDC (GDCH) plays a pivotal role in GDC, research on the role of GDCH in biological processes in plants is seldom reported. Here, the function of GDCH, stresses resulting from GDCH-knockdown and the interactions of these stresses with other cellular processes were studied in rice plants. Under high CO(2), the OsGDCH RNA interference (OsGDCH-RNAi) plants grew normally, but under ambient CO(2), severely suppressed OsGDCH-RNAi plants (SSPs) were non-viable, which displayed a photorespiration-deficient phenotype. Under ambient CO(2), chlorophyll loss, protein degradation, lipid peroxidation and photosynthesis decline occurred in SSPs. Electron microscopy studies showed that chloroplast breakdown and autophagy took place in these plants. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), including O2(-) and H(2)O(2), accumulated and the antioxidant enzyme activities decreased in the leaves of SSPs under ambient CO(2). The expression of transcription factors and senescence-associated genes (SAGs), which was up-regulated in SSPs after transfer to ambient CO(2), was enhanced in wild-type plants treated with H(2)O(2). Evidences demonstrate ROS induce senescence in SSPs, and transcription factors OsWRKY72 may mediate the ROS-induced senescence.

The WRKY proteins are a superfamily of regulators that control diverse developmental and physiological processes. This family was believed to be plant specific until the recent identification of WRKY genes in nonphotosynthetic eukaryotes. We have undertaken a comprehensive computational analysis of the rice (Oryza sativa) genomic sequences and predicted the structures of 81 OsWRKY genes, 48 of which are supported by full-length cDNA sequences. Eleven OsWRKY proteins contain two conserved WRKY domains, while the rest have only one. Phylogenetic analyses of the WRKY domain sequences provide support for the hypothesis that gene duplication of single- and two-domain WRKY genes, and loss of the WRKY domain, occurred in the evolutionary history of this gene family in rice. The phylogeny deduced from the WRKY domain peptide sequences is further supported by the position and phase of the intron in the regions encoding the WRKY domains. Analyses for chromosomal distributions reveal that 26% of the predicted OsWRKY genes are located on chromosome 1. Among the dozen genes tested, OsWRKY24, -51, -71, and -72 are induced by abscisic acid (ABA) in aleurone cells. Using a transient expression system, we have demonstrated that OsWRKY24 and -45 repress ABA induction of the HVA22 promoter-beta-glucuronidase construct, while OsWRKY72 and -77 synergistically interact with ABA to activate this reporter construct. This study provides a solid base for functional genomics studies of this important superfamily of regulatory genes in monocotyledonous plants and reveals a novel function for WRKY genes, i.e. mediating plant responses to ABA.

Through activating specific transcriptional programmes, plants can launch resistance mechanisms to stressful environments and acquire a new equilibrium between development and defence. To screen the rice WRKY transcription factor which functions in abiotic stress tolerance and modulates the abscisic acid (ABA) response, we generated a whole array of 35S-OsWRKY transgenic Arabidopsis. In this study, we report that 35S-OsWRKY72 transgenic Arabidopsis, whose seed germination was retarded under normal conditions, emerged more sensitive to mannitol, NaCl, ABA stresses and sugar starvation than vector plants. Meanwhile, 35S-OsWRKY72 transgenic Arabidopsis displayed early flowering, reduced apical dominance, lost high temperature-induced hypocotyl elongation response, and enhanced gravitropism response, which were similar to the auxin-related gene mutants aux1, axr1 and bud1. Further, semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that the expression patterns of three auxin-related genes AUX1, AXR1 and BUD1 were significantly altered in rosette leaves and infl orescences of 35S-OsWRKY72 plants compared with control Arabidopsis, and two ABA-related genes ABA2 and ABI4 were induced in 35S-OsWRKY72 seedlings. In addition, northern blot analysis indicated that, in rice, OsWRKY72 was inducible by polyethylene glycol (PEG), NaCl, naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), ABA and 42 degrees C, similar to its orthologue AtWRKY75 in Arabidopsis, implying that these two WRKY genes might be required for multiple physiological processes in their plants. Together, these results suggest that OsWRKY72 interferes in the signal cross-talk between the ABA signal and auxin transport pathway in transgenic Arabidopsis.
NA	The CC-NB-LRR OsRLR1 mediates rice disease resistance through interaction with OsWRKY19	2020	Plant Biotechnol J	Rice Research Institute, Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, China.	Nucleotide-binding site, leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) resistance proteins are critical for plant resistance to pathogens; however, their mechanism of activation and signal transduction are still not well understood. We identified a mutation in an as yet uncharacterized rice coiled-coil (CC)-NB-LRR, Oryza sativa RPM1-like resistance gene 1 (OsRLR1), which leads to hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesions on the leaf blade and broad range resistance to the fungal pathogen Pyricularia oryzae (syn. Magnaporthe oryzae) and the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, together with strong growth reduction. Consistently, OsRLR1-overexpression lines showed enhanced resistance to both pathogens. Moreover, we found that OsRLR1 mediates the defence response through direct interaction in the nucleus with the transcription factor OsWRKY19. Down-regulation of OsWRKY19 in the rlr1 mutant compromised the HR-like phenotype and resistance response, and largely restored plant growth. OsWRKY19 binds to the promoter of OsPR10 to activate the defence response. Taken together, our data highlight the role of a new residue involved in the NB-LRR activation mechanism, allowing identification of a new NB-LRR downstream signalling pathway.
