1-s2.0-S0167478107000747-main.pdf	Involvement of the elicitor-induced gene OsWRKY53 in the expression of defense-related genes in rice	2007	Biochim Biophys Acta	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	We present a detailed characterization of the chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-induced gene OsWRKY53. OsWRKY53 was also induced in suspension-cultured rice cells by a fungal cerebroside elicitor and in rice plants by infection with the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea. A fusion of OsWRKY53 with green fluorescent protein was detected exclusively in the nuclei of onion epidermal cells, and OsWRKY53 protein specifically bound to W-box elements. A transient assay using the particle bombardment method showed that OsWRKY53 is a transcriptional activator. A microarray analysis revealed that several defense-related genes, including pathogenesis-related protein genes such as PBZ1, were upregulated in rice cells overexpressing OsWRKY53. Finally, overexpression of OsWRKY53 in rice plants resulted in enhanced resistance to M. grisea. These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY53 is a transcription factor that plays important roles in elicitor-induced defense signaling pathways in rice.
73_1901.pdf	Promoter Analysis of the Elicitor-Induced WRKY GeneOsWRKY53, Which Is Involved in Defense Responses in Rice	2014	Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, Japan.	OsWRKY53, a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-responsive rice WRKY gene, has been found to be involved in defense responses in rice. We identified three tandem W-box elements, putative recognition sites for WRKY transcription factors, as cis elements that are essential to the elicitor-responsiveness of OsWRKY53 by deletion and mutation analysis of the promoter by dual luciferase assay.
j.1744-7909.2007.00504.x.pdf	The WRKY Gene Family in Rice (Oryza sativa)	2007	J Integr Plant Biol	Bioinformatics Core, School of Life Sciences, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada 89154, USA	WRKY genes encode transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of various biological processes. These zinc-finger proteins, especially those members mediating stress responses, are uniquely expanded in plants. To facilitate the study of the evolutionary history and functions of this supergene family, we performed an exhaustive search for WRKY genes using HMMER and a Hidden Markov Model that was specifically trained for rice. This work resulted in a comprehensive list of WRKY gene models in Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and L. ssp. japonica. Mapping of these genes to individual chromosomes facilitated elimination of the redundant, leading to the identification of 98 WRKY genes in japonica and 102 in indica rice. These genes were further categorized according to the number and structure of their zinc-finger domains. Based on a phylogenetic tree of the conserved WRKY domains and the graphic display of WRKY loci on corresponding indica and japonica chromosomes, we identified possible WRKY gene duplications within, and losses between the two closely related rice subspecies. Also reviewed are the roles of WRKY genes in disease resistance and responses to salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, seed development and germination mediated by gibberellins, other developmental processes including senescence, and responses to abiotic stresses and abscisic acid in rice and other plants. The signaling pathways mediating WRKY gene expression are also discussed.
NA	Involvement of the OsMKK4-OsMPK1 Cascade and its Downstream Transcription Factor OsWRKY53 in the Wounding Response in Rice	2014	Plant Pathol J	Department of Plant Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 500-757, Korea.	Plant has possessed diverse stress signals from outside and maintained its fitness. Out of such plant responses, it is well known that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade plays important role in wounding and pathogen attack in most dicot plants. However, little is understood about its role in wounding response for the economically important monocot rice plant. In this study, therefore, the involvement of MAPK was investigated to understand the wounding signaling pathway in rice. The OsMPK1 was rapidly activated by wounding within 10 min, and OsMPK1 was also activated by challenge of rice blast fungus. Further analysis revealed that OsMKK4, the upstream kinase of OsMPK1, phosphorylated OsMPK1 by wounding in vivo. Furthermore, OsMPK1 directly interacted with a rice defense-related transcription factor OsWRKY53. To understand a functional link between MAPK and its target transcription factor, we showed that OsMPK1 activated by the constitutively active mutant OsMKK4(DD) phosphorylated OsWRKY53 in vitro. Taken together, components involving in the wounding signaling pathway, OsMKK4-OsMPK1-OsWRKY53, can be important players in regulating crosstalk between abiotic stress and biotic stress.
NA	The rice transcription factor WRKY53 suppresses herbivore-induced defenses by acting as a negative feedback modulator of map kinase activity.	2015	Plant Physiol	Zhejiang University CITY: Hangzhou China [CN].	The mechanisms by which herbivore-attacked plants activate their defenses are well studied. By contrast, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms that allow them to control their defensive investment and avoid a defensive overshoot. We characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) WRKY gene, OsWRKY53, whose expression is rapidly induced upon wounding and induced in a delayed fashion upon attack by the striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis. The transcript levels of OsWRKY53 are independent of endogenous jasmonic acid (JA), but positively regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs), OsMPK3/OsMPK6. OsWRKY53 physically interacts with OsMPK3/OsMPK6 and suppresses their activity in vitro. By consequence, it modulates the expression of defensive, MPK-regulated WRKYs and thereby reduces JA, jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) and ethylene induction. This phytohormonal reconfiguration is associated with a reduction in trypsin protease inhibitor activity and improved SBB performance. OsWRKY53 is also shown to be a negative regulator of plant growth. Taken together, these results show that OsWRKY53 functions as a negative feedback modulator of MPK3/MPK6 and thereby acts as an early suppressor of induced defenses. OsWRKY53 therefore enables rice plants to control the magnitude of their defensive investment during early signaling.
NA	OsWRKY53, a versatile switch in regulating herbivore-induced defense responses in rice.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	a State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Institute of Insect Science, Zhejiang University , Hangzhou 310058 , China.	WRKY proteins, which belong to a large family of plant-specific transcription factors, play important roles in plant defenses against pathogens and herbivores by regulating defense-related signaling pathways. Recently, a rice WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY53 has been reported to function as a negative feedback modulator of OsMPK3/OsMPK6 and thereby to control the size of the investment a rice plant makes to defend against a chewing herbivore, the striped stem borer Chilo suppressalis. We investigated the performance of a piecing-sucking herbivore, the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, on transgenic plants that silence or overexpress OsWRKY53, and found that OsWRKY53 activates rice defenses against BPH by activating an H2O2 burst and suppressing ethylene biosynthesis. These findings suggest that OsWRKY53 functions not only as a regulator of plants' investment in specific defenses, but also as a switch to initiate new defenses against other stresses, highlighting the versatility and importance of OsWRKY53 in herbivore-induced plant defenses.
NA	Transcription factor OsWRKY53 positively regulates brassinosteroid signaling and plant architecture.	2017	Plant Physiol	Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences CITY: Harbin STATE: Heilongjiang China [CN].	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of steroid hormones regulating multiple aspects of plant growth, development, and adaptation. Compared with extensive studies in Arabidopsis, the mechanism of BR signaling in rice is less understood. Here, we identified OsWRKY53, a transcription factor involved in defense responses, as an important regulator of rice BR signaling. Phenotypic analyses showed that OsWRKY53 overexpression led to enlarged leaf angles and increased grain size, in contrast to the erect leaves and smaller seeds in oswrky53 mutant. In addition, the oswrky53 exhibited decreased BR sensitivity, whereas OsWRKY53 overexpression plants were hypersensitive to BR, suggesting that OsWRKY53 positively regulates rice BR signaling. Moreover, we show that OsWRKY53 can interact with and be phosphorylated by OsMAPKK4-OsMAPK6 cascade, and the phosphorylation is required for the biological function of OsWRKY53 in regulating BR responses. Furthermore, we found that BR promotes OsWRKY53 protein accumulation but represses OsWRKY53 transcript level. Taken together, this study revealed the novel role of OsWRKY53 as a regulator of rice BR signaling, and also suggested a potential role of OsWRKY53 in mediating the crosstalk between the hormone and other signaling pathways.
NA	Knock out of transcription factor WRKY53 thickens sclerenchyma cell walls, confers bacterial blight resistance	2021	Plant Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Plant cell walls are the first physical barrier against pathogen invasion, and plants thicken the cell wall to strengthen it and restrain pathogen infection. Bacterial blight is a devastating rice (Oryza sativa) disease caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which typically enters the rice leaf through hydathodes and spreads throughout the plant via the xylem. Xoo interacts with cells surrounding the xylem vessel of a vascular bundle, but whether rice strengthens the sclerenchyma cell walls to stop pathogen proliferation is unclear. Here, we found that a WRKY protein, OsWRKY53, negatively confers resistance to Xoo by strengthening the sclerenchyma cell walls of the vascular bundle. OsMYB63 acts as a transcriptional activator and promotes the expression of three secondary cell wall-related cellulose synthase genes to boost cellulose accumulation, resulting in thickened sclerenchyma cell walls. Both OsWRKY53 and OsMYB63 are abundantly expressed in sclerenchyma cells of leaf vascular bundles. OsWRKY53 functions as a transcriptional repressor and acts genetically upstream of OsMYB63 to suppress its expression. The OsWRKY53-overexpressing and OsMYB63 knockout plants had thinner sclerenchyma cell walls, showing susceptibility to Xoo, while the OsWRKY53 knockout and OsMYB63-overexpressing plants had thicker sclerenchyma cell walls, exhibiting resistance to Xoo. These results suggest that modifying these candidate genes provides a strategy to improve rice resistance to bacterial pathogens.
NA	Silencing a Simple Extracellular Leucine-Rich Repeat Gene OsI-BAK1 Enhances the Resistance of Rice to Brown Planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.	2021	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology &amp; Ministry of Agriculture Key Lab of Agricultural Entomology, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Many plant proteins with extracellular leucine-rich repeat (eLRR) domains play an important role in plant immunity. However, the role of one class of eLRR plant proteins-the simple eLRR proteins-in plant defenses against herbivores remains largely unknown. Here, we found that a simple eLRR protein OsI-BAK1 in rice localizes to the plasma membrane. Its expression was induced by mechanical wounding, the infestation of gravid females of brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens or white-backed planthopper Sogatella furcifera and treatment with methyl jasmonate or abscisic acid. Silencing OsI-BAK1 (ir-ibak1) in rice enhanced the BPH-induced transcript levels of three defense-related WRKY genes (OsWRKY24, OsWRKY53 and OsWRKY70) but decreased the induced levels of ethylene. Bioassays revealed that the hatching rate was significantly lower in BPH eggs laid on ir-ibak1 plants than wild-type (WT) plants; moreover, gravid BPH females preferred to oviposit on WT plants over ir-ibak1 plants. The exogenous application of ethephon on ir-ibak1 plants eliminated the BPH oviposition preference between WT and ir-ibak1 plants but had no effect on the hatching rate of BPH eggs. These findings suggest that OsI-BAK1 acts as a negative modulator of defense responses in rice to BPH and that BPH might exploit this modulator for its own benefit.
NA	OsWRKY53 Promotes Abscisic Acid Accumulation to Accelerate Leaf Senescence and Inhibit Seed Germination by Downregulating Abscisic Acid Catabolic Genes in Rice.	2022	Front Plant Sci	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	Abscisic acid (ABA) largely promotes leaf senescence and inhibits seed germination in plants. Endogenous ABA content is finely tuned by many transcription factors. In this study, we showed that OsWRKY53 is a positive regulator of leaf senescence and a negative regulator of seed germination in rice. OsWRKY53 expression was induced in leaves under aging, dark, and ABA treatment. The OsWRKY53-overexpressing (OsWRKY53-oe) plants showed early yellowing leaves, while the OsWRKY53 (oswrky53) knockout mutants maintained green leaves than the wild type under natural, dark-induced, and ABA-induced senescence conditions. Transcriptional analysis revealed that ABA catabolic genes, namely, OsABA8ox1 and OsABA8ox2, two key genes participating in ABA catabolism harboring ABA 8&#x27;-hydroxylase activity, were markedly downregulated in OsWRKY53-oe leaves. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and protoplast transient assays revealed that OsWRKY53 directly bound to the promoters of OsABA8ox1 and OsABA8ox2 to repress their transcription, resulting in elevated endogenous ABA contents that promoted premature leaf senescence in the OsWRKY53-oe plants. It indicates that OsWRKY53 is a positive regulator through regulating ABA accumulation to promote leaf senescence. In addition, accumulated ABA simultaneously inhibited seed germination and post-germination growth in OsWRKY53-oe plants. Taken together, OsWRKY53 suppresses the transcript of ABA catabolic genes to promote ABA accumulation to modulate ABA-induced leaf senescence and ABA-mediated inhibition of seed germination.
NA	Functions of OsWRKY24, OsWRKY70 and OsWRKY53 in regulating grain size in rice.	2022	Planta	Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Key Laboratory of Soybean Molecular Design Breeding, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Harbin, 150081, China.	OsWRKY24 functions redundantly with OsWRKY53, while OsWRKY70 functions differently from OsWRKY53 in regulating grain size. Grain size is a key agronomic trait that affects grain yield and quality in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The transcription factor OsWRKY53 positively regulates grain size through brassinosteroid (BR) signaling and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascades. However, whether the OsWRKY53 homologs OsWRKY24 and OsWRKY70 also contribute to grain size which remains unknown. Here, we report that grain size in OsWRKY24 overexpression lines and oswrky24 mutants is similar to that of the wild type. However, the oswrky24 oswrky53 double mutant produced smaller grains than the oswrky53 single mutant, indicating functional redundancy between OsWRKY24 and OsWRKY53. In addition, OsWRKY70 overexpression lines displayed an enlarged leaf angle, reduced plant height, longer grains, and higher BR sensitivity, phenotypes similar to those of OsWRKY53 overexpression lines. Importantly, a systematic characterization of seed length in the oswrky70 single, the oswrky53 oswrky70 double and the oswrky24 oswrky53 oswrky70 triple mutant indicated that loss of OsWRKY70 also leads to increased seed length, suggesting that OsWRKY70 might play a role distinct from that of OsWRKY53 in regulating grain size. Taken together, these findings suggest that OsWRKY24 and OsWRKY70 regulate rice grain size redundantly and independently from OsWRKY53.
NA	WRKY53 negatively regulates rice cold tolerance at the booting stage by fine-tuning anther gibberellin levels.	2022	Plant Cell	Key Laboratory of Soybean Molecular Design Breeding, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Harbin 150081, China.	Cold tolerance at the booting (CTB) stage is a major factor limiting rice (Oryza sativa L.) productivity and geographical distribution. A few cold-tolerance genes have been identified, but they either need to be overexpressed to result in CTB or cause yield penalties, limiting their utility for breeding. Here, we characterize the function of the cold-induced transcription factor WRKY53 in rice. The wrky53 mutant displays increased CTB, as determined by higher seed setting. Low temperature is associated with lower gibberellin (GA) contents in anthers in the wild type but not in the wrky53 mutant, which accumulates slightly more GA in its anthers. WRKY53 directly binds to the promoters of GA biosynthesis genes and transcriptionally represses them in anthers. In addition, we uncover a possible mechanism by which GA regulates male fertility: SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1) interacts with and sequesters two critical transcription factors for tapetum development, UNDEVELOPED TAPETUM1 (UDT1), and TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION (TDR), and GA alleviates the sequestration by SLR1, thus allowing UDT1 and TDR to activate transcription. Finally, knocking out WRKY53 in diverse varieties increases cold tolerance without a yield penalty, leading to a higher yield in rice subjected to cold stress. Together, these findings provide a target for improving CTB in rice.
NA	Genome-wide association studies identify OsWRKY53 as a key regulator of salt tolerance in rice.	2023	Nat Commun	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Centre for Modern Crop Production, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Salinity stress progressively reduces plant growth and productivity, while plant has developed complex signaling pathways to confront salt stress. However, only a few genetic variants have been identified to mediate salt tolerance in the major crop rice, and the molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we identify ten candidate genes associated with salt-tolerance (ST) traits by performing a genome-wide association analysis in rice landraces. We characterize two ST-related genes, encoding transcriptional factor OsWRKY53 and Mitogen-activated protein Kinase Kinase OsMKK10.2, that mediate root Na(+) flux and Na(+) homeostasis. We further find that OsWRKY53 acts as a negative modulator regulating expression of OsMKK10.2 in promoting ion homeostasis. Furthermore, OsWRKY53 trans-represses OsHKT1;5 (high-affinity K(+) transporter 1;5), encoding a sodium transport protein in roots. We show that the OsWRKY53-OsMKK10.2 and OsWRKY53-OsHKT1;5 module coordinate defenses against ionic stress. The results shed light on the regulatory mechanisms underlying plant salt tolerance.
