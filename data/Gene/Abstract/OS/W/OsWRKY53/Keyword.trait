OsWRKY53	blast	Involvement of the elicitor-induced gene OsWRKY53 in the expression of defense-related genes in rice	 OsWRKY53 was also induced in suspension-cultured rice cells by a fungal cerebroside elicitor and in rice plants by infection with the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea
OsWRKY53	defense	Involvement of the elicitor-induced gene OsWRKY53 in the expression of defense-related genes in rice	" A microarray analysis revealed that several defense-related genes, including pathogenesis-related protein genes such as PBZ1, were upregulated in rice cells overexpressing OsWRKY53| These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY53 is a transcription factor that plays important roles in elicitor-induced defense signaling pathways in rice|Involvement of the elicitor-induced gene OsWRKY53 in the expression of defense-related genes in rice"
