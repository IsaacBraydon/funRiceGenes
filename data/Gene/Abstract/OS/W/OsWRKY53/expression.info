OsWRKY53	 We characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) WRKY gene, OsWRKY53, whose expression is rapidly induced upon wounding and induced in a delayed fashion upon attack by the striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis
OsWRKY53	 OsWRKY53 functions as a transcriptional repressor and acts genetically upstream of OsMYB63 to suppress its expression
