Symbol	Expression
OsWRKY53	 We characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) WRKY gene, OsWRKY53, whose expression is rapidly induced upon wounding and induced in a delayed fashion upon attack by the striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis
OsWRKY53	 OsWRKY53 functions as a transcriptional repressor and acts genetically upstream of OsMYB63 to suppress its expression
OsWRKY53	 OsWRKY53 expression was induced in leaves under aging, dark, and ABA treatment
OsWRKY53	 We further find that OsWRKY53 acts as a negative modulator regulating expression of OsMKK10
