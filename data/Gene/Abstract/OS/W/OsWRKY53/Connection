OsMPK6|OsMPK4	OsWRKY53	The rice transcription factor WRKY53 suppresses herbivore-induced defenses by acting as a negative feedback modulator of map kinase activity	The transcript levels of OsWRKY53 are independent of endogenous jasmonic acid (JA), but positively regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs), OsMPK3/OsMPK6
OsMPK6|OsMPK4	OsWRKY53	The rice transcription factor WRKY53 suppresses herbivore-induced defenses by acting as a negative feedback modulator of map kinase activity	OsWRKY53 physically interacts with OsMPK3/OsMPK6 and suppresses their activity in vitro
