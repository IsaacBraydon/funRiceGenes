Lsi1|OsNIP2;1|OsLsi1	OsWRKY53	Overexpression of Lsi1 in cold-sensitive rice mediates transcriptional regulatory networks and enhances resistance to chilling stress	 Our results suggest that when overexpressed Lsi1 in cold-sensitive rice, it possibility regulates the transcription factor OsWRKY53 in addition to the genes involved in the ROS metabolism, thus mediating resistance to chilling stress
OsMKKK70	OsWRKY53	OsMKKK70 regulates grain size and leaf angle in rice through the OsMKK4-OsMAPK6-OsWRKY53 signaling pathway.	 Taken together, these findings suggest that OsMKKK70 might regulates grain size and leaf angle in rice by activating OsMAPK6 and that OsMKKK70, OsMKK4, OsMAPK6, and OsWRKY53 function in a common signaling pathway that controls grain shape and leaf angle

OsABA8ox1	OsWRKY53	OsWRKY53 Promotes Abscisic Acid Accumulation to Accelerate Leaf Senescence and Inhibit Seed Germination by Downregulating Abscisic Acid Catabolic Genes in Rice.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation and protoplast transient assays revealed that OsWRKY53 directly bound to the promoters of OsABA8ox1 and OsABA8ox2 to repress their transcription, resulting in elevated endogenous ABA contents that promoted premature leaf senescence in the OsWRKY53-oe plants
