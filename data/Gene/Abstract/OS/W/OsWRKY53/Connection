OsMPK6|OsMPK4	OsWRKY53	The rice transcription factor WRKY53 suppresses herbivore-induced defenses by acting as a negative feedback modulator of map kinase activity	The transcript levels of OsWRKY53 are independent of endogenous jasmonic acid (JA), but positively regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs), OsMPK3/OsMPK6
OsMPK6|OsMPK4	OsWRKY53	The rice transcription factor WRKY53 suppresses herbivore-induced defenses by acting as a negative feedback modulator of map kinase activity	OsWRKY53 physically interacts with OsMPK3/OsMPK6 and suppresses their activity in vitro
Lsi1|OsNIP2;1|OsLsi1	OsWRKY53	Overexpression of Lsi1 in cold-sensitive rice mediates transcriptional regulatory networks and enhances resistance to chilling stress	 Our results suggest that when overexpressed Lsi1 in cold-sensitive rice, it possibility regulates the transcription factor OsWRKY53 in addition to the genes involved in the ROS metabolism, thus mediating resistance to chilling stress
OsMKKK70	OsWRKY53	OsMKKK70 regulates grain size and leaf angle in rice through the OsMKK4-OsMAPK6-OsWRKY53 signaling pathway.	 Taken together, these findings suggest that OsMKKK70 might regulates grain size and leaf angle in rice by activating OsMAPK6 and that OsMKKK70, OsMKK4, OsMAPK6, and OsWRKY53 function in a common signaling pathway that controls grain shape and leaf angle
