NA	Double knockout of OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102 boosts lignification with altering culm morphology of rice 	2020	Plant Sci	Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere, Kyoto University, Uji, Kyoto, 611-0011, Japan.	Breeding to enrich lignin, a major component of lignocelluloses, in plants contributes to enhanced applications of lignocellulosic biomass into solid biofuels and valuable aromatic chemicals. To collect information on enhancing lignin deposition in grass species, important lignocellulose feedstocks, we generated rice (Oryza sativa) transgenic lines deficient in OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102, which encode putative transcriptional repressors for secondary cell wall formation. We used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis and closely characterized their altered cell walls using chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods. Both OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102 mutations significantly increased lignin content by up to 28 % and 32 %, respectively. Additionally, OsWRKY36/OsWRKY102-double-mutant lines displayed lignin enrichment of cell walls (by up to 41 %) with substantially altered culm morphology over the single-mutant lines as well as the wild-type controls. Our chemical and NMR analyses showed that relative abundances of guaiacyl and p-coumarate units were slightly higher and lower, respectively, in the WRKY mutant lignins compared with those in the wild-type lignins. Our results provide evidence that both OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102 are associated with repression of rice lignification. 
NA	Small grain and semi-dwarf 3, a WRKY transcription factor, negatively regulates plant height and grain size by stabilizing SLR1 expression in rice	2020	Plant Mol Biol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	OsWRKY36 represses plant height and grain size by inhibiting gibberellin signaling. Plant height and grain size are important agronomic traits affecting yield in cereals, including rice. Gibberellins (GAs) are plant hormones that promote plant growth and developmental processions such as stem elongation and grain size. WRKYs are transcription factors that regulate stress tolerance and plant development including height and grain size. However, the relationship between GA signaling and WRKY genes is still poorly understood. Here, we characterized a small grain and semi-dwarf 3 (sgsd3) mutant in rice cv. Hwayoung (WT). A T-DNA insertion in the 5'-UTR of OsWRKY36 induced overexpression of OsWRKY36 in the sgsd3 mutant, likely leading to the mutant phenotype. This was confirmed by the finding that overexpression of OsWRKY36 caused a similar small grain and semi-dwarf phenotype to the sgsd3 mutant whereas knock down and knock out caused larger grain phenotypes. The sgsd3 mutant was also hyposensitive to GA and accumulated higher mRNA and protein levels of SLR1 (a GA signaling DELLA-like inhibitor) compared with the WT. Further assays showed that OsWRKY36 enhanced SLR1 transcription by directly binding to its promoter. In addition, we found that OsWRKY36 can protect SLR1 from GA-mediated degradation. We thus identified a new GA signaling repressor OsWRKY36 that represses GA signaling through stabilizing the expression of SLR1.
