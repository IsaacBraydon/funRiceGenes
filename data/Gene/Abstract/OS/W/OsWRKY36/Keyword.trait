OsWRKY36|SGSD3	culm	Double knockout of OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102 boosts lignification with altering culm morphology of rice 	Double knockout of OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102 boosts lignification with altering culm morphology of rice 
OsWRKY36|SGSD3	cell wall	Double knockout of OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102 boosts lignification with altering culm morphology of rice 	 To collect information on enhancing lignin deposition in grass species, important lignocellulose feedstocks, we generated rice (Oryza sativa) transgenic lines deficient in OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102, which encode putative transcriptional repressors for secondary cell wall formation
OsWRKY36|SGSD3	lignin	Double knockout of OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102 boosts lignification with altering culm morphology of rice 	 To collect information on enhancing lignin deposition in grass species, important lignocellulose feedstocks, we generated rice (Oryza sativa) transgenic lines deficient in OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102, which encode putative transcriptional repressors for secondary cell wall formation
OsWRKY36|SGSD3	lignin	Double knockout of OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102 boosts lignification with altering culm morphology of rice 	 Both OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102 mutations significantly increased lignin content by up to 28 % and 32 %, respectively
