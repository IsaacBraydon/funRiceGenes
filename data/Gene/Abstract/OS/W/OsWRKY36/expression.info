OsWRKY36|SGSD3	 A T-DNA insertion in the 5'-UTR of OsWRKY36 induced overexpression of OsWRKY36 in the sgsd3 mutant, likely leading to the mutant phenotype |  This was confirmed by the finding that overexpression of OsWRKY36 caused a similar small grain and semi-dwarf phenotype to the sgsd3 mutant whereas knock down and knock out caused larger grain phenotypes	 A T-DNA insertion in the 5'-UTR of OsWRKY36 induced overexpression of OsWRKY36 in the sgsd3 mutant, likely leading to the mutant phenotype |  This was confirmed by the finding that overexpression of OsWRKY36 caused a similar small grain and semi-dwarf phenotype to the sgsd3 mutant whereas knock down and knock out caused larger grain phenotypes
