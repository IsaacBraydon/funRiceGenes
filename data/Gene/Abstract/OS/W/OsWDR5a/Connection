Ehd1	OsWDR5a|OsWDR5	The COMPASS-like complex promotes flowering and panicle branching in rice.	 OsWDR5a binds to Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) to regulate its H3K4me3 and expression levels
OsTrx1|SDG723	OsWDR5a|OsWDR5	The COMPASS-like complex promotes flowering and panicle branching in rice.	 Plants in which OsWDR5a or OsTrx1 expression was decreased by RNA interference produced fewer secondary branches and less grain, and exhibited a delayed heading date under long-day and short-day conditions, whereas loss of OsWDR5a function resulted in embryo lethality
LRK1	OsWDR5a|OsWDR5	Overexpressing lncRNA LAIR increases grain yield and regulates neighbouring gene cluster expression in rice.	 LAIR binds histone modification proteins OsMOF and OsWDR5 in rice cells, which are enriched in LRK1 gene region
