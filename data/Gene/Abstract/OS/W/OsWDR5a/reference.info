NA	The COMPASS-like complex promotes flowering and panicle branching in rice.	2018	Plant Physiol	University of Science &amp; Technology of China CITY: Hefei STATE: Anhui China [CN].	Flowering time (heading date) and panicle branch number are important agronomic traits that determine yield in rice (Oryza sativa). The activation of flowering requires histone methylation, but the roles of tri-methylation of lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me3) in modulating heading date and panicle development are unclear. Here, we showed that the COMPASS-like complex promotes flowering and panicle branching. The rice WD40 protein OsWDR5a interacts with the TRITHORAX-like protein OsTrx1/SDG723 to form the core components of the COMPASS-like complex. Plants in which OsWDR5a or OsTrx1 expression was decreased by RNA interference produced fewer secondary branches and less grain, and exhibited a delayed heading date under long-day and short-day conditions, whereas loss of OsWDR5a function resulted in embryo lethality. OsWDR5a binds to Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) to regulate its H3K4me3 and expression levels. Together, our results show that the COMPASS-like complex promotes flowering and panicle development, and suggest that modulation of H3K4me3 levels by the COMPASS-like complex is critical for rice development.
