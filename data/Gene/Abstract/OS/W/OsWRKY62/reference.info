WRKY transcription factors form a large family of plant-specific transcription factors and participate in plant defense responses either as positive or negative regulators. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the role of one of the group IIa WRKY transcription factors in rice, OsWRKY28, in the regulation of basal defense responses to a compatible race of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, strain Ina86-137. The expression analyses of the group IIa WRKY transcription factors in rice revealed that OsWRKY28, together with OsWRKY71, exhibit an early-induced expression prior to the late-induced expressions of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76. The GFP-OsWRKY28 fusion protein localized mainly in the nuclei of onion epidermal cells, and the maltose-binding protein-fused OsWRKY28 recombinant protein specifically bound to W-box elements. A transient reporter gene assay clearly showed that OsWRKY28 functions as a transcriptional repressor. Overexpression of OsWRKY28 in rice plants resulted in enhanced susceptibility to Ina86-137. Finally, transcriptome analysis revealed that the induction of several defense-related genes in the wild type after Ina86-137 infection was counteracted in OsWRKY28-overexpressing rice plants. These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY28 is a negative regulator of basal defense responses against Ina86-137 and acts as a modulator to maintain the responses at an appropriate level by attenuating the activation of defense-related gene expression levels.
j.1744-7909.2007.00504.x.pdf	The WRKY Gene Family in Rice (Oryza sativa)	2007	J Integr Plant Biol	Bioinformatics Core, School of Life Sciences, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada 89154, USA	WRKY genes encode transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of various biological processes. These zinc-finger proteins, especially those members mediating stress responses, are uniquely expanded in plants. To facilitate the study of the evolutionary history and functions of this supergene family, we performed an exhaustive search for WRKY genes using HMMER and a Hidden Markov Model that was specifically trained for rice. This work resulted in a comprehensive list of WRKY gene models in Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and L. ssp. japonica. Mapping of these genes to individual chromosomes facilitated elimination of the redundant, leading to the identification of 98 WRKY genes in japonica and 102 in indica rice. These genes were further categorized according to the number and structure of their zinc-finger domains. Based on a phylogenetic tree of the conserved WRKY domains and the graphic display of WRKY loci on corresponding indica and japonica chromosomes, we identified possible WRKY gene duplications within, and losses between the two closely related rice subspecies. Also reviewed are the roles of WRKY genes in disease resistance and responses to salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, seed development and germination mediated by gibberellins, other developmental processes including senescence, and responses to abiotic stresses and abscisic acid in rice and other plants. The signaling pathways mediating WRKY gene expression are also discussed.
Mol. Plant-2008-Peng-446-58.pdf	OsWRKY62 is a negative regulator of basal and Xa21-mediated defense against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in rice	2008	Mol Plant	Department of Plant Pathology, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.	The rice Xa21 gene, which confers resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), encodes a receptor-like kinase. Few components involved in transducing the Xa21-mediated defense response have yet been identified. Here, we report that XA21 binds to a WRKY transcription factor, called OsWRKY62. The OsWRKY62 gene encodes two splice variants (OsWRKY62.1 and OsWRKY62.2). OsWRKY62.1:smGFP2 and OsWRKY62.2:smGFP2 fusion proteins partially localize to the nucleus. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsWRKY62.1 are compromised in basal defense and Xa21-mediated resistance to Xoo. Furthermore, overexpression of OsWRKY62.1 suppresses the activation of defense-related genes. These results imply that OsWRKY62 functions as a negative regulator of innate immunity in rice, and serves as a critical mediator of both basal and race-specific defense responses.
ncomms1932.pdf	Cleavage and nuclear localization of the rice XA21 immune receptor	2012	Nat Commun	Department of Plant Pathology and the Genome Center, University of California Davis, Davis, California 95616, USA.	Plants and animals carry specific receptors that recognize invading pathogens and respond by activating an immune response. The rice XA21 receptor confers broad-spectrum immunity to the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae upon recognition of a small protein, Ax21, that is conserved in all Xanthomonas species and related genera. Here we demonstrate that XA21 is cleaved to release the intracellular kinase domain and that this intracellular domain carries a functional nuclear localization sequence. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays indicate that the XA21 intracellular domain interacts with the OsWRKY62 transcriptional regulator exclusively in the nucleus of rice protoplasts. In vivo cleavage of XA21 and translocalization of the intracellular kinase domain to the nucleus is required for the XA21-mediated immune response. These results suggest a new model for immune receptor function: on receptor recognition of conserved microbial signatures, the associated kinase translocates to the nucleus where it directly interacts with transcriptional regulators.
NA	Alternative splicing of rice WRKY62 and WRKY76 transcription factor genes in pathogen defense	2016	Plant Physiology	China Agricultural University CITY: Beijing China	The WRKY family of transcription factors (TFs) function as transcriptional activators or repressors in various signaling pathways. In this study we discovered that two IIa subfamily of WRKY genes, OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76, undergo constitutive and inducible alternative splicing. The full-length OsWRKY62.1 and OsWRKY76.1 proteins formed homo- and hetero-complexes, but the heterocomplex dominates in the nuclei when analyzed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Transgenic overexpression of OsWRKY62.1 and OsWRKY76.1 enhanced susceptibility to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae SZ and the rice leaf blight bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae J18, whereas RNAi and loss-of-function knockout plants exhibited elevated resistance. The dsOW62/76 and knockout lines of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 also showed greatly increased expressions of defense-related genes and accumulation of phytoalexins. Unlike other WRKY genes analyzed so far, we observed prominent alternative transcripts for OsWRKY62.1, OsWRKY76.1 and, most interestingly, the ratio of full-length vs. truncated transcripts changed in dsOW62/76 plants as well as in response to pathogen infection. The short OsWRKY62.2 and OsWRKY76.2 proteins could interact each other and with full-length proteins. OsWRKY62.2 showed a reduced repressor activity in planta and two sequence determinants required for the repressor activity were identified in the N-terminus of OsWRKY62.1. The N-termini of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 splice variants also showed reduced binding to the canonical W box motif. These results enhance our understanding of the DNA binding property, the repressor sequence motifs and the negative feedback regulation of the IIa subfamily of WRKYs and provide the first evidence for alternative splicing of WRKY TFs.
