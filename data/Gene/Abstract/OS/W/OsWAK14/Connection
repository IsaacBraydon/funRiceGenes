OsDEES1|OsWAK91	OsWAK14	Several wall-associated kinases participate positively and negatively in basal defense against rice blast fungus.	While OsWAK14, OsWAK91 and OsWAK92 positively regulate quantitative resistance, OsWAK112d is a negative regulator of blast resistance
OsWAK14	PIBP1	RRM Transcription Factors Interact with NLRs and Regulate Broad-Spectrum Blast Resistance in Rice.	 We find that PIBP1 and a homolog, Os06 g02240, bind DNA and function as unconventional transcription factors at the promoters of the defense genes OsWAK14 and OsPAL1, activating their expression
