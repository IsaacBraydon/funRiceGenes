HDA704	OsWR2	OsWR2 recruits HDA704 to regulate the deacetylation of H4K8ac in the promoter of OsABI5 in response to drought stress.	 Moreover, HDA704 was recruited by a drought-resistant transcription factor, WAX SYNTHESIS REGULATORY 2 (OsWR2), and co-regulated the expression of the ABA biosynthesis genes NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE 3 (NCED3), NCED4, and NCED5 under drought stress
