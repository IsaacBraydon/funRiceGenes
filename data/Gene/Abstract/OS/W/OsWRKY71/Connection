OsNPR1|NH1	OsWRKY71	OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response	These results suggest that OsWRKY71 might function as a transcriptional regulator upstream of OsNPR1 and OsPR1b in rice defense signaling pathways
OsPR1b	OsWRKY71	OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response	Furthermore, two marker genes in defense signaling pathway, OsNPR1 and OsPR1b, were constitutively expressed in OsWRKY71-overexpressing transgenic plants

OsWRKY51	OsWRKY71	Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells	To address the cross-talk of GA and ABA signaling, we studied two rice WRKY genes (OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY71) that are ABA-inducible and GA-repressible in embryos and aleurone cells
OsWRKY51	OsWRKY71	Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells	The physical interactions of OsWRKY71 proteins themselves and that of OsWRKY71 and OsWRKY51 are revealed in the nuclei of aleurone cells using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays
OsWRKY51	OsWRKY71	Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells	Although OsWRKY51 itself does not bind to the Amy32b promoter in vitro, it interacts with OsWRKY71 and enhances the binding affinity of OsWRKY71 to W boxes in the Amy32b promoter
OsWRKY51	OsWRKY71	Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells	In contrast, the third non-DNA-binding mutant enhances GA induction of Amy32b-GUS, by interfering with the binding of the wild-type OsWRKY71 or the OsWRKY71/OsWRKY51 repressing complex
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	OsWRKY71	A rice WRKY gene encodes a transcriptional repressor of the gibberellin signaling pathway in aleurone cells	Moreover, OsWRKY71 blocks the activation of the Amy32b promoter by the GA-inducible transcriptional activator OsGAMYB
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	OsWRKY71	A rice WRKY gene encodes a transcriptional repressor of the gibberellin signaling pathway in aleurone cells	Mutation of the two W boxes prevents the binding of OsWRKY71 to the mutated promoter, and releases the suppression of the OsGAMYB-activated Amy32b expression by OsWRKY71, suggesting that OsWRKY71 blocks GA signaling by functionally interfering with OsGAMYB
OsWRKY71	Z15	Zebra leaf 15, a receptor-like protein kinase involved in moderate low temperature signaling pathway in rice.	 The mutation of Z15 influenced the expression of two downstream genes, OsWRKY71 and OsMYB4, that were responsive to moderate low temperature
