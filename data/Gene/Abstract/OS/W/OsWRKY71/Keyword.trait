OsWRKY71	 ga 	Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells	 To address the cross-talk of GA and ABA signaling, we studied two rice WRKY genes (OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY71) that are ABA-inducible and GA-repressible in embryos and aleurone cells
OsWRKY71	 ga 	Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells	 However, two of these non-DNA-binding mutants are still able to repress GA induction by enhancing the binding affinity of the wild-type DNA-binding OsWRKY71 repressors
OsWRKY71	 ga 	Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells	 In contrast, the third non-DNA-binding mutant enhances GA induction of Amy32b-GUS, by interfering with the binding of the wild-type OsWRKY71 or the OsWRKY71/OsWRKY51 repressing complex
OsWRKY71	transcription factor	OsWRKY28, a PAMP-responsive transrepressor, negatively regulates innate immune responses in rice against rice blast fungus	 The expression analyses of the group IIa WRKY transcription factors in rice revealed that OsWRKY28, together with OsWRKY71, exhibit an early-induced expression prior to the late-induced expressions of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76
OsWRKY71	defense response	"OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response"	"OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response"
OsWRKY71	defense	"OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response"	" One of them, OsWRKY71, was up-regulated by several defense signaling molecules, such as SA, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), 1-aminocyclo-propane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), as well as wounding and pathogen infection, suggesting that OsWRKY71 might function in rice biotic stress response
OsWRKY71	defense	"OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response"	 Furthermore, two marker genes in defense signaling pathway, OsNPR1 and OsPR1b, were constitutively expressed in OsWRKY71-overexpressing transgenic plants
OsWRKY71	defense	"OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response"	 These results suggest that OsWRKY71 might function as a transcriptional regulator upstream of OsNPR1 and OsPR1b in rice defense signaling pathways
OsWRKY71	defense	"OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response"	OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response"
OsWRKY71	jasmonate	OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response	 One of them, OsWRKY71, was up-regulated by several defense signaling molecules, such as SA, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), 1-aminocyclo-propane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), as well as wounding and pathogen infection, suggesting that OsWRKY71 might function in rice biotic stress response
OsWRKY71	 ga 	A rice WRKY gene encodes a transcriptional repressor of the gibberellin signaling pathway in aleurone cells	 Mutation of the two W boxes prevents the binding of OsWRKY71 to the mutated promoter, and releases the suppression of the OsGAMYB-activated Amy32b expression by OsWRKY71, suggesting that OsWRKY71 blocks GA signaling by functionally interfering with OsGAMYB
OsWRKY71	 ga 	A rice WRKY gene encodes a transcriptional repressor of the gibberellin signaling pathway in aleurone cells	 Exogenous GA treatment decreases the steady-state mRNA level of OsWRKY71 and destabilizes the GFP:OsWRKY71 fusion protein
OsWRKY71	 ga 	A rice WRKY gene encodes a transcriptional repressor of the gibberellin signaling pathway in aleurone cells	 These findings suggest that OsWRKY71 encodes a transcriptional repressor of GA signaling in aleurone cells
OsWRKY71	 ga 	A negative regulator encoded by a rice WRKY gene represses both abscisic acid and gibberellins signaling in aleurone cells	 Third, unlike OsWRKY71, OsWRKY24 is stable upon GA treatment
OsWRKY71	 ABA 	Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells	 To address the cross-talk of GA and ABA signaling, we studied two rice WRKY genes (OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY71) that are ABA-inducible and GA-repressible in embryos and aleurone cells
OsWRKY71	transcription factor	OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response	OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response
OsWRKY71	defense	"Characterization of an Elicitor-Induced Rice WRKY Gene,OsWRKY71"	 Microarray analysis revealed that several elicitor-induced defense-related genes were upregulated in rice cells overexpressing OsWRKY71
OsWRKY71	defense	"Characterization of an Elicitor-Induced Rice WRKY Gene,OsWRKY71"	 These results indicate that the activation of defense-related genes by OsWRKY71 was probably indirect
OsWRKY71	biotic stress	"OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response"	" One of them, OsWRKY71, was up-regulated by several defense signaling molecules, such as SA, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), 1-aminocyclo-propane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), as well as wounding and pathogen infection, suggesting that OsWRKY71 might function in rice biotic stress response"
