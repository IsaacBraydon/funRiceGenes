OsWRKY71	 In addition, the expression of OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY71 was significantly upregulated in ipa1-NIL seeds |  Using transient dual-luciferase and yeast one-hybrid assays, IPA1 was found to directly activate the expression of OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY71, which would interfere with the binding affinity of GA-induced transcription factor OsGAMYB to inhibit the expression of ¦Á-amylase genes
