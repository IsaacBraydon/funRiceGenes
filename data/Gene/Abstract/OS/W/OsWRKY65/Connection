OsGRXS15	OsWRKY65	Rice glutaredoxin GRXS15 confers broad-spectrum resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Fusarium fujikuroi	The rice transcription factor OsWRKY65 was identified as a binding partner, and it directly interacted with OsGRXS15 in the nucleus.
OsGRXS15	OsWRKY65	Rice glutaredoxin GRXS15 confers broad-spectrum resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Fusarium fujikuroi	Moreover, we revealed that the interaction of OsGRXS15 and OsWRKY65 results in the upregulation of OsPR1.
