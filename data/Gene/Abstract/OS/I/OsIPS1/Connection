OsIPS1	OsMYB2P-1	OsMYB2P-1, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, is involved in the regulation of phosphate-starvation responses and root architecture in rice	 Overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 led to greater expression of Pi-responsive genes such as Oryza sativa UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase, OsIPS1, OsPAP10, OsmiR399a, and OsmiR399j
