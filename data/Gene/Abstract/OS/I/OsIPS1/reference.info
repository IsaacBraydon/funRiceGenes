169.pdf	OsMYB2P-1, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, is involved in the regulation of phosphate-starvation responses and root architecture in rice	2012	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, People's Republic of China.	An R2R3 MYB transcription factor, OsMYB2P-1, was identified from microarray data by monitoring the expression profile of rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) seedlings exposed to phosphate (Pi)-deficient medium. Expression of OsMYB2P-1 was induced by Pi starvation. OsMYB2P-1 was localized in the nuclei and exhibited transcriptional activation activity. Overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice enhanced tolerance to Pi starvation, while suppression of OsMYB2P-1 by RNA interference in rice rendered the transgenic rice more sensitive to Pi deficiency. Furthermore, primary roots of OsMYB2P-1-overexpressing plants were shorter than those in wild-type plants under Pi-sufficient conditions, while primary roots and adventitious roots of OsMYB2P-1-overexpressing plants were longer than those of wild-type plants under Pi-deficient conditions. These results suggest that OsMYB2P-1 may also be associated with the regulation of root system architecture. Overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 led to greater expression of Pi-responsive genes such as Oryza sativa UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase, OsIPS1, OsPAP10, OsmiR399a, and OsmiR399j. In contrast, overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 suppressed the expression of OsPHO2 under both Pi-sufficient and Pi-deficient conditions. Moreover, expression of OsPT2, which encodes a low-affinity Pi transporter, was up-regulated in OsMYB2P-1-overexpressing plants under Pi-sufficient conditions, whereas expression of the high-affinity Pi transporters OsPT6, OsPT8, and OsPT10 was up-regulated by overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 under Pi-deficient conditions, suggesting that OsMYB2P-1 may act as a Pi-dependent regulator in controlling the expression of Pi transporters. These findings demonstrate that OsMYB2P-1 is a novel R2R3 MYB transcriptional factor associated with Pi starvation signaling in rice.
j.1365-3040.2005.01272.x.pdf	Regulation of the expression of OsIPS1 and OsIPS2 in rice via systemic and local Pi signalling and hormones	2005	Plant Cell and Environment	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hua Jiachi Campus, Hangzhou, 310029, China	Two genes with a common region that is characteristic of the TPSI1/Mt4 family were cloned from a Pi-starvation-induced cDNA library of rice roots using suppression subtracted hybridization (SSH). Based on the consensus sequence of these two genes, members of the TPSI1/Mt4 family were found in maize, wheat and barley. BLAST and a cluster analysis in the eight members of the TPSI1/Mt4 family showed two classes of four genes each among monocots. The first gene from rice was designated OsIPS1 based on a comparison of the consensus sequence with AtIPS1, and consequently the second gene, which has been previously reported as OsPI1, was designated OsIPS2. Accumulation of the mRNA of OsIPS1/2 was examined by northern blotting and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in whole-root and split-root experiments under treatment with phosphate (Pi) and the Pi analogue phosphite (Phi). OsIPS1 showed much higher mRNA accumulation in roots than OsIPS2, and an opposite trend was seen in shoots. OsIPS1/2 showed both systemic and local responses to Pi starvation, and less than 10% of the overall induced mRNA level was due to the local Pi concentration in roots. The results indicate that Phi may interfere with earlier events in roots that are associated with a local Pi signalling pathway. An analysis of transgenic plants showed that OsIPS1/2 are independently responsive to Pi signalling and are mainly expressed in lateral roots and in the vascular cylinder in the primary root. Exogenous cytokinin (6-BA) almost completely suppressed systemic Pi starvation signalling and partially suppressed local Pi signalling. Exogenous abscisic acid remarkably reduced Pi starvation signalling. In contrast, exogenous auxin enhanced Pi signalling, especially local Pi signalling in roots. Exogenous ethylene (ethyphon) and the ratio of auxin to cytokinins did not appear to affect the expression of these two genes.
nph12499.pdf	Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa)	2014	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Phosphorus (P) is crucial nutrient element for crop growth and development. However, the network pathway regulating homeostasis of phosphate (Pi) in crops has many molecular breeding unknowns. Here, we report that an auxin response factor, OsARF12, functions in Pi homeostasis. Measurement of element content, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis and acid phosphatases (APases) activity assay showed that the osarf12 mutant and osarf12/25 double mutant with P-intoxicated phenotypes had higher P concentrations, up-regulation of the Pi transporter encoding genes and increased APase activity under Pi-sufficient/-deficient (+Pi/-Pi, 0.32/0 mM NaH2 PO4) conditions. Transcript analysis revealed that Pi-responsive genes--Phosphate starvation (OsIPS)1 and OsIPS2, SYG1/Pho81/XPR1(OsSPX1), Sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2 (OsSQD2), R2R3 MYB transcription factor (OsMYB2P-1) and Transport Inhibitor Response1 (OsTIR1)--were more abundant in the osarf12 and osarf12/25 mutants under +Pi/-Pi conditions. Knockout of OsARF12 also influenced the transcript abundances of the OsPHR2 gene and its downstream components, such as OsMiR399j, OsPHO2, OsMiR827, OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2. Results from -Pi/1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) treatments, and auxin reporter DR5::GUS staining suggest that root system alteration and Pi-induced auxin response were at least partially controlled by OsARF12. These findings enrich our understanding of the biological functions of OsARF12, which also acts in regulating Pi homeostasis.
NA	MiR529a controls plant height, tiller number, panicle architecture and grain size by regulating SPL target genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2021	Plant Sci	Institute of Crop Science, Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Crop Germplasm, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world. Breeding high-yield, multi-resistant and high-quality varieties has always been the goal of rice breeding. Rice tiller, panicle architecture and grain size are the constituent factors of yield, which are regulated by both genetic and environmental factors, including miRNAs, transcription factors, and downstream target genes. Previous studies have shown that SPL (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING-LIKE) transcription factors can control rice tiller, panicle architecture and grain size, which were regulated by miR156, miR529 and miR535. In this study, we obtained miR529a target mimicry (miR529a-MIMIC) transgenic plants to investigate plant phenotypes, physiological and molecular characteristics together with miR529a overexpression (miR529a-OE) and wild type (WT) to explore the function of miR529a and its SPL target genes in rice. We found that OsSPL2, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18 at seedling stage were regulated by miR529a, but there had complicated mechanism to control plant height. OsSPL2, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and SPL18 at tillering stage were regulated by miR529a to control plant height and tiller number. And panicle architecture and grain size were controlled by miR529a through altering the expression of all five target genes OsSPL2, OsSPL7, OsSPL14, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18. Our study suggested that miR529a might control rice growth and development by regulating different SPL target genes at different stages, which could provide a new method to improve rice yield by regulating miR529a and its SPL target genes.
NA	Modulation of nitrate-induced phosphate response by the MYB transcription factor RLI1/HINGE1 in the nucleus	2020	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, the Innovative Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China.	The coordinated utilization of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) is vital for plants to maintain nutrient balance and achieve optimal growth. Previously, we revealed a mechanism by which nitrate induces genes for phosphate utilization; this mechanism depends on NRT1.1B-facilitated degradation of cytoplasmic SPX4, which in turn promotes cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of PHR2, the central transcription factor of phosphate signaling, and triggers the nitrate-induced phosphate response (NIPR) and N-P coordinated utilization in rice. In this study, we unveiled a fine-tuning mechanism of NIPR in the nucleus regulated by Highly Induced by Nitrate Gene 1 (HINGE1, also known as RLI1), a MYB-transcription factor closely related to PHR2. RLI1/HINGE1, which is transcriptionally activated by PHR2 under nitrate induction, can directly activate the expression of phosphate starvation-induced genes. More importantly, RLI1/HINGE1 competes with PHR2 for binding to its repressor proteins in the nucleus (SPX proteins), and consequently releases PHR2 to further enhance phosphate response. Therefore, RLI1/HINGE1 amplifies the phosphate response in the nucleus downstream of the cytoplasmic SPX4-PHR2 cascade, thereby enabling fine-tuning of N-P balance when nitrate supply is sufficient.
