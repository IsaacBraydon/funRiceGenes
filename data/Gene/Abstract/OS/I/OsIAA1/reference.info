Aux/IAA and auxin response factor (ARF) are two important families that have been well recognized for their roles in auxin-mediated responses. Aux/IAA proteins are short-lived transcriptional regulators that mediate the auxin responses through interaction with ARF transcription factors. Although quite a few members of the Aux/IAA family have been functionally characterized in dicotyledonous plants such as Arabidopsis, but relatively limited information is available in important crops such as rice. This work focused on isolation and characterization of a member of Aux/IAA family in rice named OsIAA1. The results indicated that OsIAA1 was constitutively expressed in all the tissues and organs investigated. The expression of this gene was induced by various phytohormones including IAA, 2,4-D, kinetin, 24-epibrassinolide, and jasmonic acid. Over-expression of OsIAA1 in rice resulted in reduced inhibition of root elongation to auxin treatment, but increased sensitivity to 24-epiBL treatment. In addition, the OsIAA1-overexpression transgenic plants showed distinctive morphological changes such as decreased plant height and loose plant architecture. Protein interaction analysis suggested that OsIAA1 may act through interaction with OsARF1. T-DNA insertion mutant of OsARF1 showed reduced sensitivity to BR treatment, resembling the phenotype of OsIAA1-overexpression plants. In addition, expression patterns of some genes responsive to brassinosteroid and auxin were changed in the OsIAA1-overexpression plants. These data suggested that OsIAA1 may play important roles in the cross-talk of auxin and brassinosteroid signaling pathways and plant morphogenesis.
DNA Res-2001-Thakur-193-203.pdf	OsIAA1, an Aux/IAA cDNA from Rice, and Changes in Its Expression as Influenced by Auxin and Light	2001	DNA Research	Centre for Plant Molecular Biology and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, India.	The Aux/IAA class of genes are rapidly induced by exogenous auxins and have been characterized extensively from many dicot species like Arabidopsis, Glycine max and Pisum sativum. We report here the isolation and characterization of rice (Oryza sativa L. subsp. Indica) OsIAA1 cDNA as a monocot member of the Aux/IAA gene family. The predicted amino acid sequence of OsIAA1 corresponds to a protein of ca. 26 kDa, which harbors all four characteristic domains known to be conserved in Aux/IAA proteins. The conservation of these Aux/IAA genes indicates that auxins have essentially a similar mode of action in monocots and dicots. Northern blot analysis revealed that the OsIAA1 transcript levels decrease in the excised coleoptile segments on auxin starvation, and the level is restored when auxin is supplemented; the increase in OsIAA1 transcript level was apparent within 15 to 30 min of auxin application. Auxin-induced OsIAA1 expression appears to be correlated with the elongation of excised coleoptile segments. In light-grown rice seedlings, OsIAA1 is preferentially expressed in roots and basal segment of the seedling, whereas in the etiolated rice seedlings, the OsIAA1 transcripts are most abundant in the coleoptile. A comparative analysis in light- and dark-grown seedling tissues indicates that the OsIAA1 transcript levels decrease on illumination.

Auxin has pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development. AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) proteins are short-lived transcriptional regulators that mediate auxin responses through interaction with an auxin receptor, the F-box protein transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1). Most functions of Aux/IAA proteins have been identified in Arabidopsis by studying the gain-of-function mutants in domain II. In this study, we isolated and identified an Aux/IAA protein gene from rice, OsIAA4, whose protein contains a dominant mutation-type domain II. OsIAA4 has very low expression in the entire life cycle of rice. OsIAA4-overexpressing rice plants show dwarfism, increased tiller angles, reduced gravity response, and are less sensitive to synthetic auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D).
nph4248.pdf	Distinctive expression patterns and roles of the miRNA393/TIR1 homolog module in regulating flag leaf inclination and primary and crown root growth in rice (Oryza sativa)	2012	New Phytol	Key Laboratory for Cell and Gene Engineering of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.	* MicroRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation of auxin signaling components plays a critical role in plant development. miRNA expression and functional diversity contribute to the complexity of regulatory networks of miRNA/target modules. * This study functionally characterizes two members of the rice (Oryza sativa) miR393 family and their target genes, OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 (AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX), the two closest homologs of Arabidopsis TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 (TIR1). * We found that the miR393 family members possess distinctive expression patterns, with miR393a expressed mainly in the crown and lateral root primordia, as well as the coleoptile tip, and miR393b expressed in the shoot apical meristem. Transgenic plants overexpressing miR393a/b displayed a severe phenotype with hallmarks of altered auxin signaling, mainly including enlarged flag leaf inclination and altered primary and crown root growth. Furthermore, OsAFB2- and OsTIR1-suppressed lines exhibited increased inclination of flag leaves at the booting stage, resembling miR393-overexpressing plants. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 interact with OsIAA1. * Expression diversification of miRNA393 implies the potential role of miRNA regulation during species evolution. The conserved mechanisms of the miR393/target module indicate the fundamental importance of the miR393-mediated regulation of auxin signal transduction in rice.
NA	Functional analysis of auxin receptor OsTIR1/OsAFB family members in rice grain yield, tillering, plant height, root system, germination, and auxinic herbicide resistance	2020	New Phytol	Institute of Genetics and Regenerative Biology, Key Laboratory for Cell and Gene Engineering of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Auxin regulates almost every aspect of plant growth and development and is perceived by the TIR1/AFB auxin co-receptor proteins differentially acting in concert with specific Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors. Little is known about the diverse functions of TIR1/AFB family members in species other than Arabidopsis. We created targeted OsTIR1 and OsAFB2-5 mutations in rice using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and functionally characterized the roles of these five members in plant growth and development and auxinic herbicide resistance. Our results demonstrated that functions of OsTIR1/AFB family members are partially redundant in grain yield, tillering, plant height, root system and germination. Ostir1, Osafb2 and Osafb4 mutants exhibited more severe phenotypes than Osafb3 and Osafb5. The Ostir1Osafb2 double mutant displays extremely severe defects in plant development. All five OsTIR1/AFB members interacted with OsIAA1 and OsIAA11 proteins in vivo. Root elongation assay showed that each Ostir1/afb2-5 mutant was resistant to 2,4-D treatment. Notably, only the Osafb4 mutants were strongly resistant to herbicide picloram, suggesting that OsAFB4 is a unique auxin receptor in rice. Our findings demonstrate similarities and specificities of auxin receptor TIR1/AFB proteins in rice, and could offer the opportunity to modify effective herbicide-resistant alleles in agronomically important crops.
