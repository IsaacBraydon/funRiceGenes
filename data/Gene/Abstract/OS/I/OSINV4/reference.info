0300583.pdf	Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice	2006	Cell Biol Int	Cooperative Research Centre for Sustainable Rice Production, The University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia. emamun@bio.mq.edu.au	Chilling during male gametophyte development in rice inhibits development of microspores, causing male sterility. Changes in cellular ultrastructure that have been exposed to mild chilling include microspores with poor pollen wall formation, abnormal vacuolation and hypertrophy of the tapetum and unusual starch accumulation in the plastids of the endothecium in post-meiotic anthers. Anthers observed during tetrad release also have callose (1,3-beta-glucan) wall abnormalities as shown by immunocytochemical labelling. Expression of rice anther specific monosaccharide transporter (OsMST8) is greatly affected by chilling treatment. Perturbed carbohydrate metabolism, which is particularly triggered by repressed genes OsINV4 and OsMST8 during chilling, causes unusual starch storage in the endothecium and this also contributes to other symptoms such as vacuolation and poor microspore wall formation. Premature callose breakdown apparently restricts the basic framework of the future pollen wall. Vacuolation and hypertrophy are also symptoms of osmotic imbalance triggered by the reabsorption of callose breakdown products due to absence of OsMST8 activity.
j.1365-3040.2005.01390.x.pdf	Cold-induced repression of the rice anther-specific cell wall invertase gene OSINV4 is correlated with sucrose accumulation and pollen sterility	2005	Plant Cell and Environment	CSIRO Plant Industry, GPO Box 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.	Low temperatures during rice (Oryza sativa L.) pollen development cause pollen sterility and decreased grain yield. We show that the time of highest sensitivity to cold coincides with the time of peak tapetal activity: the transition of the tetrad to early uni-nucleate stage (young microspore, YM stage). Low temperatures at this stage of pollen development result in an accumulation of sucrose in the anthers, accompanied by decreased activity of cell wall bound acid invertase and depletion of starch in mature pollen grains. Expression analysis of two cell wall (OSINV1, 4) and one vacuolar (OSINV2) acid invertase genes showed that OSINV4 is anther-specific and downregulated by cold treatment. OSINV4 is transiently expressed in the tapetum cell layer at the YM stage, and later from the early binucleate stage in the maturing microspores. The down-regulation of OSINV4 expression in the tapetum at YM may cause a disruption in hexose production and starch formation in the pollen grains. In a cold-tolerant cultivar, OSINV4 expression was not reduced by cold; sucrose did not accumulate in the anthers and starch formation in the pollen grains was not affected.
NA	Identification of candidate genes controlling chilling tolerance of rice in the cold region at the booting stage by BSA-Seq and RNA-Seq	2020	R Soc Open Sci	Rice Research Institute of Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jiamusi 154026, People's Republic of China.	Rice is sensitive to low temperatures, specifically at the booting stage. Chilling tolerance of rice is a quantitative trait loci that is governed by multiple genes, and thus, its precise identification through the conventional methods is an arduous task. In this study, we investigated the candidate genes related to chilling tolerance at the booting stage of rice. The F2 population was derived from Longjing25 (chilling-tolerant) and Longjing11 (chilling-sensitive) cross. Two bulked segregant analysis pools were constructed. A 0.82 Mb region containing 98 annotated genes on chromosomes 6 and 9 was recognized as the candidate region associated with chilling tolerance of rice at the booting stage. Transcriptomic analysis of Longjing25 and Longjing11 revealed 50 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) on the candidate intervals. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed. Nine pathways were found to be enriched, which contained 10 DEGs. A total of four genes had different expression patterns or levels between Longjing25 and Longjing11. Four out of the 10 DEGs were considered as potential candidate genes for chilling tolerance. This study will assist in the cloning of the candidate genes responsible for chilling tolerance and molecular breeding of rice for the development of chilling-tolerant rice varieties.
