OsIAA12	 LC3 deficiency results in increased leaf inclination and enhanced expressions of OsIAA12 and OsGH3 |  Being consistent, transgenic plants with OsIAA12 overexpression or deficiency of OsARF17 which interacts with OsIAA12 do present enlarged leaf inclination	 Being consistent, transgenic plants with OsIAA12 overexpression or deficiency of OsARF17 which interacts with OsIAA12 do present enlarged leaf inclination
