OsIAA12	leaf	SPOC domain-containing protein Leaf inclination3 interacts with LIP1 to regulate rice leaf inclination through auxin signaling.	 LC3 deficiency results in increased leaf inclination and enhanced expressions of OsIAA12 and OsGH3
OsIAA12	leaf	SPOC domain-containing protein Leaf inclination3 interacts with LIP1 to regulate rice leaf inclination through auxin signaling.	 Being consistent, transgenic plants with OsIAA12 overexpression or deficiency of OsARF17 which interacts with OsIAA12 do present enlarged leaf inclination
