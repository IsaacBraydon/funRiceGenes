OSIPP3 gene (coding for pectin methylesterase inhibitor protein) was isolated from a pre-pollinated inflorescence-specific cDNA library by differential screening of stage-specific libraries from Oryza sativa. OSIPP3 is present in the genome of rice as a single copy gene. OSIPP3 gene was expressed exclusively in the pre-pollinated spikelets of rice. Upstream regulatory region (URR) of OSIPP3 was isolated and a series of 5'-deletions were cloned upstream of GUS reporter gene and were used to transform Arabidopsis. OSIPP3_del1 and del2 transgenic plants showed GUS expression in root, anther and silique, while OSIPP3_del3 showed GUS activity only in anthers and siliques. Pollen-specific expression was observed in case of plants harboring OSIPP3_del4 construct. It can, therefore, be concluded that the OSIPP3 URR between -178 and +108 bp is necessary for conferring pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis.
