Three homologs Os03g58260, Os03g58300 and Indole-3-glycerol phosphate lyase                         Os07g08430, have detectable transcript levels in seedling tissue and were expressed in both insect- Tryptophan synthase                                       damaged and control rice plants. Only Os03g58300, however, was up-regulated by insect feeding. Indirect defense                                          Recombinant proteins of the three rice genes were tested for IGL activity. Os03g58300 had a low Km Volatile emission                                         for indole-3-glycerol phosphate and a high kcat, and hence can efficiently produce indole. Os07g08430 Indole                                                    exhibited biochemical properties resembling characterized TSAs.
