OsiBBC1	leaf	Molecular characterization of a light-responsive gene, breast basic conserved protein 1 (OsiBBC1), encoding nuclear-localized protein homologous to ribosomal protein L13 from Oryza sativa indica	 Northern analysis showed that OsiBBC1 is expressed more in the young root, post-fertilized influorescence, leaf base and callus tissue, which are comprised of actively dividing cells, indicating its role in cell division
OsiBBC1	shoot	Molecular characterization of a light-responsive gene, breast basic conserved protein 1 (OsiBBC1), encoding nuclear-localized protein homologous to ribosomal protein L13 from Oryza sativa indica	 The OsiBBC1 transcript accumulated more in the root of light-grown seedlings as compared to the shoot while its levels were higher in the shoot as compared to root of the etiolated seedlings, indicating its down-regulation by light
OsiBBC1	cell division	Molecular characterization of a light-responsive gene, breast basic conserved protein 1 (OsiBBC1), encoding nuclear-localized protein homologous to ribosomal protein L13 from Oryza sativa indica	 Northern analysis showed that OsiBBC1 is expressed more in the young root, post-fertilized influorescence, leaf base and callus tissue, which are comprised of actively dividing cells, indicating its role in cell division
OsiBBC1	seedling	Molecular characterization of a light-responsive gene, breast basic conserved protein 1 (OsiBBC1), encoding nuclear-localized protein homologous to ribosomal protein L13 from Oryza sativa indica	 The OsiBBC1 transcript accumulated more in the root of light-grown seedlings as compared to the shoot while its levels were higher in the shoot as compared to root of the etiolated seedlings, indicating its down-regulation by light
