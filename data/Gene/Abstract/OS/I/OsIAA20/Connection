OsGH3-2|OsGH3.2	OsIAA20	Transcription Factor OsbZIP49 Controls Tiller Angle and Plant Architecture through the Induction of Indole-3-acetic Acid-amido Synthetases in Rice.	 Knockout of OsbZIP49 led to reduced expression of both OsGH3-2 and OsGH3-13 within the shoot base, and increased accumulation of IAA and increased OsIAA20 expression levels were observed in transformants following gravistimulation
