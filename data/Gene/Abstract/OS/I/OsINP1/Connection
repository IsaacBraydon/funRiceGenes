OsINP1	OsLecRK-S.7|OsLecRK5|OsDAF1	Rice pollen aperture formation is regulated by the interplay between OsINP1 and OsDAF1.	Rice pollen aperture formation is regulated by the interplay between OsINP1 and OsDAF1.
OsINP1	OsLecRK-S.7|OsLecRK5|OsDAF1	Rice pollen aperture formation is regulated by the interplay between OsINP1 and OsDAF1.	 Furthermore, our results demonstrate that OsINP1 is required for polarization of OsDAF1 via direct protein interaction, suggesting that OsINP1 has an additional role in the formation of annulus that is absent in Arabidopsis
