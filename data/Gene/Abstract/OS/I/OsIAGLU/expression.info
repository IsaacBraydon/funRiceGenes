OsIAGLU|OsIAAGLU	Overexpression of OsIAAGLU reveals a role for IAA-glucose conjugation in modulating rice plant architecture. |  Overexpression of OsIAAGLU in rice resulted in altered rice shoot architecture and root gravitropism |  Expression of OsIAAGLU could be induced by IAA and NAA |  Furthermore, overexpression of OsIAAGLU resulted in reduced sensitivity to IAA/NAA and altered gravitropic response of the roots in the transgenic plants	Overexpression of OsIAAGLU reveals a role for IAA-glucose conjugation in modulating rice plant architecture. |  Overexpression of OsIAAGLU in rice resulted in altered rice shoot architecture and root gravitropism |  Furthermore, overexpression of OsIAAGLU resulted in reduced sensitivity to IAA/NAA and altered gravitropic response of the roots in the transgenic plants
