OsIAGLU|OsIAAGLU	Overexpression of OsIAAGLU reveals a role for IAA-glucose conjugation in modulating rice plant architecture. |  Overexpression of OsIAAGLU in rice resulted in altered rice shoot architecture and root gravitropism |  Expression of OsIAAGLU could be induced by IAA and NAA |  Furthermore, overexpression of OsIAAGLU resulted in reduced sensitivity to IAA/NAA and altered gravitropic response of the roots in the transgenic plants	Overexpression of OsIAAGLU reveals a role for IAA-glucose conjugation in modulating rice plant architecture. |  Overexpression of OsIAAGLU in rice resulted in altered rice shoot architecture and root gravitropism |  Furthermore, overexpression of OsIAAGLU resulted in reduced sensitivity to IAA/NAA and altered gravitropic response of the roots in the transgenic plants
OsIAGLU|OsIAAGLU|OsIAGT1	 Further study indicated that expression of OsIAGT1 can be upregulated by auxin in rice, and with OsIAGT1 overexpressing lines we confirmed that OsIAGT1 is indeed able to glucosylate IAA in vivo |  Consistently, ectopic expression of OsIAGT1 leads to declined endogenous IAA content, as well as upregulated auxin synthesis genes and reduced expression of auxin-responsive genes, which likely leads to the reduced plant stature and root length in OsIAGT1 overexpression lines	 Consistently, ectopic expression of OsIAGT1 leads to declined endogenous IAA content, as well as upregulated auxin synthesis genes and reduced expression of auxin-responsive genes, which likely leads to the reduced plant stature and root length in OsIAGT1 overexpression lines
