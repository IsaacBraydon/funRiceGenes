OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsIAGLU|OsIAAGLU|OsIAGT1	Indole-3-acetate beta-glucosyltransferase OsIAGLU regulates seed vigor through mediating crosstalk between auxin and abscisic acid in rice.	 The continuously higher expressions of ABA INSENSITIVE 3 (OsABI3) and OsABI5 occurred in germinating seeds of osiaglu mutants compared to WT plants
