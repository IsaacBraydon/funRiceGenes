Tillering is an essential factor used to determine the overall architecture of cereal crops. It has long been recognized that the development of branching patterns is controlled by the level and distribution of auxin within a plant. To better understand the relationship between auxin levels and tillering in rice, we examined rice plants with increased or decreased levels of free IAA. To decrease IAA levels, we selected the rice IAA-glucose synthase gene (OsIAGLU) from the rice genome database based on high sequence homology with IAA-glucose synthase from maize (ZmIAGLU), which is known to generate IAAglucose conjugate from free IAA. The OsIAGLU gene driven by the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter was transformed into a rice cultivar to generate transgenic rice plants constitutively over-expressing this gene. The number of tillers and panicles significantly increased in the transgenic lines compared to the wild-type plants, while plant height and panicle length decreased. These results indicate that decreased levels of free IAA likely enhance tiller formation in rice. To increase levels of free IAA, we treated rice plants with three different concentrations of exogenous IAA (1 μM, 10 μM and 100 μM) twice a week by spraying. Exogenous IAA treatment at concentrations of 10 μM and 100 μM significantly reduced tiller number in three different rice cultivars. These results indicate that exogenously applied IAA inhibits shoot branching in rice. Overall, auxin tightly controls tiller formation in rice in a negative way.
