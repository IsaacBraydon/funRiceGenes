Tillering is an essential factor used to determine the overall architecture of cereal crops. It has long been recognized that the development of branching patterns is controlled by the level and distribution of auxin within a plant. To better understand the relationship between auxin levels and tillering in rice, we examined rice plants with increased or decreased levels of free IAA. To decrease IAA levels, we selected the rice IAA-glucose synthase gene (OsIAGLU) from the rice genome database based on high sequence homology with IAA-glucose synthase from maize (ZmIAGLU), which is known to generate IAAglucose conjugate from free IAA. The OsIAGLU gene driven by the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter was transformed into a rice cultivar to generate transgenic rice plants constitutively over-expressing this gene. The number of tillers and panicles significantly increased in the transgenic lines compared to the wild-type plants, while plant height and panicle length decreased. These results indicate that decreased levels of free IAA likely enhance tiller formation in rice. To increase levels of free IAA, we treated rice plants with three different concentrations of exogenous IAA (1 Î¼M, 10 Î¼M and 100 Î¼M) twice a week by spraying. Exogenous IAA treatment at concentrations of 10 Î¼M and 100 Î¼M significantly reduced tiller number in three different rice cultivars. These results indicate that exogenously applied IAA inhibits shoot branching in rice. Overall, auxin tightly controls tiller formation in rice in a negative way.
NA	Overexpression of OsIAAGLU reveals a role for IAA-glucose conjugation in modulating rice plant architecture.	2019	Plant Cell Rep	College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, People's Republic of China.	OsIAAGLU could catalyze the reaction of IAA with glucose to generate IAA-glucose. Overexpression of OsIAAGLU in rice resulted in altered rice shoot architecture and root gravitropism. The distribution and levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) within plant tissues are well known to play vital roles in plant growth and development. An important mechanism of regulating free IAA levels in monocots is formation of IAA ester conjugates. In this study, a cytosol-localized protein encoded by the rice gene of indole-3-acetic acid glucosyltransferase (OsIAAGLU) was found to catalyze the reaction of free IAA with glucose to generate IAA-glucose. Expression of OsIAAGLU could be induced by IAA and NAA. The number of tillers and leaf angle was significantly increased with a concomitant decrease in plant height and panicle length in the transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsIAAGLU compared to the wild-type (WT) plants. Phenotypes of iaaglu mutants constructed using the CRISPR/Cas9 system had no obvious differences with WT plants. Furthermore, overexpression of OsIAAGLU resulted in reduced sensitivity to IAA/NAA and altered gravitropic response of the roots in the transgenic plants. Free IAA contents in the leaves, root tips, and lamina joint of OsIAAGLU-overexpressing transgenic lines were lower than those of WT plants. These results support that OsIAAGLU could play a regulatory role in IAA homeostasis and rice architecture.
NA	OsIAGT1 Is a Glucosyltransferase Gene Involved in the Glucose Conjugation of Auxins in Rice.	2019	Rice (N Y)	The Key Lab of Plant Development and Environment Adaptation Biology, Ministry of Education of China, School of Life Sciences, Shandong University, Qingdao, 266237, China.	In cereal crop rice, auxin is known as an important class of plant hormone that regulates a plethora of plant growth and development. Glycosylation of auxin is known to be one of the important mechanisms mediating auxin homeostasis. However, the relevant auxin glucosyltransferase (GT) in rice still remains largely unknown.In this study, using known auxin glucosyltransferases from other species as queries, twelve putative auxin UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) genes were cloned from rice and the one showing highest sequence similarity, named as OsIAGT1, was expressed as recombinant protein. In vitro enzymatic analysis showed that recombinant OsIAGT1 was capable of catalyzing glucosylation of IAA, IBA and other auxin analogs, and that OsIAGT1 is quite tolerant to a broad range of reaction conditions with peak activity at 30 ¡ã§³ and pH<U+2009>8.0. OsIAGT1 showed favorite activity towards native auxins over artificially synthesized ones. Further study indicated that expression of OsIAGT1 can be upregulated by auxin in rice, and with OsIAGT1 overexpressing lines we confirmed that OsIAGT1 is indeed able to glucosylate IAA in vivo. Consistently, ectopic expression of OsIAGT1 leads to declined endogenous IAA content, as well as upregulated auxin synthesis genes and reduced expression of auxin-responsive genes, which likely leads to the reduced plant stature and root length in OsIAGT1 overexpression lines.Our result indicated that OsIAGT1 plays an important role in mediating auxin homeostasis by catalyzing auxin glucosylation, and by which OsIAGT1 regulates growth and development in rice.
NA	Indole-3-acetate beta-glucosyltransferase OsIAGLU regulates seed vigor through mediating crosstalk between auxin and abscisic acid in rice.	2020	Plant Biotechnol J	The Laboratory of Seed Science and Technology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Breeding, State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, People's Republic of China.	Seed vigor is an important trait for direct seeding in rice. In this study, indole-3-acetate beta-glucosyltransferase OsIAGLU was cloned in rice, and its roles on seed vigor were mainly investigated. Disruption of OsIAGLU resulted in low seed vigor in rice. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the expressions of OsIAGLU were relatively higher in the late developing and the early germinating seeds and were significantly induced by indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Transcriptome analysis revealed that the IAA- and ABA-related genes were involved in the OsIAGLU regulation of seed vigor in rice. The higher levels of free IAA and ABA were identified in germinating seeds of osiaglu mutants compared to wide-type (WT) plants. When treated with exogenous IAA and ABA, the osiaglu mutants and WT plants showed sensitivity to ABA while not IAA, but the exogenous IAA amplified ABA-induced reduction of seed vigor in rice. The continuously higher expressions of ABA INSENSITIVE 3 (OsABI3) and OsABI5 occurred in germinating seeds of osiaglu mutants compared to WT plants. The regulation of seed vigor by OsIAGLU might be through modulating IAA and ABA levels to alert OsABIs expression in germinating seeds in rice. Based on analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphism data of rice accessions, two haplotypes of OsIAGLU that positively correlated with seed vigor were identified in indica accessions. This study provides important insights into the roles of OsIAGLU on seed vigor and facilitates the practical use of OsIAGLU in rice breeding.
