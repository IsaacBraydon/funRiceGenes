OsIAA3	iaa	Production and characterization of auxin-insensitive rice by overexpression of a mutagenized rice IAA protein	 OsIAA3 is one of these family members whose expression is rapidly increased in response to auxin| We produced transgenic rice harboring mOsIAA3-GR, which can overproduce mutant OsIAA3 protein containing an amino acid change in domain II to cause a gain-of-function phenotype, by treatment with dexamethasone
