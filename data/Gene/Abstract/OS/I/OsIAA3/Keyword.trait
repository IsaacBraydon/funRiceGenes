OsIAA3	auxin	Production and characterization of auxin-insensitive rice by overexpression of a mutagenized rice IAA protein	OsIAA3 is one of these family members whose expression is rapidly increased in response to auxin
OsIAA3	iaa	Production and characterization of auxin-insensitive rice by overexpression of a mutagenized rice IAA protein	OsIAA3 is one of these family members whose expression is rapidly increased in response to auxin
OsIAA3	iaa	Production and characterization of auxin-insensitive rice by overexpression of a mutagenized rice IAA protein	We produced transgenic rice harboring mOsIAA3-GR, which can overproduce mutant OsIAA3 protein containing an amino acid change in domain II to cause a gain-of-function phenotype, by treatment with dexamethasone
OsIAA3	root	Supraoptimal Cytokinin Content Inhibits Rice Seminal Root Growth by Reducing Root Meristem Size and Cell Length via Increased Ethylene Content.	 Ethylene produced in response to exogenous KT inhibited rice seminal root growth by reducing meristem size via upregulation of OsIAA3 transcription and reduced cell length by downregulating transcription of cell elongation-related genes
OsIAA3	root	Supraoptimal Cytokinin Content Inhibits Rice Seminal Root Growth by Reducing Root Meristem Size and Cell Length via Increased Ethylene Content.	 Moreover, the effects of KT treatment on rice seminal root growth, root meristem size and cell length were rescued by treatment with aminoethoxyvinylglycine (an inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis), which restored ethylene level and transcription levels of OsIAA3 and cell elongation-related genes
