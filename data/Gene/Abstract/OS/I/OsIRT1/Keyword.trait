Symbol	Keyword	Title	Evidence
OsIRT1	ethylene	Ethylene is involved in the regulation of iron homeostasis by regulating the expression of iron-acquisition-related genes in Oryza sativa	 RNA interference of OsIRO2 in transgenic rice showed that ethylene acted via this transcription factor to induce the expression of OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsYSL15, and OsIRT1
OsIRT1	transporter	Cloning an iron-regulated metal transporter from rice	 This suggests that OsIRT1 is a functional metal transporter for iron, and is actively engaged in Fe uptake from soils, especially under limiting conditions
OsIRT1	root	OsARF12, a transcription activator on auxin response gene, regulates root elongation and affects iron accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa)	 The knockout of OsARF12 also altered the abundance of mitochondrial iron-regulated (OsMIR), iron (Fe)-regulated transporter1 (OsIRT1) and short postembryonic root1 (OsSPR1) in roots of rice, and resulted in lower Fe content
OsIRT1	transporter	Rice plants take up iron as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and as Fe2+	 In spite of being a Strategy II plant, however, rice (Oryza sativa) contains the previously identified Fe2+ transporter OsIRT1| Real-time PCR analysis revealed that OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 are expressed predominantly in roots, and these transporters are induced by low-Fe conditions
OsIRT1	iron	Over-expression of OsIRT1 leads to increased iron and zinc accumulations in rice	Over-expression of OsIRT1 leads to increased iron and zinc accumulations in rice
OsIRT1	root	Cloning an iron-regulated metal transporter from rice	 Northern blot analysis revealed that OsIRT1 mRNA was predominantly expressed in roots and was induced by Fe and Cu‐deficiency
OsIRT1	transporter	Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice	 Yeast mutants expressing OsIRT1 and OsIRT2, which encode the rice Fe2+ transporter, became more sensitive to Cd, suggesting that Cd was absorbed by OsIRT1 and OsIRT2|Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice

OsIRT1	transporter	Mutational reconstructed ferric chelate reductase confers enhanced tolerance in rice to iron deficiency in calcareous soil	 A yeast Fe3+ chelate-reductase gene refre1/372, selected for better performance at high pH, was fused to the promoter of the Fe-regulated transporter, OsIRT1, and introduced into rice plants
OsIRT1	homeostasis	Over-expression of OsIRT1 leads to increased iron and zinc accumulations in rice	 We generated transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsIRT1 to evaluate its functional roles in metal homeostasis
OsIRT1	cadmium	Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice	Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice
OsIRT1	root	Rice plants take up iron as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and as Fe2+	 Real-time PCR analysis revealed that OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 are expressed predominantly in roots, and these transporters are induced by low-Fe conditions| OsIRT1 promoter-GUS analysis revealed that OsIRT1 is expressed in the epidermis and exodermis of the elongating zone and in the inner layer of the cortex of the mature zone of Fe-deficient roots
OsIRT1	iron	Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice	Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice
OsIRT1	transporter	OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice	 Four distinct genes, OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP6, and OsZIP7 that exhibit sequence similarity to the rice ferrous ion transporter, OsIRT1, were isolated
OsIRT1	zinc	Over-expression of OsIRT1 leads to increased iron and zinc accumulations in rice	Over-expression of OsIRT1 leads to increased iron and zinc accumulations in rice
OsIRT1	mitochondria	OsARF12, a transcription activator on auxin response gene, regulates root elongation and affects iron accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa)	 The knockout of OsARF12 also altered the abundance of mitochondrial iron-regulated (OsMIR), iron (Fe)-regulated transporter1 (OsIRT1) and short postembryonic root1 (OsSPR1) in roots of rice, and resulted in lower Fe content
OsIRT1	grain	Over-expression of OsIRT1 leads to increased iron and zinc accumulations in rice	 This demonstrates that OsIRT1 can be used for enhancing micronutrient levels in rice grains
OsIRT1	iron	Cloning an iron-regulated metal transporter from rice	 When expressed in yeast cells, OsIRT1 cDNA reversed the growth defects of the yeast iron‐uptake mutant| This suggests that OsIRT1 is a functional metal transporter for iron, and is actively engaged in Fe uptake from soils, especially under limiting conditions
