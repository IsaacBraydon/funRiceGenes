Differential screening of a stage-specific cDNA library of Indica rice has been used to identify two genes expressed in pre-pollination stage panicles, namely OSIPA and OSIPK coding for proteins similar to expansins/pollen allergens and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK), respectively. Northern analysis and in situ hybridizations indicate that OSIPA expresses exclusively in pollen while OSIPK expresses in pollen as well as anther wall. Promoters of these two anther-specific genes show the presence of various cis-acting elements (GTGA and AGAAA) known to confer anther/pollen-specific gene expression. Organ/tissue-specific activity and strength of their regulatory regions have been determined in transgenic systems, i.e., tobacco and Arabidopsis. A unique temporal activity of these two promoters was observed during various developmental stages of anther/pollen. Promoter of OSIPA is active during the late stages of pollen development and remains active till the anthesis, whereas, OSIPK promoter is active to a low level in developing anther till the pollen matures. OSIPK promoter activity diminishes before anthesis. Both promoters show a potential to target expression of the gene of interest in developmental stage-specific manner and can help engineer pollen-specific traits like male-sterility in plants.
