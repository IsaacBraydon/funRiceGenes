Differential screening of a stage-specific cDNA library of Indica rice has been used to identify two genes expressed in pre-pollination stage panicles, namely OSIPA and OSIPK coding for proteins similar to expansins/pollen allergens and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK), respectively. Northern analysis and in situ hybridizations indicate that OSIPA expresses exclusively in pollen while OSIPK expresses in pollen as well as anther wall. Promoters of these two anther-specific genes show the presence of various cis-acting elements (GTGA and AGAAA) known to confer anther/pollen-specific gene expression. Organ/tissue-specific activity and strength of their regulatory regions have been determined in transgenic systems, i.e., tobacco and Arabidopsis. A unique temporal activity of these two promoters was observed during various developmental stages of anther/pollen. Promoter of OSIPA is active during the late stages of pollen development and remains active till the anthesis, whereas, OSIPK promoter is active to a low level in developing anther till the pollen matures. OSIPK promoter activity diminishes before anthesis. Both promoters show a potential to target expression of the gene of interest in developmental stage-specific manner and can help engineer pollen-specific traits like male-sterility in plants.
NA	OsCPK29 interacts with MADS68 to regulate pollen development in rice.	2022	Plant Sci	National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR), New Delhi 110067, India; Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi, South Campus (UDSC), New Delhi 110021, India.	Pollen development and its germination are obligatory for the reproductive success of flowering plants. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs, also known as CDPKs) regulate diverse signaling pathways controlling plant growth and development. Here, we report the functional characterization of a novel OsCPK29 from rice, which is mainly expressed during pollen maturation stages of the anther. OsCPK29 exclusively localizes in the nucleus, and its N-terminal variable domain is responsible for retaining it in the nucleus. OsCPK29 knockdown rice plants exhibit reduced fertility, set fewer seeds, and produce collapsed non-viable pollen grains that do not germinate. Cytological analysis of anther semi-thin sections during different developmental stages suggested that pollen abnormalities appear after the vacuolated pollen stage. Detailed microscopic study of pollen grains further revealed that they were lacking the functional intine layer although exine layer was present. Consistent with that, downregulation of known intine development-related rice genes was also observed in OsCPK29 silenced anthers. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that OsCPK29 interacts in vitro as well as in vivo with the MADS68 transcription factor which is a known regulator of pollen development. Therefore, phenotypic observations and molecular studies suggest that OsCPK29 is an important regulator of pollen development in rice.
