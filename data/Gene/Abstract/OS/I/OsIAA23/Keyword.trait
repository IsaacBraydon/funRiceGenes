OsIAA23	development	Different knockout genotypes of OsIAA23 in rice using CRISPR/Cas9 generating different phenotypes.	 In rice, the gene OsIAA23 (Os06t0597000) is known to affect development of roots and shoots, but previous knockouts in OsIAA23 have been sterile and difficult for research continuously
