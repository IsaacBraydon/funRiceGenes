2011-24.pdf	A gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 affects lateral root development in rice	2012	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, People's Republic of China.	Lateral roots are important to plants for the uptake of nutrients and water. Several members of the Aux/IAA family have been shown to play crucial roles in lateral root development. Here, a member of the rice Aux/IAA family genes, OsIAA11 (LOC_Os03g43400), was isolated from a rice mutant defective in lateral root development. The gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 strictly blocks the initiation of lateral root primordia, but it does not affect crown root development. The expression of OsIAA11 is defined in root tips, lateral root caps, steles, and lateral root primordia. The auxin reporter DR5-GUS (beta-glucuronidase) was expressed at lower levels in the mutant than in wild-type, indicating that OsIAA11 is involved in auxin signaling in root caps. The transcript abundance of both OsPIN1b and OsPIN10a was diminished in root tips of the Osiaa11 mutant. Taken together, the results indicate that the gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 caused the inhibition of lateral root development in rice.
NA	Rice Inositol Polyphosphate Kinase (OsIPK2) Directly Interacts with OsIAA11 to Regulate Lateral Root Formation.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430072, China.	The plant hormone auxin controls many aspects of plant growth and development by promoting the degradation of Auxin/Indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) proteins. The domain II (DII) of Aux/IAA proteins is sufficient for eliciting the degradation by direct interacting with the auxin receptor F-box protein TIR1 to form a TIR1/AFBs-Aux/IAA complex in an auxin-dependent manner. However, the underlying mechanism of fine-tuning Aux/IAA degradation by auxin stimuli has remained to be elucidated. Here, we show that OsIPK2, a rice (Oryza sativa) inositol polyphosphate kinase, directly interacts with an Aux/IAA protein OsIAA11 to repress its degradation. In a rice protoplast transient expression system, the auxin-induced degradation of Myc-OsIAA11 fusion was delayed by co-expressed GFP-OsIPK2 proteins. Furthermore, expressing additional OsIPK2 or its N-terminal amino acid sequence enhanced the accumulation of OsIAA11 protein in transgenic plants, which in turn caused defects in lateral root formation and auxin response. Taken together, we identify a novel co-factor of Aux/IAA in auxin signaling and demonstrate its role in regulating lateral root development.
NA	Callus initiation from root explants employs different strategies in rice and Arabidopsis.	2018	Plant Cell Physiol	Institute of Genetic and Regenerative Biology, Key Laboratory for Cell and Gene Engineering of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Callus formation in tissue culture follows the rooting pathway and newly formed callus seems to be a group of root primordium-like cells. However, it is not clear whether there are multiple mechanisms of callus initiation in different species and in different organs. Here we show that the OsIAA11-mediated pathway is specifically and strictly required for callus initiation in the lateral root (LR) formation region of the primary root (PR) but not for callus initiation at the root tip or the stem base in rice. OsIAA11 and its Arabidopsis homologue AtIAA14 are key players in lateral rooting. However, the AtIAA14-mediated pathway is not strictly required for callus initiation in the LR formation region in Arabidopsis. LRs can be initiated either through the AtIAA14-mediated or AtWOX11-mediated pathway in the Arabidopsis PR, therefore providing optional pathways for callus initiation. By contrast, OsIAA11 is strictly required for lateral rooting in the rice PR, meaning the OsIAA11 pathway is the only choice for callus initiation. Our study suggests that multiple pathways may converge to WOX5 activation during callus formation in different organs and different species.
NA	Tuning a timing device that regulates lateral root development in rice.	2019	J Biomol NMR	Department of Molecular Biology &amp; Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA.	Peptidyl Prolyl Isomerases (PPIases) accelerate cis-trans isomerization of prolyl peptide bonds. In rice, the PPIase LRT2 is essential for lateral root initiation. LRT2 displays in vitro isomerization of a highly conserved W-P peptide bond (104W-P105) in the natural substrate OsIAA11. OsIAA11 is a transcription repressor that, in response to the plant hormone auxin, is targeted to ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation via specific recognition of the cis isomer of its 104W-P105 peptide bond. OsIAA11 controls transcription of specific genes, including its own, that are required for lateral root development. This auxin-responsive negative feedback circuit governs patterning and development of lateral roots along the primary root. The ability to tune LRT2 activity via mutagenesis is crucial for understanding and modeling the role of this bimodal switch in the auxin circuit and lateral root development. We present characterization of the thermal stability and isomerization rates of several LRT2 mutants acting on the OsIAA11 substrate. The thermally stable mutants display activities lower than that of wild-type (WT) LRT2. These include binding diminished but catalytically active P125K, binding incompetent W128A, and binding capable but catalytically incompetent H133Q mutations. Additionally, LRT2 homologs hCypA from human, TaCypA from Triticum aestivum (wheat) and PPIB from E. coli were shown to have 110, 50 and 60% of WT LRT2 activity on the OsIAA11 substrate. These studies identify several thermally stable LRT2 mutants with altered activities that will be useful for establishing relationships between cis-trans isomerization, auxin circuit dynamics, and lateral root development in rice.
NA	Functional analysis of auxin receptor OsTIR1/OsAFB family members in rice grain yield, tillering, plant height, root system, germination, and auxinic herbicide resistance	2020	New Phytol	Institute of Genetics and Regenerative Biology, Key Laboratory for Cell and Gene Engineering of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Auxin regulates almost every aspect of plant growth and development and is perceived by the TIR1/AFB auxin co-receptor proteins differentially acting in concert with specific Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors. Little is known about the diverse functions of TIR1/AFB family members in species other than Arabidopsis. We created targeted OsTIR1 and OsAFB2-5 mutations in rice using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and functionally characterized the roles of these five members in plant growth and development and auxinic herbicide resistance. Our results demonstrated that functions of OsTIR1/AFB family members are partially redundant in grain yield, tillering, plant height, root system and germination. Ostir1, Osafb2 and Osafb4 mutants exhibited more severe phenotypes than Osafb3 and Osafb5. The Ostir1Osafb2 double mutant displays extremely severe defects in plant development. All five OsTIR1/AFB members interacted with OsIAA1 and OsIAA11 proteins in vivo. Root elongation assay showed that each Ostir1/afb2-5 mutant was resistant to 2,4-D treatment. Notably, only the Osafb4 mutants were strongly resistant to herbicide picloram, suggesting that OsAFB4 is a unique auxin receptor in rice. Our findings demonstrate similarities and specificities of auxin receptor TIR1/AFB proteins in rice, and could offer the opportunity to modify effective herbicide-resistant alleles in agronomically important crops.
