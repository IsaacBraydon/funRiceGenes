2011-24.pdf	A gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 affects lateral root development in rice	2012	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, People's Republic of China.	Lateral roots are important to plants for the uptake of nutrients and water. Several members of the Aux/IAA family have been shown to play crucial roles in lateral root development. Here, a member of the rice Aux/IAA family genes, OsIAA11 (LOC_Os03g43400), was isolated from a rice mutant defective in lateral root development. The gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 strictly blocks the initiation of lateral root primordia, but it does not affect crown root development. The expression of OsIAA11 is defined in root tips, lateral root caps, steles, and lateral root primordia. The auxin reporter DR5-GUS (beta-glucuronidase) was expressed at lower levels in the mutant than in wild-type, indicating that OsIAA11 is involved in auxin signaling in root caps. The transcript abundance of both OsPIN1b and OsPIN10a was diminished in root tips of the Osiaa11 mutant. Taken together, the results indicate that the gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 caused the inhibition of lateral root development in rice.
NA	Rice Inositol Polyphosphate Kinase (OsIPK2) Directly Interacts with OsIAA11 to Regulate Lateral Root Formation.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430072, China.	The plant hormone auxin controls many aspects of plant growth and development by promoting the degradation of Auxin/Indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) proteins. The domain II (DII) of Aux/IAA proteins is sufficient for eliciting the degradation by direct interacting with the auxin receptor F-box protein TIR1 to form a TIR1/AFBs-Aux/IAA complex in an auxin-dependent manner. However, the underlying mechanism of fine-tuning Aux/IAA degradation by auxin stimuli has remained to be elucidated. Here, we show that OsIPK2, a rice (Oryza sativa) inositol polyphosphate kinase, directly interacts with an Aux/IAA protein OsIAA11 to repress its degradation. In a rice protoplast transient expression system, the auxin-induced degradation of Myc-OsIAA11 fusion was delayed by co-expressed GFP-OsIPK2 proteins. Furthermore, expressing additional OsIPK2 or its N-terminal amino acid sequence enhanced the accumulation of OsIAA11 protein in transgenic plants, which in turn caused defects in lateral root formation and auxin response. Taken together, we identify a novel co-factor of Aux/IAA in auxin signaling and demonstrate its role in regulating lateral root development.
NA	Callus initiation from root explants employs different strategies in rice and Arabidopsis.	2018	Plant Cell Physiol	Institute of Genetic and Regenerative Biology, Key Laboratory for Cell and Gene Engineering of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Callus formation in tissue culture follows the rooting pathway and newly formed callus seems to be a group of root primordium-like cells. However, it is not clear whether there are multiple mechanisms of callus initiation in different species and in different organs. Here we show that the OsIAA11-mediated pathway is specifically and strictly required for callus initiation in the lateral root (LR) formation region of the primary root (PR) but not for callus initiation at the root tip or the stem base in rice. OsIAA11 and its Arabidopsis homologue AtIAA14 are key players in lateral rooting. However, the AtIAA14-mediated pathway is not strictly required for callus initiation in the LR formation region in Arabidopsis. LRs can be initiated either through the AtIAA14-mediated or AtWOX11-mediated pathway in the Arabidopsis PR, therefore providing optional pathways for callus initiation. By contrast, OsIAA11 is strictly required for lateral rooting in the rice PR, meaning the OsIAA11 pathway is the only choice for callus initiation. Our study suggests that multiple pathways may converge to WOX5 activation during callus formation in different organs and different species.
