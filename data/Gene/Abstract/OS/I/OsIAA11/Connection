OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsIAA11	Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.	 Here we show that peptidyl-prolyl isomerization of rice OsIAA11 catalysed by LATERAL ROOTLESS2 (LRT2), a cyclophilin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, directly regulates the stability of OsIAA11
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsIAA11	Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.	 NMR spectroscopy reveals that LRT2 efficiently catalyses the cis/trans isomerization of OsIAA11
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsIAA11	Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.	 The lrt2 mutation reduces OsTIR1-OsIAA11 interaction and consequently causes the accumulation of a higher level of OsIAA11 protein
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsIAA11	Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.	 Moreover, knockdown of the OsIAA11 expression partially rescues the lrt2 mutant phenotype in lateral root development
