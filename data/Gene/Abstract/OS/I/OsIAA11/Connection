OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsIAA11	Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.	Here we show that peptidyl-prolyl isomerization of rice OsIAA11 catalysed by LATERAL ROOTLESS2 (LRT2), a cyclophilin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, directly regulates the stability of OsIAA11
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsIAA11	Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.	NMR spectroscopy reveals that LRT2 efficiently catalyses the cis/trans isomerization of OsIAA11
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsIAA11	Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.	The lrt2 mutation reduces OsTIR1-OsIAA11 interaction and consequently causes the accumulation of a higher level of OsIAA11 protein
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsIAA11	Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.	Moreover, knockdown of the OsIAA11 expression partially rescues the lrt2 mutant phenotype in lateral root development
OsIAA11	OsIPK2|IPK2|IP6K	Rice Inositol Polyphosphate Kinase (OsIPK2) Directly Interacts with OsIAA11 to Regulate Lateral Root Formation.	Rice Inositol Polyphosphate Kinase (OsIPK2) Directly Interacts with OsIAA11 to Regulate Lateral Root Formation.
OsIAA11	OsIPK2|IPK2|IP6K	Rice Inositol Polyphosphate Kinase (OsIPK2) Directly Interacts with OsIAA11 to Regulate Lateral Root Formation.	 Here, we show that OsIPK2, a rice (Oryza sativa) inositol polyphosphate kinase, directly interacts with an Aux/IAA protein OsIAA11 to repress its degradation
OsIAA11	OsIPK2|IPK2|IP6K	Rice Inositol Polyphosphate Kinase (OsIPK2) Directly Interacts with OsIAA11 to Regulate Lateral Root Formation.	 Furthermore, expressing additional OsIPK2 or its N-terminal amino acid sequence enhanced the accumulation of OsIAA11 protein in transgenic plants, which in turn caused defects in lateral root formation and auxin response
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsIAA11	Quantification of reaction cycle parameters for an essential molecular switch in an auxin-responsive transcription circuit in rice.	 In rice, a tryptophan-proline (W-P) cis-trans switch in transcription repressor protein OsIAA11 along with its associated cyclophilin LRT2 are essential components in a negative feedback gene regulation circuit that controls lateral root initiation in response to the plant hormone auxin
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsIAA11	Quantification of reaction cycle parameters for an essential molecular switch in an auxin-responsive transcription circuit in rice.	 Here we present NMR studies that determine and independently validate these parameters for LRT2 catalysis of the W-P motif in OsIAA11, providing predictive power for understanding the role of this switch in the auxin-responsive circuit and the resulting lateral rootless phenotype in rice
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsIAA11	Quantification of reaction cycle parameters for an essential molecular switch in an auxin-responsive transcription circuit in rice.	 We show that the observed isomerization rate is linearly dependent on LRT2 concentration but is independent of OsIAA11 concentration over a wide range, and LRT2 is optimally tuned to maintain OsIAA11 at its cis-trans equilibrium to supply the slower downstream cis-specific proteasomal degradation with maximal OsIAA11 substrate
