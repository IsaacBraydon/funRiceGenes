OsIFL	 Our investigations clearly establish that the heterologous expression of OsIFL in three diverse organisms (bacteria, yeast and tobacco) provides survival advantage towards diverse abiotic stresses |  Overexpression of OsIFL in transgenic tobacco plants conferred salinity stress tolerance by maintaining favourable K(+)/Na(+) ratio and thus showed protection from salinity stress induced ion toxicity	 Overexpression of OsIFL in transgenic tobacco plants conferred salinity stress tolerance by maintaining favourable K(+)/Na(+) ratio and thus showed protection from salinity stress induced ion toxicity
OsIFL|OsIF	 Overexpression of OsIF in transgenic rice enhanced tolerance to salinity and heat stress, while its knock-down (KD) rendered plants more sensitive thereby indicating the role of IFs in promoting survival under stress |  Seeds of OsIF overexpression rice germinated normally in the presence of high salt, showed better growth, maintained chloroplast ultrastructure and favourable K+/Na+ ratio than the wild type (WT) and KD plants |  Analysis of photosynthesis and chlorophyll a fluorescence data suggested better performance of both photosystem I and II in the OsIF overexpression rice under salinity stress as compared to the WT and KD	 Overexpression of OsIF in transgenic rice enhanced tolerance to salinity and heat stress, while its knock-down (KD) rendered plants more sensitive thereby indicating the role of IFs in promoting survival under stress |  Seeds of OsIF overexpression rice germinated normally in the presence of high salt, showed better growth, maintained chloroplast ultrastructure and favourable K+/Na+ ratio than the wild type (WT) and KD plants |  Analysis of photosynthesis and chlorophyll a fluorescence data suggested better performance of both photosystem I and II in the OsIF overexpression rice under salinity stress as compared to the WT and KD
