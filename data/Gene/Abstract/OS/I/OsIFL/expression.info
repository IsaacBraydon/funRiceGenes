OsIFL	 Our investigations clearly establish that the heterologous expression of OsIFL in three diverse organisms (bacteria, yeast and tobacco) provides survival advantage towards diverse abiotic stresses |  Overexpression of OsIFL in transgenic tobacco plants conferred salinity stress tolerance by maintaining favourable K(+)/Na(+) ratio and thus showed protection from salinity stress induced ion toxicity	 Overexpression of OsIFL in transgenic tobacco plants conferred salinity stress tolerance by maintaining favourable K(+)/Na(+) ratio and thus showed protection from salinity stress induced ion toxicity
