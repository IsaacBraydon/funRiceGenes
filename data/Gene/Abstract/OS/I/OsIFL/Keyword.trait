OsIFL|OsIF	salinity	Evidence for nuclear interaction of a cytoskeleton protein (OsIFL) with metallothionein and its role in salinity stress tolerance.	Overexpression of OsIFL in transgenic tobacco plants conferred salinity stress tolerance by maintaining favourable K(+)/Na(+) ratio and thus showed protection from salinity stress induced ion toxicity
OsIFL|OsIF	tolerance	Evidence for nuclear interaction of a cytoskeleton protein (OsIFL) with metallothionein and its role in salinity stress tolerance.	Overexpression of OsIFL in transgenic tobacco plants conferred salinity stress tolerance by maintaining favourable K(+)/Na(+) ratio and thus showed protection from salinity stress induced ion toxicity
OsIFL|OsIF	abiotic stress	Evidence for nuclear interaction of a cytoskeleton protein (OsIFL) with metallothionein and its role in salinity stress tolerance.	Our investigations clearly establish that the heterologous expression of OsIFL in three diverse organisms (bacteria, yeast and tobacco) provides survival advantage towards diverse abiotic stresses
