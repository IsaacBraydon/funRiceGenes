NA	Mutation of Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase6 Impairs Plant Growth and Phytic Acid Synthesis in Rice.	2019	Plants (Basel)	National Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Institute of Crop Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China. mengjiang@zju.edu.cn.	Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase (ITPK) is encoded by six genes in rice (OsITPK1-6). A previous study had shown that nucleotide substitutions of OsITPK6 could significantly lower the phytic acid content in rice grains. In the present study, the possibility of establishing a genome editing-based method for breeding low-phytic acid cultivars in rice was explored, in conjunction with the functional determination of OsITPK6. Four OsITPK6 mutant lines were generated by targeted mutagenesis of the gene's first exon using the CRISPR/Cas9 method, one (ositpk6_1) with a 6-bp in-frame deletion, and other three with frameshift mutations (ositpk6_2, _3, and _4). The frameshift mutations severely impaired plant growth and reproduction, while the effect of ositpk6_1 was relatively limited. The mutant lines ositpk6_1 and _2 had significantly lower levels (-10.1% and -32.1%) of phytic acid and higher levels (4.12- and 5.18-fold) of inorganic phosphorus compared with the wild-type (WT) line. The line ositpk6_1 also showed less tolerance to osmotic stresses. Our research demonstrates that mutations of OsITPK6, while effectively reducing phytic acid biosynthesis in rice grain, could significantly impair plant growth and reproduction.
