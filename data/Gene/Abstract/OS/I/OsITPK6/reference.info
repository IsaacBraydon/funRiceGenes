NA	Mutation of Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase6 Impairs Plant Growth and Phytic Acid Synthesis in Rice.	2019	Plants (Basel)	National Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Institute of Crop Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China. mengjiang@zju.edu.cn.	Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase (ITPK) is encoded by six genes in rice (OsITPK1-6). A previous study had shown that nucleotide substitutions of OsITPK6 could significantly lower the phytic acid content in rice grains. In the present study, the possibility of establishing a genome editing-based method for breeding low-phytic acid cultivars in rice was explored, in conjunction with the functional determination of OsITPK6. Four OsITPK6 mutant lines were generated by targeted mutagenesis of the gene's first exon using the CRISPR/Cas9 method, one (ositpk6_1) with a 6-bp in-frame deletion, and other three with frameshift mutations (ositpk6_2, _3, and _4). The frameshift mutations severely impaired plant growth and reproduction, while the effect of ositpk6_1 was relatively limited. The mutant lines ositpk6_1 and _2 had significantly lower levels (-10.1% and -32.1%) of phytic acid and higher levels (4.12- and 5.18-fold) of inorganic phosphorus compared with the wild-type (WT) line. The line ositpk6_1 also showed less tolerance to osmotic stresses. Our research demonstrates that mutations of OsITPK6, while effectively reducing phytic acid biosynthesis in rice grain, could significantly impair plant growth and reproduction.
NA	Conserved Imprinted Genes between Intra-Subspecies and Inter-Subspecies Are Involved in Energy Metabolism and Seed Development in Rice	2020	Int J Mol Sci	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon in which a subset of genes express dependent on the origin of their parents. In plants, it is unclear whether imprinted genes are conserved between subspecies in rice. Here we identified imprinted genes from embryo and endosperm 5-7 days after pollination from three pairs of reciprocal hybrids, including inter-subspecies, japonica intra-subspecies, and indica intra-subspecies reciprocal hybrids. A total of 914 imprinted genes, including 546 in inter-subspecies hybrids, 211 in japonica intra-subspecies hybrids, and 286 in indica intra-subspecies hybrids. In general, the number of maternally expressed genes (MEGs) is more than paternally expressed genes (PEGs). Moreover, imprinted genes tend to be in mini clusters. The number of shared genes by R9N (reciprocal crosses between 9311 and Nipponbare) and R9Z (reciprocal crosses between 9311 and Zhenshan 97), R9N and RZN (reciprocal crosses between Zhonghua11 and Nipponbare), R9Z and RZN was 72, 46, and 16. These genes frequently involved in energy metabolism and seed development. Five imprinted genes (Os01g0151700, Os07g0103100, Os10g0340600, Os11g0679700, and Os12g0632800) are commonly detected in all three pairs of reciprocal hybrids and were validated by RT-PCR sequencing. Gene editing of two imprinted genes revealed that both genes conferred grain filling. Moreover, 15 and 27 imprinted genes with diverse functions in rice were shared with Arabidopsis and maize, respectively. This study provided valuable resources for identification of imprinting genes in rice or even in cereals.
