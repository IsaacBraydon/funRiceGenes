OsIQD14	grain	Rice microtubule-associated protein IQ67-DOMAIN14 regulates rice grain shape by modulating microtubule cytoskeleton dynamics.	 Our results indicate that OsIQD14 acts as a key factor in regulating MT rearrangements in rice hull cells and hence the grain shape, and allows effective local cell shape manipulation to improve the rice yield trait
