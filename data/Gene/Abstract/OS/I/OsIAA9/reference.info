NA	Constitutive Expression of OsIAA9 Affects Starch Granules Accumulation and Root Gravitropic Response in Arabidopsis.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of MOE, Northeast Normal University Changchun, China.	Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid (Aux/IAA) genes are early auxin response genes ecoding short-lived transcriptional repressors, which regulate auxin signaling in plants by interplay with Auxin Response Factors (ARFs). Most of the Aux/IAA proteins contain four different domains, namely Domain I, Domain II, Domain III, and Domain IV. So far all Aux/IAA mutants with auxin-related phenotypes identified in both Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa) are dominant gain-of-function mutants with mutations in Domain II of the corresponding Aux/IAA proteins, suggest that Aux/IAA proteins in both Arabidopsis and rice are largely functional redundantly, and they may have conserved functions. We report here the functional characterization of a rice Aux/IAA gene, OsIAA9. RT-PCR results showed that expression of OsIAA9 was induced by exogenously applied auxin, suggesting that OsIAA9 is an auxin response gene. Bioinformatic analysis showed that OsIAA9 has a repressor motif in Domain I, a degron in Domain II, and the conserved amino acid signatures for protein-protein interactions in Domain III and Domain IV. By generating transgenic plants expressing GFP-OsIAA9 and examining florescence in the transgenic plants, we found that OsIAA9 is localized in the nucleus. When transfected into protoplasts isolated from rosette leaves of Arabidopsis, OsIAA9 repressed reporter gene expression, and the repression was partially released by exogenously IAA. These results suggest that OsIAA9 is a canonical Aux/IAA protein. Protoplast transfection assays showed that OsIAA9 interacted ARF5, but not ARF6, 7, 8 and 19. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing OsIAA9 have increased number of lateral roots, and reduced gravitropic response. Further analysis showed that OsIAA9 transgenic Arabidopsis plants accumulated fewer granules in their root tips and the distribution of granules was also affected. Taken together, our study showed that OsIAA9 is a transcriptional repressor, and it regulates gravitropic response when expressed in Arabidopsis by regulating granules accumulation and distribution in root tips.
NA	Comparative transcriptome profile analysis of rice varieties with different tolerance to zinc deficiency	2020	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	CAAS-IRRI Joint Laboratory for Genomics-Assisted Germplasm Enhancement, Agricultural Genomics Institute in Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, China.	Zinc (Zn) is an indispensable element for rice growth. Zn deficiency results in brown blotches and streaks 2-3 weeks after transplanting, as well as stunting, reduced tillering, and low productivity of rice plants. These processes are controlled by different families of expressed genes. A comparative transcriptome profile analysis was conducted using the roots of two Zn deficiency tolerant varieties (UCP122 and KALIBORO26) and two sensitive varieties (IR26 and IR64) by merging data from untreated control (CK) and Zn deficiency treated samples. Results revealed a total of 4,688 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the normal Zn and deficient conditions, with 2,702 and 1,489 unique DEGs upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis identified transcription factors (TFs), such as WRKY, MYB, ERF, and bHLH which are important in the regulation of the Zn deficiency response. Furthermore, chitinases, jasmonic acid, and phenylpropanoid pathways were found to be important in the Zn deficiency response. The metal tolerance protein (MTP) genes also appeared to play an important role in conferring tolerance to Zn deficiency. A heavy metal-associated domain-containing protein 7 was associated with tolerance to Zn deficiency and negatively regulated downstream genes. Collectively, our findings provide valuable expression patterns and candidate genes for the study of molecular mechanisms underlying the response to Zn deficiency and for improvements in breeding for tolerance to Zn deficiency in rice.
NA	Rice EIL1 interacts with OsIAAs to regulate auxin biosynthesis mediated by the tryptophan aminotransferase MHZ10/OsTAR2 during root ethylene responses.	2022	Plant Cell	State Key Lab of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Ethylene plays essential roles in adaptive growth of rice (Oryza sativa). Understanding of the crosstalk between ethylene and auxin (Aux) is limited in rice. Here, from an analysis of the root-specific ethylene-insensitive rice mutant mao hu zi 10 (mhz10), we identified the tryptophan aminotransferase (TAR) MHZ10/OsTAR2, which catalyzes the key step in indole-3-pyruvic acid-dependent Aux biosynthesis. Genetically, OsTAR2 acts downstream of ethylene signaling in root ethylene responses. ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 like1 (OsEIL1) directly activated OsTAR2 expression. Surprisingly, ethylene induction of OsTAR2 expression still required the Aux pathway. We also show that Os indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)1/9 and OsIAA21/31 physically interact with OsEIL1 and show promotive and repressive effects on OsEIL1-activated OsTAR2 promoter activity, respectively. These effects likely depend on their EAR motif-mediated histone acetylation/deacetylation modification. The special promoting activity of OsIAA1/9 on OsEIL1 may require both the EAR motifs and the flanking sequences for recruitment of histone acetyltransferase. The repressors OsIAA21/31 exhibit earlier degradation upon ethylene treatment than the activators OsIAA1/9 in a TIR1/AFB-dependent manner, allowing OsEIL1 activation by activators OsIAA1/9 for OsTAR2 expression and signal amplification. This study reveals a positive feedback regulation of ethylene signaling by Aux biosynthesis and highlights the crosstalk between ethylene and Aux pathways at a previously underappreciated level for root growth regulation in rice.
