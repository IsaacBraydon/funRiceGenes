OsIDD2	 The transient expression assay using rice protoplasts revealed that OsIDD2 negatively regulates the transcription of genes involved in lignin biosynthesis, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 2 and 3 (CAD2 and 3), and sucrose metabolism, sucrose synthase 5 (SUS5), whereas an AlphaScreen assay, which can detect the interaction between TFs and their target DNA sequences, directly confirmed the interaction between OsIDD2 and the target sequences located in the promoter regions of CAD2 and CAD3
