OsIDD2	SLR1|OsGAI	SLENDER RICE1 and Oryza sativa INDETERMINATE DOMAIN2 Regulating OsmiR396 Is Involved in Stem Elongation.	 Rice INDETERMINATE DOMAIN2 (OsIDD2) directly binds the promoter of OsmiR396a and can interact with SLR1 in vivo and in vitro
OsIDD2	SLR1|OsGAI	SLENDER RICE1 and Oryza sativa INDETERMINATE DOMAIN2 Regulating OsmiR396 Is Involved in Stem Elongation.	 The protein levels of OsIDD2 were unaffected by GA in the wild type and OsIDD2OE plants, implying that OSIDD2 promotes the expression of miR396 and likely requires the coactivator of SLR1
