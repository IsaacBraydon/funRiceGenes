NA	Inositolphosphorylceramide synthases, OsIPCSs, regulate plant height in rice.	2023	Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering of Jiangxi Province, School of Life Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China; Research Faculty of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8589, Japan.	Inositolphosphorylceramide synthase (IPCS) catalyses ceramides and phosphatidylinositol (PI) into inositolphosphorylceramide (IPC), which is involved in the regulation of plant growth and development. A total of three OsIPCS family genes have been identified in rice. However, most of their functions remain unknown. Here, the functions of OsIPCSs were analyzed by CRISPR/Cas9 technology, lipidomics analysis, and transcriptomics analysis. Single-gene mutation of OsIPCSs resulted in dwarf phenotype. Among them, the phenotype of osipcs3 mutant was more severe. Multi-gene mutation of OsIPCS genes led to more severe phenotypes, indicating the additive effects of OsIPCSs. We further determined that a significant decrease in epidermal cell elongation of internode in the mutants. There was a significant decrease in the content of IPC detected in the osipcs2/3 and osipcs1/2/3 mutants. The contents of glycosyl inositol phosphoryl ceramide (GIPC) were also decreased by 20% and 10% in osipcs2/3 and osipcs1/2/3, respectively. The results of RNA-seq showed that numerous DEGs found to be associated with cellular component organization, anatomical structure morphogenesis, and cell growth in the osipcs2, osipcs2/3, and osipcs1/2/3. Taken together, OsIPCSs may be involved in the regulation of plant height through affecting cell growth and sphingolipid metabolism in rice.
