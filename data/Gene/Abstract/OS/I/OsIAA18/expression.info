OsIAA18	 A previous study has shown that constitutive expression of OsIAA18, an Aux/IAA transcription factor gene of rice improved salt and osmotic tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants |  In this study, the OsIAA18 gene was introduced into the rice cultivar, Zhonghua 11 and the OsIAA18 overexpression in rice plants exhibited significantly enhanced salt and drought tolerance compared to the wild type (WT) |  Moreover, overexpression of OsIAA18 in rice increased endogenous levels of abscisic acid (ABA) and the overexpression of OsIAA18 in rice plants showed hypersensitivity to exogenous ABA treatment at both the germination and postgermination stages compared to WT |  Overexpression of OsIAA18 upregulated the genes involved in ABA biosynthesis and signaling pathways, proline biosynthesis pathway, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging system in the overexpression of OsIAA18 in rice plants under salt and drought stresses	 In this study, the OsIAA18 gene was introduced into the rice cultivar, Zhonghua 11 and the OsIAA18 overexpression in rice plants exhibited significantly enhanced salt and drought tolerance compared to the wild type (WT) |  Moreover, overexpression of OsIAA18 in rice increased endogenous levels of abscisic acid (ABA) and the overexpression of OsIAA18 in rice plants showed hypersensitivity to exogenous ABA treatment at both the germination and postgermination stages compared to WT |  Overexpression of OsIAA18 upregulated the genes involved in ABA biosynthesis and signaling pathways, proline biosynthesis pathway, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging system in the overexpression of OsIAA18 in rice plants under salt and drought stresses
