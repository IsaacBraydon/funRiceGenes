NA	Characterisation of a rice vacuolar invertase isoform, OsINV2, for growth and yield-related traits.	2019	Funct Plant Biol	Fail	OsINV2, a rice vacuolar invertase isoform, was assessed for its functional roles in plant growth and development with key focus on its agronomic traits such as grain weight, grain filling percentage, grain number and dry weights at various stages until harvest. Lack of differences between the wild-type and the mutants with respect to any of the aforementioned traits tested revealed a possibility of functional compensation of OsINV2 in the mutants conceivably by its isoform. This was confirmed by OsINV2 promoter::GUS studies, where its spatial and temporal expression in the panicle elongation stages showed that although OsINV2 expression was observed from the stage with young panicles ~1 cm in length to the flag leaf stage, significant differences with respect to panicle and spikelet phenotypes between the wild-type and the mutant were not present. However, complement lines displaying an overexpression phenotype of OsINV2 possessed a higher stem non-structural carbohydrate content under both monoculm and normal tillering conditions. A trade-off between the spikelet number and grain weight in the complement lines grown under monoculm conditions was also observed, pointing towards the necessity of OsINV2 regulation for grain yield-related traits.
NA	OsINV3 and Its Homolog, OsINV2, Control Grain Size in Rice.	2020	Int J Mol Sci	Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.	Vacuolar invertase is involved in sugar metabolism and plays a crucial role in plant growth and development, thus regulating seed size. However, information linking vacuolar invertase and seed size in rice is limited. Here we characterized a small grain mutant sg2 (grain size on chromosome 2) that showed a reduced in grain size and 1000-grain weight compared to the wild type. Map-based cloning and genetic complementation showed that OsINV3 is responsible for the observed phenotype. Loss-of-function of OsINV3 resulted in grains of smaller size when compared to the wild type, while overexpression showed increased grain size. We also obtained a T-DNA insertion mutant of OsINV2, which is a homolog of OsINV3 and generated double knockout (KO) mutants of OsINV2 and OsINV3 using CRISPR/Cas9. Genetic data showed that OsINV2, that has no effect on grain size by itself, reduces grain length and width in the absence of OsINV3. Altered sugar content with increased sucrose and decreased hexose levels, as well as changes vacuolar invertase activities and starch constitution in INV3KO, INV2KO, INV3KOINV2KO mutants indicate that OsINV2 and OsINV3 affect sucrose metabolism in sink organs. In summary, we identified OsINV3 as a positive regulator of grain size in rice, and while OsINV2 has no function on grain size by itself. In the absence of OsINV3, it is possible to detect a role of OsINV2 in the regulation of grain size. Both OsINV3 and OsINV2 are involved in sucrose metabolism, and thus regulate grain size. Our findings increase our understanding of the role of OsINV3 and its homolog, OsINV2, in grain size development and also suggest a potential strategy to improve grain yield in rice.
