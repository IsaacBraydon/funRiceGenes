NA	Characterisation of a rice vacuolar invertase isoform, OsINV2, for growth and yield-related traits.	2019	Funct Plant Biol	Fail	OsINV2, a rice vacuolar invertase isoform, was assessed for its functional roles in plant growth and development with key focus on its agronomic traits such as grain weight, grain filling percentage, grain number and dry weights at various stages until harvest. Lack of differences between the wild-type and the mutants with respect to any of the aforementioned traits tested revealed a possibility of functional compensation of OsINV2 in the mutants conceivably by its isoform. This was confirmed by OsINV2 promoter::GUS studies, where its spatial and temporal expression in the panicle elongation stages showed that although OsINV2 expression was observed from the stage with young panicles ~1 cm in length to the flag leaf stage, significant differences with respect to panicle and spikelet phenotypes between the wild-type and the mutant were not present. However, complement lines displaying an overexpression phenotype of OsINV2 possessed a higher stem non-structural carbohydrate content under both monoculm and normal tillering conditions. A trade-off between the spikelet number and grain weight in the complement lines grown under monoculm conditions was also observed, pointing towards the necessity of OsINV2 regulation for grain yield-related traits.
