OSIPA	OSIPK	Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems	Differential screening of a stage-specific cDNA library of Indica rice has been used to identify two genes expressed in pre-pollination stage panicles, namely OSIPA and OSIPK coding for proteins similar to expansins/pollen allergens and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK), respectively
OSIPA	OSIPK	Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems	 Northern analysis and in situ hybridizations indicate that OSIPA expresses exclusively in pollen while OSIPK expresses in pollen as well as anther wall
OSIPA	OSIPK	Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems	 Promoter of OSIPA is active during the late stages of pollen development and remains active till the anthesis, whereas, OSIPK promoter is active to a low level in developing anther till the pollen matures
