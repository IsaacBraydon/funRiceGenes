OSIPA	sterile	Pollen-specific expression of Oryza sativa indica pollen allergen gene (OSIPA) promoter in rice and Arabidopsis transgenic systems	 As such, the OSIPA promoter seems promising for generation of stable male-sterile lines required for the production of hybrids in rice and other crop plants
OSIPA	pollen	Pollen-specific expression of Oryza sativa indica pollen allergen gene (OSIPA) promoter in rice and Arabidopsis transgenic systems	Earlier, a pollen-specific Oryza sativa indica pollen allergen gene (OSIPA), coding for expansins/pollen allergens, was isolated from rice, and its promoter--upon expression in tobacco and Arabidopsis--was found active during the late stages of pollen development|Pollen-specific expression of Oryza sativa indica pollen allergen gene (OSIPA) promoter in rice and Arabidopsis transgenic systems
OSIPA	panicle	Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems	Differential screening of a stage-specific cDNA library of Indica rice has been used to identify two genes expressed in pre-pollination stage panicles, namely OSIPA and OSIPK coding for proteins similar to expansins/pollen allergens and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK), respectively
OSIPA	pollen	Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems	Differential screening of a stage-specific cDNA library of Indica rice has been used to identify two genes expressed in pre-pollination stage panicles, namely OSIPA and OSIPK coding for proteins similar to expansins/pollen allergens and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK), respectively| Northern analysis and in situ hybridizations indicate that OSIPA expresses exclusively in pollen while OSIPK expresses in pollen as well as anther wall| Promoter of OSIPA is active during the late stages of pollen development and remains active till the anthesis, whereas, OSIPK promoter is active to a low level in developing anther till the pollen matures
OSIPA	anther	Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems	 Northern analysis and in situ hybridizations indicate that OSIPA expresses exclusively in pollen while OSIPK expresses in pollen as well as anther wall| Promoter of OSIPA is active during the late stages of pollen development and remains active till the anthesis, whereas, OSIPK promoter is active to a low level in developing anther till the pollen matures
