Earlier, a pollen-specific Oryza sativa indica pollen allergen gene (OSIPA), coding for expansins/pollen allergens, was isolated from rice, and its promoter--upon expression in tobacco and Arabidopsis--was found active during the late stages of pollen development. In this investigation, to analyze the effects of different putative regulatory motifs of OSIPA promoter, a series of 5' deletions were fused to beta-glucuronidase gene (GUS) which were stably introduced into rice and Arabidopsis. Histochemical GUS analysis of the transgenic plants revealed that a 1631 bp promoter fragment mediates maximum GUS expression at different stages of anther/pollen development. Promoter deletions to -1272, -966, -617, and -199 bp did not change the expression profile of the pollen specificity. However, the activity of promoter was reduced as the length of promoter decreased. The region between -1567 and -199 bp was found adequate to confer pollen-specific expression in both rice and Arabidopsis systems. An approximate 4-fold increase in the GUS activity was observed in the pollen of rice when compared to that of Arabidopsis. As such, the OSIPA promoter seems promising for generation of stable male-sterile lines required for the production of hybrids in rice and other crop plants.

Differential screening of a stage-specific cDNA library of Indica rice has been used to identify two genes expressed in pre-pollination stage panicles, namely OSIPA and OSIPK coding for proteins similar to expansins/pollen allergens and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK), respectively. Northern analysis and in situ hybridizations indicate that OSIPA expresses exclusively in pollen while OSIPK expresses in pollen as well as anther wall. Promoters of these two anther-specific genes show the presence of various cis-acting elements (GTGA and AGAAA) known to confer anther/pollen-specific gene expression. Organ/tissue-specific activity and strength of their regulatory regions have been determined in transgenic systems, i.e., tobacco and Arabidopsis. A unique temporal activity of these two promoters was observed during various developmental stages of anther/pollen. Promoter of OSIPA is active during the late stages of pollen development and remains active till the anthesis, whereas, OSIPK promoter is active to a low level in developing anther till the pollen matures. OSIPK promoter activity diminishes before anthesis. Both promoters show a potential to target expression of the gene of interest in developmental stage-specific manner and can help engineer pollen-specific traits like male-sterility in plants.
