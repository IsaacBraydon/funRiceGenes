18626399.pdf	A rice isoflavone reductase-like gene, OsIRL, is induced by rice blast fungal elicitor	2003	Mol Cells	Division of Applied Life Science (Brain Korea 21 Program), Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Research Center, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 660-701, Korea.	We have isolated and characterized a rice isoflavone reductase-like gene, OsIRL, whose expression is induced by a fungal elicitor. The OsIRL cDNA contains 1203 bp with an open reading frame of 942 nucleotides encoding 314 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of OsIRL has a putative pyridine nucleotide binding domain and is 68% homologous with the maize isoflavone reductase-like gene. Southern blot analysis revealed that OsIRL belongs to a small multigene family. Expression of OsIRL was induced by treatment with a fungal elicitor and jasmonic acid as well as by inoculation with rice blast fungus. Cycloheximide (1 muM), strongly inhibited the induction of OsIRL by the fungal elicitor, indicating that new protein synthesis is required. The protein kinase inhibitor, staurosporine (1 muM), had little effect, but the phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A (1 muM), strongly inhibited induction. Treatment with salicylic acid (SA, 5 mM) strongly inhibited expression of OsIRL in response to fungal elicitor and JA, while abscisic acid (ABA, 200 muM) also strongly antagonized OsIRL induction by JA, but had only a weak effect on induction by the fungal elicitor. These results suggest that the expression of OsIRL is positively regulated by phytohormones such as JA, and negatively by phytohormones such as SA, ABA.

Isoflavone reductase is an enzyme involved in isoflavonoid biosynthesis in plants. However, rice isoflavone reductase-like gene (OsIRL, accession no. AY071920) has not been unraveled so far. Here, we have characterized its behavior in response to oxidizing agents. Using Northern and Western blot analyses, the OsIRL gene and protein were shown to be down-regulated in young seedling roots treated with reduced glutathione (GSH) and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), known quenchers of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The OsIRL transcript level in rice suspension-cultured cells was also found to be induced by oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), ferric chloride (FeCl(3)), methyl viologen (MV) and glucose/glucose oxidase (G/GO), but down-regulated when co-treated with GSH. Furthermore, to investigate whether overexpression of OsIRL in transgenic rice plants promotes resistance to ROS, we generated transgenic rice lines overexpressing the OsIRL gene under an abscisic acid (ABA) inducible promoter. Results showed that the OsIRL transgenic rice line activated by ABA treatment was tolerant against MV and G/GO-induced stress in rice leave and suspension-cultured cells. Our results strongly suggest the involvement of OsIRL in homeostasis of ROS.
