Ann Bot-2011-Yang-1087-101.pdf	Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development	2011	Ann Bot	Institute of Crop Science, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Kaixuan Road 268, Hangzhou, China.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Plants have a family of proteins referred to as ICKs (inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK) or KRPs (Kip-related proteins) that function to regulate the activities of CDK. Knowledge of these plant CDK inhibitors has been gained mostly from studies of selected members in dicotyledonous plants, particularly Arabidopsis. Much remains to be learned regarding the differences among various members of the ICK/KRP family, and regarding the function and regulation of these proteins in monocotyledonous plants. METHODS: We analysed ICK-related sequences in the rice (Orysa sativa L. subsp. indica) genome and determined that there are six members with the conserved C-terminal signature region for ICK/KRP proteins. They are referred to as OsiICKs and further analyses were performed. The interactions with CDKs and cyclins were determined by a yeast two-hybrid assay, and cellular localization by fusion with the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). The expression of OsiICK6 in different tissues and in response to several treatments was analysed by reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR. Furthermore, OsiICK6 was over-expressed in transgenic rice plants and significant phenotypes were observed. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Based on putative protein sequences, the six OsiICKs are grouped into two classes, with OsiICK1 and OsiICK6 in each of the two classes, respectively. Results showed that OsiICK1 and OsiICK6 interacted with OsCYCD, but differed in their interactions with CDKA. Both EGFP:OsiICK1 and EGFP:OsiICK6 were localized in the nucleus. Whereas EGFP:OsiICK6 showed a punctuate subnuclear distribution, OsiICK1 had a homogeneous pattern. Over-expression of OsiICK6 resulted in multiple phenotypic effects on plant growth, morphology, pollen viability and seed setting. In OsiICK6-over-expressing plants, leaves rolled toward the abaxial side, suggesting that cell proliferation is critical in maintaining an even growth along the dorsal-ventral plane of leaf blades.
NA	The roles of a novel CDKB/KRP/FB3 cell cycle core complex in rice gametes and initiation of embryogenesis.	2023	Plant Reprod	Department of Microbiology and Plant Biology, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, 73019, USA. hxu28@unl.edu.	The cell cycle controls division and proliferation of all eukaryotic cells and is tightly regulated at multiple checkpoints by complexes of core cell cycle proteins. Due to the difficulty in accessing female gametes and zygotes of flowering plants, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying embryogenesis initiation despite the crucial importance of this process for seed crops. In this study, we reveal three levels of factors involved in rice zygotic cell cycle control and characterize their functions and regulation. Protein-protein interaction studies, including within zygote cells, and in vitro biochemical analyses delineate a model of the zygotic cell cycle core complex for rice. In this model, CDKB1, a major regulator of plant mitosis, is a cyclin (CYCD5)-dependent kinase; its activity is coordinately inhibited by two cell cycle inhibitors, KRP4 and KRP5; and both KRPs are regulated via F-box protein 3 (FB3)-mediated proteolysis. Supporting their critical roles in controlling the rice zygotic cell cycle, mutations in KRP4, KRP5 and FB3 result in the compromised function of sperm cells and abnormal organization of female germ units, embryo and endosperm, thus significantly reducing seed-set rate. This work helps reveal regulatory mechanisms controlling the zygotic cell cycle toward seed formation in angiosperms.
