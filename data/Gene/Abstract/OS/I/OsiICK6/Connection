OsiICK1	OsiICK6|KRP4	Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development	KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Based on putative protein sequences, the six OsiICKs are grouped into two classes, with OsiICK1 and OsiICK6 in each of the two classes, respectively
OsiICK1	OsiICK6|KRP4	Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development	Results showed that OsiICK1 and OsiICK6 interacted with OsCYCD, but differed in their interactions with CDKA
OsiICK1	OsiICK6|KRP4	Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development	Both EGFP:OsiICK1 and EGFP:OsiICK6 were localized in the nucleus
OsiICK1	OsiICK6|KRP4	Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development	Whereas EGFP:OsiICK6 showed a punctuate subnuclear distribution, OsiICK1 had a homogeneous pattern
