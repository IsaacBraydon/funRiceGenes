OsiICK1	OsiICK6	Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development	 KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Based on putative protein sequences, the six OsiICKs are grouped into two classes, with OsiICK1 and OsiICK6 in each of the two classes, respectively| Results showed that OsiICK1 and OsiICK6 interacted with OsCYCD, but differed in their interactions with CDKA| Both EGFP:OsiICK1 and EGFP:OsiICK6 were localized in the nucleus| Whereas EGFP:OsiICK6 showed a punctuate subnuclear distribution, OsiICK1 had a homogeneous pattern
