The present study established that there are two distinct polymeric forms of isoamylase1 (ISA1) in rice endosperm: presumably a homo-pentamer of ISA1 and a hetero-hexamer composed of five ISA1 and one ISA2. The molecular sizes of the homo- and hetero-oligomers, which could be fractionated by hydrophobic chromatography, were approximately 420-480 and 510-550 kDa, respectively. The hetero-oligomer exhibited higher affinities for various branched polyglucans, especially for phytoglycogen, which had a K(m) value that was approximately 12 times lower relative to that with the homo-oligomer, although no marked differences were found in chain preferences for debranching of amylopectin and phytoglycogen between these forms. The hetero-oligomer was active even when incubated at 50 degrees C for 10 min, while the homo-multimer was completely inactivated at 40 degrees C in 10 min. When the ISA1 homo-oligomer was incubated with the ISA2 protein expressed in Escherichia coli and applied onto a nondenature polyacrylamide gel, additional debranching activity bands which were specific for the purified ISA1-ISA2 preparation were also detected, indicating that ISA1 and ISA2 combine to form a hetero-oligomer. These results suggest that the hetero-oligomer plays a predominant role in the amylopectin biosynthesis in rice endosperm although the homo-oligomer can complement the function of the hetero-oligomer at least to some extent.

Starch composition and the amount in endosperm, both of which contribute dramatically to seed yield, cooking quality, and taste in cereals, are determined by a series of complex biochemical reactions. However, the mechanism regulating starch biosynthesis in cereal seeds is not well understood. This study showed that OsbZIP58, a bZIP transcription factor, is a key transcriptional regulator controlling starch synthesis in rice endosperm. OsbZIP58 was expressed mainly in endosperm during active starch synthesis. osbzip58 null mutants displayed abnormal seed morphology with altered starch accumulation in the white belly region and decreased amounts of total starch and amylose. Moreover, osbzip58 had a higher proportion of short chains and a lower proportion of intermediate chains of amylopectin. Furthermore, OsbZIP58 was shown to bind directly to the promoters of six starch-synthesizing genes, OsAGPL3, Wx, OsSSIIa, SBE1, OsBEIIb, and ISA2, and to regulate their expression. These findings indicate that OsbZIP58 functions as a key regulator of starch synthesis in rice seeds and provide new insights into seed quality control.
