CYCLOPS|OsIPD3|OsCYCLOPS	OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation	We observed colocalization and physical interaction between CCaMK and CYCLOPS in plant and yeast cell nuclei in the absence of symbiotic stimulation
CYCLOPS|OsIPD3|OsCYCLOPS	OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation	Importantly, CYCLOPS is a phosphorylation substrate of CCaMK in vitro
CYCLOPS|OsIPD3|OsCYCLOPS	OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation	Our results suggest that CYCLOPS forms an ancient, preassembled signal transduction complex with CCaMK that is specifically required for infection, whereas organogenesis likely requires additional yet-to-be identified CCaMK interactors or substrates
CYCLOPS|OsIPD3|OsCYCLOPS	OsRAM2	Colonization of mutualistic mycorrhizal and parasitic blast fungi requires OsRAM2-regulated fatty acid biosynthesis in rice.	 The induction of OsRAM2 and OsRAM2L is dependent on OsRAM1 and the CSSP pathway genes CCaMK and CYCLOPS, while overexpression of OsRAM1 results in increased expression of OsRAM2 and OsRAM2L
