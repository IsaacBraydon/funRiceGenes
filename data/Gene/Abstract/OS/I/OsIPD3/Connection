CYCLOPS|OsIPD3	OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation	We observed colocalization and physical interaction between CCaMK and CYCLOPS in plant and yeast cell nuclei in the absence of symbiotic stimulation
CYCLOPS|OsIPD3	OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation	Importantly, CYCLOPS is a phosphorylation substrate of CCaMK in vitro
CYCLOPS|OsIPD3	OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation	Our results suggest that CYCLOPS forms an ancient, preassembled signal transduction complex with CCaMK that is specifically required for infection, whereas organogenesis likely requires additional yet-to-be identified CCaMK interactors or substrates
