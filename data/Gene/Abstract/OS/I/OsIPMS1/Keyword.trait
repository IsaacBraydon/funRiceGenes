OsIPMS1	seed	Influence of isopropylmalate synthase OsIPMS1 on seed vigor associated with amino acid and energy metabolism in rice.	 In this study, rice OsIPMS1 and OsIPMS2 was cloned, and the roles of OsIPMS1 in seed vigor were mainly investigated
OsIPMS1	seed	Influence of isopropylmalate synthase OsIPMS1 on seed vigor associated with amino acid and energy metabolism in rice.	 Disruption of OsIPMS1 resulted in low seed vigor under various conditions, which might be tightly associated with the reduction of amino acids in germinating seeds
OsIPMS1	seed	Influence of isopropylmalate synthase OsIPMS1 on seed vigor associated with amino acid and energy metabolism in rice.	 Eleven amino acids that associated with stress tolerance, GA biosynthesis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were significantly reduced in osipms1 mutants compared with those in wide type (WT) during seed germination
OsIPMS1	seed	Influence of isopropylmalate synthase OsIPMS1 on seed vigor associated with amino acid and energy metabolism in rice.	 Further analysis confirmed that the regulation of OsIPMS1 in seed vigor involved in starch hydrolysis, glycolytic activity and energy levels in germinating seeds
OsIPMS1	seed	Influence of isopropylmalate synthase OsIPMS1 on seed vigor associated with amino acid and energy metabolism in rice.	 The effects of seed priming were tightly associated with the mRNA levels of OsIPMS1 in priming seeds
OsIPMS1	seed	Influence of isopropylmalate synthase OsIPMS1 on seed vigor associated with amino acid and energy metabolism in rice.	 The OsIPMS1 might be used as a biomarker to determine the best stop time-point of seed priming in rice
