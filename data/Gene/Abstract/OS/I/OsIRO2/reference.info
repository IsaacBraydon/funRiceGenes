2011-26.pdf	Ethylene is involved in the regulation of iron homeostasis by regulating the expression of iron-acquisition-related genes in Oryza sativa	2011	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, PR China.	Plants employ two distinct strategies to obtain iron (Fe) from the soil. In Strategy I but not Strategy II plants, Fe limitation invokes ethylene production which regulates Fe deficiency responses. Oryza sativa (rice) is the only graminaceous plant described that possesses a Strategy I-like system for iron uptake as well as the classic Strategy II system. Ethylene production of rice roots was significantly increased when grown under Fe-depleted conditions. Moreover, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) treatment, a precursor of ethylene, conferred tolerance to Fe deficiency in rice by increasing internal Fe availability. Gene expression analysis of rice iron-regulated bHLH transcription factor OsIRO2, nicotianamine synthases 1 and 2 (NAS1 and NAS2), yellow-stripe like transporter 15 (YSL15) and iron-regulated transporter (IRT1) indicated that ethylene caused an increase in transcript abundance of both Fe (II) and Fe (III)-phytosiderophore uptake systems. RNA interference of OsIRO2 in transgenic rice showed that ethylene acted via this transcription factor to induce the expression of OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsYSL15, and OsIRT1. By contrast, in Hordeum vulgare L. (barley), no ethylene production or ethylene-mediated effects of Fe response could be detected. In conclusion, Fe-limiting conditions increased ethylene production and signalling in rice, which is novel in Strategy II plant species.

Bot.-2006-Ogo-2867-78.pdf	Isolation and characterization of IRO2, a novel iron-regulated bHLH transcription factor in graminaceous plants	2006	J Exp Bot	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	To clarify the molecular mechanism that regulates iron (Fe) acquisition in graminaceous plants, a time-course analysis of gene expression during Fe deficiency stress was conducted using a rice 22K oligo-DNA microarray. Twenty-one genes for proteins that function in gene regulation were induced by Fe deficiency. Of these genes, a putative basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor gene, named OsIRO2, was strongly expressed in both roots and shoots during Fe deficiency stress. The expression of OsIRO2 was induced exclusively by Fe deficiency, and not by deficiencies in other metals. Expression of the barley HvIRO2 gene, which is a homologue of OsIRO2, was also induced by Fe deficiency. An in silico search revealed that IRO2 is highly conserved among graminaceous plants, which include wheat, sorghum, and maize. The cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CASTing) technique revealed that OsIRO2 bound preferentially to the sequence 5'-ACCACGTGGTTTT-3', and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed 5'-CACGTGG-3' as the core sequence for OsIRO2 binding. Sequences similar to the OsIRO2-binding sequence were found upstream of several genes that are involved in Fe acquisition, such as OsNAS1, OsNAS3, OsIRT1, OsFDH, OsAPT1, and IDS3. The core sequence of the OsIRO2-binding sequence occurred more frequently in the upstream regions of Fe deficiency-inducible genes than in the corresponding regions of non-inducible genes. These results suggest that IRO2 is involved in the regulation of gene expression under Fe-deficient conditions.
J. Exp. Bot.-2013-Yang-5009-20.pdf	A receptor-like protein RMC is involved in regulation of iron acquisition in rice	2013	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, PR China.	Iron (Fe) is one of the essential mineral elements for plant growth and development. Acquisition of Fe by plants is mediated by a complex network involving Fe mobilization, uptake by root cells, and transport within plants. Here, we evaluated the role of a previously clarified gene encoding a receptor-like protein from rice, OsRMC, in the regulation of Fe acquisition by comparing Fe concentration, biomass, and expression patterns of genes associated with Fe mobilization and transport in wild-type (WT) rice with those in OsRMC overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown transgenic rice plants. Expression of OsRMC was upregulated in both shoots and roots upon exposure of WT to Fe-deficient medium. Expression levels of OsRMC were positively correlated with Fe concentration in rice plants under both Fe-sufficient and Fe-deficient conditions such that overexpression and RNAi lines had higher and lower Fe concentration in both roots and shoots than WT plants, respectively. Moreover, overexpression of OsRMC conferred greater accumulation of Fe in mature seeds under Fe-sufficient conditions. OsRMC may also play a role in regulation of Fe deficiency-induced changes in root growth, as evidenced by greater and smaller root systems of OsRMC overexpression lines and RNAi lines than WT under Fe-deficient conditions, respectively. Several Fe deficiency-responsive genes including OsDMAS1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAAT1, OsIRT1, OsYSL15, and OsIRO2 were up- and downregulated in OsRMC-overexpressing and RNAi plants compared with WT rice plants. These novel findings highlight an important role of OsRMC played in mediation of Fe acquisition and root growth in rice, particularly under Fe-deficient conditions.

Iron (Fe) deficiency is a major abiotic stress in crop production. Although responses to Fe deficiency in graminaceous plants, such as increased production and secretion of mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs), have been described, the gene regulation mechanisms related to these responses are largely unknown. To elucidate the regulation mechanisms of the genes related to Fe acquisition in graminaceous plants, we characterized the Fe-deficiency-inducible basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor OsIRO2 in rice. In yeast cells, OsIRO2 functioned as a transcriptional activator. In rice, overexpression of OsIRO2 resulted in increased MAs secretion, whereas repression of OsIRO2 resulted in lower MAs secretion and hypersensitivity to Fe deficiency. Northern blots revealed that the expression of the genes involved in the Fe(III)-MAs transport system was dependent on OsIRO2. The expression of the genes for nicotianamine synthase, a key enzyme in MAs synthesis, was notably affected by the level of OsIRO2 expression. Microarray analysis demonstrated that OsIRO2 regulates 59 Fe-deficiency-induced genes in roots. Some of these genes, including two transcription factors upregulated by Fe deficiency, possessed the OsIRO2 binding sequence in their upstream regions. OsIRO2 possesses a homologous sequence of the Fe-deficiency-responsive cis-acting elements (IDEs) in its upstream region. We propose a novel gene regulation network for Fe-deficiency responses, including OsIRO2, IDEs and the two transcription factors.
j.1365-313X.2009.04015.x.pdf	The rice transcription factor IDEF1 is essential for the early response to iron deficiency, and induces vegetative expression of late embryogenesis abundant genes	2009	Plant J	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Higher plants maintain iron homeostasis by regulating the expression of iron (Fe)-related genes in accordance with Fe availability. The transcription factor IDEF1 regulates the response to Fe deficiency in Oryza sativa (rice) by recognizing CATGC sequences within the Fe deficiency-responsive cis-acting element IDE1. To investigate the function of IDEF1 in detail, we analyzed the response to Fe deficiency in transgenic rice plants exhibiting induced or repressed IDEF1 expression. Fe-deficiency treatment in hydroponic culture revealed that IDEF1 knock-down plants are susceptible to early-stage Fe deficiency, in contrast to IDEF1-induced plants. Time-course expression analyses using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR revealed that the IDEF1 expression level was positively correlated with the level of induction of the Fe utilization-related genes OsIRO2, OsYSL15, OsIRT1, OsYSL2, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAS3 and OsDMAS1, just after the onset of Fe starvation. However, this overall transactivation mediated by IDEF1 became less evident in subsequent stages. Microarray and in-silico analyses revealed that genes positively regulated by IDEF1, especially at the early stage, exhibit over-representation of CATGC and IDE1-like elements within the proximal promoter regions. These results indicate the existence of early and subsequent responses to Fe deficiency, with the former requiring IDEF1 more specifically. Proximal regions of IDEF1-regulated gene promoters also showed enrichment of RY elements (CATGCA), which regulate gene expression during seed maturation. The expression of several genes encoding late embryogenesis abundant proteins, including Osem, was induced in Fe-deficient roots and/or leaves in an IDEF1-dependent manner, suggesting a possible function of seed maturation-related genes in Fe-deficient vegetative organs.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs11103-011-9752-6.pdf	OsIRO2 is responsible for iron utilization in rice and improves growth and yield in calcareous soil	2011	Plant Mol Biol	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.	Iron (Fe) deficiency, a worldwide agricultural problem on calcareous soil with low Fe availability, is also a major human nutritional deficit. Plants induce Fe acquisition systems under conditions of low Fe availability. Previously, we reported that an Fe-deficiency-inducible basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, OsIRO2, is responsible for regulation of the genes involved in Fe homeostasis in rice. Using promoter-GUS transformants, we showed that OsIRO2 is expressed throughout a plant's lifetime in a spatially and temporally similar manner to the genes OsNAS1, OsNAS2 and TOM1, which is involved in Fe absorption and translocation. During germination, OsIRO2 expression was detected in embryos. OsIRO2 expression in vegetative tissues was restricted almost exclusively to vascular bundles of roots and leaves, and to the root exodermis under Fe-sufficient conditions, and expanded to all tissues of roots and leaves in response to Fe deficiency. OsIRO2 expression was also detected in flowers and developing seeds. Plants overexpressing OsIRO2 grew better, and OsIRO2-repressed plants showed poor growth compared to non-transformant rice after germination. OsIRO2 overexpression also resulted in improved tolerance to low Fe availability in calcareous soil. In addition to increased Fe content in shoots, the overexpression plants accumulated higher amounts of Fe in seeds than non-transformants when grown on calcareous soil. These results suggest that OsIRO2 is synchronously expressed with genes involved in Fe homeostasis, and performs a crucial function in regulation not only of Fe uptake from soil but also Fe transport during germination and Fe translocation to grain during seed maturation.
NA	A transcription factor OsbHLH156 regulates Strategy II iron acquisition through localizing IRO2 to the nucleus in rice.	2019	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310058, P. R. China.	Plants have evolved two strategies to acquire ferrous (Strategy I) or ferric (Strategy II) iron from soil. The Iron-related bHLH transcription factor 2 (IRO2) has been identified as a key regulator of iron acquisition (Strategy II) in rice. However, its mode of action, sub-cellular localization and binding partners are not clearly defined. Using RNA-seq analyses, we identified a novel bHLH-type transcription factor, OsbHLH156. The function of OsbHLH156 in Fe homeostasis was analyzed by characterization of the phenotypes, elemental content, transcriptome, interaction and subcellular localization of OsbHLH156 and IRO2. OsbHLH156 is primarily expressed in the roots and transcript abundance is greatly increased by Fe deficiency. Loss function of OsbHLH156 resulted in Fe-deficiency-induced chlorosis and reduced Fe concentration in the shoots under upland or Fe(III) supplied conditions. Transcriptome analyses revealed that the expression of most Fe-deficiency-responsive genes involved in Strategy II were not induced in osbhlh156-1 mutant. Furthermore, OsbHLH156 was required for nuclear localization of IRO2. We conclude that OsbHLH156 is required for a Strategy II uptake mechanism in rice, partnering with a previously identified 'master' regulator IRO2. Mechanistically it is required for the nuclear localization of IRO2.
NA	Enhancement of Iron Acquisition in Rice by the Mugineic Acid Synthase Gene With Ferric Iron Reductase Gene and OsIRO2 Confers Tolerance in Submerged and Nonsubmerged Calcareous Soils.	2019	Front Plant Sci	Research Institute for Bioresources and Biotechnology, Ishikawa Prefectural University, Ishikawa, Japan.	Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for plants. Plants encounter Fe deficiency when grown in calcareous soil with low Fe availability, leading to reduced crop yield and agricultural problem. Rice acquires Fe from the soil via Strategy I-related system (ferrous ion uptake by OsIRT1) and Strategy II system (ferric ion uptake by chelation). However, rice plants have a weak ability in Fe(III) reduction and phytosiderophore secretion. We previously produced an Fe deficiency-tolerant rice harboring OsIRT1 promoter-refre1/372 (for higher Fe(III) reductase ability) and a 35S promoter-OsIRO2 (for higher phytosiderophore secretion). In this study, we produced a new Fe deficiency-tolerant rice by the additional introduction of a barley IDS3 genome fragment with refre1/372 and OsIRO2 (named as IRI lines) for further enhancement in Strategy II phytosiderophore productivity and better growth performance in various environments. Our results show that an enhanced tolerance was observed in OsIRO2 introduced line at the early growth stage, refre1/372 introduced line in the late stage, and RI line in all stages among five types of cultivation method. Moreover, we demonstrated that new IRI rice lines exhibited enhanced tolerance to Fe deficiency compared to nontransgenic (NT) rice and rice lines harboring the overexpressing OsIRO2 or the IDS3 fragment under submerged calcareous soil. The yields of IRI lines were ninefold higher than the NT line. Furthermore, under Fe-limited nonsubmerged calcareous soil condition (a new cultivation condition), IRI lines also conferred enhanced tolerance than NT, lines introducing only the OsIRT1 promoter-refre1/372 or overexpressing OsIRO2, and lines harboring both. Our results demonstrate that further enhancement of the Strategy II Fe uptake system by the mugineic acid synthase gene in addition to Fe uptake by enhanced ferric Fe reduction and phytosiderophore production in rice contributes Fe deficiency tolerance and broaden its utility in calcareous soil cultivation under paddy or nonpaddy field conditions.
NA	OsIRO3 negatively regulates Fe homeostasis by repressing the expression of OsIRO2.	2022	Plant J	CAS Key Laboratory of Tropical Plant Resources and Sustainable Use, The Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, 650223, China.	Iron (Fe) is crucial for crop productivity and quality. However, Fe deficiency is prevalent worldwide, particularly in alkaline soil. Plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to withstand Fe-deficient conditions. Oryza sativa IRON-RELATED BHLH TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 3 (OsIRO3/OsbHLH63) has been identified as a negative regulator of Fe deficiency response signaling; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we constructed two iro3 mutants, which developed leaves with necrotic lesions under Fe-deficient conditions. Loss-of-function of OsIRO3 caused upregulation of Fe deficiency-associated genes in the root. Fe concentration measurements showed that the iro3 mutants had increased shoot Fe concentration only under Fe-deficient conditions. Further analysis revealed that OsIRO3 directly regulated the expression of IRON-RELATED BHLH TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2 (OsIRO2), which encodes a positive regulator of the Fe uptake system. Further investigation demonstrated that OsIRO3 interacted with POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1(OsPRI1) and OsPRI2, and. OsIRO3 repressed their transcription activation towards OsIRO2. OsIRO3 contains an EAR motif, which recruits the TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED (OsTPL/OsTPRs) corepressors. Mutation of the EAR motif attenuated the repression ability of OsIRO3. This work sheds light on the molecular mechanism by which OsIRO3 modulates Fe homeostasis in rice.
