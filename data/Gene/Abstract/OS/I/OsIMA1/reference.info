NA	Iron deficiency-inducible peptide-coding genes OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 positively regulate a major pathway of iron uptake and translocation in rice.	2020	J Exp Bot	Research Institute for Bioresources and Biotechnology, Ishikawa Prefectural University, Suematsu, Nonoichi, Ishikawa, Japan.	Under low iron (Fe) availability, plants transcriptionally induce various genes responsible for Fe uptake and translocation to obtain adequate amounts of Fe. Although transcription factors and ubiquitin ligases involved in these Fe deficiency responses have been identified, the mechanisms coordinating these pathways have not been clarified in rice. Recently identified Fe-deficiency-inducible IRON MAN (IMA)/FE UPTAKE-INDUCING PEPTIDE (FEP) positively regulates many Fe-deficiency-inducible genes for Fe uptake in Arabidopsis. Here, we report that the expression of two IMA/FEP genes in rice, OsIMA1 and OsIMA2, is strongly induced under Fe deficiency, positively regulated by the transcription factors IDEF1, OsbHLH058, and OsbHLH059, as well as OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 themselves, and negatively regulated by HRZ ubiquitin ligases. Overexpression of OsIMA1 or OsIMA2 in rice conferred tolerance to Fe deficiency and accumulation of Fe in leaves and seeds. These OsIMA-overexpressing rice exhibited enhanced expression of all of the known Fe-deficiency-inducible genes involved in Fe uptake and translocation, except for OsYSL2, a Fe-nicotianamine transporter gene, in roots but not in leaves. Knockdown and translocation-related genes in OsIMA1 knockdown roots. These results indicate that OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 play key roles in enhancing the major pathway of the Fe deficiency response in rice.
NA	IRONMAN peptide interacts with OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 to maintain Fe homeostasis in rice.	2022	J Exp Bot	CAS Key Laboratory of Tropical Plant Resources and Sustainable Use, The Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, China.	IRONMAN (IMA) is a family of small peptides which positively regulate plant responses under Fe deficiency. However, the molecular mechanism by which OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 regulate Fe homeostasis in rice is unclear. Here, we reveal that OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 interact with the potential Fe sensors, OsHRZ1 (HAEMERYTHRIN MOTIF-CONTAINING REALLY INTERESTING NEW GENE (RING) AND ZINC-FINGER PROTEIN 1) and OsHRZ2. OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 contain a conserved 17 amino acid C-terminal region which is responsible for the interactions with OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2. Plants overexpressing OsIMA1 (OsIMA1ox) show increased Fe concentration in seeds and reduced fertility, as observed in the hrz1-2 loss-of-function mutant plants. Moreover, the expression patterns of Fe deficiency inducible genes in the OsIMA1ox plants are the same as those in hrz1-2. Co-expression assays suggest that OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 promote the degradation of OsIMA1 proteins. As the interaction partners of OsHRZ1, the OsPRI (POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS) proteins also interact with OsHRZ2. The conserved C-terminal region of four OsPRIs contributes to the interactions with OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2. An artificial IMA (aIMA) derived from the C-terminal of OsPRI1 can be also degraded by OsHRZ1. Moreover, aIMA overexpressing rice plants accumulate more Fe without reduction of fertility. This work establishes the link between OsIMAs and OsHRZs, and develops a new strategy for Fe fortification in rice.
