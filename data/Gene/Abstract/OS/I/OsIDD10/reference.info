Indeterminate domain (IDD) genes are a family of plant transcriptional regulators that function in the control of development and metabolism during growth. Here, the function of Oryza sativa indeterminate domain 10 (OsIDD10) has been explored in rice plants. Compared with wild-type roots, idd10 mutant roots are hypersensitive to exogenous ammonium. This work aims to define the action of IDD10 on gene expression involved in ammonium uptake and nitrogen (N) metabolism. The ammonium induction of key ammonium uptake and assimilation genes was examined in the roots of idd10 mutants and IDD10 overexpressors. Molecular studies and transcriptome analysis were performed to identify target genes and IDD10 binding cis-elements. IDD10 activates the transcription of AMT1;2 and GDH2 by binding to a cis-element motif present in the promoter region of AMT1;2 and in the fifth intron of GDH2. IDD10 contributes significantly to the induction of several genes involved in N-linked metabolic and cellular responses, including genes encoding glutamine synthetase 2, nitrite reductases and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase. Furthermore, the possibility that IDD10 might influence the N-mediated feedback regulation of target genes was examined. This study demonstrates that IDD10 is involved in regulatory circuits that determine N-mediated gene expression in plant roots.

INDETERMINATE DOMAIN 10 (IDD10) is a key transcription factor gene that activates the expression of a large number of NH4+-responsive genes including AMMONIUM TRANSPORTER 1;2 (AMT1;2). Primary root growth of rice (Oryza sativa) idd10 mutants is hypersensitive to NH4+. The involvement of CALCINEURIN B-LIKE INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE (CIPK) genes in the action of IDD10 on NH4+-mediated root growth was investigated.Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was used to analyse NH4+- and IDD10-dependent expression of CIPK genes. IDD10-regulated CIPK target genes were identified using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation and transient transcription assays. Root growth rate, ammonium content and 15N uptake of cipk mutants were measured to determine their sensitivity to NH4+ and to compare these phenotypes with those of idd10. The genetic relationship between CIPK9 OX and idd10 was investigated by crosses between the CIPK9 and IDD10 lines.AMT1;2 was overexpressed in idd10 to determine whether NH4+-hypersensitive root growth of idd10 resulted from limitations in NH4+ uptake or from low cellular levels of NH4+. High NH4+ levels in idd10/AMT1;2 OX did not rescue the root growth defect. Next, the involvement of CIPK genes in NH4+-dependent root growth and interactions between IDD10 and CIPK genes was investigated. Molecular analysis revealed that IDD10 directly activated transcription of CIPK9 and CIPK14. Expression of CIPK8, 9, 14/15 and 23 was sensitive to exogenous NH4+. Further studies revealed that cipk9 and idd10 had almost identical NH4+-sensitive root phenotypes, including low efficiency of 15NH4+ uptake. Analysis of plants containing both idd10 and CIPK9 OX showed that CIPK9 OX could rescue the NH4+-dependent root growth defects of idd10.CIPK9 was involved in NH4+-dependent root growth and appeared to act downstream of IDD10. This information will be useful in future explorations of NH4+ signalling in plants.
