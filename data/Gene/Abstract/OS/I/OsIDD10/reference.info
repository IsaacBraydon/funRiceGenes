Indeterminate domain (IDD) genes are a family of plant transcriptional regulators that function in the control of development and metabolism during growth. Here, the function of Oryza sativa indeterminate domain 10 (OsIDD10) has been explored in rice plants. Compared with wild-type roots, idd10 mutant roots are hypersensitive to exogenous ammonium. This work aims to define the action of IDD10 on gene expression involved in ammonium uptake and nitrogen (N) metabolism. The ammonium induction of key ammonium uptake and assimilation genes was examined in the roots of idd10 mutants and IDD10 overexpressors. Molecular studies and transcriptome analysis were performed to identify target genes and IDD10 binding cis-elements. IDD10 activates the transcription of AMT1;2 and GDH2 by binding to a cis-element motif present in the promoter region of AMT1;2 and in the fifth intron of GDH2. IDD10 contributes significantly to the induction of several genes involved in N-linked metabolic and cellular responses, including genes encoding glutamine synthetase 2, nitrite reductases and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase. Furthermore, the possibility that IDD10 might influence the N-mediated feedback regulation of target genes was examined. This study demonstrates that IDD10 is involved in regulatory circuits that determine N-mediated gene expression in plant roots.
NA	CBL-INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE 9 regulates ammonium-dependent root growth downstream of IDD10 in rice (Oryza sativa).	2019	Ann Bot	College of Plant Protection, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China.	INDETERMINATE DOMAIN 10 (IDD10) is a key transcription factor gene that activates the expression of a large number of NH4+-responsive genes including AMMONIUM TRANSPORTER 1;2 (AMT1;2). Primary root growth of rice (Oryza sativa) idd10 mutants is hypersensitive to NH4+. The involvement of CALCINEURIN B-LIKE INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE (CIPK) genes in the action of IDD10 on NH4+-mediated root growth was investigated.Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was used to analyse NH4+- and IDD10-dependent expression of CIPK genes. IDD10-regulated CIPK target genes were identified using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation and transient transcription assays. Root growth rate, ammonium content and 15N uptake of cipk mutants were measured to determine their sensitivity to NH4+ and to compare these phenotypes with those of idd10. The genetic relationship between CIPK9 OX and idd10 was investigated by crosses between the CIPK9 and IDD10 lines.AMT1;2 was overexpressed in idd10 to determine whether NH4+-hypersensitive root growth of idd10 resulted from limitations in NH4+ uptake or from low cellular levels of NH4+. High NH4+ levels in idd10/AMT1;2 OX did not rescue the root growth defect. Next, the involvement of CIPK genes in NH4+-dependent root growth and interactions between IDD10 and CIPK genes was investigated. Molecular analysis revealed that IDD10 directly activated transcription of CIPK9 and CIPK14. Expression of CIPK8, 9, 14/15 and 23 was sensitive to exogenous NH4+. Further studies revealed that cipk9 and idd10 had almost identical NH4+-sensitive root phenotypes, including low efficiency of 15NH4+ uptake. Analysis of plants containing both idd10 and CIPK9 OX showed that CIPK9 OX could rescue the NH4+-dependent root growth defects of idd10.CIPK9 was involved in NH4+-dependent root growth and appeared to act downstream of IDD10. This information will be useful in future explorations of NH4+ signalling in plants.
NA	Mutation of phytochrome B promotes resistance to sheath blight and saline-alkaline stress via increasing ammonium uptake in rice.	2022	Plant J	College of Plant Protection, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, 110866, China.	Phytochrome B (PhyB), a red-light receptor, plays important roles in diverse biological processes in plants; however, its function in NH(4) (+) uptake and stress responses of plants is unclear. Here, we observed that mutation in indeterminate domain 10 (IDD10), which encodes a key transcription factor in NH(4) (+) signaling, led to NH(4) (+) -sensitive root growth in light but not in the dark. Genetic combinations of idd10 and phy mutants demonstrated that phyB, but not phyA or phyC, suppressed NH(4) (+) -sensitive root growth of idd10. PhyB mutants and PhyB overexpressors (PhyB OXs) accumulated more and less NH(4) (+) , respectively, compared with wild-type plants. Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) revealed that PhyB negatively regulated NH(4) (+) -mediated induction of Ammonium transporter 1;2 (AMT1;2). AMT1 RNAi plants with suppressed AMT1;1, AMT1;2, and AMT1;3 expression exhibited shorter primary roots under NH(4) (+) conditions. This suggested that NH(4) (+) uptake might be positively associated with root growth. Further, PhyB interacted with and inhibited IDD10 and brassinazole-resistant 1 (BZR1). IDD10 interacted with BZR1 to activate AMT1;2. NH(4) (+) uptake is known to promote resistance of rice (Oryza sativa) to sheath blight (ShB) and saline-alkaline stress. Inoculation of Rhizoctonia solani demonstrated that PhyB and IDD10 negatively regulated and AMT1 and BZR1 positively regulated resistance of rice to ShB. In addition, PhyB negatively regulated and IDD10 and AMT1 positively regulated resistance of rice to saline-alkaline stress. This suggested that PhyB-IDD10-AMT1;2 signaling regulates the saline-alkaline response, whereas the PhyB-BZR1-AMT1;2 pathway modulates ShB resistance. Collectively, these data prove that mutation in the PhyB gene enhances the resistance of rice to ShB and saline-alkaline stress by increasing NH(4) (+) uptake.
NA	Mutations in NAKED-ENDOSPERM IDD genes reveal functional interactions with SCARECROW during leaf patterning in C4 grasses.	2023	PLoS Genet	Department of Biology, University of Oxford, Oxford, England.	Leaves comprise a number of different cell-types that are patterned in the context of either the epidermal or inner cell layers. In grass leaves, two distinct anatomies develop in the inner leaf tissues depending on whether the leaf carries out C3 or C4 photosynthesis. In both cases a series of parallel veins develops that extends from the leaf base to the tip but in ancestral C3 species veins are separated by a greater number of intervening mesophyll cells than in derived C4 species. We have previously demonstrated that the GRAS transcription factor SCARECROW (SCR) regulates the number of photosynthetic mesophyll cells that form between veins in the leaves of the C4 species maize, whereas it regulates the formation of stomata in the epidermal leaf layer in the C3 species rice. Here we show that SCR is required for inner leaf patterning in the C4 species Setaria viridis but in this species the presumed ancestral stomatal patterning role is also retained. Through a comparative mutant analysis between maize, setaria and rice we further demonstrate that loss of NAKED-ENDOSPERM (NKD) INDETERMINATE DOMAIN (IDD) protein function exacerbates loss of function scr phenotypes in the inner leaf tissues of maize and setaria but not rice. Specifically, in both setaria and maize, scr;nkd mutants exhibit an increased proportion of fused veins with no intervening mesophyll cells. Thus, combined action of SCR and NKD may control how many mesophyll cells are specified between veins in the leaves of C4 but not C3 grasses. Together our results provide insight into the evolution of cell patterning in grass leaves and demonstrate a novel patterning role for IDD genes in C4 leaves.
