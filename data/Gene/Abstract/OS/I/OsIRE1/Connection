Here, we report that SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 6 (SPL6)-deficient plants displayed hyperactivation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor IRE1, leading to cell death in rice panicles, indicating that SPL6 is an essential survival factor for the suppression of persistent or intense ER stress conditions
