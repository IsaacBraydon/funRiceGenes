IRE1|OsIRE1	OsbZIP50|OsbZIP74	Cis-element of the rice PDIL2-3 promoter is responsible for inducing the endoplasmic reticulum stress response	 The activation of PDIL2-3 in response to ER stress strongly depends on the IRE1-OsbZIP50 signaling pathway
IRE1|OsIRE1	OsBiP4	Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice	 However, expression of OsBiP4&5 was highly and specifically activated under ER stress conditions induced by DTT treatment, OsBiP1 knockdown, OsBiP1 overexpression, OsIRE1 overexpression, or various exogenous recombinant proteins in transgenic rice| In contrast, OsBiP4&5 did not accumulate in OsIRE1 knockdown transgenic rice even after DTT treatment| Taken together, these results suggest that OsBiP4&5 are ER stress-related BiP proteins that are regulated by OsIRE1/OsbZIP50 pathway and that they may have a distinct function from that of OsBiP1 in rice
