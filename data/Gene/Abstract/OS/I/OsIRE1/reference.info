1-s2.0-S1389172313004003-main.pdf	Cis-element of the rice PDIL2-3 promoter is responsible for inducing the endoplasmic reticulum stress response	2014	J Biosci Bioeng	Genetically Modified Organism Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	A protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family oxidoreductase, PDIL2-3, is involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses in rice. We identified a critical cis-element required for induction of the ER stress response. The activation of PDIL2-3 in response to ER stress strongly depends on the IRE1-OsbZIP50 signaling pathway.
10.1007-s00425-012-1714-y.pdf	Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice	2012	Planta	Functional Transgenic Crops Research Unit, Genetically Modified Organism Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602, Japan.	Binding protein (BiP) is a chaperone protein involved in the folding of secretory proteins in the ER lumen. OsBiP1 is constitutively expressed in various tissues, whereas the expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 (OsBiP4&5) is not detected in any tissue under normal conditions. However, expression of OsBiP4&5 was highly and specifically activated under ER stress conditions induced by DTT treatment, OsBiP1 knockdown, OsBiP1 overexpression, OsIRE1 overexpression, or various exogenous recombinant proteins in transgenic rice. In contrast, OsBiP4&5 did not accumulate in OsIRE1 knockdown transgenic rice even after DTT treatment. When the subcellular localization of OsBiP4&5 was investigated in seed endosperm cells under the ER stress condition, OsBiP4&5 were localized to the ER, but did not participate in ER-derived protein body (PB-I) formation in a different manner to OsBiP1. These results indicate that OsBiP4&5 levels were positively correlated with stress levels in the ER. Taken together, these results suggest that OsBiP4&5 are ER stress-related BiP proteins that are regulated by OsIRE1/OsbZIP50 pathway and that they may have a distinct function from that of OsBiP1 in rice.
Hayashi-2012-Signal transduction.pdf	Signal transduction by IRE1-mediated splicing of bZIP50 and other stress sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response of rice	2012	Plant J	Genetically Modified Organism Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor IRE1 transduces signals by inducing the unconventional splicing of mRNAs encoding key transcription factors: HAC1 in yeast and XBP1 in animals. However, no HAC1 or XBP1 homologues have been found in plants, and until recently the substrate for plant IRE1 has remained unknown. This study demonstrates that the Oryza sativa (rice) OsbZIP50 transcription factor, an orthologue of Arabidopsis AtbZIP60, is regulated by IRE1-mediated splicing of its RNA. Despite the presence of a transcriptional activation domain, OsbZIP50 protein is not translocated into the nucleus efficiently in the absence of OsbZIP50 mRNA splicing. Unconventional splicing of OsbZIP50 mRNA causes a frame shift, which results in the appearance of a nuclear localization signal in the newly translated OsbZIP50. OsbZIP50 mRNA is spliced in a similar manner to HAC1 and XBP1 mRNAs; however, this splicing has very different effects on the translation products, a finding that shows the diversity of IRE1-related transcription factors in eukaryotes. In addition, the expression of OsbZIP50 is affected by ER stress sensor proteins OsIRE1, OsbZIP39 and OsbZIP60. ER stress-related genes differ with respect to their dependency on OsbZIP50 for their expression. The findings of this study improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the plant ER stress response.
Mol. Plant-2012-Lu-504-14.pdf	Conservation of IRE1-regulated bZIP74 mRNA unconventional splicing in rice (Oryza sativa L.) involved in ER stress responses	2012	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, China.	Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a fundamental process in plant cells that is vulnerable to many environmental stresses. When unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, the well-conserved unfolded protein response (UPR) is initiated to mitigate the ER stress by enhancing the protein folding capability and/or accelerating the ER-associated protein degradation. Here, we report the conservation of the activation mechanism of OsbZIP74 (also known as OsbZIP50), an important ER stress regulator in monocot plant rice (Oryza sativa L.). Under normal conditions, OsbZIP74 mRNA encodes a basic leucine-zipper transcription factor with a putative transmembrane domain. When treating with ER stress-inducing agents such as tunicamycin and DTT, the conserved double stem-loop structures of OsbZIP74 mRNA are spliced out. Thereafter, the resulting new OsbZIP74 mRNA produces the nucleus-localized form of OsbZIP74 protein, eliminating the hydrophobic region. The activated form of OsbZIP74 has transcriptional activation activity in both yeast cells and Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts. The induction of OsbZIP74 splicing is much suppressed in the OsIRE1 knock-down rice plants, indicating the involvement of OsIRE1 in OsbZIP74 splicing. We also demonstrate that the unconventional splicing of OsbZIP74 mRNA is associated with heat stress and salicylic acid, which is an important plant hormone in systemic acquired resistance against pathogen or parasite.
Plant Cell Physiol-2002-Okushima-532-9.pdf	Isolation and Characterization of a Putative Transducer of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Oryza sativa	2002	Plant and Cell Physiology	Research and Education Center for Genetic Information, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, 630-0101 Japan	Following endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that prevents correct folding or assembly of ER proteins, at least three responses occur to maintain cell homeostasis: induction of chaperones, attenuation of protein synthesis, and enhancement of lipid synthesis. Transducers that transmit ER stress to the nucleus have already been identified in yeast and mammals. We report here isolation of a cDNA, OsIre1, from rice encoding a putative homolog of Ire1p, a yeast transducer of ER stress. OsIre1 encodes a polypeptide consisting of 893 amino acids, in which two hydrophobic stretches are present in the amino-terminal (N-terminal) and middle regions, possibly serving as a signal peptide and a transmembrane domain, respectively. The carboxyl-terminal (C-terminal) domain was found to possess serine/threonine protein kinase and ribonuclease-like domains showing high similarities with regions in Ire1 homologs from other organisms. A fusion protein of OsIre1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressed in tobacco BY2 cells could be demonstrated to localize to the ER and the N-terminal domain of OsIre1 could substitute for yeast Ire1p in yeast cells. When produced in bacteria as a fusion protein, the C-terminal region of OsIre1 showed autophosphorylation activity. These results thus indicate that OsIre1 encodes a putative plant transducer of ER stress.
srep00944.pdf	Multiple roles of the ER stress sensor IRE1 demonstrated by gene targeting in rice	2012	Sci Rep	Genetically Modified Organism Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences , Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor, IRE1, contains a kinase domain and a ribonuclease domain. Ribonuclease mediates the unconventional splicing of mRNA encoding the transcription factor AtbZIP60 in Arabidopsis, or OsbZIP50 in rice, and thereby transduces signals from stressed ER. Here, we demonstrate the additional roles of plant IRE1 using genetically modified rice plants. Using a gene targeting system based on homologous recombination, genomic IRE1 was replaced with two types of missense alleles, leading to a defect in the kinase or ribonuclease activity of IRE1. Genetic analysis of these alleles demonstrated that the kinase activity of IRE1 plays a vital role independent of ribonuclease activity. Furthermore, the existence of ribonuclease substrates other than OsbZIP50 mRNA is demonstrated for the first time. This study provides new insights into higher plant signalling using a gene targeting approach.
