OsINV2	OSINV3|OsVIN2	OsINV3 and Its Homolog, OsINV2, Control Grain Size in Rice.	OsINV3 and Its Homolog, OsINV2, Control Grain Size in Rice.
OsINV2	OSINV3|OsVIN2	OsINV3 and Its Homolog, OsINV2, Control Grain Size in Rice.	 We also obtained a T-DNA insertion mutant of OsINV2, which is a homolog of OsINV3 and generated double knockout (KO) mutants of OsINV2 and OsINV3 using CRISPR/Cas9
OsINV2	OSINV3|OsVIN2	OsINV3 and Its Homolog, OsINV2, Control Grain Size in Rice.	 Genetic data showed that OsINV2, that has no effect on grain size by itself, reduces grain length and width in the absence of OsINV3
OsINV2	OSINV3|OsVIN2	OsINV3 and Its Homolog, OsINV2, Control Grain Size in Rice.	 Altered sugar content with increased sucrose and decreased hexose levels, as well as changes vacuolar invertase activities and starch constitution in INV3KO, INV2KO, INV3KOINV2KO mutants indicate that OsINV2 and OsINV3 affect sucrose metabolism in sink organs
OsINV2	OSINV3|OsVIN2	OsINV3 and Its Homolog, OsINV2, Control Grain Size in Rice.	 In summary, we identified OsINV3 as a positive regulator of grain size in rice, and while OsINV2 has no function on grain size by itself
OsINV2	OSINV3|OsVIN2	OsINV3 and Its Homolog, OsINV2, Control Grain Size in Rice.	 In the absence of OsINV3, it is possible to detect a role of OsINV2 in the regulation of grain size
OsINV2	OSINV3|OsVIN2	OsINV3 and Its Homolog, OsINV2, Control Grain Size in Rice.	 Both OsINV3 and OsINV2 are involved in sucrose metabolism, and thus regulate grain size
OsINV2	OSINV3|OsVIN2	OsINV3 and Its Homolog, OsINV2, Control Grain Size in Rice.	 Our findings increase our understanding of the role of OsINV3 and its homolog, OsINV2, in grain size development and also suggest a potential strategy to improve grain yield in rice
