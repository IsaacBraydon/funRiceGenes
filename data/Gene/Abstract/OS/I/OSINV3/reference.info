Low temperatures during rice (Oryza sativa L.) pollen development cause pollen sterility and decreased grain yield. We show that the time of highest sensitivity to cold coincides with the time of peak tapetal activity: the transition of the tetrad to early uni-nucleate stage (young microspore, YM stage). Low temperatures at this stage of pollen development result in an accumulation of sucrose in the anthers, accompanied by decreased activity of cell wall bound acid invertase and depletion of starch in mature pollen grains. Expression analysis of two cell wall (OSINV1, 4) and one vacuolar (OSINV2) acid invertase genes showed that OSINV4 is anther-specific and downregulated by cold treatment. OSINV4 is transiently expressed in the tapetum cell layer at the YM stage, and later from the early binucleate stage in the maturing microspores. The down-regulation of OSINV4 expression in the tapetum at YM may cause a disruption in hexose production and starch formation in the pollen grains. In a cold-tolerant cultivar, OSINV4 expression was not reduced by cold; sucrose did not accumulate in the anthers and starch formation in the pollen grains was not affected.
NA	Genetic Evidence for the Role of a Rice Vacuolar Invertase as a Molecular Sink Strength Determinant.	2018	Rice (N Y)	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan.	Rice is a major crop feeding the majority of the global population, and increasing its sink strength is one of the modes to alleviate the declining availability of food for the rapidly growing world population. We demonstrate a role for an important rice vacuolar invertase isoform, OsINV3, in sink strength determination.OsINV3 mutants showed shorter panicles with lighter and smaller grains, owing to a smaller cell size on the outer and inner surfaces of the palea and lemma as observed by scanning electron microscopy. Further, strong promoter::GUS expression was observed in the palea, lemma and the rachis branches in the young elongating panicles, which supported the role of OsINV3 in cell expansion and thus, in spikelet size and panicle length determination. Size of the spikelet was found to directly influence the grain weight, which was confirmed by the lack of differences in weights of hulled grain for differently segregated alleles in the heterozygous lines. Assessment of field grown mutants not only revealed a drastic reduction in the percentage of ripened grain, 1000-grain weight and final yield, but also significantly reduced partitioning of assimilates to the panicles, whereby the total dry weight remained unaffected. Determination of the non-structural carbohydrate contents revealed a lower hexose-to-sucrose ratio in the panicles of the mutants from panicle initiation to 10<U+00A0>days after heading, a stage that identifies as the critical pre-storage phase of grain filling, whereas the starch contents were not affected. In addition, strong promoter::GUS expression was observed in the dorsal end of ovary during the pre-storage phase until 6<U+00A0>days after flowering, highlighting a function for OsINV3 in monitoring the initial grain filling stage.OsINV3 was found to regulate spikelet size by playing a key role in cell expansion, driving the movement of assimilates for grain filling by modulating the hexose-to-sucrose ratio, contributing in grain weight determination and thus, the grain yield.
