Low temperatures during rice (Oryza sativa L.) pollen development cause pollen sterility and decreased grain yield. We show that the time of highest sensitivity to cold coincides with the time of peak tapetal activity: the transition of the tetrad to early uni-nucleate stage (young microspore, YM stage). Low temperatures at this stage of pollen development result in an accumulation of sucrose in the anthers, accompanied by decreased activity of cell wall bound acid invertase and depletion of starch in mature pollen grains. Expression analysis of two cell wall (OSINV1, 4) and one vacuolar (OSINV2) acid invertase genes showed that OSINV4 is anther-specific and downregulated by cold treatment. OSINV4 is transiently expressed in the tapetum cell layer at the YM stage, and later from the early binucleate stage in the maturing microspores. The down-regulation of OSINV4 expression in the tapetum at YM may cause a disruption in hexose production and starch formation in the pollen grains. In a cold-tolerant cultivar, OSINV4 expression was not reduced by cold; sucrose did not accumulate in the anthers and starch formation in the pollen grains was not affected.
NA	Genetic Evidence for the Role of a Rice Vacuolar Invertase as a Molecular Sink Strength Determinant.	2018	Rice (N Y)	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan.	Rice is a major crop feeding the majority of the global population, and increasing its sink strength is one of the modes to alleviate the declining availability of food for the rapidly growing world population. We demonstrate a role for an important rice vacuolar invertase isoform, OsINV3, in sink strength determination.OsINV3 mutants showed shorter panicles with lighter and smaller grains, owing to a smaller cell size on the outer and inner surfaces of the palea and lemma as observed by scanning electron microscopy. Further, strong promoter::GUS expression was observed in the palea, lemma and the rachis branches in the young elongating panicles, which supported the role of OsINV3 in cell expansion and thus, in spikelet size and panicle length determination. Size of the spikelet was found to directly influence the grain weight, which was confirmed by the lack of differences in weights of hulled grain for differently segregated alleles in the heterozygous lines. Assessment of field grown mutants not only revealed a drastic reduction in the percentage of ripened grain, 1000-grain weight and final yield, but also significantly reduced partitioning of assimilates to the panicles, whereby the total dry weight remained unaffected. Determination of the non-structural carbohydrate contents revealed a lower hexose-to-sucrose ratio in the panicles of the mutants from panicle initiation to 10<U+00A0>days after heading, a stage that identifies as the critical pre-storage phase of grain filling, whereas the starch contents were not affected. In addition, strong promoter::GUS expression was observed in the dorsal end of ovary during the pre-storage phase until 6<U+00A0>days after flowering, highlighting a function for OsINV3 in monitoring the initial grain filling stage.OsINV3 was found to regulate spikelet size by playing a key role in cell expansion, driving the movement of assimilates for grain filling by modulating the hexose-to-sucrose ratio, contributing in grain weight determination and thus, the grain yield.
NA	OsVIN2 encodes a vacuolar acid invertase that affects grain size by altering sugar metabolism in rice.	2019	Plant Cell Rep	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, People's Republic of China.	OsVIN2, a vacuolar invertase, affects grain size and yield by altering sugar composition, transport, and starch accumulation in rice. Grain size, a major determinant of rice yield, is influenced by many developmental and environmental factors. Sugar metabolism plays vital roles in plant development. However, the way in which sugar metabolism affects rice grain size remains largely elusive. In this study, we characterized the small grain-size rice mutant sgs1. Histological analyses showed that reduced spikelet hull and endosperm size results from decreased cell size rather than cell number. Map-based cloning and complementation tests revealed that a DaiZ7 transposon insertion in a vacuolar invertase gene OsVIN2 is responsible for the mutant phenotype. Subcellular distribution and biochemical analysis indicated that OsVIN2 is located in the vacuolar lumen, and that its sucrose hydrolysis activity is maintained under acidic conditions. Furthermore, an altered sugar content with increased sucrose and decreased hexose levels, as well as changes in invertase and sucrose synthase activities, sugar transport gene expression, and starch constitution in sgs1 implies that OsVIN2 affects sucrose metabolism, including sugar composition, transport, and conversion from the source to the sink organs. Collectively, OsVIN2 is involved in sugar metabolism, and thus regulates grain size; our findings provide insights into grain development and also suggest a potential strategy to improve grain quality and yield in rice.
NA	The Role of Rice Vacuolar Invertase2 in Seed Size Control.	2019	Mol Cells	Graduate School of Biotechnology and Crop Biotech Institute, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 17104, Korea.	Sink strength optimizes sucrose import, which is fundamental to support developing seed grains and increase crop yields, including those of rice (Oryza sativa). In this regard, little is known about the function of vacuolar invertase (VIN) in controlling sink strength and thereby seed size. Here, in rice we analyzed mutants of two VINs, OsVIN1 and OsVIN2, to examine their role during seed development. In a phenotypic analysis of the T-DNA insertion mutants, only the OsVIN2 mutant osvin2-1 exhibited reduced seed size and grain weight. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that the small seed grains of osvin2-1 can be attributed to a reduction in spikelet size. A significant decrease in VIN activity and hexose level in the osvin2-1 spikelets interfered with spikelet growth. In addition, significant reduction in starch and increase in sucrose, which are characteristic features of reduced turnover and flux of sucrose due to impaired sink strength, were evident in the pre-storage stage of osvin2-1 developing grains. In situ hybridization analysis found that expression of OsVIN2 was predominant in the endocarp of developing grains. A genetically complemented line with a native genomic clone of OsVIN2 rescued reduced VIN activity and seed size. Two additional mutants, osvin2-2 and osvin2-3 generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 method, exhibited phenotypes similar to those of osvin2-1 in spikelet and seed size, VIN activity, and sugar metabolites. These results clearly demonstrate an important role of OsVIN2 as sink strength modulator that is critical for the maintenance of sucrose flux into developing seed grains.
