OSINV3	 Further, strong promoter::GUS expression was observed in the palea, lemma and the rachis branches in the young elongating panicles, which supported the role of OsINV3 in cell expansion and thus, in spikelet size and panicle length determination |  In addition, strong promoter::GUS expression was observed in the dorsal end of ovary during the pre-storage phase until 6<U+00A0>days after flowering, highlighting a function for OsINV3 in monitoring the initial grain filling stage
