Meristem identity is crucial in determining the inflorescence architecture of grass species. We previously reported that SUPERNUMERARY BRACT (SNB) regulates the transition of spikelet meristems into floral meristems in rice (Oryza sativa). Here we demonstrated that SNB and Oryza sativa INDETERMINATE SPIKELET 1 (OsIDS1) together play important roles in inflorescence architecture and the establishment of floral meristems. In snb osids1 double mutants, the numbers of branches and spikelets within a panicle are significantly decreased, and the transition to a floral meristem is further delayed compared with the snb single mutant. Expression analyses showed that SNB and OsIDS1 are required for spatio-temporal expression of B- and E-function floral organ identity genes in the lodicules. In addition, the AP2 family genes are important for determining the degree of ramification in branch meristems, regulating the spatio-temporal expression of spikelet meristem genes, such as FRIZZY PANICLE (FZP). Furthermore, overexpression of microRNA172 (miR172) causes reductions in SNB and OsIDS1 transcript levels, and phenotypes of the transgenic plants are more severe than for snb osids1. This indicates that additional gene(s) participate in the development of branch and floral meristems. Preferential expression of mature miR172s in the area around the spikelet meristems implies that depletion of the AP2 family genes in those meristems via miR172 is an important step in controlling inflorescence branching and the formation of floral organs.
NA	Histone Deacetylase 701 (HDT701) Induces Flowering in Rice by Modulating Expression of OsIDS1.	2018	Mol Cells	Graduate School of Biotechnology and Crop Biotech Institute, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 17104, Korea.	Rice is a facultative short-day (SD) plant in which flowering is induced under SD conditions or by other environmental factors and internal genetic programs. Overexpression of Histone<U+00A0>Deacetylase 701 (HDT701) accelerates flowering in hybrid rice. In this study, mutants defective in HDT701 flowered late under both SD and long-day conditions. Expression levels of florigens Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and Rice Flowering Locus<U+00A0>T1 (RFT1), and their immediate upstream floral activator Early<U+00A0>heading date 1 (Ehd1), were significantly decreased in the<U+00A0>hdt701 mutants, indicating that HDT701 functions upstream of Ehd1 in controlling flowering time. Transcript levels of OsINDETERMINATE SPIKELET 1 (OsIDS1), an upstream repressor of Ehd1, were significantly increased in the mutants while those of OsGI and Hd1 were reduced. Chromatinimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that HDT701 directly binds to the promoter region of OsIDS1. These results suggest that HDT701 induces flowering by suppressing OsIDS1.
NA	INDETERMINATE SPIKELET 1 recruits histone deacetylase and a transcriptional repression complex to regulate rice salt tolerance.	2018	Plant Physiol	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences CITY: Beijing China [CN].	Perception and transduction of salt stress signals are critical for plant survival, growth and propagation. Thus, identification of components of the salt stress signaling pathway is important for rice (Oryza sativa) molecular breeding of salt stress resistance. Here, we report the identification of an AP2/ERF (apetala2/ethylene response factor) transcription factor indeterminate spikelet 1 (IDS1) and its roles in the regulation of rice salt tolerance. By genetic screening and phenotype analysis, we demonstrated that IDS1 conferred transcriptional repression activity and acted as a negative regulator of salt tolerance in rice. To identify potential downstream target genes regulated by IDS1, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing and ChIP-qPCR assays, and found that IDS1 may directly associate with the GCC-box-containing motifs in the promoter regions of abiotic stress responsive genes including LEA1 (late embryogenesis abundant protein 1) and SOS1 (salt overly sensitive 1), which are key genes regulating rice salt tolerance. IDS1 physically interacted with the transcriptional corepressor TPR1 (topless-related 1) and the histone deacetylase HDA1, contributing to the repression of LEA1 and SOS1 expression. Analyses of histone H3 acetylation status and RNA polymerase II occupation on the promoters of LEA1 and SOS1 further defined the molecular foundation of the transcriptional repression activity of IDS1. Our findings illustrate an epigenetic mechanism by which IDS1 modulates salt stress signalling as well as salt tolerance in rice.
