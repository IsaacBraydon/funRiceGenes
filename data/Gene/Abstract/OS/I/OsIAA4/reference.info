Aux/IAA and auxin response factor (ARF) are two important families that have been well recognized for their roles in auxin-mediated responses. Aux/IAA proteins are short-lived transcriptional regulators that mediate the auxin responses through interaction with ARF transcription factors. Although quite a few members of the Aux/IAA family have been functionally characterized in dicotyledonous plants such as Arabidopsis, but relatively limited information is available in important crops such as rice. This work focused on isolation and characterization of a member of Aux/IAA family in rice named OsIAA1. The results indicated that OsIAA1 was constitutively expressed in all the tissues and organs investigated. The expression of this gene was induced by various phytohormones including IAA, 2,4-D, kinetin, 24-epibrassinolide, and jasmonic acid. Over-expression of OsIAA1 in rice resulted in reduced inhibition of root elongation to auxin treatment, but increased sensitivity to 24-epiBL treatment. In addition, the OsIAA1-overexpression transgenic plants showed distinctive morphological changes such as decreased plant height and loose plant architecture. Protein interaction analysis suggested that OsIAA1 may act through interaction with OsARF1. T-DNA insertion mutant of OsARF1 showed reduced sensitivity to BR treatment, resembling the phenotype of OsIAA1-overexpression plants. In addition, expression patterns of some genes responsive to brassinosteroid and auxin were changed in the OsIAA1-overexpression plants. These data suggested that OsIAA1 may play important roles in the cross-talk of auxin and brassinosteroid signaling pathways and plant morphogenesis.

WRKY transcription factors have many regulatory roles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, we isolated a rice WRKY gene (OsWRKY31) that is induced by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and auxin. This gene encodes a polypeptide of 211 amino-acid residues and belongs to a subgroup of the rice WRKY gene family that probably originated after the divergence of monocot and dicot plants. OsWRKY31 was found to be localized to the nucleus of onion epidermis cells to transiently express OsWRKY31-eGFP fusion protein. Analysis of OsWRKY31 and its mutants fused with a Gal4 DNA-binding domain indicated that OsWRKY31 has transactivation activity in yeast. Overexpression of the OsWRKY31 gene was found to enhance resistance against infection with M. grisea, and the transgenic lines exhibited reduced lateral root formation and elongation compared with wild-type and RNAi plants. The lines with overexpression showed constitutive expression of many defense-related genes, such as PBZ1 and OsSci2, as well as early auxin-response genes, such as OsIAA4 and OsCrl1 genes. Furthermore, the plants with overexpression were less sensitive to exogenously supplied IBA, NAA and 2,4-D at high concentrations, suggesting that overexpression of the OsWRKY31 gene might alter the auxin response or transport. These results also suggest that OsWRKY31 might be a common component in the signal transduction pathways of the auxin response and the defense response in rice.

Auxin has pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development. AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) proteins are short-lived transcriptional regulators that mediate auxin responses through interaction with an auxin receptor, the F-box protein transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1). Most functions of Aux/IAA proteins have been identified in Arabidopsis by studying the gain-of-function mutants in domain II. In this study, we isolated and identified an Aux/IAA protein gene from rice, OsIAA4, whose protein contains a dominant mutation-type domain II. OsIAA4 has very low expression in the entire life cycle of rice. OsIAA4-overexpressing rice plants show dwarfism, increased tiller angles, reduced gravity response, and are less sensitive to synthetic auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D).
