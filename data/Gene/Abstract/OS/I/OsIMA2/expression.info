OsIMA2	 Here, we report that the expressions of two IMA/FEP genes in rice, OsIMA1 and OsIMA2, are strongly induced under Fe-deficiency, positively regulated by the transcription factors IDEF1, OsbHLH058, OsbHLH059, as well as OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 themselves, and negatively regulated by HRZ ubiquitin ligases |  Overexpression of OsIMA1 or OsIMA2 in rice conferred tolerance to Fe-deficiency and accumulation of Fe in leaves and seeds	 Overexpression of OsIMA1 or OsIMA2 in rice conferred tolerance to Fe-deficiency and accumulation of Fe in leaves and seeds
