OsIMA2	transcription factor	Iron deficiency-inducible peptide coding genes OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 positively regulate a major pathway of iron uptake and translocation in rice	 Here, we report that the expressions of two IMA/FEP genes in rice, OsIMA1 and OsIMA2, are strongly induced under Fe-deficiency, positively regulated by the transcription factors IDEF1, OsbHLH058, OsbHLH059, as well as OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 themselves, and negatively regulated by HRZ ubiquitin ligases
OsIMA2	tolerance	Iron deficiency-inducible peptide coding genes OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 positively regulate a major pathway of iron uptake and translocation in rice	 Overexpression of OsIMA1 or OsIMA2 in rice conferred tolerance to Fe-deficiency and accumulation of Fe in leaves and seeds
OsIMA2	iron	Iron deficiency-inducible peptide coding genes OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 positively regulate a major pathway of iron uptake and translocation in rice	Iron deficiency-inducible peptide coding genes OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 positively regulate a major pathway of iron uptake and translocation in rice
OsIMA2	Ubiquitin	Iron deficiency-inducible peptide coding genes OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 positively regulate a major pathway of iron uptake and translocation in rice	 Here, we report that the expressions of two IMA/FEP genes in rice, OsIMA1 and OsIMA2, are strongly induced under Fe-deficiency, positively regulated by the transcription factors IDEF1, OsbHLH058, OsbHLH059, as well as OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 themselves, and negatively regulated by HRZ ubiquitin ligases
OsIMA2	Fe	Iron deficiency-inducible peptide coding genes OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 positively regulate a major pathway of iron uptake and translocation in rice	 Overexpression of OsIMA1 or OsIMA2 in rice conferred tolerance to Fe-deficiency and accumulation of Fe in leaves and seeds
OsIMA2	Fe	Iron deficiency-inducible peptide coding genes OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 positively regulate a major pathway of iron uptake and translocation in rice	 Knockdown of OsIMA1 or OsIMA2 caused minor effects, including repression of some Fe uptake- and translocation-related genes in OsIMA1 knockdown roots
OsIMA2	R protein	IRONMAN peptide interacts with OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 to maintain Fe homeostasis in rice.	 Here, we reveal that OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 interact with the potential Fe sensors, OsHRZ1 (HAEMERYTHRIN MOTIF-CONTAINING REALLY INTERESTING NEW GENE (RING) AND ZINC-FINGER PROTEIN 1) and OsHRZ2
OsIMA2	homeostasis	IRONMAN peptide interacts with OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 to maintain Fe homeostasis in rice.	 However, the molecular mechanism by which OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 regulate Fe homeostasis in rice is unclear
