Auxin regulates many aspects of plant growth and development by altering the expression of diverse genes. Among these, the early auxin-responsive genes of Aux/IAA class have been extensively studied in dicots but little information is available on monocots. Earlier, we reported the isolation of OsiIAA1 cDNA, first monocot member of Aux/IAA gene family from rice. Extending this work further, we have isolated the OsiIAA1 gene from rice localized on chromosome 3. The transcriptional start site was mapped to 158 bp upstream to the translational start site. The increased accumulation of OsiIAA1 transcript in auxin-treated rice coleoptiles even in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, suggested that OsiIAA1 is a primary auxin response gene; the expression of OsiIAA1 gene was also upregulated in the presence of cycloheximide alone. The OsiIAA1 transcript levels were down-regulated in etiolated rice coleoptiles irradiated with far-red, red and blue light, suggesting the existence of a cross-talk between auxin and light signaling. The antibodies raised against His6-OsiIAA1 recombinant protein could detect the OsiIAA1 protein in the plant extract only in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, indicating that OsiIAA1 is rapidly degraded by proteasome complex. The degradation of the protein was enhanced by the application of exogenous auxin. Also, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 stabilized the purified His6-OsiIAA1 protein to some extent in the cell-free extracts of rice coleoptiles. The OsiIAA1 protein harbors two nuclear localization signals (NLSs), one bipartite and the other resembling SV40 type NLS. Although both the NLSs were able to target the protein to the nucleus, the bipartite NLS was more effective. These studies indicate that nuclear localization of OsiIAA1 could be a prerequisite for its role in auxin signal transduction.
1-s2.0-S0168945212000787-main.pdf	OsIAA13-mediated auxin signaling is involved in lateral root initiation in rice	2012	Plant Sci	Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi 464-8601, Japan. kitomi.yuka@d.mbox.nagoya-u.ac.jp	The plant hormone auxin is essential for root formation. After auxin perception, transmission of the auxin signal progresses through the degradation of Aux/IAA proteins. In this study, we newly isolated and characterized a rice gain-of-function mutant, Osiaa13, containing a single amino acid substitution in the core sequence required for the degradation of the OsIAA13 protein. The Osiaa13 mutant displayed typical auxin-related phenotypes: the number of lateral roots was significantly reduced and the root gravitropic response was defective. Osiaa13 mutants also exhibited altered GUS staining controlled by the DR5 promoter in lateral root initiation sites. Furthermore, expression levels of several genes that might be associated with lateral root initiation were altered in Osiaa13. Taken together, our results indicate that OsIAA13 is involved in auxin signaling and controls the expression of genes that are required for lateral root initiation in rice.
NA	A comprehensive transcriptome analysis of contrasting rice cultivars highlights the role of auxin and ABA responsive genes in heat stress response	2021	Genomics	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.	Sensing a change in ambient temperature is key to survival among all living organisms. Temperature fluctuations due to climate change are a matter of grave concern since it adversely affects growth and eventually the yield of crop plants, including two of the major cereals, i.e., rice and wheat. Thus, to understand the response of rice seedlings to elevated temperatures, we performed microarray-based transcriptome analysis of two contrasting rice cultivars, Annapurna (heat tolerant) and IR64 (heat susceptible), by subjecting their seedlings to 37 °„C and 42 °„C, sequentially. The transcriptome analyses revealed a set of uniquely regulated genes and related pathways in red rice cultivar Annapurna, particularly associated with auxin and ABA as a part of heat stress response in rice. The changes in expression of few auxin and ABA associated genes, such as OsIAA13, OsIAA20, ILL8, OsbZIP12, OsPP2C51, OsDi19-1 and OsHOX24, among others, were validated under high-temperature conditions using RT-qPCR. In particular, the expression of auxin-inducible SAUR genes was enhanced considerably at both elevated temperatures. Further, using genes that expressed inversely under heat vs. cold temperature conditions, we built a regulatory network between transcription factors (TF) such as HSFs, NAC, WRKYs, bHLHs or bZIPs and their target gene pairs and determined regulatory coordination in their expression under varying temperature conditions. Our work thus provides useful insights into temperature-responsive genes, particularly under elevated temperature conditions, and could serve as a resource of candidate genes associated with thermotolerance or downstream components of temperature sensors in rice.
