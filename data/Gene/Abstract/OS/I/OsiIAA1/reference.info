Auxin regulates many aspects of plant growth and development by altering the expression of diverse genes. Among these, the early auxin-responsive genes of Aux/IAA class have been extensively studied in dicots but little information is available on monocots. Earlier, we reported the isolation of OsiIAA1 cDNA, first monocot member of Aux/IAA gene family from rice. Extending this work further, we have isolated the OsiIAA1 gene from rice localized on chromosome 3. The transcriptional start site was mapped to 158 bp upstream to the translational start site. The increased accumulation of OsiIAA1 transcript in auxin-treated rice coleoptiles even in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, suggested that OsiIAA1 is a primary auxin response gene; the expression of OsiIAA1 gene was also upregulated in the presence of cycloheximide alone. The OsiIAA1 transcript levels were down-regulated in etiolated rice coleoptiles irradiated with far-red, red and blue light, suggesting the existence of a cross-talk between auxin and light signaling. The antibodies raised against His6-OsiIAA1 recombinant protein could detect the OsiIAA1 protein in the plant extract only in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, indicating that OsiIAA1 is rapidly degraded by proteasome complex. The degradation of the protein was enhanced by the application of exogenous auxin. Also, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 stabilized the purified His6-OsiIAA1 protein to some extent in the cell-free extracts of rice coleoptiles. The OsiIAA1 protein harbors two nuclear localization signals (NLSs), one bipartite and the other resembling SV40 type NLS. Although both the NLSs were able to target the protein to the nucleus, the bipartite NLS was more effective. These studies indicate that nuclear localization of OsiIAA1 could be a prerequisite for its role in auxin signal transduction.

After auxin perception, transmission of the auxin signal progresses through the degradation of Aux/IAA proteins. In this study, we newly isolated and characterized a rice gain-of-function mutant, Osiaa13, containing a single amino acid substitution in the core sequence required for the degradation of the OsIAA13 protein. The Osiaa13 mutant displayed typical auxin-related phenotypes: the number of lateral roots was significantly reduced and the root gravitropic response was defective. Osiaa13 mutants also exhibited altered GUS staining controlled by the DR5 promoter in lateral root initiation sites. Furthermore, expression levels of several genes that might be associated with lateral root initiation were altered in Osiaa13. Taken together, our results indicate that OsIAA13 is involved in auxin signaling and controls the expression of genes that are required for lateral root initiation in rice.
