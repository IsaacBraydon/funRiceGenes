Rice tillers are one of the most important traits for the yield and development of rice, although little is known about its mode of inheritance. Tiller numbers were recorded every 7 days a total of nine times, starting 30 days after transplantation. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) based analysis on a set of double haploid population derivatives of a cross between the Cheongcheong and Nagdong varieties identified a major effect of locus RM18130-RM3381 on chromosome 5, which was expressed in eight different growth stages. Within the target region RM18130-RM3381 (physical distance: 2.08 Mb), 61 candidate genes were screened by annotation. Among the candidate genes, Os05g0230700 (named OsIAA17q5), which belongs to the family of auxin-responsive genes, was selected as a target. Auxin promotes cell division and meristem maintenance and is an effective plant regulator which influences plant growth and development by altering the expression of various genes. OsIAA17q5 is expected to control the number of tillers. The present study provides further understanding of the basic genetic mechanisms that selectively express the control of tiller numbers in different growth stages, as well as provides valuable information for future research aimed at cloning the target gene. These results may contribute to developing a comprehensive understanding of the basic genetic processes regulating the developmental behavior of tiller numbers in rice.
