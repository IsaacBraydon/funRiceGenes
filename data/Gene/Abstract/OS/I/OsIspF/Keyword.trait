OsIspF	chloroplast	A single nucleotide mutation of IspF gene involved in the MEP pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis causes yellow-green leaf phenotype in rice.	 OsIspF was expressed in all tissues detected, and its encoded protein was targeted to the chloroplast

OsIspF	map-based cloning	A single nucleotide mutation of IspF gene involved in the MEP pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis causes yellow-green leaf phenotype in rice.	 By map-based cloning of this mutant, we identified OsIspF gene (LOC_Os02g45660) showing significant similarity to IspF gene of Arabidopsis, in which a missense mutation occurred in the mutant, resulting in an amino acid change in the encoded protein
