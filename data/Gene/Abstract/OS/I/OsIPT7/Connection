OSH71|Oskn2	OsIPT7	OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.	 Furthermore, our chromatin immunoprecipitation results demonstrate that OsARID3 binds directly to the KNOXI gene OSH71, the auxin biosynthetic genes OsYUC1 and OsYUC6, and the cytokinin biosynthetic genes OsIPT2 and OsIPT7
