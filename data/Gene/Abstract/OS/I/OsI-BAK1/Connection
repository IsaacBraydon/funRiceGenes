OsBISERK1|OsSERK1|OsBAK1|TBP1	OsI-BAK1	Brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated kinase 1 (OsI-BAK1) is associated with grain filling and leaf development in rice.	The aim of this study is to investigate the functions of a rice OsBAK1 homologue, designated as OsI-BAK1, which is highly expressed after heading
OsI-BAK1	OsWRKY24	Silencing a Simple Extracellular Leucine-Rich Repeat Gene OsI-BAK1 Enhances the Resistance of Rice to Brown Planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.	 Silencing OsI-BAK1 (ir-ibak1) in rice enhanced the BPH-induced transcript levels of three defense-related WRKY genes (OsWRKY24, OsWRKY53 and OsWRKY70) but decreased the induced levels of ethylene
