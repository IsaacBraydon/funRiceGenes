NA	Brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated kinase 1 (OsI-BAK1) is associated with grain filling and leaf development in rice.	2015	J Plant Physiol	Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, 43400 Serdang, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia.	Brassinosteroid Insensitive 1 (BRI1)-Associated Kinase I (BAK1) has been reported to interact with BRI1 for brassinosteroid (BR) perception and signal transduction that regulate plant growth and development. The aim of this study is to investigate the functions of a rice OsBAK1 homologue, designated as OsI-BAK1, which is highly expressed after heading. Silencing of OsI-BAK1 in rice plants produced a high number of undeveloped green and unfilled grains compared to the untransformed plants. Histological analyses demonstrated that embryos were either absent or retarded in their development in these unfilled rice grains of OsI-BAK1 RNAi plants. Down regulation of OsI-BAK1 caused a reduction in cell number and enlargement in leaf bulliform cells. Furthermore, transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsI-BAK1 were demonstrated to have corrugated and twisted leaves probably due to increased cell number that caused abnormal bulliform cell structure which were enlarged and plugged deep into leaf epidermis. The current findings suggest that OsI-BAK1 may play an important role in the developmental processes of rice grain filling and leaf cell including the bulliform cells.
NA	Silencing a Simple Extracellular Leucine-Rich Repeat Gene OsI-BAK1 Enhances the Resistance of Rice to Brown Planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.	2021	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology &amp; Ministry of Agriculture Key Lab of Agricultural Entomology, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Many plant proteins with extracellular leucine-rich repeat (eLRR) domains play an important role in plant immunity. However, the role of one class of eLRR plant proteins-the simple eLRR proteins-in plant defenses against herbivores remains largely unknown. Here, we found that a simple eLRR protein OsI-BAK1 in rice localizes to the plasma membrane. Its expression was induced by mechanical wounding, the infestation of gravid females of brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens or white-backed planthopper Sogatella furcifera and treatment with methyl jasmonate or abscisic acid. Silencing OsI-BAK1 (ir-ibak1) in rice enhanced the BPH-induced transcript levels of three defense-related WRKY genes (OsWRKY24, OsWRKY53 and OsWRKY70) but decreased the induced levels of ethylene. Bioassays revealed that the hatching rate was significantly lower in BPH eggs laid on ir-ibak1 plants than wild-type (WT) plants; moreover, gravid BPH females preferred to oviposit on WT plants over ir-ibak1 plants. The exogenous application of ethephon on ir-ibak1 plants eliminated the BPH oviposition preference between WT and ir-ibak1 plants but had no effect on the hatching rate of BPH eggs. These findings suggest that OsI-BAK1 acts as a negative modulator of defense responses in rice to BPH and that BPH might exploit this modulator for its own benefit.
