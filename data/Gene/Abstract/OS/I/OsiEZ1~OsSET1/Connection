OsFIE1|Epi-df	OsiEZ1|OsSET1|SDG718	Imprinted Gene OsFIE1 Modulates Rice Seed Development by Influencing the Nutrient Metabolism and Modifying Genome H3K27me3.	OsFIE1 specifically expressed in endosperm, and mRNA of OsFIE1 also enriched in inner seed coat with the corresponding PcG members of OsiEZ1 and OsCLF

OsFIE2	OsiEZ1|OsSET1|SDG718	Polycomb Protein OsFIE2 Affects Plant Height and Grain Yield in Rice.	Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays demonstrated that OsFIE2 interacts with OsiEZ1 which encodes an enhancer of zeste protein previously identified as a histone methylation enzyme
OsiEZ1|OsSET1|SDG718	RIFLA	Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.	 Under normal conditions, the transcript level of the rice enhancer of zeste gene OsiEZ1, a homolog of Arabidopsis histone H3K27-specific methyltransferase genes SWINGER (SWN) and CURLY LEAF (CLF), was as low as that of RIFLA, whereas the transcript level of OsMADS56 was relatively high
OsiEZ1|OsSET1|SDG718	RIFLA	Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.	 In the osiez1 mutant, OsMADS56 expression was upregulated, whereas RIFLA expression was downregulated
