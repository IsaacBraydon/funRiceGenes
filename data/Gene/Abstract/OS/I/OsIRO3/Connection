OsIRO3|OsOsbHLH063	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 (OsPRI1) positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.	 Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assay results suggested that OsPRI1 binds to the OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 promoters
OsIRO3|OsOsbHLH063	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 (OsPRI1) positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.	 Collectively, these results imply that OsPRI1, which is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1, mediates rice responses to Fe-deficiency by positively regulating OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 expression as part of the OsHRZ1-OsPRI1-OsIRO2/3 signal transduction cascade
OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059|OsPRI3	OsIRO3|OsOsbHLH063	Oryza sativa POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON DEFICIENCY RESPONSE 2 (OsPRI2) and OsPRI3 are involved in the maintenance of Fe homeostasis.	 We also provide evidence that OsPRI2 and OsPRI3 bind to the promoters of OsIRO2 and OsIRO3, two key regulators of Fe homeostasis
