OsIRO3|OsOsbHLH063	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 (OsPRI1) positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.	 Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assay results suggested that OsPRI1 binds to the OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 promoters
OsIRO3|OsOsbHLH063	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 (OsPRI1) positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.	 Collectively, these results imply that OsPRI1, which is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1, mediates rice responses to Fe-deficiency by positively regulating OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 expression as part of the OsHRZ1-OsPRI1-OsIRO2/3 signal transduction cascade
OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059|OsPRI3	OsIRO3|OsOsbHLH063	Oryza sativa POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON DEFICIENCY RESPONSE 2 (OsPRI2) and OsPRI3 are involved in the maintenance of Fe homeostasis.	 We also provide evidence that OsPRI2 and OsPRI3 bind to the promoters of OsIRO2 and OsIRO3, two key regulators of Fe homeostasis
OsIRO3|OsOsbHLH063	OsNAS3	OsIRO3 Plays an Essential Role in Iron Deficiency Responses and Regulates Iron Homeostasis in Rice	 Further analysis indicated that OsIRO3 can directly bind to the E-box in the promoter of OsNAS3
OsIRO3|OsOsbHLH063	OsNAS3	OsIRO3 Plays an Essential Role in Iron Deficiency Responses and Regulates Iron Homeostasis in Rice	 Thus, we conclude that OsIRO3 plays a key role in responding to Fe deficiency and regulates NA levels by directly, negatively regulating the OsNAS3 expression
OsIRO2|OsbHLH056	OsIRO3|OsOsbHLH063	OsIRO3 negatively regulates Fe homeostasis by repressing the expression of OsIRO2.	OsIRO3 negatively regulates Fe homeostasis by repressing the expression of OsIRO2.
OsIRO2|OsbHLH056	OsIRO3|OsOsbHLH063	OsIRO3 negatively regulates Fe homeostasis by repressing the expression of OsIRO2.	 Further analysis revealed that OsIRO3 directly regulated the expression of IRON-RELATED BHLH TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2 (OsIRO2), which encodes a positive regulator of the Fe uptake system
OsIRO2|OsbHLH056	OsIRO3|OsOsbHLH063	OsIRO3 negatively regulates Fe homeostasis by repressing the expression of OsIRO2.	 OsIRO3 repressed their transcription activation towards OsIRO2
