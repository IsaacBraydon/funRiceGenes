BACKGROUND: Iron (Fe) is the most limiting micronutrient element for crop production in alkaline soils. A number of transcription factors involved in regulating Fe uptake from soil and transport in plants have been identified. Analysis of transcriptome data from Oryza sativa grown under limiting Fe conditions reveals that transcript abundances of several genes encoding transcription factors are altered by Fe availability. These transcription factors are putative regulators of Fe deficiency responses. RESULTS: Transcript abundance of one nuclear located basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor, OsIRO3, is up-regulated from 25- to 90-fold under Fe deficiency in both root and shoot respectively. The expression of OsIRO3 is specifically induced by Fe deficiency, and not by other micronutrient deficiencies. Transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsIRO3 were hypersensitive to Fe deficiency, indicating that the Fe deficiency response was compromised. Furthermore, the Fe concentration in shoots of transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsIRO3 was less than that in wild-type plants. Analysis of the transcript abundances of genes normally induced by Fe deficiency in OsIRO3 over-expressing plants indicated their induction was markedly suppressed. CONCLUSION: A novel Fe regulated bHLH transcription factor (OsIRO3) that plays an important role for Fe homeostasis in rice was identified. The inhibitory effect of OsIRO3 over-expression on Fe deficiency response gene expression combined with hypersensitivity of OsIRO3 over-expression lines to low Fe suggest that OsIRO3 is a negative regulator of the Fe deficiency response in rice.
NA	OsIRO3 Plays an Essential Role in Iron Deficiency Responses and Regulates Iron Homeostasis in Rice	2020	Plants (Basel)	College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Iron (Fe) homeostasis is essential for plant growth and development, and it is strictly regulated by a group of transcriptional factors. Iron-related transcription factor 3 (OsIRO3) was previously identified as a negative regulator for Fe deficiency response in rice. However, the molecular mechanisms by which OsIRO3 regulate Fe homeostasis is unclear. Here, we report that OsIRO3 is essential for responding to Fe deficiency and maintaining Fe homeostasis in rice. OsIRO3 is expressed in the roots, leaves, and base nodes, with a higher level in leaf blades at the vegetative growth stage. Knockout of OsIRO3 resulted in a hypersensitivity to Fe deficiency, with severe necrosis on young leaves and defective root development. The iro3 mutants accumulated higher levels of Fe in the shoot under Fe-deficient conditions, associated with upregulating the expression of OsNAS3, which lead to increased accumulation of nicotianamine (NA) in the roots. Further analysis indicated that OsIRO3 can directly bind to the E-box in the promoter of OsNAS3. Moreover, the expression of typical Fe-related genes was significantly up-regulated in iro3 mutants under Fe-sufficient conditions. Thus, we conclude that OsIRO3 plays a key role in responding to Fe deficiency and regulates NA levels by directly, negatively regulating the OsNAS3 expression.
NA	A Model to Incorporate the bHLH Transcription Factor OsIRO3 within the Rice Iron Homeostasis Regulatory Network.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	School of BioSciences, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia.	Iron (Fe) homeostasis in plants is governed by a complex network of regulatory elements and transcription factors (TFs), as both Fe toxicity and deficiency negatively impact plant growth and physiology. The Fe homeostasis network is well characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana and remains poorly understood in monocotyledon species such as rice (Oryza sativa L.). Recent investigation of the rice Fe homeostasis network revealed OsIRO3, a basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) TF as a putative negative regulator of genes involved in Fe uptake, transport, and storage. We employed CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to target the OsIRO3 coding sequence and generate two independent T-DNA-free, loss-of-function iro3 mutants in rice cv. Nipponbare. The iro3 mutant plants had similar phenotype under nutrient-sufficient conditions and had stunted growth under Fe-deficient conditions, relative to a T-DNA free, wild-type control (WT). Under Fe deficiency, iro3 mutant shoots had reduced expression of Fe chelator biosynthetic genes (OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAAT1) and upregulated expression of an Fe transporter gene (OsYSL15), relative to WT shoots. We place our results in the context of the existing literature and generate a model describing the role of OsIRO3 in rice Fe homeostasis and reinforce the essential function of OsIRO3 in the rice Fe deficiency response.
