Fassetti-2011-IP6K gene identifica.pdf	IP6K gene identification in plant genomes by tag searching	2011	BMC Proc	DEIS, Universita della Calabria, Via Pietro Bucci 41C Rende (CS) Italy. simona.rombo@deis.unical.it.	BACKGROUND: Plants have played a special role in inositol polyphosphate (IP) research since in plant seeds was discovered the first IP, the fully phosphorylated inositol ring of phytic acid (IP6). It is now known that phytic acid is further metabolized by the IP6 Kinases (IP6Ks) to generate IP containing pyro-phosphate moiety. The IP6K are evolutionary conserved enzymes identified in several mammalian, fungi and amoebae species. Although IP6K has not yet been identified in plant chromosomes, there are many clues suggesting its presences in vegetal cells. RESULTS: In this paper we propose a new approach to search for the plant IP6K gene, that lead to the identification in plant genome of a nucleotide sequence corresponding to a specific tag of the IP6K family. Such a tag has been found in all IP6K genes identified up to now, as well as in all genes belonging to the Inositol Polyphosphate Kinases superfamily (IPK). The tag sequence corresponds to the inositol-binding site of the enzyme, and it can be considered as characterizing all IPK genes. To this aim we applied a technique based on motif discovery. We exploited DLSME, a software recently proposed, which allows for the motif structure to be only partially specified by the user. First we applied the new method on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of plants, where such a gene could have been nested, possibly encrypted and hidden by virtue of the editing and/or trans-splicing processes. Then we looked for the gene in nuclear genome of two model plants, Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis we conducted in plant mitochondria provided the negative, though we argue relevant, result that IP6K does not actually occur in vegetable mtDNA. Very interestingly, the tag search in nuclear genomes lead us to identify a promising sequence in chromosome 5 of Oryza sativa. Further analyses are in course to confirm that this sequence actually corresponds to IP6K mammalian gene.
Suzuki-2007-Expression pattern o.pdf	Expression pattern of inositol phosphate-related enzymes in rice (Oryza sativa L.): Implications for the phytic acid biosynthetic pathway	2007	Gene	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Yayoi 1-1-1, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Phytic acid, myo-inositol-hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)), is a storage form of phosphorus in plants. Despite many physiological investigations of phytic acid accumulation and storage, little is known at the molecular level about its biosynthetic pathway in plants. Recent work has suggested two pathways. One is an inositol lipid-independent pathway that occurs through the sequential phosphorylation of 1D-myo-inositol 3-phosphate (Ins(3)P). The second is a phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated pathway, in which inositol 1,4,5-tris-phosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P(3)) is sequentially phosphorylated to InsP(6). We identified 12 genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.) that code for the enzymes that may be involved in the metabolism of inositol phosphates. These enzymes include 1D-myo-inositol 3-phosphate synthase (MIPS), inositol monophosphatase (IMP), inositol 1,4,5-tris-phosphate kinase/inositol polyphosphate kinase (IPK2), inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPK1), and inositol 1,3,4-triskisphosphate 5/6-kinase (ITP5/6K). The quantification of absolute amounts of mRNA by real-time RT-PCR revealed the unique expression patterns of these genes. Outstanding up-regulation of the four genes, a MIPS, an IPK1, and two ITP5/6Ks in embryos, suggested that they play a significant role in phytic acid biosynthesis and that the lipid-independent pathway was mainly active in developing seeds. On the other hand, the up-regulation of a MIPS, an IMP, an IPK2, and an ITP5/6K in anthers suggested that a PLC-mediated pathway was active in addition to a lipid-independent pathway in the anthers.
NA	Rice Inositol Polyphosphate Kinase (OsIPK2) Directly Interacts with OsIAA11 to Regulate Lateral Root Formation.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430072, China.	The plant hormone auxin controls many aspects of plant growth and development by promoting the degradation of Auxin/Indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) proteins. The domain II (DII) of Aux/IAA proteins is sufficient for eliciting the degradation by direct interacting with the auxin receptor F-box protein TIR1 to form a TIR1/AFBs-Aux/IAA complex in an auxin-dependent manner. However, the underlying mechanism of fine-tuning Aux/IAA degradation by auxin stimuli has remained to be elucidated. Here, we show that OsIPK2, a rice (Oryza sativa) inositol polyphosphate kinase, directly interacts with an Aux/IAA protein OsIAA11 to repress its degradation. In a rice protoplast transient expression system, the auxin-induced degradation of Myc-OsIAA11 fusion was delayed by co-expressed GFP-OsIPK2 proteins. Furthermore, expressing additional OsIPK2 or its N-terminal amino acid sequence enhanced the accumulation of OsIAA11 protein in transgenic plants, which in turn caused defects in lateral root formation and auxin response. Taken together, we identify a novel co-factor of Aux/IAA in auxin signaling and demonstrate its role in regulating lateral root development.
NA	Rice EARLY SENESCENCE 2, encoding an inositol polyphosphate kinase, is involved in leaf senescence	2020	BMC Plant Biol	Key Laboratory of Northeast Rice Biology and Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture/Rice Research Institute, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, 110866, People's Republic of China.	Background: Early leaf senescence influences yield and yield quality by affecting plant growth and development. A series of leaf senescence-associated molecular mechanisms have been reported in rice. However, the complex genetic regulatory networks that control leaf senescence need to be elucidated.  Results: In this study, an early senescence 2 (es2) mutant was obtained from ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis (EMS)-induced mutational library for the Japonica rice cultivar Wuyugeng 7 (WYG7). Leaves of es2 showed early senescence at the seedling stage and became severe at the tillering stage. The contents of reactive oxygen species (ROS) significantly increased, while chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, catalase (CAT) activity significantly decreased in the es2 mutant. Moreover, genes which related to senescence, ROS and chlorophyll degradation were up-regulated, while those associated with photosynthesis and chlorophyll synthesis were down-regulated in es2 mutant compared to WYG7. The ES2 gene, which encodes an inositol polyphosphate kinase (OsIPK2), was fine mapped to a 116.73-kb region on chromosome 2. DNA sequencing of ES2 in the mutant revealed a missense mutation, ES2 was localized to nucleus and plasma membrane of cells, and expressed in various tissues of rice. Complementation test and overexpression experiment confirmed that ES2 completely restored the normal phenotype, with chlorophyll contents and photosynthetic rate increased comparable with the wild type. These results reveal the new role of OsIPK2 in regulating leaf senescence in rice and therefore will provide additional genetic evidence on the molecular mechanisms controlling early leaf senescence.  Conclusions: The ES2 gene, encoding an inositol polyphosphate kinase localized in the nucleus and plasma membrane of cells, is essential for leaf senescence in rice. Further study of ES2 will facilitate the dissection of the genetic mechanisms underlying early leaf senescence and plant growth.
NA	OsIPK2, a rice inositol polyphosphate kinase gene, is involved in phosphate homeostasis and root development.	2023	Plant Cell Physiol	College of Life Sciences, Luoyang Normal University, Luoyang, Henan 471934, China.	Phosphorus (P) is one kind of growth-limiting nutrient for plants, which is taken up by root tissue from the environment as inorganic phosphate (Pi). To maintain an appropriate status of cellular Pi, plants have developed sophisticated strategies to sense Pi level and modulate their root system architecture (RSA) under the ever-changing growth condition. However, the molecular basis underlying the mechanism remains elusive. Inositol polyphosphate kinase (IPK2) is a key enzyme in the inositol phosphate metabolism pathway, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of IP3 into IP5 by consuming ATP. In this study, the function of a rice inositol polyphosphate kinase gene (OsIPK2) in plant Pi homeostasis and thus physiological response to Pi signal were characterized. As a biosynthetic gene for phytic acid in rice, overexpression of OsIPK2 led to distinct changes of inositol polyphosphate profiles and an excessive accumulation of Pi level in transgenic rice under Pi-sufficient conditions. The inhibitory effects of OsIPK2 on root growth were alleviated by Pi-deficient treatment compared with wild-type plants, suggesting the involvement of OsIPK2 in the Pi-regulated reconstruction of RSA. In OsIPK2-overexpressing plants, the altered acid phosphatase (APases) activities and misregulation of Pi starvation induced (PSI) genes were observed in roots under different Pi supply conditions. Notably, the expression of OsIPK2 also altered the Pi homeostasis and root system architecture in transgenic Arabidopsis. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that OsIPK2 plays an important role in Pi homeostasis and root system architecture adjustment in response to different environmental Pi levels in plant.
