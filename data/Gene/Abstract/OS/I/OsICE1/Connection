OsbHLH001|OsICE2	OsICE1|OsbHLH002	Rice homologs of inducer of CBF expression (OsICE) are involved in cold acclimation	These sizes are consistent with those predicted for OsICE1 and OsICE2, respectively
OsbHLH001|OsICE2	OsICE1|OsbHLH002	Rice homologs of inducer of CBF expression (OsICE) are involved in cold acclimation	In contrast to the proteins, cold stress had little or no effect on the expression of OsICE1 and OsICE2
MYBS3|OsMYBS3	OsICE1|OsbHLH002	The Rice Transcription Factors OsICE Confer Enhanced Cold Tolerance in Transgenic Arabidopsis.	 Furthermore, we showed that both OsICE1 and OsICE2 physically interact with OsMYBS3, a single DNA-binding repeat MYB transcription factor that is essential for cold adaptation in rice, suggesting that OsICE1/OsICE2 and OsMYBS3 probably act through specific signal transduction mechanisms to coordinate cold tolerance in rice
OsbHLH001|OsICE2	OsICE1|OsbHLH002	The Rice Transcription Factors OsICE Confer Enhanced Cold Tolerance in Transgenic Arabidopsis.	 Here we identified that OsICE1 and OsICE2 in rice shared highly conserved amino acid sequence with AtICE1 in Arabidopsis
OsbHLH001|OsICE2	OsICE1|OsbHLH002	The Rice Transcription Factors OsICE Confer Enhanced Cold Tolerance in Transgenic Arabidopsis.	 Overexpression of OsICE1 and OsICE2 in Arabidopsis significantly enhanced the cold tolerance of Arabidopsis seedlings and improved the expression of cold-response genes
OsbHLH001|OsICE2	OsICE1|OsbHLH002	The Rice Transcription Factors OsICE Confer Enhanced Cold Tolerance in Transgenic Arabidopsis.	 Furthermore, we showed that both OsICE1 and OsICE2 physically interact with OsMYBS3, a single DNA-binding repeat MYB transcription factor that is essential for cold adaptation in rice, suggesting that OsICE1/OsICE2 and OsMYBS3 probably act through specific signal transduction mechanisms to coordinate cold tolerance in rice
OsICE1|OsbHLH002	OsPP2C27	Phosphatase OsPP2C27 directly dephosphorylates OsMAPK3 and OsbHLH002 to negatively regulate cold tolerance in rice	Phosphatase OsPP2C27 directly dephosphorylates OsMAPK3 and OsbHLH002 to negatively regulate cold tolerance in rice
OsICE1|OsbHLH002	OsPP2C27	Phosphatase OsPP2C27 directly dephosphorylates OsMAPK3 and OsbHLH002 to negatively regulate cold tolerance in rice	We found that a novel type 2C protein phosphatase, OsPP2C27, functions as a negative regulator of the OsMAPK3-OsbHLH002-OsTPP1 pathway.
OSH1|Oskn1	OsICE1|OsbHLH002	The OsbHLH002/OsICE1-OSH1 module orchestrates secondary cell wall formation in rice.	 Further results show that OsbHLH002 and Oryza sativa homeobox1 (OSH1) interact and share a set of common targets
OSH1|Oskn1	OsICE1|OsbHLH002	The OsbHLH002/OsICE1-OSH1 module orchestrates secondary cell wall formation in rice.	 In addition, the DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1, rice ortholog of KNOTTED ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA7, and OsNAC31 interact with OsbHLH002 and OSH1 and regulate their binding capacity on OsMYB61, a key regulatory factor in SCW development
OSH1|Oskn1	OsICE1|OsbHLH002	The OsbHLH002/OsICE1-OSH1 module orchestrates secondary cell wall formation in rice.	 Collectively, our results indicate OsbHLH002 and OSH1 as key regulators in SCW formation and shed light on molecular mechanisms of how active and repressive factors precisely orchestrate SCW synthesis in rice, which may provide a strategy for manipulating plant biomass production
