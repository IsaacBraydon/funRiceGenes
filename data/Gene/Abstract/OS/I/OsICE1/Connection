OsbHLH001|OsICE2	OsICE1	Rice homologs of inducer of CBF expression (OsICE) are involved in cold acclimation	 These sizes are consistent with those predicted for OsICE1 and OsICE2, respectively
OsbHLH001|OsICE2	OsICE1	Rice homologs of inducer of CBF expression (OsICE) are involved in cold acclimation	 In contrast to the proteins, cold stress had little or no effect on the expression of OsICE1 and OsICE2
