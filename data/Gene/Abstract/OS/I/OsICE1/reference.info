Recently, Inducer of CBF Expression 1 (ICE1) was identified as the master regulator inducing dehydration responsive element binding protein/C-repeat binding factor (DREB/CBF)-type transcriptional factors involved in the signaling of cold and osmotic stress in Arabidopsis. To examine whether rice ICE homologs function in cold acclimation via regulation of rice DREB homologs in response to cold stress, we assessed a polypeptide epitope containing an ICE-specific motif. Chilling stress on rice seedlings induced two ICE-related proteins with molecular masses of approximately 55 and 40 kDa. These sizes are consistent with those predicted for OsICE1 and OsICE2, respectively. In contrast to the proteins, cold stress had little or no effect on the expression of OsICE1 and OsICE2. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR indicated that both were constantly expressed, but that cold stress sequentially upregulated OsDREB1B, rice heat shock factor A3 (OsHsfA3), and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (OsTPP1). Trehalose treatment enhanced the cold tolerance of seedlings. These results suggest that OsICE homologs function in transcriptional regulation at upstream of a cold-stress-induced transcription factor cascade involving OsDREB1B and OsHsfA3, leading to cold acclimation, possibly involving trehalose synthesis.

Cold stress is one of the major constraints for crop yield. Plants have in turn evolved highly sophisticated mechanisms involving altered physiological and biochemical processes to cope with the cold stress. Previous studies have revealed that the INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION 1 (ICE1), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, directly binds and activates the expression of C-Repeat Binding Factor/Dehydration-Responsive-Element-Binding protein (CBF/DREB1) to regulate the cold-response pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the function of AtICE1 orthologues in rice is largely unknown. Here we identified that OsICE1 and OsICE2 in rice shared highly conserved amino acid sequence with AtICE1 in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of OsICE1 and OsICE2 in Arabidopsis significantly enhanced the cold tolerance of Arabidopsis seedlings and improved the expression of cold-response genes. Furthermore, we showed that both OsICE1 and OsICE2 physically interact with OsMYBS3, a single DNA-binding repeat MYB transcription factor that is essential for cold adaptation in rice, suggesting that OsICE1/OsICE2 and OsMYBS3 probably act through specific signal transduction mechanisms to coordinate cold tolerance in rice. These results demonstrated that the two OsICEs are orthologues of AtICE1 and play positive regulators in activation of cold-response genes to regulate the cold tolerance.
