28_303.pdf	Rice homologs of inducer of CBF expression (OsICE) are involved in cold acclimation	2011	Plant Biotechnology	None	Cold stress on crops results in severe yield losses through growth retardation and irreversible damage. Recently, Inducer of CBF Expression 1 (ICE1) was identified as the master regulator inducing dehydration responsive element binding protein/C-repeat binding factor (DREB/CBF)-type transcriptional factors involved in the signaling of cold and osmotic stress in Arabidopsis. To examine whether rice ICE homologs function in cold acclimation via regulation of rice DREB homologs in response to cold stress, we assessed a polypeptide epitope containing an ICE-specific motif. Chilling stress on rice seedlings induced two ICE-related proteins with molecular masses of approximately 55 and 40 kDa. These sizes are consistent with those predicted for OsICE1 and OsICE2, respectively. In contrast to the proteins, cold stress had little or no effect on the expression of OsICE1 and OsICE2. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR indicated that both were constantly expressed, but that cold stress sequentially upregulated OsDREB1B, rice heat shock factor A3 (OsHsfA3), and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (OsTPP1). Trehalose treatment enhanced the cold tolerance of seedlings. These results suggest that OsICE homologs function in transcriptional regulation at upstream of a cold-stress-induced transcription factor cascade involving OsDREB1B and OsHsfA3, leading to cold acclimation, possibly involving trehalose synthesis.
NA	The Rice Transcription Factors OsICE Confer Enhanced Cold Tolerance in Transgenic Arabidopsis.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	a School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University , Lanzhou , P.R. China.	Cold stress is one of the major constraints for crop yield. Plants have in turn evolved highly sophisticated mechanisms involving altered physiological and biochemical processes to cope with the cold stress. Previous studies have revealed that the INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION 1 (ICE1), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, directly binds and activates the expression of C-Repeat Binding Factor/Dehydration-Responsive-Element-Binding protein (CBF/DREB1) to regulate the cold-response pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the function of AtICE1 orthologues in rice is largely unknown. Here we identified that OsICE1 and OsICE2 in rice shared highly conserved amino acid sequence with AtICE1 in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of OsICE1 and OsICE2 in Arabidopsis significantly enhanced the cold tolerance of Arabidopsis seedlings and improved the expression of cold-response genes. Furthermore, we showed that both OsICE1 and OsICE2 physically interact with OsMYBS3, a single DNA-binding repeat MYB transcription factor that is essential for cold adaptation in rice, suggesting that OsICE1/OsICE2 and OsMYBS3 probably act through specific signal transduction mechanisms to coordinate cold tolerance in rice. These results demonstrated that the two OsICEs are orthologues of AtICE1 and play positive regulators in activation of cold-response genes to regulate the cold tolerance.
NA	OsMAPK3 Phosphorylates OsbHLH002/OsICE1 and Inhibits Its Ubiquitination to Activate OsTPP1 and Enhances Rice Chilling Tolerance.	2017	Dev Cell	The Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	Improvement of chilling tolerance is a major target in rice breeding. The signaling pathways regulating chilling consist of complex networks, including key transcription factors and their targets. However, it remains largely unknown how transcription factors are activated by chilling stress. Here, we report that<U+00A0>the transcription factor OsbHLH002/OsICE1 is phosphorylated by OsMAPK3 under chilling stress. The osbhlh002-1 knockout mutant and antisense transgenic plants showed chilling hypersensitivity, whereas OsbHLH002-overexpressing plants exhibited enhanced chilling tolerance. OsbHLH002 can directly target OsTPP1, which encodes a key enzyme for trehalose biosynthesis. OsMAPK3 interacts with OsbHLH002 to prevent its ubiquitination by the E3 ligase OsHOS1. Under chilling stress, active OsMAPK3 phosphorylates OsbHLH002, leading to accumulation of phospho-OsbHLH002, which promotes OsTPP1 expression and increases trehalose content and resistance to chilling damage.<U+00A0>Taken together, these results indicate that OsbHLH002 is phosphorylated by OsMAPK3, which enhances OsbHLH002 activation to its target OsTPP1 during chilling stress.
NA	Multiple transcriptional factors control stomata development in rice.	2019	New Phytol	MOE Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, China.	The grass stomata can balance the gas exchange and evaporation effectively in rapidly changing environment via their unique anatomical features. Although the key components of stomatal development in Arabidopsis have been largely elucidated during the past decade, the molecular mechanisms that govern stomatal development in grasses are poorly understood. Via the genome editing system and T-DNA insertion lines, the key transcriptional factors (TFs) regulating stomatal development in rice (Oryza sativa) were knocked out. A combination of genetic and biochemical assays subsequently revealed the functions of these TFs. OsSPCH/OsICE is essential for the initiation of stomatal lineage. OsMUTE/OsICE determines meristemoid to guard mother cell (GMC) transition. OsFAMA/OsICE influences subsidiary mother cell asymmetric division and mature stoma differentiation. OsFLP regulates the orientation of GMC symmetric division. More importantly, we found that OsSCR/OsSHR controls the initiation of stomatal lineage cells and the formation of subsidiary cells, and the transcription of OsSCR is activated by OsSPCH and OsMUTE. This study characterized the functions of master regulatory TFs that control each stomatal developmental stage in rice. Our findings are helpful to elucidate how various species reprogramme the molecular mechanisms to generate different stomatal types during evolution. This article is protected by copyright.

NA	RSD1 Is Essential for Stomatal Patterning and Files in Rice	2020	Front Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China.	Stomatal density is an important factor that determines the efficiency of plant gas exchange and water transpiration. Through forward genetics, we screened a mutant rice stomata developmental defect 1 (rsd1-1) with decreased stomatal density and clustered stomata in rice (Oryza sativa). After the first asymmetric division, some of the larger sister cells undergo an extra asymmetric division to produce a small cell neighboring guard mother cell. Some of these small cells develop into stomata, which leads to stomatal clustering, and the rest arrested or developed into pavement cell. After map-based cloning, we found the protein encoded by this gene containing DUF630 and DUF632 domains. Evolutionary analysis showed that the DUF630/632 gene family differentiated earlier in land plants. It was found that the deletion of RSD1 would lead to the disorder of gene expression regarding stomatal development, especially the expression of stomatal density and distribution 1 (OsSDD1). Through the construction of OsSDD1 deletion mutants by CRISPR-Cas9, we found that, similar to rsd1 mutants, the ossdd1 mutants have clustered stomata and extra small cells adjacent to the stomata. OsSDD1 and RSD1 are both required for inhibiting ectopic asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) and clustered stomata. By dehydration stress assay, the decreased stomatal density of rsd1 mutants enhanced their dehydration avoidance. This study characterized the functions of RSD1 and OsSDD1 in rice stomatal development. Our findings will be helpful in developing drought-resistant crops through controlling the stomatal density.
