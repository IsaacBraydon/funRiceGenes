NA	Down-regulation of a LBD-like gene, OsIG1, leads to occurrence of unusual double ovules and developmental abnormalities of various floral organs and megagametophyte in rice	2014	J Exp Bot	Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Bio-resource and Eco-environment, College of Life Science, State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China.	The indeterminate gametophyte1 (ig1) mutation was first characterized to modulate female gametophyte development in maize (Zea mays). However, the function of its rice orthologue, OsIG1, remains unknown. For this, we first analysed OsIG1 localization from differential tissues in rice. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and histochemical staining results demonstrated that the expression signal of OsIG1 was strongly detected in young inflorescence, moderately in mature flower and weakly in leaf. Furthermore, RNA in situ hybridization analyses exhibited that OsIG1 was strongly expressed in inflorescence meristems, floral meristems, empty-glume- and floret- primordia, especially in the primordia of stamens and immature ovules, and the micropylar side of the mature ovary. In OsIG1-RNAi lines, wrinkled blade formation was accompanied by increased leaf inclination angle. Cross-section further showed that the number of bulliform cells located between the vasculatures was significantly increased, indicating that OsIG1 is involved in division and differentiation of bulliform cell and lateral growth during leaf development. OsIG1-RNAi suppression lines showed pleiotropic phenotypes, including degenerated palea, glume-like features and open hull. In addition, a single OsIG1-RNAi floret is characterized by frequently developing double ovules with abnormal embryo sac development. Additionally, down-regulation of OsIG1 differentially affected the expression of genes associated with the floral organ development including EG1, OsMADS6 and OsMADS1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that OsIG1 plays an essential role in the regulation of empty-glume identity, floral organ number control and female gametophyte development in rice.
NA	Characterization of a new rice OsMADS1 null mutant generated by homologous recombination-mediated gene targeting	2021	Planta	Department of Plant Biotechnology, School of Biotechnology, Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, 625021, India.	A new, stable, null mutant of OsMADS1 generated by homologous recombination-based gene targeting in an indica rice confirms its regulatory role for floral meristem identity, its determinate development and floral organ differentiation. OsMADS1, an E-class MADS-box gene, is an important regulator of rice flower development. Studies of several partial loss-of-function and knockdown mutants show varied floret organ defects and degrees of meristem indeterminacy. The developmental consequences of a true null mutant on floret meristem identity, its determinate development and differentiation of grass-specific organs such as the lemma and palea remain unclear. In this study, we generated an OsMADS1 null mutant by homologous recombination-mediated gene targeting by inserting a selectable marker gene (hpt) in OsMADS1 and replacing parts of its cis-regulatory and coding sequences. A binary vector was constructed with diphtheria toxin A chain gene (DT-A) as a negative marker to eliminate random integrations and the hpt marker for positive selection of homologous recombination. Precise disruption of the endogenous OsMADS1 locus in the rice genome was confirmed by Southern hybridization. The homozygous osmads1ko null mutant displayed severe defects in all floral organs including the lemma and palea. We also noticed striking instances of floral reversion to inflorescence and vegetative states which has not been reported for other mutant alleles of OsMADS1 and further reinforces the role of OsMADS1 in controlling floral meristem determinacy. Our data suggest, OsMADS1 commits and maintains determinate floret development by regulating floral meristem termination, carpel and ovule differentiation genes (OsMADS58, OsMADS13) while its modulation of genes such as OsMADS15, OsIG1 and OsMADS32 could be relevant in the differentiation and development of palea. Further, our study provides an important perspective on developmental stage-dependent modulation of some OsMADS1 target genes.
