Plant Physiol.-2009-Manosalva-286-96.pdf	A germin-like protein gene family functions as a complex quantitative trait locus conferring broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice	2009	Plant Physiol	Bioagricultural Sciences and Pest Management, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523-1177, USA.	Plant disease resistance governed by quantitative trait loci (QTL) is predicted to be effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens and long lasting. Use of these QTL to improve crop species, however, is hindered because the genes contributing to the trait are not known. Five disease resistance QTL that colocalized with defense response genes were accumulated by marker-aided selection to develop blast-resistant varieties. One advanced backcross line carrying the major-effect QTL on chromosome (chr) 8, which included a cluster of 12 germin-like protein (OsGLP) gene members, exhibited resistance to rice (Oryza sativa) blast disease over 14 cropping seasons. To determine if OsGLP members contribute to resistance and if the resistance was broad spectrum, a highly conserved portion of the OsGLP coding region was used as an RNA interference trigger to silence a few to all expressed chr 8 OsGLP family members. Challenge with two different fungal pathogens (causal agents of rice blast and sheath blight diseases) revealed that as more chr 8 OsGLP genes were suppressed, disease susceptibility of the plants increased. Of the 12 chr 8 OsGLPs, one clustered subfamily (OsGER4) contributed most to resistance. The similarities of sequence, gene organization, and roles in disease resistance of GLP family members in rice and other cereals, including barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), suggest that resistance contributed by the chr 8 OsGLP is a broad-spectrum, basal mechanism conserved among the Gramineae. Natural selection may have preserved a whole gene family to provide a stepwise, flexible defense response to pathogen invasion.
s-2006-924561.pdf	GER1, a GDSL motif-encoding gene from rice is a novel early light- and jasmonate-induced gene	2007	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Botanisches Institut 1, Technische Universitat Karlsruhe, Germany. michael.riemann@bio.uni-karlsruhe.de	The reaction of the rice mutant HEBIBA differs from that of wild-type rice in that the mutant responds inversely to red light and is defective in the light-triggered biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA). Using the wild type and the HEBIBA mutant of rice in a differential display screen, we attempted to identify genes that act in or near the convergence point of light and JA signalling. We isolated specifically regulated DNA fragments from approximately 10 000 displayed bands, and identified a new early light- and JA-induced gene. This gene encodes an enzyme containing a GDSL motif, showing 38 % identity at the amino acid level to lipase Arab-1 in Arabidopsis thaliana. The GDSL CONTAINING ENZYME RICE 1 gene (GER1) is rapidly induced by both red (R) and far-red (FR) light and by JA. The results are discussed with respect to a possible role for GER1 as a negative regulator of coleoptile elongation in the context of recent findings on the impact of JA on light signalling.
