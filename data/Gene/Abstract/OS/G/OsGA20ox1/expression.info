Symbol	Expression
OsGA20ox1|GNP1	 We propose that cytokinin activity increased due to a KNOX-mediated transcriptional feedback loop resulting from the higher GNP1 transcript levels, in turn leading to increased expression of the GA catabolism genes GA2oxs and reduced GA1 and GA3 accumulation
OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	 Meanwhile, the expression of GA synthesis-related gene OsGA20ox1 was downregulated, whereas the expression of GA inactivation-related genes was upregulated in ipa1-NIL seeds
