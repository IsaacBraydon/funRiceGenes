OsGA20ox1	 ga 	A role of OsGA20ox1 , encoding an isoform of gibberellin 20-oxidase, for regulation of plant stature in rice	 Analysis of mRNA and the endogenous GAs reveal that biologically active GA level is increased by up-regulation of the OsGA20ox1 gene in B142
OsGA20ox1	gibberellin	OsGA20ox1, a candidate gene for a major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice	 Within this mapped region, we identified the gene OsGA20ox1, which is related to gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis
OsGA20ox1	dwarf	The rice GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, encoding a B3 domain transcriptional repressor, regulates seed germination and seedling development by integrating GA and carbohydrate metabolism	 Consistent with the dwarf phenotype of gd1, expression of the gibberelic acid (GA) inactivation gene OsGA2ox3 is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of GA biosynthetic genes including OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2 and OsGA3ox2 in gd1, resulting in a decreased endogenous GA(4) level
OsGA20ox1	seedling	OsGA20ox1, a candidate gene for a major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice	 These results indicate that OsGA20ox1 is a strong candidate gene for major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice|OsGA20ox1, a candidate gene for a major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice
OsGA20ox1	gibberellin	A role of OsGA20ox1 , encoding an isoform of gibberellin 20-oxidase, for regulation of plant stature in rice	A role of OsGA20ox1 , encoding an isoform of gibberellin 20-oxidase, for regulation of plant stature in rice
OsGA20ox1	 ga 	The rice GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, encoding a B3 domain transcriptional repressor, regulates seed germination and seedling development by integrating GA and carbohydrate metabolism	 Consistent with the dwarf phenotype of gd1, expression of the gibberelic acid (GA) inactivation gene OsGA2ox3 is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of GA biosynthetic genes including OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2 and OsGA3ox2 in gd1, resulting in a decreased endogenous GA(4) level
