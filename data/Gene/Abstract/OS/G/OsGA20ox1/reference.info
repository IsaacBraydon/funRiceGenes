Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seedling vigor were identified using 250 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between two japonica rice cultivars Kakehashi and Dunghan Shali. Seedling heights measured at 14 days after sowing were 20.3 and 29.4 cm for Kakehashi and Dunghan Shali, respectively. For the RILs, the height ranged from 14.1 to 31.7 cm. Four putative QTLs associated with seedling height were detected. qPHS3-2, the major QTL that was located on the long arm of chromosome 3, accounted for 26.2 % of the phenotypic variance. Using progeny of the near isogenic lines (NILs) produced by the backcross introduction of a chromosome segment carrying this major QTL into an elite cultivar Iwatekko, we fine-mapped qPHS3-2 to a 81-kb interval between two markers, ID_CAPS_01 and RM16227. Within this mapped region, we identified the gene OsGA20ox1, which is related to gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis. The relative expression levels of GA20ox1 in seedlings of Dunghan Shali and NILs were higher than that of Iwatekko. Concomitantly, the amount of endogenous active GA was higher in Dunghan Shali and the NILs compared to the level detected in Iwatekko. These results indicate that OsGA20ox1 is a strong candidate gene for major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice.
10.1007-s11103-004-1692-y.pdf	A role of OsGA20ox1 , encoding an isoform of gibberellin 20-oxidase, for regulation of plant stature in rice	2004	Plant Mol Biol	Laboratory of Bio-control, Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Niigata University, 2-8050 Ikarashi, Niigata 950-2181, Japan.	Gibberellin (GA) 20-oxidase (GA20ox) is a key enzyme that normally catalyzes the penultimate steps in GA biosynthesis. One of the GA20ox genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.), OsGA20ox2 ( SD1 ), is well known as the "Green Revolution gene", and loss-of function mutation in this locus causes semi-dwarfism. Another GA20ox gene, OsGA20ox1, has also been identified, but its contribution to plant stature has remained unclear because no suitable mutants have been available. We isolated a mutant, B142, tagged with a T-DNA containing three CaMV 35S promoters, which showed a tall, GA-overproduction phenotype. The final stature of the B142 mutant reflects internode overgrowth and is approximately twice that of its wild-type parent. This mutant responds to application of both GA3 and a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, indicating that it is a novel tall mutant of rice distinct from GA signaling mutants such as slr1 . The integrated T-DNAs, which contain three CaMV 35S promoters, are located upstream of the OsGA20ox1 open reading frame (ORF) in the B142 mutant genome. Analysis of mRNA and the endogenous GAs reveal that biologically active GA level is increased by up-regulation of the OsGA20ox1 gene in B142. Introduction of OsGA20ox1 cDNA driven by 35S promoter into the wild type phenocopies the morphological characteristics of B142. These results indicate that the elongated phenotype of the B142 mutant is caused by up-regulation of the OsGA20ox1 gene. Moreover, the final stature of rice was reduced by specific suppression of the OsGA20ox1 gene expression. This result indicates that not only OsGA20ox2 but also OsGA20ox1 affects plant stature.
Mol. Plant-2008-Yang-528-37.pdf	Altered disease development in the eui mutants and Eui overexpressors indicates that gibberellins negatively regulate rice basal disease resistance	2008	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.	Gibberellins (GAs) form a group of important plant tetracyclic diterpenoid hormones that are involved in many aspects of plant growth and development. Emerging evidence implicates that GAs also play roles in stress responses. However, the role of GAs in biotic stress is largely unknown. Here, we report that knockout or overexpression of the Elongated uppermost internode (Eui) gene encoding a GA deactivating enzyme compromises or increases, respectively, disease resistance to bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oyrzae) and rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae). Exogenous application of GA(3) and the inhibitor of GA synthesis (uniconazol) could increase disease susceptibility and resistance, respectively, to bacterial blight. Similarly, uniconazol restored disease resistance of the eui mutant and GA(3) decreased disease resistance of the Eui overexpressors to bacterial blight. Therefore, the change of resistance attributes to GA levels. In consistency with this, the GA metabolism genes OsGA20ox2 and OsGA2ox1 were down-regulated during pathogen challenge. We also found that PR1a induction was enhanced but the SA level was decreased in the Eui overexpressor, while the JA level was reduced in the eui mutant. Together, our current study indicates that GAs play a negative role in rice basal disease resistance, with EUI as a positive modulator through regulating the level of bioactive GAs.
tpj12209.pdf	The rice GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, encoding a B3 domain transcriptional repressor, regulates seed germination and seedling development by integrating GA and carbohydrate metabolism	2013	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research-Beijing, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	It has been shown that seed development is regulated by a network of transcription factors in Arabidopsis including LEC1 (LEAFY COTYLEDON1), L1L (LEC1-like) and the B3 domain factors LEC2, FUS3 (FUSCA3) and ABI3 (ABA-INSENSITIVE3); however, molecular and genetic regulation of seed development in cereals is poorly understood. To understand seed development and seed germination in cereals, a large-scale screen was performed using our T-DNA mutant population, and a mutant germination-defective1 (gd1) was identified. In addition to the severe germination defect, the gd1 mutant also shows a dwarf phenotype and abnormal flower development. Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed that GD1 encodes a B3 domain-containing transcription factor with repression activity. Consistent with the dwarf phenotype of gd1, expression of the gibberelic acid (GA) inactivation gene OsGA2ox3 is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of GA biosynthetic genes including OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2 and OsGA3ox2 in gd1, resulting in a decreased endogenous GA(4) level. Exogenous application of GA not only induced GD1 expression, but also partially rescued the dwarf phenotype of gd1. Furthermore, GD1 binds to the promoter of OsLFL1, a LEC2/FUS3-like gene of rice, via an RY element, leading to significant up-regulation of OsLFL1 and a large subset of seed maturation genes in the gd1 mutant. Plants over-expressing OsLFL1 partly mimic the gd1 mutant. In addition, expression of GD1 was induced under sugar treatment, and the contents of starch and soluble sugar are altered in the gd1 mutant. These data indicate that GD1 participates directly or indirectly in regulating GA and carbohydrate homeostasis, and further regulates rice seed germination and seedling development.
NA	The QTL GNP1 Encodes GA20ox1, Which Increases Grain Number and Yield by Increasing Cytokinin Activity in Rice Panicle Meristems.	2016	PLoS Genet	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, CAS Centre for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences and Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics &amp; Development, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology &amp; Ecology, Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academic of Sciences, Shanghai, China.	Cytokinins and gibberellins (GAs) play antagonistic roles in regulating reproductive meristem activity. Cytokinins have positive effects on meristem activity and maintenance. During inflorescence meristem development, cytokinin biosynthesis is activated via a KNOX-mediated pathway. Increased cytokinin activity leads to higher grain number, whereas GAs negatively affect meristem activity. The GA biosynthesis genes GA20oxs are negatively regulated by KNOX proteins. KNOX proteins function as modulators, balancing cytokinin and GA activity in the meristem. However, little is known about the crosstalk among cytokinin and GA regulators together with KNOX proteins and how KNOX-mediated dynamic balancing of hormonal activity functions. Through map-based cloning of QTLs, we cloned a GA biosynthesis gene, Grain Number per Panicle1 (GNP1), which encodes rice GA20ox1. The grain number and yield of NIL-GNP1TQ were significantly higher than those of isogenic control (Lemont). Sequence variations in its promoter region increased the levels of GNP1 transcripts, which were enriched in the apical regions of inflorescence meristems in NIL-GNP1TQ. We propose that cytokinin activity increased due to a KNOX-mediated transcriptional feedback loop resulting from the higher GNP1 transcript levels, in turn leading to increased expression of the GA catabolism genes GA2oxs and reduced GA1 and GA3 accumulation. This rebalancing process increased cytokinin activity, thereby increasing grain number and grain yield in rice. These findings uncover important, novel roles of GAs in rice florescence meristem development and provide new insights into the crosstalk between cytokinin and GA underlying development process.
NA	Rice SDSFL1 plays a critical role in the regulation of plant structure through the control of different phytohormones and altered cell structure.	2018	J Plant Physiol	Department of Agronomy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Semi-dwarfism is one of the most important agronomic traits for many cereal crops. In the present study, a mutant with semi-dwarf and short flag leaf 1, sdsfl1, was identified and characterized. The sdsfl1 mutant demonstrated some distinguished structural alterations, including shorter plant height and flag leaf length, increased tiller numbers and flag leaf width, and decreased panicle length compared with those of wild type (WT). Genetic analysis suggested that the mutant traits were completely controlled by a single recessive gene. The SDSFL1 gene was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 3 within a region of 44.6<U+2009>kb between InDel markers A3P8.3 and A3P8.4. The DNA sequence analysis revealed that there was only a T to C substitution in the coding region of LOC_Os03g63970, resulting in the substitution of Tryptophan (Try) to Arginine (Arg) and encoding a GA 20 oxidase 1 protein of 372 amino acid residues. Photosynthesis analysis showed that the photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), and intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) were significantly increased in sdsfl1. Chlorophyll a (Chl a), total Chl, and carotenoid contents were significantly increased in sdsfl1 compared with those in WT. sdsfl1 carried a reduced level of GA3 but reacted to exogenously applied gibberellins (GA). Moreover, the levels of abscisic acid (ABA), indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), and salicylic acid (SA) were notably improved in sdsfl1, whereas there was no noteworthy change in jasmonic acid (JA). The results thus offer a visible foundation for the molecular and physiological analysis of the SDSFL1 gene, which might participate in various functional pathways for controlling plant height and leaf length in rice breeding.
NA	Natural Sequence Variations and Combinations of GNP1 and NAL1 Determine the Grain Number per Panicle in Rice.	2020	Rice (N Y)	Rice Research Institute, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, 110866, Liaoning, China.	The grain number per panicle (GNP), which is one of three grain yield components, is an important trait for the genetic improvement of rice. Although the NAL1 and GNP1 genes regulating the rice GNP and grain yield have been cloned, their allelic diversity, functional differences in rice germplasms, and effects of their combination on GNP and grain yield remain unclear.Based on DNA sequences of these two genes in 198 cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and 8-10 wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) germplasms, 16 and 14 haplotypes were identified for NAL1 and GNP1, respectively. The NAL1 gene had the strongest effects on GNP in indica (xian) and japonica (geng) subpopulations. In contrast, GNP1 had no significant effects in the geng subpopulation and was rare in the xian background, in which the superior GNP1 allele (GNP1-6) was detected in only 4.0% of the 198 germplasms. Compared with the transgenic lines with GNP1 or NAL1, the transgenic lines with both genes had a higher GNP (15.5%-25.4% and 11.6%-15.9% higher, respectively) and grain yield (5.7%-9.0% and 8.3%-12.3% higher, respectively) across 3<U+2009>years. The two genes combined in the introgression lines in Lemont background resulted in especially favorable effects on the GNP.Our results indicated that the GNP1 and NAL1 exhibited obvious differentiation and their combinations can significantly increase the grain yield in geng rice cultivars. These observations provide insights into the molecular basis of the GNP and may be useful for rice breeding of high yield potential by pyramiding GNP1 and NAL1.
NA	Pleiotropic Effect of GNP1 Underlying Grain Number per Panicle on Sink, Source and Flow in Rice 	2020	Front Plant Sci	  Rice Research Institute, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China.	Rice yield potential is largely determined by the balance among source capacity, sink strength, and flow fluency. Our previous study indicated that the gene GNP1 encoding gibberellin biosynthesis gene GA20ox1 affects grain number per panicle (GNP) in rice, thus resulting in increase of grain yield. To clarify GNP1 effect on sink, source and flow in regulating rice grain yield, we compared Lemont, a japonica (geng) cultivar, with its near-isogenic line (NIL-GNP1 TQ) in Lemont background with introgression of the allele at GNP1 from Teqing, a high-yielding indica (xian) cultivar. NIL-GNP1 TQ exhibited averagely 32.8% more GNP than Lemont with the compensation by reduced seed setting rate, panicle number and single-grain weight. However, NIL-GNP1 TQ still produced averagely 7.2% higher grain yield than Lemont in two years, mainly attributed to significantly more filled grain number per panicle, and greater vascular system contributing to photoassimilates transport to spikelets. The significantly decreased grain weight of superior spikelets (SS) in NIL-GNP1 TQ was ascribed to a significant decrease of grain size while the significantly decreased grain weight of inferior spikelets (IS) ascribed to both grain size and poor grain-filling as compared with Lemont. The low activities of key enzymes of carbon metabolism might account for the poor grain-filling in IS, which resulted in more unfilled grains or small grain bulk density in NIL-GNP1 TQ. In addition, low seed setting rate and grain weight of IS in NIL-GNP1 TQ might be partially resulted from significantly lower carbohydrate accumulation in culms and leaf sheath before heading compared with Lemont. Our results indicated that significantly increased GNP from introgression of GNP1 TQ into Lemont did not highly significantly improve grain yield of NIL-GNP1 TQ as expected, due primarily to significant low sink activities in IS and possible insufficient source supply which didn't fully meet the increased sink capacity. The results provided useful information for improving rice yield potential through reasonably introgressing or pyramiding the favorable alleles underlying source-related or panicle number traits by marker-assisted selection.
