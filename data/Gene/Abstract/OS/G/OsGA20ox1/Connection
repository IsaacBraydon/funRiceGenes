OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	sd1|GA20ox2	A role of OsGA20ox1 , encoding an isoform of gibberellin 20-oxidase, for regulation of plant stature in rice	This result indicates that not only OsGA20ox2 but also OsGA20ox1 affects plant stature
d18|OsGA3ox2	OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	The rice GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, encoding a B3 domain transcriptional repressor, regulates seed germination and seedling development by integrating GA and carbohydrate metabolism	Consistent with the dwarf phenotype of gd1, expression of the gibberelic acid (GA) inactivation gene OsGA2ox3 is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of GA biosynthetic genes including OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2 and OsGA3ox2 in gd1, resulting in a decreased endogenous GA(4) level
