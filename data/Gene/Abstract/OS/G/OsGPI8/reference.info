Attachment of glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) to the C-termini of proteins is one of the most common posttranslational modifications in eukaryotic cells. GPI8/PIG-K is the catalytic subunit of the GPI transamidase complex catalyzing the transfer en bloc GPI to proteins. In this study, a T-DNA insertional mutant of rice with temperature-dependent drooping and fragile (df) shoots phenotype was isolated. The insertion site of the T-DNA fragment was 879 bp downstream of the stop codon of the OsGPI8 gene, which caused introns retention in the gene transcripts, especially at higher temperatures. A complementation test confirmed that this change in the OsGPI8 transcripts was responsible for the mutant phenotype. Compared to control plants, internodes of the df mutant showed a thinner shell with a reduced cell number in the transverse direction, and an inhomogeneous secondary wall layer in bundle sheath cells, while many sclerenchyma cells at the tops of the main veins of df leaves were shrunken and their walls were thinner. The df plants also displayed a major reduction in cellulose and lignin content in both culms and leaves. Our data indicate that GPI anchor proteins play important roles in biosynthesis and accumulation of cell wall material, cell shape, and cell division in rice.
