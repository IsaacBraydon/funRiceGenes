NA	Sporophytic control of anther development and male fertility by glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate translocator 1 (OsGPT1) in rice	2021	J Genet Genomics	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, China.	Coordination between the sporophytic tissue and the gametic pollen within anthers is tightly controlled to achieve the optimal pollen fitness. Glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate translocator (GPT) transports glucose-6-phosphate, a key precursor of starch and/or fatty acid biosynthesis, into plastids. Here, we report the functional characterization of OsGPT1 in the rice anther development and pollen fertility. Pollen grains from homozygous osgpt1 mutant plants fail to accumulate starch granules, resulting in pollen sterility. Genetic analyses reveal a sporophytic effect for this mutation. OsGPT1 is highly expressed in the tapetal layer of rice anther. Degeneration of the tapetum, an important process to provide cellular contents to support pollen development, is impeded in osgpt1 plants. In addition, defective intine and exine are observed in the pollen from osgpt1 plants. Expression levels of multiple genes that are important to tapetum degeneration or pollen wall formation are significantly decreased in osgpt1 anthers. Previously, we reported that AtGPT1 plays a gametic function in the accumulation of lipid bodies in Arabidopsis pollen. This report highlights a sporophytic role of OsGPT1 in the tapetum degeneration and pollen development. The divergent functions of OsGPT1 and AtGPT1 in pollen development might be a result of their independent evolution after monocots and dicots diverged.
