We have isolated full-length cDNAs for two distinct isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), designated OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 from a rice shoot cDNA library. Open reading frames found in OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 cDNAs encode putative proteins of 501 (56.7 kDa) and 500 amino acids (55.6 kDa), respectively. They show 69% identity to each other and 67-78% identity to dicotyledonous counterpart sequences determined so far. Comparative analysis of relevant genomic clones obtained from the rice genomic library with these cDNAs as probes demonstrated that the number and sizes of introns deduced for these two genes differ considerably. Interestingly, in the regions in the putative gene products corresponding to the C-terminal 30-amino-acid peptide known as the calmodulin-binding domain of plant GADs, OsGAD1 possesses a typical motif, while OsGAD2 contains several substitutions of amino acids that contribute strongly to the binding of calmodulin (CaM). An in vitro CaM-binding assay of these proteins over-expressed in Escherichia coli revealed that OsGAD1 can in fact bind specifically to bovine CaM but OsGAD2 cannot. RNA analysis showed that transcripts of OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 were present in all tissues examined, but their expression was differentially regulated, at least in roots and maturing seeds.

It is understood to have a potentially anti-hypertensive effect in mammals. GABA is synthesized from glutamate by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). In plants, GAD is regulated via its calmodulin-binding domain (CaMBD) by Ca(2+)/CaM. We have previously reported that a C-terminal truncated version of one of the five rice GAD isoforms, GAD2DeltaC, revealed higher enzymatic activity in vitro and that its over-expression resulted in exceptionally high GABA accumulation (Akama and Takaiwa, J Exp Bot 58:2699-2607, 2007). In this study, GAD2DeltaC, under the control of the rice glutelin promoter (GluB-1), was introduced into rice cells via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to produce transgenic rice lines. Analysis of the free amino acid content of rice grains revealed up to about a 30-fold higher level of GABA than in non-transformed rice grains. There were also very high levels of various free protein amino acids in the seeds. GABA-enriched rice grains were milled to a fine powder for oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs). Six weeks of administration showed that transgenic rice brings about a 20 mmHg decrease in blood pressure in two different kinds of SHRs, while there was no significant hypotensive effect in WKYs. These results suggest an alternative way to control and/or cure hypertension in humans with GABA-enriched rice as part of a common daily diet.
J. Exp. Bot.-2007-Akama-2699-707.pdf	C-terminal extension of rice glutamate decarboxylase (OsGAD2) functions as an autoinhibitory domain and overexpression of a truncated mutant results in the accumulation of extremely high levels of GABA in plant cells	2007	J Exp Bot	Department of Biological Science, Shimane University, Nishikawatsu 1060, Matsue, Shimane, Japan. akama@life.shimane-u.ac.jp	Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) converts L-glutamate to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is a non-protein amino acid present in all organisms. Plant GADs carry a C-terminal extension that binds to Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM) to modulate enzyme activity. However, rice possesses two distinct types of GAD, OsGAD1 and OsGAD2. Although they both have a C-terminal extension, the former peptide contains an authentic CaM-binding domain (CaMBD), which is common to dicotyledonous plants, while the latter does not. Therefore, the role of the C-terminal extension in functional expression of OsGAD2 was investigated. An in vitro enzyme assay using recombinant OsGAD2 proteins revealed low activity in the presence or absence of Ca(2+)/CaM. However, a truncated version of GAD2 (OsGAD2DeltaC) had over 40-fold higher activity than wild-type GAD at physiological pH. These two DNA constructs were introduced simultaneously into rice calli via Agrobacterium to establish transgenic cell lines. Free amino acids were isolated from several lines for each construct to determine GABA content. Calli overexpressing OsGAD2 and OsGAD2DeltaC had about 6-fold and 100-fold the GABA content of wild-type calli, respectively. Regenerated OsGAD2DeltaC rice plants had aberrant phenotypes such as dwarfism, etiolated leaves, and sterility. These data suggest that the C-terminal extension of OsGAD2 plays a role as a strong autoinhibitory domain, and that truncation of this domain causes the enzyme to act constitutively, with higher activity both in vitro and in vivo.
