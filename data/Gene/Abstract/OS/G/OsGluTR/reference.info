An alanine to valine mutation of glutamyl-tRNA reductase&#x27;s 510th amino acid improves 5-aminolevulinic acid synthesis in rice. 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is the common precursor of all tetrapyrroles and plays an important role in plant growth regulation. ALA is synthesized from glutamate, catalyzed by glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS), glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR), and glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase (GSAT). In Arabidopsis, ALA synthesis is the rate-limiting step in tetrapyrrole production via GluTR post-translational regulations. In rice, mutations of GluTR and GSAT homologs are known to confer chlorophyll deficiency phenotypes; however, the enzymatic activity of rice GluRS, GluTR, and GSAT and the post-translational regulation of rice GluTR have not been investigated experimentally. We have demonstrated that a suppressor mutation in rice partially reverts the xantha trait. In the present study, we first determine that the suppressor mutation results from a G → A nucleotide substitution of OsGluTR (and an A → V change of its 510th amino acid). Protein homology modeling and molecular docking show that the OsGluTR(A510V) mutation increases its substrate binding. We then demonstrate that the OsGluTR(A510V) mutation increases ALA synthesis in Escherichia coli without affecting its interaction with OsFLU. We further explore homologous genes encoding GluTR across 193 plant species and find that the amino acid (A) is 100% conserved at the position, suggesting its critical role in GluTR. Thus, we demonstrate that the gain-of-function OsGluTR(A510V) mutation underlies suppression of the xantha trait, experimentally proves the enzymatic activity of rice GluRS, GluTR, and GSAT in ALA synthesis, and uncovers conservation of the alanine corresponding to the 510th amino acid of OsGluTR across plant species.
