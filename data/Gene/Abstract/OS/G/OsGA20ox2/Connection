OsGA20ox2	Pb1	Loss of Function of OsFBX267 and OsGA20ox2 in Rice Promotes Early Maturing and Semi-Dwarfism in ¦Ã-Irradiated IWP and Genome-Edited Pusa Basmati-1	 The loss of function of OsGA20ox2 and OsFBX267 in WP-22-2 resulted in reduced plant height as well as early flowering, and the same has been confirmed by editing OsGA20ox2 in the rice variety Pusa Basmati1 (PB1) using the CRISPR-Cas9 approach
OsGA20ox2	Pb1	Loss of Function of OsFBX267 and OsGA20ox2 in Rice Promotes Early Maturing and Semi-Dwarfism in ¦Ã-Irradiated IWP and Genome-Edited Pusa Basmati-1	 The targeted editing of OsGA20ox2 in PB1 conferred shorter plant height to the edited lines compared with the wild type
