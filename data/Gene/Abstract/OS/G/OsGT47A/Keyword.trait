OsGT47A	stem	Functional conservation of the glycosyltransferase gene GT47A in the monocot rice.	 Expression pattern analysis showed that the OsGT47A gene is highly expressed in the rice stem
OsGT47A	growth	Functional conservation of the glycosyltransferase gene GT47A in the monocot rice.	 Overexpression of OsGT47A in the irx10 irx10L double mutant rescued the plant growth phenotype and restored secondary wall thickness
OsGT47A	plant growth	Functional conservation of the glycosyltransferase gene GT47A in the monocot rice.	 Overexpression of OsGT47A in the irx10 irx10L double mutant rescued the plant growth phenotype and restored secondary wall thickness
