OsGELP115	anther	GDSL esterase/lipases OsGELP34 and OsGELP110/OsGELP115 are essential for rice pollen development.	 OsGELP34 is distant from OsGELP110 and OsGELP115 in sequence, and osgelp34 and osgelp110/osgelp115 mutants were different in anther morphology despite both were male sterile
OsGELP115	sterile	GDSL esterase/lipases OsGELP34 and OsGELP110/OsGELP115 are essential for rice pollen development.	 Individual knockout of OsGELP110 and OsGELP115 did not affect the plant fertility, but double knockout of both genes altered the exine structure and rendered the plant male sterile
OsGELP115	sterile	GDSL esterase/lipases OsGELP34 and OsGELP110/OsGELP115 are essential for rice pollen development.	 OsGELP34 is distant from OsGELP110 and OsGELP115 in sequence, and osgelp34 and osgelp110/osgelp115 mutants were different in anther morphology despite both were male sterile
