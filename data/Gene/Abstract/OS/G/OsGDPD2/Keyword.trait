OsGDPD2	Pi	A Novel Glycerophosphodiester Phosphodiesterase Improves Phosphate Deficiency Tolerance.	 Here, we show that OsGDPD2 is a Pi deficiency responsive gene which is transcriptionally regulated by OsPHR2
OsGDPD2	Pi	A Novel Glycerophosphodiester Phosphodiesterase Improves Phosphate Deficiency Tolerance.	 Conversely, silencing of OsGDPD2 led to decreased GDPD activity and Pi content
OsGDPD2	Pi	A Novel Glycerophosphodiester Phosphodiesterase Improves Phosphate Deficiency Tolerance.	 Thus, present study provides insights into novel physiological roles of OsGDPD2 in low Pi acclimation in rice
