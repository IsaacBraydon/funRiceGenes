Plant beta-1,3-glucanases are involved in plant defense and development. In rice (Oryza sativa), 14 genes encoding putative beta-1,3-glucanases have been isolated and sequenced. However, only limited information is available on the function of these beta-1,3-glucanase genes. In this study, we report a detailed functional characterization of one of these genes, Osg1. Osg1 encodes a glucanase carrying no C-terminal extension. Osg1 was found to be expressed throughout the plant and highly expressed in florets, leaf sheaths, and leaf blades. Investigations using real-time PCR, immunocytochemical analysis, and a GUS-reporter gene driven by the Osg1 promoter indicated that Osg1 was mainly expressed at the late meiosis, early microspore, and middle microspore stages in the florets. To elucidate the role of Osg1, we suppressed expression of the Osg1 gene by RNA interference in transgenic rice. The silencing of Osg1 resulted in male sterility. The pollen mother cells appeared to be normal in Osg1-RI plants, but callose degradation was disrupted around the microspores in the anther locules of the Osg1-RI plants at the early microspore stage. Consequently, the release of the young microspores into the anther locules was delayed, and the microspores began to degenerate later. These results provide evidence that Osg1 is essential for timely callose degradation in the process of tetrad dissolution.
66_1403.pdf	Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a Novel β-1,3-Glucanase Gene from Rice	2014	Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry	Plant Physiology Laboratory, National Agricultural Research Center for Tohoku Region	Beta-1,3-glucanases are referred to as pathogenesis-related proteins and they are also involved in several developmental processes. We isolated a cDNA for β-1,3-glucanase from rice anther and named it Oryza sativa glucanase 1 (Osg1). Phylogenetic analysis showed that Osg1 belonged to monocotyledonous endo-β-1,3-glucanase subgroup A. RT-PCR analysis revealed that Osg1 transcripts were present in leaves, roots, and anthers.
NA	Identification of candidate genes controlling chilling tolerance of rice in the cold region at the booting stage by BSA-Seq and RNA-Seq	2020	R Soc Open Sci	Rice Research Institute of Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jiamusi 154026, People's Republic of China.	Rice is sensitive to low temperatures, specifically at the booting stage. Chilling tolerance of rice is a quantitative trait loci that is governed by multiple genes, and thus, its precise identification through the conventional methods is an arduous task. In this study, we investigated the candidate genes related to chilling tolerance at the booting stage of rice. The F2 population was derived from Longjing25 (chilling-tolerant) and Longjing11 (chilling-sensitive) cross. Two bulked segregant analysis pools were constructed. A 0.82 Mb region containing 98 annotated genes on chromosomes 6 and 9 was recognized as the candidate region associated with chilling tolerance of rice at the booting stage. Transcriptomic analysis of Longjing25 and Longjing11 revealed 50 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) on the candidate intervals. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed. Nine pathways were found to be enriched, which contained 10 DEGs. A total of four genes had different expression patterns or levels between Longjing25 and Longjing11. Four out of the 10 DEGs were considered as potential candidate genes for chilling tolerance. This study will assist in the cloning of the candidate genes responsible for chilling tolerance and molecular breeding of rice for the development of chilling-tolerant rice varieties.
