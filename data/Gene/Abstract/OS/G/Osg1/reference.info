Plant beta-1,3-glucanases are involved in plant defense and development. In rice (Oryza sativa), 14 genes encoding putative beta-1,3-glucanases have been isolated and sequenced. However, only limited information is available on the function of these beta-1,3-glucanase genes. In this study, we report a detailed functional characterization of one of these genes, Osg1. Osg1 encodes a glucanase carrying no C-terminal extension. Osg1 was found to be expressed throughout the plant and highly expressed in florets, leaf sheaths, and leaf blades. Investigations using real-time PCR, immunocytochemical analysis, and a GUS-reporter gene driven by the Osg1 promoter indicated that Osg1 was mainly expressed at the late meiosis, early microspore, and middle microspore stages in the florets. To elucidate the role of Osg1, we suppressed expression of the Osg1 gene by RNA interference in transgenic rice. The silencing of Osg1 resulted in male sterility. The pollen mother cells appeared to be normal in Osg1-RI plants, but callose degradation was disrupted around the microspores in the anther locules of the Osg1-RI plants at the early microspore stage. Consequently, the release of the young microspores into the anther locules was delayed, and the microspores began to degenerate later. These results provide evidence that Osg1 is essential for timely callose degradation in the process of tetrad dissolution.

We isolated a cDNA for β-1,3-glucanase from rice anther and named it Oryza sativa glucanase 1 (Osg1). Phylogenetic analysis showed that Osg1 belonged to monocotyledonous endo-β-1,3-glucanase subgroup A. RT-PCR analysis revealed that Osg1 transcripts were present in leaves, roots, and anthers.
