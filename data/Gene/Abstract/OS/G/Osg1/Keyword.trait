Osg1	anther	Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a Novel β-1,3-Glucanase Gene from Rice	 We isolated a cDNA for β-1,3-glucanase from rice anther and named it Oryza sativa glucanase 1 (Osg1)| RT-PCR analysis revealed that Osg1 transcripts were present in leaves, roots, and anthers
Osg1	leaf	A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development	 Osg1 was found to be expressed throughout the plant and highly expressed in florets, leaf sheaths, and leaf blades
Osg1	sheath	A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development	 Osg1 was found to be expressed throughout the plant and highly expressed in florets, leaf sheaths, and leaf blades
Osg1	anther	A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development	 The pollen mother cells appeared to be normal in Osg1-RI plants, but callose degradation was disrupted around the microspores in the anther locules of the Osg1-RI plants at the early microspore stage
Osg1	root	Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a Novel β-1,3-Glucanase Gene from Rice	 RT-PCR analysis revealed that Osg1 transcripts were present in leaves, roots, and anthers
Osg1	microspore	A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development	 Investigations using real-time PCR, immunocytochemical analysis, and a GUS-reporter gene driven by the Osg1 promoter indicated that Osg1 was mainly expressed at the late meiosis, early microspore, and middle microspore stages in the florets| The pollen mother cells appeared to be normal in Osg1-RI plants, but callose degradation was disrupted around the microspores in the anther locules of the Osg1-RI plants at the early microspore stage
Osg1	sterility	A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development	 The silencing of Osg1 resulted in male sterility
Osg1	pollen	A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development	 The pollen mother cells appeared to be normal in Osg1-RI plants, but callose degradation was disrupted around the microspores in the anther locules of the Osg1-RI plants at the early microspore stage|A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development
Osg1	meiosis	A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development	 Investigations using real-time PCR, immunocytochemical analysis, and a GUS-reporter gene driven by the Osg1 promoter indicated that Osg1 was mainly expressed at the late meiosis, early microspore, and middle microspore stages in the florets
