NA	Overexpression of a glyoxalase gene, OsGly I, improves abiotic stress tolerance and grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	College of Life Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China.	Glyoxalase I (Gly I) is a component of the glyoxalase system which is involved in the detoxification of methylglyoxal, a byproduct of glycolysis. In the present study, a gene of rice (Oryza sativa L., cv. Nipponbare) encoding Gly I was cloned and characterized. The quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that rice Gly I (OsGly I) was ubiquitously expressed in root, stem, leaf, leaf sheath and spikelet with varying abundance. OsGly I was markedly upregulated in response to NaCl, ZnCl2 and mannitol in rice seedlings. For further functional investigation, OsGly I was overexpressed in rice using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgenic rice lines exhibited increased glyoxalase enzyme activity, decreased methylglyoxal level and improved tolerance to NaCl, ZnCl2 and mannitol compared to wild-type plants. Enhancement of stress tolerance in transgenic lines was associated with reduction of malondialdehyde content which was derived from cellular lipid peroxidation. In addition, the OsGly I-overexpression transgenic plants performed higher seed setting rate and yield. Collectively, these results indicate the potential of bioengineering the Gly I gene in crops.
