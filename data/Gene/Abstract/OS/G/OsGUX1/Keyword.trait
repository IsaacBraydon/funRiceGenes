OsGUX1	leaf	A xylan glucuronosyltransferase gene exhibits pleiotropic effects on cellular composition and leaf development in rice.	 The overexpression of OsGUX1 reduced chlorophyll content, and the suppression of this gene increased chlorophyll content of rice leaf
OsGUX1	leaf	A xylan glucuronosyltransferase gene exhibits pleiotropic effects on cellular composition and leaf development in rice.	 OsGUX1 is located in Golgi apparatus, and highly expressed in seedling leaf and the tissues in which primary cell wall synthesis occurring
OsGUX1	leaf	A xylan glucuronosyltransferase gene exhibits pleiotropic effects on cellular composition and leaf development in rice.	 Our experimental data indicate that OsGUX1 is responsible for addition of glucuronic acid residues onto xylan and participates in accumulation of cellulose and hemicellulose in the cell wall deposition, thus thickening the primary cell wall of mesophyll cells, which might lead to reduced chlorophyll content in rice leaf
OsGUX1	seedling	A xylan glucuronosyltransferase gene exhibits pleiotropic effects on cellular composition and leaf development in rice.	 OsGUX1 is located in Golgi apparatus, and highly expressed in seedling leaf and the tissues in which primary cell wall synthesis occurring
