Leaf chlorophyll content is an important physiological indicator of plant growth, metabolism and nutritional status, and it is highly correlated with leaf nitrogen content and photosynthesis. In this study, we report the cloning and identification of a xylan glucuronosyltransferase gene (OsGUX1) that affects relative chlorophyll content in rice leaf. Using a set of chromosomal segment substitution lines derived from a cross of wild rice accession ACC10 and indica variety Zhenshan 97 (ZS97), we identified numerous quantitative trait loci for relative chlorophyll content. One major locus of them for relative chlorophyll content was mapped to a 10.3-kb region that contains OsGUX1. The allele OsGUX1(AC) from ACC10 significantly decreases nitrogen content and chlorophyll content of leaf compared with OsGUX1(ZS) from ZS97. The overexpression of OsGUX1 reduced chlorophyll content, and the suppression of this gene increased chlorophyll content of rice leaf. OsGUX1 is located in Golgi apparatus, and highly expressed in seedling leaf and the tissues in which primary cell wall synthesis occurring. Our experimental data indicate that OsGUX1 is responsible for addition of glucuronic acid residues onto xylan and participates in accumulation of cellulose and hemicellulose in the cell wall deposition, thus thickening the primary cell wall of mesophyll cells, which might lead to reduced chlorophyll content in rice leaf. These findings provide insights into the association of cell wall components with leaf nitrogen content in rice.
