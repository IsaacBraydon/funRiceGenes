OsGS|OsGS1|GS1|OsGS1;1|OsGLN1;1	OsGS3	Rice plants have three homologs of glutathione synthetase genes, one of which, OsGS2, codes for hydroxymethyl-glutathione synthetase.	 We isolated three rice glutathione synthetase homologs, designated OsGS1, OsGS2, and OsGS3, and found that knockdown of OsGS2 via RNA interference markedly decreased hydroxymethyl-glutathione concentration in rice plants
