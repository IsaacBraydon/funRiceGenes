Bonifacio-2011-Role of peroxidases.pdf	Role of peroxidases in the compensation of cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase knockdown in rice plants under abiotic stress	2011	Plant Cell Environ	Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal do Ceara, Ceara, Brasil.	Current studies, particularly in Arabidopsis, have demonstrated that mutants deficient in cytosolic ascorbate peroxidases (APXs) are susceptible to the oxidative damage induced by abiotic stress. In contrast, we demonstrate here that rice mutants double silenced for cytosolic APXs (APx1/2s) up-regulated other peroxidases, making the mutants able to cope with abiotic stress, such as salt, heat, high light and methyl viologen, similar to non-transformed (NT) plants. The APx1/2s mutants exhibited an altered redox homeostasis, as indicated by increased levels of H(2)O(2) and ascorbate and glutathione redox states. Both mutant and NT plants exhibited similar photosynthesis (CO(2)) assimilation and photochemical efficiency) under both normal and stress conditions. Overall, the antioxidative compensatory mechanism displayed by the mutants was associated with increased expression of OsGpx genes, which resulted in higher glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity in the cytosolic and chloroplastic fractions. The transcript levels of OsCatA and OsCatB and the activities of catalase (CAT) and guaiacol peroxidase (GPOD; type III peroxidases) were also up-regulated. None of the six studied isoforms of OsApx were up-regulated under normal growth conditions. Therefore, the deficiency in cytosolic APXs was effectively compensated for by up-regulation of other peroxidases. We propose that signalling mechanisms triggered in rice mutants could be distinct from those proposed for Arabidopsis.
Margis-2008-Glutathione peroxida.pdf	Glutathione peroxidase family - an evolutionary overview	2008	FEBS J	Centro de Biotecnologia, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.	Glutathione peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.9 and EC 1.11.1.12) catalyze the reduction of H(2)O(2) or organic hydroperoxides to water or corresponding alcohols using reduced glutathione. Some glutathione peroxidase isozymes have a selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity and present a selenocysteine encoded by the opal TGA codon. In the present study, insights into the evolution of the whole glutathione peroxidase gene family were obtained after a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis using the improved number of glutathione peroxidase sequences recorded in the PeroxiBase database (http://peroxidase.isb-sib.ch/index.php). The identification of a common ancestral origin for the diverse glutathione peroxidase clusters was not possible. The complex relationships and evolutionary rates of this gene family suggest that basal glutathione peroxidase classes, present in all kingdoms, have originated from independent evolutionary events such as gene duplication, gene losses, lateral gene transfer among invertebrates and vertebrates or plants. In addition, the present study also emphasizes the possibility of some members being submitted to strong selective forces that probably dictated functional convergences of taxonomically distant groups.
Passaia-2013-The mitochondrial gl.pdf	The mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase GPX3 is essential for H2O2 homeostasis and root and shoot development in rice	2013	Plant Sci	Department of Genetics, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, RS, Brazil.	Glutathione (GSH) peroxidases (GPXs: EC 1.11.1.9 and EC1.11.1.12) are non-heme thiol peroxidases that catalyze the reduction of H2O2 or organic hydroperoxides to water, and they have been identified in almost all kingdoms of life. The rice glutathione peroxidase (OsGPX) gene family is comprised of 5 members spread throughout a range of sub cellular compartments. The OsGPX gene family is induced in response to exogenous H2O2 and cold stress. In contrast, they are down regulated in response to drought and UV-B light treatments. Transgenic rice plants have been generated that lack mitochondrial OsGPX3. These GPX3s plants showed shorter roots and shoots compared to non-transformed (NT) plants, and higher amounts of H2O2 mitochondrial release were observed in the roots of these plants cultivated under normal conditions. This accumulation of H2O2 is positively associated with shorter root length in GPX3s plants compared to NT ones. Moreover, GPX3 promoter analysis indicated that it is mainly expressed in root tissue. These results suggest that silencing the mitochondrial OsGPX3 gene impairs normal plant development and leads to a stress-induced morphogenic response via H2O2 accumulation.
