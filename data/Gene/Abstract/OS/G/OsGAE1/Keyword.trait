OsGAE1	meristem	The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth	 In situ hybridization and OsGAE1 promoter analysis revealed that OsGAE1 expressed in shoot apex meristem and young primary leaves
OsGAE1	root	The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth	 OsGAE1 expressed mainly in growing leaf sheath and callus compared to leaf and root
OsGAE1	reproductive	The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth	 Transgenic rice expressing OsGAE1 in antisense orientation exhibited severely affected vegetative and reproductive growth
OsGAE1	gibberellin	The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth	The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth
OsGAE1	vegetative	The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth	 Transgenic rice expressing OsGAE1 in antisense orientation exhibited severely affected vegetative and reproductive growth
OsGAE1	shoot	The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth	 In situ hybridization and OsGAE1 promoter analysis revealed that OsGAE1 expressed in shoot apex meristem and young primary leaves
OsGAE1	growth	The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth	 Transgenic rice expressing OsGAE1 in antisense orientation exhibited severely affected vegetative and reproductive growth| These results suggest that OsGAE1 is differentially expressed in rice leaf sheath in relation to GA(3) and it encodes a functional protein which is involved in GA-regulated growth and development of rice|The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth
OsGAE1	leaf	The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth	 Anti-OsGAE1 antibodies immunoreacted with a protein of 40 kDa in rice leaf sheath| OsGAE1 expressed mainly in growing leaf sheath and callus compared to leaf and root| These results suggest that OsGAE1 is differentially expressed in rice leaf sheath in relation to GA(3) and it encodes a functional protein which is involved in GA-regulated growth and development of rice
OsGAE1	sheath	The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth	 Anti-OsGAE1 antibodies immunoreacted with a protein of 40 kDa in rice leaf sheath| OsGAE1 expressed mainly in growing leaf sheath and callus compared to leaf and root| These results suggest that OsGAE1 is differentially expressed in rice leaf sheath in relation to GA(3) and it encodes a functional protein which is involved in GA-regulated growth and development of rice
