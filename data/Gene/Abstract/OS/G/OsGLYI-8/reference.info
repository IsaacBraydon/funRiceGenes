NA	A nucleus-localized rice glyoxalase I enzyme, OsGLYI-8 functions in the detoxification of methylglyoxal in the nucleus.	2016	Plant J	Plant Stress Biology Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, 110067, India.	The cellular levels of methylglyoxal (MG), a toxic byproduct of glycolysis, rise under various abiotic stresses in plants. MG is detoxified primarily through the glyoxalase pathway. The first enzyme of the pathway, glyoxalase I (GLYI), is a cytosolic metalloenzyme requiring either Ni(2+) or Zn(2+) for its activity. Plants possess multiple GLYI genes, of which only some have been partially characterized and hence, the precise molecular mechanism, subcellular localization and physiological relevance of these diverse isoforms remain enigmatic. Here, we report the biochemical properties and physiological role of a putative chloroplast-localized GLYI enzyme, OsGLYI-8 from rice, which is strikingly different from all hitherto studied GLYI enzymes in terms of its intracellular localization, metal dependency and kinetics. In contrast to its predicted localization, OsGLYI-8 was found to localize in the nucleus along with its substrate, MG. Further, OsGLYI-8 does not show a strict requirement of metal ions for its activity, is functional as a dimer and exhibits unusual biphasic steady-state kinetics with a low-affinity and a high-affinity substrate binding component. Loss of AtGLYI-2, the closest Arabidopsis ortholog of OsGLYI-8, results in severe germination defects in the presence of MG and growth retardation upon salinity stress. These defects were rescued upon complementation with AtGLYI-2 or OsGLYI-8. Our findings thus, provide evidence for the presence of a GLYI enzyme and methylglyoxal detoxification in the nucleus.
