OsGA2ox1	OsGA3ox1	Gibberellin homeostasis and plant height control by EUI and a role for gibberellin in root gravity responses in rice	In addition, the GA biosynthesis genes GA3ox1 and GA20ox2 were downregulated and GA2ox1 was upregulated in eui seedlings
d18|OsGA3ox2	OsGA3ox1	Cloning and functional analysis of two gibberellin 3 beta -hydroxylase genes that are differently expressed during the growth of rice	Molecular and linkage analysis maps the OsGA3ox1 gene to the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 5; the OsGA3ox2 gene maps to the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 1 that corresponds to the D18 locus
d18|OsGA3ox2	OsGA3ox1	Cloning and functional analysis of two gibberellin 3 beta -hydroxylase genes that are differently expressed during the growth of rice	We have cloned two gibberellin (GA) 3 beta-hydroxylase genes, OsGA3ox1 and OsGA3ox2, from rice by screening a genomic library with a DNA fragment obtained by PCR using degenerate primers
d18|OsGA3ox2	OsGA3ox1	Evolutionary alterations in gene expression and enzymatic activities of gibberellin 3-oxidase 1 in Oryza.	 Enzymatic and X-ray crystallography analyses reveal that OsGA3ox1 has a higher GA(7) synthesis ratio than OsGA3ox2
