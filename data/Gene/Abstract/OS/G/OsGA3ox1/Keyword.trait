OsGA3ox1	gibberellin	Cloning and functional analysis of two gibberellin 3 beta -hydroxylase genes that are differently expressed during the growth of rice	We have cloned two gibberellin (GA) 3 beta-hydroxylase genes, OsGA3ox1 and OsGA3ox2, from rice by screening a genomic library with a DNA fragment obtained by PCR using degenerate primers
OsGA3ox1	flower	Cloning and functional analysis of two gibberellin 3 beta -hydroxylase genes that are differently expressed during the growth of rice	Although both genes show transient expression, the highest level for OsGA3ox1 is from unopened flower
OsGA3ox1	pollen	Evolutionary alterations in gene expression and enzymatic activities of gibberellin 3-oxidase 1 in Oryza.	 In addition, we generate an osga3ox1 knockout mutant by genome editing and demonstrate the bioactive gibberellic acid synthesis by the OsGA3ox1 action during starch accumulation in pollen via invertase regulation
OsGA3ox1	starch	Evolutionary alterations in gene expression and enzymatic activities of gibberellin 3-oxidase 1 in Oryza.	 In addition, we generate an osga3ox1 knockout mutant by genome editing and demonstrate the bioactive gibberellic acid synthesis by the OsGA3ox1 action during starch accumulation in pollen via invertase regulation
