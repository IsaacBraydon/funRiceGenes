OsGBSSII	starch	Cloning and characterization of the granule-bound starch synthase II gene in rice: gene expression is regulated by the nitrogen level, sugar and circadian rhythm	OsGBSSII was mainly expressed in leaves and its protein was exclusively bound to starch granules in rice leaves, which suggests that the amylose in rice leaves is synthesized by OsGBSSII
OsGBSSII	nitrate	Cloning and characterization of the granule-bound starch synthase II gene in rice: gene expression is regulated by the nitrogen level, sugar and circadian rhythm	N-starvation-induced expression of OsGBSSII could be repressed by supplying nitrate, ammonia or amino acid (glutamic acid or glutamine), glucosamine (an inhibitor of hexokinase) or dark conditions
OsGBSSII	nitrogen	Cloning and characterization of the granule-bound starch synthase II gene in rice: gene expression is regulated by the nitrogen level, sugar and circadian rhythm	21) was cloned and defined as OsGBSSII based on a Nitrogen (N)-starvation-induced cDNA library constructed using the rapid subtraction hybridization method
