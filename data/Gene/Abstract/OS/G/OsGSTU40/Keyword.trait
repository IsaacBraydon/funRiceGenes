OsGSTU40	growth	Differential effects of arsenite and arsenate on rice (Oryza sativa) plants differing in glutathione S-transferase gene expression.	 japonica) and OsGSTU40 overexpression lines under chronic or acute stress of As, we aimed to understand the toxic effects of both As(III) and As(V) on rice plants at the vegetative growth stage
OsGSTU40	growth	Differential effects of arsenite and arsenate on rice (Oryza sativa) plants differing in glutathione S-transferase gene expression.	 Furthermore, overexpression of OsGSTU40 led to better plant growth even though uptake of As(V), but not As(III), into shoots was enhanced in transgenic plants
OsGSTU40	stress	Differential effects of arsenite and arsenate on rice (Oryza sativa) plants differing in glutathione S-transferase gene expression.	 japonica) and OsGSTU40 overexpression lines under chronic or acute stress of As, we aimed to understand the toxic effects of both As(III) and As(V) on rice plants at the vegetative growth stage
OsGSTU40	tolerance	Differential effects of arsenite and arsenate on rice (Oryza sativa) plants differing in glutathione S-transferase gene expression.	 We hypothesized that (i) As(III) and As(V) have different toxic effects on rice plants and (ii) OsGSTU40 played positive roles in As toxicity tolerance
OsGSTU40	tolerance	Differential effects of arsenite and arsenate on rice (Oryza sativa) plants differing in glutathione S-transferase gene expression.	 Overall, our findings suggest that As(III) is more toxic to plants than As(V) and that glutathione S-transferase OsGSTU40 differentially affects plant reactions and tolerance to different species of arsenic
OsGSTU40	vegetative	Differential effects of arsenite and arsenate on rice (Oryza sativa) plants differing in glutathione S-transferase gene expression.	 japonica) and OsGSTU40 overexpression lines under chronic or acute stress of As, we aimed to understand the toxic effects of both As(III) and As(V) on rice plants at the vegetative growth stage
OsGSTU40	plant growth	Differential effects of arsenite and arsenate on rice (Oryza sativa) plants differing in glutathione S-transferase gene expression.	 Furthermore, overexpression of OsGSTU40 led to better plant growth even though uptake of As(V), but not As(III), into shoots was enhanced in transgenic plants
