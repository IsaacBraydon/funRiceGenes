J Biochem-2012-Yang-jb-mvr145.pdf	The OsGEN-L protein from Oryza sativa possesses Holliday junction resolvase activity as well as 5 '-flap endonuclease activity	2012	J Biochem	Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Bioresource and Bioenvironmental Sciences, Kyushu University, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan.	OsGEN-L has a 5'-flap endonuclease activity and plays an essential role in rice microspore development. The Class 4 RAD2/XPG family nucleases, including OsGEN-L, were recently found to have resolving activity for the Holliday junction (HJ), the intermediate of DNA strand recombination. In this study, we performed a detailed characterization of OsGEN-L, as a structure-specific endonuclease. Highly purified OsGEN-L was prepared as the full-length protein for in vitro endonuclease assays using various structured DNAs, and the 5'-flap endonuclease activity, which is stimulated in a PCNA-dependent manner, was demonstrated. In addition, the in vitro HJ resolving activity of OsGEN-L represents the first such activity originating from plant cells. OsGEN-L cleaved HJ at symmetrically related sites of the branch point. However, the two branched strands seemed to be cleaved individually, and not cooperatively, by each OsGEN-L monomer protein. The substrate specificity suggests that OsGEN-L functions in multiple processes of DNA metabolism in rice cells.
Plant Cell Physiol-2005-Moritoh-699-715.pdf	RNAi-mediated silencing of OsGEN-L (OsGEN-like), a new member of the RAD2/XPG nuclease family, causes male sterility by defect of microspore development in rice	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Takayama 8916-5, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0192 Japan.	We have cloned a new member of the RAD2/XPG nuclease family, OsGEN-L (OsGEN-like), from rice (Oryza sativa L.). OsGEN-L possesses two domains, the N- and I-regions, that are conserved in the RAD2/XPG nuclease family. Database searches and phylogenetic analyses revealed that OsGEN-L belongs to class 4 of the RAD2/XPG nuclease family, and OsGEN-L homologs were found in animals and higher plants. To elucidate the function of OsGEN-L, we generated rice OsGEN-L-RNAi transgenic plants in which OsGEN-L expression was silenced. Most of the OsGEN-L-RNAi plants displayed low fertility, and some of them were male-sterile. OsGEN-L-RNAi plants lacked mature pollen, resulting from a defect in early microspore development. A OsGEN-L-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was localized in the nucleus, and the OsGEN-L promoter was specifically active in the anthers. Furthermore, a recombinant OsGEN-L protein possessed flap endonuclease activity and both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA-binding activities. Our results suggest that OsGEN-L plays an essential role in DNA metabolism required for early microspore development in rice.
NA	Resolvase OsGEN1 mediates DNA repair by homologous recombination.	2017	Plant Physiol	Shanghai Jiao Tong University CITY: shanghai STATE: shanghai China [CN].	Yen1/GEN1 are canonical Holliday Junction (HJ) resolvases that belong to the RAD2/XPG family. In eukaryotes, such as budding yeast, mice, worms, and humans, Yen1/GEN1 work together with Mus81-Mms4/MUS81-EME1 and Slx1-Slx4/SLX1-SLX4 in DNA repair by homologous recombination to maintain genome stability. In plants, the biological function of Yen1/GEN1 remains largely unclear. In this study, we characterized the loss of function mutants of OsGEN1 and OsSEND1, a pair of paralogs of Yen1/GEN1 in rice. We first investigated the role of OsGEN1 during meiosis and found a reduction in chiasma frequency by ~6% in osgen1 mutants, compared to wild type, suggesting a possible involvement of OsGEN1 in the formation of crossovers. Post-meiosis, OsGEN1 foci were detected in wild-type microspore nuclei, but not in the osgen1 mutant concomitant with an increase in double strand breaks. Persistent double strand breaks led to programmed cell death of the male gametes and complete male sterility. In contrast, depletion of OsSEND1 had no effects on plant development and did not enhance osgen1 defects. Our results indicate that OsGEN1 is essential for homologous recombinational DNA repair at two stages of microsporogenesis in rice.
