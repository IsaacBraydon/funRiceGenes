J Biochem-2012-Yang-jb-mvr145.pdf	The OsGEN-L protein from Oryza sativa possesses Holliday junction resolvase activity as well as 5 '-flap endonuclease activity	2012	J Biochem	Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Bioresource and Bioenvironmental Sciences, Kyushu University, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan.	OsGEN-L has a 5'-flap endonuclease activity and plays an essential role in rice microspore development. The Class 4 RAD2/XPG family nucleases, including OsGEN-L, were recently found to have resolving activity for the Holliday junction (HJ), the intermediate of DNA strand recombination. In this study, we performed a detailed characterization of OsGEN-L, as a structure-specific endonuclease. Highly purified OsGEN-L was prepared as the full-length protein for in vitro endonuclease assays using various structured DNAs, and the 5'-flap endonuclease activity, which is stimulated in a PCNA-dependent manner, was demonstrated. In addition, the in vitro HJ resolving activity of OsGEN-L represents the first such activity originating from plant cells. OsGEN-L cleaved HJ at symmetrically related sites of the branch point. However, the two branched strands seemed to be cleaved individually, and not cooperatively, by each OsGEN-L monomer protein. The substrate specificity suggests that OsGEN-L functions in multiple processes of DNA metabolism in rice cells.
Plant Cell Physiol-2005-Moritoh-699-715.pdf	RNAi-mediated silencing of OsGEN-L (OsGEN-like), a new member of the RAD2/XPG nuclease family, causes male sterility by defect of microspore development in rice	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Takayama 8916-5, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0192 Japan.	We have cloned a new member of the RAD2/XPG nuclease family, OsGEN-L (OsGEN-like), from rice (Oryza sativa L.). OsGEN-L possesses two domains, the N- and I-regions, that are conserved in the RAD2/XPG nuclease family. Database searches and phylogenetic analyses revealed that OsGEN-L belongs to class 4 of the RAD2/XPG nuclease family, and OsGEN-L homologs were found in animals and higher plants. To elucidate the function of OsGEN-L, we generated rice OsGEN-L-RNAi transgenic plants in which OsGEN-L expression was silenced. Most of the OsGEN-L-RNAi plants displayed low fertility, and some of them were male-sterile. OsGEN-L-RNAi plants lacked mature pollen, resulting from a defect in early microspore development. A OsGEN-L-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was localized in the nucleus, and the OsGEN-L promoter was specifically active in the anthers. Furthermore, a recombinant OsGEN-L protein possessed flap endonuclease activity and both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA-binding activities. Our results suggest that OsGEN-L plays an essential role in DNA metabolism required for early microspore development in rice.
