OsGBP1	 Knock-down and knock-out of OsGBP1 promoted seedling growth and enhanced grain length, whereas overexpression of OsGBP1 exhibited the opposite effect on seedling growth and grain length, indicating that OsGBP1 repressed grain length and seedling growth |  In addition, overexpression of OsGBP1 led to delayed flowering time and suppressed plant height |  OsGBP1 could regulate OsLFL1 expression through binding to the (GA)(12) element of its promoter	 Knock-down and knock-out of OsGBP1 promoted seedling growth and enhanced grain length, whereas overexpression of OsGBP1 exhibited the opposite effect on seedling growth and grain length, indicating that OsGBP1 repressed grain length and seedling growth |  In addition, overexpression of OsGBP1 led to delayed flowering time and suppressed plant height	 RNAi of both OsGBP1 and OsGBP3 resulted in severe dwarfism, compared with RNAi of a single gene
