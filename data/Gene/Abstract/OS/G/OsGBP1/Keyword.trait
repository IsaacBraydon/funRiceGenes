OsGBP1	growth	Divergent functions of the GAGA-binding transcription factor family in rice.	 Knock-down and knock-out of OsGBP1 promoted seedling growth and enhanced grain length, whereas overexpression of OsGBP1 exhibited the opposite effect on seedling growth and grain length, indicating that OsGBP1 repressed grain length and seedling growth
OsGBP1	grain	Divergent functions of the GAGA-binding transcription factor family in rice.	 Knock-down and knock-out of OsGBP1 promoted seedling growth and enhanced grain length, whereas overexpression of OsGBP1 exhibited the opposite effect on seedling growth and grain length, indicating that OsGBP1 repressed grain length and seedling growth
OsGBP1	seedling	Divergent functions of the GAGA-binding transcription factor family in rice.	 Knock-down and knock-out of OsGBP1 promoted seedling growth and enhanced grain length, whereas overexpression of OsGBP1 exhibited the opposite effect on seedling growth and grain length, indicating that OsGBP1 repressed grain length and seedling growth
OsGBP1	grain length	Divergent functions of the GAGA-binding transcription factor family in rice.	 Knock-down and knock-out of OsGBP1 promoted seedling growth and enhanced grain length, whereas overexpression of OsGBP1 exhibited the opposite effect on seedling growth and grain length, indicating that OsGBP1 repressed grain length and seedling growth
OsGBP1	height	Divergent functions of the GAGA-binding transcription factor family in rice.	 In addition, overexpression of OsGBP1 led to delayed flowering time and suppressed plant height
OsGBP1	plant height	Divergent functions of the GAGA-binding transcription factor family in rice.	 In addition, overexpression of OsGBP1 led to delayed flowering time and suppressed plant height
OsGBP1	flowering time	Divergent functions of the GAGA-binding transcription factor family in rice.	 In addition, overexpression of OsGBP1 led to delayed flowering time and suppressed plant height
OsGBP1	flowering	Divergent functions of the GAGA-binding transcription factor family in rice.	 In addition, overexpression of OsGBP1 led to delayed flowering time and suppressed plant height
OsGBP1	seedling growth	Divergent functions of the GAGA-binding transcription factor family in rice.	 Knock-down and knock-out of OsGBP1 promoted seedling growth and enhanced grain length, whereas overexpression of OsGBP1 exhibited the opposite effect on seedling growth and grain length, indicating that OsGBP1 repressed grain length and seedling growth
