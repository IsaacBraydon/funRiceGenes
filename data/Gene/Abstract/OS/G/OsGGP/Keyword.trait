OsGGP	growth	Ascorbate biosynthesis and its involvement in stress tolerance and plant development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	All plants except for KO mutants of OsGGP showed distinct peaks in foliar AsA concentrations during the growth, which were consistent with up-regulation of OsGGP, suggesting that OsGGP plays a pivotal role in regulating foliar AsA levels during different growth stages
OsGGP	biomass	Ascorbate biosynthesis and its involvement in stress tolerance and plant development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	Mutants showed lower biomass production than their wild-types, especially when OsGGP was lacking (around 80Â % reductions)
