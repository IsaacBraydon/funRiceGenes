OsGWD1|GWD1	 In the present study, we successfully generated gwd1 weak mutants by promoter editing using CRISPR/Cas9 system, and also leaf-dominant overexpression lines of GWD1 driven by Osl2 promoter |  However, the transgenic pOsl2::GWD1 overexpression lines showed improvements in multiple key traits, including rice yield, grain shape, rice quality, seed germination and stress tolerance	 In the present study, we successfully generated gwd1 weak mutants by promoter editing using CRISPR/Cas9 system, and also leaf-dominant overexpression lines of GWD1 driven by Osl2 promoter |  However, the transgenic pOsl2::GWD1 overexpression lines showed improvements in multiple key traits, including rice yield, grain shape, rice quality, seed germination and stress tolerance
