OsGWD1|GWD1	Osl2	Glucan, Water-Dikinase 1 (GWD1), an ideal biotechnological target for potential improving yield and quality in rice	 In the present study, we successfully generated gwd1 weak mutants by promoter editing using CRISPR/Cas9 system, and also leaf-dominant overexpression lines of GWD1 driven by Osl2 promoter
