To identify potential regulators of photoassimilate partitioning, we screened for rice mutant plants that accumulate high levels of starch in the leaf blades, and a mutant line leaf starch excess 1 (LSE1) was obtained and characterized. The starch content in the leaf blades of LSE1 was more than 10-fold higher than that in wild-type plants throughout the day, while the sucrose content was unaffected. The gene responsible for the LSE1 phenotype was identified by gene mapping to be a gene encoding alpha-glucan water dikinase, OsGWD1 (Os06g0498400), and a 3.4-kb deletion of the gene was found in the mutant plant. Despite the hyperaccumulation of starch in their leaf blades, LSE1 plants exhibited no significant change in vegetative growth, presenting a clear contrast to the reported mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana and Lotus japonicus in which disruption of the genes for alpha-glucan water dikinase leads to marked inhibition of vegetative growth. In reproductive growth, however, LSE1 exhibited fewer panicles per plant, lower percentage of ripened grains and smaller grains; consequently, the grain yield was lower in LSE1 plants than in wild-type plants by 20~40%. Collectively, although alpha-glucan water dikinase was suggested to have universal importance in leaf starch degradation in higher plants, the physiological priority of leaf starch in photoassimilate allocation may vary among plant species.
NA	Glucan, Water-Dikinase 1 (GWD1), an ideal biotechnological target for potential improving yield and quality in rice	2021	Plant Biotechnol J	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genomics and Molecular Breeding /Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics of the Ministry of Education, College of Agriculture, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, China.	The source-sink relationship determines the overall agronomic performance of rice. Cloning and characterizing key genes involved in the regulation of source and sink dynamics is imperative for improving rice yield. However, few source genes with potential application in rice have been identified. Glucan, Water-Dikinase 1 (GWD1) is an essential enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the first step of transitory starch degradation in source tissues. In the present study, we successfully generated gwd1 weak mutants by promoter editing using CRISPR/Cas9 system, and also leaf-dominant overexpression lines of GWD1 driven by Osl2 promoter. Analysis of the gwd1 plants indicated that promoter editing mediated down-regulation of GWD1 caused no observable effects on rice growth and development, but only mildly modified its grain transparency and seed germination. However, the transgenic pOsl2::GWD1 overexpression lines showed improvements in multiple key traits, including rice yield, grain shape, rice quality, seed germination and stress tolerance. Therefore, our study shows that GWD1 is not only involved in transitory starch degradation in source tissues, but also plays key roles in the seeds, which is a sink tissue. In conclusion, we find that GWD1 is an ideal biotechnological target with promising potential for the breeding of elite rice cultivars via genetic engineering.
