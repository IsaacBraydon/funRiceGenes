OsGWD1|GWD1	starch	Disruption of a rice gene for alpha-glucan water dikinase, OsGWD1, leads to hyperaccumulation of starch in leaves but exhibits limited effects on growth	Disruption of a rice gene for alpha-glucan water dikinase, OsGWD1, leads to hyperaccumulation of starch in leaves but exhibits limited effects on growth
OsGWD1|GWD1	growth	Disruption of a rice gene for alpha-glucan water dikinase, OsGWD1, leads to hyperaccumulation of starch in leaves but exhibits limited effects on growth	Disruption of a rice gene for alpha-glucan water dikinase, OsGWD1, leads to hyperaccumulation of starch in leaves but exhibits limited effects on growth
OsGWD1|GWD1	growth	Glucan, Water-Dikinase 1 (GWD1), an ideal biotechnological target for potential improving yield and quality in rice	 Analysis of the gwd1 plants indicated that promoter editing mediated down-regulation of GWD1 caused no observable effects on rice growth and development, but only mildly modified its grain transparency and seed germination
OsGWD1|GWD1	grain	Glucan, Water-Dikinase 1 (GWD1), an ideal biotechnological target for potential improving yield and quality in rice	 Analysis of the gwd1 plants indicated that promoter editing mediated down-regulation of GWD1 caused no observable effects on rice growth and development, but only mildly modified its grain transparency and seed germination
OsGWD1|GWD1	seed	Glucan, Water-Dikinase 1 (GWD1), an ideal biotechnological target for potential improving yield and quality in rice	 Analysis of the gwd1 plants indicated that promoter editing mediated down-regulation of GWD1 caused no observable effects on rice growth and development, but only mildly modified its grain transparency and seed germination
OsGWD1|GWD1	starch	Glucan, Water-Dikinase 1 (GWD1), an ideal biotechnological target for potential improving yield and quality in rice	 Therefore, our study shows that GWD1 is not only involved in transitory starch degradation in source tissues, but also plays key roles in the seeds, which is a sink tissue
OsGWD1|GWD1	seed germination	Glucan, Water-Dikinase 1 (GWD1), an ideal biotechnological target for potential improving yield and quality in rice	 Analysis of the gwd1 plants indicated that promoter editing mediated down-regulation of GWD1 caused no observable effects on rice growth and development, but only mildly modified its grain transparency and seed germination
OsGWD1|GWD1	breeding	Glucan, Water-Dikinase 1 (GWD1), an ideal biotechnological target for potential improving yield and quality in rice	 In conclusion, we find that GWD1 is an ideal biotechnological target with promising potential for the breeding of elite rice cultivars via genetic engineering
