Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) have poorly understood roles in plant responses to environmental stresses. A polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced tau class GST was identified in rice roots by protein microsequencing. PEG and the heavy metals Cd (20 microM), Zn (30 microM), Co and Ni rapidly and markedly induced osgstu4 and osgstu3 in rice seedling roots. Osgstu4 and osgstu3 were also induced in roots by hypoxic stress but not by cold nor heat shock. Salt stress and abscisic acid (ABA) rapidly induced osgstu3 in rice roots, whereas osgstu4 exhibited a late salt stress and no ABA response. Salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and the auxin alpha-naphthalene acetic acid triggered osgstu4 and osgstu3 expression. Osgstu4 and osgstu3 were rapidly and markedly induced by the antioxidant dithiothreitol and the strong oxidant hydrogen peroxide, which suggested that redox perturbations and reactive oxygen species are involved in their stress response regulations.
