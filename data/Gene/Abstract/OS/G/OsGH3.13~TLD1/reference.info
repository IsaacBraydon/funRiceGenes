21023589.pdf	The auxin-responsive GH3 gene family in rice (Oryza sativa)	2006	Funct Integr Genomics	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, Benito Juarez Road, New Delhi, 110021, India.	Auxin regulates plant growth and development by altering the expression of diverse genes. Among these, the genes of Aux/IAA, SAUR, and GH3 classes have been extensively studied in dicots, but little information is available on monocots. We have identified 12 members of GH3 gene family in rice using sequences of full-length cDNA clones available from KOME and analysis of the whole genome sequence of rice. The genomic organization as well as chromosomal location of all the OsGH3 genes is reported. The rice GH3 proteins can be classified in two groups (groups I and II) on the basis of their phylogenetic relationship with Arabidopsis GH3 proteins. Based upon the sequences available in the database, not a single group III GH3 protein could be identified in rice. An extensive survey of EST sequences of other monocots led to the conclusion that although GH3 gene family is highly conserved in both dicots and monocots but the group III is conspicuous by its absence in monocots. The in silico analysis has been complemented with experimental data to quantify transcript levels of all GH3 gene family members. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction, the organ-specific expression of individual OsGH3 genes in light- and dark-grown seedlings/plants has been examined. The transcript abundance of nearly all OsGH3 genes is enhanced on auxin treatment, with the effect more pronounced on OsGH3-1, -2, and -4. The functional validation of these genes in transgenics or analysis of gene-specific insertional mutants will help in elucidating their precise role in auxin signal transduction.
Plant Physiol.-2009-Zhang-1889-901.pdf	Altered architecture and enhanced drought tolerance in rice via the down-regulation of indole-3-acetic acid by TLD1/OsGH3.13 activation	2009	Plant Physiol	Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China 050016.	Plant architecture is determined by genetic and developmental programs as well as by environmental factors. Sessile plants have evolved a subtle adaptive mechanism that allows them to alter their growth and development during periods of stress. Phytohormones play a central role in this process; however, the molecules responsible for integrating growth- and stress-related signals are unknown. Here, we report a gain-of-function rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, tld1-D, characterized by (and named for) an increased number of tillers, enlarged leaf angles, and dwarfism. TLD1 is a rice GH3.13 gene that encodes indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-amido synthetase, which is suppressed in aboveground tissues under normal conditions but which is dramatically induced by drought stress. The activation of TLD1 reduced the IAA maxima at the lamina joint, shoot base, and nodes, resulting in subsequent alterations in plant architecture and tissue patterning but enhancing drought tolerance. Accordingly, the decreased level of free IAA in tld1-D due to the conjugation of IAA with amino acids greatly facilitated the accumulation of late-embryogenesis abundant mRNA compared with the wild type. The direct regulation of such drought-inducible genes by changes in the concentration of IAA provides a model for changes in plant architecture via the process of drought adaptation, which occurs frequently in nature.
NA	Identification of a novel QTL and candidate gene associated with grain size using chromosome segment substitution lines in rice	2021	Sci Rep	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Rice is one of the staple crops in the world. Grain size is an important determinant of rice grain yield, but the genetic basis of the grain size remains unclear. Here, we report a set of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSL) developed in the genetic background of the genome-sequenced indica cultivar Zhenshan 97. Genotyping of the CSSLs by single nucleotide polymorphism array shows that most carry only one or two segments introduced from the genome-sequenced japonica cultivar Nipponbare. Using this population and the high-density markers, a total of 43 quantitative trait loci were identified for seven panicle- and grain-related traits. Among these loci, the novel locus qGL11 for grain length and thousand-grain weight was validated in a CSSL-derived segregating population and finely mapped to a 25-kb region that contains an IAA-amido synthetase gene OsGH3.13, This gene exhibited a significant expression difference in the young panicle between the near-isogenic lines that carry the contrasting Zhenshan 97 and Nipponbare alleles at qGL11. Expression and sequence analyses suggest that this gene is the most likely candidate for qGL11. Furthermore, several OsGH3.13 mutants induced by a CRISPR/Cas9 approach in either japonica or indica exhibit an increased grain length and thousand-grain weight, thus enhancing the final grain yield per plant. These findings provide insights into the genetic basis of grain size for the improvement of yield potential in rice breeding programs.
