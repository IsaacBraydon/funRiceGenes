OsGATA8	 Transgenic lines of rice were generated with 3-fold overexpression of OsGATA8 compared to the wild-type together with knockdown lines with 2-fold lower expression |  OsGATA8 produced these effects by regulating the expression of critical genes involved in stress tolerance, scavenging of reactive oxygen species, and chlorophyll biosynthesis	 Transgenic lines of rice were generated with 3-fold overexpression of OsGATA8 compared to the wild-type together with knockdown lines with 2-fold lower expression
