OsG1L1	development	The ALOG family members OsG1L1 and OsG1L2 regulate inflorescence branching in rice.	 Here, we report that osg1l1 and osg1l2 loss-of-function CRISPR mutants have similar phenotypes to the phenotype of the previously published taw1 mutant, suggesting that these genes might act on related pathways during inflorescence development
OsG1L1	inflorescence	The ALOG family members OsG1L1 and OsG1L2 regulate inflorescence branching in rice.	The ALOG family members OsG1L1 and OsG1L2 regulate inflorescence branching in rice.
