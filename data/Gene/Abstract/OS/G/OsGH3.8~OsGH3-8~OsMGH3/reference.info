21023589.pdf	The auxin-responsive GH3 gene family in rice (Oryza sativa)	2006	Funct Integr Genomics	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, Benito Juarez Road, New Delhi, 110021, India.	Auxin regulates plant growth and development by altering the expression of diverse genes. Among these, the genes of Aux/IAA, SAUR, and GH3 classes have been extensively studied in dicots, but little information is available on monocots. We have identified 12 members of GH3 gene family in rice using sequences of full-length cDNA clones available from KOME and analysis of the whole genome sequence of rice. The genomic organization as well as chromosomal location of all the OsGH3 genes is reported. The rice GH3 proteins can be classified in two groups (groups I and II) on the basis of their phylogenetic relationship with Arabidopsis GH3 proteins. Based upon the sequences available in the database, not a single group III GH3 protein could be identified in rice. An extensive survey of EST sequences of other monocots led to the conclusion that although GH3 gene family is highly conserved in both dicots and monocots but the group III is conspicuous by its absence in monocots. The in silico analysis has been complemented with experimental data to quantify transcript levels of all GH3 gene family members. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction, the organ-specific expression of individual OsGH3 genes in light- and dark-grown seedlings/plants has been examined. The transcript abundance of nearly all OsGH3 genes is enhanced on auxin treatment, with the effect more pronounced on OsGH3-1, -2, and -4. The functional validation of these genes in transgenics or analysis of gene-specific insertional mutants will help in elucidating their precise role in auxin signal transduction.
J. Biol. Chem.-2010-Chen-29780-6.pdf	Kinetic basis for the conjugation of auxin by a GH3 family indole-acetic acid-amido synthetase	2010	J Biol Chem	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	The GH3 family of acyl-acid-amido synthetases catalyze the ATP-dependent formation of amino acid conjugates to modulate levels of active plant hormones, including auxins and jasmonates. Initial biochemical studies of various GH3s show that these enzymes group into three families based on sequence relationships and acyl-acid substrate preference (I, jasmonate-conjugating; II, auxin- and salicylic acid-conjugating; III, benzoate-conjugating); however, little is known about the kinetic and chemical mechanisms of these enzymes. Here we use GH3-8 from Oryza sativa (rice; OsGH3-8), which functions as an indole-acetic acid (IAA)-amido synthetase, for detailed mechanistic studies. Steady-state kinetic analysis shows that the OsGH3-8 requires either Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) for maximal activity and is specific for aspartate but accepts asparagine as a substrate with a 45-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency and accepts other auxin analogs, including phenyl-acetic acid, indole butyric acid, and naphthalene-acetic acid, as acyl-acid substrates with 1.4-9-fold reductions in k(cat)/K(m) relative to IAA. Initial velocity and product inhibition studies indicate that the enzyme uses a Bi Uni Uni Bi Ping Pong reaction sequence. In the first half-reaction, ATP binds first followed by IAA. Next, formation of an adenylated IAA intermediate results in release of pyrophosphate. The second half-reaction begins with binding of aspartate, which reacts with the adenylated intermediate to release IAA-Asp and AMP. Formation of a catalytically competent adenylated-IAA reaction intermediate was confirmed by mass spectrometry. These mechanistic studies provide insight on the reaction catalyzed by the GH3 family of enzymes to modulate plant hormone action.
j.1365-313X.2005.02504.x.pdf	OsMADS1, a rice MADS-box factor, controls differentiation of specific cell types in the lemma and palea and is an early-acting regulator of inner floral organs	2005	Plant J	Department of MCB, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.	Grass flowers are highly derived compared to their eudicot counterparts. To delineate OsMADS1 functions in rice floret organ development we have examined its evolution and the consequences of its knockdown or overexpression. Molecular phylogeny suggests the co-evolution of OsMADS1 with grass family diversification. OsMADS1 knockdown perturbs the differentiation of specific cell types in the lemma and palea, creating glume-like features, with severe derangements in lemma differentiation. Conversely, ectopic OsMADS1 expression suffices to direct lemma-like differentiation in the glume. Strikingly, in many OsMADS1 knockdown florets glume-like organs occupy all the inner whorls. Such effects in the second and third whorl are unexplained, as wild-type florets do not express OsMADS1 in these primordia and because transcripts for rice B and C organ-identity genes are unaffected by OsMADS1 knockdown. Through a screen for OsMADS1 targets we identify a flower-specific Nt-gh3 type gene, OsMGH3, as a downstream gene. The delayed transcription activation of OsMGH3 by dexamethasone-inducible OsMADS1 suggests indirect activation. The OsMGH3 floret expression profile suggests a novel role for OsMADS1 as an early-acting regulator of second and third whorl organ fate. We thus demonstrate the differential contribution of OsMADS1 for lemma versus palea development and provide evidence for its regulatory function in patterning inner whorl organs.
Plant Cell-2008-Ding-228-40.pdf	Activation of the indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase GH3-8 suppresses expansin expression and promotes salicylate- and jasmonate-independent basal immunity in rice	2008	Plant Cell	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	New evidence suggests a role for the plant growth hormone auxin in pathogenesis and disease resistance. Bacterial infection induces the accumulation of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the major type of auxin, in rice (Oryza sativa). IAA induces the expression of expansins, proteins that loosen the cell wall. Loosening the cell wall is key for plant growth but may also make the plant vulnerable to biotic intruders. Here, we report that rice GH3-8, an auxin-responsive gene functioning in auxin-dependent development, activates disease resistance in a salicylic acid signaling- and jasmonic acid signaling-independent pathway. GH3-8 encodes an IAA-amino synthetase that prevents free IAA accumulation. Overexpression of GH3-8 results in enhanced disease resistance to the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. This resistance is independent of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signaling. Overexpression of GH3-8 also causes abnormal plant morphology and retarded growth and development. Both enhanced resistance and abnormal development may be caused by inhibition of the expression of expansins via suppressed auxin signaling.
Plant Cell Physiol-2011-Yadav-2123-35.pdf	Auxin-responsive OsMGH3, a common downstream target of OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, controls rice floret fertility	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore-560012, India.	GH3 proteins control auxin homeostasis by inactivating excess auxin as conjugates of amino acids and sugars and thereby controlling cellular bioactive auxin. Since auxin regulates many aspects of plant growth and development, regulated expression of these genes offers a mechanism to control various developmental processes. OsMGH3/OsGH3-8 is expressed abundantly in rice florets and is regulated by two related and redundant transcription factors, OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, but its contribution to flower development is not known. We functionally characterize OsMGH3 by overexpression and knock-down analysis and show a partial overlap in these phenotypes with that of mutants in OsMADS1 and OsMADS6. The overexpression of OsMGH3 during the vegetative phase affects the overall plant architecture, whereas its inflorescence-specific overexpression creates short panicles with reduced branching, resembling in part the effects of OsMADS1 overexpression. In contrast, the down-regulation of endogenous OsMGH3 caused phenotypes consistent with auxin overproduction or activated signaling, such as ectopic rooting from aerial nodes. Florets in OsMGH3 knock-down plants were affected in carpel development and pollen viability, both of which reduced fertility. Some of these floret phenotypes are similar to osmads6 mutants. Taken together, we provide evidence for the functional significance of auxin homeostasis and its transcriptional regulation during rice panicle branching and floret organ development.
NA	Gene Expression Dynamics in Rice Peduncles at the Heading Stage	2020	Front Genet	Grass Genetics and Informatics Group, School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.	Improving grain yield in the staple food crop rice has been long sought goal of plant biotechnology. One of the traits with significant impact on rice breeding programs is peduncle elongation at the time of heading failing which leads to significant reduction in grain yield due to incomplete panicle exsertion. To decipher transcriptional dynamics and molecular players underlying peduncle elongation, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of elongating and non-elongating peduncles in two Indian cultivars, Swarna and Pokkali, at the time of heading. Along with genes associated with cell division and cell wall biosynthesis, we observed significant enrichment of genes associated with auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis/signaling in the elongating peduncles before heading in both the genotypes. Similarly, genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and mobilization, abiotic stress response along with cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene biosynthesis/signaling were enriched in non-elongating peduncles post heading. Significant enrichment of genes belonging to key transcription factor families highlights their specialized roles in peduncle elongation and grain filling before and after heading, respectively. A comparison with anther/pollen development-related genes provided 76 candidates with overlapping roles in anther/pollen development and peduncle elongation. Some of these are important for carbohydrate remobilization to the developing grains. These can be engineered to combat with incomplete panicle exsertion in male sterile lines and manipulate carbohydrate dynamics in grasses. Overall, this study provides baseline information about potential target genes for engineering peduncle elongation with implications on plant height, biomass composition and grain yields in rice.
NA	Identification of a novel QTL and candidate gene associated with grain size using chromosome segment substitution lines in rice	2021	Sci Rep	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Rice is one of the staple crops in the world. Grain size is an important determinant of rice grain yield, but the genetic basis of the grain size remains unclear. Here, we report a set of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSL) developed in the genetic background of the genome-sequenced indica cultivar Zhenshan 97. Genotyping of the CSSLs by single nucleotide polymorphism array shows that most carry only one or two segments introduced from the genome-sequenced japonica cultivar Nipponbare. Using this population and the high-density markers, a total of 43 quantitative trait loci were identified for seven panicle- and grain-related traits. Among these loci, the novel locus qGL11 for grain length and thousand-grain weight was validated in a CSSL-derived segregating population and finely mapped to a 25-kb region that contains an IAA-amido synthetase gene OsGH3.13, This gene exhibited a significant expression difference in the young panicle between the near-isogenic lines that carry the contrasting Zhenshan 97 and Nipponbare alleles at qGL11. Expression and sequence analyses suggest that this gene is the most likely candidate for qGL11. Furthermore, several OsGH3.13 mutants induced by a CRISPR/Cas9 approach in either japonica or indica exhibit an increased grain length and thousand-grain weight, thus enhancing the final grain yield per plant. These findings provide insights into the genetic basis of grain size for the improvement of yield potential in rice breeding programs.
