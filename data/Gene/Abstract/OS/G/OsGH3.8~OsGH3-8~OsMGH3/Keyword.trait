OsGH3.8|OsGH3-8|OsMGH3	transcription factor	Auxin-responsive OsMGH3, a common downstream target of OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, controls rice floret fertility	 OsMGH3/OsGH3-8 is expressed abundantly in rice florets and is regulated by two related and redundant transcription factors, OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, but its contribution to flower development is not known
OsGH3.8|OsGH3-8|OsMGH3	iaa	Kinetic basis for the conjugation of auxin by a GH3 family indole-acetic acid-amido synthetase	 Here we use GH3-8 from Oryza sativa (rice; OsGH3-8), which functions as an indole-acetic acid (IAA)-amido synthetase, for detailed mechanistic studies
OsGH3.8|OsGH3-8|OsMGH3	branching	Auxin-responsive OsMGH3, a common downstream target of OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, controls rice floret fertility	 The overexpression of OsMGH3 during the vegetative phase affects the overall plant architecture, whereas its inflorescence-specific overexpression creates short panicles with reduced branching, resembling in part the effects of OsMADS1 overexpression
OsGH3.8|OsGH3-8|OsMGH3	fertility	Auxin-responsive OsMGH3, a common downstream target of OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, controls rice floret fertility	 Florets in OsMGH3 knock-down plants were affected in carpel development and pollen viability, both of which reduced fertility|Auxin-responsive OsMGH3, a common downstream target of OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, controls rice floret fertility
OsGH3.8|OsGH3-8|OsMGH3	vegetative	Auxin-responsive OsMGH3, a common downstream target of OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, controls rice floret fertility	 The overexpression of OsMGH3 during the vegetative phase affects the overall plant architecture, whereas its inflorescence-specific overexpression creates short panicles with reduced branching, resembling in part the effects of OsMADS1 overexpression
OsGH3.8|OsGH3-8|OsMGH3	auxin	Kinetic basis for the conjugation of auxin by a GH3 family indole-acetic acid-amido synthetase	 Steady-state kinetic analysis shows that the OsGH3-8 requires either Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) for maximal activity and is specific for aspartate but accepts asparagine as a substrate with a 45-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency and accepts other auxin analogs, including phenyl-acetic acid, indole butyric acid, and naphthalene-acetic acid, as acyl-acid substrates with 1
OsGH3.8|OsGH3-8|OsMGH3	flower	Auxin-responsive OsMGH3, a common downstream target of OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, controls rice floret fertility	 OsMGH3/OsGH3-8 is expressed abundantly in rice florets and is regulated by two related and redundant transcription factors, OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, but its contribution to flower development is not known
OsGH3.8|OsGH3-8|OsMGH3	panicle	Auxin-responsive OsMGH3, a common downstream target of OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, controls rice floret fertility	 The overexpression of OsMGH3 during the vegetative phase affects the overall plant architecture, whereas its inflorescence-specific overexpression creates short panicles with reduced branching, resembling in part the effects of OsMADS1 overexpression
OsGH3.8|OsGH3-8|OsMGH3	inflorescence	Auxin-responsive OsMGH3, a common downstream target of OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, controls rice floret fertility	 The overexpression of OsMGH3 during the vegetative phase affects the overall plant architecture, whereas its inflorescence-specific overexpression creates short panicles with reduced branching, resembling in part the effects of OsMADS1 overexpression
OsGH3.8|OsGH3-8|OsMGH3	root	Auxin-responsive OsMGH3, a common downstream target of OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, controls rice floret fertility	 In contrast, the down-regulation of endogenous OsMGH3 caused phenotypes consistent with auxin overproduction or activated signaling, such as ectopic rooting from aerial nodes
OsGH3.8|OsGH3-8|OsMGH3	flower	OsMADS1, a rice MADS-box factor, controls differentiation of specific cell types in the lemma and palea and is an early-acting regulator of inner floral organs	 Through a screen for OsMADS1 targets we identify a flower-specific Nt-gh3 type gene, OsMGH3, as a downstream gene
OsGH3.8|OsGH3-8|OsMGH3	pollen	Auxin-responsive OsMGH3, a common downstream target of OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, controls rice floret fertility	 Florets in OsMGH3 knock-down plants were affected in carpel development and pollen viability, both of which reduced fertility
OsGH3.8|OsGH3-8|OsMGH3	auxin	Auxin-responsive OsMGH3, a common downstream target of OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, controls rice floret fertility	 In contrast, the down-regulation of endogenous OsMGH3 caused phenotypes consistent with auxin overproduction or activated signaling, such as ectopic rooting from aerial nodes|Auxin-responsive OsMGH3, a common downstream target of OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, controls rice floret fertility
OsGH3.8|OsGH3-8|OsMGH3	architecture	Auxin-responsive OsMGH3, a common downstream target of OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, controls rice floret fertility	 The overexpression of OsMGH3 during the vegetative phase affects the overall plant architecture, whereas its inflorescence-specific overexpression creates short panicles with reduced branching, resembling in part the effects of OsMADS1 overexpression
