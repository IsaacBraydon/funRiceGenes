OsGH9A3	cellulose	Global identification of multiple OsGH9 family members and their involvement in cellulose crystallinity modification in rice	Our results showed that OsGH9A3 and B5 possessed an extremely high co-expression with OsCESA1, 3, and 8 typical for cellulose biosynthesis in rice
OsGH9A3	cellulose	Global identification of multiple OsGH9 family members and their involvement in cellulose crystallinity modification in rice	For the first time, OsGH9B1, 3, and 16 were characterized with the potential role in lignocellulose crystallinity alteration in rice, whereas OsGH9A3 and B5 were suggested for cellulose biosynthesis
