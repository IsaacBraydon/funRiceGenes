OsGDH2	crown root	Localization of NAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase in rice roots: candidates for providing carbon skeletons to NADH-glutamate synthase	Real-time PCR analysis showed that OsIDHa and OsIDHc;1 transcripts, but not OsGDH1 and OsGDH2 transcripts, accumulated in a similar manner to NADH-GOGAT mRNA along the crown roots after the supply of different forms of inorganic nitrogen
OsGDH2	salt	Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Salt stress clearly up-regulated the expression of OsGDH2 and OsGDH3 in old leaves, while strongly down-regulated expression of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves
OsGDH2	root	Localization of NAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase in rice roots: candidates for providing carbon skeletons to NADH-glutamate synthase	Real-time PCR analysis showed that OsIDHa and OsIDHc;1 transcripts, but not OsGDH1 and OsGDH2 transcripts, accumulated in a similar manner to NADH-GOGAT mRNA along the crown roots after the supply of different forms of inorganic nitrogen
