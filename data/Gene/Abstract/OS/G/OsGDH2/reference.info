BACKGROUND: It is well known that salt stress has different effects on old and young tissues. However, it remains largely unexplored whether old and young tissues have different regulatory mechanism during adaptation of plants to salt stress. The aim of this study was to investigate whether salt stress has different effects on the ion balance and nitrogen metabolism in the old and young leaves of rice, and to compare functions of both organs in rice salt tolerance. RESULTS: Rice protected young leaves from ion harm via the large accumulation of Na+ and Cl- in old leaves. The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 might contribute to accumulation of Na+ in old leaves under salt stress. In addition, lower expression of OsHKT1;5 and OsSOS1 in old leaves may decrease frequency of retrieving Na+ from old leaf cells. Under salt stress, old leaves showed higher concentration of NO3- content than young leaves. Up-regulation of OsNRT1;2, a gene coding nitrate transporter, might contribute to the accumulation of NO3- in the old leaves of salt stressed-rice. Salt stress clearly up-regulated the expression of OsGDH2 and OsGDH3 in old leaves, while strongly down-regulated expression of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves. CONCLUSIONS: The down-regulation of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves might be a harmful response to excesses of Na+ and Cl-. Under salt stress, rice might accumulate Na+ and Cl- to toxic levels in old leaves. This might influence photorespiration process, reduce NH4+ production from photorespiration, and immediately down-regulate the expression of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves of salt stressed rice. Excesses of Na+ and Cl- also might change the pathway of NH4+ assimilation in old leaves of salt stressed rice plants, weaken GOGAT/GS pathway and elevate GDH pathway.
Abiko-2005-Localization of NAD-.pdf	Localization of NAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase in rice roots: candidates for providing carbon skeletons to NADH-glutamate synthase	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Japan.	In rice roots, transient and cell-type-specific accumulation of both mRNA and protein for NADH-dependent glutamate synthase (NADH-GOGAT) occurs after the supply of NH(4) (+) ions. In order to better understand the origin of 2-oxoglutarate for this reaction, we focused on mitochondrial NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in rice roots. Six rice cDNAs encoding a single catalytic (OsIDHa) and two regulatory (OsIDHc;1, OsIDHc;2) IDH subunits and three GDH proteins (OsGDH1-3) were isolated. These genes, except OsGDH3, were expressed in the roots. Real-time PCR analysis showed that OsIDHa and OsIDHc;1 transcripts, but not OsGDH1 and OsGDH2 transcripts, accumulated in a similar manner to NADH-GOGAT mRNA along the crown roots after the supply of different forms of inorganic nitrogen. Furthermore, immunolocalization studies revealed the NH(4) (+) induction of IDHa protein in two cell layers of the root surface, i.e. epidermis and exodermis, where NADH-GOGAT also accumulated. The possible relationship between NADH-GOGAT, IDH and GDH is discussed.

Rice plants grown in paddy fields preferentially use ammonium as a source of inorganic nitrogen. Glutamine synthetase (GS) catalyses the conversion of ammonium to glutamine. Of the three genes encoding cytosolic GS in rice, OsGS1;1 is critical for normal growth and grain filling. However, the basis of its physiological function that may alter the rate of nitrogen assimilation and carbon metabolism within the context of metabolic networks remains unclear. To address this issue, we carried out quantitative comparative analyses between the metabolite profiles of a rice mutant lacking OsGS1;1 and its background wild type (WT). The mutant plants exhibited severe retardation of shoot growth in the presence of ammonium compared with the WT. Overaccumulation of free ammonium in the leaf sheath and roots of the mutant indicated the importance of OsGS1;1 for ammonium assimilation in both organs. The metabolite profiles of the mutant line revealed: (i) an imbalance in levels of sugars, amino acids and metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and (ii) overaccumulation of secondary metabolites, particularly in the roots under a continuous supply of ammonium. Metabolite-to-metabolite correlation analysis revealed the presence of mutant-specific networks between tryptamine and other primary metabolites in the roots. These results demonstrated a crucial function of OsGS1;1 in coordinating the global metabolic network in rice plants grown using ammonium as the nitrogen source.
nph12075.pdf	Indeterminate domain 10 regulates ammonium-mediated gene expression in rice roots	2013	New Phytol	Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 Program), Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Research Center, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 660-701, South Korea.	Indeterminate domain (IDD) genes are a family of plant transcriptional regulators that function in the control of development and metabolism during growth. Here, the function of Oryza sativa indeterminate domain 10 (OsIDD10) has been explored in rice plants. Compared with wild-type roots, idd10 mutant roots are hypersensitive to exogenous ammonium. This work aims to define the action of IDD10 on gene expression involved in ammonium uptake and nitrogen (N) metabolism. The ammonium induction of key ammonium uptake and assimilation genes was examined in the roots of idd10 mutants and IDD10 overexpressors. Molecular studies and transcriptome analysis were performed to identify target genes and IDD10 binding cis-elements. IDD10 activates the transcription of AMT1;2 and GDH2 by binding to a cis-element motif present in the promoter region of AMT1;2 and in the fifth intron of GDH2. IDD10 contributes significantly to the induction of several genes involved in N-linked metabolic and cellular responses, including genes encoding glutamine synthetase 2, nitrite reductases and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase. Furthermore, the possibility that IDD10 might influence the N-mediated feedback regulation of target genes was examined. This study demonstrates that IDD10 is involved in regulatory circuits that determine N-mediated gene expression in plant roots.
Wang-2012-Comparison of ion ba.pdf	Comparison of ion balance and nitrogen metabolism in old and young leaves of alkali-stressed rice plants	2012	PLoS One	Key laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of MOE, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, Jilin Province, China.	BACKGROUND: Alkali stress is an important agricultural contaminant and has complex effects on plant metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the alkali stress has different effects on the growth, ion balance, and nitrogen metabolism in old and young leaves of rice plants, and to compare functions of both organs in alkali tolerance. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The results showed that alkali stress only produced a small effect on the growth of young leaves, whereas strongly damaged old leaves. Rice protected young leaves from ion harm via the large accumulation of Na(+) and Cl(-) in old leaves. The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsAKT1, OsHAK1, OsHAK7, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 may contribute to the larger accumulation of Na(+) in old leaves under alkali stress. Alkali stress mightily reduced the NO(3)(-) contents in both organs. As old leaf cells have larger vacuole, under alkali stress these scarce NO(3)(-) was principally stored in old leaves. Accordingly, the expression of OsNRT1;1 and OsNRT1;2 in old leaves was up-regulated by alkali stress, revealing that the two genes might contribute to the accumulation of NO(3)(-) in old leaves. NO(3)(-) deficiency in young leaves under alkali stress might induce the reduction in OsNR1 expression and the subsequent lacking of NH(4)(+), which might be main reason for the larger down-regulation of OsFd-GOGAT and OsGS2 in young leaves. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results strongly indicated that, during adaptation of rice to alkali stress, young and old leaves have distinct mechanisms of ion balance and nitrogen metabolism regulation. We propose that the comparative studies of young and old tissues may be important for abiotic stress tolerance research.
