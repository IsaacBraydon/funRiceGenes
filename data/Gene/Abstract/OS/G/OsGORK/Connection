OsGORK|OsK5.2	OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsNAC2 positively affects salt-induced cell death and binds to the OsAP37 and OsCOX11 promoters.	 Furthermore, K+-efflux channels (OsGORK and OsSKOR) were obviously activated by OsNAC2
OsAKT1	OsGORK|OsK5.2	Tissue-Specific Regulation of Na+ and K+ Transporters Explains Genotypic Differences in Salinity Stress Tolerance in Rice.	 This trait was conferred by at least three complementary mechanisms: (1) its superior ability to activate H+-ATPase pump operation, both at transcriptional and functional levels; (2) reduced sensitivity of K+ efflux channels to reactive oxygen species; and (3) smaller upregulation in OsGORK and higher upregulation of OsAKT1 in tolerant cultivars in response to salt stress
