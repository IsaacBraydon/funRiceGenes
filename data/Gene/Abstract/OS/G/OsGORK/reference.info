NA	Differential gene expression of two outward-rectifying shaker-like potassium channels OsSKOR and OsGORK in rice	2015	Journal of Plant Biology	Molecular Breeding DivisionNational Academy of Agricultural Science, RDAJeonjuKorea	Shaker-like potassium channels are highly conserved voltage-dependent ion channels in plants. Rice, a monocot model plant, has similar numbers of shaker-like potassium channels as Arabidopsis. Although several inward-rectifying potassium channels have been identified, no outward-rectifying potassium channels have yet been reported for rice. Here, we identified two outward-rectifying shaker-like potassium channels in rice, with high amino acid sequence similarities to Arabidopsis stelar K+ outward rectifier (SKOR) and guard cell outward rectifying K+ channel (GORK). To characterize these channels we monitored their expression patterns in several tissues. qRTPCR and promoter-GUS analysis showed that OsSKOR is expressed in root vascular tissues, flower, and seed scutellum. OsGORK was expressed to some degree in most tissues, such as leaf blade, node, leaf sheath and root, but at high levels in flowers. This is the first report characterizing rice outward-rectifying potassium channels and contributes to understanding the regulation of potassium homeostasis in monocot plants.
NA	A dual role for the OsK5.2 ion channel in stomatal movements and K+ loading into xylem sap.	2017	Plant Physiol	B&amp;PMP UMR 5004 CNRS CITY: Montpellier France [FR].	The roles of potassium channels from the Shaker family in stomatal movements have been investigated by reverse genetics analyses in Arabidopsis, but corresponding information is lacking outside this model species. Rice and other cereals possess stomata that are more complex than those of Arabidopsis. We examined the role of the outward Shaker K+ channel gene OsK5.2. Expression of the OsK5.2 gene (GUS reporter strategy) was observed in the whole stomatal complex (guard cells and subsidiary cells), in the root vasculature and root cortex. In stomata, loss of OsK5.2 functional expression resulted in lack of time-dependent outward potassium currents in guard cells, higher rates of water loss through transpiration, and severe slowdown of stomatal closure. In line with the expression of OsK5.2 in the plant vasculature, mutant plants displayed a reduced K+ translocation from the root system towards the leaves via the xylem. The comparison between rice and Arabidopsis show that despite the strong conservation of Shaker family in plants, substantial differences can exist between the physiological roles of seemingly orthologous genes, as xylem loading depends on SKOR and stomatal closure on GORK in Arabidopsis, whereas both functions are executed by the single OsK5.2 Shaker in rice.
