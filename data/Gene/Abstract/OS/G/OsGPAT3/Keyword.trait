OsGPAT3	pollen	Glycerol-3-Phosphate Acyltransferase 3 (OsGPAT3) is required for anther development and male fertility in rice.	Compared with wild-type plants, the osgpat3 mutant displays smaller, pale yellow anthers with defective anther cuticle, degenerated pollen with defective exine, and abnormal tapetum development and degeneration
OsGPAT3	anther	Glycerol-3-Phosphate Acyltransferase 3 (OsGPAT3) is required for anther development and male fertility in rice.	OsGPAT3 is preferentially expressed in the tapetum and microspores of the anther
