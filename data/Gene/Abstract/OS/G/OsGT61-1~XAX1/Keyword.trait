OsGT61-1|XAX1	shoot	Transcript expression and regulatory characteristics of a rice glycosyltransferase OsGT61-1 gene	OsGT61-1 transcript was noted to be ABA- and NaCl-responsive and its expression was more prominent in root than in shoot tissues
OsGT61-1|XAX1	root	Transcript expression and regulatory characteristics of a rice glycosyltransferase OsGT61-1 gene	OsGT61-1 transcript was noted to be ABA- and NaCl-responsive and its expression was more prominent in root than in shoot tissues
OsGT61-1|XAX1	biomass	Hydroxycinnamic acid-modified xylan side chains and their cross-linking products in rice cell walls are reduced in the Xylosyl arabinosyl substitution of xylan 1 mutant.	 Ultimately, XAX1 plays a fundamental role in cross-linking, providing a potential target for the improvement of use of grass biomass
OsGT61-1|XAX1	lignin	Hydroxycinnamic acid-modified xylan side chains and their cross-linking products in rice cell walls are reduced in the Xylosyl arabinosyl substitution of xylan 1 mutant.	 Moreover, structures resembling the direct cross-link between xylan and lignin (ferulated arabinosyl substitutions bound to lignin monomers and dimers), together with diferulates known to cross-link xylan, are strongly reduced in xax1
OsGT61-1|XAX1	glycosyltransferase	Hydroxycinnamic acid-modified xylan side chains and their cross-linking products in rice cell walls are reduced in the Xylosyl arabinosyl substitution of xylan 1 mutant.	 XAX1 (Xylosyl arabinosyl substitution of xylan 1), a rice (Oryza sativa) member of the glycosyltransferase family GT61, has been described to add xylosyl residues to arabinosyl substitutions modified by ferulic acid
