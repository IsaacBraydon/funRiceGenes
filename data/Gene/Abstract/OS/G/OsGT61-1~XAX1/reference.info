1-s2.0-S0168945210000798-main.pdf	Transcript expression and regulatory characteristics of a rice glycosyltransferase OsGT61-1 gene	2010	Plant Science	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, Benito Juarez Road, Dhaula Kuan, New Delhi 110021, Indias	Glycosyltransferases (GTs) catalyze the reaction of glycosylation of various cellular macromolecules. Rice genome contains 609 potential GT genes which have been grouped into 40 gene families according to CAZy (Carbohydrate Active Enzyme) database. Phylogenetic tree showed that the members of GT61 family are related across genera. Close relationship among various rice GT61 proteins was also reflected from MEME analysis. Full-length cDNA corresponding to MSU rice locus Os02g22380 and encoding for xylosyltransferase was obtained (referred to as OsGT61-1). OsGT61-1 transcript was noted to be ABA- and NaCl-responsive and its expression was more prominent in root than in shoot tissues. Experiments involving fusion of OsGT61-1 promoter (1410 bp upstream to ATG) with GUS reporter gene showed that GUS expression was in consonance with the transcript expression. 1410 bp OsGT61-1 promoter contains two miniature inverted repeat transposable element sequences namely Gaijin (144 bp) and Wanderer (211 bp). Using yeast as trans-host, we noted that these sequences negatively influence the downstream transcript expression.
PNAS-2012-Chiniquy-17117-22.pdf	XAX1 from glycosyltransferase family 61 mediates xylosyltransfer to rice xylan	2012	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Plant Pathology and the Genome Center, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.	Xylan is the second most abundant polysaccharide on Earth and represents an immense quantity of stored energy for biofuel production. Despite its importance, most of the enzymes that synthesize xylan have yet to be identified. Xylans have a backbone of beta-1,4-linked xylose residues with substitutions that include alpha-(1-->2)-linked glucuronosyl, 4-O-methyl glucuronosyl, and alpha-1,2- and alpha-1,3-arabinofuranosyl residues. The substitutions are structurally diverse and vary by taxonomy, with grass xylan representing a unique composition distinct from dicots and other monocots. To date, no enzyme has yet been identified that is specific to grass xylan synthesis. We identified a xylose-deficient loss-of-function rice mutant in Os02g22380, a putative glycosyltransferase in a grass-specific subfamily of family GT61. We designate the mutant xax1 for xylosyl arabinosyl substitution of xylan 1. Enzymatic fingerprinting of xylan showed the specific absence in the mutant of a peak, which was isolated and determined by (1)H-NMR to be (beta-1,4-Xyl)(4) with a beta-Xylp-(1-->2)-alpha-Araf-(1-->3). Rice xax1 mutant plants are deficient in ferulic and coumaric acid, aromatic compounds known to be attached to arabinosyl residues in xylan substituted with xylosyl residues. The xax1 mutant plants exhibit an increased extractability of xylan and increased saccharification, probably reflecting a lower degree of diferulic cross-links. Activity assays with microsomes isolated from tobacco plants transiently expressing XAX1 demonstrated xylosyltransferase activity onto endogenous acceptors. Our results provide insight into grass xylan synthesis and how substitutions may be modified for increased saccharification for biofuel generation.
NA	Hydroxycinnamic acid-modified xylan side chains and their cross-linking products in rice cell walls are reduced in the Xylosyl arabinosyl substitution of xylan 1 mutant.	2021	Plant J	Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge, CB2 1QW, UK.	The intricate architecture of cell walls and the complex cross-linking of their components hinders some industrial and agricultural applications of plant biomass. Xylan is a key structural element of grass cell walls, closely interacting with other cell wall components such as cellulose and lignin. The main branching points of grass xylan, 3-linked l-arabinosyl substitutions, can be modified by ferulic acid (a hydroxycinnamic acid), which cross-links xylan to other xylan chains and lignin. XAX1 (Xylosyl arabinosyl substitution of xylan 1), a rice (Oryza sativa) member of the glycosyltransferase family GT61, has been described to add xylosyl residues to arabinosyl substitutions modified by ferulic acid. In this study, we characterize hydroxycinnamic acid-decorated arabinosyl substitutions present on rice xylan and their cross-linking, in order to decipher the role of XAX1 in xylan synthesis. Our results show a general reduction of hydroxycinnamic acid-modified 3-linked arabinosyl substitutions in xax1 mutant rice regardless of their modification with a xylosyl residue. Moreover, structures resembling the direct cross-link between xylan and lignin (ferulated arabinosyl substitutions bound to lignin monomers and dimers), together with diferulates known to cross-link xylan, are strongly reduced in xax1. Interestingly, apart from feruloyl and p-coumaroyl modifications on arabinose, putative caffeoyl and oxalyl modifications were characterized, which were also reduced in xax1. Our results suggest an alternative function of XAX1 in the transfer of hydroxycinnamic acid-modified arabinosyl substitutions to xylan, rather than xylosyl transfer to arabinosyl substitutions. Ultimately, XAX1 plays a fundamental role in cross-linking, providing a potential target for the improvement of use of grass biomass.
