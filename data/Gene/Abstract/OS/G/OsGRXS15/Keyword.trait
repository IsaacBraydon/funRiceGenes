OsGRXS15	transcription factor	Rice glutaredoxin GRXS15 confers broad-spectrum resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Fusarium fujikuroi	 The rice transcription factor OsWRKY65 was identified as a binding partner, and it directly interacted with OsGRXS15 in the nucleus
OsGRXS15	transcription factor	Rice glutaredoxin GRXS15 confers broad-spectrum resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Fusarium fujikuroi	 These results suggested that OsGRXS15 interacts with transcription factors, and it confers BSR through regulating the expression of genes related to pathogen response
OsGRXS15	resistance	Rice glutaredoxin GRXS15 confers broad-spectrum resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Fusarium fujikuroi	 Transgenic rice lines constitutively expressing OsGRXS15 showed enhanced disease resistance to Xoo and F
OsGRXS15	disease	Rice glutaredoxin GRXS15 confers broad-spectrum resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Fusarium fujikuroi	 Transgenic rice lines constitutively expressing OsGRXS15 showed enhanced disease resistance to Xoo and F
OsGRXS15	disease resistance	Rice glutaredoxin GRXS15 confers broad-spectrum resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Fusarium fujikuroi	 Transgenic rice lines constitutively expressing OsGRXS15 showed enhanced disease resistance to Xoo and F
OsGRXS15	pathogen	Rice glutaredoxin GRXS15 confers broad-spectrum resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Fusarium fujikuroi	 These results suggested that OsGRXS15 interacts with transcription factors, and it confers BSR through regulating the expression of genes related to pathogen response
OsGRXS15	nucleus	Rice glutaredoxin GRXS15 confers broad-spectrum resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Fusarium fujikuroi	 The rice transcription factor OsWRKY65 was identified as a binding partner, and it directly interacted with OsGRXS15 in the nucleus
