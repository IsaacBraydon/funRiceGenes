OsGLK1	chloroplast	Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells	 Using rice expression-microarray and northern blot analyses, we found that a large number of nucleus-encoded genes involved in chloroplast functions were highly expressed and transcripts of plastid-encoded genes, psaA, psbA and rbcL, increased in the OsGLK1-FOX calli| Transmission electron microscopy showed the existence of differentiated chloroplasts with grana stacks in OsGLK1-FOX calli cells| Furthermore, we found developed chloroplasts in vascular bundle and bundle sheath cells of coleoptiles and leaves from OsGLK1-FOX seedlings| The OsGLK1-FOX calli exhibited high photosynthetic activity and were able to grow on sucrose-depleted media, indicating that developed chloroplasts in OsGLK1-FOX rice calli are functional and active| These results strongly suggest that OsGLK1 regulates chloroplast development under the control of light and phytohormones, and that it is a key regulator of chloroplast development|Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells
OsGLK1	transcription factor	Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells	 In both lines, OsGLK1 cDNA encoding a GARP transcription factor was ectopically overexpressed|Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells
OsGLK1	seedling	Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells	 Furthermore, we found developed chloroplasts in vascular bundle and bundle sheath cells of coleoptiles and leaves from OsGLK1-FOX seedlings
OsGLK1	phytohormone	Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells	 These results strongly suggest that OsGLK1 regulates chloroplast development under the control of light and phytohormones, and that it is a key regulator of chloroplast development
OsGLK1	vascular bundle	Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells	 Furthermore, we found developed chloroplasts in vascular bundle and bundle sheath cells of coleoptiles and leaves from OsGLK1-FOX seedlings
OsGLK1	sheath	Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells	 Furthermore, we found developed chloroplasts in vascular bundle and bundle sheath cells of coleoptiles and leaves from OsGLK1-FOX seedlings
