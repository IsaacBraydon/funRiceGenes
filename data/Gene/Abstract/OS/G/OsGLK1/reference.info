Nakamura-2009-Ectopic overexpressi.pdf	Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Division of Genome and Biodiversity Research, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan. hnakamura@pgr1.ch.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp	For systematic and genome-wide analyses of rice gene functions, we took advantage of the full-length cDNA overexpresser (FOX) gene-hunting system and generated >12 000 independent FOX-rice lines from >25 000 rice calli treated with the rice-FOX Agrobacterium library. We found two FOX-rice lines generating green calli on a callus-inducing medium containing 2,4-D, on which wild-type rice calli became ivory yellow. In both lines, OsGLK1 cDNA encoding a GARP transcription factor was ectopically overexpressed. Using rice expression-microarray and northern blot analyses, we found that a large number of nucleus-encoded genes involved in chloroplast functions were highly expressed and transcripts of plastid-encoded genes, psaA, psbA and rbcL, increased in the OsGLK1-FOX calli. Transmission electron microscopy showed the existence of differentiated chloroplasts with grana stacks in OsGLK1-FOX calli cells. However, in darkness, OsGLK1-FOX calli did not show a green color or develop grana stacks. Furthermore, we found developed chloroplasts in vascular bundle and bundle sheath cells of coleoptiles and leaves from OsGLK1-FOX seedlings. The OsGLK1-FOX calli exhibited high photosynthetic activity and were able to grow on sucrose-depleted media, indicating that developed chloroplasts in OsGLK1-FOX rice calli are functional and active. We also observed that the endogenous OsGLK1 mRNA level increased synchronously with the greening of wild-type calli after transfer to plantlet regeneration medium. These results strongly suggest that OsGLK1 regulates chloroplast development under the control of light and phytohormones, and that it is a key regulator of chloroplast development.
NA	Rice carotenoid biofortification and yield improvement conferred by endosperm-specific overexpression of OsGLK1.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Shanghai Key Laboratory of Agricultural Genetics and Breeding, Agro-Biotechnology Research Institute, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shanghai, China.	Carotenoids, indispensable isoprenoid phytonutrients, are synthesized in plastids and are known to be deficient in rice endosperm. Many studies, involving transgenic manipulations of carotenoid biosynthetic genes, have been performed to obtain carotenoid-enriched rice grains. Nuclear-encoded GOLDEN2-LIKE (GLK) transcription factors play important roles in the regulation of plastid and thylakoid grana development. Here, we show that endosperm-specific overexpression of rice GLK1 gene (OsGLK1) leads to enhanced carotenoid production, increased grain yield, but deteriorated grain quality in rice. Subsequently, we performed the bioengineering of carotenoids biosynthesis in rice endosperm by introducing other three carotenogenic genes, tHMG1, ZmPSY1, and PaCrtI, which encode the enzymes truncated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, phytoene synthase, and phytoene desaturase, respectively. Transgenic overexpression of all four genes (OsGLK1, tHMG1, ZmPSY1, and PaCrtI) driven by rice endosperm-specific promoter GluB-1 established a mini carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in the endosperm and exerted a roughly multiplicative effect on the carotenoid accumulation as compared with the overexpression of only three genes (tHMG1, ZmPSY1, and PaCrtI). In addition, the yield enhancement and quality reduction traits were also present in the transgenic rice overexpressing the selected four genes. Our results revealed that OsGLK1 confers favorable characters in rice endosperm and could help to refine strategies for the carotenoid and other plastid-synthesized micronutrient fortification in bioengineered plants.
