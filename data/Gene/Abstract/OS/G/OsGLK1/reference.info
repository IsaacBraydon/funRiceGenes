Nakamura-2009-Ectopic overexpressi.pdf	Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Division of Genome and Biodiversity Research, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan. hnakamura@pgr1.ch.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp	For systematic and genome-wide analyses of rice gene functions, we took advantage of the full-length cDNA overexpresser (FOX) gene-hunting system and generated >12 000 independent FOX-rice lines from >25 000 rice calli treated with the rice-FOX Agrobacterium library. We found two FOX-rice lines generating green calli on a callus-inducing medium containing 2,4-D, on which wild-type rice calli became ivory yellow. In both lines, OsGLK1 cDNA encoding a GARP transcription factor was ectopically overexpressed. Using rice expression-microarray and northern blot analyses, we found that a large number of nucleus-encoded genes involved in chloroplast functions were highly expressed and transcripts of plastid-encoded genes, psaA, psbA and rbcL, increased in the OsGLK1-FOX calli. Transmission electron microscopy showed the existence of differentiated chloroplasts with grana stacks in OsGLK1-FOX calli cells. However, in darkness, OsGLK1-FOX calli did not show a green color or develop grana stacks. Furthermore, we found developed chloroplasts in vascular bundle and bundle sheath cells of coleoptiles and leaves from OsGLK1-FOX seedlings. The OsGLK1-FOX calli exhibited high photosynthetic activity and were able to grow on sucrose-depleted media, indicating that developed chloroplasts in OsGLK1-FOX rice calli are functional and active. We also observed that the endogenous OsGLK1 mRNA level increased synchronously with the greening of wild-type calli after transfer to plantlet regeneration medium. These results strongly suggest that OsGLK1 regulates chloroplast development under the control of light and phytohormones, and that it is a key regulator of chloroplast development.
NA	Rice carotenoid biofortification and yield improvement conferred by endosperm-specific overexpression of OsGLK1.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Shanghai Key Laboratory of Agricultural Genetics and Breeding, Agro-Biotechnology Research Institute, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shanghai, China.	Carotenoids, indispensable isoprenoid phytonutrients, are synthesized in plastids and are known to be deficient in rice endosperm. Many studies, involving transgenic manipulations of carotenoid biosynthetic genes, have been performed to obtain carotenoid-enriched rice grains. Nuclear-encoded GOLDEN2-LIKE (GLK) transcription factors play important roles in the regulation of plastid and thylakoid grana development. Here, we show that endosperm-specific overexpression of rice GLK1 gene (OsGLK1) leads to enhanced carotenoid production, increased grain yield, but deteriorated grain quality in rice. Subsequently, we performed the bioengineering of carotenoids biosynthesis in rice endosperm by introducing other three carotenogenic genes, tHMG1, ZmPSY1, and PaCrtI, which encode the enzymes truncated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, phytoene synthase, and phytoene desaturase, respectively. Transgenic overexpression of all four genes (OsGLK1, tHMG1, ZmPSY1, and PaCrtI) driven by rice endosperm-specific promoter GluB-1 established a mini carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in the endosperm and exerted a roughly multiplicative effect on the carotenoid accumulation as compared with the overexpression of only three genes (tHMG1, ZmPSY1, and PaCrtI). In addition, the yield enhancement and quality reduction traits were also present in the transgenic rice overexpressing the selected four genes. Our results revealed that OsGLK1 confers favorable characters in rice endosperm and could help to refine strategies for the carotenoid and other plastid-synthesized micronutrient fortification in bioengineered plants.
NA	Golden 2-like transcription factor contributes to the major QTL against rice black-streaked dwarf virus disease.	2022	Theor Appl Genet	Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Food Quality and Safety-State Key Laboratory Cultivation Base, Institute of Plant Protection, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, 210014, Jiangsu Province, China.	A major resistance QTL was identified on chromosome 6 in rice variety Wuke; both overexpression and knockdown experiments confirmed that OsGLK1 is the candidate gene for association with Rice black-streaked dwarf virus disease. Rice black-streaked dwarf virus disease is one of the most destructive rice viral diseases in China and East Asia. Progress has been limited in RBSDVD resistance breeding due to inadequate knowledge on the underlying functional genes. In this study, a major QTL for RBSDV (rice black-streaked dwarf virus) independent of SBPH (small brown planthopper) resistance was mapped in a 1.8Â Mb interval on chromosome 6 by using an F(2:3) population originated from resistant rice variety Wuke. Representative transcripts within this region were analysed and three genes showing amino acid sequence variation in functional domains were selected for transformation. Overexpression experiments showed that one gene exhibited significant enhanced resistance compared to control lines, encoding protein involving Myb domain and probable transcription factor Golden 2-like1 (GLK1). Furthermore, OsGLK1 knockdown rice lines were investigated and the resistance ability was significantly declined without this gene compared to the wild type. Taken together, both overexpression and knockdown experiments strongly suggested that OsGLK1 plays an important role for RBSDV resistance and contributes to the major QTL. The study paves the way for elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying RBSDVD resistance and the molecular markers associated with OsGLK1 may be used for marker-assisted selection.
NA	Shade represses photosynthetic genes by disrupting the DNA binding of GOLDEN2-LIKE1.	2022	Plant Physiol	Department of Biological Sciences, KAIST, Daejeon 34141, Korea.	PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) repress photosynthetic genes partly by upregulating REPRESSOR OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC GENES 1 (RPGE1) and RPGE2. However, it is unknown how RPGEs inhibit gene expression at the molecular level. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) RPGE overexpression lines display extensive similarities to the golden2-like 1 (glk1)/glk2 double mutant at the phenotypic and transcriptomic levels, prompting us to hypothesize that there is a close molecular relationship between RPGEs and chloroplast development-regulating GLK transcription factors. Indeed, we found that RPGE1 disrupts the homodimerization of GLK1 by interacting with its dimerization domain and debilitates the DNA-binding activity of GLK1. The interaction was not restricted to the Arabidopsis RPGE1-GLK1 pair, but rather extended to RPGE-GLK homolog pairs across species, providing a molecular basis for the pale green leaves of Arabidopsis transgenic lines expressing a rice (Oryza sativa) RPGE homolog. Our discovery of RPGE-GLK regulatory pairs suggests that any condition leading to an increase in RPGE levels would decrease the expression levels of GLK target genes. Consistently, we found that shade, which upregulates the RPGE mRNA by stabilizing PIFs, represses the expression of photosynthetic genes partly by inhibiting the DNA-binding activity of GLK1. Taken together, these results indicate that RPGE-GLK regulatory pairs regulate photosynthetic gene expression downstream of PIFs.
