OsGLK1	OsPIL13|OsPIL1	Rice Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like1 (OsPIL1) is involved in the promotion of chlorophyll biosynthesis through feed-forward regulatory loops.	 In addition, OsPIL1 directly up-regulates the expression of two transcription factor genes, GOLDEN2-LIKE1 (OsGLK1) and OsGLK2
OsGLK1	OsGLK2	DEEP GREEN PANICLE1 suppresses GOLDEN2-LIKE activity to reduce chlorophyll synthesis in rice glumes.	 Importantly, we found that DGP1 interacts with the rice proteins GOLDEN2-LIKE1 (OsGLK1) and GOLDEN2-LIKE2 (OsGLK2), the two transcription factors involved in the regulation of photosynthesis
DGP1	OsGLK1	DEEP GREEN PANICLE1 suppresses GOLDEN2-LIKE activity to reduce chlorophyll synthesis in rice glumes.	 Importantly, we found that DGP1 interacts with the rice proteins GOLDEN2-LIKE1 (OsGLK1) and GOLDEN2-LIKE2 (OsGLK2), the two transcription factors involved in the regulation of photosynthesis
DGP1	OsGLK1	DEEP GREEN PANICLE1 suppresses GOLDEN2-LIKE activity to reduce chlorophyll synthesis in rice glumes.	 Transactivation assays showed that DGP1 represses the activation activity of OsGLK1 on its target genes
OsCPPR1	OsGLK1	A cytosolic pentatricopeptide repeat protein is essential for tapetal plastid development by regulating OsGLK1 transcript levels in rice.	 Transcriptome analysis revealed that the transcript level of OsGOLDEN-LIKE1 (OsGLK1), which encodes a transcription factor that regulates plastid development and maintenance, was significantly higher in the OsCPPR1 knockdown plants compared to wild-type plants
OsCPPR1	OsGLK1	A cytosolic pentatricopeptide repeat protein is essential for tapetal plastid development by regulating OsGLK1 transcript levels in rice.	 We further determined that OsCPPR1 downregulates OsGLK1 transcription by directly binding to the single-stranded regions of OsGLK1 mRNAs
OsCPPR1	OsGLK1	A cytosolic pentatricopeptide repeat protein is essential for tapetal plastid development by regulating OsGLK1 transcript levels in rice.	 Overexpression of OsGLK1 resulted in abnormal tapetum and plastid development, similar to that seen in OsCPPR1 knockdown plants, and suppression of OsGLK1 partially restored pollen fertility in the OsCPPR1 knockdown plants
OsCPPR1	OsGLK1	A cytosolic pentatricopeptide repeat protein is essential for tapetal plastid development by regulating OsGLK1 transcript levels in rice.	 We therefore conclude that OsCPPR1 suppresses OsGLK1 in the regulation of plastid development and PCD in the tapetum
