OsGLK1	OsPIL13|OsPIL1	Rice Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like1 (OsPIL1) is involved in the promotion of chlorophyll biosynthesis through feed-forward regulatory loops.	 In addition, OsPIL1 directly up-regulates the expression of two transcription factor genes, GOLDEN2-LIKE1 (OsGLK1) and OsGLK2
OsGLK1	OsGLK2	DEEP GREEN PANICLE1 suppresses GOLDEN2-LIKE activity to reduce chlorophyll synthesis in rice glumes.	 Importantly, we found that DGP1 interacts with the rice proteins GOLDEN2-LIKE1 (OsGLK1) and GOLDEN2-LIKE2 (OsGLK2), the two transcription factors involved in the regulation of photosynthesis

DGP1	OsGLK1	DEEP GREEN PANICLE1 suppresses GOLDEN2-LIKE activity to reduce chlorophyll synthesis in rice glumes.	 Transactivation assays showed that DGP1 represses the activation activity of OsGLK1 on its target genes
