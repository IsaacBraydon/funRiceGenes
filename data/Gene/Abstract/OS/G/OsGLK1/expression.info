OsGLK1	Rice carotenoid biofortification and yield improvement conferred by endosperm-specific overexpression of OsGLK1. |  Here, we show that endosperm-specific overexpression of rice GLK1 gene (OsGLK1) leads to enhanced carotenoid production, increased grain yield, but deteriorated grain quality in rice |  Transgenic overexpression of all four genes (OsGLK1, tHMG1, ZmPSY1, and PaCrtI) driven by rice endosperm-specific promoter GluB-1 established a mini carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in the endosperm and exerted a roughly multiplicative effect on the carotenoid accumulation as compared with the overexpression of only three genes (tHMG1, ZmPSY1, and PaCrtI)	Rice carotenoid biofortification and yield improvement conferred by endosperm-specific overexpression of OsGLK1. |  Here, we show that endosperm-specific overexpression of rice GLK1 gene (OsGLK1) leads to enhanced carotenoid production, increased grain yield, but deteriorated grain quality in rice |  Transgenic overexpression of all four genes (OsGLK1, tHMG1, ZmPSY1, and PaCrtI) driven by rice endosperm-specific promoter GluB-1 established a mini carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in the endosperm and exerted a roughly multiplicative effect on the carotenoid accumulation as compared with the overexpression of only three genes (tHMG1, ZmPSY1, and PaCrtI)
