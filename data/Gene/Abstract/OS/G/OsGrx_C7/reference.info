Arsenic (As) is an acute poison and class I carcinogen, can cause a serious health risk. Staple crops like rice are the primary source of As contamination in human food. Rice grown on As contaminated areas accumulates higher As in their edible parts. Based on our previous transcriptome data, two rice glutaredoxins (OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1) were identified that showed up-regulated expression during As stress. Here, we report OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 from rice involved in the regulation of intracellular arsenite (AsIII). To elucidate the mechanism of OsGrx mediated As tolerance, both OsGrxs were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (Δars) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strains (Δycf1, Δacr3). The expression of OsGrxs increased As tolerance in E. coli (Δars) mutant strain (up to 4 mM AsV and up to 0.6 mM AsIII). During AsIII exposure, S. cerevisiae (Δacr3) harboring OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 have lower intracellular AsIII accumulation (up to 30.43% and 24.90%, respectively), compared to vector control. Arsenic accumulation in As-sensitive S. cerevisiae mutant (Δycf1) also reduced significantly on exposure to inorganic As. The expression of OsGrxs in yeast maintained intracellular GSH pool and increased extracellular GSH concentration. Purified OsGrxs displays in vitro GSH-disulfide oxidoreductase, glutathione reductase and arsenate reductase activities. Also, both OsGrxs are involved in AsIII extrusion by altering the Fps1 transcripts in yeast and protect the cell by maintaining cellular GSH pool. Thus, our results strongly suggest that OsGrxs play a crucial role in the maintenance of the intracellular GSH pool and redox status of the cell during both AsV and AsIII stress and might be involved in regulating intracellular AsIII levels by modulation of aquaporin expression and functions.
NA	Overexpression of Rice Glutaredoxin OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 Reduces Intracellular Arsenic Accumulation and Increases Tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Genetics and Molecular Biology Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-National Botanical Research InstituteLucknow, India; Department of Biotechnology, Kumaun UniversityNainital, India.	Glutaredoxins (Grxs) are a family of small multifunctional proteins involved in various cellular functions, including redox regulation and protection under oxidative stress. Despite the high number of Grx genes in plant genomes (48 Grxs in rice), the biological functions and physiological roles of most of them remain unknown. Here, the functional characterization of the two arsenic-responsive rice Grx family proteins, OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 are reported. Over-expression of OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana conferred arsenic (As) tolerance as reflected by germination, root growth assay, and whole plant growth. Also, the transgenic expression of OsGrxs displayed significantly reduced As accumulation in A. thaliana seeds and shoot tissues compared to WT plants during both AsIII and AsV stress. Thus, OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 seem to be an important determinant of As-stress response in plants. OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 transgenic showed to maintain intracellular GSH pool and involved in lowering AsIII accumulation either by extrusion or reducing uptake by altering the transcript of A. thaliana AtNIPs. Overall, OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 may represent a Grx family protein involved in As stress response and may allow a better understanding of the As induced stress pathways and the design of strategies for the improvement of stress tolerance as well as decreased As content in crops.
NA	CC-type glutaredoxin, OsGrx_C7 plays a crucial role in enhancing protection against salt stress in rice	2021	J Biotechnol	Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Division, CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, India; Department of Botany, University of Lucknow, India.	Soil salinity is one of the critical issue worldwide that adversely affect soil fertility. Salt stress significantly limits crop yield and grain quality; therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a strategy to improve salt stress tolerance. In present study, we reported that rice glutaredoxin (OsGrx_C7) plays a positive response in salt induced stress. Gene expression analysis, silencing, and overexpression of OsGrx_C7 gene were used to discover the role of OsGrx_C7 in response to salt stress. Gene expression analysis suggested that OsGrx_C7 expression was induced under salt stress and ubiquitously expressed in rice including root and shoot. The silencing of osgrx_c7 gene leads to increased sensitivity to salt stress, indicating its importance in salt stress tolerance. A gain-of-function approach showed that OsGrx_C7 may act as an important determinant in salt stress, compared with WT, and revealed higher biomass accumulation, improved root and plant growth under salt stress. Under salt stress condition, OsGrx_C7 overexpressing rice plants showed lower level of lipid peroxidation and Na+/K+ ratio, while proline accumulation, soluble sugar content and GSH/GSSG ratio was higher compared to WT. Furthermore, expression analysis suggested that OsGrx_C7 acted as positive regulator of salt tolerance by reinforcing the expression of transporters (OsHKT2;1, OsHKT1;5 and OsSOS1) engaged in Na+ homeostasis in overexpressing plants. Overall our study revealed that OsGrx_C7 emerged as a key mediator in response to salt stress in rice and could be used for engineering tolerance against salt stress in rice and other crops.
