OsGrx10	tolerance	The calcium-dependent kinase OsCPK24 functions in cold stress responses in rice.	 Together, our results suggest that OsCPK24 functions as a positive regulator of cold stress tolerance in rice, a process mediated by calcium signaling and involving phosphorylation and the inhibition of OsGrx10 to sustain higher glutathione levels
