OsGRX19|MIL1	cell cycle	Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin	 Furthermore, analysis of mil1 msp1 double mutants reveals that due to the absence of MIL1, the cells in their anther locule center do not activate meiotic cell cycle either, generating a similar anther phenotype to mil1
OsGRX19|MIL1	pollen	Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin	 We show here that plant pollen mother cells contain a specific meiosis initiation machinery through characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) gene, MICROSPORELESS1 (MIL1)
OsGRX19|MIL1	fertility	Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin	 The mil1 mutant does not produce microspores in anthers but has the normal female fertility
OsGRX19|MIL1	microspore	Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin	 We show here that plant pollen mother cells contain a specific meiosis initiation machinery through characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) gene, MICROSPORELESS1 (MIL1)| The mil1 mutant does not produce microspores in anthers but has the normal female fertility| Detailed molecular and cytological investigations demonstrate that mil1 anthers are defective in the meiotic entry of sporogenous cell progenies and in the differentiation of surrounding somatic cell layers, resulting in locules filled with somatic cells instead of microspores
OsGRX19|MIL1	meiotic	Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin	 Detailed molecular and cytological investigations demonstrate that mil1 anthers are defective in the meiotic entry of sporogenous cell progenies and in the differentiation of surrounding somatic cell layers, resulting in locules filled with somatic cells instead of microspores| Furthermore, analysis of mil1 msp1 double mutants reveals that due to the absence of MIL1, the cells in their anther locule center do not activate meiotic cell cycle either, generating a similar anther phenotype to mil1| These results suggest meiotic entry in microsporocytes is directed by an anther-specific mechanism, which requires MIL1 activity, and redox regulation might play important roles in this process
OsGRX19|MIL1	meiosis	Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin	 We show here that plant pollen mother cells contain a specific meiosis initiation machinery through characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) gene, MICROSPORELESS1 (MIL1)

OsGRX19|MIL1	transcription factor	Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin	 MIL1 encodes a plant-specific CC-type glutaredoxin, which could interact with TGA transcription factors
