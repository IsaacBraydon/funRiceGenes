Glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1,6.4.2) is an important reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzyme. The present study examined the relative importance of Na(+), Cl(-), and the osmotic component in NaCl-induced expression of Oryza sativa glutathione reductase (OsGR) genes in rice roots. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA levels for one cytosolic (OsGR2) and two chloroplastic (OsGR1 and OsGR3) isoforms of GR identified in the rice genome. The expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 but not OsGR1 was increased in rice roots treated with NaCl. Treatment with 150 mM NaCl and 150 mM NaNO(3) affected OsGR2 and OsGR3 induction similarly, which suggests that Na(+) but not Cl(-) is required for the NaCl-induced expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3. We also show that Na(+) but not Cl(-) is required for NaCl-enhanced GR activity and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production in rice roots. In addition to its component of ion toxicity, salt concentration in soil results in an osmotic effect. Here, we show that OsGR2 and OsGR3 expression, GR activity, and H(2)O(2) content were not affected at a concentration of mannitol iso-osmotic with 150 mM NaCl. NaCl-induced OsGR2 and OsGR3 in rice roots could be associated with Na(+) but not an osmotic component.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is considered a signal molecule inducing cellular stress. Both heat shock (HS) and Cd can increase H2O2 content. We investigated the involvement of H2O2 in HS- and Cd-mediated changes in the expression of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) in leaves of rice seedlings. HS treatment increased the content of H2O2 before it increased activities of APX and GR in rice leaves. Moreover, HS-induced H2O2 production and APX and GR activities could be counteracted by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors dipehenylene iodonium (DPI) and imidazole (IMD). HS-induced OsAPX2 gene expression was associated with HS-induced APX activity but was not regulated by H2O2. Cd-increased H2O2 content and APX and GR activities were lower with than without HS. Cd did not increase the expression of OsAPX and OsGR without HS treatment. Cd increased H2O2 content by Cd before it increased APX and GR activities without HS. Treatment with DPI and IMD effectively inhibited Cd-induced H2O2 production and APX and GR activities. Moreover, the effects of DPI and IMD could be rescued with H2O2 treatment. H2O2 may be involved in the regulation of HS- and Cd-increased APX and GR activities in leaves of rice seedlings.
148.pdf	NaCl-induced expression of glutathione reductase in roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings is mediated through hydrogen peroxide but not abscisic acid	2009	Plant and Soil	Department of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in NaCl stress. Plants tolerant to NaCl stress may evolve certain strategies to remove these ROS, thus reducing their toxic effects. Therefore, the expression patterns of the gene family encoding glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2) were analyzed in roots of etiolated rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings in response to NaCl stress. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was applied to quantify the mRNA levels for one cytosolic (OsGR2) and two chloroplastic (OsGR1 and OsGR3) isoforms of glutathione reductase identified in the rice genome. The expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 but not OsGR1 was increased in rice roots treated with 150 mM NaCl. The Rab16A is an abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive rice gene. Increasing concentrations of ABA, from 1 to 12 Î¼M, progressively increased the expression of OsRab16A in rice roots. In the present study, the ABA level was judged by the expression of OsRab16A in rice roots. Treatment with 150 mM NaCl induced the expression of OsRab16A, and the expression increased with increasing concentrations of ABA, which suggests that ABA may be involved in this response in rice roots. In fact, exogenous application of ABA enhanced the expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 in rice roots. On inhibiting ABA accumulation with sodium tungstate (Tu), an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis, the expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 was still induced by NaCl; therefore, NaCl-triggered expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 in rice roots is not mediated by accumulation of ABA. However, NaCl treatment could induce H2O2 production in rice roots, and H2O2 treatment resulted in enhanced OsGR2 and OsGR3 induction. On inhibiting the NaCl-induced accumulation of H2O2 with diphenylene iodonium, the expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 was also suppressed. Moreover, the increase in H2O2 level was prior to the induction of OsGR2 and OsGR3 in NaCl-treated rice roots. Thus, H2O2, but not ABA, is involved in regulation of OsGR2 and OsGR3 expression in NaCl-treated rice roots.
Plant Cell Physiol-1998-Kaminaka-1269-80.pdf	Gene cloning and expression of cytosolic glutathione reductase in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	1998	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Faculty of Agriculture, Kyoto Prefectural University, Japan.	We have isolated a cDNA (RGRC2) encoding glutathione reductase (GR) from rice (Oryza sativa L.). The comparison of deduced amino acid sequences from RGRC2 and other plant GR cDNAs indicated that RGRC2 encodes a putative cytosolic isoform. The recombinant RGRC2 protein had enzymatic properties comparable to those of GR from rice embryo. Subcellular fractionation showed that the RGRC2 protein is localized primarily in cytosol. mRNA and protein of RGRC2 were observed mainly in roots and calli but little in leaf tissues. Southern blot analysis showed that the RGRC2 gene exists as a single copy gene. Here, we have also isolated a genomic clone completely corresponding to RGRC2. The RGRC2 gene is split into 16 exons spread about 7.4 kb of chromosomal DNA, with coding sequence beginning in the 2nd exon and ending in the 16th exon. From the presence of two ABA-responsive elements in the 5'-flanking region of RGRC2, we examined the expression in rice seedlings treated with ABA and the ABA-related environmental stresses, chilling, drought and salinity. The expression of RGRC2 was strongly induced by all these treatments. We suggest that the expression of the rice cytosolic GR gene is regulated via ABA-mediated signal transduction pathway under environmental stresses.
