OsGatB	root	OsGatB, the Subunit of tRNA-Dependent Amidotransferase, Is Required for Primary Root Development in Rice.	 In the root, OsGatB was predominantly expressed in the root tip and played an important role in cell division and elongation there
OsGatB	root	OsGatB, the Subunit of tRNA-Dependent Amidotransferase, Is Required for Primary Root Development in Rice.	 OsGatB was localized in the mitochondria, and mitochondrial structure and function were all affected in Osgatb root tip cells
OsGatB	cell division	OsGatB, the Subunit of tRNA-Dependent Amidotransferase, Is Required for Primary Root Development in Rice.	 In the root, OsGatB was predominantly expressed in the root tip and played an important role in cell division and elongation there
