OsGUN4	 The expression of OsGUN4, however, was significantly reduced in HYB compared with LTB in terms of both transcript abundance (0 |  In summary, we have identified an epi-allele of OsGUN4 as the causal gene of the xantha marker trait and revealed that enhanced methylation in its promoter down-regulated its expression in rice
OsGUN4	 In our previous studies, we generated an epi-mutant allele of OsGUN4 (gun4 epi ), which downregulated its expression to бл0 |  The expression of OsGUN4 was light responsive and had two peaks in the daytime |  The transcription of these eight PRX genes was restored in transgenic HYB protoplasts overexpressing OsGUN4, while their expression was repressed in LTB protoplasts transformed with an OsGUN4 silencing vector |  We conclude that OsGUN4 is indispensable for rice, its expression is light- and oxidative-stress responsive, and it plays a role in ROS accumulation via its involvement in the transcriptional regulation of PRX genes
