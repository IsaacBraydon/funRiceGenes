OsGUN4	magnesium	C-terminal residues of oryza sativa GUN4 are required for the activation of the ChlH subunit of magnesium chelatase in chlorophyll synthesis	 Maximum magnesium chelatase activity requires pre-activation of OsChlH with OsGUN4, Mg(2+) and protoporphyrin-IX| OsGUN4 and OsChlH preincubated without protoporphyrin-IX yields magnesium chelatase activity similar to assays without OsGUN4, suggesting formation of a dead-end complex
