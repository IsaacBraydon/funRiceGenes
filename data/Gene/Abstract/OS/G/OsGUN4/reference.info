Oryza sativa GUN4 together with the magnesium chelatase subunits ChlI, ChlD, and ChlH have been heterologously expressed and purified to reconstitute magnesium chelatase activity in vitro. Maximum magnesium chelatase activity requires pre-activation of OsChlH with OsGUN4, Mg(2+) and protoporphyrin-IX. OsGUN4 and OsChlH preincubated without protoporphyrin-IX yields magnesium chelatase activity similar to assays without OsGUN4, suggesting formation of a dead-end complex. Either 9 or 10 C-terminal amino acids of OsGUN4 are slowly hydrolyzed to yield a truncated OsGUN4. These truncated OsGUN4 still bind protoporphyrin-IX and Mg-protoporphyrin-IX but are unable to activate OsChlH. This suggests the mechanism of GUN4 activation of magnesium chelatase is different in eukaryotes compared to cyanobacteria as the orthologous cyanobacterial GUN4 proteins lack this C-terminal extension.
NA	A down-regulated epi-allele of the genomes uncoupled 4 gene generates a xantha marker trait in rice.	2014	Theor Appl Genet	National Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Institute of Crop Sciences, Zhejiang University, 310029, Hangzhou, China.	A ¦Ã-ray-induced xantha trait is epigenetically controlled by the genomes uncoupled 4 gene with enhanced promoter segment methylation and down-regulated expression in rice. For easy testing and to increase varietal purity, a xantha mutation (xnt), which turns plants yellow and makes them visually distinguishable from normal green rice, has been generated and bred into male sterile lines for hybrid rice production. The xnt locus was previously fine mapped to a ~100-kb interval on chromosome 11, but its identity was unknown. In this study, xnt was further narrowed down to a 57-kb fragment carrying eight opening reading frames (ORFs). All eight ORFs had identical genomic sequences and all but ORF2 (g enomes uncoupled 4, OsGUN4) had similar transcript abundance in the xantha mutant Huangyu B (HYB) and its parental variety Longtefu B (LTB). The expression of OsGUN4, however, was significantly reduced in HYB compared with LTB in terms of both transcript abundance (0.2% that of LTB) and expressed protein level (barely detectable in HYB but greater than the heat shock protein reference in LTB). Therefore, OsGUN4 was identified as the candidate gene underlying the xantha trait. The function of OsGUN4 in the xantha phenotype was confirmed by identification and characterization of new allelic OsGUN4 mutations. Comparative bisulfite genomic sequencing of OsGUN4 revealed increased methylation in a promoter region in the mutant, and the correlation between increased methylation and the xantha phenotype was further verified by demethylation treatment. In summary, we have identified an epi-allele of OsGUN4 as the causal gene of the xantha marker trait and revealed that enhanced methylation in its promoter down-regulated its expression in rice.
NA	A Suppressor Mutation Partially Reverts the xantha Trait via Lowered Methylation in the Promoter of Genomes Uncoupled 4 in Rice.	2019	Front Plant Sci	National Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Institute of Crop Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	The xantha trait of a yellow leaf rice mutant (HYB), controlled epigenetically by elevated CHG methylation of the genomes uncoupled 4 (OsGUN4) promoter, has reduced chlorophyll content, altered tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, and deregulated transcription of photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes (PhANGs) compared to its wild-type progenitor Longtefu B (LTB). In the present study, we identified a suppressor mutant (CYB) of HYB and characterized its genetic, molecular, and physiological basis of the mutant phenotype. We found that the light-green phenotype of CYB was caused by a suppressor mutation in an unknown gene other than OsGUN4. Compared to HYB, the CHG methylation in the OsGUN4 promoter was reduced, while OsGUN4 transcript and protein abundance levels were increased in CYB. The contents of total chlorophyll and its intermediate metabolites (except protoporphyrin IX) in CYB plants were intermediate between HYB and LTB. The expression levels of 30 genes involved in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in CYB were all partially reverted to those of LTB, so were the PhANGs. In summary, a suppressor mutation caused the reversion of the xantha trait via reducing CHG methylation in OsGUN4 promoter.
