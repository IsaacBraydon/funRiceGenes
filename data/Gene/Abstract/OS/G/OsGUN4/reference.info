Oryza sativa GUN4 together with the magnesium chelatase subunits ChlI, ChlD, and ChlH have been heterologously expressed and purified to reconstitute magnesium chelatase activity in vitro. Maximum magnesium chelatase activity requires pre-activation of OsChlH with OsGUN4, Mg(2+) and protoporphyrin-IX. OsGUN4 and OsChlH preincubated without protoporphyrin-IX yields magnesium chelatase activity similar to assays without OsGUN4, suggesting formation of a dead-end complex. Either 9 or 10 C-terminal amino acids of OsGUN4 are slowly hydrolyzed to yield a truncated OsGUN4. These truncated OsGUN4 still bind protoporphyrin-IX and Mg-protoporphyrin-IX but are unable to activate OsChlH. This suggests the mechanism of GUN4 activation of magnesium chelatase is different in eukaryotes compared to cyanobacteria as the orthologous cyanobacterial GUN4 proteins lack this C-terminal extension.
