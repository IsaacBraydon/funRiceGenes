OsGRF6	OsGRF8	miR396-OsGRFs Module Balances Growth and Rice Blast Disease-Resistance.	 Moreover, transgenic plants overexpressing OsGRF6, OsGRF7, OsGRF8, and OsGRF9 exhibited enhanced resistance to M
OsGRF6	OsGRF8	miR396-OsGRFs Module Balances Growth and Rice Blast Disease-Resistance.	 While overexpression of OsGRF7 led to defects in growth, overexpression of OsGRF6, OsGRF8, and OsGRF9 resulted in better or no significant change of yield traits
OsGRF7	OsGRF8	miR396-OsGRFs Module Balances Growth and Rice Blast Disease-Resistance.	 Moreover, transgenic plants overexpressing OsGRF6, OsGRF7, OsGRF8, and OsGRF9 exhibited enhanced resistance to M
OsGRF7	OsGRF8	miR396-OsGRFs Module Balances Growth and Rice Blast Disease-Resistance.	 While overexpression of OsGRF7 led to defects in growth, overexpression of OsGRF6, OsGRF8, and OsGRF9 resulted in better or no significant change of yield traits
OsF3H03g	OsGRF8	The OsmiR396-OsGRF8-OsF3H-flavonoid pathway mediates resistance to the brown planthopper in rice (Oryza sativa).	 A BPH-responsive flavanone 3-hydroxylase (OsF3H) gene in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway was proved to be directly regulated by OsGRF8
OsGRF8	OsmiR396	OsmiR396/Growth Regulating Factor modulate rice grain size through direct regulation of embryo-specific miR408	 The grain shape of Growth Regulating Factor8 (OsGRF8)-overexpressing transgenic plants was most similar to that of MIM396 plants, suggesting OsGRF8 is a major mediator of OsmiR396 in grain size regulation
miR408|OsMIR408|OsmiR408	OsGRF8	OsmiR396/Growth Regulating Factor modulate rice grain size through direct regulation of embryo-specific miR408	 Moreover, we revealed the direct regulatory effects of OsGRF8 on OsMIR408 expression
OsGRF7	OsGRF8	Spatial control of cell division by GA-OsGRF7/8 module in a leaf explaining the leaf length variation between cultivated and wild rice.	 Downstream to GA, OsGRF7 and OsGRF8 function for controlling cell division to determine the rice leaf length
OsGRF7	OsGRF8	Spatial control of cell division by GA-OsGRF7/8 module in a leaf explaining the leaf length variation between cultivated and wild rice.	 Spatial control of cell division to determine the division zone size mediated by GA and downstream OsGRF7 and OsGRF8 explains the leaf length differences between the cultivated and wild rice
