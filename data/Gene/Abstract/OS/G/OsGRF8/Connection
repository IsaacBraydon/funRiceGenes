OsGRF6	OsGRF8	miR396-OsGRFs Module Balances Growth and Rice Blast Disease-Resistance.	 Moreover, transgenic plants overexpressing OsGRF6, OsGRF7, OsGRF8, and OsGRF9 exhibited enhanced resistance to M
OsGRF6	OsGRF8	miR396-OsGRFs Module Balances Growth and Rice Blast Disease-Resistance.	 While overexpression of OsGRF7 led to defects in growth, overexpression of OsGRF6, OsGRF8, and OsGRF9 resulted in better or no significant change of yield traits
