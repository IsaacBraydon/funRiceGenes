NA	miR396-OsGRFs Module Balances Growth and Rice Blast Disease-Resistance.	2019	Front Plant Sci	Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.	Fitness cost is a common phenomenon in rice blast disease-resistance breeding. MiR396 is a highly conserved microRNA (miRNA) family targeting Growth Regulating Factor (OsGRF) genes. Mutation at the target site of miR396 in certain OsGRF gene or blocking miR396 expression leads to increased grain yield. Here we demonstrated that fitness cost can be trade-off in miR396-OsGRFs module via balancing growth and immunity against the blast fungus. The accumulation of miR396 isoforms was significantly increased in a susceptible accession, but fluctuated in a resistant accession upon infection of Magnaporthe oryzae. The transgenic lines over-expressing different miR396 isoforms were highly susceptible to M. oryzae. In contrast, overexpressing target mimicry of miR396 to block its function led to enhanced resistance to M. oryzae in addition to improved yield traits. Moreover, transgenic plants overexpressing OsGRF6, OsGRF7, OsGRF8, and OsGRF9 exhibited enhanced resistance to M. oryzae, but showed different alteration of growth. While overexpression of OsGRF7 led to defects in growth, overexpression of OsGRF6, OsGRF8, and OsGRF9 resulted in better or no significant change of yield traits. Collectively, our results indicate that miR396 negatively regulates rice blast disease- resistance via suppressing multiple OsGRFs, which in turn differentially control growth and yield. Therefore, miR396-OsGRFs could be a potential module to demolish fitness cost in rice blast disease-resistance breeding.
NA	The OsmiR396-OsGRF8-OsF3H-flavonoid pathway mediates resistance to the brown planthopper in rice (Oryza sativa).	2019	Plant Biotechnol J	Key Laboratory of Insect Developmental and Evolutionary Biology, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200032, China.	Multi-functional microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key modulators of plant-pathogen interactions. Although the involvement of some miRNAs in plant-insect interactions has been revealed, the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. The brown planthopper (BPH) is the most notorious rice (Oryza sativa)-specific insect that causes severe yield losses each year and requires urgent biological control. To reveal the miRNAs involved in rice-BPH interactions, we performed miRNA sequencing and identified BPH-responsive OsmiR396. Sequestering OsmiR396 by overexpressing target mimicry (MIM396) in three genetic backgrounds indicated that OsmiR396 negatively regulated BPH resistance. Over-expression of one BPH-responsive target gene of OsmiR396, growth regulating factor 8 (OsGRF8), showed resistance to BPH. Furthermore, the flavonoid contents increased in both the OsmiR396-sequestered and the OsGRF8 over-expressing plants. By analyzing 39 natural rice varieties, the elevated flavonoid contents were found to correlate with enhanced BPH resistance. Artificial applications of flavonoids to wild type (WT) plants also increased resistance to BPH. A BPH-responsive flavanone 3-hydroxylase (OsF3H) gene in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway was proved to be directly regulated by OsGRF8. A genetic functional analysis of OsF3H revealed its positive role in mediating both the flavonoid contents and BPH resistance. And analysis of the genetic correlation between OsmiR396 and OsF3H showed that down-regulation of OsF3H complemented the BPH resistance characteristic and simultaneously decreased the flavonoid contents of the MIM396 plants. Thus, we revealed a new BPH resistance mechanism mediated by the OsmiR396-OsGRF8-OsF3H-flavonoid pathway. Our study suggests potential applications of miRNAs in BPH resistance breeding.

NA	Spatial control of cell division by GA-OsGRF7/8 module in a leaf explaining the leaf length variation between cultivated and wild rice.	2022	New Phytol	National Institute of Plant Genome Research, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, 110067, India.	Cellular and genetic understanding of the rice leaf size regulation is limited, despite rice being the staple food of more than half of the global population. We investigated the mechanism controlling the rice leaf length using cultivated and wild rice accessions that remarkably differed for leaf size. Comparative transcriptomics, gibberellic acid (GA) quantification and leaf kinematics of the contrasting accessions suggested the involvement of GA, cell cycle and growth-regulating factors (GRFs) in the rice leaf size regulation. Zone-specific expression analysis and VIGS established the functions of specific GRFs in the process. The leaf length of the selected accessions was strongly correlated with GA levels. Higher GA content in wild rice accessions with longer leaves and GA-induced increase in the leaf length via an increase in cell division confirmed a GA-mediated regulation of division zone in rice. Downstream to GA, OsGRF7 and OsGRF8 function for controlling cell division to determine the rice leaf length. Spatial control of cell division to determine the division zone size mediated by GA and downstream OsGRF7 and OsGRF8 explains the leaf length differences between the cultivated and wild rice. This mechanism to control the rice leaf length might have contributed to optimizing leaf size during domestication.
