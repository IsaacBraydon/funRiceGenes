OsGLYII1|OsETHE1	root	Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium	Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium
OsGLYII1|OsETHE1	calcium	Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium	Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium
OsGLYII1|OsETHE1	stress	Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium	Moreover, pOsETHE1 activity was induced under various abiotic stresses such as heat, salinity and oxidative stress, suggesting a potential role of OsETHE1 in stress response.

OsGLYII1|OsETHE1	stress	Stress response of OsETHE1 is altered in response to light and dark conditions.	Stress response of OsETHE1 is altered in response to light and dark conditions.
OsGLYII1|OsETHE1	stress	Stress response of OsETHE1 is altered in response to light and dark conditions.	To this end, we show that the stress response of OsETHE1 is dependent on light and that darkness largely suppresses the stress response of this gene
