OsGLYII1|OsETHE1	calcium	Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium	Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium
OsGLYII1|OsETHE1	stress	Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium	Moreover, pOsETHE1 activity was induced under various abiotic stresses such as heat, salinity and oxidative stress, suggesting a potential role of OsETHE1 in stress response.
