NA	Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium.	2014	Physiol Plant	Plant Molecular Biology Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, New Delhi, India.	ETHYLMALONIC ENCEPHALOPATHY PROTEIN 1 (ETHE1) encodes sulfur dioxygenase (SDO) activity regulating sulfide levels in living organisms. It is an essential gene and mutations in ETHE1 leads to ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE) in humans and embryo lethality in Arabidopsis. At present, very little is known regarding the role of ETHE1 beyond the context of EE and almost nothing is known about factors affecting its regulation in plant systems. In this study, we have identified, cloned and characterized OsETHE1, a gene encoding ETHE1-like protein from Oryza sativa. ETHE1 proteins in general are most similar to glyoxalase II (GLYII) and hence OsETHE1 has been earlier annotated as OsGLYII1, a putative GLYII gene. Here we show that OsETHE1 lacks GLYII activity and is instead an ETHE1 homolog being localized in mitochondria like its human and Arabidopsis counterparts. We have isolated and analyzed 1618 bp OsETHE1 promoter (pOsETHE1) to examine the factors affecting OsETHE1 expression. For this, transcriptional promoter pOsETHE1: 5-bromo-5-chloro-3-indolyl-¦Â-D-glucuronide (GUS) fusion construct was made and stably transformed into rice. GUS expression pattern of transgenic pOsETHE1:GUS plants reveal a high root-specific expression of OsETHE1. The pOsETHE1 activity was stimulated by Ca(II) and required light for induction. Moreover, pOsETHE1 activity was induced under various abiotic stresses such as heat, salinity and oxidative stress, suggesting a potential role of OsETHE1 in stress response.
NA	Genome-wide analysis of rice and Arabidopsis identifies two glyoxalase genes that are highly expressed in abiotic stresses.	2011	Funct Integr Genomics	Plant Molecular Biology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, 110067, India.	Glyoxalase pathway, ubiquitously found in all organisms from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, consists of glyoxalase I (GLY I) and glyoxalase II (GLY II) enzymes, which detoxify a cytotoxic molecule, methylglyoxal (MG). Increase in MG has been correlated with various diseases in humans and different abiotic stresses in plants. We have previously shown that overproduction of GLY I and/or GLY II enzymes in transgenic plants provide tolerance towards salinity and heavy metal stresses. We have identified nineteen potential GLY I and four GLY II proteins in rice and twenty two GLY I and nine GLY II proteins in Arabidopsis. An analysis of complete set of genes coding for the glyoxalase proteins in these two genomes is presented, including classification and chromosomal distribution. Expression profiling of these genes has been performed in response to multiple abiotic stresses, in different tissues and during various stages of vegetative and reproductive development using publicly available databases (massively parallel signature sequencing and microarray). AtGLYI8, OsGLYI3, and OsGLYI10 expresses constitutively high in seeds while AtGLYI4, AtGLYI7, OsGLYI6, and OsGLYI11 are highly stress inducible. To complement this analyses, qRT-PCR is performed in two contrasting rice genotypes, i.e., IR64 and Pokkali where OsGLYI6 and OsGLYI11 are found to be highly stress inducible.
NA	Stress response of OsETHE1 is altered in response to light and dark conditions.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	a Plant Molecular Biology Group, International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology; Aruna Asaf Ali Marg ; New Delhi , India.	ETHYLMALONIC ENCEPHALOPATHY PROTEIN1 (ETHE1), encoding sulfur dioxygenase activity is believed to be an important candidate in sulfur metabolism, where it is involved in amino acid catabolism during carbohydrate starvation and embryo development as seen in Arabidopsis thaliana. OsETHE1, an ETHE1-encoding gene from rice, is in fact induced in response to abiotic stresses, condition which affects nutritional status of the plant, reflecting the need for nutrient remobilization. Sulfur reduction and assimilation are believed to be light-dependent processes and so the genes involved in sulfur oxidation must also be investigated for light-dependent regulatory effects. To this end, we show that the stress response of OsETHE1 is dependent on light and that darkness largely suppresses the stress response of this gene. However, the observed regulatory effect is intricate, varying according to the stress imposed; thereby suggesting the involvement of various aspects of signaling in this process.
