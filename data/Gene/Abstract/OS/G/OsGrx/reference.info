Glutaredoxin (Grx) is a 12-kDa thioltransferase that reduces disulfide bonds of other proteins and maintains the redox potential of cells. In addition to its oxidoreductase activity, we report here that a rice Grx (OsGrx) can also function as a GSH-dependent peroxidase. Because of this antioxidant activity, OsGrx protects glutamine synthetase from oxidative damage. Individually replacing the conserved Cys residues in OsGrx with Ser shows that Cys(23), but not Cys(26), is essential for the thioltransferase and GSH-dependent peroxidase activities. Kinetic characterization of OsGrx reveals that the maximal catalytic efficiency (V(max)/K(m)) is obtained with cumene hydroperoxide rather than H(2)O(2) or t-butyl hydroperoxide.
