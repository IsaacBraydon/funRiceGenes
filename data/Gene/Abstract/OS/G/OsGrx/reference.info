1-s2.0-S0006291X02020478-main.pdf	GSH-dependent peroxidase activity of the rice (Oryza sativa) glutaredoxin, a thioltransferase	2002	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Division of Applied Life Sciences (BK21 program), Department of Biochemistry, PMBBRC, Gyeongsang National University, 660-701, Chinju, Republic of Korea.	Glutaredoxin (Grx) is a 12-kDa thioltransferase that reduces disulfide bonds of other proteins and maintains the redox potential of cells. In addition to its oxidoreductase activity, we report here that a rice Grx (OsGrx) can also function as a GSH-dependent peroxidase. Because of this antioxidant activity, OsGrx protects glutamine synthetase from oxidative damage. Individually replacing the conserved Cys residues in OsGrx with Ser shows that Cys(23), but not Cys(26), is essential for the thioltransferase and GSH-dependent peroxidase activities. Kinetic characterization of OsGrx reveals that the maximal catalytic efficiency (V(max)/K(m)) is obtained with cumene hydroperoxide rather than H(2)O(2) or t-butyl hydroperoxide.
NA	Overexpression of a CPYC-Type Glutaredoxin, OsGrxC2.2, Causes Abnormal Embryos and an Increased Grain Weight in Rice.	2019	Front Plant Sci	Agro-Biological Gene Research Center, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guangzhou, China.	Glutaredoxins (Grxs) are a ubiquitous group of oxidoreductase enzymes that are important in plant growth and development; however, the functions of rice Grxs have not been fully elucidated. In this paper, we showed that one of the Grxs, encoded by OsGrxC2.2, exhibited Grx activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that OsGrxC2.2 was able to regulate embryo development during embryogenesis. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsGrxC2.2 unexpectedly exhibited degenerate embryos as well as embryoless seeds. Our data indicated that the embryonic abnormalities occurred at an early stage during embryogenesis. We found that the expression of several endodermal layer marker genes for embryo development, such as OSH1 (apical region marker), OsSCR (L2 ground tissue marker), and OsPNH1 (L3 vascular tissue marker), were significantly decreased in the OsGrxC2.2-overexpressed transgenic rice lines. In contrast, the transcript levels of the majority of protodermal layer markers, including HAZ1, ROC2, ROC3, and RAmy1A, and the shoot apical meristem marker HB, showed little change between the wild-type (WT) and OsGrxC2.2-overexpressing embryos. Surprisingly, the seed weight of the overexpressed transgenic rice was remarkably increased in comparison to that of the WT. These results indicate that the overexpression of OsGrxC2.2 interferes with the normal embryogenesis of rice embryos and leads to increased grain weight. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that OsGrxC2.2 is a rice embryo development-associated gene.
