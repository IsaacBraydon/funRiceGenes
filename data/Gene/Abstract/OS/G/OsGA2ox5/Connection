OsGA2ox1	OsGA2ox5	Orchestration of ethylene and gibberellin signals determines primary root elongation in rice.	 Further investigations unraveled that ethylene signaling transcription factor ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE 1 OsEIL1 activates the expression of the GA metabolism genes GIBBERELLIN 2-OXIDASE 2 (OsGA2ox1), OsGA2ox2, OsGA2ox3, and OsGA2ox5, thereby deactivating GA activity, inhibiting cell proliferation in the root meristem, and ultimately gradually inhibiting primary root growth
