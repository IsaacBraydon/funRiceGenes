GAs are plant hormones that play fundamental roles in plant growth and development. GA2ox, GA3ox, and GA20ox are three key enzymes in GA biosynthesis. These enzymes belong to the 2OG-Fe (II) oxygenase superfamily and are independently encoded by different gene families. To date, genome-wide comparative analyses of GA oxidases in plant species have not been thoroughly carried out. In the present work, 61 GA oxidase family genes from rice (Oryza sativa), Arabidopsis, and soybean (Glycine max) were identified and a full study of these genes including phylogenetic tree construction, gene structure, gene family expansion and analysis of functional motifs was performed. Based on phylogeny, most of the GA oxidases were divided into four subgroups that reflected functional classifications. Intron/intron average length of GA oxidase genes in rice analysis revealed that GA oxidase genes in rice experienced substantial evolutionary divergence. Segmental duplication events were mainly found in soybean genome. However, in rice and Arabidopsis, no single expansion pattern exhibited dominance, indicating that GA oxidase genes from these species might have been subjected to a more complex evolutionary mechanism. In addition, special functional motifs were discovered in GA20ox, GA3ox, and GA2ox, which suggested that different functional motifs are associated with differences in protein function. Taken together our results suggest that GA oxidase family genes have undergone divergent evolutionary routes, especially at the monocot-dicot split, with dynamic evolution occurring in Arabidopsis thaliana and soybean.
journal.pone.0087110.pdf	OsGA2ox5, a gibberellin metabolism enzyme, is involved in plant growth, the root gravity response and salt stress	2014	PLoS One	Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.	Gibberellin (GA) 2-oxidases play an important role in the GA catabolic pathway through 2beta-hydroxylation. There are two classes of GA2oxs, i.e., a larger class of C(1)(9)-GA2oxs and a smaller class of C(2)(0)-GA2oxs. In this study, the gene encoding a GA 2-oxidase of rice, Oryza sativa GA 2-oxidase 5 (OsGA2ox5), was cloned and characterized. BLASTP analysis showed that OsGA2ox5 belongs to the C(2)(0)-GA2oxs subfamily, a subfamily of GA2oxs acting on C(2)(0)-GAs (GA(1)(2), GA(5)(3)). Subcellular localization of OsGA2ox5-YFP in transiently transformed onion epidermal cells revealed the presence of this protein in both of the nucleus and cytoplasm. Real-time PCR analysis, along with GUS staining, revealed that OsGA2ox5 is expressed in the roots, culms, leaves, sheaths and panicles of rice. Rice plants overexpressing OsGA2ox5 exhibited dominant dwarf and GA-deficient phenotypes, with shorter stems and later development of reproductive organs than the wild type. The dwarfism phenotype was partially rescued by the application of exogenous GA3 at a concentration of 10 microM. Ectopic expression of OsGA2ox5 cDNA in Arabidopsis resulted in a similar phenotype. Real-time PCR assays revealed that both GA synthesis-related genes and GA signaling genes were expressed at higher levels in transgenic rice plants than in wild-type rice; OsGA3ox1, which encodes a key enzyme in the last step of the bioactive GAs synthesis pathway, was highly expressed in transgenic rice. The roots of OsGA2ox5-ox plants exhibited increased starch granule accumulation and gravity responses, revealing a role for GA in root starch granule development and gravity responses. Furthermore, rice and Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsGA2ox5 were more resistant to high-salinity stress than wild-type plants. These results suggest that OsGA2ox5 plays important roles in GAs homeostasis, development, gravity responses and stress tolerance in rice.
NA	Orchestration of ethylene and gibberellin signals determines primary root elongation in rice.	2022	Plant Cell	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Primary root growth in cereal crops is fundamental for early establishment of the seedling and grain yield. In young rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings, the primary root grows rapidly for 7-10 days after germination and then stops; however, the underlying mechanism determining primary root growth is unclear. Here, we report that the interplay of ethylene and gibberellin (GA) controls the orchestrated development of the primary root in young rice seedlings. Our analyses advance the knowledge that primary root growth is maintained by higher ethylene production, which lowers bioactive GA contents. Further investigations unraveled that ethylene signaling transcription factor ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE 1 OsEIL1 activates the expression of the GA metabolism genes GIBBERELLIN 2-OXIDASE 2 (OsGA2ox1), OsGA2ox2, OsGA2ox3, and OsGA2ox5, thereby deactivating GA activity, inhibiting cell proliferation in the root meristem, and ultimately gradually inhibiting primary root growth. Mutation in OsGA2ox3 weakened ethylene-induced GA inactivation and reduced the ethylene sensitivity of the root. Genetic analysis revealed that OsGA2ox3 functions downstream of OsEIL1. Taken together, we identify a molecular pathway impacted by ethylene during primary root elongation in rice, and provide insight into the coordination of ethylene and GA signals during root development and seedling establishment.
