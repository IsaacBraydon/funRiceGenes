OsGRF1|rhd1	heading date	Down-regulation of OsGRF1 gene in rice rhd1 mutant results in reduced heading date	Down-regulation of OsGRF1 gene in rice rhd1 mutant results in reduced heading date
OsGRF1|rhd1	growth	Down-regulation of OsGRF1 gene in rice rhd1 mutant results in reduced heading date	RNA interference results revealed that transgenic lines with reduced OsGRF1 transcript displayed delayed growth and development, developed small leaves, and had delayed heading
OsGRF1|rhd1	growth	Down-regulation of OsGRF1 gene in rice rhd1 mutant results in reduced heading date	Our results clearly demonstrate that the OsGRF1 gene is not only involved in regulating growth at the juvenile stage, but that it may also be involved in the regulation of heading in rice
OsGRF1|rhd1	heading date	Down-regulation of OsGRF1 gene in rice rhd1 mutant results in reduced heading date	A rice mutant with reduced heading date (designated rhd1) found in a transgenic line of cultivar Teqing 2 (Oryza sativa L
OsGRF1|rhd1	heading date	Down-regulation of OsGRF1 gene in rice rhd1 mutant results in reduced heading date	Down-regulation of OsGRF1 gene in rice rhd1 mutant results in reduced heading date
OsGRF1|rhd1	transcription factor	Down-regulation of OsGRF1 gene in rice rhd1 mutant results in reduced heading date	The OsGRF1 gene encodes a putative transcription factor, which contains two conserved regions: the QLQ (Gln, Leu, Gln) and WRC (Trp, Arg, Cys) domains
