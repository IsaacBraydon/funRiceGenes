Genetic analysis showed that rhd1 was a dominant mutation and did not result from T-DNA insertion. By using the differential display polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR) technique, differential gene expression between rhd1 and Teqing 2 was compared and a rhd1-down-regulated cDNA fragment was identified. Sequence analysis showed that this fragment shared 99% similarity to the OsGRF1 (O. sativa growth-regulating factor 1) gene. The OsGRF1 gene encodes a putative transcription factor, which contains two conserved regions: the QLQ (Gln, Leu, Gln) and WRC (Trp, Arg, Cys) domains. Southern analysis indicates that OsGRF1 may be encoded by single copy gene in the rice genome. RNA interference results revealed that transgenic lines with reduced OsGRF1 transcript displayed delayed growth and development, developed small leaves, and had delayed heading. The extent of the phenotypes developed was well-correlated with the OsGRF1 gene transcript. Our results clearly demonstrate that the OsGRF1 gene is not only involved in regulating growth at the juvenile stage, but that it may also be involved in the regulation of heading in rice.
Plant Physiol.-2000-van der Knaap-695-704.pdf	A novel gibberellin-induced gene from rice and its potential regulatory role in stem growth	2000	Plant Physiol	Michigan State University-Department of Energy Plant Research Laboratory, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824-1312, USA.	Os-GRF1 (Oryza sativa-GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR1) was identified in a search for genes that are differentially expressed in the intercalary meristem of deepwater rice (Oryza sativa L.) internodes in response to gibberellin (GA). Os-GRF1 displays general features of transcription factors, contains a functional nuclear localization signal, and has three regions with similarities to sequences in the database. One of these regions is similar to a protein interaction domain of SWI2/SNF2, which is a subunit of a chromatin-remodeling complex in yeast. The two other domains are novel and found only in plant proteins of unknown function. To study its role in plant growth, Os-GRF1 was expressed in Arabidopsis. Stem elongation of transformed plants was severely inhibited, and normal growth could not be recovered by the application of GA. Our results indicate that Os-GRF1 belongs to a novel class of plant proteins and may play a regulatory role in GA-induced stem elongation.
