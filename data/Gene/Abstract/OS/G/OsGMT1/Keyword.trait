OsGMT1	blast	Overexpression of a GIPC glycosyltransferase gene, OsGMT1, suppresses plant immunity and delays heading time in rice.	 In contrast, the OsGMT1 overexpression lines showed significant down-regulation of several defense-associated or cell wall synthesis-associated genes, and enhanced sensitivity to rice blast
OsGMT1	cell wall	Overexpression of a GIPC glycosyltransferase gene, OsGMT1, suppresses plant immunity and delays heading time in rice.	 In contrast, the OsGMT1 overexpression lines showed significant down-regulation of several defense-associated or cell wall synthesis-associated genes, and enhanced sensitivity to rice blast
OsGMT1	cell wall synthesis	Overexpression of a GIPC glycosyltransferase gene, OsGMT1, suppresses plant immunity and delays heading time in rice.	 In contrast, the OsGMT1 overexpression lines showed significant down-regulation of several defense-associated or cell wall synthesis-associated genes, and enhanced sensitivity to rice blast
OsGMT1	plant immunity	Overexpression of a GIPC glycosyltransferase gene, OsGMT1, suppresses plant immunity and delays heading time in rice	Overexpression of a GIPC glycosyltransferase gene, OsGMT1, suppresses plant immunity and delays heading time in rice
