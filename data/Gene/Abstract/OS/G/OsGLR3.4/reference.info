NA	GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-like gene OsGLR3.4 is required for plant growth and systemic wound signaling in rice (Oryza sativa).	2021	New Phytol	Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology of Ministry of Education, Bioengineering College of Chongqing University, 174 Shazheng Street, Chongqing, China.	Recent studies have revealed the physiological roles ofâ€‰glutamateâ€‰receptor-likeâ€‰channelsâ€<U+383C><U+3E39>(GLRs) in Arabidopsis; however, the functions of GLRs in rice remain largely unknown. Here, we show that knockout of OsGLR3.4 in rice leads to brassinosteroid (BR)-regulated growth defects and reduced BR sensitivity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transient transactivation assays indicated that OsGLR3.4 is the downstream target of OsBZR1. Further, agonist profile assays showed that multiple amino acids can trigger transient Ca(2+) influx in an OsGLR3.4-dependent manner, indicating that OsGLR3.4 is a Ca(2+) -permeable channel. Meanwhile, the study of internode cells demonstrated that OsGLR3.4-mediated Ca(2+) fluxâ€‰is required for actin filament organization and vesicle trafficking. Following root injury, the triggering of both slow wave potentials (SWPs) in leaves and the jasmonic acid (JA) response are impaired in osglr3.4 mutants, indicating that OsGLR3.4 is required for root-to-shoot systemic wound signaling in rice. Brassinosteroid treatment enhanced SWPs and OsJAZ8 expression in root-wounded plants, suggesting that BR signaling synergistically regulates the OsGLR3.4-mediated systemic wound response. In summary, this article describes a mechanism of OsGLR3.4-mediated cell elongation and long-distance systemic wound signaling in plants and provides new insights into the contribution of GLRs to plant growth and responses to mechanical wounding.
