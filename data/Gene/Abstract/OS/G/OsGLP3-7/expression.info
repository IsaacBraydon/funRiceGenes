OsGLP3-7	 Expression of OsGLP3-7 was significantly induced by pathogen infection, jasmonic acid (JA) treatment, and hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ) treatment |  Overexpression of OsGLP3-7 increased plant resistance to leaf blast, panicle blast, and bacterial blight, whereas disease resistance in OsGLP3-7 RNAi silenced plants was remarkably compromised, suggesting this gene is a positive regulator of disease resistance in rice |  Many genes involved in JA and phytoalexin biosynthesis were strongly induced, accompanied with elevated levels of JA and phytoalexins in OsGLP3-7-overexpressing plants, while expression of these genes was significantly suppressed and the levels of JA and phytoalexins were reduced in OsGLP3-7 RNAi plants compared with control plants, both before and after pathogen inoculation	 Overexpression of OsGLP3-7 increased plant resistance to leaf blast, panicle blast, and bacterial blight, whereas disease resistance in OsGLP3-7 RNAi silenced plants was remarkably compromised, suggesting this gene is a positive regulator of disease resistance in rice	 Overexpression of OsGLP3-7 increased plant resistance to leaf blast, panicle blast, and bacterial blight, whereas disease resistance in OsGLP3-7 RNAi silenced plants was remarkably compromised, suggesting this gene is a positive regulator of disease resistance in rice |  Many genes involved in JA and phytoalexin biosynthesis were strongly induced, accompanied with elevated levels of JA and phytoalexins in OsGLP3-7-overexpressing plants, while expression of these genes was significantly suppressed and the levels of JA and phytoalexins were reduced in OsGLP3-7 RNAi plants compared with control plants, both before and after pathogen inoculation
