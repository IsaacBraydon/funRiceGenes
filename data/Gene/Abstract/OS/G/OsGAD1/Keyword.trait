OsGAD1	root	Rice (Oryza sativa) contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus	 RNA analysis showed that transcripts of OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 were present in all tissues examined, but their expression was differentially regulated, at least in roots and maturing seeds
OsGAD1	seed	Rice (Oryza sativa) contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus	 RNA analysis showed that transcripts of OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 were present in all tissues examined, but their expression was differentially regulated, at least in roots and maturing seeds
OsGAD1	shoot	Rice (Oryza sativa) contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus	We have isolated full-length cDNAs for two distinct isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), designated OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 from a rice shoot cDNA library
