Cytosolic Oryza sativa glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (OsGAPDH), the enzyme involved in the ubiquitous glycolysis, catalyzes the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-biphosphoglycerate (BPG) using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as an electron acceptor. We report crystal structures of OsGAPDH in three conditions of NAD-free, NAD-bound and sulfate-soaked forms to discuss the molecular determinants for coenzyme specificity. The structure of OsGAPDH showed a homotetramer form with each monomer comprising three domains-NAD-binding, catalytic and S-loop domains. NAD binds to each OsGAPDH subunits with some residues forming positively charged grooves that attract sulfate anions, as a simulation of phosphate groups in the product BPG. Phe37 not only forms a bottleneck to improve NAD-binding but also combines with Pro193 and Asp35 as key conserved residues for NAD-specificity in OsGAPDH. The binding of NAD alters the side-chain conformation of Phe37 with a 90 degrees rotation related to the adenine moiety of NAD, concomitant with clamping the active site about 0.6 A from the "open" to "closed" form, producing an increased affinity specific for NAD. Phe37 exists only in higher organisms, whereas it is replaced by other residues (Thr or Leu) with smaller side chains in lower organisms, which makes a greater distance between Leu34 and NAD of E. coli GAPDH than that between Phe37 and NAD of OsGAPDH. We demonstrated that Phe37 plays a crucial role in stabilizing NAD binding or intermediating of apo-holo transition, resulting in a greater NAD-dependent catalytic efficiency using site-directed mutagenesis. Phe37 might be introduced by evolution generating a catalytic advantage in cytosolic GAPDH.

One of the clones, OsGAPDH, represented a gene that was expressed at high level during 12-h submergence. A homology search of GenBank databases showed that OsGAPDH had significant sequence homology with maize non-reversible glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate dehydrogenase. The OsGAPDH sequence consists of 1,772 bp with the longest open reading frame encoding 499 amino acids with a calculated relative mass of 54.2 kDa. Genomic Southern analysis indicated that one or two copies of the OsGAPDH gene occur in the Yukihikari genome. The chromosomal location of the OsGAPDH gene was identified by RFLP analysis indicating that OsGAPDH was located on chromosome 8. Tissue-specific expression of OsGAPDH indicated that the high level of mRNA was detected in the panicle. Plants exposed to drought, submergence and ABA treatment showed an increased accumulation of OsGAPDH transcripts. The induction of Escherichia coli cells containing the pGST-OsGAPDH plasmid resulted in the accumulation of a large amount of the 83.2-kDa recombinant protein. The purified GAPDH enzyme showed an optimum activity at pH 8.5 and 50 degrees C, and was strongly inhibited by ATP and ADP.
NA	Effect of Rice GDP-L-Galactose Phosphorylase Constitutive Overexpression on Ascorbate Concentration, Stress Tolerance, and Iron Bioavailability in Rice	2020	Front Plant Sci	School of Biosciences, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.	Ascorbate (vitamin C) is an essential multifunctional molecule for both plants and mammals. In plants, ascorbate is the most abundant water-soluble antioxidant that supports stress tolerance. In humans, ascorbate is an essential micronutrient and promotes iron (Fe) absorption in the gut. Engineering crops with increased ascorbate levels have the potential to improve both crop stress tolerance and human health. Here, rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants were engineered to constitutively overexpress the rice GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase coding sequence (35S-OsGGP), which encodes the rate-limiting enzymatic step of the L-galactose pathway. Ascorbate concentrations were negligible in both null segregant (NS) and 35S-OsGGP brown rice (BR, unpolished grain), but significantly increased in 35S-OsGGP germinated brown rice (GBR) relative to NS. Foliar ascorbate concentrations were significantly increased in 35S-OsGGP plants in the vegetative growth phase relative to NS, but significantly reduced at the reproductive growth phase and were associated with reduced OsGGP transcript levels. The 35S-OsGGP plants did not display altered salt tolerance at the vegetative growth phase despite having elevated ascorbate concentrations. Ascorbate concentrations were positively correlated with ferritin concentrations in Caco-2 cells - an accurate predictor of Fe bioavailability in human digestion - exposed to in vitro digests of NS and 35S-OsGGP BR and GBR samples.
