OsGAPDH	 ABA 	Molecular cloning, characterization, expression and chromosomal location of OsGAPDH, a submergence responsive gene in rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	Plants exposed to drought, submergence and ABA treatment showed an increased accumulation of OsGAPDH transcripts
OsGAPDH	panicle	Molecular cloning, characterization, expression and chromosomal location of OsGAPDH, a submergence responsive gene in rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	Tissue-specific expression of OsGAPDH indicated that the high level of mRNA was detected in the panicle
OsGAPDH	drought	Molecular cloning, characterization, expression and chromosomal location of OsGAPDH, a submergence responsive gene in rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	Plants exposed to drought, submergence and ABA treatment showed an increased accumulation of OsGAPDH transcripts
OsGAPDH	phosphate	Crystal structures of rice (Oryza sativa) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase complexes with NAD and sulfate suggest involvement of Phe37 in NAD binding for catalysis	Cytosolic Oryza sativa glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (OsGAPDH), the enzyme involved in the ubiquitous glycolysis, catalyzes the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-biphosphoglycerate (BPG) using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as an electron acceptor
OsGAPDH	phosphate	Crystal structures of rice (Oryza sativa) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase complexes with NAD and sulfate suggest involvement of Phe37 in NAD binding for catalysis	NAD binds to each OsGAPDH subunits with some residues forming positively charged grooves that attract sulfate anions, as a simulation of phosphate groups in the product BPG
