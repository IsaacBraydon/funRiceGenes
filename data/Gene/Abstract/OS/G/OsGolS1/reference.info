NA	Abiotic stress regulates expression of galactinol synthase genes post-transcriptionally through intron retention in rice.	2018	Planta	Division of Plant Biology, Bose Institute (Centenary Campus), Kolkata, West Bengal, 700054, India.	Expression of the Galactinol synthase genes in rice is regulated through post-transcriptional intron retention in response to abiotic stress and may be linked to Raffinose Family Oligosaccharide synthesis in osmotic perturbation. Galactinol synthase (GolS) is the first committed enzyme in raffinose family oligosaccharide (RFO) synthesis pathway and synthesizes galactinol from UDP-galactose and inositol. Expression of GolS genes has long been implicated in abiotic stress, especially drought and salinity. A non-canonical regulation mechanism controlling the splicing and maturation of rice GolS genes was identified in rice photosynthetic tissue. We found that the two isoforms of Oryza sativa GolS (OsGolS) gene, located in chromosomes 3(OsGolS1) and 7(OsGolS2) are interspersed by conserved introns harboring characteristic premature termination codons (PTC). During abiotic stress, the premature and mature transcripts of both isoforms were found to accumulate in a rhythmic manner for very small time-windows interrupted by phases of complete absence. Reporter gene assay using GolS promoters under abiotic stress does not reflect this accumulation profile, suggesting that this regulation occurs post-transcriptionally. We suggest that this may be due to a surveillance mechanism triggering the degradation of the premature transcript preventing its accumulation in the cell. The suggested mechanism fits the paradigm of PTC-induced Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD). In support of our hypothesis, when we pharmacologically blocked NMD, the full-length pre-mRNAs were increasingly accumulated in cell. To this end, our work suggests that a combined transcriptional and post transcriptional control exists in rice to regulate GolS expression under stress. Concurrent detection and processing of prematurely terminating transcripts coupled to repressed splicing can be described as a form of Regulated Unproductive Splicing and Translation (RUST) and may be linked to the stress adaptation of the plant, which is an interesting future research possibility.
NA	Magnaporthe oryzae systemic defense trigger 1 (MoSDT1)-mediated metabolites regulate defense response in Rice	2021	BMC Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China.	Background: Some of the pathogenic effector proteins play an active role in stimulating the plant defense system to strengthen plant resistance.  Results: In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS) was implemented to identify altered metabolites in transgenic rice containing over-expressed M. oryzae Systemic Defense Trigger 1 (MoSDT1) that was infected at three-time points. The characterized dominating metabolites were organic acids and their derivatives, organic oxygen compounds, lipids, and lipid-like molecules. Among the identified metabolites, shikimate, galactinol, trehalose, D-mannose, linolenic acid, dopamine, tyramine, and L-glutamine are precursors for the synthesis of many secondary defense metabolites Carbohydrate, as well as amino acid metabolic, pathways were revealed to be involved in plant defense responses and resistance strengthening.  Conclusion: The increasing salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) content enhanced interactions between JA synthesis/signaling gene, SA synthesis/receptor gene, raffinose/fructose/sucrose synthase gene, and cell wall-related genes all contribute to defense response in rice. The symptoms of rice after M. oryzae infection were significantly alleviated when treated with six identified metabolites, i.e., galactol, tyramine, L-glutamine, L-tryptophan, ¦Á-terpinene, and dopamine for 72 h exogenously. Therefore, these metabolites could be utilized as an optimal metabolic marker for M. oryzae defense.
