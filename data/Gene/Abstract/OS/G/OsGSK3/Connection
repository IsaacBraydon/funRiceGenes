GL3.1|qGL3-1|qGL3|OsPPKL1	OsGSK3	Rice qGL3/OsPPKL1 Functions with the GSK3/SHAGGY-Like Kinase OsGSK3 to Modulate Brassinosteroid Signaling.	 Unlike the dephosphorylation of BIN2 (which leads to protein degradation) in Arabidopsis, qGL3 dephosphorylates and stabilizes OsGSK3 in rice
GL3.1|qGL3-1|qGL3|OsPPKL1	OsGSK3	Rice qGL3/OsPPKL1 Functions with the GSK3/SHAGGY-Like Kinase OsGSK3 to Modulate Brassinosteroid Signaling.	 These results demonstrate that qGL3 suppresses BR signaling by regulating the phosphorylation and stability of OsGSK3, which modulates OsBZR1 phosphorylation and subcellular distribution
OsBZR1|BZR1	OsGSK3	Rice qGL3/OsPPKL1 Functions with the GSK3/SHAGGY-Like Kinase OsGSK3 to Modulate Brassinosteroid Signaling.	 Knocking-out of OsGSK3 enhances BR signaling and induces nuclear localization of Oryza sativa BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1 (OsBZR1)
OsBZR1|BZR1	OsGSK3	Rice qGL3/OsPPKL1 Functions with the GSK3/SHAGGY-Like Kinase OsGSK3 to Modulate Brassinosteroid Signaling.	 These results demonstrate that qGL3 suppresses BR signaling by regulating the phosphorylation and stability of OsGSK3, which modulates OsBZR1 phosphorylation and subcellular distribution
OsBSK3	OsGSK3	OsBSK3 Positively Regulates Grain Length and Weight by Inhibiting the Phosphatase Activity of OsPPKL1.	 Furthermore, OsBSK3 could physically interact with OsPPKL1 and OsGSK3, the downstream components in BR signaling, as a scaffold protein, and inhibit the phosphatase activity of OsPPKL1 on the dephosphorylation of OsGSK3
OsGSK3	SERK2|OsSERK2|OsBAK2	OsBAK2/OsSERK2 Expression is Repressed by OsBZR1 to Modulate Brassinosteroid Response and Grain Length in Rice.	 Additionally, the phosphorylation of OsBZR1 by OsGSK3 reduced its binding activity to OsBAK2 promoter
OsGSK3	OsUBC45	An ERAD-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme boosts broad-spectrum disease resistance and yield in rice.	 Further, OsUBC45 enhances the degradation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 OsGSK3 and aquaporin OsPIP2;1, which negatively regulate the grain size and PTI, respectively
