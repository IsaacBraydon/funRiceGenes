OsGT1	mitosis	Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation	 Microscopic analyses revealed that osgt1 pollen developed normally to the pollen mitosis stage but failed to produce mature grains
OsGT1	grain	Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation	 Microscopic analyses revealed that osgt1 pollen developed normally to the pollen mitosis stage but failed to produce mature grains
OsGT1	pollen	Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation	 We examined the role of GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE1 (OsGT1) in pollen wall development in rice (Oryza sativa)
OsGT1	pollen	Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation	 Microscopic analyses revealed that osgt1 pollen developed normally to the pollen mitosis stage but failed to produce mature grains
OsGT1	pollen	Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation	 In osgt1 pollen, intine structure was disrupted
OsGT1	pollen	Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation	 Taken together, our results suggest that OsGT1 is a Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase essential for intine construction and pollen maturation, providing new insight into male reproductive development
OsGT1	reproductive	Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation	 Taken together, our results suggest that OsGT1 is a Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase essential for intine construction and pollen maturation, providing new insight into male reproductive development
