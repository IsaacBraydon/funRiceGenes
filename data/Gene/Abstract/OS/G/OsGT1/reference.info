Plant Physiol.-2013-Moon-663-75.pdf	Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation	2013	Plant Physiol	Crop Biotech Institute and Department of Plant Molecular Systems Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 446-701, Korea.	The pollen wall consists of an exine and an intine. The mechanism underlying its formation is not well understood. Glycosyltransferases catalyze the modification of biological molecules by attaching a single or multiple sugars and play key roles in a wide range of biological processes. We examined the role of GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE1 (OsGT1) in pollen wall development in rice (Oryza sativa). This gene is highly expressed in mature pollen, and plants containing alleles caused by transfer DNA insertion do not produce homozygous progeny. Reciprocal crosses between OsGT1/osgt1 and the wild type indicated that the mutation leads to a male gametophyte defect. Microscopic analyses revealed that osgt1 pollen developed normally to the pollen mitosis stage but failed to produce mature grains. In osgt1 pollen, intine structure was disrupted. In addition, starch and protein levels were much lower in the mutant grains. Recombinant OsGT1 transferred glucose from UDP-glucose to the third and seventh positions of quercetin, a universal substrate of glycosyltransferases. Consistent with the role of OsGT1, an OsGT1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein was localized to the Golgi apparatus. Taken together, our results suggest that OsGT1 is a Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase essential for intine construction and pollen maturation, providing new insight into male reproductive development.
NA	Biodegradation of butachlor in rice intensified by a regulator of OsGT1.	2022	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Pesticide Science, College of Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	The constant utilization of herbicide butachlor to prevent weeds in agronomic management is leading to its growing accumulation in environment and adverse impact on crop production and food security. Some technologies proposed for butachlor degradation in waters and farmland soils are available, but the catabolic mechanism in crops polluted with butachlor remains unknown. How plants cope with the ecotoxicity of butachlor is not only a fundamental scientific question but is also of critical importance for safe crop production and human health. This study developed a genetically improved rice genotype by overexpressing a novel glycosyltransferase gene named OsGT1 to accelerate removal of butachlor residues in rice crop and its growth environment. Both transcriptional expression and protein activates of OsGT1 are considerably induced under butachlor stress. The growth of the OsGT1 overexpression rice (OsOE) was significantly improved and butachlor-induced cellular damage was greatly attenuated compared to its wild-type (WT). The butachlor concentrations in shoots and roots of the hydroponically grown OsOE plants were reduced by 14.1-30.7 % and 37.8-47.7 %. In particular, the concentrations in the grain of OsOE lines were reduced to 54.6-85.6 % of those in wild-type. Using LC-Q-TOF-HRMS/MS, twenty-three butachlor derivatives including 16 metabolites and 7 conjugations with metabolic pathways were characterized, and it turns out that the OsOE lines accumulated more degradative products than wild-type, implying that more butachlor molecules were intensively catabolized. Taken together, the reduced residues of parent butachlor in rice and its growth media point out that OsGT1 plays a critical role in detoxifying and catabolizing the poisoning chemical in plants and its environment.
