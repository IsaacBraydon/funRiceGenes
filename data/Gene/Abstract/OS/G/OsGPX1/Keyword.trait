OsGPX1	salt tolerance	Mitochondrial GPX1 silencing triggers differential photosynthesis impairment in response to salinity in rice plants.	Transformed plants exhibited lower photorespiration, water use efficiency and root growth, indicating that GPX1 could be important to salt tolerance.
OsGPX1	photosynthesis	Mitochondrial GPX1 silencing triggers differential photosynthesis impairment in response to salinity in rice plants.	Growth reduction of GPX1s line might be related to photosynthesis impairment, which in turn could have involved a cross talk mechanism between mitochondria and chloroplast originated from redox changes due to GPX1 deficiency.
