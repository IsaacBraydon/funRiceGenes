OsGLN1	drought	Molecular cloning, characterization and in vitro expression of a novel endo-1,3-β-glucanase up-regulated by ABA and drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of OsGLN1 is up-regulated by drought stress and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment and the accumulation of OsGLN1 transcript is more in the roots of rice seedlings
OsGLN1	drought	Molecular cloning, characterization and in vitro expression of a novel endo-1,3-β-glucanase up-regulated by ABA and drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	These results clearly indicated that the endo-1,3-β-glucanase encoded by OsGLN1 plays an important role associated with plant defence against abiotic and biotic stresses particularly for drought and fungal pathogen in rice seedlings
OsGLN1	root	Molecular cloning, characterization and in vitro expression of a novel endo-1,3-β-glucanase up-regulated by ABA and drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of OsGLN1 is up-regulated by drought stress and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment and the accumulation of OsGLN1 transcript is more in the roots of rice seedlings
OsGLN1	biotic stress	Molecular cloning, characterization and in vitro expression of a novel endo-1,3-β-glucanase up-regulated by ABA and drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	These results clearly indicated that the endo-1,3-β-glucanase encoded by OsGLN1 plays an important role associated with plant defence against abiotic and biotic stresses particularly for drought and fungal pathogen in rice seedlings
OsGLN1	seedling	Molecular cloning, characterization and in vitro expression of a novel endo-1,3-β-glucanase up-regulated by ABA and drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of OsGLN1 is up-regulated by drought stress and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment and the accumulation of OsGLN1 transcript is more in the roots of rice seedlings
OsGLN1	seedling	Molecular cloning, characterization and in vitro expression of a novel endo-1,3-β-glucanase up-regulated by ABA and drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)

OsGLN1	cell wall	Molecular cloning, characterization and in vitro expression of a novel endo-1,3-β-glucanase up-regulated by ABA and drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	The GST-OsGLN1 recombinant protein rapidly hydrolyzed the cell wall β-glucans of rice fungal pathogen, Pyricularia oryzae, other than typical substrates for endo-1,3-β-glucanase
