10.1360-02yc0172.pdf	Structure, expression pattern and chromosomal localization of the rice Osgrp-2 gene	2003	Sci China C Life Sci	Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100080, Beijing, China.	Glycine-rich proteins (GRPs) belong to a kind of important structural proteins of plant cell walls. The expression of GRP genes is regulated spatially and developmentally as well as by various environmental stresses, thus providing a good model for the study of plant gene expression. We obtained the genomic sequence of a new GRP gene (Osgrp- 2) from a rice genomic library. The transcription start site of Osgrp- 2 was determined by 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and a 2.4-kb promoter sequence was thus delimited. The spatial and developmental expression pattern as well as the wound-inducible character of Osgrp- 2 in rice plants was analyzed in detail. Furthermore, the gene was mapped onto rice chromosome 10 by analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).
16126398.pdf	The promoter of a rice glycine-rich protein gene, Osgrp-2, confers vascular-specific expression in transgenic plants	2003	Planta	Laboratory of Plant Biotechnology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China.	The genomic sequence of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) glycine-rich protein (GRP) gene, designated Osgrp-2, has been previously determined (GenBank U40708). Primer extension analysis indicated that transcription starts 47 bp upstream of the translation start codon. To gain an insight into the transcriptional regulation of this gene, the 2,401-bp promoter sequence and a series of its 5' deletions were transcriptionally fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene. GUS activity was subsequently assayed in a transient expression system of tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum L.) protoplasts, which revealed the presence of a positive regulatory region (-2290 to -1406) and two negative regulatory regions (-2401 to -2291 and -1405 to -1022) in the Osgrp-2 promoter for the promoter activity. The positive regulatory region displayed an enhancer-like activity when fused to the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S minimal promoter (-89 to +6) to drive GUS expression and assayed on tobacco leaves by the Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression technique (agroinfiltration). Histochemical staining for GUS activity on transgenic tobacco plants has further indicated a preferential expression in vascular tissues of stems and leaves conferred by the positive regulatory region. A 1,023-bp fragment of the Osgrp-2 promoter (-1021 to +2) fused with GUS was transformed into tobacco and proved to be capable of conferring vascular-specific expression. Further 5' and 3' deletion analysis of the 1,023-bp promoter revealed that a 99-bp fragment located from -497 to -399 contained cis-elements responsible for vascular-specific expression.
NA	Cell wall Glycine-rich Protein2 is involved in tapetal differentiation and pollen maturation	2020	J Plant Res	Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Tsukuba, 305-8572, Japan.	The tapetum plays important roles in anther development by providing materials for pollen-wall formation and nutrients for pollen development. Here, we report the characterization of a male-sterile mutant of glycine-rich protein 2 (OsGRP2), which exhibits irregular cell division and dysfunction of the tapetum. GRP is a cellwall structural protein present in the cell walls of diverse plant species, but its function is unclear in pollen development. We found that few GRP genes are expressed in rice and thus focused on one highly expressed gene, OsGRP2. The tapetal cell walls of an OsGRP2 mutant did not thicken at the pollen mothercell stage, as a result, pollen maturation and fertility rate decreased. High OsGRP2 expression was detected in male-floral organs, and OsGRP2 was distributed in the tapetum. OsGRP2 participated in establishment of the cellwall network during early tapetum development. In conclusion, our results indicate that OsGRP2 plays important roles in the differentiation and function of the tapetum.
