Osgr-rbp4|Osgrp1	temperature	Molecular characterization of a novel isoform of rice (Oryza sativa L.) glycine rich-RNA binding protein and evidence for its involvement in high temperature stress response	Osgr-rbp4 transcript in rice seedlings is constitutively expressed as well as regulated by different abiotic stresses including high temperature stress
Osgr-rbp4|Osgrp1	temperature	Molecular characterization of a novel isoform of rice (Oryza sativa L.) glycine rich-RNA binding protein and evidence for its involvement in high temperature stress response	Ectopic over-expression of Osgr-rbp4 cDNA imparts high temperature stress tolerance to wild type yeast cells
Osgr-rbp4|Osgrp1	cell elongation	Expression of the rice Osgrp1 promoter-Gus reporter gene is specifically associated with cell elongation/expansion and differentiation	Thus, the expression of the Osgrp1 gene is closely associated with cell elongation/expansion during the post-mitotic cell differentiation process
Osgr-rbp4|Osgrp1	cell elongation	Expression of the rice Osgrp1 promoter-Gus reporter gene is specifically associated with cell elongation/expansion and differentiation	Expression of the rice Osgrp1 promoter-Gus reporter gene is specifically associated with cell elongation/expansion and differentiation
Osgr-rbp4|Osgrp1	root	Expression of the rice Osgrp1 promoter-Gus reporter gene is specifically associated with cell elongation/expansion and differentiation	The Osgrp1-Gus gene was also expressed in response to wounding and down-regulated by water-stress conditions in the elongation region of roots
Osgr-rbp4|Osgrp1	leaf	Molecular characterization of a novel isoform of rice (Oryza sativa L.) glycine rich-RNA binding protein and evidence for its involvement in high temperature stress response	It is shown that OsGR-RBP4 in rice leaf cells and its immunologically homologous protein in tobacco BY2 protoplasts are nuclear proteins
Osgr-rbp4|Osgrp1	cell wall	Expression of the rice Osgrp1 promoter-Gus reporter gene is specifically associated with cell elongation/expansion and differentiation	To study the expression and regulation of a rice glycine-rich cell wall protein gene, Osgrp1, transgenic rice plants were regenerated that contain the Osgrp1 promoter or its 5' deletions fused with the bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene
Osgr-rbp4|Osgrp1	seedling	Molecular characterization of a novel isoform of rice (Oryza sativa L.) glycine rich-RNA binding protein and evidence for its involvement in high temperature stress response	Osgr-rbp4 transcript in rice seedlings is constitutively expressed as well as regulated by different abiotic stresses including high temperature stress
Osgr-rbp4|Osgrp1	abiotic stress	Molecular characterization of a novel isoform of rice (Oryza sativa L.) glycine rich-RNA binding protein and evidence for its involvement in high temperature stress response	Osgr-rbp4 transcript in rice seedlings is constitutively expressed as well as regulated by different abiotic stresses including high temperature stress
