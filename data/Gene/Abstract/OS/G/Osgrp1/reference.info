1-s2.0-S016894520700132X-main.pdf	Molecular characterization of a novel isoform of rice (Oryza sativa L.) glycine rich-RNA binding protein and evidence for its involvement in high temperature stress response	2007	Plant Science	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, Benito Juarez Road, Dhaula Kuan, New Delhi 110021, India	A novel full-length cDNA encoding for glycine rich (GR)-RNA binding protein (RBP) (Osgr-rbp4) is isolated from rice heat shock cDNA library. Amino acid sequence of the deduced protein reveals existence of RNA recognition motif (RRM) comprising of highly conserved RNA binding RNPI and RNPII domains at the N-terminus. C-terminus of this protein is rich in arginine and glycine residues. Blast search analysis on rice genome sequence database shows that GR-RBP protein family is constituted of multiple members with high level of amino acid conservation in RNA recognition motif and glycine domain regions. Similar analysis across wider biological systems from NCBI database indicated that rice GR-RBP4 has homologs in different living genera. Osgr-rbp4 transcript in rice seedlings is constitutively expressed as well as regulated by different abiotic stresses including high temperature stress. Ectopic over-expression of Osgr-rbp4 cDNA imparts high temperature stress tolerance to wild type yeast cells. It is shown that OsGR-RBP4 in rice leaf cells and its immunologically homologous protein in tobacco BY2 protoplasts are nuclear proteins. Upon heat shock, bulk of these proteins appears to be localized in the cytoplasm. We suggest that OsGR-RBP4 probably bind and stabilize the stress-inducible transcripts under HS conditions.
10.1007-BF00020394.pdf	Expression of the rice Osgrp1 promoter-Gus reporter gene is specifically associated with cell elongation/expansion and differentiation	1995	Plant Mol Biol	Field of Plant Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.	To study the expression and regulation of a rice glycine-rich cell wall protein gene, Osgrp1, transgenic rice plants were regenerated that contain the Osgrp1 promoter or its 5' deletions fused with the bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. We report here a detailed histochemical analysis of the Osgrp1-Gus expression patterns in transgenic rice plants. In roots of transgenic rice plants, GUS expression was specifically located in cell elongation and differentiation regions, and no GUS expression was detectable in the apical meristem and the mature region. In shoots, GUS activity was expressed only in young leaves or in the growing basal parts of developing leaves, and little GUS activity was expressed in mature leaves or mature parts of developing leaves. In shoot apices, GUS activity was detected only in those leaf cells which were starting to expand and differentiate, and GUS expression was not detected in the apical meristem and the young meristematic leaf primordia. GUS activity was highly expressed in the young stem tissue, particularly in the developing vascular bundles and epidermis. Thus, the expression of the Osgrp1 gene is closely associated with cell elongation/expansion during the post-mitotic cell differentiation process. The Osgrp1-Gus gene was also expressed in response to wounding and down-regulated by water-stress conditions in the elongation region of roots. Promoter deletion analysis indicates that both positive and negative mechanisms are involved in regulating the specific expression patterns. We propose a simple model for the developmental regulation of the Osgrp1 gene expression.
