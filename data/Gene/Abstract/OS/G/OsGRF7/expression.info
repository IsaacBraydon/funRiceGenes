OsGRF7	 While overexpression of OsGRF7 led to defects in growth, overexpression of OsGRF6, OsGRF8, and OsGRF9 resulted in better or no significant change of yield traits	 While overexpression of OsGRF7 led to defects in growth, overexpression of OsGRF6, OsGRF8, and OsGRF9 resulted in better or no significant change of yield traits
OsGRF7	 Overexpression of OsGRF7 causes a semidwarf and compact plant architecture with an increased culm wall thickness and narrowed leaf angles mediated by shortened cell length, altered cell arrangement, and increased parenchymal cell layers in the culm and adaxial side of the lamina joints	 Overexpression of OsGRF7 causes a semidwarf and compact plant architecture with an increased culm wall thickness and narrowed leaf angles mediated by shortened cell length, altered cell arrangement, and increased parenchymal cell layers in the culm and adaxial side of the lamina joints
