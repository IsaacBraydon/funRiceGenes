NA	miR396-OsGRFs Module Balances Growth and Rice Blast Disease-Resistance.	2019	Front Plant Sci	Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.	Fitness cost is a common phenomenon in rice blast disease-resistance breeding. MiR396 is a highly conserved microRNA (miRNA) family targeting Growth Regulating Factor (OsGRF) genes. Mutation at the target site of miR396 in certain OsGRF gene or blocking miR396 expression leads to increased grain yield. Here we demonstrated that fitness cost can be trade-off in miR396-OsGRFs module via balancing growth and immunity against the blast fungus. The accumulation of miR396 isoforms was significantly increased in a susceptible accession, but fluctuated in a resistant accession upon infection of Magnaporthe oryzae. The transgenic lines over-expressing different miR396 isoforms were highly susceptible to M. oryzae. In contrast, overexpressing target mimicry of miR396 to block its function led to enhanced resistance to M. oryzae in addition to improved yield traits. Moreover, transgenic plants overexpressing OsGRF6, OsGRF7, OsGRF8, and OsGRF9 exhibited enhanced resistance to M. oryzae, but showed different alteration of growth. While overexpression of OsGRF7 led to defects in growth, overexpression of OsGRF6, OsGRF8, and OsGRF9 resulted in better or no significant change of yield traits. Collectively, our results indicate that miR396 negatively regulates rice blast disease- resistance via suppressing multiple OsGRFs, which in turn differentially control growth and yield. Therefore, miR396-OsGRFs could be a potential module to demolish fitness cost in rice blast disease-resistance breeding.
NA	Rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR7 Modulates Plant Architecture through Regulating GA and IAA Metabolism 	2020	Plant Physiol	Wuhan University CITY: Wuhan STATE: Hubei China [CN].	Plant-specific GROWTH-REGULATING FACTORs (GRFs) participate in central developmental processes, including leaf and root development; inflorescence, flower and seed formation; senescence; and tolerance to stresses. In rice (Oryza sativa), there are 12 GRFs, but the role of the miR396-OsGRF7 regulatory module remains unknown. Here, we report that OsGRF7 shapes plant architecture via the regulation of auxin and gibberellin metabolism in rice. OsGRF7 is mainly expressed in lamina joints, nodes, internodes, axillary buds, and young inflorescences. Overexpression of OsGRF7 causes a semidwarf and compact plant architecture with an increased culm wall thickness and narrowed leaf angles mediated by shortened cell length, altered cell arrangement, and increased parenchymal cell layers in the culm and adaxial side of the lamina joints. Knock-out and knock-down lines of OsGRF7 exhibit contrasting phenotypes with severe degradation of parenchymal cells in the culm and lamina joints at maturity. Further analysis indicated that OsGRF7 binds the ACRGDA motif in the promoters of Cytochrome P450 gene (OsCYP714B1) and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 12 (OsARF12), which are involved in the gibberellin synthesis and auxin signaling pathways, respectively. Correspondingly, OsGRF7 alters the contents of endogenous gibberellins and auxins and sensitivity to exogenous phytohormones. These findings establish OsGRF7 as a crucial component in the OsmiR396-OsGRF-plant hormone regulatory network that controls rice plant architecture. 
NA	Rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 7 controls tiller number by regulating strigolactone synthesis	2020	Plant Signal Behav	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Key Laboratory for Research and Utilization of Heterosis in Indica Rice of Ministry of Agriculture, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University , Wuhan, China.	As an important transcription factor family, GROWTH-REGULATING FACTORs (GRFs) are involved in central development processes, including growth regulation, insect and disease resistance, and stress response. The OsGRF7 has recently been shown involving in modulating leaf angle through regulating GA and IAA metabolism. Interestingly, we found that OsGRF7 negatively regulates the tiller number. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of OsGRF7 underlying the tiller number determination are still not understood. Here, we report that OsGRF7 directly targets the promoter of the NODULATION SIGNALING PATHWAY2 (OsNSP2), a key factor involving in the strigolactone synthesis. Correspondingly, OsGRF7 alters the expression level of OsNSP2 and the endogenous strigolactone content, which rendered repression of the outgrowth of the axillary buds. These findings unveil a novel function of OsGRF7 in rice tillering determination.
NA	Spatial control of cell division by GA-OsGRF7/8 module in a leaf explaining the leaf length variation between cultivated and wild rice.	2022	New Phytol	National Institute of Plant Genome Research, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, 110067, India.	Cellular and genetic understanding of the rice leaf size regulation is limited, despite rice being the staple food of more than half of the global population. We investigated the mechanism controlling the rice leaf length using cultivated and wild rice accessions that remarkably differed for leaf size. Comparative transcriptomics, gibberellic acid (GA) quantification and leaf kinematics of the contrasting accessions suggested the involvement of GA, cell cycle and growth-regulating factors (GRFs) in the rice leaf size regulation. Zone-specific expression analysis and VIGS established the functions of specific GRFs in the process. The leaf length of the selected accessions was strongly correlated with GA levels. Higher GA content in wild rice accessions with longer leaves and GA-induced increase in the leaf length via an increase in cell division confirmed a GA-mediated regulation of division zone in rice. Downstream to GA, OsGRF7 and OsGRF8 function for controlling cell division to determine the rice leaf length. Spatial control of cell division to determine the division zone size mediated by GA and downstream OsGRF7 and OsGRF8 explains the leaf length differences between the cultivated and wild rice. This mechanism to control the rice leaf length might have contributed to optimizing leaf size during domestication.
