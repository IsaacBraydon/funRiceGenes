OsGRF7	yield	miR396-OsGRFs Module Balances Growth and Rice Blast Disease-Resistance.	 While overexpression of OsGRF7 led to defects in growth, overexpression of OsGRF6, OsGRF8, and OsGRF9 resulted in better or no significant change of yield traits
OsGRF7	leaf	Rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR7 Modulates Plant Architecture through Regulating GA and IAA Metabolism 	 Overexpression of OsGRF7 causes a semidwarf and compact plant architecture with an increased culm wall thickness and narrowed leaf angles mediated by shortened cell length, altered cell arrangement, and increased parenchymal cell layers in the culm and adaxial side of the lamina joints
OsGRF7	auxin	Rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR7 Modulates Plant Architecture through Regulating GA and IAA Metabolism 	 Here, we report that OsGRF7 shapes plant architecture via the regulation of auxin and gibberellin metabolism in rice
OsGRF7	auxin	Rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR7 Modulates Plant Architecture through Regulating GA and IAA Metabolism 	 Further analysis indicated that OsGRF7 binds the ACRGDA motif in the promoters of Cytochrome P450 gene (OsCYP714B1) and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 12 (OsARF12), which are involved in the gibberellin synthesis and auxin signaling pathways, respectively
