OsARF12	OsGRF7	Rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR7 Modulates Plant Architecture through Regulating GA and IAA Metabolism 	 Further analysis indicated that OsGRF7 binds the ACRGDA motif in the promoters of Cytochrome P450 gene (OsCYP714B1) and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 12 (OsARF12), which are involved in the gibberellin synthesis and auxin signaling pathways, respectively

OsGRF7	OsNSP2	Rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 7 controls tiller number by regulating strigolactone synthesis	 Here, we report that OsGRF7 directly targets the promoter of the NODULATION SIGNALING PATHWAY2 (OsNSP2), a key factor involving in the strigolactone synthesis
OsGRF7	OsNSP2	Rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 7 controls tiller number by regulating strigolactone synthesis	 Correspondingly, OsGRF7 alters the expression level of OsNSP2 and the endogenous strigolactone content, which rendered repression of the outgrowth of the axillary buds
