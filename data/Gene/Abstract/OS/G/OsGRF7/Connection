OsGRF7	OsNSP2	Rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 7 controls tiller number by regulating strigolactone synthesis	 Here, we report that OsGRF7 directly targets the promoter of the NODULATION SIGNALING PATHWAY2 (OsNSP2), a key factor involving in the strigolactone synthesis
OsGRF7	OsNSP2	Rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 7 controls tiller number by regulating strigolactone synthesis	 Correspondingly, OsGRF7 alters the expression level of OsNSP2 and the endogenous strigolactone content, which rendered repression of the outgrowth of the axillary buds
OsGRF7	OsGRF8	Spatial control of cell division by GA-OsGRF7/8 module in a leaf explaining the leaf length variation between cultivated and wild rice.	 Downstream to GA, OsGRF7 and OsGRF8 function for controlling cell division to determine the rice leaf length
OsGRF7	OsGRF8	Spatial control of cell division by GA-OsGRF7/8 module in a leaf explaining the leaf length variation between cultivated and wild rice.	 Spatial control of cell division to determine the division zone size mediated by GA and downstream OsGRF7 and OsGRF8 explains the leaf length differences between the cultivated and wild rice
