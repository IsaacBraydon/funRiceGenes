OsGF14d	cold stress	OsATL38 mediates mono-ubiquitination of the 14-3-3 protein OsGF14d and negatively regulates the cold stress response in rice	OsATL38 mediates mono-ubiquitination of the 14-3-3 protein OsGF14d and negatively regulates the cold stress response in rice
OsGF14d	cold stress	OsATL38 mediates mono-ubiquitination of the 14-3-3 protein OsGF14d and negatively regulates the cold stress response in rice	 The osgf14d knockout mutant plants were more sensitive to cold stress than wild-type rice plants, indicating that OsGF14d is a positive factor in the response to cold stress
OsGF14d	cold stress	OsATL38 mediates mono-ubiquitination of the 14-3-3 protein OsGF14d and negatively regulates the cold stress response in rice	 These results suggested that the RING E3 Ub ligase OsATL38 negatively regulates the cold stress response in rice via mono-ubiquitination of OsGF14d 14-3-3 protein
