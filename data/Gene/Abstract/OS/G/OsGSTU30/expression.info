OsGSTU30	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) tau class glutathione S-transferase (OsGSTU30) overexpression in Arabidopsis thaliana modulates a regulatory network leading to heavy metal and drought stress tolerance. |  Interestingly, q-RT PCR analysis also revealed higher expression of OsGSTU30 under drought conditions |  In this study, we characterize OsGSTU30 in response to drought as well as heavy metal [Cr(vi)] stresses through overexpression in Arabidopsis thaliana |  Biochemical and physiological analyses revealed that OsGSTU30 overexpression lines have improved tolerance against both stresses as compared to wild-type plants	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) tau class glutathione S-transferase (OsGSTU30) overexpression in Arabidopsis thaliana modulates a regulatory network leading to heavy metal and drought stress tolerance. |  In this study, we characterize OsGSTU30 in response to drought as well as heavy metal [Cr(vi)] stresses through overexpression in Arabidopsis thaliana |  Biochemical and physiological analyses revealed that OsGSTU30 overexpression lines have improved tolerance against both stresses as compared to wild-type plants
