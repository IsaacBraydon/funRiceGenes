Glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1,6.4.2) is an important reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzyme. The present study examined the relative importance of Na(+), Cl(-), and the osmotic component in NaCl-induced expression of Oryza sativa glutathione reductase (OsGR) genes in rice roots. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA levels for one cytosolic (OsGR2) and two chloroplastic (OsGR1 and OsGR3) isoforms of GR identified in the rice genome. The expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 but not OsGR1 was increased in rice roots treated with NaCl. Treatment with 150 mM NaCl and 150 mM NaNO(3) affected OsGR2 and OsGR3 induction similarly, which suggests that Na(+) but not Cl(-) is required for the NaCl-induced expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3. We also show that Na(+) but not Cl(-) is required for NaCl-enhanced GR activity and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production in rice roots. In addition to its component of ion toxicity, salt concentration in soil results in an osmotic effect. Here, we show that OsGR2 and OsGR3 expression, GR activity, and H(2)O(2) content were not affected at a concentration of mannitol iso-osmotic with 150 mM NaCl. NaCl-induced OsGR2 and OsGR3 in rice roots could be associated with Na(+) but not an osmotic component.
1-s2.0-S0176161711004883-main.pdf	Involvement of hydrogen peroxide in heat shock- and cadmium-induced expression of ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase in leaves of rice seedlings	2012	J Plant Physiol	Department of Agronomy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.	Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is considered a signal molecule inducing cellular stress. Both heat shock (HS) and Cd can increase H2O2 content. We investigated the involvement of H2O2 in HS- and Cd-mediated changes in the expression of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) in leaves of rice seedlings. HS treatment increased the content of H2O2 before it increased activities of APX and GR in rice leaves. Moreover, HS-induced H2O2 production and APX and GR activities could be counteracted by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors dipehenylene iodonium (DPI) and imidazole (IMD). HS-induced OsAPX2 gene expression was associated with HS-induced APX activity but was not regulated by H2O2. Cd-increased H2O2 content and APX and GR activities were lower with than without HS. Cd did not increase the expression of OsAPX and OsGR without HS treatment. Cd increased H2O2 content by Cd before it increased APX and GR activities without HS. Treatment with DPI and IMD effectively inhibited Cd-induced H2O2 production and APX and GR activities. Moreover, the effects of DPI and IMD could be rescued with H2O2 treatment. H2O2 may be involved in the regulation of HS- and Cd-increased APX and GR activities in leaves of rice seedlings.
10.1007-s11103-013-0095-3.pdf	Identification and characterization of a novel chloroplast/mitochondria co-localized glutathione reductase 3 involved in salt stress response in rice	2013	Plant Mol Biol	Department of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan.	Glutathione reductases (GRs) are important components of the antioxidant machinery that plants use to respond against abiotic stresses. In rice, one cytosolic and two chloroplastic GR isoforms have been identified. In this work, we describe the cloning and characterization of the full-length cDNA encoding OsGR3, a chloroplast-localized GR that up to now was considered as a non-functional enzyme because of assumed lack of N-terminal conserved domains. The expression of OsGR3 in E. coli validated that it can be translated as a protein with GR activity. OsGR3 shows 76 and 53 % identity with OsGR1 (chloroplastic) and OsGR2 (cytosolic), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 2 chloroplastic GRs in Poaceae species, including rice, sorghum and brachypodium, but only one chloroplastic GR in dicots. A plastid transit peptide is located at the N terminus of OsGR3, and genetic transformation of rice with a GR3-GFP fusion construct further confirmed its localization in chloroplasts. Furthermore, OsGR1 and OsGR3 are also targeted to mitochondria, which suggest a combined antioxidant mechanism in both chloroplasts and mitochondria. However, both isoforms showed a distinct response to salinity: the expression of OsGR3 but not OsGR1 was induced by salt stress. In addition, the transcript level of OsGR3 was greatly increased with salicylic acid treatment but was not significantly affected by methyl jasmonate, dehydration or heat shock stress. Our results provide new clues about the possible roles of functional OsGR3 in salt stress and biotic stress tolerance.
148.pdf	NaCl-induced expression of glutathione reductase in roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings is mediated through hydrogen peroxide but not abscisic acid	2009	Plant and Soil	Department of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in NaCl stress. Plants tolerant to NaCl stress may evolve certain strategies to remove these ROS, thus reducing their toxic effects. Therefore, the expression patterns of the gene family encoding glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2) were analyzed in roots of etiolated rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings in response to NaCl stress. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was applied to quantify the mRNA levels for one cytosolic (OsGR2) and two chloroplastic (OsGR1 and OsGR3) isoforms of glutathione reductase identified in the rice genome. The expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 but not OsGR1 was increased in rice roots treated with 150 mM NaCl. The Rab16A is an abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive rice gene. Increasing concentrations of ABA, from 1 to 12 μM, progressively increased the expression of OsRab16A in rice roots. In the present study, the ABA level was judged by the expression of OsRab16A in rice roots. Treatment with 150 mM NaCl induced the expression of OsRab16A, and the expression increased with increasing concentrations of ABA, which suggests that ABA may be involved in this response in rice roots. In fact, exogenous application of ABA enhanced the expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 in rice roots. On inhibiting ABA accumulation with sodium tungstate (Tu), an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis, the expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 was still induced by NaCl; therefore, NaCl-triggered expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 in rice roots is not mediated by accumulation of ABA. However, NaCl treatment could induce H2O2 production in rice roots, and H2O2 treatment resulted in enhanced OsGR2 and OsGR3 induction. On inhibiting the NaCl-induced accumulation of H2O2 with diphenylene iodonium, the expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 was also suppressed. Moreover, the increase in H2O2 level was prior to the induction of OsGR2 and OsGR3 in NaCl-treated rice roots. Thus, H2O2, but not ABA, is involved in regulation of OsGR2 and OsGR3 expression in NaCl-treated rice roots.
NA	Gene knockout of glutathione reductase 3 results in increased sensitivity to salt stress in rice.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Department of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan.	Glutathione reductase (GR) is one of important antioxidant enzymes in plants. This enzyme catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH) with the accompanying oxidation of NADPH. Previously, we showed that salt-stress-responsive GR3 is a functional protein localized in chloroplasts and mitochondria in rice. To learn more about the role of GR3 in salt-stress tolerance, we investigated the response to 100 mM NaCl treatment in wild-type rice (WT); GR3 knockout mutant of rice (gr3); and the functional gr3-complementation line (C1). Rice GR3 was primarily expressed in roots at the seedling stage and ubiquitously expressed in all tissues except the sheath at heading stage. GR3 promoter-GUS was expressed in the vascular cylinder and cortex of root tissues in rice seedlings, vascular tissue of nodes, embryo and aleurone layer of seeds, and young flowers. Under both normal and salt-stress conditions, total GR activity was decreased by 20 % in gr3. Oxidative stress, indicated by malondialdehyde content, was greater in gr3 than the WT under salt stress. As compared with the WT, gr3 was sensitive to salt and methyl viologen; it showed inhibited growth, decreased maximal efficiency of photosystem II, decreased GSH and GSSG contents, and the ratio of GSH to GSSG. Conversely, the gr3-complementation line C1 rescued the tolerance to methyl viologen and salinity and recovered the growth and physiological damage caused by salinity. These results reveal that GR3 plays an important role in salt stress tolerance by regulating the GSH redox state in rice.
