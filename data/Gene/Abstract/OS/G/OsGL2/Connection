GS2|OsGRF4|GL2|GLW2|LGS1	OsGL2	Effect of the CLE14 polypeptide on GLABRA2 homolog gene expression in rice and tomato roots.	 However, the CLE14 polypeptide treatment significantly inhibited the expression of the GL2 homolog genes of rice (OsGL2) and tomato (SlGL2)
OsGL2	OsTCL1	Ectopic expression of R3 MYB transcription factor gene OsTCL1 in Arabidopsis, but not rice, affects trichome and root hair formation.	 However, trichome and root hair formation in transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsTCL1 remained largely unchanged, and elevated expression of OsGL2 was observed in the transgenic rice plants, indicating that rice may use different mechanisms to regulate trichome formation
