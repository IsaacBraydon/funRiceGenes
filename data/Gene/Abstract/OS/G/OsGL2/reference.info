The CLAVATA3/ESR (CLE) plant polypeptides act as peptide hormones in various physiological and developmental aspects in a diverse array of land plants. One of the CLE family of genes, CLE14, is reported to induce root hair formation in Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Previously, we demonstrated that the application of synthetic CLE14 polypeptide treatment induced excess root hairs, and reduced the expression level of the non-hair cell fate determinant gene, GLABRA2 (GL2) in Arabidopsis roots. In this study, we investigated the function of synthetic CLE14 polypeptide in rice (Oryza sativa) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) roots. We measured the expression levels of the OsGL2 and SlGL2 genes, i.e., homologs of the Arabidopsis GL2 gene, in rice and tomato seedlings, respectively. Although CLE14 polypeptide treatment induced excess root hair formation in rice roots, substantial root hair induction was not observed in tomato roots. However, the CLE14 polypeptide treatment significantly inhibited the expression of the GL2 homolog genes of rice (OsGL2) and tomato (SlGL2). Our findings thus indicated that CLE14 can inhibit the GL2 gene expression in both rice and tomato plants, similar to the effect seen in Arabidopsis.
