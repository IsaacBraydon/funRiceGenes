NA	OsGRAS23, a rice GRAS transcription factor gene, is involved in drought stress response through regulating expression of stress-responsive genes.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	Shanghai Agrobiological Gene Center, Shanghai, 201106, China. kxu@sagc.org.cn.	Drought is a major abiotic stress factors that reduces agricultural productivity. GRAS transcription factors are plant-specific proteins that play diverse roles in plant development. However, the functions of a number of GRAS genes identified in rice are unknown, especially the GRAS genes related to rice drought resistance have not been characterized.In this study, a novel GRAS transcription factor gene named OsGRAS23, which is located in a drought-resistant QTL interval on chromosome 4 of rice, was isolated. The expression of OsGRAS23 was induced by drought, NaCl, and jasmonic acid treatments. The OsGRAS23-GFP fused protein was localized in the nucleus of tobacco epidermal cells. A trans-activation assay in yeast cells demonstrated that the OsGRAS23 protein possessed a strong transcriptional activation activity. OsGRAS23-overexpressing rice plants showed improved drought resistance and oxidative stress tolerance as well as less H2O2 accumulation compared with the wild-type plants. Furthermore, microarray analysis showed that several anti-oxidation related genes were up-regulated in the OsGRAS23-overexpressing rice plants. The yeast one hybrid test indicated that OsGRAS23 could bind to the promoters of its potential target genes.Our results demonstrate that OsGRAS23 encodes a stress-responsive GRAS transcription factor and positively modulates rice drought tolerance via the induction of a number of stress-responsive genes.

Our group has previously identified the activation of a GRAS transcription factor (TF) gene in the gain-of-function mutant population developed through activation tagging in rice (in an indica rice variety, BPT 5204) that was screened for water use efficiency. This family of GRAS transcription factors has been well known for their diverse roles in gibberellin signaling, light responses, root development, gametogenesis etc. Recent studies indicated their role in biotic and abiotic responses as well. Although this family of TFs received significant attention, not many genes were identified specifically for their roles in mediating stress tolerance in rice. Only OsGRAS23 (here named as OsGRAS22) was reported to code for a TF that induced drought tolerance in rice. In the present study, we have analyzed the expression patterns of rice GRAS TF genes under abiotic (NaCl and ABA treatments) and biotic (leaf samples infected with pathogens, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae that causes bacterial leaf blight and Rhizoctonia solani that causes sheath blight) stress conditions. In addition, their expression patterns were also analyzed in 13 different developmental stages. We studied their spatio-temporal regulation and correlated them with the in-silico studies. Fully annotated genomic sequences available in rice database have enabled us to study the protein properties, ligand interactions, domain analysis and presence of cis-regulatory elements through the bioinformatic approach. Most of the genes were induced immediately after the onset of stress particularly in the roots of ABA treated plants. OsGRAS39 was found to be a highly expressive gene under sheath blight infection and both abiotic stress treatments while OsGRAS8, OsSHR1 and OsSLR1 were also responsive. Our earlier activation tagging based functional characterization followed by the genome-wide characterization of the GRAS gene family members in the present study clearly show that they are highly appropriate candidate genes for manipulating stress tolerance in rice and other crop plants.
