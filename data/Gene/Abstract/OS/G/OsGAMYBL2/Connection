GSK2|OsGSK2	OsGAMYBL2	A brassinosteroid responsive miRNA-target module regulates gibberellin biosynthesis and plant development.	 Furthermore, OsGSK2, a key negative player in BR signaling, interacts with OsGAMYBL2 and prevents it from being degraded under 24-epibrassinolide treatment, whereas SLR1, a rice DELLA protein negatively regulating GA signaling, interacts with OsGAMYBL2 and prevents OsGAMYBL2 from binding to the target gene promoter
