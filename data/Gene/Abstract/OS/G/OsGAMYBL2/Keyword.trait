OsGAMYBL2	 ga 	A brassinosteroid responsive miRNA-target module regulates gibberellin biosynthesis and plant development.	 Furthermore, OsGSK2, a key negative player in BR signaling, interacts with OsGAMYBL2 and prevents it from being degraded under 24-epibrassinolide treatment, whereas SLR1, a rice DELLA protein negatively regulating GA signaling, interacts with OsGAMYBL2 and prevents OsGAMYBL2 from binding to the target gene promoter
OsGAMYBL2	 ga 	A brassinosteroid responsive miRNA-target module regulates gibberellin biosynthesis and plant development.	 GA signaling induces degradation of OsGAMYBL2 and, consequently, enhances BR signaling
OsGAMYBL2	 BR 	A brassinosteroid responsive miRNA-target module regulates gibberellin biosynthesis and plant development.	 Here, we show that BR suppresses the level of OsmiR159d, which cleaves the target OsGAMYBL2 gene
