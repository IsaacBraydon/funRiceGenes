OsGASR1	panicle	Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles	These results suggest that OsGASR1 and OsGASR2 were involved in cell division and might play diverse roles in differentation of panicles
OsGASR1	cell division	Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles	These results suggest that OsGASR1 and OsGASR2 were involved in cell division and might play diverse roles in differentation of panicles
OsGASR1	leaf	A gibberellin-stimulated transcript, OsGASR1, controls seedling growth and ¦Á-amylase expression in rice.	 In the osgasr1 mutants, the second leaf blades were much longer than those of the segregating wild type due to an increase in cell length
OsGASR1	growth	A gibberellin-stimulated transcript, OsGASR1, controls seedling growth and ¦Á-amylase expression in rice.	 These results suggest that OsGASR1 plays important roles in seedling growth and ¦Á-amylase gene expression
OsGASR1	seedling	A gibberellin-stimulated transcript, OsGASR1, controls seedling growth and ¦Á-amylase expression in rice.	 These results suggest that OsGASR1 plays important roles in seedling growth and ¦Á-amylase gene expression
OsGASR1	salt	A gibberellin-stimulated transcript, OsGASR1, controls seedling growth and ¦Á-amylase expression in rice.	From a T-DNA-tagging population in rice, we identified OsGASR1 (LOC_Os03g55290), a member of the GAST (gibberellin (GA)-Stimulated Transcript) family that is induced by salt stress and ABA treatment
OsGASR1	 ABA 	A gibberellin-stimulated transcript, OsGASR1, controls seedling growth and ¦Á-amylase expression in rice.	From a T-DNA-tagging population in rice, we identified OsGASR1 (LOC_Os03g55290), a member of the GAST (gibberellin (GA)-Stimulated Transcript) family that is induced by salt stress and ABA treatment
OsGASR1	salt stress	A gibberellin-stimulated transcript, OsGASR1, controls seedling growth and ¦Á-amylase expression in rice.	From a T-DNA-tagging population in rice, we identified OsGASR1 (LOC_Os03g55290), a member of the GAST (gibberellin (GA)-Stimulated Transcript) family that is induced by salt stress and ABA treatment
OsGASR1	stress	A gibberellin-stimulated transcript, OsGASR1, controls seedling growth and ¦Á-amylase expression in rice.	From a T-DNA-tagging population in rice, we identified OsGASR1 (LOC_Os03g55290), a member of the GAST (gibberellin (GA)-Stimulated Transcript) family that is induced by salt stress and ABA treatment
