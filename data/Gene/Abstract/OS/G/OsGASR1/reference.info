Both OsGASR proteins contain a cysteine-rich domain highly conserved among GAST family proteins in their C-terminal regions. Gibberellin A3 (GA3) stimulated expression of both OsGASRs in the wild-type Nipponbare and GA3 synthesis-deficient mutant. Expression of both OsGASRs apparently increased when cell proliferation entered the logarithmic phase, and rapidly reduced when cell proliferation was temporarily halted. RT-PCR analysis indicated different expression patterns of these genes in developing panicles. OsGASR1 was limitedly but strongly expressed in florets while OsGASR2 was expressed in both florets and branches. In situ hybridization showed that they were strongly expressed in the root apical meristem (RAM) and shoot apical meristem (SAM), but little signals were detected in mature leaves. Transient expression of OsGASR-GFP fusion proteins in onion epidermal cells revealed that both OsGASR proteins localized to the apoplasm or cell wall. These results suggest that OsGASR1 and OsGASR2 were involved in cell division and might play diverse roles in differentation of panicles.
NA	A gibberellin-stimulated transcript, OsGASR1, controls seedling growth and ¦Á-amylase expression in rice.	2017	J Plant Physiol	Department of Life Science, Sogang University, Seoul 121-742, Republic of Korea; Department of Plant Science, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, and Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, 151-921 Seoul, Republic of Korea.	From a T-DNA-tagging population in rice, we identified OsGASR1 (LOC_Os03g55290), a member of the GAST (gibberellin (GA)-Stimulated Transcript) family that is induced by salt stress and ABA treatment. This gene was highly expressed in the regions of cell proliferation and panicle development, as revealed by a GUS assay of the mutant line. In the osgasr1 mutants, the second leaf blades were much longer than those of the segregating wild type due to an increase in cell length. In addition, five ¦Á-amylase genes were up-regulated in the mutants, implying that OsGASR1 is a negative regulator of those genes. These results suggest that OsGASR1 plays important roles in seedling growth and ¦Á-amylase gene expression.
