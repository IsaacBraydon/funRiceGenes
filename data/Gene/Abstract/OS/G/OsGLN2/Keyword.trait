OsGLN2	root	Cloning, characterization and expression of OsGLN2, a rice endo-1,3-beta-glucanase gene regulated developmentally in flowers and hormonally in germinating seeds	 Northern analysis with a 3'-UTR gene-specific probe revealed that OsGLN2 is expressed exclusively in the paleae and lemmas during flowering, and no expression of OsGLN2 was detected in other tissues such as leaf blades, leaf sheaths, stems, nodes and roots in mature rice plants
OsGLN2	endosperm	Cloning, characterization and expression of OsGLN2, a rice endo-1,3-beta-glucanase gene regulated developmentally in flowers and hormonally in germinating seeds	 The OsGLN2 gene is also expressed in germinating seeds, where its expression is predominant in endosperms rather than embryos
