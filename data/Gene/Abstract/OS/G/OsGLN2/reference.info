The isolated OsGLN2 gene encoded a protein which displayed 72%, 93% and 92% identity at the amino acid level with those encoded by barley GII, rice Gns4 and glu1 1,3-beta-GLU genes, respectively. A GST-OsGLN2 recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli preferentially hydrolyzed Laminaria digitata 1,3;1,6-beta-glucan and liberated only oligosaccharides, suggesting that the enzyme can be classified as a 1,3-beta-GLU. Northern analysis with a 3'-UTR gene-specific probe revealed that OsGLN2 is expressed exclusively in the paleae and lemmas during flowering, and no expression of OsGLN2 was detected in other tissues such as leaf blades, leaf sheaths, stems, nodes and roots in mature rice plants. The OsGLN2 gene is also expressed in germinating seeds, where its expression is predominant in endosperms rather than embryos. In de-embryonated rice half-seeds, addition of gibberellin A3 (GA) greatly enhanced expression of the OsGLN2 gene, while the GA-induced gene expression was suppressed strongly by abscisic acid (ABA). This is the first report, to our knowledge, that OsGLN2 encodes a 1,3-beta-GLU and is expressed specifically in paleae and lemmas during flowering and in germinating seeds, where its expression is enhanced by GA and suppressed by ABA.
