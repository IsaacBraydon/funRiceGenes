030315.pdf	Cloning and characterization of a glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate translocator fromOryza sativa	2003	Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE A	The State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310029, China.	Plastids of nongreen tissues import carbon as a source of biosynthetic pathways and energy, and glucose 6-phosphate is the preferred hexose phosphate taken up by nongreen plastids. A cDNA clone encoding glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate translocator (GPT) was isolated from a cDNA library of immature seeds of rice and named as OsGPT. The cDNA has one uninterrupted open reading frame encoding a 42 kDa polypeptide possessing transit peptide consisting of 70 amino acid residues. The OsGPT gene maps on chromosome 8 of rice and is linked to the quantitative trait locus for 1000-grain weight. The expression of OsCPT is mainly restricted to heterotrophic tissues. These results suggest that glucose 6-phosphate imported via GPT can be used for starch biosynthesis in rice nongreen plastids.
100105.pdf	Molecular characterization of a carbon transporter in plastids from heterotrophic tissues: the glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate antiporter	1998	Plant Cell	Botanisches Institut der Universitat zu Koln, Lehrstuhl II, Cologne, Germany.	Plastids of nongreen tissues import carbon as a source of biosynthetic pathways and energy. Within plastids, carbon can be used in the biosynthesis of starch or as a substrate for the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, for example. We have used maize endosperm to purify a plastidic glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate translocator (GPT). The corresponding cDNA was isolated from maize endosperm as well as from tissues of pea roots and potato tubers. Analysis of the primary sequences of the cDNAs revealed that the GPT proteins have a high degree of identity with each other but share only approximately 38% identical amino acids with members of both the triose phosphate/phosphate translocator (TPT) and the phosphoenolpyruvate/phosphate translocator (PPT) families. Thus, the GPTs represent a third group of plastidic phosphate antiporters. All three classes of phosphate translocator genes show differential patterns of expression. Whereas the TPT gene is predominantly present in tissues that perform photosynthetic carbon metabolism and the PPT gene appears to be ubiquitously expressed, the expression of the GPT gene is mainly restricted to heterotrophic tissues. Expression of the coding region of the GPT in transformed yeast cells and subsequent transport experiments with the purified protein demonstrated that the GPT protein mediates a 1:1 exchange of glucose 6-phosphate mainly with inorganic phosphate and triose phosphates. Glucose 6-phosphate imported via the GPT can thus be used either for starch biosynthesis, during which process inorganic phosphate is released, or as a substrate for the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, yielding triose phosphates.
NA	Sporophytic control of anther development and male fertility by glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate translocator 1 (OsGPT1) in rice	2021	J Genet Genomics	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, China.	Coordination between the sporophytic tissue and the gametic pollen within anthers is tightly controlled to achieve the optimal pollen fitness. Glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate translocator (GPT) transports glucose-6-phosphate, a key precursor of starch and/or fatty acid biosynthesis, into plastids. Here, we report the functional characterization of OsGPT1 in the rice anther development and pollen fertility. Pollen grains from homozygous osgpt1 mutant plants fail to accumulate starch granules, resulting in pollen sterility. Genetic analyses reveal a sporophytic effect for this mutation. OsGPT1 is highly expressed in the tapetal layer of rice anther. Degeneration of the tapetum, an important process to provide cellular contents to support pollen development, is impeded in osgpt1 plants. In addition, defective intine and exine are observed in the pollen from osgpt1 plants. Expression levels of multiple genes that are important to tapetum degeneration or pollen wall formation are significantly decreased in osgpt1 anthers. Previously, we reported that AtGPT1 plays a gametic function in the accumulation of lipid bodies in Arabidopsis pollen. This report highlights a sporophytic role of OsGPT1 in the tapetum degeneration and pollen development. The divergent functions of OsGPT1 and AtGPT1 in pollen development might be a result of their independent evolution after monocots and dicots diverged.
