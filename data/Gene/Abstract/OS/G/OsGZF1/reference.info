Glutelins are the most abundant storage proteins in rice grain and can make up to 80 % of total protein content. The promoter region of GluB-1, one of the glutelin genes in rice, has been intensively used as a model to understand regulation of seed-storage protein accumulation. In this study, we describe a zinc finger gene of the Cys3His1 (CCCH or C3H) class, named OsGZF1, which was identified in a yeast one-hybrid screening using the core promoter region of GluB-1 as bait and cDNA expression libraries prepared from developing rice panicles and grains as prey. The OsGZF1 protein binds specifically to the bait sequence in yeast and this interaction was confirmed in vitro. OsGZF1 is predominantly expressed in a confined domain surrounding the scutellum of the developing embryo and is localised in the nucleus. Transient expression experiments demonstrated that OsGZF1 can down-regulate a GluB-1-GUS (beta-glucuronidase) reporter and OsGZF1 was also able to significantly reduce activation conferred by RISBZ1 which is a known strong GluB-1 activator. Furthermore, down-regulation of OsGZF1 by an RNAi approach increased grain nitrogen concentration. We propose that OsGZF1 has a function in regulating the GluB-1 promoter and controls accumulation of glutelins during grain development.
