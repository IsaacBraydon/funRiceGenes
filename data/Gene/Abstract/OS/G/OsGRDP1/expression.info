OsGRDP1	 Both the overexpression (OE) and knockdown (RNAi) of OsGRDP1 resulted in the lesion mimic phenotype	 Both the overexpression (OE) and knockdown (RNAi) of OsGRDP1 resulted in the lesion mimic phenotype	 Both the overexpression (OE) and knockdown (RNAi) of OsGRDP1 resulted in the lesion mimic phenotype |  Moreover, the intact protein level of OsGRDP1 was reduced in the spotted leaves from both OE and RNAi plants, suggesting that the disruption of intact OsGRDP1 is responsible for lesion formation
