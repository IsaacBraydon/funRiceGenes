Lesion mimic mutants constitute a valuable genetic resource for unraveling the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms governing the programmed cell death and defense responses of plants. Here, we identified a lesion mimic mutant spl-D from T-DNA insertion rice lines. The mutant exhibited higher accumulation of H2O2, spontaneous cell death, decreased chlorophyll content, up-regulation of defense-related genes, as well as enhanced disease resistance. The causative gene OsGRDP1 encodes a cytosol and membrane-associated glycine-rich domain protein. OsGRDP1 was expressed constitutively in all of the organs of the wild-type plants, but it was upregulated throughout plant development in the spl-D mutant. Both the overexpression (OE) and knockdown (RNAi) of OsGRDP1 resulted in the lesion mimic phenotype. Moreover, the intact protein level of OsGRDP1 was reduced in the spotted leaves from both OE and RNAi plants, suggesting that the disruption of intact OsGRDP1 is responsible for lesion formation. OsGRDP1 interacted with an aspartic proteinase OsAP25. In the spl-D and OE plants, proteinase activity was elevated, and lesion formation was partially suppressed by the aspartic proteinase inhibitor. Taken together, our results indicate that OsGRDP1 is a critical feedback regulator, thus contributing to the elucidation of the mechanism underlying cell death and disease resistance.
