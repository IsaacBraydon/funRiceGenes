NA	A Novel Glycine-Rich Domain Protein, OsGRDP1, Functions as a Critical Feedback Regulator for Controlling Cell Death and Disease Resistance in Rice	2020	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology and College of Plant Protection, China Agricultural University, Beijing, People's Republic of China.	Lesion mimic mutants constitute a valuable genetic resource for unraveling the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms governing the programmed cell death and defense responses of plants. Here, we identified a lesion mimic mutant spl-D from T-DNA insertion rice lines. The mutant exhibited higher accumulation of H2O2, spontaneous cell death, decreased chlorophyll content, up-regulation of defense-related genes, as well as enhanced disease resistance. The causative gene OsGRDP1 encodes a cytosol and membrane-associated glycine-rich domain protein. OsGRDP1 was expressed constitutively in all of the organs of the wild-type plants, but it was upregulated throughout plant development in the spl-D mutant. Both the overexpression (OE) and knockdown (RNAi) of OsGRDP1 resulted in the lesion mimic phenotype. Moreover, the intact protein level of OsGRDP1 was reduced in the spotted leaves from both OE and RNAi plants, suggesting that the disruption of intact OsGRDP1 is responsible for lesion formation. OsGRDP1 interacted with an aspartic proteinase OsAP25. In the spl-D and OE plants, proteinase activity was elevated, and lesion formation was partially suppressed by the aspartic proteinase inhibitor. Taken together, our results indicate that OsGRDP1 is a critical feedback regulator, thus contributing to the elucidation of the mechanism underlying cell death and disease resistance.
NA	LSL1 controls cell death and grain production by stabilizing chloroplast in rice.	2022	Sci China Life Sci	State Key Lab of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, China. rendeyong616@163.com.	Lesion mutants can be valuable tools to reveal the interactions between genetic factors and environmental signals and to improve grain production. Here we identified a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, lesion spotleaf1 (lsl1), which produces necrotic leaf lesions throughout its life cycle. LSL1 encodes a protein of unknown function and belongs to a grass-specific clade. The lesion phenotype of the lsl1 mutant was sharply induced by shading, and its detached leaves incubated in 6-benzylamino purine similarly formed lesions in the dark. In addition, the lsl1 mutant exhibited reactive oxygen species accumulation and cell death. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) and comet assays revealed that the lsl1 mutant contained severe DNA damage, resulting in reduced grain yield and quality. RNA sequencing, gene expression, and protein activity analyses indicate that LSL1 is required for chloroplast function. Furthermore, LSL1 interacts with PsaD and PAP10 to form a regulatory module that functions in chlorophyll synthesis and chloroplast development to maintain redox balance. Our results reveal that LSL1 maintains chloroplast structure, redox homeostasis, and DNA stability, and plays important roles in the interaction between genetic factors and environmental signals and in regulating grain size and quality.
