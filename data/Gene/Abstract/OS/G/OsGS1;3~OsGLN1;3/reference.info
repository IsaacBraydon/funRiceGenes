Ishiyama-2004-Biochemical backgrou.pdf	Biochemical background and compartmentalized functions of cytosolic glutamine synthetase for active ammonium assimilation in rice roots	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	RIKEN Plant Science Center, 1-7-22 Suehiro, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, 230-0045 Japan.	Rice plants in paddy fields prefer to utilize ammonium as a major nitrogen source. Glutamine synthetase (GS) serves for assimilation of ammonium in rice root, and ameliorates the toxic effect of ammonium excess. Among the three isoenzymes of the cytosolic GS1 gene family in rice, OsGLN1;1 and OsGLN1;2 were abundantly expressed in roots. Analysis of the purified enzymes showed that OsGLN1;1 and OsGLN1;2 can be classified into high-affinity subtypes with relatively high V(max) values, as compared with the major high-affinity isoenzyme, GLN1;1, in Arabidopsis. Low-affinity forms of GS1 comparable to those in Arabidopsis (GLN1;2 and GLN1;3) were absent in rice roots. The OsGLN1;1 and OsGLN1;2 transcripts showed reciprocal responses to ammonium supply in the surface cell layers of roots. OsGLN1;1 accumulated in dermatogen, epidermis and exodermis under nitrogen-limited condition. By contrast, OsGLN1;2 was abundantly expressed in the same cell layers under nitrogen-sufficient conditions, replenishing the loss of OsGLN1;1 following ammonium treatment. Within the central cylinder of elongating zone, OsGLN1;1 and OsGLN1;2 were both induced by ammonium, which was distinguishable from the response observed in the surface cell layers. The high-capacity Gln synthetic activities of OsGLN1;1 and OsGLN1;2 facilitate active ammonium assimilation in specific cell types in rice roots.

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants possess three homologous but distinct genes for cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS1): these are OsGS1;1, OsGS1;2, and OsGS1;3. OsGS1;1 was expressed in all organs tested with higher expression in leaf blades, while OsGS1;2, and OsGS1;3 were expressed mainly in roots and spikelets, respectively. We characterized knockout mutants caused by insertion of endogenous retrotransposon Tos17 into the exon-8 (lines ND8037 and ND9801) or the exon-10 (line NC2327) of OsGS1;1. Mendelian segregation occurred in each progeny. Homozygously inserted mutants showed severe retardation in growth rate and grain filling when grown at normal nitrogen concentrations. Abnormal mRNA for GS1;1 was transcribed, and the GS1 protein and its activity in the leaf blades were barely detectable in these mutants. The glutamine pool in the roots and leaf blades of the mutants was lower than that of the wild type. Re-introduction of OsGS1;1 cDNA under the control of its own promoter into the mutants successfully complemented these phenotypes. Progeny where Tos17 was heterozygously inserted or deleted during segregation showed normal phenotypes. The results indicate that GS1;1 is important for normal growth and grain filling in rice; GS1;2 and GS1;3 were not able to compensate for GS1;1 function.
NA	Cytosolic Glutamine Synthetase GS1;3 Is Involved in Rice Grain Ripening and Germination.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.	Ammonium is combined with glutamate to form glutamine. This reaction is catalyzed by glutamine synthetase (GS or GLN). Plants harbor several isoforms of cytosolic GS (GS1). Rice GS1;3 is highly expressed in seeds during grain filling and germination, suggesting a unique role in these processes. This study aimed to investigate the role of GS1;3 for rice growth and yield. Tos17 insertion lines for GS1;3 were isolated, and the nitrogen (N), amino acid, and ammonium contents of GS1;3 mutant grains were compared to wild-type grains. The spatiotemporal expression of GS1;3 and the growth and yield of rice plants were evaluated in hydroponic culture and the paddy field. Additionally, the stable isotope of N was used to trace the foliar N flux during grain filling. Results showed that the loss of GS1;3 retarded seed germination. Seeds of GS1;3 mutants accumulated glutamate but did not show a marked change in the level of phytohormones. The expression of GS1;3 was detected at the beginning of germination, with limited promoter activity in seeds. GS1;3 mutants showed a considerably decreased ripening ratio and decreased N efflux in the 12th leaf blade under N deficient conditions. The Î²-glucuronidase gene expression under control of the GS1;3 promoter was detected in the vascular tissue and aleurone cell layer of developing grains. These data suggest unique physiological roles of GS1;3 in the early stage of seed germination and grain filling under N deficient conditions in rice.
