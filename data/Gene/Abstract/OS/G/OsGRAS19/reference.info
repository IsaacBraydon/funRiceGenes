NA	Novel OsGRAS19 mutant, D26, positively regulates grain shape in rice (Oryza sativa).	2019	Funct Plant Biol	Fail	Grain size is an important factor in rice yield. Several genes related to grain size have been reported, but most of them are determined by quantitative trail loci (QTL) traits. Gene D26 is a novel site mutation of OsGRAS19 and involved in the brassinosteroid (BR) signalling pathway. However, whether D26 is involved in the process of rice reproductive development remains unclear. Here, gene cloning and functional analysis revealed that D26 has an obvious regulatory effect on grain size. Overexpression or CRISP/Cas9 mutant of D26 also showed that grain size was positively influenced. Cellular analyses show that D26 modulates grain size by promoting cell division and regulating the cell number in the upper epidermis of the glume. The overexpression results further suggest that the level of D26 expression positively impacts grain length and leaf angles and that the expression of several known grain size genes is involved in the regulation. Based on our results, D26, as a transcription factor, effectively improves rice grain shape.
NA	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c positively regulates immunity by modulating the protein homoeostasis of the GRAS protein OsSCL7 in rice.	2022	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Ecological Control of Fujian-Taiwan Crop Pests, Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Genetics, Breeding, and Multiple Utilization of Crops, Plant Immunity Center, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China.	Various types of transcription factors have been reported to be involved in plant-pathogen interactions by regulating defence-related genes. GRAS proteins, specific transcription factors, have been shown to play essential roles in plant growth, development and stress responses. By performing a transcriptome study on rice early defence responses to Magnaporthe oryzae, we identified a GRAS protein, OsSCL7, which was induced by M. oryzae infection. We characterized the function of OsSCL7 in rice disease resistance. OsSCL7 was upregulated upon exposure to M. oryzae and pathogen-associated molecular pattern treatments, and knocking out OsSCL7 resulted in decreased disease resistance of rice to M. oryzae. In contrast, overexpression of OsSCL7 could improve rice disease resistance to M. oryzae. OsSCL7 was mainly localized in the nucleus and showed transcriptional activity. OsSCL7 can interact with GF14c, a 14-3-3 protein, and loss-of-function GF14c leads to enhanced susceptibility to M. oryzae. Additionally, OsSCL7 protein levels were reduced in the gf14c mutant and knocking out OsSCL7 affected the expression of a series of defence-related genes. Taken together, these findings uncover the important roles of OsSCL7 and GF14c in plant immunity and a potential mechanism by which plants fine-tune immunity by regulating the protein stability of a GRAS protein via a 14-3-3 protein.
