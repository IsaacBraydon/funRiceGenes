GID1|OsGID1	Overexpression of OsGID1 Enhances the Resistance of Rice to the Brown Planthopper Nilaparvata lugens. |  In this study, we cloned the rice GA receptor gene OsGID1, whose expression was induced by damage from the brown planthopper (BPH) Niaparvata lugens, mechanical wounding, and treatment with salicylic acid (SA), but not jasmonic acid |  The overexpression of OsGID1 (oe-GID1) decreased BPH-induced levels of SA, H<U+2082>O<U+2082>, and three SA-pathway-related WRKY transcripts, but enhanced BPH-induced levels of ethylene	Overexpression of OsGID1 Enhances the Resistance of Rice to the Brown Planthopper Nilaparvata lugens. |  The overexpression of OsGID1 (oe-GID1) decreased BPH-induced levels of SA, H<U+2082>O<U+2082>, and three SA-pathway-related WRKY transcripts, but enhanced BPH-induced levels of ethylene
