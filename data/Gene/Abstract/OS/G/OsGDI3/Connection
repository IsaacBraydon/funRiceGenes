OsGDI3	OsMSRMK2|OsMAP1|OsMPK5|OsMAPK2|OsMAPK5|OsBIMK1	Rice GDP dissociation inhibitor 3 inhibits OsMAPK2 activity through physical interaction	 OsMAPK2 is one of OsGDI3 interacting proteins from yeast two-hybrid screens and subject to further analysis| A kinase assay showed that the autophosphorylation activity of OsMAPK2 is inhibited by OsGDI3 in vitro| Taken together, OsGDI3 functions as a negative regulator of OsMAPK2 through modulating its kinase activity
