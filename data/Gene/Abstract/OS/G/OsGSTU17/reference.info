The classical phase II detoxification glutathione transferases (GSTs) are key metabolic enzymes that catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to various electrophilic compounds. A tau class GST gene (OsGSTU17) was cloned from rice, which encodes a protein of 223 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 25.18 kDa. The recombinant OsGSTU17 formed a homodimer protein and showed GSH-conjugating activity with various xenobiotics. Kinetic analysis with respect to NBD-Cl as substrate revealed a K(m) of 0.324 mM and V(max) of 0.219 micromol/min per mg of protein. The enzyme had a maximum activity at pH 7.5, and a high thermal stability with 81% of its initial activity at 55 degrees C for 15 min. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Ser15 in the N-terminal domain is a critical catalytic residue, responsible for stabilisation of the thiolate anion of enzyme-bound glutathione. OsGSTU17 mRNA was expressed in different tissues of rice, both above and below ground. The relative transcript levels of OsGSTU17 mRNA varied significantly among the tissues in response to CDNB, hydrogen peroxide and atrazine treatments, indicating the gene has diverse regulation mechanisms in response to abiotic stresses.
NA	Effects of conserved Arg20, Glu74 and Asp77 on the structure and function of a tau class glutathione S-transferase in rice	2021	Plant Mol Biol	College of Life Sciences, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, 130118, China.	The relative position of domains is critical for enzymatic properties of tau class glutathione S-transferases, and altering the position of linker far away from the active center affects catalytic property. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of phase II detoxification enzymes whose main function is to improve plant resistance to stresses. To understand the structural effects of tau class GSTs on their function, using OsGSTU17 as an example, we predicted the residues involved in the interactions between its domains and linker region. We further detected the structural changes in mutants and the corresponding changes in terms of substrate activity and kinetic parameters. Four pairs of residues, including Ala14 and Trp165, Arg20 and Tyr154, Glu74 and Arg98, Asp77 and Met87, forming hydrogen bonds and salt bridges were found to play important roles in maintaining the relative position between the domains and linker region inside the protein. The hydrogen bond between Trp165 and Ala14 affected the structural stability has been demonstrated in our previous study. The mutant R20A lost almost all catalytic activity. Interestingly, the mutant E74A exhibited a significant decrease in activity towards 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1, 3-diazole, 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene and 4-nitrobenzyl chloride, while its activity towards substrate cumene hydroperoxide remained unchanged. Compared with other mutants, the mutant D77A exhibited decreased affinity to its substrates and increased activity towards 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene and cumene hydroperoxide, but its thermodynamic stability did not change significantly. The relative position of individual domain was critical for enzymatic properties, and the linker which is far away from the active site could change the enzymatic properties of GSTs via altering the relative position of the individual domain. Our results provide insights into the relationship between structure and function of tau class GSTs.
