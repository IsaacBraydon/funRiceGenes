Box 15005, Porto Alegre, RS, 91501-970, Brazil.	Fe participates in several important reactions in plant metabolism. However, Fe homeostasis in plants is not completely understood, and molecular studies on Fe-excess stress are scarce. Rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica) is largely cultivated in submerged conditions, where the extremely reductive environment can lead to severe Fe overload. In this work, we used representational difference analysis (RDA) to isolate sequences up-regulated in rice shoots after exposure to Fe-excess. We isolated 24 sequences which have putative functions in distinct cellular processes, such as transcription regulation (OsWRKY80), stress response (OsGAP1, DEAD-BOX RNA helicase), proteolysis (oryzain-alpha, rhomboid protein), photosynthesis (chlorophyll a/b binding protein), sugar metabolism (beta glucosidase) and electron transport (NADH ubiquinone oxireductase). We show that the putative WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY80 is up-regulated in rice leaves, stems and roots after Fe-excess treatment. This up-regulation is also observed after dark-induced senescence and drought stress, indicating that OsWRKY80 could be a general stress-responsive gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an Fe-excess-induced transcription factor in plants.
1471-2164-14-93.pdf	Antagonistic, overlapping and distinct responses to biotic stress in rice (Oryza sativa) and interactions with abiotic stress	2013	BMC Genomics	Centre for Computational Systems Biology, Bayliss Building M316 University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley 6009, Western Australia, Australia. reena.narsai@uwa.edu.au	BACKGROUND: Every year, substantial crop loss occurs globally, as a result of bacterial, fungal, parasite and viral infections in rice. Here, we present an in-depth investigation of the transcriptomic response to infection with the destructive bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae(Xoo) in both resistant and susceptible varieties of Oryza sativa. A comparative analysis to fungal, parasite and viral infection in rice is also presented. RESULTS: Within 24 h of Xoo inoculation, significant reduction of cell wall components and induction of several signalling components, membrane bound receptor kinases and specific WRKY and NAC transcription factors was prominent, providing a framework for how the presence of this pathogen was signalled and response mounted. Extensive comparative analyses of various other pathogen responses, including in response to infection with another bacterium (Xoc), resistant and susceptible parasite infection, fungal, and viral infections, led to a proposed model for the rice biotic stress response. In this way, a conserved induction of calcium signalling functions, and specific WRKY and NAC transcription factors, was identified in response to all biotic stresses. Comparison of these responses to abiotic stress (cold, drought, salt, heat), enabled the identification of unique genes responsive only to bacterial infection, 240 genes responsive to both abiotic and biotic stress, and 135 genes responsive to biotic, but not abiotic stresses. Functional significance of a number of these genes, using genetic inactivation or over-expression, has revealed significant stress-associated phenotypes. While only a few antagonistic responses were observed between biotic and abiotic stresses, e.g. for a number of endochitinases and kinase encoding genes, some of these may be crucial in explaining greater pathogen infection and damage under abiotic stresses. CONCLUSIONS: The analyses presented here provides a global view of the responses to multiple stresses, further validates known resistance-associated genes, and highlights new potential target genes, some lineage specific to rice, that play important roles in response to stress, providing a roadmap to develop varieties of rice that are more resistant to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses, as encountered in nature.
34546332.pdf	Constitutive expression of a rice GTPase-activating protein induces defense responses	2008	New Phytologist	Department of Biology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.	G-proteins (guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that usually exhibit GTPase activities) and related signal transduction processes play important roles in mediating plant defense responses; here, a rice (Oryza sativa) cDNA clone, OsGAP1, encoding a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that also contains a protein kinase C conserved region 2 (C2) domain is reported. An interacting G-protein partner for the OsGAP1 protein was identified by yeast two-hybrid library screening and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation; the GTPase-activation activity of OsGAP1 on this interacting G-protein was demonstrated using in vitro assays. OsGAP1 was induced by wounding in rice and the presence of the R locus Xa14 enhances such induction. Gain-of-function tests in transgenic rice and Arabidopsis thaliana showed that constitutive expression of OsGAP1 led to increased resistance to bacterial pathogens in both monocots and dicots.
J. Biol. Chem.-2010-Cheung-37359-69.pdf	An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein	2010	J Biol Chem	State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology and School of Life Sciences, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.	YchF is a subfamily of the Obg family in the TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases. The wide distribution of YchF homologues in both eukarya and bacteria suggests that they are descendents of an ancient protein, yet their physiological roles remain unclear. Using the OsYchF1-OsGAP1 pair from rice as the prototype, we provide evidence for the regulation of GTPase/ATPase activities and RNA binding capacity of a plant YchF (OsYchF1) by its regulatory protein (OsGAP1). The effects of OsGAP1 on the subcellular localization/cycling and physiological functions of OsYchF1 are also discussed. The finding that OsYchF1 and OsGAP1 are involved in plant defense response might shed light on the functional roles of YchF homologues in plants. This work suggests that during evolution, an ancestral P-loop GTPase/ATPase may acquire new regulation and function(s) by the evolution of a lineage-specific regulatory protein.
Plant Cell Physiol-2005-Heo-2005-18.pdf	OsGAP1 functions as a positive regulator of OsRab11-mediated TGN to PM or vacuole trafficking	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	Division of Applied Life Sciences, Graduate School of Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 660-701, Korea.	The Ypt/Rab family of small G-proteins is important in regulating vesicular transport. Rabs hydrolyze GTP very slowly on their own and require GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Here we report the identification and characterization of OsGAP1, a Rab-specific rice GAP. OsGAP1 strongly stimulated OsRab8a and OsRab11, which are homologs of the mammalian Rab8 and Rab11 proteins that are essential for Golgi to plasma membrane (PM) and trans-Golgi network (TGN) to PM trafficking, respectively. Substitution of two invariant arginines within the catalytic domain of Oryza sativa GTPase-activating protein 1 (OsGAP1) with alanines significantly inhibited its GAP activity. In vivo targeting experiments revealed that OsGAP1 localizes to the TGN or pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC). A yeast expression system demonstrated that wild-type OsGAP1 facilitates O. sativa dissociation inhibitor 3 (OsGDI3)-catalyzed OsRab11 recycling at an early stage, but the OsGAP1(R385A) and (R450A) mutants do not. Thus, GTP hydrolysis is essential for Rab recycling. Moreover, expression of the OsGAP1 mutants in Arabidopsis protoplasts inhibited the trafficking of some cargo proteins, including the PM-localizing H+-ATPase-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Ca2+-ATPase8-GFP and the central vacuole-localizing Arabidopsis aleurain-like protein (AALP)-GFP. The OsGAP1 mutants caused these proteins to accumulate at the Golgi apparatus. Surprisingly, OsRab11 overproduction relieved the inhibitory effect of the OsGAP1 mutants on vesicular trafficking. OsRab8a had no such effect. Thus, the OsGAP1 mutants may inhibit TGN to PM or central vacuole trafficking because they induce the sequestration of endogenous Rab11. We propose that OsGAP1 facilitates vesicular trafficking from the TGN to the PM or central vacuole by both stimulating the GTPase activity of OsRab11 and increasing the recycling of inactive OsRab11.
NA	Site-Directed Mutagenesis Shows the Significance of Interactions with Phospholipids and the G-protein OsYchF1 on the Physiological Functions of the Rice GTPase-Activating Protein 1 (OsGAP1).	2015	J Biol Chem	The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong;	The C2 domain is one of the most diverse phospholipid-binding domains mediating cellular signaling. One group of C2-domain proteins are plant-specific and are characterized by their small sizes and simple structures. We have previously reported that a member of this group, OsGAP1, is able to alleviate salt stress and stimulate defense responses, and bind to both phospholipids and an unconventional G-protein, OsYchF1. Here we solved the crystal structure of OsGAP1 to a resolution of 1.63 Ã…. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we successfully differentiated between the clusters of surface residues that are required for binding to phospholipids versus OsYchF1, which, in turn, is critical for its role in stimulating defense responses. On the other hand, the ability to alleviate salt stress by OsGAP1 is dependent only on its ability to bind OsYchF1 and is independent of its phospholipid-binding activity.
