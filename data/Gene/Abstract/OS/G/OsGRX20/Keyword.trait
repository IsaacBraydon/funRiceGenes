OsGRX20	resistance	A Rice CPYC-Type GlutaredoxinOsGRX20in Protection against Bacterial Blight, Methyl Viologen and Salt Stresses.	 Our results demonstrate that OsGRX20 functioned as a positive regulator in rice tolerance to multiple stresses, which may be of significant use in the genetic improvement of rice resistance
