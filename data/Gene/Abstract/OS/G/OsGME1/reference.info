NA	Ascorbate biosynthesis and its involvement in stress tolerance and plant development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation (INRES), Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Crops, University of Bonn, Karlrobert-Kreiten Strasse 13, 53115, Bonn, Germany.	Ascorbic acid (AsA) biosynthesis and its implications for stress tolerance and plant development were investigated in a set of rice knock-out (KO) mutants for AsA biosynthetic genes and their wild-types. KO of two isoforms of GDP-D-mannose epimerase (OsGME) reduced the foliar AsA level by 20-30 %, and KO of GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase (OsGGP) by 80 %, while KO of myo-inositol oxygenase (OsMIOX) did not affect foliar AsA levels. AsA concentration was negatively correlated with lipid peroxidation in foliar tissue under ozone stress and zinc deficiency, but did not affect the sensitivity to iron toxicity. Lack of AsA reduced the photosynthetic efficiency as represented by the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (Vmax), the maximum electron transport rate (Jmax) and the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter ΦPSII. Mutants showed lower biomass production than their wild-types, especially when OsGGP was lacking (around 80 % reductions). All plants except for KO mutants of OsGGP showed distinct peaks in foliar AsA concentrations during the growth, which were consistent with up-regulation of OsGGP, suggesting that OsGGP plays a pivotal role in regulating foliar AsA levels during different growth stages. In conclusion, our data demonstrate multiple roles of AsA in stress tolerance and development of rice.
