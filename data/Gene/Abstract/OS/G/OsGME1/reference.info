NA	Ascorbate biosynthesis and its involvement in stress tolerance and plant development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation (INRES), Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Crops, University of Bonn, Karlrobert-Kreiten Strasse 13, 53115, Bonn, Germany.	Ascorbic acid (AsA) biosynthesis and its implications for stress tolerance and plant development were investigated in a set of rice knock-out (KO) mutants for AsA biosynthetic genes and their wild-types. KO of two isoforms of GDP-D-mannose epimerase (OsGME) reduced the foliar AsA level by 20-30 %, and KO of GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase (OsGGP) by 80 %, while KO of myo-inositol oxygenase (OsMIOX) did not affect foliar AsA levels. AsA concentration was negatively correlated with lipid peroxidation in foliar tissue under ozone stress and zinc deficiency, but did not affect the sensitivity to iron toxicity. Lack of AsA reduced the photosynthetic efficiency as represented by the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (Vmax), the maximum electron transport rate (Jmax) and the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter ΦPSII. Mutants showed lower biomass production than their wild-types, especially when OsGGP was lacking (around 80 % reductions). All plants except for KO mutants of OsGGP showed distinct peaks in foliar AsA concentrations during the growth, which were consistent with up-regulation of OsGGP, suggesting that OsGGP plays a pivotal role in regulating foliar AsA levels during different growth stages. In conclusion, our data demonstrate multiple roles of AsA in stress tolerance and development of rice.
NA	Effect of Rice GDP-L-Galactose Phosphorylase Constitutive Overexpression on Ascorbate Concentration, Stress Tolerance, and Iron Bioavailability in Rice	2020	Front Plant Sci	School of Biosciences, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.	Ascorbate (vitamin C) is an essential multifunctional molecule for both plants and mammals. In plants, ascorbate is the most abundant water-soluble antioxidant that supports stress tolerance. In humans, ascorbate is an essential micronutrient and promotes iron (Fe) absorption in the gut. Engineering crops with increased ascorbate levels have the potential to improve both crop stress tolerance and human health. Here, rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants were engineered to constitutively overexpress the rice GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase coding sequence (35S-OsGGP), which encodes the rate-limiting enzymatic step of the L-galactose pathway. Ascorbate concentrations were negligible in both null segregant (NS) and 35S-OsGGP brown rice (BR, unpolished grain), but significantly increased in 35S-OsGGP germinated brown rice (GBR) relative to NS. Foliar ascorbate concentrations were significantly increased in 35S-OsGGP plants in the vegetative growth phase relative to NS, but significantly reduced at the reproductive growth phase and were associated with reduced OsGGP transcript levels. The 35S-OsGGP plants did not display altered salt tolerance at the vegetative growth phase despite having elevated ascorbate concentrations. Ascorbate concentrations were positively correlated with ferritin concentrations in Caco-2 cells - an accurate predictor of Fe bioavailability in human digestion - exposed to in vitro digests of NS and 35S-OsGGP BR and GBR samples.
