OsGA2ox8	 The overexpression of OsGA2ox8 significantly enhanced the osmotic stress tolerance of transgenic rice plants by increasing the number of osmotic regulators and antioxidants |  Importantly, OsGA2ox8 was able to indirectly regulate several genes associated with the anthocyanin and flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and the jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthetic pathway, and overexpression of OsGA2ox8 activated JA signal transduction by inhibiting the expression of jasmonate ZIM domain-containing proteins	 The overexpression of OsGA2ox8 significantly enhanced the osmotic stress tolerance of transgenic rice plants by increasing the number of osmotic regulators and antioxidants |  Importantly, OsGA2ox8 was able to indirectly regulate several genes associated with the anthocyanin and flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and the jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthetic pathway, and overexpression of OsGA2ox8 activated JA signal transduction by inhibiting the expression of jasmonate ZIM domain-containing proteins
