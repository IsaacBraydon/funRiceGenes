OsGA2ox8	OSVP1|VP1	Dynamic genome-wide association analysis and identification of candidate genes involved in anaerobic germination tolerance in rice	 Four reliable candidate genes were identified: Os01g0911700 (OsVP1), Os05g0560900 (OsGA2ox8), Os05g0562200 (OsDi19-1) and Os06g0548200
OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	OsGA2ox8	Molecular Dissection of the Gene OsGA2ox8 Conferring Osmotic Stress Tolerance in Rice	 The plants overexpressing OsGA2ox8 showed reduced lengths of shoots and roots at the seedling stage, but no difference in plant height at the heading stage was observed, which may be due to the interaction of OsGA2ox8 and OsGA20ox1, implying a complex feedback regulation between GA biosynthesis and metabolism in rice
