NA	Dynamic genome-wide association analysis and identification of candidate genes involved in anaerobic germination tolerance in rice	2021	Rice (N Y)	National Engineering Research Center of Plant Space Breeding, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Background: In Asian rice production, an increasing number of countries now choose the direct seeding mode because of rising costs, labour shortages and water shortages. The ability of rice seeds to undergo anaerobic germination (AG) plays an important role in the success of direct seeding.  Results: In this study, we used 2,123,725 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers based on resequencing to conduct a dynamic genome-wide association study (GWAS) of coleoptile length (CL) and coleoptile diameter (CD) in 209 natural rice populations. A total of 26 SNP loci were detected in these two phenotypes, of which 5 overlapped with previously reported loci (S1_ 39674301, S6_ 20797781, S7_ 18722403, S8_ 9946213, S11_ 19165397), and two sites were detected repeatedly at different time points (S3_ 24689629 and S5_ 27918754). We suggest that these 7 loci (-log10 (P) value > 7.3271) are the key sites that affect AG tolerance. To screen the candidate genes more effectively, we sequenced the transcriptome of the flooding-tolerant variety R151 in six key stages, including anaerobic (AN) and the oxygen conversion point (AN-A), and obtained high-quality differential expression profiles. Four reliable candidate genes were identified: Os01g0911700 (OsVP1), Os05g0560900 (OsGA2ox8), Os05g0562200 (OsDi19-1) and Os06g0548200. Then qRT-PCR and LC-MS/ MS targeting metabolite detection technology were used to further verify that the up-regulated expression of these four candidate genes was closely related to AG.  Conclusion: The four novel candidate genes were associated with gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) regulation and cell wall metabolism under oxygen-deficiency conditions and promoted coleoptile elongation while avoiding adverse effects, allowing the coleoptile to obtain oxygen, escape the low-oxygen environment and germinate rapidly. The results of this study improve our understanding of the genetic basis of AG in rice seeds, which is conducive to the selection of flooding-tolerant varieties suitable for direct seeding.
NA	Molecular Dissection of the Gene OsGA2ox8 Conferring Osmotic Stress Tolerance in Rice	2021	Int J Mol Sci	Institute of Crop Sciences/National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, South Zhong-Guan-Cun Street 12, Beijing 100081, China.	Gibberellin 2-oxidase (GA2ox) plays an important role in the GA catabolic pathway and the molecular function of the OsGA2ox genes in plant abiotic stress tolerance remains largely unknown. In this study, we functionally characterized the rice gibberellin 2-oxidase 8 (OsGA2ox8) gene. The OsGA2ox8 protein was localized in the nucleus, cell membrane, and cytoplasm, and was induced in response to various abiotic stresses and phytohormones. The overexpression of OsGA2ox8 significantly enhanced the osmotic stress tolerance of transgenic rice plants by increasing the number of osmotic regulators and antioxidants. OsGA2ox8 was differentially expressed in the shoots and roots to cope with osmotic stress. The plants overexpressing OsGA2ox8 showed reduced lengths of shoots and roots at the seedling stage, but no difference in plant height at the heading stage was observed, which may be due to the interaction of OsGA2ox8 and OsGA20ox1, implying a complex feedback regulation between GA biosynthesis and metabolism in rice. Importantly, OsGA2ox8 was able to indirectly regulate several genes associated with the anthocyanin and flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and the jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthetic pathway, and overexpression of OsGA2ox8 activated JA signal transduction by inhibiting the expression of jasmonate ZIM domain-containing proteins. These results provide a basis for a future understanding of the networks and respective phenotypic effects associated with OsGA2ox8.
