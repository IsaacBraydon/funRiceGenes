21023589.pdf	The auxin-responsive GH3 gene family in rice (Oryza sativa)	2006	Funct Integr Genomics	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, Benito Juarez Road, New Delhi, 110021, India.	Auxin regulates plant growth and development by altering the expression of diverse genes. Among these, the genes of Aux/IAA, SAUR, and GH3 classes have been extensively studied in dicots, but little information is available on monocots. We have identified 12 members of GH3 gene family in rice using sequences of full-length cDNA clones available from KOME and analysis of the whole genome sequence of rice. The genomic organization as well as chromosomal location of all the OsGH3 genes is reported. The rice GH3 proteins can be classified in two groups (groups I and II) on the basis of their phylogenetic relationship with Arabidopsis GH3 proteins. Based upon the sequences available in the database, not a single group III GH3 protein could be identified in rice. An extensive survey of EST sequences of other monocots led to the conclusion that although GH3 gene family is highly conserved in both dicots and monocots but the group III is conspicuous by its absence in monocots. The in silico analysis has been complemented with experimental data to quantify transcript levels of all GH3 gene family members. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction, the organ-specific expression of individual OsGH3 genes in light- and dark-grown seedlings/plants has been examined. The transcript abundance of nearly all OsGH3 genes is enhanced on auxin treatment, with the effect more pronounced on OsGH3-1, -2, and -4. The functional validation of these genes in transgenics or analysis of gene-specific insertional mutants will help in elucidating their precise role in auxin signal transduction.
Du-2012-A GH3 family member.pdf	A GH3 family member, OsGH3-2, modulates auxin and abscisic acid levels and differentially affects drought and cold tolerance in rice	2012	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, PR China.	Plant responses to abiotic stresses are coordinated by arrays of growth and developmental processes. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) play critical roles in developmental programmes and environmental responses, respectively, through complex signalling and metabolism networks. However, crosstalk between the two phytohormones in the stress responses remains largely unknown. Here, it is reported that a GH3 family gene, OsGH3-2, encoding an enzyme catalysing IAA conjugation to amino acids, is involved in the modulation of ABA level and stress tolerance. Expression of OsGH3-2 was induced by drought but was suppressed by cold. Overexpression of OsGH3-2 in rice caused significant morphological aberrations related to IAA deficiency, such as dwarfism, smaller leaves, and fewer crown roots and root hairs. The overexpressing line showed significantly reduced carotene, ABA, and free IAA levels, greater stomata aperture, and faster water loss, and was hypersensitive to drought stress. However, the overexpressing line showed increased cold tolerance, which was due to the combined effects of reduced free IAA content, alleviated oxidative damage, and decreased membrane penetrability. Furthermore, expression levels of some ABA synthesis- and stress-related genes were significantly changed in the overexpression line. It was conclude that OsGH3-2 modulates both endogenous free IAA and ABA homeostasis and differentially affects drought and cold tolerance in rice.
gkl118.pdf	'Evidence of an auxin signal pathway, microRNA167-ARF8-GH3, and its response to exogenous auxin in cultured rice cells'	2006	Nucleic Acids Res	Department of Biological Science and the Basic Science Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea 440-746.	MicroRNA167 (miR167) was shown to cleave auxin responsive factor 8 (ARF8) mRNA in cultured rice cells. MiR167 level was found to be controlled by the presence of auxin in the growth medium. When cells grew in auxin-free medium, miR167 level decreased, resulting in an increase in the level of ARF8 mRNA. Cells growing in the normal growth medium containing auxin showed a reversed trend. It was also shown that expression of OsGH3-2, an rice IAA-conjugating enzyme, was positively regulated by ARF8. Delivery of synthesized miR167 into cells led to decrease of both ARF8 mRNA and OsGH3-2 mRNA. This study provides an evidence in which the exogeneous auxin signal is transduced to OsGH3-2 through miR167 and ARF8 in sequence. This proposed auxin signal transduction pathway, auxin-miR167-ARF8-OsGH3-2, could be, in conjunction with the other microRNA-mediated auxin signals, an important one for responding to exogeneous auxin and for determining the cellular free auxin level which guides appropriate auxin responses.
Plant Physiol.-2010-Fu-pp.110.163774.pdf	Manipulating broad-spectrum disease resistance by suppressing pathogen-induced auxin accumulation in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research , Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Breeding crops with the quality of broad-spectrum disease resistance using genetic resources is one of the principal goals of crop improvement. However, the molecular mechanism of broad-spectrum resistance remains largely unknown. Here, we show that GH3-2, encoding an indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-amido synthetase, mediates a broad-spectrum resistance to bacterial Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzicola and fungal Magnaporthe grisea in rice (Oryza sativa). IAA, the major form of auxin in rice, results in rice more vulnerable to the invasion of different types of pathogens, which is at least partly due to IAA-induced loosening of the cell wall, the natural protective barrier of plant cells to invaders. X. oryzae pv oryzae, X. oryzae pv oryzicola, and M. grisea secrete IAA, which, in turn, may induce rice to synthesize its own IAA at the infection site. IAA induces the production of expansins, the cell wall-loosening proteins, and makes rice vulnerable to pathogens. GH3-2 is likely contributing to a minor quantitative trait locus for broad-spectrum resistance. Activation of GH3-2 inactivates IAA by catalyzing the formation of an IAA-amino acid conjugate, which results in the suppression of expansin genes. Thus, GH3-2 mediates basal resistance by suppressing pathogen-induced IAA accumulation. It is expected that, regulated by a pathogen-induced strong promoter, GH3-2 alone may be used for breeding rice with a broad-spectrum disease resistance.
psb0604_0570.pdf	Rice GH3 gene family: regulators of growth and development	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	Auxin is an indispensable hormone throughout the lifetime of nearly all plant species. Several aspects of plant growth and development are rigidly governed by auxin, from micro to macro hierarchies; auxin also has a close relationship with plant-pathogen interactions. Undoubtedly, precise auxin levels are vitally important to plants, which have many effective mechanisms to maintain auxin homeostasis. One mechanism is conjugating amino acid to excessive indole-3-acetic acid (IAA; main form of auxin) through some GH3 family proteins to inactivate it. Our previous study demonstrated that GH3-2 mediated broad-spectrum resistance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by suppressing pathogen-induced IAA accumulation and downregulating auxin signaling. Here, we further investigated the expression pattern of GH3-2 and other GH3 family paralogues in the life cycle of rice and presented the possible function of GH3-2 on rice root development by histochemical analysis of GH3-2 promoter:GUS reporter transgenic plants.
NA	SPOC domain-containing protein Leaf inclination3 interacts with LIP1 to regulate rice leaf inclination through auxin signaling.	2018	PLoS Genet	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.	Leaf angle is an important agronomic trait and influences crop architecture and yield. Studies have demonstrated the roles of phytohormones, particularly auxin and brassinosteroids, and various factors in controlling leaf inclination. However, the underlying mechanism especially the upstream regulatory networks still need being clarified. Here we report the functional characterization of rice leaf inclination3 (LC3), a SPOC domain-containing transcription suppressor, in regulating leaf inclination through interacting with LIP1 (LC3-interacting protein 1), a HIT zinc finger domain-containing protein. LC3 deficiency results in increased leaf inclination and enhanced expressions of OsIAA12 and OsGH3.2. Being consistent, transgenic plants with OsIAA12 overexpression or deficiency of OsARF17 which interacts with OsIAA12 do present enlarged leaf inclination. LIP1 directly binds to promoter regions of OsIAA12 and OsGH3.2, and interacts with LC3 to synergistically suppress auxin signaling. Our study demonstrate the distinct effects of IAA12-ARF17 interactions in leaf inclination regulation, and provide informative clues to elucidate the functional mechanism of SPOC domain-containing transcription suppressor and fine-controlled network of lamina joint development by LC3-regulated auxin homeostasis and auxin signaling through.
NA	OsGRETCHENHAGEN3-2 modulates rice seed storability via accumulation of abscisic acid and protective substances	2021	Plant Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Seed storability largely determines the vigor of seeds during storage and is significant in agriculture and ecology. However, the underlying genetic basis remains unclear. In the present study, we report the cloning and characterization of the rice (Oryza sativa) indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-amido synthetase gene GRETCHEN HAGEN3-2 (OsGH3-2) associated with seed storability. OsGH3-2 was identified by performing a genome-wide association study in rice germplasms with linkage mapping in chromosome substitution segment lines, contributing to the wide variation of seed viability in the populations after long periods of storage and artificial ageing. OsGH3-2 was dominantly expressed in the developing seeds and catalyzed IAA conjugation to amino acids, forming inactive auxin. Transgenic overexpression, knockout and knockdown experiments demonstrated that OsGH3-2 affected seed storability by regulating the accumulation level of abscisic acid. Overexpression of OsGH3-2 significantly decreased seed storability, while knockout or knockdown of the gene enhanced seed storability compared with the wild type. OsGH3-2 acted as a negative regulator of seed storability by modulating many genes related to the abscisic acid pathway and probably subsequently late embryogenesis-abundant proteins at the transcription level. These findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying seed storability and will facilitate the improvement of seed vigor by genomic breeding and gene-editing approaches in rice.
