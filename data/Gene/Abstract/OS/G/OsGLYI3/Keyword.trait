OsGLYI3	seed	OsGLYI3, a glyoxalase gene expressed in rice seed, contributes to seed longevity and salt stress tolerance.	 Our previous study suggested that OsGLYI3 may be effective in seed natural aging
OsGLYI3	seed	OsGLYI3, a glyoxalase gene expressed in rice seed, contributes to seed longevity and salt stress tolerance.	 In this study, the rice OsGLYI3 gene was cloned and characterized as specifically expressed in the seed
OsGLYI3	seed	OsGLYI3, a glyoxalase gene expressed in rice seed, contributes to seed longevity and salt stress tolerance.	 The accelerated aging (AA) treatment results indicated significant roles of OsGLYI3 in seed longevity and vigor, as the seeds of the transgenic lines with overexpressed and knocked-out OsGLYI3 exhibited higher and lower germination, respectively
OsGLYI3	seed	OsGLYI3, a glyoxalase gene expressed in rice seed, contributes to seed longevity and salt stress tolerance.	 Collectively, our results confirmed for the first time that OsGLYI3 is specifically expressed in rice seeds and contributes to seed longevity and salt stress tolerance
OsGLYI3	salt	OsGLYI3, a glyoxalase gene expressed in rice seed, contributes to seed longevity and salt stress tolerance.	 Collectively, our results confirmed for the first time that OsGLYI3 is specifically expressed in rice seeds and contributes to seed longevity and salt stress tolerance
OsGLYI3	tolerance	OsGLYI3, a glyoxalase gene expressed in rice seed, contributes to seed longevity and salt stress tolerance.	 Collectively, our results confirmed for the first time that OsGLYI3 is specifically expressed in rice seeds and contributes to seed longevity and salt stress tolerance
OsGLYI3	salt stress	OsGLYI3, a glyoxalase gene expressed in rice seed, contributes to seed longevity and salt stress tolerance.	 Collectively, our results confirmed for the first time that OsGLYI3 is specifically expressed in rice seeds and contributes to seed longevity and salt stress tolerance
OsGLYI3	stress	OsGLYI3, a glyoxalase gene expressed in rice seed, contributes to seed longevity and salt stress tolerance.	 Rice OsGLYI3 was markedly upregulated in response to NaCl induced stress conditions
OsGLYI3	stress	OsGLYI3, a glyoxalase gene expressed in rice seed, contributes to seed longevity and salt stress tolerance.	 Collectively, our results confirmed for the first time that OsGLYI3 is specifically expressed in rice seeds and contributes to seed longevity and salt stress tolerance
OsGLYI3	stress tolerance	OsGLYI3, a glyoxalase gene expressed in rice seed, contributes to seed longevity and salt stress tolerance.	 Collectively, our results confirmed for the first time that OsGLYI3 is specifically expressed in rice seeds and contributes to seed longevity and salt stress tolerance
