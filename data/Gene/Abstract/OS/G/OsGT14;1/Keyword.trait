OsGT14;1	growth	A Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase, OsGT14;1, is required for growth of both roots and shoots in rice.	 OsGT14;1 was broadly expressed in all organs throughout the entire growth period, with a relatively high expression in the roots, stems, node I and husk
OsGT14;1	growth	A Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase, OsGT14;1, is required for growth of both roots and shoots in rice.	 Taken together, OsGT14;1 located at the Golgi is required for growth of both roots and shoots in rice through affecting cellulose synthesis
OsGT14;1	salt	A Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase, OsGT14;1, is required for growth of both roots and shoots in rice.	 The knockout of OsGT14;1 did not affect the tolerance to toxic mineral elements, including Al, As, Cd and salt stress, but did increase the sensitivity to low pH
OsGT14;1	tolerance	A Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase, OsGT14;1, is required for growth of both roots and shoots in rice.	 The knockout of OsGT14;1 did not affect the tolerance to toxic mineral elements, including Al, As, Cd and salt stress, but did increase the sensitivity to low pH
OsGT14;1	salt stress	A Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase, OsGT14;1, is required for growth of both roots and shoots in rice.	 The knockout of OsGT14;1 did not affect the tolerance to toxic mineral elements, including Al, As, Cd and salt stress, but did increase the sensitivity to low pH
OsGT14;1	cellulose	A Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase, OsGT14;1, is required for growth of both roots and shoots in rice.	 Mutation of OsGT14;1 resulted in decreased cellulose content and increased hemicellulose, but did not alter pectin in the cell wall of roots and shoots
OsGT14;1	cellulose	A Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase, OsGT14;1, is required for growth of both roots and shoots in rice.	 Taken together, OsGT14;1 located at the Golgi is required for growth of both roots and shoots in rice through affecting cellulose synthesis
OsGT14;1	cell wall	A Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase, OsGT14;1, is required for growth of both roots and shoots in rice.	 Mutation of OsGT14;1 resulted in decreased cellulose content and increased hemicellulose, but did not alter pectin in the cell wall of roots and shoots
OsGT14;1	node	A Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase, OsGT14;1, is required for growth of both roots and shoots in rice.	 OsGT14;1 was broadly expressed in all organs throughout the entire growth period, with a relatively high expression in the roots, stems, node I and husk
OsGT14;1	glycosyltransferase	A Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase, OsGT14;1, is required for growth of both roots and shoots in rice	A Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase, OsGT14;1, is required for growth of both roots and shoots in rice
