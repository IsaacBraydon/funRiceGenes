GS2|OsGRF4|GL2|GLW2|LGS1	OsGRF11	Tightly controlled expression of OsbHLH35 is critical for anther development in rice	 Yeast one-hybrid screening identified three members of the Growth-Regulating Factor (GRF) family, OsGRF3, OsGRF4, and OsGRF11, as transcriptional regulators of OsbHLH35
OsGRF11	OsGRF3	Tightly controlled expression of OsbHLH35 is critical for anther development in rice	 Yeast one-hybrid screening identified three members of the Growth-Regulating Factor (GRF) family, OsGRF3, OsGRF4, and OsGRF11, as transcriptional regulators of OsbHLH35
OsbHLH035|OsbHLH35	OsGRF11	Tightly controlled expression of OsbHLH35 is critical for anther development in rice	 Yeast one-hybrid screening identified three members of the Growth-Regulating Factor (GRF) family, OsGRF3, OsGRF4, and OsGRF11, as transcriptional regulators of OsbHLH35
OsbHLH035|OsbHLH35	OsGRF11	Tightly controlled expression of OsbHLH35 is critical for anther development in rice	 Transactivation assay showed that OsGRF11 negatively regulates OsbHLH35 expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts
OsbHLH035|OsbHLH35	OsGRF11	Tightly controlled expression of OsbHLH35 is critical for anther development in rice	 This regulation was also observed in planta through the analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsGRF11 (OsGRF11OE), confirming that OsGRF11 is a negative regulator of OsbHLH35 in rice
