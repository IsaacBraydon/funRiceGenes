OsGF14h	OSVP1|VP1	Regain flood adaptation in rice through a 14-3-3 protein OsGF14h.	 OsGF14h acts as a signal switch to balance ABA signaling and GA biosynthesis by interacting with the transcription factors OsHOX3 and OsVP1, thereby boosting the seeding rate from 13
OsGF14h	Rc|qSD7-1|qPC7	Regain flood adaptation in rice through a 14-3-3 protein OsGF14h.	 Meanwhile, OsGF14h co-inheritance with the Rc (red pericarp gene) promotes divergence between temperate japonica cultivated rice and temperate japonica weedy rice through artificial and natural selection
