NA	Regain flood adaptation in rice through a 14-3-3 protein OsGF14h.	2022	Nat Commun	Rice Research Institute, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, 110866, China. sunjian811119@syau.edu.cn.	Contemporary climatic stress seriously affects rice production. Unfortunately, long-term domestication and improvement modified the phytohormones network to achieve the production needs of cultivated rice, thus leading to a decrease in adaptation. Here, we identify a 14-3-3 protein-coding gene OsGF14h in weedy rice that confers anaerobic germination and anaerobic seedling development tolerance. OsGF14h acts as a signal switch to balance ABA signaling and GA biosynthesis by interacting with the transcription factors OsHOX3 and OsVP1, thereby boosting the seeding rate from 13.5% to 60.5% for anaerobic sensitive variety under flooded direct-seeded conditions. Meanwhile, OsGF14h co-inheritance with the Rc (red pericarp gene) promotes divergence between temperate japonica cultivated rice and temperate japonica weedy rice through artificial and natural selection. Our study retrieves a superior allele that has been lost during modern japonica rice improvement and provides a fine-tuning tool to improve flood adaptation for elite rice varieties.
