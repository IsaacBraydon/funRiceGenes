NA	Regain flood adaptation in rice through a 14-3-3 protein OsGF14h.	2022	Nat Commun	Rice Research Institute, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, 110866, China. sunjian811119@syau.edu.cn.	Contemporary climatic stress seriously affects rice production. Unfortunately, long-term domestication and improvement modified the phytohormones network to achieve the production needs of cultivated rice, thus leading to a decrease in adaptation. Here, we identify a 14-3-3 protein-coding gene OsGF14h in weedy rice that confers anaerobic germination and anaerobic seedling development tolerance. OsGF14h acts as a signal switch to balance ABA signaling and GA biosynthesis by interacting with the transcription factors OsHOX3 and OsVP1, thereby boosting the seeding rate from 13.5% to 60.5% for anaerobic sensitive variety under flooded direct-seeded conditions. Meanwhile, OsGF14h co-inheritance with the Rc (red pericarp gene) promotes divergence between temperate japonica cultivated rice and temperate japonica weedy rice through artificial and natural selection. Our study retrieves a superior allele that has been lost during modern japonica rice improvement and provides a fine-tuning tool to improve flood adaptation for elite rice varieties.
NA	Genome-wide association study identifies a gene responsible for temperature-dependent rice germination.	2022	Nat Commun	Institute of Fermentation Sciences, Fukushima University, Fukushima, 960-1248, Japan. hyoshida@agri.fukushima-u.ac.jp.	Environment is an important determinant of agricultural productivity; therefore, crops have been bred with traits adapted to their environment. It is assumed that the physiology of seed germination is optimised for various climatic conditions. Here, to understand the genetic basis underlying seed germination, we conduct a genome-wide association study considering genotype-by-environment interactions on the germination rate of Japanese rice cultivars under different temperature conditions. We find that a 4â€‰bp InDel in one of the 14-3-3 family genes, GF14h, preferentially changes the germination rate of rice under optimum temperature conditions. The GF14h protein constitutes a transcriptional regulatory module with a bZIP-type transcription factor, OREB1, and a florigen-like protein, MOTHER OF FT AND TFL 2, to control the germination rate by regulating abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive genes. The GF14h loss-of-function allele enhances ABA signalling and reduces the germination rate. This allele is found in rice varieties grown in the northern area and in modern cultivars of Japan and China, suggesting that it contributes to the geographical adaptation of rice. This study demonstrates the complicated molecular system involved in the regulation of seed germination in response to temperature, which has allowed rice to be grown in various geographical locations.
