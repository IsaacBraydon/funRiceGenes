OsGF14h	transcription factor	Regain flood adaptation in rice through a 14-3-3 protein OsGF14h.	 OsGF14h acts as a signal switch to balance ABA signaling and GA biosynthesis by interacting with the transcription factors OsHOX3 and OsVP1, thereby boosting the seeding rate from 13
OsGF14h	development	Regain flood adaptation in rice through a 14-3-3 protein OsGF14h.	 Here, we identify a 14-3-3 protein-coding gene OsGF14h in weedy rice that confers anaerobic germination and anaerobic seedling development tolerance
OsGF14h	seedling	Regain flood adaptation in rice through a 14-3-3 protein OsGF14h.	 Here, we identify a 14-3-3 protein-coding gene OsGF14h in weedy rice that confers anaerobic germination and anaerobic seedling development tolerance

OsGF14h	ABA	Regain flood adaptation in rice through a 14-3-3 protein OsGF14h.	 OsGF14h acts as a signal switch to balance ABA signaling and GA biosynthesis by interacting with the transcription factors OsHOX3 and OsVP1, thereby boosting the seeding rate from 13
OsGF14h	ga	Regain flood adaptation in rice through a 14-3-3 protein OsGF14h.	 OsGF14h acts as a signal switch to balance ABA signaling and GA biosynthesis by interacting with the transcription factors OsHOX3 and OsVP1, thereby boosting the seeding rate from 13
OsGF14h	 ga 	Regain flood adaptation in rice through a 14-3-3 protein OsGF14h.	 OsGF14h acts as a signal switch to balance ABA signaling and GA biosynthesis by interacting with the transcription factors OsHOX3 and OsVP1, thereby boosting the seeding rate from 13
OsGF14h	GA	Regain flood adaptation in rice through a 14-3-3 protein OsGF14h.	 OsGF14h acts as a signal switch to balance ABA signaling and GA biosynthesis by interacting with the transcription factors OsHOX3 and OsVP1, thereby boosting the seeding rate from 13
OsGF14h	pericarp	Regain flood adaptation in rice through a 14-3-3 protein OsGF14h.	 Meanwhile, OsGF14h co-inheritance with the Rc (red pericarp gene) promotes divergence between temperate japonica cultivated rice and temperate japonica weedy rice through artificial and natural selection
OsGF14h	GA biosynthesis	Regain flood adaptation in rice through a 14-3-3 protein OsGF14h.	 OsGF14h acts as a signal switch to balance ABA signaling and GA biosynthesis by interacting with the transcription factors OsHOX3 and OsVP1, thereby boosting the seeding rate from 13
