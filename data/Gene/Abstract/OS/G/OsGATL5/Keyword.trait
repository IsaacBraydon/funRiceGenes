OsGATL5	salt	Expansion and Evolutionary Patterns of Glycosyltransferase Family 8 in Gramineae Crop Genomes and Their Expression under Salt and Cold Stresses in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica.	 We found that OsGolS1 was significantly up-regulated under salt stress, while OsGAUT21, OsGATL2, and OsGATL5 had remarkable up-regulation under cold stress
