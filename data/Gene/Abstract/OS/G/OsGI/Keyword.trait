OsGI	grain	Os-GIGANTEA confers robust diurnal rhythms on the global transcriptome of rice in the field	 Time-course metabolome analyses of leaves revealed no trends of change in primary metabolites in osgi plants, and net photosynthetic rates and grain yields were not affected
OsGI	dwarf	A study of phytohormone biosynthetic gene expression using a circadian clock-related mutant in rice	 Consistently, osgi-1 plants showed semi-dwarf phenotype with reduced internode and leaf sheath elongation
OsGI	reproductive	Circadian regulation of rice (Oryza sativa L.) CONSTANS-like gene transcripts	 The S3574 and C60910 genes were expressed to similar extents during the vegetative and reproductive phases, like OsGI
OsGI	sheath	A study of phytohormone biosynthetic gene expression using a circadian clock-related mutant in rice	 Consistently, osgi-1 plants showed semi-dwarf phenotype with reduced internode and leaf sheath elongation
OsGI	vegetative	Circadian regulation of rice (Oryza sativa L.) CONSTANS-like gene transcripts	 The S3574 and C60910 genes were expressed to similar extents during the vegetative and reproductive phases, like OsGI
OsGI	gibberellin	A study of phytohormone biosynthetic gene expression using a circadian clock-related mutant in rice	 Here we found that mRNA levels of a few major genes encoding GA2-oxidase which can inactivate bioactive gibberellins (GAs) were remarkably increased in osgi-1 plants
OsGI	flower	Adaptation of photoperiodic control pathways produces short-day flowering in rice	 Overexpression of OsGI, an orthologue of the Arabidopsis GIGANTEA (GI) gene in transgenic rice, caused late flowering under both SD and LD conditions
OsGI	heading date	A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice	 Hd3a expression is induced by Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) expression when blue light coincides with the morning phase set by OsGIGANTEA(OsGI)-dependent circadian clocks
OsGI	flower	Identification of dynamin as an interactor of rice GIGANTEA by tandem affinity purification (TAP)	 In rice, OsGI, Hd1 and Hd3a were identified as orthologs of GI, CO and FT, respectively, and are also important regulators of flowering
OsGI	flower	OsELF3 is involved in circadian clock regulation for promoting flowering under long-day conditions in rice	 Further investigations showed that the expression of OsGI and Ghd7 was up-regulated in the oself3 mutant, indicating that OsELF3 acts as a negative regulator upstream of OsGI and Ghd7 in the flowering-time control under long-day conditions
OsGI	yield	Os-GIGANTEA confers robust diurnal rhythms on the global transcriptome of rice in the field	 Time-course metabolome analyses of leaves revealed no trends of change in primary metabolites in osgi plants, and net photosynthetic rates and grain yields were not affected
OsGI	heading date	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	 Transcript levels of OsGI, phytochrome genes, and Early heading date3 (Ehd3), which function upstream of Ghd7, were unchanged in the mutant
OsGI	leaf	Physiological significance of the plant circadian clock in natural field conditions	 Recently, an extensive time-course transcriptome analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) leaves in natural field conditions revealed that OsGIGANTEA, the sole rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis GIGANTEA gene, governs the robust diurnal rhythm of rice leaf transcriptomes even under natural diurnal conditions; rice Osgi mutants exhibited severely defective transcriptome rhythms under strong diurnal changes in environmental cues
OsGI	flower	An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15	 Flowering genes downstream of OsPRR1 such as OsGI and Hd1 were down regulated in the A654 mutant
OsGI	flower	An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15	 Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and Hd1 by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 and thus induce late flowering
OsGI	grain yield	Os-GIGANTEA confers robust diurnal rhythms on the global transcriptome of rice in the field	 Time-course metabolome analyses of leaves revealed no trends of change in primary metabolites in osgi plants, and net photosynthetic rates and grain yields were not affected
OsGI	leaf	A study of phytohormone biosynthetic gene expression using a circadian clock-related mutant in rice	 Consistently, osgi-1 plants showed semi-dwarf phenotype with reduced internode and leaf sheath elongation
OsGI	flower	OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a	 Transcript levels of three flowering regulators-Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a-were decreased in these mutants, whereas those of OsGI and Hd1 were unchanged
OsGI	flower	OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a	 To further investigate the relationship with other flowering promoters, we generated transgenic plants in which expression of Ehd1 or OsGI was suppressed
OsGI	flower	OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a	 In summary, OsMADS51 is a novel flowering promoter that transmits a SD promotion signal from OsGI to Ehd1
OsGI	flower	Isolation of Rice Genes Possibly Involved in the Photoperiodic Control of Flowering by a Fluorescent Differential Display Method	 The expression patterns of the rice homolog of GI, OsGI, were similar to those of the Arabidopsis GI, suggesting the conservation of some mechanisms for the photoperiodic regulation of flowering between these two species
