In plants, flowering as a crucial developmental event is highly regulated by both genetic programs and environmental signals. Genetic analysis of flowering time mutants is instrumental in dissecting the regulatory pathways of flowering induction. In this study, we isolated the OsLF gene by its association with the T-DNA insertion in the rice late flowering mutant named A654. The OsLF gene encodes an atypical HLH protein composed of 419 amino acids (aa). Overexpression of the OsLF gene in wild type rice recapitulated the late flowering phenotype of A654, indicating that the OsLF gene negatively regulates flowering. Flowering genes downstream of OsPRR1 such as OsGI and Hd1 were down regulated in the A654 mutant. Yeast two hybrid and colocalization assays revealed that OsLF interacts strongly with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 that are potentially involved in light signaling. In addition, OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 colocalize with OsPRR1, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis APRR1 gene that controls photoperiodic flowering response through clock function. Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and Hd1 by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 and thus induce late flowering.
10.1007-s00425-009-0893-7.pdf	Functional characterization of rice OsDof12	2009	Planta	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Plant Gene Research Centre (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 5 Datun Road, Chaoyang District, 100101, Beijing, China. djli@genetics.ac.cn	DNA-binding with one finger (Dof) proteins are a large family of transcription factors involved in a variety of biological processes in plants. In rice, 30 different Dof genes have been identified through genome analysis. Here we report the functional characteristics of a rice Dof gene, OsDof12, which encodes a predicted Dof protein. The nuclear localization of OsDof12 was investigated by the transient expression assays of the OsDof12-GFP fusion protein in onion epidermal cells. Trans-activation assays in a yeast one-hybrid system indicated that OsDof12 had transcriptional activity. RNA expression analyses showed that the expression of OsDof12 was not tissue-specific in general and fluctuated at different development stages in rice. In addition, OsDof12 was strongly inhibited by dark treatments. The transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12 showed early flowering under long-day (LD) conditions, whereas OsDof12 overexpression had no effect on flowering time under short-day (SD) conditions. In transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12, the transcription levels of Hd3a and OsMADS14 were up-regulated under LD conditions but not SD conditions, whereas the expression of Hd1, OsMADS51, Ehd1 and OsGI did not change under LD and SD conditions. These results suggested that OsDof12 might regulate flowering by controlling the expression of Hd3a and OsMADS14.
1741.pdf	Os-GIGANTEA confers robust diurnal rhythms on the global transcriptome of rice in the field	2011	Plant Cell	Photosynthesis and Photobiology Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Japan. tizawa@nias.affrc.go.jp	The circadian clock controls physiological traits such as flowering time, photosynthesis, and growth in plants under laboratory conditions. Under natural field conditions, however, little is known about the significance of the circadian clock in plants. By time-course transcriptome analyses of rice (Oryza sativa) leaves, using a newly isolated rice circadian clock-related mutant carrying a null mutation in Os-GIGANTEA (Os-GI), we show here that Os-GI controlled 75% (false discovery rate = 0.05) of genes among 27,201 genes tested and was required for strong amplitudes and fine-tuning of the diurnal rhythm phases of global gene expression in the field. However, transcripts involved in primary metabolism were not greatly affected by osgi. Time-course metabolome analyses of leaves revealed no trends of change in primary metabolites in osgi plants, and net photosynthetic rates and grain yields were not affected. By contrast, some transcripts and metabolites in the phenylpropanoid metabolite pathway were consistently affected. Thus, net primary assimilation of rice was still robust in the face of such osgi mutation-related circadian clock defects in the field, unlike the case with defects caused by Arabidopsis thaliana toc1 and ztl mutations in the laboratory.
18518897.pdf	Circadian regulation of rice (Oryza sativa L.) CONSTANS-like gene transcripts	2004	Mol Cells	School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Korea.	We identified three rice cDNA clones showing amino acid similarity to the Arabidopsis CONSTANS-like proteins from a database search (S12569, S3574, and C60910), to examine if their transcript abundances were under circadian control. Unlike the other two proteins, the protein encoded by the S12569 cDNA contains only one CONSTANS-like zinc finger B box, and a CCT region. We found that the transcript levels of these rice CONSTANS-like (COL) genes were under circadian control. The oscillation phase of the S12569 gene transcript was more or less opposite to those of OsGI (rice GIGANTEA homolog) and Hd1 (rice COSTANS homolog), whereas the phases of the other two gene transcripts were similar to that of the Hd1 transcript. S12569 mRNA started to increase about 3 h after the onset of the dark period, with a peak about 3 h after its end. The S3574 and C60910 genes were expressed to similar extents during the vegetative and reproductive phases, like OsGI. Higher levels of S12569 transcripts, however, like those of Hd1, were detected in the earlier stages of panicle development. Unlike Hd1 transcripts, S12569, S3574, and C60910 transcripts were present at similar levels in the aerial parts of plants and in their roots during the vegetative phase. In conclusion, the rice COL genes showed distinctive expression patterns from the CO and COL genes, as well as Hd1, a rice CO homolog.
Adaptation of photoperiodic control pathways produces short-day flowering in rice.pdf	Adaptation of photoperiodic control pathways produces short-day flowering in rice	2003	Nature	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma 630-0101, Japan.	The photoperiodic control of flowering is one of the important developmental processes of plants because it is directly related to successful reproduction. Although the molecular genetic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana, a long-day (LD) plant, has provided models to explain the control of flowering time in this species, very little is known about its molecular mechanisms for short-day (SD) plants. Here we show how the photoperiodic control of flowering is regulated in rice, a SD plant. Overexpression of OsGI, an orthologue of the Arabidopsis GIGANTEA (GI) gene in transgenic rice, caused late flowering under both SD and LD conditions. Expression of the rice orthologue of the Arabidopsis CONSTANS (CO) gene was increased in the transgenic rice, whereas expression of the rice orthologue of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) was suppressed. Our results indicate that three key regulatory genes for the photoperiodic control of flowering are conserved between Arabidopsis, a LD plant, and rice, a SD plant, but regulation of the FT gene by CO was reversed, resulting in the suppression of flowering in rice under LD conditions.
j.1365-3040.2009.02008.x.pdf	OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice	2009	Plant Cell Environ	Department of Life Science and Functional Genomic Center, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea.	In much of the tropics and subtropics, rice (Oryza sativa L.) is grown under long days (LDs). Therefore, LD must play a major role in inducing flowering signal in rice. However, little is known on LD-dependent flowering signal in the species. We previously reported that OsMADS50, which is highly homologous to Arabidopsis SOC1, functions as a positive regulator for flowering. However, its detailed photoperiodic mechanism was not yet elucidated. Here, we report the functional analysis of OsMADS50 and its closely related gene OsMADS56. Knock-out of OsMADS50 caused a late-flowering phenotype only under LD conditions. Overexpression of OsMADS56 (56OX) also resulted in delayed flowering under LD. In the osmads50 mutants and 56OX transgenic plants, transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 were reduced, although that of OsLFL1 increased. On the other hand, mRNA levels of OsGI, Hd1, OsId1, OsDof12, Ghd7, Hd6 and SE5 were unchanged. These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in regulating LD-dependent flowering. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses indicated an interaction between those two proteins as well as their formation of homodimers. These results suggest that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 may form a complex that regulates downstream target genes.
j.1365-3040.2012.02555.x.pdf	Physiological significance of the plant circadian clock in natural field conditions	2012	Plant Cell Environ	Functional Plant Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Japan. tizawa@nias.affrc.go.jp	For many decades, researchers have focused on the self-sustainable oscillations of plant circadian clocks, which can only be observed under artificial constant environmental conditions. However, plants have evolved under natural diurnal conditions where several major environmental cues such as light, temperature and humidity are dramatically changing and interacting with each other. Therefore, little is known about the roles of the plant circadian clock in natural field conditions. Molecular genetic analyses in Arabidopsis thaliana have revealed that some core circadian clock genes are required for the establishment of robust circadian rhythms under artificial diurnal conditions, and that others function only as self-oscillators. However, it is largely unknown yet how those robust rhythms can be obtained under natural diurnal conditions. Recently, an extensive time-course transcriptome analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) leaves in natural field conditions revealed that OsGIGANTEA, the sole rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis GIGANTEA gene, governs the robust diurnal rhythm of rice leaf transcriptomes even under natural diurnal conditions; rice Osgi mutants exhibited severely defective transcriptome rhythms under strong diurnal changes in environmental cues. This review focuses on the physiological significance of the plant circadian clock in natural field conditions.
j.1365-313X.2004.02082.x.pdf	Functional analyses of the flowering time gene OsMADS50, the putative SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1/AGAMOUS-LIKE 20 (SOC1/AGL20) ortholog in rice	2004	Plant J	National Research Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics, Division of Molecular and Life Sciences, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang 790-784, Korea.	A late-flowering mutant was isolated from rice T-DNA-tagging lines. T-DNA had been integrated into the K-box region of Oryza sativa MADS50 (OsMADS50), which shares 50.6% amino acid identity with the Arabidopsis MADS-box gene SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1/AGAMOUS-LIKE 20 (SOC1/AGL20). While overexpression of OsMADS50 caused extremely early flowering at the callus stage, OsMADS50 RNAi plants exhibited phenotypes of late flowering and an increase in the number of elongated internodes. This confirmed that the phenotypes observed in the knockout (KO) plants are because of the mutation in OsMADS50. RT-PCR analyses of the OsMADS50 KO and ubiquitin (ubi):OsMADS50 plants showed that OsMADS50 is an upstream regulator of OsMADS1, OsMADS14, OsMADS15, OsMADS18, and Hd (Heading date)3a, but works either parallel with or downstream of Hd1 and O. sativa GIGANTEA (OsGI). These results suggest that OsMADS50 is an important flowering activator that controls various floral regulators in rice.
Mol. Plant-2013-Yang-202-15.pdf	OsELF3 is involved in circadian clock regulation for promoting flowering under long-day conditions in rice	2013	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research-Wuhan, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Heading date is a critical trait that determines cropping seasons and regional adaptability in rice (Oryza sativa). Research efforts during the last decade have identified some important photoperiod pathway genes that are conserved between Arabidopsis and rice. In this study, we identified a novel gene, Oryza sativa ELF3 (OsELF3), which is a putative homolog of the ELF3 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. OsELF3 was required for the control of heading date under long-day conditions. Its Tos17-tagging mutants exhibited a delayed heading date phenotype only under long-day, but not short-day, conditions. OsELF3 was highly expressed in leaf blades, and the OsELF3 protein was localized in the nucleolus. An obvious diurnal rhythm of OsELF3 transcript level was observed, with a trough in the early day and a peak in the late night in wild-type plants. However, this expression pattern was disrupted in oself3 mutants. Further investigations showed that the expression of OsGI and Ghd7 was up-regulated in the oself3 mutant, indicating that OsELF3 acts as a negative regulator upstream of OsGI and Ghd7 in the flowering-time control under long-day conditions. The rhythmic expression of circadian clock-related genes, including some OsPRR members, was obviously affected in oself3 mutants. Our results indicated that OsELF3 acts as a floral activator in the long-day photoperiodic pathway via its crosstalk with the circadian clock in rice.
ng.606.pdf	A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice	2010	Nat Genet	Photosynthesis and Photobiology Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Japan.	The critical day length triggering photoperiodic flowering is set as an acute, accurate threshold in many short-day plants, including rice. Here, we show that, unlike the Arabidopsis florigen gene FT, the rice florigen gene Hd3a (Heading date 3a) is toggled by only a 30-min day-length reduction. Hd3a expression is induced by Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) expression when blue light coincides with the morning phase set by OsGIGANTEA(OsGI)-dependent circadian clocks. Ehd1 expression is repressed by both night breaks under short-day conditions and morning light signals under long-day conditions. Ghd7 (Grain number, plant height and heading date 7) was acutely induced when phytochrome signals coincided with a photosensitive phase set differently by distinct photoperiods and this induction repressed Ehd1 the next morning. Thus, two distinct gating mechanisms--of the floral promoter Ehd1 and the floral repressor Ghd7--could enable manipulation of slight differences in day length to control Hd3a transcription with a critical day-length threshold.
Plant Cell Physiol-2002-Hayama-494-504.pdf	Isolation of Rice Genes Possibly Involved in the Photoperiodic Control of Flowering by a Fluorescent Differential Display Method	2002	Plant and Cell Physiology	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma, 630-0101 Japan	To better understand the molecular mechanisms of the photoperiodic regulation of rice, a short-day plant, we isolated 27 cDNAs that were differentially expressed in the photoperiod-insensitive se5 mutant from approximately 8,400 independent mRNA species by the use of a fluorescent differential display (FDD). For this screening, we isolated mRNAs at five different time points during the night and compared their expression patterns between se5 and the wild type. Of 27 cDNAs isolated, 12 showed diurnal expression patterns often associated with genes involved in the determination of the flowering time. In se5, expression of nine cDNAs was increased. Five of these cDNAs were up-regulated under SD, suggesting that they may promote flowering under SD. They included genes encoding a cDNA containing a putative NAC domain, the fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, and a protease inhibitor. Expression of three cDNAs was decreased in se5 but not photoperiodically regulated. These cDNAs included a rice homolog of Arabidopsis GIGANTEA (GI), lir1, and a gene for myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase, all of which were previously shown to be under the control of circadian clocks. The expression patterns of the rice homolog of GI, OsGI, were similar to those of the Arabidopsis GI, suggesting the conservation of some mechanisms for the photoperiodic regulation of flowering between these two species.
Plant Cell Physiol-2008-Abe-420-32.pdf	Identification of dynamin as an interactor of rice GIGANTEA by tandem affinity purification (TAP)	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma 630-0101, Japan.	GIGANTEA (GI), CONSTANS (CO) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) regulate photoperiodic flowering in Arabidopsis. In rice, OsGI, Hd1 and Hd3a were identified as orthologs of GI, CO and FT, respectively, and are also important regulators of flowering. Although GI has roles in both flowering and the circadian clock, our understanding of its biochemical functions is still limited. In this study, we purified novel OsGI-interacting proteins by using the tandem affinity purification (TAP) method. The TAP method has been used effectively in a number of model species to isolate proteins that interact with proteins of interest. However, in plants, the TAP method has been used in only a few studies, and no novel proteins have previously been isolated by this method. We generated transgenic rice plants and cell cultures expressing a TAP-tagged version of OsGI. After a two-step purification procedure, the interacting proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Seven proteins, including dynamin, were identified as OsGI-interacting proteins. The interaction of OsGI with dynamin was verified by co-immunoprecipitation using a myc-tagged version of OsGI. Moreover, an analysis of Arabidopsis dynamin mutants indicated that although the flowering times of the mutants were not different from those of wild-type plants, an aerial rosette phenotype was observed in the mutants. We also found that OsGI is present in both the nucleus and the cytosol by Western blot analysis and by transient assays. These results indicate that the TAP method is effective for the isolation of novel proteins that interact with target proteins in plants.
Plant Physiol.-2007-Kim-1484-94.pdf	OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a	2007	Plant Physiol	Division of Molecular and Life Sciences and Biotechnology Research Center, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang 790-784, Republic of Korea.	Although flowering regulatory mechanisms have been extensively studied in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), those in other species have not been well elucidated. Here, we investigated the role of OsMADS51, a type I MADS-box gene in the short-day (SD) promotion pathway in rice (Oryza sativa). In SDs OsMADS51 null mutants flowered 2 weeks later than normal, whereas in long days loss of OsMADS51 had little effect on flowering. Transcript levels of three flowering regulators-Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a-were decreased in these mutants, whereas those of OsGI and Hd1 were unchanged. Ectopic expression of OsMADS51 caused flowering to occur about 7 d earlier only in SDs. In ectopic expression lines, transcript levels of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a were increased, but those of OsGI and Hd1 remained the same. These results indicate that OsMADS51 is a flowering promoter, particularly in SDs, and that this gene functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a. To further investigate the relationship with other flowering promoters, we generated transgenic plants in which expression of Ehd1 or OsGI was suppressed. In Ehd1 RNA interference plants, OsMADS51 expression was not affected, supporting our conclusion that the MADS-box gene functions upstream of Ehd1. However, in OsGI antisense plants, the OsMADS51 transcript level was reduced. In addition, the circadian expression pattern for this MADS-box gene was similar to that for OsGI. These results demonstrate that OsMADS51 functions downstream of OsGI. In summary, OsMADS51 is a novel flowering promoter that transmits a SD promotion signal from OsGI to Ehd1.
Plant Physiol.-2014-Choi-pp.113.228049.pdf	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	2014	Plant Physiol	Crop Biotech Institute, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 446-701, Korea.	Trithorax group proteins are chromatin-remodeling factors that activate target gene expression by antagonistically functioning against the Polycomb group. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), Arabidopsis Trithorax protein1 (ATX1) regulates flowering time and floral organ identity. Here, we observed that suppression of Oryza sativa Trithorax1 (OsTrx1), an ortholog of ATX1, delayed flowering time in rice (Oryza sativa). Because the delay occurred only under long-day conditions, we evaluated the flowering signal pathways that specifically function under long-day conditions. Among them, the OsMADS50 and Heading date1 pathways were not affected by the mutation. However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1. Transcript levels of OsGI, phytochrome genes, and Early heading date3 (Ehd3), which function upstream of Ghd7, were unchanged in the mutant. Because Trx group proteins form a complex with other proteins to modify the chromatin structure of target genes, we investigated whether OsTrx1 interacts with a previously identified protein that functions upstream of Ghd7. We demonstrated that the plant homeodomain motif of OsTrx1 binds to native histone H3 from the calf thymus and that OsTrx1 binds to Ehd3 through the region between the plant homeodomain and SET domains. Finally, we showed that the SET domain at the C-terminal end of OsTrx1 has histone H3 methyltransferase activity when incubated with oligonucleosomes. Our results suggest that OsTrx1 plays an important role in regulating flowering time in rice by modulating chromatin structure.
psb-6-1932.pdf	A study of phytohormone biosynthetic gene expression using a circadian clock-related mutant in rice	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Functional Plant Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Japan.	We have recently isolated a rice circadian clock-related mutant carrying a null mutation in Os-GIGANTEA(GI) gene, the solo ortholog of Arabidopsis GI. Time-course global transcriptome analyses of leaves from wild-type and osgi mutant grown in the field have revealed that Os-GI affects gene expression of more than half of genes on rice 44k microarray. To better understand the biological significance of circadian clock function in growth and development of rice, we here investigated the gene expression involved in phytohormone biosynthesis. Here we found that mRNA levels of a few major genes encoding GA2-oxidase which can inactivate bioactive gibberellins (GAs) were remarkably increased in osgi-1 plants. This suggests that Os-GI functions to maintain bioactive GA level through the regulation of the GA-deactivating enzyme genes in rice. Consistently, osgi-1 plants showed semi-dwarf phenotype with reduced internode and leaf sheath elongation.
NA	Mutation of OsGIGANTEA Leads to Enhanced Tolerance to Polyethylene Glycol-Generated Osmotic Stress in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang UniversityHangzhou, China; College of Life Sciences, Qingdao Agricultural UniversityQingdao, China.	Water deficit is one of the most important environmental stresses limiting plant growth and crop yield. While the identification of many key factors involved in the plant water deficit response has greatly increased our knowledge about the regulation system, the mechanisms underlying dehydration tolerance in plants are still not well understood. In our current study, we investigated the roles of the key flowering time regulator, OsGIGANTEA (OsGI), in the osmotic stress tolerance in rice. Results showed that mutation of OsGI conferred tolerance to osmotic stress generated by polyethylene glycol (PEG), increased proline and sucrose contents, and accelerated stomata movement. In addition, qRT-PCR and microarray analysis revealed that the transcript abundance of some osmotic stress response genes, such as OsDREB1E, OsAP37, OsAP59, OsLIP9, OsLEA3, OsRAB16A, and OsSalT, was significantly higher in osgi than in WT plants, suggesting that OsGI might be a negative regulator in the osmotic stress response in rice.
NA	Nitrogen Mediates Flowering Time and Nitrogen Use Efficiency via Floral Regulators in Rice	2020	Curr Biol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	High nitrogen (N) fertilization for maximizing crop yield commonly leads to postponed flowering time (heading date in rice) and ripening, thus affecting resources use efficiency and followed planting time. We found that N-mediated heading date-1 (Nhd1) can directly activate florigen gene OsHd3a in rice. Inactivation of either Nhd1 or OsHd3a results in delay and insensitivity to N supply of flowering time. Knockout of Nhd1 increases N uptake and utilization efficiency at low-to-moderate N level under both short- and long-day field conditions. Increasing glutamine, the product of N assimilation, can upregulate expression of Nhd1, which in turn downregulates OsFd-GOGAT expression and OsFd-GOGAT activity, displaying a Nhd1-controlled negative feedback regulatory pathway of N assimilation. Moreover, N fertilization effect on rice flowering time shows genetically controlled diversity, and single-nucleotide polymorphism in Nhd1 promoter may relate to different responses of flowering time to N application. Nhd1 thus balances flowering time and N use efficiency in addition to photoperiod in rice.
NA	Clock component OsPRR73 positively regulates rice salt tolerance by modulating OsHKT2;1-mediated sodium homeostasis	2020	EMBO J	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	The roles of clock components in salt stress tolerance remain incompletely characterized in rice. Here, we show that, among OsPRR (Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator) family members, OsPRR73 specifically confers salt tolerance in rice. Notably, the grain size and yield of osprr73 null mutants were significantly decreased in the presence of salt stress, with accumulated higher level of reactive oxygen species and sodium ions. RNA sequencing and biochemical assays identified OsHKT2;1, encoding a plasma membrane-localized Na+ transporter, as a transcriptional target of OsPRR73 in mediating salt tolerance. Correspondingly, null mutants of OsHKT2;1 displayed an increased tolerance to salt stress. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays further identified HDAC10 as nuclear interactor of OsPRR73 and co-repressor of OsHKT2;1. Consistently, H3K9ac histone marks at OsHKT2;1 promoter regions were significantly reduced in osprr73 mutant. Together, our findings reveal that salt-induced OsPRR73 expression confers salt tolerance by recruiting HDAC10 to transcriptionally repress OsHKT2;1, thus reducing cellular Na+ accumulation. This exemplifies a new molecular link between clock components and salt stress tolerance in rice.
NA	Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant. In addition to serving as a model plant for molecular genetic studies of monocots, rice is a staple crop for about half of the world population. Heading date is a critical agronomic trait, and many genes controlling heading date have been cloned during the last two decades. The mechanism of flowering in rice from recognition of day length by leaves to floral activation in the shoot apical meristem has been extensively studied. In this review, we summarize current progress on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice with emphasis on post-translational modifications of key regulators, including Heading Date 1 (Hd1), Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Grain Number, Plant Height, and Heading Date7 (Ghd7). The contribution of heading date genes to heterosis and the expansion of rice cultivation areas from low-latitude to high-latitude regions are also discussed. To overcome limitations of diverse genetic backgrounds used in heading date studies and to gain a clearer understanding of flowering in rice, we propose a systematic collection of genetic resources in a common genetic background. Strategies in breeding adapted cultivars by rational design are also discussed.
NA	OsRRM, an RNA-Binding Protein, Modulates Sugar Transport in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	2020	Front Plant Sci	Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Key Laboratory of Crop Genomics and Molecular Breeding of Jiangsu Province, Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology of Jiangsu Province, College of Agriculture, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.	Sugar allocation between vegetative and reproductive tissues is vital to plant development, and sugar transporters play fundamental roles in this process. Although several transcription factors have been identified that control their transcription levels, the way in which the expression of sugar transporter genes is controlled at the posttranscriptional level is unknown. In this study, we showed that OsRRM, an RNA-binding protein, modulates sugar allocation in tissues on the source-to-sink route. The OsRRM expression pattern partly resembles that of several sugar transporter and transcription factor genes that specifically affect sugar transporter gene expression. The messenger RNA levels of almost all of the sugar transporter genes are severely reduced in the osrrm mutant, and this alters sugar metabolism and sugar signaling, which further affects plant height, flowering time, seed size, and starch synthesis. We further showed that OsRRM binds directly to messenger RNAs encoded by sugar transporter genes and thus may stabilize their transcripts. Therefore, we have uncovered the physiological function of OsRRM, which sheds new light on sugar metabolism and sugar signaling.
NA	The transcriptional repressor OsPRR73 links circadian clock and photoperiod pathway to control heading date in rice	2020	Plant Cell Environ	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	The phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is triggered by internal and external signals that participate in circadian clock in plants. We identified a rice floral inhibitor OsPRR73 encoding a CONSTANS protein. Overexpression of OsPRR73 resulted in late heading under both long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) conditions. Knockout mutants led to early heading under LD conditions but no change under SD. OsPRR73 mRNA accumulated at noon and exhibited a robust oscillation under constant light (LL) and constant darkness (DD) conditions. OsPRR73 overexpression exerted negative feedback on endogenous OsPRR73 expression and altered diurnal expressions of key flowering genes and circadian clock genes. OsPRR73 bound to the promoters of the floral gene Ehd1 and the circadian gene OsLHY, and significantly suppressed their expression at dawn. In LL and DD, the oscillatory patterns of the circadian genes OsLHY, OsTOC1, OsGI and OsELF3 were varied in OsPRR73OX and osprr73 mutants. OsPRR73 expression was decreased in osphyb mutants, and overexpression of OsPRR73 complemented the early heading date phenotype of osphyb, indicating OsPRR73 works downstream of OsPhyB. Therefore, OsPRR73 is involved in a feedback loop of the rice clock and connects the photoperiod flowering pathway by binding to the Ehd1 promoter in rice.
