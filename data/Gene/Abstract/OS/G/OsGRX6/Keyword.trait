OsGRX6	nitrogen	Overexpression of the CC-type glutaredoxin, OsGRX6 affects hormone and nitrogen status in rice plants.	Overexpression of the CC-type glutaredoxin, OsGRX6 affects hormone and nitrogen status in rice plants.
OsGRX6	nitrogen	Overexpression of the CC-type glutaredoxin, OsGRX6 affects hormone and nitrogen status in rice plants.	 The OsGRX6 overexpressors contain a higher nitrogen content than the wild type, indicating that OsGRX6 plays a role in homeostatic regulation of nitrogen use
OsGRX6	nitrogen	Overexpression of the CC-type glutaredoxin, OsGRX6 affects hormone and nitrogen status in rice plants.	 These data suggest that OsGRX6 affects hormone signaling and nitrogen status in rice plants
OsGRX6	senescence	Overexpression of the CC-type glutaredoxin, OsGRX6 affects hormone and nitrogen status in rice plants.	 Consistent with this, OsGRX6 overexpressors displayed delayed chlorophyll degradation and senescence compared to the wild type plants
OsGRX6	nitrate	Overexpression of the CC-type glutaredoxin, OsGRX6 affects hormone and nitrogen status in rice plants.	 The rice CC-type proteins, OsGRX6 was identified during the screening for genes whose expression changes depending on the level of available nitrate
