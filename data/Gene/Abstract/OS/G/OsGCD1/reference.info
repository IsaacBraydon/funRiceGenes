NA	OsGCD1 is essential for rice fertility and required for embryo dorsal-ventral pattern formation and endosperm development.	2017	New Phytol	College of Life Science, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.	Rice fertility is critical for rice reproduction and is thus a focus of interest. Most studies have addressed male sterility and its relation to rice production. The mechanisms of regulation of embryogenesis and endosperm development are essential for rice reproduction, but remain largely unknown. Here, we report a functional analysis of the rice gene OsGCD1, which encodes a highly conserved homolog of Arabidopsis GCD1 (GAMETE CELLS DEFECTIVE1). OsGCD1 mutants were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and subjected to functional analysis. The homozygote mutants cannot be obtained, whereas heterozygotes showed altered phenotypes. In the majority of aborted seeds, the endosperm nucleus divided a limited number of times. The free nuclei were distributed only at the micropylar end of embryo sacs, and their oriented positioning was blocked. In addition, aleurone differentiation was interrupted. The embryo developed slowly, and pattern formation, particularly the dorsal-ventral pattern and symmetry establishment, of embryos was disturbed. Thus, the embryos showed various morphological and structural dysplasias. Our findings reveal that OsGCD1 is essential for rice fertility and is required for dorsal-ventral pattern formation and endosperm free nucleus positioning, suggesting a critical role in sexual reproduction of both monocotyledon and dicotyledon plants.
NA	The stereotyped positioning of the generative cell associated with vacuole dynamics is not required for male gametogenesis in rice pollen.	2018	New Phytol	College of Life Science, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.	During male gametogenesis in cereals, the generative cell undergoes a positioning process that parallels the dynamics of the central vacuole, which is believed to be associated with generative cell movement in the male gametophyte. However, the impact of the generative cell positioning and the central vacuole dynamics on male gametogenesis has remained poorly understood. Here, we report that OsGCD1 (GAMETE CELLS DEFECTIVE1) dysfunction influenced pollen development and disrupted pollen germination. Loss of function of OsGCD1 altered the central vacuole dynamics and the generative cell was mispositioned. Nevertheless, twin sperm cells were generated normally, indicating that gametogenesis does not rely on positional information as long as a generative cell is produced. The normal vacuole dynamics seems necessary only for pollen maturation and germination. Our findings also indicate that osgcd1 mutation resulted in rice male sterility in which pollen has full cell viability and generated normal gametes, but lacks the potential to germinate.
