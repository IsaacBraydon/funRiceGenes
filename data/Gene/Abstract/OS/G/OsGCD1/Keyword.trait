OsGCD1	endosperm	OsGCD1 is essential for rice fertility and required for embryo dorsal-ventral pattern formation and endosperm development.	OsGCD1 is essential for rice fertility and required for embryo dorsal-ventral pattern formation and endosperm development.
OsGCD1	endosperm	OsGCD1 is essential for rice fertility and required for embryo dorsal-ventral pattern formation and endosperm development.	 Our findings reveal that OsGCD1 is essential for rice fertility and is required for dorsal-ventral pattern formation and endosperm free nucleus positioning, suggesting a critical role in sexual reproduction of both monocotyledon and dicotyledon plants
OsGCD1	nucleus	OsGCD1 is essential for rice fertility and required for embryo dorsal-ventral pattern formation and endosperm development.	 Our findings reveal that OsGCD1 is essential for rice fertility and is required for dorsal-ventral pattern formation and endosperm free nucleus positioning, suggesting a critical role in sexual reproduction of both monocotyledon and dicotyledon plants
OsGCD1	fertility	OsGCD1 is essential for rice fertility and required for embryo dorsal-ventral pattern formation and endosperm development.	OsGCD1 is essential for rice fertility and required for embryo dorsal-ventral pattern formation and endosperm development.
OsGCD1	fertility	OsGCD1 is essential for rice fertility and required for embryo dorsal-ventral pattern formation and endosperm development.	 Our findings reveal that OsGCD1 is essential for rice fertility and is required for dorsal-ventral pattern formation and endosperm free nucleus positioning, suggesting a critical role in sexual reproduction of both monocotyledon and dicotyledon plants
OsGCD1	endosperm development	OsGCD1 is essential for rice fertility and required for embryo dorsal-ventral pattern formation and endosperm development.	OsGCD1 is essential for rice fertility and required for embryo dorsal-ventral pattern formation and endosperm development.
OsGCD1	pollen	The stereotyped positioning of the generative cell associated with vacuole dynamics is not required for male gametogenesis in rice pollen.	 Here, we report that OsGCD1 (GAMETE CELLS DEFECTIVE1) dysfunction influenced pollen development and disrupted pollen germination
OsGCD1	pollen	The stereotyped positioning of the generative cell associated with vacuole dynamics is not required for male gametogenesis in rice pollen.	 Our findings also indicate that osgcd1 mutation resulted in rice male sterility in which pollen has full cell viability and generated normal gametes, but lacks the potential to germinate
OsGCD1	sterility	The stereotyped positioning of the generative cell associated with vacuole dynamics is not required for male gametogenesis in rice pollen.	 Our findings also indicate that osgcd1 mutation resulted in rice male sterility in which pollen has full cell viability and generated normal gametes, but lacks the potential to germinate
OsGCD1	development	The stereotyped positioning of the generative cell associated with vacuole dynamics is not required for male gametogenesis in rice pollen.	 Here, we report that OsGCD1 (GAMETE CELLS DEFECTIVE1) dysfunction influenced pollen development and disrupted pollen germination
