Gibberellins (GAs) and brassinosteroids (BRs), two growth-promoting phytohormones, regulate many common physiological processes. Their interactions at the molecular level remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that OsGSR1, a member of the GAST (GA-stimulated transcript) gene family, is induced by GA and repressed by BR. RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic rice plants with reduced OsGSR1 expression show phenotypes similar to plants deficient in BR, including short primary roots, erect leaves and reduced fertility. The OsGSR1 RNAi transgenic rice shows a reduced level of endogenous BR, and the dwarf phenotype could be rescued by the application of brassinolide. The yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that OsGSR1 interacts with DIM/DWF1, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion from 24-methylenecholesterol to campesterol in BR biosynthesis. These results suggest that OsGSR1 activates BR synthesis by directly regulating a BR biosynthetic enzyme at the post-translational level. Furthermore, OsGSR1 RNAi plants show a reduced sensitivity to GA treatment, an increased expression of the GA biosynthetic gene OsGA20ox2, which is feedback inhibited by GA signaling, and an elevated level of endogenous GA: together, these suggest that OsGSR1 is a positive regulator of GA signaling. These results demonstrate that OsGSR1 plays important roles in both BR and GA pathways, and also mediates an interaction between the two signaling pathways.
NA	A quantitative trait locus GW6 controls rice grain size and yield through the gibberellin pathway.	2020	Plant J	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, CAS Centre for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences and Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics & Development, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Chinese Academic of Sciences, Shanghai, 200032, China.	Grain size is one of the essential components determining rice yield and a target for both domestication and artificial breeding. Gibberellins (GAs) are diterpenoid phytohormones influencing diverse aspects of plant growth and development. Several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been identified to control grain size through phytohormone regulation. However, little is known about the role of GAs in the control of grain size. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a QTL, GW6 (GRAIN WIDTH 6), which encodes a gibberellin-regulated GAST family protein and positively regulates grain width and weight. GW6 is highly expressed in the young panicle and increases grain width by promoting cell expansion in the spikelet hull. The knockout of GW6 exhibits reduced grain size and weight, whereas the overexpression of GW6 results in increased grain size and weight. GW6 is induced by GA and its knockout down-regulates the expression of GA biosynthesis genes and decreases GA contents in the young panicle. We found that a natural variation in the cis element CAAT-box in the promoter of GW6 is associated with its expression level and grain width and weight. Furthermore, introduction of GW6 to an O. indica variety HJX74 can lead to a 10.44% increase in rice grain yield, indicating that GW6 has great potential to improve grain yield in rice.
