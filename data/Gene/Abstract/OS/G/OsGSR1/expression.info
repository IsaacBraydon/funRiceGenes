OsGSR1|GW6	 The knockout of GW6 exhibits reduced grain size and weight, whereas the overexpression of GW6 results in increased grain size and weight |  GW6 is induced by GA and its knockout down-regulates the expression of GA biosynthesis genes and decreases GA contents in the young panicle |  We found that a natural variation in the cis element CAAT-box in the promoter of GW6 is associated with its expression level and grain width and weight	 The knockout of GW6 exhibits reduced grain size and weight, whereas the overexpression of GW6 results in increased grain size and weight
