OsGSR1|GW6	 BR 	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice	The yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that OsGSR1 interacts with DIM/DWF1, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion from 24-methylenecholesterol to campesterol in BR biosynthesis
OsGSR1|GW6	 BR 	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice	These results suggest that OsGSR1 activates BR synthesis by directly regulating a BR biosynthetic enzyme at the post-translational level
OsGSR1|GW6	 BR 	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice	These results demonstrate that OsGSR1 plays important roles in both BR and GA pathways, and also mediates an interaction between the two signaling pathways
OsGSR1|GW6	root	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice	RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic rice plants with reduced OsGSR1 expression show phenotypes similar to plants deficient in BR, including short primary roots, erect leaves and reduced fertility
OsGSR1|GW6	brassinosteroid	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice
OsGSR1|GW6	 ga 	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice	Here, we demonstrate that OsGSR1, a member of the GAST (GA-stimulated transcript) gene family, is induced by GA and repressed by BR
OsGSR1|GW6	 ga 	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice	Furthermore, OsGSR1 RNAi plants show a reduced sensitivity to GA treatment, an increased expression of the GA biosynthetic gene OsGA20ox2, which is feedback inhibited by GA signaling, and an elevated level of endogenous GA: together, these suggest that OsGSR1 is a positive regulator of GA signaling
OsGSR1|GW6	 ga 	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice	These results demonstrate that OsGSR1 plays important roles in both BR and GA pathways, and also mediates an interaction between the two signaling pathways
OsGSR1|GW6	fertility	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice	RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic rice plants with reduced OsGSR1 expression show phenotypes similar to plants deficient in BR, including short primary roots, erect leaves and reduced fertility
OsGSR1|GW6	ethylene	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice	The yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that OsGSR1 interacts with DIM/DWF1, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion from 24-methylenecholesterol to campesterol in BR biosynthesis
OsGSR1|GW6	dwarf	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice	The OsGSR1 RNAi transgenic rice shows a reduced level of endogenous BR, and the dwarf phenotype could be rescued by the application of brassinolide
OsGSR1|GW6	primary root	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice	RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic rice plants with reduced OsGSR1 expression show phenotypes similar to plants deficient in BR, including short primary roots, erect leaves and reduced fertility
OsGSR1|GW6	gibberellin	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice
OsGSR1|GW6	erect	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice	RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic rice plants with reduced OsGSR1 expression show phenotypes similar to plants deficient in BR, including short primary roots, erect leaves and reduced fertility
