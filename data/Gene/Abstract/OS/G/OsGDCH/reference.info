Glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC) is a multi-protein complex, comprising P-, H-, T- and L-protein subunits, which plays a major role in photorespiration in plants. While structural analysis has demonstrated that the H subunit of GDC (GDCH) plays a pivotal role in GDC, research on the role of GDCH in biological processes in plants is seldom reported. Here, the function of GDCH, stresses resulting from GDCH-knockdown and the interactions of these stresses with other cellular processes were studied in rice plants. Under high CO(2), the OsGDCH RNA interference (OsGDCH-RNAi) plants grew normally, but under ambient CO(2), severely suppressed OsGDCH-RNAi plants (SSPs) were non-viable, which displayed a photorespiration-deficient phenotype. Under ambient CO(2), chlorophyll loss, protein degradation, lipid peroxidation and photosynthesis decline occurred in SSPs. Electron microscopy studies showed that chloroplast breakdown and autophagy took place in these plants. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), including O2(-) and H(2)O(2), accumulated and the antioxidant enzyme activities decreased in the leaves of SSPs under ambient CO(2). The expression of transcription factors and senescence-associated genes (SAGs), which was up-regulated in SSPs after transfer to ambient CO(2), was enhanced in wild-type plants treated with H(2)O(2). Evidences demonstrate ROS induce senescence in SSPs, and transcription factors OsWRKY72 may mediate the ROS-induced senescence.
NA	Targeted Knockdown of GDCH in Rice Leads to a Photorespiratory-Deficient Phenotype Useful as a Building Block for C4 Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	C4 Rice Center, International Rice Research Institute, Los Ba√±os, Philippines These authors contributed equally to this work.	The glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC) plays a critical role in the photorespiratory C2cycle of C3species by recovering carbon following the oxygenation reaction of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. Loss of GDC from mesophyll cells (MCs) is considered a key early step in the evolution of C4photosynthesis. To assess the impact of preferentially reducing GDC in rice MCs, we decreased the abundance ofOsGDCH(Os10g37180) using an artificial microRNA (amiRNA) driven by a promoter that preferentially drives expression in MCs. GDC H- and P-proteins were undetectable in leaves ofgdchlines. Plants exhibited a photorespiratory-deficient phenotype with stunted growth, accelerated leaf senescence, reduced chlorophyll, soluble protein and sugars, and increased glycine accumulation in leaves. Gas exchange measurements indicated an impaired ability to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate in photorespiratory conditions. In addition, MCs ofgdchlines exhibited a significant reduction in chloroplast area and coverage of the cell wall when grown in air, traits that occur during the later stages of C4evolution. The presence of these two traits important for C4photosynthesis and the non-lethal, down-regulation of the photorespiratory C2cycle positively contribute to efforts to produce a C4rice prototype.
