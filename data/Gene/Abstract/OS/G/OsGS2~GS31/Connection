OsGS|OsGS1|GS1|OsGS1;1|OsGLN1;1	OsGS2|lambdaGS31	Regulation of glutamine synthetase isoforms in two differentially drought-tolerant rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars under water deficit conditions	OsGS1;1 and OsGS2 were differentially regulated in IR-64 (drought-sensitive) and Khitish (drought-tolerant) cultivars of rice
OsGS|OsGS1|GS1|OsGS1;1|OsGLN1;1	OsGS2|lambdaGS31	Regulation of glutamine synthetase isoforms in two differentially drought-tolerant rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars under water deficit conditions	Rice plants possess one gene (OsGS2) for chloroplastic GS2 and three genes (OsGS1;1, OsGS1;2 and OsGS1;3) for cytosolic GS1
OsGS|OsGS1|GS1|OsGS1;1|OsGLN1;1	OsGS2|lambdaGS31	Regulation of glutamine synthetase isoforms in two differentially drought-tolerant rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars under water deficit conditions	Results suggest that OsGS2 and OsGS1;1 expression may contribute to drought tolerance of Khitish cultivar under WD conditions
OsGDH2	OsGS2|lambdaGS31	Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Salt stress clearly up-regulated the expression of OsGDH2 and OsGDH3 in old leaves, while strongly down-regulated expression of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves
OsCV	OsGS2|lambdaGS31	Delaying chloroplast turnover increases water-deficit stress tolerance through the enhancement of nitrogen assimilation in rice.	 Co-immunoprecipitation, intracellular co-localization, and bimolecular fluorescence demonstrated the in vivo interaction between OsCV and chloroplastic glutamine synthetase (OsGS2), affecting source-sink relationships of the plants under stress
GS2|OsGRF4|GL2|GLW2|LGS1	OsGS2|lambdaGS31	Concurrent Overexpression of OsGS1;1 and OsGS2 Genes in Transgenic Rice (Oryza sativa L.): Impact on Tolerance to Abiotic Stresses.	 In this study, we investigated the effect of concurrent overexpression of the rice cytosolic GS1 (OsGS1;1) and chloroplastic GS2 (OsGS2) genes in transgenic rice on its tolerance to abiotic stresses and the herbicide Glufosinate

Our results demonstrate that the co-overexpression of OsGS1;1 and OsGS2 isoforms in transgenic rice plants enhanced its tolerance to osmotic and salinity stress at the seedling stage
OsGS|OsGS1|GS1|OsGS1;1|OsGLN1;1	OsGS2|lambdaGS31	Concurrent Overexpression of OsGS1;1 and OsGS2 Genes in Transgenic Rice (Oryza sativa L.): Impact on Tolerance to Abiotic Stresses.	 Taken together, our results demonstrate that the concurrent overexpression of OsGS1;1 and OsGS2 isoforms in rice enhanced physiological tolerance and agronomic performance under adverse abiotic stress conditions, apparently acting through multiple mechanistic routes
OsGS|OsGS1|GS1|OsGS1;1|OsGLN1;1	OsGS2|lambdaGS31	Rice plants have three homologs of glutathione synthetase genes, one of which, OsGS2, codes for hydroxymethyl-glutathione synthetase.	 We isolated three rice glutathione synthetase homologs, designated OsGS1, OsGS2, and OsGS3, and found that knockdown of OsGS2 via RNA interference markedly decreased hydroxymethyl-glutathione concentration in rice plants
OsGS2|lambdaGS31	OsGS3	Rice plants have three homologs of glutathione synthetase genes, one of which, OsGS2, codes for hydroxymethyl-glutathione synthetase.	 We isolated three rice glutathione synthetase homologs, designated OsGS1, OsGS2, and OsGS3, and found that knockdown of OsGS2 via RNA interference markedly decreased hydroxymethyl-glutathione concentration in rice plants
