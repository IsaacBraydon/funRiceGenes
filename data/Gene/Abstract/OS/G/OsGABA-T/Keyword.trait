OsGABA-T	blast	Molecular cloning and differential expression of an gamma-aminobutyrate transaminase gene, OsGABA-T, in rice (Oryza sativa) leaves infected with blast fungus	OsGABA-T expression is induced by blast fungus infection, mechanical wounding and ultraviolet radiation in rice leaves and is not detected in normal rice organs
OsGABA-T	blast	Molecular cloning and differential expression of an gamma-aminobutyrate transaminase gene, OsGABA-T, in rice (Oryza sativa) leaves infected with blast fungus	Molecular cloning and differential expression of an gamma-aminobutyrate transaminase gene, OsGABA-T, in rice (Oryza sativa) leaves infected with blast fungus
OsGABA-T	cell death	Molecular cloning and differential expression of an gamma-aminobutyrate transaminase gene, OsGABA-T, in rice (Oryza sativa) leaves infected with blast fungus	Our data suggest that OsGABA-T (GABA shunt) may play a role in restricting the levels of cell death during the host-pathogen interaction
