OsGRX8	abiotic stress	Modified expression of an auxin-responsive rice CC-type glutaredoxin gene affects multiple abiotic stress responses	Here, we report the role of a CC-type GRX gene from rice, OsGRX8, in abiotic stress tolerance
OsGRX8	abiotic stress	Modified expression of an auxin-responsive rice CC-type glutaredoxin gene affects multiple abiotic stress responses	Further, the transgenic RNAi rice plants exhibited increased susceptibility to various abiotic stresses, which further confirmed the role of OsGRX8 in abiotic stress responses
OsGRX8	abiotic stress	Modified expression of an auxin-responsive rice CC-type glutaredoxin gene affects multiple abiotic stress responses	Altogether, these findings suggest the role of OsGRX8 in regulating abiotic stress response and may be used to engineer stress tolerance in crop plants
OsGRX8	auxin	Modified expression of an auxin-responsive rice CC-type glutaredoxin gene affects multiple abiotic stress responses	OsGRX8 protein was found to be localized in nucleus and cytosol and its gene expression is induced by various stress conditions and plant hormone auxin
OsGRX8	auxin	Modified expression of an auxin-responsive rice CC-type glutaredoxin gene affects multiple abiotic stress responses	The over-expression of OsGRX8 in Arabidopsis plants conferred reduced sensitivity to auxin and stress hormone, abscisic acid
