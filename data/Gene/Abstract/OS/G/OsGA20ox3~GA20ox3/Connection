DCM1|SAW1	OsGA20ox3|GA20ox3	A novel CCCH-type zinc-finger protein SAW1 activates OsGA20ox3 to regulate gibberellin homeostasis and anther development in rice.	 SAW1 encodes a novel nucleus-localizing CCCH-tandem zinc finger protein, and this protein could directly bind to the promoter region of the GA synthesis gene OsGA20ox3 to induce its anther-specific expression
DCM1|SAW1	OsGA20ox3|GA20ox3	A novel CCCH-type zinc-finger protein SAW1 activates OsGA20ox3 to regulate gibberellin homeostasis and anther development in rice.	 In the saw1 anther, the significantly decreased OsGA20ox3 expression resulted in lower bioactive GA content, which in turn caused the lower expression of the GA-inducible anther-regulator gene OsGAMYB
