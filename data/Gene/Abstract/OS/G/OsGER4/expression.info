OsGER4	 A subsequent genome-wide association study and gene expression analyses pinpointed a strong association between the Germin-like protein OsGER4 and the increase in CR number under exogenous JA treatment |  Notable changes in OsGER4 expression patterns caused by the polar auxin transport inhibitor NPA support its connection to auxin signaling
OsGER4	 Using the GUS promoter line, OsGER4 expression was detected in the epidermis of the crown root primordial, in the stele of the crown root, and subsequently in the primordial of the lateral root
