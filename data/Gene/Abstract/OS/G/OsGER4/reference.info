NA	The Germin-like protein OsGER4 is involved in promoting crown root development under exogenous jasmonic acid treatment in rice.	2022	Plant J	University of Science and Technology of Hanoi, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, 18 Hoang Quoc Viet, Cau Giay, Hanoi, 100000, Vietnam.	In rice (Oryza sativa L.), crown roots (CRs) have many important roles in processes such as root system expansion, water and mineral uptake, and adaptation to environmental stresses. Phytohormones such as auxin, cytokinin, and ethylene are known to control CR initiation and development in rice. However, the role of jasmonic acid (JA) in CR development remained elusive. Here, we report that JA promotes CR development by regulating OsGER4, a rice Germin-like protein. Root phenotyping analysis revealed that exogenous JA treatment induced an increase in CR number in a concentration-dependent manner. A subsequent genome-wide association study and gene expression analyses pinpointed a strong association between the Germin-like protein OsGER4 and the increase in CR number under exogenous JA treatment. The ProGER4::GUS reporter line showed that OsGER4 is a hormone-responsive gene involved in various stress responses, mainly confined to epidermal and vascular tissues during CR primordia development and to vascular bundles of mature crown and lateral roots. Notable changes in OsGER4 expression patterns caused by the polar auxin transport inhibitor NPA support its connection to auxin signaling. Phenotyping experiments with OsGER4 knockout mutants confirmed that this gene is required for CR development under exogenous JA treatment. Overall, our results provide important insights into JA-mediated regulation of CR development in rice.
NA	The Germin-like protein gene OsGER4 is involved in heat stress response in rice root development.	2023	Funct Integr Genomics	University of Science and Technology of Hanoi, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology. 100000, Hanoi, Vietnam.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important dietary carbohydrate sources for half of the world&#x27;s population. However, it is not well adapted to environmental stress conditions, necessitating to create new and improved varieties to help ensure sufficient rice production in the face of rising populations and shrinking arable land. Recently, the development of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system has allowed researchers to study functional genomics and engineer new rice varieties with great efficiency compared to conventional methods. In this study, we investigate the involvement of OsGER4, a germin-like protein identified by a genome-wide association study that is associated with rice root development under a stress hormone jasmonic acids treatment. Analysis of the OsGER4 promoter region revealed a series of regulatory elements that connect this gene to ABA signaling and water stress response. Under heat stress, osger4 mutant lines produce a significantly lower crown root than wild-type Kitaake rice. The loss of OsGER4 also led to the reduction of lateral root development. Using the GUS promoter line, OsGER4 expression was detected in the epidermis of the crown root primordial, in the stele of the crown root, and subsequently in the primordial of the lateral root. Taken together, these results illustrated the involvement of OsGER4 in root development under heat stress by regulating auxin transport through plasmodesmata, under control by both ABA and auxin signaling.
