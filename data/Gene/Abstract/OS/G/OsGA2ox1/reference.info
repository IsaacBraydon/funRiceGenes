Gibberellin (GA) 2-oxidase plays a key role in the GA catabolic pathway through 2beta-hydroxylation. In the present study, we isolated a CaMV 35S-enhancer activation tagged mutant, H032. This mutant exhibited a dominant dwarf and GA-deficient phenotype, with a final stature that was less than half of its wild-type counterpart. The endogenous bioactive GAs are markedly decreased in the H032 mutant, and application of bioactive GAs (GA(3) or GA(4)) can reverse the dwarf phenotype. The integrated T-DNA was detected 12.8 kb upstream of the OsGA2ox6 in the H032 genome by TAIL-PCR. An increased level of OsGA2ox6 mRNA was detected at a high level in the H032 mutant, which might be due to the enhancer role of the CaMV 35S promoter. RNAi and ectopic expression analysis of OsGA2ox6 indicated that the dwarf trait and the decreased levels of bioactive GAs in the H032 mutant were a result of the up-regulation of the OsGA2ox6 gene. BLASTP analysis revealed that OsGA2ox6 belongs to the class III of GA 2-oxidases, which is a novel type of GA2ox that uses C20-GAs (GA(12) and/or GA(53)) as the substrates. Interestingly, we found that a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, paclobutrazol, positively regulated the OsGA2ox6 gene. Unlike the over-expression of OsGA2ox1, which led to a high rate of seed abortion, the H032 mutant retained normal flowering and seed production. These results indicate that OsGA2ox6 mainly affects plant stature, and the dominant dwarf trait of the H032 mutant can be used as an efficient dwarf resource in rice breeding.
cr200828a.pdf	Gibberellin homeostasis and plant height control by EUI and a role for gibberellin in root gravity responses in rice	2008	Cell Res	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 300 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, China.	The rice Eui (ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE) gene encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that deactivates bioactive gibberellins (GAs). In this study, we investigated controlled expression of the Eui gene and its role in plant development. We found that Eui was differentially induced by exogenous GAs and that the Eui promoter had the highest activity in the vascular bundles. The eui mutant was defective in starch granule development in root caps and Eui overexpression enhanced starch granule generation and gravity responses, revealing a role for GA in root starch granule development and gravity responses. Experiments using embryoless half-seeds revealed that RAmy1A and GAmyb were highly upregulated in eui aleurone cells in the absence of exogenous GA. In addition, the GA biosynthesis genes GA3ox1 and GA20ox2 were downregulated and GA2ox1 was upregulated in eui seedlings. These results indicate that EUI is involved in GA homeostasis, not only in the internodes at the heading stage, but also in the seedling stage, roots and seeds. Disturbing GA homeostasis affected the expression of the GA signaling genes GID1 (GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF 1), GID2 and SLR1. Transgenic RNA interference of the Eui gene effectively increased plant height and improved heading performance. By contrast, the ectopic expression of Eui under the promoters of the rice GA biosynthesis genes GA3ox2 and GA20ox2 significantly reduced plant height. These results demonstrate that a slight increase in Eui expression could dramatically change rice morphology, indicating the practical application of the Eui gene in rice molecular breeding for a high yield potential.
Liu-2011-OsDOG, a gibberellin.pdf	OsDOG, a gibberellin-induced A20/AN1 zinc-finger protein, negatively regulates gibberellin-mediated cell elongation in rice	2011	J Plant Physiol	Research Center for Molecular and Developmental Biology, Key Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Environmental Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	The A20/AN1 zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) play pivotal roles in animal immune responses and plant stress responses. From previous gibberellin (GA) microarray data and A20/AN1 ZFP family member association, we chose Oryza sativa dwarf rice with overexpression of gibberellin-induced gene (OsDOG) to examine its function in the GA pathway. OsDOG was induced by gibberellic acid (GA(3)) and repressed by the GA-synthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol. Different transgenic lines with constitutive expression of OsDOG showed dwarf phenotypes due to deficiency of cell elongation. Additional GA(1) and real-time PCR quantitative assay analyses confirmed that the decrease of GA(1) in the overexpression lines resulted from reduced expression of GA3ox2 and enhanced expression of GA2ox1 and GA2ox3. Adding exogenous GA rescued the constitutive expression phenotypes of the transgenic lines. OsDOG has a novel function in regulating GA homeostasis and in negative maintenance of plant cell elongation in rice.
pp001508.pdf	Expression of a Gibberellin 2-Oxidase Gene around the Shoot Apex Is Related to Phase Transition in Rice	2001	Plant Physiol	Institute of Agriculture and Forestry, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba 305â€<U+393C><U+3E33>8572, Japan	A major catabolic pathway for gibberellin (GA) is initiated by 2Î²-hydroxylation, a reaction catalyzed by GA 2-oxidase. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA, designated Oryza sativa GA 2-oxidase 1 (OsGA2ox1) from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv Nipponbare) that encodes a GA 2-oxidase. The encoded protein, produced by heterologous expression inEscherichia coli, converted GA1, GA4, GA9, GA20, and GA44 to the corresponding 2Î²-hydroxylated products GA8, GA34, GA51, GA29, and GA98, respectively. Ectopic expression of theOsGA2ox1 cDNA in transgenic rice inhibited stem elongation and the development of reproductive organs. These transgenic plants were deficient in endogenous GA1. These results indicate that OsGA2ox1 encodes a GA 2-oxidase, which is functional not only in vitro but also in vivo. OsGA2ox1was expressed in shoot apex and roots but not in leaves and stems. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that OsGA2ox1 mRNA was localized in a ring at the basal region of leaf primordia and young leaves. This ring-shaped expression around the shoot apex was drastically decreased after the phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. It was absent in the floral meristem, but it was still present in the lateral meristem that remained in the vegetative phase. These observations suggest that OsGA2ox1 controls the level of bioactive GAs in the shoot apical meristem; therefore, reduction in its expression may contribute to the early development of the inflorescence meristem.
NA	OsGRF6 interacts with SLR1 to regulate OsGA2ox1 expression for coordinating chilling tolerance and growth in rice	2021	J Plant Physiol	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.	Low temperature is one of the abiotic stressors that affect growth and productivity of rice. The plant hormone gibberellin not only regulates growth and development but is also involved in stress defense. Our rice seedling experiments demonstrated that overexpression of SLR1, a gene that encodes the rice DELLA protein, enhanced chilling tolerance. In contrast, overexpression of the active GA synthesis gene OsGA20ox1 reduced chilling tolerance, indicating that weakening GA signaling promoted plant defense against cold stress. CoIP-MS and BiFC assays showed that SLR1 physically interacted with OsGRF6. After cold treatment and recovery, the survival rates of OsGRF6-overexpression lines and an osgrf6 mutant and its complementary lines indicated that OsGRF6 is a negative regulator of chilling tolerance in rice. The yeast one-hybrid, qRT-PCR, and transactivation assays showed that both SLR1 and OsGRF6 can bind to the promoter of the active GA catabolic gene OsGA2ox1, where SLR1 promoted and OsGRF6 suppressed OsGA2ox1 expression. At normal temperature, OsGRF6 was responsible for maintaining active GA levels by inhibiting OsGA2ox1. When rice seedlings were subjected to chilling stress, the repressive effect of OsGRF6 on OsGA2ox1 was released by cold-induced SLR1, which activated OsGA2ox1 expression to decrease the active GA levels, enhancing chilling tolerance. These results suggest that OsGRF6 is an important regulator in the balance between growth and chilling tolerance in rice.
NA	Orchestration of ethylene and gibberellin signals determines primary root elongation in rice.	2022	Plant Cell	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Primary root growth in cereal crops is fundamental for early establishment of the seedling and grain yield. In young rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings, the primary root grows rapidly for 7-10 days after germination and then stops; however, the underlying mechanism determining primary root growth is unclear. Here, we report that the interplay of ethylene and gibberellin (GA) controls the orchestrated development of the primary root in young rice seedlings. Our analyses advance the knowledge that primary root growth is maintained by higher ethylene production, which lowers bioactive GA contents. Further investigations unraveled that ethylene signaling transcription factor ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE 1 OsEIL1 activates the expression of the GA metabolism genes GIBBERELLIN 2-OXIDASE 2 (OsGA2ox1), OsGA2ox2, OsGA2ox3, and OsGA2ox5, thereby deactivating GA activity, inhibiting cell proliferation in the root meristem, and ultimately gradually inhibiting primary root growth. Mutation in OsGA2ox3 weakened ethylene-induced GA inactivation and reduced the ethylene sensitivity of the root. Genetic analysis revealed that OsGA2ox3 functions downstream of OsEIL1. Taken together, we identify a molecular pathway impacted by ethylene during primary root elongation in rice, and provide insight into the coordination of ethylene and GA signals during root development and seedling establishment.
