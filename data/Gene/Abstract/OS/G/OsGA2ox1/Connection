OsGA2ox1	OsGA3ox1	Gibberellin homeostasis and plant height control by EUI and a role for gibberellin in root gravity responses in rice	In addition, the GA biosynthesis genes GA3ox1 and GA20ox2 were downregulated and GA2ox1 was upregulated in eui seedlings
d18|OsGA3ox2	OsGA2ox1	OsDOG, a gibberellin-induced A20/AN1 zinc-finger protein, negatively regulates gibberellin-mediated cell elongation in rice	Additional GA(1) and real-time PCR quantitative assay analyses confirmed that the decrease of GA(1) in the overexpression lines resulted from reduced expression of GA3ox2 and enhanced expression of GA2ox1 and GA2ox3
GA2OX3|OsGA2OX3	OsGA2ox1	OsDOG, a gibberellin-induced A20/AN1 zinc-finger protein, negatively regulates gibberellin-mediated cell elongation in rice	Additional GA(1) and real-time PCR quantitative assay analyses confirmed that the decrease of GA(1) in the overexpression lines resulted from reduced expression of GA3ox2 and enhanced expression of GA2ox1 and GA2ox3
OsGA2ox1	OsGRF6	OsGRF6 interacts with SLR1 to regulate OsGA2ox1 expression for coordinating chilling tolerance and growth in rice	OsGRF6 interacts with SLR1 to regulate OsGA2ox1 expression for coordinating chilling tolerance and growth in rice
OsGA2ox1	OsGRF6	OsGRF6 interacts with SLR1 to regulate OsGA2ox1 expression for coordinating chilling tolerance and growth in rice	 The yeast one-hybrid, qRT-PCR, and transactivation assays showed that both SLR1 and OsGRF6 can bind to the promoter of the active GA catabolic gene OsGA2ox1, where SLR1 promoted and OsGRF6 suppressed OsGA2ox1 expression
OsGA2ox1	OsGRF6	OsGRF6 interacts with SLR1 to regulate OsGA2ox1 expression for coordinating chilling tolerance and growth in rice	 At normal temperature, OsGRF6 was responsible for maintaining active GA levels by inhibiting OsGA2ox1
OsGA2ox1	OsGRF6	OsGRF6 interacts with SLR1 to regulate OsGA2ox1 expression for coordinating chilling tolerance and growth in rice	 When rice seedlings were subjected to chilling stress, the repressive effect of OsGRF6 on OsGA2ox1 was released by cold-induced SLR1, which activated OsGA2ox1 expression to decrease the active GA levels, enhancing chilling tolerance
