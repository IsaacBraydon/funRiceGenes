OsGLP2-1	 Overexpression of OsGLP2-1 quantitatively enhanced resistance to leaf blast, panicle blast and bacterial blight |  The temporal and spatial expression analysis revealed that OsGLP2-1is highly expressed in leaves and panicles and sub-localized in the cell wall |  Overexpression of OsGLP2-1 induced three well-characterized defense-related genes which are associated in JA-dependent pathway after pathogen infection	 Overexpression of OsGLP2-1 quantitatively enhanced resistance to leaf blast, panicle blast and bacterial blight |  Overexpression of OsGLP2-1 induced three well-characterized defense-related genes which are associated in JA-dependent pathway after pathogen infection
OsGLP2-1	 Using artificial microRNA (miRNA) and CRISPR/CAS9 approaches, suppression of OsGLP2-1 expression in rice resulted in the release of dormancy in immature seeds |  Conversely, overexpression of OsGLP2-1 driven by the OsGLP2-1 native promoter led to greater seed dormancy |  Seed scutellum-specific expression of OsGLP2-1 was increased by exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), but decreased with gibberellic acid (GA) treatment	 Conversely, overexpression of OsGLP2-1 driven by the OsGLP2-1 native promoter led to greater seed dormancy
