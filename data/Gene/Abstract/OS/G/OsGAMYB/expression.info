OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	 <U+2022> Further analysis showed that transcription factor of OsGAMYB was an activator of OsTPP1, and expression of OsGAMYB was decreased by both the exogenous and endogenous ABA, subsequently reduced the expression of OsTPP1, which suggested a new signaling pathway required for seed germination in rice
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	 Using transient dual-luciferase and yeast one-hybrid assays, IPA1 was found to directly activate the expression of OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY71, which would interfere with the binding affinity of GA-induced transcription factor OsGAMYB to inhibit the expression of ¦Á-amylase genes
