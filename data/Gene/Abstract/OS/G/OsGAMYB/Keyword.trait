OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	 ga 	A rice WRKY gene encodes a transcriptional repressor of the gibberellin signaling pathway in aleurone cells	 Mutation of the two W boxes prevents the binding of OsWRKY71 to the mutated promoter, and releases the suppression of the OsGAMYB-activated Amy32b expression by OsWRKY71, suggesting that OsWRKY71 blocks GA signaling by functionally interfering with OsGAMYB
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	anther	Loss-of-function mutations of the rice GAMYB gene impair alpha-amylase expression in aleurone and flower development	 High-level OsGAMYB expression was detected in the aleurone cells, inflorescence shoot apical region, stamen primordia, and tapetum cells of the anther, but only low-level expression occurred in organs at the vegetative stage or in the elongating stem
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	 ga 	Loss-of-function mutations of the rice GAMYB gene impair alpha-amylase expression in aleurone and flower development	 No alpha-amylase expression in the endosperm was induced in these mutants in response to GA treatment, indicating that the Tos17 insertion had knocked out OsGAMYB function
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	tapetum	Loss-of-function mutations of the rice GAMYB gene impair alpha-amylase expression in aleurone and flower development	 High-level OsGAMYB expression was detected in the aleurone cells, inflorescence shoot apical region, stamen primordia, and tapetum cells of the anther, but only low-level expression occurred in organs at the vegetative stage or in the elongating stem
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	inflorescence	Loss-of-function mutations of the rice GAMYB gene impair alpha-amylase expression in aleurone and flower development	 High-level OsGAMYB expression was detected in the aleurone cells, inflorescence shoot apical region, stamen primordia, and tapetum cells of the anther, but only low-level expression occurred in organs at the vegetative stage or in the elongating stem
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	stem	Loss-of-function mutations of the rice GAMYB gene impair alpha-amylase expression in aleurone and flower development	 High-level OsGAMYB expression was detected in the aleurone cells, inflorescence shoot apical region, stamen primordia, and tapetum cells of the anther, but only low-level expression occurred in organs at the vegetative stage or in the elongating stem
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	transcription factor	Two cis-acting elements necessary and sufficient for gibberellin-upregulated proteinase expression in rice seeds	 The sequences were also required for effective transactivation by the transcription factor OsGAMyb
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	endosperm	Loss-of-function mutations of the rice GAMYB gene impair alpha-amylase expression in aleurone and flower development	 No alpha-amylase expression in the endosperm was induced in these mutants in response to GA treatment, indicating that the Tos17 insertion had knocked out OsGAMYB function
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	pollen	Loss-of-function mutations of the rice GAMYB gene impair alpha-amylase expression in aleurone and flower development	 These results demonstrate that, in addition to its role in the induction of alpha-amylase in aleurone, OsGAMYB also is important for floral organ development and essential for pollen development
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	flower	GAMYB controls different sets of genes and is differentially regulated by microRNA in aleurone cells and anthers	 Thus, OsGAMYB and OsGAMYB-like genes are regulated by miR159 in flowers
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	shoot	Loss-of-function mutations of the rice GAMYB gene impair alpha-amylase expression in aleurone and flower development	 High-level OsGAMYB expression was detected in the aleurone cells, inflorescence shoot apical region, stamen primordia, and tapetum cells of the anther, but only low-level expression occurred in organs at the vegetative stage or in the elongating stem
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	vegetative	Loss-of-function mutations of the rice GAMYB gene impair alpha-amylase expression in aleurone and flower development	 High-level OsGAMYB expression was detected in the aleurone cells, inflorescence shoot apical region, stamen primordia, and tapetum cells of the anther, but only low-level expression occurred in organs at the vegetative stage or in the elongating stem
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	stamen	Loss-of-function mutations of the rice GAMYB gene impair alpha-amylase expression in aleurone and flower development	 High-level OsGAMYB expression was detected in the aleurone cells, inflorescence shoot apical region, stamen primordia, and tapetum cells of the anther, but only low-level expression occurred in organs at the vegetative stage or in the elongating stem
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	 ga 	Two cis-acting elements necessary and sufficient for gibberellin-upregulated proteinase expression in rice seeds	 Four copies of either GARE or CARE showed transactivation neither by OsGAMyb nor by GA induction
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	floral	Loss-of-function mutations of the rice GAMYB gene impair alpha-amylase expression in aleurone and flower development	 These results demonstrate that, in addition to its role in the induction of alpha-amylase in aleurone, OsGAMYB also is important for floral organ development and essential for pollen development
