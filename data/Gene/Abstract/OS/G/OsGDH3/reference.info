Abiko-2005-Localization of NAD-.pdf	Localization of NAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase in rice roots: candidates for providing carbon skeletons to NADH-glutamate synthase	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Japan.	In rice roots, transient and cell-type-specific accumulation of both mRNA and protein for NADH-dependent glutamate synthase (NADH-GOGAT) occurs after the supply of NH(4) (+) ions. In order to better understand the origin of 2-oxoglutarate for this reaction, we focused on mitochondrial NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in rice roots. Six rice cDNAs encoding a single catalytic (OsIDHa) and two regulatory (OsIDHc;1, OsIDHc;2) IDH subunits and three GDH proteins (OsGDH1-3) were isolated. These genes, except OsGDH3, were expressed in the roots. Real-time PCR analysis showed that OsIDHa and OsIDHc;1 transcripts, but not OsGDH1 and OsGDH2 transcripts, accumulated in a similar manner to NADH-GOGAT mRNA along the crown roots after the supply of different forms of inorganic nitrogen. Furthermore, immunolocalization studies revealed the NH(4) (+) induction of IDHa protein in two cell layers of the root surface, i.e. epidermis and exodermis, where NADH-GOGAT also accumulated. The possible relationship between NADH-GOGAT, IDH and GDH is discussed.

BACKGROUND: Alkali stress is an important agricultural contaminant and has complex effects on plant metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the alkali stress has different effects on the growth, ion balance, and nitrogen metabolism in old and young leaves of rice plants, and to compare functions of both organs in alkali tolerance. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The results showed that alkali stress only produced a small effect on the growth of young leaves, whereas strongly damaged old leaves. Rice protected young leaves from ion harm via the large accumulation of Na(+) and Cl(-) in old leaves. The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsAKT1, OsHAK1, OsHAK7, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 may contribute to the larger accumulation of Na(+) in old leaves under alkali stress. Alkali stress mightily reduced the NO(3)(-) contents in both organs. As old leaf cells have larger vacuole, under alkali stress these scarce NO(3)(-) was principally stored in old leaves. Accordingly, the expression of OsNRT1;1 and OsNRT1;2 in old leaves was up-regulated by alkali stress, revealing that the two genes might contribute to the accumulation of NO(3)(-) in old leaves. NO(3)(-) deficiency in young leaves under alkali stress might induce the reduction in OsNR1 expression and the subsequent lacking of NH(4)(+), which might be main reason for the larger down-regulation of OsFd-GOGAT and OsGS2 in young leaves. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results strongly indicated that, during adaptation of rice to alkali stress, young and old leaves have distinct mechanisms of ion balance and nitrogen metabolism regulation. We propose that the comparative studies of young and old tissues may be important for abiotic stress tolerance research.
