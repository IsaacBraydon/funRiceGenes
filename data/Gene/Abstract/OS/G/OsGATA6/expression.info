OsGATA6	 Overexpression of OsGATA6 resulted in delayed heading, increased grain number, and decreased grain size |  Further analyses showed that OsGATA6 could bind to the promoter of OsMFT1 and induce its expression, thereby regulating heading date and panicle development |  Overexpression of OsGATA6 in Arabidopsis resulted in repressed expression of AtFT and late flowering, suggesting that its function is similar	 Overexpression of OsGATA6 resulted in delayed heading, increased grain number, and decreased grain size |  Overexpression of OsGATA6 in Arabidopsis resulted in repressed expression of AtFT and late flowering, suggesting that its function is similar
