OsVTE1	abiotic stress	The role of tocopherol cyclase in salt stress tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa)	 OsVTE1 was induced significantly by abiotic stresses such as high salt, H(2)O(2), drought, cold and by the plant hormones ABA and salicylic acid
OsVTE1	stem	The role of tocopherol cyclase in salt stress tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa)	The tissue-specific expression pattern and OsVTE1-promoter GUS activity assay showed that OsVTE1 was mainly expressed in the leaf, and also could be detected in the root, stem and panicle
OsVTE1	panicle	The role of tocopherol cyclase in salt stress tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa)	The tissue-specific expression pattern and OsVTE1-promoter GUS activity assay showed that OsVTE1 was mainly expressed in the leaf, and also could be detected in the root, stem and panicle
OsVTE1	salt	The role of tocopherol cyclase in salt stress tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa)	 OsVTE1 was induced significantly by abiotic stresses such as high salt, H(2)O(2), drought, cold and by the plant hormones ABA and salicylic acid
OsVTE1	salt	The role of tocopherol cyclase in salt stress tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa)	Compared with control plants, transgenic plants with Os-VTE1 RNA interference (OsVTE1-RNAi) were more sensitive to salt stress whereas, in contrast, transgenic plants overexpressing OsVTE1 (OsVTE1-OX) showed higher tolerance to salt stress
OsVTE1	drought	The role of tocopherol cyclase in salt stress tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa)	 OsVTE1 was induced significantly by abiotic stresses such as high salt, H(2)O(2), drought, cold and by the plant hormones ABA and salicylic acid
OsVTE1	salicylic acid	The role of tocopherol cyclase in salt stress tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa)	OsVTE1 was induced significantly by abiotic stresses such as high salt, H(2)O(2), drought, cold and by the plant hormones ABA and salicylic acid
