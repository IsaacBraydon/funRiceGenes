OsVMT	ZN	A vacuolar phytosiderophore transporter alters iron and zinc accumulation in polished rice grains.	 OsVMT is highly expressed in the parenchyma cell bridges of node I where Fe and Zn are highly deposited
OsVMT	ZN	A vacuolar phytosiderophore transporter alters iron and zinc accumulation in polished rice grains.	 Taken together, our results indicate that OsVMT is involved in sequestering DMA into the vacuoles and that knockout of this gene enhances accumulation of Fe and Zn in polished rice grains through DMA-increased solubilization of Fe and Zn deposited in the node
