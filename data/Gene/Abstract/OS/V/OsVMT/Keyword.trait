OsVMT|OsZIFL12	root	A vacuolar phytosiderophore transporter alters iron and zinc accumulation in polished rice grains.	 At the vegetative stage, knockout of OsVMT resulted in decreased DMA but increased ferric Fe in the root cell sap
OsVMT|OsZIFL12	shoot	A vacuolar phytosiderophore transporter alters iron and zinc accumulation in polished rice grains.	 The expression of OsVMT was induced by Fe deficiency in the roots but not in the shoot basal region and uppermost node
OsVMT|OsZIFL12	vegetative	A vacuolar phytosiderophore transporter alters iron and zinc accumulation in polished rice grains.	 At the vegetative stage, knockout of OsVMT resulted in decreased DMA but increased ferric Fe in the root cell sap
OsVMT|OsZIFL12	node	A vacuolar phytosiderophore transporter alters iron and zinc accumulation in polished rice grains.	 OsVMT is highly expressed in the parenchyma cell bridges of node I where Fe and Zn are highly deposited
OsVMT|OsZIFL12	node	A vacuolar phytosiderophore transporter alters iron and zinc accumulation in polished rice grains.	 The expression of OsVMT was induced by Fe deficiency in the roots but not in the shoot basal region and uppermost node
OsVMT|OsZIFL12	node	A vacuolar phytosiderophore transporter alters iron and zinc accumulation in polished rice grains.	 Taken together, our results indicate that OsVMT is involved in sequestering DMA into the vacuoles and that knockout of this gene enhances accumulation of Fe and Zn in polished rice grains through DMA-increased solubilization of Fe and Zn deposited in the node
