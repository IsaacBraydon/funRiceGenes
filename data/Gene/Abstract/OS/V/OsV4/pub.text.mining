deletion which is -2bp away from the 5' UTR region in LOC_Os04g39970 (Figure 3D). LOC_Os04g39970, about 2500-bp 5' upstream region and about 700-bp 3'downstream region. Resultantly, this identity (Figure 4A). Another predicted Oryza sativa protein, encoded by LOC_Os07g36450, was also found LOC_Os04g39970.
