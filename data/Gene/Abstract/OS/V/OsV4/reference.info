Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, characterized by tandem arrays of a 35 amino acid motif, have been suggested to play central and broad roles in modulating the expression of organelle genes in plants. However, the molecular mechanisms of most rice PPR genes remains unclear. In this paper, we isolated and characterized a temperature-conditional virescent mutant, OsV4, in rice (Oryza sativa cultivar Jiahua1 (WT, japonica rice variety)). The mutant displays albino phenotype and abnormal chloroplasts at the three leaf stage, which gradually turns green after the four leaf stage at a low temperature (20 degrees C). But the mutant always develops green leaves and well-developed chloroplasts at a high temperature (32 degrees C). Genetic and molecular analyses uncovered that OsV4 encodes a novel chloroplast-targeted PPR protein including four PPR motifs. Further investigations show that the mutant phenotype is associated with changes in chlorophyll content and chloroplast development. The OsV4 transcripts only accumulate to high levels in young leaves, indicating that its expression is tissue-specific. In addition, transcript levels of some ribosomal components and plastid-encoded polymerase-dependent genes are dramatically reduced in the albino mutants grown at 20 degrees C. These findings suggest that OsV4 plays an important role during early chloroplast development under cold stress in rice.
