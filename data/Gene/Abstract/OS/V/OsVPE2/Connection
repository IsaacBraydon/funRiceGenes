OsVPE2	OsVPE3|REP-2	Bcl-2 suppresses hydrogen peroxide-induced programmed cell death via OsVPE2 and OsVPE3, but not via OsVPE1 and OsVPE4, in rice	We propose that Bcl-2 overexpression in rice suppresses the transcriptional activation of OsVPE2 and OsVPE3, but not of OsVPE1 or OsVPE4

Glup3|OsVPE1	OsVPE2	Identification of vacuolar phosphate efflux transporters in land plants.	 Here, we identified a pair of Oryza sativa vacuolar Pi efflux transporters (OsVPE1 and OsVPE2) that were more abundant in plants grown under Pi-deficient conditions
Glup3|OsVPE1	OsVPE2	Identification of vacuolar phosphate efflux transporters in land plants.	 Vacuolar Pi content was higher in the loss-of-function Osvpe1<U+2009>Osvpe2 double mutant than in wild type, particularly under low-Pi stress
Glup3|OsVPE1	OsVPE2	Identification of vacuolar phosphate efflux transporters in land plants.	 Overexpression of either OsVPE1 or OsVPE2 in transgenic plants reduced vacuolar Pi content, consistent with a role in vacuolar Pi efflux
