10.1007-BF00029862.pdf	Sequence and functional analyses of the rice gene homologous to the maize Vp1	1994	Plant Mol Biol	Center for Molecular Biology and Genetics, Mie University, Tsu, Japan.	The homologous gene of the maize Vp1 gene was isolated from rice (Oryza sativa). Sequence analysis revealed that the rice Vp1 gene (Osvp1) encodes a protein of 728 amino acids and is interupted by 5 introns at positions identical to those of the maize gene. Osvp1 transcript was detected in developing embryo as early as 10 days after flowering and decreased toward maturity. Osvp1 transcript was also detected in dry as well as imbided mature embryos. The ability of Osvp1 gene product to activate a target gene was shown by transient expression experiments in rice suspension-cultured cell protoplasts using a reporter gene construct carrying the bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fused to the promoter of OsEm gene, the rice homologue of the wheat Em gene.

Plant hormone gibberellin (GA) promotes juvenile-adult phase change in higher plants. To confirm the functions of GA in rice, I used dwarf mutant d18-dy. d18-dy is a loss-of-function allele of D18, which encodes GA3ox2. d18-dy mutant exhibited long juvenile phase in morphological traits such as the size of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), shape of leaf blades, presence or absence of midribs and node-internode differentiation in stem. In contrast, expression patterns of juvenile-adult phase change markers miR156 and miR172 were similar between wild type and d18-dy. In addition, d18-dy mutation and GA did not affect expression levels of downstream genes of miR156. GA does not function upstream of miR156 in juvenile-adult phase change.
J. Exp. Bot.-2007-Fan-3811-7.pdf	Short, direct repeats (SDRs)-mediated post-transcriptional processing of a transcription factor gene OsVP1 in rice (Oryza sativa)	2007	J Exp Bot	Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Bio-resource and Eco-environment, College of Life Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China.	The various degrees of preharvest sprouting occurring in hybrid rice is a limiting factor in the propagation and production of hybrid rice seeds. The phenotype of sprouted rice is very similar to that of the maize (Zea mays) seed-specific mutation viviparous 1. VP1 has been shown to be a transcription factor essential for seed maturation and dormancy induction. In this study, numerous truncated transcripts of OsVP1 resulting from an unusual post-transcriptional processing, were detected in four rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars. The observed events took place at a region spanning exons 1 to 5, and led to a variety of deletions that resulted in the loss of functional domain and frame-shifts with premature termination by introducing a stop codon. Various proportions of the transcripts expressed in both immature and mature embryos were observed to be incorrectly processed and associated with the genetic variation of preharvest sprouting rates among various rice varieties. In sprouting-susceptible rice cultivars, G46B and HeiB, many more incorrectly processed OsVP1 transcripts were expressed in immature than in mature embryos, indicating that the unusual post-transcriptional processing of the OsVP1 gene was developmentally regulated. In addition, comprehensive sequence analyses demonstrated the presence of paired short direct repeats (SDRs) at the junctions of the unusual excision sites in exons of OsVP1 gene. Site selection for the deletion of exon materials was altered along with the genotypes and developmental stages.
j.1365-313X.1995.07060913.x.pdf	Regulation of the Osem gene by abscisic acid and the transcriptional activator VP1: analysis of cis-acting promoter elements required for regulation by abscisic acid and VP1	1995	The Plant Journal	Center for Molecular Biology and Genetics, Mie University, Tsu, Japan.	Osem, a rice gene homologous to the wheat Em gene, which encodes one of the late-embryogenesis abundant proteins was isolated. The gene was characterized with respect to control of transcription by abscisic acid (ABA) and the transcriptional activator VP1, which is involved in the ABA-regulated gene expression during late embryo-genesis. A fusion gene (Osem-GUS) consisting of the Osem promoter and the bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene was constructed and tested in a transient expression system, using protoplasts derived from a suspension-cultured line of rice cells, for activation by ABA and by co-transfection with an expression vector (35S-Osvp1) for the rice VP1 (OSVP1) cDNA. The expression of Osem-GUS was strongly (40- to 150-fold) activated by externally applied ABA and by over-expression of (OS)VP1. The Osem promoter has three ACGTG-containing sequences, motif A, motif B and motif A', which resemble the abscisic acid-responsive element (ABRE) that was previously identified in the wheat Em and the rice Rab16. There is also a CATGCATG sequence, which is known as the Sph box and is shown to be essential for the regulation by VP1 of the maize anthocyanin regulatory gene C1. Focusing on these sequence elements, various mutant derivatives of the Osem promoter in the transient expression system were assayed. The analysis revealed that motif A functions not only as an ABRE but also as a sequence element required for the regulation by (OS)VP1.
Plant Cell Physiol-1996-Nakagawa-355-62.pdf	The Seed-Specific Transcription Factor VP1 (OSVP1) Is Expressed in Rice Suspension-Cultured Cells	1996	Plant Cell Physiol	Center for Molecular Biology and Genetics, Mie University 1515 Kamihama-cho, Tsu, 514 Japan	A seed-specific transcriptional regulator, VP1, is required for the induction of ABA-regulated genes that include Lea (late embryogenesis abundant protein) genes. Although the induction of one rice Lea gene, Osem, by ABA is normally restricted to seed tissues, we found that the expression was strongly induced by ABA in the Oc line of rice suspension-cultured cells. Since this observation suggested that rice VP1 (OSVP1) protein or a functionally similar protein might be expressed in the cultured cells, we analyzed the expression of Osvpl in these cells at both the mRNA and the protein level, we detected Osvp1 mRNA and OSVP1 protein in the cultured cells at levels similar to or higher than those in developing embryos. In the cultured cells, neither the level of total cellular OSVP1 nor that of nuclear OSVP1 protein was affected by ABA. Based on the results, the mechanism for the transcriptional regulation of VP1-dependent ABA-inducible genes is discussed.
PNAS-1999-Hobo-15348-53.pdf	A bZIP factor, TRAB1, interacts with VP1 and mediates abscisic acid-induced transcription	1999	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Center for Molecular Biology, Mie University, 1515 Kamihama-cho, Tsu 514-8507, Japan.	The transcription factor VP1 regulates maturation and dormancy in plant seeds by activating genes responsive to the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Although activation involves ABA-responsive elements (ABREs), VP1 itself does not specifically bind ABREs. Instead, we have identified and cloned a basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) factor, TRAB1, that interacts with both VP1 and ABREs. Transcription from a chimeric promoter with GAL4-binding sites was ABA-inducible if cells expressed a GAL4 DNA-binding domain::TRAB1 fusion protein. Results indicate that TRAB1 is a true trans-acting factor involved in ABA-regulated transcription and reveal a molecular mechanism for the VP1-dependent, ABA-inducible transcription that controls maturation and dormancy in plant embryos.
PNAS-2010-Sugimoto-0911965107.pdf	Molecular cloning of Sdr4, a regulator involved in seed dormancy and domestication of rice	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	Seed dormancy provides a strategy for flowering plants to survive adverse natural conditions. It is also an important agronomic trait affecting grain yield, quality, and processing performance. We cloned a rice quantitative trait locus, Sdr4, which contributes substantially to differences in seed dormancy between japonica (Nipponbare) and indica (Kasalath) cultivars. Sdr4 expression is positively regulated by OsVP1, a global regulator of seed maturation, and in turn positively regulates potential regulators of seed dormancy and represses the expression of postgerminative genes, suggesting that Sdr4 acts as an intermediate regulator of dormancy in the seed maturation program. Japonica cultivars have only the Nipponbare allele (Sdr4-n), which endows reduced dormancy, whereas both the Kasalath allele (Srd4-k) and Sdr4-n are widely distributed in the indica group, indicating prevalent introgression. Srd4-k also is found in the wild ancestor Oryza rufipogon, whereas Sdr4-n appears to have been produced through at least two mutation events from the closest O. rufipogon allele among the accessions examined. These results are discussed with respect to possible selection of the allele during the domestication process.
NA	Rice PcG gene OsEMF2b controls seed dormancy and seedling growth by regulating the expression of OsVP1.	2017	Plant Sci	College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	The induction and release of seed dormancy are a precisely regulated process that influences seed germination. ABA promotes seed dormancy but suppresses seed germination and seedling growth. However, how chromatin and epigenetic mechanisms regulate the expression of ABA related genes during these processes remains unclear. Polycomb gene OsEMF2b was required for regulation of seed dormancy and seedling growth by dynamically activating and repressing ABA signal response genes. Downregulation of OsEMF2b led to vivipary and decreased expression level of OsVP1, which was involved in ABA signal pathway in seed dormancy. While, the seedlings with downregulation of OsEMF2b exhibited hyper-sensitive response to ABA and the expression of OsVP1 is upregulated. Yeast one-hybrid assay and ChIP analyses proved that OsEMF2b could bind to the promoter of OsVP1 directly and affected H3K27me3 enrichments of OsVP1 in seedling. Interestingly, both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 enrichments of OsVP1 were changed with OsEMF2b mis-expression in seed and seedling. We proposed that OsEMF2b may play a pivotal role in seed dormancy and seedling growth by regulating the expression of OsVP1 indirectly or directly.
NA	Transcription Factors Rc and OsVP 1 Coordinately Regulate Preharvest Sprouting Tolerance in Red Pericarp Rice	2021	J Agric Food Chem	Key Laboratory of Soybean Molecular Design Breeding, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Harbin 150081, China.	Red pericarp associates with seed dormancy or preharvest sprouting (PHS) tolerance in crops. To identify this association's molecular mechanism, a PHS mutant Osviviparous1 (Osvp1) was characterized in rice and crossed with Kasalath, a red pericarp cultivar with Rc (red coleoptiles) genotype. Among the dehulled seeds of F2 progenies, RcRcvp1vp1 seeds performed a lower PHS rate than rcrcvp1vp1 seeds and showed shallower pigmentation than RcRcVP1VP1 seeds. Kasalath and SL9 (an RcRcVP1VP1 substitution line with Nipponbare background) showed more ABA sensitivity than the Nipponbare (rcrcVP1VP1) by the germination assay, and the transcriptional abundance of ABA signal genes OsABI2, OsSnRK2, OsVP1, ABI5, and especially OsVP1 increased in the red pericarp line SL9. Moreover, OsVP1 can directly bind Rc (bHLH) promoter by yeast one-hybrid, which activates Rc and OsLAR expression in red pericarp rice. Furthermore, a luciferase complementation imaging assay showed that OsVP1 interacts with transcriptions factors Rc and OsC1. These results indicate that OsVP1 promotes proanthocyanidin accumulation through the interaction among OsVP1, Rc, and OsC1 and then increases the plant's ABA sensitivity and PHS resistance.
NA	Dynamic genome-wide association analysis and identification of candidate genes involved in anaerobic germination tolerance in rice	2021	Rice (N Y)	National Engineering Research Center of Plant Space Breeding, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Background: In Asian rice production, an increasing number of countries now choose the direct seeding mode because of rising costs, labour shortages and water shortages. The ability of rice seeds to undergo anaerobic germination (AG) plays an important role in the success of direct seeding.  Results: In this study, we used 2,123,725 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers based on resequencing to conduct a dynamic genome-wide association study (GWAS) of coleoptile length (CL) and coleoptile diameter (CD) in 209 natural rice populations. A total of 26 SNP loci were detected in these two phenotypes, of which 5 overlapped with previously reported loci (S1_ 39674301, S6_ 20797781, S7_ 18722403, S8_ 9946213, S11_ 19165397), and two sites were detected repeatedly at different time points (S3_ 24689629 and S5_ 27918754). We suggest that these 7 loci (-log10 (P) value > 7.3271) are the key sites that affect AG tolerance. To screen the candidate genes more effectively, we sequenced the transcriptome of the flooding-tolerant variety R151 in six key stages, including anaerobic (AN) and the oxygen conversion point (AN-A), and obtained high-quality differential expression profiles. Four reliable candidate genes were identified: Os01g0911700 (OsVP1), Os05g0560900 (OsGA2ox8), Os05g0562200 (OsDi19-1) and Os06g0548200. Then qRT-PCR and LC-MS/ MS targeting metabolite detection technology were used to further verify that the up-regulated expression of these four candidate genes was closely related to AG.  Conclusion: The four novel candidate genes were associated with gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) regulation and cell wall metabolism under oxygen-deficiency conditions and promoted coleoptile elongation while avoiding adverse effects, allowing the coleoptile to obtain oxygen, escape the low-oxygen environment and germinate rapidly. The results of this study improve our understanding of the genetic basis of AG in rice seeds, which is conducive to the selection of flooding-tolerant varieties suitable for direct seeding.
