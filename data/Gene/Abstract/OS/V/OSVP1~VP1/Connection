OsEm|EMP1|OsEm1	OSVP1|VP1	Regulation of the Osem gene by abscisic acid and the transcriptional activator VP1: analysis of cis-acting promoter elements required for regulation by abscisic acid and VP1	 A fusion gene (Osem-GUS) consisting of the Osem promoter and the bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene was constructed and tested in a transient expression system, using protoplasts derived from a suspension-cultured line of rice cells, for activation by ABA and by co-transfection with an expression vector (35S-Osvp1) for the rice VP1 (OSVP1) cDNA
OsEm|EMP1|OsEm1	OSVP1|VP1	Regulation of the Osem gene by abscisic acid and the transcriptional activator VP1: analysis of cis-acting promoter elements required for regulation by abscisic acid and VP1	 The expression of Osem-GUS was strongly (40- to 150-fold) activated by externally applied ABA and by over-expression of (OS)VP1
OsEm|EMP1|OsEm1	OSVP1|VP1	Regulation of the Osem gene by abscisic acid and the transcriptional activator VP1: analysis of cis-acting promoter elements required for regulation by abscisic acid and VP1	Regulation of the Osem gene by abscisic acid and the transcriptional activator VP1: analysis of cis-acting promoter elements required for regulation by abscisic acid and VP1
OsEm|EMP1|OsEm1	OSVP1|VP1	Regulation of the Osem gene by abscisic acid and the transcriptional activator VP1: analysis of cis-acting promoter elements required for regulation by abscisic acid and VP1	 The gene was characterized with respect to control of transcription by abscisic acid (ABA) and the transcriptional activator VP1, which is involved in the ABA-regulated gene expression during late embryo-genesis
OsEm|EMP1|OsEm1	OSVP1|VP1	Regulation of the Osem gene by abscisic acid and the transcriptional activator VP1: analysis of cis-acting promoter elements required for regulation by abscisic acid and VP1	 The analysis revealed that motif A functions not only as an ABRE but also as a sequence element required for the regulation by (OS)VP1
OSVP1|VP1	TRAB1|OsbZIP66	A bZIP factor, TRAB1, interacts with VP1 and mediates abscisic acid-induced transcription	 Instead, we have identified and cloned a basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) factor, TRAB1, that interacts with both VP1 and ABREs
OSVP1|VP1	TRAB1|OsbZIP66	A bZIP factor, TRAB1, interacts with VP1 and mediates abscisic acid-induced transcription	 Results indicate that TRAB1 is a true trans-acting factor involved in ABA-regulated transcription and reveal a molecular mechanism for the VP1-dependent, ABA-inducible transcription that controls maturation and dormancy in plant embryos
OSVP1|VP1	TRAB1|OsbZIP66	A bZIP factor, TRAB1, interacts with VP1 and mediates abscisic acid-induced transcription	A bZIP factor, TRAB1, interacts with VP1 and mediates abscisic acid-induced transcription
OSVP1|VP1	Sdr4	Molecular cloning of Sdr4, a regulator involved in seed dormancy and domestication of rice	 Sdr4 expression is positively regulated by OsVP1, a global regulator of seed maturation, and in turn positively regulates potential regulators of seed dormancy and represses the expression of postgerminative genes, suggesting that Sdr4 acts as an intermediate regulator of dormancy in the seed maturation program
