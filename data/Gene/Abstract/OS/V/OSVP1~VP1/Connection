OSVP1|VP1	Sdr4	Molecular cloning of Sdr4, a regulator involved in seed dormancy and domestication of rice	Sdr4 expression is positively regulated by OsVP1, a global regulator of seed maturation, and in turn positively regulates potential regulators of seed dormancy and represses the expression of postgerminative genes, suggesting that Sdr4 acts as an intermediate regulator of dormancy in the seed maturation program
OsEMF2b	OSVP1|VP1	Rice PcG gene OsEMF2b controls seed dormancy and seedling growth by regulating the expression of OsVP1.	Rice PcG gene OsEMF2b controls seed dormancy and seedling growth by regulating the expression of OsVP1.
OsEMF2b	OSVP1|VP1	Rice PcG gene OsEMF2b controls seed dormancy and seedling growth by regulating the expression of OsVP1.	 Downregulation of OsEMF2b led to vivipary and decreased expression level of OsVP1, which was involved in ABA signal pathway in seed dormancy
OsEMF2b	OSVP1|VP1	Rice PcG gene OsEMF2b controls seed dormancy and seedling growth by regulating the expression of OsVP1.	 While, the seedlings with downregulation of OsEMF2b exhibited hyper-sensitive response to ABA and the expression of OsVP1 is upregulated
OsEMF2b	OSVP1|VP1	Rice PcG gene OsEMF2b controls seed dormancy and seedling growth by regulating the expression of OsVP1.	 Yeast one-hybrid assay and ChIP analyses proved that OsEMF2b could bind to the promoter of OsVP1 directly and affected H3K27me3 enrichments of OsVP1 in seedling
OsEMF2b	OSVP1|VP1	Rice PcG gene OsEMF2b controls seed dormancy and seedling growth by regulating the expression of OsVP1.	 Interestingly, both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 enrichments of OsVP1 were changed with OsEMF2b mis-expression in seed and seedling
OsEMF2b	OSVP1|VP1	Rice PcG gene OsEMF2b controls seed dormancy and seedling growth by regulating the expression of OsVP1.	 We proposed that OsEMF2b may play a pivotal role in seed dormancy and seedling growth by regulating the expression of OsVP1 indirectly or directly
OSVP1|VP1	OsWRKY29	WRKY Transcription Factor OsWRKY29 Represses Seed Dormancy in Rice by Weakening Abscisic Acid Response.	 In addition, the expression levels of ABA positive response factors OsVP1 and OsABF1 were higher in the OsWRKY29 mutants but were lower in its overexpression lines
OSVP1|VP1	OsWRKY29	WRKY Transcription Factor OsWRKY29 Represses Seed Dormancy in Rice by Weakening Abscisic Acid Response.	 Further assays showed that OsWRKY29 could bind to the promoters of OsABF1 and OsVP1 to inhibit their expression
OSVP1|VP1	OsWRKY29	WRKY Transcription Factor OsWRKY29 Represses Seed Dormancy in Rice by Weakening Abscisic Acid Response.	 In summary, we identified a new ABA signaling repressor OsWRKY29 that represses seed dormancy by directly downregulating the expression of OsABF1 and OsVP1
