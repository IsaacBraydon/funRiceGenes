OSVP1|VP1	Rice PcG gene OsEMF2b controls seed dormancy and seedling growth by regulating the expression of OsVP1. |  Downregulation of OsEMF2b led to vivipary and decreased expression level of OsVP1, which was involved in ABA signal pathway in seed dormancy |  While, the seedlings with downregulation of OsEMF2b exhibited hyper-sensitive response to ABA and the expression of OsVP1 is upregulated |  Interestingly, both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 enrichments of OsVP1 were changed with OsEMF2b mis-expression in seed and seedling |  We proposed that OsEMF2b may play a pivotal role in seed dormancy and seedling growth by regulating the expression of OsVP1 indirectly or directly
OSVP1|VP1	 Moreover, OsVP1 can directly bind Rc (bHLH) promoter by yeast one-hybrid, which activates Rc and OsLAR expression in red pericarp rice
