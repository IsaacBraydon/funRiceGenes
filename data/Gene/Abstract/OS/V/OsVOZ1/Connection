APIP10	OsVOZ1	Two VOZ transcription factors link an E3 ligase and an NLR immune receptor to modulate immunity in rice.	 In this study, we found that APIP10 interacts with two rice transcription factors, VASCULAR PLANT ONE-ZINC FINGER 1 (OsVOZ1) and OsVOZ2, and promotes their degradation through the 26S proteasome pathway

OsVOZ1	OsVOZ2	Two VOZ transcription factors link an E3 ligase and an NLR immune receptor to modulate immunity in rice.	 OsVOZ1 displays transcriptional repression activity while OsVOZ2 confers transcriptional activation activity in planta
OsVOZ1	OsVOZ2	Two VOZ transcription factors link an E3 ligase and an NLR immune receptor to modulate immunity in rice.	 The osvoz1 and osvoz2 single mutants display modest but opposite M
OsVOZ1	OsVOZ2	Two VOZ transcription factors link an E3 ligase and an NLR immune receptor to modulate immunity in rice.	 However, the osvoz1 osvoz2 double mutant exhibits strong dwarfism and cell death, and silencing of both genes via RNA interference also leads to dwarfism, mild cell death, and enhanced resistance to M
OsVOZ1	OsVOZ2	Two VOZ transcription factors link an E3 ligase and an NLR immune receptor to modulate immunity in rice.	 Double silencing of OsVOZ1 and OsVOZ2 in the Piz-t background decreases Piz-t protein accumulation and transcription, reactive oxygen species-dependent cell death, and resistance to M
OsVOZ1	OsVOZ2	Two VOZ transcription factors link an E3 ligase and an NLR immune receptor to modulate immunity in rice.	 Taken together, these results indicate that OsVOZ1 and OsVOZ2 negatively regulate basal defense but contribute positively to Piz-t-mediated immunity
OsVOZ1	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	Two VOZ transcription factors link an E3 ligase and an NLR immune receptor to modulate immunity in rice.	 Both OsVOZ1 and OsVOZ2Â interact with Piz-t
OsVOZ1	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	Two VOZ transcription factors link an E3 ligase and an NLR immune receptor to modulate immunity in rice.	 Double silencing of OsVOZ1 and OsVOZ2 in the Piz-t background decreases Piz-t protein accumulation and transcription, reactive oxygen species-dependent cell death, and resistance to M
