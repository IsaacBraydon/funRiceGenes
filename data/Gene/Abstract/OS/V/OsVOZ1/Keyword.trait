OsVOZ1	resistance	Two VOZ transcription factors link an E3 ligase and an NLR immune receptor to modulate immunity in rice.	 However, the osvoz1 osvoz2 double mutant exhibits strong dwarfism and cell death, and silencing of both genes via RNA interference also leads to dwarfism, mild cell death, and enhanced resistance to M
OsVOZ1	resistance	Two VOZ transcription factors link an E3 ligase and an NLR immune receptor to modulate immunity in rice.	 Double silencing of OsVOZ1 and OsVOZ2 in the Piz-t background decreases Piz-t protein accumulation and transcription, reactive oxygen species-dependent cell death, and resistance to M
OsVOZ1	defense	Two VOZ transcription factors link an E3 ligase and an NLR immune receptor to modulate immunity in rice.	 Taken together, these results indicate that OsVOZ1 and OsVOZ2 negatively regulate basal defense but contribute positively to Piz-t-mediated immunity
