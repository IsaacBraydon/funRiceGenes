NA	Rice GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase OsVTC1-1 and OsVTC1-3 play different roles in ascorbic acid synthesis.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, China.	GDP-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GMPase) catalyzes the synthesis of GDP-D-mannose, which is a precursor for ascorbic acid (AsA) synthesis in plants. The rice genome encodes three GMPase homologs OsVTC1-1, OsVTC1-3 and OsVTC1-8, but their roles in AsA synthesis are unclear. The overexpression of OsVTC1-1 or OsVTC1-3 restored the AsA synthesis of vtc1-1 in Arabidopsis, while that of OsVTC1-8 did not, indicating that only OsVTC1-1 and OsVTC1-3 are involved in AsA synthesis in rice. Similar to Arabidopsis VTC1, the expression of OsVTC1-1 was high in leaves, induced by light, and inhibited by dark. Unlike OsVTC1-1, the expression level of OsVTC1-3 was high in roots and quickly induced by the dark, while the transcription level of OsVTC1-8 did not show obvious changes under constant light or dark treatments. In OsVTC1-1 RNAi plants, the AsA content of rice leaves decreased, and the AsA production induced by light was limited. In contrast, OsVTC1-3 RNAi lines altered AsA synthesis levels in rice roots, but not in the leaves or under the light/dark treatment. The enzyme activity showed that OsVTC1-1 and OsVTC1-3 had higher GMPase activities than OsVTC1-8 in vitro. Our data showed that, unlike in Arabidopsis, the rice GPMase homologous proteins illustrated a new model in AsA synthesis: OsVTC1-1 may be involved in the AsA synthesis, which takes place in leaves, while OsVTC1-3 may be responsible for AsA synthesis in roots. The different roles of rice GMPase homologous proteins in AsA synthesis may be due to their differences in transcript levels and enzyme activities.
NA	OsEIL1 protects rice growth under NH(4) (+) nutrition by regulating OsVTC1-3-dependent N-glycosylation and root NH(4) (+) efflux.	2022	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, China.	Rice is known for its superior adaptation to ammonium (NH(4) (+) ) as a nitrogen source. Compared to many other cereals, it displays lower NH(4) (+) efflux in roots and higher nitrogen-use efficiency on NH(4) (+) . A critical role for GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (VTC1) in controlling root NH(4) (+) fluxes was previously documented in Arabidopsis, but the molecular pathways involved in regulating VTC1-dependent NH(4) (+) efflux remain unclear. Here, we report that ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3-LIKE1 (OsEIL1) acts as a key transcription factor regulating OsVTC1-3-dependent NH(4) (+) efflux and protein N-glycosylation in rice grown under NH(4) (+) nutrition. We show that OsEIL1 in rice plays a contrasting role to Arabidopsis-homologous ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (AtEIN3) and maintains rice growth under NH(4) (+) by stabilizing protein N-glycosylation and reducing root NH(4) (+) efflux. OsEIL1 constrains NH(4) (+) efflux by activation of OsVTC1-3, but not OsVTC1-1 or OsVTC1-8. OsEIL1 binds directly to the promoter EIN3-binding site (EBS) of OsVTC1-3 in vitro and in vivo and acts to increase the transcription of OsVTC1-3. Our work demonstrates an important link between excessive root NH(4) (+) efflux and OsVTC1-3-mediated protein N-glycosylation in rice grown under NH(4) (+) nutrition and identifies OsEIL1 as a direct genetic regulator of OsVTC1-3 expression.
