MIT	OsVIT2	The knockdown of OsVIT2 and MIT affects iron localization in rice seed	Here, we discuss the characterization of a rice vacuolar Fe transporter 2 (OsVIT2) T-DNA insertion line (osvit2) and report that the knockdown of OsVIT2 and mitochondrial Fe transporter (MIT) expression affects seed Fe localization
MIT	OsVIT2	The knockdown of OsVIT2 and MIT affects iron localization in rice seed	Previously, we reported that the expression of OsVIT2 was higher in MIT knockdown (mit-2) plants, and in this study, the accumulation of Fe in mit-2 seeds decreased significantly
MIT	OsVIT2	The knockdown of OsVIT2 and MIT affects iron localization in rice seed	Moreover, changes in the expression of OsVIT2 and MIT affect the concentration and localization of metals in brown rice as well as in polished rice seeds
MIT	OsVIT2	The knockdown of OsVIT2 and MIT affects iron localization in rice seed	The knockdown of OsVIT2 and MIT affects iron localization in rice seed
OsVIT1	OsVIT2	Vacuolar membrane transporters OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 modulate iron translocation between flag leaves and seeds in rice	In this study we report the isolation and functional characterization of two rice genes OsVIT1 and OsVIT2, orthologs of the Arabidopsis VIT1
OsVIT1	OsVIT2	Vacuolar membrane transporters OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 modulate iron translocation between flag leaves and seeds in rice	Transient expression of OsVIT1:EGFP and OsVIT2:EGFP protein fusions revealed that OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 are localized to the vacuolar membrane
OsVIT1	OsVIT2	Vacuolar membrane transporters OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 modulate iron translocation between flag leaves and seeds in rice	Ectopic expression of OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 partially rescued the Fe(2+) - and Zn(2+) -sensitive phenotypes in yeast mutant Deltaccc1 and Deltazrc1, and further increased vacuolar Fe(2+) , Zn(2+) and Mn(2+) accumulation
OsVIT1	OsVIT2	Vacuolar membrane transporters OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 modulate iron translocation between flag leaves and seeds in rice	These data together suggest that OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 function to transport Fe(2+) , Zn(2+) and Mn(2+) across the tonoplast into vacuoles in yeast
OsVIT1	OsVIT2	Vacuolar membrane transporters OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 modulate iron translocation between flag leaves and seeds in rice	In rice, OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 are highly expressed in flag leaf blade and sheath, respectively, and in contrast to OsVIT1, OsVIT2 is highly responsive to Fe treatments
OsVIT1	OsVIT2	Vacuolar membrane transporters OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 modulate iron translocation between flag leaves and seeds in rice	Interestingly, functional disruption of OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 leads to increased Fe/Zn accumulation in rice seeds and a corresponding decrease in the source organ flag leaves, indicating an enhanced Fe/Zn translocation between source and sink organs, which might represent a novel strategy to biofortify Fe/Zn in staple foods
OsVIT1	OsVIT2	Vacuolar membrane transporters OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 modulate iron translocation between flag leaves and seeds in rice	Vacuolar membrane transporters OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 modulate iron translocation between flag leaves and seeds in rice
OsFER2	OsVIT2	Rice iron storage protein ferritin 2 (OsFER2) positively regulates ferroptotic cell death and defense responses against Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsFER2 knock-out in wild-type rice HY did not induce ROS and ferric ion (Fe(3+)) accumulation, lipid peroxidation and hypersensitive response (HR) cell death, and also downregulated the defense-related genes OsPAL1, OsPR1-b, OsRbohB, OsNADP-ME2-3, OsMEK2 and OsMPK1, and vacuolar membrane transporter OsVIT2 expression
