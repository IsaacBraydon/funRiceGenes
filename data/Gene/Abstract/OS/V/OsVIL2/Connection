LC2|OsVIL3	OsVIL2	LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF	Here we demonstrated that rice LC2 (OsVIL3) and OsVIL2 (two OsVILs, possible components of PRC2 complex) promote rice flowering
LC2|OsVIL3	OsVIL2	LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF	Our results showed that expressions of LC2 and OsVIL2 are induced by SD (short-day) conditions and both lc2 mutant and OsVIL2-RNAi lines display delayed heading date, consistent with the reduced expression levels of Hd1 and Hd3a

Ehd1	OsVIL2	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	In osvil2 mutants OsLFL1 expression was increased, but that of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 was reduced
Ehd1	OsVIL2	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression
Hd3a	OsVIL2	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	In osvil2 mutants OsLFL1 expression was increased, but that of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 was reduced
OsEMF2b	OsVIL2	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	We showed that OsVIL2 physically interacts with OsEMF2b, a component of polycomb repression complex 2
OsEMF2b	OsVIL2	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression
OsLFL1	OsVIL2	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	In osvil2 mutants OsLFL1 expression was increased, but that of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 was reduced
OsLFL1	OsVIL2	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that OsVIL2 was directly associated with OsLFL1 chromatin
OsLFL1	OsVIL2	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	We also observed that H3K27me3 was significantly enriched by OsLFL1 chromatin in the wild type, but that this enrichment was diminished in the osvil2 mutants
OsLFL1	OsVIL2	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	These results indicated that OsVIL2 epigenetically represses OsLFL1 expression

Gn1a|OsCKX2	OsVIL2	Chromatin interacting factor OsVIL2 increases biomass and rice grain yield.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that, among the downregulated genes, OsVIL2 was directly associated with chromatins in the promoter region of CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE2 (OsCKX2), a gene responsible for cytokinin degradation
Gn1a|OsCKX2	OsVIL2	Chromatin interacting factor OsVIL2 increases biomass and rice grain yield.	 We conclude that OsVIL2 improves the production of biomass and grain by suppressing OsCKX2 chromatin
