OsLFL1	OsVIL2	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	We also observed that H3K27me3 was significantly enriched by OsLFL1 chromatin in the wild type, but that this enrichment was diminished in the osvil2 mutants
OsLFL1	OsVIL2	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	These results indicated that OsVIL2 epigenetically represses OsLFL1 expression

Gn1a|OsCKX2	OsVIL2	Chromatin interacting factor OsVIL2 increases biomass and rice grain yield.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that, among the downregulated genes, OsVIL2 was directly associated with chromatins in the promoter region of CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE2 (OsCKX2), a gene responsible for cytokinin degradation
Gn1a|OsCKX2	OsVIL2	Chromatin interacting factor OsVIL2 increases biomass and rice grain yield.	 We conclude that OsVIL2 improves the production of biomass and grain by suppressing OsCKX2 chromatin
OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	OsVIL2	Chromatin Interacting Factor OsVIL2 Is Required for Outgrowth of Axillary Buds in Rice.	 Analysis of the expression patterns of the tiller-related genes revealed that expression of OsTB1, which is a negative regulator of bud outgrowth, was increased in osvil2 mutants
OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	OsVIL2	Chromatin Interacting Factor OsVIL2 Is Required for Outgrowth of Axillary Buds in Rice.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that OsVIL2 binds to the promoter region of OsTB1 chromatin in wild-type rice, but the binding was not observed in osvil2 mutants
OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	OsVIL2	Chromatin Interacting Factor OsVIL2 Is Required for Outgrowth of Axillary Buds in Rice.	 Tiller number of double mutant osvil2 ostb1 was similar to that of ostb1 , suggesting that osvil2 is epistatic to ostb1
