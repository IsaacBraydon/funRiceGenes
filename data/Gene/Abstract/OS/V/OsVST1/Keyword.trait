OsVST1	root	VAP-RELATED SUPPRESSORS OF TOO MANY MOUTHS (VST) family proteins are regulators of root system architecture.	 OsVST1 mutants have shorter primary roots, decreased root meristem size, and a more compact RSA
OsVST1	root	VAP-RELATED SUPPRESSORS OF TOO MANY MOUTHS (VST) family proteins are regulators of root system architecture.	 Expression of OsVST1 largely complements the short root length and reduced plant height in the Arabidopsis triple mutant, supporting conservation of function between rice and Arabidopsis VST proteins
OsVST1	grain	VAP-RELATED SUPPRESSORS OF TOO MANY MOUTHS (VST) family proteins are regulators of root system architecture.	 In a field trial, mutations in OsVST1 did not adversely affect grain yield, suggesting that modulation of this gene could be used as a way to optimize RSA without an inherent yield penalty
