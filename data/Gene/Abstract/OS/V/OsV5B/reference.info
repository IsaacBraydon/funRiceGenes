NA	Differential Regulation of Protochlorophyllide Oxidoreductase Abundances by VIRESCENT 5A (OsV5A) and VIRESCENT 5B (OsV5B) in Rice Seedlings.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	The State Key Laboratory Breeding Base for Sustainable Control of Pest and Disease, China, Institute of Virology and Biotechnology, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou 310021, China School of Biological Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China.	A low-temperature virescent mutant (osv5a) was isolated from a (60)Coγ-irradiated rice (Oryza sativa) population. At early seedling stage, the mutant exhibits chlorosis phenotype with reduced pigment content at a low temperature (22 °C), but it produces green leaves at normal growth temperature (28 °C). Chlorophyll accumulation is gradually restored in the mutant at 22 °C as it is developing into five-leaf stage. Map-based cloning revealed that OsV5A is a J-like protein with four transmembrane domains. A close homolog OsV5B was also identified in the rice genome. Both OsV5A and OsV5B are localized in the chloroplast envelope and thylakoid membranes. We demonstrated that they function as chaperone proteins of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) which catalyzes a light-dependent reaction in the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway. OsV5A and OsV5B interact with two rice PORs (OsPORA and OsPORB) inside chloroplasts and they stabilize OsPORB in vitro under oxidative stress. Differential protein abundances of OsV5A and OsV5B in rice seedlings at different leaf developmental stages were also revealed. OsV5A apparently developed a specialized role for regulating POR abundances at the leaf pre-emergence stage while the same function is performed by OsV5B during leaf emergence and expansion. Deficiency of OsV5A and OsV5B occurred in pre-emerged and emerging leaves in osv5a seedlings at 22 °C, leading to reduced POR accumulation and chlorophyll content. Duplication of V5, which is not common among dicots, may have allowed the diversification of their differential roles in regulating chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice and other grass species.
