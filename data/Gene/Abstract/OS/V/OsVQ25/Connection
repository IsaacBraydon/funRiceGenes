OsPUB73	OsVQ25	A VQ-motif-containing protein fine-tunes rice immunity and growth by a hierarchical regulatory mechanism.	 Here, we report that a rice valine-glutamine (VQ) motif-containing protein, OsVQ25, balances broad-spectrum disease resistance and plant growth by interacting with a U-Box E3 ligase, OsPUB73, and a transcription factor, OsWRKY53

OsVQ25	OsWRKY53	A VQ-motif-containing protein fine-tunes rice immunity and growth by a hierarchical regulatory mechanism.	 Furthermore, OsVQ25 interacts with and suppresses the transcriptional activity of OsWRKY53, a positive regulator of plant immunity
OsVQ25	OsWRKY53	A VQ-motif-containing protein fine-tunes rice immunity and growth by a hierarchical regulatory mechanism.	 OsWRKY53 downstream defense-related genes and brassinosteroid signaling genes are upregulated in osvq25 mutants
