In both yeast and mammals, the major constituent of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport-II (ESCRT-II) is the VPS22/EAP30 protein, which plays an important role in ubiquitin-mediated degradation of membrane proteins through the multivesicular body pathway. However, the functions of ESCRT-II subunits in plants are largely unknown. In this work, we report the genetic analysis and phenotypic characterization of mutants in OsVPS22 gene, which encodes a functional VPS22 homolog in rice. On the basis of a collection of T-DNA lines, we identified a T-DNA insertion mutant, which showed abnormal segregation ratios; we then found that the T-DNA insertion is located within the sixth intron of the OsVPS22 gene. Compared with the wild type, this vps22 mutant exhibited seedling lethality and severe reduction in shoot and root growth. In addition, the vps22 mutant had a chalky endosperm in the grain. In summary, our data suggest that OsVPS22 may be required for seedling viability and grain filling in rice, thus providing a valuable resource for further exploration of the functions of the ESCRTing machinery in plants.
