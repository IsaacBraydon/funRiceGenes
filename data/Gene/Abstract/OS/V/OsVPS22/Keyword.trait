OsVPS22	grain filling	Knockout of the VPS22 component of the ESCRT-II complex in rice (Oryza sativa L.) causes chalky endosperm and early seedling lethality	 In summary, our data suggest that OsVPS22 may be required for seedling viability and grain filling in rice, thus providing a valuable resource for further exploration of the functions of the ESCRTing machinery in plants
