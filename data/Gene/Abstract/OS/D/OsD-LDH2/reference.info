NA	A D-lactate dehydrogenase from rice is involved in conferring tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses by maintaining cellular homeostasis	2020	Sci Rep	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Biology, Faculty of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, South Asian University, Akbar Bhawan, Chanakyapuri, New Delhi, 110021, India.	D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-LDH) converts D-lactate (the end product of glyoxalase system) to pyruvate and thereby completes the detoxification process of methylglyoxal. D-LDH detoxifies and diverts the stress induced toxic metabolites, MG and D-lactate, towards energy production and thus, protects the cell from their deteriorating effects. In this study, a D-LDH enzyme from rice (OsD-LDH2, encoded by Os07g08950.1) was characterized for its role in abiotic stress tolerance. For this, a combination of in silico, molecular, genetic and biochemical approaches was used. The kinetic analysis revealed OsD-LDH2 to be the most efficient D-LDH enzyme in comparison to D-LDHs from other plant species. Heterologous overexpression of OsD-LDH2 provides tolerance against multiple abiotic stresses in E. coli, yeast and plant system. The analysis of D-LDH mutant and OsD-LDH2 overexpressing transgenic plants uncovered the crucial role of D-LDH in mitigation of abiotic stresses. OsD-LDH2 overexpressing plants maintained lower level of ROS and other toxic metabolites along with better functioning of antioxidant system. This is the first report on correlation of D-LDH with multiple abiotic stress tolerance. Overall, OsD-LDH2 emerged as a promising candidate which can open a new direction for engineering stress tolerant crop varieties by maintaining their growth and yield in unfavorable conditions.
