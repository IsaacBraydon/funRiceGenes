OsdNK2	plant growth	WHITE STRIPE LEAF8, encoding a deoxyribonucleoside kinase, is involved in chloroplast development in rice.	 In particular, the expression levels of OsdNK2 in mature leaves, stems, sheathes, and panicles were much higher than WSL8 (Fig. 7a), suggesting OsdNK2 might play a major role in the later stages of plant growth.
