NA	Gene expression analysis, subcellular localization, and in planta antimicrobial activity of rice (Oryza sativa L.) defensin 7 and 8.	2018	Plant Physiol Biochem	Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.	Defensins are a group of plant antimicrobial peptides. In a previous study, it was reported that two recombinant rice (Oryza sativa L.) defensin (OsDEF) genes (OsDEF7 and OsDEF8) produced heterologously by bacteria inhibited the growth of several phytopathogen. Here, we analyzed gene expression patterns in Thai jasmine rice (O. sativa L. ssp. indica 'KDML 105') using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and compared them with those in Japanese rice (O. sativa L. ssp. japonica 'Nipponbare'). Although the cultivars exhibited similar gene expression patterns at the developmental stages examined, the expression levels differed between organs. Upon Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae infection in the leaves, both OsDEFs were highly upregulated at 8 days post-infection, suggesting that they play a role in pathogen defense. Moreover, in silico analyses revealed that OsDEF expression levels were affected by drought, cold, imbibition, anoxia, and dehydration stress. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions, we found that both OsDEFs were in the extracellular compartment, confirming their functions against pathogen infection. However, when recombinant OsDEFs (without GFP) were produced in tobacco BY-2<U+202F>cells or Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, they could not be detected in either the culture medium or the cells. Yet, N. benthamiana leaves infiltrated with OsDEF7 or OsDEF8 constructs exhibited in planta inhibitory activity against the phytopathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. glycines, suggesting that recombinant OsDEFs were present. Additionally, when targeting them to the ER compartment, recombinant OsDEFs could be detected. Lower inhibitory activity was observed when recombinant OsDEFs were targeted to the ER. These results suggest that OsDEFs play a role in controlling plant diseases.
NA	A defensin-like protein drives cadmium efflux and allocation in rice.	2018	Nat Commun	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics and CAS center for excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200032, China.	Pollution by heavy metals limits the area of land available for cultivation of food crops. A potential solution to this problem might lie in the molecular breeding of food crops for phytoremediation that accumulate toxic metals in straw while producing safe and nutritious grains. Here, we identify a rice quantitative trait locus we name cadmium (Cd) accumulation in leaf 1 (CAL1), which encodes a defensin-like protein. CAL1 is expressed preferentially in root exodermis and xylem parenchyma cells. We provide evidence that CAL1 acts by chelating Cd in the cytosol and facilitating Cd secretion to extracellular spaces, hence lowering cytosolic Cd concentration while driving long-distance Cd transport via xylem vessels. CAL1 does not appear to affect Cd accumulation in rice grains or the accumulation of other essential metals, thus providing an efficient molecular tool to breed dual-function rice varieties that produce safe grains while remediating paddy soils.
NA	Rice Defensin OsAFP1 is a New Drug Candidate against Human Pathogenic Fungi.	2018	Sci Rep	Department of Materials Science and Technology, Faculty of Engineering, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan. ottie@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp.	Fungal infections, such as candidiasis and aspergillosis, are some of the most frequent infections in humans. Although antifungal drugs are available for the treatment of these infections, antifungal agents with new mechanisms of action should be developed because of the increasing incidence of drug-resistant pathogens in recent years. In this study, a basic functional analysis of rice defensin OsAFP1, a novel antifungal drug candidate, was conducted. OsAFP1 exerted fungicidal activity against Candida albicans, the most common pathogenic fungus in humans, at 4<U+2009>¶ÃM concentration, but it did not inhibit the growth of human pathogenic bacteria. In addition, OsAFP1 retained structural stability after heat treatment at 100<U+2009>°„C for 10<U+2009>min and after serum treatment at 37<U+2009>°„C for 24<U+2009>h. A propidium iodide (PI) uptake assay and mutational analysis revealed that amino acid residues within the C-terminal ¶√-core motif of OsAFP1, particularly Leu-39 and Lys-41, play an important role in its antifungal activity. Further, PI uptake and apoptosis assays suggested that OsAFP1 exerts its antifungal activity by inducing apoptosis of target cells. Immunohistochemistry showed that the OsAFP1 target molecule was located in the cell wall. These findings indicate that OsAFP1 may be developed into a potent antifungal drug.
NA	Partial peptides from rice defensin OsAFP1 exhibited antifungal activity against the rice blast pathogen Pyricularia oryzae.	2017	J Pestic Sci	Hokkaido Agricultural Research Center, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization.	Rice blast caused by Pyricularia oryzae is one of the most devastating diseases worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the antifungal activity of rice defensin OsAFP1 and its partial peptides against P. oryzae. The partial peptides near the N- and C-terminal regions of OsAFP1 exhibited approximately the same antifungal activity as the entire protein against P. oryzae. These partial peptides have the potential to be used as fungicides.
