OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	xylem	A defensin-like protein drives cadmium efflux and allocation in rice.	 CAL1 is expressed preferentially in root exodermis and xylem parenchyma cells
OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	xylem	A defensin-like protein drives cadmium efflux and allocation in rice.	 We provide evidence that CAL1 acts by chelating Cd in the cytosol and facilitating Cd secretion to extracellular spaces, hence lowering cytosolic Cd concentration while driving long-distance Cd transport via xylem vessels
OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	root	A defensin-like protein drives cadmium efflux and allocation in rice.	 CAL1 is expressed preferentially in root exodermis and xylem parenchyma cells
OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	xylem parenchyma	A defensin-like protein drives cadmium efflux and allocation in rice.	 CAL1 is expressed preferentially in root exodermis and xylem parenchyma cells
