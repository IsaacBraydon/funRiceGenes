OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	xylem	A defensin-like protein drives cadmium efflux and allocation in rice.	 CAL1 is expressed preferentially in root exodermis and xylem parenchyma cells
OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	xylem	A defensin-like protein drives cadmium efflux and allocation in rice.	 We provide evidence that CAL1 acts by chelating Cd in the cytosol and facilitating Cd secretion to extracellular spaces, hence lowering cytosolic Cd concentration while driving long-distance Cd transport via xylem vessels
OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	root	A defensin-like protein drives cadmium efflux and allocation in rice.	 CAL1 is expressed preferentially in root exodermis and xylem parenchyma cells
OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	xylem parenchyma	A defensin-like protein drives cadmium efflux and allocation in rice.	 CAL1 is expressed preferentially in root exodermis and xylem parenchyma cells
OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	growth	Rice Defensin OsAFP1 is a New Drug Candidate against Human Pathogenic Fungi.	 OsAFP1 exerted fungicidal activity against Candida albicans, the most common pathogenic fungus in humans, at 4<U+2009>¦ÌM concentration, but it did not inhibit the growth of human pathogenic bacteria
OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	cell wall	Rice Defensin OsAFP1 is a New Drug Candidate against Human Pathogenic Fungi.	 Immunohistochemistry showed that the OsAFP1 target molecule was located in the cell wall
OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	Pi	Rice Defensin OsAFP1 is a New Drug Candidate against Human Pathogenic Fungi.	 Further, PI uptake and apoptosis assays suggested that OsAFP1 exerts its antifungal activity by inducing apoptosis of target cells
OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	 pi 	Rice Defensin OsAFP1 is a New Drug Candidate against Human Pathogenic Fungi.	 Further, PI uptake and apoptosis assays suggested that OsAFP1 exerts its antifungal activity by inducing apoptosis of target cells
OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	Pi uptake	Rice Defensin OsAFP1 is a New Drug Candidate against Human Pathogenic Fungi.	 Further, PI uptake and apoptosis assays suggested that OsAFP1 exerts its antifungal activity by inducing apoptosis of target cells
