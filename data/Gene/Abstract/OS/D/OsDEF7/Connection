CAL2	OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	Overexpression of a Defensin-Like Gene CAL2 Enhances Cadmium Accumulation in Plants.	 CAL2 shared 66% similarity with CAL1, and its mRNA accumulation is mainly observed in roots and is unaffected by Cd stress, but its transcription level was lower than that of CAL1 based on the relative expression of CAL2/Actin1 observed in this study and that reported previously
OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	OsNRAMP5	Effects of Fe and Mn cations on Cd uptake by rice plant in hydroponic culture experiment	 Fe, Mn, and Cd transporters such as CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, OsHMA3, and OsNAAT1 regulate uptake of Cd in rice
OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	OsNRAMP5	Effects of Fe and Mn cations on Cd uptake by rice plant in hydroponic culture experiment	 Meanwhile, application of sufficient doses of Fe and Cd in solution culture increased RE of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, and OsNAAT1 in roots, whereas expression level of OsHMA3 was decreased
OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	OsNRAMP5	Effects of Fe and Mn cations on Cd uptake by rice plant in hydroponic culture experiment	 Similarly, expression level of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, and OsNRAMP1 significantly increased in roots in high Cd and Mn deficient treatments
OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	OsNRAMP5	Effects of Fe and Mn cations on Cd uptake by rice plant in hydroponic culture experiment	 This may be concluded that the Cd increases expression of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, and OsNAAT1 but decreases OsHMA3 expression in rice roots, which resulted in increased Cd uptake in hydroponically grown rice
