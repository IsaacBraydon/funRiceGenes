OsDMC1|DMC1B|OsDMC1B	meiosis	Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.	These biochemical differences between the DMC1A and DMC1B proteins may provide important insight into their functional differences during meiosis in rice
OsDMC1|DMC1B|OsDMC1B	meiotic	OsDMC1 is not required for homologous pairing in rice meiosis.	Moreover, OsDMC1 was not detected in pairing-defective mutants, such as pair2, pair3, Oscom1 and Osrad51c, while it was loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in zep1, Osmer3, Oszip4 and Oshei10
OsDMC1|DMC1B|OsDMC1B	crossover	OsDMC1 is not required for homologous pairing in rice meiosis.	The reduced number of bivalents and abnormal OsHEI10 foci in Osdmc1a Osdmc1b establishes an essential role for OsDMC1 in crossover formation
OsDMC1|DMC1B|OsDMC1B	meiosis	Rice OsBRCA2 Is Required for DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Meiotic Cells	 These results indicate that OsBRCA2 is essential for facilitating the loading of OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 onto resected ends of programmed double-strand breaks (DSB) during meiosis to promote single-end invasions of homologous chromosomes and accurate recombination
