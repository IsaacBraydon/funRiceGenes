Using degenerate primers designed according to amino acid motifs conserved in yeast Dmc1 and Arabidopsis AtDmc1, we obtained full-length cDNA of a rice homologue of the DMC1 gene (OsDMC1) by RT-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACEs). OsDmc1 exhibited 53% amino acid sequence identity to yeast Dmc1 and 81% to AtDmc1. OsDMC1 was expressed at high-levels in reproductive organs, low-levels in roots, and undetectable levels in leaves and seedlings. Southern blot analyses revealed that OsDMC1 is one of two DMC1 homologues present in rice.

Rad51 and disrupted meiotic cDNA1 (Dmc1) are the two eukaryotic DNA recombinases that participate in homology search and strand exchange reactions during homologous recombination mediated DNA repair. Rad51 expresses in both mitotic and meiotic tissues whereas Dmc1 is confined to meiosis. DNA binding and pairing activities of Oryza sativa disrupted meiotic cDNA1 (OsDmc1) from rice have been reported earlier. In the present study, DNA renaturation and strand exchange activities of OsDmc1 have been studied, in real time and without the steps of deproteinization, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The extent as well as the rate of renaturation is the highest in conditions that contain ATP, but significantly less when ATP is replaced by slowly hydrolysable analogues of ATP, namely adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido) triphosphate (AMP-PNP) or adenosine 5'-O-(3-thio triphosphate) (ATP-gamma-S), where the former was substantially poorer than the latter in facilitating the renaturation function. FRET assay results also revealed OsDmc1 protein concentration dependent strand exchange function, where the activity was the fastest in the presence of ATP, whereas in the absence of a nucleotide cofactor it was several fold ( approximately 15-fold) slower. Interestingly, strand exchange, in reactions where ATP was replaced with AMP-PNP or ATP-gamma-S, was somewhat slower than that of even minus nucleotide cofactor control. Notwithstanding the slow rates, the reactions with no nucleotide cofactor or with ATP-analogues did reach the same steady state level as seen in ATP reaction. FRET changes were unaffected by the steps of deproteinization following OsDmc1 reaction, suggesting that the assay results reflected stable events involving exchanges of homologous DNA strands. All these results, put together, suggest that OsDmc1 catalyses homologous renaturation as well as strand exchange events where ATP hydrolysis seems to critically decide the rates of the reaction system. These studies open up new facets of a plant recombinase function in relation to the role of ATP hydrolysis.

A cloned cDNA corresponding to OsDMC1 from rice anther tissue was expressed in Escherichia coli. The OsDmc1 protein was largely present in the inclusion bodies of the cell lysatE., which was solubilized by 8.0 M urea containing buffeR., purified to homogeneity by Ni-CAM agarose column chromatography, followed by renaturation to its native state through stepwise dialysis against reduced concentrations of urea. The purified protein cross-reacted with anti-yeast Dmc1 antibodies. The binding efficiency observed with circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was similar to that with circular double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The binding to either DNA showed no ATP dependencE., but required 5-10 mM Mg2+ in the presence of ATP. Even though the protein binding to dsDNA was as efficient as it was to ssDNA, the former induced no DNA dependent ATPasE., whereas the binding to ssDNA stimulated a significant level of DNA dependent ATPase activity. OsDmc1-ssDNA complex, with its ATPase proficiency, also mediated renaturation of homologous complementary strands as well as assimilation of single strands into homologous supercoiled duplexes leading to D-loop formation. The D-loop formation was lowered by excess of OsDmc1 protein. This D-loop formation activity was promoted by non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP and was not observed in absence of ATP or presence of ADP/ATP-gamma-S. These properties reflected the classical hallmarks of a recombinase and represented the first biochemical characterization of a plant Dmc1 protein.

OsDMC1 is the rice homologue of the yeast DMC1 gene. Here, we analyzed the function of OsDMC1 in meiosis using an RNA interference approach. The OsDMC1-RNAi lines grew normally during their vegetative phase but showed spikelet and pollen sterility. The sterility phenotypes were associated with down-regulated OsDMC1 transcript and protein levels mediated by RNAi. Further cytological observations of male meiocytes revealed that knock-down of OsDMC1 led to defects in bivalent formation and subsequent unequal chromosome segregation and irregular spore generation, and induced changes in male meiotic progression. Fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments revealed that the OsDMC1-RNAi lines were defective in homologous pairing. These data indicate that OsDMC1 is essential for rice meiosis and plays an important role in homologous pairing.
NA	Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.	2008	Nucleic Acids Res	Consolidated Research Institute for Advanced Science and Medical Care, Waseda University, 513 Wasedatsurumaki-cho, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 162-0041, Japan.	The DMC1 protein, a meiosis-specific DNA recombinase, catalyzes strand exchange between homologous chromosomes. In rice, two Dmc1 genes, Dmc1A and Dmc1B, have been reported. Although the Oryza sativa DMC1A protein has been partially characterized, however the biochemical properties of the DMC1B protein have not been defined. In the present study, we expressed the Oryza sativa DMC1A and DMC1B proteins in bacteria and purified them. The purified DMC1A and DMC1B proteins formed helical filaments along single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and promoted robust strand exchange between ssDNA and dsDNA over five thousand base pairs in the presence of RPA, as a co-factor. The DMC1A and DMC1B proteins also promoted strand exchange in the absence of RPA with long DNA substrates containing several thousand base pairs. In contrast, the human DMC1 protein strictly required RPA to promote strand exchange with these long DNA substrates. The strand-exchange activity of the Oryza sativa DMC1A protein was much higher than that of the DMC1B protein. Consistently, the DNA-binding activity of the DMC1A protein was higher than that of the DMC1B protein. These biochemical differences between the DMC1A and DMC1B proteins may provide important insight into their functional differences during meiosis in rice.
