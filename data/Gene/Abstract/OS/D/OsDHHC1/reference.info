NA	Plant architecture and grain yield are regulated by the novel DHHC-type zinc finger protein genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2016	Plant Science	College of Bioscience and Biotechnology of Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha 410018, Hunan, China	In many plants, architecture and grain yield are affected by both the environment and genetics. In rice, the tiller is a vital factor impacting plant architecture and regulated by many genes. In this study, we cloned a novel DHHC-type zinc finger protein gene Os02g0819100 and its alternative splice variant OsDHHC1 from the cDNA of rice (Oryza sativa L.), which regulate plant architecture by altering the tiller in rice. The tillers increased by about 40% when this type of DHHC-type zinc finger protein gene was over-expressed in Zhong Hua 11 (ZH11) rice plants. Moreover, the grain yield of transgenic rice increased approximately by 10% compared with wild-type ZH11. These findings provide an important genetic engineering approach for increasing rice yields.
NA	Increasing branch and seed yield through heterologous expression of the novel rice S-acyl transferase gene OsPAT15 in Brassica napus L.	2018	Breed Sci	Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, 410004, Changsha, China.	Branching is a predominant element in the plant architecture of Brassica napus L. and represents an important determinant of seed yield. OsPAT15 (OsDHHC1), a novel DHHC-type zinc finger protein gene, was reported to regulate rice plant architecture by altering the tillering. However, whether heterologous overexpression of the OsPAT15 gene from the monocot rice into the dicot B. napus L. would have the same effect on branching or seed yield is unknown. In this study, the DHHC-type zinc finger protein gene OsPAT15 was determined to have sulfur acyl transferase activity in the akr1жд yeast mutant in a complementation experiment. Heterologously expressing OsPAT15 transgenic B. napus L. plants were obtained using the Agrobacterium-mediated floral-dip transformation method. As anticipated, OsPAT15 transgenic plants exhibited branching and seed yield. Compared with non-transgenic plants, OsPAT15 transgenic plants had increased primary branches (1.58-1.76-fold) and siliques (1.86-1.89-fold), resulting in a significant increase in seed yield (around 2.39-2.51-fold). Therefore, overexpression of the sulfur acyl transferase gene OsPAT15 in B. napus L. could be used to increase seed yield and produce excellent varieties.
