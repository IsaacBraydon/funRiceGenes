OsDREB1C	nitrogen	A transcriptional regulator that boosts grain yields and shortens the growth duration of rice.	 We show that OsDREB1C drives functionally diverse transcriptional programs determining photosynthetic capacity, nitrogen utilization, and flowering time
OsDREB1C	nitrogen utilization	A transcriptional regulator that boosts grain yields and shortens the growth duration of rice.	 We show that OsDREB1C drives functionally diverse transcriptional programs determining photosynthetic capacity, nitrogen utilization, and flowering time
OsDREB1C	flowering time	A transcriptional regulator that boosts grain yields and shortens the growth duration of rice.	 We show that OsDREB1C drives functionally diverse transcriptional programs determining photosynthetic capacity, nitrogen utilization, and flowering time
OsDREB1C	flowering	A transcriptional regulator that boosts grain yields and shortens the growth duration of rice.	 We show that OsDREB1C drives functionally diverse transcriptional programs determining photosynthetic capacity, nitrogen utilization, and flowering time
OsDREB1C	N utilization	A transcriptional regulator that boosts grain yields and shortens the growth duration of rice.	 We show that OsDREB1C drives functionally diverse transcriptional programs determining photosynthetic capacity, nitrogen utilization, and flowering time
