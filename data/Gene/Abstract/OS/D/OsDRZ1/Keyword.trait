OsDRZ1	growth	A zinc finger transcriptional repressor confers pleiotropic effects on rice growth and drought tolerance by down-regulating stress-responsive genes.	 Moreover overexpression of OsDRZ1 did not lead to growth inhibition but the promotion of rice growth, implying the potential application prospective of OsDRZ1 in engineering drought tolerant crops
OsDRZ1	seedling	A zinc finger transcriptional repressor confers pleiotropic effects on rice growth and drought tolerance by down-regulating stress-responsive genes.	 Overexpression of OsDRZ1 in rice increased seedling drought tolerance and the transgenic plants appeared to accumulate more free proline and less reactive oxygen species (ROS), and elevate the activities of antioxidant enzymes
OsDRZ1	drought	A zinc finger transcriptional repressor confers pleiotropic effects on rice growth and drought tolerance by down-regulating stress-responsive genes.	 Overexpression of OsDRZ1 in rice increased seedling drought tolerance and the transgenic plants appeared to accumulate more free proline and less reactive oxygen species (ROS), and elevate the activities of antioxidant enzymes
OsDRZ1	drought	A zinc finger transcriptional repressor confers pleiotropic effects on rice growth and drought tolerance by down-regulating stress-responsive genes.	 In contrast, RNA interference (RNAi) of OsDRZ1 led to lower activities of antioxidative response and more sensitivity to drought
OsDRZ1	drought	A zinc finger transcriptional repressor confers pleiotropic effects on rice growth and drought tolerance by down-regulating stress-responsive genes.	 RNA-seq analysis revealed that the genes down-regulated by OsDRZ1 were mostly down-regulated by drought, implying the critical role of OsDRZ1 in modulating drought responsive gene expression

Moreover overexpression of OsDRZ1 did not lead to growth inhibition but the promotion of rice growth, implying the potential application prospective of OsDRZ1 in engineering drought tolerant crops
OsDRZ1	tolerance	A zinc finger transcriptional repressor confers pleiotropic effects on rice growth and drought tolerance by down-regulating stress-responsive genes.	 Overexpression of OsDRZ1 in rice increased seedling drought tolerance and the transgenic plants appeared to accumulate more free proline and less reactive oxygen species (ROS), and elevate the activities of antioxidant enzymes
OsDRZ1	abiotic stress	A zinc finger transcriptional repressor confers pleiotropic effects on rice growth and drought tolerance by down-regulating stress-responsive genes.	 OsDRZ1 was expressed throughout all tissues examined and could be induced by multiple abiotic stresses
OsDRZ1	drought tolerance	A zinc finger transcriptional repressor confers pleiotropic effects on rice growth and drought tolerance by down-regulating stress-responsive genes.	 Overexpression of OsDRZ1 in rice increased seedling drought tolerance and the transgenic plants appeared to accumulate more free proline and less reactive oxygen species (ROS), and elevate the activities of antioxidant enzymes
OsDRZ1	nucleus	A zinc finger transcriptional repressor confers pleiotropic effects on rice growth and drought tolerance by down-regulating stress-responsive genes.	 OsDRZ1 protein was localized mostly in nucleus
OsDRZ1	biotic stress	A zinc finger transcriptional repressor confers pleiotropic effects on rice growth and drought tolerance by down-regulating stress-responsive genes.	 OsDRZ1 was expressed throughout all tissues examined and could be induced by multiple abiotic stresses
OsDRZ1	transcriptional activator	A zinc finger transcriptional repressor confers pleiotropic effects on rice growth and drought tolerance by down-regulating stress-responsive genes.	 Unlike most reported rice ZFPs functioning as transcriptional activators, OsDRZ1 is a transcriptional repressor
OsDRZ1	reactive oxygen species	A zinc finger transcriptional repressor confers pleiotropic effects on rice growth and drought tolerance by down-regulating stress-responsive genes.	 Overexpression of OsDRZ1 in rice increased seedling drought tolerance and the transgenic plants appeared to accumulate more free proline and less reactive oxygen species (ROS), and elevate the activities of antioxidant enzymes
