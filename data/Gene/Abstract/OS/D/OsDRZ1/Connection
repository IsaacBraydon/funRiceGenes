OsDRZ1	OsGLP1	A zinc finger transcriptional repressor confers pleiotropic effects on rice growth and drought tolerance by down-regulating stress-responsive genes.	 A cupin gene OsGLP1 (germin-like protein1) was identified as one of the potential target genes of OsDRZ1, as suggested by real-time PCR and transient expression analysis in rice protoplast
