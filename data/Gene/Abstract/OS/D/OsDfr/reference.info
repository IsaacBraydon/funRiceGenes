The role of the regulatory gene OsC1-Myb, encoding a MYB class of transcription activators in the stress-induced expression of the structural genes, OsDfr and OsAns, was analyzed. Northern analysis of shoot tissues of rice, Nagina 22, (Oryza sativa L. sub sp. indica) seedlings under dehydration stress or high salt or abscisic acid (ABA) showed a significant enhancement of transcript level and/or transcript stability of OsDfr and OsAns. Enhanced levels of the OsC1-myb transcript were also detected. The expression pattern of these three genes indicates that the stress responsive accumulation of OsDfr and OsAns transcripts is mediated by the transcription factor, OsC1-MYB. The 5' upstream region of the OsDfr and OsAns genes carry several regulatory domains, which share homology with some of the known stress responsive genes in plants. In addition, several putative myb and myc responsive domains were identified in the promoter region of the genes, OsDfr and OsAns. The recombinant OsC1-MYB protein binds in vitro to the myb responsive elements (MREs) in the OsDfr and OsAns promoters, suggesting that it is a potential transcription activator of stress-induced expression of structural genes of the flavonoid pathway.
NA	The C-S-A gene system regulates hull pigmentation and reveals evolution of anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in rice.	2018	J Exp Bot	Key Laboratory of Crop Heterosis and Utilization, Ministry of Education/ Beijing Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Department of Plant Genetics and Breeding, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.	Floral organs in rice (Oryza sativa) can be purple, brown or red in color due to the accumulation of flavonoids. But the molecular mechanism underlying specific organ pigmentation is not clear. Here, we propose a C-S-A gene model for rice hull pigmentation and characterize through genetic, molecular and metabolomic approaches. Further we conduct phylogenetic studies to reveal the evolution of rice color. In this gene system, C1 encodes a R2R3-MYB transcription factor and acts as a color-producing gene and S1 encodes a bHLH protein that functions in a tissue-specific manner. C1 interacts with S1 and activate expression of A1 which encoding a dihydro-flavonol reductase (DFR). As a consequence, the hull is purple whereby functional A1 participation leads to high accumulation of cyanidin 3-O-glucoside. Loss of function of A1 leads to brown hull color due to accumulation of flavonoids such as hesperetin 5-O-glucoside, rutin and delphinidin 3-O-rutinoside. It shows different evolutionary pathway of rice color in japonica and indica, supporting independent origin of cultivars in each subspecies. Our findings give complete perspectives on gene regulation network of rice color formation and supply theoretical basis for extended application of this beneficial trait.
NA	Plasma membrane H +-ATPase overexpression increases rice yield via simultaneous enhancement of nutrient uptake and photosynthesis	2021	Nat Commun	Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Solid Organic Waste Resource Utilization, College of Resources and Environment Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) are essential elements for plant growth and crop yield. Thus, improved N and C utilisation contributes to agricultural productivity and reduces the need for fertilisation. In the present study, we find that overexpression of a single rice gene, Oryza sativa plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase 1 (OSA1), facilitates ammonium absorption and assimilation in roots and enhanced light-induced stomatal opening with higher photosynthesis rate in leaves. As a result, OSA1 overexpression in rice plants causes a 33% increase in grain yield and a 46% increase in N use efficiency overall. As PM H+-ATPase is highly conserved in plants, these findings indicate that the manipulation of PM H+-ATPase could cooperatively improve N and C utilisation, potentially providing a vital tool for food security and sustainable agriculture.
