NA	Dynamic genome-wide association analysis and identification of candidate genes involved in anaerobic germination tolerance in rice	2021	Rice (N Y)	National Engineering Research Center of Plant Space Breeding, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Background: In Asian rice production, an increasing number of countries now choose the direct seeding mode because of rising costs, labour shortages and water shortages. The ability of rice seeds to undergo anaerobic germination (AG) plays an important role in the success of direct seeding.  Results: In this study, we used 2,123,725 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers based on resequencing to conduct a dynamic genome-wide association study (GWAS) of coleoptile length (CL) and coleoptile diameter (CD) in 209 natural rice populations. A total of 26 SNP loci were detected in these two phenotypes, of which 5 overlapped with previously reported loci (S1_ 39674301, S6_ 20797781, S7_ 18722403, S8_ 9946213, S11_ 19165397), and two sites were detected repeatedly at different time points (S3_ 24689629 and S5_ 27918754). We suggest that these 7 loci (-log10 (P) value > 7.3271) are the key sites that affect AG tolerance. To screen the candidate genes more effectively, we sequenced the transcriptome of the flooding-tolerant variety R151 in six key stages, including anaerobic (AN) and the oxygen conversion point (AN-A), and obtained high-quality differential expression profiles. Four reliable candidate genes were identified: Os01g0911700 (OsVP1), Os05g0560900 (OsGA2ox8), Os05g0562200 (OsDi19-1) and Os06g0548200. Then qRT-PCR and LC-MS/ MS targeting metabolite detection technology were used to further verify that the up-regulated expression of these four candidate genes was closely related to AG.  Conclusion: The four novel candidate genes were associated with gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) regulation and cell wall metabolism under oxygen-deficiency conditions and promoted coleoptile elongation while avoiding adverse effects, allowing the coleoptile to obtain oxygen, escape the low-oxygen environment and germinate rapidly. The results of this study improve our understanding of the genetic basis of AG in rice seeds, which is conducive to the selection of flooding-tolerant varieties suitable for direct seeding.
NA	A comprehensive transcriptome analysis of contrasting rice cultivars highlights the role of auxin and ABA responsive genes in heat stress response	2021	Genomics	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.	Sensing a change in ambient temperature is key to survival among all living organisms. Temperature fluctuations due to climate change are a matter of grave concern since it adversely affects growth and eventually the yield of crop plants, including two of the major cereals, i.e., rice and wheat. Thus, to understand the response of rice seedlings to elevated temperatures, we performed microarray-based transcriptome analysis of two contrasting rice cultivars, Annapurna (heat tolerant) and IR64 (heat susceptible), by subjecting their seedlings to 37 °„C and 42 °„C, sequentially. The transcriptome analyses revealed a set of uniquely regulated genes and related pathways in red rice cultivar Annapurna, particularly associated with auxin and ABA as a part of heat stress response in rice. The changes in expression of few auxin and ABA associated genes, such as OsIAA13, OsIAA20, ILL8, OsbZIP12, OsPP2C51, OsDi19-1 and OsHOX24, among others, were validated under high-temperature conditions using RT-qPCR. In particular, the expression of auxin-inducible SAUR genes was enhanced considerably at both elevated temperatures. Further, using genes that expressed inversely under heat vs. cold temperature conditions, we built a regulatory network between transcription factors (TF) such as HSFs, NAC, WRKYs, bHLHs or bZIPs and their target gene pairs and determined regulatory coordination in their expression under varying temperature conditions. Our work thus provides useful insights into temperature-responsive genes, particularly under elevated temperature conditions, and could serve as a resource of candidate genes associated with thermotolerance or downstream components of temperature sensors in rice.
