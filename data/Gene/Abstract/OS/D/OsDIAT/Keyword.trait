OsDIAT	drought	DROUGHT-INDUCED BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID AMINOTRANSFERASE enhances drought tolerance in rice.	 OsDIAT-overexpressing (OsDIATOX) plants were more tolerant to drought stress, whereas osdiat plants were more susceptible to drought stress compared to non-transgenic (NT) plants
OsDIAT	drought	DROUGHT-INDUCED BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID AMINOTRANSFERASE enhances drought tolerance in rice.	 Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDIAT mediates drought tolerance by promoting the accumulation of BCAAs
OsDIAT	stress	DROUGHT-INDUCED BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID AMINOTRANSFERASE enhances drought tolerance in rice.	 The expression of OsDIAT was induced in plants upon exposure to abiotic stress
OsDIAT	stress	DROUGHT-INDUCED BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID AMINOTRANSFERASE enhances drought tolerance in rice.	 OsDIAT-overexpressing (OsDIATOX) plants were more tolerant to drought stress, whereas osdiat plants were more susceptible to drought stress compared to non-transgenic (NT) plants
OsDIAT	drought stress	DROUGHT-INDUCED BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID AMINOTRANSFERASE enhances drought tolerance in rice.	 OsDIAT-overexpressing (OsDIATOX) plants were more tolerant to drought stress, whereas osdiat plants were more susceptible to drought stress compared to non-transgenic (NT) plants
OsDIAT	drought stress 	DROUGHT-INDUCED BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID AMINOTRANSFERASE enhances drought tolerance in rice.	 OsDIAT-overexpressing (OsDIATOX) plants were more tolerant to drought stress, whereas osdiat plants were more susceptible to drought stress compared to non-transgenic (NT) plants
OsDIAT	tolerance	DROUGHT-INDUCED BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID AMINOTRANSFERASE enhances drought tolerance in rice.	 Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDIAT mediates drought tolerance by promoting the accumulation of BCAAs
OsDIAT	abiotic stress	DROUGHT-INDUCED BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID AMINOTRANSFERASE enhances drought tolerance in rice.	 The expression of OsDIAT was induced in plants upon exposure to abiotic stress
OsDIAT	drought tolerance	DROUGHT-INDUCED BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID AMINOTRANSFERASE enhances drought tolerance in rice.	 Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDIAT mediates drought tolerance by promoting the accumulation of BCAAs
OsDIAT	biotic stress	DROUGHT-INDUCED BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID AMINOTRANSFERASE enhances drought tolerance in rice.	 The expression of OsDIAT was induced in plants upon exposure to abiotic stress
OsDIAT	cytoplasm	DROUGHT-INDUCED BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID AMINOTRANSFERASE enhances drought tolerance in rice.	 An in vitro enzyme activity assay indicated that OsDIAT is a branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT), and subcellular localization analysis revealed that OsDIAT localizes to the cytoplasm
