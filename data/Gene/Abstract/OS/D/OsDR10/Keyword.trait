OsDR10	defense response	A rice gene of de novo origin negatively regulates pathogen-induced defense response.	A rice gene of de novo origin negatively regulates pathogen-induced defense response.
OsDR10	bacterial blight disease	A rice gene of de novo origin negatively regulates pathogen-induced defense response.	Biologic analyses including gene silencing, pathologic analysis, and mutant characterization by transformation showed that the OsDR10-suppressed plants enhanced resistance to a broad spectrum of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strains, which cause bacterial blight disease.
