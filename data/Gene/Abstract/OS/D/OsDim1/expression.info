OsDim1	The expression pattern of OsDim1 in rice and its proposed function. |  In contrast, overexpression of OsDim1 showed significant growth in embryonic roots and shoots, while it increased culm length, total number of tillers per plant, seed setting rate, and total number of grains per panicle compared to its wild type line	 In contrast, overexpression of OsDim1 showed significant growth in embryonic roots and shoots, while it increased culm length, total number of tillers per plant, seed setting rate, and total number of grains per panicle compared to its wild type line	 According to the present study findings, RNAi mediated knockdown of OsDim1 resulted in phytohormonal imbalance, reduced amylase activity, affected differentiation of embryonic root elongation zone tissues, suppressed embryonic root and shoot growth, and impaired pollen tube elongation
