OsDim1	root	The expression pattern of OsDim1 in rice and its proposed function.	 According to the present study findings, RNAi mediated knockdown of OsDim1 resulted in phytohormonal imbalance, reduced amylase activity, affected differentiation of embryonic root elongation zone tissues, suppressed embryonic root and shoot growth, and impaired pollen tube elongation
OsDim1	growth	The expression pattern of OsDim1 in rice and its proposed function.	 In contrast, overexpression of OsDim1 showed significant growth in embryonic roots and shoots, while it increased culm length, total number of tillers per plant, seed setting rate, and total number of grains per panicle compared to its wild type line
OsDim1	growth	The expression pattern of OsDim1 in rice and its proposed function.	 In summary, we propose OsDim1 plays an important role in seedling growth and pollen tube elongation, and has pleiotropic effects on reproductive tissues
OsDim1	shoot	The expression pattern of OsDim1 in rice and its proposed function.	 According to the present study findings, RNAi mediated knockdown of OsDim1 resulted in phytohormonal imbalance, reduced amylase activity, affected differentiation of embryonic root elongation zone tissues, suppressed embryonic root and shoot growth, and impaired pollen tube elongation
OsDim1	pollen	The expression pattern of OsDim1 in rice and its proposed function.	 The findings presented in this paper suggest that OsDim1 is important in early seedling development, pollen tube elongation, and impacts rice yield components
OsDim1	pollen	The expression pattern of OsDim1 in rice and its proposed function.
