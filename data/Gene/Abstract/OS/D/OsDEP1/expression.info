DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	 In this study, we generated transgenic Akitakomati plants by overexpressing dep1 and analyzed the carbon-nitrogen metabolic status, gene expression profiles, and grain yield and quality |  Under either low or high nitrogen growth conditions, the carbon-nitrogen metabolic balance of dep1-overexpressed lines was broken in stem sheaths and leaves but not in grains; the dep1-overexpressed plants showed higher expressions of glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate synthase (GOGAT) genes than the wildtype, along with increased total nitrogen and soluble protein content in the straw at maturity
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	Enhanced Expression of QTL qLL9/DEP1 Facilitates the Improvement of Leaf Morphology and Grain Yield in Rice.
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	 Additionally, the expression of several essential genes encoding enzymes catalyzing sucrose metabolism and starch biosynthesis is higher in the DEP1/qPE9-1 line than in the dep1/qpe9-1 line, especially from the mid to late grain-filling stage |  Exogenous application of auxin or cytokinin enhanced the starch accumulation and the expression of genes encoding grain-filling-related enzymes in the grains of dep1/qpe9-1, whereas ABA produced no effects |  Based on these results, we conclude that DEP1/qPE9-1 positively regulates starch accumulation primarily through auxin and cytokinin, which enhance the expression of genes encoding starch biosynthesis during the mid to late grain-filling stage, resulting in increased duration of the grain-filling process
