Panicle architecture is closely related to yield formation. The qPE9-1 gene has been proved to be widely used in high-yield rice cultivar developments, conferring erect panicle character in japonica rice. Recently, qPE9-1 has been successfully cloned; however, the genetic effect on grain yield per plant of the erect panicle allele qPE9-1 is controversial yet. In the present study, a drooping panicle parent Nongken 57, carrying qpe9-1 allele, was used as recurrent parent to successively backcross to a typical erect panicle line from the double haploid (DH) population (Wuyunjing 8/Nongken 57), which was previously shown to carry qPE9-1 allele. Thus a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs) was developed. The comparison of agronomic traits between the NILs showed that, when qpe9-1 was replaced by qPE9-1, the panicle architecture was changed from drooping to erect; moreover, the panicle length, plant height, 1000-grain weight and the tillers were significantly decreased, consequently resulting in the dramatic decrease of grain yield per plant by 30%. Therefore, we concluded that the qPE9-1 was a major factor controlling panicle architecture, and qPE9-1 had pleiotropic nature, with negative effects on grain yield per plant. This result strongly suggests that the erect panicle allele qPE9-1 should be used together with other favorable genes in the high-yield breeding practice. In addition, the effect of qPE9-1 on eating and cooking quality was also discussed in the present study.

Although several cultivars with PE trait have been developed and released for commercial production in China, there is little information on the inheritance of PE traits in rice. In the present study, 69 widely cultivated japonica cultivars and a double haploid (DH) population derived from a cross between a PE cultivar (Wuyunjing 8) and a drooping panicle cultivar (Nongken 57) were utilized to elucidate the mechanisms of PE formation and to map PE associated genes. Our data suggested that panicle length (PL) and plant height (PH) significantly affected panicle curvature (PC), with shorter PL and PH resulting in smaller PC and consequently more erect. A putative major gene was identified on chromosome 9 by molecular markers and bulk segregant analysis in DH population. In order to finely map the major gene, all simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers on chromosome 9 as well as 100 newly developed sequence-tagged site (STS) markers were used to construct a linkage group for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. A major QTL, qPE9-1, between STS marker H90 and SSR marker RM5652, was detected, and accounted for 41.72% of PC variation with pleiotropic effect on PH and PL. another QTL, qPE9-2, was also found to be adjacent to qPE9-1. In addition, we found that H90, the nearest marker to qPE9-1, used for genotyping 38 cultivars with extremely erect and drooping panicles, segregated in agreement with PC, suggesting the H90 product was possibly part of the qPE9-1 gene or closely related to it. These data demonstrated that H90 could be used for marker-aided selection for the PE trait in breeding and in the cloning of qPE9-1.

Rice plant architecture is an important agronomic trait and a major determinant in high productivity. Panicle erectness is the preferred plant architecture in japonica rice, but the molecular mechanism underlying domestication of the erect panicle remains elusive. Here we report the map-based cloning of a major quantitative trait locus, qPE9-1, which plays an integral role in regulation of rice plant architecture including panicle erectness. The R6547 qPE9-1 gene encodes a 426-amino-acid protein, homologous to the keratin-associated protein 5-4 family. The gene is composed of three Von Willebrand factor type C domains, one transmembrane domain, and one 4-disulfide-core domain. Phenotypic comparisons of a set of near-isogenic lines and transgenic lines reveal that the functional allele (qPE9-1) results in drooping panicles, and the loss-of-function mutation (qpe9-1) leads to more erect panicles. In addition, the qPE9-1 locus regulates panicle and grain length, grain weight, and consequently grain yield. We propose that the panicle erectness trait resulted from a natural random loss-of-function mutation for the qPE9-1 gene and has subsequently been the target of artificial selection during japonica rice breeding.
60862708.pdf	A loss-of-function mutation of rice DENSE PANICLE 1 causes semi-dwarfness and slightly increased number of spikelets	2011	Breeding Science	QTL Genomics Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences	In cereal breeding, semi-dwarfness and an increased spikelet number are favorable characteristics. We show that the rice DENSE PANICLE 1 (DN1) mutant allele Dn1-1 causes both of these characteristics and that Dn1-1 is a loss-of-function mutation. DN1 is allelic to DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 1 (DEP1) (=qPE(9-1)). The expression level of OsCKX2 in the shoot apex of Dn1-1 plants is similar to that in the wild type, indicating that OsCKX2 does not contribute to an increased number of spikelets. A comparison of the Dn1-1 and Dn1-3 alleles suggests that the N-terminal region of DN1 contains a coiled-coil domain and a nuclear localization signal that might be responsible for semi-dwarfness. This comparison also revealed that a single transmembrane alpha-helix, a VWFC module, and a four-disulfide core domain can further increase spikelet number. Subcellular localization analysis of the DN1 protein fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) implies that DN1 is located in the nucleus and cell membrane and that its N-terminal fragment is cleaved. Dn1-1 plants have normal sensitivity to gibberellin, brassinolide, and kinetin, and we observed no genetic epistasis with brassinolide-related mutants, suggesting that DN1 does not function in the signaling pathways of these phytohormones.

A rice cDNA, OsDEP1, encoding a highly cysteine (Cys)-rich G protein gamma subunit, was initially identified as it conferred cadmium (Cd) tolerance on yeast cells. Of the 426 aa constituting OsDEP1, 120 are Cys residues (28.2%), of which 88 are clustered in the C-terminal half region (aa 170-426). To evaluate the independent effects of these two regions, two truncated versions of the OsDEP1-expressing plasmids pOsDEP1(1-169) and pOsDEP1(170-426) were used to examine their effects on yeast Cd tolerance. Although OsDEP1(170-426) conferred a similar level of Cd tolerance as the intact OsDEP1, OsDEP1(1-169) provided no such tolerance, indicating that the tolerance effect is localized to the aa 170-426 C-terminal peptide region. The Cd responses of transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing OsDEP1, OsDEP1(1-169) or OsDEP1(170-426), were similar to the observations in yeast cells, with OsDEP1 and OsDEP1(170-426) transgenic plants displaying Cd tolerance but OsDEP1(1-169) plants showing no such tolerance. In addition, a positive correlation between the transcript levels of OsDEP1 or OsDEP1(170-426) in the transgenics and the Cd content of these plants upon Cd application was observed. As several Arabidopsis loss-of-function heterotrimeric G protein beta and gamma subunit gene mutants did not show differences in their Cd sensitivity compared with wild-type plants, we propose that the Cys-rich region of OsDEP1 may function directly as a trap for Cd ions.

Grain yield is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) derived from natural variations in many crop plants. Here we report the molecular characterization of a major rice grain yield QTL that acts through the determination of panicle architecture. The dominant allele at the DEP1 locus is a gain-of-function mutation causing truncation of a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein-like domain protein. The effect of this allele is to enhance meristematic activity, resulting in a reduced length of the inflorescence internode, an increased number of grains per panicle and a consequent increase in grain yield. This allele is common to many Chinese high-yielding rice varieties and likely represents a relatively recent introduction into the cultivated rice gene pool. We also show that a functionally equivalent allele is present in the temperate cereals and seems to have arisen before the divergence of the wheat and barley lineages.
Plant Cell-2013-Lu-3743-59.pdf	Genome-wide binding analysis of the transcription activator ideal plant architecture1 reveals a complex network regulating rice plant architecture	2013	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Ideal plant architecture1 (IPA1) is critical in regulating rice (Oryza sativa) plant architecture and substantially enhances grain yield. To elucidate its molecular basis, we first confirmed IPA1 as a functional transcription activator and then identified 1067 and 2185 genes associated with IPA1 binding sites in shoot apices and young panicles, respectively, through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing assays. The Squamosa promoter binding protein-box direct binding core motif GTAC was highly enriched in IPA1 binding peaks; interestingly, a previously uncharacterized indirect binding motif TGGGCC/T was found to be significantly enriched through the interaction of IPA1 with proliferating cell nuclear antigen promoter binding factor1 or promoter binding factor2. Genome-wide expression profiling by RNA sequencing revealed IPA1 roles in diverse pathways. Moreover, our results demonstrated that IPA1 could directly bind to the promoter of rice teosinte branched1, a negative regulator of tiller bud outgrowth, to suppress rice tillering, and directly and positively regulate dense and erect panicle1, an important gene regulating panicle architecture, to influence plant height and panicle length. The elucidation of target genes of IPA1 genome-wide will contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying plant architecture and to facilitating the breeding of elite varieties with ideal plant architecture.

Both the N-terminal region and the C-terminal domains of AGG3 are necessary for the function of AGG3. By contrast, analysis of a series of AGG3 derivatives with deletions in specific domains showed that the deletion of any of these domains cannot completely abolish the function of AGG3. The GFP-AGG3 fusion protein is localized to the plasma membrane. The predicted transmembrane domain plays an important role in the plasma membrane localization of AGG3. Genetic analyses revealed that AGG3 action requires a functional G protein alpha subunit (GPA1) and G protein beta subunit (AGB1). * Our findings demonstrate that AGG3, GPA1 and AGB1 act in the same genetic pathway to influence organ size and shape in A. thaliana.
