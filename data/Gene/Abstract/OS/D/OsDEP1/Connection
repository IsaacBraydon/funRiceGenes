DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	Gn1a|OsCKX2	A loss-of-function mutation of rice DENSE PANICLE 1 causes semi-dwarfness and slightly increased number of spikelets	The expression level of OsCKX2 in the shoot apex of Dn1-1 plants is similar to that in the wild type, indicating that OsCKX2 does not contribute to an increased number of spikelets
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	RGB1|OsRGB1	Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and RGB1 play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.	Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and RGB1 play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	RGB1|OsRGB1	Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and RGB1 play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.	Furthermore, the results suggested that qPE9-1 negatively regulates the ABA response by suppressing the expression of key transcription factors involved in ABA and stress responses, while RGB1 positively regulates ABA biosynthesis by upregulating NCED gene expression under both normal and drought stress conditions
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	RGB1|OsRGB1	Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and RGB1 play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.	Taken together, it is proposed that RGB1 is a positive regulator of the ABA response and drought adaption in rice plants, whereas qPE9-1 is modulated by RGB1 and functions as a negative regulator in the ABA-dependent drought-stress responses
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	RGG1	Function of heterotrimeric G-protein gamma subunit RGG1 in providing salinity stress tolerance in rice by elevating detoxification of ROS.	In salinity-stressed RGG1 transgenic lines, the transcript levels of RGG2, RGB, RGA, DEP1, and GS3 also increased in addition to RGG1
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	GGC2	A G-protein pathway determines grain size in rice.	 Three G¦Ã proteins, DEP1, GGC2 and GS3, antagonistically regulate grain size
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	GGC2	A G-protein pathway determines grain size in rice.	 DEP1 and GGC2, individually or in combination, increase grain length when in complex with G¦Â
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	G-protein ¦Â¦Ã subunits determine grain size through interaction with MADS-domain transcription factors in rice.	 The G¦Ã subunits GS3 and DEP1 interact directly with the conserved keratin-like domain of MADS transcription factors, function as cofactors to enhance OsMADS1 transcriptional activity and promote the co-operative transactivation of common target genes, thereby regulating grain size and shape
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	OsSPL18	OsSPL18 controls grain weight and grain number in rice.	 Quantitative expression analysis showed that DEP1, a major grain number regulator, was significantly down-regulated in OsSPL18 KO lines
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	OsSPL18	OsSPL18 controls grain weight and grain number in rice.	 Both yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase (LUC) assays showed that OsSPL18 could bind to the DEP1 promoter, suggesting that OsSPL18 regulates panicle development by positively regulating the expression of DEP1
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	OsAP2-39	Multiple areas investigation reveals the genes related to vascular bundles in rice.	 The double mutant for the DEP1 and AP2-like genes (OsAP2-39) showed decreased endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) level and insensitivity to exogenous ABA treatment, confirming that both DEP1 and OsAP2-39 are involved in the ABA response mechanism
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	OsSHI1	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.	 Moreover, OsSHI1 could bind directly to the promoter regions of both OsTB1 and OsDEP1 through a novel cis-element (T/GCTCTAC motif)
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	OsSHI1	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.	 Further, OsSHI1 represses the transcriptional activation activity of IPA1 by affecting its DNA binding activity towards the promoters of both OsTB1 and OsDEP1, resulting in increased tiller number and diminished panicle size
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	OsmiR535	The multiple roles of OsmiR535 in modulating plant height, panicle branching and grain shape.	 Through quantitative real-time PCR analyses, we further revealed that OsmiR535 overexpression repressed the expression of OsSPL7/12/16, as well as the OsSPLs downstream panicle related genes, including OsPIN1B, OsDEP1, OsLOG and OsSLR1
