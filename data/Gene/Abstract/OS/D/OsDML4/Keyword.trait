OsDML4	transcription factor	A new demethylase gene, OsDML4, is involved in high temperature-increased grain chalkiness in rice.	 The expression of two transcription factor genes RISBZ1 and RPBF was significantly decreased in the osdml4 mutants, which caused adverse effects on the formation of protein bodies (PBs) with greatly decreased PB-II number, and incomplete and abnormally shaped PB-IIs
OsDML4	temperature	A new demethylase gene, OsDML4, is involved in high temperature-increased grain chalkiness in rice.	 No significant difference was detected between the wild type and osdml4 mutants under normal temperature
OsDML4	endosperm	A new demethylase gene, OsDML4, is involved in high temperature-increased grain chalkiness in rice.	 Here, we identified a new demethylase gene OsDML4 and discovered its function in cytosine demethylation to affect endosperm formation
OsDML4	endosperm	A new demethylase gene, OsDML4, is involved in high temperature-increased grain chalkiness in rice.	 Loss of function of OsDML4 induced chalky endosperm only under HT and dramatically reduced the transcription and accumulation of glutelins and 16 kDa prolamin
OsDML4	prolamin	A new demethylase gene, OsDML4, is involved in high temperature-increased grain chalkiness in rice.	 Loss of function of OsDML4 induced chalky endosperm only under HT and dramatically reduced the transcription and accumulation of glutelins and 16 kDa prolamin
OsDML4	demethylation	A new demethylase gene, OsDML4, is involved in high temperature-increased grain chalkiness in rice.	 Here, we identified a new demethylase gene OsDML4 and discovered its function in cytosine demethylation to affect endosperm formation
