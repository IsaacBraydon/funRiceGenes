Campos-Soriano-2012-The arbuscular mycor.pdf	The arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis promotes the systemic induction of regulatory defence-related genes in rice leaves and confers resistance to pathogen infection	2012	Mol Plant Pathol	Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics (CRAG) CSIC-IRTA-UAB-UB, Parc de Recerca UAB, Edifici CRAG, Campus UAB, Bellaterra (Cerdanyola del Valles), 08193, Barcelona, Spain.	Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses are mutualistic associations between soil fungi and most vascular plants. Their association benefits the host plant by improving nutrition, mainly phosphorus nutrition, and by providing increased capability to cope with adverse conditions. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional changes triggered in rice leaves as a result of AM symbiosis, focusing on the relevance of the plant defence response. We showed that root colonization by the AM fungus Glomus intraradices is accompanied by the systemic induction of genes that play a regulatory role in the host defence response, such as OsNPR1, OsAP2, OsEREBP and OsJAmyb. Genes involved in signal transduction processes (OsDUF26 and OsMPK6) and genes that function in calcium-mediated signalling processes (OsCBP, OsCaM and OsCML4) are also up-regulated in leaves of mycorrhizal rice plants in the absence of pathogen infection. In addition, the mycorrhizal rice plants exhibit a stronger induction of defence marker genes [i.e. pathogenesis-related (PR) genes] in their leaves in response to infection by the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Evidence indicates that mycorrhizal rice plants show enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus. Overall, these results suggest that the protective effect of the AM symbiosis in rice plants relies on both the systemic activation of defence regulatory genes in the absence of pathogen challenge and the priming for stronger expression of defence effector genes during pathogen infection. The possible mechanisms involved in the mycorrhiza-induced resistance to M. oryzae infection are discussed.
NA	A novel Meloidogyne graminicola effector, MgMO237, interacts with multiple host defense-related proteins to manipulate plant basal immunity and promote parasitism.	2018	Mol Plant Pathol	Laboratory of Plant Nematology, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.	Plant-parasitic nematodes can secrete effector proteins into the host tissue to facilitate their parasitism. In this study, we reported a novel effector protein, MgMO237, from Meloidogyne graminicola, which was exclusively expressed within the dorsal esophageal gland cell and markedly up-regulated in parasitic third/fourth stage juveniles of M. graminicola. Transient expression of MgMO237 in protoplasts from rice roots showed that MgMO237 was localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the host cells. Rice plants overexpressing MgMO237 had an increased susceptibility to M. graminicola. In contrast, rice plants expressing RNA interference vectors targeting MgMO237 had an increased resistance to M. graminicola. Additionally, yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that MgMO237 interacted specifically with three rice endogenous proteins, i.e., 1,3-beta-glucan synthase component (OsGSC), cysteine-rich repeat secretory protein 55 (OsCRRSP55) and pathogenesis-related Bet v I family protein (OsBetvI), which are all related to host defenses. Moreover, MgMO237 can suppress the host defense responses including the expression of host defense-related genes, cell wall callose deposition and the burst of reactive oxygen species. These results demonstrate that the effector MgMO237 probably promotes the parasitism of M. graminicola by interacting with multiple host defense-related proteins and suppressing plant basal immunity in the later parasitic stages of nematodes.
