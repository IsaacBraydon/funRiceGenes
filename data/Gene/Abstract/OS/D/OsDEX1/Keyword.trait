OsDEX1	pollen	A rice Ca2+ binding protein is required for tapetum function and pollen formation.	Here we report a role of OsDEX1 (Defective in Exine Formation 1 in rice), a Ca2+ binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen formation
OsDEX1	pollen	A rice Ca2+ binding protein is required for tapetum function and pollen formation.	In osdex1 anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male sterility
OsDEX1	pollen	A rice Ca2+ binding protein is required for tapetum function and pollen formation.	Phylogenetic analysis revealed that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca2+ in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects in an Arabidopsis dex1 mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation during pollen development
OsDEX1	pollen	A rice Ca2+ binding protein is required for tapetum function and pollen formation.	Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a conserved role in the development of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via changing the Ca2+ homeostasis during pollen development
OsDEX1	anther	A rice Ca2+ binding protein is required for tapetum function and pollen formation.	OsDEX1 transcript is observed in tapetal cells and microspores during the early anther development
OsDEX1	sterility	A rice Ca2+ binding protein is required for tapetum function and pollen formation.	In osdex1 anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male sterility
