OsDof25	photosynthesis	Functions of OsDof25 in regulation of OsC4PPDK.	Here we report on the analysis of OsDof25 and show a function in regulation of the important C4 photosynthesis gene, OsC4PPDK in rice
OsDof25	transcriptional activator	Functions of OsDof25 in regulation of OsC4PPDK.	Conclusive evidence for a role of OsDof25 in regulation of C4PPDK came from loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments with transgenic rice, which showed that down-regulation or over-expression of OsDof25 correlated with OsC4PPDK expression and that OsDof25 has functions as transcriptional activator
