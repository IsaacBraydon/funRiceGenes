OsCBL2	OsDHHC30	Screening DHHCs of S-acylated proteins using an OsDHHC cDNA library and bimolecular fluorescence complementation in rice.	 Among the pairs, OsCBL2 and OsCBL3 were S-acylated by OsDHHC30 in yeast and rice
OsCBL2	OsDHHC30	Screening DHHCs of S-acylated proteins using an OsDHHC cDNA library and bimolecular fluorescence complementation in rice.	 The localization of OsCBL2 and OsCBL3 in the endomembrane depended on S-acylation mediated by OsDHHC30
