OsAP37	OsDREB1E|OsDREB1-1|CR350	Mutation of OsGIGANTEA Leads to Enhanced Tolerance to Polyethylene Glycol-Generated Osmotic Stress in Rice.	In addition, qRT-PCR and microarray analysis revealed that the transcript abundance of some osmotic stress response genes, such as OsDREB1E, OsAP37, OsAP59, OsLIP9, OsLEA3, OsRAB16A, and OsSalT, was significantly higher in osgi than in WT plants, suggesting that OsGI might be a negative regulator in the osmotic stress response in rice

OsDREB1E|OsDREB1-1|CR350	OsWRKY76	OsWRKY76 positively regulates drought stress via OsbHLH148-mediated jasmonate signaling in rice.	 Yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift, and dual-luciferase assays showed that OsWRKY76 and OsbHLH148 bound directly to the OsDREB1E promoter and activated OsDREB1E expression in response to drought stress
