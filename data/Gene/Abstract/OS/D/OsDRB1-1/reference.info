NA	MicroRNA biogenesis factor DRB1 is a phosphorylation target of mitogen activated protein kinase MPK3 in both rice and Arabidopsis.	2014	FEBS J	National Institute of Plant Genome Research, New Delhi, India.	MicroRNA (miRNA) biogenesis requires AtDRB1 (double-stranded RNA binding protein)/HYL1 (Hyponastic Leaves1) protein for processing and maturation of miRNA precursors. The AtDRB1/HYL1 protein associates with AtDCL1 (Dicer-Like1) and accurately processes primary-miRNAs (pri-mRNAs) first to precursor-miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) and finally to mature miRNAs. The dephosphorylation of AtDRB1/HYL1 protein is very important for the precise processing of miRNA precursors. The monocot model crop plant Oryza<U+00A0>sativa encodes four orthologues of AtDRB1/HYL1 protein, the only one encoded by Arabidopsis thaliana. The present study focuses on the functionality of the O.<U+00A0>sativa DRBs as the orthologues of AtDRB1/HYL1 by using RNA binding assays and in<U+00A0>planta protein-protein interaction analysis. Further, mitogen-activated protein kinase MPK3 is established as the kinase phosphorylating DRB1 protein in both the model plants, O.<U+00A0>sativa and Arabidopsis. MicroRNA microarray analysis in atmpk3 and atmpk6 mutants indicate the importance of AtMPK3 in maintaining the level of miRNAs in the plant.
