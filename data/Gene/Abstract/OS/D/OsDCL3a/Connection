OsDCL3a	OsDCL3b	Roles of DCL4 and DCL3b in rice phased small RNA biogenesis	Surprisingly, the processing of 24-nucleotide phased small RNA requires the DCL3 homolog OsDCL3b rather than OsDCL3a, suggesting functional divergence within DCL3 family
Ghd2|OsK	OsDCL3a	Translational repression by a miniature inverted-repeat transposable element in the 3' untranslated region.	 Interestingly, the translational repression of Ghd2 by the sMITE mainly relies on Dicer-like 3a (OsDCL3a)
