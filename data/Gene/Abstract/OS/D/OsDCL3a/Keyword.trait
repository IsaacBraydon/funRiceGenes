OsDCL3a	brassinosteroid	Dicer-like 3 produces transposable element-associated 24-nt siRNAs that control agricultural traits in rice	 OsDCL3a directly targets genes involved in gibberellin and brassinosteroid homeostasis; OsDCL3a deficiency may affect these genes, thus causing the phenotypes of dwarfism and enlarged flag leaf angle
OsDCL3a	dwarf	Dicer-like 3 produces transposable element-associated 24-nt siRNAs that control agricultural traits in rice	 Impairing OsDCL3a expression by RNA interference caused phenotypes affecting important agricultural traits; these phenotypes include dwarfism, larger flag leaf angle, and fewer secondary branches
