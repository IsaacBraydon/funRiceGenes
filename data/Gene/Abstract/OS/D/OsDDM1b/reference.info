Regulation of cytosine methylation in the plant genome is of pivotal in determining the epigenetic states of chromosome regions. Relative tolerance of plant to deficiency in cytosine methylation provides unparalleled opportunities to study the mechanism for regulation of cytosine methylation. The Decrease in DNA Methylation 1 (DDM1) of Arabidopsis thaliana is one of the best characterized plant epigenetic regulators that are necessary for maintenance of cytosine methylation in genomic DNA. Although cytosine methylation could affect various aspects of plant growth and development including those related to agricultural importance, orthologs of DDM1 in plants other than Arabidopsis has not been studied in detail. In this study, we identified two rice genes with similarity to Arabidopsis DDM1 and designated them OsDDM1a and OsDDM1b. Both of the rice DDM1 homologs are transcribed during development and their amino acid sequences are 93 % identical to each other. Transgenic rice lines expressing the OsDDM1a cDNA in the antisense orientation exhibited genomic DNA hypomethylation. In those lines, repeated sequences were more severely affected than a single copy sequence as is the case in Arabidopsis ddm1 mutants. Transcripts derived from endogenous transposon-related loci were up-regulated in the antisense OsDDM1 lines, opening a possibility to identify and utilize potentially active transposons for rice functional genomics.
NA	The ortholog of DDM1 is mainly required for CHG and CG methylation of heterochromatin and is involved in DRM2-mediated CHH methylation that targets mostly genic regions of the rice genome.	2016	Plant Physiol	Huazhong Agricultural University CITY: Wuahn China [CN].	Plant DNA methylation that occurs at CG, CHG and CHH sites (H=A, C, or T) is a hallmark of repression of repetitive sequences and transposable elements (TE). The rice genome contains about 40% of repetitive sequence and TE, and displays specific patterns of genome-wide DNA methylation. The mechanism responsible for the specific methylation patterns is unclear. Here, we analyzed the function of OsDDM1 and OsDRM2 in genome-wide DNA methylation, TE repression, small RNA accumulation, and gene expression. We show that OsDDM1 is essential for high levels of methylation at CHG and, to a lesser extent, CG sites in heterochromatic regions, and is also required for CHH methylation that mainly locates in the genic regions of the genome. In addition to a large member of TEs, loss of OsDDM1 leads to hypo-methylation and up-regulation of many protein-coding genes, producing very severe growth phenotypes at the initial generation. Importantly, we show that OsDRM2 mutation results in a near complete loss of CHH methylation and de-repression of mainly small TE-associated genes, and that OsDDM1 is involved in facilitating OsDRM2-mediated CHH methylation. Thus, the function of OsDDM1 and OsDRM2 defines distinct DNA methylation pathways in the bulk of DNA methylation of the genome, which is possibly related to the dispersed heterochromatin across chromosomes in rice and suggests that DNA methylation mechanism may vary among different plant species.
