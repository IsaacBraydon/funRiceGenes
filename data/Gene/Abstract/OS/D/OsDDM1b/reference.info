Regulation of cytosine methylation in the plant genome is of pivotal in determining the epigenetic states of chromosome regions. Relative tolerance of plant to deficiency in cytosine methylation provides unparalleled opportunities to study the mechanism for regulation of cytosine methylation. The Decrease in DNA Methylation 1 (DDM1) of Arabidopsis thaliana is one of the best characterized plant epigenetic regulators that are necessary for maintenance of cytosine methylation in genomic DNA. Although cytosine methylation could affect various aspects of plant growth and development including those related to agricultural importance, orthologs of DDM1 in plants other than Arabidopsis has not been studied in detail. In this study, we identified two rice genes with similarity to Arabidopsis DDM1 and designated them OsDDM1a and OsDDM1b. Both of the rice DDM1 homologs are transcribed during development and their amino acid sequences are 93 % identical to each other. Transgenic rice lines expressing the OsDDM1a cDNA in the antisense orientation exhibited genomic DNA hypomethylation. In those lines, repeated sequences were more severely affected than a single copy sequence as is the case in Arabidopsis ddm1 mutants. Transcripts derived from endogenous transposon-related loci were up-regulated in the antisense OsDDM1 lines, opening a possibility to identify and utilize potentially active transposons for rice functional genomics.
NA	The ortholog of DDM1 is mainly required for CHG and CG methylation of heterochromatin and is involved in DRM2-mediated CHH methylation that targets mostly genic regions of the rice genome.	2016	Plant Physiol	Huazhong Agricultural University CITY: Wuahn China [CN].	Plant DNA methylation that occurs at CG, CHG and CHH sites (H=A, C, or T) is a hallmark of repression of repetitive sequences and transposable elements (TE). The rice genome contains about 40% of repetitive sequence and TE, and displays specific patterns of genome-wide DNA methylation. The mechanism responsible for the specific methylation patterns is unclear. Here, we analyzed the function of OsDDM1 and OsDRM2 in genome-wide DNA methylation, TE repression, small RNA accumulation, and gene expression. We show that OsDDM1 is essential for high levels of methylation at CHG and, to a lesser extent, CG sites in heterochromatic regions, and is also required for CHH methylation that mainly locates in the genic regions of the genome. In addition to a large member of TEs, loss of OsDDM1 leads to hypo-methylation and up-regulation of many protein-coding genes, producing very severe growth phenotypes at the initial generation. Importantly, we show that OsDRM2 mutation results in a near complete loss of CHH methylation and de-repression of mainly small TE-associated genes, and that OsDDM1 is involved in facilitating OsDRM2-mediated CHH methylation. Thus, the function of OsDDM1 and OsDRM2 defines distinct DNA methylation pathways in the bulk of DNA methylation of the genome, which is possibly related to the dispersed heterochromatin across chromosomes in rice and suggests that DNA methylation mechanism may vary among different plant species.
NA	OsDDM1b Controls Grain Size by Influencing Cell Cycling and Regulating Homeostasis and Signaling of Brassinosteroid in Rice.	2022	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Ecological Pest Control for Fujian and Taiwan Crops, College of Plant Protection, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China.	Snf2 family proteins are the crucial subunits of chromatin-remodeling complexes (CRCs), which contributes to the biological processes of transcription, replication, and DNA repair using ATP as energy. Some CRC subunits have been confirmed to be the critical regulators in various aspects of plant growth and development and in epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modification, DNA methylation, and histone variants. However, the functions of Snf2 family genes in rice were poorly investigated. In this study, the relative expression profile of 40 members of Snf2 family in rice was studied at certain developmental stages of seed. Our results revealed that OsCHR741/OsDDM1b (Decrease in DNA methylation 1) was accumulated highly in the early developmental stage of seeds. We further analyzed the OsDDM1b T-DNA insertion loss-of-function of mutant, which exhibited dwarfism, smaller organ size, and shorter and wider grain size than the wild type (Hwayoung, HY), yet no difference in 1,000-grain weight. Consistent with the grain size, the outer parenchyma cell layers of lemma in osddm1b developed more cells with decreased size. OsDDM1b encoded a nucleus, membrane-localized protein and was distributed predominately in young spikelets and seeds, asserting its role in grain size. Meanwhile, the osddm1b was less sensitive to brassinosteroids (BRs) while the endogenous BR levels increased. We detected changes in the expression levels of the BR signaling pathway and feedback-inhibited genes with and without exogenous BR application, and the alterations of expression were also observed in grain size-related genes in the osddm1b. Altogether, our results suggest that OsDDM1b plays a crucial role in grain size via influencing cell proliferation and regulating BR signaling and homeostasis.
