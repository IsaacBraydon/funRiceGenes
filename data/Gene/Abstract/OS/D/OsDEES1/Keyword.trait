OsDEES1	seed	The rice wall-associated receptor-like kinase gene OsDEES1 plays a role in female gametophyte development	 A detailed investigation of the ovaries from OsDEES1 RNA interference plants indicated that the knockdown of OsDEES1 expression did not affect megasporogenesis but that it disturbed female gametophyte formation, resulting in a degenerated embryo sac and defective seed formation
OsDEES1	seed	The rice wall-associated receptor-like kinase gene OsDEES1 plays a role in female gametophyte development	 OsDEES1 exhibited a tissue-specific expression pattern in flowers and seedlings
OsDEES1	flower	The rice wall-associated receptor-like kinase gene OsDEES1 plays a role in female gametophyte development	 OsDEES1 exhibited a tissue-specific expression pattern in flowers and seedlings
OsDEES1	sterility	The rice wall-associated receptor-like kinase gene OsDEES1 plays a role in female gametophyte development	 OsDEES1 silencing by RNA interference caused a high rate of female sterility
OsDEES1	seedling	The rice wall-associated receptor-like kinase gene OsDEES1 plays a role in female gametophyte development	 OsDEES1 exhibited a tissue-specific expression pattern in flowers and seedlings
OsDEES1	reproductive	The rice wall-associated receptor-like kinase gene OsDEES1 plays a role in female gametophyte development	 Crossing experiments showed that female reproductive organs lacking OsDEES1 carried a functional defect
