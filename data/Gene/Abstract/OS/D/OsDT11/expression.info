OsDT11	Overexpression of OsDT11, which encodes a novel cysteine-rich peptide, enhances drought tolerance and increases ABA concentration in rice. |  It was found that the expression of OsDT11 can be activated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment |  Compared with wild-type lines, the OsDT11-overexpression lines displayed dramatically enhanced tolerance to drought and had reduced water loss, reduced stomatal density, and an increased the concentration of abscisic acid (ABA) |  The suppression of OsDT11 expression resulted in an increased sensitivity to drought compared to wild-type expression |  Moreover, the expression of OsDT11 was repressed in ABA-insensitive mutant Osbzip23 and Os2H16 RNAi lines	Overexpression of OsDT11, which encodes a novel cysteine-rich peptide, enhances drought tolerance and increases ABA concentration in rice. |  Compared with wild-type lines, the OsDT11-overexpression lines displayed dramatically enhanced tolerance to drought and had reduced water loss, reduced stomatal density, and an increased the concentration of abscisic acid (ABA)	 Moreover, the expression of OsDT11 was repressed in ABA-insensitive mutant Osbzip23 and Os2H16 RNAi lines
