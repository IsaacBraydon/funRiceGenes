NA	DRB2 Modulates Leaf Rolling by Regulating Accumulation of MicroRNAs Related to Leaf Development in Rice.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.	As an important agronomic trait in rice (Oryza sativa), moderate leaf rolling helps to maintain the erectness of leaves and minimize shadowing between leaves, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency and grain yield. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying rice leaf rolling still need to be elucidated. Here, we isolated a rice mutant, rl89, showing adaxially rolled leaf phenotype due to decreased number and size of bulliform cells. We confirmed that the rl89 phenotypes were caused by a single nucleotide substitution in OsDRB2 (LOC_Os10g33970) gene encoding DOUBLE-STRANDED RNA-BINDING2. This gene was constitutively expressed, and its encoded protein was localized to both nucleus and cytoplasm. Yeast two-hybrid assay showed that OsDRB2 could interact with DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) and OsDRB1-2 respectively. qRT-PCR analysis of 29 related genes suggested that defects of the OsDRB2-miR166-OsHBs pathway could play an important role in formation of the rolled leaf phenotype of rl89, in which OsDRB2 mutation reduced miR166 accumulation, resulting in elevated expressions of the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper genes (such as OsHB1, 3 and 5) involved in leaf polarity and/or morphology development. Moreover, OsDRB2 mutation also reduced accumulation of miR160, miR319, miR390, and miR396, which could cause the abnormal leaf development in rl89 by regulating expressions of their target genes related to leaf development.
NA	SEMI-ROLLED LEAF 10 stabilizes catalase isozyme B to regulate leaf morphology and thermotolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2023	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, China.	Plant architecture and stress tolerance play important roles in rice breeding. Specific leaf morphologies and ideal plant architecture can effectively improve both abiotic stress resistance and rice grain yield. However, the mechanism by which plants simultaneously regulate leaf morphogenesis and stress resistance remains elusive. Here, we report that SRL10, which encodes a double-stranded RNA-binding protein, regulates leaf morphology and thermotolerance in rice through alteration of microRNA biogenesis. The srl10 mutant had a semi-rolled leaf phenotype and elevated sensitivity to high temperature. SRL10 directly interacted with catalase isozyme B (CATB), and the two proteins mutually increased one other&#x27;s stability to enhance hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ) scavenging, thereby contributing to thermotolerance. The natural Hap3 (AGC) type of SRL10 allele was found to be present in the majority of aus rice accessions, and was identified as a thermotolerant allele under high temperature stress in both the field and the growth chamber. Moreover, the seed-setting rate was 3.19 times higher and grain yield per plant was 1.68 times higher in near-isogenic line (NIL) carrying Hap3 allele compared to plants carrying Hap1 allele under heat stress. Collectively, these results reveal a new locus of interest and define a novel SRL10-CATB based regulatory mechanism for developing cultivars with high temperature tolerance and stable yield. Furthermore, our findings provide a theoretical basis for simultaneous breeding for plant architecture and stress resistance.
