OsDREB1G	transcription factor	Ectopic Expression of OsDREB1G, a Member of the OsDREB1 Subfamily, Confers Cold Stress Tolerance in Rice.	 Therefore, OsDREB1G is a typical CBF/DREB1 transcription factor that specifically functions in the cold stress response
OsDREB1G	drought	Ectopic Expression of OsDREB1G, a Member of the OsDREB1 Subfamily, Confers Cold Stress Tolerance in Rice.	 However, unlike these rice lines, transgenic rice overexpressing OsDREB1G did not exhibit significant increases in drought or salt tolerance
OsDREB1G	salt	Ectopic Expression of OsDREB1G, a Member of the OsDREB1 Subfamily, Confers Cold Stress Tolerance in Rice.	 However, unlike these rice lines, transgenic rice overexpressing OsDREB1G did not exhibit significant increases in drought or salt tolerance
OsDREB1G	tolerance	Ectopic Expression of OsDREB1G, a Member of the OsDREB1 Subfamily, Confers Cold Stress Tolerance in Rice.	 However, unlike these rice lines, transgenic rice overexpressing OsDREB1G did not exhibit significant increases in drought or salt tolerance
OsDREB1G	tolerance	Ectopic Expression of OsDREB1G, a Member of the OsDREB1 Subfamily, Confers Cold Stress Tolerance in Rice.	 Therefore, OsDREB1G could be useful for developing transgenic rice with enhanced cold-stress tolerance
OsDREB1G	cold stress	Ectopic Expression of OsDREB1G, a Member of the OsDREB1 Subfamily, Confers Cold Stress Tolerance in Rice.	 OsDREB1G is specifically induced under cold stress conditions among several abiotic stresses examined
