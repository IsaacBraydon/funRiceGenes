OsDREB2B	drought	Comprehensive analysis of rice DREB2-type genes that encode transcription factors involved in the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes	Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsDREB2B showed enhanced expression of DREB2A target genes and improved drought and heat-shock stress tolerance
OsDREB2B	transcription factor	Comprehensive analysis of rice DREB2-type genes that encode transcription factors involved in the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes	These results suggest that OsDREB2B is a key gene that encodes a stress-inducible DREB2-type transcription factor that functions in stress-responsive gene expression in rice
OsDREB2B	abiotic stress	Comprehensive analysis of rice DREB2-type genes that encode transcription factors involved in the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes	Only OsDREB2A and OsDREB2B showed abiotic stress-inducible gene expression
OsDREB2B	leaf	OsDREB2B, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, negatively regulates plant height by conferring GA metabolism in rice.	 Spatial expression analysis revealed that OsDREB2B was highly expressed in the leaf sheaths
OsDREB2B	leaf	OsDREB2B, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, negatively regulates plant height by conferring GA metabolism in rice.	 Under exogenous GA(3) application, OsDREB2B expression was induced, and the length of the second leaf sheath of the OsDREB2B-OE lines recovered to that of the WT
OsDREB2B	growth	OsDREB2B, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, negatively regulates plant height by conferring GA metabolism in rice.	 In summary, our study suggests that OsDREB2B plays a negative role in rice growth and development by regulating GA metabolic gene expression, which is mediated by OsAP2-39 and OsWRKY21, thereby reducing GA content and rice plant height
OsDREB2B	development	OsDREB2B, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, negatively regulates plant height by conferring GA metabolism in rice.	 In summary, our study suggests that OsDREB2B plays a negative role in rice growth and development by regulating GA metabolic gene expression, which is mediated by OsAP2-39 and OsWRKY21, thereby reducing GA content and rice plant height
OsDREB2B	sheath	OsDREB2B, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, negatively regulates plant height by conferring GA metabolism in rice.	 Under exogenous GA(3) application, OsDREB2B expression was induced, and the length of the second leaf sheath of the OsDREB2B-OE lines recovered to that of the WT
OsDREB2B	nucleus	OsDREB2B, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, negatively regulates plant height by conferring GA metabolism in rice.	 OsDREB2B localized to the nucleus of the rice protoplast acted as a transcription activator and upregulated OsAP2-39 by directly binding to its promoter
OsDREB2B	ga	OsDREB2B, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, negatively regulates plant height by conferring GA metabolism in rice.	 In summary, our study suggests that OsDREB2B plays a negative role in rice growth and development by regulating GA metabolic gene expression, which is mediated by OsAP2-39 and OsWRKY21, thereby reducing GA content and rice plant height
OsDREB2B	 ga 	OsDREB2B, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, negatively regulates plant height by conferring GA metabolism in rice.	 In summary, our study suggests that OsDREB2B plays a negative role in rice growth and development by regulating GA metabolic gene expression, which is mediated by OsAP2-39 and OsWRKY21, thereby reducing GA content and rice plant height
OsDREB2B	height	OsDREB2B, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, negatively regulates plant height by conferring GA metabolism in rice.	 In summary, our study suggests that OsDREB2B plays a negative role in rice growth and development by regulating GA metabolic gene expression, which is mediated by OsAP2-39 and OsWRKY21, thereby reducing GA content and rice plant height
OsDREB2B	plant height	OsDREB2B, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, negatively regulates plant height by conferring GA metabolism in rice.	 In summary, our study suggests that OsDREB2B plays a negative role in rice growth and development by regulating GA metabolic gene expression, which is mediated by OsAP2-39 and OsWRKY21, thereby reducing GA content and rice plant height
OsDREB2B	GA	OsDREB2B, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, negatively regulates plant height by conferring GA metabolism in rice.	 In summary, our study suggests that OsDREB2B plays a negative role in rice growth and development by regulating GA metabolic gene expression, which is mediated by OsAP2-39 and OsWRKY21, thereby reducing GA content and rice plant height
