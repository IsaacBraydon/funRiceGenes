OsDREB2B	drought	Comprehensive analysis of rice DREB2-type genes that encode transcription factors involved in the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes	 Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsDREB2B showed enhanced expression of DREB2A target genes and improved drought and heat-shock stress tolerance
OsDREB2B	transcription factor	Comprehensive analysis of rice DREB2-type genes that encode transcription factors involved in the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes	 These results suggest that OsDREB2B is a key gene that encodes a stress-inducible DREB2-type transcription factor that functions in stress-responsive gene expression in rice
OsDREB2B	abiotic stress	Comprehensive analysis of rice DREB2-type genes that encode transcription factors involved in the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes	 Only OsDREB2A and OsDREB2B showed abiotic stress-inducible gene expression
