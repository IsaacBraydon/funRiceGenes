DREB2s (dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 2s) are transcription factors that interact with a cis-acting DRE (dehydration-responsive element)/CRT (C-repeat) sequence and activate the expression of downstream genes involved in water- and heat-shock stress responses and tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of all five DREB2-type genes in rice (OsDREB2 s: OsDREB2A, OsDREB2B, OsDREB2C, OsDREB2E and OsABI4) to determine which of them contribute to plant stress responses. We analysed the expression patterns of these genes under abiotic stress conditions, and we examined the subcellular localisation and transcriptional activation activity of their translational products in protoplasts. Only OsDREB2A and OsDREB2B showed abiotic stress-inducible gene expression. In addition, OsDREB2B showed nuclear specific localisation and the highest transactivation activity. OsDREB2B has functional and non-functional forms of its transcript similar to its orthologues in the grass family, and the functional form of its transcript was markedly increased during stress conditions. We analysed the splicing mechanism of OsDREB2B with transgenic rice that express the non-functional transcript and we found that the non-functional form is not a precursor of the functional form; thus, stress-inducible alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is an important mechanism for the regulation of OsDREB2B. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsDREB2B showed enhanced expression of DREB2A target genes and improved drought and heat-shock stress tolerance. These results suggest that OsDREB2B is a key gene that encodes a stress-inducible DREB2-type transcription factor that functions in stress-responsive gene expression in rice.
NA	OsDREB2B, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, negatively regulates plant height by conferring GA metabolism in rice.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Jilin Provincial Engineering Laboratory of Plant Genetic Improvement, College of Plant Science, Jilin University, Changchun, China.	The AP2/ERF family is a large group of plant-specific transcription factors that play an important role in many biological processes, such as growth, development, and abiotic stress responses. OsDREB2B, a dehydration responsive factor (DRE/CRT) in the DREB subgroup of the AP2/ERF family, is associated with abiotic stress responses, such as cold, drought, salt, and heat stress, in Arabidopsis or rice. However, its role in regulating plant growth and development in rice is unclear. In this study, we reported a new function of OsDREB2B, which negatively regulates plant height in rice. Compared with wild type (WT), OsDREB2B-overexpressing (OE) rice exhibited dwarf phenotypes, such as reduction in plant height, internode length, and seed length, as well as grain yield, while the knockout mutants developed by CRISPR/Cas9 technology exhibited similar phenotypes. Spatial expression analysis revealed that OsDREB2B was highly expressed in the leaf sheaths. Under exogenous GA(3) application, OsDREB2B expression was induced, and the length of the second leaf sheath of the OsDREB2B-OE lines recovered to that of the WT. OsDREB2B localized to the nucleus of the rice protoplast acted as a transcription activator and upregulated OsAP2-39 by directly binding to its promoter. OsDREB2B-OE lines reduced endogenous bioactive GA levels by downregulating seven GA biosynthesis genes and upregulating eight GA deactivation genes but not GA signaling genes. The yeast two-hybrid assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay showed that OsDREB2B interacted with OsWRKY21. In summary, our study suggests that OsDREB2B plays a negative role in rice growth and development by regulating GA metabolic gene expression, which is mediated by OsAP2-39 and OsWRKY21, thereby reducing GA content and rice plant height.
