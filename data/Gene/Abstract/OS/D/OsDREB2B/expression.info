OsDREB2B	 Spatial expression analysis revealed that OsDREB2B was highly expressed in the leaf sheaths |  Under exogenous GA(3) application, OsDREB2B expression was induced, and the length of the second leaf sheath of the OsDREB2B-OE lines recovered to that of the WT |  In summary, our study suggests that OsDREB2B plays a negative role in rice growth and development by regulating GA metabolic gene expression, which is mediated by OsAP2-39 and OsWRKY21, thereby reducing GA content and rice plant height
