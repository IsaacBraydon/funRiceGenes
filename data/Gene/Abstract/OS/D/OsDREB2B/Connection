OsDREB2B	OsMKK1|OsMEK2	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	By comparing the transcription factors levels between WT and osmkk1 mutant, OsMKK1 was necessary for salt-induced increase in OsDREB2B and OsMYBS3
OsDREB2B	OsJRL	OsJRL, a rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin gene, enhances Escherichia coli viability under high-salinity stress and improves salinity tolerance of rice.	Overexpression of OsJRL in rice also enhanced salinity tolerance and increased the expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including three LEA (late embryogenesis abundant proteins) genes (OsLEA19a, OsLEA23 and OsLEA24), three Na(+) transporter genes (OsHKT1;3, OsHKT1;4 and OsHKT1;5) and two DREB genes (OsDREB1A and OsDREB2B)
OsAP2-39	OsDREB2B	OsDREB2B, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, negatively regulates plant height by conferring GA metabolism in rice.	 OsDREB2B localized to the nucleus of the rice protoplast acted as a transcription activator and upregulated OsAP2-39 by directly binding to its promoter
OsAP2-39	OsDREB2B	OsDREB2B, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, negatively regulates plant height by conferring GA metabolism in rice.	 In summary, our study suggests that OsDREB2B plays a negative role in rice growth and development by regulating GA metabolic gene expression, which is mediated by OsAP2-39 and OsWRKY21, thereby reducing GA content and rice plant height
