In this study, we have isolated a cDNA clone that encoded a DRE-binding protein from rice cDNA library using the yeast one-hybrid system with DRE cis-acting element in the promoter region of rd29A gene as bait. Sequence analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence showed this protein was a putative AP2/EREBP transcription factor with a conserved AP2/EREBP domain and a potential nuclear localization signal (NLS). Expression pattern studies of this DRE-binding protein revealed that this gene was not only strongly induced by cold-temperature as reported by previous study but also induced by high-temperature as well. For the purpose of analyzing this gene conveniently, we attempted to apply the codon optimization method to reconstruct the gene of transcription factor in plants. A new sequence having decreasing GC contents, secondary structures, optimized codons and identical amino acid sequence with native gene was synthesized, which named OsDREB1BI, and then this optimized gene was transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana cv. Columbia by floral dip method. Results indicated that the OsDREB1BI gene was over-expressed in transgenic plants under cold and high-temperature, meanwhile, those transgenic plants also revealed freezing and heat tolerance. These might lay a strong foundation for exploiting the freezing and heat tolerance of rice and other species.
J. Exp. Bot.-2012-Figueiredo-3643-56.pdf	Seven zinc-finger transcription factors are novel regulators of the stress responsive gene OsDREB1B	2012	J Exp Bot	Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica, Universidade Nova de Lisboa and Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnologica, Oeiras, Portugal.	Plants have evolved several mechanisms in order to cope with adverse environmental conditions. The transcription factors (TFs) belonging to the DREB1/CBF subfamily have been described as major regulators of the plant responses to different abiotic stresses. This study focused on the rice gene OsDREB1B, initially described as highly and specifically induced by cold. However, here it is shown that OsDREB1B is not only induced by low temperatures, but also by drought and mechanical stress. In order to identify novel TFs that bind to its promoter, a yeast one-hybrid system was used to screen a cold-induced cDNA expression library. Thereby seven novel Zn-finger TFs were identified that bind to the promoter of OsDREB1B. Among them, there were four Zn-finger homeodomain (ZF-HD) and three C(2)H(2)-type Zn-finger TFs. Gene expression studies showed that these TFs are differentially regulated at transcriptional level by different abiotic stress conditions, which is illustrative of the crosstalk between stress signalling pathways. Protein-protein interaction studies revealed the formation of homo- and heterodimers among the ZF-HD TFs identified, but not for the C(2)H(2)-type. Using a transactivation assay in Arabidopsis protoplasts, all the TFs identified repressed the expression of the reporter gene, driven by the promoter of OsDREB1B. This assay also showed that the dimerization observed between the ZF-HD TFs may play a role on their transactivation activity. The results here presented suggest a prominent role of Zn-finger TFs in the regulation of OsDREB1B.
j.1365-313X.2003.01661.x.pdf	OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression	2003	The Plant Journal	Biological Resources Division, Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences (JIRCAS), 1-1 Ohwashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8686, Japan.	The transcription factors DREBs/CBFs specifically interact with the dehydration-responsive element/C-repeat (DRE/CRT) cis-acting element (core motif: G/ACCGAC) and control the expression of many stress-inducible genes in Arabidopsis. In rice, we isolated five cDNAs for DREB homologs: OsDREB1A, OsDREB1B, OsDREB1C, OsDREB1D, and OsDREB2A. Expression of OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B was induced by cold, whereas expression of OsDREB2A was induced by dehydration and high-salt stresses. The OsDREB1A and OsDREB2A proteins specifically bound to DRE and activated the transcription of the GUS reporter gene driven by DRE in rice protoplasts. Over-expression of OsDREB1A in transgenic Arabidopsis induced over-expression of target stress-inducible genes of Arabidopsis DREB1A resulting in plants with higher tolerance to drought, high-salt, and freezing stresses. This indicated that OsDREB1A has functional similarity to DREB1A. However, in microarray and RNA blot analyses, some stress-inducible target genes of the DREB1A proteins that have only ACCGAC as DRE were not over-expressed in the OsDREB1A transgenic Arabidopsis. The OsDREB1A protein bound to GCCGAC more preferentially than to ACCGAC whereas the DREB1A proteins bound to both GCCGAC and ACCGAC efficiently. The structures of DREB1-type ERF/AP2 domains in monocots are closely related to each other as compared with that in the dicots. OsDREB1A is potentially useful for producing transgenic monocots that are tolerant to drought, high-salt, and/or cold stresses.
pone.0047275.pdf	Colinearity and similar expression pattern of rice DREB1s reveal their functional conservation in the cold-responsive pathway	2012	PLoS One	Key Laboratory of Agro-Ecological Processes in Subtropical Region, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changsha, China.	The clustered genes C-repeat (CRT) binding factor (CBF)1/dehydration-responsive element binding protein (DREB)1B, CBF2/DREB1C, and CBF3/DREB1A play a central role in cold acclimation and facilitate plant resistance to freezing in Arabidopsis thaliana. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is very sensitive to low temperatures; enhancing the cold stress tolerance of rice is a key challenge to increasing its yield. In this study, we demonstrate chilling acclimation, a phenomenon similar to Arabidopsis cold acclimation, in rice. To determine whether rice CBF/DREB1 genes participate in this cold-responsive pathway, all putative homologs of Arabidopsis DREB1 genes were filtered from the complete rice genome through a BLASTP search, followed by phylogenetic, colinearity and expression analysis. We thereby identified 10 rice genes as putative DREB1 homologs: nine of these were located in rice genomic regions with some colinearity to the Arabidopsis CBF1-CBF4 region. Expression profiling revealed that six of these genes (Os01g73770, Os02g45450, Os04g48350, Os06g03670, Os09g35010, and Os09g35030) were similarly expressed in response to chilling acclimation and cold stress and were co-expressed with genes involved in cold signalling, suggesting that these DREB1 homologs may be involved in the cold response in rice. The results presented here serve as a prelude towards understanding the function of rice homologs of DREB1 genes in cold-sensitive crops.

CBF/DREB (C-repeat binding factor/dehydration responsive element binding factor) family of transcription factors in plants is reported to be associated with regulation of gene expression under stress conditions. Here, we report the functional characterization of a DREB transcription factor, DREB1B gene from rice (Oryza sativa ssp. indica). The OsDREB1B gene was differentially regulated at the transcriptional level by osmotic stress, oxidative stress, salicylic acid, ABA, and cold. A 745 bp promoter region of OsDREB1B cDNA was fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene and introduced via Agrobacterium tumifaciens into the genome of Arabidopsis. Histochemical analysis of GUS expression in T(2) transgenic Arabidopsis plants indicated that OsDREB1B shows stress-specific induction pattern in response to a variety of stresses like mannitol, NaCl, PEG, methyl viologen, cold, ABA, and salicylic acid. Leaf-order-dependent induction pattern of the promoter was observed in response to both cold and ABA stresses. Further, OsDREB1B cDNA was introduced into tobacco plants under the control of CaMV35S promoter to investigate the role of DREB1B product in plant stress response. Transgenic tobacco plants have shown improved seed germination, root growth, membrane stability, and 2, 2-diphenyl-1-pycrilhydrazil hydrate (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity under inhibitory concentrations of mannitol. Importantly, transgenic plants accumulated higher fresh weight under long-term osmotic stress, and also have shown retention of more water than the wild type during drought stress. Overexpression of OsDREB1B in tobacco also improved the oxidative and freezing stress tolerance of transgenic plants. In addition, tobacco plants constitutively expressing OsDREB1B have shown decreased sensitivity to tobacco streak virus infection. Constitutive expression of OsDREB1B in tobacco also induced the expression of PR genes in transgenic plants. The data obtained provide strong in vivo evidence that OsDREB1B is involved in both abiotic and biotic stress responses, and confers broad-spectrum stress tolerance to transgenic plants.
NA	OsWRKY28 positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice.	2022	Plant Cell Rep	Jilin Province Engineering Laboratory of Plant Genetic Improvement, College of Plant Science, Jilin University, Changchun, 130062, People&#x27;s Republic of China.	OsWRKY28 confers salinity tolerance by directly binding to OsDREB1B promoter and increasing its transcriptional activity, and negatively regulates abscisic acid mediated seedling establishment in rice. WRKY transcription factors have been reported to play a vital role in plants growth, development, abiotic and biotic stress responses. In this study, we explored the functions of a transcription factor OsWRKY28 in rice. The transcript level of OsWRKY28 was strikingly increased under drought, chilling, salt and abscisic acid treatments. The OsWRKY28 overexpression lines showed enhanced salinity stress tolerance, whereas the oswrky28 mutants displayed salt sensitivity compared to wild-type plants. Under salt stress treatment, the expression levels of OsbZIP05, OsHKT1;1 and OsDREB1B were significantly lower yet the level of OsHKT2;1 was significantly higher in oswrky28 mutants than those in wide type plants. Our data of yeast one-hybrid assay and dual-luciferase assay supported that OsWRKY28 could directly bind to the promoter of OsDREB1B to enhance salinity tolerance in rice. In addition, OsWRKY28 overexpression lines displayed hyposensitivity and the oswrky28 mutants showed hypersensitivity compared to wild-type plants under exogenous abscisic acid treatment. Based on the results of yeast two-hybrid assay and GAL4-dependent chimeric transactivation assay, OsWRKY28 physically interacts with OsMPK11 and its transcriptional activity could be regulated by OsMPK11. Together, OsWRKY28 confers salinity tolerance through directly targeting OsDREB1B promoter and further activating its transcription in rice.
