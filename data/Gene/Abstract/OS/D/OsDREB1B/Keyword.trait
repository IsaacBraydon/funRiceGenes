OsDREB1B	salicylic acid	Rice DREB1B promoter shows distinct stress-specific responses, and the overexpression of cDNA in tobacco confers improved abiotic and biotic stress tolerance	 The OsDREB1B gene was differentially regulated at the transcriptional level by osmotic stress, oxidative stress, salicylic acid, ABA, and cold
OsDREB1B	salicylic acid	Rice DREB1B promoter shows distinct stress-specific responses, and the overexpression of cDNA in tobacco confers improved abiotic and biotic stress tolerance	 Histochemical analysis of GUS expression in T(2) transgenic Arabidopsis plants indicated that OsDREB1B shows stress-specific induction pattern in response to a variety of stresses like mannitol, NaCl, PEG, methyl viologen, cold, ABA, and salicylic acid
OsDREB1B	transcription factor	Seven zinc-finger transcription factors are novel regulators of the stress responsive gene OsDREB1B	Seven zinc-finger transcription factors are novel regulators of the stress responsive gene OsDREB1B
OsDREB1B	salt	"OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression"	" Expression of OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B was induced by cold, whereas expression of OsDREB2A was induced by dehydration and high-salt stresses"
OsDREB1B	temperature	Seven zinc-finger transcription factors are novel regulators of the stress responsive gene OsDREB1B	" However, here it is shown that OsDREB1B is not only induced by low temperatures, but also by drought and mechanical stress"
OsDREB1B	drought	Seven zinc-finger transcription factors are novel regulators of the stress responsive gene OsDREB1B	" However, here it is shown that OsDREB1B is not only induced by low temperatures, but also by drought and mechanical stress"
OsDREB1B	biotic stress	"Rice DREB1B promoter shows distinct stress-specific responses, and the overexpression of cDNA in tobacco confers improved abiotic and biotic stress tolerance"	" The data obtained provide strong in vivo evidence that OsDREB1B is involved in both abiotic and biotic stress responses, and confers broad-spectrum stress tolerance to transgenic plants"
OsDREB1B	salt stress	"OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression"	" Expression of OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B was induced by cold, whereas expression of OsDREB2A was induced by dehydration and high-salt stresses"
OsDREB1B	transcription factor	Isolation, optimization, and functional analysis of the cDNA encoding transcription factor OsDREB1B in Oryza Sativa L	Isolation, optimization, and functional analysis of the cDNA encoding transcription factor OsDREB1B in Oryza Sativa L
OsDREB1B	temperature	"Isolation, optimization, and functional analysis of the cDNA encoding transcription factor OsDREB1B in Oryza Sativa L"	" Results indicated that the OsDREB1BI gene was over-expressed in transgenic plants under cold and high-temperature, meanwhile, those transgenic plants also revealed freezing and heat tolerance"
OsDREB1B	oxidative	"Rice DREB1B promoter shows distinct stress-specific responses, and the overexpression of cDNA in tobacco confers improved abiotic and biotic stress tolerance"	" The OsDREB1B gene was differentially regulated at the transcriptional level by osmotic stress, oxidative stress, salicylic acid, ABA, and cold
OsDREB1B	oxidative	"Rice DREB1B promoter shows distinct stress-specific responses, and the overexpression of cDNA in tobacco confers improved abiotic and biotic stress tolerance"	 Overexpression of OsDREB1B in tobacco also improved the oxidative and freezing stress tolerance of transgenic plants"
