OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	OsDREB1B	OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression	 In rice, we isolated five cDNAs for DREB homologs: OsDREB1A, OsDREB1B, OsDREB1C, OsDREB1D, and OsDREB2A| Expression of OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B was induced by cold, whereas expression of OsDREB2A was induced by dehydration and high-salt stresses

OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	OsDREB1B	Allele mining across DREB1A and DREB1B in diverse rice genotypes suggest a highly conserved pathway inducible by low temperature.	 In order to understand whether natural genetic variation in these two loci leads to cold tolerance or susceptibility, OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B were targeted across several rice genotypes showing differential response to low temperature
