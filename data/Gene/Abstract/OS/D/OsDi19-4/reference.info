NA	Identification of rice Di19 family reveals OsDi19-4 involved in drought resistance.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.	The OsDi19 proteins functioned as transcription factors and played crucial roles in response to abiotic stress. Overexpression of OsDi19-4 in rice increased drought tolerance by enhancing ROS-scavenging activity. Many transcription factors play crucial roles in plant responses to abiotic stress. Here, comprehensive sequence analysis suggested that the drought-induced 19 (Di19) gene family in rice genome contain seven members, and these proteins contained a well-conserved zinc-finger Di19 domain. Most OsDi19 proteins were mainly targeted to the nucleus and have transactivation activity in yeast. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that most OsDi19 proteins could form protein dimers. Expression analysis demonstrated that the OsDi19 genes were differentially and abundantly expressed in vegetative tissues, but expressed little in reproductive tissues and some of the OsDi19 genes were markedly induced by abiotic stresses and hormones in qRT-PCR analysis and microarray data. Overexpression of one stress-responsive gene, OsDi19-4, in rice resulted in significantly increased tolerance to drought stress compared with the wild type plants. Moreover, obviously increased ROS-scavenging ability was detected in the OsDi19-4-overexpressing plants under normal and drought stress conditions. These results suggested that the increased stress tolerance of OsDi19-4-overexpressing plants may be attributable to the enhanced ROS-scavenging activity. Taken together, these studies provide a detailed overview of the rice Di19 gene family, and suggest that the OsDi19 family may play crucial roles in the plant response to abiotic stress.
NA	OsDi19-4 acts downstream of OsCDPK14 to positively regulate ABA response in rice.	2016	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.	Drought-induced 19 protein family consists of several atypical Cys2/His2-type zinc-finger proteins in plants and plays an important role in abiotic stress. In this study, we found that overexpressing OsDi19-4 in rice altered the expression of a series of ABA-responsive genes, resulting in strong ABA hypersensitive phenotypes including ABA-induced seed germination inhibition, early seedling growth inhibition and stomatal closure. On the contrary, OsDi19-4 knock-down lines were less sensitive to ABA. Additionally, OsCDPK14 was identified to interact with OsDi19-4 and be responsible for the phosphorylation of OsDi19-4, and the phosphorylation of OsDi19-4 was further enhanced after the treatment of ABA. Apart from these, OsDi19-4 was shown to directly bind to the promoters of OsASPG1 and OsNAC18 genes, two ABA-responsive genes, and regulate their expression. Transient expression assays confirmed the direct regulation role of OsDi19-4, and the regulation was further enhanced by the increased phosphorylation of OsDi19-4 after the treatment of ABA. Taken together, these data demonstrate that OsDi19-4 acts downstream of OsCDPK14 to positively regulate ABA response by modulating the expression of ABA-responsive genes in rice.
