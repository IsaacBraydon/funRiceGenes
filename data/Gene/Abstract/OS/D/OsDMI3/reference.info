Appl. Environ. Microbiol.-2014-Bao-AEM.03646-13.pdf	A rice gene for microbial symbiosis, Oryza sativa CCaMK, reduces CH4 flux in a paddy field with low nitrogen input	2014	Appl Environ Microbiol	Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Katahira, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.	Plants have mutualistic symbiotic relationships with rhizobia and fungi by the common symbiosis pathway, of which Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (encoded by CCaMK) is a central component. Although Oryza sativa CCaMK (OsCCaMK) is required for fungal accommodation in rice roots, little is known about the role of OsCCaMK in rice symbiosis with bacteria. Here, we report the effect of a Tos17-induced OsCCaMK mutant (NE1115) on CH4 flux in low-nitrogen (LN) and standard-nitrogen (SN) paddy fields compared with wild-type (WT) Nipponbare. The growth of NE1115 was significantly decreased compared with that of the WT, especially in the LN field. The CH4 flux of NE1115 in the LN field was significantly greater (156 to 407% in 2011 and 170 to 816% in 2012) than that of the WT, although no difference was observed in the SN field. The copy number of pmoA (encodes methane monooxygenase in methanotrophs) was significantly higher in the roots and rhizosphere soil of the WT than in those of NE1115. However, the mcrA (encodes methyl coenzyme M reductase in methanogens) copy number did not differ between the WT and NE1115. These results were supported by a (13)C-labeled CH4-feeding experiment. In addition, the natural abundance of (15)N in WT shoots (3.05 per thousand) was significantly lower than in NE1115 shoots (3.45 per thousand), suggesting greater N2 fixation in the WT because of dilution with atmospheric N2 (0.00 per thousand). Thus, CH4 oxidation and N2 fixation were simultaneously activated in the root zone of WT rice in the LN field and both processes are likely controlled by OsCCaMK.
Mol. Plant-2012-Shi-1359-74.pdf	OsDMI3 is a novel component of abscisic acid signaling in the induction of antioxidant defense in leaves of rice	2012	Mol Plant	College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Ca(2+) and calmodulin (CaM) have been shown to play an important role in abscisic acid (ABA)-induced antioxidant defense. However, it is unknown whether Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) is involved in the process. In the present study, the role of rice CCaMK, OsDMI3, in ABA-induced antioxidant defense was investigated in leaves of rice (Oryza sativa) plants. Treatments with ABA, H(2)O(2), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) induced the expression of OsDMI3 and the activity of OsDMI3, and H(2)O(2) is required for the ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activity of OsDMI3 under water stress. Subcellular localization analysis showed that OsDMI3 is located in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, and the plasma membrane. The analysis of the transient expression of OsDMI3 in rice protoplasts and the RNA interference (RNAi) silencing of OsDMI3 in rice protoplasts showed that OsDMI3 is required for ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Further, the oxidative damage induced by higher concentrations of PEG and H(2)O(2) was aggravated in the mutant of OsDMI3. Moreover, the analysis of the RNAi silencing of OsDMI3 in protoplasts and the mutant of OsDMI3 showed that higher levels of H(2)O(2) accumulation require OsDMI3 activation in ABA signaling, but the initial H(2)O(2) production induced by ABA is not dependent on the activation of OsDMI3 in leaves of rice plants. Our data reveal that OsDMI3 is an important component in ABA-induced antioxidant defense in rice.
pce12154.pdf	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice	2014	Plant Cell Environ	College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	In rice, the Ca(2+) /calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) OsDMI3 has been shown to be required for abscisic acid (ABA)-induced antioxidant defence. However, it is not clear how OsDMI3 participates in this process in rice. In this study, the cross-talk between OsDMI3 and the major ABA-activated MAPK OsMPK1 in ABA-induced antioxidant defence was investigated. ABA treatment induced the expression of OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 and the activities of OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 in rice leaves. In the mutant of OsDMI3, the ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activity of OsMPK1 were substantially reduced. But in the mutant of OsMPK1, the ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activity of OsDMI3 were not affected. Pretreatments with MAPKK inhibitors also did not affect the ABA-induced activation of OsDMI3. Further, a transient expression analysis in combination with mutant analysis in rice protoplasts showed that OsMPK1 is required for OsDMI3-induced increases in the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the production of H2 O2 . Our data indicate that there exists a cross-talk between OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 in ABA signalling, in which OsDMI3 functions upstream of OsMPK1 to regulate the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the production of H2 O2 in rice.
Plant Physiol.-2007-Chen-1619-28.pdf	Fungal symbiosis in rice requires an ortholog of a legume common symbiosis gene encoding a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase	2007	Plant Physiol	Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40546, USA.	In natural ecosystems, many plants are able to establish mutually beneficial symbioses with microorganisms. Of critical importance to sustainable agriculture are the symbioses formed between more than 80% of terrestrial plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and between legumes and nitrogen-fixing rhizobial bacteria. Interestingly, the two symbioses share overlapping signaling pathways in legumes, suggesting that the evolutionarily recent root nodule symbiosis may have acquired functions from the ancient AM symbiosis. The Medicago truncatula DMI3 (DOESN'T MAKE INFECTIONS3) gene (MtDMI3) and its orthologs in legumes are required for both bacterial and fungal symbioses. MtDMI3 encodes a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) essential for the transduction of the Ca(2+) signal induced by the perception of Nod factors. Putative orthologs of MtDMI3 are also present in non-legumes, but their function in AM symbiosis has not been demonstrated in any non-legume species. Here, we combine reverse genetic approaches and a cross-species complementation test to characterize the function of the rice (Oryza sativa) ortholog of MtDMI3, namely, OsDMI3, in AM symbiosis. We demonstrate that OsDMI3 is not only required for AM symbiosis in rice but also is able to complement a M. truncatula dmi3 mutant, indicating an equivalent role of MtDMI3 orthologs in non-legumes.
PNAS-2008-Yano-0806858105.pdf	CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Biotechnology, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.	The initiation of intracellular infection of legume roots by symbiotic rhizobia bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) fungi is preceded by the induction of calcium signatures in and around the nucleus of root epidermal cells. Although a calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinase (CCaMK) is a key mediator of symbiotic root responses, the decoding of the calcium signal and the molecular events downstream are only poorly understood. Here, we characterize Lotus japonicus cyclops mutants on which microbial infection was severely inhibited. In contrast, nodule organogenesis was initiated in response to rhizobia, but arrested prematurely. This arrest was overcome when a deregulated CCaMK mutant version was introduced into cyclops mutants, conferring the development of full-sized, spontaneous nodules. Because cyclops mutants block symbiotic infection but are competent for nodule development, they reveal a bifurcation of signal transduction downstream of CCaMK. We identified CYCLOPS by positional cloning. CYCLOPS carries a functional nuclear localization signal and a predicted coiled-coil domain. We observed colocalization and physical interaction between CCaMK and CYCLOPS in plant and yeast cell nuclei in the absence of symbiotic stimulation. Importantly, CYCLOPS is a phosphorylation substrate of CCaMK in vitro. Cyclops mutants of rice were impaired in AM, and rice CYCLOPS could restore symbiosis in Lotus cyclops mutants, indicating a functional conservation across angiosperms. Our results suggest that CYCLOPS forms an ancient, preassembled signal transduction complex with CCaMK that is specifically required for infection, whereas organogenesis likely requires additional yet-to-be identified CCaMK interactors or substrates.
NA	Abscisic Acid Inhibits Rice Protein Phosphatase PP45 via H2O2 and Relieves Repression of the Ca2+/CaM-Dependent Protein Kinase DMI3.	2018	Plant Cell	Nanjing Agricultural University CITY: Nanjing China [CN].	In plants, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) is a positive regulator of abscisic acid (ABA) responses, including root growth, antioxidant defense and tolerance of both water stress and oxidative stress. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show a direct interaction between DMI3, a rice (Oryza sativa) CCaMK and PP45, a type 2C protein phosphatase in rice (PP2C). This interaction involves the CaM-binding domain of DMI3 and the PP2C domain of PP45. In the absence of ABA, PP45 directly inactivates DMI3 by dephosphorylating Thr-263 in DMI3. However, in the presence of ABA, ABA-induced H2O2 production by the NADPH oxidases RbohB/E inhibits the activity of PP45 not only by inhibiting the expression of PP45 but also by oxidizing Cys-350 and Cys-428 residues to form PP45 intermolecular dimers. ABA-induced oxidation of Cys-350 and Cys-428 in PP45 blocked the interaction between PP45 and DMI3 and substantially prevented PP45-mediated inhibition in DMI3 activity. Genetic analysis indicated that PP45 is an important negative regulator of ABA signaling. These results reveal important pathways for the inhibition of DMI3 under the basal state and for its ABA-induced activation in rice.
NA	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase OsDMI3 positively regulates saline-alkaline tolerance in rice roots	2020	Plant Signal Behav	College of Life Sciences, National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Crop Physiology Ecology and Production Management, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University , Nanjing, China.	Soil saline-alkalization is a major environmental stress that impairs plant growth and crop productivity. Plant roots are the primary site for the perception of soil stresses; however, the regulation mechanism engaged in the saline-alkaline stress response in plant roots is not well understood. In this study, we identified how a rice Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, OsDMI3, confers saline-alkaline tolerance in rice root growth. We measured the OsDMI3 activity by an in-gel kinase assay, Na+ content by NaHCO3 treatment, and Na+ and H+ fluxes by noninvasive micro-test technology (NMT). Furthermore, a real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed to identify the genes upregulated in response to NaHCO3 treatment in rice roots. The results showed that NaHCO3 significantly increased OsDMI3 expression and activity in rice roots. This was consistent with the results of Na+ content and NMT that indicated OsDMI3 promoted root elongation under saline-alkaline stress by reducing root Na+ and H+ influx. Moreover, real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsDMI3 up-regulated the transcript levels of OsSOS1 and PM-H+-ATPase genes OsA3 and OsA8 in saline-alkaline stressed rice plants. Collectively, our results suggest that OsDMI3 could promote saline-alkaline tolerance in rice roots by modulating the Na+ and H+ influx. These findings provide an important genetic target for protection of growth in rice exposed to saline-alkaline stress.
