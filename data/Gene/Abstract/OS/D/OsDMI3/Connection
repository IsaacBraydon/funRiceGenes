OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice	 In this study, the cross-talk between OsDMI3 and the major ABA-activated MAPK OsMPK1 in ABA-induced antioxidant defence was investigated
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice	 ABA treatment induced the expression of OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 and the activities of OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 in rice leaves
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice	 In the mutant of OsDMI3, the ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activity of OsMPK1 were substantially reduced
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice	 But in the mutant of OsMPK1, the ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activity of OsDMI3 were not affected
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice	 Further, a transient expression analysis in combination with mutant analysis in rice protoplasts showed that OsMPK1 is required for OsDMI3-induced increases in the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the production of H2 O2 
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice	 Our data indicate that there exists a cross-talk between OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 in ABA signalling, in which OsDMI3 functions upstream of OsMPK1 to regulate the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the production of H2 O2 in rice

CYCLOPS|OsIPD3	OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation	 This arrest was overcome when a deregulated CCaMK mutant version was introduced into cyclops mutants, conferring the development of full-sized, spontaneous nodules
CYCLOPS|OsIPD3	OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation	 Because cyclops mutants block symbiotic infection but are competent for nodule development, they reveal a bifurcation of signal transduction downstream of CCaMK
CYCLOPS|OsIPD3	OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation	 We observed colocalization and physical interaction between CCaMK and CYCLOPS in plant and yeast cell nuclei in the absence of symbiotic stimulation
CYCLOPS|OsIPD3	OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation	 Importantly, CYCLOPS is a phosphorylation substrate of CCaMK in vitro
CYCLOPS|OsIPD3	OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation	 Our results suggest that CYCLOPS forms an ancient, preassembled signal transduction complex with CCaMK that is specifically required for infection, whereas organogenesis likely requires additional yet-to-be identified CCaMK interactors or substrates
