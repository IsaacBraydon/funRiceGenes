OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice	In this study, the cross-talk between OsDMI3 and the major ABA-activated MAPK OsMPK1 in ABA-induced antioxidant defence was investigated
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice	ABA treatment induced the expression of OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 and the activities of OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 in rice leaves
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice	In the mutant of OsDMI3, the ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activity of OsMPK1 were substantially reduced
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice	But in the mutant of OsMPK1, the ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activity of OsDMI3 were not affected
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice	Further, a transient expression analysis in combination with mutant analysis in rice protoplasts showed that OsMPK1 is required for OsDMI3-induced increases in the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the production of H2 O2
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice	Our data indicate that there exists a cross-talk between OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 in ABA signalling, in which OsDMI3 functions upstream of OsMPK1 to regulate the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the production of H2 O2 in rice
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice
CYCLOPS|OsIPD3	OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation	We observed colocalization and physical interaction between CCaMK and CYCLOPS in plant and yeast cell nuclei in the absence of symbiotic stimulation
CYCLOPS|OsIPD3	OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation	Importantly, CYCLOPS is a phosphorylation substrate of CCaMK in vitro
CYCLOPS|OsIPD3	OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation	Our results suggest that CYCLOPS forms an ancient, preassembled signal transduction complex with CCaMK that is specifically required for infection, whereas organogenesis likely requires additional yet-to-be identified CCaMK interactors or substrates
OsA3	OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase OsDMI3 positively regulates saline-alkaline tolerance in rice roots	 Moreover, real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsDMI3 up-regulated the transcript levels of OsSOS1 and PM-H+-ATPase genes OsA3 and OsA8 in saline-alkaline stressed rice plants
OsA8	OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase OsDMI3 positively regulates saline-alkaline tolerance in rice roots	 Moreover, real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsDMI3 up-regulated the transcript levels of OsSOS1 and PM-H+-ATPase genes OsA3 and OsA8 in saline-alkaline stressed rice plants
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	OsNHA1|OsSOS1	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase OsDMI3 positively regulates saline-alkaline tolerance in rice roots	 Moreover, real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsDMI3 up-regulated the transcript levels of OsSOS1 and PM-H+-ATPase genes OsA3 and OsA8 in saline-alkaline stressed rice plants
