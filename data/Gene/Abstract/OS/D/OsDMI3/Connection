OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice	 In this study, the cross-talk between OsDMI3 and the major ABA-activated MAPK OsMPK1 in ABA-induced antioxidant defence was investigated| ABA treatment induced the expression of OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 and the activities of OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 in rice leaves| In the mutant of OsDMI3, the ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activity of OsMPK1 were substantially reduced| But in the mutant of OsMPK1, the ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activity of OsDMI3 were not affected| Further, a transient expression analysis in combination with mutant analysis in rice protoplasts showed that OsMPK1 is required for OsDMI3-induced increases in the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the production of H2 O2 | Our data indicate that there exists a cross-talk between OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 in ABA signalling, in which OsDMI3 functions upstream of OsMPK1 to regulate the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the production of H2 O2 in rice|OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice
CYCLOPS|OsIPD3	OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation	 This arrest was overcome when a deregulated CCaMK mutant version was introduced into cyclops mutants, conferring the development of full-sized, spontaneous nodules| Because cyclops mutants block symbiotic infection but are competent for nodule development, they reveal a bifurcation of signal transduction downstream of CCaMK| We observed colocalization and physical interaction between CCaMK and CYCLOPS in plant and yeast cell nuclei in the absence of symbiotic stimulation| Importantly, CYCLOPS is a phosphorylation substrate of CCaMK in vitro| Our results suggest that CYCLOPS forms an ancient, preassembled signal transduction complex with CCaMK that is specifically required for infection, whereas organogenesis likely requires additional yet-to-be identified CCaMK interactors or substrates
