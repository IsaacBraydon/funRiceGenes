OsD-LDH	 Characterization of the expression profile, subcellular localization, and enzymatic properties of the functional OsD-LDH revealed that it is a mitochondrial cytochrome-c-dependent D-LDH with high affinity and catalytic efficiency	 Functional analysis of OsD-LDH RNAi transgenic rice demonstrated that OsD-LDH participates in methylglyoxal metabolism by affecting the activity of the glyoxalase system and aldo-keto reductases |  Moreover, the detached leaves of OsD-LDH RNAi plants were more sensitive to salt stress
