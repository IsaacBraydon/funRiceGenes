OsD-LDH	growth	Silencing of D-Lactate Dehydrogenase Impedes Glyoxalase System and Leads to Methylglyoxal Accumulation and Growth Inhibition in Rice.	 Under methylglyoxal treatment, silencing of OsD-LDH in rice resulted in the accumulation of methylglyoxal and D-lactate, the decrease of reduced glutathione in leaves, and ultimately severe growth inhibition
OsD-LDH	growth	Silencing of D-Lactate Dehydrogenase Impedes Glyoxalase System and Leads to Methylglyoxal Accumulation and Growth Inhibition in Rice.	 However, the silencing of OsD-LDH did not affect the growth under photorespiration conditions
OsD-LDH	salt	Silencing of D-Lactate Dehydrogenase Impedes Glyoxalase System and Leads to Methylglyoxal Accumulation and Growth Inhibition in Rice.	 Moreover, the detached leaves of OsD-LDH RNAi plants were more sensitive to salt stress
OsD-LDH	salt stress	Silencing of D-Lactate Dehydrogenase Impedes Glyoxalase System and Leads to Methylglyoxal Accumulation and Growth Inhibition in Rice.	 Moreover, the detached leaves of OsD-LDH RNAi plants were more sensitive to salt stress
OsD-LDH	stress	Silencing of D-Lactate Dehydrogenase Impedes Glyoxalase System and Leads to Methylglyoxal Accumulation and Growth Inhibition in Rice.	 Moreover, the detached leaves of OsD-LDH RNAi plants were more sensitive to salt stress
