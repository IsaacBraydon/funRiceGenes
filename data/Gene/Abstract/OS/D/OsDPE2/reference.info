NA	Expression and Characterization of Rice Disproportionating Enzymes	2011	Journal of Applied Glycoscience	Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Osaka Prefecture University	This work aims to characterize disproportionating enzyme (DPE1) and its isoform DPE2 in rice. Rice DPE genes (OsDPE1 and OsDPE2) were cloned and expressed in E. coli. The OsDPE1 and OsDPE2 genes encode proteins of 594 and 946 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 67 kDa and 108 kDa, respectively. Purified recombinant OsDPE1 and OsDPE2 showed highest activity at around pH 7.0 and pH 6.0-7.0, respectively. The optimum reaction temperature was 30°C for OsDPE1 and 39°C for OsDPE2. Recombinant OsDPE1 disproportionates maltotriose to produce glucose and maltopentaose, and thus shares the defining behavior of D-enzymes. In our experiments, recombinant OsDPE2 catalyzed the glucose transfer reaction from maltose to an acceptor molecule such as glycogen. We also characterized the differences between the diurnal transcription profiles of OsDPE1 and OsDPE2 in rice leaves and seeds, and their temporal expression levels in developing rice seeds.
NA	Cytosolic DISPROPORTIONATING ENZYME2 is essential for pollen germination and pollen tube elongation in rice.	2022	Plant Physiol	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	Degradation of starch accumulated in pollen provides energy and cellular materials for pollen germination and pollen-tube elongation. Little is known about the function of cytosolic DISPROPORTIONATING ENZYME2 (DPE2) in rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we obtained several DPE2 knockout mutant (dpe2) lines via genomic editing and found that the mutants grew and developed normally but with greatly reduced seed setting rates. Reciprocal crosses between dpe2 and wild-type plants demonstrated that the mutant was male sterile. In vitro and in vivo examinations revealed that the pollen of the dpe2 mutant developed and matured normally but was defective in germination and elongation. DPE2 deficiency increased maltose content in pollen, whereas it reduced the levels of starch, glucose, fructose and ATP. Exogenous supply of glucose or ATP to the germination medium partially rescued the pollen germination defects of dpe2. The expression of cytosolic PHOSPHORYLASE2 (Pho2) increased significantly in dpe2 pollen. Knockout of Pho2 resulted in a semi-sterile phenotype. We failed to obtain homozygous dpe2 pho2 double mutant lines. Our results demonstrate that maltose catalyzed by DPE2 to glucose is the main energy source for pollen germination and pollen-tube elongation, while Pho2 might partially compensate for deficiency of DPE2.
