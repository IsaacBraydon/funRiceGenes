OsDof12|OsCDF1	OsMADS51|OsMADS65	Functional characterization of rice OsDof12	 In transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12, the transcription levels of Hd3a and OsMADS14 were up-regulated under LD conditions but not SD conditions, whereas the expression of Hd1, OsMADS51, Ehd1 and OsGI did not change under LD and SD conditions
Ehd1	OsDof12|OsCDF1	Functional characterization of rice OsDof12	 In transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12, the transcription levels of Hd3a and OsMADS14 were up-regulated under LD conditions but not SD conditions, whereas the expression of Hd1, OsMADS51, Ehd1 and OsGI did not change under LD and SD conditions
OsDof12|OsCDF1	OsMADS14	Functional characterization of rice OsDof12	 In transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12, the transcription levels of Hd3a and OsMADS14 were up-regulated under LD conditions but not SD conditions, whereas the expression of Hd1, OsMADS51, Ehd1 and OsGI did not change under LD and SD conditions| These results suggested that OsDof12 might regulate flowering by controlling the expression of Hd3a and OsMADS14
