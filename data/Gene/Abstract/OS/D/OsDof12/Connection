OsDof12	OsMADS51|OsMADS65	Functional characterization of rice OsDof12	 In transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12, the transcription levels of Hd3a and OsMADS14 were up-regulated under LD conditions but not SD conditions, whereas the expression of Hd1, OsMADS51, Ehd1 and OsGI did not change under LD and SD conditions
Ehd1	OsDof12	Functional characterization of rice OsDof12	 In transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12, the transcription levels of Hd3a and OsMADS14 were up-regulated under LD conditions but not SD conditions, whereas the expression of Hd1, OsMADS51, Ehd1 and OsGI did not change under LD and SD conditions
OsDof12	OsMADS14	Functional characterization of rice OsDof12	 In transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12, the transcription levels of Hd3a and OsMADS14 were up-regulated under LD conditions but not SD conditions, whereas the expression of Hd1, OsMADS51, Ehd1 and OsGI did not change under LD and SD conditions| These results suggested that OsDof12 might regulate flowering by controlling the expression of Hd3a and OsMADS14
