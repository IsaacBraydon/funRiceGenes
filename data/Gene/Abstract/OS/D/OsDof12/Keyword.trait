OsDof12|OsCDF1	flowering time	Functional characterization of rice OsDof12	 The transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12 showed early flowering under long-day (LD) conditions, whereas OsDof12 overexpression had no effect on flowering time under short-day (SD) conditions
OsDof12|OsCDF1	flower	Functional characterization of rice OsDof12	 The transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12 showed early flowering under long-day (LD) conditions, whereas OsDof12 overexpression had no effect on flowering time under short-day (SD) conditions| These results suggested that OsDof12 might regulate flowering by controlling the expression of Hd3a and OsMADS14
OsDof12|OsCDF1	leaf	Overexpression of OsDof12 affects plant architecture in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Here, we further investigated the other important agronomical traits of the transgenic plants overexpressing OsDof12 and found that overexpressing OsDof12 could lead to reduced plant height, erected leaf, shortened leaf blade, and smaller panicle resulted from decreased primary and secondary branches number

OsDof12|OsCDF1	architecture	Overexpression of OsDof12 affects plant architecture in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Taken together, our results suggested that overexpression of OsDof12 could lead to altered plant architecture by suppressing BR signaling
OsDof12|OsCDF1	breeding	Overexpression of OsDof12 affects plant architecture in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Thus, OsDof12 might be used as a new potential genetic regulator for future rice molecular breeding
OsDof12|OsCDF1	BR signaling	Overexpression of OsDof12 affects plant architecture in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Of note, in WT plants the expression of OsDof12 was found up-regulated by BR treatment while in OsDof12 overexpression plants two positive BR signaling regulators, OsBRI1 and OsBZR1, were significantly down-regulated, indicating that OsDof12 may act as a negative BR regulator in rice
