OsDof12	flowering time	Functional characterization of rice OsDof12	 The transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12 showed early flowering under long-day (LD) conditions, whereas OsDof12 overexpression had no effect on flowering time under short-day (SD) conditions
OsDof12	flower	Functional characterization of rice OsDof12	 The transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12 showed early flowering under long-day (LD) conditions, whereas OsDof12 overexpression had no effect on flowering time under short-day (SD) conditions| These results suggested that OsDof12 might regulate flowering by controlling the expression of Hd3a and OsMADS14
