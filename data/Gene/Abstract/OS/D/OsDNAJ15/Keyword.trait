OsDNAJ15	leaf	Plasma membrane-localized Hsp40/DNAJ chaperone protein facilitates OsSUVH7-OsBAG4-OsMYB106 transcriptional complex formation for OsHKT1;5 activation.	 osdnaj15 loss-of-function mutants show decreased plant height, increased leaf angle, and reduced grain number caused by shorter panicle length and fewer branches
OsDNAJ15	grain	Plasma membrane-localized Hsp40/DNAJ chaperone protein facilitates OsSUVH7-OsBAG4-OsMYB106 transcriptional complex formation for OsHKT1;5 activation.	 osdnaj15 loss-of-function mutants show decreased plant height, increased leaf angle, and reduced grain number caused by shorter panicle length and fewer branches
OsDNAJ15	panicle	Plasma membrane-localized Hsp40/DNAJ chaperone protein facilitates OsSUVH7-OsBAG4-OsMYB106 transcriptional complex formation for OsHKT1;5 activation.	 osdnaj15 loss-of-function mutants show decreased plant height, increased leaf angle, and reduced grain number caused by shorter panicle length and fewer branches
OsDNAJ15	stress	Plasma membrane-localized Hsp40/DNAJ chaperone protein facilitates OsSUVH7-OsBAG4-OsMYB106 transcriptional complex formation for OsHKT1;5 activation.	 Intriguingly, salt stress facilitates the nuclear relocation of OsDNAJ15 so that it can interact with OsBAG4, and OsDNAJ15 and OsBAG4 synergistically facilitate the DNA-binding activity of OsMYB106 to positively regulate the expression of OsHKT1;5
