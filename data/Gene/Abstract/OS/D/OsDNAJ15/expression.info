OsDNAJ15	 On the other h&#x27;and, OsDNAJ15-overexpression plants showed salt stress-tolerant phenotypes |  Intriguingly, salt stress facilitates the nuclear relocation of OsDNAJ15 so that it can interact with OsBAG4, and OsDNAJ15 and OsBAG4 synergistically facilitate the DNA-binding activity of OsMYB106 to positively regulate the expression of OsHKT1;5	 On the other h&#x27;and, OsDNAJ15-overexpression plants showed salt stress-tolerant phenotypes
