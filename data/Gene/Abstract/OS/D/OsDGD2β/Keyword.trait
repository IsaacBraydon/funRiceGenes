OsDGD2β	pollen	OsDGD2β is the Sole Digalactosyldiacylglycerol Synthase Gene Highly Expressed in Anther, and its Mutation Confers Male Sterility in Rice.	 We then developed osdgd2β mutants by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and elucidate its role, especially in the development of anther and pollen
OsDGD2β	pollen	OsDGD2β is the Sole Digalactosyldiacylglycerol Synthase Gene Highly Expressed in Anther, and its Mutation Confers Male Sterility in Rice.	Overall, we showed the importance of DGDG in pollen development and loss of function of OsDGD2β results in male sterility
