GID1|OsGID1	OsDOR1	A rice seed-specific glycine-rich protein OsDOR1 interacts with GID1 to repress GA signaling and regulates seed dormancy.	A rice seed-specific glycine-rich protein OsDOR1 interacts with GID1 to repress GA signaling and regulates seed dormancy.
GID1|OsGID1	OsDOR1	A rice seed-specific glycine-rich protein OsDOR1 interacts with GID1 to repress GA signaling and regulates seed dormancy.	 Here, we demonstrated that OsDOR1 protein binds to the GA receptor protein, OsGID1 in rice protoplasts, and interrupts with the formation OsGID1-OsSLR1 complex in yeast cells
GID1|OsGID1	OsDOR1	A rice seed-specific glycine-rich protein OsDOR1 interacts with GID1 to repress GA signaling and regulates seed dormancy.	 Co-expression of OsDOR1 with OsGID1 in rice protoplasts attenuated the GA-dependent degradation of OsSLR1, the key repressor of GA signaling
OsDOR1	SLR1|OsGAI|OsSLR1	A rice seed-specific glycine-rich protein OsDOR1 interacts with GID1 to repress GA signaling and regulates seed dormancy.	 Co-expression of OsDOR1 with OsGID1 in rice protoplasts attenuated the GA-dependent degradation of OsSLR1, the key repressor of GA signaling
