OsDOR1	seed	A rice seed-specific glycine-rich protein OsDOR1 interacts with GID1 to repress GA signaling and regulates seed dormancy.	A rice seed-specific glycine-rich protein OsDOR1 interacts with GID1 to repress GA signaling and regulates seed dormancy.
OsDOR1	seed	A rice seed-specific glycine-rich protein OsDOR1 interacts with GID1 to repress GA signaling and regulates seed dormancy.	 Based on these findings, we suggest that OsDOR1 is a novel negative player of GA signaling operated in the maintenance of seed dormancy
OsDOR1	R protein	A rice seed-specific glycine-rich protein OsDOR1 interacts with GID1 to repress GA signaling and regulates seed dormancy.	 Here, we demonstrated that OsDOR1 protein binds to the GA receptor protein, OsGID1 in rice protoplasts, and interrupts with the formation OsGID1-OsSLR1 complex in yeast cells
OsDOR1	ga	A rice seed-specific glycine-rich protein OsDOR1 interacts with GID1 to repress GA signaling and regulates seed dormancy.	A rice seed-specific glycine-rich protein OsDOR1 interacts with GID1 to repress GA signaling and regulates seed dormancy.

OsDOR1	ga	A rice seed-specific glycine-rich protein OsDOR1 interacts with GID1 to repress GA signaling and regulates seed dormancy.	 Co-expression of OsDOR1 with OsGID1 in rice protoplasts attenuated the GA-dependent degradation of OsSLR1, the key repressor of GA signaling
