NA	Phenotypic and microarray analysis reveals salinity stress-induced oxidative tolerance in transgenic rice expressing a DEAD-box RNA helicase, OsDB10.	2023	Plant Mol Biol	Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC), Dhaka, 1215, Bangladesh.	Helicases are the motor proteins not only involved in the process of mRNA metabolism but also played a significant role in providing abiotic stresses tolerance. In this study, a DEAD-box RNA helicase OsDB10 was cloned and functionally characterized. The transcript levels of OsDB10 were increased both in shoot and root upon salt, heat, cold, and ABA application and was more prominent in shoot compared to root. Genomic integration of OsDB10 in transgenic rice was confirmed by PCR, Southern blot and qRT-PCR analysis. The transgenic plants showed quicker seed germination, reduced necrosis, higher chlorophyll, more survival rate, better seedling growth, and produced more grain yield under salinity stress. Furthermore, transgenic lines also accumulated less Na(+) and high K(+) ions and salinity tolerance of the transgenic were also assayed by measuring different bio-physiological indices. Moreover, the OsDB10 transgenic plants showed enhanced tolerance to salinity-induced oxidative stress by scavenging ROS and increased activity of antioxidants enzymes. Microarray analysis showed upregulation of transcriptional regulations and metabolic reprogramming as OsDB10 overexpression modulates the expression of many other genes. Altogether, our results confirmed that OsDB10 is a functional DEAD-box RNA helicase and played vital roles in plant defence response against salinity stress.
