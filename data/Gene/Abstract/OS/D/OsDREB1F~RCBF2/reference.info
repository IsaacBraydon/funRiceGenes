pone.0047275.pdf	Colinearity and similar expression pattern of rice DREB1s reveal their functional conservation in the cold-responsive pathway	2012	PLoS One	Key Laboratory of Agro-Ecological Processes in Subtropical Region, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changsha, China.	The clustered genes C-repeat (CRT) binding factor (CBF)1/dehydration-responsive element binding protein (DREB)1B, CBF2/DREB1C, and CBF3/DREB1A play a central role in cold acclimation and facilitate plant resistance to freezing in Arabidopsis thaliana. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is very sensitive to low temperatures; enhancing the cold stress tolerance of rice is a key challenge to increasing its yield. In this study, we demonstrate chilling acclimation, a phenomenon similar to Arabidopsis cold acclimation, in rice. To determine whether rice CBF/DREB1 genes participate in this cold-responsive pathway, all putative homologs of Arabidopsis DREB1 genes were filtered from the complete rice genome through a BLASTP search, followed by phylogenetic, colinearity and expression analysis. We thereby identified 10 rice genes as putative DREB1 homologs: nine of these were located in rice genomic regions with some colinearity to the Arabidopsis CBF1-CBF4 region. Expression profiling revealed that six of these genes (Os01g73770, Os02g45450, Os04g48350, Os06g03670, Os09g35010, and Os09g35030) were similarly expressed in response to chilling acclimation and cold stress and were co-expressed with genes involved in cold signalling, suggesting that these DREB1 homologs may be involved in the cold response in rice. The results presented here serve as a prelude towards understanding the function of rice homologs of DREB1 genes in cold-sensitive crops.

A transcription factor RCBF2 which interacts with C-repeat/DRE was isolated from Oryza sativa L. by a yeast one-hybrid method. Analysis of the deduced RCBF2 amino acid sequence revealed that RCBF2 contained a conserved ethylene-responsive element binding protein (EREBP)/AP2 domain of 59 amino acids and a potential nuclear localization sequence. RCBF2 showed a high level of homology with other CBF family members only in AP2 domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that RCBF2 might be different from other eight DRE-binding proteins on evolutionary relationship. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR (s-Q RT-PCR) analysis indicated the expression of RCBF2 gene was induced by cold, dehydration and high-salinity, but not by abscisic acid, and the transcription of RCBF2 gene accumulated primarily in rice immature seeds, growing point and shoots.

DREB transcription factors play key roles in plant stress signalling transduction pathway, they can specifically bind to DRE/CRT element (G/ACCGAC) and activate the expression of many stress inducible genes. Here, a novel rice DREB transcription factor, OsDREB1F, was cloned and characterised via subtractive suppression hybridisation (SSH) from upland rice. Expression analysis revealed that OsDREB1F gene was induced by salt, drought, cold stresses, and also ABA application, but not by pathogen, wound, and H2O2. Subcellular localization results indicated that OsDREB1F localizes in nucleus. Yeast activity assay demonstrated that OsDREB1F gene encodes a transcription activator, and can specifically bind to DRE/CRT but not to ABRE element. Transgenic plants harbouring OsDREB1F gene led to enhanced tolerance to salt, drought, and low temperature in both rice and Arabidopsis. The further characterisation of OsDREB1F-overexpressing Arabidopsis showed that, besides activating the expression of COR genes which contain DRE/CRT element in their upstream promoter regions, the expression of rd29B and RAB18 genes were also activated, suggested that OsDREB1F may also participate in ABA-dependent pathway.
