OsDEG10	cold stress	OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling	OsDEG10 RNAi transgenic plants were more sensitive to high light and cold stresses compared to wild-type plants
OsDEG10	abiotic stress	OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling	Among them, OsDEG10 is predicted to encode a small RNA-binding protein (RBP) and the transcript levels of OsDEG10 strongly increased under most of abiotic stress treatments such as high light, anoxia, NaCl, ABA, MV and cold
OsDEG10	abiotic stress	OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling	Our results suggest that OsDEG10 is a small RBP involved in the response to various abiotic stresses
OsDEG10	abiotic stress	OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling	OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling
