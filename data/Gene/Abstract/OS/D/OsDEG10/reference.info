Excessive light can be harmful to photosynthetic apparatus since it causes photoinhibition and photooxidation, and plants often encounter hypoxic or anoxic environments when they become submerged by heavy rain or an ensuing flood. In this study, Oryza sativa Differentially Expressed Genes (OsDEGs) from rice under photooxidation and anoxia conditions were isolated using DD-PCR. Among them, OsDEG10 is predicted to encode a small RNA-binding protein (RBP) and the transcript levels of OsDEG10 strongly increased under most of abiotic stress treatments such as high light, anoxia, NaCl, ABA, MV and cold. However, the transcript levels of two rice OsDEG10 homologs were not changed under those treatments. OsDEG10 RNAi transgenic plants were more sensitive to high light and cold stresses compared to wild-type plants. Our results suggest that OsDEG10 is a small RBP involved in the response to various abiotic stresses.
