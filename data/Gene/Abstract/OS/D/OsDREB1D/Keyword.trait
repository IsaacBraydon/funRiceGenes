OsDREB1D	salt	"Expression of a rice DREB1 gene, OsDREB1D, enhances cold and high-salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis"	" Results indicated that the over-expression of OsDREB1D conferred cold and high-salt tolerance in transgenic plants, and that transgenic plants were also insensitive to ABA (abscisic acid)
OsDREB1D	salt	"Expression of a rice DREB1 gene, OsDREB1D, enhances cold and high-salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis"	Expression of a rice DREB1 gene, OsDREB1D, enhances cold and high-salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis"
OsDREB1D	 ABA 	Expression of a rice DREB1 gene, OsDREB1D, enhances cold and high-salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis	 Results indicated that the over-expression of OsDREB1D conferred cold and high-salt tolerance in transgenic plants, and that transgenic plants were also insensitive to ABA (abscisic acid)
OsDREB1D	salt tolerance	"Expression of a rice DREB1 gene, OsDREB1D, enhances cold and high-salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis"	" Results indicated that the over-expression of OsDREB1D conferred cold and high-salt tolerance in transgenic plants, and that transgenic plants were also insensitive to ABA (abscisic acid)
OsDREB1D	salt tolerance	"Expression of a rice DREB1 gene, OsDREB1D, enhances cold and high-salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis"	Expression of a rice DREB1 gene, OsDREB1D, enhances cold and high-salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis"
OsDREB1D	drought	Drought inducible OsDhn1 promoter is activated by OsDREB1A and OsDREB1D	Drought inducible OsDhn1 promoter is activated by OsDREB1A and OsDREB1D
OsDREB1D	transcription factor	Expression of a rice DREB1 gene, OsDREB1D, enhances cold and high-salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis	 From these data, we deduced that this OsDREB1D gene functions similarly as other DREB transcription factors
