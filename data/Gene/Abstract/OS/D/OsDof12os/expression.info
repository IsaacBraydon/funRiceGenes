OsDof12os	 At different developmental stages in rice, the OsDof12 and OsDof12os transcripts exhibited reciprocal expression patterns |  In the ProOsDof12-GUS and ProOsDof12os-GUS transgenic rice plants, the expression profiles of GUS were consistent with those of the OsDof12 and OsDof12os transcripts, respectively |  CONCLUSION: Based on the expression profiles of OsDof12 and OsDof12os, the expression patterns of GUS in the ProOsDof12-GUS and ProOsDof12os-GUS transgenic rice plants and the predicted common cis-regulatory elements shared by the two promoters, we suggest that the co-expression patterns of OsDof12 and OsDof12os might be attributed to the basically common nature of the two promoters
