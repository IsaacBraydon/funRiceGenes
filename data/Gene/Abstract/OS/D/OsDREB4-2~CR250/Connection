OsDREB4-1|CR223	OsDREB4-2|CR250	OsDREB4 genes in rice encode AP2-containing proteins that bind specifically to the dehydration-responsive element	Lansheng), we cloned three DREB homologs: OsDREBI-1, OsDREB4-1, and OsDREB4-2
OsDREB4-1|CR223	OsDREB4-2|CR250	OsDREB4 genes in rice encode AP2-containing proteins that bind specifically to the dehydration-responsive element	The yeast one-hybrid assay indicated that both OsDREB4-1 and OsDREB4-2 proteins specifically bound to DRE and activated expression of the dual reporter genes of histidine (HIS3) and galactosidase (LacZ)
OsDREB4-1|CR223	OsDREB4-2|CR250	OsDREB4 genes in rice encode AP2-containing proteins that bind specifically to the dehydration-responsive element	In rice seedlings, expression of OsDREB4-1 was induced by dehydration and high salt, whereas OsDREBl-l and OsDREB4-2 were expressed constitutively
OsDREB4-1|CR223	OsDREB4-2|CR250	OsDREB4 genes in rice encode AP2-containing proteins that bind specifically to the dehydration-responsive element	Under normal growth conditions, OsDREBI-1 was expressed strongly in the leaf, sheath, and spike, was expressed relatively weak in the stem and only faintly expressed in the roots, whereas expression of transcripts of OsDREB4-1 and OsDREB4-2 was higher in the roots, stem, and spike, lower in the leaf, and undetectable in the sheath
