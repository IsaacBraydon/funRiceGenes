OsDREB4-2|CR250|OsAP2	Ectopic expression of a cell-wall degrading enzyme induced OsAP2/ERF152, leads to resistance against bacterial and fungal infection in Arabidopsis. |  The expression of rice transcription factor, APETALA2/Ethylene response factor-152 (OsAP2/ERF152) is enhanced in leaves upon treatment with different CWDEs and upon wounding |  Ectopic expression of OsAP2/ERF152 in Arabidopsis leads to induction of immune responses like callose deposition and upregulation of both salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid/ethylene (JA/ET) responsive defense genes |  Ectopic expression of OsAP2/ERF152 results in transient activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases 3/6 (MAPKs; MPK3/6) which could be leading to the induction of a broad range immunity in Arabidopsis
