In rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Lansheng), we cloned three DREB homologs: OsDREBI-1, OsDREB4-1, and OsDREB4-2. The deduced amino acid sequences revealed that each protein contained a potential nuclear localization signal, an AP2 DNA-binding domain, and a possible acidic activation domain. The yeast one-hybrid assay indicated that both OsDREB4-1 and OsDREB4-2 proteins specifically bound to DRE and activated expression of the dual reporter genes of histidine (HIS3) and galactosidase (LacZ). In rice seedlings, expression of OsDREB4-1 was induced by dehydration and high salt, whereas OsDREBl-l and OsDREB4-2 were expressed constitutively. Under normal growth conditions, OsDREBI-1 was expressed strongly in the leaf, sheath, and spike, was expressed relatively weak in the stem and only faintly expressed in the roots, whereas expression of transcripts of OsDREB4-1 and OsDREB4-2 was higher in the roots, stem, and spike, lower in the leaf, and undetectable in the sheath. Together, these results imply that expression of the OsDREB genes could be controlled by specific aspects of differentiation or development. Thus, OsDREB4-1 could function as a trans-acting factor in the DRE/DREB regulated stress-responsive pathway.
NA	Genome-Wide Transcript Profiling Reveals an Auxin-Responsive Transcription Factor, OsAP2/ERF-40, Promoting Rice Adventitious Root Development.	2019	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India.	Unlike dicots, the robust root system in grass species largely originate from stem base during post embryonic development. The mechanisms by which plant hormone signaling pathways control the architecture of adventitious root remains largely unknown. Here, we studied the modulations in global genes activity in developing rice adventitious root by genome-wide RNA sequencing in response to external auxin and cytokinin signaling cues. We further analysed spatio-temporal regulations of key developmental regulators emerged from our global transcriptome analysis. Interestingly, some of the key cell fate determinants such as homeodomain transcription factor, OsHOX12, no apical meristem protein, OsNAC39, APETALA2/ethylene response factor, OsAP2/ERF-40 and WUSCHEL-related homeobox, OsWOX6.1 and OsWOX6.2, specifically expressed in adventitious root primordia. Functional analysis of one of these regulators, an auxin-induced transcription factor containing AP2/ERF domain, OsAP2/ERF-40, demonstrates its sufficiency to confer the adventitious root fate. The ability to trigger the root developmental program is largely attributed to OsAP2/ERF-40 mediated dose dependent transcriptional activation of genes that can facilitate generating effective auxin response, and OsERF3-OsWOX11-OsRR2 pathway. Our studies reveal gene regulatory network operating in response to hormone signaling pathways and identify a novel transcription factor regulating adventitious root developmental program, a key agronomically important quantitative trait, upstream of OsERF3-OsWOX11-OsRR2 pathway.
