OsDREB4-2|CR250	sheath	OsDREB4 genes in rice encode AP2-containing proteins that bind specifically to the dehydration-responsive element	Under normal growth conditions, OsDREBI-1 was expressed strongly in the leaf, sheath, and spike, was expressed relatively weak in the stem and only faintly expressed in the roots, whereas expression of transcripts of OsDREB4-1 and OsDREB4-2 was higher in the roots, stem, and spike, lower in the leaf, and undetectable in the sheath
OsDREB4-2|CR250	seedling	OsDREB4 genes in rice encode AP2-containing proteins that bind specifically to the dehydration-responsive element	In rice seedlings, expression of OsDREB4-1 was induced by dehydration and high salt, whereas OsDREBl-l and OsDREB4-2 were expressed constitutively
OsDREB4-2|CR250	stem	OsDREB4 genes in rice encode AP2-containing proteins that bind specifically to the dehydration-responsive element	Under normal growth conditions, OsDREBI-1 was expressed strongly in the leaf, sheath, and spike, was expressed relatively weak in the stem and only faintly expressed in the roots, whereas expression of transcripts of OsDREB4-1 and OsDREB4-2 was higher in the roots, stem, and spike, lower in the leaf, and undetectable in the sheath
OsDREB4-2|CR250	growth	OsDREB4 genes in rice encode AP2-containing proteins that bind specifically to the dehydration-responsive element	Under normal growth conditions, OsDREBI-1 was expressed strongly in the leaf, sheath, and spike, was expressed relatively weak in the stem and only faintly expressed in the roots, whereas expression of transcripts of OsDREB4-1 and OsDREB4-2 was higher in the roots, stem, and spike, lower in the leaf, and undetectable in the sheath
OsDREB4-2|CR250	leaf	OsDREB4 genes in rice encode AP2-containing proteins that bind specifically to the dehydration-responsive element	Under normal growth conditions, OsDREBI-1 was expressed strongly in the leaf, sheath, and spike, was expressed relatively weak in the stem and only faintly expressed in the roots, whereas expression of transcripts of OsDREB4-1 and OsDREB4-2 was higher in the roots, stem, and spike, lower in the leaf, and undetectable in the sheath
OsDREB4-2|CR250	root	OsDREB4 genes in rice encode AP2-containing proteins that bind specifically to the dehydration-responsive element	Under normal growth conditions, OsDREBI-1 was expressed strongly in the leaf, sheath, and spike, was expressed relatively weak in the stem and only faintly expressed in the roots, whereas expression of transcripts of OsDREB4-1 and OsDREB4-2 was higher in the roots, stem, and spike, lower in the leaf, and undetectable in the sheath
OsDREB4-2|CR250	salt	OsDREB4 genes in rice encode AP2-containing proteins that bind specifically to the dehydration-responsive element	In rice seedlings, expression of OsDREB4-1 was induced by dehydration and high salt, whereas OsDREBl-l and OsDREB4-2 were expressed constitutively
