OsCDC48	OsDER1	OsDER1 is an ER-associated protein degradation factor that responds to ER stress.	 Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that OsDER1 interacted with OsHRD1, OsHRD3, and OsCDC48, the essential components of the canonical ERAD pathway
OsDER1	OsHrd1|MAL	OsDER1 is an ER-associated protein degradation factor that responds to ER stress.	 Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that OsDER1 interacted with OsHRD1, OsHRD3, and OsCDC48, the essential components of the canonical ERAD pathway
OsDER1	OsHrd3	OsDER1 is an ER-associated protein degradation factor that responds to ER stress.	 Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that OsDER1 interacted with OsHRD1, OsHRD3, and OsCDC48, the essential components of the canonical ERAD pathway
OsDER1	SPP	OsDER1 is an ER-associated protein degradation factor that responds to ER stress.	 Furthermore, OsDER1 associated with the signal peptide peptidase (SPP), a homologue of a component of the alternative ERAD pathway recently identified in yeast and mammals
