OsDHODH1	Nitrosative stress-mediated inhibition of OsDHODH1 gene expression suggests roots growth reduction in rice (Oryza sativa L.). |  Our findings reveal that short-term exposure of rice seedlings to 1 mM SNP (Nitric oxide donor) applied exogenously for 1 h resulted in significant down-regulation of OsDHODH1 expression in all rice cultivars
