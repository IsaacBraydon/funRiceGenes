In the present paper, we identified and cloned OsDHODH1 encoding a putative cytosolic dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) in rice. Expression analysis indicated that OsDHODH1 is upregulated by salt, drought and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), but not by cold. By prokaryotic expression, we determined the enzymatic activity of OsDHODH1 and found that overproduction of OsDHODH1 significantly improved the tolerance of Escherichia coli cells to salt and osmotic stresses. Overexpression of the OsDHODH1 gene in rice increased the DHODH activity and enhanced plant tolerance to salt and drought stresses as compared with wild type and OsDHODH1-antisense transgenic plants. Our findings reveal, for the first time, that cytosolic dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is involved in plant stress response and that OsDHODH1 could be used in engineering crop plants with enhanced tolerance to salt and drought.
NA	Nitrosative stress-mediated inhibition of OsDHODH1 gene expression suggests roots growth reduction in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2019	3 Biotech	1Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics School of Applied Biosciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.	This study monitored the transcriptional response of OsDHODH1 under nitrosative stress conditions relative to the transcripts accumulations for the core mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase1 (CcOX1) subunit, nuclear CcOX subunits 5b and 5c, two rice nitrate reductases (OsNIA1 and OsNIA2), and nitric oxide excess 1 (OsNOE1) genes. Our findings reveal that short-term exposure of rice seedlings to 1 mM SNP (Nitric oxide donor) applied exogenously for 1 h resulted in significant down-regulation of OsDHODH1 expression in all rice cultivars. In addition, the transcriptional patterns for the CcOX subunits, which are known to have a high affinity for nitric oxide, showed that the core catalytic subunit (OsCcOX1) and the nuclear subunit (OsCcOX5b) were up-regulated, while the nuclear subunit (OsCcOX5c) gene expression was suppressed. OsGSNOR1 expression was enhanced or decreased concomitant with a decrease or increase in SNO accumulation, particularly at the basal level. Moreover, high OsNIA1 expression was consistent with impaired root development, whereas low transcript accumulation matched a balanced root-growth pattern. This suggests that OsNIA1 expression would prevail over OsNIA2 expression under nitrosative stress response in rice. The level of malondialdehyde (MDA) content increased with the increase in SNP concentration, translating enhanced oxidative damage to the cell. We also observed increased catalase activity in response to 5 mM SNP suggesting that potential cross-talk exist between nitrosative and oxidative stress. These results collectively suggest a possible role of OsDHODH1 and OsCcOX5b role in plant root growth during nitrosative stress responses.
