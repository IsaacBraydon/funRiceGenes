As an important agronomic trait, the chlorophyll (Chl) content is closely related to photosynthesis in plants. A rice mutant Gc (Oryza sativa indica) was characterized previously by its enhanced Chl content (Chl b and total Chl) and exaggerated photosynthetic rate. Here, we describe the enhanced Chl content was caused by a mutation in the rice homolog of the DE-ETIOLATED1 (DET1) known to be involved in light transduction and morphogenesis in Arabidopsis and tomato. Sequence analysis revealed that the Gc mutant carried two fragment-insertions and a fragment-deletion upstream of the start codon of OsDET1, which led to enhance mRNA levels of OsDET1. Besides, the Gc mutant harbored a single T-to-C base transversion in the seventh exon of OsDET1, which resulted in leucine(328) to serine(328) localized in the highly conserved region. Genetic complementation demonstrated that OsDET1 mutation conferred the enhanced Chl content in the Gc mutant leaf. OsDET1 was richly expressed in green tissues, and its expression seems to be under circadian control. OsDET1-GFP fusion protein in onion epidermal cells showed that OsDET1 localized to the nucleus. These results indicated that OsDET1 mutation in Gc mutant increases Chl content in rice, which might be fundamental for enhanced photoresponsiveness.
NA	OsDET1 Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice	2016	Plant Physiol	Chongqing University CITY: Chongqing China	DE-ETIOLATED1 (DET1) plays a critical role in developmental and environmental responses in many plants. To date, the functions of OsDET1 in rice have been largely unknown. OsDET1 is an ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana DET1. Here, we found that OsDET1 is essential for maintaining normal rice development. The repression of OsDET1 had detrimental effects on plant development, and we found that OsDET1 is involved in modulating ABA signaling in rice. OsDET1 RNAi plants exhibited an ABA hypersensitivity phenotype. Using yeast two-hybrid and BiFC assays, we determined that OsDET1 physically interacts with OsDDB1 and OsCOP10; OsDDA1 binds to the ABA receptors OsPYL5 and OsDDB1. We found that the degradation of OsPYL5 was delayed in OsDET1 RNAi plants. These findings suggest that OsDET1 deficiency disturbs the CDD complex, which is responsible for ABA receptor (OsPYL) degradation, eventually leading to ABA sensitivity in rice. Additionally, OsDET1 also modulated ABA biosynthesis, as ABA biosynthesis was inhibited in OsDET1 RNAi plants and promoted in OE-OsDET1 plants. In conclusion, our data suggest that OsDET1 plays an important role in maintaining normal development in rice, and mediates the crosstalk between ABA biosynthesis and ABA signaling pathways in rice.
