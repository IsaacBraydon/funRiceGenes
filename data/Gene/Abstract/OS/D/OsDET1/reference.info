As an important agronomic trait, the chlorophyll (Chl) content is closely related to photosynthesis in plants. A rice mutant Gc (Oryza sativa indica) was characterized previously by its enhanced Chl content (Chl b and total Chl) and exaggerated photosynthetic rate. Here, we describe the enhanced Chl content was caused by a mutation in the rice homolog of the DE-ETIOLATED1 (DET1) known to be involved in light transduction and morphogenesis in Arabidopsis and tomato. Sequence analysis revealed that the Gc mutant carried two fragment-insertions and a fragment-deletion upstream of the start codon of OsDET1, which led to enhance mRNA levels of OsDET1. Besides, the Gc mutant harbored a single T-to-C base transversion in the seventh exon of OsDET1, which resulted in leucine(328) to serine(328) localized in the highly conserved region. Genetic complementation demonstrated that OsDET1 mutation conferred the enhanced Chl content in the Gc mutant leaf. OsDET1 was richly expressed in green tissues, and its expression seems to be under circadian control. OsDET1-GFP fusion protein in onion epidermal cells showed that OsDET1 localized to the nucleus. These results indicated that OsDET1 mutation in Gc mutant increases Chl content in rice, which might be fundamental for enhanced photoresponsiveness.
