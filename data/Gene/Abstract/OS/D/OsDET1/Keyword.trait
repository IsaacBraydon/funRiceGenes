OsDET1	leaf	Mutation of OsDET1 increases chlorophyll content in rice	Genetic complementation demonstrated that OsDET1 mutation conferred the enhanced Chl content in the Gc mutant leaf
OsDET1	development	OsDET1 Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice	Here, we found that OsDET1 is essential for maintaining normal rice development
OsDET1	development	OsDET1 Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice	In conclusion, our data suggest that OsDET1 plays an important role in maintaining normal development in rice, and mediates the crosstalk between ABA biosynthesis and ABA signaling pathways in rice
OsDET1	 ABA 	OsDET1 Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice	OsDET1 Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice
OsDET1	 ABA 	OsDET1 Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice	The repression of OsDET1 had detrimental effects on plant development, and we found that OsDET1 is involved in modulating ABA signaling in rice
OsDET1	 ABA 	OsDET1 Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice	OsDET1 RNAi plants exhibited an ABA hypersensitivity phenotype
OsDET1	 ABA 	OsDET1 Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice	Using yeast two-hybrid and BiFC assays, we determined that OsDET1 physically interacts with OsDDB1 and OsCOP10; OsDDA1 binds to the ABA receptors OsPYL5 and OsDDB1
OsDET1	 ABA 	OsDET1 Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice	These findings suggest that OsDET1 deficiency disturbs the CDD complex, which is responsible for ABA receptor (OsPYL) degradation, eventually leading to ABA sensitivity in rice
OsDET1	 ABA 	OsDET1 Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice	Additionally, OsDET1 also modulated ABA biosynthesis, as ABA biosynthesis was inhibited in OsDET1 RNAi plants and promoted in OE-OsDET1 plants
