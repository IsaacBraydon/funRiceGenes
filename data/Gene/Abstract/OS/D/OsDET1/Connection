OsDET1	OsPYL|RCAR5|OsPYL5	OsDET1 Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice	These findings suggest that OsDET1 deficiency disturbs the CDD complex, which is responsible for ABA receptor (OsPYL) degradation, eventually leading to ABA sensitivity in rice
OsDDB1	OsDET1	The De-Etiolated 1 Homolog of Arabidopsis Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice.	Using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we determined that OsDET1 interacts physically with DAMAGED-SPECIFIC DNA-BINDING PROTEIN1 (OsDDB1) and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC10 (COP10); DET1- and DDB1-ASSOCIATED1 binds to the ABA receptors OsPYL5 and OsDDB1
