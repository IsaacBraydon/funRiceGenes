OsDET1	OsPYL|RCAR5|OsPYL5	OsDET1 Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice	These findings suggest that OsDET1 deficiency disturbs the CDD complex, which is responsible for ABA receptor (OsPYL) degradation, eventually leading to ABA sensitivity in rice
OsDDB1	OsDET1	The De-Etiolated 1 Homolog of Arabidopsis Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice.	Using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we determined that OsDET1 interacts physically with DAMAGED-SPECIFIC DNA-BINDING PROTEIN1 (OsDDB1) and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC10 (COP10); DET1- and DDB1-ASSOCIATED1 binds to the ABA receptors OsPYL5 and OsDDB1
OsCOP10	OsDET1	Mutations in OsDET1, OsCOP10, and OsDDB1 confer embryonic lethality and alter flavonoid accumulation in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) seed.	Mutations in OsDET1, OsCOP10, and OsDDB1 confer embryonic lethality and alter flavonoid accumulation in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) seed.
OsCOP10	OsDET1	Mutations in OsDET1, OsCOP10, and OsDDB1 confer embryonic lethality and alter flavonoid accumulation in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) seed.	 Consistent with the fact that OsDET1 interacts with CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 10 (OsCOP10) and UV-DAMAGED DNA BINDING PROTEIN 1 (OsDDB1) to form the COP10-DET1-DDB1 (CDD), seeds of oscop10 and osddb1 knockout mutants also showed the yel phenotype
