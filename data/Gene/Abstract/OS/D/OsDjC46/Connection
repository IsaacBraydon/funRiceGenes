BSR-D1|ZFP36	OsDjC46	A J-Protein OsDjC46 Interacts with ZFP36 to Participate in ABA-Mediated Antioxidant Defense in Rice.	 Using ZFP36 as bait, a yeast two-hybrid system was used to obtain the interacting protein OsDjC46, which belongs to heat shock protein and usually exists in the form of molecular chaperone, was identified
BSR-D1|ZFP36	OsDjC46	A J-Protein OsDjC46 Interacts with ZFP36 to Participate in ABA-Mediated Antioxidant Defense in Rice.	 Further Co-IP (co-immunoprecipitation), BiFC (bimolecular fluorescence complement) and GST (glutathione-S-transferase) pull-down experiments verified that ZFP36 interacted with OsDjC46 in vivo and in vitro
