OsDjC46	 Here, various stimuli, such as abscisic acid (ABA), hydrogen peroxidase (H(2)O(2)), polyethylene (PEG) and sodium chloride (NaCl) markedly induced the expression of OsDjC46 in the seedlings |  Overexpression of OsDjC46 in rice can enhance the tolerance to salinity and drought; in contrast, knockout of OsDjC46 rice plants was more sensitive to salt stress and drought |  Further investigation revealed that OsDjC46 could participate in regulating the expression and activities of antioxidant of SOD and CAT under drought and salt stress	 Overexpression of OsDjC46 in rice can enhance the tolerance to salinity and drought; in contrast, knockout of OsDjC46 rice plants was more sensitive to salt stress and drought
