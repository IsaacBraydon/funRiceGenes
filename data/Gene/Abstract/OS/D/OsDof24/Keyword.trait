OsDof24	leaf	Rice DNA-BINDING ONE ZINC FINGER 24 (OsDOF24) Delays Leaf Senescence in a Jasmonate-Mediated Pathway.	 Here, we show a novel function for OsDOF24 as a repressor of leaf senescence in rice (Oryza sativa)
OsDof24	leaf	Rice DNA-BINDING ONE ZINC FINGER 24 (OsDOF24) Delays Leaf Senescence in a Jasmonate-Mediated Pathway.	 The gain-of-function mutant osdof24-D, which contains an enhancer-trap T-DNA in the OsDOF24 promoter, exhibited delayed leaf yellowing during NS and DIS
OsDof24	leaf	Rice DNA-BINDING ONE ZINC FINGER 24 (OsDOF24) Delays Leaf Senescence in a Jasmonate-Mediated Pathway.	 Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsDOF24 suppresses the induction of leaf senescence during vegetative growth by deactivating jasmonate biosynthetic pathways

OsDof24	senescence	Rice DNA-BINDING ONE ZINC FINGER 24 (OsDOF24) Delays Leaf Senescence in a Jasmonate-Mediated Pathway.	 In wild-type leaves, OsDOF24 expression rapidly decreased during natural senescence (NS) and dark-induced senescence (DIS)
OsDof24	senescence	Rice DNA-BINDING ONE ZINC FINGER 24 (OsDOF24) Delays Leaf Senescence in a Jasmonate-Mediated Pathway.	 Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsDOF24 suppresses the induction of leaf senescence during vegetative growth by deactivating jasmonate biosynthetic pathways
OsDof24	growth	Rice DNA-BINDING ONE ZINC FINGER 24 (OsDOF24) Delays Leaf Senescence in a Jasmonate-Mediated Pathway.	 Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsDOF24 suppresses the induction of leaf senescence during vegetative growth by deactivating jasmonate biosynthetic pathways
OsDof24	jasmonate	Rice DNA-BINDING ONE ZINC FINGER 24 (OsDOF24) Delays Leaf Senescence in a Jasmonate-Mediated Pathway.	 Among the phytohormones, only methyl jasmonate induced OsDOF24 expression
OsDof24	jasmonate	Rice DNA-BINDING ONE ZINC FINGER 24 (OsDOF24) Delays Leaf Senescence in a Jasmonate-Mediated Pathway.	 Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsDOF24 suppresses the induction of leaf senescence during vegetative growth by deactivating jasmonate biosynthetic pathways
OsDof24	vegetative	Rice DNA-BINDING ONE ZINC FINGER 24 (OsDOF24) Delays Leaf Senescence in a Jasmonate-Mediated Pathway.	 Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsDOF24 suppresses the induction of leaf senescence during vegetative growth by deactivating jasmonate biosynthetic pathways
