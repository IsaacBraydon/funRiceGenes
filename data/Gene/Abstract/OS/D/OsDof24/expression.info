OsDof24	 In wild-type leaves, OsDOF24 expression rapidly decreased during natural senescence (NS) and dark-induced senescence (DIS) |  Among the phytohormones, only methyl jasmonate induced OsDOF24 expression |  Furthermore, the reduced expression of jasmonate biosynthesis-related genes (OsLOX2, OsLOX8, OsHI-LOX, OsAOS1, and OsAOS2) in osdof24-D decreased endogenous jasmonate levels, resulting in delayed leaf senescence under DIS conditions
