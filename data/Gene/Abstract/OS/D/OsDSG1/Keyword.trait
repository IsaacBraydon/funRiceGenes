OsDSG1	 ABA 	A RING finger E3 ligase gene, Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), controls seed germination and stress responses in rice	In the osdsg1 mutant, transcript levels of ABA signaling genes and ABA responsive genes were significantly increased
OsDSG1	 ABA 	A RING finger E3 ligase gene, Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), controls seed germination and stress responses in rice	These observations support that OsDSG1 is a major regulator of ABA signaling in germinating seeds
OsDSG1	root	A RING finger E3 ligase gene, Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), controls seed germination and stress responses in rice	Real-time PCR analysis revealed that OsDSG1 was expressed in leaves and roots, and strongly in developing seeds
OsDSG1	seed	A RING finger E3 ligase gene, Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), controls seed germination and stress responses in rice	There, T-DNA was inserted into Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), causing a recessive null mutation
