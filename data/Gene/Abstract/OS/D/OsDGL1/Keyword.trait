OsDGL1	meristem	OsDGL1, a homolog of an oligosaccharyltransferase complex subunit, is involved in N-glycosylation and root development in rice	The leaky rice mutant, Osdgl1, displayed a change of matrix polysaccharides in its root cell wall, shorter root cell length, smaller root meristem and cell death in the root
