OsDof19	 Expression profiling of OsDofs from two japonica cultivars (Longdao5, which is cold-tolerant, and Longjing11, which is cold-sensitive) revealed that OsDof1 and OsDof19 are cold-inducible genes |  We and OsDof19-overexpression and RNAi lines and found that OsDof1 showed a response to cold stress	 We and OsDof19-overexpression and RNAi lines and found that OsDof1 showed a response to cold stress	 We and OsDof19-overexpression and RNAi lines and found that OsDof1 showed a response to cold stress
