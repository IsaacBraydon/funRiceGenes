NA	Rice Transcription Factor OsDOF11 Modulates Sugar Transport by Promoting Expression of Sucrose Transporter and SWEET genes.	2018	Mol Plant	Crop Biotech Institute and Graduate School of Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 17104, Korea.	Sucrose is produced in mesophyll cells and transferred into phloem cells before it is delivered long-distance to sink tissues. However, little is known about how sucrose transport is regulated in plants. Here, we identified T-DNA insertional mutants in Oryza sativa DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER 11 (OsDOF11), which is expressed in the vascular cells of photosynthetic organs and in various sink tissues. The osdof11 mutant plants are semi-dwarf and have fewer tillers and smaller panicles. Although sucrose enhanced root elongation in young wild-type (WT) seedlings, this did not occur in osdof11 seedlings due to reduced sucrose uptake. Sugar transport rate analyses revealed that less sugar was transported in osdof11 plants than in the WT. Expression of four Sucrose Transporter (SUT) genes -- OsSUT1, OsSUT3, OsSUT4, and OsSUT5 -- as well as two Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters (SWEET) genes, OsSWEET11 and OsSWEET14, was altered in various organs of the mutant, including the leaves. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that OsDOF11 directly binds to the promoter regions of SUT1, OsSWEET11, and OsSWEET14, indicating that OsDOF11 coordinately controls transporters that are responsible for sucrose transport via apoplastic loading. We also observed that osdof11 mutant plants were less susceptible to infection by Xanthomonas oryzae pathovar oryzae, suggesting that OsDOF11 participates in sugar distribution during pathogenic invasions. Collectively, these results suggest that OsDOF11 modulates sugar transport by regulating expression of SUT and SWEET genes in rice.
