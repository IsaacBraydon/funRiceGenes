NA	Rice Transcription Factor OsDOF11 Modulates Sugar Transport by Promoting Expression of Sucrose Transporter and SWEET genes.	2018	Mol Plant	Crop Biotech Institute and Graduate School of Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 17104, Korea.	Sucrose is produced in mesophyll cells and transferred into phloem cells before it is delivered long-distance to sink tissues. However, little is known about how sucrose transport is regulated in plants. Here, we identified T-DNA insertional mutants in Oryza sativa DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER 11 (OsDOF11), which is expressed in the vascular cells of photosynthetic organs and in various sink tissues. The osdof11 mutant plants are semi-dwarf and have fewer tillers and smaller panicles. Although sucrose enhanced root elongation in young wild-type (WT) seedlings, this did not occur in osdof11 seedlings due to reduced sucrose uptake. Sugar transport rate analyses revealed that less sugar was transported in osdof11 plants than in the WT. Expression of four Sucrose Transporter (SUT) genes -- OsSUT1, OsSUT3, OsSUT4, and OsSUT5 -- as well as two Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters (SWEET) genes, OsSWEET11 and OsSWEET14, was altered in various organs of the mutant, including the leaves. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that OsDOF11 directly binds to the promoter regions of SUT1, OsSWEET11, and OsSWEET14, indicating that OsDOF11 coordinately controls transporters that are responsible for sucrose transport via apoplastic loading. We also observed that osdof11 mutant plants were less susceptible to infection by Xanthomonas oryzae pathovar oryzae, suggesting that OsDOF11 participates in sugar distribution during pathogenic invasions. Collectively, these results suggest that OsDOF11 modulates sugar transport by regulating expression of SUT and SWEET genes in rice.
NA	OsRRM, an RNA-Binding Protein, Modulates Sugar Transport in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	2020	Front Plant Sci	Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Key Laboratory of Crop Genomics and Molecular Breeding of Jiangsu Province, Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology of Jiangsu Province, College of Agriculture, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.	Sugar allocation between vegetative and reproductive tissues is vital to plant development, and sugar transporters play fundamental roles in this process. Although several transcription factors have been identified that control their transcription levels, the way in which the expression of sugar transporter genes is controlled at the posttranscriptional level is unknown. In this study, we showed that OsRRM, an RNA-binding protein, modulates sugar allocation in tissues on the source-to-sink route. The OsRRM expression pattern partly resembles that of several sugar transporter and transcription factor genes that specifically affect sugar transporter gene expression. The messenger RNA levels of almost all of the sugar transporter genes are severely reduced in the osrrm mutant, and this alters sugar metabolism and sugar signaling, which further affects plant height, flowering time, seed size, and starch synthesis. We further showed that OsRRM binds directly to messenger RNAs encoded by sugar transporter genes and thus may stabilize their transcripts. Therefore, we have uncovered the physiological function of OsRRM, which sheds new light on sugar metabolism and sugar signaling.
