NA	Rice Transcription Factor OsDOF11 Modulates Sugar Transport by Promoting Expression of Sucrose Transporter and SWEET genes.	2018	Mol Plant	Crop Biotech Institute and Graduate School of Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 17104, Korea.	Sucrose is produced in mesophyll cells and transferred into phloem cells before it is delivered long-distance to sink tissues. However, little is known about how sucrose transport is regulated in plants. Here, we identified T-DNA insertional mutants in Oryza sativa DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER 11 (OsDOF11), which is expressed in the vascular cells of photosynthetic organs and in various sink tissues. The osdof11 mutant plants are semi-dwarf and have fewer tillers and smaller panicles. Although sucrose enhanced root elongation in young wild-type (WT) seedlings, this did not occur in osdof11 seedlings due to reduced sucrose uptake. Sugar transport rate analyses revealed that less sugar was transported in osdof11 plants than in the WT. Expression of four Sucrose Transporter (SUT) genes -- OsSUT1, OsSUT3, OsSUT4, and OsSUT5 -- as well as two Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters (SWEET) genes, OsSWEET11 and OsSWEET14, was altered in various organs of the mutant, including the leaves. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that OsDOF11 directly binds to the promoter regions of SUT1, OsSWEET11, and OsSWEET14, indicating that OsDOF11 coordinately controls transporters that are responsible for sucrose transport via apoplastic loading. We also observed that osdof11 mutant plants were less susceptible to infection by Xanthomonas oryzae pathovar oryzae, suggesting that OsDOF11 participates in sugar distribution during pathogenic invasions. Collectively, these results suggest that OsDOF11 modulates sugar transport by regulating expression of SUT and SWEET genes in rice.
NA	OsRRM, an RNA-Binding Protein, Modulates Sugar Transport in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	2020	Front Plant Sci	Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Key Laboratory of Crop Genomics and Molecular Breeding of Jiangsu Province, Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology of Jiangsu Province, College of Agriculture, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.	Sugar allocation between vegetative and reproductive tissues is vital to plant development, and sugar transporters play fundamental roles in this process. Although several transcription factors have been identified that control their transcription levels, the way in which the expression of sugar transporter genes is controlled at the posttranscriptional level is unknown. In this study, we showed that OsRRM, an RNA-binding protein, modulates sugar allocation in tissues on the source-to-sink route. The OsRRM expression pattern partly resembles that of several sugar transporter and transcription factor genes that specifically affect sugar transporter gene expression. The messenger RNA levels of almost all of the sugar transporter genes are severely reduced in the osrrm mutant, and this alters sugar metabolism and sugar signaling, which further affects plant height, flowering time, seed size, and starch synthesis. We further showed that OsRRM binds directly to messenger RNAs encoded by sugar transporter genes and thus may stabilize their transcripts. Therefore, we have uncovered the physiological function of OsRRM, which sheds new light on sugar metabolism and sugar signaling.
NA	OsDOF11 Affects Nitrogen Metabolism by Sucrose Transport Signaling in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2021	Front Plant Sci	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology/Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops/Joint International Research Laboratory of Agriculture and Agri-Product Safety, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.	Carbon and nitrogen antagonistically regulate multiple developmental processes. However, the molecular mechanism affecting nitrogen metabolism by sucrose transport remains poorly defined. Previously, we noted that Oryza sativa DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER 11 (OsDOF11) mediated sucrose transport by binding to the promoter regions of Sucrose Transporter 1 (SUT1), Oryza sativa Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters 11 (OsSWEET11), and OsSWEET14. Here, we note that OsDOF11 promotes nitrogen uptake and then maintains the ratio of fresh weight to dry weight in seedling plants and the effective leaf blade at flowering stages. Mutants of the sucrose transporter gene OsSWEET14 displayed a phenotype similar to that of OsDOF11. By microarray analysis and qRT-PCR in OsDOF11 mutant plants, OsDOF11 affected the transcription level of amino acid metabolism-related genes. We further found that mainly amino acid contents were reduced in flag leaves but increased in seeds. Both sugar and organic nitrogen changes caused the ratio of fresh weight to dry weight to decrease in OsDOF11 mutant seedling plants and mature leaves, which might result in vigorous reduced metabolic activity and become less susceptible to stress. These results demonstrated that OsDOF11 affected nitrogen metabolism by sugar distribution in rice, which provided new insight that OsDOF11 coordinated with C and N balance to maintain plant growth activity.
NA	The sucrose transport regulator OsDOF11 mediates cytokinin degradation during rice development.	2022	Plant Physiol	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology, Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Joint International Research Laboratory of Agriculture &amp;Agri-Product Safety, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, China.	Photosynthetic tissues are dynamic structures whose homeostasis depends on the coordination of two antagonistic processes: self-maintenance and supporting sink tissues. The balance of these processes determines plant development, which might be mediated by cytokinin. However, little is known about the link between sucrose transport signaling and cytokinin. Rice (Oryza sativa) DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER11 (OsDOF11) is a transcription factor that mediates sucrose transport by inducing the expression of sucrose transporter genes. Here, we found that OsDOF11 loss-of-function mutants showed a semi-dwarf phenotype with a smaller cell length due to increased cytokinin content in source tissues. RNA sequencing and reverse transcription quantitative PCR analyses revealed that genes involved in cytokinin signaling and metabolism were affected in osdof11 mutants. Yeast one-hybrid, dual-luciferase reporter, and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that OsDOF11 directly binds to the promoter regions of O. sativa CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE4 (OsCKX4). Moreover, mutation of osckx4 in the osdof11 osckx4 double mutant rescued the semi-dwarf phenotype of the osdof11 mutant. Interestingly, exogenous application of kinetin promoted OsDOF11 expression earlier than OsCKX4, and overexpression of O. sativa VIN3-LIKE 2 caused an increase in active cytokinin levels and induced OsDOF11 transcript levels. Taken together, our results suggest a model in which both a sucrose transport regulator (OsDOF11) and cytokinin via OsCKX4 establish a feedback loop to maintain dynamic tissue homeostasis.
NA	OsDOF11 Promotes Crown Root Formation via Cytokinin in Oryza Sativa.	2022	Front Biosci (Landmark Ed)	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology/Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops/Joint International Research Laboratory of Agriculture &amp; Agri-Product Safety, Yangzhou University, 225009 Yangzhou, Jiangsu, China.	BACKGROUND: Crown root is the main part of root system, which performs an important role in rice growth and development, especially in nutrition and water assimilation. Previously, we reported negative feedback regulation loop between Oryza sativa DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER 11 (OsDOF11) and cytokinin by Oryza sativa CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE 4 (OsCKX4) in rice development. METHODS: Reverse transcription quantitative RT-PCR analyses was used to analyze the related gene transcript level. Nitrogen and hormone were measured by CHN-Nitrogen analyser and Liquid chromatography mass spectrometer, respectively. Exogenous application of cytokinin and [13C] sucrose labeled stable isotope uptake experiments help us to explain the relationship between OsDOF11 and cytokinin. RESULTS: We demonstrate the role of OsDOF11 in root development. We note that the loss function of OsDOF11 displays the reduced crown roots number, low activity of nitrogen assimilation and low content of cytokinin and auxin. The expression level of WUSCHEL-related homeobox (OsWOX11), A-type response regulator 2 (OsRR2), OsRR3, and OsCKX4 were decreased in osdof11-1, as well as in OsDOF11 RNA interference 9 mutants (RNAi-9 lines). Through Exogenous application of multiple concentrations of cytokinin as treatment to osdof11-1 mutant, RNAi-9 lines, and wild type (WT). We found that the crown roots number of osdof11-1 plants were rescued as the cytokinin concentration increased gradually from 1 μM to 10 μM, but the effect was weaker in RNAi-9 line. And cytokinin inhibited sucrose uptake activity from Murashige-Skoog medium with 3.0% sucrose (MS30) by OsDOF11 in rice root. CONCLUSIONS: OsDOF11 promotes crown root formation via cytokinin in oryza sativa. These results provide a physiological basis for further analysis of the OsDOF11 function of in rice root development.
