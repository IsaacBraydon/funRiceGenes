Os11N3|OsSWEET14	OsDOF11	Rice Transcription Factor OsDOF11 Modulates Sugar Transport by Promoting Expression of Sucrose Transporter and SWEET genes.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that OsDOF11 directly binds to the promoter regions of SUT1, OsSWEET11, and OsSWEET14, indicating that OsDOF11 coordinately controls transporters that are responsible for sucrose transport via apoplastic loading

Os11N3|OsSWEET14	OsDOF11	OsDOF11 Affects Nitrogen Metabolism by Sucrose Transport Signaling in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Previously, we noted that Oryza sativa DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER 11 (OsDOF11) mediated sucrose transport by binding to the promoter regions of Sucrose Transporter 1 (SUT1), Oryza sativa Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters 11 (OsSWEET11), and OsSWEET14
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	OsDOF11	OsDOF11 Affects Nitrogen Metabolism by Sucrose Transport Signaling in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Mutants of the sucrose transporter gene OsSWEET14 displayed a phenotype similar to that of OsDOF11
