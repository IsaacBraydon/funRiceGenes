Os11N3|OsSWEET14	OsDOF11	Rice Transcription Factor OsDOF11 Modulates Sugar Transport by Promoting Expression of Sucrose Transporter and SWEET genes.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that OsDOF11 directly binds to the promoter regions of SUT1, OsSWEET11, and OsSWEET14, indicating that OsDOF11 coordinately controls transporters that are responsible for sucrose transport via apoplastic loading

Os11N3|OsSWEET14	OsDOF11	OsDOF11 Affects Nitrogen Metabolism by Sucrose Transport Signaling in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Previously, we noted that Oryza sativa DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER 11 (OsDOF11) mediated sucrose transport by binding to the promoter regions of Sucrose Transporter 1 (SUT1), Oryza sativa Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters 11 (OsSWEET11), and OsSWEET14

OsCKX4	OsDOF11	The sucrose transport regulator OsDOF11 mediates cytokinin degradation during rice development.	 Moreover, mutation of osckx4 in the osdof11 osckx4 double mutant rescued the semi-dwarf phenotype of the osdof11 mutant
OsCKX4	OsDOF11	The sucrose transport regulator OsDOF11 mediates cytokinin degradation during rice development.	 Interestingly, exogenous application of kinetin promoted OsDOF11 expression earlier than OsCKX4, and overexpression of O
OsCKX4	OsDOF11	The sucrose transport regulator OsDOF11 mediates cytokinin degradation during rice development.	 Taken together, our results suggest a model in which both a sucrose transport regulator (OsDOF11) and cytokinin via OsCKX4 establish a feedback loop to maintain dynamic tissue homeostasis
