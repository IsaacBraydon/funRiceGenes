There are two major categories of DNA methyltransferases: de novo and maintenance. Here, we report the isolation and functional characterization of a de novo methyltransferase, named OsDRM2, from rice (Oryza sativa L.). The full-length coding region of OsDRM2 was cloned and transformed into Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both of these organisms expressed the OsDRM2 protein, which exhibited stochastic de novo methylation activity in vitro at CG, CHG, and CHH di- and tri-nucleotide patterns. Two lines of evidence demonstrated the de novo activity of OsDRM2: (1) a 5'-CCGG-3' containing DNA fragment that had been pre-treated with OsDRM2 protein expressed in E. coli was protected from digestion by the CG-methylation-sensitive isoschizomer HpaII; (2) methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) analysis of S. cerevisiae genomic DNA from transformants that had been introduced with OsDRM2 revealed CG and CHG methylation levels of 3.92-9.12%, and 2.88-6.93%, respectively, whereas the mock control S. cerevisiae DNA did not exhibit cytosine methylation. These results were further supported by bisulfite sequencing of the 18S rRNA and EAF5 genes of the transformed S. cerevisiae, which exhibited different DNA methylation patterns, which were observed in the genomic DNA. Our findings establish that OsDRM2 is an active de novo DNA methyltransferase gene with conserved activity in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic non-host species.

Domains rearranged methyltransferases (DRMs) are the de novo methyltransferases that regulate cytosine methylation in plants in a manner similar to the animal de novo methyltransferases, DNMT3a and DNMT3b. These enzymes catalyze the establishment of new methylation patterns and are guided to target sites by small RNAs through the process of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). In the current accepted view for RdDM, intricate interactions among transcription factors/chromatin modifying proteins and the large subunits of plant-specific polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V, regulate the 24-nt small interfering RNA guided de novo methylation of cytosines. The RNA-induced silencing complex assembled on Pol-V-transcribed non-coding RNA finally facilitates the recruitment of DRM2 by unknown mechanism/protein interactions to chromatin sites. In an attempt to determine the cellular proteins that specifically interact with DRM2, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using young rice panicles. We report that rice DRM2 interacts with the ATP-dependent RNA helicase, eIF4A. Direct interaction between the two proteins is demonstrated in vivo by bimolecular fluorescence complementation method and in vitro by histidine-pull-down assays. Deletion analysis reveals that interaction between OsDRM2 and OseIF4A is specifically mediated through ubiquitin-associated domain of OsDRM2 while, both domains 1 and 2 of OseIF4A are critical for mediating strong interaction with OsDRM2 in vivo. Interaction between Arabidopsis eIF4AI and eIF4AII with OsDRM2 and nuclear localization of these complexes suggests possible conservation of functional interaction between de novo methyltransferases and the translation initiation factor, eIF4A, in RdDM across plant species.

However, information about DNA methylation in other plants is limited, partly because of the lack of mutants. To study DNA methylation in rice (Oryza sativa) we applied homologous recombination-mediated gene targeting to generate targeted disruptants of OsDRM2, a rice orthologue of DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLASE 1 and 2 (DRM1/2), which encode DNA methyltransferases responsible for de novo and non-CG methylation in Arabidopsis. Whereas Arabidopsis drm1 drm2 double mutants showed no morphological alterations, targeted disruptants of rice OsDRM2 displayed pleiotropic developmental phenotypes in both vegetative and reproductive stages, including growth defects, semi-dwarfed stature, reductions in tiller number, delayed heading or no heading, abnormal panicle and spikelet morphology, and complete sterility. In these osdrm2 disruptants, a 13.9% decrease in 5-methylcytosine was observed by HPLC analysis. The CG and non-CG methylation levels were reduced in RIRE7/CRR1 retrotransposons, and in 5S rDNA repeats. Associated transcriptional activation was detected in RIRE7/CRR1. Furthermore, de novo methylation by an RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) process involving transgene-derived exogenous small interfering RNA (siRNA) was deficient in osdrm2-disrupted cells. Impaired growth and abnormal DNA methylation of osdrm2 disruptants were restored by the complementation of wild-type OsDRM2 cDNA. Our results suggest that OsDRM2 is responsible for de novo, CG and non-CG methylation in rice genomic sequences, and that DNA methylation regulated by OsDRM2 is essential for proper rice development in both vegetative and reproductive stages.
NA	The ortholog of DDM1 is mainly required for CHG and CG methylation of heterochromatin and is involved in DRM2-mediated CHH methylation that targets mostly genic regions of the rice genome.	2016	Plant Physiol	Huazhong Agricultural University CITY: Wuahn China [CN].	Plant DNA methylation that occurs at CG, CHG and CHH sites (H=A, C, or T) is a hallmark of repression of repetitive sequences and transposable elements (TE). The rice genome contains about 40% of repetitive sequence and TE, and displays specific patterns of genome-wide DNA methylation. The mechanism responsible for the specific methylation patterns is unclear. Here, we analyzed the function of OsDDM1 and OsDRM2 in genome-wide DNA methylation, TE repression, small RNA accumulation, and gene expression. We show that OsDDM1 is essential for high levels of methylation at CHG and, to a lesser extent, CG sites in heterochromatic regions, and is also required for CHH methylation that mainly locates in the genic regions of the genome. In addition to a large member of TEs, loss of OsDDM1 leads to hypo-methylation and up-regulation of many protein-coding genes, producing very severe growth phenotypes at the initial generation. Importantly, we show that OsDRM2 mutation results in a near complete loss of CHH methylation and de-repression of mainly small TE-associated genes, and that OsDDM1 is involved in facilitating OsDRM2-mediated CHH methylation. Thus, the function of OsDDM1 and OsDRM2 defines distinct DNA methylation pathways in the bulk of DNA methylation of the genome, which is possibly related to the dispersed heterochromatin across chromosomes in rice and suggests that DNA methylation mechanism may vary among different plant species.
