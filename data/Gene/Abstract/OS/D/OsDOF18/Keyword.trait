OsDOF18	nitrogen	Transcription Factor OsDOF18 Controls Ammonium Uptake by Inducing Ammonium Transporters in Rice Roots.	 The growth of null mutants of<U+00A0>OsDOF18 was retarded in a medium containing ammonium as the sole nitrogen source
OsDOF18	nitrogen	Transcription Factor OsDOF18 Controls Ammonium Uptake by Inducing Ammonium Transporters in Rice Roots.	 These results provide evidence that OsDOF18 mediates ammonium transport and nitrogen distribution, which then affects nitrogen use efficiency
OsDOF18	transcription factor	Transcription Factor OsDOF18 Controls Ammonium Uptake by Inducing Ammonium Transporters in Rice Roots.	Transcription Factor OsDOF18 Controls Ammonium Uptake by Inducing Ammonium Transporters in Rice Roots.
OsDOF18	growth	Transcription Factor OsDOF18 Controls Ammonium Uptake by Inducing Ammonium Transporters in Rice Roots.	 The growth of null mutants of<U+00A0>OsDOF18 was retarded in a medium containing ammonium as the sole nitrogen source
OsDOF18	transporter	Transcription Factor OsDOF18 Controls Ammonium Uptake by Inducing Ammonium Transporters in Rice Roots.	 Among the 10 ammonium transporter genes examined here, expression of OsAMT1;1,<U+00A0>OsAMT1;3, OsAMT2;1, and OsAMT4;1 was reduced in osdof18 mutants, demonstrating that the ammonium transporter genes function downstream of OsDOF18
OsDOF18	nitrate	Transcription Factor OsDOF18 Controls Ammonium Uptake by Inducing Ammonium Transporters in Rice Roots.	 Uptake of ammonium was lower in osdof18 mutants than in the wild type, while that of nitrate was not affected by the mutation
