ADL1|OsDEK1	leaf	The ADAXIALIZED LEAF1 gene functions in leaf and embryonic pattern formation in rice	 To understand axis information in leaf development, we isolated the adaxialized leaf1 (adl1) mutant in rice, which forms abaxially rolled leaves| An adl1 double mutant with the adaxially snowy leaf mutant, which has albino cells that specifically appear in the abaxial mesophyll tissue, indicated that adl1 leaves show adaxialization in both epidermal and mesophyll tissues| This indicated that ADL1 may not be directly involved in determining initial leaf polarity, but rather is associated with the maintenance of axis information| We propose that ADL1 plays an important role in pattern formation of the leaf and embryo by promoting proper epidermal development
ADL1|OsDEK1	leaf development	The ADAXIALIZED LEAF1 gene functions in leaf and embryonic pattern formation in rice	 To understand axis information in leaf development, we isolated the adaxialized leaf1 (adl1) mutant in rice, which forms abaxially rolled leaves
ADL1|OsDEK1	shoot	The ADAXIALIZED LEAF1 gene functions in leaf and embryonic pattern formation in rice	 Furthermore, we identified intermediate and strong alleles of the adl1 mutant that generate shootless embryos and globular-arrested embryos with aleurone layer loss, respectively
