NA	Mutation of DEFECTIVE EMBRYO SAC1 results in a low seed-setting rate in rice by regulating embryo sac development.	2022	J Exp Bot	China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 311400, China.	The seed-setting rate has a significant effect on grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Embryo sac development is essential for seed setting; however, the molecular mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. Here, we isolated defective embryo sac1 (des1), a rice mutant with a low seed-setting rate. Cytological examination showed degenerated embryo sacs and reduced fertilization capacity in des1. Map-based cloning revealed a nonsense mutation in OsDES1, a gene that encodes a putative nuclear envelope membrane protein (NEMP)-domain-containing protein that is preferentially expressed in pistils. The OsDES1 mutation disrupts the normal formation of functional megaspores, which ultimately results in a degenerated embryo sac in des1. Reciprocal crosses showed that fertilization is abnormal and that the female reproductive organ is defective in des1. OsDES1 interacts with LONELY GUY (LOG), a cytokinin-activating enzyme that acts in the final step of cytokinin synthesis; mutation of LOG led to defective female reproductive organ development. These results demonstrate that OsDES1 functions in determining the rice seed-setting rate by regulating embryo sac development and fertilization. Our study sheds light on the function of NEMP-type proteins in rice reproductive development.
