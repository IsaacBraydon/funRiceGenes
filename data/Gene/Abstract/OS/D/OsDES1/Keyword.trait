OsDES1	development	Mutation of DEFECTIVE EMBRYO SAC1 results in a low seed-setting rate in rice by regulating embryo sac development.	 OsDES1 interacts with LONELY GUY (LOG), a cytokinin-activating enzyme that acts in the final step of cytokinin synthesis; mutation of LOG led to defective female reproductive organ development
OsDES1	development	Mutation of DEFECTIVE EMBRYO SAC1 results in a low seed-setting rate in rice by regulating embryo sac development.	 These results demonstrate that OsDES1 functions in determining the rice seed-setting rate by regulating embryo sac development and fertilization
OsDES1	cytokinin	Mutation of DEFECTIVE EMBRYO SAC1 results in a low seed-setting rate in rice by regulating embryo sac development.	 OsDES1 interacts with LONELY GUY (LOG), a cytokinin-activating enzyme that acts in the final step of cytokinin synthesis; mutation of LOG led to defective female reproductive organ development
OsDES1	reproductive	Mutation of DEFECTIVE EMBRYO SAC1 results in a low seed-setting rate in rice by regulating embryo sac development.	 OsDES1 interacts with LONELY GUY (LOG), a cytokinin-activating enzyme that acts in the final step of cytokinin synthesis; mutation of LOG led to defective female reproductive organ development
OsDES1	embryo	Mutation of DEFECTIVE EMBRYO SAC1 results in a low seed-setting rate in rice by regulating embryo sac development.	 The OsDES1 mutation disrupts the normal formation of functional megaspores, which ultimately results in a degenerated embryo sac in des1
OsDES1	embryo	Mutation of DEFECTIVE EMBRYO SAC1 results in a low seed-setting rate in rice by regulating embryo sac development.	 These results demonstrate that OsDES1 functions in determining the rice seed-setting rate by regulating embryo sac development and fertilization
OsDES1	seed-setting	Mutation of DEFECTIVE EMBRYO SAC1 results in a low seed-setting rate in rice by regulating embryo sac development.	 These results demonstrate that OsDES1 functions in determining the rice seed-setting rate by regulating embryo sac development and fertilization
