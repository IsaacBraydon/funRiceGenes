OsARF17	OsDR8	Transcriptome analysis of auxin transcription factor OsARF17-mediated rice stripe mosaic virus response in rice.	 RT-qPCR assays showed that the induction of plant defense-related genes, such as WRKY transcription factors, OsAHT2 and OsDR8, and JA-related genes, were significantly suppressed in OsARF17 mutants in response to RSMV
