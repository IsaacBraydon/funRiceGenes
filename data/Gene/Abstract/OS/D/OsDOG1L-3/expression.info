OsDOG1L-3	 There were evident promoter and expression differences in OsDOG1L-3 between N22 and Nanjing35, and overexpression or introduction of the N22 OsDOG1L-3 allele in Nanjing35 enhanced its seed dormancy |  OsDOG1L-3 expression was positively correlated with seed dormancy and induced by ABA |  OsbZIP75 and OsbZIP78 bound directly with the promoter of OsDOG1L-3 to induce its expression |  Overexpression of OsbZIP75 increased OsDOG1L-3 protein abundance and promoted seed dormancy |  OsDOG1L-3 upregulated expression of ABA-related genes and increased ABA content	 There were evident promoter and expression differences in OsDOG1L-3 between N22 and Nanjing35, and overexpression or introduction of the N22 OsDOG1L-3 allele in Nanjing35 enhanced its seed dormancy |  Overexpression of OsbZIP75 increased OsDOG1L-3 protein abundance and promoted seed dormancy
