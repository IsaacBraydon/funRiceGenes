NA	OsDOG1L-3 regulates seed dormancy through the abscisic acid pathway in rice	2020	Plant Science	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Seed dormancy is closely related to pre-harvest sprouting resistance. Both plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) and DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 (DOG1) protein are key regulators of seed dormancy. Their relationship is well reported in Arabidopsis, but little is known in rice. Here, we show that a quantitative trait locus, qSd-1-1 contributes significantly to seed dormancy differences between the strongly dormant indica variety N22 and non-dormant japonica variety Nanjing35. It encodes a DOG1-like protein named OsDOG1L-3 with homology to Arabidopsis DOG1. There were evident promoter and expression differences in OsDOG1L-3 between N22 and Nanjing35, and overexpression or introduction of the N22 OsDOG1L-3 allele in Nanjing35 enhanced its seed dormancy. OsDOG1L-3 expression was positively correlated with seed dormancy and induced by ABA. OsbZIP75 and OsbZIP78 bound directly with the promoter of OsDOG1L-3 to induce its expression. Overexpression of OsbZIP75 increased OsDOG1L-3 protein abundance and promoted seed dormancy. OsDOG1L-3 upregulated expression of ABA-related genes and increased ABA content. We propose that the N22 OsDOG1L-3 allele is a candidate gene for the seed dormancy in QTL qSd-1-1, and that it participates in the ABA pathway to establish seed dormancy in rice.
