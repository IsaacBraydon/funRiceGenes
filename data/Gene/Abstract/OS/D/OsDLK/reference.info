NA	A rice class-XIV kinesin enters the nucleus in response to cold.	2018	Sci Rep	Molecular Cell Biology, Botanical Institute, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Fritz-Haber-Weg 4, 76131, Karlsruhe, Germany. xiaolu.xu@student.kit.edu.	Higher plants possess a large number of kinesins, but lack the minus-end directed dynein motors. However, the kinesin class XIV has strongly expanded, and minus-end directed motors from this class may have taken over functions of cytoplasmic dyneins. In this study, we address the functional aspects of a novel rice homologue of the Arabidopsis class-XIV kinesins ATK1 and ATK5. Since a loss-of-function rice mutant of this kinesin is not viable, the function was studied in tobacco BY-2 as heterologous system. OsDLK-GFP stably expressed in BY-2 cells decorates cortical microtubules, but also can shift into the nucleus of interphase cells. Because of this peculiar localisation, we coined the name Dual Localisation Kinesin (DLK). The nuclear import of this protein is strongly and reversibly promoted in response to cold. During mitosis, OsDLK is repartitioned between spindle and phragmoplast. Motility assays in vitro using show that OsDLK can convey mutual sliding of microtubules and moves at a velocity comparable to other class-XIV kinesins. When tobacco cells overexpressing OsDLK are synchronised, they exhibit a delayed entry into metaphase, while the later phases of mitosis are accelerated. The data are discussed in relation to additional functions of this kinesin type, beyond their transport along microtubules.
NA	The Minus-End-Directed Kinesin OsDLK Shuttles to the Nucleus and Modulates the Expression of Cold-Box Factor 4.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	Molecular Cell Biology, Botanical Institute, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Fritz-Haber-Weg 4, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.	The transition to terrestrial plants was accompanied by a progressive loss of microtubule minus-end-directed dynein motors. Instead, the minus-end-directed class-XIV kinesins expanded considerably, likely related to novel functions. One of these motors, OsDLK (Dual Localisation Kinesin from rice), decorates cortical microtubules but moves into the nucleus in response to cold stress. This analysis of loss-of-function mutants in rice indicates that OsDLK participates in cell elongation during development. Since OsDLK harbours both a nuclear localisation signal and a putative leucin zipper, we asked whether the cold-induced import of OsDLK into the nucleus might correlate with specific DNA binding. Conducting a DPI-ELISA screen with recombinant OsDLKT (lacking the motor domain), we identified the Opaque2 motif as the most promising candidate. This motif is present in the promoter of NtAvr9/Cf9, the tobacco homologue of Cold-Box Factor 4, a transcription factor involved in cold adaptation. A comparative study revealed that the cold-induced accumulation of NtAvr9/Cfp9 was specifically quelled in transgenic BY-2 cells overexpressing OsDLK-GFP. These findings are discussed as a working model, where, in response to cold stress, OsDLK partitions from cortical microtubules at the plasma membrane into the nucleus and specifically modulates the expression of genes involved in cold adaptation.
