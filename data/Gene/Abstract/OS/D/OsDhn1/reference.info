10.1007-s12374-012-0377-3.pdf	Drought inducible OsDhn1 promoter is activated by OsDREB1A and OsDREB1D	2013	Journal of Plant Biology	Department of Life Science, Sogang University, Seoul, 121-742, Korea	In order to understand the stress-responsive mechanism controlling OsDhn1 gene, promoter analysis of OsDhn1 gene was conducted. First, a 1.5 kb-long promoter region of OsDhn1 was isolated and characterized by Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis. GUS assay of OsDhn1::gus plants showed that the GUS activity in the leaves was induced by drought stress but not by wound, cold, salt, or ABA treatment. Second, transactivation assay revealed that OsDhn1 promoter is activated by OsDREB1A or OsDREB1D as well as CBF1 but not by OsDREB1B or OsDREB1C. Taken together, these suggest that the drought-inducible OsDhn1 gene is regulated by abiotic stress signaling pathway involving CBF/DREB.
90268306.pdf	Characterization of an abiotic stress-inducible dehydrin gene, OsDhn1, in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2005	Mol Cells	Department of Life Science, Sogang University, Seoul 121-742, Korea.	A full-length 1.1 kb cDNA, designated Oryza sativa Dehydrin 1 (OsDhn1), was isolated from the seed coat of rice. The deduced protein is hydrophilic and has three K-type and one S-type motifs (SK3-type), indicating that OsDhn1 belongs to the acidic dehydrin family, which includes wheat WCOR410 and Arabidopsis COR47. Expression of OsDhn1 was strongly induced by low temperature as well as by drought. Induction of OsDhn1 by cold stress was clearcut in the roots of seedlings and the epidermis of palea and lemma. OsDhn1 was also up-regulated in UBI::CBF1/DREB1b transgenic plants indicating that it is regulated by the CBF/DREB stress signaling pathway.
NA	Mutation of OsGIGANTEA Leads to Enhanced Tolerance to Polyethylene Glycol-Generated Osmotic Stress in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang UniversityHangzhou, China; College of Life Sciences, Qingdao Agricultural UniversityQingdao, China.	Water deficit is one of the most important environmental stresses limiting plant growth and crop yield. While the identification of many key factors involved in the plant water deficit response has greatly increased our knowledge about the regulation system, the mechanisms underlying dehydration tolerance in plants are still not well understood. In our current study, we investigated the roles of the key flowering time regulator, OsGIGANTEA (OsGI), in the osmotic stress tolerance in rice. Results showed that mutation of OsGI conferred tolerance to osmotic stress generated by polyethylene glycol (PEG), increased proline and sucrose contents, and accelerated stomata movement. In addition, qRT-PCR and microarray analysis revealed that the transcript abundance of some osmotic stress response genes, such as OsDREB1E, OsAP37, OsAP59, OsLIP9, OsLEA3, OsRAB16A, and OsSalT, was significantly higher in osgi than in WT plants, suggesting that OsGI might be a negative regulator in the osmotic stress response in rice.
