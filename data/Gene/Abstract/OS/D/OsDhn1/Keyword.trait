OsDhn1|OsLip9	temperature	Characterization of an abiotic stress-inducible dehydrin gene, OsDhn1, in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Expression of OsDhn1 was strongly induced by low temperature as well as by drought
OsDhn1|OsLip9	salt	Drought inducible OsDhn1 promoter is activated by OsDREB1A and OsDREB1D	 GUS assay of OsDhn1::gus plants showed that the GUS activity in the leaves was induced by drought stress but not by wound, cold, salt, or ABA treatment
