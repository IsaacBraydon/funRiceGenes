Symbol	Expression	Overexpression
OsDSSR1	 OsDSSR1 expression is also induced by drought, salinity, ABA, and H2O2treatment |  Overexpression of OsDSSR1 promoted the accumulation of compatible osmolytes, such as free proline and soluble sugars |  OsDSSR1-overexpressing plants displayed enhanced OsSodCc2 and OscAPX expression and superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase activities under drought stress	 Overexpression of OsDSSR1 promoted the accumulation of compatible osmolytes, such as free proline and soluble sugars
