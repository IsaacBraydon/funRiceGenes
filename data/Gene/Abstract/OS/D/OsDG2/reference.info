KEY MESSAGE: OsDG2 gene encoded a novel chloroplast-targeted GRP in rice. Disruption of the OsDG2 would lead to delayed greening phenotype and affected expression levels of genes associated with chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice. Glycine-rich proteins (GRPs) participate in various biological processes in plants. However, the evidence of GRPs involved in chloroplast development in plants is quite limited. In this study, we identified a rice GRP gene mutant named osdg2 (O ryza s ativa d elayed g reening 2), which exhibits delayed greening phenotype characterized as bright yellow leaves before the three-leaf stage and thereafter turns to normal green. Further study showed that the mutant phenotype was consistent with changes in chlorophyll content and chloroplast development. The rice OsDG2 gene, encoding a novel GRP protein, was located on chromosome 2 through map-based cloning method and confirmed by molecular complementation tests. Subcellular localization results showed that OsDG2 was targeted in chloroplasts. In addition, the OsDG2 transcripts were highly expressed in leaves and undetectable in other tissues, showing the tissue-specific expression. In osdg2 mutant, the expression levels of most genes associated with chloroplast development were severely decreased in the 3rd leaves, but almost recovered to wild-type level in the 4th leaves. Our findings indicated that the nuclear-encoded OsDG2 plays important roles in chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice.
