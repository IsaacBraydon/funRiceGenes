OsDG2	seedling	The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage	The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage
OsDG2	chloroplast	The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage	KEY MESSAGE: OsDG2 gene encoded a novel chloroplast-targeted GRP in rice
OsDG2	chloroplast	The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage	Disruption of the OsDG2 would lead to delayed greening phenotype and affected expression levels of genes associated with chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice
OsDG2	chloroplast	The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage	Subcellular localization results showed that OsDG2 was targeted in chloroplasts
OsDG2	chloroplast	The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage	In osdg2 mutant, the expression levels of most genes associated with chloroplast development were severely decreased in the 3rd leaves, but almost recovered to wild-type level in the 4th leaves
OsDG2	chloroplast	The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage	Our findings indicated that the nuclear-encoded OsDG2 plays important roles in chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice
OsDG2	chloroplast	The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage	The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage
OsDG2	leaf	The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage	Disruption of the OsDG2 would lead to delayed greening phenotype and affected expression levels of genes associated with chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice
OsDG2	leaf	The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage	In this study, we identified a rice GRP gene mutant named osdg2 (O ryza s ativa d elayed g reening 2), which exhibits delayed greening phenotype characterized as bright yellow leaves before the three-leaf stage and thereafter turns to normal green
OsDG2	leaf	The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage	Our findings indicated that the nuclear-encoded OsDG2 plays important roles in chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice
