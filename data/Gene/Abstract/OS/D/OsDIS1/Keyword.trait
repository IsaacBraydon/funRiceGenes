OsDIS1	salt	OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice	" Here we also show that OsDIS1 interacts with OsSKIPa, a drought and salt stress positive regulator in rice"
OsDIS1	drought tolerance	The SINA E3 ligase OsDIS1 negatively regulates drought response in rice	" Overexpression of OsDIS1 reduced drought tolerance in transgenic rice plants, while RNA interference silencing of OsDIS1 enhanced drought tolerance"
OsDIS1	salt stress	OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice	" Here we also show that OsDIS1 interacts with OsSKIPa, a drought and salt stress positive regulator in rice"
OsDIS1	drought	OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice	" We recently showed that OsDIS1 (Oryza sativa drought-induced SINA protein 1), a SINA type E3 ligase, is involved in the drought-stress signal transduction in rice| OsDIS1 plays a negative role in drought stress tolerance through the transcriptional regulation of diverse stress-related genes and also possibly through the posttranslational regulation of its interacting protein OsNek6 in rice| Here we also show that OsDIS1 interacts with OsSKIPa, a drought and salt stress positive regulator in rice"
OsDIS1	drought	The SINA E3 ligase OsDIS1 negatively regulates drought response in rice	" Here, we report that OsDIS1 (for Oryza sativa drought-induced SINA protein 1), a C3HC4 RING finger E3 ligase, is involved in drought-stress signal transduction in rice (O| The expression of OsDIS1 was up-regulated by drought treatment| Overexpression of OsDIS1 reduced drought tolerance in transgenic rice plants, while RNA interference silencing of OsDIS1 enhanced drought tolerance| Microarray analysis revealed that a large number of drought-responsive genes were induced or suppressed in the OsDIS1 overexpression plants under normal and drought conditions| Together, these results demonstrate that OsDIS1 plays a negative role in drought stress tolerance through transcriptional regulation of diverse stress-related genes and possibly through posttranslational regulation of OsNek6 in rice|The SINA E3 ligase OsDIS1 negatively regulates drought response in rice"
