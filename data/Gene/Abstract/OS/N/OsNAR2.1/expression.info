Symbol	Expression
OsNAR2.1	Two short sequences in OsNAR2.1 promoter are necessary for fully activating the nitrate induced gene expression in rice roots.
OsNAR2.1	pOsNAR2.1:OsNAR2.1 expression enhances nitrogen uptake efficiency and grain yield in transgenic rice plants.
OsNAR2.1	OsNAR2.1 induced endogenous nitrogen concentration variation affects transcriptional expression of miRNAs in rice.
OsNAR2.1	Nuclear translocation of OsMADS25 facilitated by OsNAR2.1 in response to nitrate signal promotes root growth by regulating the expression of OsMADS27 and OsARF7 in rice.
