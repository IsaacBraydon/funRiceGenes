OsNRT1.1A|OsNPF6.3	flowering	Expression of the Nitrate Transporter Gene OsNRT1.1A/OsNPF6.3 Confers High Yield and Early Maturation in Rice	The improved growth and early-flowering phenotypes and the upregulation of early-flowering genes in OsNRT1.1A-OE plants are consistent with the results from the osnrt1.1a mutant, which collectively demonstrated that OsNRT1.1A plays important roles in promoting both N utilization and flowering.
