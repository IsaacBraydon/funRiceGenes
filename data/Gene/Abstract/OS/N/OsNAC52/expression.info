OsNAC52	 Furthermore, over-expression of OsNAC52 activated the expression of downstream genes in transgenic Arabidopsis, resulting in enhanced tolerance to drought stresses but not growth retardation |  The results from this study indicate that this novel rice OsNAC52 gene functions as an important transcriptional activator in ABA-inducible gene expression and may be useful in improving plant tolerance to abiotic stress
