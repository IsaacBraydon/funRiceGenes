OsNAC52	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	ipa1 improves rice drought tolerance at seedling stage mainly through activating abscisic acid pathway.	 In addition, based on yeast one-hybrid assay and dual-luciferase assay, IPA1 was found to directly activate the promoter activity of OsHOX12, a transcription factor promoting ABA biosynthesis, and OsNAC52, a positive regulator of the ABA pathway
OsNAC52	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	ipa1 improves rice drought tolerance at seedling stage mainly through activating abscisic acid pathway.	 The expression of OsHOX12 and OsNAC52 was significantly up-regulated in the ipa1 plants
