A HAP complex, which consists of three subunits, namely HAP2 (also called NF-YA or CBF-B), HAP3 (NF-YB/CBF-A) and HAP5 (NF-YC/CBF-C), binds to CCAAT sequences in a promoter to control the expression of target genes. We identified 10 HAP2 genes, 11 HAP3 genes and 7 HAP5 genes in the rice genome. All the three HAP family genes encode a protein with a conserved domain in each family and various non-conserved regions in both length and amino acid sequence. These genes showed various expression patterns depending on genes, and various combinations of overlapped expression of the HAP2, HAP3 and HAP5 genes were observed. Furthermore, protein interaction analyses showed interaction of OsHAP3A, a ubiquitously expressed HAP3 subunit of rice, with specific members of HAP5. These results indicate that the formation of specific complex with various HAP subunits combinations can be achieved by both tissue specific expression of three subunit genes and specific interaction of three subunit proteins. This may suggest that the HAP complexes may control various aspects of rice growth and development through tissue specific expression and complex formation of three subunit members.
J. Biol. Chem.-2002-Masiero-26429-35.pdf	Ternary complex formation between MADS-box transcription factors and the histone fold protein NF-YB	2002	J Biol Chem	Dipartimento di Genetica e Biologia dei Microrganismi, Universita di Milano, Via Celoria 26, 20133 Milano, Italy.	MADS-box proteins are transcription factors present in different eukaryotic kingdoms. In contrast to plants, for mammalian and yeast MADS-box proteins ternary complex formation with unrelated transcription factors was reported. We show here the first identification of such ternary interaction in plants. A rice seed-specific NF-YB was identified as partner of OsMADS18 by two-hybrid screening. NF-YB contains a histone fold motif, HFM,(1) and is part of the trimeric CCAAT-binding NF-Y complex. OsMADS18, alone or in combination with a natural partner, interacts with OsNF-YB1 through the MADS and I regions. The mouse NF-YB also associates with OsMADS18 in vivo and in vitro as a NF-YB-NF-YC dimer. Other rice MADS-box proteins do not interact in these assays, indicating specificity for the interaction. OsNF-YB1 is capable of heterodimerizing with NF-YC, but not trimerizing with NF-YA, thus precluding CCAAT binding. Mutation of the variant Asp at position 99 of the HFM alpha2-helix into a conserved serine recovers the capacity to interact with NF-YA, but not with DNA. This is the first indication that members of the NF-YB family work through mechanisms independent of the CCAAT box.
NA	OsNF-YB1, a rice endosperm-specific gene, is essential for cell proliferation in endosperm development.	2014	Gene	College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Cell cycle regulators are crucial for normal endosperm development and seed size determination. However, how the cell cycle related genes regulate endosperm development remains unclear. In this study, we reported a rice Nuclear Factor Y (NF-Y) gene OsNF-YB1, which was also identified as an endosperm-specific gene. Transcriptional profiling and promoter analysis revealed that OsNF-YB1 was highly expressed at the early stages of rice endosperm development (5-7 DAP, days after pollination). Repression of OsNF-YB1 resulted in differential expression of the genes in cell cycle pathway, which caused abnormal seeds with defected embryo and endosperm. Basic cytological analysis demonstrated that the reduced endosperm cell numbers disintegrated with the development of those abnormal seeds in OsNF-YB1 RNAi plants. Taken together, these results suggested that the endosperm-specific gene OsNF-YB1 might be a cell cycle regulator and played a role in maintaining the endosperm cell proliferation.

NA	Rice aleurone layer specific OsNF-YB1 regulates grain filling and endosperm development by interacting with an ERF transcription factor.	2016	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 300 Fenglin Road, 200032 Shanghai, China.	Grain yield and quality of rice mainly depend on grain filling and endosperm development. Here we report that a rice NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y) transcription factor, OsNF-YB1, is specifically expressed in the aleurone layer of developing endosperm and regulates grain filling and endosperm development. Knockdown of OsNF-YB1 expression by RNAi significantly retarded grain filling, leading to small grains with chalky endosperm as well as altered starch quality. Whereas OsNF-YB1 shows subcellular localization in both the cytosol and the nucleus in roots, it was specifically targeted to the nucleus of aleurone layer cells, which was facilitated by interacting with OsNF-YC proteins preferentially expressed in the aleurone layer. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that genes related to membrane transport and ATP biosynthesis were enriched in the down-regulated category in OsNF-YB1 RNAi plants, which is consistent with the crucial role of OsNF-YB1 in rice grain filling and endosperm development. Identification of the genome-wide targets of OsNF-YB1 by ChIP sequencing showed that OsNF-YB1 directly regulates genes involved in the transport of nutrients such as sugar and amino acids. Interestingly, different from the binding sites reported for other NF-Y complexes, the GCC box, the binding motif of ERF transcription factors, was enriched in the binding peaks of OsNF-YB1. Indeed, further analyses confirmed the interaction of OsERF#115 with OsNF-YB1, and OsERF#115 directly binds to the GCC box. It is proposed that OsNF-YB1 specifically regulate the transcription of downstream genes during rice endosperm development by forming protein complexes consisting of OsNF-YB1, OsNF-YC and ERF, providing informative insights into the molecular functional mechanisms of the NF-Y factor.
