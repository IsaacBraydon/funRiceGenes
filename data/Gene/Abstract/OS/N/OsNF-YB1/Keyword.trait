OsNF-YB1	endosperm	OsNF-YB1, a rice endosperm-specific gene, is essential for cell proliferation in endosperm development.	 Transcriptional profiling and promoter analysis revealed that OsNF-YB1 was highly expressed at the early stages of rice endosperm development (5-7 DAP, days after pollination)
OsNF-YB1	endosperm	OsNF-YB1, a rice endosperm-specific gene, is essential for cell proliferation in endosperm development.	 Repression of OsNF-YB1 resulted in differential expression of the genes in cell cycle pathway, which caused abnormal seeds with defected embryo and endosperm
OsNF-YB1	endosperm	OsNF-YB1, a rice endosperm-specific gene, is essential for cell proliferation in endosperm development.	 Basic cytological analysis demonstrated that the reduced endosperm cell numbers disintegrated with the development of those abnormal seeds in OsNF-YB1 RNAi plants
OsNF-YB1	endosperm	OsNF-YB1, a rice endosperm-specific gene, is essential for cell proliferation in endosperm development.	 Taken together, these results suggested that the endosperm-specific gene OsNF-YB1 might be a cell cycle regulator and played a role in maintaining the endosperm cell proliferation
OsNF-YB1	cell cycle	OsNF-YB1, a rice endosperm-specific gene, is essential for cell proliferation in endosperm development.	 Repression of OsNF-YB1 resulted in differential expression of the genes in cell cycle pathway, which caused abnormal seeds with defected embryo and endosperm

OsNF-YB1	sucrose transporter	NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm	NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm
OsNF-YB1	sugar	NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm	NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm
