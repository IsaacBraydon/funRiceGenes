OsNF-YB1	 Repression of OsNF-YB1 resulted in differential expression of the genes in cell cycle pathway, which caused abnormal seeds with defected embryo and endosperm	 Basic cytological analysis demonstrated that the reduced endosperm cell numbers disintegrated with the development of those abnormal seeds in OsNF-YB1 RNAi plants
OsNF-YB1	 Knockdown of OsNF-YB1 expression by RNAi significantly retarded grain filling, leading to small grains with chalky endosperm as well as altered starch quality	 Knockdown of OsNF-YB1 expression by RNAi significantly retarded grain filling, leading to small grains with chalky endosperm as well as altered starch quality |  RNA sequencing analysis revealed that genes related to membrane transport and ATP biosynthesis were enriched in the down-regulated category in OsNF-YB1 RNAi plants, which is consistent with the crucial role of OsNF-YB1 in rice grain filling and endosperm development
