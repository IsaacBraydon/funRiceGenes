OsNF-YB1	OsSUT1	NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm	In summary, the aleurone-specific NF-YB1, with stronger expression at the dorsal side, plays an important role in regulating rice grain filling through activating the expression of SUT1, SUT3 and SUT4
OsNF-YB1	OsSUT4	NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm	In summary, the aleurone-specific NF-YB1, with stronger expression at the dorsal side, plays an important role in regulating rice grain filling through activating the expression of SUT1, SUT3 and SUT4

OsMST4	OsNF-YB1	NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm	Real-time PCR performed in caryopses collected at 5 DAP showed that levels of SUT1, SUT3, SUT4 and MST4 expression were reduced in nfyb1-1, while no evident reduction was observed for SUT2, suggesting that SUT1, SUT3, SUT4 and MST4 may be regulated by NF-YB1
OsbZIP76	OsNF-YB1	OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice  (Oryza sativa).	 As a putative  transcription factor, OsbZIP76 alone lacked transcriptional activation activity;  however, it interacted with the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) family transcription factors OsNF-YB9 and OsNF-YB1 in yeast and in planta
OsbZIP76	OsNF-YB1	OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice  (Oryza sativa).	 Seeds of osnf-yb1 and osbzip76 mutants showed reduced size and reduced apparent amylose content
OsNF-YB1	OsYUC11	RGB1 Regulates Grain Development and Starch Accumulation Through Its Effect on OsYUC11-Mediated Auxin Biosynthesis in Rice Endosperm Cells	 Suppression of RGB1 expression also resulted in the lower auxin content in grains, which was correlated with the lower expression of OsNF-YB1 and OsYUC11 during grain filling stage
OsNF-YB1	OsYUC11	RGB1 Regulates Grain Development and Starch Accumulation Through Its Effect on OsYUC11-Mediated Auxin Biosynthesis in Rice Endosperm Cells	 Further biochemical evidence showed that OsYUC11 expression was under control of OsNF-YB1 by its interaction with promoter of OsYUC11
OsNF-YB1	OsYUC11	RGB1 Regulates Grain Development and Starch Accumulation Through Its Effect on OsYUC11-Mediated Auxin Biosynthesis in Rice Endosperm Cells	 OsNF-YB1, which acts as a key downstream effector of RGB1, interacts directly with the promoter of OsYUC11 and stimulates the OsYUC11 expression, thereby regulating auxin biosynthesis and starch accumulation and grain size
