OsHMA2|OsHMA2v	OsNRAMP5	Silicon reduces cadmium accumulation by suppressing expression of transporter genes involved in cadmium uptake and translocation in rice.	 The expression level of OsNramp5 and OsHMA2 was down-regulated by Si in the WTs, but not in the mutants
Lsi1|OsNIP2;1|OsLsi1	OsNRAMP5	Altered root structure affects both expression and cellular localization of transporters for mineral element uptake in rice.	 The expression level of some transporter genes including OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 for Si uptake and OsNramp5 for Mn uptake was significantly decreased in the mutant compared with the wild-type rice
Lsi2|OsLsi2	OsNRAMP5	Altered root structure affects both expression and cellular localization of transporters for mineral element uptake in rice.	 The expression level of some transporter genes including OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 for Si uptake and OsNramp5 for Mn uptake was significantly decreased in the mutant compared with the wild-type rice
OsNRAMP1	OsNRAMP5	OsNRAMP1 contributes to cadmium and manganese uptake in rice 	 The knockout of OsNRAMP1 had smaller effects on Cd and Mn uptake than knockout of OsNRAMP5, while knockout of both genes resulted in large decreases in the uptake of the two metals
OsNRAMP1	OsNRAMP5	OsNRAMP1 contributes to cadmium and manganese uptake in rice 	 Taken together, OsNRAMP1 contributes significantly to the uptake of Mn and Cd in rice and the functions of OsNRAMP1 and OsNRAMP5 are similar but not redundant
OsNRAMP1	OsNRAMP5	Calcium Plays a Double-Edged Role in Modulating Cadmium Uptake and Translocation in Rice	 Our results showed that the supplement of 5 mM Ca significantly reduced Cd uptake by rice roots, because of their competition for Ca-permeable channels as an absorption site and Ca-induced downregulation of OsNRAMP1 and OsNRAMP5
