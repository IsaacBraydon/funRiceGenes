OsNRAMP5	shoot	Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport	 OsNRAMP5 RNAi (OsNRAMP5i) plants accumulated less Mn in the roots, and less Mn and Fe in shoots, and xylem sap
OsNRAMP5	shoot	Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport	 The suppression of OsNRAMP5 promoted Cd translocation to shoots, highlighting the importance of this gene for Cd phytoremediation
OsNRAMP5	root	Ion-beam irradiation, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in the development of low-cadmium rice	 Functional analysis revealed that the defective transporter protein encoded by the mutant osnramp5 greatly decreases Cd uptake by roots, resulting in decreased Cd in the straw and grain
OsNRAMP5	transporter	Ion-beam irradiation, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in the development of low-cadmium rice	 Functional analysis revealed that the defective transporter protein encoded by the mutant osnramp5 greatly decreases Cd uptake by roots, resulting in decreased Cd in the straw and grain
OsNRAMP5	xylem	Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport	 OsNRAMP5 expression was restricted to roots epidermis, exodermis, and outer layers of the cortex as well as in tissues around the xylem
OsNRAMP5	xylem	Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport	 OsNRAMP5 RNAi (OsNRAMP5i) plants accumulated less Mn in the roots, and less Mn and Fe in shoots, and xylem sap
OsNRAMP5	growth	Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport	 OsNRAMP5 localized to the plasma membrane, and complemented the growth of yeast strains defective in Mn, Fe, and Cd transport
OsNRAMP5	growth	Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport	 These data reveal that OsNRAMP5 contributes to Mn, Cd, and Fe transport in rice and is important for plant growth and development
OsNRAMP5	grain	Ion-beam irradiation, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in the development of low-cadmium rice	 Functional analysis revealed that the defective transporter protein encoded by the mutant osnramp5 greatly decreases Cd uptake by roots, resulting in decreased Cd in the straw and grain
OsNRAMP5	root	Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport	 OsNRAMP5 expression was restricted to roots epidermis, exodermis, and outer layers of the cortex as well as in tissues around the xylem
OsNRAMP5	root	Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport	 OsNRAMP5 RNAi (OsNRAMP5i) plants accumulated less Mn in the roots, and less Mn and Fe in shoots, and xylem sap
