Ishimaru-2012-Characterizing the r.pdf	Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport	2012	Sci Rep	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan	Metals like manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) are essential for metabolism, while cadmium (Cd) is toxic for virtually all living organisms. Understanding the transport of these metals is important for breeding better crops. We have identified that OsNRAMP5 contributes to Mn, Fe and Cd transport in rice. OsNRAMP5 expression was restricted to roots epidermis, exodermis, and outer layers of the cortex as well as in tissues around the xylem. OsNRAMP5 localized to the plasma membrane, and complemented the growth of yeast strains defective in Mn, Fe, and Cd transport. OsNRAMP5 RNAi (OsNRAMP5i) plants accumulated less Mn in the roots, and less Mn and Fe in shoots, and xylem sap. The suppression of OsNRAMP5 promoted Cd translocation to shoots, highlighting the importance of this gene for Cd phytoremediation. These data reveal that OsNRAMP5 contributes to Mn, Cd, and Fe transport in rice and is important for plant growth and development.
PNAS-2012-Ishikawa-1211132109.pdf	Ion-beam irradiation, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in the development of low-cadmium rice	2012	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Soil Environment Division, National Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8604, Japan. isatoru@affrc.go.jp	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) grain is a major dietary source of cadmium (Cd), which is toxic to humans, but no practical technique exists to substantially reduce Cd contamination. Carbon ion-beam irradiation produced three rice mutants with <0.05 mg Cdkg(-1) in the grain compared with a mean of 1.73 mg Cdkg(-1) in the parent, Koshihikari. We identified the gene responsible for reduced Cd uptake and developed a strategy for marker-assisted selection of low-Cd cultivars. Sequence analysis revealed that these mutants have different mutations of the same gene (OsNRAMP5), which encodes a natural resistance-associated macrophage protein. Functional analysis revealed that the defective transporter protein encoded by the mutant osnramp5 greatly decreases Cd uptake by roots, resulting in decreased Cd in the straw and grain. In addition, we developed DNA markers to facilitate marker-assisted selection of cultivars carrying osnramp5. When grown in Cd-contaminated paddy fields, the mutants have nearly undetectable Cd in their grains and exhibit no agriculturally or economically adverse traits. Because mutants produced by ion-beam radiation are not transgenic plants, they are likely to be accepted by consumers and thus represent a practical choice for rice production worldwide.
NA	Knockout of OsNramp5 using the CRISPR/Cas9 system produces low Cd-accumulating indica rice without compromising yield.	2017	Sci Rep	Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Phytohormones and Growth Development, College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China.	Rice grain with excessive cadmium (Cd) is a major source of dietary Cd intake and a serious threat to health for people who consume rice as a staple food. The development of elite rice cultivars with consistently low Cd content is challenging for conventional breeding approaches, and new strategies urgently need to be developed. Here, we report the development of new indica rice lines with low Cd accumulation and no transgenes by knocking out the metal transporter gene OsNramp5 using CRISPR/Cas9 system. Hydroponic culture showed that Cd concentrations in shoots and roots of osnramp5 mutants were dramatically decreased, resulting in rescue of impaired growth in high Cd condition. Cd-contaminated paddy field trials demonstrated that Cd concentration in osnramp5 grains was consistently less than 0.05<U+2009>mg/kg, in contrast to high Cd concentrations from 0.33<U+2009>mg/kg to 2.90<U+2009>mg/kg in grains of Huazhan (the wild-type indica rice). In particular, the plant yield was not significantly affected in osnramp5 mutants. Furthermore, we developed promising hybrid rice lines with extremely low Cd content in grains. Our work supplies a practical approach to developing Cd pollution-safe indica rice cultivars that minimizes Cd contamination risk in grains.
NA	Mutation at Different Sites of Metal Transporter Gene OsNramp5 Affects Cd Accumulation and Related Agronomic Traits in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2019	Front Plant Sci	College of Agronomy, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, China.	OsNramp5 is a key gene involved in the control of the uptake of Cd, Mn, and other metal ions by rice root cells. The functional deficiency of this gene can significantly reduce the accumulation of Cd in rice grains, but the effects of its mutation on agronomic traits such as yield and quality have not been investigated comprehensively yet. In the present study, three Huanghuazhan-based OsNramp5 mutants [LCH1 (Low Cadmium Huanghuazhan 1), LCH2 (Low Cadmium Huanghuazhan 2), and LCH3 (Low Cadmium Huanghuazhan 3)] were obtained using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology. The mutation-type analysis showed that LCH1, LCH2, and LCH3 encoded defective OsNramp5 protein sequences containing only 76aa, 176aa, and 266aa, respectively. The determination of metal content and the statistics of related agronomic traits revealed that the functionally deficient OsNramp5 not only significantly reduced the accumulation of Cd in the grains of the mutants but also affected rice yield and quality. However, with the decrease of OsNramp5 mutation degree, its effects on chlorenchyma Mn accumulation, yield, and quality were also diminished. Additionally, we also found that the increase in the concentration of Mn in the soil restored the phenotype of the declined yield and quality due to the functional deficiency of OsNramp5. Our findings provide novel insights into and new materials for breeding rice varieties with low Cd accumulation and excellent agronomic traits under severe Cd pollution environment.
NA	Altered root structure affects both expression and cellular localization of transporters for mineral element uptake in rice.	2019	Plant Cell Physiol	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Chuo 2-20-1, Kurashiki, Japan.	One of the most important roles of plant roots is to take up mineral elements for their growth. Although several genes involved in root growth have been identified, the association between root structure and mineral element uptake is less investigated. Here, we isolated a rice mutant (dice1, defective in cell elongation 1) with short root phenotype. This mutant was characterized by partial defect in the formation of root outer cell layers. Mapping of the responsible gene revealed that the short-root phenotype in the mutant was caused by a single nucleotide substitution of a gene encoding a membrane-anchored endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (OsGlu3). The growth of both the roots and shoots was partially recovered with increasing strength of nutrient solution and glucose in the mutant. The mutant showed a decreased uptake (normalized by root dry weight) for Mg, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, As and Ge, but increased uptake for K and Ca. The expression level of some transporter genes including OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 for Si uptake and OsNramp5 for Mn uptake was significantly decreased in the mutant compared with the wild-type rice. Furthermore, the cellular localization of OsLsi1 was altered; OsLsi1 localized at the root exodermis of the wild-type rice was changed to be localized to other cell layers of the mutant roots. However, this localization became normal in the presence of exogenous glucose in the mutant. Our results indicate that a normal root structure is required for maintaining the expression and localization of transporters involved in the mineral element uptake.
NA	Effects of external Mn2+ activities on OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation in indica rice.	2020	Environ Pollut	State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.	Manganese (Mn) transporter OsNRAMP5 was widely reported to regulate cadmium (Cd) uptake in rice. However, the relationship between OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation, impacts of external ion activities on OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation are still unclear. Investigations of the relationship between OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation in three indica rice genotypes were conducted under various external Mn2+ activities ranging from Mn deficiency to toxicity in EGTA-buffered nutrient solution. Results in this work indicated that OsNRAMP5 expression level in roots significantly up-regulated at Mn phytotoxicity compared to that at Mn deficiency, which may stimulate by the increasing uptake of Mn. Our work also demonstrated that root Cd concentration of all the tested rice decreased notably when external Mn2+ activity reached the level of toxicity. This may explain by the increasing competition between the excess Mn2+ and Cd2+ as well as the disorder of element absorption caused by root damage at Mn toxicity. Our work also revealed that the relationship between OsNRAMP5 expression level in roots and Cd accumulation in roots was insignificant for all the tested genotypes. Besides, OsNRAMP5 expression level in roots seemed more related to root Mn accumulation. The fact that function of OsNRAMP5 mainly focuses on Mn uptake, together with the fact that many transporter genes involved in Cd uptake might result in the insignificant correlation between OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation in roots. At last, multi-level regulating and processing of the process from gene expression to protein translation might account for the inconsistent relationship between root OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation in roots.
NA	Overexpression of the manganese/cadmium transporter OsNRAMP5 reduces cadmium accumulation in rice grain	2020	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Rice is a major dietary source of the toxic metal cadmium (Cd). Reducing Cd accumulation in rice grain is important for food safety. We generated transgenic rice in two cultivars overexpressing OsNRAMP5, encoding a major influx transporter for manganese (Mn) and Cd, under the control of the OsActin1 or maize Ubiquitin promoter, and tested the effect on Cd uptake and translocation. Overexpression of OsNRAMP5 increased Cd and Mn uptake into the roots, but decreased Cd accumulation in the shoots markedly, and had a relatively small effect on Mn accumulation in the shoots. Overexpressed OsNRAMP5 protein was localized to the plasma membrane of all cell types in the root tips and lateral root primordia without polarity. Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence mapping showed that the overexpression lines accumulated more Cd in the root tips and lateral root primordia compared with wild type. When grown in three Cd-contaminated paddy soils, OsNRAMP5 overexpression decreased grain Cd concentration by 49-94% compared with wild type. Overexpression of OsNRAMP5 decreased Cd translocation from roots to shoots by disrupting radial transport of Cd into the stele for xylem loading, demonstrating the effect of transporter localization and polarity on ion homeostasis. 
NA	Calcium Plays a Double-Edged Role in Modulating Cadmium Uptake and Translocation in Rice	2020	Int J Mol Sci	Collaborative Innovation Centre for Grain Industry, College of Agriculture, Yangtze University, Jingzhou 434025, China.	Cadmium (Cd) contamination in soils poses great risks to both agricultural production and human health. Calcium (Ca) is an essential element playing a significant role in protecting plants against Cd toxicity. However, how Ca affects Cd uptake and translocation in rice is still not fully elucidated. In this study, the regulatory role of Ca in Cd uptake and upward translocation was investigated in rice at different growth stages. Our results showed that the supplement of 5 mM Ca significantly reduced Cd uptake by rice roots, because of their competition for Ca-permeable channels as an absorption site and Ca-induced downregulation of OsNRAMP1 and OsNRAMP5. However, Ca application facilitated the upward translocation of Cd by both upregulating OsHMA2 to induce xylem loading of Cd and downregulating OsHMA3 to reduce vacuolar sequestration of Cd. Such contrary results suggested a double-edged role of Ca in regulating root Cd uptake and root-to-shoot Cd translocation in rice. Although it increased Cd content in the aboveground vegetative tissues during the whole growth period, the addition of 5 mM Ca eventually decreased Cd content in rice grains at the ripening stage. All these results suggest that Ca-based amendments possess great potential for the production of low-Cd rice grains.
NA	Effects of Fe and Mn cations on Cd uptake by rice plant in hydroponic culture experiment	2020	PLoS One	Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) are nutritional components of rice, plays an important role in its physiological processes and can minimize absorption of cadmium (Cd) in rice. Fe, Mn, and Cd transporters such as CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, OsHMA3, and OsNAAT1 regulate uptake of Cd in rice. However, the effect of exogenous application of Fe, and Mn on the accumulation of Cd and relative expression (RE) of these transporters in rice has not been investigated. Therefore, a hydroponic culture experiment was conducted to investigate the impact of Fe and Mn on Cd uptake and RE of these transporters in rice. The results showed that the Fe and Mn application significantly decreased Cd in the roots and shoots of rice. Whereas, Cd concentration in the rice significantly increased with increasing Cd concentration in the solution. The addition of manganese in the culture medium can reduce the cadmium content of rice roots by 11.9-82.3% and shoots by 11.6-85.0%, while the addition of iron in the culture medium can reduce the cadmium content of rice roots and shoots by 26-65% and 9-683% respectively. Meanwhile, application of sufficient doses of Fe and Cd in solution culture increased RE of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, and OsNAAT1 in roots, whereas expression level of OsHMA3 was decreased. Similarly, expression level of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, and OsNRAMP1 significantly increased in roots in high Cd and Mn deficient treatments. This may be concluded that the Cd increases expression of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, and OsNAAT1 but decreases OsHMA3 expression in rice roots, which resulted in increased Cd uptake in hydroponically grown rice.
