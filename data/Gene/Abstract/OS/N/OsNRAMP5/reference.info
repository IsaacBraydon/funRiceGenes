Ishimaru-2012-Characterizing the r.pdf	Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport	2012	Sci Rep	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan	Metals like manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) are essential for metabolism, while cadmium (Cd) is toxic for virtually all living organisms. Understanding the transport of these metals is important for breeding better crops. We have identified that OsNRAMP5 contributes to Mn, Fe and Cd transport in rice. OsNRAMP5 expression was restricted to roots epidermis, exodermis, and outer layers of the cortex as well as in tissues around the xylem. OsNRAMP5 localized to the plasma membrane, and complemented the growth of yeast strains defective in Mn, Fe, and Cd transport. OsNRAMP5 RNAi (OsNRAMP5i) plants accumulated less Mn in the roots, and less Mn and Fe in shoots, and xylem sap. The suppression of OsNRAMP5 promoted Cd translocation to shoots, highlighting the importance of this gene for Cd phytoremediation. These data reveal that OsNRAMP5 contributes to Mn, Cd, and Fe transport in rice and is important for plant growth and development.
PNAS-2012-Ishikawa-1211132109.pdf	Ion-beam irradiation, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in the development of low-cadmium rice	2012	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Soil Environment Division, National Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8604, Japan. isatoru@affrc.go.jp	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) grain is a major dietary source of cadmium (Cd), which is toxic to humans, but no practical technique exists to substantially reduce Cd contamination. Carbon ion-beam irradiation produced three rice mutants with <0.05 mg Cdkg(-1) in the grain compared with a mean of 1.73 mg Cdkg(-1) in the parent, Koshihikari. We identified the gene responsible for reduced Cd uptake and developed a strategy for marker-assisted selection of low-Cd cultivars. Sequence analysis revealed that these mutants have different mutations of the same gene (OsNRAMP5), which encodes a natural resistance-associated macrophage protein. Functional analysis revealed that the defective transporter protein encoded by the mutant osnramp5 greatly decreases Cd uptake by roots, resulting in decreased Cd in the straw and grain. In addition, we developed DNA markers to facilitate marker-assisted selection of cultivars carrying osnramp5. When grown in Cd-contaminated paddy fields, the mutants have nearly undetectable Cd in their grains and exhibit no agriculturally or economically adverse traits. Because mutants produced by ion-beam radiation are not transgenic plants, they are likely to be accepted by consumers and thus represent a practical choice for rice production worldwide.
NA	Knockout of OsNramp5 using the CRISPR/Cas9 system produces low Cd-accumulating indica rice without compromising yield.	2017	Sci Rep	Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Phytohormones and Growth Development, College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China.	Rice grain with excessive cadmium (Cd) is a major source of dietary Cd intake and a serious threat to health for people who consume rice as a staple food. The development of elite rice cultivars with consistently low Cd content is challenging for conventional breeding approaches, and new strategies urgently need to be developed. Here, we report the development of new indica rice lines with low Cd accumulation and no transgenes by knocking out the metal transporter gene OsNramp5 using CRISPR/Cas9 system. Hydroponic culture showed that Cd concentrations in shoots and roots of osnramp5 mutants were dramatically decreased, resulting in rescue of impaired growth in high Cd condition. Cd-contaminated paddy field trials demonstrated that Cd concentration in osnramp5 grains was consistently less than 0.05<U+2009>mg/kg, in contrast to high Cd concentrations from 0.33<U+2009>mg/kg to 2.90<U+2009>mg/kg in grains of Huazhan (the wild-type indica rice). In particular, the plant yield was not significantly affected in osnramp5 mutants. Furthermore, we developed promising hybrid rice lines with extremely low Cd content in grains. Our work supplies a practical approach to developing Cd pollution-safe indica rice cultivars that minimizes Cd contamination risk in grains.
NA	Mutation at Different Sites of Metal Transporter Gene OsNramp5 Affects Cd Accumulation and Related Agronomic Traits in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2019	Front Plant Sci	College of Agronomy, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, China.	OsNramp5 is a key gene involved in the control of the uptake of Cd, Mn, and other metal ions by rice root cells. The functional deficiency of this gene can significantly reduce the accumulation of Cd in rice grains, but the effects of its mutation on agronomic traits such as yield and quality have not been investigated comprehensively yet. In the present study, three Huanghuazhan-based OsNramp5 mutants [LCH1 (Low Cadmium Huanghuazhan 1), LCH2 (Low Cadmium Huanghuazhan 2), and LCH3 (Low Cadmium Huanghuazhan 3)] were obtained using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology. The mutation-type analysis showed that LCH1, LCH2, and LCH3 encoded defective OsNramp5 protein sequences containing only 76aa, 176aa, and 266aa, respectively. The determination of metal content and the statistics of related agronomic traits revealed that the functionally deficient OsNramp5 not only significantly reduced the accumulation of Cd in the grains of the mutants but also affected rice yield and quality. However, with the decrease of OsNramp5 mutation degree, its effects on chlorenchyma Mn accumulation, yield, and quality were also diminished. Additionally, we also found that the increase in the concentration of Mn in the soil restored the phenotype of the declined yield and quality due to the functional deficiency of OsNramp5. Our findings provide novel insights into and new materials for breeding rice varieties with low Cd accumulation and excellent agronomic traits under severe Cd pollution environment.
NA	Altered root structure affects both expression and cellular localization of transporters for mineral element uptake in rice.	2019	Plant Cell Physiol	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Chuo 2-20-1, Kurashiki, Japan.	One of the most important roles of plant roots is to take up mineral elements for their growth. Although several genes involved in root growth have been identified, the association between root structure and mineral element uptake is less investigated. Here, we isolated a rice mutant (dice1, defective in cell elongation 1) with short root phenotype. This mutant was characterized by partial defect in the formation of root outer cell layers. Mapping of the responsible gene revealed that the short-root phenotype in the mutant was caused by a single nucleotide substitution of a gene encoding a membrane-anchored endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (OsGlu3). The growth of both the roots and shoots was partially recovered with increasing strength of nutrient solution and glucose in the mutant. The mutant showed a decreased uptake (normalized by root dry weight) for Mg, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, As and Ge, but increased uptake for K and Ca. The expression level of some transporter genes including OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 for Si uptake and OsNramp5 for Mn uptake was significantly decreased in the mutant compared with the wild-type rice. Furthermore, the cellular localization of OsLsi1 was altered; OsLsi1 localized at the root exodermis of the wild-type rice was changed to be localized to other cell layers of the mutant roots. However, this localization became normal in the presence of exogenous glucose in the mutant. Our results indicate that a normal root structure is required for maintaining the expression and localization of transporters involved in the mineral element uptake.
NA	Effects of external Mn2+ activities on OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation in indica rice.	2020	Environ Pollut	State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.	Manganese (Mn) transporter OsNRAMP5 was widely reported to regulate cadmium (Cd) uptake in rice. However, the relationship between OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation, impacts of external ion activities on OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation are still unclear. Investigations of the relationship between OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation in three indica rice genotypes were conducted under various external Mn2+ activities ranging from Mn deficiency to toxicity in EGTA-buffered nutrient solution. Results in this work indicated that OsNRAMP5 expression level in roots significantly up-regulated at Mn phytotoxicity compared to that at Mn deficiency, which may stimulate by the increasing uptake of Mn. Our work also demonstrated that root Cd concentration of all the tested rice decreased notably when external Mn2+ activity reached the level of toxicity. This may explain by the increasing competition between the excess Mn2+ and Cd2+ as well as the disorder of element absorption caused by root damage at Mn toxicity. Our work also revealed that the relationship between OsNRAMP5 expression level in roots and Cd accumulation in roots was insignificant for all the tested genotypes. Besides, OsNRAMP5 expression level in roots seemed more related to root Mn accumulation. The fact that function of OsNRAMP5 mainly focuses on Mn uptake, together with the fact that many transporter genes involved in Cd uptake might result in the insignificant correlation between OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation in roots. At last, multi-level regulating and processing of the process from gene expression to protein translation might account for the inconsistent relationship between root OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation in roots.
NA	Overexpression of the manganese/cadmium transporter OsNRAMP5 reduces cadmium accumulation in rice grain	2020	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Rice is a major dietary source of the toxic metal cadmium (Cd). Reducing Cd accumulation in rice grain is important for food safety. We generated transgenic rice in two cultivars overexpressing OsNRAMP5, encoding a major influx transporter for manganese (Mn) and Cd, under the control of the OsActin1 or maize Ubiquitin promoter, and tested the effect on Cd uptake and translocation. Overexpression of OsNRAMP5 increased Cd and Mn uptake into the roots, but decreased Cd accumulation in the shoots markedly, and had a relatively small effect on Mn accumulation in the shoots. Overexpressed OsNRAMP5 protein was localized to the plasma membrane of all cell types in the root tips and lateral root primordia without polarity. Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence mapping showed that the overexpression lines accumulated more Cd in the root tips and lateral root primordia compared with wild type. When grown in three Cd-contaminated paddy soils, OsNRAMP5 overexpression decreased grain Cd concentration by 49-94% compared with wild type. Overexpression of OsNRAMP5 decreased Cd translocation from roots to shoots by disrupting radial transport of Cd into the stele for xylem loading, demonstrating the effect of transporter localization and polarity on ion homeostasis. 
NA	Calcium Plays a Double-Edged Role in Modulating Cadmium Uptake and Translocation in Rice	2020	Int J Mol Sci	Collaborative Innovation Centre for Grain Industry, College of Agriculture, Yangtze University, Jingzhou 434025, China.	Cadmium (Cd) contamination in soils poses great risks to both agricultural production and human health. Calcium (Ca) is an essential element playing a significant role in protecting plants against Cd toxicity. However, how Ca affects Cd uptake and translocation in rice is still not fully elucidated. In this study, the regulatory role of Ca in Cd uptake and upward translocation was investigated in rice at different growth stages. Our results showed that the supplement of 5 mM Ca significantly reduced Cd uptake by rice roots, because of their competition for Ca-permeable channels as an absorption site and Ca-induced downregulation of OsNRAMP1 and OsNRAMP5. However, Ca application facilitated the upward translocation of Cd by both upregulating OsHMA2 to induce xylem loading of Cd and downregulating OsHMA3 to reduce vacuolar sequestration of Cd. Such contrary results suggested a double-edged role of Ca in regulating root Cd uptake and root-to-shoot Cd translocation in rice. Although it increased Cd content in the aboveground vegetative tissues during the whole growth period, the addition of 5 mM Ca eventually decreased Cd content in rice grains at the ripening stage. All these results suggest that Ca-based amendments possess great potential for the production of low-Cd rice grains.
NA	Effects of Fe and Mn cations on Cd uptake by rice plant in hydroponic culture experiment	2020	PLoS One	Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) are nutritional components of rice, plays an important role in its physiological processes and can minimize absorption of cadmium (Cd) in rice. Fe, Mn, and Cd transporters such as CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, OsHMA3, and OsNAAT1 regulate uptake of Cd in rice. However, the effect of exogenous application of Fe, and Mn on the accumulation of Cd and relative expression (RE) of these transporters in rice has not been investigated. Therefore, a hydroponic culture experiment was conducted to investigate the impact of Fe and Mn on Cd uptake and RE of these transporters in rice. The results showed that the Fe and Mn application significantly decreased Cd in the roots and shoots of rice. Whereas, Cd concentration in the rice significantly increased with increasing Cd concentration in the solution. The addition of manganese in the culture medium can reduce the cadmium content of rice roots by 11.9-82.3% and shoots by 11.6-85.0%, while the addition of iron in the culture medium can reduce the cadmium content of rice roots and shoots by 26-65% and 9-683% respectively. Meanwhile, application of sufficient doses of Fe and Cd in solution culture increased RE of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, and OsNAAT1 in roots, whereas expression level of OsHMA3 was decreased. Similarly, expression level of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, and OsNRAMP1 significantly increased in roots in high Cd and Mn deficient treatments. This may be concluded that the Cd increases expression of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, and OsNAAT1 but decreases OsHMA3 expression in rice roots, which resulted in increased Cd uptake in hydroponically grown rice.
NA	Univariate and Multivariate QTL Analyses Reveal Covariance Among Mineral Elements in the Rice Ionome	2021	Front Genet	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Rice provides more than one fifth of daily calories for half of the world's human population, and is a major dietary source of both essential mineral nutrients and toxic elements. Rice grains are generally poor in some essential nutrients but may contain unsafe levels of some toxic elements under certain conditions. Identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling the concentrations of mineral nutrients and toxic trace metals (the ionome) in rice will facilitate development of nutritionally improved rice varieties. However, QTL analyses have traditionally considered each element separately without considering their interrelatedness. In this study, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate QTL analyses to identify the genetic loci controlling the covariance among mineral elements in the rice ionome. We resequenced the whole genomes of a rice recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, and performed univariate and multivariate QTL analyses for the concentrations of 16 elements in grains, shoots and roots of the RIL population grown in different conditions. We identified a total of 167 unique elemental QTLs based on analyses of individual elemental concentrations as separate traits, 53 QTLs controlling covariance among elemental concentrations within a single environment/tissue (PC-QTLs), and 152 QTLs which determined covariation among elements across environments/tissues (aPC-QTLs). The candidate genes underlying the QTL clusters with elemental QTLs, PC-QTLs and aPC-QTLs co-localized were identified, including OsHMA4 and OsNRAMP5. The identification of both elemental QTLs and PC QTLs will facilitate the cloning of underlying causal genes and the dissection of the complex regulation of the ionome in rice.
NA	Knockout of OsNRAMP5 enhances rice tolerance to cadmium toxicity in response to varying external cadmium concentrations via distinct mechanisms.	2022	Sci Total Environ	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Center, Changsha 410125, China; Longping Branch of Graduate School, Hunan University, Changsha 410125, China.	OsNRAMP5 is a transporter responsible for cadmium (Cd) and manganese (Mn) uptake and root-to-shoot translocation of Mn in rice plants. Knockout of OsNRAMP5 is regarded as an effective approach to minimize Cd uptake and accumulation in rice. It is vital to evaluate the effects of knocking out OsNRAMP5 on Cd and Mn accumulation, as well as Cd tolerance of rice plants in response to varying environmental Cd concentrations, and to uncover the underlying mechanism, which until now, has remained largely unexplored. This study showed that knockout of OsNRAMP5 decreased Cd uptake, but simultaneously facilitated Cd translocation from roots to shoots. The effect of OsNRAMP5 knockout on reducing root Cd uptake weakened, however its effect on improving root-to-shoot Cd translocation was constant with increasing environmental Cd concentrations. As a result, its mutation dramatically reduced Cd accumulation in shoots under low and moderate Cd stress, but inversely increased that under high Cd conditions. Interestingly, Cd tolerance of its knockout mutants was persistently enhanced, irrespective of lower or higher Cd concentrations in shoots, compared with that of wild-type plants. Knockout of OsNRAMP5 mitigated Cd toxicity by dramatically diminishing Cd uptake at low or moderate external Cd concentrations. Remarkably, its knockout effectively complemented deficient mineral nutrients in shoots, thereby indirectly enhancing rice tolerance to severe Cd stress. Additionally, its mutation conferred preferential delivery of Mn to young leaves and grains. These results have important implications for the application of the OsNRAMP5 mutation in mitigating Cd toxicity and lowering the risk of excessive Cd accumulation in rice grains.
NA	A weak allele of OsNRAMP5 confers moderate cadmium uptake while avoiding manganese deficiency in rice.	2022	J Exp Bot	Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, Japan.	Decreasing cadmium (Cd) concentrations in rice grains can effectively reduce potential risks to human health because rice is the major contributor to Cd intake in many diets. Among several genes involved in rice Cd accumulation, the loss of function of OsNRAMP5 is known to be effective in reducing grain concentration by inhibiting root uptake. However, disruption of this gene simultaneously decreases manganese (Mn) uptake because OsNRAMP5 is a major Mn transporter. With the aim of improving Mn uptake in OsNRAMP5 mutants while still restricting the grain Cd concentration below the upper limit of international standards, we identified a novel OsNRAMP5 allele encoding a protein in which glutamine (Q) at position 337 was replaced by lysine (K). The mutant carrying the OsNRAMP5-Q337K allele showed intermediate Cd and Mn accumulation between that of the wild-type and OsNRAMP5-knockout lines, and exhibited more resistance to Mn deficiency than the knockout lines. Different amino acid substitutions at position Q337 significantly affected the Cd and Mn transport activity in yeast cells, indicating that it is one of the crucial sites for OsNRAMP5 function. Our results suggest that the OsNRAMP5-Q337K allele might be useful for reducing grain Cd concentrations without causing severe Mn deficiency in rice cultivars through DNA marker-assisted breeding.
NA	OsNRAMP5 Is a Major Transporter for Lead Uptake in Rice.	2022	Environ Sci Technol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Lead (Pb) is one of the most toxic metals affecting human health globally. Food is an important source of chronic Pb exposure in humans. How Pb is taken up by rice, a staple food for over half of the global population, remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role of OsNRAMP5, a member of the NRAMP (Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein) transporter family, in Pb uptake by rice roots. Heterologous expression of OsNRAMP5 in yeast increased Pb uptake and sensitivity toward Pb. Knockout of OsNRAMP5 in rice by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing resulted in significant decreases in root uptake of Pb and accumulation in rice shoots. The maximum influx velocity (V(max)) for Pb uptake of the knockout mutants was 70% lower than that of wild-type plants. When grown in Pb-contaminated paddy soil, OsNRAMP5 knockout mutants accumulated approximately 50 and 70% lower Pb concentrations in the grain and straw, respectively, than the wild type. OsNRAMP5 expression in rice roots was not affected by Pb exposure. These results indicate that OsNRAMP5 is a major transporter for Pb uptake in rice, in addition to its role in the uptake of manganese and cadmium. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of Pb uptake in rice plants and a potential strategy to limit Pb accumulation in rice grains.
NA	Duplication of a manganese/cadmium transporter gene reduces cadmium accumulation in rice grain.	2022	Nat Food	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Kurashiki, Japan.	Global contamination of soils with toxic cadmium (Cd) is a serious health threat. Here we found that a tandem duplication of a gene encoding a manganese/Cd transporter, OsNramp5, was responsible for low-Cd accumulation in Pokkali, an old rice cultivar. This duplication doubled the expression of OsNramp5 gene but did not alter its spatial expression pattern and cellular localization. Higher expression of OsNramp5 increased uptake of Cd and Mn into the root cells but decreased Cd release to the xylem. Introgression of this allele into Koshihikari, an elite rice cultivar, through backcrossing significantly reduced Cd accumulation in the grain when cultivated in soil heavily contaminated with Cd but did not affect both grain yield and eating quality. This study not only reveals the molecular mechanism underlying low-Cd accumulation but also provides a useful target for breeding rice cultivars with low-Cd accumulation.
NA	Melatonin reduces cadmium accumulation via mediating the nitric oxide accumulation and increasing the cell wall fixation capacity of cadmium in rice.	2022	J Hazard Mater	State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Science, Nanjing 210008, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.	Melatonin (MT) is participated in plants&#x27; response to cadmium (Cd) tolerance, although its work model remains elusive. Here, the function of MT in adjusting Cd accumulation in rice was investigated. &#x27;Nipponbare&#x27; (Nip) was cultured in the -Cd (1/2 Kimura B), -Cd + MT (1/2 Kimura B with 1 μM MT), +Cd (1/2 Kimura B plus 1 μM Cd) and +Cd + MT (1/2 Kimura B with 1 μM Cd and 1 μM MT) nutrient solutions for 7 d. Cd markedly induced the endogenous MT accumulation in rice roots and shoots, even within 1 h. MT applied exogenously elevated the hemicelluloses level, which in turn increased the cell wall&#x27;s binding capacity to Cd. Furthermore, MT applied exogenously down-regulated the transcription level of Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein 1 (OsNRAMP1), OsNRAMP5, a major facilitator superfamily gene (OsCd1), and IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER 1 (OsIRT1), all of which were responsible for Cd intake, thus less Cd was entered into roots. Moreover, MT applied exogenously also up-regulated transcription level of Cadmium accumulation in Leaf 1 (OsCAL1) and Heavy Metal ATPase 3 (OsHMA3), two genes both attributed to the decreased Cd accumulation in shoots through expelling Cd out of cells and chelating Cd in the vacuoles, respectively. In addition, MT applied exogenously further aggravated the production of nitric oxide (NO) that induced by Cd, while application of a NO donor-SNP mimicked this alleviatory effect of the MT, indicating MT decreased rice Cd accumulation relied on the accumulation of NO.
