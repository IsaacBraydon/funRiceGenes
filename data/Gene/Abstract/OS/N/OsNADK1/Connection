OsNADK1	OsWRKY42|WRKY42	The NAD kinase OsNADK1 affects the intracellular redox balance and enhances the tolerance of rice to drought.	, OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY42, showed correlated co-expression patterns with OsNADK1 in osnadk1 and the plants overexpressing or underexpressing OsNADK1, implying roles for these transcription factors in OsNADK1-mediated processes
