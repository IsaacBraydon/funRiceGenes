GW7|GL7|SLG7	OsNF-YC10	OsNF-YC10, a seed preferentially expressed gene regulates grain width by affecting cell proliferation in rice.	 OsNF-YC10 was further revealed to influence the expression of GW8 (a positive regulator of grain width), GW7 (a negative regulator of grain width) and cell cycle-regulated genes CYCD4, CYCA2
