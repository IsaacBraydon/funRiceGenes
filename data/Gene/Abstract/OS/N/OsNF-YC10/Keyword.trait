OsNF-YC10	spikelet	OsNF-YC10, a seed preferentially expressed gene regulates grain width by affecting cell proliferation in rice.	 qRT-PCR and mRNA in situ hybridization analysis revealed that OsNF-YC10 was highly expressed in endosperm and spikelet hull at late developmental stages
OsNF-YC10	spikelet	OsNF-YC10, a seed preferentially expressed gene regulates grain width by affecting cell proliferation in rice.	 Cytological experiments revealed significantly reduced cell number of spikelet hull in osnf-yc10 lines compared with that in WT
OsNF-YC10	spikelet	OsNF-YC10, a seed preferentially expressed gene regulates grain width by affecting cell proliferation in rice.	 Taken together, it is suggested that OsNF-YC10 regulates the grains size and shape by influencing the cell proliferation of spikelet hulls
OsNF-YC10	grain	OsNF-YC10, a seed preferentially expressed gene regulates grain width by affecting cell proliferation in rice.	 These results indicated that OsNF-YC10 plays an important role in determining grain size and shape
OsNF-YC10	grain	OsNF-YC10, a seed preferentially expressed gene regulates grain width by affecting cell proliferation in rice.	 OsNF-YC10 was further revealed to influence the expression of GW8 (a positive regulator of grain width), GW7 (a negative regulator of grain width) and cell cycle-regulated genes CYCD4, CYCA2
OsNF-YC10	grain size	OsNF-YC10, a seed preferentially expressed gene regulates grain width by affecting cell proliferation in rice.	 These results indicated that OsNF-YC10 plays an important role in determining grain size and shape
OsNF-YC10	endosperm	OsNF-YC10, a seed preferentially expressed gene regulates grain width by affecting cell proliferation in rice.	 qRT-PCR and mRNA in situ hybridization analysis revealed that OsNF-YC10 was highly expressed in endosperm and spikelet hull at late developmental stages
OsNF-YC10	cell cycle	OsNF-YC10, a seed preferentially expressed gene regulates grain width by affecting cell proliferation in rice.	 OsNF-YC10 was further revealed to influence the expression of GW8 (a positive regulator of grain width), GW7 (a negative regulator of grain width) and cell cycle-regulated genes CYCD4, CYCA2
OsNF-YC10	R protein	OsNF-YC10, a seed preferentially expressed gene regulates grain width by affecting cell proliferation in rice.	 The results showed that OsNF-YC10 was a nuclear protein showing transcription activation activity
OsNF-YC10	cell proliferation	OsNF-YC10, a seed preferentially expressed gene regulates grain width by affecting cell proliferation in rice.	 Taken together, it is suggested that OsNF-YC10 regulates the grains size and shape by influencing the cell proliferation of spikelet hulls
OsNF-YC10	grain width	OsNF-YC10, a seed preferentially expressed gene regulates grain width by affecting cell proliferation in rice.	 OsNF-YC10 was further revealed to influence the expression of GW8 (a positive regulator of grain width), GW7 (a negative regulator of grain width) and cell cycle-regulated genes CYCD4, CYCA2
