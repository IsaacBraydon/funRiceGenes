OsNAAT1	OsNAAT2	Identification and localisation of the rice nicotianamine aminotransferase gene OsNAAT1 expression suggests the site of phytosiderophore synthesis in rice	Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis showed that OsNAAT1, but not OsNAAT2-6, was strongly up-regulated by Fe deficiency, both in roots and shoots
OsIRO2|OsbHLH056	OsNAAT1	A receptor-like protein RMC is involved in regulation of iron acquisition in rice	Several Fe deficiency-responsive genes including OsDMAS1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAAT1, OsIRT1, OsYSL15, and OsIRO2 were up- and downregulated in OsRMC-overexpressing and RNAi plants compared with WT rice plants
OsNAAT1	OsNAS1	A receptor-like protein RMC is involved in regulation of iron acquisition in rice	Several Fe deficiency-responsive genes including OsDMAS1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAAT1, OsIRT1, OsYSL15, and OsIRO2 were up- and downregulated in OsRMC-overexpressing and RNAi plants compared with WT rice plants
OsNAAT1	OsRMC|OsRLK	A receptor-like protein RMC is involved in regulation of iron acquisition in rice	Several Fe deficiency-responsive genes including OsDMAS1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAAT1, OsIRT1, OsYSL15, and OsIRO2 were up- and downregulated in OsRMC-overexpressing and RNAi plants compared with WT rice plants
OsNAAT1	OsYSL15	A receptor-like protein RMC is involved in regulation of iron acquisition in rice	Several Fe deficiency-responsive genes including OsDMAS1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAAT1, OsIRT1, OsYSL15, and OsIRO2 were up- and downregulated in OsRMC-overexpressing and RNAi plants compared with WT rice plants
OsIRT1	OsNAAT1	A receptor-like protein RMC is involved in regulation of iron acquisition in rice	Several Fe deficiency-responsive genes including OsDMAS1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAAT1, OsIRT1, OsYSL15, and OsIRO2 were up- and downregulated in OsRMC-overexpressing and RNAi plants compared with WT rice plants
OsNAAT1	OsNAS2	A receptor-like protein RMC is involved in regulation of iron acquisition in rice	Several Fe deficiency-responsive genes including OsDMAS1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAAT1, OsIRT1, OsYSL15, and OsIRO2 were up- and downregulated in OsRMC-overexpressing and RNAi plants compared with WT rice plants
OsNAAT1	OsNRAMP5	Effects of Fe and Mn cations on Cd uptake by rice plant in hydroponic culture experiment	 Fe, Mn, and Cd transporters such as CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, OsHMA3, and OsNAAT1 regulate uptake of Cd in rice
OsNAAT1	OsNRAMP5	Effects of Fe and Mn cations on Cd uptake by rice plant in hydroponic culture experiment	 Meanwhile, application of sufficient doses of Fe and Cd in solution culture increased RE of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, and OsNAAT1 in roots, whereas expression level of OsHMA3 was decreased
OsNAAT1	OsNRAMP5	Effects of Fe and Mn cations on Cd uptake by rice plant in hydroponic culture experiment	 This may be concluded that the Cd increases expression of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, and OsNAAT1 but decreases OsHMA3 expression in rice roots, which resulted in increased Cd uptake in hydroponically grown rice
OsNAAT1	OsNRAMP1	Effects of Fe and Mn cations on Cd uptake by rice plant in hydroponic culture experiment	 Fe, Mn, and Cd transporters such as CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, OsHMA3, and OsNAAT1 regulate uptake of Cd in rice
