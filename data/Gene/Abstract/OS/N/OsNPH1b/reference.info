NA	Rice NPH1 homologues, OsNPH1a and OsNPH1b, are differently photoregulated.	2000	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Molecular Genetics, National Institute of Agrobiological Resources, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	The members of nonphototropic hypocotyl 1 (NPH1) family of genes in plants are considered to be the blue-light photoreceptors for phototropism. We isolated and characterized two NPH1 homologues from rice named as OsNPH1a and OsNPH1b. The predicted proteins of both OsNPH1 genes include LOV (LOV1 and LOV2) and protein kinase domains which are typically conserved regions in all the members of NPH1 family. Comparison of OsNPH1 apoproteins with those from other plant species revealed a close homology of OsNPHla with Arabidopsis, maize and oat NPH1, while the OsNPH1b appeared to be more closer to the recently found Arabidopsis NPL1. These structural homologies indicate that NPH1 homologues can be grouped into two classes namely &quot;NPH1 type&quot; and &quot;NPL1 type&quot;. Northern blot analysis showed that OsNPH1a was strongly expressed in coleoptiles, whereas OsNPH1b was highly expressed in leaves of dark-grown rice seedlings. When the dark-grown seedlings were transferred to the continuous white light, the abundance of the OsNPH1a transcript in coleoptiles rapidly declined to the minimum levels, whereas the OsNPH1b transcript level in leaves gradually increased. These results lead us to conclude that expression of OsNPH1a and OsNPH1b is differently photoregulated in different tissues of rice seedlings.
NA	Formin protein DRT1 affects gross morphology and chloroplast relocation in rice.	2022	Plant Physiol	College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, 310036, China.	Plant height and tiller number are two major factors determining plant architecture and yield. However, in rice (Oryza sativa), the regulatory mechanism of plant architecture remains to be elucidated. Here, we reported a recessive rice mutant presenting dwarf and reduced tillering phenotypes (drt1). Map-based cloning revealed that the phenotypes are caused by a single point mutation in DRT1, which encodes the Class I formin protein O. sativa formin homolog 13 (OsFH13), binds with F-actin, and promotes actin polymerization for microfilament organization. DRT1 protein localized on the plasma membrane (PM) and chloroplast (CP) outer envelope. DRT1 interacted with rice phototropin 2 (OsPHOT2), and the interaction was interrupted in drt1. Upon blue light stimulus, PM localized DRT1 and OsPHOT2 were translocated onto the CP membrane. Moreover, deficiency of DRT1 reduced OsPHOT2 internalization and OsPHOT2-mediated CP relocation. Our study suggests that rice formin protein DRT1/OsFH13 is necessary for plant morphology and CP relocation by modulating the actin-associated cytoskeleton network.
