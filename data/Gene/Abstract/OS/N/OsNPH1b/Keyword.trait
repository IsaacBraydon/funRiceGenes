OsNPH1b	seedlings	Rice NPH1 homologues, OsNPH1a and OsNPH1b, are differently photoregulated.	Northern blot analysis showed that OsNPH1a was strongly expressed in coleoptiles, whereas OsNPH1b was highly expressed in leaves of dark-grown rice seedlings
OsNPH1b	seedlings	Rice NPH1 homologues, OsNPH1a and OsNPH1b, are differently photoregulated.	When the dark-grown seedlings were transferred to the continuous white light, the abundance of the OsNPH1a transcript in coleoptiles rapidly declined to the minimum levels, whereas the OsNPH1b transcript level in leaves gradually increased
OsNPH1b	seedlings	Rice NPH1 homologues, OsNPH1a and OsNPH1b, are differently photoregulated.	These results lead us to conclude that expression of OsNPH1a and OsNPH1b is differently photoregulated in different tissues of rice seedlings
