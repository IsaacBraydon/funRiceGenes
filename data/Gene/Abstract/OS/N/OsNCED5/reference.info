MYB-type transcription factors (TFs) play essential roles in plant growth, development and respond to environmental stresses. Role of MYB-related TFs of rice in drought stress tolerance is not well documented. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel MYB-related TF, OsMYB48-1, of rice. Expression of OsMYB48-1 was strongly induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG), abscisic acid (ABA), H2O2, and dehydration, while being slightly induced by high salinity and cold treatment. The OsMYB48-1 protein was localized in the nucleus with transactivation activity at the C terminus. Overexpression of OsMYB48-1 in rice significantly improved tolerance to simulated drought and salinity stresses caused by mannitol, PEG, and NaCl, respectively, and drought stress was caused by drying the soil. In contrast to wild type plants, the overexpression lines exhibited reduced rate of water loss, lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content and higher proline content under stress conditions. Moreover, overexpression plants were hypersensitive to ABA at both germination and post-germination stages and accumulated more endogenous ABA under drought stress conditions. Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of OsMYB48-1 could regulate the expression of some ABA biosynthesis genes (OsNCED4, OsNCED5), early signaling genes (OsPP2C68, OSRK1) and late responsive genes (RAB21, OsLEA3, RAB16C and RAB16D) under drought stress conditions. Collectively, these results suggested that OsMYB48-1 functions as a novel MYB-related TF which plays a positive role in drought and salinity tolerance by regulating stress-induced ABA synthesis.
Plant Cell Physiol-2009-Zhu-644-51.pdf	Glucose-induced delay of seed germination in rice is mediated by the suppression of ABA catabolism rather than an enhancement of ABA biosynthesis	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	College of Life Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangdong, PR China.	Both glucose and ABA play crucial roles in the regulation of seed germination and post-germination development. In Arabidopsis thaliana, up-regulation of ABA biosynthesis is suggested as one of the possible mechanisms mediating the glucose-induced delay in seed germination. Since the endogenous ABA level is controlled by the equilibrium between ABA biosynthesis and catabolism, we investigated how this equilibrium is related to the regulation of seed germination by glucose in rice. When ABA biosynthesis was inhibited by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), an inhibitor of the ABA anabolic enzyme 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), rice seed germination showed no response. In contrast, inhibition of ABA catabolism by diniconazole significantly arrested seed germination, suggesting that the regulation of ABA catabolism plays a major role. Further experiments indicated that the expression of OsABA8ox3, a key gene in ABA catabolism and encoding ABA 8'-hydroxylase in rice, was significantly increased during the first 6 h of imbibition, which was consistent with the decline of ABA content in the imbibed seeds. Expression of OsABA8ox genes, especially OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3, was sensitively suppressed in the presence of exogenously supplied glucose. In contrast, the expression profiles of OsNCED genes that control the limiting step of ABA biosynthesis showed no significant changes in response to low levels of glucose. Our results demonstrated that the glucose-induced delay of seed germination is a result of the suppression of ABA catabolism rather than any enhancement of ABA biosynthesis during rice seed germination.
NA	OsNCED5, a 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase gene, regulates salt and water stress tolerance and leaf senescence in rice.	2019	Plant Sci	Hunan Province Key Laboratory of Crop Sterile Germplasm Resource Innovation and Application, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, 410081, PR China.	9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) is a rate-limiting enzyme for abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis. However, the molecular mechanisms of NCED5 that modulate plant development and abiotic stress tolerance are still unclear, particular in rice. Here, we demonstrate that a rice NCED gene, OsNCED5, was expressed in all tissues we tested, and was induced by exposure to salt stress, water stress, and darkness. Mutational analysis showed that nced5 mutants reduced ABA level and decreased tolerance to salt and water stress and delayed leaf senescence. However, OsNCED5 overexpression increased ABA level, enhanced tolerance to the stresses, and accelerated leaf senescence. Transcript analysis showed that OsNCED5 regulated ABA-dependent abiotic stress and senescence-related gene expression. Additionally, ectopic expression of OsNCED5 tested in Arabidopsis thaliana altered plant size and leaf morphology and delayed seed germination and flowering time. Thus, OsNCED5 may regulate plant development and stress resistance through control of ABA biosynthesis. These findings contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which NCED regulates plant development and responses to abiotic stress in different crop species.
