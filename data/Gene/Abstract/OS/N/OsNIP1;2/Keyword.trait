OsNIP1;2	root	The plasma membrane-localized OsNIP1;2 mediates internal aluminum detoxification in rice.	 Aluminum stress specifically and quickly induced OsNIP1;2 expression in the root
OsNIP1;2	root	The plasma membrane-localized OsNIP1;2 mediates internal aluminum detoxification in rice.	 Moreover, the Osnip1;2 mutants had considerably more Al accumulated in the root cell wall but less in the cytosol than the wild-type rice
OsNIP1;2	root	The plasma membrane-localized OsNIP1;2 mediates internal aluminum detoxification in rice.	 In addition, compared with the wild-type rice plants, the Osnip1;2 mutants contained more Al in the root but less in the shoot
OsNIP1;2	root	The plasma membrane-localized OsNIP1;2 mediates internal aluminum detoxification in rice.	 These results suggest that OsNIP1;2 confers internal Al detoxification via taking out the root cell wall&#x27;s Al, sequestering it to the root cell&#x27;s vacuole, and re-distributing it to the above-ground tissues
OsNIP1;2	shoot	The plasma membrane-localized OsNIP1;2 mediates internal aluminum detoxification in rice.	 In addition, compared with the wild-type rice plants, the Osnip1;2 mutants contained more Al in the root but less in the shoot
OsNIP1;2	stress	The plasma membrane-localized OsNIP1;2 mediates internal aluminum detoxification in rice.	 Aluminum stress specifically and quickly induced OsNIP1;2 expression in the root
OsNIP1;2	aluminum	The plasma membrane-localized OsNIP1;2 mediates internal aluminum detoxification in rice.	The plasma membrane-localized OsNIP1;2 mediates internal aluminum detoxification in rice.
OsNIP1;2	aluminum	The plasma membrane-localized OsNIP1;2 mediates internal aluminum detoxification in rice.	 Aluminum stress specifically and quickly induced OsNIP1;2 expression in the root
OsNIP1;2	cell wall	The plasma membrane-localized OsNIP1;2 mediates internal aluminum detoxification in rice.	 Moreover, the Osnip1;2 mutants had considerably more Al accumulated in the root cell wall but less in the cytosol than the wild-type rice

OsNIP1;2	plasma membrane	The plasma membrane-localized OsNIP1;2 mediates internal aluminum detoxification in rice.	The plasma membrane-localized OsNIP1;2 mediates internal aluminum detoxification in rice.
OsNIP1;2	detoxification	The plasma membrane-localized OsNIP1;2 mediates internal aluminum detoxification in rice.	The plasma membrane-localized OsNIP1;2 mediates internal aluminum detoxification in rice.
OsNIP1;2	detoxification	The plasma membrane-localized OsNIP1;2 mediates internal aluminum detoxification in rice.	 These results suggest that OsNIP1;2 confers internal Al detoxification via taking out the root cell wall&#x27;s Al, sequestering it to the root cell&#x27;s vacuole, and re-distributing it to the above-ground tissues
OsNIP1;2	cytosol	The plasma membrane-localized OsNIP1;2 mediates internal aluminum detoxification in rice.	 Moreover, the Osnip1;2 mutants had considerably more Al accumulated in the root cell wall but less in the cytosol than the wild-type rice
