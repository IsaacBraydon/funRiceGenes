OsNLP4	nitrogen	Enhanced OsNLP4-OsNiR cascade confers nitrogen use efficiency by promoting tiller number in rice 	 We found that OsNLP4 transactivated OsNiR encoding nitrite reductase that was critical in nitrogen assimilation in rice
OsNLP4	yield	Rice NIN-LIKE PROTEIN 4 plays a pivotal role in nitrogen use efficiency	 In contrast, the OsNLP4 overexpression lines remarkably increased yield by 30% and NUE by 47% under moderate N level compared with wild type
OsNLP4	biomass	Rice NIN-LIKE PROTEIN 4 plays a pivotal role in nitrogen use efficiency	 Moreover, overexpression of OsNLP4 can recover the phenotype of Arabidopsis nlp7 mutant and enhance its biomass
