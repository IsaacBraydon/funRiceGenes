NA	Enhanced OsNLP4-OsNiR cascade confers nitrogen use efficiency by promoting tiller number in rice 	2020	Plant Biotechnol J.

Increased use of nitrogen fertilizers has deleterious impact on the environment. Increase in yield potential at low nitrogen supply is regarded as a cereal breeding goal for future agricultural sustainability. Although natural variations of nitrogen transporters have been investigated, key genes associated with assimilation remain largely unexplored for nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) enhancement. Here we identified a NIN-like protein NLP4 associated with NUE through a GWAS in rice. We found that OsNLP4 transactivated OsNiR encoding nitrite reductase that was critical in nitrogen assimilation in rice. We further constructed quadrupling NREs (Nitrate-responsive cis-element) in the promoter of OsNiR (p4xNRE:OsNiR) and enhanced nitrogen assimilation significantly. We demonstrated that OsNLP4-OsNiR increased tiller number and yield through enhancing nitrogen assimilation and NUE. Our discovery highlights the genetic modulation of OsNLP4-OsNiR signaling cascade as a strategy for high NUE and yield breeding in rice. 
NA	Rice NIN-LIKE PROTEIN 4 plays a pivotal role in nitrogen use efficiency	2020	Plant Biotechnol J	School of Life Sciences and Division of Molecular & Cell Biophysics, Hefei National Science Center for Physical Sciences at the Microscale, University of Science and Technology of China, The Innovation Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui Province, China.	Nitrogen (N) is one of the key essential macronutrients that affects rice growth and yield. Inorganic N fertilizers are excessively used to boost yield and generate serious collateral environmental pollution. Therefore, improving crop N use efficiency (NUE) is highly desirable and has been a major endeavour in crop improvement. However, only a few regulators have been identified that can be used to improve NUE in rice to date. Here we show that the rice NIN-like protein 4 (OsNLP4) significantly improves the rice NUE and yield. Field trials consistently showed that loss-of-OsNLP4 dramatically reduced yield and NUE compared with wild type under different N regimes. In contrast, the OsNLP4 overexpression lines remarkably increased yield by 30% and NUE by 47% under moderate N level compared with wild type. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that OsNLP4 orchestrates the expression of a majority of known N uptake, assimilation and signalling genes by directly binding to the nitrate-responsive cis-element in their promoters to regulate their expression. Moreover, overexpression of OsNLP4 can recover the phenotype of Arabidopsis nlp7 mutant and enhance its biomass. Our results demonstrate that OsNLP4 plays a pivotal role in rice NUE and sheds light on crop NUE improvement.
