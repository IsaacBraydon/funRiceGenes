OsNLP4	PSR1|OsNiR	Enhanced OsNLP4-OsNiR cascade confers nitrogen use efficiency by promoting tiller number in rice	 We found that OsNLP4 transactivated OsNiR encoding nitrite reductase that was critical in nitrogen assimilation in rice
OsNIN-like3|OsNLP3	OsNLP4	Rice NIN-LIKE PROTEIN 3 modulates nitrogen use efficiency and grain yield under nitrate-sufficient conditions.	 Overall, our study demonstrates that OsNLP3, together with OsNLP1 and OsNLP4, plays overlapping and differential roles in N acquisition and NUE, and modulates NUE and the grain yield increase promoted by N fertilizer
