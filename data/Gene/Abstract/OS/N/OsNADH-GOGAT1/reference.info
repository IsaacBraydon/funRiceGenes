NA	Rice Ferredoxin-Dependent Glutamate Synthase Regulates Nitrogen-Carbon Metabolomes and Is Genetically Differentiated between japonica and indica Subspecies	2016	Molecular plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Plant Gene Research Center (Beijing), CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China	Plants assimilate inorganic nitrogen absorbed from soil into organic forms as Gln and Glu through the glutamine synthetase/glutamine:2-oxoglutarate amidotransferase (GS/GOGAT) cycle. Whereas GS catalyzes the formation of Gln from Glu and ammonia, GOGAT catalyzes the transfer of an amide group from Gln to 2-oxoglutarate to produce two molecules of Glu. However, the regulatory role of the GS/GOGAT cycle in the carbon-nitrogen balance is not well understood. Here, we report the functional characterization of the rice ABNORMAL CYTOKININ RESPONSE 1 (ABC1) gene that encodes an Fd-GOGAT. Whereas the weak mutant allele abc1-1 mutant shows a typical nitrogen-deficient syndrome, the T-DNA insertional mutant abc1-2 is seedling lethal. Metabolomics analysis revealed the accumulation of excessive amount of amino acids with high N/C ratio (Gln and Asn) and several intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle in abc1-1, suggesting that ABC1 plays a critical role in regulating nitrogen assimilation and carbon-nitrogen balance. Five non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in the ABC1 coding region and characterized as 3 distinct haplotypes, which have been highly and specifically differentiated between japonica and indica subspecies. These results suggest that ABC1/OsFd-GOGAT is essential for plant growth and development by modulating nitrogen assimilation and the carbon-nitrogen balance.
NA	Concurrent activation of OsAMT1;2 and OsGOGAT1 in rice leads to enhanced nitrogen use efficiency under nitrogen limitation.	2020	Plant J	Center for Plant Aging Research, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Daegu, Korea.	Nitrogen (N) is a major factor for plant development and productivity. However, the application of nitrogenous fertilizers generates environmental and economic problems. To cope with the increasing global food demand, the development of rice varieties with high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is indispensable to reduce environmental issues and achieve sustainable agriculture. Here, we report that the concomitant activation of the rice (Oryza sativa) Ammonium transporter 1;2 (OsAMT1;2) and Glutamate synthetase 1 (OsGOGAT1) genes leads to increased tolerance to nitrogen-limitation and to better ammonium uptake and N-remobilization at the whole plant level. We show that the double activation of OsAMT1;2 and OsGOGAT1 increases plant performance in agriculture, providing better N grain filling without yield penalty under paddy field conditions, and better grain yield and N content when plants are grown under N-limiting in field conditions. Combining OsAMT1;2 and OsGOGAT1 activation then provides a good breeding strategy for improving plant growth, nitrogen use efficiency and grain productivity especially under nitrogen limitation through the increment of both nitrogen uptake and assimilation.
