OsAMT1;2|OsAMT1.2	OsNADH-GOGAT1|OsGOGAT1	Concurrent activation of OsAMT1;2 and OsGOGAT1 in rice leads to enhanced nitrogen use efficiency under nitrogen limitation.	 Here, we report that the concomitant activation of the rice (Oryza sativa) Ammonium transporter 1;2 (OsAMT1;2) and Glutamate synthetase 1 (OsGOGAT1) genes leads to increased tolerance to nitrogen-limitation and to better ammonium uptake and N-remobilization at the whole plant level
OsAMT1;2|OsAMT1.2	OsNADH-GOGAT1|OsGOGAT1	Concurrent activation of OsAMT1;2 and OsGOGAT1 in rice leads to enhanced nitrogen use efficiency under nitrogen limitation.	 We show that the double activation of OsAMT1;2 and OsGOGAT1 increases plant performance in agriculture, providing better N grain filling without yield penalty under paddy field conditions, and better grain yield and N content when plants are grown under N-limiting in field conditions
OsAMT1;2|OsAMT1.2	OsNADH-GOGAT1|OsGOGAT1	Concurrent activation of OsAMT1;2 and OsGOGAT1 in rice leads to enhanced nitrogen use efficiency under nitrogen limitation.	 Combining OsAMT1;2 and OsGOGAT1 activation then provides a good breeding strategy for improving plant growth, nitrogen use efficiency and grain productivity especially under nitrogen limitation through the increment of both nitrogen uptake and assimilation
