OsNLP1	 Overexpression of OsNLP1 improves plant growth, grain yield and NUE under different N conditions while knockout of OsNLP1 impairs grain yield and NUE under N limiting conditions |  Chromatin immunoprecipitation and yeast-one-hybrid assays show that OsNLP1 can directly bind to the promoter of these genes to activate their expression	 Overexpression of OsNLP1 improves plant growth, grain yield and NUE under different N conditions while knockout of OsNLP1 impairs grain yield and NUE under N limiting conditions
