OsNAGK1|NAGK1	chloroplast	Interaction of N-acetylglutamate kinase with a PII-like protein in rice	 Transient expression of OsGlnB cDNA or OsNAGK1 cDNA fused with sGFP in rice leaf blades strongly suggested that the PII-like protein as well as OsNAGK1 protein is located in chloroplasts
OsNAGK1|NAGK1	root	Interaction of N-acetylglutamate kinase with a PII-like protein in rice	 Both OsGlnB and OsNAGK1 genes were expressed in roots, leaf blades, leaf sheaths and spikelets of rice, and these two genes were coordinately expressed in leaf blades during the life span
OsNAGK1|NAGK1	spikelet	Interaction of N-acetylglutamate kinase with a PII-like protein in rice	 Both OsGlnB and OsNAGK1 genes were expressed in roots, leaf blades, leaf sheaths and spikelets of rice, and these two genes were coordinately expressed in leaf blades during the life span
