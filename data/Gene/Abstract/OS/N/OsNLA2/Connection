OsNLA1	OsNLA2	Characterization of the rice NLA family reveals a key role for OsNLA1 in phosphate homeostasis.	) were identified by bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis and designated OsNLA1 and OsNLA2
OsNLA1	OsNLA2	Characterization of the rice NLA family reveals a key role for OsNLA1 in phosphate homeostasis.	 The OsNLA1 clustered with Arabidopsis AtNLA1, was expressed higher than OsNLA2 and was transcriptionally repressed under Pi-deficient condition
OsNLA2	OsSCL26	The Splicing Factor OsSCL26 Regulates Phosphorus Homeostasis in Rice.	 Furthermore, the P-related genes, including the PHT and SPX family genes, were upregulated in the osscl26 mutant, and the exclusion/inclusion ratio of the two genes, OsSPX-MFS2 and OsNLA2, was increased compared to wild-type rice
