OsNAS2	root	Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron	OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 transcripts were detected in Fe-sufficient roots but not in leaves, and levels of both increased markedly in both roots and leaves in response to Fe deficiency
OsNAS2	root	Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron	Promoter-GUS analysis revealed that OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 were expressed in Fe-sufficient roots in companion cells and pericycle cells adjacent to the protoxylem
OsNAS2	root	Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron	With Fe deficiency, OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 expression extended to all root cells along with an increase in phytosiderophore secretion
OsNAS2	iron	Activation of Rice nicotianamine synthase 2 (OsNAS2) enhances iron availability for biofortification	Activation of iron deficiency-inducible OsNAS2 resulted in a rise in Fe content (3
OsNAS2	iron	Activation of Rice nicotianamine synthase 2 (OsNAS2) enhances iron availability for biofortification	Activation of Rice nicotianamine synthase 2 (OsNAS2) enhances iron availability for biofortification
OsNAS2	ethylene	Ethylene is involved in the regulation of iron homeostasis by regulating the expression of iron-acquisition-related genes in Oryza sativa	RNA interference of OsIRO2 in transgenic rice showed that ethylene acted via this transcription factor to induce the expression of OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsYSL15, and OsIRT1
OsNAS2	zinc	Bio-available zinc in rice seeds is increased by activation tagging of nicotianamine synthase	Mice fed with OsNAS2-D1 seeds recovered more rapidly from a zinc deficiency than did control mice receiving WT seeds
OsNAS2	zinc	Bio-available zinc in rice seeds is increased by activation tagging of nicotianamine synthase	These results demonstrate that the level of bio-available zinc in rice grains can be enhanced significantly by activation tagging of OsNAS2
OsNAS2	seed	Activation of Rice nicotianamine synthase 2 (OsNAS2) enhances iron availability for biofortification	Mice fed with OsNAS2-D1 seeds recovered more rapidly from anemia, indicating that bioavailable Fe contents were improved by this increase in OsNAS2 expression
OsNAS2	seed	Bio-available zinc in rice seeds is increased by activation tagging of nicotianamine synthase	Mice fed with OsNAS2-D1 seeds recovered more rapidly from a zinc deficiency than did control mice receiving WT seeds
OsNAS2	endosperm	Bio-available zinc in rice seeds is increased by activation tagging of nicotianamine synthase	In the endosperm, the OsNAS2 activation-tagged line contained up to 20-fold more NA and 2
OsNAS2	vascular bundle	Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron	In Fe-deficient plants, OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 were expressed in the vascular bundles of green leaves and in all cells of leaves showing severe chlorosis
OsNAS2	transcription factor	Ethylene is involved in the regulation of iron homeostasis by regulating the expression of iron-acquisition-related genes in Oryza sativa	RNA interference of OsIRO2 in transgenic rice showed that ethylene acted via this transcription factor to induce the expression of OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsYSL15, and OsIRT1
OsNAS2	xylem	Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron	Promoter-GUS analysis revealed that OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 were expressed in Fe-sufficient roots in companion cells and pericycle cells adjacent to the protoxylem
OsNAS2	iron	Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron	Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron
OsNAS2	grain	Bio-available zinc in rice seeds is increased by activation tagging of nicotianamine synthase	These results demonstrate that the level of bio-available zinc in rice grains can be enhanced significantly by activation tagging of OsNAS2
OsNAS2	zinc	Rice NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE 2 expression improves dietary iron and zinc levels in wheat.	We obtained significant increases of iron and zinc content in wheat grains of plants expressing either OsNAS2 or PvFERRTIN, or both genes
OsNAS2	iron	Rice NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE 2 expression improves dietary iron and zinc levels in wheat.	We obtained significant increases of iron and zinc content in wheat grains of plants expressing either OsNAS2 or PvFERRTIN, or both genes
