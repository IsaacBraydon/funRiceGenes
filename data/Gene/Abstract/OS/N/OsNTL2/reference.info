NA	The NAC family transcription factor OsNAP confers abiotic stress response through the ABA pathway.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Genetics, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Science, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China.	Plants respond to environmental stresses by altering gene expression, and several genes have been found to mediate stress-induced expression, but many additional factors are yet to be identified. OsNAP is a member of the NAC transcription factor family; it is localized in the nucleus, and shows transcriptional activator activity in yeast. Analysis of the OsNAP transcript levels in rice showed that this gene was significantly induced by ABA and abiotic stresses, including high salinity, drought and low temperature. Rice plants overexpressing OsNAP did not show growth retardation, but showed a significantly reduced rate of water loss, enhanced tolerance to high salinity, drought and low temperature at the vegetative stage, and improved yield under drought stress at the flowering stage. Microarray analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsNAP revealed that many stress-related genes were up-regulated, including OsPP2C06/OsABI2, OsPP2C09, OsPP2C68 and OsSalT, and some genes coding for stress-related transcription factors (OsDREB1A, OsMYB2, OsAP37 and OsAP59). Our data suggest that OsNAP functions as a transcriptional activator that plays a role in mediating abiotic stress responses in rice.
NA	Probing protein structural requirements for activation of membrane-bound NAC transcription factors in Arabidopsis and rice	2009	Plant Science	Department of Chemistry, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Republic of Korea	Many transcription factors are stored in a dormant state through association with the cellular membranes in plants. Upon stimulation by internal and environmental signals, they are activated through proteolytic cleavage events either by membrane-associated proteases or by ubiquitination-dependent proteasome activities. Controlled proteolytic activation of the dormant, membrane-bound transcription factors (MTFs) is an intriguing way of ensuring rapid transcriptional responses to abrupt environmental changes. However, the underlying activation mechanisms and protein structural requirements are largely unknown in most cases. Here, we analyzed the primary and secondary structures of the NAC MTFs, particularly of the amino acid sequences surrounding the putative cleavage sites. Interestingly, the putative biologically active forms have strong hydrophilic motifs at their C-termini. Accordingly, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the truncated forms having the C-terminal hydrophilic motifs exhibited distinct phenotypes. The finding was also applicable to rice NAC MTFs. Among the full-size OsNTL2 protein and a series of truncated OsNTL2 forms lacking the C-terminal transmembrane motif, only the OsNTL2 form (Os2Î”C4) having a strong hydrophilic peak at the C-terminus exhibited a high transcriptional activation activity when assayed in yeast cells. Our findings will provide insights into how plant MTFs are activated to release the biologically active forms.
