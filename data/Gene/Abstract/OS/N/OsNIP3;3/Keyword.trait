OsNIP3;3	xylem	Decreasing arsenic accumulation in rice by overexpressing OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3 through disrupting arsenite radial transport in roots.	 Overexpression of OsNIP1;1 or OsNIP3;3 provides a route for arsenite to leak out of the stele, thus restricting arsenite loading into the xylem
OsNIP3;3	root	Decreasing arsenic accumulation in rice by overexpressing OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3 through disrupting arsenite radial transport in roots.	 The overexpressed OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3 proteins were localized in all root cells without polarity
OsNIP3;3	shoot	Decreasing arsenic accumulation in rice by overexpressing OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3 through disrupting arsenite radial transport in roots.	 Overexpression of OsNIP1;1 or OsNIP3;3 in rice did not affect arsenite uptake but decreased root-to-shoot translocation of arsenite and shoot arsenic concentration markedly
OsNIP3;3	arsenite	Decreasing arsenic accumulation in rice by overexpressing OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3 through disrupting arsenite radial transport in roots.	Decreasing arsenic accumulation in rice by overexpressing OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3 through disrupting arsenite radial transport in roots.
OsNIP3;3	arsenite	Decreasing arsenic accumulation in rice by overexpressing OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3 through disrupting arsenite radial transport in roots.	 OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3 were highly permeable to arsenite in Xenopus oocyte assays
OsNIP3;3	arsenite	Decreasing arsenic accumulation in rice by overexpressing OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3 through disrupting arsenite radial transport in roots.	 Overexpression of OsNIP1;1 or OsNIP3;3 in rice did not affect arsenite uptake but decreased root-to-shoot translocation of arsenite and shoot arsenic concentration markedly
OsNIP3;3	arsenite	Decreasing arsenic accumulation in rice by overexpressing OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3 through disrupting arsenite radial transport in roots.	 Overexpression of OsNIP1;1 or OsNIP3;3 provides a route for arsenite to leak out of the stele, thus restricting arsenite loading into the xylem
OsNIP3;3	arsenic accumulation	Decreasing arsenic accumulation in rice by overexpressing OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3 through disrupting arsenite radial transport in roots.	Decreasing arsenic accumulation in rice by overexpressing OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3 through disrupting arsenite radial transport in roots.
