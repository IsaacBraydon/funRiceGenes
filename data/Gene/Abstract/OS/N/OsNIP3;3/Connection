Lsi1|OsNIP2;1|OsLsi1	OsNIP3;3	Decreasing arsenic accumulation in rice by overexpressing OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3 through disrupting arsenite radial transport in roots.	 We generated transgenic rice overexpressing two aquaporin genes, OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3, under the control of a maize ubiquitin promoter or the rice OsLsi1 promoter, and tested the effect on arsenite uptake and translocation
