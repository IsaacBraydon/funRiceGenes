OsNHX1	OsNIN-like2|OsNLP2	Five novel transcription factors as potential regulators of OsNHX1 gene expression in a salt tolerant rice genotype.	This approach allowed us to identify five TFs belonging to three distinct TF families: one TCP (OsPCF2), one CPP (OsCPP5) and three NIN-like (OsNIN-like2, OsNIN-like3 and OsNIN-like4) binding to the OsNHX1 gene promoter

Five transcription factors (TFs) belonging to three distinct TF families: one TCP (OsPCF2), one CPP (OsCPP5) and three NIN-like (OsNIN-like2, OsNIN-like3 and OsNIN-like4) were identified as binding to OsNHX1 promoter
OsNHX1	OsNIN-like2|OsNLP2	Five novel transcription factors as potential regulators of OsNHX1 gene expression in a salt tolerant rice genotype.	Transactivation activity assays performed in Arabidopsis and rice protoplasts showed that OsPCF2 and OsNIN-like4 are activators of the OsNHX1 gene expression, while OsCPP5 and OsNIN-like2 act as repressors
OsNIN-like2|OsNLP2	OsrbohB|Osrboh7	The NIN-Like Protein OsNLP2 Negatively Regulates Ferroptotic Cell Death and Immune Responses to Magnaporthe oryzae in Rice.	 The loss-of-function of OsNLP2 triggered the expression of defense-related genes including OsPBZ1, OsPIP-3A, OsWRKY104, and OsRbohB in ΔOsnlp2 mutants
