Osnop	sterile	The Oryza sativa no pollen (Osnop) gene plays a role in male gametophyte development and most likely encodes a C2-GRAM domain-containing protein	Phenotype screens of Ds insertional lines identified a male sterile Orysa sativa no pollen (Osnop) mutant with a pollen-less phenotype at the flowering stage
Osnop	pollen	The Oryza sativa no pollen (Osnop) gene plays a role in male gametophyte development and most likely encodes a C2-GRAM domain-containing protein	Phenotype screens of Ds insertional lines identified a male sterile Orysa sativa no pollen (Osnop) mutant with a pollen-less phenotype at the flowering stage
Osnop	pollen	The Oryza sativa no pollen (Osnop) gene plays a role in male gametophyte development and most likely encodes a C2-GRAM domain-containing protein	 Thus, the delegen 14 gene is the best candidate for Osnop, corresponding to the pollen-less phenotype in the mutant
Osnop	pollen	The Oryza sativa no pollen (Osnop) gene plays a role in male gametophyte development and most likely encodes a C2-GRAM domain-containing protein	The Oryza sativa no pollen (Osnop) gene plays a role in male gametophyte development and most likely encodes a C2-GRAM domain-containing protein
Osnop	flower	The Oryza sativa no pollen (Osnop) gene plays a role in male gametophyte development and most likely encodes a C2-GRAM domain-containing protein	Phenotype screens of Ds insertional lines identified a male sterile Orysa sativa no pollen (Osnop) mutant with a pollen-less phenotype at the flowering stage
