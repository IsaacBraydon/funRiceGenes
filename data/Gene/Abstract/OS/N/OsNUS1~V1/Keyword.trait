OsNUS1|V1	leaf	A virescent gene V1 determines the expression timing of plastid genes for transcription/translation apparatus during early leaf development in rice	 We report here the effects of v1 mutation on the expressions of plastid and nuclear genes during leaf development| This period coincides very closely with the leaf developmental stage (late P4) at which the V1 gene gives the signal that determines the virescent phenotype|A virescent gene V1 determines the expression timing of plastid genes for transcription/translation apparatus during early leaf development in rice
OsNUS1|V1	seedling	A virescent gene V1 determines the expression timing of plastid genes for transcription/translation apparatus during early leaf development in rice	 On the contrary, in the v1 seedlings grown at a restrictive temperature (20°C), this stage-specific accumulation of the rpo and rps transcripts was missing
OsNUS1|V1	temperature	A virescent gene V1 determines the expression timing of plastid genes for transcription/translation apparatus during early leaf development in rice	" The rice nuclear mutant, virescent-1 (v1), is temperature-conditional and develops chlorotic leaves when grown at restrictive temperatures| On the contrary, in the v1 seedlings grown at a restrictive temperature (20°C), this stage-specific accumulation of the rpo and rps transcripts was missing"
