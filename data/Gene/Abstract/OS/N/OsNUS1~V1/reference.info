To examine the physiological relationship between developing chloroplasts and host leaf cells during early leaf development, we investigated changes in the carbon and nitrogen contents in leaves at the P4 developmental stage of rice, during which leaf blade structure is established and early events of chloroplast differentiation occur. During the P4 stage, carbon content on a dry mass basis remained constant, whereas the nitrogen content decreased by 30%. Among carbohydrates, sucrose and starch accumulated to high levels early in the P4 stage, and glucose, fructose and cellulose degradation increased during the mid-to-late P4 stage. In the chloroplast-deficient leaves of the virescent-1 mutant of rice, however, the carbon and nitrogen contents, as well as the C/N ratio during the P4 stage, were largely unaffected. These observations suggest that developing rice leaves function as sink organs at the P4 stage, and that chloroplast biogenesis and carbon and nitrogen metabolism in the leaf cell is regulated independently at this stage.

This process involves activation of a large number of nuclear and chloroplast genes. A central question, therefore, concerns the nature and origin of the signals that initiate and control this process. The rice nuclear mutant, virescent-1 (v1), is temperature-conditional and develops chlorotic leaves when grown at restrictive temperatures. We report here the effects of v1 mutation on the expressions of plastid and nuclear genes during leaf development. In the wild-type rice seedlings, the transcripts of the plastid RNA polymerase gene (rpoB) and ribosomal protein genes (rps7, rps15) accumulated during a strictly limited period of early leaf development, prior to the accumulation of the transcripts of photosynthetic genes (rbcL, RbcS, psbA, Lhc). This period coincides very closely with the leaf developmental stage (late P4) at which the V1 gene gives the signal that determines the virescent phenotype. On the contrary, in the v1 seedlings grown at a restrictive temperature (20Â°C), this stage-specific accumulation of the rpo and rps transcripts was missing. Instead, the accumulation of these transcripts occurred during a later stage of leaf maturation. In such mutant seedlings, the expression of other plastid genes (psbA, rbcL, 16S rDNA) was strongly suppressed and the normal chloroplast development was disturbed. These data indicate that the V1 gene controls the timing of expression of the key plastid genes for the transcription/ translation apparatus that are essential for the subsequent activation of other plastid genes.
j.1365-313X.2011.04755.x.pdf	A plastid protein NUS1 is essential for build-up of the genetic system for early chloroplast development under cold stress conditions	2011	Plant J	Department of Biology, Kyushu University, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan. kkususcb@kyushu-u.org	During early chloroplast differentiation, the regulation of the plastid genetic system including transcription and translation differs greatly from that in the mature chloroplast, suggesting the existence of a stage-dependent mechanism that regulates the chloroplast genetic system during this period. The virescent-1 (v(1)) mutant of rice (Oryza sativa) is temperature-conditional and develops chlorotic leaves under low-temperature conditions. We reported previously that leaf chlorosis in the v(1) mutant is caused by blockage of the activation of the chloroplast genetic system during early leaf development. Here we identify the V(1) gene, which encodes a chloroplast-localized protein NUS1. Accumulation of NUS1 specifically occurred in the pre-emerged immature leaves, and is enhanced by low-temperature treatment. The C-terminus of NUS1 shows structural similarity to the bacterial antitermination factor NusB, which is known to play roles in the regulation of ribosomal RNA transcription. The RNA-immunoprecipitation and gel mobility shift assays indicated that NUS1 binds to several regions of chloroplast RNA including the upstream leader region of the 16S rRNA precursor. In the leaves of the NUS1-deficient mutant, accumulation of chloroplast rRNA during early leaf development was impaired and chloroplast translation/transcription capacity was severely suppressed under low temperature. Our results suggest that NUS1 is involved in the regulation of chloroplast RNA metabolism and promotes the establishment of the plastid genetic system during early chloroplast development under cold stress conditions.
