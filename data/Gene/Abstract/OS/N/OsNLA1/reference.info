NA	OsNLA1, a RING-type ubiquitin ligase, maintains phosphate homeostasis in Oryza sativa via degradation of phosphate transporters.	2017	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, 866 Yuhangtang Road, Hangzhou, 310058, P. R. China.	Inorganic phosphate (Pi) transporters (PTs) play vital roles in Pi uptake and translocation in plants. Under Pi sufficient conditions, PTs are degraded to prevent excess Pi accumulation. The mechanisms targeting PTs for degradation are not fully elucidated. In this study, we found that the Oryza sativa (rice) ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana Nitrogen Limitation Adaptation (NLA), OsNLA1 protein, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin-ligase, was predominantly localized in the plasma membrane, and could interact with rice phosphate transporters OsPT2 and OsPT8. Mutation of the 265(th) cysteine residue in OsNLA1 that was required for ubiquitination prevented breakdown of OsPT2/PT8, suggesting OsNLA1 targeted OsPT2/PT8 for degradation. Mutation in OsNLA1 (osnla1) led to significant increase of Pi concentration in leaves in a nitrate-independent manner. Overexpression of OsNLA1 or repression of OsPT2/PT8 restored the high leaf Pi concentration in osnla1 mutants to a level similar to that of wild type plants. In contrast to what has been observed in Arabidopsis, the transcript abundance of OsNLA1 did not decrease under Pi limited conditions or in OsmiR827 (microRNA827)- or OsPHR2 (PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 2)-overexpressing transgenic lines. Moreover, there was no interaction of OsNLA1 and OsPHO2, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugase, suggesting that OsPHO2 was not the partner of OsNLA1 involved in ubiquitin-mediated PT degradation. Our results show that OsNLA1 is involved in maintaining phosphate homeostasis in rice by mediating the degradation of OsPT2 and OsPT8, and OsNLA1 differs from the ortholog in Arabidopsis in several aspects.

NA	Altered Expression of OsNLA1 Modulates Pi Accumulation in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Plants.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Guelph, GuelphON, Canada.	Current agricultural practices rely on heavy use of fertilizers for increased crop productivity. However, the problems associated with heavy fertilizer use, such as high cost and environmental pollution, require the development of crop species with increased nutrient use efficiency. In this study, by using transgenic approaches, we have revealed the critical role of OsNLA1 in phosphate (Pi) accumulation of rice plants. When grown under sufficient Pi and nitrate levels, OsNLA1 knockdown (Osnla1-1, Osnla1-2, and Osnla1-3) lines accumulated higher Pi content in their shoot tissues compared to wild-type, whereas, over-expression lines (OsNLA1-OE1, OsNLA1-OE2, and OsNLA1-OE3) accumulated the least levels of Pi. However, under high Pi levels, knockdown lines accumulated much higher Pi content compared to wild-type and exhibited Pi toxicity symptoms in the leaves. In contrast, the over-expression lines had 50-60% of the Pi content of wild-type and did not show such symptoms. When grown under limiting nitrate levels, OsNLA1 transgenic lines also displayed a similar pattern in Pi accumulation and Pi toxicity symptoms compared to wild-type suggesting an existence of cross-talk between nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P), which is regulated by OsNLA1. The greater Pi accumulation in knockdown lines was a result of enhanced Pi uptake/permeability of roots compared to the wild-type. The cross-talk between N and P was found to be nitrate specific since the knockdown lines failed to over-accumulate Pi under low (sub-optimal) ammonium level. Moreover, OsNLA1 was also found to interact with OsPHO2, a known regulator of Pi homeostasis, in a Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H) assay. Taken together, these results show that OsNLA1 is involved in Pi homeostasis regulating Pi uptake and accumulation in rice plants and may provide an opportunity to enhance P use efficiency by manipulating nitrate supply in the soil.
NA	Characterization of the rice NLA family reveals a key role for OsNLA1 in phosphate homeostasis.	2017	Rice (N Y)	Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Bio-Resource and Eco-Environment, College of Life Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610064, China.	Phosphate (Pi), an essential mineral nutrient for plant development and reproduction, is one of the main components of fertilizers in modern agriculture. Previous research demonstrated that AtNLA1 mediates ubiquitination of Pi transporters in the plasma membrane and triggers their endocytosis and degradation in Arabidopsis. In this study, we researched the function of NLA homologous proteins in Pi homeostasis in rice.Two OsNLA homologs from rice (Oryza sativa L.) were identified by bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis and designated OsNLA1 and OsNLA2. The OsNLA1 clustered with Arabidopsis AtNLA1, was expressed higher than OsNLA2 and was transcriptionally repressed under Pi-deficient condition. Loss-of-function of OsNLA1 caused P overaccumulation and growth inhibitions in both root and shoot under Pi-sufficient condition. Furthermore, mutation of OsNLA1 affected expression of Pi tranporters and root hair development under Pi-sufficient and/or Pi-deficient conditions.OsNLA1 plays a key role in maintaining phosphate homeostasis in rice.
NA	The role of OsNLA1 in regulating arsenate uptake and tolerance in rice.	2019	J Plant Physiol	Key Laboratory of Bio-Resource and Eco-Environment of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, China.	Arsenic (As) contamination in agricultural soil can cause phytotoxicity and lead to As accumulation in crops. Rice (Oryza sativa) feeds half of the world's population, but the molecular mechanism of As detoxification is not well understood in rice. In this study, the role of OsNLA1 in arsenate uptake and tolerance in rice was analyzed. OsNLA1 expression was induced in response to As(V) stress. The osnla1 mutant was more sensitive to As(V) stress than those of the wild type (WT). When exposed to As(V), mutation of OsNLA1 resulted in 30% greater As accumulation in roots and shoots of the WT. Although OsPT8 expression was induced after As(V) exposure, the amount of its protein was reduced. Unexpectedly, the osnla1 mutant showed a significant increase in punctate structures of OsPT8-GFP in response to As(V) stress, while the amount of the OsPT8-GFP protein in the osnla1 mutant was greater than in the WT. Combining OsNLA1 mutation with OsPT8 overexpression resulted in As(V) hypersensitivity, As hyperaccumulation, and higher shoot to root ratio of As in rice. These results indicated that OsNLA1 plays an important role in arsenate uptake and tolerance, mainly via regulating the amount of Pi transporters.
NA	uORF and Phosphate-Regulated Expression of Rice OsNLA1 Controls Phosphate Transport and Reproduction.	2019	Plant Physiol	Academia Sinica; National Taiwan University CITY: Taipei Taiwan.	Rice (Oryza sativa) OsNLA1 has been proposed to play a crucial role in regulating phosphate (Pi) acquisition in roots, similar to that of Arabidopsis AtNLA. However, unlike AtNLA, OsNLA1 is not a target of miR827, a Pi starvation-induced miRNA. It is, therefore, of interest to know whether the expression of OsNLA1 depends on Pi supply and how it is regulated. In this study, we provide evidence that OsNLA1 controls Pi acquisition by directing the degradation of several OsPHT1 Pi transporters (i.e., OsPT1/2/4/7/8/12). We further show that OsNLA1 has an additional function in reproduction and uncover the mechanism of its expression regulation. Analysis of mRNA levels, promoter-GUS (¦Â-glucuronidase) activity and protoplast transient expression showed that the expression of OsNLA1.1, the most abundant transcript variant, is upregulated in response to increasing Pi supply. The OsNLA1 promoter region was found to contain an upstream open reading frame (uORF) that is required for Pi-responsive expression regulation. OsNLA1 promoter activity was observed in roots, ligules, leaves, sheaths, pollen grains, and surrounding the vascular tissues of anthers, suggesting that OsNLA1 is important throughout the development of rice. Disruption of OsNLA1 resulted in increased Pi uptake from roots as well as impaired pollen development and reduced grain production. In summary, our study reveals that Pi-induced OsNLA1 expression regulated by a unique mechanism functions in Pi acquisition, Pi translocation, and reproductive success.
