OsNLA1	 Overexpression of OsNLA1 or repression of OsPT2/PT8 restored the high leaf Pi concentration in osnla1 mutants to a level similar to that of wild type plants	 Overexpression of OsNLA1 or repression of OsPT2/PT8 restored the high leaf Pi concentration in osnla1 mutants to a level similar to that of wild type plants
OsNLA1	 OsNLA1 expression was induced in response to As(V) stress |  Combining OsNLA1 mutation with OsPT8 overexpression resulted in As(V) hypersensitivity, As hyperaccumulation, and higher shoot to root ratio of As in rice	 Combining OsNLA1 mutation with OsPT8 overexpression resulted in As(V) hypersensitivity, As hyperaccumulation, and higher shoot to root ratio of As in rice
