OsNHX1	OsNIN-like3	Five novel transcription factors as potential regulators of OsNHX1 gene expression in a salt tolerant rice genotype.	 This approach allowed us to identify five TFs belonging to three distinct TF families: one TCP (OsPCF2), one CPP (OsCPP5) and three NIN-like (OsNIN-like2, OsNIN-like3 and OsNIN-like4) binding to the OsNHX1 gene promoter
