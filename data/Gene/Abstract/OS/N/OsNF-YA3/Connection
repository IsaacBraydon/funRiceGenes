OsABA8ox1	OsNF-YA3	OsNF-YA3 regulates plant growth and osmotic stress tolerance by interacting with SLR1 and SAPK9 in rice.	 OsNF-YA3 reduces ABA levels by transcriptionally regulating ABA catabolic genes OsABA8ox1 and OsABA8ox3 by binding to their promoters
OsABA8ox3	OsNF-YA3	OsNF-YA3 regulates plant growth and osmotic stress tolerance by interacting with SLR1 and SAPK9 in rice.	 OsNF-YA3 reduces ABA levels by transcriptionally regulating ABA catabolic genes OsABA8ox1 and OsABA8ox3 by binding to their promoters
OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	OsNF-YA3	OsNF-YA3 regulates plant growth and osmotic stress tolerance by interacting with SLR1 and SAPK9 in rice.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and transient transcriptional regulation assays demonstrate that OsNF-YA3 activates GA biosynthetic gene OsGA20ox1 expression
OsNF-YA3	SAPK9|OsSAPK9	OsNF-YA3 regulates plant growth and osmotic stress tolerance by interacting with SLR1 and SAPK9 in rice.	OsNF-YA3 regulates plant growth and osmotic stress tolerance by interacting with SLR1 and SAPK9 in rice.
OsNF-YA3	SAPK9|OsSAPK9	OsNF-YA3 regulates plant growth and osmotic stress tolerance by interacting with SLR1 and SAPK9 in rice.	 Furthermore, OSMOTIC STRESS/ABA-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 9 (SAPK9), the positive component in ABA signaling, interacts with OsNF-YA3 and mediates OsNF-YA3 phosphorylation, resulting in its degradation in plants
OsNF-YA3	SLR1|OsGAI|OsSLR1	OsNF-YA3 regulates plant growth and osmotic stress tolerance by interacting with SLR1 and SAPK9 in rice.	OsNF-YA3 regulates plant growth and osmotic stress tolerance by interacting with SLR1 and SAPK9 in rice.
OsNF-YA3	SLR1|OsGAI|OsSLR1	OsNF-YA3 regulates plant growth and osmotic stress tolerance by interacting with SLR1 and SAPK9 in rice.	 Furthermore, the DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1) physically interacts with OsNF-YA3 and thus inhibits its transcriptional activity
