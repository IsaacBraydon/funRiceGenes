OsbZIP76	OsNF-YB9	OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice  (Oryza sativa).	 As a putative  transcription factor, OsbZIP76 alone lacked transcriptional activation activity;  however, it interacted with the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) family transcription factors OsNF-YB9 and OsNF-YB1 in yeast and in planta
