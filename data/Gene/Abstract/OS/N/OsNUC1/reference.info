The rice (Oryza sativa L.) nucleolin gene, OsNUC1, transcripts were expressed in rice leaves, flowers, seeds and roots but differentially expressed within and between two pairs of salt-sensitive and salt-resistant rice lines when subjected to salt stress. Salt-resistant lines exhibited higher OsNUC1 transcript expression levels than salt-sensitive lines during 0.5% (w/v) NaCl salt stress for 6d. Two sizes of OsNUC1 full-length cDNA were found in the rice genome database and northern blot analysis confirmed their existence in rice tissues. The longer transcript (OsNUC1-L) putatively encodes for a protein with a serine rich N-terminal, RNA recognition motifs in the central domain and a glycine- and arginine-rich repeat in the C-terminal domain, while the shorter one (OsNUC1-S) putatively encodes for the similar protein without the N-terminus. Without salt stress, OsNUC1-L expressing Arabidopsis thaliana Atnuc1-L1 plants displayed a substantial but incomplete revertant phenotype, whereas OsNUC1-S expression only induced a weak effect. However, under 0.5% (w/v) NaCl salt stress they displayed a higher relative growth rate, longer root length and a lower H2O2 level than the wild type plants, suggesting a higher salt resistance. Moreover, they displayed elevated AtSOS1 and AtP5CS1 transcript levels. We propose that OsNUC1-S plays an important role in salt resistance during salt stress, a new role for nucleolin in plants.
NA	Rice Overexpressing OsNUC1-S Reveals Differential Gene Expression Leading to Yield Loss Reduction after Salt Stress at the Booting Stage.	2018	Int J Mol Sci	Center of Excellence in Environment and Plant Physiology, Department of Botany, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand. Gwang_desu@hotmail.com.	Rice nucleolin (OsNUC1), consisting of two isoforms, OsNUC1-L and OsNUC1-S, is a multifunctional protein involved in salt-stress tolerance. Here, OsNUC1-S's function was investigated using transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsNUC1-S. Under non-stress conditions, the transgenic lines showed a lower yield, but higher net photosynthesis rates, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rates than wild type only in the second leaves, while in the flag leaves, these parameters were similar among the lines. However, under salt-stress conditions at the booting stage, the higher yields in transgenic lines were detected. Moreover, the gas exchange parameters of the transgenic lines were higher in both flag and second leaves, suggesting a role for OsNUC1-S overexpression in photosynthesis adaptation under salt-stress conditions. Moreover, the overexpression lines could maintain light-saturation points under salt-stress conditions, while a decrease in the light-saturation point owing to salt stress was found in wild type. Based on a transcriptome comparison between wild type and a transgenic line, after 3 and 9 days of salt stress, the significantly differentially expressed genes were enriched in the metabolic process of nucleic acid and macromolecule, photosynthesis, water transport, and cellular homeostasis processes, leading to the better performance of photosynthetic processes under salt-stress conditions at the booting stage.
NA	Genome-wide discovery of natural variation in pre-mRNA splicing and prioritising causal alternative splicing to salt stress response in rice	2021	New Phytol	School of Biological Sciences, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE, 68588, USA.	Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step for the regulation of gene expression. In order to specifically capture splicing variants in plants for genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we developed a software tool to quantify and visualise Variations of Splicing in Population (VaSP). VaSP can quantify splicing variants from short-read RNA-seq datasets and discover genotype-specific splicing (GSS) events, which can be used to prioritise causal pre-mRNA splicing events in GWAS. We applied our method to an RNA-seq dataset with 328 samples from 82 genotypes from a rice diversity panel exposed to optimal and saline growing conditions. In total, 764 significant GSS events were identified in salt stress conditions. GSS events were used as markers for a GWAS with the shoot Na+ accumulation, which identified six GSS events in five genes significantly associated with the shoot Na+ content. Two of these genes, OsNUC1 and OsRAD23 emerged as top candidate genes with splice variants that exhibited significant divergence between the variants for shoot growth under salt stress conditions. VaSP is a versatile tool for alternative splicing analysis in plants and a powerful tool for prioritising candidate causal pre-mRNA splicing and corresponding genomic variations in GWAS.
