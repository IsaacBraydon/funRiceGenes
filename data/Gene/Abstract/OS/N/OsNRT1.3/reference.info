Drought is one of the most significant abiotic stresses that influence plant growth and development. Expression analysis revealed that OsNRT1.3, a putative nitrate transporter gene in rice, was induced by drought. To confirm if the OsNRT1.3 promoter can respond to drought stress, a 2019 bp upstream sequence of OsNRT1.3 was cloned. Three OsNRT1.3 promoter fragments were generated by 5'-deletion, and fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene. The chimeric genes were introduced into rice plants. NRT2019::GUS, NRT1196::GUS and NRT719::GUS showed similar expression patterns in seeds, roots, leaves and flowers in all transgenic rice, and GUS activity conferred by different OsNRT1.3 promoter fragments was significantly upregulated by drought stress, indicating that OsNRT1.3 promoter responds to drought stress and the 719 bp upstream sequence of OsNRT1.3 contains the drought response elements.
NA	Variation in NRT1.1B contributes to nitrate-use divergence between rice subspecies.	2015	Nat Genet	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) consists of two main subspecies, indica and japonica. Indica has higher nitrate-absorption activity than japonica, but the molecular mechanisms underlying that activity remain elusive. Here we show that variation in a nitrate-transporter gene, NRT1.1B (OsNPF6.5), may contribute to this divergence in nitrate use. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that NRT1.1B diverges between indica and japonica. NRT1.1B-indica variation was associated with enhanced nitrate uptake and root-to-shoot transport and upregulated expression of nitrate-responsive genes. The selection signature of NRT1.1B-indica suggests that nitrate-use divergence occurred during rice domestication. Notably, field tests with near-isogenic and transgenic lines confirmed that the japonica variety carrying the NRT1.1B-indica allele had significantly improved grain yield and nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) compared to the variety without that allele. Our results show that variation in NRT1.1B largely explains nitrate-use divergence between indica and japonica and that NRT1.1B-indica can potentially improve the NUE of japonica.
NA	Efficient allelic replacement in rice by gene editing: a case study of the NRT1.1B gene.	2018	J Integr Plant Biol	Institute of Crop Sciences (ICS), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), Beijing 100081, China.	Precise replacement of an existing allele in commercial cultivars with an elite allele is a major goal in crop breeding. A single nucleotide polymorphism in NRT1.1B gene between japonica and indica rice is responsible for the improved nitrogen use efficiency in indica rice. Herein, we precisely replaced the japonica NRT1.1B allele with the indica allele in just one generation using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. No additional selective pressure was needed to enrich the precise replacement events. This work demonstrates the feasibility of replacing any genes with elite alleles within one generation, greatly expanding our ability to improve agriculturally important traits.
NA	NRT1.1B Improves Selenium Concentrations in Rice Grains by Facilitating Selenomethinone Translocation.	2018	Plant Biotechnol J	Luoyang Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Environmental Ecology, Agricultural College, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, 471003, China.	Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for humans and other animals, yet approximately one billion people worldwide suffer from Se deficiency. Rice is a staple food for over half of the world's population that is a major dietary source of Se. In paddy soils, rice roots mainly take up selenite. Se speciation analysis indicated that most of the selenite absorbed by rice is predominantly transformed into selenomethinone (SeMet) and retained in roots. However, the mechanism by which SeMet is transported in plants remains largely unknown. In this study, SeMet uptake was found to be an energy-dependent symport process involving H+ transport, with neutral amino acids strongly inhibiting SeMet uptake. We further revealed that NRT1.1B, a member of rice peptide transporter (PTR) family which plays an important role in nitrate uptake and transport in rice, displays SeMet transport activity in yeast and Xenopus oocyte. The uptake rate of SeMet in the roots and its accumulation rate in the shoots of nrt1.1b mutant were significantly repressed. Conversely, the overexpression of NRT1.1B in rice significantly promoted SeMet translocation from roots to shoots, resulting in increased Se concentrations in shoots and rice grains. With vascular-specific expression of NRT1.1B, the grain Se concentration was 1.83-fold higher than that of wild type. These results strongly demonstrate that NRT1.1B holds great potential for the improvement of Se concentrations in grains by facilitating SeMet translocation, and the findings provide novel insight into breeding of Se-enriched rice varieties.

NA	Nitrate-NRT1.1B-SPX4 cascade integrates nitrogen and phosphorus signalling networks in plants.	2019	Nat Plants	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. bhu@genetics.ac.cn.	To ensure high crop yields in a sustainable manner, a comprehensive understanding of the control of nutrient acquisition is required. In particular, the signalling networks controlling the coordinated utilization of the two most highly demanded mineral nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus, are of utmost importance. Here, we reveal a mechanism by which nitrate activates both phosphate and nitrate utilization in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We show that the nitrate sensor NRT1.1B interacts with a phosphate signalling repressor SPX4. Nitrate perception strengthens the NRT1.1B-SPX4 interaction and promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of SPX4 by recruiting NRT1.1B interacting protein 1 (NBIP1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This in turn allows the key transcription factor of phosphate signalling, PHR2, to translocate to the nucleus and initiate the transcription of phosphorus utilization genes. Interestingly, the central transcription factor of nitrate signalling, NLP3, is also under the control of SPX4. Thus, nitrate-triggered degradation of SPX4 activates both phosphate- and nitrate-responsive genes, implementing the coordinated utilization of nitrogen and phosphorus.
NA	NRT1.1B is associated with root microbiota composition and nitrogen use in field-grown rice.	2019	Nat Biotechnol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, The Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Nitrogen-use efficiency of indica varieties of rice is superior to that of japonica varieties. We apply 16S ribosomal RNA gene profiling to characterize root microbiota of 68 indica and 27 japonica varieties grown in the field. We find that indica and japonica recruit distinct root microbiota. Notably, indica-enriched bacterial taxa are more diverse, and contain more genera with nitrogen metabolism functions, than japonica-enriched taxa. Using genetic approaches, we provide evidence that NRT1.1B, a rice nitrate transporter and sensor, is associated with the recruitment of a large proportion of indica-enriched bacteria. Metagenomic sequencing reveals that the ammonification process is less abundant in the root microbiome of the nrt1.1b mutant. We isolated 1,079 pure bacterial isolates from indica and japonica roots and derived synthetic communities (SynComs). Inoculation of IR24, an indica variety, with an indica-enriched SynCom improved rice growth in organic nitrogen conditions compared with a japonica-enriched SynCom. The links between plant genotype and root microbiota membership established in this study will inform breeding strategies to improve nitrogen use in crops.
NA	A putative 6-transmembrane nitrate transporter OsNRT1.1b plays a key role in rice under low nitrogen.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	OsNRT1.1a is a low-affinity nitrate (NO3 (-) ) transporter gene. In this study, another mRNA splicing product, OsNRT1.1b, putatively encoding a protein with six transmembrane domains, was identified based on the rice genomic database and bioinformatics analysis. OsNRT1.1a/OsNRT1.1b expression in Xenopus oocytes showed OsNRT1.1a-expressing oocytes accumulated (15) N levels to about half as compared to OsNRT1.1b-expressing oocytes. The electrophysiological recording of OsNRT1.1b-expressing oocytes treated with 0.25<U+2009>mM NO3 (-) confirmed (15) N accumulation data. More functional assays were performed to examine the function of OsNRT1.1b in rice. The expression of both OsNRT1.1a and OsNRT1.1b was abundant in roots and downregulated by nitrogen (N) deficiency. The shoot biomass of transgenic rice plants with OsNRT1.1a or OsNRT1.1b overexpression increased under various N supplies under hydroponic conditions compared to wild-type (WT). The OsNRT1.1a overexpression lines showed increased plant N accumulation compared to the WT in 1.25<U+2009>mM NH4 NO3 and 2.5<U+2009>mM NO3 (-) or NH4 (+) treatments, but not in 0.125<U+2009>mM NH4 NO3 . However, OsNRT1.1b overexpression lines increased total N accumulation in all N treatments, including 0.125<U+2009>mM NH4 NO3 , suggesting that under low N condition, OsNRT1.1b would accumulate more N in plants and improve rice growth, but also that OsNRT1.1a had no such function in rice plants.
