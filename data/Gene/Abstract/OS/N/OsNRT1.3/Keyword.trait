OsNRT1.3|NRT1.1B|OsNPF6.5	nitrate	Variation in NRT1.1B contributes to nitrate-use divergence between rice subspecies	Variation in NRT1.1B contributes to nitrate-use divergence between rice subspecies
OsNRT1.3|NRT1.1B|OsNPF6.5	nitrate transporter	Variation in NRT1.1B contributes to nitrate-use divergence between rice subspecies	Here we show that variation in a nitrate-transporter gene, NRT1.1B (OsNPF6.5), may contribute  to this divergence in nitrate use.
