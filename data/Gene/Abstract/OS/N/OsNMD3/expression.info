OsNMD3	 Moreover, global expression profiles of the wild-type and transgenic plants were investigated using the Illumina RNA sequencing approach |  These expression profiles suggested that overexpression of OsNMD3(¦¤NLS) affected ribosome biogenesis and certain basic pathways, leading to pleiotropic abnormalities in plant growth	 These expression profiles suggested that overexpression of OsNMD3(¦¤NLS) affected ribosome biogenesis and certain basic pathways, leading to pleiotropic abnormalities in plant growth
