D3	Retention of OsNMD3 in the cytoplasm disturbs protein synthesis efficiency and affects plant development in rice.	OsNMD3	Retention of OsNMD3 in the cytoplasm disturbs protein synthesis efficiency and affects plant development in rice.
 sativa NMD3 (OsNMD3) shares all the common motifs and shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm via CRM1/XPO1	D3	OsNMD3	Retention of OsNMD3 in the cytoplasm disturbs protein synthesis efficiency and affects plant development in rice.
 A dominant negative form of OsNMD3 with a truncated nuclear localization sequence (OsNMD3(deltaNLS)) was retained in the cytoplasm, consequently interfering with the release of OsNMD3 from pre-60S particles and disturbing the assembly of ribosome subunits	D3	OsNMD3	Retention of OsNMD3 in the cytoplasm disturbs protein synthesis efficiency and affects plant development in rice.
 These expression profiles suggested that overexpression of OsNMD3(deltaNLS) affected ribosome biogenesis and certain basic pathways, leading to pleiotropic abnormalities in plant growth	D3	OsNMD3	Retention of OsNMD3 in the cytoplasm disturbs protein synthesis efficiency and affects plant development in rice.
 Taken together, these results strongly suggest that OsNMD3 is important for ribosome assembly and the maintenance of normal protein synthesis efficiency	D3	OsNMD3	Retention of OsNMD3 in the cytoplasm disturbs protein synthesis efficiency and affects plant development in rice.
