Extreme weather events can cause heat stress that decreases crop production. Recent studies have demonstrated that protein degradation and rRNA homeostasis as well as transcription factors are involved in the thermoresponse in plants. However, how RNA modifications contribute to temperature stress response in plant remains largely unknown. Herein, we identified OsNSUN2 as an RNA 5-methylcytosine (m5C) methyltransferase in rice. osnsun2 mutant displayed severe temperature- and light-dependent lesion-mimic phenotypes and heat-stress hypersensitivity. Heat stress enhanced the OsNSUN2-dependent m5C modification of mRNAs involved in photosynthesis and detoxification systems, such as ¦Â-OsLCY, OsHO2, OsPAL1, and OsGLYI4, which increased protein synthesis. Furthermore, the photosystem of osnsun2 mutant was vulnerable to high ambient temperature and failed to undergo repair under tolerable heat stress. Thus, OsNSUN2 mutation reduced photosynthesis efficiency and accumulated excessive reactive oxygen species upon heat treatment. Our findings demonstrate an important mechanism of mRNA m5C-dependent heat acclimation in rice.
