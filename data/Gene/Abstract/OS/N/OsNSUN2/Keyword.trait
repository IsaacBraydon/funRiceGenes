OsNSUN2	temperature	OsNSUN2-Mediated 5-Methylcytosine mRNA Modification Enhances Rice Adaptation to High Temperature.	 Furthermore, the photosystem of osnsun2 mutant was vulnerable to high ambient temperature and failed to undergo repair under tolerable heat stress
OsNSUN2	photosynthesis	OsNSUN2-Mediated 5-Methylcytosine mRNA Modification Enhances Rice Adaptation to High Temperature.	 Thus, OsNSUN2 mutation reduced photosynthesis efficiency and accumulated excessive reactive oxygen species upon heat treatment
OsNSUN2	stress	OsNSUN2-Mediated 5-Methylcytosine mRNA Modification Enhances Rice Adaptation to High Temperature.	 Furthermore, the photosystem of osnsun2 mutant was vulnerable to high ambient temperature and failed to undergo repair under tolerable heat stress
OsNSUN2	methyltransferase	OsNSUN2-Mediated 5-Methylcytosine mRNA Modification Enhances Rice Adaptation to High Temperature.	 Herein, we identified OsNSUN2 as an RNA 5-methylcytosine (m5C) methyltransferase in rice
