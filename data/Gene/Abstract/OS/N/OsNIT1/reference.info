NA	OsNAR2.1 interaction with OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 functions in root-growth responses to nitrate and ammonium.	2020	Plant Physiol	Nanjing Agricultural University CITY: Nanjing China [CN].	The nitrate transport accessory protein OsNAR2 plays a critical role in root-growth responses to nitrate and nitrate acquisition in rice (Oryza sativa). In this study, a pull-down assay combined with yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that OsNAR2.1 interacts with OsNIT1 and OsNIT2. Moreover, an in vitro nitrilase activity assay indicated that indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN) is hydrolyzed to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) by OsNIT1, the activity of which was enhanced 3-4-fold by OsNIT2 and in excess of 5-8-fold by OsNAR2.1. Knockout (KO) of OsNAR2.1 was accompanied by repressed expression of both OsNIT1 and OsNIT2, whereas KO of OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 in the osnit1 and osnit2 mutant lines did not affect expression of OsNAR2.1 or the root nitrate acquisition rate. osnit1 and osnit2 displayed decreased primary root length and lateral root density. Double KO of OsNAR2.1 and OsNIT2 caused further decreases in lateral root density under nitrate supply . Ammonium supply repressed OsNAR2.1 expression whereas it upregulated OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 expression. Both osnit1 and osnit2 showed root growth hypersensitivity to external ammonium; however, less root growth sensitivity to external IAN, higher expression of three IAA-amido synthetase (GH3) genes, and a lower rate of 3H-IAA movement towards the roots were observed. Taken together, we conclude that the interaction of OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 activated by OsNAR2.1 and nitrogen supply is essential for maintaining root growth possibly via altering the IAA ratio of free to conjugate forms and facilitating its transportation.
NA	Calcium lignosulfonate improves proliferation of recalcitrant indica rice callus via modulation of auxin biosynthesis and enhancement of nutrient absorption	2021	Plant Physiol Biochem	Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia. Electronic address: wanmuhamadasrul@gmail.com.	Lignosulfonate (LS) is a commonly used to promote plant growth. However, the underlying growth promoting responses of LS in plant remain unknown. Therefore, this study was undertaken to elucidate the underlying growth promoting mechanisms of LS, specifically calcium lignosulfonate (CaLS). Addition of 100 mg/L CaLS in phytohormone-free media enhanced recalcitrant indica rice cv. MR219 callus proliferation rate and adventitious root formation. Both, auxin related genes (OsNIT1, OsTAA1 and OsYUC1) and tryptophan biosynthesis proteins were upregulated in CaLS-treated calli which corroborated with increased of endogenous auxin content. Moreover, increment of OsWOX11 gene on CaLS-treated calli implying that the raised of endogenous auxin was utilized as a cue to enhance adventitious root development. Besides, CaLS-treated calli showed higher nutrient ions content with major increment in calcium and potassium ions. Consistently, increased of potassium protein kinases genes (OsAKT1, OsHAK5, OsCBL, OsCIPK23 and OsCamk1) were also recorded. In CaLS treated calli, the significant increase of calcium ion was observed starting from week one while potassium ion only recorded significant increase on week two onwards, suggesting that increment of potassium ion might be dependent on the calcium ion content in the plant cell. Additionally, reduced callus blackening was also coherent with downregulation of ROS scavenging protein and reduced H2O2 content in CaLS-treated calli suggesting the role of CaLS in mediating cellular homeostasis via prevention of oxidative burst in the cell. Taken together, CaLS successfully improved MR219 callus proliferation and root formation by increasing endogenous auxin synthesis, enhancing nutrients uptake and regulating cellular homeostasis.
