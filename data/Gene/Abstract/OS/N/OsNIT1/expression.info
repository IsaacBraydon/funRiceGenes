OsNIT1	1 was accompanied by repressed expression of both OsNIT1 and OsNIT2, whereas KO of OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 in the osnit1 and osnit2 mutant lines did not affect expression of OsNAR2 | 1 expression whereas it upregulated OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 expression |  Both osnit1 and osnit2 showed root growth hypersensitivity to external ammonium; however, less root growth sensitivity to external IAN, higher expression of three IAA-amido synthetase (GH3) genes, and a lower rate of 3H-IAA movement towards the roots were observed
