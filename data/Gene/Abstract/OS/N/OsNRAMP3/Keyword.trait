OsNRAMP3	leaf	OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice	Additionally, compared with wild type, leaf Mn content in osnramp3 plants was mostly in older leaves
OsNRAMP3	root	OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice	Serious necrosis appeared on young leaves and root tips of the OsNRAMP3 knockout line cultivated under low Mn conditions, and high Mn supplies could rescue this phenotype
OsNRAMP3	vascular bundle	OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice	OsNRAMP3 encodes a plasma membrane-localized protein and was specifically expressed in vascular bundles, especially in phloem cells
OsNRAMP3	vascular bundle	OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice	We conclude that OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundle-localized Mn-influx transporter involved in Mn distribution and contributes to remobilization of Mn from old to young leaves
OsNRAMP3	vascular bundle	OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice	OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice
OsNRAMP3	transporter	OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice	Yeast complementation assay showed that OsNRAMP3 is a functional Mn-influx transporter
OsNRAMP3	transporter	OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice	We conclude that OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundle-localized Mn-influx transporter involved in Mn distribution and contributes to remobilization of Mn from old to young leaves
OsNRAMP3	transporter	OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice	OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice
OsNRAMP3	manganese	OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice	OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice
