OsNMCP1	 OsNMCP1 overexpression resulted in a deeper and thicker root system and enhanced drought resistance compared to the wild-type control |  An assay for transposase accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) analysis revealed that OsNMCP1-overexpression altered chromatin accessibility in hundreds of genes related to drought resistance and root growth, including OsNAC10, OsERF48, OsSGL, SNAC1, and OsbZIP23 |  The reported drought resistance or root growth related genes that were positively regulated by OsNMCP1 were negatively regulated by OsSWI3C under drought stress conditions, and OsSWI3C overexpression led to decreased drought resistance	 OsNMCP1 overexpression resulted in a deeper and thicker root system and enhanced drought resistance compared to the wild-type control |  An assay for transposase accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) analysis revealed that OsNMCP1-overexpression altered chromatin accessibility in hundreds of genes related to drought resistance and root growth, including OsNAC10, OsERF48, OsSGL, SNAC1, and OsbZIP23 |  The reported drought resistance or root growth related genes that were positively regulated by OsNMCP1 were negatively regulated by OsSWI3C under drought stress conditions, and OsSWI3C overexpression led to decreased drought resistance
