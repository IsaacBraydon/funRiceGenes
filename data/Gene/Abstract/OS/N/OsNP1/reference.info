NA	Construction of a male sterility system for hybrid rice breeding and seed production using a nuclear male sterility gene.	2016	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Shenzhen Institute of Molecular Crop Design, Shenzhen 518107, China.	The breeding and large-scale adoption of hybrid seeds is an important achievement in agriculture. Rice hybrid seed production uses cytoplasmic male sterile lines or photoperiod/thermo-sensitive genic male sterile lines (PTGMS) as female parent. Cytoplasmic male sterile lines are propagated via cross-pollination by corresponding maintainer lines, whereas PTGMS lines are propagated via self-pollination under environmental conditions restoring male fertility. Despite huge successes, both systems have their intrinsic drawbacks. Here, we constructed a rice male sterility system using a nuclear gene named Oryza sativa No Pollen 1 (OsNP1). OsNP1 encodes a putative glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase regulating tapetum degeneration and pollen exine formation; it is specifically expressed in the tapetum and miscrospores. The osnp1 mutant plant displays normal vegetative growth but complete male sterility insensitive to environmental conditions. OsNP1 was coupled with an amylase gene to devitalize transgenic pollen and the red fluorescence protein (DsRed) gene to mark transgenic seed and transformed into the osnp1 mutant. Self-pollination of the transgenic plant carrying a single hemizygous transgene produced nontransgenic male sterile and transgenic fertile seeds in 1:1 ratio that can be sorted out based on the red fluorescence coded by DsRed Cross-pollination of the fertile transgenic plants to the nontransgenic male sterile plants propagated the male sterile seeds of high purity. The male sterile line was crossed with бл1,200 individual rice germplasms available. Approximately 85% of the F1s outperformed their parents in per plant yield, and 10% out-yielded the best local cultivars, indicating that the technology is promising in hybrid rice breeding and production.
NA	Rice No Pollen 1 (NP1) is required for anther cuticle formation and pollen exine patterning.	2017	Plant J	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic &amp; Developmental Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Shanghai Jiao Tong University-University of Adelaide Joint Centre for Agriculture and Health, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China.	Angiosperm male reproductive organs (anthers and pollen grains) have complex and interesting morphological features, but mechanisms that underlie their patterning are poorly understood. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a male sterile mutant of No Pollen 1 (NP1) in rice (Oryza sativa). The np1-4 mutant exhibited smaller anthers with a smooth cuticle surface, abnormal Ubisch bodies, and aborted pollen grains covered with irregular exine. Wild-type exine has two continuous layers; but np1-4 exine showed a discontinuous structure with large granules of varying size. Chemical analysis revealed reduction in most of the cutin monomers in np1-4 anthers, and less cuticular wax. Map-based cloning suggested that NP1 encodes a putative glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductase; and expression analyses found NP1 preferentially expressed in the tapetal layer from stage 8 to stage 10 of anther development. Additionally, the expression of several genes involved in biosynthesis and in the transport of lipid monomers of sporopollenin and cutin was decreased in np1-4 mutant anthers. Taken together, these observations suggest that NP1 is required for anther cuticle formation, and for patterning of Ubisch bodies and the exine. We propose that products of NP1 are likely important metabolites in the development of Ubisch bodies and pollen exine, necessary for polymerization, assembly, or both.
