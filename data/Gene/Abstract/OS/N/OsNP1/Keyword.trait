Symbol	Keyword	Title	Evidence
OsNP1	growth	Construction of a male sterility system for hybrid rice breeding and seed production using a nuclear male sterility gene.	The osnp1 mutant plant displays normal vegetative growth but complete male sterility insensitive to environmental conditions
OsNP1	pollen	Construction of a male sterility system for hybrid rice breeding and seed production using a nuclear male sterility gene.	OsNP1 encodes a putative glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase regulating tapetum degeneration and pollen exine formation; it is specifically expressed in the tapetum and miscrospores
OsNP1	pollen	Construction of a male sterility system for hybrid rice breeding and seed production using a nuclear male sterility gene.	OsNP1 was coupled with an alpha-amylase gene to devitalize transgenic pollen and the red fluorescence protein (DsRed) gene to mark transgenic seed and transformed into the osnp1 mutant
OsNP1	sterility	Construction of a male sterility system for hybrid rice breeding and seed production using a nuclear male sterility gene.	The osnp1 mutant plant displays normal vegetative growth but complete male sterility insensitive to environmental conditions
OsNP1	seed	Construction of a male sterility system for hybrid rice breeding and seed production using a nuclear male sterility gene.	OsNP1 was coupled with an alpha-amylase gene to devitalize transgenic pollen and the red fluorescence protein (DsRed) gene to mark transgenic seed and transformed into the osnp1 mutant
OsNP1	vegetative	Construction of a male sterility system for hybrid rice breeding and seed production using a nuclear male sterility gene.	The osnp1 mutant plant displays normal vegetative growth but complete male sterility insensitive to environmental conditions
OsNP1	tapetum	Construction of a male sterility system for hybrid rice breeding and seed production using a nuclear male sterility gene.	OsNP1 encodes a putative glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase regulating tapetum degeneration and pollen exine formation; it is specifically expressed in the tapetum and miscrospores
OsNP1	male sterility	Construction of a male sterility system for hybrid rice breeding and seed production using a nuclear male sterility gene.	The osnp1 mutant plant displays normal vegetative growth but complete male sterility insensitive to environmental conditions
OsNP1	pollen exine formation	Construction of a male sterility system for hybrid rice breeding and seed production using a nuclear male sterility gene.	OsNP1 encodes a putative glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase regulating tapetum degeneration and pollen exine formation; it is specifically expressed in the tapetum and miscrospores
