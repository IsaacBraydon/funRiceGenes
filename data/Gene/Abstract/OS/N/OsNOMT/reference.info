The enzyme is not found in healthy tissues and was purified to a nearly homogeneous preparation in one step using adenosine-agarose affinity chromatography, with 1 g rice leaves (UV-irradiated) as starting material. Gel filtration chromatography resulted in an almost pure enzyme, as evidenced by a major band migrating to a position corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 41 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified NOMT was strongly inhibited by Mn(2+), Ni(2+), Cu(2+), Zn(2+), Hg(2+), and Cd(2+), and to a low degree by Co(2+), Mg(2+), Ba(2+), Ca(2+) and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. The amino acid sequence of a NOMT cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-cleavage peptide was highly homologous to that of a caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase from maize, and about 70% of the amino acid sequence was obtained after sequencing the peptides generated by CNBr and/or formic acid hydrolysis. NOMT was also shown to be induced in a time-dependent manner, and purified from rice leaves treated with jasmonic acid and copper chloride.
bbug-3-352.pdf	The potential bioproduction of the pharmaceutical agent sakuranetin, a flavonoid phytoalexin in rice	2012	Bioengineered	Biotechnology Research Center; The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.	Sakuranetin, the major flavonoid phytoalexin in rice, can be induced by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, treatment with CuCl 2 or jasmonic acid (JA), or phytopathogenic infection. In addition to sakuranetin's biological significance on disease resistance in rice, its broad bioactivities have recently been described. Results from these studies have shown that sakuranetin is a useful compound as a plant antibiotic and a potential pharmaceutical agent. Sakuranetin is biosynthesized from naringenin, a precursor of sakuranetin, by naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase (NOMT), but the relevant gene has not yet been identified in rice. Recently, we identified the OsNOMT gene, which is involved in the final step of sakuranetin biosynthesis in rice. In previous studies, OsNOMT was purified to apparent homogeneity from UV-treated wild-type rice leaves; however, the purified protein, termed OsCOMT1, exhibited caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity, but not NOMT activity. Based on the analysis of an oscomt1 T-DNA tagged mutant, we determined that OsCOMT1 did not contribute to sakuranetin production in rice in vivo. Therefore, we took advantage of the oscomt1 mutant to purify OsNOMT. A crude protein preparation from UV-treated oscomt1 leaves was subjected to three sequential purification steps resulting in a 400-fold purification from the crude enzyme preparation with a minor band at an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa in the purest enzyme preparation. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight/time of flight analysis showed that the 40 kDa protein band included two O-methyltransferase-like proteins, but one of the proteins encoded by Os12g0240900 exhibited clear NOMT activity; thus, this gene was designated OsNOMT. Gene expression was induced by treatment with jasmonic acid in rice leaves prior to sakuranetin accumulation, and the recombinant protein showed reasonable kinetic properties to NOMT. Identification of the OsNOMT gene enables the production of large amounts of sakuranetin through transgenic rice and microorganisms. This finding also allows for the generation of disease-resistant and sakuranetin biofortified rice in the future.
J. Biol. Chem.-2012-Shimizu-19315-25.pdf	Purification and identification of naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase, a key enzyme in biosynthesis of flavonoid phytoalexin sakuranetin in rice	2012	J Biol Chem	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.	Sakuranetin, the major flavonoid phytoalexin in rice, is induced by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, CuCl(2) treatment, jasmonic acid treatment, and infection by phytopathogens. It was recently demonstrated that sakuranetin has anti-inflammatory activity, anti-mutagenic activity, anti-pathogenic activities against Helicobacter pylori, Leishmania, and Trypanosoma and contributes to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis in animals. Thus, sakuranetin is a useful compound as a plant antibiotic and a potential pharmaceutical agent. Sakuranetin is biosynthesized from naringenin by naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase (NOMT). In previous research, rice NOMT (OsNOMT) was purified to apparent homogeneity from UV-treated wild-type rice leaves, but the purified protein, named OsCOMT1, exhibited caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity and not NOMT activity. In this study, we found that OsCOMT1 does not contribute to sakuranetin production in rice in vivo, and we purified OsNOMT using the oscomt1 mutant. A crude protein preparation from UV-treated oscomt1 leaves was subjected to three sequential purification steps, resulting in a 400-fold purification from the crude enzyme preparation. Using SDS-PAGE, the purest enzyme preparation showed a minor band at an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa. Two O-methyltransferase-like proteins, encoded by Os04g0175900 and Os12g0240900, were identified from the 40-kDa band by MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis. Recombinant Os12g0240900 protein showed NOMT activity, but the recombinant Os04g0175900 protein did not. Os12g0240900 expression was induced by jasmonic acid treatment in rice leaves prior to sakuranetin accumulation, and the Os12g0240900 protein showed reasonable kinetic properties to OsNOMT. On the basis of these results, we conclude that Os12g0240900 encodes an OsNOMT.
NA	Natural variation in the expression and catalytic activity of a naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase influences antifungal defenses in diverse rice cultivars.	2019	Plant J	Graduate School of Sustainability Science, Tottori University, Tottori, 680-8553, Japan.	Phytoalexins play a pivotal role in plant-pathogen interactions. Whereas leaves of rice (Oryza sativa) cultivar Nipponbare predominantly accumulated the phytoalexin sakuranetin after jasmonic acid induction, only very low amounts accumulated in the Kasalath cultivar. Sakuranetin is synthesized from naringenin by naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase (NOMT). Analysis of chromosome segment substitution lines and backcrossed inbred lines suggested that NOMT is the underlying cause of differential phytoalexin accumulation between Nipponbare and Kasalath. Indeed, both NOMT expression and NOMT enzymatic activity are lower in Kasalath than in Nipponbare. We identified a proline to threonine substitution in Kasalath relative to Nipponbare NOMT as the main cause of the lower enzymatic activity. Expanding this analysis to rice cultivars with varying amounts of sakuranetin collected from around the world showed that NOMT induction is correlated with sakuranetin accumulation. In bioassays with Pyricularia oryzae, Gibberella fujikuroi, Bipolaris oryzae, Burkholderia glumae, Xanthomonas oryzae, Erwinia chyrysanthemi, Pseudomonas syringae, and Acidovorax avenae, naringenin was more effective against bacterial pathogens and sakuranetin was more effective against fungal pathogens. Thus, the relative amounts of naringenin and sakuranetin may provide protection against specific pathogen profiles in different rice-growing environments. In a dendrogram of NOMT genes, those from low sakuranetin-accumulating cultivars formed at least two clusters, only one of which involves the proline to threonine mutation, suggesting that the low sakuranetin chemotype was acquired more than once in cultivated rice. Strains of the wild rice species Oryza rufipogon also exhibited differential sakuranetin accumulation, indicating that this metabolic diversity predates rice domestication.
