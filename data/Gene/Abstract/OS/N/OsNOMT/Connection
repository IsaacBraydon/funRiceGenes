OsMYL2	OsNOMT	OsMYC2, an essential factor for JA-inductive sakuranetin production in rice, interacts with MYC2-like proteins that enhance its transactivation ability.	In addition, we identified 2 collaborators of OsMYC2, OsMYC2-like protein 1 and 2 (OsMYL1 and OsMYL2) that further activated the OsNOMT promoter in synergy with OsMYC2
OsMYC2	OsNOMT	OsMYC2, an essential factor for JA-inductive sakuranetin production in rice, interacts with MYC2-like proteins that enhance its transactivation ability.	In this study, we show that JA-inducible basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional factor OsMYC2 drastically enhances the activity of the OsNOMT promoter and is essential for JA-inducible sakuranetin production

OsAOS2|AOS	OsNOMT	Jasmonic acid contributes to rice resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae.	 Secondly, we observe that transcripts for JA biosynthesis (OsAOS2 and OsOPR7), JA signalling (OsJAZ8, OsJAZ9, OsJAZ11 and OsJAZ13), JA-dependent phytoalexin synthesis (OsNOMT), and JA-regulated defence-related genes, such as OsBBTI2 and OsPR1a, accumulate after fungal infection in a pattern that correlates with the amplitude of resistance
