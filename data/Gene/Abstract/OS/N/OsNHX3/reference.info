Here we identified four additional NHX-type antiporter genes in rice (OsNHX2 through OsNHX5) and performed molecular and functional analyses of those genes. The exon-intron structure of the OsNHX genes and the phylogenetic tree of the OsNHX proteins suggest that the OsNHX proteins are categorized into two subgroups (OsNHX1 through OsNHX4 and OsNHX5). OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 can suppress the Na+, Li+, and hygromycin sensitivity of yeast nhx1 mutants and their sensitivity to a high K+ concentration. The expression of OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 is regulated differently in rice tissues and is increased by salt stress, hyperosmotic stress, and ABA. When we studied the expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by either the OsNHX1 or the OsNHX5 promoter, we observed activity in the stele, the emerging part of lateral roots, the vascular bundle, the water pore, and the basal part of seedling shoots with both promoters. In addition, each promoter had a unique expression pattern. OsNHX1 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the guard cells and trichome, whereas OsNHX5 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the root tip and pollen grains. Our results suggest that the members of this gene family play important roles in the compartmentalization into vacuoles of the Na+ and K+ that accumulate in the cytoplasm and that the differential regulation of antiporter gene expression in different rice tissues may be an important factor determining salt tolerance in rice.
NA	Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) to Identify Salt-Tolerance QTLs Carrying Novel Candidate Genes in Rice During Early Vegetative Stage	2021	Rice (N Y)	Agricultural Biotechnology Department, Faculty of Agriculture, Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran.	Background: Rice is considered as a salt-sensitive plant, particularly at early vegetative stage, and its production is suffered from salinity due to expansion of salt affected land in areas under cultivation. Hence, significant increase of rice productivity on salinized lands is really necessary. Today genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a method of choice for fine mapping of QTLs involved in plant responses to abiotic stresses including salinity stress at early vegetative stage. In this study using > 33,000 SNP markers we identified rice genomic regions associated to early stage salinity tolerance. Eight salinity-related traits including shoot length (SL), root length (RL), root dry weight (RDW), root fresh weight (RFW), shoot fresh weight (SFW), shoot dry weight (SDW), relative water content (RWC) and TW, and 4 derived traits including SL-R, RL-R, RDW-R and RFW-R in a diverse panel of rice were evaluated under salinity (100 mM NaCl) and normal conditions in growth chamber. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was applied based on MLM(+Q + K) model.  Results: Under stress conditions 151 trait-marker associations were identified that were scattered on 10 chromosomes of rice that arranged in 29 genomic regions. A genomic region on chromosome 1 (11.26 Mbp) was identified which co-located with a known QTL region SalTol1 for salinity tolerance at vegetative stage. A candidate gene (Os01g0304100) was identified in this region which encodes a cation chloride cotransporter. Furthermore, on this chromosome two other candidate genes, Os01g0624700 (24.95 Mbp) and Os01g0812000 (34.51 Mbp), were identified that encode a WRKY transcription factor (WRKY 12) and a transcriptional activator of gibberellin-dependent alpha-amylase expression (GAMyb), respectively. Also, a narrow interval on the same chromosome (40.79-42.98 Mbp) carries 12 candidate genes, some of them were not so far reported for salinity tolerance at seedling stage. Two of more interesting genes are Os01g0966000 and Os01g0963000, encoding a plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase and a peroxidase BP1 protein. A candidate gene was identified on chromosome 2 (Os02g0730300 at 30.4 Mbp) encoding a high affinity K+ transporter (HAK). On chromosome 6 a DnaJ-encoding gene and pseudouridine synthase gene were identified. Two novel genes on chromosome 8 including the ABI/VP1 transcription factor and retinoblastoma-related protein (RBR), and 3 novel genes on chromosome 11 including a Lox, F-box and Na+/H+ antiporter, were also identified.  Conclusion: Known or novel candidate genes in this research were identified that can be used for improvement of salinity tolerance in molecular breeding programmes of rice. Further study and identification of effective genes on salinity tolerance by the use of candidate gene-association analysis can help to precisely uncover the mechanisms of salinity tolerance at molecular level. A time dependent relationship between salt tolerance and expression level of candidate genes could be recognized.
