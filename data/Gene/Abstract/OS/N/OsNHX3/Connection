OsNHX2|OsNHX3	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	Here we identified four additional NHX-type antiporter genes in rice (OsNHX2 through OsNHX5) and performed molecular and functional analyses of those genes
OsNHX2|OsNHX3	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 can suppress the Na+, Li+, and hygromycin sensitivity of yeast nhx1 mutants and their sensitivity to a high K+ concentration
OsNHX2|OsNHX3	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	The expression of OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 is regulated differently in rice tissues and is increased by salt stress, hyperosmotic stress, and ABA
OsNHX1	OsNHX2|OsNHX3	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 can suppress the Na+, Li+, and hygromycin sensitivity of yeast nhx1 mutants and their sensitivity to a high K+ concentration
OsNHX1	OsNHX2|OsNHX3	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	The expression of OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 is regulated differently in rice tissues and is increased by salt stress, hyperosmotic stress, and ABA
OsbHLH96|OsbHLH044	OsNHX2|OsNHX3	Loss-of-function mutations of OsbHLH044 transcription factor lead to salinity sensitivity and a greater chalkiness in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 The expression levels of genes coding for starch (OsAGPL1, OsSSIIa, OsWx, and OsFLO2) and seed storage proteins (GluA1 and Globulin 1) were significantly decreased, indicating that they synthesize less store starch and proteins, resulting in grain chalkiness in the osbhlh044 (OsHKT1;3, OsHAK7, OsSOS1, OsSOS2, OsNHX2, and OsLEA3 but not OsHKT2;1), and starch-related genes (OsSSIIa, OsWx, and OsFLO2) by binding to the G-boxes of their promoters
