OsNHX2|OsNHX3	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	Here we identified four additional NHX-type antiporter genes in rice (OsNHX2 through OsNHX5) and performed molecular and functional analyses of those genes
OsNHX2|OsNHX3	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 can suppress the Na+, Li+, and hygromycin sensitivity of yeast nhx1 mutants and their sensitivity to a high K+ concentration
OsNHX2|OsNHX3	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	The expression of OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 is regulated differently in rice tissues and is increased by salt stress, hyperosmotic stress, and ABA
