Symbol	Expression
OsNDPK2|WSL12	 These results indicate that the OsNDPK2 encoded by WSL12 plays an important role in chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis by regulating the expression levels of related genes
OsNDPK2|WSL12|YSS2	 Expression levels of genes associated with Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis in yss2 were mostly decreased, but genes involved in chloroplast biogenesis were up-regulated compared to the wild type
