Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of the Î³-phosphoryl group from a nucleoside triphosphate to a nucleoside diphosphate. In this study, we examined the subcellular localization, tissue-specific gene expression, and enzymatic characteristics of three rice NDPK isozymes (OsNDPK1-OsNDPK3). Sequence comparison of the three OsNDPKs suggested differential subcellular localization. Transient expression of green fluorescence protein-fused proteins in onion cells indicated that OsNDPK2 and OsNDPK3 are localized to plastid and mitochondria respectively, while OsNDPK1 is localized to the cytosol. Expression analysis indicated that all the OsNDPKs are expressed in the leaf, leaf sheath, and immature seeds, except for OsNDPK1, in the leaf sheath. Recombinant OsNDPK2 and OsNDPK3 showed lower optimum pH and higher stability under acidic pH than OsNDPK1. In ATP formation, all the OsNDPKs displayed lower K(m) values for the second substrate, ADP, than for the first substrate, NTP, and showed lowest and highest K(m) values for GTP and CTP respectively.

A cDNA library was constructed using mRNA extracted from rice leaves infected with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), a bacterial leaf blight pathogen, to isolate rice genes induced by Xoo infection. Subtractive hybridization and differential screening of the cDNA library led to the isolation of many induced genes including a nucleotide diphosphate kinase 1 (OsNDPK1) and a pathogenesis-related protein 1 (OSPR1) cDNA. Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs) are key metabolic enzymes that maintain the balance between cellular ATP and other nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). Three other OsNDPK genes (NP922751, OsNDPK2 and OsNDPK3) found in databases were obtained by RTPCR. Three different programs for predicting subcellular targeting indicated that OsNDPK1 and NP922751 were non-organellar, OsNDPK2 plastidic, and OsNDPK3 mitochondrial. Only transcripts of OsNDPK1 accumulated strongly after infection with Xoo. When rice plants were infected with Burkholderia glumae, a bacterial grain/seedling rot pathogen, the pattern of expression of the rice NDPK genes was similar to that following infection with Xoo. OsNDPK1 gene expression was also strongly induced in response to exposure to salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid, although the level of transcripts and their pattern of expression depended on the inducer.
