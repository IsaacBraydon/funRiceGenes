Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of the Î³-phosphoryl group from a nucleoside triphosphate to a nucleoside diphosphate. In this study, we examined the subcellular localization, tissue-specific gene expression, and enzymatic characteristics of three rice NDPK isozymes (OsNDPK1-OsNDPK3). Sequence comparison of the three OsNDPKs suggested differential subcellular localization. Transient expression of green fluorescence protein-fused proteins in onion cells indicated that OsNDPK2 and OsNDPK3 are localized to plastid and mitochondria respectively, while OsNDPK1 is localized to the cytosol. Expression analysis indicated that all the OsNDPKs are expressed in the leaf, leaf sheath, and immature seeds, except for OsNDPK1, in the leaf sheath. Recombinant OsNDPK2 and OsNDPK3 showed lower optimum pH and higher stability under acidic pH than OsNDPK1. In ATP formation, all the OsNDPKs displayed lower K(m) values for the second substrate, ADP, than for the first substrate, NTP, and showed lowest and highest K(m) values for GTP and CTP respectively.
90268064.pdf	Enhanced expression of a gene encoding a nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1 (OsNDPK1) in rice plants upon infection with bacterial pathogens	2004	Mol Cells	Agricultural Plant Stress Research Center, Applied Plant Science Division, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 500-757, Korea.	A cDNA library was constructed using mRNA extracted from rice leaves infected with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), a bacterial leaf blight pathogen, to isolate rice genes induced by Xoo infection. Subtractive hybridization and differential screening of the cDNA library led to the isolation of many induced genes including a nucleotide diphosphate kinase 1 (OsNDPK1) and a pathogenesis-related protein 1 (OSPR1) cDNA. Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs) are key metabolic enzymes that maintain the balance between cellular ATP and other nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). Three other OsNDPK genes (NP922751, OsNDPK2 and OsNDPK3) found in databases were obtained by RTPCR. Three different programs for predicting subcellular targeting indicated that OsNDPK1 and NP922751 were non-organellar, OsNDPK2 plastidic, and OsNDPK3 mitochondrial. Only transcripts of OsNDPK1 accumulated strongly after infection with Xoo. When rice plants were infected with Burkholderia glumae, a bacterial grain/seedling rot pathogen, the pattern of expression of the rice NDPK genes was similar to that following infection with Xoo. OsNDPK1 gene expression was also strongly induced in response to exposure to salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid, although the level of transcripts and their pattern of expression depended on the inducer.
NA	White stripe leaf 12 (WSL12), encoding a nucleoside diphosphate kinase 2 (OsNDPK2), regulates chloroplast development and abiotic stress response in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Mol Breed	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Tiyuchang Road 359, Hangzhou, 310006 China ; College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058 China.	Chloroplast is a crucial organelle for plant photosynthesis and maintaining normal life activities in higher plants. Although some genes related to chloroplast development and pigment synthesis have been identified or cloned in rice, little is known about the relationship between these genes and abiotic stress response. In this study, we identified a novel mutant white stripe leaf 12 (wsl12) affecting pigment synthesis, chloroplast development and abiotic stress response in rice. The mutant phenotype was obvious at seeding and tillering stages and in response to the temperature change. Genetic analysis of reciprocal crosses between wsl12 and wild-type plants showed that wsl12 was a recessive mutant in a single nuclear locus. Map-based cloning revealed that the WSL12 locus encoded OsNDPK2, one of the three nucleoside diphosphate kinases (OsNDPKs). WSL12 expressed in all tested tissues, while it highly expressed in leaves and young tissues. The WSL12 protein localized to the chloroplast. The wsl12 mutant showed higher superoxide anion level and enhanced sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) and salinity. The transcription pattern of many genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis, ABA synthesis, light signaling pathway, reactive oxygen species-scavenging pathway and the other two OsNDPKs was altered in the wsl12 mutant. These results indicate that the OsNDPK2 encoded by WSL12 plays an important role in chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis by regulating the expression levels of related genes. In addition, WSL12 also affects the response to abiotic stress, such as ABA and salinity in rice, and is beneficial to molecular breeding of stress tolerance.
