Plant Cell Physiol-2010-Yokota-1436-42.pdf	Function of GRAS proteins in root nodule symbiosis is retained in homologs of a non-legume, rice	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	Root nodule (RN) symbiosis in legumes shares genes involved in the early signaling pathway with more ancient arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis, which is widespread in higher plants. The non-legume homologs of such genes have been well documented to be not only essential for the AM symbiosis in non-legume mycorrhizal plants but also functional in the RN symbiosis in legume plants. In contrast, it has not been investigated in detail whether RN symbiosis-specific genes, which are not essential for AM symbiosis, are functionally conserved in non-legumes. Two GRAS-domain transcription factors, NSP1 and NSP2, have been shown to be required for RN symbiosis, but not for AM symbiosis. In this study, we demonstrated that their homologs, OsNSP1 and OsNSP2, from rice are able to fully rescue the RN symbiosis-defective phenotypes of the mutants of corresponding genes in the model legume, Lotus japonicus. Our results indicate that some of the genes essential for RN symbiosis conserve their functions in homologs from non-legumes, which do not nodulate.
Plant Cell-2011-Liu-3853-65.pdf	Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2	2011	Plant Cell	Department of Plant Science, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Wageningen University, 6708 PB Wageningen, The Netherlands.	Legume GRAS (GAI, RGA, SCR)-type transcription factors NODULATION SIGNALING PATHWAY1 (NSP1) and NSP2 are essential for rhizobium Nod factor-induced nodulation. Both proteins are considered to be Nod factor response factors regulating gene expression after symbiotic signaling. However, legume NSP1 and NSP2 can be functionally replaced by nonlegume orthologs, including rice (Oryza sativa) NSP1 and NSP2, indicating that both proteins are functionally conserved in higher plants. Here, we show that NSP1 and NSP2 are indispensable for strigolactone (SL) biosynthesis in the legume Medicago truncatula and in rice. Mutant nsp1 plants do not produce SLs, whereas in M. truncatula, NSP2 is essential for conversion of orobanchol into didehydro-orobanchol, which is the main SL produced by this species. The disturbed SL biosynthesis in nsp1 nsp2 mutant backgrounds correlates with reduced expression of DWARF27, a gene essential for SL biosynthesis. Rice and M. truncatula represent distinct phylogenetic lineages that split approximately 150 million years ago. Therefore, we conclude that regulation of SL biosynthesis by NSP1 and NSP2 is an ancestral function conserved in higher plants. NSP1 and NSP2 are single-copy genes in legumes, which implies that both proteins fulfill dual regulatory functions to control downstream targets after rhizobium-induced signaling as well as SL biosynthesis in nonsymbiotic conditions.
