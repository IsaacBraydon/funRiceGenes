NA	Two Splicing Variants ofOsNPF7.7Regulate Shoot Branching and Nitrogen Utilization Efficiency in Rice.	2018	Front Plant Sci	Center of Applied Biotechnology, Wuhan Institute of Bioengineering, Wuhan, China.	Rice includes 93 nitrate and peptide transporters family (NPF) members that facilitate the soil uptake and internal reallocation of nitrogen for growth and development. This study demonstrated thatOsNPF7.7had two splicing variants, and altered expression of each variant could regulate shoot branching and nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUtE) in rice. The expression of both variants was down-regulated in the buds by increased nitrogen level in theJaponicarice variety ZH11. The expression level of long-variantOsNPF7.7-1was higher in panicles at reproductive stage, however, the expression level of short-variantOsNPF7.7-2was higher in buds and leaves at vegetative stage compared to each other in ZH11. OsNPF7.7-1 was localized in the plasma membrane, whereas OsNPF7.7-2 was localized in the vacuole membrane. Furthermore, the results indicated that the expression level of each variant forOsNPF7.7determined axillary bud outgrowth, and then influenced the rice tiller number. Overexpression ofOsNPF7.7-1could promote nitrate influx and concentration in root, whereas overexpression ofOsNPF7.7-2could improve ammonium influx and concentration in root. RNAi andosnpf7.7lines ofOsNPF7.7showed an increased amount of amino acids in leaf sheaths, but a decreased amount in leaf blades, which affected nitrogen allocation and plant growth. The elevated expression of each variant forOsNPF7.7in ZH11 enhanced NUtE using certain fertilization regimes under paddy field conditions. Moreover, overexpression of each variant forOsNPF7.7in KY131 increased significantly the filled grain number per plant. Thus, increased each variant ofOsNPF7.7has the potential to improve grain yield and NUtE in rice.
