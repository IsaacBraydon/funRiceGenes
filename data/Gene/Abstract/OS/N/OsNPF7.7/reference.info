NA	Two Splicing Variants ofOsNPF7.7Regulate Shoot Branching and Nitrogen Utilization Efficiency in Rice.	2018	Front Plant Sci	Center of Applied Biotechnology, Wuhan Institute of Bioengineering, Wuhan, China.	Rice includes 93 nitrate and peptide transporters family (NPF) members that facilitate the soil uptake and internal reallocation of nitrogen for growth and development. This study demonstrated thatOsNPF7.7had two splicing variants, and altered expression of each variant could regulate shoot branching and nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUtE) in rice. The expression of both variants was down-regulated in the buds by increased nitrogen level in theJaponicarice variety ZH11. The expression level of long-variantOsNPF7.7-1was higher in panicles at reproductive stage, however, the expression level of short-variantOsNPF7.7-2was higher in buds and leaves at vegetative stage compared to each other in ZH11. OsNPF7.7-1 was localized in the plasma membrane, whereas OsNPF7.7-2 was localized in the vacuole membrane. Furthermore, the results indicated that the expression level of each variant forOsNPF7.7determined axillary bud outgrowth, and then influenced the rice tiller number. Overexpression ofOsNPF7.7-1could promote nitrate influx and concentration in root, whereas overexpression ofOsNPF7.7-2could improve ammonium influx and concentration in root. RNAi andosnpf7.7lines ofOsNPF7.7showed an increased amount of amino acids in leaf sheaths, but a decreased amount in leaf blades, which affected nitrogen allocation and plant growth. The elevated expression of each variant forOsNPF7.7in ZH11 enhanced NUtE using certain fertilization regimes under paddy field conditions. Moreover, overexpression of each variant forOsNPF7.7in KY131 increased significantly the filled grain number per plant. Thus, increased each variant ofOsNPF7.7has the potential to improve grain yield and NUtE in rice.
NA	The Amino Acid Transporter OsAAP4 Contributes to Rice Tillering and Grain Yield by Regulating Neutral Amino Acid Allocation through Two Splicing Variants	2021	Rice (N Y)	Key Laboratory of Plant Resource Conservation and Germplasm Innovation in Mountainous Region (Ministry of Education), College of Agricultural Sciences, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, China. zmfang@gzu.edu.cn.	Background: Amino acids, which are transported by amino acid transporters, are the major forms of organic nitrogen utilized by higher plants. Among the 19 Amino Acid Permease transporters (AAPs) in rice, only a small number of these genes have been reported to influence rice growth and development. However, whether other OsAAPs are responsible for rice growth and development is unclear.  Results: In this study, we demonstrate that OsAAP4 promoter sequences are divergent between Indica and Japonica, with higher expression in the former, which produces more tillers and higher grain yield than does Japonica. Overexpression of two different splicing variants of OsAAP4 in Japonica ZH11 significantly increased rice tillering and grain yield as result of enhancing the neutral amino acid concentrations of Val, Pro, Thr and Leu. OsAAP4 RNA interference (RNAi) and mutant lines displayed opposite trends compared with overexpresing (OE) lines. In addition, exogenous Val or Pro at 0.5 mM significantly promoted the bud outgrowth of lines overexpressing an OsAAP4a splicing variant compared with ZH11, and exogenous Val or Pro at 2.0 mM significantly enhanced the bud outgrowth of lines overexpressing splicing variant OsAAP4b compared with ZH11. Of note, the results of a protoplast amino acid-uptake assay showed that Val or Pro at different concentrations was specifically transported and accumulated in these overexpressing lines. Transcriptome analysis further demonstrated that OsAAP4 may affect nitrogen transport and metabolism, and auxin, cytokinin signaling in regulating rice tillering.  Conclusion: Our results suggested that OsAAP4 contributes to rice tiller and grain yield by regulating neutral amino acid allocation through two different splicing variants and that OsAAP4 might have potential applications in rice breeding.
