OsNIN-like4|OsNLP5	drought	Five novel transcription factors as potential regulators of OsNHX1 gene expression in a salt tolerant rice genotype.	In addition, although the OsNHX1 response to salt and PEG-induced drought stress in either shoots or roots was quite similar in both rice genotypes, the expression of OsPCF2 in roots under salt stress and the OsNIN-like4 in roots subjected to PEG was mainly up-regulated in Hasawi, indicating that these TFs may be associated with the salt and drought stress tolerance observed for this genotype
