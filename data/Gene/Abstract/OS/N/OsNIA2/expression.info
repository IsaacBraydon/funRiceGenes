OsNIA2	 In the same way, the expression patterns of OsNIA1 and OsNIA2 in the roots, stem, and leaves indicated a differential transcriptional regulation by KClO3, with OsNIA2 prevailing over OsNIA1 in the roots
OsNIA2	 The expression levels of genes responsible for NO production (OsNIA1, OsNIA2, and OsNOA1) were lower in rhs1 plants than in WT plants under normal conditions |  However, under nitrosative stress, the expression of OsNIA2 significantly increased in rhs1 plants
