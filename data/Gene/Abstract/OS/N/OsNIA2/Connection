OsNIA1|OsNia1|OsNR2	OsNIA2	New Insights into the Transcriptional Regulation of Genes Involved in the Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Potassium Chlorate in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	 In the same way, the expression patterns of OsNIA1 and OsNIA2 in the roots, stem, and leaves indicated a differential transcriptional regulation by KClO3, with OsNIA2 prevailing over OsNIA1 in the roots
OsNIA2	RHS1	A Novel RHS1 Locus in Rice Attributes Seed-Pod Shattering by the Regulation of Endogenous S-Nitrosothiols.	 The expression levels of genes responsible for NO production (OsNIA1, OsNIA2, and OsNOA1) were lower in rhs1 plants than in WT plants under normal conditions
OsNIA2	RHS1	A Novel RHS1 Locus in Rice Attributes Seed-Pod Shattering by the Regulation of Endogenous S-Nitrosothiols.	 However, under nitrosative stress, the expression of OsNIA2 significantly increased in rhs1 plants
