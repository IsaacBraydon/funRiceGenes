OsNHX1	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 The exon-intron structure of the OsNHX genes and the phylogenetic tree of the OsNHX proteins suggest that the OsNHX proteins are categorized into two subgroups (OsNHX1 through OsNHX4 and OsNHX5)
OsNHX1	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 can suppress the Na+, Li+, and hygromycin sensitivity of yeast nhx1 mutants and their sensitivity to a high K+ concentration
OsNHX1	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 The expression of OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 is regulated differently in rice tissues and is increased by salt stress, hyperosmotic stress, and ABA
OsNHX1	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 When we studied the expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by either the OsNHX1 or the OsNHX5 promoter, we observed activity in the stele, the emerging part of lateral roots, the vascular bundle, the water pore, and the basal part of seedling shoots with both promoters
OsNHX1	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 OsNHX1 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the guard cells and trichome, whereas OsNHX5 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the root tip and pollen grains
OsNHX2|OsNHX3	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 Here we identified four additional NHX-type antiporter genes in rice (OsNHX2 through OsNHX5) and performed molecular and functional analyses of those genes
OsNHX2|OsNHX3	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 can suppress the Na+, Li+, and hygromycin sensitivity of yeast nhx1 mutants and their sensitivity to a high K+ concentration
OsNHX2|OsNHX3	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 The expression of OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 is regulated differently in rice tissues and is increased by salt stress, hyperosmotic stress, and ABA
OsNHX4	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 The exon-intron structure of the OsNHX genes and the phylogenetic tree of the OsNHX proteins suggest that the OsNHX proteins are categorized into two subgroups (OsNHX1 through OsNHX4 and OsNHX5)
