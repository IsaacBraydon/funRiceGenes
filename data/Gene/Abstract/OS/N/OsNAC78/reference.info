NA	Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Efficiently Predicts Transcription Factor Targets in Plants	2020	Front Plant Sci	College of Plant Protection, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China.	Discovering transcription factor (TF) targets is necessary for the study of regulatory pathways, but it is hampered in plants by the lack of highly efficient predictive technology. This study is the first to establish a simple system for predicting TF targets in rice (Oryza sativa) leaf cells based on 10 ¡Á Genomics' single-cell RNA sequencing method. We effectively utilized the transient expression system to create the differential expression of a TF (OsNAC78) in each cell and sequenced all single cell transcriptomes. In total, 35 candidate targets having strong correlations with OsNAC78 expression were captured using expression profiles. Likewise, 78 potential differentially expressed genes were identified between clusters having the lowest and highest expression levels of OsNAC78. A gene overlapping analysis identified 19 genes as final candidate targets, and various assays indicated that Os01g0934800 and Os01g0949900 were OsNAC78 targets. Additionally, the cell profiles showed extremely similar expression trajectories between OsNAC78 and the two targets. The data presented here provide a high-resolution insight into predicting TF targets and offer a new application for single-cell RNA sequencing in plants.
NA	A rice protein modulates endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and coordinates with a transcription factor to initiate blast disease resistance.	2021	Cell Rep	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; MOA Key Laboratory of Pest Monitoring and Green Management, College of Plant Protection, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis is essential for plants to manage responses under environmental stress. Plant immune activation requires the ER, but how ER homeostasis is associated with plant immune activation is largely unexplored. Here we find that transcription of an HVA22 family gene, OsHLP1 (HVA22-like protein 1), is induced by Magnaporthe oryzae infection. Overexpression of OsHLP1 significantly enhances blast disease resistance but impairs ER morphology in rice (Oryza sativa), resulting in enhanced sensitivity to ER stress. OsHLP1 interacts with the NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) transcription factor OsNTL6 at the ER. OsNTL6 localizes to the ER and is relocated to the nucleus after cleavage of the transmembrane domain. OsHLP1 suppresses OsNTL6 protein accumulation, whereas OsNTL6 counteracts OsHLP1 by alleviating sensitivity to ER stress and decreasing disease resistance in OsHLP1 overexpression plants. These findings unravel a mechanism whereby OsHLP1 promotes disease resistance by compromising ER homeostasis when plants are infected by pathogens.
