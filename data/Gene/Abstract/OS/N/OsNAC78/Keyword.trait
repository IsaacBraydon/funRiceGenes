OsNAC78|OsNTL6	transcription factor	A rice protein modulates endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and coordinates with a transcription factor to initiate blast disease resistance.	 OsHLP1 interacts with the NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) transcription factor OsNTL6 at the ER
OsNAC78|OsNTL6	resistance	A rice protein modulates endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and coordinates with a transcription factor to initiate blast disease resistance.	 OsHLP1 suppresses OsNTL6 protein accumulation, whereas OsNTL6 counteracts OsHLP1 by alleviating sensitivity to ER stress and decreasing disease resistance in OsHLP1 overexpression plants
OsNAC78|OsNTL6	disease	A rice protein modulates endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and coordinates with a transcription factor to initiate blast disease resistance.	 OsHLP1 suppresses OsNTL6 protein accumulation, whereas OsNTL6 counteracts OsHLP1 by alleviating sensitivity to ER stress and decreasing disease resistance in OsHLP1 overexpression plants
OsNAC78|OsNTL6	disease resistance	A rice protein modulates endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and coordinates with a transcription factor to initiate blast disease resistance.	 OsHLP1 suppresses OsNTL6 protein accumulation, whereas OsNTL6 counteracts OsHLP1 by alleviating sensitivity to ER stress and decreasing disease resistance in OsHLP1 overexpression plants
OsNAC78|OsNTL6	stress	A rice protein modulates endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and coordinates with a transcription factor to initiate blast disease resistance.	 OsHLP1 suppresses OsNTL6 protein accumulation, whereas OsNTL6 counteracts OsHLP1 by alleviating sensitivity to ER stress and decreasing disease resistance in OsHLP1 overexpression plants
OsNAC78|OsNTL6	nucleus	A rice protein modulates endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and coordinates with a transcription factor to initiate blast disease resistance.	 OsNTL6 localizes to the ER and is relocated to the nucleus after cleavage of the transmembrane domain
OsNAC78|OsNTL6	ER stress	A rice protein modulates endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and coordinates with a transcription factor to initiate blast disease resistance.	 OsHLP1 suppresses OsNTL6 protein accumulation, whereas OsNTL6 counteracts OsHLP1 by alleviating sensitivity to ER stress and decreasing disease resistance in OsHLP1 overexpression plants
