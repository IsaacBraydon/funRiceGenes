OsNAC78	 We effectively utilized the transient expression system to create the differential expression of a TF (OsNAC78) in each cell and sequenced all single cell transcriptomes |  In total, 35 candidate targets having strong correlations with OsNAC78 expression were captured using expression profiles |  Likewise, 78 potential differentially expressed genes were identified between clusters having the lowest and highest expression levels of OsNAC78 |  Additionally, the cell profiles showed extremely similar expression trajectories between OsNAC78 and the two targets
