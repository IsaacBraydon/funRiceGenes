OsNIT2	root	OsNAR2.1 interaction with OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 functions in root-growth responses to nitrate and ammonium.	 osnit1 and osnit2 displayed decreased primary root length and lateral root density
OsNIT2	root	OsNAR2.1 interaction with OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 functions in root-growth responses to nitrate and ammonium.	1 and OsNIT2 caused further decreases in lateral root density under nitrate supply 
OsNIT2	root	OsNAR2.1 interaction with OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 functions in root-growth responses to nitrate and ammonium.	 Both osnit1 and osnit2 showed root growth hypersensitivity to external ammonium; however, less root growth sensitivity to external IAN, higher expression of three IAA-amido synthetase (GH3) genes, and a lower rate of 3H-IAA movement towards the roots were observed
OsNIT2	growth	OsNAR2.1 interaction with OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 functions in root-growth responses to nitrate and ammonium.	 Both osnit1 and osnit2 showed root growth hypersensitivity to external ammonium; however, less root growth sensitivity to external IAN, higher expression of three IAA-amido synthetase (GH3) genes, and a lower rate of 3H-IAA movement towards the roots were observed
OsNIT2	lateral root	OsNAR2.1 interaction with OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 functions in root-growth responses to nitrate and ammonium.	 osnit1 and osnit2 displayed decreased primary root length and lateral root density
OsNIT2	lateral root	OsNAR2.1 interaction with OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 functions in root-growth responses to nitrate and ammonium.	1 and OsNIT2 caused further decreases in lateral root density under nitrate supply 
OsNIT2	primary root	OsNAR2.1 interaction with OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 functions in root-growth responses to nitrate and ammonium.	 osnit1 and osnit2 displayed decreased primary root length and lateral root density
OsNIT2	nitrate	OsNAR2.1 interaction with OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 functions in root-growth responses to nitrate and ammonium.	OsNAR2.1 interaction with OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 functions in root-growth responses to nitrate and ammonium.
