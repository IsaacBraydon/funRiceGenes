Loss of function of a mitochondrial complex I subunit (OsNDUFA9) causes abnormal embryo development and affects starch synthesis by altering the expression of starch synthesis-related genes and proteins. Proton-pumping NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (also called complex I) is thought to be the largest and most complicated enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Mutations of complex I subunits have been revealed to link with a number of growth inhibitions in plants. However, the function of complex I subunits in rice remains unclear. Here, we isolated a rice floury endosperm mutant (named flo13) that was embryonic lethal and failed to germinate. Semi-thin sectioning analysis showed that compound starch grain development in the mutant was greatly impaired, leading to significantly compromised starch biosynthesis and decreased 1000-grain weight relative to the wild type. Map-based cloning revealed that FLO13 encodes an accessory subunit of complex I protein (designated as OsNDUFA9). A single nucleotide substitution (G18A) occurred in the first exon of OsNDUFA9, introducing a premature stop codon in the flo13 mutant gene. OsNDUFA9 was ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and the OsNDUFA9 protein was localized to the mitochondria. Quantitative RT-PCR and protein blotting indicated loss of function of OsNDUFA9 altered gene expression and protein accumulation associated with respiratory electron chain complex in the mitochondria. Moreover, transmission electron microscopic analysis showed that the mutant lacked obvious mitochondrial cristae structure in the mitochondria of endosperm cell. Our results demonstrate that the OsNDUFA9 subunit of complex I is essential for embryo development and starch synthesis in rice endosperm.
