OsNDUFA9	starch	OsNDUFA9 encoding a mitochondrial complex I subunit is essential for embryo development and starch synthesis in rice.	 Our results demonstrate that the OsNDUFA9 subunit of complex I is essential for embryo development and starch synthesis in rice endosperm
OsNDUFA9	mitochondria	OsNDUFA9 encoding a mitochondrial complex I subunit is essential for embryo development and starch synthesis in rice.	 OsNDUFA9 was ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and the OsNDUFA9 protein was localized to the mitochondria
OsNDUFA9	mitochondria	OsNDUFA9 encoding a mitochondrial complex I subunit is essential for embryo development and starch synthesis in rice.	 Quantitative RT-PCR and protein blotting indicated loss of function of OsNDUFA9 altered gene expression and protein accumulation associated with respiratory electron chain complex in the mitochondria
