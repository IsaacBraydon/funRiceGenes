An Arabidopsis gene AtNOA1 encodes a NO-associated protein, which plays a role in salt tolerance. We employed the knockout mutant for AtNOA1, Atnoa1 that is sensitive to salinity, as a tool to evaluate the functions of a rice homologous gene, OsNOA1. OsNOA1 transgenic expression rescued Atnoa1 in seedling development and vegetative growth under normal conditions, enhanced the salt tolerance of Atnoa1 in seed germination, seedling root growth and chlorophyll synthesis, and reduced Na+/K+ ratio in Atnoa1; NO relative content assay implicates that NO synthesis was re-established via OsNOA1 expression in Atnoa1; Northern blot and Semi-Q RT-PCR assays demonstrate that salt tolerance-related gene expression was re-established as well via OsNOA1 expression in Atnoa1. Our data indicate that the re-establishment of NO synthesis and salt tolerance-related gene expression by OsNOA1 expression may account for the restoration of Atnoa1 in terms of developmental and salt tolerance phenotypes. All the above results point to a notion that OsNOA1 may play similar roles as AtNOA1, and NO involvement in salt tolerance may be ascribed to its regulation of salt tolerance-related gene expression.

The rice homolog OsNOA1/RIF1 is encoded by the single-copy gene Os02g01440. OsNOA1/RIF1 is expressed in different tissues and is light-inducible. The OsNOA1/RIF1-EYFP fusion protein was targeted to chloroplasts in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. In addition, the rice homolog was able to rescue most of the growth phenotypes in an Arabidopsis rif1 mutant. *Rice (Oryza sativa) OsNOA1/RIF1 RNAi mutant seedlings were chlorotic with reduced pigment contents and lower photosystem II (PSII) efficiency. However, the expressions of the chloroplast-encoded genes rbcL, atpB, psaA and psbA were not affected. By contrast, reduced abundance of the chloroplast 16S rRNA was observed in the mutant. *Quantitative iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS proteomics investigations revealed proteome changes in the rice mutant consistent with the expected functional role of OsNOA1/RIF1 in chloroplast translation. The RNAi mutant showed significantly decreased expression levels of chloroplast-encoded proteins as well as nuclear-encoded components of chloroplast enzyme complexes. Conversely, upregulation of some classes of nonchloroplastic proteins, such as glycolytic and phenylpropanoid pathway enzymes, was detected. *Our work provides independent indications that a highly conserved nuclear-encoded cGTPase of likely prokaryotic origin is essential for proper chloroplast ribosome assembly and/or translation in plants.

NITRIC OXIDE-ASSOCIATED1 (NOA1) encodes a circularly permuted GTPase (cGTPase) known to be essential for ribosome assembly in plants. While the reduced chlorophyll and Rubisco phenotypes were formerly noticed in both NOA1-suppressed rice and Arabidopsis, a detailed insight is still necessary. In this study, by using RNAi transgenic rice, we further demonstrate that NOA1 functions in a temperature-dependent manner to regulate chlorophyll and Rubisco levels. When plants were grown at 30 degrees C, the chlorophyll and Rubisco levels in OsNOA1-silenced plants were only slightly lower than those in WT. However, at 22 degrees C, the silenced plants accumulated far less chlorophyll and Rubisco than WT. It was further revealed that the regulation of chlorophyll and Rubisco occurs at the anabolic level. Etiolated WT seedlings restored chlorophyll and Rubisco accumulations readily once returned to light, at either 30 degrees C or 15 degrees C. Etiolated OsNOA1-silenced plants accumulated chlorophyll and Rubisco to normal levels only at 30 degrees C, and lost this ability at low temperature. On the other hand, de-etiolated OsNOA1-silenced seedlings maintained similar levels of chlorophyll and Rubisco as WT, even after being shifted to 15 degrees C for various times. Further expression analyses identified several candidate genes, including OsPorA (NADPH: protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase A), OsrbcL (Rubisco large subunit), OsRALyase (Ribosomal RNA apurinic site specific lyase) and OsPuf4 (RNA-binding protein of the Puf family), which may be involved in OsNOA1-regulated chlorophyll biosynthesis and Rubisco formation. Overall, our results suggest OsNOA1 functions in a temperature-dependent manner to regulate chlorophyll biosynthesis, Rubisco formation and plastid development in rice.
NA	OsNOA1 functions in a threshold-dependent manner to regulate chloroplast proteins in rice at lower temperatures.	2018	BMC Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.	Although decreased protein expressions have been observed in NOA1 (Nitric Oxide Associated protein 1) deficient plants, the molecular mechanisms of how NOA1 regulates protein metabolism remain poorly understood. In this study, we have used a global comparative proteomic approach for both OsNOA1 suppression and overexpression transgenic lines under two different temperatures, in combination with physiological and biochemical analyses to explore the regulatory mechanisms of OsNOA1 in rice.In OsNOA1-silenced or highly overexpressed rice, considerably different expression patterns of both chlorophyll and Rubisco as well as distinct phenotypes were observed between the growth temperatures at 22<U+00A0>°„C and 30<U+00A0>°„C. These observations led us to hypothesize there appears a narrow abundance threshold for OsNOA1 to function properly at lower temperatures, while higher temperatures seem to partially compensate for the changes of OsNOA1 abundance. Quantitative proteomic analyses revealed higher temperatures could restore 90% of the suppressed proteins to normal levels, whereas almost all of the remaining suppressed proteins were chloroplast ribosomal proteins. Additionally, our data showed 90% of the suppressed proteins in both types of transgenic plants at lower temperatures were located in the chloroplast, suggesting a primary effect of OsNOA1 on chloroplast proteins. Transcript analyses, along with in vitro pull-down experiments further demonstrated OsNOA1 is associated with the function of chloroplast ribosomes.Our results suggest OsNOA1 functions in a threshold-dependent manner for regulation of chloroplast proteins at lower temperatures, which may be mediated by interactions between OsNOA1 and chloroplast ribosomes.
