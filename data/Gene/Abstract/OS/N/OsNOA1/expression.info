OsNOA1	 In this study, we have used a global comparative proteomic approach for both OsNOA1 suppression and overexpression transgenic lines under two different temperatures, in combination with physiological and biochemical analyses to explore the regulatory mechanisms of OsNOA1 in rice | In OsNOA1-silenced or highly overexpressed rice, considerably different expression patterns of both chlorophyll and Rubisco as well as distinct phenotypes were observed between the growth temperatures at 22<U+00A0>°„C and 30<U+00A0>°„C	 In this study, we have used a global comparative proteomic approach for both OsNOA1 suppression and overexpression transgenic lines under two different temperatures, in combination with physiological and biochemical analyses to explore the regulatory mechanisms of OsNOA1 in rice
