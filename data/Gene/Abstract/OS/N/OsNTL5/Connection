Ehd1	OsNTL5	A Membrane-Bound NAC-Like Transcription Factor OsNTL5 Represses the Flowering in Oryza sativa.	 ChIP-qPCR and rice protoplasts assays indicate that OsNTL5 directly binds to the promoter of Ehd1 and negatively regulates the expression of Ehd1, which shows antagonistic photoperiodic expression patterns of OsNTL5 in a 24-h SD cycle
Ehd1	OsNTL5	A Membrane-Bound NAC-Like Transcription Factor OsNTL5 Represses the Flowering in Oryza sativa.	 Hence in conclusion, the NAC-like TF OsNTL5 functions as a transcriptional repressor to suppress flowering in rice as an upstream factor of Ehd1
