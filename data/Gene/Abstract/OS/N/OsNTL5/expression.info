OsNTL5	 A preferential expression of a membrane-bound NAC-like TF OsNTL5 in developing leaves and panicles of rice indicated to us its putative role in flowering |  Expression of flowering genes responsible for day length signals such as Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Heading Date 3a (Hd3a), and Rice Flowering Locus T1 (RFT1) was significantly changed in the overexpression lines of OsNTL5<U+2206>C-VP, OsNTL5<U+2206>C, and OsNTL5<U+2206>C-SRDX as analyzed by Quantitative Real-time PCR |  ChIP-qPCR and rice protoplasts assays indicate that OsNTL5 directly binds to the promoter of Ehd1 and negatively regulates the expression of Ehd1, which shows antagonistic photoperiodic expression patterns of OsNTL5 in a 24-h SD cycle	 Expression of flowering genes responsible for day length signals such as Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Heading Date 3a (Hd3a), and Rice Flowering Locus T1 (RFT1) was significantly changed in the overexpression lines of OsNTL5<U+2206>C-VP, OsNTL5<U+2206>C, and OsNTL5<U+2206>C-SRDX as analyzed by Quantitative Real-time PCR
