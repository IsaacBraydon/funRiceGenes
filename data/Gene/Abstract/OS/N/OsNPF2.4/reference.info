NA	Rice nitrate transporter OsNPF2.4 functions in low-affinity acquisition and long-distance transport	2014	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement and MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Lower-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, PR China.	Plant proteins belonging to the NPF (formerly NRT1/PTR) family are well represented in every genome and function in transporting a wide variety of substrates. In this study, we showed that rice OsNPF2.4 is located in the plasma membrane and is expressed mainly in the epidermis, xylem parenchyma, and phloem companion cells. Functional analysis in oocytes showed that OsNPF2.4 is a pH-dependent, low-affinity NO3- transporter. Short-term 15NO3- influx rate, long-term NO3- acquisition by root, and upward transfer from root to shoot were decreased by disruption of OsNPF2.4 and increased by OsNPF2.4 overexpression under high NO3- supply. Moreover, the redistribution of NO3- in the mutants in comparison with the wild type from the oldest leaf to other organs, particularly to N-starved roots, was dramatically changed. Knockout of OsNPF2.4 decreased rice growth and potassium (K) concentration in xylem sap, root, culm, and sheath, but increased the shoot:root ratio of tissue K under higher NO3-. We conclude that OsNPF2.4 functions in acquisition and long-distance transport of NO3-, and that altering its expression has an indirect effect on K recycling between the root and shoot.
NA	Conserved Imprinted Genes between Intra-Subspecies and Inter-Subspecies Are Involved in Energy Metabolism and Seed Development in Rice	2020	Int J Mol Sci	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon in which a subset of genes express dependent on the origin of their parents. In plants, it is unclear whether imprinted genes are conserved between subspecies in rice. Here we identified imprinted genes from embryo and endosperm 5-7 days after pollination from three pairs of reciprocal hybrids, including inter-subspecies, japonica intra-subspecies, and indica intra-subspecies reciprocal hybrids. A total of 914 imprinted genes, including 546 in inter-subspecies hybrids, 211 in japonica intra-subspecies hybrids, and 286 in indica intra-subspecies hybrids. In general, the number of maternally expressed genes (MEGs) is more than paternally expressed genes (PEGs). Moreover, imprinted genes tend to be in mini clusters. The number of shared genes by R9N (reciprocal crosses between 9311 and Nipponbare) and R9Z (reciprocal crosses between 9311 and Zhenshan 97), R9N and RZN (reciprocal crosses between Zhonghua11 and Nipponbare), R9Z and RZN was 72, 46, and 16. These genes frequently involved in energy metabolism and seed development. Five imprinted genes (Os01g0151700, Os07g0103100, Os10g0340600, Os11g0679700, and Os12g0632800) are commonly detected in all three pairs of reciprocal hybrids and were validated by RT-PCR sequencing. Gene editing of two imprinted genes revealed that both genes conferred grain filling. Moreover, 15 and 27 imprinted genes with diverse functions in rice were shared with Arabidopsis and maize, respectively. This study provided valuable resources for identification of imprinting genes in rice or even in cereals.
NA	The Amino Acid Transporter OsAAP4 Contributes to Rice Tillering and Grain Yield by Regulating Neutral Amino Acid Allocation through Two Splicing Variants	2021	Rice (N Y)	Key Laboratory of Plant Resource Conservation and Germplasm Innovation in Mountainous Region (Ministry of Education), College of Agricultural Sciences, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, China. zmfang@gzu.edu.cn.	Background: Amino acids, which are transported by amino acid transporters, are the major forms of organic nitrogen utilized by higher plants. Among the 19 Amino Acid Permease transporters (AAPs) in rice, only a small number of these genes have been reported to influence rice growth and development. However, whether other OsAAPs are responsible for rice growth and development is unclear.  Results: In this study, we demonstrate that OsAAP4 promoter sequences are divergent between Indica and Japonica, with higher expression in the former, which produces more tillers and higher grain yield than does Japonica. Overexpression of two different splicing variants of OsAAP4 in Japonica ZH11 significantly increased rice tillering and grain yield as result of enhancing the neutral amino acid concentrations of Val, Pro, Thr and Leu. OsAAP4 RNA interference (RNAi) and mutant lines displayed opposite trends compared with overexpresing (OE) lines. In addition, exogenous Val or Pro at 0.5 mM significantly promoted the bud outgrowth of lines overexpressing an OsAAP4a splicing variant compared with ZH11, and exogenous Val or Pro at 2.0 mM significantly enhanced the bud outgrowth of lines overexpressing splicing variant OsAAP4b compared with ZH11. Of note, the results of a protoplast amino acid-uptake assay showed that Val or Pro at different concentrations was specifically transported and accumulated in these overexpressing lines. Transcriptome analysis further demonstrated that OsAAP4 may affect nitrogen transport and metabolism, and auxin, cytokinin signaling in regulating rice tillering.  Conclusion: Our results suggested that OsAAP4 contributes to rice tiller and grain yield by regulating neutral amino acid allocation through two different splicing variants and that OsAAP4 might have potential applications in rice breeding.
