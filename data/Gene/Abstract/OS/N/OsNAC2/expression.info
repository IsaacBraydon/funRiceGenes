OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2	 In addition, the levels of GAs decreased in OsNAC2 overexpression plants, but increased in OsNAC2 knockdown plants, compared with the wild type	 In addition, the levels of GAs decreased in OsNAC2 overexpression plants, but increased in OsNAC2 knockdown plants, compared with the wild type
OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	 With reduced yields under drought conditions at the flowering stage, OsNAC2 overexpression lines had lower resistance to high salt and drought conditions |  A microarray assay indicated that many ABA-dependent stress-related genes were down-regulated in OsNAC2 overexpression lines	 With reduced yields under drought conditions at the flowering stage, OsNAC2 overexpression lines had lower resistance to high salt and drought conditions |  A microarray assay indicated that many ABA-dependent stress-related genes were down-regulated in OsNAC2 overexpression lines
OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	Overexpression of OsmiR164b-resistant OsNAC2 improves plant architecture and grain yield in rice. |  Overexpression of miR164b or down-regulation of OsNAC2 led to decreased panicle length and grain yield in the main panicle |  In summary, we identified an efficient new strategy to substantially increase rice yield and improve plant architecture through over-expression of OsmiR164b-resistant OsNAC2	Overexpression of OsmiR164b-resistant OsNAC2 improves plant architecture and grain yield in rice. |  Overexpression of miR164b or down-regulation of OsNAC2 led to decreased panicle length and grain yield in the main panicle
OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	 Here, we demonstrated a rice NAC (NAM-ATAF-CUC) transcription factor, OsNAC2, the overexpression of which increases the ethylene sensitivity in rice roots during the seedling period |  Further study proved that OsNAC2 directly activates the expressions of OsACO and OsACO3, enhancing ethylene synthesis, and then retards seedling establishment	 Here, we demonstrated a rice NAC (NAM-ATAF-CUC) transcription factor, OsNAC2, the overexpression of which increases the ethylene sensitivity in rice roots during the seedling period
