D35|OsKOS3|OsKO2	OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsNAC2 encoding a NAC transcription factor affects plant height through mediating the gibberellic acid pathway in rice.	Dual-luciferase reporter analyses, yeast one-hybrid assays and ChIP-qPCR suggested that OsNAC2 directly interacted with the promoter of OsEATB and OsKO2

OsLEA3|OsLEA3-1	OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	The NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC2 regulates ABA-dependent genes and abiotic stress tolerance in rice.	We further confirmed that OsNAC2 directly binds the promoters of LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT 3 (OsLEA3) and Stress-Activated Protein Kinases 1 (OsSAPK1), two marker genes in the abiotic stress and ABA response pathways, respectively
OsABA1|OSZEP1	OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	A Rice NAC Transcription Factor Promotes Leaf Senescence via ABA Biosynthesis.	 Moreover, ectopic expression of OsNAC2 leads to an increase in ABA levels via directly upregulating expression of ABA biosynthetic genes (OsNCED3 and OsZEP1) as well as downregulating the ABA catabolic gene (OsABA8ox1)

OsAP37	OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsNAC2 positively affects salt-induced cell death and binds to the OsAP37 and OsCOX11 promoters.	OsNAC2 positively affects salt-induced cell death and binds to the OsAP37 and OsCOX11 promoters.
OsAP37	OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsNAC2 positively affects salt-induced cell death and binds to the OsAP37 and OsCOX11 promoters.	 Moreover, the results of quantitative real-time PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase, and yeast one-hybrid assays indicated that OsNAC2 targeted genes encoding an ROS scavenger (OsCOX11) and a caspase-like protease (OsAP37)
OsGORK|OsK5.2	OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsNAC2 positively affects salt-induced cell death and binds to the OsAP37 and OsCOX11 promoters.	 Furthermore, K+-efflux channels (OsGORK and OsSKOR) were obviously activated by OsNAC2

OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsWRKY5	OsWRKY5 Promotes Rice Leaf Senescence via Senescence-Associated NAC and Abscisic Acid Biosynthesis Pathway.	 Furthermore, RT-qPCR and yeast one-hybrid analysis demonstrated that OsWRKY5 indirectly upregulates the expression of senescence-associated NAM/ATAF1/2/CUC2 (NAC) genes including OsNAP and OsNAC2
