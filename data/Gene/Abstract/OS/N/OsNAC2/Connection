D35|OsKOS3|OsKO2	OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsNAC2 encoding a NAC transcription factor affects plant height through mediating the gibberellic acid pathway in rice.	 Dual-luciferase reporter analyses, yeast one-hybrid assays and ChIP-qPCR suggested that OsNAC2 directly interacted with the promoter of OsEATB and OsKO2

OsLEA3|OsLEA3-1	OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	The NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC2 regulates ABA-dependent genes and abiotic stress tolerance in rice.	 We further confirmed that OsNAC2 directly binds the promoters of LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT 3 (OsLEA3) and Stress-Activated Protein Kinases 1 (OsSAPK1), two marker genes in the abiotic stress and ABA response pathways, respectively
