For a better understanding of shoot branching in rice (Oryza sativa), a rice activation-tagging library was screened for mutations in tiller development. Here, an activation-tagging mutant Ostil1 (Oryza sativa tillering1) was characterized, which showed increased tillers, enlarged tiller angle and semidwarf phenotype. Flanking sequence was obtained by plasmid rescue. RNA-interfering and overexpression transgenic rice plants were produced using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The mutant phenotype was cosegregated with the reallocation of Ds element, and the flanking region of the reallocated Ds element was identified as part of the OsNAC2 gene. Northern analysis showed that expression of OsNAC2 was greatly induced in the mutant plants. Transgenic rice overexpressing the OsNAC2 resulted in recapture of the mutant phenotype, while downregulation of OsNAC2 in the Ostil1 mutant through RNA interfering (RNAi) complemented the mutant phenotype, confirming that the Ostil1 was caused by overexpression of OsNAC2. Overexpression of OsNAC2 regulates shoot branching in rice. Overexpression of OsNAC2 contributes tiller bud outgrowth, but does not affect tiller bud initiation. This suggests that OsNAC2 has potential utility for improving plant structure for higher light-use efficiency and higher yield potential in rice.
NA	OsNAC2 encoding a NAC transcription factor affects plant height through mediating the gibberellic acid pathway in rice.	2015	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Genetics, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, China.	Plant height and flowering time are key agronomic traits affecting yield in rice (Oryza sativa). In this study, we investigated the functions in rice growth and development of OsNAC2, encoding a NAC transcription factor in rice. Transgenic plants that constitutively expressed OsNAC2 had shorter internodes, shorter spikelets, and were more insensitive to gibberellic acid (GA3 ). In addition, the levels of GAs decreased in OsNAC2 overexpression plants, but increased in OsNAC2 knockdown plants, compared with the wild type. Moreover, flowering was delayed for approximately 5 days in transgenic lines. The transcription of Hd3a, a flowering-time related gene, was suppressed in transgenic lines. In addition, transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing OsNAC2 were also more insensitive to GA3 . The expression levels of GA biosynthetic genes OsKO2 and OsKAO were repressed. The expression of OsSLRL, encoding a repressor in the GA signal pathway, and OsEATB, which encodes a repressor of GA biosynthesis, were both enhanced. Western blotting indicated that DELLA also accumulated at the protein level. Dual-luciferase reporter analyses, yeast one-hybrid assays and ChIP-qPCR suggested that OsNAC2 directly interacted with the promoter of OsEATB and OsKO2. Taken together, we proposed that OsNAC2 is a negative regulator of the plant height and flowering time, which acts by directly regulating key genes of the GA pathway in rice.

NA	The NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC2 regulates ABA-dependent genes and abiotic stress tolerance in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Genetics, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Science, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China.	Plants can perceive environmental changes and respond to external stressors. Here, we show that OsNAC2, a member of the NAC transcription factor family, was strongly induced by ABA and osmotic stressors such as drought and high salt. With reduced yields under drought conditions at the flowering stage, OsNAC2 overexpression lines had lower resistance to high salt and drought conditions. RNAi plants showed enhanced tolerance to high salinity and drought stress at both the vegetative and flowering stages. Furthermore, RNAi plants had improved yields after drought stress. A microarray assay indicated that many ABA-dependent stress-related genes were down-regulated in OsNAC2 overexpression lines. We further confirmed that OsNAC2 directly binds the promoters of LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT 3 (OsLEA3) and Stress-Activated Protein Kinases 1 (OsSAPK1), two marker genes in the abiotic stress and ABA response pathways, respectively. Our results suggest that in rice OsNAC2 regulates both abiotic stress responses and ABA-mediated responses, and acts at the junction between the ABA and abiotic stress pathways.
NA	A Rice NAC Transcription Factor Promotes Leaf Senescence via ABA Biosynthesis.	2017	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Genetics, Fudan University CITY: Shanghai China [CN].	It has been well known that ABA induced leaf senescence and premature leaf senescence negatively affects the yield of rice. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this relationship, especially the upstream transcriptional network that modulates ABA level during leaf senescence, remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate a rice NAC transcription factor, OsNAC2, participated in ABA-induced leaf senescence. Overexpression of OsNAC2 dramatically accelerated leaf senescence, whereas its knockdown lines showed a delay in leaf senescence. ChIP-qPCR, dual-luciferase and yeast one hybrid assays demonstrated OsNAC2 directly activates expression of chlorophyll degradation genes, OsSGR and OsNYC3. Moreover, ectopic expression of OsNAC2 leads to an increase in ABA levels via directly upregulating expression of ABA biosynthetic genes (OsNCED3 and OsZEP1) as well as downregulating the ABA catabolic gene (OsABA8ox1). Interestingly, OsNAC2 is upregulated by a lower level of ABA but downregulated by a higher level of ABA, indicating a feedback repression of OsNAC2 by ABA. Additionally, reduced OsNAC2 expression leads to about 10% increase in the grain yield of RNAi lines. The novel ABA-NAC-SAGs regulatory module might provide a new insight into the molecular action of ABA to enhance leaf senescence, and elucidates the transcriptional network of ABA production during leaf senescence in rice.
NA	Overexpression of OsmiR164b-resistant OsNAC2 improves plant architecture and grain yield in rice.	2018	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources; College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.	Plant architecture is a major target of rice (Oryza sativa) breeding and selection, but the underlying regulatory networks remain unclear. Here, we overexpressed a OsNAC2 mutant (OErN) that cannot be cleaved by the microRNA miR164b. OErN plants had better plant architecture, longer panicles, and produced more grains. The parental line averaged 12.2 primary and 31.5 secondary branches in the main panicles; two OErN lines averaged 15.0 and 15.2 primary, and 41.5 and 44.3 secondary branches. In large-scale field trials, OErN plants produced at least 58.62% more total grain (by weight) compared with the parental line. They also had more large and small vascular bundles in the stem internodes and leaves. Overexpression of miR164b or down-regulation of OsNAC2 led to decreased panicle length and grain yield in the main panicle. The OErN plants showed significant up-regulation of the grain number and plant architecture related genes IPA1 and DEP1. A survey of more than 3,000 rice varieties found no natural mutations in the miR164b binding site of OsNAC2. OErN increased yield in Nipponbare and the commonly grown Yangyujing 3 cultivars. In summary, we identified an efficient new strategy to substantially increase rice yield and improve plant architecture through over-expression of OsmiR164b-resistant OsNAC2.
NA	OsNAC2 positively affects salt-induced cell death and binds to the OsAP37 and OsCOX11 promoters.	2018	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Genetics, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, China.	Plant development and adaptations to environmental stresses are intimately associated with programmed cell death (PCD). Although some of the mechanisms regulating PCD [e.g., accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)] are common among responses to different abiotic stresses, the pathways mediating salt-induced PCD remain largely uncharacterized. We herein report that overexpressing OsNAC2, which encodes a plant-specific transcription factor, promotes salt-induced cell death accompanied by the loss of plasma membrane integrity, nuclear DNA fragmentation, and changes to caspase-like activity. In OsNAC2-knockdown lines, cell death was markedly decreased in response to severe salt stress. Additionally, OsNAC2 expression was enhanced in rice seedlings exposed to a high NaCl concentration. Moreover, the results of quantitative real-time PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase, and yeast one-hybrid assays indicated that OsNAC2 targeted genes encoding an ROS scavenger (OsCOX11) and a caspase-like protease (OsAP37). Furthermore, K+-efflux channels (OsGORK and OsSKOR) were obviously activated by OsNAC2. Overall, our results suggest that OsNAC2 accelerates NaCl-induced PCD and provide new insights into the mechanisms affecting ROS accumulation, plant caspase-like activity, and K+efflux.

NA	OsNAC2 integrates auxin and cytokinin pathways to modulate rice root development.	2019	Plant Biotechnol J	Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, China.	The rice root system is important for growth. The crosstalk between auxin and cytokinin mediates root initiation and elongation. However, it remains unclear how the transcriptional network upstream of the auxin and cytokinin signalling pathways determines root development. Here, we observed that the knockdown of OsNAC2, which encodes a NAC transcription factor, increased the primary root length and the number of crown roots. OsNAC2 predominantly expressed in primary root tips, crown roots and lateral root primordia, implying it influences root development. Molecular analyses revealed that the expressions of auxin- and cytokinin-responsive genes were affected in OsNAC2-overexpressing (OsNAC2-OX; ON7 and ON11), RNA interference (OsNAC2-RNAi; RNAi25 and RNAi31) and CRISPR/Cas9 plants. Additionally, OsNAC2 can directly bind to the promoters of IAA inactivation-related genes (GH3.6 and GH3.8), an IAA signalling-related gene (OsARF25), and a cytokinin oxidase gene (OsCKX4). Furthermore, genetic analysis of ON11/osgh3.6 and RNAi31/osckx4 homozygote confirmed that OsCKX4 and OsGH3.6 functioned downstream of OsNAC2. The mRNA levels of CROWN ROOTLESS (CRL) genes and cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) genes increased in OsNAC2-RNAi and OsNAC2-cas9 lines while reduced in OsNAC2-OX lines. Thus, we describe that OsNAC2 functions as an upstream integrator of auxin and cytokinin signals that affect CRL and CDK production to regulate cell division during root development. This novel auxin-OsNAC2-cytokinin model should provide a new insight into the understanding of NAC TFs and crosstalk of auxin and cytokinin pathway, and can be potentially applied in agriculture to enhance rice yields by genetic approaches.
NA	Overexpression of a microRNA-targeted NAC transcription factor improves drought and salt tolerance in Rice via ABA-mediated pathways.	2019	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	The NAC (NAM, AFAT, and CUC) transcription factors play critical roles in rice (Oryza sativa) development and stress regulation. Overexpressing a microRNA (miR164b)-resistant OsNAC2 mutant gene, which generates transcripts that cannot be targeted by miR164b, improves rice plant architecture and yield; however, the performance of these mOsNAC2-overexpressing lines, named ZUOErN3 and ZUOErN4, under abiotic stress conditions such as drought have not yet been fully characterized.In this study, we showed that the germination of ZUOErN3 and ZUOErN4 seeds was delayed in comparison with the wild-type (WT) seeds, although the final germination rates of all lines were over 95%. The quantification of the endogenous ABA levels revealed that the germinating mOsNAC2-overexpressing seeds had elevated ABA levels, which resulted in their slower germination. The mOsNAC2-overexpressing plants were significantly more drought tolerance than the WT plants, with the survival rate increasing from 11.2% in the WT to nearly 70% in ZUOErN3 and ZUOErN4 plants after a drought treatment. Salt (NaCl) tolerance was also increased in the ZUOErN3 and ZUOErN4 plants due to significantly increased ABA levels. A reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis showed a significant increase in the expression of the ABA biosynthesis genes OsNCED1 and OsNCED3 in the mOsNAC2-overexpressing lines, and the expression levels of the stress-responsive genes OsP5CS1, OsLEA3, and OsRab16 were significantly increased in these plants. Moreover, OsNAC2 directly interacted with the promoters of OsLEA3 and OsNCED3 in yeast one-hybrid assays.Taken together, our results show that OsNAC2 plays a positive regulatory role in drought and salt tolerance in rice through ABA-mediated pathways.
NA	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	2020	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530004, China.	Background: Salt stress threatens crop yields all over the world. Many NAC transcription factors have been reported to be involved in different abiotic stress responses, but it remains unclear how loss of these transcription factors alters the transcriptomes of plants. Previous reports have demonstrated that overexpression of OsNAC45 enhances salt and drought tolerance in rice, and that OsNAC45 may regulate the expression of two specific genes, OsPM1 and OsLEA3-1.  Results: Here, we found that ABA repressed, and NaCl promoted, the expression of OsNAC45 in roots. Immunostaining showed that OsNAC45 was localized in all root cells and was mainly expressed in the stele. Loss of OsNAC45 decreased the sensitivity of rice plants to ABA and over-expressing this gene had the opposite effect, which demonstrated that OsNAC45 played an important role during ABA signal responses. Knockout of OsNAC45 also resulted in more ROS accumulation in roots and increased sensitivity of rice to salt stress. Transcriptome sequencing a
NA	OsNAC2 Is Involved in Multiple Hormonal Pathways to Mediate Germination of Rice Seeds and Establishment of Seedling	2021	Front Plant Sci	Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, China.	The germination of seeds and establishment of seedling are the preconditions of plant growth and are antagonistically regulated by multiple phytohormones, e.g., ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA), and gibberellic acid (GA). However, the interactions between these phytohormones and their upstream transcriptional regulation during the seed and seedling growth in rice remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated a rice NAC (NAM-ATAF-CUC) transcription factor, OsNAC2, the overexpression of which increases the ethylene sensitivity in rice roots during the seedling period. Further study proved that OsNAC2 directly activates the expressions of OsACO and OsACO3, enhancing ethylene synthesis, and then retards seedling establishment. Moreover, OsNAC2 delays the germination of seeds and coleoptile growth through the ABA pathway instead of the ethylene and GA pathway, by targeting the promoters of OsNCED3, OsZEP1, and OsABA8ox1. We also found that OsNAC2 regulates downstream targets in a time-dependent manner by binding to the promoter of OsKO2 in the seedling period but not in the germination stage. Our finding enriched the regulatory network of ethylene, ABA, and GA in the germination of rice seeds and seedling growth, and uncovered new insights into the difference of transcription factors in targeting their downstream components.
NA	Variations in OsSPL10 confer drought tolerance by directly regulating OsNAC2 expression and ROS production in rice.	2022	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology/Beijing Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.	Drought is a major factor restricting the production of rice (Oryza sativa L.). The identification of natural variants for drought stress-related genes is an important step toward developing genetically improved rice varieties. Here, we characterized a member of the SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) family, OsSPL10, as a transcription factor involved in the regulation of drought tolerance in rice. OsSPL10 appears to play a vital role in drought tolerance by controlling ROS production and stomatal movements. Haplotype and allele frequency analyses of OsSPL10 indicated that most upland rice and improved lowland rice varieties harbor the OsSPL10 (Hap1) allele, while the OsSPL10 (Hap2) allele was mainly present in lowland and landrace rice varieties. Importantly, we demonstrated that the varieties with the OsSPL10 (Hap1) allele show low expression levels of OsSPL10 and its downstream gene, OsNAC2, which decreases the expression of OsAP37 and increases the expression of OsCOX11, thus preventing ROS accumulation and PCD. Furthermore, knockdown or knockout of OsSPL10 induces fast stomatal closure and prevents water loss, thereby improving drought tolerance in rice. Based on these observations, we propose that OsSPL10 confers drought tolerance by regulating OsNAC2 expression and that OsSPL10 (Hap1) could be a valuable haplotype for genetic improvement of drought tolerance in rice.
