For a better understanding of shoot branching in rice (Oryza sativa), a rice activation-tagging library was screened for mutations in tiller development. Here, an activation-tagging mutant Ostil1 (Oryza sativa tillering1) was characterized, which showed increased tillers, enlarged tiller angle and semidwarf phenotype. Flanking sequence was obtained by plasmid rescue. RNA-interfering and overexpression transgenic rice plants were produced using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The mutant phenotype was cosegregated with the reallocation of Ds element, and the flanking region of the reallocated Ds element was identified as part of the OsNAC2 gene. Northern analysis showed that expression of OsNAC2 was greatly induced in the mutant plants. Transgenic rice overexpressing the OsNAC2 resulted in recapture of the mutant phenotype, while downregulation of OsNAC2 in the Ostil1 mutant through RNA interfering (RNAi) complemented the mutant phenotype, confirming that the Ostil1 was caused by overexpression of OsNAC2. Overexpression of OsNAC2 regulates shoot branching in rice. Overexpression of OsNAC2 contributes tiller bud outgrowth, but does not affect tiller bud initiation. This suggests that OsNAC2 has potential utility for improving plant structure for higher light-use efficiency and higher yield potential in rice.
NA	OsNAC2 encoding a NAC transcription factor affects plant height through mediating the gibberellic acid pathway in rice.	2015	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Genetics, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, China.	Plant height and flowering time are key agronomic traits affecting yield in rice (Oryza sativa). In this study, we investigated the functions in rice growth and development of OsNAC2, encoding a NAC transcription factor in rice. Transgenic plants that constitutively expressed OsNAC2 had shorter internodes, shorter spikelets, and were more insensitive to gibberellic acid (GA3 ). In addition, the levels of GAs decreased in OsNAC2 overexpression plants, but increased in OsNAC2 knockdown plants, compared with the wild type. Moreover, flowering was delayed for approximately 5 days in transgenic lines. The transcription of Hd3a, a flowering-time related gene, was suppressed in transgenic lines. In addition, transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing OsNAC2 were also more insensitive to GA3 . The expression levels of GA biosynthetic genes OsKO2 and OsKAO were repressed. The expression of OsSLRL, encoding a repressor in the GA signal pathway, and OsEATB, which encodes a repressor of GA biosynthesis, were both enhanced. Western blotting indicated that DELLA also accumulated at the protein level. Dual-luciferase reporter analyses, yeast one-hybrid assays and ChIP-qPCR suggested that OsNAC2 directly interacted with the promoter of OsEATB and OsKO2. Taken together, we proposed that OsNAC2 is a negative regulator of the plant height and flowering time, which acts by directly regulating key genes of the GA pathway in rice.

NA	The NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC2 regulates ABA-dependent genes and abiotic stress tolerance in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Genetics, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Science, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China.	Plants can perceive environmental changes and respond to external stressors. Here, we show that OsNAC2, a member of the NAC transcription factor family, was strongly induced by ABA and osmotic stressors such as drought and high salt. With reduced yields under drought conditions at the flowering stage, OsNAC2 overexpression lines had lower resistance to high salt and drought conditions. RNAi plants showed enhanced tolerance to high salinity and drought stress at both the vegetative and flowering stages. Furthermore, RNAi plants had improved yields after drought stress. A microarray assay indicated that many ABA-dependent stress-related genes were down-regulated in OsNAC2 overexpression lines. We further confirmed that OsNAC2 directly binds the promoters of LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT 3 (OsLEA3) and Stress-Activated Protein Kinases 1 (OsSAPK1), two marker genes in the abiotic stress and ABA response pathways, respectively. Our results suggest that in rice OsNAC2 regulates both abiotic stress responses and ABA-mediated responses, and acts at the junction between the ABA and abiotic stress pathways.
NA	A Rice NAC Transcription Factor Promotes Leaf Senescence via ABA Biosynthesis.	2017	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Genetics, Fudan University CITY: Shanghai China [CN].	It has been well known that ABA induced leaf senescence and premature leaf senescence negatively affects the yield of rice. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this relationship, especially the upstream transcriptional network that modulates ABA level during leaf senescence, remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate a rice NAC transcription factor, OsNAC2, participated in ABA-induced leaf senescence. Overexpression of OsNAC2 dramatically accelerated leaf senescence, whereas its knockdown lines showed a delay in leaf senescence. ChIP-qPCR, dual-luciferase and yeast one hybrid assays demonstrated OsNAC2 directly activates expression of chlorophyll degradation genes, OsSGR and OsNYC3. Moreover, ectopic expression of OsNAC2 leads to an increase in ABA levels via directly upregulating expression of ABA biosynthetic genes (OsNCED3 and OsZEP1) as well as downregulating the ABA catabolic gene (OsABA8ox1). Interestingly, OsNAC2 is upregulated by a lower level of ABA but downregulated by a higher level of ABA, indicating a feedback repression of OsNAC2 by ABA. Additionally, reduced OsNAC2 expression leads to about 10% increase in the grain yield of RNAi lines. The novel ABA-NAC-SAGs regulatory module might provide a new insight into the molecular action of ABA to enhance leaf senescence, and elucidates the transcriptional network of ABA production during leaf senescence in rice.
NA	Overexpression of OsmiR164b-resistant OsNAC2 improves plant architecture and grain yield in rice.	2018	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources; College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.	Plant architecture is a major target of rice (Oryza sativa) breeding and selection, but the underlying regulatory networks remain unclear. Here, we overexpressed a OsNAC2 mutant (OErN) that cannot be cleaved by the microRNA miR164b. OErN plants had better plant architecture, longer panicles, and produced more grains. The parental line averaged 12.2 primary and 31.5 secondary branches in the main panicles; two OErN lines averaged 15.0 and 15.2 primary, and 41.5 and 44.3 secondary branches. In large-scale field trials, OErN plants produced at least 58.62% more total grain (by weight) compared with the parental line. They also had more large and small vascular bundles in the stem internodes and leaves. Overexpression of miR164b or down-regulation of OsNAC2 led to decreased panicle length and grain yield in the main panicle. The OErN plants showed significant up-regulation of the grain number and plant architecture related genes IPA1 and DEP1. A survey of more than 3,000 rice varieties found no natural mutations in the miR164b binding site of OsNAC2. OErN increased yield in Nipponbare and the commonly grown Yangyujing 3 cultivars. In summary, we identified an efficient new strategy to substantially increase rice yield and improve plant architecture through over-expression of OsmiR164b-resistant OsNAC2.
NA	OsNAC2 positively affects salt-induced cell death and binds to the OsAP37 and OsCOX11 promoters.	2018	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Genetics, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, China.	Plant development and adaptations to environmental stresses are intimately associated with programmed cell death (PCD). Although some of the mechanisms regulating PCD [e.g., accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)] are common among responses to different abiotic stresses, the pathways mediating salt-induced PCD remain largely uncharacterized. We herein report that overexpressing OsNAC2, which encodes a plant-specific transcription factor, promotes salt-induced cell death accompanied by the loss of plasma membrane integrity, nuclear DNA fragmentation, and changes to caspase-like activity. In OsNAC2-knockdown lines, cell death was markedly decreased in response to severe salt stress. Additionally, OsNAC2 expression was enhanced in rice seedlings exposed to a high NaCl concentration. Moreover, the results of quantitative real-time PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase, and yeast one-hybrid assays indicated that OsNAC2 targeted genes encoding an ROS scavenger (OsCOX11) and a caspase-like protease (OsAP37). Furthermore, K+-efflux channels (OsGORK and OsSKOR) were obviously activated by OsNAC2. Overall, our results suggest that OsNAC2 accelerates NaCl-induced PCD and provide new insights into the mechanisms affecting ROS accumulation, plant caspase-like activity, and K+efflux.

NA	OsNAC2 integrates auxin and cytokinin pathways to modulate rice root development.	2019	Plant Biotechnol J	Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, China.	The rice root system is important for growth. The crosstalk between auxin and cytokinin mediates root initiation and elongation. However, it remains unclear how the transcriptional network upstream of the auxin and cytokinin signalling pathways determines root development. Here, we observed that the knockdown of OsNAC2, which encodes a NAC transcription factor, increased the primary root length and the number of crown roots. OsNAC2 predominantly expressed in primary root tips, crown roots and lateral root primordia, implying it influences root development. Molecular analyses revealed that the expressions of auxin- and cytokinin-responsive genes were affected in OsNAC2-overexpressing (OsNAC2-OX; ON7 and ON11), RNA interference (OsNAC2-RNAi; RNAi25 and RNAi31) and CRISPR/Cas9 plants. Additionally, OsNAC2 can directly bind to the promoters of IAA inactivation-related genes (GH3.6 and GH3.8), an IAA signalling-related gene (OsARF25), and a cytokinin oxidase gene (OsCKX4). Furthermore, genetic analysis of ON11/osgh3.6 and RNAi31/osckx4 homozygote confirmed that OsCKX4 and OsGH3.6 functioned downstream of OsNAC2. The mRNA levels of CROWN ROOTLESS (CRL) genes and cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) genes increased in OsNAC2-RNAi and OsNAC2-cas9 lines while reduced in OsNAC2-OX lines. Thus, we describe that OsNAC2 functions as an upstream integrator of auxin and cytokinin signals that affect CRL and CDK production to regulate cell division during root development. This novel auxin-OsNAC2-cytokinin model should provide a new insight into the understanding of NAC TFs and crosstalk of auxin and cytokinin pathway, and can be potentially applied in agriculture to enhance rice yields by genetic approaches.
