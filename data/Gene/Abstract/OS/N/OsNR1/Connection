OsABA8ox1	OsNR1	NLP2-NR Module Associated NO Is Involved in Regulating Seed Germination in Rice under Salt Stress.	 Transient trans-activation assays further revealed NLP2 can significantly activate the expression of OsABA8ox1 and OsNR1, suggesting that NLP2 activates expression of ABA catabolism gene directly or indirectly via NR-associated NO
DST|WL1|HST1	OsNR1	Decreasing nitrogen assimilation under drought stress by suppressing DST-mediated activation of Nitrate Reductase 1.2 in rice.	 Here, we report that a zinc-finger transcription factor, drought and salt tolerance (DST), controls nitrate assimilation in rice by regulating the expression of OsNR1
DST|WL1|HST1	OsNR1	Decreasing nitrogen assimilation under drought stress by suppressing DST-mediated activation of Nitrate Reductase 1.2 in rice.	 Further study revealed that DST is required for full nitrate reductase activity in rice and directly regulates the expression of OsNR1
