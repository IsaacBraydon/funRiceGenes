OsNSP1	OsNSP2	Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2	Legume GRAS (GAI, RGA, SCR)-type transcription factors NODULATION SIGNALING PATHWAY1 (NSP1) and NSP2 are essential for rhizobium Nod factor-induced nodulation
OsNSP1	OsNSP2	Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2	However, legume NSP1 and NSP2 can be functionally replaced by nonlegume orthologs, including rice (Oryza sativa) NSP1 and NSP2, indicating that both proteins are functionally conserved in higher plants
OsNSP1	OsNSP2	Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2	Here, we show that NSP1 and NSP2 are indispensable for strigolactone (SL) biosynthesis in the legume Medicago truncatula and in rice
OsNSP1	OsNSP2	Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2	The disturbed SL biosynthesis in nsp1 nsp2 mutant backgrounds correlates with reduced expression of DWARF27, a gene essential for SL biosynthesis
OsNSP1	OsNSP2	Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2	Therefore, we conclude that regulation of SL biosynthesis by NSP1 and NSP2 is an ancestral function conserved in higher plants
OsNSP1	OsNSP2	Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2	NSP1 and NSP2 are single-copy genes in legumes, which implies that both proteins fulfill dual regulatory functions to control downstream targets after rhizobium-induced signaling as well as SL biosynthesis in nonsymbiotic conditions
OsNSP1	OsNSP2	Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2	Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2
OsNSP1	OsNSP2	Function of GRAS proteins in root nodule symbiosis is retained in homologs of a non-legume, rice	In this study, we demonstrated that their homologs, OsNSP1 and OsNSP2, from rice are able to fully rescue the RN symbiosis-defective phenotypes of the mutants of corresponding genes in the model legume, Lotus japonicus
OsNSP1	OsNSP2	Function of GRAS proteins in root nodule symbiosis is retained in homologs of a non-legume, rice	Two GRAS-domain transcription factors, NSP1 and NSP2, have been shown to be required for RN symbiosis, but not for AM symbiosis
OsGRF7	OsNSP2	Rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 7 controls tiller number by regulating strigolactone synthesis	 Here, we report that OsGRF7 directly targets the promoter of the NODULATION SIGNALING PATHWAY2 (OsNSP2), a key factor involving in the strigolactone synthesis
OsGRF7	OsNSP2	Rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 7 controls tiller number by regulating strigolactone synthesis	 Correspondingly, OsGRF7 alters the expression level of OsNSP2 and the endogenous strigolactone content, which rendered repression of the outgrowth of the axillary buds
