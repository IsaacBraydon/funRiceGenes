OsNTL3	 Loss-of-function mutation of OsNTL3 confers heat sensitivity while inducible expression of the truncated form of OsNTL3 without the transmembrane domain increases heat tolerance in rice seedlings |  RNA-Seq analysis revealed that OsNTL3 regulates the expression of genes involved in ER protein folding and other processes |  Interestingly, OsNTL3 directly binds to OsbZIP74 promoter and regulates its expression in response to heat stress
