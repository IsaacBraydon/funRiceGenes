OsbZIP50|OsbZIP74	OsNTL3	A membrane-associated NAC transcription factor OsNTL3 is involved in thermotolerance in rice.	 Interestingly, OsNTL3 directly binds to OsbZIP74 promoter and regulates its expression in response to heat stress
OsbZIP50|OsbZIP74	OsNTL3	A membrane-associated NAC transcription factor OsNTL3 is involved in thermotolerance in rice.	 In turn, up-regulation of OsNTL3 by heat stress is dependent on OsbZIP74
OsbZIP50|OsbZIP74	OsNTL3	A membrane-associated NAC transcription factor OsNTL3 is involved in thermotolerance in rice.	 Thus, our work reveals the important role of OsNTL3 in thermotolerance, and a regulatory circuit mediated by OsbZIP74 and OsNTL3 in communications among ER, plasma membrane and nucleus under heat stress conditions
