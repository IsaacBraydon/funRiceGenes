OsNCED4	Heterologous expression of rice 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 4 (OsNCED4) in Arabidopsis confers sugar oversensitivity and drought tolerance. | Heterologous expression of OsNCED4 in Arabidopsis increased ABA levels and altered plant size and leaf shape, delayed seed germination, caused sugar oversensitivity in post-germination growth, and enhanced tolerance to drought |  At the one-leaf stage, similar regulation of OsNCED3 and OsNCED4 gene expression in roots or leaves in response to moderate salt stress (150<U+00A0>mM NaCl) was observed
