OsNF-YC13	transcription factor	Activation-tagging in indica rice identifies a novel transcription factor subunit, NF-YC13 associated with salt tolerance.	 Now, we screened 927 seeds from 70 Ac/Ds plants for salinity tolerance and identified one activation-tagged salt tolerant DS plant (DS-16, T3 generation) that showed enhanced expression of a novel 'histone-like transcription factor' belonging to rice NF-Y subfamily C and was named as OsNF-YC13
OsNF-YC13	salinity	Activation-tagging in indica rice identifies a novel transcription factor subunit, NF-YC13 associated with salt tolerance.

OsNF-YC13	salt	Activation-tagging in indica rice identifies a novel transcription factor subunit, NF-YC13 associated with salt tolerance.	 Real time expression analysis confirmed upregulation of transcript levels of OsNF-YC13 during salt treatment in a tissue specific manner
OsNF-YC13	tolerance	Activation-tagging in indica rice identifies a novel transcription factor subunit, NF-YC13 associated with salt tolerance.	 Now, we screened 927 seeds from 70 Ac/Ds plants for salinity tolerance and identified one activation-tagged salt tolerant DS plant (DS-16, T3 generation) that showed enhanced expression of a novel 'histone-like transcription factor' belonging to rice NF-Y subfamily C and was named as OsNF-YC13
