Symbol	Keyword	Title	Evidence
ONAC045|OsNAC45	root	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	 Immunostaining showed that OsNAC45 was localized in all root cells and was mainly expressed in the stele
ONAC045|OsNAC45	drought	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	 Previous reports have demonstrated that overexpression of OsNAC45 enhances salt and drought tolerance in rice, and that OsNAC45 may regulate the expression of two specific genes, OsPM1 and OsLEA3-1
ONAC045|OsNAC45	salt	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice
ONAC045|OsNAC45	salt	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	 Previous reports have demonstrated that overexpression of OsNAC45 enhances salt and drought tolerance in rice, and that OsNAC45 may regulate the expression of two specific genes, OsPM1 and OsLEA3-1
ONAC045|OsNAC45	salt	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	 Knockout of OsNAC45 also resulted in more ROS accumulation in roots and increased sensitivity of rice to salt stress
ONAC045|OsNAC45	tolerance	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice
ONAC045|OsNAC45	tolerance	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	 Previous reports have demonstrated that overexpression of OsNAC45 enhances salt and drought tolerance in rice, and that OsNAC45 may regulate the expression of two specific genes, OsPM1 and OsLEA3-1
ONAC045|OsNAC45	 ABA 	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice
ONAC045|OsNAC45	 ABA 	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	  Results: Here, we found that ABA repressed, and NaCl promoted, the expression of OsNAC45 in roots
ONAC045|OsNAC45	 ABA 	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	 Loss of OsNAC45 decreased the sensitivity of rice plants to ABA and over-expressing this gene had the opposite effect, which demonstrated that OsNAC45 played an important role during ABA signal responses
ONAC045|OsNAC45	drought tolerance	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	 Previous reports have demonstrated that overexpression of OsNAC45 enhances salt and drought tolerance in rice, and that OsNAC45 may regulate the expression of two specific genes, OsPM1 and OsLEA3-1
