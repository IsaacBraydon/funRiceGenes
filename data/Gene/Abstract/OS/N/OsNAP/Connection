OsABI2|OsPP2C06|OsABIL1	OsNAP	The NAC family transcription factor OsNAP confers abiotic stress response through the ABA pathway	Microarray analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsNAP revealed that many stress-related genes were up-regulated, including OsPP2C06/OsABI2, OsPP2C09, OsPP2C68 and OsSalT, and some genes coding for stress-related transcription factors (OsDREB1A, OsMYB2, OsAP37 and OsAP59)
OsNAP	OsSIPP2C1|OsPP2C68|OsPP108	The NAC family transcription factor OsNAP confers abiotic stress response through the ABA pathway	Microarray analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsNAP revealed that many stress-related genes were up-regulated, including OsPP2C06/OsABI2, OsPP2C09, OsPP2C68 and OsSalT, and some genes coding for stress-related transcription factors (OsDREB1A, OsMYB2, OsAP37 and OsAP59)
OsNAP	OsPP2C09|OsPP15|OsPYL2	The NAC family transcription factor OsNAP confers abiotic stress response through the ABA pathway	Microarray analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsNAP revealed that many stress-related genes were up-regulated, including OsPP2C06/OsABI2, OsPP2C09, OsPP2C68 and OsSalT, and some genes coding for stress-related transcription factors (OsDREB1A, OsMYB2, OsAP37 and OsAP59)
OsMYB102	OsNAP	The rice transcription factor OsMYB102 delays leaf senescence by downregulating abscisic acid accumulation and signaling.	 Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of OsMYB102 regulates the expression of SAGs, including genes associated with ABA degradation and ABA signaling (OsABF4, OsNAP, and OsCYP707A6), under dark-induced senescence conditions
OsMYB102	OsNAP	The rice transcription factor OsMYB102 delays leaf senescence by downregulating abscisic acid accumulation and signaling.	 OsMYB102 also indirectly represses ABA-responsive genes, such as OsABF4 and OsNAP
OsNAP	OsWRKY5	OsWRKY5 Promotes Rice Leaf Senescence via Senescence-Associated NAC and Abscisic Acid Biosynthesis Pathway.	 Furthermore, RT-qPCR and yeast one-hybrid analysis demonstrated that OsWRKY5 indirectly upregulates the expression of senescence-associated NAM/ATAF1/2/CUC2 (NAC) genes including OsNAP and OsNAC2
