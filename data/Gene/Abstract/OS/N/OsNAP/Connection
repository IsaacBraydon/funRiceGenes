OsABI2|OsPP2C06|OsABIL1	OsNAP	The NAC family transcription factor OsNAP confers abiotic stress response through the ABA pathway	Microarray analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsNAP revealed that many stress-related genes were up-regulated, including OsPP2C06/OsABI2, OsPP2C09, OsPP2C68 and OsSalT, and some genes coding for stress-related transcription factors (OsDREB1A, OsMYB2, OsAP37 and OsAP59)
OsNAP	OsSIPP2C1|OsPP2C68|OsPP108	The NAC family transcription factor OsNAP confers abiotic stress response through the ABA pathway	Microarray analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsNAP revealed that many stress-related genes were up-regulated, including OsPP2C06/OsABI2, OsPP2C09, OsPP2C68 and OsSalT, and some genes coding for stress-related transcription factors (OsDREB1A, OsMYB2, OsAP37 and OsAP59)
OsNAP	OsPP2C09|OsPP15|OsPYL2	The NAC family transcription factor OsNAP confers abiotic stress response through the ABA pathway	Microarray analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsNAP revealed that many stress-related genes were up-regulated, including OsPP2C06/OsABI2, OsPP2C09, OsPP2C68 and OsSalT, and some genes coding for stress-related transcription factors (OsDREB1A, OsMYB2, OsAP37 and OsAP59)
OsMYB102	OsNAP	The rice transcription factor OsMYB102 delays leaf senescence by downregulating abscisic acid accumulation and signaling.	 Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of OsMYB102 regulates the expression of SAGs, including genes associated with ABA degradation and ABA signaling (OsABF4, OsNAP, and OsCYP707A6), under dark-induced senescence conditions
OsMYB102	OsNAP	The rice transcription factor OsMYB102 delays leaf senescence by downregulating abscisic acid accumulation and signaling.	 OsMYB102 also indirectly represses ABA-responsive genes, such as OsABF4 and OsNAP
OsNAP	OsWRKY5	OsWRKY5 Promotes Rice Leaf Senescence via Senescence-Associated NAC and Abscisic Acid Biosynthesis Pathway.	 Furthermore, RT-qPCR and yeast one-hybrid analysis demonstrated that OsWRKY5 indirectly upregulates the expression of senescence-associated NAM/ATAF1/2/CUC2 (NAC) genes including OsNAP and OsNAC2
OsNAP	OsRap2.6|OsERF101	Rice ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 101 Promotes Leaf Senescence Through Jasmonic Acid-Mediated Regulation of OsNAP and OsMYC2	 Consistent with its delayed-yellowing phenotype, the oserf101 mutant exhibited downregulation of genes involved in chlorophyll degradation, including rice NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2 (OsNAP), STAY-GREEN (SGR), NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 (NYC1), and NYC3 during DIS
OsNAP	OsRap2.6|OsERF101	Rice ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 101 Promotes Leaf Senescence Through Jasmonic Acid-Mediated Regulation of OsNAP and OsMYC2	 Transient transactivation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that OsERF101 directly binds to the promoter regions of OsNAP and OsMYC2, which activate genes involved in chlorophyll degradation and JA signaling-mediated leaf senescence
OsNAC109	OsNAP	OsNAC109 regulates senescence, growth and development by altering the expression of and phytohormone-associated genes in rice.	 It was confirmed that OsNAC109 could directly regulate the expression of OsNAP, OsNYC3, OsEATB, OsAMTR1, OsZFP185, OsMPS and OsGA2ox3 by targeting to the highly conserved cis-element CNTCSSNNSCAVG except OsSAMS1
OsNAC24	OsNAP	The OsNAC24-OsNAP protein complex activates OsGBSSI and OsSBEI expression to fine-tune starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm.	 Another NAC family member, OsNAP, interacts with OsNAC24 and coactivates target gene expression
