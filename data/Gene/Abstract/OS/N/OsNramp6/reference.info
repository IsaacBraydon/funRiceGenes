However, metals can be toxic when present in excess. In plants, metal homeostasis is partly achieved through the function of metal transporters, including the diverse natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins (NRAMP). Among them, the OsNramp6 gene encodes a previously uncharacterized member of the rice NRAMP family that undergoes alternative splicing to produce different NRAMP6 proteins. In this work, we determined the metal transport activity and biological role of the full-length and the shortest NRAMP6 proteins (l-NRAMP6 and s-NRAMP6, respectively). Both l-NRAMP6 and s-NRAMP6 are plasma membrane-localized proteins that function as iron and manganese transporters. The expression of l-Nramp6 and s-Nramp6 is regulated during infection with the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, albeit with different kinetics. Rice plants grown under high iron supply show stronger induction of rice defense genes and enhanced resistance to M. oryzae infection. Also, loss of function of OsNramp6 results in enhanced resistance to M. oryzae, supporting the idea that OsNramp6 negatively regulates rice immunity. Furthermore, nramp6 plants showed reduced biomass, pointing to a role of OsNramp6 in plant growth. A better understanding of OsNramp6-mediated mechanisms underlying disease resistance in rice will help in developing appropriate strategies for crop protection.
