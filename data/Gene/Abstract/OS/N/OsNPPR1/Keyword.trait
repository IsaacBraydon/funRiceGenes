OsNPPR1	development	A nucleus-localized PPR protein OsNPPR1 is important for mitochondrial function and endosperm development in rice.	A nucleus-localized PPR protein OsNPPR1 is important for mitochondrial function and endosperm development in rice.
OsNPPR1	development	A nucleus-localized PPR protein OsNPPR1 is important for mitochondrial function and endosperm development in rice.	 Thus, OsNPPR1 was involved in regulation of mitochondrial development and/or functions that are important for endosperm development
OsNPPR1	endosperm	A nucleus-localized PPR protein OsNPPR1 is important for mitochondrial function and endosperm development in rice.	A nucleus-localized PPR protein OsNPPR1 is important for mitochondrial function and endosperm development in rice.
OsNPPR1	endosperm	A nucleus-localized PPR protein OsNPPR1 is important for mitochondrial function and endosperm development in rice.	 Thus, OsNPPR1 was involved in regulation of mitochondrial development and/or functions that are important for endosperm development
OsNPPR1	R protein	A nucleus-localized PPR protein OsNPPR1 is important for mitochondrial function and endosperm development in rice.	A nucleus-localized PPR protein OsNPPR1 is important for mitochondrial function and endosperm development in rice.
OsNPPR1	R protein	A nucleus-localized PPR protein OsNPPR1 is important for mitochondrial function and endosperm development in rice.	 This gene encodes a nucleus-localized PPR protein we named it OsNPPR1 that affected mitochondrial function
OsNPPR1	endosperm development	A nucleus-localized PPR protein OsNPPR1 is important for mitochondrial function and endosperm development in rice.	A nucleus-localized PPR protein OsNPPR1 is important for mitochondrial function and endosperm development in rice.
OsNPPR1	endosperm development	A nucleus-localized PPR protein OsNPPR1 is important for mitochondrial function and endosperm development in rice.	 Thus, OsNPPR1 was involved in regulation of mitochondrial development and/or functions that are important for endosperm development
