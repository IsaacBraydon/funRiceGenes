OsNCED3	 ABA 	Ectopic expression of rice OsNCED3 in Arabidopsis increases ABA level and alters leaf morphology	The data suggest that, in addition to ABA biosynthesis, the monocot OsNCED3 gene may have additional functions in shaping leaf morphology and vascular bundle development in Arabidopsis
OsNCED3	 ABA 	Ectopic expression of rice OsNCED3 in Arabidopsis increases ABA level and alters leaf morphology	Ectopic expression of rice OsNCED3 in Arabidopsis increases ABA level and alters leaf morphology
OsNCED3	seed	Ectopic expression of rice OsNCED3 in Arabidopsis increases ABA level and alters leaf morphology	Furthermore, overexpression of OsNCED3 in wild-type Arabidopsis plants results in increased accumulation of ABA, reduced relative water loss, delayed seed germination, and greater drought tolerance relative to that of wild-type
OsNCED3	 ABA 	ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress	As a key gene in ABA biosynthesis, OsNCED3 was significantly induced in rice by water stress treatment and such induction preceded the rapid increase in ABA
OsNCED3	anther	ABA regulates apoplastic sugar transport and is a potential signal for cold-induced pollen sterility in rice	The differences in endogenous ABA levels in Doongara and R31 correlated with differences in expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes encoding zeaxanthin epoxidase (OSZEP1) and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (OSNCED2, OSNCED3) in anthers

OsNCED3	drought tolerance	Ectopic expression of rice OsNCED3 in Arabidopsis increases ABA level and alters leaf morphology	Furthermore, overexpression of OsNCED3 in wild-type Arabidopsis plants results in increased accumulation of ABA, reduced relative water loss, delayed seed germination, and greater drought tolerance relative to that of wild-type
OsNCED3	vascular bundle	Ectopic expression of rice OsNCED3 in Arabidopsis increases ABA level and alters leaf morphology	The data suggest that, in addition to ABA biosynthesis, the monocot OsNCED3 gene may have additional functions in shaping leaf morphology and vascular bundle development in Arabidopsis
OsNCED3	 ABA 	A rice F-box gene, OsFbx352, is involved in glucose-delayed seed germination in rice	Overexpression of OsFbx352 led to a reduction in expression of genes responsible for ABA synthesis (OsNced2, OsNced3) and an increase in expression of genes encoding ABA catabolism (OsAba-ox2, OsAba-ox3) in the presence of glucose
OsNCED3	leaf	Ectopic expression of rice OsNCED3 in Arabidopsis increases ABA level and alters leaf morphology	Transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing the monocot OsNCED3 gene in a wild-type background result in a smaller and rounder leaf shape and midvein

OsNCED3	leaf	Ectopic expression of rice OsNCED3 in Arabidopsis increases ABA level and alters leaf morphology	Ectopic expression of rice OsNCED3 in Arabidopsis increases ABA level and alters leaf morphology
OsNCED3	leaf shape	Ectopic expression of rice OsNCED3 in Arabidopsis increases ABA level and alters leaf morphology	Transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing the monocot OsNCED3 gene in a wild-type background result in a smaller and rounder leaf shape and midvein
OsNCED3	seed germination	Ectopic expression of rice OsNCED3 in Arabidopsis increases ABA level and alters leaf morphology	Furthermore, overexpression of OsNCED3 in wild-type Arabidopsis plants results in increased accumulation of ABA, reduced relative water loss, delayed seed germination, and greater drought tolerance relative to that of wild-type
OsNCED3	drought	Ectopic expression of rice OsNCED3 in Arabidopsis increases ABA level and alters leaf morphology	Furthermore, overexpression of OsNCED3 in wild-type Arabidopsis plants results in increased accumulation of ABA, reduced relative water loss, delayed seed germination, and greater drought tolerance relative to that of wild-type
