OsNCED3	 The OsNCED3 is constitutively expressed in various tissues under normal condition, Its expression is highly induced by NaCl, PEG, and H2O2 stress, suggesting the roles for OsNCED3 in response to the multi-abiotic stress tolerance in rice |  Further analysis found that nced3 mutants contained lower ABA content compared with wild-type plants, overexpression of OsNCED3 in transgenic plants could enhance water stress tolerance, promote leaf senescence and increase ABA content	 Further analysis found that nced3 mutants contained lower ABA content compared with wild-type plants, overexpression of OsNCED3 in transgenic plants could enhance water stress tolerance, promote leaf senescence and increase ABA content
