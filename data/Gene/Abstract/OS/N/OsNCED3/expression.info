OsNCED3	 The OsNCED3 is constitutively expressed in various tissues under normal condition, Its expression is highly induced by NaCl, PEG, and H2O2 stress, suggesting the roles for OsNCED3 in response to the multi-abiotic stress tolerance in rice |  Further analysis found that nced3 mutants contained lower ABA content compared with wild-type plants, overexpression of OsNCED3 in transgenic plants could enhance water stress tolerance, promote leaf senescence and increase ABA content	 Further analysis found that nced3 mutants contained lower ABA content compared with wild-type plants, overexpression of OsNCED3 in transgenic plants could enhance water stress tolerance, promote leaf senescence and increase ABA content
OsNCED3	 SiMYB19 overexpression promotes abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation in transgenic rice and upregulates the ABA synthesis gene OsNCED3 and the ABA signal transduction pathway-related genes OsPK1 and OsABF2	 SiMYB19 overexpression promotes abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation in transgenic rice and upregulates the ABA synthesis gene OsNCED3 and the ABA signal transduction pathway-related genes OsPK1 and OsABF2
OsNCED3	 Furthermore, Overexpression of OsABT decreased the abscisic acid (ABA) content, while downregulating the ABA synthesis genes OsNCED3 and OsNCED4 and upregulating the ABA catabolic gene OsABA8ox2	 Furthermore, Overexpression of OsABT decreased the abscisic acid (ABA) content, while downregulating the ABA synthesis genes OsNCED3 and OsNCED4 and upregulating the ABA catabolic gene OsABA8ox2
