OsFbx352	OsNCED3	A rice F-box gene, OsFbx352, is involved in glucose-delayed seed germination in rice	Overexpression of OsFbx352 led to a reduction in expression of genes responsible for ABA synthesis (OsNced2, OsNced3) and an increase in expression of genes encoding ABA catabolism (OsAba-ox2, OsAba-ox3) in the presence of glucose
OsNCED2	OsNCED3	A rice F-box gene, OsFbx352, is involved in glucose-delayed seed germination in rice	Overexpression of OsFbx352 led to a reduction in expression of genes responsible for ABA synthesis (OsNced2, OsNced3) and an increase in expression of genes encoding ABA catabolism (OsAba-ox2, OsAba-ox3) in the presence of glucose
OsNCED2	OsNCED3	ABA regulates apoplastic sugar transport and is a potential signal for cold-induced pollen sterility in rice	The differences in endogenous ABA levels in Doongara and R31 correlated with differences in expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes encoding zeaxanthin epoxidase (OSZEP1) and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (OSNCED2, OSNCED3) in anthers
OsABA1|OSZEP1	OsNCED3	ABA regulates apoplastic sugar transport and is a potential signal for cold-induced pollen sterility in rice	The differences in endogenous ABA levels in Doongara and R31 correlated with differences in expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes encoding zeaxanthin epoxidase (OSZEP1) and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (OSNCED2, OSNCED3) in anthers
OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsNCED3	A Rice NAC Transcription Factor Promotes Leaf Senescence via ABA Biosynthesis.	 Moreover, ectopic expression of OsNAC2 leads to an increase in ABA levels via directly upregulating expression of ABA biosynthetic genes (OsNCED3 and OsZEP1) as well as downregulating the ABA catabolic gene (OsABA8ox1)
OsNCED3	OsNCED4	Heterologous expression of rice 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 4 (OsNCED4) in Arabidopsis confers sugar oversensitivity and drought tolerance.	 The native OsNCED3 and OsNCED4 promoters were expressed in an overlapping pattern in rice seeds and young seedlings, suggesting possible functional redundancy between OsNCED3 and OsNCED4
OsNCED3	OsNCED4	Heterologous expression of rice 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 4 (OsNCED4) in Arabidopsis confers sugar oversensitivity and drought tolerance.	 At the one-leaf stage, similar regulation of OsNCED3 and OsNCED4 gene expression in roots or leaves in response to moderate salt stress (150<U+00A0>mM NaCl) was observed
OsNCED3	OsNCED4	Heterologous expression of rice 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 4 (OsNCED4) in Arabidopsis confers sugar oversensitivity and drought tolerance.	Like OsNCED3, OsNCED4 is functionally active in ABA biosynthesis in rice
OsNCED3	OsNCED4	Heterologous expression of rice 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 4 (OsNCED4) in Arabidopsis confers sugar oversensitivity and drought tolerance.	 OsNCED3 and OsNCED4 might play redundant roles in controlling ABA biosynthesis in rice, as suggested by GUS staining assay, but this should be further analyzed through complementation of rice NCED knockout mutants
OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsNCED3	Overexpression of a microRNA-targeted NAC transcription factor improves drought and salt tolerance in Rice via ABA-mediated pathways.	 Moreover, OsNAC2 directly interacted with the promoters of OsLEA3 and OsNCED3 in yeast one-hybrid assays
