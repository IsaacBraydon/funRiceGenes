GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OsNAC016	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.	 Moreover, OsNAC016 interacted with and was phosphorylated by GSK3/SHAGGY-LIKE KINASE2 (GSK2), a negative regulator in the BR pathway
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OsNAC016	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.	 Our findings establish that OsNAC016 is positively involved in BR-regulated rice architecture, negatively modulates ABA-mediated drought tolerance, and is regulated by GSK2, SAPK8, and OsPUB43 through post-translational modification
OsNAC016	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.
OsNAC016	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.	 Further, OSMOTIC STRESS/ABA-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE8 (SAPK8) phosphorylated OsNAC016 and reduced its stability
OsNAC016	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.	 Our findings establish that OsNAC016 is positively involved in BR-regulated rice architecture, negatively modulates ABA-mediated drought tolerance, and is regulated by GSK2, SAPK8, and OsPUB43 through post-translational modification
OsNAC016	OsSPX2	Transcription factor OsNAC016 negatively regulates phosphate-starvation response in rice.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) analysis and transient transactivation assays indicated that OsNAC016 could activate the SPX-domain-containing protein 2 (OsSPX2) gene through binding to its promoter
OsNAC016	OsSPX2	Transcription factor OsNAC016 negatively regulates phosphate-starvation response in rice.	 Further, we found that Pi starvation enhanced OsNAC016 binding to the OsSPX2 promoter, thus strongly promoting OsSPX2 expression
OsNAC016	OsSPX2	Transcription factor OsNAC016 negatively regulates phosphate-starvation response in rice.	 Moreover, similar to OsSPX2, OsNAC016 negatively regulates leaf inclination by repressing the cell elongation in lamina joint in rice under Pi-starvation stress
OsNAC016	OsSPX2	Transcription factor OsNAC016 negatively regulates phosphate-starvation response in rice.	 Together, our findings demonstrate that OsNAC016 negatively regulates rice phosphate-starvation response and leaf inclination by activating OsSPX2 expression under Pi-starvation conditions
