D2|CYP90D2|SMG11|OsD2	OsNAC016	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.	 Further investigation revealed that OsNAC016 regulated the expression of the brassinosteroid biosynthesis gene D2 by binding to its promoter
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OsNAC016	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OsNAC016	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.	 Moreover, OsNAC016 interacted with and was phosphorylated by GSK3/SHAGGY-LIKE KINASE2 (GSK2), a negative regulator in the BR pathway
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OsNAC016	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.	 Our findings establish that OsNAC016 is positively involved in BR-regulated rice architecture, negatively modulates ABA-mediated drought tolerance, and is regulated by GSK2, SAPK8, and OsPUB43 through post-translational modification
OsNAC016	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.
OsNAC016	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.	 Further, OSMOTIC STRESS/ABA-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE8 (SAPK8) phosphorylated OsNAC016 and reduced its stability
OsNAC016	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.	 Our findings establish that OsNAC016 is positively involved in BR-regulated rice architecture, negatively modulates ABA-mediated drought tolerance, and is regulated by GSK2, SAPK8, and OsPUB43 through post-translational modification
