err136.pdf	The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice	2011	J Exp Bot	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal toxic to humans and the accumulation of Cd in the rice grain is a major agricultural problem, particularly in Asia. The role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in Cd uptake and transport in rice was investigated here. An OsNRAMP1:GFP fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane in onion epidermal cells. The growth of yeast expressing OsNRAMP1 was impaired in the presence of Cd compared with yeast transformed with an empty vector. Moreover, the Cd content of OsNRAMP1-expressing yeast exceeded that of the vector control. The expression of OsNRAMP1 in the roots was higher in a high Cd-accumulating cultivar (Habataki) than a low Cd-accumulating cultivar (Sasanishiki) regardless of the presence of Cd, and the amino acid sequence of OsNRAMP1 showed 100% identity between Sasanishiki and Habataki. Over-expression of OsNRAMP1 in rice increased Cd accumulation in the leaves. These results suggest that OsNRAMP1 participates in cellular Cd uptake and Cd transport within plants, and the higher expression of OsNRAMP1 in the roots could lead to an increase in Cd accumulation in the shoots. Our results indicated that OsNRAMP1 is an important protein in high-level Cd accumulation in rice.
psb-6-1813.pdf	Role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in cadmium uptake and accumulation in rice	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.	The heavy metal cadmium (Cd) is toxic to humans, and its accumulation in rice grains is a major agricultural problem. Rice has seven putative metal transporter NRAMP genes, but microarray analysis showed that only OsNRAMP1 is highly up-regulated by iron (Fe) deficiency. OsNRAMP1 localized to the plasma membrane and transported Cd as well as Fe. OsNRAMP1 expression was observed mainly in roots and was higher in the roots of a high-Cd-accumulating cultivar (Habataki) than in those of a low-Cd-accumulating cultivar (Sasanishiki). The amino acid sequence of OsNRAMP1 in the Sasanishiki and Habataki cultivars was found to be 100% identical. These results suggest that OsNRAMP1 participates in cellular Cd uptake and that the differences observed in Cd accumulation among cultivars are because of differences in OsNRAMP1 expression levels in roots.
NA	OsNRAMP1 contributes to cadmium and manganese uptake in rice 	2020	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Rice is a major dietary source of the toxic metal cadmium (Cd). Previous studies reported that the rice OsNRAMP1 (Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein 1) could transport iron (Fe), Cd and arsenic (As) in heterologous yeast assays. However, the in planta function of OsNRAMP1 remains unknown. Here, we showed that OsNRAMP1 was able to transport Cd and manganese (Mn) when expressed in yeast, but did not transport Fe or As. OsNRAMP1 was mainly expressed in roots and leaves and encoded a plasma membrane-localized protein. OsNRAMP1 expression was induced by Cd treatment and Fe deficiency. Immunostaining showed that OsNRAMP1 was localized in all root cells except the central vasculature, and in leaf mesophyll cells. The knockout of OsNRAMP1 resulted in significant decreases in root uptake of Cd and Mn and their accumulation in rice shoots and grains, and increased sensitivity to Mn deficiency. The knockout of OsNRAMP1 had smaller effects on Cd and Mn uptake than knockout of OsNRAMP5, while knockout of both genes resulted in large decreases in the uptake of the two metals. Taken together, OsNRAMP1 contributes significantly to the uptake of Mn and Cd in rice and the functions of OsNRAMP1 and OsNRAMP5 are similar but not redundant. This article is protected by copyright.

NA	Calcium Plays a Double-Edged Role in Modulating Cadmium Uptake and Translocation in Rice	2020	Int J Mol Sci	Collaborative Innovation Centre for Grain Industry, College of Agriculture, Yangtze University, Jingzhou 434025, China.	Cadmium (Cd) contamination in soils poses great risks to both agricultural production and human health. Calcium (Ca) is an essential element playing a significant role in protecting plants against Cd toxicity. However, how Ca affects Cd uptake and translocation in rice is still not fully elucidated. In this study, the regulatory role of Ca in Cd uptake and upward translocation was investigated in rice at different growth stages. Our results showed that the supplement of 5 mM Ca significantly reduced Cd uptake by rice roots, because of their competition for Ca-permeable channels as an absorption site and Ca-induced downregulation of OsNRAMP1 and OsNRAMP5. However, Ca application facilitated the upward translocation of Cd by both upregulating OsHMA2 to induce xylem loading of Cd and downregulating OsHMA3 to reduce vacuolar sequestration of Cd. Such contrary results suggested a double-edged role of Ca in regulating root Cd uptake and root-to-shoot Cd translocation in rice. Although it increased Cd content in the aboveground vegetative tissues during the whole growth period, the addition of 5 mM Ca eventually decreased Cd content in rice grains at the ripening stage. All these results suggest that Ca-based amendments possess great potential for the production of low-Cd rice grains.
NA	Comparative transcriptome profile analysis of rice varieties with different tolerance to zinc deficiency	2020	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	CAAS-IRRI Joint Laboratory for Genomics-Assisted Germplasm Enhancement, Agricultural Genomics Institute in Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, China.	Zinc (Zn) is an indispensable element for rice growth. Zn deficiency results in brown blotches and streaks 2-3 weeks after transplanting, as well as stunting, reduced tillering, and low productivity of rice plants. These processes are controlled by different families of expressed genes. A comparative transcriptome profile analysis was conducted using the roots of two Zn deficiency tolerant varieties (UCP122 and KALIBORO26) and two sensitive varieties (IR26 and IR64) by merging data from untreated control (CK) and Zn deficiency treated samples. Results revealed a total of 4,688 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the normal Zn and deficient conditions, with 2,702 and 1,489 unique DEGs upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis identified transcription factors (TFs), such as WRKY, MYB, ERF, and bHLH which are important in the regulation of the Zn deficiency response. Furthermore, chitinases, jasmonic acid, and phenylpropanoid pathways were found to be important in the Zn deficiency response. The metal tolerance protein (MTP) genes also appeared to play an important role in conferring tolerance to Zn deficiency. A heavy metal-associated domain-containing protein 7 was associated with tolerance to Zn deficiency and negatively regulated downstream genes. Collectively, our findings provide valuable expression patterns and candidate genes for the study of molecular mechanisms underlying the response to Zn deficiency and for improvements in breeding for tolerance to Zn deficiency in rice.
NA	Effects of Fe and Mn cations on Cd uptake by rice plant in hydroponic culture experiment	2020	PLoS One	Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) are nutritional components of rice, plays an important role in its physiological processes and can minimize absorption of cadmium (Cd) in rice. Fe, Mn, and Cd transporters such as CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, OsHMA3, and OsNAAT1 regulate uptake of Cd in rice. However, the effect of exogenous application of Fe, and Mn on the accumulation of Cd and relative expression (RE) of these transporters in rice has not been investigated. Therefore, a hydroponic culture experiment was conducted to investigate the impact of Fe and Mn on Cd uptake and RE of these transporters in rice. The results showed that the Fe and Mn application significantly decreased Cd in the roots and shoots of rice. Whereas, Cd concentration in the rice significantly increased with increasing Cd concentration in the solution. The addition of manganese in the culture medium can reduce the cadmium content of rice roots by 11.9-82.3% and shoots by 11.6-85.0%, while the addition of iron in the culture medium can reduce the cadmium content of rice roots and shoots by 26-65% and 9-683% respectively. Meanwhile, application of sufficient doses of Fe and Cd in solution culture increased RE of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, and OsNAAT1 in roots, whereas expression level of OsHMA3 was decreased. Similarly, expression level of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, and OsNRAMP1 significantly increased in roots in high Cd and Mn deficient treatments. This may be concluded that the Cd increases expression of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, and OsNAAT1 but decreases OsHMA3 expression in rice roots, which resulted in increased Cd uptake in hydroponically grown rice.
NA	Cadmium inhibits lateral root emergence in rice by disrupting OsPIN-mediated auxin distribution and the protective effect of OsHMA3	2020	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Cadmium (Cd) strongly inhibits root growth, especially the formation of lateral roots (LRs). The mechanism of Cd inhibition on LR formation in rice (Oryza sativa) remains unclear. In this study, we found that LR emergence in rice was inhibited significantly by 1 ¦ÌM Cd and almost completely arrested by 5 ¦ÌM Cd. Cadmium suppressed both the formation and subsequent development of the lateral root primordium (LRP). By using transgenic rice expressing the auxin response reporters DR5::GUS and DR5rev::VENUS, we found that Cd markedly reduced the auxin levels in the stele and LRP. Cadmium rapidly downregulated the expression of the auxin efflux transporter genes OsPIN1b, OsPIN1c and OsPIN9 in the stele and LPR. The emergence of LRs in a rice cultivar with a null allele of OsHMA3 (Heavy Metal ATPase 3) was more sensitive to Cd than cultivars with functional alleles. Overexpression of functional OsHMA3 in rice greatly alleviated the inhibitory effect of Cd, but the protective effect of OsHMA3 was abolished by the auxin polar transport inhibitor 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid. The results suggest that Cd inhibits LR development in rice by disrupting OsPIN-mediated auxin distribution to LPR and OsHMA3 protects against Cd toxicity by sequestering Cd into the vacuoles.
NA	The rice heavy metal transporter OsNRAMP1 regulates disease resistance by modulating ROS homeostasis.	2022	Plant Cell Environ	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Hubei Hongshan Laboratory, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Crop diseases threaten food security and sustainable agriculture. Consumption of crops containing non-essential toxic metals leads to health risks for humans. Therefore, breeding disease-resistance and toxic metal-safe crops are a double gain strategy contributing to food security. Here, we show that rice heavy metal transporter OsNRAMP1 plays important roles in plant immunity by modulating metal ions and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. OsNRAMP1 expression was induced after pathogenic bacteria and fungi infection. The osnramp1 mutants had increased content of H(2) O(2) and activity of superoxide dismutase, but decreased activity of catalase, exhibiting enhanced broad-spectrum resistance against bacterial and fungal pathogens. RNA-seq analysis identified a number of differentially expressed genes that were involved in metal ions and ROS homeostasis. Altered expression of metal ion-dependent ROS-scavenging enzymes genes and lower accumulation of cations such as Mn coordinately triggered compromised metal ion-dependent enzyme-catalyzing activity and modulated ROS homeostasis, which together contributed to disease resistance in osnramp1 mutants. Furthermore, the osnramp1 mutants contained lower levels of toxic heavy metals Cd and Pb and micronutrients Ni and Mn in leaves and grains. Taken together, a proof-of-concept was achieved that broad-spectrum disease resistance and toxic heavy metal-safe rice was engineered by removal of OsNRAMP1 gene.

NA	Melatonin reduces cadmium accumulation via mediating the nitric oxide accumulation and increasing the cell wall fixation capacity of cadmium in rice.	2022	J Hazard Mater	State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Science, Nanjing 210008, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.	Melatonin (MT) is participated in plants&#x27; response to cadmium (Cd) tolerance, although its work model remains elusive. Here, the function of MT in adjusting Cd accumulation in rice was investigated. &#x27;Nipponbare&#x27; (Nip) was cultured in the -Cd (1/2 Kimura B), -Cd +Â MT (1/2 Kimura B with 1Â Î¼M MT), +Cd (1/2 Kimura B plus 1Â Î¼MÂ Cd) and +Cd +Â MT (1/2 Kimura B with 1Â Î¼MÂ Cd and 1Â Î¼M MT) nutrient solutions for 7 d. Cd markedly induced the endogenous MT accumulation in rice roots and shoots, even within 1Â h. MT applied exogenously elevated the hemicelluloses level, which in turn increased the cell wall&#x27;s binding capacity to Cd. Furthermore, MT applied exogenously down-regulated the transcription level of Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein 1 (OsNRAMP1), OsNRAMP5, a major facilitator superfamily gene (OsCd1), and IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER 1 (OsIRT1), all of which were responsible for Cd intake, thus less Cd was entered into roots. Moreover, MT applied exogenously also up-regulated transcription level of Cadmium accumulation in Leaf 1 (OsCAL1) and Heavy Metal ATPase 3 (OsHMA3), two genes both attributed to the decreased Cd accumulation in shoots through expelling Cd out of cells and chelating Cd in the vacuoles, respectively. In addition, MT applied exogenously further aggravated the production of nitric oxide (NO) that induced by Cd, while application of a NO donor-SNP mimicked this alleviatory effect of the MT, indicating MT decreased rice Cd accumulation relied on the accumulation of NO.
