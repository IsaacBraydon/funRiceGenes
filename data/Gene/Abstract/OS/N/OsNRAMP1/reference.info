err136.pdf	The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice	2011	J Exp Bot	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal toxic to humans and the accumulation of Cd in the rice grain is a major agricultural problem, particularly in Asia. The role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in Cd uptake and transport in rice was investigated here. An OsNRAMP1:GFP fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane in onion epidermal cells. The growth of yeast expressing OsNRAMP1 was impaired in the presence of Cd compared with yeast transformed with an empty vector. Moreover, the Cd content of OsNRAMP1-expressing yeast exceeded that of the vector control. The expression of OsNRAMP1 in the roots was higher in a high Cd-accumulating cultivar (Habataki) than a low Cd-accumulating cultivar (Sasanishiki) regardless of the presence of Cd, and the amino acid sequence of OsNRAMP1 showed 100% identity between Sasanishiki and Habataki. Over-expression of OsNRAMP1 in rice increased Cd accumulation in the leaves. These results suggest that OsNRAMP1 participates in cellular Cd uptake and Cd transport within plants, and the higher expression of OsNRAMP1 in the roots could lead to an increase in Cd accumulation in the shoots. Our results indicated that OsNRAMP1 is an important protein in high-level Cd accumulation in rice.
psb-6-1813.pdf	Role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in cadmium uptake and accumulation in rice	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.	The heavy metal cadmium (Cd) is toxic to humans, and its accumulation in rice grains is a major agricultural problem. Rice has seven putative metal transporter NRAMP genes, but microarray analysis showed that only OsNRAMP1 is highly up-regulated by iron (Fe) deficiency. OsNRAMP1 localized to the plasma membrane and transported Cd as well as Fe. OsNRAMP1 expression was observed mainly in roots and was higher in the roots of a high-Cd-accumulating cultivar (Habataki) than in those of a low-Cd-accumulating cultivar (Sasanishiki). The amino acid sequence of OsNRAMP1 in the Sasanishiki and Habataki cultivars was found to be 100% identical. These results suggest that OsNRAMP1 participates in cellular Cd uptake and that the differences observed in Cd accumulation among cultivars are because of differences in OsNRAMP1 expression levels in roots.
NA	OsNRAMP1 contributes to cadmium and manganese uptake in rice 	2020	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Rice is a major dietary source of the toxic metal cadmium (Cd). Previous studies reported that the rice OsNRAMP1 (Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein 1) could transport iron (Fe), Cd and arsenic (As) in heterologous yeast assays. However, the in planta function of OsNRAMP1 remains unknown. Here, we showed that OsNRAMP1 was able to transport Cd and manganese (Mn) when expressed in yeast, but did not transport Fe or As. OsNRAMP1 was mainly expressed in roots and leaves and encoded a plasma membrane-localized protein. OsNRAMP1 expression was induced by Cd treatment and Fe deficiency. Immunostaining showed that OsNRAMP1 was localized in all root cells except the central vasculature, and in leaf mesophyll cells. The knockout of OsNRAMP1 resulted in significant decreases in root uptake of Cd and Mn and their accumulation in rice shoots and grains, and increased sensitivity to Mn deficiency. The knockout of OsNRAMP1 had smaller effects on Cd and Mn uptake than knockout of OsNRAMP5, while knockout of both genes resulted in large decreases in the uptake of the two metals. Taken together, OsNRAMP1 contributes significantly to the uptake of Mn and Cd in rice and the functions of OsNRAMP1 and OsNRAMP5 are similar but not redundant. This article is protected by copyright.
