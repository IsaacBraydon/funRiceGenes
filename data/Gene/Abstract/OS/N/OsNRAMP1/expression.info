OsNRAMP1	 OsNRAMP1 expression was induced by Cd treatment and Fe deficiency
OsNRAMP1	 Meanwhile, application of sufficient doses of Fe and Cd in solution culture increased RE of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, and OsNAAT1 in roots, whereas expression level of OsHMA3 was decreased |  Similarly, expression level of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, and OsNRAMP1 significantly increased in roots in high Cd and Mn deficient treatments |  This may be concluded that the Cd increases expression of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, and OsNAAT1 but decreases OsHMA3 expression in rice roots, which resulted in increased Cd uptake in hydroponically grown rice
OsNRAMP1	 OsNRAMP1 expression was induced after pathogenic bacteria and fungi infection |  Altered expression of metal ion-dependent ROS-scavenging enzymes genes and lower accumulation of cations such as Mn coordinately triggered compromised metal ion-dependent enzyme-catalyzing activity and modulated ROS homeostasis, which together contributed to disease resistance in osnramp1 mutants
