OsNRAMP1	OsNRAMP5	OsNRAMP1 contributes to cadmium and manganese uptake in rice 	 The knockout of OsNRAMP1 had smaller effects on Cd and Mn uptake than knockout of OsNRAMP5, while knockout of both genes resulted in large decreases in the uptake of the two metals
OsNRAMP1	OsNRAMP5	OsNRAMP1 contributes to cadmium and manganese uptake in rice 	 Taken together, OsNRAMP1 contributes significantly to the uptake of Mn and Cd in rice and the functions of OsNRAMP1 and OsNRAMP5 are similar but not redundant
OsNRAMP1	OsNRAMP5	Calcium Plays a Double-Edged Role in Modulating Cadmium Uptake and Translocation in Rice	 Our results showed that the supplement of 5 mM Ca significantly reduced Cd uptake by rice roots, because of their competition for Ca-permeable channels as an absorption site and Ca-induced downregulation of OsNRAMP1 and OsNRAMP5
