OsNRAMP1	OsNRAMP5	OsNRAMP1 contributes to cadmium and manganese uptake in rice 	 The knockout of OsNRAMP1 had smaller effects on Cd and Mn uptake than knockout of OsNRAMP5, while knockout of both genes resulted in large decreases in the uptake of the two metals
OsNRAMP1	OsNRAMP5	OsNRAMP1 contributes to cadmium and manganese uptake in rice 	 Taken together, OsNRAMP1 contributes significantly to the uptake of Mn and Cd in rice and the functions of OsNRAMP1 and OsNRAMP5 are similar but not redundant
