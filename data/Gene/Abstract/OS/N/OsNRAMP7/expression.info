OsNRAMP7	 In addition, the knockdown of OsNRAMP7 also reduced grain fertility, pollen viability, and grain Fe concentration in the paddy fields; OsNRAMP7 overexpression significantly promoted Fe accumulation in the grains |  Thus, our results suggest that OsNRAMP7 is required for the distribution and accumulation of Fe in rice grains and its overexpression could be a novel strategy for Fe biofortification in staple food crops	 In addition, the knockdown of OsNRAMP7 also reduced grain fertility, pollen viability, and grain Fe concentration in the paddy fields; OsNRAMP7 overexpression significantly promoted Fe accumulation in the grains |  Thus, our results suggest that OsNRAMP7 is required for the distribution and accumulation of Fe in rice grains and its overexpression could be a novel strategy for Fe biofortification in staple food crops	 OsNRAMP7 knockdown by RNA interference (RNAi) increased Fe accumulation in the flag leaf blade, but decreased the Fe concentration in node I and rice grains
