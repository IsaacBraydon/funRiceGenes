Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for plant growth and human health. Plants have evolved an efficient transport system for absorbing and redistributing Fe from the soil to other organs; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying Fe loading into grains are poorly understood. Our study shows that OsNRAMP7, a member of the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (NRAMP) family, is a rice Fe transporter that localizes to the Golgi and trans-Golgi network (TGN). OsNRAMP7 was highly expressed in leaf blade, node I, pollen, and vascular tissues of almost tissues at the rice flowering stage. OsNRAMP7 knockdown by RNA interference (RNAi) increased Fe accumulation in the flag leaf blade, but decreased the Fe concentration in node I and rice grains. In addition, the knockdown of OsNRAMP7 also reduced grain fertility, pollen viability, and grain Fe concentration in the paddy fields; OsNRAMP7 overexpression significantly promoted Fe accumulation in the grains. Thus, our results suggest that OsNRAMP7 is required for the distribution and accumulation of Fe in rice grains and its overexpression could be a novel strategy for Fe biofortification in staple food crops.
