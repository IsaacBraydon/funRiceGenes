To understand the functions of transcription factor OsNAC5 in response to abiotic stress, we generated transgenic rice plants with knockdown OsNAC5 by RNA-interfered (RNAi) and overexpressing OsNAC5, and investigated the effects of cold, drought and salt stress on wild-type (WT), RNAi and overexpression rice lines. Our results demonstrated that RNAi lines became less tolerant to these stresses than WT plants, while overexpression of OsNAC5 in Arabidopsis and rice enhanced tolerance to these stresses. The mechanisms underlying the changes in tolerance of the transgenic rice plants to abiotic stresses were explored by measuring free proline (Pro) and soluble sugar contents in WT and transgenic plants. Accumulation of Pro and soluble sugars was positively correlated with OsNAC5 expression levels. The less accumulation of Pro in RNAi lines may be accounted for by inhibition of Pro synthesis and transport at transcriptional levels. In addition, knockdown and overexpression of OsNAC5 enhanced and reduced accumulation of malondialdehyde and H(2)O(2), suggesting that knockdown of OsNAC5 renders RNAi plants more susceptible to oxidative damage. The RNAi lines displayed higher Na(+)/K(+) ratio due to greater accumulation of Na(+) ions than WT under salt stress conditions, and expression of genes encoding tonoplast Na(+)/H(+) antiporter was lower in RNAi lines than in WT under both control and salt-stressed conditions. Seed germination of RNAi and overexpression plants was more and less inhibited by salt and mannitol than that of WT, respectively. Seed germination of overexpression and RNAi plants was more and less sensitive than that of WT to ABA. These findings highlight the important role of OsNAC5 played in the tolerance of rice plants to abiotic stress by regulating downstream targets associated with accumulation of compatible solutes, Na(+) ions, H(2)O(2) and malondialdehyde.

The transcription factor OsNAC5 in rice is a member of the plant-specific NAC family that regulates stress responses. Expression of OsNAC5 is induced by abiotic stresses such as drought, cold, high salinity, abscisic acid and methyl jasmonic acid. Transactivation assays using rice protoplasts demonstrated that OsNAC5 is a transcriptional activator, and subcellular localization studies using OsNAC5-GFP fusion proteins showed that it is localized to the nucleus. Pull-down assays revealed that OsNAC5 interacts with OsNAC5, OsNAC6 and SNAC1. To analyze the function of OsNAC5 in rice plants, we generated transgenic plants that overexpressed OsNAC5. The growth of these plants was similar to that of control plants, whereas the growth of OsNAC6-overexpressing transgenic plants was retarded. OsNAC5-overexpressing transgenic plants also had improved tolerance to high salinity compared to control plants. By microarray analysis, many stress-inducible genes, including the "late embryogenesis abundant" gene OsLEA3, were upregulated in rice plants that overexpressed OsNAC5. By gel mobility shift assay, OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 were shown to bind to the OsLEA3 promoter. Collectively, our results indicate that the stress-responsive proteins OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 are transcriptional activators that enhance stress tolerance by upregulating the expression of stress-inducible rice genes such as OsLEA3, although the effects of these proteins on growth are different. Furthermore, because OsNAC5 overexpression did not retard growth, OsNAC5 may be a useful gene that can improve the stress tolerance of rice without affecting its growth.
pbi12011.pdf	OsNAC5 overexpression enlarges root diameter in rice plants leading to enhanced drought tolerance and increased grain yield in the field	2013	Plant Biotechnol J	School of Biotechnology and Environmental Engineering, Myongji University, Yongin, Korea.	Drought conditions are among the most serious challenges to crop production worldwide. Here, we report the results of field evaluations of transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsNAC5, under the control of either the root-specific (RCc3) or constitutive (GOS2) promoters. Field evaluations over three growing seasons revealed that the grain yield of the RCc3:OsNAC5 and GOS2:OsNAC5 plants were increased by 9%-23% and 9%-26% under normal conditions, respectively. Under drought conditions, however, RCc3:OsNAC5 plants showed a significantly higher grain yield of 22%-63%, whilst the GOS2:OsNAC5 plants showed a reduced or similar yield to the nontransgenic (NT) controls. Both the RCc3:OsNAC5 and GOS2:OsNAC5 plants were found to have larger roots due to an enlarged stele and aerenchyma at flowering stage. Cell numbers per cortex layer and stele of developing roots were higher in both transgenic plants than NT controls, contributing to the increase in root diameter. The root diameter was enlarged to a greater extent in the RCc3:OsNAC5, suggesting the importance of this phenotype for enhanced drought tolerance. Microarray experiments identified 25 up-regulated genes by more than three-fold (P < 0.01) in the roots of both transgenic lines. Also identified were 19 and 18 up-regulated genes that are specific to the RCc3:OsNAC5 and GOS2:OsNAC5 roots, respectively. Of the genes specifically up-regulated in the RCc3:OsNAC5 roots, GLP, PDX, MERI5 and O-methyltransferase were implicated in root growth and development. Our present findings demonstrate that the root-specific overexpression of OsNAC5 enlarges roots significantly and thereby enhances drought tolerance and grain yield under field conditions.

Genes that encode products containing a NAC domain, such as NO APICAL MERISTEM (NAM) in petunia, CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (CUC2) and NAP in Arabidopsis thaliana, have crucial functions in plant development. We describe here molecular aspects of the OsNAC genes that encode proteins with NAC domains in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Sequence analysis revealed that the NAC genes in plants can be divided into several subfamilies, such as the NAM, ATAF, and OsNAC3 subfamilies. In rice, OsNAC1 and OsNAC2 are classified in the NAM subfamily, which includes NAM and CUC2, while OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 fall into the ATAF subfamily. In addition to the members of these subfamilies, the rice genome contains the NAC genes OsNAC3, OsNAC4 (both in the OsNAC3 subfamily), OsNAC7, and OsNAC8. These results and Southern analysis indicate that the OsNAC genes constitute a large gene family in the rice genome. Each OsNAC gene is expressed in a specific pattern in different organs, suggesting that this family has diverse and important roles in rice development.

Rice is a poor source of micronutrients such as iron and zinc. To help clarify the molecular mechanisms that regulate metal mobilization from leaves to developing seeds, we conducted suppression subtractive hybridization analysis in flag leaves of two rice cultivars. Flag leaves are the major source of remobilized metals for developing seeds. We isolated 78 sequences up-regulated in flag leaves at the grain filling stage relative to the panicle exertion stage. Differential expression of selected genes (encoding 7 transport proteins, the OsNAS3 enzyme and the OsNAC5 transcription factor) was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. We show that OsNAC5 expression is up-regulated by natural (aging) and induced senescence processes (dark, ABA application, high salinity, cold and Fe-deficiency) and its expression is not affected in the presence of 6-benzylaminopurine (a senescence inhibitor) under dark-induced senescence. Salt induction of OsNAC5 expression is abolished by nicotinamide, an inhibitor of ABA effects. This result and the presence of cis-acting elements in the promoter region of the OsNAC5 gene suggest an ABA-dependent regulation. Using four different rice cultivars, we show that OsNAC5 up-regulation is higher and earlier in flag leaves and panicles of IR75862 plants, which have higher seed concentrations of Fe, Zn and protein. We suggest that OsNAC5 is a novel senescence-associated ABA-dependent NAC transcription factor and its function could be related to Fe, Zn and amino acids remobilization from green tissues to seeds.
NA	Transcriptional activation of rice CINNAMOYL-CoA REDUCTASE 10 by OsNAC5, contributes to drought tolerance by modulating lignin accumulation in roots.	2021	Plant Biotechnol J	Crop Biotechnology Institute, GreenBio Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Pyeongchang, Korea.	Drought is a common abiotic stress for terrestrial plants and often affects crop development and yield. Recent studies have suggested that lignin plays a crucial role in plant drought tolerance; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still largely unknown. Here, we report that the rice (Oryza sativa) gene CINNAMOYL-CoA REDUCTASE 10 (OsCCR10) is directly activated by the OsNAC5 transcription factor, which mediates drought tolerance through regulating lignin accumulation. CCR is the first committed enzyme in the monolignol synthesis pathway, and the expression of 26 CCR genes was observed to be induced in rice roots under drought. Subcellular localisation assays revealed that OsCCR10 is a catalytically active enzyme that is localised in the cytoplasm. The OsCCR10 transcript levels were found to increase in response to abiotic stresses, such as drought, high salinity, and abscisic acid (ABA), and transcripts were detected in roots at all developmental stages. In vitro enzyme activity and in vivo lignin composition assay suggested that and G-lignin biosynthesis. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsCCR10 showed improved drought tolerance at the vegetative stages of growth, as well as higher photosynthetic efficiency, lower water loss rates, and higher lignin content in roots compared to non-transgenic (NT) controls. In contrast, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated OsCCR10 knock-out mutants exhibited reduced lignin accumulation in roots and less drought tolerance. Notably, transgenic rice plants with root-preferential overexpression of OsCCR10 exhibited higher grain yield than NT controls plants under field drought conditions, indicating that lignin biosynthesis mediated by OsCCR10 contributes to drought tolerance.
NA	Enhanced expression of OsNAC5 leads to up-regulation of OsNAC6 and changes rice (Oryza sativa L.) ionome.	2023	Genet Mol Biol	Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Centro de Biotecnologia, Programa de Pós-Graduação em Biologia Celular e Molecular (PPGBCM), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.	NAC transcription factors are plant-specific proteins involved in many processes during the plant life cycle and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Previous studies have shown that stress-induced OsNAC5 from rice (Oryza sativa L.) is up-regulated by senescence and might be involved in control of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) concentrations in rice seeds. Aiming a better understanding of the role of OsNAC5 in rice plants, we investigated a mutant line carrying a T-DNA insertion in the promoter of OsNAC5, which resulted in enhanced expression of the transcription factor. Plants with OsNAC5 enhanced expression were shorter at the seedling stage and had reduced yield at maturity. In addition, we evaluated the expression level of OsNAC6, which is co-expressed with OsNAC5, and found that enhanced expression of OsNAC5 leads to increased expression of OsNAC6, suggesting that OsNAC5 might regulate OsNAC6 expression. Ionomic analysis of leaves and seeds from the OsNAC5 enhanced expression line revealed lower Fe and Zn concentrations in leaves and higher Fe concentrations in seeds than in WT plants, further suggesting that OsNAC5 may be involved in regulating the ionome in rice plants. Our work shows that fine-tuning of transcription factors is key when aiming at crop improvement.
