OsNAC5	Enhanced expression of OsNAC5 leads to up-regulation of OsNAC6 and changes rice (Oryza sativa L.) ionome. |  Aiming a better understanding of the role of OsNAC5 in rice plants, we investigated a mutant line carrying a T-DNA insertion in the promoter of OsNAC5, which resulted in enhanced expression of the transcription factor |  Plants with OsNAC5 enhanced expression were shorter at the seedling stage and had reduced yield at maturity |  In addition, we evaluated the expression level of OsNAC6, which is co-expressed with OsNAC5, and found that enhanced expression of OsNAC5 leads to increased expression of OsNAC6, suggesting that OsNAC5 might regulate OsNAC6 expression |  Ionomic analysis of leaves and seeds from the OsNAC5 enhanced expression line revealed lower Fe and Zn concentrations in leaves and higher Fe concentrations in seeds than in WT plants, further suggesting that OsNAC5 may be involved in regulating the ionome in rice plants
