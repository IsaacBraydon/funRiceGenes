J. Exp. Bot.-2006-Ogo-2867-78.pdf	Isolation and characterization of IRO2, a novel iron-regulated bHLH transcription factor in graminaceous plants	2006	J Exp Bot	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	To clarify the molecular mechanism that regulates iron (Fe) acquisition in graminaceous plants, a time-course analysis of gene expression during Fe deficiency stress was conducted using a rice 22K oligo-DNA microarray. Twenty-one genes for proteins that function in gene regulation were induced by Fe deficiency. Of these genes, a putative basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor gene, named OsIRO2, was strongly expressed in both roots and shoots during Fe deficiency stress. The expression of OsIRO2 was induced exclusively by Fe deficiency, and not by deficiencies in other metals. Expression of the barley HvIRO2 gene, which is a homologue of OsIRO2, was also induced by Fe deficiency. An in silico search revealed that IRO2 is highly conserved among graminaceous plants, which include wheat, sorghum, and maize. The cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CASTing) technique revealed that OsIRO2 bound preferentially to the sequence 5'-ACCACGTGGTTTT-3', and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed 5'-CACGTGG-3' as the core sequence for OsIRO2 binding. Sequences similar to the OsIRO2-binding sequence were found upstream of several genes that are involved in Fe acquisition, such as OsNAS1, OsNAS3, OsIRT1, OsFDH, OsAPT1, and IDS3. The core sequence of the OsIRO2-binding sequence occurred more frequently in the upstream regions of Fe deficiency-inducible genes than in the corresponding regions of non-inducible genes. These results suggest that IRO2 is involved in the regulation of gene expression under Fe-deficient conditions.
j.1365-313X.2003.01878.x.pdf	Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron	2003	The Plant Journal	Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Nicotianamine (NA), a chelator of metals, is ubiquitously present in higher plants. In graminaceous plants, NA is a biosynthetic precursor of phytosiderophores and is thus a crucial component for iron (Fe) acquisition. Here, we show that three rice NA synthase (NAS) genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of Fe and that the three genes are differentially regulated by Fe. OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 transcripts were detected in Fe-sufficient roots but not in leaves, and levels of both increased markedly in both roots and leaves in response to Fe deficiency. In contrast, the OsNAS3 transcript was present in leaves but was very low in roots of Fe-sufficient plants. Further, OsNAS3 expression was induced in roots but was suppressed in leaves in response to Fe deficiency. Promoter-GUS analysis revealed that OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 were expressed in Fe-sufficient roots in companion cells and pericycle cells adjacent to the protoxylem. With Fe deficiency, OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 expression extended to all root cells along with an increase in phytosiderophore secretion. In Fe-deficient plants, OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 were expressed in the vascular bundles of green leaves and in all cells of leaves showing severe chlorosis. OsNAS3 expression was restricted to the pericycle and companion cells of the roots, and in companion cells of leaves irrespective of Fe status. These results strongly suggested that NAS and NA play an important role in long-distance transport of Fe in rice plants, in addition to their roles in phytosiderophore secretion from roots.
j.1365-313X.2009.04015.x.pdf	The rice transcription factor IDEF1 is essential for the early response to iron deficiency, and induces vegetative expression of late embryogenesis abundant genes	2009	Plant J	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Higher plants maintain iron homeostasis by regulating the expression of iron (Fe)-related genes in accordance with Fe availability. The transcription factor IDEF1 regulates the response to Fe deficiency in Oryza sativa (rice) by recognizing CATGC sequences within the Fe deficiency-responsive cis-acting element IDE1. To investigate the function of IDEF1 in detail, we analyzed the response to Fe deficiency in transgenic rice plants exhibiting induced or repressed IDEF1 expression. Fe-deficiency treatment in hydroponic culture revealed that IDEF1 knock-down plants are susceptible to early-stage Fe deficiency, in contrast to IDEF1-induced plants. Time-course expression analyses using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR revealed that the IDEF1 expression level was positively correlated with the level of induction of the Fe utilization-related genes OsIRO2, OsYSL15, OsIRT1, OsYSL2, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAS3 and OsDMAS1, just after the onset of Fe starvation. However, this overall transactivation mediated by IDEF1 became less evident in subsequent stages. Microarray and in-silico analyses revealed that genes positively regulated by IDEF1, especially at the early stage, exhibit over-representation of CATGC and IDE1-like elements within the proximal promoter regions. These results indicate the existence of early and subsequent responses to Fe deficiency, with the former requiring IDEF1 more specifically. Proximal regions of IDEF1-regulated gene promoters also showed enrichment of RY elements (CATGCA), which regulate gene expression during seed maturation. The expression of several genes encoding late embryogenesis abundant proteins, including Osem, was induced in Fe-deficient roots and/or leaves in an IDEF1-dependent manner, suggesting a possible function of seed maturation-related genes in Fe-deficient vegetative organs.
PNAS-2009-Lee-22014-9.pdf	Iron fortification of rice seeds through activation of the nicotianamine synthase gene	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Integrative Biosciences and Biotechnology, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang 790-784, Republic of Korea.	The most widespread dietary problem in the world is mineral deficiency. We used the nicotianamine synthase (NAS) gene to increase mineral contents in rice grains. Nicotianamine (NA) is a chelator of metals and a key component of metal homeostasis. We isolated activation-tagged mutant lines in which expression of a rice NAS gene, OsNAS3, was increased by introducing 35S enhancer elements. Shoots and roots of the OsNAS3 activation-tagged plants (OsNAS3-D1) accumulated more Fe and Zn. Seeds from our OsNAS3-D1 plants grown on a paddy field contained elevated amounts of Fe (2.9-fold), Zn (2.2-fold), and Cu (1.7-fold). The NA level was increased 9.6-fold in OsNAS3-D1 seeds. Analysis by size exclusion chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy showed that WT and OsNAS3-D1 seeds contained equal amounts of Fe bound to IP6, whereas OsNAS3-D1 had 7-fold more Fe bound to a low molecular mass, which was likely NA. Furthermore, this activation led to increased tolerance to Fe and Zn deficiencies and to excess metal (Zn, Cu, and Ni) toxicities. In contrast, disruption of OsNAS3 caused an opposite phenotype. To test the bioavailability of Fe, we fed anemic mice with either engineered or WT seeds for 4 weeks and measured their concentrations of hemoglobin and hematocrit. Mice fed with engineered seeds recovered to normal levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit within 2 weeks, whereas those that ate WT seeds remained anemic. Our results suggest that an increase in bioavailable mineral content in rice grains can be achieved by enhancing NAS expression.

Rice is a poor source of micronutrients such as iron and zinc. To help clarify the molecular mechanisms that regulate metal mobilization from leaves to developing seeds, we conducted suppression subtractive hybridization analysis in flag leaves of two rice cultivars. Flag leaves are the major source of remobilized metals for developing seeds. We isolated 78 sequences up-regulated in flag leaves at the grain filling stage relative to the panicle exertion stage. Differential expression of selected genes (encoding 7 transport proteins, the OsNAS3 enzyme and the OsNAC5 transcription factor) was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. We show that OsNAC5 expression is up-regulated by natural (aging) and induced senescence processes (dark, ABA application, high salinity, cold and Fe-deficiency) and its expression is not affected in the presence of 6-benzylaminopurine (a senescence inhibitor) under dark-induced senescence. Salt induction of OsNAC5 expression is abolished by nicotinamide, an inhibitor of ABA effects. This result and the presence of cis-acting elements in the promoter region of the OsNAC5 gene suggest an ABA-dependent regulation. Using four different rice cultivars, we show that OsNAC5 up-regulation is higher and earlier in flag leaves and panicles of IR75862 plants, which have higher seed concentrations of Fe, Zn and protein. We suggest that OsNAC5 is a novel senescence-associated ABA-dependent NAC transcription factor and its function could be related to Fe, Zn and amino acids remobilization from green tissues to seeds.
NA	Nicotianamine Synthesis by OsNAS3 Is Important for Mitigating Iron Excess Stress in Rice.	2019	Front Plant Sci	Research Institute for Bioresources and Biotechnology, Ishikawa Prefectural University, Ishikawa, Japan.	Iron (Fe) toxicity in plants causes tissue damage and cellular homeostasis disorders, thereby affecting plant growth and development. Nicotianamine (NA) is a ubiquitous chelator of metal cations and is responsible for metal homeostasis. Rice has three NA synthase (NAS) genes, of which the expression of OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 but not of OsNAS3 is strongly induced in response to Fe deficiency. Recently, we found that OsNAS3 expression is strongly induced with excess Fe in most rice tissues, particularly old leaves, suggesting that it may play a vital role under excess Fe conditions. However, the mechanism by which OsNAS3 responds to excess Fe in rice remains poorly understood. In this study, we clarified the physiological response of OsNAS3 expression to excess Fe and the role of NA synthesis in this condition. Promoter GUS analyses revealed that OsNAS3 was widely expressed in roots, especially in vascular bundle, epidermis, exodermis, stem, and old leaf tissues under Fe excess compared to control plants. Nicotianamine and deoxymugineic acid (DMA; a type of phytosiderophore synthesized by Strategy II species) were present in roots and shoots under Fe excess likewise under control conditions. In addition, OsNAS3 knockout plants were sensitive to excess Fe, exhibiting inferior growth, reduced dry weight, severer leaf bronzing, and greater Fe accumulation in their leaves than non-transformants with excess Fe. We also observed that NA-overproducing rice was tolerant of excess Fe. These results show that NA synthesized by OsNAS3 under Fe excess condition is to mitigate excess Fe whereas NA synthesized by OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 under normal Fe condition is to enhance Fe translocation, suggesting the different roles and functions of the NA existence between these two conditions. Overall, these findings suggest that rice synthesizes NA with OsNAS3 under Fe excess in roots and shoots, and that NA and DMA within the plant body are important for mitigating excess Fe stress and alleviating other metal deficiencies in rice. This report will be important for the development of tolerant rice adapted to Fe-contaminated soils.
NA	Comparative transcriptome profile analysis of rice varieties with different tolerance to zinc deficiency	2020	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	CAAS-IRRI Joint Laboratory for Genomics-Assisted Germplasm Enhancement, Agricultural Genomics Institute in Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, China.	Zinc (Zn) is an indispensable element for rice growth. Zn deficiency results in brown blotches and streaks 2-3 weeks after transplanting, as well as stunting, reduced tillering, and low productivity of rice plants. These processes are controlled by different families of expressed genes. A comparative transcriptome profile analysis was conducted using the roots of two Zn deficiency tolerant varieties (UCP122 and KALIBORO26) and two sensitive varieties (IR26 and IR64) by merging data from untreated control (CK) and Zn deficiency treated samples. Results revealed a total of 4,688 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the normal Zn and deficient conditions, with 2,702 and 1,489 unique DEGs upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis identified transcription factors (TFs), such as WRKY, MYB, ERF, and bHLH which are important in the regulation of the Zn deficiency response. Furthermore, chitinases, jasmonic acid, and phenylpropanoid pathways were found to be important in the Zn deficiency response. The metal tolerance protein (MTP) genes also appeared to play an important role in conferring tolerance to Zn deficiency. A heavy metal-associated domain-containing protein 7 was associated with tolerance to Zn deficiency and negatively regulated downstream genes. Collectively, our findings provide valuable expression patterns and candidate genes for the study of molecular mechanisms underlying the response to Zn deficiency and for improvements in breeding for tolerance to Zn deficiency in rice.
