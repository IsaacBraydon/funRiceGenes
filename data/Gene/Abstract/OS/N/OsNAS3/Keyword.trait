OsNAS3	root	Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron	In contrast, the OsNAS3 transcript was present in leaves but was very low in roots of Fe-sufficient plants
OsNAS3	root	Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron	Further, OsNAS3 expression was induced in roots but was suppressed in leaves in response to Fe deficiency
OsNAS3	root	Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron	OsNAS3 expression was restricted to the pericycle and companion cells of the roots, and in companion cells of leaves irrespective of Fe status
OsNAS3	root	Iron fortification of rice seeds through activation of the nicotianamine synthase gene	Shoots and roots of the OsNAS3 activation-tagged plants (OsNAS3-D1) accumulated more Fe and Zn
OsNAS3	shoot	Iron fortification of rice seeds through activation of the nicotianamine synthase gene	Shoots and roots of the OsNAS3 activation-tagged plants (OsNAS3-D1) accumulated more Fe and Zn
OsNAS3	seed	Iron fortification of rice seeds through activation of the nicotianamine synthase gene	Seeds from our OsNAS3-D1 plants grown on a paddy field contained elevated amounts of Fe (2
OsNAS3	seed	Iron fortification of rice seeds through activation of the nicotianamine synthase gene	6-fold in OsNAS3-D1 seeds
OsNAS3	seed	Iron fortification of rice seeds through activation of the nicotianamine synthase gene	Analysis by size exclusion chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy showed that WT and OsNAS3-D1 seeds contained equal amounts of Fe bound to IP6, whereas OsNAS3-D1 had 7-fold more Fe bound to a low molecular mass, which was likely NA
OsNAS3	transcription factor	Identification of up-regulated genes in flag leaves during rice grain filling and characterization of OsNAC5, a new ABA-dependent transcription factor	Differential expression of selected genes (encoding 7 transport proteins, the OsNAS3 enzyme and the OsNAC5 transcription factor) was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR
OsNAS3	iron	Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron	Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron
OsNAS3	tolerance	Concomitant Activation of OsNAS2 and OsNAS3 Contributes to the Enhanced Accumulation of Iron and Zinc in Rice.	 Our research suggests that simultaneous activation of OsNAS2 and OsNAS3 can enhance Fe and Zn accumulation in rice grains while also increasing plant tolerance to growing situations with metal deficiency and excess metal availability
OsNAS3	zinc	Concomitant Activation of OsNAS2 and OsNAS3 Contributes to the Enhanced Accumulation of Iron and Zinc in Rice.	Concomitant Activation of OsNAS2 and OsNAS3 Contributes to the Enhanced Accumulation of Iron and Zinc in Rice.
OsNAS3	iron	Concomitant Activation of OsNAS2 and OsNAS3 Contributes to the Enhanced Accumulation of Iron and Zinc in Rice.	Concomitant Activation of OsNAS2 and OsNAS3 Contributes to the Enhanced Accumulation of Iron and Zinc in Rice.
OsNAS3	Fe	Concomitant Activation of OsNAS2 and OsNAS3 Contributes to the Enhanced Accumulation of Iron and Zinc in Rice.	 Our research suggests that simultaneous activation of OsNAS2 and OsNAS3 can enhance Fe and Zn accumulation in rice grains while also increasing plant tolerance to growing situations with metal deficiency and excess metal availability
