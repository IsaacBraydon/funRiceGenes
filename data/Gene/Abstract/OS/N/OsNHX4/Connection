OsNHX1	OsNHX4	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	The exon-intron structure of the OsNHX genes and the phylogenetic tree of the OsNHX proteins suggest that the OsNHX proteins are categorized into two subgroups (OsNHX1 through OsNHX4 and OsNHX5)
OsNHX4	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	The exon-intron structure of the OsNHX genes and the phylogenetic tree of the OsNHX proteins suggest that the OsNHX proteins are categorized into two subgroups (OsNHX1 through OsNHX4 and OsNHX5)
OsC2DP	OsNHX4	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 Furthermore, the qRT-PCR and transcriptomic analysis showed that the expression level of some genes related to salt tolerance were indirectly regulated by OsC2DP, especially OsSOS1 and OsNHX4
