OsNHAD	chloroplast	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).
OsNHAD	chloroplast	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).	 Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis of OsNHAD::GFP fusion in tobacco leaves shows that OsNHAD resides in the chloroplast envelop
OsNHAD	chloroplast	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).	 Knock-down of OsNHAD by RNA interference led to increased rice sensitivity to Na+, manifested by stunted plant growth, enhanced cellular damage, reduced PSII activity and changed chloroplast morphology
OsNHAD	growth	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).	 Complementation test reveals that OsNHAD was able to functionally restore the Arabidopsis mutant atnhd1-1 growth phenotype
OsNHAD	resistance	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).
OsNHAD	salt	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).
OsNHAD	salt	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).	 These results suggest that OsNHAD possibly mediates homeostasis of sodium ions in the subcellular compartments and tissues of the plants when challenged to salt stress
OsNHAD	salt stress	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).
OsNHAD	salt stress	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).	 These results suggest that OsNHAD possibly mediates homeostasis of sodium ions in the subcellular compartments and tissues of the plants when challenged to salt stress
OsNHAD	stress	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).
OsNHAD	stress	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).	 OsNHAD transcripts mainly express in leaves and are induced by Na+ stress
OsNHAD	stress	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).	 These results suggest that OsNHAD possibly mediates homeostasis of sodium ions in the subcellular compartments and tissues of the plants when challenged to salt stress
OsNHAD	plant growth	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).	 Knock-down of OsNHAD by RNA interference led to increased rice sensitivity to Na+, manifested by stunted plant growth, enhanced cellular damage, reduced PSII activity and changed chloroplast morphology
OsNHAD	homeostasis	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).	 These results suggest that OsNHAD possibly mediates homeostasis of sodium ions in the subcellular compartments and tissues of the plants when challenged to salt stress
OsNHAD	transporter	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).
OsNHAD	transporter	OsNHAD is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa).	 In this study, we functionally identified an uncharacterized sodium ion transporter named OsNHAD which encodes a putative Na+ <U+2044> H+ antiporter in rice
