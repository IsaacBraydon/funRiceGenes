OsHKT1;4	OsNAC3	A NAC transcription factor OsNAC3 positively regulates ABA response and salt tolerance in rice.	 Furthermore, qRT-PCR and transcriptomic analysis were performed to identify the key OsNAC3 regulated genes related to ABA response and salt tolerance, such as OsHKT1;4, OsHKT1;5, OsLEA3-1, OsPM-1, OsPP2C68, and OsRAB-21
