In this research, a full-length cDNA clone OsNAC19 (Oryza sativa NAC19), encoding a novel NAC-domain protein, was isolated from a cDNA library prepared with rice leaves infected by incompatible race 131 of blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea). The similarity between OsNAC19 and the members of OsNAC3 subgroup is from 65.87 to 51.53%. One plant-specific NAC domain is located in the N-terminus of OsNAC19. The protein OsNAC19 was localized in the nucleus of onion epidemical cells. The fusion protein of OsNAC19 with GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD) activated the reporter genes LacZ and HIS3 in a yeast assay system, and the activation domain was located within amino acid 181â€<U+393C><U+3E33>240 of its C-terminal region. The expression of gene OsNAC19 was high in rice seedling roots, culms and blade sheathes, but its expression in rice leaves was low. The expression of OsNAC19 in rice leaves could be induced by the infection of blast fungus, and by application of exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA), ABA and ethylene but ethylene had a relatively weak induction effect. These data suggest that OsNAC19 protein is a transcriptional activator involved in rice response to infection by M. grisea and may play a role in the MeJA-mediated signaling pathway.
NA	OsNBL1, a Multi-Organelle Localized Protein, Plays Essential Roles in Rice Senescence, Disease Resistance, and Salt Tolerance	2021	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, MOA Key Lab of Pest Monitoring and Green Management, Department of Plant Pathology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.	Background: Plant senescence is a complicated process involving multiple regulations, such as temperature, light, reactive oxygen species (ROS), endogenous hormone levels, and diseases. Although many such genes have been characterized to understand the process of leaf senescence, there still remain many unknowns, and many more genes need to be characterized.  Results: We identified a rice mutant nbl1 with a premature leaf senescence phenotype. The causative gene, OsNBL1, encodes a small protein with 94 amino acids, which is conserved in monocot, as well as dicot plants. Disruption of OsNBL1 resulted in accelerated dark-induced leaf senescence, accompanied by a reduction in chlorophyll content and up-regulation of several senescence-associated genes. Notably, the nbl1 mutant was more susceptible to rice blast and bacterial blight but more tolerant to sodium chloride. Several salt-induced genes, including HAK1, HAK5, and three SNAC genes, were also up-regulated in the nbl1 mutant. Additionally, the nbl1 mutant was more sensitive to salicylic acid. Plants overexpressing OsNBL1 showed delayed dark-induced senescence, consistent with a higher chlorophyll content compared to wild-type plants. However, the overexpression plants were indistinguishable from the wild-types for resistance to the rice blast disease. OsNBL1 is a multi-organelle localized protein and interacts with OsClpP6, which is associated with senescence.  Conclusions: We described a novel leaf senescence mutant nbl1 in rice. It is showed that OsNBL1, a multi-organelle localized protein which interacts with a plastidic caseinolytic protease OsClpP6, is essential for controlling leaf senescence, disease resistance, and salt tolerance.
NA	A NAC transcription factor OsNAC3 positively regulates ABA response and salt tolerance in rice.	2021	BMC Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530004, China.	BACKGROUND: NAC (NAM, ATAFÂ and CUC) transcription factors (TFs) play vital roles in plant development and abiotic stress tolerance. Salt stress is one of the most limiting factors for rice growth and production. However, the mechanism underlying salt tolerance in rice is still poorly understood. RESULTS: In this study, we functionally characterized a rice NAC TF OsNAC3 for its involvement in ABA response and salt tolerance. ABA and NaCl treatment induced OsNAC3 expression in roots. Immunostaining showed that OsNAC3 was localized in all root cells. OsNAC3 knockout decreased rice plants&#39; sensitivity to ABA but increased salt stress sensitivity, while OsNAC3 overexpression showed an opposite effect. Loss of OsNAC3 also induced Na(+) accumulation in the shoots. Furthermore, qRT-PCR and transcriptomic analysis were performed to identify the key OsNAC3 regulated genes related to ABA response and salt tolerance, such as OsHKT1;4, OsHKT1;5, OsLEA3-1, OsPM-1, OsPP2C68, and OsRAB-21. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that rice OsNAC3 is an important regulatory factor in ABA signal response and salt tolerance.
