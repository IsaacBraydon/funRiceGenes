OsNAC3	transcription factor	A NAC transcription factor OsNAC3 positively regulates ABA response and salt tolerance in rice.	A NAC transcription factor OsNAC3 positively regulates ABA response and salt tolerance in rice.
OsNAC3	root	A NAC transcription factor OsNAC3 positively regulates ABA response and salt tolerance in rice.	 Immunostaining showed that OsNAC3 was localized in all root cells
OsNAC3	salt	A NAC transcription factor OsNAC3 positively regulates ABA response and salt tolerance in rice.	A NAC transcription factor OsNAC3 positively regulates ABA response and salt tolerance in rice.
OsNAC3	salt	A NAC transcription factor OsNAC3 positively regulates ABA response and salt tolerance in rice.	 RESULTS: In this study, we functionally characterized a rice NAC TF OsNAC3 for its involvement in ABA response and salt tolerance
OsNAC3	salt	A NAC transcription factor OsNAC3 positively regulates ABA response and salt tolerance in rice.	 OsNAC3 knockout decreased rice plants&#39; sensitivity to ABA but increased salt stress sensitivity, while OsNAC3 overexpression showed an opposite effect
OsNAC3	salt	A NAC transcription factor OsNAC3 positively regulates ABA response and salt tolerance in rice.	 Furthermore, qRT-PCR and transcriptomic analysis were performed to identify the key OsNAC3 regulated genes related to ABA response and salt tolerance, such as OsHKT1;4, OsHKT1;5, OsLEA3-1, OsPM-1, OsPP2C68, and OsRAB-21
