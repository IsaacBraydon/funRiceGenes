OsABA8ox1	OsNCED1|OsCCD4a	Phosphorylation of D-allose by hexokinase involved in regulation of OsABF1 expression for growth inhibition in Oryza sativa L	In this study, we discovered that D-allose induced expression of ABA-related genes including OsNCED1-3 and OsABA8ox1-3 in rice
OsCCD1	OsNCED1|OsCCD4a	RNAi-mediated Suppression of Three Rice Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenase Genes, OsCCD1, 4a, and 4b, Increases Carotenoid Content of Rice.	 Suppression of the OsCCD1, OsCCD4a, and OsCCD4b genes using RNA interference (Ri) was verified in transgenic rice plants by quantitative RT-PCR and small RNA detection
OsCCD1	OsNCED1|OsCCD4a	RNAi-mediated Suppression of Three Rice Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenase Genes, OsCCD1, 4a, and 4b, Increases Carotenoid Content of Rice.	 In addition, the levels of four carotenoids decreased when OsCCD1, OsCCD4a, and OsCCD4b were overexpressed in E
OsCCD1	OsNCED1|OsCCD4a	RNAi-mediated Suppression of Three Rice Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenase Genes, OsCCD1, 4a, and 4b, Increases Carotenoid Content of Rice.	 OsCCD1 and OsCCD4a had a similar high carotenoid degrading activity, followed by OsCCD4b without substrate specificity
HOX12|Oshox12	OsNCED1|OsCCD4a	дк-Carotene Isomerase Suppresses Tillering in Rice through the Coordinated Biosynthesis of Strigolactone and Abscisic Acid	 Importantly, rac-GR24 also stimulated expression of Oryza sativa 9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE 1 (OsNCED1) through induction of Oryza sativa HOMEOBOX12 (OsHOX12), promoting ABA biosynthesis in shoot base
