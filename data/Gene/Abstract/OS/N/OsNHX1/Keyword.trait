OsNHX1	abiotic stress	"OsbZIP71, a bZIP transcription factor, confers salinity and drought tolerance in rice"	" Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the abiotic stress-related genes, OsVHA-B, OsNHX1, COR413-TM1, and OsMyb4, were up-regulated in overexpressing lines, while these same genes were down-regulated in RNAi lines"
OsNHX1	salt	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	" The expression of OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 is regulated differently in rice tissues and is increased by salt stress, hyperosmotic stress, and ABA"
OsNHX1	lateral root	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 When we studied the expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by either the OsNHX1 or the OsNHX5 promoter, we observed activity in the stele, the emerging part of lateral roots, the vascular bundle, the water pore, and the basal part of seedling shoots with both promoters
OsNHX1	shoot	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 When we studied the expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by either the OsNHX1 or the OsNHX5 promoter, we observed activity in the stele, the emerging part of lateral roots, the vascular bundle, the water pore, and the basal part of seedling shoots with both promoters
OsNHX1	salt	Molecular cloning and expression of the Na+/H+ exchanger gene in Oryza sativa	" These results suggest that the product of the novel gene, OsNHX1, functions as a Na+/H+ exchanger, and plays important roles in salt tolerance of rice"
OsNHX1	salt tolerance	"Function, intracellular localization and the importance in salt tolerance of a vacuolar Na(+)/H(+) antiporter from rice"	" In addition, overexpression of OsNHX1 improved the salt tolerance of transgenic rice cells and plants| These results suggest that OsNHX1 on the tonoplasts plays important roles in the compartmentation of Na(+) and K(+) highly accumulated in the cytoplasm into the vacuoles, and the amount of the antiporter is one of the most important factors determining salt tolerance in rice"
OsNHX1	root	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 When we studied the expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by either the OsNHX1 or the OsNHX5 promoter, we observed activity in the stele, the emerging part of lateral roots, the vascular bundle, the water pore, and the basal part of seedling shoots with both promoters| OsNHX1 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the guard cells and trichome, whereas OsNHX5 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the root tip and pollen grains
OsNHX1	root	Function, intracellular localization and the importance in salt tolerance of a vacuolar Na(+)/H(+) antiporter from rice	 Treatment with high concentrations of NaCl and KCl increased the transcript levels of OsNHX1 in rice roots and shoots
OsNHX1	pollen	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 OsNHX1 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the guard cells and trichome, whereas OsNHX5 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the root tip and pollen grains
OsNHX1	shoot	Function, intracellular localization and the importance in salt tolerance of a vacuolar Na(+)/H(+) antiporter from rice	 Treatment with high concentrations of NaCl and KCl increased the transcript levels of OsNHX1 in rice roots and shoots

OsNHX1	grain	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 OsNHX1 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the guard cells and trichome, whereas OsNHX5 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the root tip and pollen grains
OsNHX1	seedling	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 When we studied the expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by either the OsNHX1 or the OsNHX5 promoter, we observed activity in the stele, the emerging part of lateral roots, the vascular bundle, the water pore, and the basal part of seedling shoots with both promoters
