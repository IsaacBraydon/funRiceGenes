OsNHX1	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 The exon-intron structure of the OsNHX genes and the phylogenetic tree of the OsNHX proteins suggest that the OsNHX proteins are categorized into two subgroups (OsNHX1 through OsNHX4 and OsNHX5)
OsNHX1	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 can suppress the Na+, Li+, and hygromycin sensitivity of yeast nhx1 mutants and their sensitivity to a high K+ concentration
OsNHX1	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 The expression of OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 is regulated differently in rice tissues and is increased by salt stress, hyperosmotic stress, and ABA
OsNHX1	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 When we studied the expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by either the OsNHX1 or the OsNHX5 promoter, we observed activity in the stele, the emerging part of lateral roots, the vascular bundle, the water pore, and the basal part of seedling shoots with both promoters
OsNHX1	OsNHX5	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 OsNHX1 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the guard cells and trichome, whereas OsNHX5 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the root tip and pollen grains
OsNHX1	OsNHX4	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 The exon-intron structure of the OsNHX genes and the phylogenetic tree of the OsNHX proteins suggest that the OsNHX proteins are categorized into two subgroups (OsNHX1 through OsNHX4 and OsNHX5)
OsNHX1	OsNHX2|OsNHX3	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 can suppress the Na+, Li+, and hygromycin sensitivity of yeast nhx1 mutants and their sensitivity to a high K+ concentration
OsNHX1	OsNHX2|OsNHX3	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	 The expression of OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 is regulated differently in rice tissues and is increased by salt stress, hyperosmotic stress, and ABA
Osmyb4	OsNHX1	OsbZIP71, a bZIP transcription factor, confers salinity and drought tolerance in rice	 Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the abiotic stress-related genes, OsVHA-B, OsNHX1, COR413-TM1, and OsMyb4, were up-regulated in overexpressing lines, while these same genes were down-regulated in RNAi lines
OsbZIP71	OsNHX1	OsbZIP71, a bZIP transcription factor, confers salinity and drought tolerance in rice	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that OsbZIP71 directly binds the promoters of OsNHX1 and COR413-TM1 in vivo
OsNHX1	OsPEX11	OsPEX11, a Peroxisomal Biogenesis Factor 11, Contributes to Salt Stress Tolerance in Oryza sativa.	 Furthermore, qPCR data suggested that OsPEX11 acted as a positive regulator of salt tolerance by reinforcing the expression of several well-known rice transporters (OsHKT2;1, OsHKT1;5, OsLti6a, OsLti6b, OsSOS1, OsNHX1, and OsAKT1) involved in Na(+)/K(+) homeostasis in transgenic plants under salinity
