We isolated a rice cDNA clone the deduced amino acid sequence of which had homology with a putative Na+/H+ exchanger in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, NHX1. The sequence contains 2330 bp with an open reading frame of 1608 bp. The deduced amino acid sequence is similar to that of NHX1 and NHE isoforms in mammals, and shares high similarity with the sequences within predicted transmembrane segments and an amiloride-binding domain. The expression of the gene was increased by salt stress. These results suggest that the product of the novel gene, OsNHX1, functions as a Na+/H+ exchanger, and plays important roles in salt tolerance of rice.
1-s2.0-S016894520500419X-main.pdf	Salt-dependent regulation of chloride channel transcripts in rice	2006	Plant Science	Research Institute for Food Science, Kyoto University, Uji, Kyoto 611-0011, Japan	A ferredoxin cDNA was isolated from a Î»gt 11 cDNA library constructed from nitrate-induced rice (Oryza sativa L.) roots. The root Fd cDNA clone (pFDRR) was 603 bp long which contained 261-bp 5â€‘ù<U+3E32> region encoding the C-terminal 72 amino acid residues and 342-bp 3â€‘ù<U+3E32> noncoding region. A genomic clone was isolated from a Î»EMBL3 rice genomic library using pFDRR as a probe and its nucleotide sequence was identical with that of the cDNA clone in their overlapping region. The root Fd gene contained 1091-bp 5â€‘ù<U+3E32> upstream, 444-bp coding and 294-bp 3â€‘ù<U+3E32> noncoding regions. The transcription start site locates 46 bp upstream of the ATG translation initiation codon. In the 5â€‘ù<U+3E32> flanking region, two GATA elements and a TCCGCGGA-like sequence are located in addition to TATA box-like and CAAT sequences. Homology between the rice root and leaf Fds showed 60%, while the former protein shared much higher identity with other nonphotosynthetic Fds (66â€<U+393C><U+3E33>88%). Southern blot analysis using pFDRR and the rice leaf Fd cDNA (pFDRL) as a DNA probe identified their corresponding genomic Fd DNA. Expression of the root Fd gene was induced in response to nitrate and ammonium.
art-10.1007-s00425-010-1289-4.pdf	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes	2011	Planta	Division of Plant Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. fukuda@affrc.go.jp	We previously cloned a vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter gene (OsNHX1) from rice (Oryza sativa). Here we identified four additional NHX-type antiporter genes in rice (OsNHX2 through OsNHX5) and performed molecular and functional analyses of those genes. The exon-intron structure of the OsNHX genes and the phylogenetic tree of the OsNHX proteins suggest that the OsNHX proteins are categorized into two subgroups (OsNHX1 through OsNHX4 and OsNHX5). OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 can suppress the Na+, Li+, and hygromycin sensitivity of yeast nhx1 mutants and their sensitivity to a high K+ concentration. The expression of OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 is regulated differently in rice tissues and is increased by salt stress, hyperosmotic stress, and ABA. When we studied the expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by either the OsNHX1 or the OsNHX5 promoter, we observed activity in the stele, the emerging part of lateral roots, the vascular bundle, the water pore, and the basal part of seedling shoots with both promoters. In addition, each promoter had a unique expression pattern. OsNHX1 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the guard cells and trichome, whereas OsNHX5 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the root tip and pollen grains. Our results suggest that the members of this gene family play important roles in the compartmentalization into vacuoles of the Na+ and K+ that accumulate in the cytoplasm and that the differential regulation of antiporter gene expression in different rice tissues may be an important factor determining salt tolerance in rice.
Plant Cell Physiol-2004-Fukuda-146-59.pdf	Function, intracellular localization and the importance in salt tolerance of a vacuolar Na(+)/H(+) antiporter from rice	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602 Japan. fukuda@affrc.go.jp	We examined the function and intracellular localization of the product of the Na(+)/H(+) antiporter gene (OsNHX1) cloned from rice (Oryza sativa). OsNHX1 has the ability to suppress Na(+), Li(+) and hygromycin sensitivity of yeast nhx1 mutants and sensitivity to a high K(+) concentration, a novel phenotype of the nhx1 mutants. Analysis using rice cells expressing a fusion protein of OsNHX1 and green fluorescent protein and Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for OsNHX1 confirmed the localization of OsNHX1 on the tonoplasts. These results indicate that the OsNHX1 gene encodes a vacuolar (Na(+), K(+))/H(+) antiporter. Treatment with high concentrations of NaCl and KCl increased the transcript levels of OsNHX1 in rice roots and shoots. In addition, overexpression of OsNHX1 improved the salt tolerance of transgenic rice cells and plants. These results suggest that OsNHX1 on the tonoplasts plays important roles in the compartmentation of Na(+) and K(+) highly accumulated in the cytoplasm into the vacuoles, and the amount of the antiporter is one of the most important factors determining salt tolerance in rice.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs11103-013-0115-3.pdf	OsbZIP71, a bZIP transcription factor, confers salinity and drought tolerance in rice	2014	Plant Mol Biol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	The bZIP transcription factor (TF) family plays an important role in the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway of abiotic stress in plants. We here report the cloning and characterization of OsbZIP71, which encodes a rice bZIP TF. Functional analysis showed that OsbZIP71 is a nuclear-localized protein that specifically binds to the G-box motif, but has no transcriptional activity both in yeast and rice protoplasts. In yeast two-hybrid assays, OsbZIP71 can form both homodimers and heterodimers with Group C members of the bZIP gene family. Expression of OsbZIP71 was strongly induced by drought, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and ABA treatments, but repressed by salt treatment. OsbZIP71 overexpressing (p35S::OsbZIP71) rice significantly improved tolerance to drought, salt and PEG osmotic stresses. In contrast, RNAi knockdown transgenic lines were much more sensitive to salt, PEG osmotic stresses, and also ABA treatment. Inducible expression (RD29A::OsbZIP71) lines were significantly improved their tolerance to PEG osmotic stresses, but hypersensitivity to salt, and insensitivity to ABA. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the abiotic stress-related genes, OsVHA-B, OsNHX1, COR413-TM1, and OsMyb4, were up-regulated in overexpressing lines, while these same genes were down-regulated in RNAi lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that OsbZIP71 directly binds the promoters of OsNHX1 and COR413-TM1 in vivo. These results suggest that OsbZIP71 may play an important role in ABA-mediated drought and salt tolerance in rice.
NA	Enhanced Salt Tolerance Conferred by the Complete 2.3 kb cDNA of the Rice Vacuolar Na(+)/H(+) Antiporter Gene Compared to 1.9 kb Coding Region with 5' UTR in Transgenic Lines of Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Plant Biotechnology Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Dhaka Dhaka, Bangladesh.	Soil salinity is one of the most challenging problems that restricts the normal growth and production of rice worldwide. It has therefore become very important to produce more saline tolerant rice varieties. This study shows constitutive over-expression of the vacuolar Na(+)/H(+) antiporter gene (OsNHX1) from the rice landrace (Pokkali) and attainment of enhanced level of salinity tolerance in transgenic rice plants. It also shows that inclusion of the complete un-translated regions (UTRs) of the alternatively spliced OsNHX1 gene provides a higher level of tolerance to the transgenic rice. Two separate transformation events of the OsNHX1 gene, one with 1.9 kb region containing the 5' UTR with CDS and the other of 2.3 kb, including 5' UTR, CDS, and the 3' UTR regions were performed. The transgenic plants with these two different constructs were advanced to the T3 generation and physiological and molecular screening of homozygous plants was conducted at seedling and reproductive stages under salinity (NaCl) stress. Both transgenic lines were observed to be tolerant compared to WT plants at both physiological stages. However, the transgenic lines containing the CDS with both the 5' and 3' UTR were significantly more tolerant compared to the transgenic lines containing OsNHX1 gene without the 3' UTR. At the seedling stage at 12 dS/m stress, the chlorophyll content was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) and the electrolyte leakage significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) in the order 2.3 kb &gt; 1.9 kb &gt; and WT lines. Yield in g/plant in the best line from the 2.3 kb plants was significantly more (P &lt; 0.01) compared, respectively, to the best 1.9 kb line and WT plants at stress of 6 dS/m. Transformation with the complete transcripts rather than the CDS may therefore provide more durable level of tolerance.
NA	Alterations in stomatal response to fluctuating light increase biomass and yield of rice under drought conditions	2020	Plant Journal	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Shanghai, 200032, China.	The acceleration of stomatal closure upon high to low light transition could improve plant water use efficiency and drought tolerance. Herein, using genome-wide association study, we showed that the genetic variation in OsNHX1 was strongly associated with the changes in ¦Ócl , the time constant of stomatal closure, in 206 rice accessions. OsNHX1 overexpression in rice resulted in a decrease in ¦Ócl , and an increase in biomass, grain yield under drought. Conversely, OsNHX1 knockout by CRISPR/CAS9 shows opposite trends for these traits. We further found three haplotypes spanning the OsNHX1 promoter and CDS regions. Two among them, HapII and HapIII, were found to be associated with a high and low ¦Ócl , respectively. A near-isogenic line (NIL, S464) was developed through replacing the genomic region harboring HapII (~10 kb) from MH63 (recipient) rice cultivar by the same sized genomic region containing Hap III from 02428 (donor). Compared with MH63, S464 shows a reduction by 35% in ¦Ócl and an increase by 40% in the grain yield under drought. However, under normal conditions, S464 maintains closely similar grain yield as MH63. The global distribution of the two OsNHX1 haplotypes is associated with the local precipitation. Taken together, the natural variation in OsNHX1 could be utilized to manipulate the stomatal dynamics for an improved rice drought tolerance.
NA	Histone deacetylase HDA710 controls salt tolerance by regulating ABA signaling in rice	2020	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agriculture University, Wuhan, 430030, China.	Plants have evolved numerous mechanisms that assist them in withstanding environmental stresses. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play crucial roles in plant stress responses; however, their regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we explored the function of HDA710/OsHDAC2, a member of the HDAC RPD3/HDA1 family, in stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa). We established that HDA710 localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm and is involved in regulating the acetylation of histone H3 and H4, specifically targeting H4K5 and H4K16 under normal conditions. HDA710 transcript accumulation levels were strongly induced by abiotic stresses including drought and salinity, as well as by the phytohormones jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA). hda710 knockout mutant plants showed enhanced salinity tolerance and reduced ABA sensitivity, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing HDA710 displayed the opposite phenotypes. Moreover, ABA- and salt-stress-responsive genes, such as OsLEA3, OsABI5, OsbZIP72, and OsNHX1, were upregulated in hda710 compared with wild-type plants. These expression differences corresponded with higher levels of histone H4 acetylation in gene promoter regions in hda710 compared with the wild type under ABA and salt-stress treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that HDA710 is involved in regulating ABA- and salt-stress-responsive genes by altering H4 acetylation levels in their promoters.

NA	Gene Expression Dynamics in Rice Peduncles at the Heading Stage	2020	Front Genet	Grass Genetics and Informatics Group, School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.	Improving grain yield in the staple food crop rice has been long sought goal of plant biotechnology. One of the traits with significant impact on rice breeding programs is peduncle elongation at the time of heading failing which leads to significant reduction in grain yield due to incomplete panicle exsertion. To decipher transcriptional dynamics and molecular players underlying peduncle elongation, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of elongating and non-elongating peduncles in two Indian cultivars, Swarna and Pokkali, at the time of heading. Along with genes associated with cell division and cell wall biosynthesis, we observed significant enrichment of genes associated with auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis/signaling in the elongating peduncles before heading in both the genotypes. Similarly, genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and mobilization, abiotic stress response along with cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene biosynthesis/signaling were enriched in non-elongating peduncles post heading. Significant enrichment of genes belonging to key transcription factor families highlights their specialized roles in peduncle elongation and grain filling before and after heading, respectively. A comparison with anther/pollen development-related genes provided 76 candidates with overlapping roles in anther/pollen development and peduncle elongation. Some of these are important for carbohydrate remobilization to the developing grains. These can be engineered to combat with incomplete panicle exsertion in male sterile lines and manipulate carbohydrate dynamics in grasses. Overall, this study provides baseline information about potential target genes for engineering peduncle elongation with implications on plant height, biomass composition and grain yields in rice.
