Crop straws represent enormous biomass resource that mainly contain secondary cell walls (SCWs) consisting of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanism of SCW biosynthesis still needs to be well understood. In this study, we identified a rice NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, CUC2) transcription factor OsNAC055 that regulates GA-mediated lignin biosynthesis. As a nucleus-localized transcription factor, OsNAC055 exhibits the transcriptional activation activity. Overexpression of OsNAC055 increases the lignin content in rice straw. Transcriptomic analyses showed that the expression of multiple lignin biosynthetic genes was increased in OsNAC055-overexpressing plants. Further ChIP-qPCR analysis and transient transactivation assays indicated that OsNAC055 directly activates rice lignin biosynthetic genes CINNAMOYL-CoA REDUCTASE 10 (OsCCR10) and CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE 2 (OsCAD2) by binding to their promoters. On the other hand, phytohormone measurement showed that OsNAC055 overexpression significantly increased exogenous GA3 levels in rice plants by regulating GA biosynthetic gene OsGA20ox2. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complement (BiFC) assays indicated that OsNAC055 interacts with SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), the repressor in GA signaling. More importantly, exogenous GA treatment markedly enhanced the transcription of OsCCR10 and OsCAD2, suggesting the role of GA in lignin biosynthesis. Together, our results provide the evidence that OsNAC055 functions as an essential transcription factor to regulate the GA-mediated lignin biosynthesis, which provides a strategy for manipulating lignin production.
