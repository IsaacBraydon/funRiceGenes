GH2|OsCAD2	OsNAC055	Transcription factor OsNAC055 regulates GA-mediated lignin biosynthesis in rice straw.	 Further ChIP-qPCR analysis and transient transactivation assays indicated that OsNAC055 directly activates rice lignin biosynthetic genes CINNAMOYL-CoA REDUCTASE 10 (OsCCR10) and CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE 2 (OsCAD2) by binding to their promoters

OsNAC055	sd1|GA20ox2|OsGA20ox2	Transcription factor OsNAC055 regulates GA-mediated lignin biosynthesis in rice straw.	 On the other hand, phytohormone measurement showed that OsNAC055 overexpression significantly increased exogenous GA3 levels in rice plants by regulating GA biosynthetic gene OsGA20ox2
OsNAC055	SLR1|OsGAI|OsSLR1	Transcription factor OsNAC055 regulates GA-mediated lignin biosynthesis in rice straw.	 Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complement (BiFC) assays indicated that OsNAC055 interacts with SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), the repressor in GA signaling
