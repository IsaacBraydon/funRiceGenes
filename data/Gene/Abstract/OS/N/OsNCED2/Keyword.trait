OsNCED2	anther	ABA regulates apoplastic sugar transport and is a potential signal for cold-induced pollen sterility in rice	 The differences in endogenous ABA levels in Doongara and R31 correlated with differences in expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes encoding zeaxanthin epoxidase (OSZEP1) and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (OSNCED2, OSNCED3) in anthers

OsNCED2	 ABA 	A rice F-box gene, OsFbx352, is involved in glucose-delayed seed germination in rice	 Overexpression of OsFbx352 led to a reduction in expression of genes responsible for ABA synthesis (OsNced2, OsNced3) and an increase in expression of genes encoding ABA catabolism (OsAba-ox2, OsAba-ox3) in the presence of glucose
