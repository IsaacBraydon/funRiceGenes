OsNCED2	OsNCED3	A rice F-box gene, OsFbx352, is involved in glucose-delayed seed germination in rice	Overexpression of OsFbx352 led to a reduction in expression of genes responsible for ABA synthesis (OsNced2, OsNced3) and an increase in expression of genes encoding ABA catabolism (OsAba-ox2, OsAba-ox3) in the presence of glucose

OsABA1|OSZEP1	OsNCED2	ABA regulates apoplastic sugar transport and is a potential signal for cold-induced pollen sterility in rice	The differences in endogenous ABA levels in Doongara and R31 correlated with differences in expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes encoding zeaxanthin epoxidase (OSZEP1) and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (OSNCED2, OSNCED3) in anthers

OsLTPL23	OsNCED2	Rice lipid transfer protein, OsLTPL23, controls seed germination by regulating starch-sugar conversion and ABA homeostasis.	 Transcript profiles in the germinating seeds exhibited that the abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive genes, OsABI3 and OsABI5, and biosynthesis genes, OsNCED1, OsNCED2, OsNCED3 and OsNCED4, are obviously upregulated in the osltpl23 mutants compared to NIP plants, conversely, ABA metabolism genes OsABA8ox1, OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3 are stepwise decreased
