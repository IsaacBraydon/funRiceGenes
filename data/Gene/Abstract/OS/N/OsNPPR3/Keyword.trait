OsNPPR3|FLO14	development	Lose-of-Function of a Rice Nucleolus-Localized Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Is Responsible for the floury endosperm14 Mutant Phenotypes.	 Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that OsNPPR3 was universally expressed in various tissues, with pronounced levels during rice endosperm development
OsNPPR3|FLO14	mitochondria	Lose-of-Function of a Rice Nucleolus-Localized Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Is Responsible for the floury endosperm14 Mutant Phenotypes.	 Molecular analysis further suggested that OsNPPR3 was involved in the regulation of expression levels and splicing of a few genes in mitochondria
OsNPPR3|FLO14	endosperm	Lose-of-Function of a Rice Nucleolus-Localized Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Is Responsible for the floury endosperm14 Mutant Phenotypes.	 Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that OsNPPR3 was universally expressed in various tissues, with pronounced levels during rice endosperm development
OsNPPR3|FLO14	endosperm development	Lose-of-Function of a Rice Nucleolus-Localized Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Is Responsible for the floury endosperm14 Mutant Phenotypes.	 Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that OsNPPR3 was universally expressed in various tissues, with pronounced levels during rice endosperm development
