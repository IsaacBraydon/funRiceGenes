The endosperm of rice (Oryza sativa) has been usually used for the study of starch synthesis. Although several related factors have been revealed, other unknown members remain to be identified, given that starch synthesis is a complicated and sophisticated process.Here, we identified and characterized a new rice seed mutant, floury endosperm14 (flo14), which showed chalked endosperm and seed-lethal phenotypes. Map-based cloning indicated FLO14 encodes a novel P-family PPR protein which contains ten PPR motifs. Afterwards the gene was named OsNPPR3. Subcellular localization showed OsNPPR3 was targeted to nucleolus. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that OsNPPR3 was universally expressed in various tissues, with pronounced levels during rice endosperm development. Molecular analysis further suggested that OsNPPR3 was involved in the regulation of expression levels and splicing of a few genes in mitochondria.The study demonstrates that the nucleolus-localized PPR protein is responsible for the flo14 mutant phenotypes through affecting nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression and splicing.
