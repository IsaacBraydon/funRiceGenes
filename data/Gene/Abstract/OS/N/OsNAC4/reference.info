emboj200939a.pdf	The transcription factor OsNAC4 is a key positive regulator of plant hypersensitive cell death	2009	EMBO J	Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Takayama Ikoma, Nara, Japan.	The hypersensitive response (HR) is a common feature of plant immune responses and a type of programmed cell death. However, little is known about the induction mechanism of HR cell death. We report that overexpression of OsNAC4, which encodes a plant-specific transcription factor, leads to HR cell death accompanied by the loss of plasma membrane integrity, nuclear DNA fragmentation and typical morphological changes. In OsNAC4 knock-down lines, HR cell death is markedly decreased in response to avirulent bacterial strains. After induction by an avirulent pathogen recognition signal, OsNAC4 is translocated into the nucleus in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. A microarray analysis showed that the expression of 139 genes including OsHSP90 and IREN, encoding a Ca(2+)-dependent nuclease, were different between the OsNAC4 knock-down line and control line during HR cell death. During the induction of HR cell death, OsHSP90 is involved in the loss of plasma membrane integrity, whereas IREN causes nuclear DNA fragmentation. Overall, our results indicate that two important events occurring during HR cell death are regulated by independent pathways.

The hypersensitive response (HR) is a form of programmed cell death (PCD) commonly associated with the immune response in plants. HR cell death is often characterized by DNA fragmentation, loss of plasma membrane integrity, protein degradation and typical morphological changes such as plasma membrane shrinkage and nuclear condensation. Initiation of HR cell death requires de novo protein synthesis, suggesting that HR cell death induction involves a transcriptional network regulated by a key factor. We recently identified the OsNAC4 gene, which encodes a plant-specific transcription factor that exhibited rapid but transient transcriptional activation during the early stages of HR cell death. Overexpression of OsNAC4 in rice plants induced cell death accompanied by all characteristics of HR cell death: DNA fragmentation, loss of plasma membrane integrity, and protein degradation. In OsNAC4 RNAi knock-down lines exposed to an avirulent bacterial strain, the cellular response was characterized by a marked decrease in HR cell death compared to wild-type rice cells. Gene expression profiling, which compared rice cells and OsNAC4 knock-down transformants using a rice cDNA microarray, demonstrated that OsNAC4 controls the transcription of at least 139 genes including OsHSP90, involved in loss of plasma membrane integrity, and IREN, which encodes novel plant nuclease involved in cleavage of nuclear DNA. Here we report that although OsNAC4 overexpression caused rapid protein degradation during HR cell death, neither IREN nor OsHSP90 were involved. Thus, three important processes that accompany HR cell death are regulated by independent signaling pathways that are collectively induced by OsNAC4.
NA	A histone deacetylase inhibitor enhances rice immunity by derepressing the expression of defense-related genes.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Hubei Engineering Research Center for Specialty Flowers Biological Breeding/College of Bioengineering, Jingchu University of Technology, Jingmen, China.	Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACis) have been widely used in plants to investigate the role of histone acetylation, particularly the function of HDACs, in the regulation of development and stress response. However, how histone acetylation is involved in rice (Oryza sativa L.) disease resistance has hardly been studied. In this paper, four HDACis including Sodium butyrate (NaBT), Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid (SAHA), LBH-589 and Trichostatin A (TSA) were used to treat rice seedlings at different concentrations before inoculation of Magnaporthe oryzae. We found that only 10mM NaBT treatment can significantly enhanced rice blast resistance. However, treatment of the four HDACis all increased global histone acetylation but at different sites, suggesting that the inhibition selectivity of these HDACis is different. Notably, the global H3K9ac level was dramatically elevated after both NaBT and LBH589 treatment although LBH589 could not enhance rice blast resistance. This indicates that the HDACs they inhibit target different genes. In accordance with the phenotype, transcriptomic analysis showed that many defense-related genes were up-regulated by NaBT treatment. Up-regulation of the four genes bsr-d1, PR10B, OsNAC4, OsKS4 were confirmed by RT-qPCR. ChIP-qPCR results revealed that H3K9ac level on these genes was increased after NaBT treatment, suggesting that these defense-related genes were repressed by HDACs. In addition, by promoter motif analysis of the genes that induced by both NaBT treatment and rice blast infection, we found that the motifs bound by ERF and AHL transcription factors (TFs) were the most abundant, which demonstrates that ERF and AHL proteins may act as the candidate TFs that recruit HDACs to defense-related genes to repress their expression when plants are not infected by rice blast.
