OsNPR1|NH1	The systemic acquired resistance regulator OsNPR1 Attenuates Growth by Repressing Auxin Signaling and promoting IAA-amido synthase expression. |  However, the growth and development of the OsNPR1 overexpression (OsNPR1-OX) plants were restrained, and the mechanism remained elusive	 However, the growth and development of the OsNPR1 overexpression (OsNPR1-OX) plants were restrained, and the mechanism remained elusive
OsNPR1|NH1	 Overexpression of OsNPR1 significantly increases rice resistance to Xoo |  Although some downstream rice genes were found to be regulated by OsNPR1, how OsNPR1 affects the interaction of rice-Xoo and alters Xoo gene expression remains unknown |  Many virulence genes of Xoo, including genes encoding components of type III and other secretion systems, were downregulated by OsNPR1 overexpression |  Our results suggest that OsNPR1 enhances rice resistance to Xoo by bidirectionally regulating gene expression in rice and Xoo	 Overexpression of OsNPR1 significantly increases rice resistance to Xoo |  Many virulence genes of Xoo, including genes encoding components of type III and other secretion systems, were downregulated by OsNPR1 overexpression
