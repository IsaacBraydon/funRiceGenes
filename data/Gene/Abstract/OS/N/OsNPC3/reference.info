NA	Overexpression of OsERF106MZ promotes parental root growth in rice seedlings by relieving the ABA-mediated inhibition of root growth under salinity stress conditions.	2023	BMC Plant Biol	Department of Agronomy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.	BACKGROUND: Roots are essential for plant growth and have a variety of functions, such as anchoring the plant to the ground, absorbing water and nutrients from the soil, and sensing abiotic stresses, among others. OsERF106MZ is a salinity-induced gene that is expressed in germinating seeds and rice seedling roots. However, the roles of OsERF106MZ in root growth remain poorly understood. RESULTS: Histochemical staining to examine β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity in transgenic rice seedlings harboring OsERF106MZp::GUS indicated that OsERF106MZ is mainly expressed in the root exodermis, sclerenchyma layer, and vascular system. OsERF106MZ overexpression in rice seedlings leads to an increase in primary root (PR) length. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is thought to act as a hidden architect of root system structure. The expression of the ABA biosynthetic gene OsAO3 is downregulated in OsERF106MZ-overexpressing roots under normal conditions, while the expression of OsNPC3, an AtNPC4 homolog involved in ABA sensitivity, is reduced in OsERF106MZ-overexpressing roots under both normal and NaCl-treated conditions. Under normal conditions, OsERF106MZ-overexpressing roots show a significantly reduced ABA level; moreover, exogenous application of 1.0 µM ABA can suppress OsERF106MZ-mediated root growth promotion. Additionally, OsERF106MZ-overexpressing roots display less sensitivity to ABA-mediated root growth inhibition when treated with 5.0 µM ABA under normal conditions or exposed to NaCl-treated conditions. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR and luciferase (LUC) reporter assays showed that OsERF106MZ can bind directly to the sequence containing the GCC box in the promoter region of the OsAO3 gene and repress the expression of OsAO3. CONCLUSIONS: OsERF106MZ may play a role in maintaining root growth for resource uptake when rice seeds germinate under salinity stress by alleviating ABA-mediated root growth inhibition.
