NA	CHROMATIN REMODELING 11-dependent nucleosome occupancy affects disease resistance in rice.	2023	Plant Physiol	The State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics &amp; Germplasm Enhancement and Utilization, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Plant immune responses involve transcriptional reprogramming of defense response genes, and chromatin remodeling is important for transcriptional regulation. However, nucleosome dynamics induced by pathogen infection and its association with gene transcription is largely unexplored in plants. Here, we investigated the role of the rice (Oryza sativa) gene CHROMATIN REMODELING 11 (OsCHR11) in nucleosome dynamics and disease resistance. Nucleosome profiling revealed that OsCHR11 is required for the maintaining of genome-wide nucleosome occupancy in rice. Nucleosome occupancy of 14% of the genome was regulated by OsCHR11. Infection of bacterial leaf blight Xoo (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae) repressed genome-wide nucleosome occupancy, and this process depended on OsCHR11 function. Furthermore, OsCHR11/Xoo-dependent chromatin accessibility correlated with gene transcript induction by Xoo. In addition, accompanied by increased resistance to Xoo, several defense response genes were differentially expressed in oschr11 after Xoo infection. Overall, this study reports the genome-wide effects upon pathogen infection on nucleosome occupancy, its regulation, and its contribution to disease resistance in rice.
