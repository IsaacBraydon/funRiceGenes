OsCAND1	crown root	OsCAND1 is required for crown root emergence in rice	 To understand the molecular mechanisms of crown root formation, we isolated a rice mutant defective in crown root emergence designated as Oscand1 (named after the Arabidopsis homologous gene AtCAND1)| The defect of visible crown root in the Oscand1 mutant is the result of cessation of the G2/M cell cycle transition in the crown root meristem| During crown root primordium development, the expression of OsCAND1 is confined to the root cap after the establishment of fundamental organization| Exogenous auxin application can partially rescue the defect of crown root development in Oscand1| Taken together, these data show that OsCAND1 is involved in auxin signaling to maintain the G2/M cell cycle transition in crown root meristem and, consequently, the emergence of crown root|OsCAND1 is required for crown root emergence in rice
