OsCML3	plasma membrane	C-terminal extension of calmodulin-like 3 protein from Oryza sativa L.: interaction with a high mobility group target protein.	Moreover, OsCML3 was mainly localized in the plasma membrane, whereas OsCML3m was found in the nucleus
OsCML3	nucleus	C-terminal extension of calmodulin-like 3 protein from Oryza sativa L.: interaction with a high mobility group target protein.	Moreover, OsCML3 was mainly localized in the plasma membrane, whereas OsCML3m was found in the nucleus
OsCML3	nucleus	C-terminal extension of calmodulin-like 3 protein from Oryza sativa L.: interaction with a high mobility group target protein.	Taken together, OsCML3 probably provides a mechanism for manipulating the DNA-binding ability of OsHMGB1 in the nucleus and its C-terminal extension provides an intracellular Ca(2+) regulatory switch
