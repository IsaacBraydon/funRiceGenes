NA	The calcium-dependent kinase OsCPK24 functions in cold stress responses in rice.	2017	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are serine/threonine protein kinases that function in plant stress responses. Although CPKs are recognized as key messengers in signal transduction, the specific roles of CPKs and the molecular mechanisms underlying their activity remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized the function of OsCPK24, a cytosol-localized calcium-dependent protein kinase in rice. OsCPK24 was universally and highly expressed in rice plants and was induced by cold treatment. While OsCPK24 knockdown plants exhibited increased sensitivity to cold compared to wild type, OsCPK24-overexpressing plants exhibited increased cold tolerance. Plants overexpressing OsCPK24 exhibited increased accumulation of proline (an osmoprotectant) and glutathione (an antioxidant) and maintained a higher GSH/GSSG (reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione) ratio during cold stress compared to wild type. In addition to these effects in responses to cold stress, we found that the kinase activity of OsCPK24 varied under different calcium concentrations. Further, OsCPK24 phosphorylated OsGrx10, a glutathione-dependent thioltransferase, at rates modulated by changes in calcium concentration. Together, our results suggest that OsCPK24 functions as a positive regulator of cold stress tolerance in rice, a process mediated by calcium signaling and involving phosphorylation and the inhibition of OsGrx10 to sustain higher glutathione levels.

A rice CDPK gene, OsCDPK14 (AY144497), was cloned from developing caryopses of rice (Oryza sativa cv. Zhonghua 15). Its cDNA sequence (1922 bp) contains an ORF encoding a 514 amino acids protein (56.7kD, pl 5.18). OsCDPK14 shows the typical structural features of the CDPK family, including a conserved catalytic Ser/Thr kinase domain, an autoinhibitory domain and a CaM-like domain with four putative Ca2+-binding EF hands. Subcellular targeting indicated that OsCDPK14 was located in the cytoplasm, probably due to the absence of myristoylation and palmitoylation motifs. OsCDPK14 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified from bacterial extracts. The recombinant protein was shown to be a functional protein kinase using Syntide-2, a synthetic peptide. Kinase activity was shown to be Ca2+-dependent, and this activation was strongly enhanced by Mn2+ and inhibited by W7 in vitro. These results provide significant insights into the regulation and biochemical properties of OsCDPK14, suggesting OsCDPK14 may be a signal factor of cytoplasm in rice plant.
NA	Dynamic genome-wide association analysis and identification of candidate genes involved in anaerobic germination tolerance in rice	2021	Rice (N Y)	National Engineering Research Center of Plant Space Breeding, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Background: In Asian rice production, an increasing number of countries now choose the direct seeding mode because of rising costs, labour shortages and water shortages. The ability of rice seeds to undergo anaerobic germination (AG) plays an important role in the success of direct seeding.  Results: In this study, we used 2,123,725 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers based on resequencing to conduct a dynamic genome-wide association study (GWAS) of coleoptile length (CL) and coleoptile diameter (CD) in 209 natural rice populations. A total of 26 SNP loci were detected in these two phenotypes, of which 5 overlapped with previously reported loci (S1_ 39674301, S6_ 20797781, S7_ 18722403, S8_ 9946213, S11_ 19165397), and two sites were detected repeatedly at different time points (S3_ 24689629 and S5_ 27918754). We suggest that these 7 loci (-log10 (P) value > 7.3271) are the key sites that affect AG tolerance. To screen the candidate genes more effectively, we sequenced the transcriptome of the flooding-tolerant variety R151 in six key stages, including anaerobic (AN) and the oxygen conversion point (AN-A), and obtained high-quality differential expression profiles. Four reliable candidate genes were identified: Os01g0911700 (OsVP1), Os05g0560900 (OsGA2ox8), Os05g0562200 (OsDi19-1) and Os06g0548200. Then qRT-PCR and LC-MS/ MS targeting metabolite detection technology were used to further verify that the up-regulated expression of these four candidate genes was closely related to AG.  Conclusion: The four novel candidate genes were associated with gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) regulation and cell wall metabolism under oxygen-deficiency conditions and promoted coleoptile elongation while avoiding adverse effects, allowing the coleoptile to obtain oxygen, escape the low-oxygen environment and germinate rapidly. The results of this study improve our understanding of the genetic basis of AG in rice seeds, which is conducive to the selection of flooding-tolerant varieties suitable for direct seeding.
