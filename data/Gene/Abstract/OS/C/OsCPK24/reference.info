NA	The calcium-dependent kinase OsCPK24 functions in cold stress responses in rice.	2017	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are serine/threonine protein kinases that function in plant stress responses. Although CPKs are recognized as key messengers in signal transduction, the specific roles of CPKs and the molecular mechanisms underlying their activity remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized the function of OsCPK24, a cytosol-localized calcium-dependent protein kinase in rice. OsCPK24 was universally and highly expressed in rice plants and was induced by cold treatment. While OsCPK24 knockdown plants exhibited increased sensitivity to cold compared to wild type, OsCPK24-overexpressing plants exhibited increased cold tolerance. Plants overexpressing OsCPK24 exhibited increased accumulation of proline (an osmoprotectant) and glutathione (an antioxidant) and maintained a higher GSH/GSSG (reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione) ratio during cold stress compared to wild type. In addition to these effects in responses to cold stress, we found that the kinase activity of OsCPK24 varied under different calcium concentrations. Further, OsCPK24 phosphorylated OsGrx10, a glutathione-dependent thioltransferase, at rates modulated by changes in calcium concentration. Together, our results suggest that OsCPK24 functions as a positive regulator of cold stress tolerance in rice, a process mediated by calcium signaling and involving phosphorylation and the inhibition of OsGrx10 to sustain higher glutathione levels.

A rice CDPK gene, OsCDPK14 (AY144497), was cloned from developing caryopses of rice (Oryza sativa cv. Zhonghua 15). Its cDNA sequence (1922 bp) contains an ORF encoding a 514 amino acids protein (56.7kD, pl 5.18). OsCDPK14 shows the typical structural features of the CDPK family, including a conserved catalytic Ser/Thr kinase domain, an autoinhibitory domain and a CaM-like domain with four putative Ca2+-binding EF hands. Subcellular targeting indicated that OsCDPK14 was located in the cytoplasm, probably due to the absence of myristoylation and palmitoylation motifs. OsCDPK14 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified from bacterial extracts. The recombinant protein was shown to be a functional protein kinase using Syntide-2, a synthetic peptide. Kinase activity was shown to be Ca2+-dependent, and this activation was strongly enhanced by Mn2+ and inhibited by W7 in vitro. These results provide significant insights into the regulation and biochemical properties of OsCDPK14, suggesting OsCDPK14 may be a signal factor of cytoplasm in rice plant.
