Here, a group of Oryza sativa L. genes encoding calmodulin (CaM) and CaM-like (CML) proteins that do not possess functional domains other than the Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs was analyzed. RESULTS: By functional analyses and BLAST searches of the TIGR rice database, a maximum number of 243 proteins that possibly have EF-hand motifs were identified in the rice genome. Using a neighbor-joining tree based on amino acid sequence similarity, five loci were defined as Cam genes and thirty two additional CML genes were identified. Extensive analyses of the gene structures, the chromosome locations, the EF-hand motif organization, expression characteristics including analysis by RT-PCR and a comparative analysis of Cam and CML genes in rice and Arabidopsis are presented. CONCLUSION: Although many proteins have unknown functions, the complexity of this gene family indicates the importance of Ca2+-signals in regulating cellular responses to stimuli and this family of proteins likely plays a critical role as their transducers.

We investigated heat shock (HS)-triggered Ca(2+) signalling transduced by a Ca(2+) sensor, calmodulin (CaM), linked to early transcriptome changes of HS-responsive genes in rice. We observed a biphasic [Ca(2+) ](cyt) signature in root cells that was distinct from that in epicotyl and leaf cells, which showed a monophasic response after HS. Treatment with Ca(2+) and A23187 generated an intense and sustained increase in [Ca(2+) ](cyt) in response to HS. Conversely, treatment with Ca(2+) chelator, L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker and CaM antagonist, but not intracellular Ca(2+) release inhibitor, strongly inhibited the increased [Ca(2+) ](cyt) . HS combined with Ca(2+) and A23187 accelerated the expression of OsCaM1-1 and sHSPC/N genes, which suggests that the HS-induced apoplastic Ca(2+) influx is responsible for the [Ca(2+) ](cyt) response and downstream HS signalling. In addition, the biphasic response of OsCaM1-1 in the nucleus followed the Ca(2+) signature, which may provide the information necessary to direct HS-related gene expression. Overexpression of OsCaM1-1 induced the expression of Ca(2+) /HS-related AtCBK3, AtPP7, AtHSF and AtHSP at a non-inducing temperature and enhanced intrinsic thermotolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis. Therefore, HS-triggered rapid increases in [Ca(2+) ](cyt) , together with OsCaM1-1 expression and its nuclear localization, are important in mediating downstream HS-related gene expression for the acquisition of thermotolerance in rice.

Stomatal movement plays a key role in plant development and response to drought and salt stress by regulating gas exchange and water loss. A number of genes have been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of this process. Using inverse genetics approach, we characterized the function of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunit A (OsVHA-A) gene in stomatal conductance regulation and physiological response to salt and osmotic stress. OsVHA-A was constitutively expressed in different rice tissues, and the fusion protein of GFP-OsVHA-A was exclusively targeted to tonoplast when transiently expressed in the onion epidermal cells. Heterologous expression of OsVHA-A was able to rescue the yeast mutant vma1Delta (lacking subunit A activity) phenotype, suggesting that it partially restores the activity of V-ATPase. Meanwhile, RNAi-directed knockdown of OsVHA-A led to a reduction of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase activity and an enhancement of plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase activity, thereby increasing the concentrations of extracellular H(+) and intracellular K(+) and Na(+) under stress conditions. Knockdown of OsVHA-A also resulted in the upregulation of PAM3 (plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase 3) and downregulation of CAM1 (calmodulin 1), CAM3 (calmodulin 3) and YDA1 (YODA, a MAPKK gene). Altered level of the ion concentration and the gene expression by knockdown of OsVHA-A probably resulted in expanded aperture of stomatal pores and increased stomatal density. In addition, OsVHA-A RNAi plants displayed significant growth inhibition under salt and osmotic stress conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that OsVHA-A takes part in regulating stomatal density and opening via interfering with pH value and ionic equilibrium in guard cells and thereby affects the growth of rice plants.
