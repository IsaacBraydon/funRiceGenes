OsCyb5	seed	A genome-wide association study reveals that the cytochrome b5 involved in seed reserve mobilization during seed germination in rice.	 However, the α-amylase activity in the germinating seeds of Oscyb5 mutants was significantly decreased compared to that of WT, and then, the starch and sugar mobilization and the glucose accumulation during seed germination were significantly decreased in Oscyb5 mutants
OsCyb5	seed	A genome-wide association study reveals that the cytochrome b5 involved in seed reserve mobilization during seed germination in rice.	 Two elite haplotypes of OsCyb5 associated with the higher seed reserve mobilization percentage and its elite single nucleotide polymorphism variations were mainly existed in the INDICA and AUS accessions
