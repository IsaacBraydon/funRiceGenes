The root Fd cDNA clone (pFDRR) was 603 bp long which contained 261-bp 5â€‘ù<U+3E32> region encoding the C-terminal 72 amino acid residues and 342-bp 3â€‘ù<U+3E32> noncoding region. A genomic clone was isolated from a Î»EMBL3 rice genomic library using pFDRR as a probe and its nucleotide sequence was identical with that of the cDNA clone in their overlapping region. The root Fd gene contained 1091-bp 5â€‘ù<U+3E32> upstream, 444-bp coding and 294-bp 3â€‘ù<U+3E32> noncoding regions. The transcription start site locates 46 bp upstream of the ATG translation initiation codon. In the 5â€‘ù<U+3E32> flanking region, two GATA elements and a TCCGCGGA-like sequence are located in addition to TATA box-like and CAAT sequences. Homology between the rice root and leaf Fds showed 60%, while the former protein shared much higher identity with other nonphotosynthetic Fds (66â€<U+393C><U+3E33>88%). Southern blot analysis using pFDRR and the rice leaf Fd cDNA (pFDRL) as a DNA probe identified their corresponding genomic Fd DNA. Expression of the root Fd gene was induced in response to nitrate and ammonium.

Protein kinases are major signal transduction factors that have a central role in mediating acclimation to environmental changes in eukaryotic organisms. In this study, we characterized the function of the sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase2 (SnRK2) SAPK4 in the salt stress response of rice. RESULTS: Translational fusion of SAPK4 with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) showed subcellular localization in cytoplasm and nucleus. To examine the role of SAPK4 in salt tolerance we generated transgenic rice plants with over-expression of rice SAPK4 under control of the CaMV-35S promoter. Induced expression of SAPK4 resulted in improved germination, growth and development under salt stress both in seedlings and mature plants. In response to salt stress, the SAPK4-overexpressing rice accumulated less Na+ and Cl- and showed improved photosynthesis. SAPK4-regulated genes with functions in ion homeostasis and oxidative stress response were identified: the vacuolar H+-ATPase, the Na+/H+ antiporter NHX1, the Cl- channel OsCLC1 and a catalase. CONCLUSION: Our results show that SAPK4 regulates ion homeostasis and growth and development under salinity and suggest function of SAPK4 as a regulatory factor in plant salt stress acclimation. Identification of signaling elements involved in stress adaptation in plants presents a powerful approach to identify transcriptional activators of adaptive mechanisms to environmental changes that have the potential to improve tolerance in crop plants.
