OsCLC1	oxidative	The SNF1-type serine-threonine protein kinase SAPK4 regulates stress-responsive gene expression in rice	 SAPK4-regulated genes with functions in ion homeostasis and oxidative stress response were identified: the vacuolar H+-ATPase, the Na+/H+ antiporter NHX1, the Cl- channel OsCLC1 and a catalase
