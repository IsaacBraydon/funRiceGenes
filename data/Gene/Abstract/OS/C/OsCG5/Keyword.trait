OsCG5	grain	Rice Chalky Grain 5 regulates natural variation for grain quality under heat stress.	 Collectively, these results show that the natural variation at OsCG5 may contribute towards rice grain quality under heat stress
OsCG5	stress	Rice Chalky Grain 5 regulates natural variation for grain quality under heat stress.	 Accessions with lower transcript abundance of OsCG5 exhibit higher chalkiness, which correlates with higher RG values under stress
OsCG5	stress	Rice Chalky Grain 5 regulates natural variation for grain quality under heat stress.	 These findings are supported by increased chalkiness of OsCG5 knock-out (KO) mutants relative to wildtype (WT) under heat stress
OsCG5	stress	Rice Chalky Grain 5 regulates natural variation for grain quality under heat stress.	 Grains from plants overexpressing OsCG5 are less chalky than KOs but comparable to WT under heat stress
