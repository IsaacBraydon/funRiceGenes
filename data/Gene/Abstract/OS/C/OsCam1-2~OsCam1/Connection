OsCam1-2|OsCam1	OsCam2	Calcium signaling-mediated and differential induction of calmodulin gene expression by stress in Oryza sativa L	Complementary DNA for each of the calmodulin genes, OsCam1, OsCam2, and OsCam3 were sequenced
OsCam1-2|OsCam1	OsCam2	Calcium signaling-mediated and differential induction of calmodulin gene expression by stress in Oryza sativa L	OsCam1 and OsCam2 encode a conventional 148-amino acid calmodulin protein that contains four characteristic Ca(2+)-binding motifs
OsCam1-2|OsCam1	OsCam3	Calcium signaling-mediated and differential induction of calmodulin gene expression by stress in Oryza sativa L	Complementary DNA for each of the calmodulin genes, OsCam1, OsCam2, and OsCam3 were sequenced
OsCam1-1	OsCam1-2|OsCam1	Downstream components of the calmodulin signaling pathway in the rice salt stress response revealed by transcriptome profiling and target identification.	 GO terms enriched in their associated proteins that matched those of the differentially expressed genes affected by OsCam1-1 overexpression revealed various downstream cellular processes that could potentially be regulated by OsCaM1 through their actions
