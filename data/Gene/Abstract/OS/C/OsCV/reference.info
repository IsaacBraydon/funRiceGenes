NA	Delaying chloroplast turnover increases water-deficit stress tolerance through the enhancement of nitrogen assimilation in rice.	2017	J Exp Bot	Department of Plant Sciences, University of California, Davis, CA 95616,USA.	Abiotic stress-induced senescence in crops is a process particularly affecting the photosynthetic apparatus, decreasing photosynthetic activity and inducing chloroplast degradation. A pathway for stress-induced chloroplast degradation that involves the CHLOROPLAST VESICULATION (CV) gene was characterized in rice (Oryza sativa) plants. OsCV expression was up-regulated with the age of the plants and when plants were exposed to water-deficit conditions. The down-regulation of OsCV expression contributed to the maintenance of the chloroplast integrity under stress. OsCV-silenced plants displayed enhanced source fitness (i.e. carbon and nitrogen assimilation) and photorespiration, leading to water-deficit stress tolerance. Co-immunoprecipitation, intracellular co-localization, and bimolecular fluorescence demonstrated the in vivo interaction between OsCV and chloroplastic glutamine synthetase (OsGS2), affecting source-sink relationships of the plants under stress. Our results would indicate that the OsCV-mediated chloroplast degradation pathway is involved in the regulation of nitrogen assimilation during stress-induced plant senescence.
NA	Silencing of OsCV (chloroplast vesiculation) maintained photorespiration and N assimilation in rice plants grown under elevated CO2.	2020	Plant Cell Environ	Department of Plant Sciences, University of California, Davis, CA.	High CO2 concentrations stimulate net photosynthesis by increasing CO2 substrate availability for Rubisco, simultaneously suppressing photorespiration. Previously, we reported that silencing the chloroplast vesiculation (cv) gene in rice increased source fitness, through the maintenance of chloroplast stability and the expression of photorespiration-associated genes. Because high atmospheric CO2 conditions diminished photorespiration, we tested whether CV silencing might be a viable strategy to improve the effects of high CO2 on grain yield and N assimilation in rice. Under elevated CO2 , OsCV expression was induced, and OsCV was targeted to peroxisomes where it facilitated the removal of OsPEX11-1 from the peroxisome and delivered it to the vacuole for degradation. This process correlated well with the reduction in the number of peroxisomes, the decreased catalase activity and the increased H2 O2 content in wild-type plants under elevated CO2 . At elevated CO2 , CV-silenced rice plants maintained peroxisome proliferation and photorespiration and displayed higher N assimilation than wild-type plants. This was supported by higher activity of enzymes involved in NO3- and NH4+ assimilation and higher total and seed protein contents. Co-immunoprecipitation of OsCV-interacting proteins suggested that, similar to its role in chloroplast protein turnover, OsCV acted as a scaffold, binding peroxisomal proteins.
