OsCV	chloroplast	Delaying chloroplast turnover increases water-deficit stress tolerance through the enhancement of nitrogen assimilation in rice.	 The down-regulation of OsCV expression contributed to the maintenance of the chloroplast integrity under stress

OsCV	stress	Delaying chloroplast turnover increases water-deficit stress tolerance through the enhancement of nitrogen assimilation in rice.	 Co-immunoprecipitation, intracellular co-localization, and bimolecular fluorescence demonstrated the in vivo interaction between OsCV and chloroplastic glutamine synthetase (OsGS2), affecting source-sink relationships of the plants under stress
OsCV	chloroplast	Silencing of OsCV (chloroplast vesiculation) maintained photorespiration and N assimilation in rice plants grown under elevated CO2.	 Co-immunoprecipitation of OsCV-interacting proteins suggested that, similar to its role in chloroplast protein turnover, OsCV acted as a scaffold, binding peroxisomal proteins
