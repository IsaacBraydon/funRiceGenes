Lee-2013-Oryza sativa COI hom.pdf	Oryza sativa COI homologues restore jasmonate signal transduction in Arabidopsis coi1-1 mutants	2013	PLoS One	Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.	CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1) encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex component that interacts with JAZ proteins and targets them for degradation in response to JA signaling. The Arabidopsis genome has a single copy of COI1, but the Oryza sativa genome has three closely related COI homologs. To examine the functions of the three OsCOIs, we used yeast two-hybrid assays to examine their interactions with JAZ proteins and found that OsCOIs interacted with OsJAZs and with JAZs, in a coronatine dependent manner. We also tested whether OsCOI1a and OsCOI1b could complement Arabidopsis coi1-1 mutants and found that overexpression of either gene in the coi1-1 mutant resulted in restoration of JA signal transduction and production of seeds, indicating successful complementation. Although OsCOI2 interacted with a few OsJAZs, we were not able to successfully complement the coi1-1 mutant with OsCOI2. Molecular modeling revealed that the three OsCOIs adopt 3D structures similar to COI1. Structural differences resulting from amino acid variations, especially among amino acid residues involved in the interaction with coronatine and JAZ proteins, were tested by mutation analysis. When His-391 in OsCOI2 was substituted with Tyr-391, OsCOI2 interacted with a wider range of JAZ proteins, including OsJAZ1, 2, 5 approximately 9 and 11, and complemented coi1-1 mutants at a higher frequency than the other OsCOIs and COI1. These results indicate that the three OsCOIs are orthologues of COI1 and play key roles in JA signaling.
NA	Genome Editing Reveals both the Crucial Role of OsCOI2 in Jasmonate Signaling, and the Functional Diversity of COI1 Homologs in Rice Functional Diversity of COI1 Homologs in Rice.	2022	Plant Cell Physiol	Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Teikyo University, 1-1 Toyosatodai, Utsunomiya, Tochigi, 320-8551, Japan.	Jasmonic acid (JA) regulates plant growth, development, and stress responses. Coronatine insensitive 1 (COI1) and jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins form a receptor complex for jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (JA-Ile), a biologically active form of JA. Three COIs (OsCOI1a, OsCOI1b, and OsCOI2) are encoded in the rice genome. In the present study, we generated mutants for each rice COI gene using genome editing to reveal the physiological functions of the three rice COIs. The oscoi2 mutants, but not the oscoi1a and oscoi1b mutants, exhibited severely low fertility, indicating the crucial role of OsCOI2 in rice fertility. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the transcriptional changes after methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment were moderate in the leaves of oscoi2 mutants compared to those in the wild-type or oscoi1a and oscoi1b mutants. MeJA-induced chlorophyll degradation and accumulation of antimicrobial secondary metabolites were suppressed in oscoi2 mutants. These results indicate that OsCOI2 plays a central role in JA response in rice leaves. In contrast, assessment of growth inhibition upon exogenous application of JA to seedlings of each mutant revealed that rice COIs are redundantly involved in shoot growth, whereas OsCOI2 plays a primary role in root growth. In addition, a co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that OsJAZ2 and OsJAZ5 containing divergent Jas motifs physically interacted only with OsCOI2, whereas OsJAZ4 with a canonical Jas motif interacts with all three rice COIs. The present study demonstrated the functional diversity of rice COIs, thereby providing clues to the mechanisms regulating the various physiological functions of JA.
NA	Functional dissection of rice jasmonate receptors involved in development and defense.	2023	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Ministry of Agriculture Key Lab of Molecular Biology of Crop Pathogens and Insects, Key Laboratory of Biology of Crop Pathogens and Insects of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	The phytohormones, jasmonates (JAs), mediate many plant developmental processes and their responses to important environmental stresses, such as herbivore attack. Bioactive JAs are perceived by CORONATINE INSENSITIVE (COI)-receptors, and associated JAZ proteins, to activate downstream responses. To date, the JA receptors of the important monocot crop plant, rice, remain to be explored. Here, we studied all three rice COI proteins, OsCOI1a, OsCOI1b, and OsCOI2, by ligand binding, genome editing, and phenotyping and examining some of the responsible mechanisms for the different responses. OsCOI2 binds to most individual OsJAZs in the presence of endogenous JA ligands, as OsCOI1a /1b do, albeit with greater partner selectivity. Single mutants of each OsCOI and OsCOI1a/1b double mutants were constructed by CRIPSR-Cas9-based genome editing and used to phenotype developmental and defense responses. OsCOI1b is involved in root growth and grain-size control and plays overlapping roles with OsCOI1a in spikelet development, while OsCOI2 regulates leaf senescence, male sterility, root growth, and grain size. All OsCOIs mediated resistance to the devastating rice pest, the brown planthopper. However, the defense sectors regulated by OsCOI1a/1b and OsCOI2 clearly differed. Our results revealed that all three OsCOIs are functional JA receptors that play diverse roles in regulating downstream JA responses.
NA	Genetic analysis of the rice jasmonate receptors reveals specialized functions for OsCOI2.	2023	PLoS One	DIADE, IRD, Univ Montpellier, Montpellier, France.	COI1-mediated perception of jasmonate is critical for plant development and responses to environmental stresses. Monocots such as rice have two groups of COI genes due to gene duplication: OsCOI1a and OsCOI1b that are functionally equivalent to the dicotyledons COI1 and OsCOI2 whose function remains unclear. In order to assess the function of OsCOI2 and its functional redundancy with COI1 genes, we developed a series of rice mutants in the 3 genes OsCOI1a, OsCOI1b and OsCOI2 by CRISPR Cas9-mediated editing and characterized their phenotype and responses to jasmonate. Characterization of OsCOI2 uncovered its important roles in root, leaf and flower development. In particular, we show that crown root growth inhibition by jasmonate relies on OsCOI2 and not on OsCOI1a nor on OsCOI1b, revealing a major function for the non-canonical OsCOI2 in jasmonate-dependent control of rice root growth. Collectively, these results point to a specialized function of OsCOI2 in the regulation of plant development in rice and indicate that sub-functionalisation of jasmonate receptors has occurred in the monocot phylum.
