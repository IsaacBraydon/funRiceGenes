Calcium plays a crucial role as a second messenger in mediating various defense responses under environmental stresses. Calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins have been implicated as important Ca2+ sensors in plant-specific calcium signaling. Based on the similarity of sequence, ten CBL genes were identified by searching the rice japonica genome database, which were randomly distribute on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 and 12. By semi-quantitative RT-PCR approach the expression pattern of each gene was detected in various organs at the adult stage and seedlings treated with NaCl, PEG and cold stresses or exogenous ABA. The results showed that the induction of each rice CBL gene was not only responsive to different stress conditions, but also organ specific. In vivo targeting experiment revealed that OsCBL8 localized to the plasma membrane, which was consistent with OsCBL4 and SOS3 previously reported. To elucidate the putative function of OsCBL8 gene, transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsCBL8 gene were generated by the Agrobacterium-mediated approach. The OsCBL8 transgenic rice seedlings showed more tolerance to salt stress than non-transgenic seedlings.
1-s2.0-S1672630808600992-main.pdf	Preliminary Study on Function of Calcineurin B-Like Protein Gene OsCBL8 in Rice	2010	Rice Science	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China	The homozygous T3 transgenic lines with sense OsCBL8 gene and antisense OsCBL8 gene obtained by agro-transformation were used to investigate the function of OsCBL8 in rice. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that the expression of OsCBL8 extremely increased in sense transgenic lines, and decreased to some extents in antisense transgenic lines. Such up- and down-regulation of the OsCBL8 gene in these transgenic lines had little effects on main agronomic traits, but significantly decreased the number of filled grains per panicle and seed setting rate in some of transgenic lines. By evaluation of the tolerance to 150 mmol/L NaCl, 20% PEG6000 and low temperature treatments, and relevant physiological indices, 8F12, a sense transgenic line with high salt tolerance, and 8R14, an antisense transgenic line with high drought tolerance, were obtained, which suggests that the OsCBL8 gene is involved in the response of rice to abiotic stresses.
NA	Cold-induced calreticulin OsCRT3 conformational changes promote OsCIPK7 binding and temperature sensing in rice.	2022	EMBO J	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Unusually low temperatures caused by global climate change adversely affect rice production. Sensing cold to trigger signal network is a key base for improvement of chilling tolerance trait.Â  Here, we report that Oryza sativa Calreticulin 3 (OsCRT3) localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exhibits conformational changes under cold stress, thereby enhancing its interaction with CBL-interacting protein kinase 7 (OsCIPK7) to sense cold. Phenotypic analyses of OsCRT3 knock-out mutants and transgenic overexpression lines demonstrate that OsCRT3 is a positive regulator in chilling tolerance. OsCRT3 localizes at the ER and mediates increases in cytosolic calcium levels under cold stress. Notably, cold stress triggers secondary structural changes of OsCRT3 and enhances its binding affinity with OsCIPK7, which finally boosts its kinase activity. Moreover, Calcineurin B-like protein 7 (OsCBL7) and OsCBL8 interact with OsCIPK7 specifically on the plasma membrane. Taken together, our results thus identify a cold-sensing mechanism that simultaneously conveys cold-induced protein conformational change, enhances kinase activity, and Ca(2+) signal generation to facilitate chilling tolerance in rice.
