NA	Tolerance analysis of chloroplast OsCu/Zn-SOD overexpressing rice under NaCl and NaHCO3 stress.	2017	PLoS One	Key Laboratory of Saline-alkali Vegetation Ecology Restoration (SAVER), Ministry of Education, Alkali Soil Natural Environmental Science Center (ASNESC), Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China.	The 636-bp-long cDNA sequence of OsCu/Zn-SOD (AK059841) was cloned from Oryza sativa var. Longjing11 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The encoded protein comprised of 211 amino acids is highly homologous to Cu/Zn-SOD proteins from tuscacera rice and millet. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that in rice, the level of OsCu/Zn-SOD gene expression was lowest in roots and was highest in petals and during the S5 leaf stage. Moreover, the expression level of OsCu/Zn-SOD gene expression decreased during the L5 leaf stage to maturity. The level of OsCu/Zn-SOD gene expression, however, was increased under saline-sodic stress and NaHCO3 stress. Germination tests under 125, 150, and 175 mM NaCl revealed that OsCu/Zn-SOD-overexpressing lines performed better than the non-transgenic (NT) Longjing11 lines in terms of germination rate and height. Subjecting seedlings to NaHCO3 and water stress revealed that OsCu/Zn-SOD-overexpressing lines performed better than NT in terms of SOD activity, fresh weight, root length, and height. Under simulated NaHCO3 stress, OsCu/Zn-SOD-overexpressing lines performed better than NT in terms of survival rate (25.19% &gt; 6.67%) and yield traits (average grain weight 20.6 &gt; 18.15 g). This study showed that OsCu/Zn-SOD gene overexpression increases the detoxification capacity of reactive oxygen species in O. sativa and reduces salt-induced oxidative damage. We also revealed the regulatory mechanism of OsCu/Zn-SOD enzyme in saline-sodic stress resistance in O. sativa. Moreover, we provided an experimental foundation for studying the mechanism of OsCu/Zn-SOD enzymes in the chloroplast.
NA	The copper economy response is partially conserved in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2021	Plant Physiol Biochem	Programa de PÃ³s-Gradua<U+00E7><U+00E3>o em Agrobiologia, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Santa Maria, Brazil.	Copper (Cu) is an essential element for plants, especially in photosynthesis, as it is required for plastocyanin function in electron transfer reactions at thylakoid membranes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, Cu deficiency leads to the Cu economy response, in which plants prioritize Cu usage by plastocyanin in detriment of non-essential cupric proteins. In rice (Oryza sativa), however, this response has not been characterized. Rice OsHMA5 is a Cu xylem-loading transporter involved in Cu translocation from roots to shoots, as suggested by the analysis of oshma5 mutant plants. Aiming to understand how rice plants respond to Cu deficiency and how decreased Cu translocation to shoots can affect this response, we characterized the physiological and molecular responses of WT and oshma5 plants under control and Cu deficiency treatments. We found evidence that shoots of oshma5 plants are more prone to Cu deficiency compared to shoots of WT plants, as demonstrated by decreased chlorophyll and Cu concentrations, and electron transport rate. Gene expression analysis revealed that Cu high-affinity transporters OsCOPT1 and OsCOPT5, along with a set of miRNAs and three Cu/Zn superoxide dismutases are responsive to Cu deficiency in both WT and oshma5 plants, suggesting their involvement in the Cu economy response. However, Fe superoxide dismutase was not up-regulated in rice, indicating a difference compared to the A. thaliana Cu economy model. Therefore, we provide evidence for a partially conserved Cu economy response in rice, in comparison to A. thaliana.
