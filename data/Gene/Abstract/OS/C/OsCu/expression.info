OsCu|Zn-SOD|OsCSD2	 Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that in rice, the level of OsCu/Zn-SOD gene expression was lowest in roots and was highest in petals and during the S5 leaf stage |  Moreover, the expression level of OsCu/Zn-SOD gene expression decreased during the L5 leaf stage to maturity |  The level of OsCu/Zn-SOD gene expression, however, was increased under saline-sodic stress and NaHCO3 stress |  This study showed that OsCu/Zn-SOD gene overexpression increases the detoxification capacity of reactive oxygen species in O	 This study showed that OsCu/Zn-SOD gene overexpression increases the detoxification capacity of reactive oxygen species in O
