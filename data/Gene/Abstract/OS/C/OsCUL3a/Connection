OsCUL3a	OsNPR1|NH1	OsCUL3a Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Immunity by Degrading OsNPR1 in Rice.	OsCUL3a Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Immunity by Degrading OsNPR1 in Rice.
OsCUL3a	OsNPR1|NH1	OsCUL3a Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Immunity by Degrading OsNPR1 in Rice.	Strikingly, OsCUL3a interacts with and degrades OsNPR1, which acts as a positive regulator of cell death in rice
OsCUL3a	OsNPR1|NH1	OsCUL3a Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Immunity by Degrading OsNPR1 in Rice.	Accumulation of OsNPR1 protein is greater in the oscul3a mutant than in the wild type
OsCUL3a	OsNPR1|NH1	OsCUL3a Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Immunity by Degrading OsNPR1 in Rice.	Furthermore, the oscul3a osnpr1 double mutant does not exhibit the lesion mimic phenotype of the oscul3a mutant
OsCUL3a	OsNPR1|NH1	OsCUL3a Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Immunity by Degrading OsNPR1 in Rice.	Our data demonstrate that OsCUL3a negatively regulates cell death and immunity by degrading OsNPR1 in rice
