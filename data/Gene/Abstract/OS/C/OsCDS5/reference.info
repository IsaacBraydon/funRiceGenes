NA	Cytidinediphosphate-Diacylglycerol Synthase 5 is Required for Phospholipid Homeostasis and is Negatively Involved in Hyperosmotic Stress Tolerance.	2018	Plant J	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Cytidinediphosphate diacylglycerol synthase (CDS) uses phosphatidic acid (PA) and cytidinetriphosphate to produce cytidinediphosphate-diacylglycerol, an intermediate for phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) synthesis. This study shows that rice CDS5, one of the rice genome's five CDSs, has multifaceted effects on plant growth and stress responses. Loss of CDS5 resulted in a decrease in PG and PI levels, defective thylakoid membranes, pale leaves in seedlings, and growth retardation. In addition, the loss of CDS5 led to an elevated PA level and enhanced hyperosmotic tolerance. Inhibition of phospholipase D (PLD)-derived PA formation in cds5 restored the mutant phenotype in hyperosmotic stress tolerance to that of wild-type, suggesting that CDS5 functions as a suppressor in PLD-derived PA signaling and negatively affects hyperosmotic stress tolerance.
