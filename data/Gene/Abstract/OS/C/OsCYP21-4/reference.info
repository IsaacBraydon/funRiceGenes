NA	OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Sustainable Bioresource Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology Daejeon, South Korea.	OsCYP21-4 is a rice cyclophilin protein that binds to cyclosporine A, an immunosuppressant drug. CYP21-4s in Arabidopsis and rice were previously shown to function as mitochondrial cyclophilins, as determined by TargetP analysis. In the current study, we found that OsCYP21-4-GFP localized to the Golgi, rather than mitochondria, in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, which was confirmed based on its co-localization with cis Golgi Î±-ManI-mCherry protein. OsCYP21-4 transcript levels increased in response to treatments with various abiotic stresses and the phytohormone abscisic acid, revealing its stress-responsiveness. CYP21-4 homologs do not possess key peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) activity/cyclosporine A (CsA) binding residues, and recombinant OsCYP21-4 protein did not convert the synthetic substrate Suc-AAPF-pNA via cis- trans- isomerization in vitro. In addition, transgenic plants overexpressing OsCYP21-4 exhibited increased tolerance to salinity and hydrogen peroxide treatment, along with increased peroxidase activity. These results demonstrate that OsCYP21-4 is a novel Golgi-localized cyclophilin that plays a role in oxidative stress tolerance, possibly by regulating peroxidase activity.
NA	Overexpression of Golgi Protein CYP21-4s Improves Crop Productivity in Potato and Rice by Increasing the Abundance of Mannosidic Glycoproteins.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Plant Systems Engineering Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience &amp; BiotechnologyDaejeon, South Korea.	CYP21-4 is a novel Golgi-localized cyclophilin protein involved in oxidative stress tolerance. Here, we generated transgenic plants overexpressing AtCYP21-4 and OsCYP21-4 in potato and rice, respectively. The stems and roots of AtCYP21-4-overexpressing potato plants were longer than those of wild-type (WT) plants, which resulted in heavier tubers. In vitro tuberization in the transgenic potato also resulted in significantly greater tuber number and weight, as well as a shorter time to microtuber formation. Similarly, OsCYP21-4-overexpressing transgenic rice plants had higher biomass and productivity with longer early-stage internodes than the WT and higher seed weight. Immunoblot analysis with CYP21-4 antibody showed that these productivity-enhancing phenotypes were associated with high CYP21-4s protein expression. Anatomically, transgenic potato stems exhibited higher lignin content in xylem cells and thicker leaves. In addition, relative content of mannosidic glycoproteins per unit of total protein was above 20% in transgenic potato tubers and rice grains. Based on these findings, we propose that CYP21-4s are involved in the growth and development of plant vegetative and storage tissues via their effects on glycoprotein abundance or glycan processing in the Golgi apparatus. Thus, increasing CYP21-4s expression in crops could represent an alternative way to increase crop productivity and yield.
