OsCERK1	chitin elicitor signaling pathway	OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity	Here, we demonstrate that the rice LysM receptor-like kinase OsCERK1, a key component of the chitin elicitor signaling pathway, also plays an important role in PGN-triggered immunity in rice.
OsCERK1	immunity signalling	The receptor kinase CERK1 has dual functions in symbiosis and immunity signalling	The receptor kinase CERK1 has dual functions in symbiosis and immunity signalling
OsCERK1	symbiosis	The receptor kinase CERK1 has dual functions in symbiosis and immunity signalling	The receptor kinase CERK1 has dual functions in symbiosis and immunity signalling
OsCERK1	receptor kinase	The receptor kinase CERK1 has dual functions in symbiosis and immunity signalling	The receptor kinase CERK1 has dual functions in symbiosis and immunity signalling
OsCERK1	immunity	The receptor kinase CERK1 has dual functions in symbiosis and immunity signalling	The receptor kinase CERK1 has dual functions in symbiosis and immunity signalling
OsCERK1	blast	The receptor kinase CERK1 has dual functions in symbiosis and immunity signalling	CERK1 in rice has the highest homology to NFR1 and we show that this gene is also necessary for the establishment of the mycorrhizal interaction as well as for resistance to the rice blast fungus.
