Symbol	Expression
OsCERK1	 Using OsCERK1-knockout mutants (oscerk1), we evaluated hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) production and gene expression after LPS treatment
OsCERK1	 Heterologous expression of OsCERK1DY in ZH11 significantly enhanced AMF colonization and increased resistance against the pathogenic fungi Magnaporthe oryzae
OsCERK1	 qRT-PCR-based gene expression analysis indicated over expression of defense-associated genes such as OsCEBiP, OsCERK1, and phytohormone-associated genes such as OsPAD4, OsEDS1, OsPR1
