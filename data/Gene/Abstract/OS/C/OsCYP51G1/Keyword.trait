OsCYP51G1	leaf	Obtusifoliol 14¦Á-demethylase OsCYP51G1 is involved in phytosterol synthesis and affects pollen and seed development	 However, knockdown of OsCYP51G1 by RNAi did not elicit these BR deficiency-related phenotypes, such as dwarfism, erect leaves and small seeds, nor was the leaf lamina angle sensitive to brassinolide treatment
OsCYP51G1	development	Obtusifoliol 14¦Á-demethylase OsCYP51G1 is involved in phytosterol synthesis and affects pollen and seed development	Obtusifoliol 14¦Á-demethylase OsCYP51G1 is involved in phytosterol synthesis and affects pollen and seed development
OsCYP51G1	pollen	Obtusifoliol 14¦Á-demethylase OsCYP51G1 is involved in phytosterol synthesis and affects pollen and seed development	Obtusifoliol 14¦Á-demethylase OsCYP51G1 is involved in phytosterol synthesis and affects pollen and seed development
OsCYP51G1	grain	Obtusifoliol 14¦Á-demethylase OsCYP51G1 is involved in phytosterol synthesis and affects pollen and seed development	 Knockdown and knockout of OsCYP51G1 resulted in delayed flowering, impaired membrane integrity, abnormal pollen, and reduced grain yield, whereas OsCYP51G1 overexpression led to increased grain yield
OsCYP51G1	seed	Obtusifoliol 14¦Á-demethylase OsCYP51G1 is involved in phytosterol synthesis and affects pollen and seed development	Obtusifoliol 14¦Á-demethylase OsCYP51G1 is involved in phytosterol synthesis and affects pollen and seed development

OsCYP51G1	yield	Obtusifoliol 14¦Á-demethylase OsCYP51G1 is involved in phytosterol synthesis and affects pollen and seed development	 Knockdown and knockout of OsCYP51G1 resulted in delayed flowering, impaired membrane integrity, abnormal pollen, and reduced grain yield, whereas OsCYP51G1 overexpression led to increased grain yield
OsCYP51G1	 BR 	Obtusifoliol 14¦Á-demethylase OsCYP51G1 is involved in phytosterol synthesis and affects pollen and seed development	 However, knockdown of OsCYP51G1 by RNAi did not elicit these BR deficiency-related phenotypes, such as dwarfism, erect leaves and small seeds, nor was the leaf lamina angle sensitive to brassinolide treatment
OsCYP51G1	lamina	Obtusifoliol 14¦Á-demethylase OsCYP51G1 is involved in phytosterol synthesis and affects pollen and seed development	 However, knockdown of OsCYP51G1 by RNAi did not elicit these BR deficiency-related phenotypes, such as dwarfism, erect leaves and small seeds, nor was the leaf lamina angle sensitive to brassinolide treatment
OsCYP51G1	erect	Obtusifoliol 14¦Á-demethylase OsCYP51G1 is involved in phytosterol synthesis and affects pollen and seed development	 However, knockdown of OsCYP51G1 by RNAi did not elicit these BR deficiency-related phenotypes, such as dwarfism, erect leaves and small seeds, nor was the leaf lamina angle sensitive to brassinolide treatment
