OsCYP51G1	 Knockdown and knockout of OsCYP51G1 resulted in delayed flowering, impaired membrane integrity, abnormal pollen, and reduced grain yield, whereas OsCYP51G1 overexpression led to increased grain yield |  In contrast, overexpression of OsCYP51G1 increased the sitosterol and stigmasterol content and reduced that of cycloeucalenol	 Knockdown and knockout of OsCYP51G1 resulted in delayed flowering, impaired membrane integrity, abnormal pollen, and reduced grain yield, whereas OsCYP51G1 overexpression led to increased grain yield |  In contrast, overexpression of OsCYP51G1 increased the sitosterol and stigmasterol content and reduced that of cycloeucalenol	 However, knockdown of OsCYP51G1 by RNAi did not elicit these BR deficiency-related phenotypes, such as dwarfism, erect leaves and small seeds, nor was the leaf lamina angle sensitive to brassinolide treatment
