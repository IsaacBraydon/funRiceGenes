OsCIPK14	OsCIPK15	Regulation of Microbe-Associated Molecular Pattern-Induced Hypersensitive Cell Death, Phytoalexin Production, and Defense Gene Expression by Calcineurin B-Like Protein-Interacting Protein Kinases, OsCIPK14/15, in Rice Cultured Cells	 We here identified two CIPKs, OsCIPK14 and OsCIPK15, rapidly induced by microbe-associated molecular patterns, including chitooligosaccharides and xylanase (Trichoderma viride/ethylene-inducing xylanase [TvX/EIX]), in rice (Oryza sativa)
