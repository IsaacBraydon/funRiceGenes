OsCYP1	detoxification	Identification of a Phase I mechanism gene of rice (OsCYP1) in response to isoproturon.	 These results further verified that OsCYP1 could enhance the degradation and detoxification of isoproturon
OsCYP1	detoxification	Identification of a Phase I mechanism gene of rice (OsCYP1) in response to isoproturon.	 This study provides a fundamental basis for the detoxification and regulatory mechanisms of OsCYP1 in crops via enhancing the degradation and/or metabolism of herbicide residues
OsCYP1	herbicide	Identification of a Phase I mechanism gene of rice (OsCYP1) in response to isoproturon.	 This study provides a fundamental basis for the detoxification and regulatory mechanisms of OsCYP1 in crops via enhancing the degradation and/or metabolism of herbicide residues
