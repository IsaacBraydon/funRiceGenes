OsCYP1	 This research focused on a phase I metabolism gene (OsCYP1) with significant differential expression in rice under isoproturon pressure |  To analyze the expression of OsCYP1 in rice, the wild-type rice was treated with 0-1 mg/L isoproturon for 2 and 6 days, and qRT-PCR assays were conducted to detect the transcription levels |  Compared with the control group, the expression of OsCYP1 in shoots was progressively upregulated after exposure to isoproturon, with 6 |  Moreover, treatment with isoproturon upregulated the expression of OsCYP1 in roots, but the upregulation of transcripts was not significant except for 0
