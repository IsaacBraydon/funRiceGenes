OsCOL16	OsCOL16, encoding a CONSTANS-like protein, represses flowering by up-regulating Ghd7 expression in rice. |  Overexpression of OsCOL16 resulted in late heading under both long-day and short-day conditions |  OsCOL16 expression exhibits a diurnal oscillation and serves as a transcription factor with transcriptional activation activity |  We determined that OsCOL16 up-regulates the expression of the floral repressor Ghd7, leading to down-regulation of the expression of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1	 Overexpression of OsCOL16 resulted in late heading under both long-day and short-day conditions
