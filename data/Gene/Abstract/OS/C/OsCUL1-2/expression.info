OsCUL1-2	 Basal expression levels of OsCUL1-3 were much lower than those of OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-2 in all selected samples, showing that OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-2 play predominant roles relative to OsCUL1-3 in rice |  However, its expression pattern in response to hormones and abiotic stresses was somehow different from those of the OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-2 genes
