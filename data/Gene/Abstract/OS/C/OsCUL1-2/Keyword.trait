OsCUL1-2	abiotic stress	Characterization and comparative expression analysis of CUL1 genes in rice.	 However, its expression pattern in response to hormones and abiotic stresses was somehow different from those of the OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-2 genes
OsCUL1-2	 ABA 	Characterization and comparative expression analysis of CUL1 genes in rice.	 OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-2 genes were commonly upregulated in dry seeds and by ABA and salt/drought stresses, implying their involvement in ABA-mediated processes
