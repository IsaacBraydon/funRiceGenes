OsCHX14	 Expression profiling confirmed that among 17 CHX genes in rice, OsCHX14 was the only member that showed an expression polymorphism, not only in osjar1 mutants but also in RNAi lines of OsCOI1, another key member of the JA signaling pathway |  This suggests that the expression of OsCHX14 is regulated by the JA-signaling pathway	 Expression profiling confirmed that among 17 CHX genes in rice, OsCHX14 was the only member that showed an expression polymorphism, not only in osjar1 mutants but also in RNAi lines of OsCOI1, another key member of the JA signaling pathway
