OsCHX14	homeostasis	OsCHX14 is involved in the K+ homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa) flowers	OsCHX14 is involved in the K+ homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa) flowers
OsCHX14	homeostasis	OsCHX14 is involved in the K+ homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa) flowers	Our data suggest that OsCHX14 may play an important role in K+ homeostasis during flowering in rice
OsCHX14	 ja 	OsCHX14 is involved in the K+ homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa) flowers	Expression profiling confirmed that among 17 CHX genes in rice, OsCHX14 was the only member that showed an expression polymorphism, not only in osjar1 mutants but also in RNAi lines of OsCOI1, another key member of the JA signaling pathway
