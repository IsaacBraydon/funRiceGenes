OsARF12	OsCDKF;2	The miR167-OsARF12 module regulates grain filling and grain size downstream of miR159.	 Upon in-depth analysis, we found that OsARF12 activates OsCDKF;2 expressions by directly binding to the TGTCGG motif in the promoter region
OsARF12	OsCDKF;2	The miR167-OsARF12 module regulates grain filling and grain size downstream of miR159.	 Flow cytometric analysis in young panicles of plants overexpressing OsARF12 and cell number examination of cdkf;2 mutants verify that OsARF12 positively regulates grain filling and grain size by targeting OsCDKF;2
OsARF12	OsCDKF;2	The miR167-OsARF12 module regulates grain filling and grain size downstream of miR159.	 Additionally, plants overexpressing OsARF12 or cdkf;2 mutants present enhanced or reduced sensitivity to exogenous auxin and brassinosteroid (BR) treatments, confirming that OsCDKF;2 targeting by OsARF12 mediates auxin and BR signaling
