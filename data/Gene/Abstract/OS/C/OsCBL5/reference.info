Grain size is a key factor in determining rice (Oryza sativa) yield, and exploring new pathways to regulate grain size has immense potential to improve yield. In this study, we report that OsCBL5 encodes a calcineurin B subunit protein that significantly promotes grain size and weight. oscbl5 plants produced obviously smaller and lighter seeds. We further revealed that OsCBL5 promotes grain size by affecting cell expansion in the spikelet hull. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that CBL5 interacts with CIPK1 and PP23. Furthermore, double and triple mutations were induced using CRISPR/Cas9 (cr) to analyze the genetic relationship. It was found that the cr-cbl5/cipk1 phenotype was similar to that of cr-cipk1 and that the cr-cbl5/pp23, cr-cipk1/pp23, and cr-cbl5/cipk1/pp23 phenotype was similar to that of cr-pp23, indicating that OsCBL5, CIPK1, and PP23 act as a molecular module influencing seed size. In addition, the results show that both CBL5 and CIPK1 are involved in the gibberellic acid (GA) pathway and significantly affect the accumulation of endogenous active GA(4) . PP23 participates in GA signal transduction. In brief, this study identified a new module that affects rice grain size, OsCBL5-CIPK1-PP23, which could potentially be targeted to improve rice yield.
