OsCBL5	spikelet	OsCBL5-CIPK1-PP23 module enhances rice grain size and weight through the gibberellin pathway.	 We further revealed that OsCBL5 promotes grain size by affecting cell expansion in the spikelet hull
OsCBL5	grain	OsCBL5-CIPK1-PP23 module enhances rice grain size and weight through the gibberellin pathway.	 In this study, we report that OsCBL5 encodes a calcineurin B subunit protein that significantly promotes grain size and weight
