Bc6|OsCesA9	OsCesA4|Bc7|bc11	Three Distinct Rice Cellulose Synthase Catalytic Subunit Genes Required for Cellulose Synthesis in the Secondary Wall	 We show here that the genes responsible for three distinct brittle mutations of rice, induced by the insertion of the endogenous retrotransposon Tos17, correspond to CesA (cellulose synthase catalytic subunit) genes, OsCesA4, OsCesA7 and OsCesA9
