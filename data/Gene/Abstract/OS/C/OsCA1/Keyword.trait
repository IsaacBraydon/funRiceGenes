OsCA1	salt	Expression of a carbonic anhydrase gene is induced by environmental stresses in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	"Expression of the gene (OsCA1) coding for carbonic anhydrase (CA) in leaves and roots of rice was induced by environmental stresses from salts (NaCl, NaHCO(3) and Na(2)CO(3)), and osmotic stress (10%, w/v, PEG 6000)
OsCA1	salt	Expression of a carbonic anhydrase gene is induced by environmental stresses in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Transgenic Arabidopsis over-expressing OsCA1 had a greater salt tolerance at the seedling stage than wild-type plants in 1/2 MS medium with 5 mM NaHCO(3), 50 mM NaCl, on 100 mM NaCl"
