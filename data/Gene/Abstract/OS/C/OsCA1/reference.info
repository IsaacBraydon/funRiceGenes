Expression of the gene (OsCA1) coding for carbonic anhydrase (CA) in leaves and roots of rice was induced by environmental stresses from salts (NaCl, NaHCO(3) and Na(2)CO(3)), and osmotic stress (10%, w/v, PEG 6000). CA activity of rice seedlings more than doubled under some of these stresses. Transgenic Arabidopsis over-expressing OsCA1 had a greater salt tolerance at the seedling stage than wild-type plants in 1/2 MS medium with 5 mM NaHCO(3), 50 mM NaCl, on 100 mM NaCl. Thus CA expression responds to environmental stresses and is related to stress tolerance in rice.
NA	Absence of Os¦ÂCA1 causes CO2 deficit and affects leaf photosynthesis and stomatal response to CO2 in rice.	2017	Plant J	National key laboratory of crop genetic improvement, Huazhong Agriculture University, Wuhan, China.	Plants always adjust the opening of stomatal pores to adapt to the environments, such as [CO2 ], humidity and temperature. Low [CO2 ] will trigger the opening of stomatal pores to absorb extra CO2 . However, little is known about how CO2 supply affects the carbon fixation and opening of stomatal pores in rice. Here, a chloroplast-located ¦Â-carbonic anhydrase (¦Â-CA) coding gene was found to be involved in carbon assimilation and CO2 -mediated stomatal pore response in rice. Os¦ÂCA1 was constitutively expressed in all tissues and its transcripts were induced by high [CO2 ] in leaves. Both T-DNA mutant and RNAi lines showed phenotypes of lower biomass and CA activities. The knock-out of Os¦ÂCA1 obviously decreased the photosynthesis capacity, as demonstrated by the increased CO2 compensation point and decreased light saturation point in the mutant; while the knock-out increased the opening ratio of stomatal pores and water loss rate. Moreover, the mutant showed a delayed response to low [CO2 ], and they could not be closed to the degree of wild plants even though the stomatal pores could rapidly respond to high [CO2 ]. Genome-wide gene expression analysis via RNA-seq demonstrated that the transcript abundance of the genes related to RuBisCO, photosystem compounds and opening of stomatal pores were globally up-regulated in the mutant. Taken together, the inadequate CO2 supply caused by the absence of Os¦ÂCA1 reduces photosynthesis efficiency, triggers the opening of stomatal pores and finally decreases their sensitivity to CO2 fluctuation.
