Symbol	Expression
OsCUL1-3	 Basal expression levels of OsCUL1-3 were much lower than those of OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-2 in all selected samples, showing that OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-2 play predominant roles relative to OsCUL1-3 in rice |  Expression of the OsCUL1-3 gene was also induced in dry seeds and by ABA-related salt and drought stresses, implying their participation in ABA responses
