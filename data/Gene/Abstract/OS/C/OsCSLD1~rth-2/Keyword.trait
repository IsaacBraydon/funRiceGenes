OsCSLD1|rth-2	root hair	OsCSLD1, a cellulose synthase-like D1 gene, is required for root hair morphogenesis in rice	Here we show that the Oryza sativa cellulose synthase-like D1 (OsCSLD1) gene is required for root hair development, as rice (Oryza sativa) mutants that lack OsCSLD1 function develop abnormal root hairs
OsCSLD1|rth-2	root hair	OsCSLD1, a cellulose synthase-like D1 gene, is required for root hair morphogenesis in rice	Because the csld1 mutants develop the same density and number of root hairs along their seminal root as the wild-type plants, we propose that OsCSLD1 function is required for hair elongation but not initiation
OsCSLD1|rth-2	root hair	OsCSLD1, a cellulose synthase-like D1 gene, is required for root hair morphogenesis in rice	Both gene trap expression pattern and in situ hybridization analyses indicate that OsCSLD1 is expressed in only root hair cells
OsCSLD1|rth-2	root hair	OsCSLD1, a cellulose synthase-like D1 gene, is required for root hair morphogenesis in rice	Given that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene KOJAK/AtCSLD3 is required for root hair elongation and is expressed in the root hair, it appears that OsCSLD1 may be the functional ortholog of KOJAK/AtCSLD3 and that these two genes represent the root hair-specific members of this family of proteins
