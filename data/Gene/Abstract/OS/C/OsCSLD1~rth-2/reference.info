61_225.pdf	Root hairless 2 (rth2) mutant represents a loss-of-function allele of the cellulose synthase-like gene OsCSLD1 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2011	Breeding Science	None	Root hair is considered to play important roles in water and nutrient uptake and anchoring the plant to the soil. To gain further knowledge of root hair morphogenesis in rice, we isolated root hairless 2 (rth2) mutant from the mutant panel of Nipponbare. Positional cloning and complementation test revealed that the causal gene of rth2 was Cellulose Synthase-Like D1 (OsCSLD1). rth2 has a premature stop codon in exon 1 as a result of two consecutive nucleotide substitutions and is predicted to produce truncated proteins lacking the D, D, D, QxxRW motif and 8 transmembrane domains. In rth2, bulges were normally initiated from asymmetric divisions of root epidermal cells, but bulges did not elongate. Therefore, rth2 shows completely roothairless phenotype. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that OsCSLD1 was expressed not only in root but also in shoot. In situ hybridization showed that OsCSLD1 was expressed not only in root hairs but also in epidermal and cortex cell walls except for stele. Agronomic character evaluation in pot experiments showed that rth2 did not differ significantly from Nipponbare in all characters examined except for root dry weight, which showed a significant increase in rth2. In paddy field experiment, rth2 was significantly inferior compared with Nipponbare in agronomic performance.
Plant Physiol.-2007-Kim-1220-30.pdf	OsCSLD1, a cellulose synthase-like D1 gene, is required for root hair morphogenesis in rice	2007	Plant Physiol	Division of Applied Life Science, Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Research Center, Environmental Biotechnology National Core Research Center, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 660-701, Korea.	Root hairs are long tubular outgrowths that form on the surface of specialized epidermal cells. They are required for nutrient and water uptake and interact with the soil microflora. Here we show that the Oryza sativa cellulose synthase-like D1 (OsCSLD1) gene is required for root hair development, as rice (Oryza sativa) mutants that lack OsCSLD1 function develop abnormal root hairs. In these mutants, while hair development is initiated normally, the hairs elongate less than the wild-type hairs and they have kinks and swellings along their length. Because the csld1 mutants develop the same density and number of root hairs along their seminal root as the wild-type plants, we propose that OsCSLD1 function is required for hair elongation but not initiation. Both gene trap expression pattern and in situ hybridization analyses indicate that OsCSLD1 is expressed in only root hair cells. Furthermore, OsCSLD1 is the only member of the four rice CSLD genes that shows root-specific expression. Given that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene KOJAK/AtCSLD3 is required for root hair elongation and is expressed in the root hair, it appears that OsCSLD1 may be the functional ortholog of KOJAK/AtCSLD3 and that these two genes represent the root hair-specific members of this family of proteins. Thus, at least part of the mechanism of root hair morphogenesis in Arabidopsis is conserved in rice.
