OsCCR14	OsFBK1	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.
OsCCR14	OsFBK1	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.	We have shown earlier the F-box protein, OsFBK1, mediating turn-over of a cinnamoyl CoA-reductase, OsCCR14, to regulate rice anther and root lignification
OsCCR14	OsFBK1	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.	 SCF OsFBK1 mediates turn-over of OsATL53 in cytoplasm and nucleus, while of OsCCR14 in the nucleus as validated by cell-free degradation assays
OsCCR14	OsFBK1	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.	 These data show OsATL53 affects activity of OsCCR14, and their JA induced degradation by SCF OsFBK1 regulates lignification of rice anthers and roots
