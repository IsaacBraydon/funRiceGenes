OscpSRP43|PGL3	OscpSRP54b	Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice	 Both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were able to interact with OscpSRP43, respectively
OscpSRP43|PGL3	OscpSRP54b	Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice	 The transcript level of OscpSRP43 was significantly reduced while the transcript level of OscpSRP54b was apparently increased in pgl14
OscpSRP43|PGL3	OscpSRP54b	Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice	 In contrast, the transcript levels of OscpSRP54a, OscpSRP43 and OscpSRP54b were all significantly decreased in OscpSRP54b knockout lines
OscpSRP43|PGL3	OscpSRP54b	Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice	  Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were essential for normal chloroplast development by interacting with OscpSRP43 in rice
