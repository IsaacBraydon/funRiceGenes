A dwarf mutant, dwarf 62 (d62), was isolated from rice cultivar 93-11 by mutagenesis with gamma-rays. Under normal growth conditions, the mutant had multiple abnormal phenotypes, such as dwarfism, wide and dark-green leaf blades, reduced tiller numbers, late and asynchronous heading, short roots, partial male sterility, etc. Genetic analysis indicated that the abnormal phenotypes were controlled by the recessive mutation of a single nuclear gene. Using molecular markers, the D62 gene was fine mapped in 131-kb region at the short arm of chromosome 6. Positional cloning of D62 gene revealed that it was the same locus as DLT/OsGRAS-32, which encodes a member of the GRAS family. In previous studies, the DLT/OsGRAS-32 is confirmed to play positive roles in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Sequence analysis showed that the d62 carried a 2-bp deletion in ORF region of D62 gene which led to a loss-of-function mutation. The function of D62 gene was confirmed by complementation experiment. RT-PCR analysis and promoter activity analysis showed that the D62 gene expressed in all tested tissues including roots, stems, leaves and panicles of rice plant. The d62 mutant exhibited decreased activity of alpha-amylase in endosperm and reduced content of endogenous GA(1). The expression levels of gibberellin (GA) biosynthetic genes including OsCPS1, OsKS1, OsKO1, OsKAO, OsGA20ox2/SD1 and OsGA2ox3 were significantly increased in d62 mutant. Briefly, these results demonstrated that the D62 (DLT/OsGRAS-32) not only participated in the regulation of BR signaling, but also influenced GA metabolism in rice.

To understand their physiological roles, we examined the site of their biosynthesis by analyzing the expression pattern of a gene (OsCPS) encoding coparyl diphosphate synthase in developing rice flowers. Expression was apparent in the anthers 1â€<U+393C><U+3E33>2 days before flowering, and CPS mRNA accumulated in the maturing pollen.

In vitro assays using recombinant enzymes enabled three cDNAs encoding ent-copalyl diphosphate synthases to be identified in wheat (Triticum aestivum): TaCPS1, TaCPS2, and TaCPS3. The phylogenetic tree and expression analyses suggest that TaCPS3 is responsible for gibberellin biosynthesis, while TaCPS1 and TaCPS2 are possible functional homologs of diterpene cyclase genes OsCPS2 and OsCPS4 involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis in rice.
j.1365-3040.2005.01441.x.pdf	gid1, a gibberellin-insensitive dwarf mutant, shows altered regulation of probenazole-inducible protein (PBZ1) in response to cold stress and pathogen attack	2006	Plant, Cell and Environment	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba 305-8602, Japan.	A recessive gibberellin (GA)-insensitive dwarf mutant of rice, gibberellin-insensitive dwarf1 (gid1), has been identified, which shows a severe dwarf phenotype and contains high concentrations of endogenous GA. To elucidate the function of gid1, proteins regulated downstream of gid1 were analysed using a proteomic approach. Proteins extracted from suspension-cultured cells of gid1 and its wild type were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). Of a total of 962 proteins identified from the suspension-cultured cells, 16 were increased and 14 were decreased in gid1 compared with its wild type. Among the proteins hyper-accumulated in gid1 were osmotin, triosephosphate isomerase, probenazole inducible protein (PBZ1) and pathogenesis-related protein 10. Of these four genes, only the expression of PBZ1 was increased by exogenous GA3 application. Expression of this gene was also enhanced in shoots of the wild type by cold stress or by rice blast fungus infection. Under normal growth conditions, there was more PBZ1 protein in gid1 than in the wild type. In addition, gid1 showed increased tolerance to cold stress and resistance to blast fungus infection. The entcopalyl diphosphate synthase (OsCPS) genes, which encode enzymes at the branch point between GA and phytoalexin biosynthesis, were expressed differentially in gid1 relative to the wild type. Specifically, OsCPS1, which encodes an enzyme in the GA biosynthesis pathway, was down-regulated and OsCPS2 and OsCPS4, which encode enzymes in phytoalexin biosynthesis, were up-regulated in gid1. These results suggest that the expression of PBZ1 is regulated by GA signalling and stress stimuli, and that gid1 is involved in tolerance to cold stress and resistance to blast fungus.
j.1365-313X.2004.02175.x.pdf	Biological functions of ent- and syn-copalyl diphosphate synthases in rice: key enzymes for the branch point of gibberellin and phytoalexin biosynthesis	2004	Plant J	Course of the Science of Bioresources, The United Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Iwate University (Yamagata University), Tsuruoka, Yamagata 997-8555, Japan.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) produces ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CDP) and syn-CDP as precursors for several classes of phytoalexins and the phytohormones, gibberellins (GAs). It has recently been shown that a loss-of-function mutation of OsCPS1, a gene encoding a putative ent-CDP synthase, results in a severely GA-deficient dwarf phenotype in rice. To clarify the biological functions of the ent- and syn-CDP synthases involved in the biosynthesis of phytoalexins and/or GAs, we isolated two cDNAs, OsCyc1 and OsCyc2, encoding putative diterpene cyclases from ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated rice leaves (cv. Nipponbare). The production of phytoalexins in rice leaves is known to be highly induced by UV treatment. Using a bacterial expression system, we demonstrated that OsCyc1 encodes syn-CDP synthase and that OsCyc2 and OsCPS1 encode ent-CDP synthase. The level of expression of the OsCyc1 and OsCyc2 transcripts in rice leaves increased drastically in response to UV treatment, whereas expression of the OsCPS1 transcript was not induced by UV light. These results suggest that OsCyc1, OsCyc2 and OsCPS1 are responsible for the biosynthesis of momilactones A and B and oryzalexin S, oryzalexins A-F and phytocassanes A-E, and GAs, respectively. Our results strongly suggest the presence of two ent-CDP synthase isoforms in rice, one that participates in the biosynthesis of GAs and a second that is involved in the biosynthesis of phytoalexins.
NA	Transcripts of two ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase genes differentially localize in rice plants according to their distinct biological roles	2014	J Exp Bot	Department of Bioresource Engineering, Yamagata University, Yamagata 997-8555, Japan	Gibberellins (GAs) are diterpenoid phytohormones that regulate various aspects of plant growth. Tetracyclic hydrocarbon ent-kaurene is a biosynthetic intermediate of GAs, and is converted from geranylgeranyl diphosphate, a common precursor of diterpenoids, via ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CDP) through successive cyclization reactions catalysed by two distinct diterpene synthases, ent-CDP synthase and ent-kaurene synthase. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) has two ent-CDP synthase genes, OsCPS1 and OsCPS2. It has been thought that OsCPS1 participates in GA biosynthesis, while OsCPS2 participates in the biosynthesis of phytoalexins, phytocassanes A-E, and oryzalexins A-F. It has been shown previously that loss-of-function OsCPS1 mutants display a severe dwarf phenotype caused by GA deficiency despite possessing another ent-CDP synthase gene, OsCPS2. Here, experiments were performed to account for the non-redundant biological function of OsCPS1 and OsCPS2. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that OsCPS2 transcript levels were drastically lower than those of OsCPS1 in the basal parts, including the meristem of the second-leaf sheaths of rice seedlings. qRT-PCR results using tissue samples prepared by laser microdissection suggested that OsCPS1 transcripts mainly localized in vascular bundle tissues, similar to Arabidopsis CPS, which is responsible for GA biosynthesis, whereas OsCPS2 transcripts mainly localized in epidermal cells that address environmental stressors such as pathogen attack. Furthermore, the OsCPS2 transgene under regulation of the OsCPS1 promoter complemented the dwarf phenotype of an OsCPS1 mutant, oscps1-1. The results indicate that transcripts of the two ent-CDP synthase genes differentially localize in rice plants according to their distinct biological roles, OsCPS1 for growth and OsCPS2 for defence.
NA	Genome-wide association mapping and gene expression analysis identify OsCPS1 as a new candidate gene controlling early seedling length in rice.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Rice Research Institute &amp; Guangdong Key Laboratory of New Technology in Rice Breeding &amp; Guangdong Rice Engineering Laboratory, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guangzhou, China.	High seedling vigor can improve the ability to compete against weeds and flooding at the seedling stage and is essential for the direct seeding of rice. Early shoot length is an important performance index in seedling vigor evaluation. However, information on the identity of rice germplasm with high seedling vigor, and the genetic basis of seedling vigor are not well understood. In this study, we have conducted a genome-wide association study using 302 international diverse rice accessions from the Rice Diversity Panel 2. Six quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were found to associate with shoot length (SL). The locus qSL2 was further analyzed for candidate gene characterization. We identified OsCPS1, which encodes CDP synthase and functions in GA (Gibberellins) biosynthesis in rice, exhibits differential expression between long and short SL accessions. Using the Nipponbare genome sequence as the reference, we identified a 36â€‰bp deletion in the 5&#x27; UTR of OsCPS1 in long SL accessions, which is absent in short SL accessions. GA content analysis showed that the levels of bioactive GA(1) and GA(4) are considerably higher in long SL accessions than in short SL accessions. Genome-wide gene expression analysis indicated the expression of some photosynthesis genes is higher in long SL accessions than in short SL accessions. In contrast, genes involved in ABA (Abscisic Acid)-activated signal pathway showed lower expression in long SL accessions. Population analysis across wild rice, indica and japonica, suggested that OsCPS1 may be under selection in japonica during domestication. The results suggest that OsCPS1 is a candidate gene underlying qSL2. These data provide a promising source for candidate genetic variation associated with seedling vigor, with practical applications in rice breeding.
