OsCW-ZF3	OsCW-ZF7|WG7	Functional characterization of rice CW-domain containing zinc finger proteins involved in histone recognition.	 Here, we identified three cysteine-tryptophan (CW)-domain containing zinc finger (ZF) proteins involved in histone recognition, namely OsCW-ZF3, OsCW-ZF5 and OsCW-ZF7
OsCW-ZF3	OsCW-ZF7|WG7	Functional characterization of rice CW-domain containing zinc finger proteins involved in histone recognition.	 In contrast to OsCW-ZF3 and OsCW-ZF5 where the CW domains bind histone H3 lysine 4 with different methylated forms (H3K4me), the CW domain from OsCW-ZF7 recognizes only trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3)
