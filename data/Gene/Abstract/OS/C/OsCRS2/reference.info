NA	OsCAF1, a CRM Domain Containing Protein, Influences Chloroplast Development.	2019	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology/China National Rice Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou 310006, China.	The chloroplast RNA splicing and ribosome maturation (CRM) domain proteins are involved in the splicing of chloroplast gene introns. Numerous CRM domain proteins have been reported to play key roles in chloroplast development in several plant species. However, the functions of CRM domain proteins in chloroplast development in rice remain poorly understood. In the study, we generated oscaf1 albino mutants, which eventually died at the seedling stage, through the editing of OsCAF1 with two CRM domains using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The mesophyll cells in oscaf1 mutant had decreased chloroplast numbers and damaged chloroplast structures. OsCAF1 was located in the chloroplast, and transcripts revealed high levels in green tissues. In addition, the OsCAF1 promoted the splicing of group IIA and group IIB introns, unlike orthologous proteins of AtCAF1 and ZmCAF1, which only affected the splicing of subgroup IIB introns. We also observed that the C-terminal of OsCAF1 interacts with OsCRS2, and OsCAF1-OsCRS2 complex may participate in the splicing of group IIA and group IIB introns in rice chloroplasts. OsCAF1 regulates chloroplast development by influencing the splicing of group II introns.
NA	A Single Nucleotide Variation of CRS2 Affected the Establishment of Photosynthetic System in Rice.	2023	Int J Mol Sci	Key Laboratory of Rice Biology &amp; Genetic Breeding in Northeast China, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Areas, Rice Research Institute, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang 110866, China.	Chloroplasts are essential sites for plant photosynthesis, and the biogenesis of the photosynthetic complexes involves the interaction of nuclear genes and chloroplast genes. In this study, we identified a rice pale green leaf mutant, crs2. The crs2 mutant showed different degrees of low chlorophyll phenotypes at different growth stages, especially at the seedling stage. Fine mapping and DNA sequencing of crs2 revealed a single nucleotide substitution (G4120A) in the eighth exons of CRS2, causing a G-to-R mutation of the 229th amino acid of CRS2 (G229R). The results of complementation experiments confirmed that this single-base mutation in crs2 is responsible for the phenotype of the crs2 mutant. CRS2 encodes a chloroplast RNA splicing 2 protein localized in the chloroplast. Western blot results revealed an abnormality in the abundance of the photosynthesis-related protein in crs2. However, the mutation of CRS2 leads to the enhancement of antioxidant enzyme activity, which could reduce ROS levels. Meanwhile, with the release of Rubisco activity, the photosynthetic performance of crs2 was improved. In summary, the G229R mutation in CRS2 causes chloroplast protein abnormalities and affects photosystem performance in rice; the above findings facilitate the elucidation of the physiological mechanism of chloroplast proteins affecting photosynthesis.
