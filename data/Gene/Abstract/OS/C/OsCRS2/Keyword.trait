OsCRS2|CRS2	leaf	A Single Nucleotide Variation of CRS2 Affected the Establishment of Photosynthetic System in Rice.	 In this study, we identified a rice pale green leaf mutant, crs2
OsCRS2|CRS2	chloroplast	A Single Nucleotide Variation of CRS2 Affected the Establishment of Photosynthetic System in Rice.	 CRS2 encodes a chloroplast RNA splicing 2 protein localized in the chloroplast
OsCRS2|CRS2	chloroplast	A Single Nucleotide Variation of CRS2 Affected the Establishment of Photosynthetic System in Rice.	 In summary, the G229R mutation in CRS2 causes chloroplast protein abnormalities and affects photosystem performance in rice; the above findings facilitate the elucidation of the physiological mechanism of chloroplast proteins affecting photosynthesis
OsCRS2|CRS2	growth	A Single Nucleotide Variation of CRS2 Affected the Establishment of Photosynthetic System in Rice.	 The crs2 mutant showed different degrees of low chlorophyll phenotypes at different growth stages, especially at the seedling stage
OsCRS2|CRS2	seedling	A Single Nucleotide Variation of CRS2 Affected the Establishment of Photosynthetic System in Rice.	 The crs2 mutant showed different degrees of low chlorophyll phenotypes at different growth stages, especially at the seedling stage
OsCRS2|CRS2	photosynthesis	A Single Nucleotide Variation of CRS2 Affected the Establishment of Photosynthetic System in Rice.	 In summary, the G229R mutation in CRS2 causes chloroplast protein abnormalities and affects photosystem performance in rice; the above findings facilitate the elucidation of the physiological mechanism of chloroplast proteins affecting photosynthesis
OsCRS2|CRS2	chlorophyll	A Single Nucleotide Variation of CRS2 Affected the Establishment of Photosynthetic System in Rice.	 The crs2 mutant showed different degrees of low chlorophyll phenotypes at different growth stages, especially at the seedling stage
OsCRS2|CRS2	photosystem	A Single Nucleotide Variation of CRS2 Affected the Establishment of Photosynthetic System in Rice.	 In summary, the G229R mutation in CRS2 causes chloroplast protein abnormalities and affects photosystem performance in rice; the above findings facilitate the elucidation of the physiological mechanism of chloroplast proteins affecting photosynthesis
