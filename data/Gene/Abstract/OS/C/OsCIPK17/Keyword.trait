OsCIPK17	grain	Functional Analysis of OsCIPK17 in Rice Grain Filling.	Functional Analysis of OsCIPK17 in Rice Grain Filling.
OsCIPK17	grain	Functional Analysis of OsCIPK17 in Rice Grain Filling.	 The results showed that knockout of OsCIPK17 affected photosynthesis and starch-, sucrose-, and amino acid metabolism-related gene expression; furthermore, the mutation reduced PSII utilization efficiency, it blocked the synthesis and metabolism of starch and sucrose, and affected the formation and transport of assimilates, thereby reducing final grain weight
