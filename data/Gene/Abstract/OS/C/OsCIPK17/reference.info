NA	Functional Analysis of OsCIPK17 in Rice Grain Filling.	2022	Front Plant Sci	School of Life Sciences, Nantong University, Nantong, China.	We used mutant cipk17 and Nipponbare in field experiments to analyze agronomic traits, photosynthetic parameters, transcriptome, and gene expression. The results demonstrated cytoplasmic localization of OsCIPK17, while GUS allogeneic (A. thaliana) tissue-staining and quantitative analysis showed the gene was expressed in many organs, including flower buds; furthermore, it was involved in root, stem, and leaf growth. Compared to Nipponbare plants, grain filling rate and final grain weight decreased in plants of the knockout mutant owing to a delay in attainment of maximum grain filling rate. Photosystem II (PSII) efficiency was also reduced. Enrichment analysis showed that the functions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) focused on nucleoside-, nucleotide-, and lipid-binding, as well as hydrolase, transferase, and phosphorylase activities. Signaling pathways mainly included starch and sucrose metabolism, as well as photosynthesis. Additionally, some DEGs were verified by fluorescence analysis. The results showed that knockout of OsCIPK17 affected photosynthesis and starch-, sucrose-, and amino acid metabolism-related gene expression; furthermore, the mutation reduced PSII utilization efficiency, it blocked the synthesis and metabolism of starch and sucrose, and affected the formation and transport of assimilates, thereby reducing final grain weight.
NA	Combined metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis reveals key components of OsCIPK17 overexpression improves drought tolerance in rice.	2023	Front Plant Sci	School of Life Sciences, Nantong University, Nantong, China.	Oryza Sativa is one of the most important food crops in China, which is easily affected by drought during its growth and development. As a member of the calcium signaling pathway, CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK) plays an important role in plant growth and development as well as environmental stress. However, there is no report on the function and mechanism of OsCIPK17 in rice drought resistance. We combined transcriptional and metabonomic analysis to clarify the specific mechanism of OsCIPK17 in response to rice drought tolerance. The results showed that OsCIPK17 improved drought resistance of rice by regulating deep roots under drought stress; Response to drought by regulating the energy metabolism pathway and controlling the accumulation of citric acid in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle; Our exogenous experiments also proved that OsCIPK17 responds to citric acid, and this process involves the auxin metabolism pathway; Exogenous citric acid can improve the drought resistance of overexpression plants. Our research reveals that OsCIPK17 positively regulates rice drought resistance and participates in the accumulation of citric acid in the TCA cycle, providing new insights for rice drought resistance.
