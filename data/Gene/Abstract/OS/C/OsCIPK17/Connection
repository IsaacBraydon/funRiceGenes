OsCBL8	OsCIPK17	The OsCBL8-OsCIPK17 Module Regulates Seedling Growth and Confers Resistance to Heat and Drought in Rice.	 This study found that OsCBL8 negatively regulated rice seed germination and seedling growth by interacting with OsCIPK17 with overexpression and gene editing mutant plants as materials combining plant phenotype, physiological indicators and transcriptome sequencing
OsCBL8	OsCIPK17	The OsCBL8-OsCIPK17 Module Regulates Seedling Growth and Confers Resistance to Heat and Drought in Rice.	 Our work reveals a unique signaling pathway, wherein OsCBL8 interacts with OsCIPK17 and provides rice with multiple resistance while also regulating seedling growth
