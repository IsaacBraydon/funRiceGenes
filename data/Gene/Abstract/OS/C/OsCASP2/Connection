OsCASP1	OsCASP2	OsCASP1 forms complexes with itself and OsCASP2 in rice.	OsCASP1 forms complexes with itself and OsCASP2 in rice.
OsCASP1	OsCASP2	OsCASP1 forms complexes with itself and OsCASP2 in rice.	 Expression analysis shows that OsCASP1, OsCASP2, OsCASP3, and OsCASP5 were expressed in roots apart from OsCASP4
OsCASP1	OsCASP2	OsCASP1 forms complexes with itself and OsCASP2 in rice.	 A yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay revealed that OsCASP1 can interact with itself and OsCASP2, but not with OsCASP3 and OsCASP5
OsCASP1	OsCASP2	OsCASP1 forms complexes with itself and OsCASP2 in rice.	 These interactions of OsCASP1 with itself and OsCASP2 at the plasma membrane were confirmed using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) in rice protoplasts
OsCASP1	OsCASP2	OsCASP1 forms complexes with itself and OsCASP2 in rice.	 These results indicated that OsCASP1 can form complexes with itself and OsCASP2 in rice roots
