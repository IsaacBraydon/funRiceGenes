OsCNIH1	OsHKT1;3	Identification of rice cornichon as a possible cargo receptor for the Golgi-localized sodium transporter OsHKT1;3.	 Here it is demonstrated at the cellular level that rice cornichon OsCNIH1 interacts with OsHKT1;3 and, in yeast cells, enables the expression of the sodium transporter to the Golgi apparatus
OsCNIH1	OsHKT1;3	Identification of rice cornichon as a possible cargo receptor for the Golgi-localized sodium transporter OsHKT1;3.	 In the yeast cornichon mutant erv14, OsHKT1;3 is mistargeted, preventing the toxic effects of sodium transport in the cell observed in wild-type cells or in the erv14 mutant that co-expressed OsHKT1;3 with either OsCNIH1 or Erv14p
