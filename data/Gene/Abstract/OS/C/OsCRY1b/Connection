OsCRY1a	OsCRY1b	Cryptochrome and phytochrome cooperatively but independently reduce active gibberellin content in rice seedlings under light irradiation	 By using these lines and phytochrome mutants, we elucidated that cryptochrome 1 (cry1), consisting of two species in rice plants (cry1a and cry1b), is indispensable for robust induction of the GA2ox genes
OsCRY1a	OsCRY1b	Functional and signaling mechanism analysis of rice CRYPTOCHROME 1	 On fusion with beta-glucuronidase (GUS), the C-terminal domain of either OsCRY1a (OsCCT1a) or OsCRY1b (OsCCT1b) mediated a constitutive photomorphogenic (COP) phenotype in both Arabidopsis and rice, whereas OsCCT1b mutants corresponding to missense mutations in previously described Arabidopsis cry1 alleles failed to confer a COP phenotype
