Hirose-2012-Cryptochrome and phy.pdf	Cryptochrome and phytochrome cooperatively but independently reduce active gibberellin content in rice seedlings under light irradiation	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Photobiology and Photosynthesis Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602 Japan. fumih@affrc.go.jp	In contrast to a wealth of knowledge about the photoregulation of gibberellin metabolism in dicots, that in monocots remains largely unclear. In this study, we found that a blue light signal triggers reduction of active gibberellin content in rice seedlings with simultaneous repression of two gibberellin 20-oxidase genes (OsGA20ox2 and OsGA20ox4) and acute induction of four gibberellin 2-oxidase genes (OsGA2ox4-OsGA2ox7). For further examination of the regulation of these genes, we established a series of cryptochrome-deficient lines through reverse genetic screening from a Tos17 mutant population and construction of knockdown lines based on an RNA interference technique. By using these lines and phytochrome mutants, we elucidated that cryptochrome 1 (cry1), consisting of two species in rice plants (cry1a and cry1b), is indispensable for robust induction of the GA2ox genes. On the other hand, repression of the GA20ox genes is mediated by phytochromes. In addition, we found that the phytochromes also mediate the repression of a gibberellin 3-oxidase gene (OsGA3ox2) in the light. These results imply that, in rice seedlings, phytochromes mediate the repression of gibberellin biosynthesis capacity, while cry1 mediates the induction of gibberellin inactivation capacity. The cry1 action was demonstrated to be dominant in the reduction of active gibberellin content, but, in rice seedlings, the cumulative effects of these independent actions reduced active gibberellin content in the light. This pathway design in which different types of photoreceptors independently but cooperatively regulate active gibberellin content is unique from the viewpoint of dicot research. This redundancy should provide robustness to the response in rice plants.

Cryptochromes (CRY) are blue-light photoreceptors that mediate various light responses, such as inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, enhancement of cotyledon expansion, anthocyanin accumulation and stomatal opening in Arabidopsis. The signaling mechanism of Arabidopsis CRY is mediated through direct interaction with COP1, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis. CRY has now been characterized in tomato, pea, moss and fern, but its function in monocots is largely unknown. Here we report the function and basic signaling mechanism of rice cryptochrome 1 (OsCRY1). Overexpresion of OsCRY1b resulted in a blue light-dependent short hypcotyl phenotype in Arabidopsis, and a short coleoptile, leaf sheath and leaf blade phenotype in rice (Oryza sativa). On fusion with beta-glucuronidase (GUS), the C-terminal domain of either OsCRY1a (OsCCT1a) or OsCRY1b (OsCCT1b) mediated a constitutive photomorphogenic (COP) phenotype in both Arabidopsis and rice, whereas OsCCT1b mutants corresponding to missense mutations in previously described Arabidopsis cry1 alleles failed to confer a COP phenotype. Yeast two-hybrid and subcellular co-localization studies demonstrated that OsCRY1b interacted physically with rice COP1 (OsCOP1). From these results, we conclude that OsCRY1 is implicated in blue-light inhibition of coleoptile and leaf elongation during early seedling development in rice, and that the signaling mechanism of OsCRY1 involves direct interaction with OsCOP1.
NA	OsBIC1 Directly Interacts with OsCRYs to Regulate Leaf Sheath Length through Mediating GA-Responsive Pathway.	2021	Int J Mol Sci	Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Cryptochrome 1 and 2 (CRY1 and CRY2) are blue light receptors involved in the regulation of hypocotyl elongation, cotyledon expansion, and flowering time in Arabidopsisthaliana. Two cryptochrome-interacting proteins, Blue-light Inhibitor of Cryptochrome 1 and 2 (BIC1 and BIC2), have been found in Arabidopsis. BIC1 plays critical roles in suppressing the physiological activities of CRY2, which include the blue light-dependent dimerization, phosphorylation, photobody formation, and degradation process, but the functional characterization of BIC protein in other crops has not yet been performed. To investigate the function of BIC protein in rice (Oryza sativa), two homologous genes of Arabidopsis&amp;nbsp;BIC1 and BIC2, namely OsBIC1 and OsBIC2&amp;nbsp;(OsBICs), were identified. The overexpression of OsBIC1 and OsBIC2 led to increased leaf sheath length, whereas mutations in OsBIC1 displayed shorter leaf sheath in a blue light intensity-dependent manner. OsBIC1 regulated blue light-induced leaf sheath elongation through direct interaction with OsCRY1a, OsCRY1b, and OsCRY2 (OsCRYs). Longitudinal sections of the second leaf sheath demonstrated that OsBIC1 and OsCRYs controlled leaf sheath length by influencing the ratio of epidermal cells with different lengths. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis further proved that OsBIC1 and OsCRYs regulated similar transcriptome changes in regulating Gibberellic Acids (GA)-responsive pathway. Taken together, these results suggested that OsBIC1 and OsCRYs worked together to regulate epidermal cell elongation and control blue light-induced leaf sheath elongation through the GA-responsive pathway.
