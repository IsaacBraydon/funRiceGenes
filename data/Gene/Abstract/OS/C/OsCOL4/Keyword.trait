OsCOL4	flower	OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB	 OsCOL4 null mutants flowered early under short or long days
OsCOL4	flower	OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB	 In contrast, OsCOL4 activation-tagging mutants (OsCOL4-D) flowered late in either environment
OsCOL4	flower	OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB	 By comparison, levels of Hd1, OsID1, OsMADS50, OsMADS51, and OsMADS56 transcripts were not significantly changed in oscol4 or OsCOL4-D, suggesting that OsCOL4 functions independently from previously reported flowering pathways
OsCOL4	flower	OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB	 In osphyB mutants, OsCOL4 expression was decreased and osphyB oscol4 double mutants flowered at the same time as the osphyB single mutants, indicating OsCOL4 functions downstream of OsphyB
OsCOL4	flower	OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB	OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB
