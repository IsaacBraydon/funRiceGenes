Hd3a	OsCOL4	OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB	 Transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 were increased in the oscol4 mutants, but reduced in the OsCOL4-D mutants
OsCOL4	RFT1	OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB	 Transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 were increased in the oscol4 mutants, but reduced in the OsCOL4-D mutants
Ehd1	OsCOL4	OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB	 Transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 were increased in the oscol4 mutants, but reduced in the OsCOL4-D mutants| This finding indicates that OsCOL4 is a constitutive repressor functioning upstream of Ehd1| These pathways are: (i) night break-sensitive, which does not need OsCOL4; and (ii) night break-insensitive, in which OsCOL4 functions between OsphyB and Ehd1|OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB
OsCOL4	PHYB|OsphyB	OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB	 In osphyB mutants, OsCOL4 expression was decreased and osphyB oscol4 double mutants flowered at the same time as the osphyB single mutants, indicating OsCOL4 functions downstream of OsphyB| These pathways are: (i) night break-sensitive, which does not need OsCOL4; and (ii) night break-insensitive, in which OsCOL4 functions between OsphyB and Ehd1|OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB
