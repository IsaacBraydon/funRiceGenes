Phytochromes mediate the photoperiodic control of flowering in rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant. Recent molecular genetics studies have revealed a genetic network that enables the critical daylength response of florigen gene expression. Analyses using a rice phytochrome chromophore-deficient mutant, photoperiod sensitivity5, have so far revealed that within this network, phytochromes are required for expression of Grain number, plant height and heading date7 (Ghd7), a floral repressor gene in rice. There are three phytochrome genes in rice, but the roles of each phytochrome family member in daylength response have not previously been defined. Here, we revealed multiple action points for each phytochrome in the critical daylength response of florigen expression by using single and double phytochrome mutant lines of rice. Our results show that either phyA alone or a genetic combination of phyB and phyC can induce Ghd7 mRNA, whereas phyB alone causes some reduction in levels of Ghd7 mRNA. Moreover, phyB and phyA can affect Ghd7 activity and Early heading date1 (a floral inducer) activity in the network, respectively. Therefore, each phytochrome gene of rice has distinct roles, and all of the phytochrome actions coordinately control the critical daylength response of florigen expression in rice.

Plants recognize environmental factors to determine flowering time. CONSTANS (CO) plays a central role in the photoperiod flowering pathway of Arabidopsis, and CO protein stability is modulated by photoreceptors. In rice, Hd1, an ortholog of CO, acts as a flowering promoter, and phytochromes repress Hd1 expression. Here, we investigated the functioning of OsCOL4, a member of the CONSTANS-like (COL) family in rice. OsCOL4 null mutants flowered early under short or long days. In contrast, OsCOL4 activation-tagging mutants (OsCOL4-D) flowered late in either environment. Transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 were increased in the oscol4 mutants, but reduced in the OsCOL4-D mutants. This finding indicates that OsCOL4 is a constitutive repressor functioning upstream of Ehd1. By comparison, levels of Hd1, OsID1, OsMADS50, OsMADS51, and OsMADS56 transcripts were not significantly changed in oscol4 or OsCOL4-D, suggesting that OsCOL4 functions independently from previously reported flowering pathways. In osphyB mutants, OsCOL4 expression was decreased and osphyB oscol4 double mutants flowered at the same time as the osphyB single mutants, indicating OsCOL4 functions downstream of OsphyB. We also present evidence for two independent pathways through which OsPhyB controls flowering time. These pathways are: (i) night break-sensitive, which does not need OsCOL4; and (ii) night break-insensitive, in which OsCOL4 functions between OsphyB and Ehd1.
NA	A Combination of Long-Day Suppressor Genes Contributes to the Northward Expansion of Rice 	2020	Front Plant Sci	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Department of Center for Crop Germplasm Resources, Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Growing cultivated rice with a moderate heading date is the key to expanding its cultivation area and maintaining stable yields. The genes that regulate heading date are largely cloned; however, it remains unclear how genetic mutations and their combinations affect the heading date and adaptability of cultivated rice. Here, we report the analysis of genetic variation in eight long-day flowering suppressor genes (Hd1, DTH8, Ghd7, OsCOL4, DTH7, Hd6, Se5, and PhyB) and the phylogenetic relationship of eight genes. Genetic variations in DTH8, Ghd7, Hd1, DTH7, PhyB, and OsCOL4 are correlated with differences in heading date and the correlation between the genetic diversity of Hd6 and Se5 and rice heading data are weak. One group of haplotypes of DTH8, Ghd7, Hd1, DTH7, PhyB, and OsCOL4 are associated with earlier heading dates and appear to have accumulated during the northward expansion of rice cultivation. A minimum of four group A alleles of DTH8, Ghd7, Hd1, DTH7, PhyB, and OsCOL4 are required for the growth of cultivated rice at latitudes above 30°„N. This study presents a preliminary investigation of the genetic patterns and adaptation mechanisms of long-day flowering suppressor genes and provides a useful reference for the molecular breeding of rice cultivars for various environments and farming systems.
