OsCR4	 Together, our results suggest that OsmiR396d regulates the expression of OsGRF genes, which function with OsGIF1 in floret development through targeting of JMJ706 and OsCR4
OsCR4|MIS2	 Map-based cloning revealed that MIS2 encodes a receptor-like kinase CRINKLY4 (CR4) which showed the highest expression in developing panicles |  The 18-bp InDel (insertion and deletion) in the 5'-UTR (untranslated region) caused different expression level of MIS2 in haplotypes
