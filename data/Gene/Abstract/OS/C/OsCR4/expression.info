OsCR4	 Together, our results suggest that OsmiR396d regulates the expression of OsGRF genes, which function with OsGIF1 in floret development through targeting of JMJ706 and OsCR4
OsCR4|MIS2	 Map-based cloning revealed that MIS2 encodes a receptor-like kinase CRINKLY4 (CR4) which showed the highest expression in developing panicles |  The 18-bp InDel (insertion and deletion) in the 5'-UTR (untranslated region) caused different expression level of MIS2 in haplotypes
OsCR4|MIS2	 The deformed epidermal, mesophyll, and vascular tissues observed in oscr4 leaves arose at the postembryo stage; the corresponding expression pattern of proOsCR4:GUS in embryos and young leaves suggests that OsCR4 functions in these tissues
