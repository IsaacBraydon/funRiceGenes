ADL1|OsDEK1	OsCR4	Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice	 Gene expression of DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (OsDEK1), CRINKLY4 (OsCR4) and SUPERNUMERARY ALEURONE LAYER 1 (OsSAL1) rice homologues was decreased in the KD mutants, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RISBZ1 and RPBF
