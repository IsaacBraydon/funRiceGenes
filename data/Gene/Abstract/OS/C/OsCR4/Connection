JMJ706|OsJMJ706	OsCR4|MIS2	OsmiR396d-regulated OsGRFs function in floral organogenesis in rice through binding to their targets OsJMJ706 and OsCR4.	Together, our results suggest that OsmiR396d regulates the expression of OsGRF genes, which function with OsGIF1 in floret development through targeting of JMJ706 and OsCR4
OsCR4|MIS2	OsGRF10	OsmiR396d-regulated OsGRFs function in floral organogenesis in rice through binding to their targets OsJMJ706 and OsCR4.	OsGRF6/OsGRF10 localized to the nucleus, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that both OsGRF6 and OsGRF10 bind the GA response element in the promoters of OsJMJ706 and OsCR4, which were reported to participate in the regulation of floral organ development
OsCR4|MIS2	OsGRF10	OsmiR396d-regulated OsGRFs function in floral organogenesis in rice through binding to their targets OsJMJ706 and OsCR4.	In addition, OsGRF6 and OsGRF10 could transactivate OsJMJ706 and OsCR4, an activity that was enhanced in the presence of OsGIF1, which can bind both OsGRF6 and OsGRF10
JMJ706|OsJMJ706	OsCR4|MIS2	OsmiR396d-regulated OsGRFs function in floral organogenesis in rice through binding to their targets OsJMJ706 and OsCR4.	OsmiR396d-regulated OsGRFs function in floral organogenesis in rice through binding to their targets OsJMJ706 and OsCR4.
JMJ706|OsJMJ706	OsCR4|MIS2	OsmiR396d-regulated OsGRFs function in floral organogenesis in rice through binding to their targets OsJMJ706 and OsCR4.	Here, we report that the rice (Oryza sativa) microRNA396d (OsmiR396d) and its Os Growth Regulating Factor (OsGRF) targets, together with Os Growth Regulating Factor-Interacting Factor1 (OsGIF1), are involved in the regulation of floral organ development through the rice JMJD2 family jmjC gene 706 (OsJMJ706) and crinkly4 receptor-like kinase (OsCR4)
