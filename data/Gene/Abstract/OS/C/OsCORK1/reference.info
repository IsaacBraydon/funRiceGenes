Copper (Cu) is vital for plant growth but becomes toxic in excess, posing potential threats to human health. Although receptor-like kinases (RLKs) have been studied in plant response to abiotic stresses, their roles in Cu stress response remain poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate Cu toxicity effects on rice and elucidate its potential molecular mechanisms. Specifically, rice lectin-type RLK OsCORK1 (Copper-response receptor-like kinase 1) function in Cu stress response was investigated. RNA sequencing and expression assays revealed that OsCORK1 is mainly expressed in roots and leaves, and its expression and dose-dependently. Kinase activity assays demonstrated OsCORK1 as a Mn(2+)-preferred functional kinase. Genetically, OsCORK1 gene-edited mutants exhibited increased tolerance to Cu stress and reduced Cu accumulation compared to the wild type (WT). Conversely, OsCORK1 overexpression compromised the Cu stress tolerance observed in OsCORK1 gene-edited mutants. OsCORK1 gene-edited mutants slightly damaged the root tips compared to the WT under Cu stress. Furthermore, OsCORK1 was demonstrated to modulate Cu stress tolerance by mainly altering cell wall components, particularly lignin, in rice. Overall, OsCORK1 is an important negative regulator of Cu stress tolerance, providing a potential gene target to reduce Cu pollution in rice production.
