OsCAF2	chloroplast	OsCAF2 contains two CRM domains and is necessary for chloroplast development in rice	OsCAF2 contains two CRM domains and is necessary for chloroplast development in rice
OsCAF2	chloroplast	OsCAF2 contains two CRM domains and is necessary for chloroplast development in rice	 Phenotypic analysis showed that mutations to OsCAF2 led to albino leaves at the seeding stage that eventually caused plant death, and oscaf2 mutant plants had fewer chloroplasts and damaged chloroplast structure
OsCAF2	chloroplast	OsCAF2 contains two CRM domains and is necessary for chloroplast development in rice	  Conclusion: Taken together, this study improved our understanding of the OsCAF2 protein, and revealed additional information about the molecular mechanism of OsCAF2 in regulating of chloroplast development in rice
OsCAF2	development	OsCAF2 contains two CRM domains and is necessary for chloroplast development in rice	OsCAF2 contains two CRM domains and is necessary for chloroplast development in rice
OsCAF2	development	OsCAF2 contains two CRM domains and is necessary for chloroplast development in rice	 However, the research of the OsCAF2 gene in rice is very little, and the effects of OsCAF2 genes on chloroplasts development are not well characterized
OsCAF2	development	OsCAF2 contains two CRM domains and is necessary for chloroplast development in rice	  Conclusion: Taken together, this study improved our understanding of the OsCAF2 protein, and revealed additional information about the molecular mechanism of OsCAF2 in regulating of chloroplast development in rice
