Background: Chloroplasts play an important role in plant growth and development. The chloroplast genome contains approximately twenty group II introns that are spliced due to proteins encoded by nuclear genes. CAF2 is one of these splicing factors that has been shown to splice group IIB introns in maize and Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the research of the OsCAF2 gene in rice is very little, and the effects of OsCAF2 genes on chloroplasts development are not well characterized.  Results: In this study, oscaf2 mutants were obtained by editing the OsCAF2 gene in the Nipponbare variety of rice. Phenotypic analysis showed that mutations to OsCAF2 led to albino leaves at the seeding stage that eventually caused plant death, and oscaf2 mutant plants had fewer chloroplasts and damaged chloroplast structure. We speculated that OsCAF2 might participate in the splicing of group IIA and IIB introns, which differs from its orthologs in A. thaliana and maize. Through yeast two-hybrid experiments, we found that the C-terminal region of OsCAF2 interacted with OsCRS2 and formed an OsCAF2-OsCRS2 complex. In addition, the N-terminal region of OsCAF2 interacted with itself to form homodimers.  Conclusion: Taken together, this study improved our understanding of the OsCAF2 protein, and revealed additional information about the molecular mechanism of OsCAF2 in regulating of chloroplast development in rice.
