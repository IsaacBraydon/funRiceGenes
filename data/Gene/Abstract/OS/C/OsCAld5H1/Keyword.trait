OsCAld5H1	vegetative	Regulation of CONIFERALDEHYDE 5-HYDROXYLASE expression to modulate cell wall lignin structure in rice.	 Among three CAld5H genes identified in rice, OsCAld5H1 (CYP84A5) appeared to be predominantly expressed in lignin-producing rice vegetative tissues
OsCAld5H1	cell wall	Regulation of CONIFERALDEHYDE 5-HYDROXYLASE expression to modulate cell wall lignin structure in rice.	 Our data collectively demonstrate that OsCAld5H1 expression is a major factor controlling S/G lignin composition in rice cell walls
OsCAld5H1	lignin	Regulation of CONIFERALDEHYDE 5-HYDROXYLASE expression to modulate cell wall lignin structure in rice.	 Our data collectively demonstrate that OsCAld5H1 expression is a major factor controlling S/G lignin composition in rice cell walls
