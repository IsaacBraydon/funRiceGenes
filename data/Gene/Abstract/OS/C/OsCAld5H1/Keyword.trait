OsCAld5H1|CYP84A5	vegetative	Regulation of CONIFERALDEHYDE 5-HYDROXYLASE expression to modulate cell wall lignin structure in rice.	 Among three CAld5H genes identified in rice, OsCAld5H1 (CYP84A5) appeared to be predominantly expressed in lignin-producing rice vegetative tissues
OsCAld5H1|CYP84A5	cell wall	Regulation of CONIFERALDEHYDE 5-HYDROXYLASE expression to modulate cell wall lignin structure in rice.	 Our data collectively demonstrate that OsCAld5H1 expression is a major factor controlling S/G lignin composition in rice cell walls
OsCAld5H1|CYP84A5	lignin	Regulation of CONIFERALDEHYDE 5-HYDROXYLASE expression to modulate cell wall lignin structure in rice.	 Our data collectively demonstrate that OsCAld5H1 expression is a major factor controlling S/G lignin composition in rice cell walls
OsCAld5H1|CYP84A5	lignin	Lignin characterization of rice CONIFERALDEHYDE 5-HYDROXYLASE loss-of-function mutants generated with the CRISPR/Cas9 system.	 In the present study, to further investigate the effect of suppression of OsCAld5H1 on rice lignin structure, we generated loss-of-function mutants of OsCAld5H1 using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing system
