NA	Regulation of CONIFERALDEHYDE 5-HYDROXYLASE expression to modulate cell wall lignin structure in rice.	2017	Planta	Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere, Kyoto University, Uji, Kyoto, 611-0011, Japan.	Regulation of a gene encoding coniferaldehyde 5-hydroxylase leads to substantial alterations in lignin structure in rice cell walls, identifying a promising genetic engineering target for improving grass biomass utilization. The aromatic composition of lignin greatly affects utilization characteristics of lignocellulosic biomass and, therefore, has been one of the primary targets of cell wall engineering studies. Limited information is, however, available regarding lignin modifications in monocotyledonous grasses, despite the fact that grass lignocelluloses have a great potential for feedstocks of biofuel production and various biorefinery applications. Here, we report that manipulation of a gene encoding coniferaldehyde 5-hydroxylase (CAld5H, or ferulate 5-hydroxylase, F5H) leads to substantial alterations in syringyl (S)/guaiacyl (G) lignin aromatic composition in rice (Oryza sativa), a major model grass and commercially important crop. Among three CAld5H genes identified in rice, OsCAld5H1 (CYP84A5) appeared to be predominantly expressed in lignin-producing rice vegetative tissues. Down-regulation of OsCAld5H1 produced altered lignins largely enriched in G units, whereas up-regulation of OsCAld5H1 resulted in lignins enriched in S units, as revealed by a series of wet-chemical and NMR structural analyses. Our data collectively demonstrate that OsCAld5H1 expression is a major factor controlling S/G lignin composition in rice cell walls. Given that S/G lignin composition affects various biomass properties, we contemplate that manipulation of CAld5H gene expression represents a promising strategy to upgrade grass biomass for biorefinery applications.
NA	Lignin characterization of rice CONIFERALDEHYDE 5-HYDROXYLASE loss-of-function mutants generated with the CRISPR/Cas9 system.	2018	Plant J	Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere, Kyoto University, Uji, Kyoto, 611-0011, Japan.	Aromatic composition of lignin is an important trait that greatly affects the usability of lignocellulosic biomass. We previously identified a rice (Oryza sativa) gene encoding coniferaldehyde 5-hydroxylase (OsCAld5H1), which was effective in modulating syringyl (S)/guaiacyl (G) lignin composition ratio in rice, a model grass species. Previously characterized OsCAld5H1-knockdown rice lines, which were produced via an RNA-interference approach, showed augmented G lignin units yet contained considerable amounts of residual S lignin units. In the present study, to further investigate the effect of suppression of OsCAld5H1 on rice lignin structure, we generated loss-of-function mutants of OsCAld5H1 using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing system. Homozygous OsCAld5H1-knockout lines harboring anticipated frame-shift mutations in OsCAld5H1 were successfully obtained. A series of wet-chemical and two-dimensional NMR analyses on cell walls demonstrated that, although lignins in the mutant were predictably enriched in G units, all tested mutant lines produced considerable amounts of S units. Intriguingly, lignin ¦Ã-p-coumaroylation analysis by the derivatization followed by reductive cleavage (DFRC) method revealed that enrichment of G units in lignins of the mutant was limited to the non- ¦Ã-p-coumaroylated units, whereas grass-specific ¦Ã-p-coumaroylated lignin units were almost unaffected. Gene expression analysis indicated that no homologous genes of OsCAld5H1 were overexpressed in the mutants. These data suggested that CAld5H is mainly involved in the production of non ¦Ã-p-coumaroylated S lignin units, common in both eudicots and grasses, but not in the production of grass-specific ¦Ã-p-coumaroylated S units in rice.
