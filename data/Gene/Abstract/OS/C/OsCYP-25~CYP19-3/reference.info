Ahn-2010-Classification of ri.pdf	Classification of rice (Oryza sativa L. Japonica nipponbare) immunophilins (FKBPs, CYPs) and expression patterns under water stress	2010	BMC Plant Biol	Plant Systems Engineering Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Daejeon 305-506, Korea.	BACKGROUND: FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs) and cyclophilins (CYPs) are abundant and ubiquitous proteins belonging to the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) superfamily, which regulate much of metabolism through a chaperone or an isomerization of proline residues during protein folding. They are collectively referred to as immunophilin (IMM), being present in almost all cellular organs. In particular, a number of IMMs relate to environmental stresses. RESULTS: FKBP and CYP proteins in rice (Oryza sativa cv. Japonica) were identified and classified, and given the appropriate name for each IMM, considering the ortholog-relation with Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas or molecular weight of the proteins. 29 FKBP and 27 CYP genes can putatively be identified in rice; among them, a number of genes can be putatively classified as orthologs of Arabidopsis IMMs. However, some genes were novel, did not match with those of Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas, and several genes were paralogs by genetic duplication. Among 56 IMMs in rice, a significant number are regulated by salt and/or desiccation stress. In addition, their expression levels responding to the water-stress have been analyzed in different tissues, and some subcellular IMMs located by means of tagging with GFP protein. CONCLUSION: Like other green photosynthetic organisms such as Arabidopsis (23 FKBPs and 29 CYPs) and Chlamydomonas (23 FKBs and 26 CYNs), rice has the highest number of IMM genes among organisms reported so far, suggesting that the numbers relate closely to photosynthesis. Classification of the putative FKBPs and CYPs in rice provides the information about their evolutional/functional significance when comparisons are drawn with the relatively well studied genera, Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas. In addition, many of the genes upregulated by water stress offer the possibility of manipulating the stress responses in rice.

The predicted amino acid sequences of each are 72% identical to human T-cell cyclophilin. Genomic DNA gel blot analysis suggests cyclophilins in rice are encoded by a small, 6-10-member gene family. Both Cyp1 and Cyp2 have seven extra amino acid residues in the N-terminal portion of the proteins that are not found in human or other non-plant cyclophilins, suggesting that this is a characteristic of plant cyclophilins. Cyp2 was expressed as 1000 nt transcripts in leaf and root tissues. Cyp1 was expressed as 800 and 900 nt transcripts. Whereas the 900 nt transcript was present in both root and leaf mRNA, the 800 nt transcript was only detectable in root mRNA. A genomic clone of Cyp2 was isolated, sequenced and shown to lack introns. A single transcriptional start site was identified 27 residues downstream of a putative TATA box. The 5' end of the transcript was shown to contain a region rich in adenyl residues (27 of 35). This region would not be conducive to secondary structure formation, which raises the possibility that Cyp2 might be preferentially translated during stress conditions.
cib-6-e25260.pdf	Multiple abiotic stress responsive rice cyclophilin: (OsCYP-25) mediates a wide range of cellular responses	2013	Commun Integr Biol	Plant Molecular Biology Group; International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology; Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, India.	Cyclophilins (CYP), a member of immunophillin group of proteins, are more often conserved in all genera including plants. Here, we report on the identification of a new cyclophilin gene OsCYP-25 (LOC_Os09 g39780) from rice which found to be upregulated in response to various abiotic stresses viz., salinity, cold, heat and drought. It has an ORF of 540 bp, encoding a protein of 179 amino acids, consisting of PPIase domain, which is highly conserved. The OsCYP-25 promoter analysis revealed that different cis-regulatory elements (e.g., MYBCORE, MYC, CBFHV, GT1GMSCAM4, DRECRTCOREAT, CCAATBOX1, WRKY71OS and WBOXATNPR1) are involved to mediate OsCYP-25 response under stress. We have also predicted interacting partners by STRING software. In interactome, protein partners includes WD domain containing protein, the 60S ribosome subunit biogenesis protein, the ribosomal protein L10, the DEAD-box helicase, the EIF-2alpha, YT521-B protein, the 60S ribosomal protein and the PPR repeat domain containing protein. The in silico analysis showed that OsCYP-25 interacts with different proteins involved in cell growth, differentiation, ribosome biogenesis, RNA metabolism, RNA editing, gene expression, signal transduction or stress response. These findings suggest that OsCYP-25 might perform an important function in mediating wide range of cellular response under multiple abiotic stresses.
