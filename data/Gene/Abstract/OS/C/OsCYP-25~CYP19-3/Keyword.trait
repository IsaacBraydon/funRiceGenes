OsCYP-25|CYP19-3	abiotic stress	Multiple abiotic stress responsive rice cyclophilin: (OsCYP-25) mediates a wide range of cellular responses	" Here, we report on the identification of a new cyclophilin gene OsCYP-25 (LOC_Os09 g39780) from rice which found to be upregulated in response to various abiotic stresses viz| These findings suggest that OsCYP-25 might perform an important function in mediating wide range of cellular response under multiple abiotic stresses|Multiple abiotic stress responsive rice cyclophilin: (OsCYP-25) mediates a wide range of cellular responses"
OsCYP-25|CYP19-3	growth	Multiple abiotic stress responsive rice cyclophilin: (OsCYP-25) mediates a wide range of cellular responses	 The in silico analysis showed that OsCYP-25 interacts with different proteins involved in cell growth, differentiation, ribosome biogenesis, RNA metabolism, RNA editing, gene expression, signal transduction or stress response
