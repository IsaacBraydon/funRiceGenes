OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsIAA11	Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.	Here we show that peptidyl-prolyl isomerization of rice OsIAA11 catalysed by LATERAL ROOTLESS2 (LRT2), a cyclophilin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, directly regulates the stability of OsIAA11
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsIAA11	Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.	NMR spectroscopy reveals that LRT2 efficiently catalyses the cis/trans isomerization of OsIAA11
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsIAA11	Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.	The lrt2 mutation reduces OsTIR1-OsIAA11 interaction and consequently causes the accumulation of a higher level of OsIAA11 protein
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsIAA11	Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.	Moreover, knockdown of the OsIAA11 expression partially rescues the lrt2 mutant phenotype in lateral root development
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsTIR1	Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling	The lrt2 mutation reduces OsTIR1-OsIAA11 interaction and consequently causes the accumulation of a  higher level of OsIAA11 protein.
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsZFP	A zinc finger protein, interacted with cyclophilin, affects root development via IAA pathway in rice.	 Yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down results confirmed that OsCYP2 interacted with a C2HC-type zinc finger protein (OsZFP, Os01g0252900) which is located in the rice nucleus
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsZFP	A zinc finger protein, interacted with cyclophilin, affects root development via IAA pathway in rice.	 T2 OsZFP-RNAi lines had significantly fewer lateral roots than did wild type plants, which suggests a role for OsCYP2 and OsZFP in regulating lateral root development
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsZFP	A zinc finger protein, interacted with cyclophilin, affects root development via IAA pathway in rice.	 These findings imply that OsCYP2 and OsZFP participate in IAA signal pathways controlling lateral root development
