OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsZFP	A zinc finger protein, interacted with cyclophilin, affects root development via IAA pathway in rice.	 Yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down results confirmed that OsCYP2 interacted with a C2HC-type zinc finger protein (OsZFP, Os01g0252900) which is located in the rice nucleus
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsZFP	A zinc finger protein, interacted with cyclophilin, affects root development via IAA pathway in rice.	 T2 OsZFP-RNAi lines had significantly fewer lateral roots than did wild type plants, which suggests a role for OsCYP2 and OsZFP in regulating lateral root development

OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsIAA11	Quantification of reaction cycle parameters for an essential molecular switch in an auxin-responsive transcription circuit in rice.	 In rice, a tryptophan-proline (W-P) cis-trans switch in transcription repressor protein OsIAA11 along with its associated cyclophilin LRT2 are essential components in a negative feedback gene regulation circuit that controls lateral root initiation in response to the plant hormone auxin
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsIAA11	Quantification of reaction cycle parameters for an essential molecular switch in an auxin-responsive transcription circuit in rice.	 Here we present NMR studies that determine and independently validate these parameters for LRT2 catalysis of the W-P motif in OsIAA11, providing predictive power for understanding the role of this switch in the auxin-responsive circuit and the resulting lateral rootless phenotype in rice
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsIAA11	Quantification of reaction cycle parameters for an essential molecular switch in an auxin-responsive transcription circuit in rice.	 We show that the observed isomerization rate is linearly dependent on LRT2 concentration but is independent of OsIAA11 concentration over a wide range, and LRT2 is optimally tuned to maintain OsIAA11 at its cis-trans equilibrium to supply the slower downstream cis-specific proteasomal degradation with maximal OsIAA11 substrate
