OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P	Expression of a cyclophilin OsCyp2-P isolated from a salt-tolerant landrace of rice in tobacco alleviates stress via ion homeostasis and limiting ROS accumulation. |  Ectopic expression of OsCyp2-P imparted multiple abiotic stress tolerance to transgenic tobacco plants as evidenced by higher root length, shoot length, chlorophyll content, and K(+)/Na(+) ratio under stress conditions
