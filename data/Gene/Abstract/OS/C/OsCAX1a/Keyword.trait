OsCAX1a	root	Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+	OsCAX1a mRNA was induced in roots by high concentrations of Ca(2+)
OsCAX1a	homeostasis	Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+	These results suggest that OsCAX1a transports Ca(2+) into vacuoles and is involved in Ca(2+) homeostasis in cells that suffer from high concentrations of Ca(2+)
OsCAX1a	flower	Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+	Furthermore, transgenic rice plants transformed with the OsCAX1a promoter fused to beta-glucuronidase showed reporter expression in vascular bundles, stomata, trichomes, steles, flowers, embryos and aleurone layers
OsCAX1a	vascular bundle	Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+	Furthermore, transgenic rice plants transformed with the OsCAX1a promoter fused to beta-glucuronidase showed reporter expression in vascular bundles, stomata, trichomes, steles, flowers, embryos and aleurone layers
OsCAX1a	stomata	Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+	Furthermore, transgenic rice plants transformed with the OsCAX1a promoter fused to beta-glucuronidase showed reporter expression in vascular bundles, stomata, trichomes, steles, flowers, embryos and aleurone layers
OsCAX1a	stomata	Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+	In the case of stomata and trichomes, transcription of OsCAX1a was particularly high in aged organs
OsCAX1a	panicle	Ca(2+) deficiency triggers panicle degeneration in rice mediated by Ca(2+) /H(+) exchanger OsCAX1a.	 Following, the panicle degeneration gene OsCAX1a was identified in the mutant, which was involved in Ca(2+) transport
OsCAX1a	panicle	Ca(2+) deficiency triggers panicle degeneration in rice mediated by Ca(2+) /H(+) exchanger OsCAX1a.	 Our results explained the key role of OsCAX1a in Ca(2+) transport and distribution and laid a foundation to further explore the genetic and molecular mechanisms of panicle degeneration in rice
