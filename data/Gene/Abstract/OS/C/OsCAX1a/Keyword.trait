OsCAX1a	root	Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+	 OsCAX1a mRNA was induced in roots by high concentrations of Ca(2+)
OsCAX1a	homeostasis	Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+	 These results suggest that OsCAX1a transports Ca(2+) into vacuoles and is involved in Ca(2+) homeostasis in cells that suffer from high concentrations of Ca(2+)
OsCAX1a	flower	Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+	 Furthermore, transgenic rice plants transformed with the OsCAX1a promoter fused to beta-glucuronidase showed reporter expression in vascular bundles, stomata, trichomes, steles, flowers, embryos and aleurone layers
OsCAX1a	vascular bundle	Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+	 Furthermore, transgenic rice plants transformed with the OsCAX1a promoter fused to beta-glucuronidase showed reporter expression in vascular bundles, stomata, trichomes, steles, flowers, embryos and aleurone layers
OsCAX1a	stomata	Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+	 Furthermore, transgenic rice plants transformed with the OsCAX1a promoter fused to beta-glucuronidase showed reporter expression in vascular bundles, stomata, trichomes, steles, flowers, embryos and aleurone layers| In the case of stomata and trichomes, transcription of OsCAX1a was particularly high in aged organs
