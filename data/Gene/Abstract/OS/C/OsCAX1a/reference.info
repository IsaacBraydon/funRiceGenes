Plant Cell Physiol-2006-Kamiya-96-106.pdf	Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Cell Dynamics, Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Japan.	Calcium is an essential macronutrient for plants and functions in signal transduction. Regulation of the cytosolic calcium concentration is required for normal cell growth. In calcium homeostasis in plant cells, Ca(2+)/H(+) exchangers are involved in Ca(2+) compartmentalization into intracellular compartments. Here, we examine the intracellular localization of a rice Ca(2+)/H(+) exchanger, OsCAX1a, fused to a green fluorescent protein and transiently expressed in onion epidermis and rice protoplasts. Green fluorescence was observed in the vacuolar membrane. After sucrose gradient centrifugation of the homogenate of rice plants, OsCAX1a was detected in the same fraction as the vacuolar membrane aquaporin gamma-TIP. We then quantified the mRNA and protein of OsCAX1a in plants grown with metal ions. OsCAX1a mRNA was induced in roots by high concentrations of Ca(2+). The protein level in shoots was also increased in the presence of high concentrations of Ca(2+). Furthermore, transgenic rice plants transformed with the OsCAX1a promoter fused to beta-glucuronidase showed reporter expression in vascular bundles, stomata, trichomes, steles, flowers, embryos and aleurone layers. In the case of stomata and trichomes, transcription of OsCAX1a was particularly high in aged organs. These results suggest that OsCAX1a transports Ca(2+) into vacuoles and is involved in Ca(2+) homeostasis in cells that suffer from high concentrations of Ca(2+).
NA	Ca(2+) deficiency triggers panicle degeneration in rice mediated by Ca(2+) /H(+) exchanger OsCAX1a.	2023	Plant Cell Environ	Rice Research Institute, Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hefei, China.	Increasing rice yield has always been one of the primary objectives of rice breeding. However, panicle degeneration often occurs in rice-growing regions and severely curbs rice yield. In this study, we obtained a new apical panicle degeneration mutant, which induces a marked degeneration rate and diminishes the final grain yield. Cellular and physiological analyses revealed that the apical panicle undergoes programmed cell death, accompanied by excessive accumulations of peroxides. Following, the panicle degeneration gene OsCAX1a was identified in the mutant, which was involved in Ca(2+) transport. Hydroponics assays and Ca(2+) quantification confirmed that Ca(2+) transport and distribution to apical tissues were restricted and over-accumulated in the mutant sheath. Ca(2+) transport between cytoplasm and vacuole was affected, and the reduced Ca(2+) content in the vacuole and cell wall of the apical panicle and the decreased Ca(2+) absorption appeared in the mutant. RNA-Seq data indicated that the abnormal CBL (calcineurin b-like proteins) pathway mediated by deficient Ca(2+) might occur in the mutant, resulting in the burst of ROS and programmed cell death in panicles. Our results explained the key role of OsCAX1a in Ca(2+) transport and distribution and laid a foundation to further explore the genetic and molecular mechanisms of panicle degeneration in rice.
