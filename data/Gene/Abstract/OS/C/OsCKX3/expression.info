OsCKX3	 Phenotypic analysis showed that rice osckx3 mutants had smaller leaf angles, while the overexpression lines (OsCKX3-OE) had larger leaf angles |  Reverse transcription quantitative PCR, promoter-fused Î²-glucuronidase expression, and subcellular localization assays indicated that OsCKX3 was highly expressed in the lamina joint, and OsCKX3-GFP fusion protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum |  Consistently, tZ and iP levels increased in the osckx3 mutants but decreased in the OsCKX3 overexpression lines	 Phenotypic analysis showed that rice osckx3 mutants had smaller leaf angles, while the overexpression lines (OsCKX3-OE) had larger leaf angles |  Consistently, tZ and iP levels increased in the osckx3 mutants but decreased in the OsCKX3 overexpression lines
