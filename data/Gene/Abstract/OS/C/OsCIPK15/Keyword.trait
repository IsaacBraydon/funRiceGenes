OsCIPK15	cell death	Regulation of Microbe-Associated Molecular Pattern-Induced Hypersensitive Cell Death, Phytoalexin Production, and Defense Gene Expression by Calcineurin B-Like Protein-Interacting Protein Kinases, OsCIPK14/15, in Rice Cultured Cells	On the other hand, TvX/EIX-induced cell death was enhanced in OsCIPK15-overexpressing lines
OsCIPK15	ethylene	Regulation of Microbe-Associated Molecular Pattern-Induced Hypersensitive Cell Death, Phytoalexin Production, and Defense Gene Expression by Calcineurin B-Like Protein-Interacting Protein Kinases, OsCIPK14/15, in Rice Cultured Cells	We here identified two CIPKs, OsCIPK14 and OsCIPK15, rapidly induced by microbe-associated molecular patterns, including chitooligosaccharides and xylanase (Trichoderma viride/ethylene-inducing xylanase [TvX/EIX]), in rice (Oryza sativa)
OsCIPK15	drought	Characterization of stress-responsive CIPK genes in rice for stress tolerance improvement	 Transgenic plants overexpressing the transgenes OsCIPK03, OsCIPK12, and OsCIPK15 showed significantly improved tolerance to cold, drought, and salt stress, respectively
OsCIPK15	salt stress	Characterization of stress-responsive CIPK genes in rice for stress tolerance improvement	 Transgenic plants overexpressing the transgenes OsCIPK03, OsCIPK12, and OsCIPK15 showed significantly improved tolerance to cold, drought, and salt stress, respectively
OsCIPK15	salt	Characterization of stress-responsive CIPK genes in rice for stress tolerance improvement	 Transgenic plants overexpressing the transgenes OsCIPK03, OsCIPK12, and OsCIPK15 showed significantly improved tolerance to cold, drought, and salt stress, respectively
