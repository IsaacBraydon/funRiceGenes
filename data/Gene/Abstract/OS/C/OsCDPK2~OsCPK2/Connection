OsCDPK13|OsCDPK11|OsCPK11	OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	Molecular cloning of two novel rice cDNA sequences encoding putative calcium-dependent protein kinases	We have isolated, from a cDNA library constructed from rice coleoptiles, two sequences, OSCPK2 and OSCPK11, that encode for putative calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) proteins| OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 cDNAs are related to SPK, another gene encoding a rice CDPK that is specifically expressed in developing seeds [20]| OSCPK2 and OSCPK11-predicted protein sequences are 533 and 542 amino acids (aa) long with a corresponding molecular mass of 59436 and 61079 Da respectively| The calmodulin-like regulatory domain of the predicted OSCPK2 protein contains 4 EF-hand calcium-binding sites while OSCPK11 has conserved just one canonical EF-hand motif| In addition, OSCPK2- and OSCPK11-predicted proteins contain, at their N-terminal region preceding the catalytic domain, a stretch of 80 or 74 residues highly rich in hydrophilic amino acids| Comparison of the NH2-terminal sequence of all three rice CDPKs so far identified (OSCPK2, OSCPK11 and SPK) indicates the presence of a conserved MGxxC(S/Q)xxT motif that may define a consensus signal for N-myristoylation| OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 proteins are both encoded by a single-copy gene and their polyadenylated transcripts are 2| OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 mRNAs are equally abundant in rice roots and coleoptiles| A 12 h white light treatment of the coleoptiles reduces the amount of OSCPK2 mRNA with only a slight effect on the level of OSCPK11 transcript| With anoxic treatments, OSCPK2 mRNA level declined significantly and promptly while the amount of OSCPK11 transcript remained constant
