OsCDPK13|OsCDPK11|OsCPK11	OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	Molecular cloning of two novel rice cDNA sequences encoding putative calcium-dependent protein kinases	 The calmodulin-like regulatory domain of the predicted OSCPK2 protein contains 4 EF-hand calcium-binding sites while OSCPK11 has conserved just one canonical EF-hand motif
OsCDPK13|OsCDPK11|OsCPK11	OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	Molecular cloning of two novel rice cDNA sequences encoding putative calcium-dependent protein kinases	 In addition, OSCPK2- and OSCPK11-predicted proteins contain, at their N-terminal region preceding the catalytic domain, a stretch of 80 or 74 residues highly rich in hydrophilic amino acids
OsCDPK13|OsCDPK11|OsCPK11	OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	Molecular cloning of two novel rice cDNA sequences encoding putative calcium-dependent protein kinases	 Comparison of the NH2-terminal sequence of all three rice CDPKs so far identified (OSCPK2, OSCPK11 and SPK) indicates the presence of a conserved MGxxC(S/Q)xxT motif that may define a consensus signal for N-myristoylation
OsCDPK13|OsCDPK11|OsCPK11	OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	Molecular cloning of two novel rice cDNA sequences encoding putative calcium-dependent protein kinases	 OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 proteins are both encoded by a single-copy gene and their polyadenylated transcripts are 2
OsCDPK13|OsCDPK11|OsCPK11	OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	Molecular cloning of two novel rice cDNA sequences encoding putative calcium-dependent protein kinases	 OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 mRNAs are equally abundant in rice roots and coleoptiles
OsCDPK13|OsCDPK11|OsCPK11	OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	Molecular cloning of two novel rice cDNA sequences encoding putative calcium-dependent protein kinases	 A 12 h white light treatment of the coleoptiles reduces the amount of OSCPK2 mRNA with only a slight effect on the level of OSCPK11 transcript
OsCDPK13|OsCDPK11|OsCPK11	OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	Molecular cloning of two novel rice cDNA sequences encoding putative calcium-dependent protein kinases	 With anoxic treatments, OSCPK2 mRNA level declined significantly and promptly while the amount of OSCPK11 transcript remained constant
OsCDPK13|OsCDPK11|OsCPK11	OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	Rice calcium-dependent protein kinase isoforms OsCDPK2 and OsCDPK11 show different responses to light and different expression patterns during seed development	We investigated the spatial and temporal expression patterns of two rice calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), OsCDPK2 and OSCDPK11, using isoform-specific antisera
OsCDPK13|OsCDPK11|OsCPK11	OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	Rice calcium-dependent protein kinase isoforms OsCDPK2 and OsCDPK11 show different responses to light and different expression patterns during seed development	 Bands of the expected molecular sizes for OsCDPK2 (59 kDa) and OsCDPK11 (61 kDa) were detected on western blots
OsCDPK13|OsCDPK11|OsCPK11	OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	Rice calcium-dependent protein kinase isoforms OsCDPK2 and OsCDPK11 show different responses to light and different expression patterns during seed development	 OsCDPK2 and OsCDPK11 mRNA and protein levels increased in unison during flower development
OsCDPK13|OsCDPK11|OsCPK11	OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	Rice calcium-dependent protein kinase isoforms OsCDPK2 and OsCDPK11 show different responses to light and different expression patterns during seed development	Rice calcium-dependent protein kinase isoforms OsCDPK2 and OsCDPK11 show different responses to light and different expression patterns during seed development
