OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	stem	Overexpression of the calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCDPK2 in transgenic rice is repressed by light in leaves and disrupts seed development	High levels of OsCDPK2 were detected in leaves removed from etiolated plants, as well as in stems and flowers
OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	seed	Overexpression of the calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCDPK2 in transgenic rice is repressed by light in leaves and disrupts seed development	The morphological phenotype of transgenic plants producing high levels of recombinant OsCDPK2 was normal until the onset of seed development
OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	seed	Overexpression of the calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCDPK2 in transgenic rice is repressed by light in leaves and disrupts seed development	Overexpression of the calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCDPK2 in transgenic rice is repressed by light in leaves and disrupts seed development
OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	flower	Overexpression of the calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCDPK2 in transgenic rice is repressed by light in leaves and disrupts seed development	High levels of OsCDPK2 were detected in leaves removed from etiolated plants, as well as in stems and flowers
OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	seed	Rice calcium-dependent protein kinase isoforms OsCDPK2 and OsCDPK11 show different responses to light and different expression patterns during seed development	OsCDPK2 protein was expressed at low levels during early seed development, but increased to high levels that were maintained in later stages (20 days after fertilisation, DAF)
OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	seed	Rice calcium-dependent protein kinase isoforms OsCDPK2 and OsCDPK11 show different responses to light and different expression patterns during seed development	Rice calcium-dependent protein kinase isoforms OsCDPK2 and OsCDPK11 show different responses to light and different expression patterns during seed development
OsCDPK2|OsCPK2	root	Molecular cloning of two novel rice cDNA sequences encoding putative calcium-dependent protein kinases	OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 mRNAs are equally abundant in rice roots and coleoptiles
