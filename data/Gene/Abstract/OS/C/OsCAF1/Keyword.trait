OsCAF1	chloroplast	OsCAF1, a CRM Domain Containing Protein, Influences Chloroplast Development.	 The mesophyll cells in oscaf1 mutant had decreased chloroplast numbers and damaged chloroplast structures
OsCAF1	chloroplast	OsCAF1, a CRM Domain Containing Protein, Influences Chloroplast Development.	 OsCAF1 regulates chloroplast development by influencing the splicing of group II introns
OsCAF1	seedling	OsCAF1, a CRM Domain Containing Protein, Influences Chloroplast Development.	 In the study, we generated oscaf1 albino mutants, which eventually died at the seedling stage, through the editing of OsCAF1 with two CRM domains using CRISPR/Cas9 technology
