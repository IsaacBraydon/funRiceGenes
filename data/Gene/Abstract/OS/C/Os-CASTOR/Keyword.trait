Os-CASTOR	mycorrhizal symbiosis	Antiquity and function of CASTOR and POLLUX, the twin ion channel-encoding genes key to the evolution of root symbioses in plants	We demonstrate that the rice orthologs of CASTOR and POLLUX, namely Os-CASTOR and Os-POLLUX, are indispensable for mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice and that Os-POLLUX can restore nodulation, but not rhizobial infection, to a M. truncatula dmi1 mutant.
