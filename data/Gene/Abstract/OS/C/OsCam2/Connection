OsCam1-2|OsCam1	OsCam2	Calcium signaling-mediated and differential induction of calmodulin gene expression by stress in Oryza sativa L	 Complementary DNA for each of the calmodulin genes, OsCam1, OsCam2, and OsCam3 were sequenced
OsCam1-2|OsCam1	OsCam2	Calcium signaling-mediated and differential induction of calmodulin gene expression by stress in Oryza sativa L	 OsCam1 and OsCam2 encode a conventional 148-amino acid calmodulin protein that contains four characteristic Ca(2+)-binding motifs
