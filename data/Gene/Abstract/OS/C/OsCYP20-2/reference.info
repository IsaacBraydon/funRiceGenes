NA	The rice thylakoid lumenal cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 confers enhanced environmental stress tolerance in tobacco and Arabidopsis	2012	Plant Cell Rep	Plant Systems Engineering Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Daejeon, 305-806, Korea.	The role that the putative thylakoid lumenal cyclophilin (CYP) CYP20-2 locates in the thylakoid, and whether CYP20-2 is an essential gene, have not yet been elucidated. Here, we show that CYP20-2 is well conserved in several photosynthetic plants and that the transcript level of the rice OsCYP20-2 gene is highly regulated under abiotic stress. We found that ectopic expression of rice OsCYP20-2 in both tobacco and Arabidopsis confers enhanced tolerance to osmotic stress and extremely high light. Based on these results, we suggest that although the exact biochemical function of OsCYP20-2 in the thylakoid lumen (TL) remains unclear, it may be involved in photosynthetic acclimation to help plants cope with environmental stress; the OsCYP20-2 gene may be a candidate for enhancing multiple abiotic stress tolerance.
NA	Cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 with a novel variant integrates defense and cell elongation for chilling response in rice.	2019	New Phytol	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China.	Coordinating the stress defense and plant growth is a survival strategy to adaptation of environment, which contains a serial of processes, such as, cell growth, division and differentiation. However, little is known the coordination mechanism at protein conformation change. A cypclophilin OsCYP20-2 with a variant interacts with SLR1 and OsFSD2 in nucleus and chloroplast respectively to integrate chilling tolerance and cell elongation. Here, we reported a cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 was shown to function in stress response and cell elongation. Mass spectrum assay showed OsNuCYP20-2 (nuclear located OsCYP20-2) localized at nucleus was a new variant truncated 71 amino-acid residues in N-terminal. The loss-of function OsCYP20-2 mutant showed sensitive to chilling stress with accumulation extra ROS during chilling stress. In chloroplast, the full-length OsCYP20-2 promotes OsFSD2 forming homodimer and enhances its activity, which eliminates the accumulation of ROS under chilling stress. On the other hand, the mutant showed a shorter length in epidermal cells comparing with wild type Hwayoung (HY). In nucleus, OsCYP20-2 made conformation change of SLR1 to promote its degradation for cell elongation. Our data reveals a cyclophilin with a variant was a dual-localization in chloroplast and nucleus, which mediated chilling tolerance and cell elongation.
