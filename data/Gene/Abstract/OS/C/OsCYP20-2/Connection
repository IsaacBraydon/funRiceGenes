OsCYP20-2	SLR1|OsGAI|OsSLR1	Cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 with a novel variant integrates defense and cell elongation for chilling response in rice.	 A cypclophilin OsCYP20-2 with a variant interacts with SLR1 and OsFSD2 in nucleus and chloroplast respectively to integrate chilling tolerance and cell elongation
OsCYP20-2	SLR1|OsGAI|OsSLR1	Cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 with a novel variant integrates defense and cell elongation for chilling response in rice.	 In nucleus, OsCYP20-2 made conformation change of SLR1 to promote its degradation for cell elongation
OsCYP20-2	OsSYF2	A Cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 Interacts with OsSYF2 to Regulate Grain Length by Pre-mRNA Splicing.	A Cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 Interacts with OsSYF2 to Regulate Grain Length by Pre-mRNA Splicing.
OsCYP20-2	OsSYF2	A Cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 Interacts with OsSYF2 to Regulate Grain Length by Pre-mRNA Splicing.	 Through yeast two-hybrid screening and pull-down assays, OsSYF2, a pre-mRNA splicing factor, was identified as an interacting protein of OsCYP20-2
OsCYP20-2	OsSYF2	A Cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 Interacts with OsSYF2 to Regulate Grain Length by Pre-mRNA Splicing.	 CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, OsSYF2, an interacting protein of OsCYP20-2, controls grain length and panicle architecture by regulating the alternative splicing of pre-mRNA involved in cell elongation and sugar metabolism
