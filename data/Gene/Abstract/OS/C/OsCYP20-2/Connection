OsCYP20-2	SLR1|OsGAI	Cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 with a novel variant integrates defense and cell elongation for chilling response in rice.	 A cypclophilin OsCYP20-2 with a variant interacts with SLR1 and OsFSD2 in nucleus and chloroplast respectively to integrate chilling tolerance and cell elongation
OsCYP20-2	SLR1|OsGAI	Cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 with a novel variant integrates defense and cell elongation for chilling response in rice.	 In nucleus, OsCYP20-2 made conformation change of SLR1 to promote its degradation for cell elongation
