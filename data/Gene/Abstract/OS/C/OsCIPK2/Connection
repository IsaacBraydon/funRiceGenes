OsCIPK2	Rc|qSD7-1|qPC7	Exploring the Potential of Overexpressed OsCIPK2 Rice as a Nitrogen Utilization Efficient Crop and Analysis of Its Associated Rhizo-Compartmental Microbial Communities.	 Two isogenic lines Kitaake (WT) and its genetically modified line CIPK2 (RC), overexpressing the gene for Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase 2 (OsCIPK2) with better nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), were compared for their growth and development under low versus normal levels of N
