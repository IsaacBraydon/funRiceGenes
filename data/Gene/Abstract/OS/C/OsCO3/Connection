Hd1	OsCO3	OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice	The circadian expression pattern of OsCO3 mRNA oscillated in a different phase from Hd1 and was similar to that of OsCO3 pre-mRNA, suggesting that the diurnal expression pattern of OsCO3 transcripts may be regulated at the transcriptional level
Hd3a	OsCO3	OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice	Our results suggest that OsCO3 primarily controls flowering time under SD conditions by negatively regulating Hd3a and FTL expression, independent of the SD-promotion pathway
DTH2|OsCOL9|OsCCT08	OsCO3	Double Mutation of Days to Heading 2 and CONSTANS 3 Improves Agronomic Performance of Japonica Rice under Short Daylight Conditions in Southern China.	 We found that the double mutant of Days to heading 2 (DTH2) and CONSTANS 3 (OsCO3) (dth2-osco3), two CONSTANS-like (COL) genes, showed significantly delayed heading under both short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions in Guangzhou and manifested great yield increase under SD conditions
DTH2|OsCOL9|OsCCT08	OsCO3	Double Mutation of Days to Heading 2 and CONSTANS 3 Improves Agronomic Performance of Japonica Rice under Short Daylight Conditions in Southern China.	 The editing of the COL genes DTH2 and OsCO3 greatly improves the agronomic performance of japonica rice in Southern China
