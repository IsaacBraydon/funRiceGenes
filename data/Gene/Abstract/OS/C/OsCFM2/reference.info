The chloroplast RNA splicing and ribosome maturation (CRM) domain-containing proteins regulate the expression of chloroplast or mitochondrial genes that influence plant growth and development. Although 14 CRM domain proteins have previously been identified in rice, there are few studies of these gene expression patterns in various tissues and under abiotic stress. In our study, we found that 14 CRM domain-containing proteins have a conservative motif1. Under salt stress, the expression levels of 14 CRM genes were downregulated. However, under drought and cold stress, the expression level of some CRM genes was increased. The analysis of gene expression patterns showed that 14 CRM genes were expressed in all tissues but especially highly expressed in leaves. In addition, we analyzed the functions of OsCFM2 and found that this protein influences chloroplast development by regulating the splicing of a group I and five group II introns. Our study provides information for the function analysis of CRM domain-containing proteins in rice.
