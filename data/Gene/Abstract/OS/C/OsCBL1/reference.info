NA	The Os-AKT1 Channel Is Critical for K+ Uptake in Rice Roots and Is Modulated by the Rice CBL1-CIPK23 Complex	2014	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Biological Sciences, National Plant Gene Research Centre (Beijing), China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.	Potassium (K+) is one of the essential nutrient elements for plant growth and development. Plants absorb K+ ions from the environment via root cell K+ channels and/or transporters. In this study, the Shaker K+ channel Os-AKT1 was characterized for its function in K+ uptake in rice (Oryza sativa) roots, and its regulation by Os-CBL1 (Calcineurin B-Like protein1) and Os-CIPK23 (CBL-Interacting Protein Kinase23) was investigated. As an inward K+ channel, Os-AKT1 could carry out K+ uptake and rescue the low-K+-sensitive phenotype of Arabidopsis thaliana akt1 mutant plants. Rice Os-akt1 mutant plants showed decreased K+ uptake and displayed an obvious low-K+-sensitive phenotype. Disruption of Os-AKT1 significantly reduced the K+ content, which resulted in inhibition of plant growth and development. Similar to the AKT1 regulation in Arabidopsis, Os-CBL1 and Os-CIPK23 were identified as the upstream regulators of Os-AKT1 in rice. The Os-CBL1-Os-CIPK23 complex could enhance Os-AKT1-mediated K+ uptake. A phenotype test confirmed that Os-CIPK23 RNAi lines exhibited similar K+-deficient symptoms as the Os-akt1 mutant under low K+ conditions. These findings demonstrate that Os-AKT1-mediated K+ uptake in rice roots is modulated by the Os-CBL1-Os-CIPK23 complex.
NA	The calcium sensor OsCBL1 modulates nitrate signaling to regulate seedling growth in rice.	2019	PLoS One	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, P. R. China.	Nitrate signaling integrates and coordinates gene expression and plant growth; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Our previous study revealed that rice calcineurin B-like protein 1 (OsCBL1) modulates lateral root elongation by affecting auxin biosynthesis. Here, we report that OsCBL1 also modulates nitrate signaling to regulate rice seedlings growth. Compared with wild-type seedlings, seedlings of OsCBL1-knockdown (OsCBL1-KD) plants showed a suppressed growth phenotype, which included reduced root and shoot fresh weights and shorter radicles, crown roots, and lateral roots, when grown in nitrogen-free conditions. Although the growth defects of OsCBL1-KD plants could be partially rescued by the addition of nitrate to the growth conditions, the nitrate uptake capability of the OsCBL1-KD plants did not differ from that of wild-type plants as assessed via nitrate content and 15NO3- influx experiments. The nitrate-regulated expression of nitrate signal sentinel genes (OsNRT2.1 and OsNRT2.2) was affected in the OsCBL1-KD plants under both long- and short-term nitrate treatments. Overall, our results showed a novel role for OsCBL1 in the regulation of nitrate signaling and nitrate-mediated rice growth.
