OsCBK	anther	Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice	OsCBK is highly expressed in zones of cell division and it is particularly abundant in sporogenous cells of the anther at meiosis
OsCBK	growth	Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice	In situ hybridization showed that OsCBK is expressed in reproductive and vegetative tissues of rice and shows temporal and spatial changes during plant growth and development
OsCBK	meiosis	Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice	OsCBK is highly expressed in zones of cell division and it is particularly abundant in sporogenous cells of the anther at meiosis
OsCBK	vegetative	Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice	In situ hybridization showed that OsCBK is expressed in reproductive and vegetative tissues of rice and shows temporal and spatial changes during plant growth and development
OsCBK	reproductive	Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice	In situ hybridization showed that OsCBK is expressed in reproductive and vegetative tissues of rice and shows temporal and spatial changes during plant growth and development
OsCBK	cell division	Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice	OsCBK is highly expressed in zones of cell division and it is particularly abundant in sporogenous cells of the anther at meiosis
