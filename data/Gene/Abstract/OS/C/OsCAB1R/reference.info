Using transgenic rice seedlings expressing a firefly luciferase (luc) gene under the control of a rice CAB (chlorophyll a/b binding protein) promoter, we demonstrated how light affects circadian clocks in the transcription of the CAB gene. Rhythmic luc expression was observed for more than 5 d under constant light and dark (DD) conditions after light/dark entrainment. After a light pulse was applied at different time points in DD various temporal patterns of CAB gene expression were individually observed. We first examined two distinct properties related to the entrainment mechanism of the circadian clock: fluence-rate dependence of free-running periods (FRPs) and phase resetting by a light pulse. Although fluence-rate dependent shortening of FRP was demonstrated, the FRP in DD was almost equal to that in constant light of a middle fluence-rate, indicating that this fluence-rate dependence may not fully describe the entrainment of the circadian clock in rice. Typical phase responses of the circadian clock by a single light pulse were also observed at the transcriptional level in rice seedlings. Thus, the phase resettings upon the light/dark transitions of daily cycles may be sufficient to explain the entrainment mechanisms of rice. We have further demonstrated that, in addition to having a gating effect to acute response, a light pulse can activate the circadian clock-controlled CAB1R gene expression at the first circadian peak in a phase-dependent manner. This suggests that light activates circadian clock activity in the diurnal CAB gene expression under daily light/dark cycles.
