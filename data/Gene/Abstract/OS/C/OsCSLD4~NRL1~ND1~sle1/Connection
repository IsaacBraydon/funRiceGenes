Furthermore, MT applied exogenously down-regulated the transcription level of Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein 1 (OsNRAMP1), OsNRAMP5, a major facilitator superfamily gene (OsCd1), and IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER 1 (OsIRT1), all of which were responsible for Cd intake, thus less Cd was entered into roots
