NA	Inducible Enrichment of Osa-miR1432 Confers Rice Bacterial Blight Resistance through Suppressing OsCaML2.	2021	Int J Mol Sci	Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) handle immune response to pathogens by adjusting the function of target genes in plants. However, the experimentally documented miRNA/target modules implicated in the interplay between rice and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) are still in the early stages. Herein, the expression of osa-miR1432 was induced in resistant genotype IRBB5, but not susceptible genotype IR24, under Xoo strain PXO86 attack. Overexpressed osa-miR1432 heightened rice disease resistance to Xoo, indicated by enhancive enrichment of defense marker genes, raised reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, repressed bacterial growth and shortened leaf lesion length, whilst the disruptive accumulation of osa-miR1432 accelerated rice susceptibility to Xoo infection. Noticeably, OsCaML2 (LOC_Os03g59770) was experimentally confirmed as a target gene of osa-miR1432, and the overexpressing OsCaML2 transgenic plants exhibited compromised resistance to Xoo infestation. Our results indicate that osa-miR1432 and OsCaML2 were differently responsive to Xoo invasion at the transcriptional level and fine-tune rice resistance to Xoo infection, which may be referable in resistance gene discovery and valuable in the pursuit of improving Xoo resistance in rice breeding.
