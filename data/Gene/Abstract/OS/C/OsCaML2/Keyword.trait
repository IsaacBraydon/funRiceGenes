OsCaML2	resistance	Inducible Enrichment of Osa-miR1432 Confers Rice Bacterial Blight Resistance through Suppressing OsCaML2.	 Noticeably, OsCaML2 (LOC_Os03g59770) was experimentally confirmed as a target gene of osa-miR1432, and the overexpressing OsCaML2 transgenic plants exhibited compromised resistance to Xoo infestation
OsCaML2	resistance	Inducible Enrichment of Osa-miR1432 Confers Rice Bacterial Blight Resistance through Suppressing OsCaML2.	 Our results indicate that osa-miR1432 and OsCaML2 were differently responsive to Xoo invasion at the transcriptional level and fine-tune rice resistance to Xoo infection, which may be referable in resistance gene discovery and valuable in the pursuit of improving Xoo resistance in rice breeding
OsCaML2	breeding	Inducible Enrichment of Osa-miR1432 Confers Rice Bacterial Blight Resistance through Suppressing OsCaML2.
