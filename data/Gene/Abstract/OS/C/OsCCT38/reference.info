NA	Global analysis of CCT family knockout mutants identifies four genes involved in regulating heading date in rice	2020	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Many genes encoding CCT domain-containing proteins regulate flowering time. In rice (Oryza sativa), 41 such genes have been identified, but only a few have been shown to regulate heading date. Here, to test whether and how additional CCT family genes regulate heading date in rice, we classified these genes into five groups based on their diurnal expression patterns. The expression patterns of genes in the same subfamily or in close phylogenetic clades tended to be similar. We generated knockout mutants of the entire gene family via CRISPR/Cas9. The heading dates of knockout mutants of only 4 of 14 genes previously shown to regulate heading date were altered, pointing to functional redundancy of CCT family genes in regulating this trait. Analysis of mutants of four other genes showed that OsCCT22, OsCCT38, and OsCCT41 suppress heading under long-day conditions and promote heading under short-day conditions. OsCCT03 promotes heading under both conditions and upregulates the expression of Hd1 and Ehd1, a phenomenon not previously reported for other such genes. To date, at least 18 CCT domain-containing genes involved in regulating heading have been identified, providing diverse, flexible gene combinations for generating rice varieties with a given heading date.
NA	Clock component OsPRR73 positively regulates rice salt tolerance by modulating OsHKT2;1-mediated sodium homeostasis	2020	EMBO J	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	The roles of clock components in salt stress tolerance remain incompletely characterized in rice. Here, we show that, among OsPRR (Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator) family members, OsPRR73 specifically confers salt tolerance in rice. Notably, the grain size and yield of osprr73 null mutants were significantly decreased in the presence of salt stress, with accumulated higher level of reactive oxygen species and sodium ions. RNA sequencing and biochemical assays identified OsHKT2;1, encoding a plasma membrane-localized Na+ transporter, as a transcriptional target of OsPRR73 in mediating salt tolerance. Correspondingly, null mutants of OsHKT2;1 displayed an increased tolerance to salt stress. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays further identified HDAC10 as nuclear interactor of OsPRR73 and co-repressor of OsHKT2;1. Consistently, H3K9ac histone marks at OsHKT2;1 promoter regions were significantly reduced in osprr73 mutant. Together, our findings reveal that salt-induced OsPRR73 expression confers salt tolerance by recruiting HDAC10 to transcriptionally repress OsHKT2;1, thus reducing cellular Na+ accumulation. This exemplifies a new molecular link between clock components and salt stress tolerance in rice.
