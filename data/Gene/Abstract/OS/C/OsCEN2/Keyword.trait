OsCEN2	spikelet	Florigen repression complexes involving rice CENTRORADIALIS2 regulate grain size.	 OsCEN2 influenced grain size by restricting cell expansion in the spikelet hull and seed filling
OsCEN2	grain	Florigen repression complexes involving rice CENTRORADIALIS2 regulate grain size.	 Here, we report that the rice CENTRORADIALIS (CEN) family member OsCEN2 (also known as Rice TFL1/CEN homolog, RCN1), a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) family protein, negatively controls grain size in rice
