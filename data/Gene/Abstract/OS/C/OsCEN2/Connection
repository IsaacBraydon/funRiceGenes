GF14f|OsGF14f	OsCEN2	Florigen repression complexes involving rice CENTRORADIALIS2 regulate grain size.	 In in vivo and in vitro experiments, OsCEN2 physically interacted with a G-box factor 14-3-3 homolog, GF14f, which negatively regulates grain size
OsCEN2	Rcn1|OsABCG5	Florigen repression complexes involving rice CENTRORADIALIS2 regulate grain size.	 Here, we report that the rice CENTRORADIALIS (CEN) family member OsCEN2 (also known as Rice TFL1/CEN homolog, RCN1), a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) family protein, negatively controls grain size in rice
OsCEN2	OsFD2	Florigen repression complexes involving rice CENTRORADIALIS2 regulate grain size	Our results reveal the molecular mechanisms of the OsCEN2-GF14f-OsFD2 regulatory module in controlling grain size.
