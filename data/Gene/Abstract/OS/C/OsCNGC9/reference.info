NA	A cyclic nucleotide-gated channel mediates cytoplasmic calcium elevation and disease resistance in rice.	2019	Cell Res	National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	The transient elevation of cytoplasmic calcium is essential for pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI). However, the calcium channels responsible for this process have remained unknown. Here, we show that rice CDS1 (CELL DEATH and SUSCEPTIBLE to BLAST 1) encoding OsCNGC9, a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel protein, positively regulates the resistance to rice blast disease. We show that OsCNGC9 mediates PAMP-induced Ca2+ influx and that this event is critical for PAMPs-triggered ROS burst and induction of PTI-related defense gene expression. We further show that a PTI-related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK185 physically interacts with and phosphorylates OsCNGC9 to activate its channel activity. Our results suggest a signaling cascade linking pattern recognition to calcium channel activation, which is required for initiation of PTI and disease resistance in rice.
