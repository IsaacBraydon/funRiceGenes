CDS1|OsCNGC9	OsRLCK185	A cyclic nucleotide-gated channel mediates cytoplasmic calcium elevation and disease resistance in rice.	 We further show that a PTI-related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK185 physically interacts with and phosphorylates OsCNGC9 to activate its channel activity
CDS1|OsCNGC9	OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice	 In addition, transcription of OsCNGC9 is activated by a rice dehydration responsive element binding transcription factor, OsDREB1A
CDS1|OsCNGC9	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice	 Mechanistically, we showed that in response to chilling stress, OsSAPK8, a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana OST1, phosphorylates and activates OsCNGC9 to trigger Ca2+ influx
