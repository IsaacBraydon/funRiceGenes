OsCNGC9	defense	A cyclic nucleotide-gated channel mediates cytoplasmic calcium elevation and disease resistance in rice.	 We show that OsCNGC9 mediates PAMP-induced Ca2+ influx and that this event is critical for PAMPs-triggered ROS burst and induction of PTI-related defense gene expression
OsCNGC9	Kinase	A cyclic nucleotide-gated channel mediates cytoplasmic calcium elevation and disease resistance in rice.	 We further show that a PTI-related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK185 physically interacts with and phosphorylates OsCNGC9 to activate its channel activity
