CDS1|OsCNGC9	defense	A cyclic nucleotide-gated channel mediates cytoplasmic calcium elevation and disease resistance in rice.	 We show that OsCNGC9 mediates PAMP-induced Ca2+ influx and that this event is critical for PAMPs-triggered ROS burst and induction of PTI-related defense gene expression
CDS1|OsCNGC9	Kinase	A cyclic nucleotide-gated channel mediates cytoplasmic calcium elevation and disease resistance in rice.	 We further show that a PTI-related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK185 physically interacts with and phosphorylates OsCNGC9 to activate its channel activity
CDS1|OsCNGC9	transcription factor	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice	 In addition, transcription of OsCNGC9 is activated by a rice dehydration responsive element binding transcription factor, OsDREB1A
CDS1|OsCNGC9	tolerance	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice
CDS1|OsCNGC9	tolerance	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice	 We showed that the loss-of-function mutant of OsCNGC9 is defective in cold-induced calcium influx and more sensitive to prolonged cold treatment while OsCNGC9 overexpression confers enhanced cold tolerance
CDS1|OsCNGC9	tolerance	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice	 Together, our results suggested that OsCNGC9 enhances chilling tolerance in rice through regulating cold-induced calcium influx and cytoplasmic calcium elevation
CDS1|OsCNGC9	cold tolerance	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice	 We showed that the loss-of-function mutant of OsCNGC9 is defective in cold-induced calcium influx and more sensitive to prolonged cold treatment while OsCNGC9 overexpression confers enhanced cold tolerance
CDS1|OsCNGC9	chilling	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice
CDS1|OsCNGC9	chilling	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice	 Mechanistically, we showed that in response to chilling stress, OsSAPK8, a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana OST1, phosphorylates and activates OsCNGC9 to trigger Ca2+ influx
CDS1|OsCNGC9	chilling	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice	 Together, our results suggested that OsCNGC9 enhances chilling tolerance in rice through regulating cold-induced calcium influx and cytoplasmic calcium elevation
CDS1|OsCNGC9	calcium	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice	 We showed that the loss-of-function mutant of OsCNGC9 is defective in cold-induced calcium influx and more sensitive to prolonged cold treatment while OsCNGC9 overexpression confers enhanced cold tolerance
CDS1|OsCNGC9	calcium	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice	 Together, our results suggested that OsCNGC9 enhances chilling tolerance in rice through regulating cold-induced calcium influx and cytoplasmic calcium elevation
CDS1|OsCNGC9	cold	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice	 We showed that the loss-of-function mutant of OsCNGC9 is defective in cold-induced calcium influx and more sensitive to prolonged cold treatment while OsCNGC9 overexpression confers enhanced cold tolerance
CDS1|OsCNGC9	chilling stress	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice	 Mechanistically, we showed that in response to chilling stress, OsSAPK8, a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana OST1, phosphorylates and activates OsCNGC9 to trigger Ca2+ influx
