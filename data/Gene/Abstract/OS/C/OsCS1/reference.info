NA	One novel mitochondrial citrate synthase from Oryza sativa L. can enhance aluminum tolerance in transgenic tobacco.	2009	Mol Biotechnol	Institute of Genetics, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, China.	Rice exhibits the greatest aluminum (Al) tolerance compared with other cereals such as wheat, barley, maize, etc. A full-length gene, OsCS1, encoding citrate synthase, which is highly induced by aluminum toxicity in rice (Oryza sativa L.), was isolated. Sequence analysis and the sub-cellular localization of OsCS1 in yeast revealed that it is a mitochondrial citrate synthase. OsCS1 was induced by Al toxicity. Several independent transgenic tobacco lines expressing OsCS 1 exhibited increased citrate efflux and extraordinary Al tolerance. Possible outlook for OsCS1 to be applied to enhance plant tolerance to Al toxicity was also discussed.
