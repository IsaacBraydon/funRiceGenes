OsCNGC13	growth	OsCNGC13 promotes seed-setting rate by facilitating pollen tube growth in stylar tissues.	OsCNGC13 promotes seed-setting rate by facilitating pollen tube growth in stylar tissues.
OsCNGC13	pollen	OsCNGC13 promotes seed-setting rate by facilitating pollen tube growth in stylar tissues.	OsCNGC13 promotes seed-setting rate by facilitating pollen tube growth in stylar tissues.
OsCNGC13	pollen	OsCNGC13 promotes seed-setting rate by facilitating pollen tube growth in stylar tissues.	 Based on these results, we propose that OsCNGC13 acts as a novel maternal sporophytic factor required for stylar [Ca2+]cyt accumulation, ECM components modification and STT cell death, thus facilitating the penetration of pollen tube in the style for successful double fertilization and seed-setting in rice

OsCNGC13	calcium	OsCNGC13 promotes seed-setting rate by facilitating pollen tube growth in stylar tissues.	 We show that OsCNGC13 is permeable to Ca2+ Consistent with this, accumulation of cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) is defective in the sss1-D mutant style after pollination
