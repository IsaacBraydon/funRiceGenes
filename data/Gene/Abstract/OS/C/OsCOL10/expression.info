OsCOL10	 Further studies show that OsCOL10 represses the expression of the FT-like genes RFT1 and Hd3a through Ehd1
OsCOL10	 Through transgenic analysis, we have showed that OsCOL10 repress flowering by reducing expression of the FT-like genes RFT1 and Hd3a through Ehd1 |  Moreover, we also showed that OsCOL10 acts downstream of Ghd7, a key LD-specific flowering repressor by reducing expression of Ehd1
