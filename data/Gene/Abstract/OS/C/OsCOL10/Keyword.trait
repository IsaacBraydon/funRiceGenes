OsCOL10	leaf	OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.	OsCOL10 is affected by the circadian clock and preferentially expressed in leaf mesophyll cells; it is localized to the nucleus and has transcriptional activation activity
OsCOL10	nucleus	OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.	OsCOL10 is affected by the circadian clock and preferentially expressed in leaf mesophyll cells; it is localized to the nucleus and has transcriptional activation activity
OsCOL10	flowering time	OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.	Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsCOL10 (driven by a strong promoter or by fusing it to the activation domain of VP64) showed delayed flowering time under both short and long days
