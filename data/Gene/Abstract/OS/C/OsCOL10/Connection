Ehd1	OsCOL10	OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.	 Further studies show that OsCOL10 represses the expression of the FT-like genes RFT1 and Hd3a through Ehd1
Ehd1	OsCOL10	OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.	 Together, we conclude that OsCOL10 functions as a flowering-time repressor that links between Ghd7 and Ehd1 in rice
Ghd7	OsCOL10	OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.	OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.
Ghd7	OsCOL10	OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.	 Transcripts of OsCOL10 are more abundant in the plants carrying a functional Ghd7 allele or over-expressing Ghd7 than in the Ghd7-deficient ones, thus placing OsCOL10 downstream of Ghd7
Ghd7	OsCOL10	OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.	 Together, we conclude that OsCOL10 functions as a flowering-time repressor that links between Ghd7 and Ehd1 in rice
Hd3a	OsCOL10	OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.	 Further studies show that OsCOL10 represses the expression of the FT-like genes RFT1 and Hd3a through Ehd1
