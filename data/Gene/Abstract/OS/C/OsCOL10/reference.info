NA	OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, P.R.

Flowering time, or heading date, is a critical agronomic trait that determines the cropping season and regional adaptability, and ultimately grain yield in rice. A number of genes involved in photoperiodic flowering of have been cloned and their roles in modulating expression of the flowering genes have been characterized to a certain extent. However, much less is known about the pathway in transmitting the day length response signal(s) to induce transition to reproductive growth. Here, we report a constitutive flowering repressor OsCOL10, which encodes a member of the CONSTANS-like (COL) family. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsCOL10 (driven by a strong promoter or by fusing it to the activation domain of VP64) showed delayed flowering time under both short and long days. OsCOL10 is affected by the circadian clock and preferentially expressed in leaf mesophyll cells; it is localized to the nucleus and has transcriptional activation activity. Further studies show that OsCOL10 represses the expression of the FT-like genes RFT1 and Hd3a through Ehd1. Transcripts of OsCOL10 are more abundant in the plants carrying a functional Ghd7 allele or over-expressing Ghd7 than in the Ghd7-deficient ones, thus placing OsCOL10 downstream of Ghd7. Together, we conclude that OsCOL10 functions as a flowering-time repressor that links between Ghd7 and Ehd1 in rice.
NA	Flowering time regulation by the CONSTANS-Like gene OsCOL10.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	a National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences , Beijing , P.R. China.	Plant flowering at the appropriate time is critical for reproductive success and influenced by a series of environmental factors such as photoperiod and temperature. A number of genes involved in photoperiodic flowering of have been cloned and their roles in modulating expression of the flowering genes have been characterized to a certain extent. However, much less is known about the pathway in transmitting the day length response signal(s) to induce transition to reproductive growth. Recently, we characterized a constitutive flowering repressor OsCOL10 encoding for a member of the CONSTANS-like (COL) family. Through transgenic analysis, we have showed that OsCOL10 repress flowering by reducing expression of the FT-like genes RFT1 and Hd3a through Ehd1. Moreover, we also showed that OsCOL10 acts downstream of Ghd7, a key LD-specific flowering repressor by reducing expression of Ehd1. Collectively, our finding identifies OsCOL10 functioning as a flowering-time repressor that links between Ghd7 and Ehd1 in rice.
NA	Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant. In addition to serving as a model plant for molecular genetic studies of monocots, rice is a staple crop for about half of the world population. Heading date is a critical agronomic trait, and many genes controlling heading date have been cloned during the last two decades. The mechanism of flowering in rice from recognition of day length by leaves to floral activation in the shoot apical meristem has been extensively studied. In this review, we summarize current progress on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice with emphasis on post-translational modifications of key regulators, including Heading Date 1 (Hd1), Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Grain Number, Plant Height, and Heading Date7 (Ghd7). The contribution of heading date genes to heterosis and the expansion of rice cultivation areas from low-latitude to high-latitude regions are also discussed. To overcome limitations of diverse genetic backgrounds used in heading date studies and to gain a clearer understanding of flowering in rice, we propose a systematic collection of genetic resources in a common genetic background. Strategies in breeding adapted cultivars by rational design are also discussed.
