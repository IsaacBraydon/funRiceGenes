Flowering time, or heading date, is a critical agronomic trait that determines the cropping season and regional adaptability, and ultimately grain yield in rice. A number of genes involved in photoperiodic flowering of have been cloned and their roles in modulating expression of the flowering genes have been characterized to a certain extent. However, much less is known about the pathway in transmitting the day length response signal(s) to induce transition to reproductive growth. Here, we report a constitutive flowering repressor OsCOL10, which encodes a member of the CONSTANS-like (COL) family. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsCOL10 (driven by a strong promoter or by fusing it to the activation domain of VP64) showed delayed flowering time under both short and long days. OsCOL10 is affected by the circadian clock and preferentially expressed in leaf mesophyll cells; it is localized to the nucleus and has transcriptional activation activity. Further studies show that OsCOL10 represses the expression of the FT-like genes RFT1 and Hd3a through Ehd1. Transcripts of OsCOL10 are more abundant in the plants carrying a functional Ghd7 allele or over-expressing Ghd7 than in the Ghd7-deficient ones, thus placing OsCOL10 downstream of Ghd7. Together, we conclude that OsCOL10 functions as a flowering-time repressor that links between Ghd7 and Ehd1 in rice.
