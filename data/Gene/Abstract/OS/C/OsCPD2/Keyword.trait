OsCPD2	leaf	OsCPD1 and OsCPD2 are functional brassinosteroid biosynthesis genes in rice.	 Moreover, overexpression of OsCPD1 and OsCPD2 led to a typical BR enhanced phenotype, with enlarged leaf angle and increased grain size
OsCPD2	growth	OsCPD1 and OsCPD2 are functional brassinosteroid biosynthesis genes in rice.	 The overall growth and development of oscpd1 and oscpd2 single knock-out mutants was indistinguishable from the wild-type, whereas, the oscpd1 oscpd2 double mutant displayed multiple and obvious BR-related defects
