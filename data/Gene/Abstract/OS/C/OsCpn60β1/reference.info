NA	OsCpn60¦Â1 is Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2020	Int J Mol Sci.

The chaperonin 60 (Cpn60) protein is of great importance to plants due to its involvement in modulating the folding of numerous chloroplast protein polypeptides. In chloroplasts, Cpn60 is differentiated into two subunit types-Cpn60¦Á and Cpn60¦Â and the rice genome encodes three ¦Á and three ¦Â plastid chaperonin subunits. However, the functions of Cpn60 family members in rice were poorly understood. In order to investigate the molecular mechanism of OsCpn60¦Â1, we attempted to disrupt the OsCpn60¦Â1 gene by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis in this study. We succeeded in the production of homozygous OsCpn60¦Â1 knockout rice plants. The OsCpn60¦Â1 mutant displayed a striking albino leaf phenotype and was seedling lethal. Electron microscopy observation demonstrated that chloroplasts were severely disrupted in the OsCpn60¦Â1 mutant. In addition, OsCpn60¦Â1 was located in the chloroplast and OsCpn60¦Â1 is constitutively expressed in various tissues particularly in the green tissues. The label-free qualitative proteomics showed that photosynthesis-related pathways and ribosomal pathways were significantly inhibited in OsCpn60¦Â1 mutants. These results indicate that OsCpn60¦Â1 is essential for chloroplast development in rice.
