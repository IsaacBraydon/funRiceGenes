OsCCR10	OsNAC5	Transcriptional activation of rice CINNAMOYL-CoA REDUCTASE 10 by OsNAC5, contributes to drought tolerance by modulating lignin accumulation in roots.	 Here, we report that the rice (Oryza sativa) gene CINNAMOYL-CoA REDUCTASE 10 (OsCCR10) is directly activated by the OsNAC5 transcription factor, which mediates drought tolerance through regulating lignin accumulation
OsCCR10	OsNAC055	Transcription factor OsNAC055 regulates GA-mediated lignin biosynthesis in rice straw.	 Further ChIP-qPCR analysis and transient transactivation assays indicated that OsNAC055 directly activates rice lignin biosynthetic genes CINNAMOYL-CoA REDUCTASE 10 (OsCCR10) and CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE 2 (OsCAD2) by binding to their promoters
