Mi-2 protein, the central component of the NuRD nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase complex, plays a role in transcriptional repression in animals. Mi-2-like genes have been reported in Arabidopsis, though their function in monocots remains largely unknown. In the present study, a rice Mi-2-like gene, OsCHR4 (Oryza sativa Chromatin Remodeling 4, LOC_Os07g03450), was cloned from a rice mutant with adaxial albino leaves. The Oschr4 mutant exhibited defective chloroplasts in adaxial mesophyll, but not in abaxial mesophyll. Ultrastructural observations indicated that proplastid growth and/or thylakoid membrane formation in adaxial mesophyll cells was blocked in the Oschr4 mutant. Subcellular localization revealed that OsCHR4::GFP fusion protein was targeted to the nuclei. OsCHR4 was mainly expressed in the root meristem, flower, vascular bundle, and mesophyll cells by promoter::GUS analysis in transgenic rice. The transcripts of some nuclear- and plastid-encoded genes required for early chloroplast development and photosynthesis were decreased in the adaxial albino mesophyll of the Oschr4 mutant. These observations provide evidence that OsCHR4, the rice Mi-2-like protein, plays an important role in early chloroplast development in adaxial mesophyll cells. The results increase our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying tissue-specific chloroplast development in plants.
NA	Mutations in the Rice OsCHR4 Gene, Encoding a CHD3 Family Chromatin Remodeler, Induce Narrow and Rolled Leaves with Increased Cuticular Wax.	2019	Int J Mol Sci	Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Phytohormones, Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Crop Germplasm Innovation and Utilization, College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha 410128, China. guoting0118@126.com.	Leaf blade width, curvature, and cuticular wax are important agronomic traits of rice. Here, we report the rice Oschr4-5 mutant characterized by pleiotropic phenotypes, including narrow and rolled leaves, enhanced cuticular wax deposition and reduced plant height and tiller number. The reduced leaf width is caused by a reduced number of longitudinal veins and increased auxin content. The cuticular wax content was significantly higher in the Oschr4-5 mutant, resulting in reduced water loss rate and enhanced drought tolerance. Molecular characterization reveals that a single-base deletion results in a frame-shift mutation from the second chromodomain of OsCHR4, a CHD3 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding) family chromatin remodeler, in the Oschr4-5 mutant. Expressions of seven wax biosynthesis genes (GL1-4, WSL4, OsCER7, LACS2, LACS7, ROC4 and BDG) and four auxin biosynthesis genes (YUC2, YUC3, YUC5 and YUC6) was up-regulated in the Oschr4-5 mutant. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the transcriptionally active histone modification H3K4me3 was increased, whereas the repressive H3K27me3 was reduced in the upregulated genes in the Oschr4-5 mutant. Therefore, OsCHR4 regulates leaf morphogenesis and cuticle wax formation by epigenetic modulation of auxin and wax biosynthetic genes expression.
NA	Characterization of dwarf and narrow leaf ( dnl-4) mutant in rice	2020	Plant Signal Behav	College of Life Science and Natural Resources, Dong-A University , Busan, Korea.	Height and leaf morphology are important agronomic traits of the major crop plant rice (Oryza sativa). In previous studies, the dwarf and narrow leaf genes (dnl1, dnl2 and dnl3) have identified in rice. Using the Ac/Ds knockout system, we found a new dwarf and narrow leaf (dnl) mutant and identified mutated gene. The dnl-4 mutant showed reduced plant height and leaf blade width compared to the wild type, and increased leaf inclination. The morphological defects of the mutant were caused by the suppressed expression of the DNL-4 gene, which encodes a pfkB carbohydrate kinase protein. These results suggest that DNL-4 expression is involved in modulating plant height and leaf growth. Furthermore, DNL-4 expression also affects productivity in rice: the dnl-4 mutant exhibited reduced panicle length and grain width compared with the wild type. To understand DNL-4 function in rice, we analyzed the expression levels of leaf growth-related genes, such as NAL1, NAL7, and CSLD4, in the dnl-4 mutant. Expression of NAL1 and NAL7 was downregulated in the dnl-4 mutant compared to the wild type. The observation that DNL-4 expression corresponded with that of NAL1 and NAL7 is consistent with the narrow leaf phenotype of the dnl-4 mutant. These results suggest that DNL-4 regulates plant height and leaf structure in rice.
