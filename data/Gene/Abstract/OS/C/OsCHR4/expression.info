OsCHR4	 Expressions of seven wax biosynthesis genes (GL1-4, WSL4, OsCER7, LACS2, LACS7, ROC4 and BDG) and four auxin biosynthesis genes (YUC2, YUC3, YUC5 and YUC6) was up-regulated in the Oschr4-5 mutant |  Therefore, OsCHR4 regulates leaf morphogenesis and cuticle wax formation by epigenetic modulation of auxin and wax biosynthetic genes expression
