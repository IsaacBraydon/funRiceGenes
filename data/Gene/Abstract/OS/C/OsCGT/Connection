CYP93G2|qST-6.1	OsCGT	CYP93G2 is a flavanone 2-hydroxylase required for C-glycosylflavone biosynthesis in rice	Coexpression of CYP93G2 and OsCGT in Arabidopsis resulted in the production of C-glucosyl-2-hydroxyflavanones in the dibenzoylmethane tautomeric form
CYP93G2|qST-6.1	OsCGT	CYP93G2 is a flavanone 2-hydroxylase required for C-glycosylflavone biosynthesis in rice	Thus, CYP93G2 generates 2-hydroxyflavanone substrates from flavanones for C-glucosylation by OsCGT in planta
