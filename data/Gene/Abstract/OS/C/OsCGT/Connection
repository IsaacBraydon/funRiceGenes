CYP93G2	OsCGT	CYP93G2 is a flavanone 2-hydroxylase required for C-glycosylflavone biosynthesis in rice	 Coexpression of CYP93G2 and OsCGT in Arabidopsis resulted in the production of C-glucosyl-2-hydroxyflavanones in the dibenzoylmethane tautomeric form| Thus, CYP93G2 generates 2-hydroxyflavanone substrates from flavanones for C-glucosylation by OsCGT in planta
