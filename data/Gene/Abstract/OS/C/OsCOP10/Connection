OsCOP10	OsDDB1	Mutations in OsDET1, OsCOP10, and OsDDB1 confer embryonic lethality and alter flavonoid accumulation in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) seed.	Mutations in OsDET1, OsCOP10, and OsDDB1 confer embryonic lethality and alter flavonoid accumulation in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) seed.
OsCOP10	OsDDB1	Mutations in OsDET1, OsCOP10, and OsDDB1 confer embryonic lethality and alter flavonoid accumulation in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) seed.	 Consistent with the fact that OsDET1 interacts with CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 10 (OsCOP10) and UV-DAMAGED DNA BINDING PROTEIN 1 (OsDDB1) to form the COP10-DET1-DDB1 (CDD), seeds of oscop10 and osddb1 knockout mutants also showed the yel phenotype
