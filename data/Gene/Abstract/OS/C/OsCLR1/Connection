HEI10	OsCLR1|DSNP1	The E3 ubiquitin ligase DESYNAPSIS1 regulates synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis.	 Accompanying the decreased foci of HEI10, ZIP4, and MER3 on meiotic chromosomes, the number of crossovers (COs) decreases dramatically in dsnp1 meiocytes
MER3|RCK	OsCLR1|DSNP1	The E3 ubiquitin ligase DESYNAPSIS1 regulates synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis.	 Accompanying the decreased foci of HEI10, ZIP4, and MER3 on meiotic chromosomes, the number of crossovers (COs) decreases dramatically in dsnp1 meiocytes
OsCLR1|DSNP1	Sc	The E3 ubiquitin ligase DESYNAPSIS1 regulates synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis.	 Here, we reveal that a functional RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, DESYNAPSIS1 (DSNP1), plays significant roles in SC assembly and homologous recombination during rice meiosis
OsCLR1|DSNP1	Sc	The E3 ubiquitin ligase DESYNAPSIS1 regulates synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis.	 Collectively, DSNP1 stabilizes the canonical tripartite SC structure along paired homologous chromosomes and further promotes the formation of COs
OsCLR1|DSNP1	ZIP4|SPO22	The E3 ubiquitin ligase DESYNAPSIS1 regulates synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis.	 Accompanying the decreased foci of HEI10, ZIP4, and MER3 on meiotic chromosomes, the number of crossovers (COs) decreases dramatically in dsnp1 meiocytes
