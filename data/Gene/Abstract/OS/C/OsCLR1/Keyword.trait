OsCLR1|DSNP1	drought	Molecular functions of rice cytosol-localized RING finger protein 1 in response to salt and drought and comparative analysis of its grass orthologs.	 These results indicate the positive regulation of OsCLR1 in response to salt and drought in an ABA-dependent manner

OsCLR1|DSNP1	meiotic	The E3 ubiquitin ligase DESYNAPSIS1 regulates synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis.	 Accompanying the decreased foci of HEI10, ZIP4, and MER3 on meiotic chromosomes, the number of crossovers (COs) decreases dramatically in dsnp1 meiocytes
