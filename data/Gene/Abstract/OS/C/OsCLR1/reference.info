NA	Molecular functions of rice cytosol-localized RING finger protein 1 in response to salt and drought and comparative analysis of its grass orthologs.	2019	Plant Cell Physiol	Plant Genomics Lab, Department of Bio-resources Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Republic of Korea.	In higher plants, the post-translational modification of target proteins via the attachment of molecules such as ubiquitin mediates a variety of cellular functions via the Ub/26S proteasome system. Here, a Really Interesting New Gene (RING)-H2 type E3 ligase, which regulates target proteins via the Ub/26S proteasome system, was isolated from a rice plant, and its other grass orthologs were examined to determine the evolution of its molecular function during speciation. The gene encoding Oryza sativa cytoplasmic-localized RING finger protein 1 (OsCLR1) was highly expressed under salt and drought stress. By contrast, the three grass orthologs, SbCLR1 from Sorghum bicolor, ZmCLR1 from Zea mays, and TaCLR1 from Triticum aestivum, showed different responses to these stresses. Despite these differences, all four orthologs exhibited E3 ligase activity with cytosol-targeted localization, demonstrating conserved molecular functions. Although OsCLR1-overexpressing plants showed higher survival rates under both salt and drought stress than the wild-type (WT), this pattern was not observed in the other orthologs. In addition, OsCLR1-overexpressing plants exhibited lower germination rates in ABA than WT, while the three ortholog CLR1-overexpressing plants showed rates similar to the WT. These results indicate the positive regulation of OsCLR1 in response to salt and drought in an ABA-dependent manner. Despite the molecular functions of the three CLR1 orthologs remaining largely unknown, our results provide an insight into the evolutionary fate of CLR1 grass orthologs during speciation after the divergence from a common ancestor.
NA	The E3 ubiquitin ligase DESYNAPSIS1 regulates synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis.	2021	Cell Rep	State Key Lab of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100101 Beijing, China; Oil Crops Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences/Key Laboratory of Biology and Genetic Improvement of Oil Crops, Ministry of Agriculture, Wuhan 430062, China.	Synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly and homologous recombination, the most critical events during prophase I, are the prerequisite for faithful meiotic chromosome segregation. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we reveal that a functional RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, DESYNAPSIS1 (DSNP1), plays significant roles in SC assembly and homologous recombination during rice meiosis. In the dsnp1 mutant, homologous synapsis is discontinuous and aberrant SC-like polycomplexes occur independent of coaligned homologous chromosomes. Accompanying the decreased foci of HEI10, ZIP4, and MER3 on meiotic chromosomes, the number of crossovers (COs) decreases dramatically in dsnp1 meiocytes. Furthermore, the absence of central elements largely restores the localization of non-ZEP1 ZMM proteins and the number of COs in the dsnp1 background. Collectively, DSNP1 stabilizes the canonical tripartite SC structure along paired homologous chromosomes and further promotes the formation of COs.
