OsCPK25	pollen	OIP30, a RuvB-like DNA helicase 2, is a potential substrate for the pollen-predominant OsCPK25/26 in rice	 Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we isolated OsCPK25/26-interacting protein 30 (OIP30), which is also predominantly expressed in pollen
OsCPK25	pollen	OIP30, a RuvB-like DNA helicase 2, is a potential substrate for the pollen-predominant OsCPK25/26 in rice	 OIP30 may be the potential downstream substrate for OsCPK25/26 in pollen
