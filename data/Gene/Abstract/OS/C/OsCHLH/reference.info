The OsCHLH rice mutant, which lacks chlorophyll in the thylakoids, was isolated by T-DNA gene trapping (Jung, K.-H., Hur, J., Ryu, C.-H., Choi, Y., Chung, Y.-Y., Miyao, A., Hirochika, H., and An, G. (2003) Plant Cell Physiol. 44, 463-472). The OsCHLH mutant is unable to fix CO2 and exhibits reduced growth. Wild type and mutant plants exhibit similar rates of respiratory O2 uptake in the dark, whereas the rate of photosynthetic O2 evolution by the mutant was negligible during illumination. During dark respiration the wild type and mutant exhibited similar levels of cytoplasmic ATP. In the mutant oligomycin treatment (an inhibitor of mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase) drastically reduced ATP production. The fact that this was reversed by the addition of glucose suggested that the mutant produced ATP exclusively from mitochondria but not from chloroplasts. In whole cell patch clamp experiments, the activity of outward-rectifying K+ channels of rice mesophyll cells showed ATP-dependent currents, which were 1.5-fold greater in wild type than in mutant cells. Channels in both wild type and mutant cells were deactivated by the removal of cytosolic ATP, whereas in the presence of ATP the channels remained active. We conclude that mesophyll cells in the OsCHLH rice mutant derive ATP from mitochondrial respiration, and that this is critical for the normal function of plasma membrane outward-rectifying K+ channels.

We have previously generated a large pool of T-DNA insertional lines in rice. In this study, we screened those TDNA pools for rice mutants that had defective chlorophylls. Among the 1,995 lines examined in the T2 generation, 189 showed a chlorophyll-deficient phenotype that segregated as a single recessive locus. Among the mutants, 10 lines were P-glucuronidase (GUS)-positive in the leaves. Line 9-07117 has a T-DNA insertion into the gene that is highly homologous to XANTHA-F in barley and CHLH in Arabidopsis. This OsCHLH gene encodes the largest subunit of the rice Mg-chelatase, a key enzyme in the chlorophyll branch of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway. In the T2 and T3 generations, the chlorina mutant phenotypes are co-segregated with the T-DNA. We have identified two additional chlorina mutants that have a Tos17 insertion in the OsCHLH gene. Those phenotypes were cosegregated with Tos17 in the progeny. GUS assays and RNA blot analysis showed that expression of the OsCHLH gene is light inducible, while TEM analysis revealed that the thylakoid membrane of the mutant chloroplasts is underdeveloped. The chlorophyll content was very low in the OschlH mutants. This is the first report that T-DNA insertional mutagenesis can be used for functional analysis of rice genes.
