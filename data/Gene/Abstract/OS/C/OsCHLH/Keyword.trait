OsCHLH	growth	Mitochondria provide the main source of cytosolic ATP for activation of outward-rectifying K+ channels in mesophyll protoplast of chlorophyll-deficient mutant rice (OsCHLH) seedlings	 The OsCHLH mutant is unable to fix CO2 and exhibits reduced growth
OsCHLH	chloroplast	Characterization of a rice chlorophyll-deficient mutant using the T-DNA gene-trap system	 GUS assays and RNA blot analysis showed that expression of the OsCHLH gene is light inducible, while TEM analysis revealed that the thylakoid membrane of the mutant chloroplasts is underdeveloped
OsCHLH	seedling	Mitochondria provide the main source of cytosolic ATP for activation of outward-rectifying K+ channels in mesophyll protoplast of chlorophyll-deficient mutant rice (OsCHLH) seedlings	Mitochondria provide the main source of cytosolic ATP for activation of outward-rectifying K+ channels in mesophyll protoplast of chlorophyll-deficient mutant rice (OsCHLH) seedlings
OsCHLH	mitochondria	Mitochondria provide the main source of cytosolic ATP for activation of outward-rectifying K+ channels in mesophyll protoplast of chlorophyll-deficient mutant rice (OsCHLH) seedlings	 We conclude that mesophyll cells in the OsCHLH rice mutant derive ATP from mitochondrial respiration, and that this is critical for the normal function of plasma membrane outward-rectifying K+ channels
OsCHLH	mitochondria	Mitochondria provide the main source of cytosolic ATP for activation of outward-rectifying K+ channels in mesophyll protoplast of chlorophyll-deficient mutant rice (OsCHLH) seedlings	Mitochondria provide the main source of cytosolic ATP for activation of outward-rectifying K+ channels in mesophyll protoplast of chlorophyll-deficient mutant rice (OsCHLH) seedlings
