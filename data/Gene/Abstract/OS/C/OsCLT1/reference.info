NA	OsCLT1, a CRT-like transporter 1, is required for glutathione homeostasis and arsenic tolerance in rice.	2016	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Arsenic (As) contamination in a paddy environment can cause phytotoxicity and elevated As accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa). The mechanism of As detoxification in rice is still poorly understood. We isolated an arsenate (As(V))-sensitive mutant of rice. Genomic resequencing and complementation identified OsCLT1, encoding a CRT-like transporter, as the causal gene for the mutant phenotype. OsCLT1 is localized to the envelope membrane of plastids. The glutathione and γ-glutamylcysteine contents in roots of Osclt1 and RNA interference lines were decreased markedly compared with the wild-type (WT). The concentrations of phytochelatin PC2 in Osclt1 roots were only 32% and 12% of that in WT after As(V) and As(III) treatments, respectively. OsCLT1 mutation resulted in lower As accumulation in roots but higher As accumulation in shoots when exposed to As(V). Under As(III) treatment, Osclt1 accumulated a lower As concentration in roots but similar As concentration in shoots to WT. Further analysis showed that the reduction of As(V) to As(III) was decreased in Osclt1. Osclt1 was also hypersensitive to cadmium (Cd). These results indicate that OsCLT1 plays an important role in glutathione homeostasis, probably by mediating the export of γ-glutamylcysteine and glutathione from plastids to the cytoplasm, which in turn affects As and Cd detoxification in rice.
