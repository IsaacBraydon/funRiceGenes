OsCBM1	OsRac1	Rice Carbohydrate-Binding Malectin-Like Protein, OsCBM1, Contributes to Drought-Stress Tolerance by Participating in NADPH Oxidase-Mediated ROS Production.	 Meanwhile, OsCBM1 can also physically interacts with OsRacGEF1, a specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rop/Rac GTPase OsRac1, and transient coexpression of OsCBM1 with OaRacGEF1 significantly enhanced ROS production

Meanwhile, OsCBM1 can also physically interacts with OsRacGEF1, a specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rop/Rac GTPase OsRac1, and transient coexpression of OsCBM1 with OaRacGEF1 significantly enhanced ROS production
OsCBM1	OsRacGEF1|OsRopGEF7B	Rice Carbohydrate-Binding Malectin-Like Protein, OsCBM1, Contributes to Drought-Stress Tolerance by Participating in NADPH Oxidase-Mediated ROS Production.	 All these results suggest that OsCBM1 participates in NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production by interacting with OsRbohA and OsRacGEF1, contributing to drought stress tolerance of rice
OsCBM1	OsrbohA|Osrboh2	Rice Carbohydrate-Binding Malectin-Like Protein, OsCBM1, Contributes to Drought-Stress Tolerance by Participating in NADPH Oxidase-Mediated ROS Production.	 OsCBM1 physically interacts with OsRbohA, a NADPH oxidase, and the expression of OsCBM1 in osrbohA, an OsRbohA-knockout mutant, is significantly downregulated under both normal growth and drought stress conditions
