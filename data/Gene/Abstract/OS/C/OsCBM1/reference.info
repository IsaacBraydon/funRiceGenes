NA	Rice Carbohydrate-Binding Malectin-Like Protein, OsCBM1, Contributes to Drought-Stress Tolerance by Participating in NADPH Oxidase-Mediated ROS Production.	2021	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology in Arid Area, College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&amp;F University, Yangling, 712100, Shaanxi, China.	Carbohydrate-binding malectin/malectin-like domain-containing proteins (CBMs) are a recently identified protein subfamily of lectins that participates various functional bioprocesses in the animal, bacterial, and plant kingdoms. However, little is known the roles of CBMs in rice development and stress response. In this study, OsCBM1, which encodes a protein containing only one malectin-like domain, was cloned and characterized. OsCBM1 is localized in both the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. Its transcripts are dominantly expressed in leaves and could be significantly stimulated by a number of phytohormone applications and abiotic stress treatments. Overexpression of OsCBM1 increased drought tolerance and reactive oxygen species production in rice, whereas the knockdown of the gene decreased them. OsCBM1 physically interacts with OsRbohA, a NADPH oxidase, and the expression of OsCBM1 in osrbohA, an OsRbohA-knockout mutant, is significantly downregulated under both normal growth and drought stress conditions. Meanwhile, OsCBM1 can also physically interacts with OsRacGEF1, a specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rop/Rac GTPase OsRac1, and transient coexpression of OsCBM1 with OaRacGEF1 significantly enhanced ROS production. Further transcriptome analysis showed that multiple signaling regulatory mechanisms are involved in the OsCBM1-mediated processes. All these results suggest that OsCBM1 participates in NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production by interacting with OsRbohA and OsRacGEF1, contributing to drought stress tolerance of rice. Multiple signaling pathways are likely involved in the OsCBM1-mediated stress tolerance in rice.
