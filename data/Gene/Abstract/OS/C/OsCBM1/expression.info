OsCBM1	 Overexpression of OsCBM1 increased drought tolerance and reactive oxygen species production in rice, whereas the knockdown of the gene decreased them |  OsCBM1 physically interacts with OsRbohA, a NADPH oxidase, and the expression of OsCBM1 in osrbohA, an OsRbohA-knockout mutant, is significantly downregulated under both normal growth and drought stress conditions |  Meanwhile, OsCBM1 can also physically interacts with OsRacGEF1, a specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rop/Rac GTPase OsRac1, and transient coexpression of OsCBM1 with OaRacGEF1 significantly enhanced ROS production	 Overexpression of OsCBM1 increased drought tolerance and reactive oxygen species production in rice, whereas the knockdown of the gene decreased them
