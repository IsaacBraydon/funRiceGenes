Mol. Plant-2008-Zhang-599-610.pdf	Tapetum degeneration retardation is critical for aliphatic metabolism and gene regulation during rice pollen development	2008	Mol Plant	Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, China.	As a complex wall system in flowering plants, the pollen outer wall mainly contains aliphatic sporopollenin; however, the mechanism for synthesizing these lipidic precursors during pollen development remains less well understood. Here, we report on the function of the rice tapetum-expressing TDR (Tapetum Degeneration Retardation) gene in aliphatic metabolism and its regulatory role during rice pollen development. The observations of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses suggested that pollen wall formation was significantly altered in the tdr mutant. The contents of aliphatic compositions of anther were greatly changed in the tdr mutant revealed by GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) testing, particularly less accumulated in fatty acids, primary alcohols, alkanes and alkenes, and an abnormal increase in secondary alcohols with carbon lengths from C29 to C35 in tdr. Microarray data revealed that a group of genes putatively involved in lipid transport and metabolism were significantly altered in the tdr mutant, indicating the critical role of TDR in the formation of the pollen wall. Also, a wide range of genes (236 in total-154 up-regulated and 82 down-regulated) exhibited statistically significant expressional differences between wild-type and tdr. In addition to its function in promoting tapetum PCD, TDR possibly plays crucial regulatory roles in several basic biological processes during rice pollen development.
Plant Physiol.-2010-Zhang-149-62.pdf	OsC6, encoding a lipid transfer protein, is required for postmeiotic anther development in rice	2010	Plant Physiol	School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.	Synthesis of lipidic components in anthers, including of the pollen exine, is essential for plant male reproductive development. Plant lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are small, abundant lipid-binding proteins that have the ability to exchange lipids between membranes in vitro. However, their biological role in male reproductive development remains less understood. Here, we report the crucial role of OsC6 in regulating postmeiotic anther development in rice (Oryza sativa). Found in monocots, OsC6 belongs to a distinct clade from previously identified LTP1 and LTP2 family members found in both dicots and monocots. OsC6 expression is mainly detectable in tapetal cells and weakly in microspores from stage 9 to stage 11 of anther development. Immunological assays indicated that OsC6 is widely distributed in anther tissues such as the tapetal cytoplasm, the extracellular space between the tapetum and middle layer, and the anther locule and anther cuticle. Biochemical assays indicated that recombinant OsC6 has lipid binding activity. Moreover, plants in which OsC6 was silenced had defective development of orbicules (i.e. Ubisch bodies) and pollen exine and had reduced pollen fertility. Furthermore, additional evidence is provided that the expression of OsC6 is positively regulated by a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Tapetum Degeneration Retardation (TDR). Extra granule-like structures were observed on the inner surface of the tdr tapetal layer when the expression of OsC6 was driven by the TDR promoter compared with the tdr mutant. These data suggest that OsC6 plays a crucial role in the development of lipidic orbicules and pollen exine during anther development in rice.
Tsuchiya-1992-Isolation of genes a.pdf	Isolation of genes abundantly expressed in rice anthers at the microspore stage	1992	Plant Mol Biol	Institute for Cell Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, 020, Morioka, Japan	A cDNA library of rice (Oryza sativa L.) has been constructed from anthers at an early stage of pollen development. By differential screening of the library, we have isolated cDNAs of two genes, designated as Osc4 and Osc6, that are abundantly expressed in anthers containing tetrads and uninucleate microspores, but are not expressed in leaves or roots. Expression of Osc4 is absent in mature anthers, while Osc6 is present although the expression decays during pollen maturation. A comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences with those in data banks has not shown significant homology to known molecules.
Tsuchiya-1994-Molecular characteri.pdf	Molecular characterization of rice genes specifically expressed in the anther tapetum	1994	Plant Mol Biol	Institute for Cell Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, 020, Morioka, Japan	In situ localization of mRNA was carried out on two cDNAs (Osc4 and Osc6) that had been isolated from rice anthers at the microspore stage. The mRNA corresponding to each cDNA was shown to be localized only in the tapetal cells of the rice immature anthers, but not in the microspores or the mature pollen. The corresponding genomic clone, Osg6B, was isolated, and its 5â€‘ù<U+3E32>-upstream region was found to regulate Î²-glucuronidase expression in the tapetum of transgenic tobacco. A set of 5â€‘ù<U+3E32> deletions was also generated and a 1095 bp 5â€‘ù<U+3E32> region was revealed to be necessary for activation of the Osg6B promoter in transgenic tobacco.
