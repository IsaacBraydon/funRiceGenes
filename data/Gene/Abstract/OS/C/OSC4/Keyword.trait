OSC4	root	Isolation of genes abundantly expressed in rice anthers at the microspore stage	 By differential screening of the library, we have isolated cDNAs of two genes, designated as Osc4 and Osc6, that are abundantly expressed in anthers containing tetrads and uninucleate microspores, but are not expressed in leaves or roots
OSC4	anther	Molecular characterization of rice genes specifically expressed in the anther tapetum	In situ localization of mRNA was carried out on two cDNAs (Osc4 and Osc6) that had been isolated from rice anthers at the microspore stage
OSC4	pollen	Isolation of genes abundantly expressed in rice anthers at the microspore stage	 Expression of Osc4 is absent in mature anthers, while Osc6 is present although the expression decays during pollen maturation
