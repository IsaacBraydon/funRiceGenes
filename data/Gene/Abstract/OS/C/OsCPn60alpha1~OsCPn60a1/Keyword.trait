OsCPn60alpha1|OsCPn60a1	seedling	OsCpn60alpha1, encoding the plastid chaperonin 60alpha subunit, is essential for folding of rbcL	 The oscpn60alpha1 mutant had a pale-green phenotype at the seedling stage and development ceased after the fourth leaf appeared
OsCPn60alpha1|OsCPn60a1	seedling	OsCpn60alpha1, encoding the plastid chaperonin 60alpha subunit, is essential for folding of rbcL	 This demonstrated that OsCpn60alpha1 is required for the folding of rbcL and that failure of that process is seedling-lethal
OsCPn60alpha1|OsCPn60a1	leaf	OsCpn60alpha1, encoding the plastid chaperonin 60alpha subunit, is essential for folding of rbcL	 The oscpn60alpha1 mutant had a pale-green phenotype at the seedling stage and development ceased after the fourth leaf appeared
OsCPn60alpha1|OsCPn60a1	chloroplast	OsCpn60alpha1, encoding the plastid chaperonin 60alpha subunit, is essential for folding of rbcL	 Transiently expressed OsCpn60alpha1:GFP fusion protein was localized to the chloroplast stroma
