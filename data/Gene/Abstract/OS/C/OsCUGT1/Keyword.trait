OsCUGT1	development	Cold-upregulated glycosyltransferase gene 1 (OsCUGT1) plays important roles in rice height and spikelet fertility.	 RNA sequencing revealed that multiple biological processes associated with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, cytokinin metabolism and pollen development are affected in the oscugt1 mutant
OsCUGT1	development	Cold-upregulated glycosyltransferase gene 1 (OsCUGT1) plays important roles in rice height and spikelet fertility.	 Overall, these results suggest that rice OsCUGT1 plays an essential role in rice development
OsCUGT1	spikelet	Cold-upregulated glycosyltransferase gene 1 (OsCUGT1) plays important roles in rice height and spikelet fertility.	 Histological pollen analysis suggests that the spikelet sterility in oscugt1 mutants may be caused by abnormal microsporogenesis
OsCUGT1	fertility	Cold-upregulated glycosyltransferase gene 1 (OsCUGT1) plays important roles in rice height and spikelet fertility.	 Moreover, multiple transgenic plants with knockdown of OsCUGT1 expression through RNA interference were obtained, which also showed obvious defects in plant height and fertility
OsCUGT1	pollen	Cold-upregulated glycosyltransferase gene 1 (OsCUGT1) plays important roles in rice height and spikelet fertility.	 Histological pollen analysis suggests that the spikelet sterility in oscugt1 mutants may be caused by abnormal microsporogenesis
OsCUGT1	pollen	Cold-upregulated glycosyltransferase gene 1 (OsCUGT1) plays important roles in rice height and spikelet fertility.

OsCUGT1	sterility	Cold-upregulated glycosyltransferase gene 1 (OsCUGT1) plays important roles in rice height and spikelet fertility.	 OsCUGT1 was knocked out by using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system to obtain the mutant oscugt1, which showed a severe dwarf and sterility phenotype
