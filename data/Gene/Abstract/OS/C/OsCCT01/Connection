Ehd1	OsCCT01	Three CCT domain-containing genes were identified to regulate heading date by candidate gene-based association mapping and transformation in rice.	 The overexpression of OsCCT01 delayed flowering through suppressing the expression of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 under both long day and short day conditions
Hd3a	OsCCT01	Three CCT domain-containing genes were identified to regulate heading date by candidate gene-based association mapping and transformation in rice.	 The overexpression of OsCCT01 delayed flowering through suppressing the expression of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 under both long day and short day conditions
