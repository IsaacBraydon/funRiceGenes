OsCCC1	homeostasis	Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene OsCCC1	 Results from different tests indicated that the OsCCC1 plays a significant role in K+ and Cl- homeostasis and rice plant development
OsCCC1	leaf	Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene OsCCC1	 sativa cDNA, which was named OsCCC1, can be induced by KCl in the shoot and root and that the expression level was higher in the leaf and root tips than in any other part of the rice plant
OsCCC1	root	Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene OsCCC1	 sativa cDNA, which was named OsCCC1, can be induced by KCl in the shoot and root and that the expression level was higher in the leaf and root tips than in any other part of the rice plant
OsCCC1	shoot	Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene OsCCC1	 sativa cDNA, which was named OsCCC1, can be induced by KCl in the shoot and root and that the expression level was higher in the leaf and root tips than in any other part of the rice plant
OsCCC1	transporter	Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene OsCCC1	Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene OsCCC1
