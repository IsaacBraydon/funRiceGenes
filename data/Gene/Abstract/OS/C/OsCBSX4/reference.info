We have recently identified and classified a cystathionine beta-synthase domain containing protein family in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa L.). Based on the microarray and MPSS data, we have suggested their involvement in stress tolerance. In this study, we have characterized a rice protein of unknown function, OsCBSX4. This gene was found to be upregulated under high salinity, heavy metal, and oxidative stresses at seedling stage. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsCBSX4 exhibited improved tolerance toward salinity, heavy metal, and oxidative stress. This enhanced stress tolerance in transgenic plants could directly be correlated with higher accumulation of OsCBSX4 protein. Transgenic plants could grow and set seeds under continuous presence of 150 mM NaCl. The total seed yield in WT plants was reduced by 80%, while in transgenic plants, it was reduced only by 15-17%. The transgenic plants accumulated less Na+, especially in seeds and maintained higher net photosynthesis rate and Fv/Fm than WT plants under NaCl stress. Transgenic seedlings also accumulated significantly less H2O2 as compared to WT under salinity, heavy metal, and oxidative stress. OsCBSX4 overexpressing transgenic plants exhibit higher abiotic stress tolerance than WT plants suggesting its role in abiotic stress tolerance in plants.
