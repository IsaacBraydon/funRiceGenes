OsCBSX4	salinity	Overexpression of rice CBS domain containing protein improves salinity, oxidative, and heavy metal tolerance in transgenic tobacco	Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsCBSX4 exhibited improved tolerance toward salinity, heavy metal, and oxidative stress
OsCBSX4	oxidative	Overexpression of rice CBS domain containing protein improves salinity, oxidative, and heavy metal tolerance in transgenic tobacco	Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsCBSX4 exhibited improved tolerance toward salinity, heavy metal, and oxidative stress
OsCBSX4	abiotic stress	Overexpression of rice CBS domain containing protein improves salinity, oxidative, and heavy metal tolerance in transgenic tobacco	OsCBSX4 overexpressing transgenic plants exhibit higher abiotic stress tolerance than WT plants suggesting its role in abiotic stress tolerance in plants
