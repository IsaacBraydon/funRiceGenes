Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) control plant development and response to various stress environments through the important roles in the regulation of Ca(2+) signaling. Thirty-one CDPK genes have been identified in the rice genome by a complete search of the genome based upon HMM profiles. In this study, the expression of this gene family was analyzed using the Affymetrix rice genome array in three rice cultivars: Minghui 63, Zhenshan 97, and their hybrid Shanyou 63 independently. Twenty-seven tissues sampled throughout the entire rice life-span were studied, along with three hormone treatments (GA3, NAA and KT), applied to the seedling at the trefoil stage. All 31 genes were found to be expressed in at least one of the experimental stages studied and revealed diverse expression patterns. We identified differential expression of the OsCPK genes in the stamen (1 day before flowering), the panicle (at the heading stage), the endosperm (days after pollination) and also in callus, in all three cultivars. Eight genes, OsCPK2, OsCPK11, OsCPK14, OsCPK22, OsCPK25, OsCPK26, OsCPK27 and OsCPK29 were found dominantly expressed in the panicle and the stamen, and five genes, OsCPK6, OsCPK7, OsCPK12, OsCPK23 and OsCPK31 were up-regulated in the endosperm stage. The OsCPK genes were also found to be regulated in rice seedlings subjected to different hormone treatment conditions, however their expression were not the same for all varieties. These diverse expression profiles trigger the functional analysis of the CDPK family in rice.
27_369.pdf	Overexpression of a calcium-dependent protein kinase gene enhances growth of rice under low-nitrogen conditions	2010	Plant Biotechnology	Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Agr & Environm Biol, Tokyo 1138657, Japan	The excessive amounts of nitrogen applied in current farming systems can cause environmental problems. There is therefore a need to improve the ability of crop plants to utilize nitrogenous fertilizers. We screened for nitrogen deficiency-tolerant lines among transgenic rice plants that overexpressed full-length cDNAs (FL-cDNAs) corresponding to low-nitrogen response genes, genes related to nitrogen metabolism, and genes related to carbon metabolism. We found that overexpression of OsCPK12 FL-cDNA, encoding a calcium-dependent protein kinase ( CDPK), conferred tolerance to low-nitrogen stress in rice. After two weeks of low-nitrogen treatment, dry weights of shoots from OsCPK12-overexpressing plants were greater than those from control plants. Furthermore, total nitrogen contents of OsCPK12-overexpressing plants were higher than those of the control plants. Our findings suggest that OsCPK12 is involved in the signal transduction pathway(s) in the low-nitrogen stress response and may be useful in engineering crop plants with improved tolerance to low nitrogen levels.
Asano-2012-A rice calcium-depen.pdf	A rice calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK12 oppositely modulates salt-stress tolerance and blast disease resistance	2012	Plant J	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan. tasano@affrc.go.jp	Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) regulate the downstream components in calcium signaling pathways. We investigated the effects of overexpression and disruption of an Oryza sativa (rice) CDPK (OsCPK12) on the plant's response to abiotic and biotic stresses. OsCPK12-overexpressing (OsCPK12-OX) plants exhibited increased tolerance to salt stress. The accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ) in the leaves was less in OsCPK12-OX plants than in wild-type (WT) plants. Genes encoding reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes (OsAPx2 and OsAPx8) were more highly expressed in OsCPK12-OX plants than in WT plants, whereas the expression of the NADPH oxidase gene, OsrbohI, was decreased in OsCPK12-OX plants compared with WT plants. Conversely, a retrotransposon (Tos17) insertion mutant, oscpk12, and plants transformed with an OsCPK12 RNA interference (RNAi) construct were more sensitive to high salinity than were WT plants. The level of H(2) O(2) accumulation was greater in oscpk12 and OsCPK12 RNAi plants than in the WT. These results suggest that OsCPK12 promotes tolerance to salt stress by reducing the accumulation of ROS. We also observed that OsCPK12-OX seedlings had increased sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) and increased susceptibility to blast fungus, probably resulting from the repression of ROS production and/or the involvement of OsCPK12 in the ABA signaling pathway. Collectively, our results suggest that OsCPK12 functions in multiple signaling pathways, positively regulating salt tolerance and negatively modulating blast resistance.
NA	Impaired Function of the Calcium-Dependent Protein Kinase, OsCPK12, Leads to Early Senescence in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2019	Front Plant Sci	Key Laboratory for Zhejiang Super Rice Research and State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, China.	Premature leaf senescence affects plant yield and quality, and numerous researches about it have been conducted until now. In this study, we identified an early senescent mutant es4 in rice (Oryza sativa L.); early senescence appeared approximately at 60 dps and became increasingly senescent with the growth of es4 mutant. We detected that content of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were elevated, while chlorophyll content, soluble protein content, activity of catalase (CAT), activity of peroxidase (POD) and photosynthetic rate were reduced in the es4 mutant leaves. We mapped es4 in a 33.5 Kb physical distance on chromosome 4 by map-based cloning. Sequencing analysis in target interval indicated there was an eight bases deletion mutation in OsCPK12 which encoded a calcium-dependent protein kinase. Functional complementation of OsCPK12 in es4 completely restored the normal phenotype. We used CRISPR/Cas9 for targeted disruption of OsCPK12 in ZH8015 and all the mutants exhibited the premature senescence. All the results indicated that the phenotype of es4 was caused by the mutation of OsCPK12. Overexpression of OsCPK12 in ZH8015 enhanced the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and chlorophyll content. OsCPK12 was mainly expressed in green organs. The results of qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of some key genes involved in senescence, chlorophyll biosynthesis, and photosynthesis were significantly altered in the es4 mutant. Our results demonstrate that the mutant of OsCPK12 triggers the premature leaf senescence; however, the overexpression of OsCPK12 may delay its growth period and provide the potentially positive effect on productivity in rice.
