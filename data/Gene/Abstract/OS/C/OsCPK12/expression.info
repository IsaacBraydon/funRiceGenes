OsCPK12	 Overexpression of OsCPK12 in ZH8015 enhanced the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and chlorophyll content |  Our results demonstrate that the mutant of OsCPK12 triggers the premature leaf senescence; however, the overexpression of OsCPK12 may delay its growth period and provide the potentially positive effect on productivity in rice	 Overexpression of OsCPK12 in ZH8015 enhanced the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and chlorophyll content |  Our results demonstrate that the mutant of OsCPK12 triggers the premature leaf senescence; however, the overexpression of OsCPK12 may delay its growth period and provide the potentially positive effect on productivity in rice
