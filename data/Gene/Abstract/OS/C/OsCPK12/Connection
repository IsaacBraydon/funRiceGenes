OsCPK12	SALT	A rice calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK12 oppositely modulates salt-stress tolerance and blast disease resistance	 OsCPK12-overexpressing (OsCPK12-OX) plants exhibited increased tolerance to salt stress
OsCPK12	SALT	A rice calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK12 oppositely modulates salt-stress tolerance and blast disease resistance	 These results suggest that OsCPK12 promotes tolerance to salt stress by reducing the accumulation of ROS
OsCPK12	SALT	A rice calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK12 oppositely modulates salt-stress tolerance and blast disease resistance	 Collectively, our results suggest that OsCPK12 functions in multiple signaling pathways, positively regulating salt tolerance and negatively modulating blast resistance
