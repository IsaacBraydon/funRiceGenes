NA	CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE4 Integrates Cytokinin and Auxin Signaling to Control Rice Crown Root Formation.	2014	Plant Physiol	Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Regulation Biology of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China (S.G.);State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China (S.G., J.F., F.X., W.W., X.S., J.C., C.C.); andKey Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Biology and Medicine of the Ministry of Education, Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China (B.C., Y.F.).	Crown roots constitute the majority of the rice (Oryza sativa) root system and play an important role in rice growth and development. However, the molecular mechanism of crown root formation in rice is not well understood. Here, we characterized a rice dominant mutant, root enhancer1 (ren1-D), which was observed to exhibit a more robust root system, increased crown root number, and reduced plant height. Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that these phenotypes are caused by the activation of a cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) family gene, OsCKX4. Subcellular localization demonstrated that OsCKX4 is a cytosolic isoform of CKX. OsCKX4 is predominantly expressed in leaf blades and roots. It is the dominant CKX, preferentially expressed in the shoot base where crown root primordia are produced, underlining its role in root initiation. OsCKX4 is induced by exogenous auxin and cytokinin in the roots. Furthermore, one-hybrid assays revealed that OsCKX4 is a direct binding target of both the auxin response factor OsARF25 and the cytokinin response regulators OsRR2 and OsRR3. Overexpression and RNA interference of OsCKX4 confirmed that OsCKX4 plays a positive role in crown root formation. Moreover, expression analysis revealed a significant alteration in the expression of auxin-related genes in the ren1-D mutants, indicating that the OsCKX4 mediates crown root development by integrating the interaction between cytokinin and auxin. Transgenic plants harboring OsCKX4 under the control of the root-specific promoter RCc3 displayed enhanced root development without affecting their shoot parts, suggesting that this strategy could be a powerful tool in rice root engineering.
NA	Phenotypic, Transcriptomic, and Metabolomic Signatures of Root-Specifically Overexpressed OsCKX2 in Rice	2020	Front Plant Sci	Henan Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Henan Grain Crops, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, China.	Cytokinins are crucial signaling molecules that regulate plant growth and development. OsCKX2 irreversibly degrades nucleobase cytokinins by encoding cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase to control grain production in rice. In this study, OsCKX2 was specifically overexpressed in roots using RCc3 promoter to investigate the effects of root-source cytokinins on the growth of rice. OsCKX2 overexpressed (OE) rice showed retarded growth with lower cytokinin levels and biomass production. Shoot-specific transcriptome analysis between OsCKX2 OE rice and wild type (WT) revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with cell division, cell wall structure, phytohormone signaling, and assimilation and catabolism. Metabolome analysis indicated that a majority of differential primary metabolites, such as amino acids and organic acids, increased, while lipids decreased in OsCKX2 OE rice. Integration of transcriptomic and metabolomic data showed that several DEGs and differential metabolites were related to glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). To conclude, reduced cytokinin levels via root-specific overexpression of OsCKX2 resulted in developmental defects, which confirmed the importance of root-source cytokinins in plant growth and morphogenesis.
