NA	CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE4 Integrates Cytokinin and Auxin Signaling to Control Rice Crown Root Formation.	2014	Plant Physiol	Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Regulation Biology of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China (S.G.);State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China (S.G., J.F., F.X., W.W., X.S., J.C., C.C.); andKey Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Biology and Medicine of the Ministry of Education, Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China (B.C., Y.F.).	Crown roots constitute the majority of the rice (Oryza sativa) root system and play an important role in rice growth and development. However, the molecular mechanism of crown root formation in rice is not well understood. Here, we characterized a rice dominant mutant, root enhancer1 (ren1-D), which was observed to exhibit a more robust root system, increased crown root number, and reduced plant height. Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that these phenotypes are caused by the activation of a cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) family gene, OsCKX4. Subcellular localization demonstrated that OsCKX4 is a cytosolic isoform of CKX. OsCKX4 is predominantly expressed in leaf blades and roots. It is the dominant CKX, preferentially expressed in the shoot base where crown root primordia are produced, underlining its role in root initiation. OsCKX4 is induced by exogenous auxin and cytokinin in the roots. Furthermore, one-hybrid assays revealed that OsCKX4 is a direct binding target of both the auxin response factor OsARF25 and the cytokinin response regulators OsRR2 and OsRR3. Overexpression and RNA interference of OsCKX4 confirmed that OsCKX4 plays a positive role in crown root formation. Moreover, expression analysis revealed a significant alteration in the expression of auxin-related genes in the ren1-D mutants, indicating that the OsCKX4 mediates crown root development by integrating the interaction between cytokinin and auxin. Transgenic plants harboring OsCKX4 under the control of the root-specific promoter RCc3 displayed enhanced root development without affecting their shoot parts, suggesting that this strategy could be a powerful tool in rice root engineering.
NA	Phenotypic, Transcriptomic, and Metabolomic Signatures of Root-Specifically Overexpressed OsCKX2 in Rice	2020	Front Plant Sci	Henan Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Henan Grain Crops, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, China.	Cytokinins are crucial signaling molecules that regulate plant growth and development. OsCKX2 irreversibly degrades nucleobase cytokinins by encoding cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase to control grain production in rice. In this study, OsCKX2 was specifically overexpressed in roots using RCc3 promoter to investigate the effects of root-source cytokinins on the growth of rice. OsCKX2 overexpressed (OE) rice showed retarded growth with lower cytokinin levels and biomass production. Shoot-specific transcriptome analysis between OsCKX2 OE rice and wild type (WT) revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with cell division, cell wall structure, phytohormone signaling, and assimilation and catabolism. Metabolome analysis indicated that a majority of differential primary metabolites, such as amino acids and organic acids, increased, while lipids decreased in OsCKX2 OE rice. Integration of transcriptomic and metabolomic data showed that several DEGs and differential metabolites were related to glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). To conclude, reduced cytokinin levels via root-specific overexpression of OsCKX2 resulted in developmental defects, which confirmed the importance of root-source cytokinins in plant growth and morphogenesis.
NA	Endoplasmic Reticulum-Localized PURINE PERMEASE1 Regulates Plant Height and Grain Weight by Modulating Cytokinin Distribution in Rice	2020	Front Plant Sci	Southern Regional Collaborative Innovation Center for Grain and Oil Crops in China, College of Agriculture, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, China.	Cytokinins (CKs) are a class of phytohormones playing essential roles in various biological processes. However, the mechanisms underlying CK transport as well as its function in plant growth and development are far from being fully elucidated. Here, we characterize the function of PURINE PERMEASE1 (OsPUP1) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). OsPUP1 was predominantly expressed in the root, particularly in vascular cells, and CK treatment can induce its expression. Subcellular localization analysis showed that OsPUP1 was predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Overexpression of OsPUP1 resulted in growth defect of various aerial tissues, including decreased leaf length, plant height, grain weight, panicle length, and grain number. Hormone profiling revealed that the CK content was decreased in the shoot of OsPUP1-overexpressing seedling, but increased in the root, compared with the wild type. The CK content in the panicle was also decreased. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis using several CK type-A response regulators (OsRRs) as the marker genes suggested that the CK response in the shoot of OsPUP1-overexpressing seedling is decreased compared to the wild type when CKs are applied to the root. Genetic analysis revealed that BG3/OsPUP4, a putative plasma membrane-localized CK transporter, overcomes the function of OsPUP1. We hypothesize that OsPUP1 might be involved in importing CKs into ER to unload CKs from the vascular tissues by cell-to-cell transport.
NA	The Amino Acid Transporter OsAAP4 Contributes to Rice Tillering and Grain Yield by Regulating Neutral Amino Acid Allocation through Two Splicing Variants	2021	Rice (N Y)	Key Laboratory of Plant Resource Conservation and Germplasm Innovation in Mountainous Region (Ministry of Education), College of Agricultural Sciences, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, China. zmfang@gzu.edu.cn.	Background: Amino acids, which are transported by amino acid transporters, are the major forms of organic nitrogen utilized by higher plants. Among the 19 Amino Acid Permease transporters (AAPs) in rice, only a small number of these genes have been reported to influence rice growth and development. However, whether other OsAAPs are responsible for rice growth and development is unclear.  Results: In this study, we demonstrate that OsAAP4 promoter sequences are divergent between Indica and Japonica, with higher expression in the former, which produces more tillers and higher grain yield than does Japonica. Overexpression of two different splicing variants of OsAAP4 in Japonica ZH11 significantly increased rice tillering and grain yield as result of enhancing the neutral amino acid concentrations of Val, Pro, Thr and Leu. OsAAP4 RNA interference (RNAi) and mutant lines displayed opposite trends compared with overexpresing (OE) lines. In addition, exogenous Val or Pro at 0.5 mM significantly promoted the bud outgrowth of lines overexpressing an OsAAP4a splicing variant compared with ZH11, and exogenous Val or Pro at 2.0 mM significantly enhanced the bud outgrowth of lines overexpressing splicing variant OsAAP4b compared with ZH11. Of note, the results of a protoplast amino acid-uptake assay showed that Val or Pro at different concentrations was specifically transported and accumulated in these overexpressing lines. Transcriptome analysis further demonstrated that OsAAP4 may affect nitrogen transport and metabolism, and auxin, cytokinin signaling in regulating rice tillering.  Conclusion: Our results suggested that OsAAP4 contributes to rice tiller and grain yield by regulating neutral amino acid allocation through two different splicing variants and that OsAAP4 might have potential applications in rice breeding.
NA	OsDOF11 Promotes Crown Root Formation via Cytokinin in Oryza Sativa.	2022	Front Biosci (Landmark Ed)	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology/Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops/Joint International Research Laboratory of Agriculture &amp; Agri-Product Safety, Yangzhou University, 225009 Yangzhou, Jiangsu, China.	BACKGROUND: Crown root is the main part of root system, which performs an important role in rice growth and development, especially in nutrition and water assimilation. Previously, we reported negative feedback regulation loop between Oryza sativa DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER 11 (OsDOF11) and cytokinin by Oryza sativa CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE 4 (OsCKX4) in rice development. METHODS: Reverse transcription quantitative RT-PCR analyses was used to analyze the related gene transcript level. Nitrogen and hormone were measured by CHN-Nitrogen analyser and Liquid chromatography mass spectrometer, respectively. Exogenous application of cytokinin and [13C] sucrose labeled stable isotope uptake experiments help us to explain the relationship between OsDOF11 and cytokinin. RESULTS: We demonstrate the role of OsDOF11 in root development. We note that the loss function of OsDOF11 displays the reduced crown roots number, low activity of nitrogen assimilation and low content of cytokinin and auxin. The expression level of WUSCHEL-related homeobox (OsWOX11), A-type response regulator 2 (OsRR2), OsRR3, and OsCKX4 were decreased in osdof11-1, as well as in OsDOF11 RNA interference 9 mutants (RNAi-9 lines). Through Exogenous application of multiple concentrations of cytokinin as treatment to osdof11-1 mutant, RNAi-9 lines, and wild type (WT). We found that the crown roots number of osdof11-1 plants were rescued as the cytokinin concentration increased gradually from 1 μM to 10 μM, but the effect was weaker in RNAi-9 line. And cytokinin inhibited sucrose uptake activity from Murashige-Skoog medium with 3.0% sucrose (MS30) by OsDOF11 in rice root. CONCLUSIONS: OsDOF11 promotes crown root formation via cytokinin in oryza sativa. These results provide a physiological basis for further analysis of the OsDOF11 function of in rice root development.
