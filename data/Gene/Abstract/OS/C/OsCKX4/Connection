D6|OSH15|Oskn3|RLB	OsCKX4	RLB (RICE LATERAL BRANCH) recruits PRC2-mediated H3K27 tri-methylation on OsCKX4 to regulate lateral branching.	RLB (RICE LATERAL BRANCH) recruits PRC2-mediated H3K27 tri-methylation on OsCKX4 to regulate lateral branching.
D6|OSH15|Oskn3|RLB	OsCKX4	RLB (RICE LATERAL BRANCH) recruits PRC2-mediated H3K27 tri-methylation on OsCKX4 to regulate lateral branching.	 RLB directly binds to the promoter and represses the transcription of OsCKX4, a cytokinin oxidase gene with high abundance in panicle branch meristem
D6|OSH15|Oskn3|RLB	OsCKX4	RLB (RICE LATERAL BRANCH) recruits PRC2-mediated H3K27 tri-methylation on OsCKX4 to regulate lateral branching.	 OsCKX4 over-expression lines phenocopied rlb which showed up-regulated OsCKX4 levels
D6|OSH15|Oskn3|RLB	OsCKX4	RLB (RICE LATERAL BRANCH) recruits PRC2-mediated H3K27 tri-methylation on OsCKX4 to regulate lateral branching.	 Meanwhile, RLB physically binds to Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) component OsEMF2b and co-localized with H3K27me3, a suppressing histone modification mediated by PRC2, in the OsCKX4 promoter
D6|OSH15|Oskn3|RLB	OsCKX4	RLB (RICE LATERAL BRANCH) recruits PRC2-mediated H3K27 tri-methylation on OsCKX4 to regulate lateral branching.	 We proposed that RLB recruits PRC2 to the OsCKX4 promoter to epigenetically repress its transcription, which suppresses the catabolism of cytokinin, thereby promoting rice lateral branching
OsCKX4	OsDOF11	The sucrose transport regulator OsDOF11 mediates cytokinin degradation during rice development.	 Moreover, mutation of osckx4 in the osdof11 osckx4 double mutant rescued the semi-dwarf phenotype of the osdof11 mutant
OsCKX4	OsDOF11	The sucrose transport regulator OsDOF11 mediates cytokinin degradation during rice development.	 Interestingly, exogenous application of kinetin promoted OsDOF11 expression earlier than OsCKX4, and overexpression of O
OsCKX4	OsDOF11	The sucrose transport regulator OsDOF11 mediates cytokinin degradation during rice development.	 Taken together, our results suggest a model in which both a sucrose transport regulator (OsDOF11) and cytokinin via OsCKX4 establish a feedback loop to maintain dynamic tissue homeostasis
