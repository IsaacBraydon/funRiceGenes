OsARF25	OsCKX4	CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE4 Integrates Cytokinin and Auxin Signaling to Control Rice Crown Root Formation.	Furthermore, one-hybrid assays revealed that OsCKX4 is a direct binding target of both the auxin response factor OsARF25 and the cytokinin response regulators OsRR2 and OsRR3
OsCKX4	OsRR2	CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE4 Integrates Cytokinin and Auxin Signaling to Control Rice Crown Root Formation.	Furthermore, one-hybrid assays revealed that OsCKX4 is a direct binding target of both the auxin response factor OsARF25 and the cytokinin response regulators OsRR2 and OsRR3

D6|OSH15|Oskn3|RLB	OsCKX4	RLB (RICE LATERAL BRANCH) recruits PRC2-mediated H3K27 tri-methylation on OsCKX4 to regulate lateral branching.	RLB (RICE LATERAL BRANCH) recruits PRC2-mediated H3K27 tri-methylation on OsCKX4 to regulate lateral branching.
D6|OSH15|Oskn3|RLB	OsCKX4	RLB (RICE LATERAL BRANCH) recruits PRC2-mediated H3K27 tri-methylation on OsCKX4 to regulate lateral branching.	 RLB directly binds to the promoter and represses the transcription of OsCKX4, a cytokinin oxidase gene with high abundance in panicle branch meristem
D6|OSH15|Oskn3|RLB	OsCKX4	RLB (RICE LATERAL BRANCH) recruits PRC2-mediated H3K27 tri-methylation on OsCKX4 to regulate lateral branching.	 OsCKX4 over-expression lines phenocopied rlb which showed up-regulated OsCKX4 levels
D6|OSH15|Oskn3|RLB	OsCKX4	RLB (RICE LATERAL BRANCH) recruits PRC2-mediated H3K27 tri-methylation on OsCKX4 to regulate lateral branching.	 Meanwhile, RLB physically binds to Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) component OsEMF2b and co-localized with H3K27me3, a suppressing histone modification mediated by PRC2, in the OsCKX4 promoter
D6|OSH15|Oskn3|RLB	OsCKX4	RLB (RICE LATERAL BRANCH) recruits PRC2-mediated H3K27 tri-methylation on OsCKX4 to regulate lateral branching.	 We proposed that RLB recruits PRC2 to the OsCKX4 promoter to epigenetically repress its transcription, which suppresses the catabolism of cytokinin, thereby promoting rice lateral branching
