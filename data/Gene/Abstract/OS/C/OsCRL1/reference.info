NA	Initiation of scutellum-derived callus is regulated by an embryo-like developmental pathway in rice.	2023	Commun Biol	Institute of Genetic and Regenerative Biology, Key Laboratory for Cell and Gene Engineering of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	In rice (Oryza sativa) tissue culture, callus can be induced from the scutellum in embryo or from the vasculature of non-embryonic organs such as leaves, nodes, or roots. Here we show that the auxin signaling pathway triggers cell division in the epidermis of the scutellum to form an embryo-like structure, which leads to callus formation. Our transcriptome data show that embryo-, stem cell-, and auxin-related genes are upregulated during scutellum-derived callus initiation. Among those genes, the embryo-specific gene OsLEC1 is activated by auxin and involved in scutellum-derived callus initiation. However, OsLEC1 is not required for vasculature-derived callus initiation from roots. In addition, OsIAA11 and OsCRL1, which are involved in root development, are required for vasculature-derived callus formation but not for scutellum-derived callus formation. Overall, our data indicate that scutellum-derived callus initiation is regulated by an embryo-like development program, and this is different from vasculature-derived callus initiation which borrows a root development program.
