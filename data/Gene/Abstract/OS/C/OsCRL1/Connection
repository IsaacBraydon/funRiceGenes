OsCRL1	OsIAA11	Initiation of scutellum-derived callus is regulated by an embryo-like developmental pathway in rice.	 In addition, OsIAA11 and OsCRL1, which are involved in root development, are required for vasculature-derived callus formation but not for scutellum-derived callus formation
OsCRL1	OsUBC11	Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme OsUBC11 Affects the Development of Roots via Auxin Pathway.	 Expression of the auxin synthesis regulating gene OsYUCCA4/6/7/9, the auxin transport gene OsAUX1, auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) family gene OsIAA31, auxin response factor OsARF16 and root regulator key genes, including OsWOX11, OsCRL1, OsCRL5 was significantly down-regulated in OsUBC11 overexpressing plants
