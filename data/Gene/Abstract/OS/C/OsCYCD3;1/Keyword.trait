OsCYCD3;1	cell division	D-type cyclin OsCYCD3;1 is involved in the maintenance of meristem activity to regulate branch formation in rice.	 Our results suggest that OsCYCD3;1 promotes branch formation, probably by regulating cell division to maintain the activities of the axillary meristem and the SAM
