In vitro assays using recombinant enzymes enabled three cDNAs encoding ent-copalyl diphosphate synthases to be identified in wheat (Triticum aestivum): TaCPS1, TaCPS2, and TaCPS3. The phylogenetic tree and expression analyses suggest that TaCPS3 is responsible for gibberellin biosynthesis, while TaCPS1 and TaCPS2 are possible functional homologs of diterpene cyclase genes OsCPS2 and OsCPS4 involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis in rice.
J. Biol. Chem.-2009-Okada-26510-8.pdf	OsTGAP1, a bZIP transcription factor, coordinately regulates the inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice	2009	J Biol Chem	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Production of major diterpenoid phytoalexins, momilactones and phytocassanes, is induced in rice upon recognition of pathogenic invasion as plant defense-related compounds. We recently showed that biosynthetic genes for momilactones are clustered on rice chromosome 4 and co-expressed after elicitation, mimicking pathogen attack. Because genes for most metabolic pathways in plants are not organized in gene clusters, examination of the mechanism(s) regulating the expression of such clustered genes is needed. Here, we report a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-inducible basic leucine zipper transcription factor, OsTGAP1, which is essential for momilactone biosynthesis and regulates the expression of the five genes in the cluster. The knock-out mutant for OsTGAP1 had almost no expression of the five clustered genes (OsCPS4, OsKSL4, CYP99A2, CYP99A3, and OsMAS) or production of momilactones upon elicitor treatment. Inductive expression of OsKSL7 for phytocassane biosynthesis was also largely affected in the ostgap1 mutant, although phytocassane accumulation still occurred. Conversely, OsTGAP1-overexpressing lines exhibited enhanced expression of the clustered genes and hyperaccumulation of momilactones in response to the elicitor. Furthermore, enhanced expression of OsKSL7 and hyperaccumulation of phytocassanes was also observed. We also found that OsTGAP1 overexpression can influence transcriptional up-regulation of OsDXS3 in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, eventually leading to inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins. These results indicate that OsTGAP1 functions as a key regulator of the coordinated transcription of genes involved in inductive diterpenoid phytoalexin production in rice and mainly exerts an essential role on expression of the clustered genes for momilactone biosynthesis.

A recessive gibberellin (GA)-insensitive dwarf mutant of rice, gibberellin-insensitive dwarf1 (gid1), has been identified, which shows a severe dwarf phenotype and contains high concentrations of endogenous GA. To elucidate the function of gid1, proteins regulated downstream of gid1 were analysed using a proteomic approach. Proteins extracted from suspension-cultured cells of gid1 and its wild type were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). Of a total of 962 proteins identified from the suspension-cultured cells, 16 were increased and 14 were decreased in gid1 compared with its wild type. Among the proteins hyper-accumulated in gid1 were osmotin, triosephosphate isomerase, probenazole inducible protein (PBZ1) and pathogenesis-related protein 10. Of these four genes, only the expression of PBZ1 was increased by exogenous GA3 application. Expression of this gene was also enhanced in shoots of the wild type by cold stress or by rice blast fungus infection. Under normal growth conditions, there was more PBZ1 protein in gid1 than in the wild type. In addition, gid1 showed increased tolerance to cold stress and resistance to blast fungus infection. The entcopalyl diphosphate synthase (OsCPS) genes, which encode enzymes at the branch point between GA and phytoalexin biosynthesis, were expressed differentially in gid1 relative to the wild type. Specifically, OsCPS1, which encodes an enzyme in the GA biosynthesis pathway, was down-regulated and OsCPS2 and OsCPS4, which encode enzymes in phytoalexin biosynthesis, were up-regulated in gid1. These results suggest that the expression of PBZ1 is regulated by GA signalling and stress stimuli, and that gid1 is involved in tolerance to cold stress and resistance to blast fungus.
j.1365-313X.2004.02175.x.pdf	Biological functions of ent- and syn-copalyl diphosphate synthases in rice: key enzymes for the branch point of gibberellin and phytoalexin biosynthesis	2004	Plant J	Course of the Science of Bioresources, The United Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Iwate University (Yamagata University), Tsuruoka, Yamagata 997-8555, Japan.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) produces ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CDP) and syn-CDP as precursors for several classes of phytoalexins and the phytohormones, gibberellins (GAs). It has recently been shown that a loss-of-function mutation of OsCPS1, a gene encoding a putative ent-CDP synthase, results in a severely GA-deficient dwarf phenotype in rice. To clarify the biological functions of the ent- and syn-CDP synthases involved in the biosynthesis of phytoalexins and/or GAs, we isolated two cDNAs, OsCyc1 and OsCyc2, encoding putative diterpene cyclases from ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated rice leaves (cv. Nipponbare). The production of phytoalexins in rice leaves is known to be highly induced by UV treatment. Using a bacterial expression system, we demonstrated that OsCyc1 encodes syn-CDP synthase and that OsCyc2 and OsCPS1 encode ent-CDP synthase. The level of expression of the OsCyc1 and OsCyc2 transcripts in rice leaves increased drastically in response to UV treatment, whereas expression of the OsCPS1 transcript was not induced by UV light. These results suggest that OsCyc1, OsCyc2 and OsCPS1 are responsible for the biosynthesis of momilactones A and B and oryzalexin S, oryzalexins A-F and phytocassanes A-E, and GAs, respectively. Our results strongly suggest the presence of two ent-CDP synthase isoforms in rice, one that participates in the biosynthesis of GAs and a second that is involved in the biosynthesis of phytoalexins.
nihms339762.pdf	Genetic evidence for natural product-mediated plant-plant allelopathy in rice (Oryza sativa)	2012	New Phytol	Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics, & Molecular Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011, USA.	* There is controversy as to whether specific natural products play a role in directly mediating antagonistic plant-plant interactions - that is, allelopathy. If proved to exist, such phenomena would hold considerable promise for agronomic improvement of staple food crops such as rice (Oryza sativa). * However, while substantiated by the presence of phytotoxic compounds at potentially relevant concentrations, demonstrating a direct role for specific natural products in allelopathy has been difficult because of the chemical complexity of root and plant litter exudates. This complexity can be bypassed via selective genetic manipulation to ablate production of putative allelopathic compounds, but such an approach previously has not been applied. * The rice diterpenoid momilactones provide an example of natural products for which correlative biochemical evidence has been obtained for a role in allelopathy. Here, we apply reverse genetics, using knock-outs of the relevant diterpene synthases (copalyl diphosphate synthase 4 (OsCPS4) and kaurene synthase-like 4 (OsKSL4)), to demonstrate that rice momilactones are involved in allelopathy, including suppressing growth of the widespread rice paddy weed, barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli). * Thus, our results not only provide novel genetic evidence for natural product-mediated allelopathy, but also furnish a molecular target for breeding and metabolic engineering of this important crop plant.
NA	Inferring Roles in Defense from Metabolic Allocation of Rice Diterpenoids.	2018	Plant Cell	Iowa State University CITY: Ames STATE: IA United States Of America [US].	Among their responses to microbial infection, plants deploy an arsenal of natural antibiotic products. These historically have been identified on the basis of their antibiotic activity in vitro, which leaves open the question of their relevance to defense in planta. The vast majority of such natural products from the important crop plant rice (Oryza sativa) are diterpenoids whose biosynthesis proceeds via either ent- or syn- copalyl diphosphate (CPP) intermediates, and which were isolated on the basis of their antibiotic activity against the fungal blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. However, rice plants in which the gene for the syn-CPP synthase Os-CPS4 is knocked-out do not exhibit increased susceptibility to M. oryzae. Here we show that knocking-out or knocking-down Os-CPS4 actually decreases susceptibility to the bacterial leaf blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae. By contrast, genetic manipulation of the gene for the ent-CPP synthase Os-CPS2 alters susceptibility to both M. oryzae and X. oryzae. Despite the secretion of diterpenoids dependent on Os-CPS2 or Os-CPS4 from roots, neither knock-out exhibited significant changes in the composition of their rhizosphere bacterial communities. Nevertheless, rice plants allocate substantial metabolic resources towards syn- and ent-CPP derived diterpenoids upon infection/induction. Further investigation revealed that Os-CPS4 plays a role in fungal non-host disease resistance. Thus, examination of metabolic allocation provides important clues into physiological function.
