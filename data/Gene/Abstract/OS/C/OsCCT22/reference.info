NA	Global analysis of CCT family knockout mutants identifies four genes involved in regulating heading date in rice	2020	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Many genes encoding CCT domain-containing proteins regulate flowering time. In rice (Oryza sativa), 41 such genes have been identified, but only a few have been shown to regulate heading date. Here, to test whether and how additional CCT family genes regulate heading date in rice, we classified these genes into five groups based on their diurnal expression patterns. The expression patterns of genes in the same subfamily or in close phylogenetic clades tended to be similar. We generated knockout mutants of the entire gene family via CRISPR/Cas9. The heading dates of knockout mutants of only 4 of 14 genes previously shown to regulate heading date were altered, pointing to functional redundancy of CCT family genes in regulating this trait. Analysis of mutants of four other genes showed that OsCCT22, OsCCT38, and OsCCT41 suppress heading under long-day conditions and promote heading under short-day conditions. OsCCT03 promotes heading under both conditions and upregulates the expression of Hd1 and Ehd1, a phenomenon not previously reported for other such genes. To date, at least 18 CCT domain-containing genes involved in regulating heading have been identified, providing diverse, flexible gene combinations for generating rice varieties with a given heading date.
NA	OsBBX19-OsBTB97/OsBBX11 module regulates spikelet development and yield production in rice.	2023	Plant Sci	National Key Laboratory of Crop Improvement for Stress Tolerance and Production, College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&amp;F University, Yangling 712100, China.	Spikelet and floral-related organs are important agronomic traits for rice grain yield. BTB (broad-complex, tram track, and bric-abrac) proteins control various developmental functions in plants; however, the molecular mechanism of BTB proteins underlying grain development and yield production is still unknown. Here, we evaluated the molecular mechanism of a previously unrecognized functional gene, namely OsBTB97 that regulates the floral and spikelet-related organs which greatly affect the final grain yield. We found that the knockdown of the OsBTB97 gene had significant impacts on the development of spikelet-related organs and grain size, resulting in a decrease in yield, by altering the and grain-related genes. Furthermore, we found that the knockout mutants of two BBX genes, OsBBX11 and OsBBX19, which interact with the OsBTB97 protein at translation and transcriptional level, respectively, displayed lower OsBTB97 expression, suggesting the genetic relationship between the BTB protein and the BBX transcription factors in rice. Taken together, our study dissects the function of the novel OsBTB97 by interacting with two BBX proteins and an OsBBX19-OsBTB97/OsBBX11 module might function in the spikelet development and seed production in rice. The outcome of the present study provides promising knowledge about BTB proteins in the improvement of crop production in plants.
