Ehd1	OsCLF|SDG711		SDG711 was also found to be involved in the repression of Ehd1 in LD.
Ehd1	OsCLF|SDG711		SDG711 was shown to directly target to OsLF and Ehd1 loci to mediate H3K27me3 and gene repression.
JMJ703	OsCLF|SDG711	Regulation of Histone Methylation and Reprogramming of Gene Expression in the Rice Inflorescence Meristem.	 Thousands of genes gained or lost H3K27me3 in IM, and downregulation of the H3K27 methyltransferase gene SET DOMAIN GROUP 711 (SDG711) or mutation of the H3K4 demethylase gene JMJ703 eliminated the increase of H3K27me3 in many genes
JMJ703	OsCLF|SDG711	Regulation of Histone Methylation and Reprogramming of Gene Expression in the Rice Inflorescence Meristem.	 Double knockdown/knockout of SDG711 and JMJ703 further reduced panicle size
JMJ703	OsCLF|SDG711	Regulation of Histone Methylation and Reprogramming of Gene Expression in the Rice Inflorescence Meristem.	 These results suggest that SDG711 and JMJ703 have agonistic functions in reprogramming the H3K27me3/H3K4me3 ratio and modulating gene expression in the IM
CHR729|OsCHD3	OsCLF|SDG711	Histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 regulatory genes control stable transmission of an epimutation in rice.	 Here we show that maintenance of a stably hypomethylated active epiallele in rice required a CHD3 protein (CHR729) and that over-expression of an H3K4me3 demethylase (JMJ703) or H3K27me3 methyltransferase (SDG711) could stably resilence the epiallele
