OsCLF|SDG711	histone trimethylation	NA	NA
OsCLF|SDG711	histone trimethylation	NA	The expression of SDG711 and SDG718 is induced by LD and SD, respectively.
OsCLF|SDG711	seed	Imprinted Gene OsFIE1 Modulates Rice Seed Development by Influencing the Nutrient Metabolism and Modifying Genome H3K27me3.	OsFIE1 specifically expressed in endosperm, and mRNA of OsFIE1 also enriched in inner seed coat with the corresponding PcG members of OsiEZ1 and OsCLF
OsCLF|SDG711	stem	Regulation of plant height in rice by the Polycomb group genes OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF.	 Reduced cell expansion and cell division of stem caused significant reduction of stem length during mature period of OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF RNAi transgenic plants
OsCLF|SDG711	cell division	Regulation of plant height in rice by the Polycomb group genes OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF.	 Reduced cell expansion and cell division of stem caused significant reduction of stem length during mature period of OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF RNAi transgenic plants
OsCLF|SDG711	dwarf	Regulation of plant height in rice by the Polycomb group genes OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF.	 To determine how PcG genes regulate plant height, we investigated the phenotypes of the emf2b mutant and OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF RNAi transgenic plants; they all exhibited dwarf phenotype
OsCLF|SDG711	height	Regulation of plant height in rice by the Polycomb group genes OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF.	 Therefore, we speculated that these PcG genes, OsFIE2, OsCLF and OsEMF2b, may work as a PRC2 to regulate rice height
OsCLF|SDG711	plant height	Regulation of plant height in rice by the Polycomb group genes OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF.	 To determine how PcG genes regulate plant height, we investigated the phenotypes of the emf2b mutant and OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF RNAi transgenic plants; they all exhibited dwarf phenotype
