44545945.pdf	Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes	2009	Mol Plant	CSIRO Plant Industry, GPO BOX 1600, ACT 2601, Australia. ming.luo@csiro.au	Polycomb group proteins (PcG) play important roles in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Some core PcG proteins, such as Enhancer of Zeste (E(z)), Suppressor of Zeste (12) (Su(z)12), and Extra Sex Combs (ESC), are conserved in plants. The rice genome contains two E(z)-like genes, OsiEZ1 and OsCLF, two homologs of Su(z)12, OsEMF2a and OsEMF2b, and two ESC-like genes, OsFIE1 and OsFIE2. OsFIE1 is expressed only in endosperm; the maternal copy is expressed while the paternal copy is not active. Other rice PcG genes are expressed in a wide range of tissues and are not imprinted in the endosperm. The two E(z)-like genes appear to have duplicated before the separation of the dicots and monocots; the two homologs of Su(z)12 possibly duplicated during the evolution of the Gramineae and the two ESC-like genes are likely to have duplicated in the ancestor of the grasses. No homologs of the Arabidopsis seed-expressed PcG genes MEA and FIS2 were identified in the rice genome. We have isolated T-DNA insertion lines in the rice homologs of three PcG genes. There is no autonomous endosperm development in these T-DNA insertion lines. One line with a T-DNA insertion in OsEMF2b displays pleiotropic phenotypes including altered flowering time and abnormal flower organs, suggesting important roles in rice development for this gene.
NA	Histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 regulatory genes control stable transmission of an epimutation in rice.	2015	Sci Rep	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, 430070 Wuhan, China.	DNA methylation loss can produce inheritable active epialleles in plants. The mechanism involved in the stable transmission of hypomethylated epimuations is presently not clear. Here we show that maintenance of a stably hypomethylated active epiallele in rice required a CHD3 protein (CHR729) and that over-expression of an H3K4me3 demethylase (JMJ703) or H3K27me3 methyltransferase (SDG711) could stably resilence the epiallele. CHR729 and JMJ703 have antagonistic function in H3K4me3 in maintaining the active state of the epiallele, whereas SDG711-mediated H3K27me3 was sufficient to stably repress the locus. The data suggest that H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 controlled by these chromatin regulators may be involved in stable transmission/resetting of epigenetic variation in rice.
NA	Imprinted Gene OsFIE1 Modulates Rice Seed Development by Influencing the Nutrient Metabolism and Modifying Genome H3K27me3.	2016	Plant J	College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Imprinted Polycomb Group (PcG) genes play a critical role in seed development in Arabidopsis. However, the role of the imprinted gene in cereal plant remains obscure. Here, the transgenic approach was conducted to study the function of the imprinted gene Oryza sativa Fertilization Independent Endosperm 1 (OsFIE1) during seed development in rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica &quot;ZhongHua11â€³). The RNAi of OsFIE1 and homozygous T-DNA insertion mutant osfie1 led to smaller seed, delayed embryo development, smaller aleurone layer cell, and decreased seed set rate. OsFIE1 specifically expressed in endosperm, and mRNA of OsFIE1 also enriched in inner seed coat with the corresponding PcG members of OsiEZ1 and OsCLF. Meanwhile, the contents of seed storage proteins and Ile, Leu, and Val were decreased, accompanied with the down-regulation of multiple transcription factors, storage protein synthesis and amino acid metabolism related genes in OsFIE1-RNAi lines and osfie1. Western blot showed that the complex of OsFIE1-PcG in endosperm regulated the expression of target genes by genome H3K27me3 modification. We conclude that OsFIE1-PcG complex which enriched in inner seed coat and endosperm linked the development of embryo and endosperm by influencing the transcription factors and nutrient metabolism made a highly different effort from OsFIE2-PcG complex.

NA	Regulation of plant height in rice by the Polycomb group genes OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF.	2017	Plant Sci	College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China. Electronic address: zhongjun560@163.com.	An ideal plant height is essential for crop yield. Some Polycomb group (PcG) genes mutants exhibit a dwarf phenotype in rice. To determine how PcG genes regulate plant height, we investigated the phenotypes of the emf2b mutant and OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF RNAi transgenic plants; they all exhibited dwarf phenotype. Further analyses indicated that stem elongation at jointing stage was seriously inhibited in emf2b and RNAi transgenic plants. Reduced cell expansion and cell division of stem caused significant reduction of stem length during mature period of OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF RNAi transgenic plants. Transcription analysis revealed that cell division, cell expansion and plant hormones related genes differentially expressed between emf2b and WT. In addition, PcG genes mutants weakened GA signal and GA concentration and leaded to suppresseion of plant height. Analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that 109 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated genes were identified in both emf2b and fie2. H3K27me3-modified sites were observed in 95 of the 109 up-regulated genes, and some of them were up-regulated in OsFIE2, OsCLF and OsEMF2b RNAi transgenic plants, and their H3K27me3 levels were reduced in emf2b. Moreover, OsEMF2b interacted with OsCLF. Therefore, we speculated that these PcG genes, OsFIE2, OsCLF and OsEMF2b, may work as a PRC2 to regulate rice height.
NA	Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant. In addition to serving as a model plant for molecular genetic studies of monocots, rice is a staple crop for about half of the world population. Heading date is a critical agronomic trait, and many genes controlling heading date have been cloned during the last two decades. The mechanism of flowering in rice from recognition of day length by leaves to floral activation in the shoot apical meristem has been extensively studied. In this review, we summarize current progress on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice with emphasis on post-translational modifications of key regulators, including Heading Date 1 (Hd1), Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Grain Number, Plant Height, and Heading Date7 (Ghd7). The contribution of heading date genes to heterosis and the expansion of rice cultivation areas from low-latitude to high-latitude regions are also discussed. To overcome limitations of diverse genetic backgrounds used in heading date studies and to gain a clearer understanding of flowering in rice, we propose a systematic collection of genetic resources in a common genetic background. Strategies in breeding adapted cultivars by rational design are also discussed.
NA	SDG711 Is Involved in Rice Seed Development through Regulation of Starch Metabolism Gene Expression in Coordination with Other HistoneModifications	2021	Rice (N Y)	Institute for Interdisciplinary Research, Jianghan University, Wuhan, 430056, China. lxytcw@webmail.hzau.edu.cn.	SDG711 is a histone H3K27me2/3 transmethylase in rice, a homolog of CLF in Arabidopsis, and plays key roles in regulating flowering time and panicle development. In this work, we investigated the role of SDG711 in rice seed development. Overexpression and downregulation of SDG711 lead to a decrease and increase in the expression level of genes related to starch accumulation, resulting in smaller seeds or even seed abortion. ChIP assay showed that SDG711-mediated H3K27me3 changed significantly in genes related to endosperm development, and SDG711 can directly bind to the gene body region of several starch synthesis genes and amylase genes. In addition, H3K4me3 and H3K9ac modifications also cooperate with H3K27me3 to regulate the development of the endosperm. Our results suggest that the crosstalk between SDG711-mediated H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, and H3K9ac are involved in starch accumulation to control normal seed development.
