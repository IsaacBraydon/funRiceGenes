COP1|PPS|OsCOP1	OsCSN1	OsCSN1 regulates the growth of rice seedlings through the GA signaling pathway in blue light.	 OsCSN1 regulates the nuclear localization of COP1 through the COP9 signaling complex and degrades SLR1 through CUL4-based E3 ligase
OsCSN1	SLR1|OsGAI|OsSLR1	OsCSN1 regulates the growth of rice seedlings through the GA signaling pathway in blue light.	 Blue light regulates the degradation of SLR1 through OsCSN1, which regulates the growth and development of rice seedling height, the first incomplete leaf, and the coleoptile
