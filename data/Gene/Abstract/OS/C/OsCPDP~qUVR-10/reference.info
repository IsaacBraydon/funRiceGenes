GEN17141941.pdf	qUVR-10, a major quantitative trait locus for ultraviolet-B resistance in rice, encodes cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase	2005	Genetics	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan. uechu@nias.affrc.go.jp	Rice qUVR-10, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for ultraviolet-B (UVB) resistance on chromosome 10, was cloned by map-based strategy. It was detected in backcross inbred lines (BILs) derived from a cross between the japonica variety Nipponbare (UV resistant) and the indica variety Kasalath (UV sensitive). Plants homozygous for the Nipponbare allele at the qUVR-10 locus were more resistant to UVB compared with the Kasalath allele. High-resolution mapping using 1850 F(2) plants enabled us to delimit qUVR-10 to a <27-kb genomic region. We identified a gene encoding the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyase in this region. Activity of CPD photorepair in Nipponbare was higher than that of Kasalath and nearly isogenic with qUVR-10 [NIL(qUVR-10)], suggesting that the CPD photolyase of Kasalath was defective. We introduced a genomic fragment containing the CPD photolyase gene of Nipponbare to NIL(qUVR-10). Transgenic plants showed the same level of resistance as Nipponbare did, indicating that the qUVR-10 encoded the CPD photolyase. Comparison of the qUVR-10 sequence in the Nipponbare and Kasalath alleles revealed one probable candidate for the functional nucleotide polymorphism. It was indicated that single-base substitution in the CPD photolyase gene caused the alteration of activity of CPD photorepair and UVB resistance. Furthermore, we were able to develop a UV-hyperresistant plant by overexpression of the photolyase gene.

We previously indicated that UV-resistant rice cultivars are better able to repair cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) through photorepair than are UV-sensitive cultivars. In this paper, we report that UVB sensitivity in rice, in part, is the result of defective CPD photolyase alleles. Surjamkhi (indica) exhibited greater sensitivity to UVB radiation and was more deficient in CPD photorepair ability compared with UV-resistant Sasanishiki (japonica). The deficiency in CPD photorepair in Surjamkhi resulted from changes in two nucleotides at positions 377 and 888 in the photolyase gene, causing alterations of two deduced amino acids at positions 126 and 296 in the photolyase enzyme. A linkage analysis in populations derived from Surjamkhi and Sasanishiki showed that UVB sensitivity is a quantitative inherited trait and that the CPD photolyase locus is tightly linked with a quantitative trait locus that explains a major portion of the genetic variation for this trait. These results suggest that spontaneously occurring mutations in the CPD photolyase gene cause different degrees of sensitivity to UVB in rice, and that the resistance of rice to UVB radiation could be increased by increasing the photolyase function through conventional breeding or bioengineering.

Rice cultivars vary widely in their sensitivity to ultraviolet B (UVB) and this has been correlated with cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyase mutations that alter the structure/function of this photorepair enzyme. Here, we tested whether CPD photolyase function determines the UVB sensitivity of rice (Oryza sativa) by generating transgenic rice plants bearing the CPD photolyase gene of the UV-resistant rice cultivar Sasanishiki in the sense orientation (S-B and S-C lines) or the antisense orientation (AS-D line). The S-B and S-C plants had 5.1- and 45.7-fold higher CPD photolyase activities than the wild-type, respectively, were significantly more resistant to UVB-induced growth damage, and maintained significantly lower CPD levels in their leaves during growth under elevated UVB radiation. Conversely, the AS-D plant had little photolyase activity, was severely damaged by elevated UVB radiation, and maintained higher CPD levels in its leaves during growth under UVB radiation. Notably, the S-C plant was not more resistant to UVB-induced growth inhibition than the S-B plant, even though it had much higher CPD photolyase activity. These results strongly indicate that UVB-induced CPDs are one of principal causes of UVB-induced growth inhibition in rice plants grown under supplementary UVB radiation, and that increasing CPD photolyase activity can significantly alleviate UVB-caused growth inhibition in rice. However, further protection from UVB-induced damage may require the genetic enhancement of other systems as well.
j.1365-313X.2011.04500.x.pdf	Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyase repairs ultraviolet-B-induced CPDs in rice chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA	2011	Plant J	Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8577, Japan.	Plants use sunlight as energy for photosynthesis; however, plant DNA is exposed to the harmful effects of ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation (280-320 nm) in the process. UV-B radiation damages nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA by the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), which are the primary UV-B-induced DNA lesions, and are a principal cause of UV-B-induced growth inhibition in plants. Repair of CPDs is therefore essential for plant survival while exposed to UV-B-containing sunlight. Nuclear repair of the UV-B-induced CPDs involves the photoreversal of CPDs, photoreactivation, which is mediated by CPD photolyase that monomerizes the CPDs in DNA by using the energy of near-UV and visible light (300-500 nm). To date, the CPD repair processes in plant chloroplasts and mitochondria remain poorly understood. Here, we report the photoreactivation of CPDs in chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA in rice. Biochemical and subcellular localization analyses using rice strains with different levels of CPD photolyase activity and transgenic rice strains showed that full-length CPD photolyase is encoded by a single gene, not a splice variant, and is expressed and targeted not only to nuclei but also to chloroplasts and mitochondria. The results indicate that rice may have evolved a CPD photolyase that functions in chloroplasts, mitochondria and nuclei, and that contains DNA to protect cells from the harmful effects of UV-B radiation.
PC12091569.pdf	UV radiation-sensitive norin 1 rice contains defective cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase	2000	Plant Cell	Institute of Genetic Ecology, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8577, Japan.	Norin 1, a progenitor of many economically important Japanese rice strains, is highly sensitive to the damaging effects of UVB radiation (wavelengths 290 to 320 nm). Norin 1 seedlings are deficient in photorepair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. However, the molecular origin of this deficiency was not known and, because rice photolyase genes have not been cloned and sequenced, could not be determined by examining photolyase structural genes or upstream regulatory elements for mutations. We therefore used a photoflash approach, which showed that the deficiency in photorepair in vivo resulted from a functionally altered photolyase. These results were confirmed by studies with extracts, which showed that the Norin 1 photolyase-dimer complex was highly thermolabile relative to the wild-type Sasanishiki photolyase. This deficiency results from a structure/function alteration of photolyase rather than of nonspecific repair, photolytic, or regulatory elements. Thus, the molecular origin of this plant DNA repair deficiency, resulting from a spontaneously occurring mutation to UV radiation sensitivity, is defective photolyase.
Plant Cell Physiol-2004-Teranishi-1848-56.pdf	Ultraviolet-B sensitivities in Japanese lowland rice cultivars: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase activity and gene mutation	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Environmental Life Sciences, Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, 980-8577 Japan.	There is a cultivar difference in the response to ultraviolet-B (UVB: 280-320 nm) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Among Japanese lowland rice cultivars, Sasanishiki, a leading Japanese rice cultivar, is resistant to the damaging effects of UVB while Norin 1, a close relative, is less resistant. We found previously that Norin 1 was deficient in cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photorepair ability and suggested that the UVB sensitivity in rice depends largely on CPD photorepair ability. In order to verify that suggestion, we examined the correlation between UVB sensitivity and CPD photolyase activity in 17 rice cultivars of progenitors and relatives in breeding of UV-resistant Sasanishiki and UV-sensitive Norin 1. The amino acid at position 126 of the deduced amino acid sequence of CPD photolyase in cultivars including such as Norin 1 was found to be arginine, the CPD photolyase activities of which were lower. The amino acid at that position in cultivars including such as Sasanishiki was glutamine. Furthermore, cultivars more resistant to UVB were found to exhibit higher photolyase activities than less resistant cultivars. These results emphasize that single amino acid alteration from glutamine to arginine leads to a deficit of CPD photolyase activity and that CPD photolyase activity is one of the main factors determining UVB sensitivity in rice.
pp1461941.pdf	The native cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase of rice is phosphorylated	2008	Plant Physiol	Department of Environmental Life Sciences , Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8577, Japan. tera@ige.tohoku.ac.jp	The cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) is a major type of DNA damage induced by ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. CPD photolyase, which absorbs blue/UVA light as an energy source to monomerize dimers, is a crucial factor for determining the sensitivity of rice (Oryza sativa) to UVB radiation. Here, we purified native class II CPD photolyase from rice leaves. As the final purification step, CPD photolyase was bound to CPD-containing DNA conjugated to magnetic beads and then released by blue-light irradiation. The final purified fraction contained 54- and 56-kD proteins, whereas rice CPD photolyase expressed from Escherichia coli was a single 55-kD protein. Western-blot analysis using anti-rice CPD photolyase antiserum suggested that both the 54- and 56-kD proteins were the CPD photolyase. Treatment with protein phosphatase revealed that the 56-kD native rice CPD photolyase was phosphorylated, whereas the E. coli-expressed rice CPD photolyase was not. The purified native rice CPD photolyase also had significantly higher CPD photorepair activity than the E. coli-expressed CPD photolyase. According to the absorption, emission, and excitation spectra, the purified native rice CPD photolyase possesses both a pterin-like chromophore and an FAD chromophore. The binding activity of the native rice CPD photolyase to thymine dimers was higher than that of the E. coli-expressed CPD photolyase. These results suggest that the structure of the native rice CPD photolyase differs significantly from that of the E. coli-expressed rice CPD photolyase, and the structural modification of the native CPD photolyase leads to higher activity in rice.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs00438-003-0856-9.pdf	A gene for a Class II DNA photolyase from Oryza sativa: cloning of the cDNA by dilution-amplification	2003	Mol Genet Genomics	Department of Molecular Biosciences, Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, 980-8577 Sendai, Japan.	Ultraviolet radiation induces the formation of two classes of photoproducts in DNA-the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) and the pyrimidine [6-4] pyrimidone photoproduct (6-4 product). Many organisms produce enzymes, termed photolyases, which specifically bind to these lesions and split them via a UV-A/blue light-dependent mechanism, thereby reversing the damage. These photolyases are specific for either CPDs or 6-4 products. Two classes of photolyases (class I and class II) repair CPDs. A gene that encodes a protein with class II CPD photolyase activity in vitro has been cloned from several plants including Arabidopsis thaliana, Cucumis sativus and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We report here the isolation of a homolog of this gene from rice (Oryza sativa), which was cloned on the basis of sequence similarity and PCR-based dilution-amplification. The cDNA comprises a very GC-rich (75%) 5; region, while the 3; portion has a GC content of 50%. This gene encodes a protein with CPD photolyase activity when expressed in E. coli. The CPD photolyase gene encodes at least two types of mRNA, formed by alternative splicing of exon 5. One of the mRNAs encodes an ORF for 506 amino acid residues, while the other is predicted to code for 364 amino acid residues. The two RNAs occur in about equal amounts in O. sativa cells.
