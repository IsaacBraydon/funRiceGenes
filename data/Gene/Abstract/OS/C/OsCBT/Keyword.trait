OsCBT	growth	The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice	 The oscbt-1 mutant exhibits reduced levels of OsCBT transcripts and no significant morphological changes compared to wild-type plant although the growth of the mutant is stunted
OsCBT	transcription factor	The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice	The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice
OsCBT	defense response	The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice	The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice
OsCBT	leaf	Isolation of a calmodulin-binding transcription factor from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 OsCBT was able to bind this sequence and activate beta-glucuronidase reporter gene expression driven by a minimal promoter containing tandem repeats of these sequences in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts
OsCBT	defense	The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice	" Taken together, the results support an idea that OsCBT might act as a negative regulator on plant defense|The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice"
OsCBT	transcription factor	Isolation of a calmodulin-binding transcription factor from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 This factor, which we have designated OsCBT (Oryza sativa CaM-binding transcription factor), has structural features similar to Arabidopsis AtSRs/AtCAMTAs and encodes a 103-kDa protein because it contains a CG-1 homology DNA-binding domain, three ankyrin repeats, a putative transcriptional activation domain, and five putative CaM-binding motifs
