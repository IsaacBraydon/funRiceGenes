NA	Clock component OsPRR73 positively regulates rice salt tolerance by modulating OsHKT2;1-mediated sodium homeostasis	2020	EMBO J .	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	The roles of clock components in salt stress tolerance remain incompletely characterized in rice. Here, we show that, among OsPRR (Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator) family members, OsPRR73 specifically confers salt tolerance in rice. Notably, the grain size and yield of osprr73 null mutants were significantly decreased in the presence of salt stress, with accumulated higher level of reactive oxygen species and sodium ions. RNA sequencing and biochemical assays identified OsHKT2;1, encoding a plasma membrane-localized Na+ transporter, as a transcriptional target of OsPRR73 in mediating salt tolerance. Correspondingly, null mutants of OsHKT2;1 displayed an increased tolerance to salt stress. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays further identified HDAC10 as nuclear interactor of OsPRR73 and co-repressor of OsHKT2;1. Consistently, H3K9ac histone marks at OsHKT2;1 promoter regions were significantly reduced in osprr73 mutant. Together, our findings reveal that salt-induced OsPRR73 expression confers salt tolerance by recruiting HDAC10 to transcriptionally repress OsHKT2;1, thus reducing cellular Na+ accumulation. This exemplifies a new molecular link between clock components and salt stress tolerance in rice.
NA	The rice transcription factor Nhd1 regulates root growth and nitrogen uptake by activating nitrogen transporters.	2022	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Plants adjust root architecture and nitrogen (N) transporter activity to meet the variable N demand, but their integrated regulatory mechanism remains unclear. We have previously reported that a floral factor in rice (Oryza sativa), N-mediated heading date-1 (Nhd1), regulates flowering time. Here, we show that Nhd1 can directly activate the transcription of the high-affinity ammonium (NH4+) transporter 1;3 (OsAMT1;3) and the dual affinity nitrate (NO3-) transporter 2.4 or a low concentration of NH4+. Compared to the wild-type (WT), nhd1 and osamt1;3 mutants showed a similar decrease in root growth and N uptake under low NH4+ supply, while nhd1 and osnrt2.4 mutants showed comparable root inhibition and translocation in shoots. The defects of nhd1 mutants in NH4+ uptake and root growth response to various N supplies were restored by overexpression of OsAMT1;3 or OsNRT2.4. However, when grown in a paddy field with low N availability, nhd1 mutants accumulated more N and achieved a higher N uptake efficiency (NUpE) due to the delayed flowering time and prolonged growth period. Our findings reveal a molecular mechanism underlying the growth duration-dependent NUpE.
NA	Rice CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 transcriptionally regulates ABA signaling to confer multiple abiotic stress tolerance.	2022	Plant Physiol	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	The circadian clock facilitates the survival and reproduction of crop plants under harsh environmental conditions such as drought and osmotic and salinity stresses, mainly by reprogramming the endogenous transcriptional landscape. Nevertheless, the genome-wide roles of core clock components in rice (Oryza sativa L.) abiotic stress tolerance are largely uncharacterized. Here, we report that CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (OsCCA1), a vital clock component in rice, is required for tolerance to salinity, osmotic, and drought stresses. DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq) coupled with transcriptome analysis identified 692 direct transcriptional target genes of OsCCA1. Among them, the genes involved in ABA signaling, including group A PP2C (protein phosphatase 2C) genes and OsbZIP46 (basic region and leucine zipper 46), were substantially enriched. Moreover, OsCCA1 could directly bind the promoters of OsPP108 and OsbZIP46 to activate their expression. Consistently, oscca1 null mutants generated via genome editing displayed enhanced sensitivities to ABA signaling. Together, our findings illustrate that OsCCA1 confers multiple abiotic stress tolerance likely by orchestrating ABA signaling, which links the circadian clock with ABA signaling in rice.
NA	Natural alleles of CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 contribute to rice cultivation by fine-tuning flowering time.	2022	Plant Physiol	Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Bioresources, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences,Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, South Korea.	The timing of flowering is a crucial factor for successful grain production at a wide range of latitudes. Domestication of rice (Oryza sativa) included selection for natural alleles of flowering-time genes that allow rice plants to adapt to broad geographic areas. Here, we describe the role of natural alleles of CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (OsCCA1) in cultivated rice based on analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms deposited in the International Rice Genebank Collection Information System database. Rice varieties harboring japonica-type OsCCA1 alleles (OsCCA1a haplotype) flowered earlier than those harboring indica-type OsCCA1 alleles (OsCCA1d haplotype). In the japonica cultivar &#x27;Dongjin&#x27;, a T-DNA insertion in OsCCA1a resulted in late flowering under long-day and short-day conditions, indicating that OsCCA1 is a floral inducer. RT-qPCR analysis showed that the loss of OsCCA1a function induces the expression of the floral repressors PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 37 (OsPRR37) and Days to Heading 8 (DTH8), followed by repression of the Early heading date 1 (Ehd1)-Heading date 3a (Hd3a)-RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1) pathway. Binding affinity assays indicated that OsCCA1 binds to the promoter regions of OsPRR37 and DTH8. Naturally occurring OsCCA1 alleles are evolutionarily conserved in cultivated rice (O. sativa). Oryza rufipogon-I (Or-I) and Or-III type accessions, representing the and japonica-type OsCCA1 alleles, respectively. Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsCCA1 is a likely domestication locus that has contributed to the geographic adaptation and expansion of cultivated rice.
