OsCCA1|Nhd1	OsHUB2|FRRP1	OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.	 The expression of Hd3a, RFT1, and Ehd1 was induced and the transcript levels of Hd1, Ghd7, OsCCA1, OsGI, OsFKF1, and OsTOC1 were reduced under long-day conditions, whereas RFT1 and Ehd1 expression was induced in oshub2 mutants under short-day conditions
OsAMT1;3|OsAMT1.3	OsCCA1|Nhd1	The rice transcription factor Nhd1 regulates root growth and nitrogen uptake by activating nitrogen transporters.	 Here, we show that Nhd1 can directly activate the transcription of the high-affinity ammonium (NH4+) transporter 1;3 (OsAMT1;3) and the dual affinity nitrate (NO3-) transporter 2
OsAMT1;3|OsAMT1.3	OsCCA1|Nhd1	The rice transcription factor Nhd1 regulates root growth and nitrogen uptake by activating nitrogen transporters.	 Compared to the wild-type (WT), nhd1 and osamt1;3 mutants showed a similar decrease in root growth and N uptake under low NH4+ supply, while nhd1 and osnrt2
OsAMT1;3|OsAMT1.3	OsCCA1|Nhd1	The rice transcription factor Nhd1 regulates root growth and nitrogen uptake by activating nitrogen transporters.	 The defects of nhd1 mutants in NH4+ uptake and root growth response to various N supplies were restored by overexpression of OsAMT1;3 or OsNRT2
OsCCA1|Nhd1	OsNRT2.4	The rice transcription factor Nhd1 regulates root growth and nitrogen uptake by activating nitrogen transporters	Here, we show that Nhd1 can directly activate the transcription of the high-affinity ammonium (NH4+) transporter 1;3 (OsAMT1;3) and the dual affinity nitrate (NO3-) transporter 2.4 (OsNRT2.4).
