OsCCA1	OsHUB2|FRRP1	OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.	 The expression of Hd3a, RFT1, and Ehd1 was induced and the transcript levels of Hd1, Ghd7, OsCCA1, OsGI, OsFKF1, and OsTOC1 were reduced under long-day conditions, whereas RFT1 and Ehd1 expression was induced in oshub2 mutants under short-day conditions
