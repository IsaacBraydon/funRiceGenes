OsCCA1|Nhd1	 The defects of nhd1 mutants in NH4+ uptake and root growth response to various N supplies were restored by overexpression of OsAMT1;3 or OsNRT2	 The defects of nhd1 mutants in NH4+ uptake and root growth response to various N supplies were restored by overexpression of OsAMT1;3 or OsNRT2
OsCCA1|Nhd1	Rice circadian clock regulator Nhd1 controls the expression of the sucrose transporter gene OsSUT1 and impacts carbon-nitrogen balance. |  Leaf RNA-seq analysis indicated that mutation of Nhd1 dramatically altered expression of the genes linked to starch and sucrose metabolism, circadian rhythm, and amino acid metabolic pathways |  We identified that Nhd1 can directly activate the transcriptional expression of sucrose transporter-1 (OsSUT1) |  Knockout of Nhd1 suppressed OsSUT1 expression, and both nhd1 and ossut1 mutants showed similar shorter height, and lower shoot biomass and sucrose concentration in comparison with the wild type, while overexpression of OsSUT1 can restore the defective sucrose transport and partially ameliorate the reduced growth of nhd1 mutants |  The positively related variation of Nhd1 and OsSUT1 expression among randomly selected indica and japonica varieties suggests a common regulatory module of Nhd1-OsSUT1-mediated C and N balance in rice	 Knockout of Nhd1 suppressed OsSUT1 expression, and both nhd1 and ossut1 mutants showed similar shorter height, and lower shoot biomass and sucrose concentration in comparison with the wild type, while overexpression of OsSUT1 can restore the defective sucrose transport and partially ameliorate the reduced growth of nhd1 mutants
