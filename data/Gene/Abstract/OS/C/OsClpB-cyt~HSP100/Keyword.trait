HSP101|OsClpB-cyt|HSP100	seedling	A positive feedback loop between HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN101 and HEAT STRESS-ASSOCIATED 32-KD PROTEIN modulates long-term acquired thermotolerance illustrating diverse heat stress responses in rice varieties	 Our results showed that a positive feedback loop formed by two heat-inducible genes, HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN101 (HSP101) and HEAT STRESS-ASSOCIATED 32-KD PROTEIN (HSA32), at the posttranscriptional level prolongs the effect of heat acclimation in rice seedlings
HSP101|OsClpB-cyt|HSP100	arsenite	Molecular characterization of rice hsp101: complementation of yeast hsp104 mutation by disaggregation of protein granules and differential expression in indica and japonica rice types	 Rice hsp101 cDNA expression in hsp104 deficient yeast also caused recovery in tolerance against arsenite
HSP101|OsClpB-cyt|HSP100	seed	A positive feedback loop between HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN101 and HEAT STRESS-ASSOCIATED 32-KD PROTEIN modulates long-term acquired thermotolerance illustrating diverse heat stress responses in rice varieties	 Our results showed that a positive feedback loop formed by two heat-inducible genes, HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN101 (HSP101) and HEAT STRESS-ASSOCIATED 32-KD PROTEIN (HSA32), at the posttranscriptional level prolongs the effect of heat acclimation in rice seedlings| The interplay between HSP101 and HSA32 also affects basal thermotolerance of rice seeds
HSP101|OsClpB-cyt|HSP100	seedling	Molecular characterization of rice hsp101: complementation of yeast hsp104 mutation by disaggregation of protein granules and differential expression in indica and japonica rice types	 In the temperature regime tested, 45 degrees C treatment to intact rice seedlings for 2 h showed maximal levels of hsp101 mRNA
HSP101|OsClpB-cyt|HSP100	flower	OsHsfA2c and OsHsfB4b are involved in the transcriptional regulation of cytoplasmic OsClpB (Hsp100) gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Transgenic rice plants produced with 2 kb OsClpB-cyt promoter driving Gus reporter gene showed heat- and metal-regulated Gus expression in vegetative tissues and constitutive Gus expression in calli, flowering tissues, and embryonal half of seeds
HSP101|OsClpB-cyt|HSP100	seed	Genome-wide analysis of rice ClpB/HSP100, ClpC and ClpD genes	 OsClpB-cyt transcript is shown to be enriched at milk and dough stages of seed development
HSP101|OsClpB-cyt|HSP100	seedling	OsHsfA2c and OsHsfB4b are involved in the transcriptional regulation of cytoplasmic OsClpB (Hsp100) gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Rice seedlings regenerated with OsClpB-cyt promoter fragment with deletion of its canonical heat shock element sequence (HSE(-273 to -280)) showed not only heat shock inducibility of Gus transcript/protein but also constitutive expression of Gus in vegetative tissues
HSP101|OsClpB-cyt|HSP100	vegetative	OsHsfA2c and OsHsfB4b are involved in the transcriptional regulation of cytoplasmic OsClpB (Hsp100) gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Transgenic rice plants produced with 2 kb OsClpB-cyt promoter driving Gus reporter gene showed heat- and metal-regulated Gus expression in vegetative tissues and constitutive Gus expression in calli, flowering tissues, and embryonal half of seeds| Rice seedlings regenerated with OsClpB-cyt promoter fragment with deletion of its canonical heat shock element sequence (HSE(-273 to -280)) showed not only heat shock inducibility of Gus transcript/protein but also constitutive expression of Gus in vegetative tissues
HSP101|OsClpB-cyt|HSP100	chloroplast	Complexity of rice Hsp100 gene family: lessons from rice genome sequence data	 While Os05g44340 encodes cytoplasmic Hsp100 protein, those encoded by the other four genes are predicted to have chloroplast transit peptides
HSP101|OsClpB-cyt|HSP100	seed	OsHsfA2c and OsHsfB4b are involved in the transcriptional regulation of cytoplasmic OsClpB (Hsp100) gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Transgenic rice plants produced with 2 kb OsClpB-cyt promoter driving Gus reporter gene showed heat- and metal-regulated Gus expression in vegetative tissues and constitutive Gus expression in calli, flowering tissues, and embryonal half of seeds| Rice seedlings regenerated with OsClpB-cyt promoter fragment with deletion of its canonical heat shock element sequence (HSE(-273 to -280)) showed not only heat shock inducibility of Gus transcript/protein but also constitutive expression of Gus in vegetative tissues
