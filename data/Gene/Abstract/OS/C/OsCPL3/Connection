GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OsCPL3	OsCPL3 is involved in brassinosteroid signaling by regulating OsGSK2 stability.	OsCPL3 is involved in brassinosteroid signaling by regulating OsGSK2 stability.
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OsCPL3	OsCPL3 is involved in brassinosteroid signaling by regulating OsGSK2 stability.	 Here, we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo that C-TERMINAL DOMAIN PHOSPHATASE-LIKE 3 (OsCPL3), a member of the RNA Pol II CTD phosphatase-like family, physically interacts with OsGSK2 in rice (Oryza sativa)
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OsCPL3	OsCPL3 is involved in brassinosteroid signaling by regulating OsGSK2 stability.	 OsCPL3 localized to the nucleus, where it dephosphorylated OsGSK2 at the Ser-222 and Thr-284 residues to modulate its protein turnover and kinase activity, in turn affecting the degradation of BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) and BR signaling
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OsCPL3	OsCPL3 is involved in brassinosteroid signaling by regulating OsGSK2 stability.	 Loss of OsCPL3 function resulted in higher OsGSK2 abundance and lower OsBZR1 levels, leading to decreased BR responsiveness and alterations in plant morphology including semi-dwarfism, leaf erectness and grain size, which are of fundamental importance to crop productivity
OsBZR1|BZR1	OsCPL3	OsCPL3 is involved in brassinosteroid signaling by regulating OsGSK2 stability.	 Loss of OsCPL3 function resulted in higher OsGSK2 abundance and lower OsBZR1 levels, leading to decreased BR responsiveness and alterations in plant morphology including semi-dwarfism, leaf erectness and grain size, which are of fundamental importance to crop productivity
