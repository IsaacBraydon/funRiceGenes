OsCBL10	 Furthermore, the OsCBL10 overexpression lines were sensitive to both flooding and hypoxic treatments during rice germination with enhanced Ca2+flow in comparison to wild type |  In summary, our results suggest that the adaptation to flooding stress during rice germination is associated with two different OsCBL10 promoters, which in turn affect OsCBL10 expression in different cultivars and negatively affect OsCIPK15 protein accumulation and its downstream cascade	 Furthermore, the OsCBL10 overexpression lines were sensitive to both flooding and hypoxic treatments during rice germination with enhanced Ca2+flow in comparison to wild type
