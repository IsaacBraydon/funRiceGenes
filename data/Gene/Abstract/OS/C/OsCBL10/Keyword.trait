OsCBL10	tolerance	Natural variation in the promoter of rice Calcineurin B-like Protein10 (OsCBL10) affects flooding tolerance during seed germination among rice subspecies.	 We observed that variations in the OsCBL10 promoter sequences in these two cultivars might contribute to this divergence in flooding tolerance
OsCBL10	stress	Natural variation in the promoter of rice Calcineurin B-like Protein10 (OsCBL10) affects flooding tolerance during seed germination among rice subspecies.	 In summary, our results suggest that the adaptation to flooding stress during rice germination is associated with two different OsCBL10 promoters, which in turn affect OsCBL10 expression in different cultivars and negatively affect OsCIPK15 protein accumulation and its downstream cascade
