OsCBL10	OsCIPK15	Natural variation in the promoter of rice Calcineurin B-like Protein10 (OsCBL10) affects flooding tolerance during seed germination among rice subspecies.	 Subsequent findings also indicate that OsCBL10 may affect OsCIPK15 protein abundance and its downstream pathways
OsCBL10	OsCIPK15	Natural variation in the promoter of rice Calcineurin B-like Protein10 (OsCBL10) affects flooding tolerance during seed germination among rice subspecies.	 In summary, our results suggest that the adaptation to flooding stress during rice germination is associated with two different OsCBL10 promoters, which in turn affect OsCBL10 expression in different cultivars and negatively affect OsCIPK15 protein accumulation and its downstream cascade
