OsCCS52B	cell cycle	Functional characterization of a B-type cell cycle switch 52 in rice (OsCCS52B)	In this study, a rice cell cycle switch 52 B (OsCCS52B) was functionally characterized using two approaches: overexpression of the gene product in fission yeast and characterization of an insertion mutant line 1B-10423
OsCCS52B	cell cycle	Functional characterization of a B-type cell cycle switch 52 in rice (OsCCS52B)	Functional characterization of a B-type cell cycle switch 52 in rice (OsCCS52B)
OsCCS52B	flower	Functional characterization of a B-type cell cycle switch 52 in rice (OsCCS52B)	In wild-type plants, OsCCS52B is highly expressed in generative organs such as flowers and kernels
OsCCS52B	endosperm	Functional characterization of a B-type cell cycle switch 52 in rice (OsCCS52B)	These results suggest that OsCCS52B may be involved in cell expansion regulation in rice endosperm
OsCCS52B	cell elongation	Functional characterization of a B-type cell cycle switch 52 in rice (OsCCS52B)	Overexpression of OsCCS52B induces cell elongation and slower cell proliferation in fission yeast
