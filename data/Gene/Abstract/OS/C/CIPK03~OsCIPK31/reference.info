Calcineurin B-like protein-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) are a group of typical Ser/Thr protein kinases that mediate calcium signals. Extensive studies using Arabidopsis plants have demonstrated that many calcium signatures that activate CIPKs originate from abiotic stresses. However, there are few reports on the functional demonstration of CIPKs in other plants, especially in grasses. In this study, we used a loss-of-function mutation to characterize the function of the rice CIPK gene OsCIPK31. Exposure to high concentrations of NaCl or mannitol effected a rapid and transient enhancement of OsCIPK31 expression. These findings were observed only in the light. However, longer exposure to most stresses resulted in downregulation of OsCIPK31 expression in both the presence and absence of light. To determine the physiological roles of OsCIPK31 in rice plants, the sensitivity of oscipk31::Ds, which is a transposon Ds insertion mutant, to abiotic stresses was examined during germination and seedling stages. oscipk31::Ds mutants exhibited hypersensitive phenotypes to ABA, salt, mannitol, and glucose. Compared with wild-type rice plants, mutants exhibited retarded germination and slow seedling growth. In addition, oscipk31::Ds seedlings exhibited enhanced expression of several stress-responsive genes after exposure to these abiotic stresses. However, the expression of ABA metabolic genes and the endogenous levels of ABA were not altered significantly in the oscipk31::Ds mutant. This study demonstrated that rice plants use OsCIPK31 to modulate responses to abiotic stresses during the seed germination and seedling stages and to modulate the expression of stress-responsive genes.

Calcium signals mediate a multitude of plant responses to external stimuli and regulate a wide range of physiological processes. Calcium-binding proteins, like calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins, represent important relays in plant calcium signaling. These proteins form a complex network with their target kinases being the CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). Here, we present a comparative genomics analysis of the full complement of CBLs and CIPKs in Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa). We confirm the expression and transcript composition of the 10 CBLs and 25 CIPKs encoded in the Arabidopsis genome. Our identification of 10 CBLs and 30 CIPKs from rice indicates a similar complexity of this signaling network in both species. An analysis of the genomic evolution suggests that the extant number of gene family members largely results from segmental duplications. A phylogenetic comparison of protein sequences and intron positions indicates an early diversification of separate branches within both gene families. These branches may represent proteins with different functions. Protein interaction analyses and expression studies of closely related family members suggest that even recently duplicated representatives may fulfill different functions. This work provides a basis for a defined further functional dissection of this important plant-specific signaling system.

Plants respond to adverse environments by initiating a series of signaling processes that often involves diverse protein kinases, including calcineurin B-like protein-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). In this study, putative CIPK genes (OsCIPK01-OsCIPK30) in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome were surveyed for their transcriptional responses to various abiotic stresses. The results showed that 20 OsCIPK genes were differentially induced by at least one of the stresses, including drought, salinity, cold, polyethylene glycol, and abscisic acid treatment. Most of the genes induced by drought or salt stress were also induced by abscisic acid treatment but not by cold. A few CIPK genes containing none of the reported stress-responsive cis-elements in their promoter regions were also induced by multiple stresses. To prove that some of these stress-responsive OsCIPK genes are potentially useful for stress-tolerance improvement, three CIPK genes (OsCIPK03, OsCIPK12, and OsCIPK15) were overexpressed in japonica rice 'Zhonghua 11'. Transgenic plants overexpressing the transgenes OsCIPK03, OsCIPK12, and OsCIPK15 showed significantly improved tolerance to cold, drought, and salt stress, respectively. Under cold and drought stresses, OsCIPK03- and OsCIPK12-overexpressing transgenic plants accumulated significantly higher contents of proline and soluble sugars than the wild type. Putative proline synthetase and transporter genes had significantly higher expression level in the transgenic plants than in the wild type. The differentially induced expression of OsCIPK genes by different stresses and the examples of improved stress tolerance of the OsCIPK transgenic rice suggest that rice CIPK genes have diverse roles in different stress responses and some of them may possess potential usefulness in stress-tolerance improvement of rice.

We have isolated a cold-inducible gene (designated OsCK1) from Oryza sativa by a differential cDNA screening technique. Sequence analysis indicated that the open reading frame of the OsCK1 gene consists of 1350 bp encoding 449 amino acid residues, which is very similar to a family of calcineurin B-like protein (CBL)-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) or salt overly sensitive 2 (SOS2)-like protein kinases (PKS) in Arabidopsis. CIPKs/PKS are a group of Ser/Thr protein kinases associated with the AtCBL/SOS3-like calcium-binding proteins (SCaBP). OsCK1 actually interacts with AtCBL3 through the C-terminal region in a yeast two-hybrid system, suggesting that OsCK1 is probably a rice orthologue of one of the CIPK/PKS members. Expression of the OsCK1 gene was detected mainly in the shoots and highly inducible by diverse signals such as cold, light, salt, sugar and cytokinins. In addition, calcium increased the OsCK1 transcript level, whereas a calcium ionophore, A23187, partially abolished stimulus-induced expressions. OsCK1 phosphorylated itself and a generic substrate, myelin basic protein, in the preference of Mn2+. Deletion of the C-terminal region from OsCK1 significantly decreased autophosphorylation activity without affecting the ability for substrate phosphorylation. These findings suggest that the CBL/CIPK or SCaBP/PKS signaling pathways recently found in Arabidopsis may also exist in rice and function in cold response in which calcium signal serves as a second messenger.
