OsCIPK12	OsCK1|OsCIPK31|CIPK03	Characterization of stress-responsive CIPK genes in rice for stress tolerance improvement	 To prove that some of these stress-responsive OsCIPK genes are potentially useful for stress-tolerance improvement, three CIPK genes (OsCIPK03, OsCIPK12, and OsCIPK15) were overexpressed in japonica rice 'Zhonghua 11'
OsCIPK12	OsCK1|OsCIPK31|CIPK03	Characterization of stress-responsive CIPK genes in rice for stress tolerance improvement	 Transgenic plants overexpressing the transgenes OsCIPK03, OsCIPK12, and OsCIPK15 showed significantly improved tolerance to cold, drought, and salt stress, respectively
OsCIPK12	OsCK1|OsCIPK31|CIPK03	Characterization of stress-responsive CIPK genes in rice for stress tolerance improvement	 Under cold and drought stresses, OsCIPK03- and OsCIPK12-overexpressing transgenic plants accumulated significantly higher contents of proline and soluble sugars than the wild type
OsCIPK15	OsCK1|OsCIPK31|CIPK03	Characterization of stress-responsive CIPK genes in rice for stress tolerance improvement	 To prove that some of these stress-responsive OsCIPK genes are potentially useful for stress-tolerance improvement, three CIPK genes (OsCIPK03, OsCIPK12, and OsCIPK15) were overexpressed in japonica rice 'Zhonghua 11'
