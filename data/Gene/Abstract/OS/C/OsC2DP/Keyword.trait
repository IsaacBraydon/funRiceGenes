OsC2DP	shoot	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 Knockout of OsC2DP did not affect Na+ concentration in the roots, but increased shoot Na+ concentration, resulting in a significant sensitivity of rice to salt stress
OsC2DP	salt	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 Here, we reported a novel C2 domain-containing protein, OsC2DP required for salt tolerance in rice
OsC2DP	salt	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 OsC2DP was predominately expressed in the roots and its expression was repressed by salt stress
OsC2DP	salt	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 Immunostaining further showed that OsC2DP was able to translocate from the cytosol to plasma membrane under salt conditions
