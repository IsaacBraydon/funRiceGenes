OsC2DP	shoot	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 Knockout of OsC2DP did not affect Na+ concentration in the roots, but increased shoot Na+ concentration, resulting in a significant sensitivity of rice to salt stress
OsC2DP	salt	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 Here, we reported a novel C2 domain-containing protein, OsC2DP required for salt tolerance in rice
OsC2DP	salt	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 OsC2DP was predominately expressed in the roots and its expression was repressed by salt stress
OsC2DP	salt	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 Immunostaining further showed that OsC2DP was able to translocate from the cytosol to plasma membrane under salt conditions
OsC2DP	salt	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 Knockout of OsC2DP did not affect Na+ concentration in the roots, but increased shoot Na+ concentration, resulting in a significant sensitivity of rice to salt stress
OsC2DP	salt	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 These results indicate that OsC2DP has an important role in salt tolerance and these findings provide new insights into the regulation of OsC2DP gene for rice breeding with high salt tolerance
OsC2DP	tolerance	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 Here, we reported a novel C2 domain-containing protein, OsC2DP required for salt tolerance in rice
OsC2DP	tolerance	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 These results indicate that OsC2DP has an important role in salt tolerance and these findings provide new insights into the regulation of OsC2DP gene for rice breeding with high salt tolerance
OsC2DP	salt tolerance	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 Here, we reported a novel C2 domain-containing protein, OsC2DP required for salt tolerance in rice
OsC2DP	salt tolerance	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 These results indicate that OsC2DP has an important role in salt tolerance and these findings provide new insights into the regulation of OsC2DP gene for rice breeding with high salt tolerance
OsC2DP	salt stress	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 OsC2DP was predominately expressed in the roots and its expression was repressed by salt stress
OsC2DP	salt stress	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 Knockout of OsC2DP did not affect Na+ concentration in the roots, but increased shoot Na+ concentration, resulting in a significant sensitivity of rice to salt stress
OsC2DP	stress	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 OsC2DP was predominately expressed in the roots and its expression was repressed by salt stress
OsC2DP	stress	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 Knockout of OsC2DP did not affect Na+ concentration in the roots, but increased shoot Na+ concentration, resulting in a significant sensitivity of rice to salt stress
OsC2DP	breeding	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 These results indicate that OsC2DP has an important role in salt tolerance and these findings provide new insights into the regulation of OsC2DP gene for rice breeding with high salt tolerance
OsC2DP	plasma membrane	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 Immunostaining further showed that OsC2DP was able to translocate from the cytosol to plasma membrane under salt conditions
