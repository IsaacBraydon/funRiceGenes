Symbol	Expression
OsC2DP	 OsC2DP was predominately expressed in the roots and its expression was repressed by salt stress |  Transient expression of OsC2DP in rice protoplast cells showed that it was localized in the cytosol |  Furthermore, the qRT-PCR and transcriptomic analysis showed that the expression level of some genes related to salt tolerance were indirectly regulated by OsC2DP, especially OsSOS1 and OsNHX4
