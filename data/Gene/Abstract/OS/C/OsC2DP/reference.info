Salt stress is one of the major factors limiting crop production globally, including rice (Oryza sativa). Although a number of genes involved in salt tolerance have been functionally identified, the mechanism underlying salt tolerance in rice is still poorly understood. Here, we reported a novel C2 domain-containing protein, OsC2DP required for salt tolerance in rice. OsC2DP was predominately expressed in the roots and its expression was repressed by salt stress. Transient expression of OsC2DP in rice protoplast cells showed that it was localized in the cytosol. Immunostaining further showed that OsC2DP was able to translocate from the cytosol to plasma membrane under salt conditions. Knockout of OsC2DP did not affect Na+ concentration in the roots, but increased shoot Na+ concentration, resulting in a significant sensitivity of rice to salt stress. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR and transcriptomic analysis showed that the expression level of some genes related to salt tolerance were indirectly regulated by OsC2DP, especially OsSOS1 and OsNHX4. These results indicate that OsC2DP has an important role in salt tolerance and these findings provide new insights into the regulation of OsC2DP gene for rice breeding with high salt tolerance.
NA	C2 domain plays critical roles in localization of novel C2 domain-containing protein OsC2DP.	2019	Plant Signal Behav	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University , Nanning , China.	OsC2DP is a cytosolic protein containing a C2 domain recently identified in rice, which is translocated to the plasma membrane in response to salt stress. Here, we further investigated the subcellular localization of OsC2DP by truncation analysis. In consistent with OsC2DP, OsC2DP1-165 containing C2 domain at the N-terminus was localized to the cytosol. In contrast to OsC2DP1-165, OsC2DP166-290 lack of C2 domain at the C-terminus was localized to the cytosol and nucleus, which was similar to the GFP control. Under salt conditions, subcellular localization of both OsC2DP1-165 and OsC2DP166-290 was not altered and failed to migrate to plasma membrane. These results indicated that the subcellular localization was determined by C2 domain of OsC2DP under normal conditions and that both N- and C-terminus of OsC2DP are essential for its cytosol-plasma membrane translocation in response to salt stress.
