OsCASP1	Overexpression of OsCASP1 Improves Calcium Tolerance in Rice |  Here, we demonstrated that OsCASP1 overexpression enhanced Ca tolerance in rice |  Furthermore, OsCASP1 overexpression resulted in earlier formation of both the CS and functional apoplastic barrier in the endodermis but did not induce ectopic CS formation in non-endodermal cell layers and affect suberin accumulation in the endodermis |  These results indicate that the overexpression of OsCASP1 promotes CS formation in endodermal cells and inhibits Ca2+ transport by the apoplastic pathway, restricting Ca accumulation in the roots and shoots under high Ca conditions |  Taken together, the results suggest that OsCASP1 overexpression is an effective way to improve rice adaptation to high Ca environments	Overexpression of OsCASP1 Improves Calcium Tolerance in Rice |  Here, we demonstrated that OsCASP1 overexpression enhanced Ca tolerance in rice |  Furthermore, OsCASP1 overexpression resulted in earlier formation of both the CS and functional apoplastic barrier in the endodermis but did not induce ectopic CS formation in non-endodermal cell layers and affect suberin accumulation in the endodermis |  These results indicate that the overexpression of OsCASP1 promotes CS formation in endodermal cells and inhibits Ca2+ transport by the apoplastic pathway, restricting Ca accumulation in the roots and shoots under high Ca conditions |  Taken together, the results suggest that OsCASP1 overexpression is an effective way to improve rice adaptation to high Ca environments
