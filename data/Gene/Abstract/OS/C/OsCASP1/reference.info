NA	OsCASP1 is required for Casparian strip formation at endodermal cells of rice roots for selective uptake of mineral elements.	2019	Plant Cell	Guangxi University CITY: Nanning China [CN].	To cope with diverse environmental conditions, rice roots have developed two Casparian strips (CS) at the exodermis and endodermis. Here, we functionally characterized OsCASP1 (Casparian strip domain protein 1) in rice. OsCASP1 was mainly expressed in the root elongation zone, and the protein encoded was first localized to all side of the plasma membrane of endodermal cells without CS, followed by to the middle of anticlinal side of endodermal cells with CS. Knockout of OsCASP1 resulted in defect of CS formation at the endodermis and decreased growth under both soil and hydroponic conditions. Mineral analysis showed that the oscasp1 mutants accumulated higher Ca, but less Mn, Zn, Fe, Cd and As in the shoots compared with the wild type. The growth inhibition of the mutants was further aggravated by high Ca. The polar localization of silicon transporter Lsi1 at the distal side of the endodermis was not altered in the mutant, but the protein abundance was decreased, resulting in significant reduction in silicon uptake. These results indicated that OsCASP1 is required for CS formation at the endodermis and that the CS in rice plays an important role in root selective uptake of mineral elements especially Ca and Si.
