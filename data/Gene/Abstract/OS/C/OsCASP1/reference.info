NA	OsCASP1 is required for Casparian strip formation at endodermal cells of rice roots for selective uptake of mineral elements.	2019	Plant Cell	Guangxi University CITY: Nanning China [CN].	To cope with diverse environmental conditions, rice roots have developed two Casparian strips (CS) at the exodermis and endodermis. Here, we functionally characterized OsCASP1 (Casparian strip domain protein 1) in rice. OsCASP1 was mainly expressed in the root elongation zone, and the protein encoded was first localized to all side of the plasma membrane of endodermal cells without CS, followed by to the middle of anticlinal side of endodermal cells with CS. Knockout of OsCASP1 resulted in defect of CS formation at the endodermis and decreased growth under both soil and hydroponic conditions. Mineral analysis showed that the oscasp1 mutants accumulated higher Ca, but less Mn, Zn, Fe, Cd and As in the shoots compared with the wild type. The growth inhibition of the mutants was further aggravated by high Ca. The polar localization of silicon transporter Lsi1 at the distal side of the endodermis was not altered in the mutant, but the protein abundance was decreased, resulting in significant reduction in silicon uptake. These results indicated that OsCASP1 is required for CS formation at the endodermis and that the CS in rice plays an important role in root selective uptake of mineral elements especially Ca and Si.
NA	Overexpression of OsCASP1 Improves Calcium Tolerance in Rice	2021	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning 530004, China.	The Casparian strip domain protein 1 (OsCASP1) is necessary for the formation of the Casparian strip (CS) in the rice endodermis. It also controls Ca2+ transport to the stele. Here, we demonstrated that OsCASP1 overexpression enhanced Ca tolerance in rice. Under normal conditions, OsCASP1-overexpressed lines showed similar concentrations of essential metals in the roots and shoots compared to the wild type, while under high Ca conditions, Ca in the roots, shoots, and xylem sap of the OsCASP1-overexpressed lines was significantly decreased. This did not apply to other essential metals. Ca-inhibited growth was significantly alleviated in the OsCASP1-overexpressed lines. Furthermore, OsCASP1 overexpression resulted in earlier formation of both the CS and functional apoplastic barrier in the endodermis but did not induce ectopic CS formation in non-endodermal cell layers and affect suberin accumulation in the endodermis. These results indicate that the overexpression of OsCASP1 promotes CS formation in endodermal cells and inhibits Ca2+ transport by the apoplastic pathway, restricting Ca accumulation in the roots and shoots under high Ca conditions. Taken together, the results suggest that OsCASP1 overexpression is an effective way to improve rice adaptation to high Ca environments.
NA	Radial transport difference mediated by root endodermal barriers contributes to differential cadmium accumulation between japonica and indica subspecies of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2021	J Hazard Mater	College of Resources, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China. Electronic address: taoqvip@163.com.	Although Cd concentration of grains is generally lower in japonica than in indica subspecies, the effects of root endodermal barriers on the subspecific differences in Cd accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa L.) are poorly understood. Here, we characterized the differences in endodermal differentiation between japonica and indica subspecies and their effects on Cd radial transport. Casparian strips (CSs) and suberin lamellae (SL) in japonica subspecies were initiated at the 6%- 7% and 21%- 27% position from the root tip, respectively, which were 65% and 26% earlier than in indica subspecies, respectively. The lignin/suberin content in japonica subspecies was 47%/42% greater than that in indica subspecies because of the higher expression of lignin/suberin biosynthesis-related genes (OsCASP1, OsPAL, OsCYP86A1 and OsKCS20). Cd exposure induced endodermal plasticity in both subspecies, but the changes in japonica were greater than in indica subspecies. The earlier formation of CSs/SL in japonica subspecies significantly restricted the flow of radial transport tracer to reach the xylem and decreased Cd influx into roots, that is, endodermal barriers inhibited Cd radial transport via both apoplastic and cell-to-cell pathways, thus decreasing the root-to-shoot transport of Cd in japonica subspecies. Our findings are beneficial for the genetic modification of rice with low-Cd-accumulating ability.
NA	Rice OsCASP1 orchestrates Casparian strip formation and suberin deposition in small lateral roots to maintain nutrient homeostasis.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Genetics, Breeding and Multiple Utilization of Crops, College of Agriculture, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China.	Arabidopsis Casparian strip membrane domain proteins (CASPs) form a transmembrane scaffold to recruit lignin biosynthetic enzymes for Casparian strip (CS) formation. Rice is a semi-aquatic plant with a more complex root structure than Arabidopsis to adapt its growing conditions, where the different deposition of lignin and suberin is crucial for adaptive responses. Here, we observed the structure of rice primary and small lateral roots (SLRs), particularly the deposition patterns of lignin and suberin in wild type and Oscasp1 mutants. We found that the appearance time and structure of CS in the roots of rice are different from those of Arabidopsis and observed suberin deposition in the sclerenchyma in wild type roots. Rice CASP1 is highly similar to AtCASPs, but its expression is concentrated in SLR tips and can be induced by salt stress especially in the steles. The loss of OsCASP1 function alters the expression of the genes involved in suberin biosynthesis and the deposition of suberin in the endodermis and sclerenchyma and leads to delayed CS formation and uneven lignin deposition in SLRs. These different depositions may alter nutrient uptake, resulting in ion imbalance in plant, withered leaves, fewer tillers, and reduced tolerance to salt stress. Our findings suggest that OsCASP1 could play an important role in nutrient homeostasis and adaptation to the growth environment.
