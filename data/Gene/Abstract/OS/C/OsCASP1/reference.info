NA	OsCASP1 is required for Casparian strip formation at endodermal cells of rice roots for selective uptake of mineral elements.	2019	Plant Cell	Guangxi University CITY: Nanning China [CN].	To cope with diverse environmental conditions, rice roots have developed two Casparian strips (CS) at the exodermis and endodermis. Here, we functionally characterized OsCASP1 (Casparian strip domain protein 1) in rice. OsCASP1 was mainly expressed in the root elongation zone, and the protein encoded was first localized to all side of the plasma membrane of endodermal cells without CS, followed by to the middle of anticlinal side of endodermal cells with CS. Knockout of OsCASP1 resulted in defect of CS formation at the endodermis and decreased growth under both soil and hydroponic conditions. Mineral analysis showed that the oscasp1 mutants accumulated higher Ca, but less Mn, Zn, Fe, Cd and As in the shoots compared with the wild type. The growth inhibition of the mutants was further aggravated by high Ca. The polar localization of silicon transporter Lsi1 at the distal side of the endodermis was not altered in the mutant, but the protein abundance was decreased, resulting in significant reduction in silicon uptake. These results indicated that OsCASP1 is required for CS formation at the endodermis and that the CS in rice plays an important role in root selective uptake of mineral elements especially Ca and Si.
NA	Overexpression of OsCASP1 Improves Calcium Tolerance in Rice	2021	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning 530004, China.	The Casparian strip domain protein 1 (OsCASP1) is necessary for the formation of the Casparian strip (CS) in the rice endodermis. It also controls Ca2+ transport to the stele. Here, we demonstrated that OsCASP1 overexpression enhanced Ca tolerance in rice. Under normal conditions, OsCASP1-overexpressed lines showed similar concentrations of essential metals in the roots and shoots compared to the wild type, while under high Ca conditions, Ca in the roots, shoots, and xylem sap of the OsCASP1-overexpressed lines was significantly decreased. This did not apply to other essential metals. Ca-inhibited growth was significantly alleviated in the OsCASP1-overexpressed lines. Furthermore, OsCASP1 overexpression resulted in earlier formation of both the CS and functional apoplastic barrier in the endodermis but did not induce ectopic CS formation in non-endodermal cell layers and affect suberin accumulation in the endodermis. These results indicate that the overexpression of OsCASP1 promotes CS formation in endodermal cells and inhibits Ca2+ transport by the apoplastic pathway, restricting Ca accumulation in the roots and shoots under high Ca conditions. Taken together, the results suggest that OsCASP1 overexpression is an effective way to improve rice adaptation to high Ca environments.
