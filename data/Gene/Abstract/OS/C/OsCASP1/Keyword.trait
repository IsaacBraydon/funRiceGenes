OsCASP1	root	OsCASP1 is required for Casparian strip formation at endodermal cells of rice roots for selective uptake of mineral elements.	 OsCASP1 was mainly expressed in the root elongation zone, and the protein encoded was first localized to all side of the plasma membrane of endodermal cells without CS, followed by to the middle of anticlinal side of endodermal cells with CS
OsCASP1	root	OsCASP1 is required for Casparian strip formation at endodermal cells of rice roots for selective uptake of mineral elements.	 These results indicated that OsCASP1 is required for CS formation at the endodermis and that the CS in rice plays an important role in root selective uptake of mineral elements especially Ca and Si
OsCASP1	growth	OsCASP1 is required for Casparian strip formation at endodermal cells of rice roots for selective uptake of mineral elements.	 Knockout of OsCASP1 resulted in defect of CS formation at the endodermis and decreased growth under both soil and hydroponic conditions
OsCASP1	root elongation	OsCASP1 is required for Casparian strip formation at endodermal cells of rice roots for selective uptake of mineral elements.	 OsCASP1 was mainly expressed in the root elongation zone, and the protein encoded was first localized to all side of the plasma membrane of endodermal cells without CS, followed by to the middle of anticlinal side of endodermal cells with CS
OsCASP1	plasma membrane	OsCASP1 is required for Casparian strip formation at endodermal cells of rice roots for selective uptake of mineral elements.	 OsCASP1 was mainly expressed in the root elongation zone, and the protein encoded was first localized to all side of the plasma membrane of endodermal cells without CS, followed by to the middle of anticlinal side of endodermal cells with CS
OsCASP1	tolerance	Overexpression of OsCASP1 Improves Calcium Tolerance in Rice	Overexpression of OsCASP1 Improves Calcium Tolerance in Rice
OsCASP1	tolerance	Overexpression of OsCASP1 Improves Calcium Tolerance in Rice	 Here, we demonstrated that OsCASP1 overexpression enhanced Ca tolerance in rice
OsCASP1	calcium	Overexpression of OsCASP1 Improves Calcium Tolerance in Rice	Overexpression of OsCASP1 Improves Calcium Tolerance in Rice
