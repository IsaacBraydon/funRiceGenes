University of Baroda, Vadodara, Gujarat 390002, India.	The Oryza sativa constitutive disease resistance 1 (OsCDR1) gene product is an aspartic proteinase that has been implicated in disease resistance signaling. This apoplastic enzyme is a member of the group of 'atypical' plant aspartic proteinases. Recombinant OsCDR1 expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited protease activity against succinylated-casein substrate. Inactivating the enzyme through modification of an aspartate residue present in the deduced active site completely abolished its proteinase activity. Infiltration of the OsCDR1 fusion protein into leaves of Arabidopsis plants induced PR2 transcripts in both the infiltrated leaf (primary) and in non-treated secondary leaves while the inactive recombinant protein failed to induce either local or systemic PR2. These findings demonstrate that OsCDR1 is capable of inducing systemic defense responses in plants.

OsCDR1 leads to constitutive activation of defense responses in rice and Arabidopsis	2009	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Genome Research Centre, Department of Microbiology and Biotechnology Centre, Faculty of Science, The M.S. University of Baroda, Vadodara, Gujarat, India.	Plant aspartic proteases (AP) play key roles in the regulation of biological processes, such as the recognition of pathogens and pests and the induction of effective defense responses. A large number of AP (>400) have been identified in silico in the rice genome. None have previously been isolated and functionally characterized for their involvement in disease resistance. We describe here the isolation and characterization of a gene (OsCDR1) from rice which encodes a predicted aspartate protease. Expression of OsCDR1 was activated upon treatments with benzothiadiazole and salicylic acid, which are signal molecules in plant disease resistance responses. Ectopic expression of OsCDR1 in Arabidopsis and rice conferred enhanced resistance against bacterial and fungal pathogens. The enhanced disease resistance observed in transgenic plants was correlated with induction of pathogenesis-related gene expression and was shown by mutational analysis to be dependent on AP activity of the transgene-encoded product. OsCDR1 accumulates in intercellular fluids (IF) in transgenic plants. Infiltration of IF from transgenic Arabidopsis plants into leaves of wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis induced the systemic defense response. These results demonstrate the conservation of CDR1 function between rice and Arabidopsis during the disease resistance response.
