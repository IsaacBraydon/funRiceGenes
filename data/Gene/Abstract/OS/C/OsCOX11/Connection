COX11|OsCOX11	OsAP37	Variations in OsSPL10 confer drought tolerance by directly regulating OsNAC2 expression and ROS production in rice.	 Importantly, we demonstrated that the varieties with the OsSPL10 (Hap1) allele show low expression levels of OsSPL10 and its downstream gene, OsNAC2, which decreases the expression of OsAP37 and increases the expression of OsCOX11, thus preventing ROS accumulation and PCD
