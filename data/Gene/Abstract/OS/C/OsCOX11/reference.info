Plant cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) results from incompatibilities between the organellar and nuclear genomes and prevents self pollination, enabling hybrid crop breeding to increase yields. The Wild Abortive CMS (CMS-WA) has been exploited in the majority of 'three-line' hybrid rice production since the 1970s, but the molecular basis of this trait remains unknown. Here we report that a new mitochondrial gene, WA352, which originated recently in wild rice, confers CMS-WA because the protein it encodes interacts with the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein COX11. In CMS-WA lines, WA352 accumulates preferentially in the anther tapetum, thereby inhibiting COX11 function in peroxide metabolism and triggering premature tapetal programmed cell death and consequent pollen abortion. WA352-induced sterility can be suppressed by two restorer-of-fertility (Rf) genes, suggesting the existence of different mechanisms to counteract deleterious cytoplasmic factors. Thus, CMS-related cytoplasmic-nuclear incompatibility is driven by a detrimental interaction between a newly evolved mitochondrial gene and a conserved, essential nuclear gene.

New gene origination is a major source of genomic innovations that confer phenotypic changes and biological diversity. Generation of new mitochondrial genes in plants may cause cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), which can promote outcrossing and increase fitness. However, how mitochondrial genes originate and evolve in structure and function remains unclear. The rice Wild Abortive type of CMS is conferred by the mitochondrial gene WA352c (previously named WA352) and has been widely exploited in hybrid rice breeding. Here, we reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of WA352c by the identification and analyses of 11 mitochondrial genomic recombinant structures related to WA352c in wild and cultivated rice. We deduce that these structures arose through multiple rearrangements among conserved mitochondrial sequences in the mitochondrial genome of the wild rice Oryza rufipogon, coupled with substoichiometric shifting and sequence variation. We identify two expressed but nonfunctional protogenes among these structures, and show that they could evolve into functional CMS genes via sequence variations that could relieve the self-inhibitory potential of the proteins. These sequence changes would endow the proteins the ability to interact with the nucleus-encoded mitochondrial protein COX11, resulting in premature programmed cell death in the anther tapetum and male sterility. Furthermore, we show that the sequences that encode the COX11-interaction domains in these WA352c-related genes have experienced purifying selection during evolution. We propose a model for the formation and evolution of new CMS genes via a &quot;multi-recombination/protogene formation/functionalization&quot; mechanism involving gradual variations in the structure, sequence, copy number, and function.Cell Research advance online publication 11 October 2016; doi:10.1038/cr.2016.115.
NA	Crystal structure of WA352 provides insight into cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.	2018	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Plant cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is an important phenomenon and is widely utilized in hybrid crop breeding. The Wild Abortive CMS (CMS-WA), a well-known CMS type, has been successfully applied in the commercial production of hybrid rice seeds for more than 40 years. The CMS-WA causal gene WA352 encodes a novel transmenbrane protein and the interacts with the mitochondrial copper chaperone COX11, triggering reactive oxygen species production and resulting in male sterility in CMS-WA lines. However, the structure of WA352 is currently unknown, and the structural mechanism whereby WA352 perturbs COX11 function to cause CMS remains largely unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of the C-terminal functional domain of WA352 at 1.3<U+202F><U+00C5> resolution. This functional domain, consisting of five ¦Á helices, is spindle-shaped with a length of 42<U+202F><U+00C5>, and a diameter of 28<U+202F><U+00C5>. Notably, the absence of any structural similarity to a known protein structure suggests that the WA352 functional domain is a novel fold. In addition, surface conservation analysis and structural modeling of the WA352-COX11 complex revealed details about the WA352-COX11 interaction. Further structural analysis suggested that the WA352-COX11 interaction blocks the copper ion transportation activity of COX11, which is essential for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase, resulting in male sterility in CMS-WA lines. Our study paves the way toward structural determination of the WA352-COX11 complex and provides new insight into the mechanism of plant CMS.
NA	The Fungal Effector Avr-Pita Suppresses Innate Immunity by Increasing COX Activity in Rice Mitochondria	2021	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Background: Avr-Pita was the first effector identified in the blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae)-rice (Oryza sativa) pathosystem. However, the molecular mechanism underlying its effects on the host plant has remained a long-standing mystery.  Results: Here, we report that ectopically expressing Avr-Pita in rice enhances susceptibility to M. oryzae and suppresses pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered defense responses. Avr-Pita targets the host mitochondria and interacts with the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly protein OsCOX11, a key regulator of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism in rice. Overexpressing Avr-Pita or OsCOX11 increased COX activity and decreased ROS accumulation triggered by the fungal PAMP chitin. OsCOX11-overexpressing plants showed increased susceptibility to M. oryzae, whereas OsCOX11-knockdown plants showed resistance to M. oryzae.  Conclusions: Taken together, these findings suggest that the fungal pathogen M. oryzae delivers the effector Avr-Pita to the host plant, where it enhances COX activity thus decreasing ROS accumulation. Therefore, this effector suppresses host innate immunity by perturbing ROS metabolism in the mitochondria.
