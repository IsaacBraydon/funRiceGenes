OsC6	cuticle	OsC6, encoding a lipid transfer protein, is required for postmeiotic anther development in rice	Immunological assays indicated that OsC6 is widely distributed in anther tissues such as the tapetal cytoplasm, the extracellular space between the tapetum and middle layer, and the anther locule and anther cuticle
