OsC6	TDR	High temperatures cause male sterility in rice plants with transcriptional alterations during pollen development	 The expression levels of Osc6, OsRAFTIN and TDR, which are tapetum-specific genes, were unaffected by high temperatures
LTP2|nsLTP2	OsC6	OsC6, encoding a lipid transfer protein, is required for postmeiotic anther development in rice	 Found in monocots, OsC6 belongs to a distinct clade from previously identified LTP1 and LTP2 family members found in both dicots and monocots
OsC6	TDR	OsC6, encoding a lipid transfer protein, is required for postmeiotic anther development in rice	 Furthermore, additional evidence is provided that the expression of OsC6 is positively regulated by a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Tapetum Degeneration Retardation (TDR)
OsC6	TDR	OsC6, encoding a lipid transfer protein, is required for postmeiotic anther development in rice	 Extra granule-like structures were observed on the inner surface of the tdr tapetal layer when the expression of OsC6 was driven by the TDR promoter compared with the tdr mutant
OsC6	OsCP1	The rice tapetum degeneration retardation gene is required for tapetum degradation and anther development	 More importantly, two genes, Os CP1 and Os c6, encoding a Cys protease and a protease inhibitor, respectively, were shown to be the likely direct targets of TDR through chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay
OsC6	TDR	The rice tapetum degeneration retardation gene is required for tapetum degradation and anther development	 More importantly, two genes, Os CP1 and Os c6, encoding a Cys protease and a protease inhibitor, respectively, were shown to be the likely direct targets of TDR through chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay
OsABCG26	OsC6	An ABC transporter, OsABCG26, is required for anther cuticle and pollen exine formation and pollen-pistil interactions in rice	 Expression of some key genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport, such as UDT1, WDA1, CYP704B2, OsABCG15, OsC4 and OsC6, was significantly altered in osabcg26 anther, possibly due to a disturbance in the homeostasis of anther lipid metabolism and transport
