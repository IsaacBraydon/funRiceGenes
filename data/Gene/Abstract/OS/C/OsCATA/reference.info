23.pdf	ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Biology, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China.	The production of both ABA and H(2)O(2) is induced by drought and can act as signals under stress conditions. We investigated the relationships between ABA, H(2)O(2) and catalase (CAT) in rice leaves when rice seedlings were treated with polyethylene glycol as water stress treatment. As a key gene in ABA biosynthesis, OsNCED3 was significantly induced in rice by water stress treatment and such induction preceded the rapid increase in ABA. Water stress inhibited the expression of CATA and CATC but substantially enhanced the expression of CATB. Exogenously applied ABA promoted the expression of CATB also and inhibited the expression of CATC in a concentration-dependent manner. When ABA production was inhibited by using ABA biosynthesis inhibitors nordihydroguaiaretic acid and tungstate, expression of CATB was also subdued while CATC was enhanced under the water stress. Accumulation of H(2)O(2) was also reduced when endogenous ABA production was inhibited and showed a correlation with the total activity of catalases. Our results suggest that water stress-induced ABA prevents the excessive accumulation of H(2)O(2), through the induction of the expression of CATB gene during water stress.
NA	The UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase OsUXS3 regulates Na(+) ion toxicity tolerance under salt stress by interacting with OsCATs in rice.	2023	Plant Physiol Biochem	College of Life Sciences, National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Crop Physiology Ecology and Production Management, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Overly Na(+) ion in soil caused by salt stress has a significant negative impact on the growth and production of crops, especially rice (Oryza sativa L.). Therefore, it is vital for us to clarify how salt stress tolerance in rice is caused by Na(+) ion toxicity. The UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase (UXS) is a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of UDP-xylose, which is the key substrate of cytoderm synthesis in plants. In this study, we found that OsUXS3, a rice UXS, is a positive regulator to regulate Na(+) ion toxicity under salt stress by interacting with OsCATs (Oryza sativa catalase; OsCAT). The expression of OsUXS3 was significantly up-regulated under NaCl and NaHCO(3) treatments of rice seedlings. Meanwhile, by the genetic and biochemical evidence, knockout of OsUXS3 significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and decreased CAT activity under NaCl and NaHCO(3) treatments in tissue. Furthermore, knockout of OsUXS3 caused excessive accumulation of Na (+) ion and rapid loss of K(+) ion and disrupts Na(+)/K(+) homeostasis under NaCl and NaHCO(3) treatments. Based on the results above, we can conclude that OsUXS3 might regulate CAT activity by interacting with OsCATs, which is not only characterized for the first time but also regulating Na(+)/K(+) homeostasis, positively regulating the Na(+) ion toxicity tolerance under salt stress in rice.
