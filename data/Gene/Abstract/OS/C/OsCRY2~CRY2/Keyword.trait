OsCRY2|CRY2	flower	Involvement of rice cryptochromes in de-etiolation responses and flowering	 Our studies revealed that OsCRY1 genes were mainly expressed in the green plant tissue, while OsCRY2 gene expression was high in the coleoptile, flower and callus
OsCRY2|CRY2	flower	Involvement of rice cryptochromes in de-etiolation responses and flowering	 In addition, OsCRY2 antisense transgenic rice flowered later than WT under both long-day and short-day conditions, indicating that Oscry2 is involved in the promotion of flowering time in rice
