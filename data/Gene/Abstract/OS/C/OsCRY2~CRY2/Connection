OsBBX14	OsCRY2|CRY2	OsBBX14 promotes photomorphogenesis in rice by activating OsHY5L1 expression under blue light conditions.	 LUC complementation imaging (LCI) results suggested that OsBBX14 had physical interaction with OsCRY2 protein
OsBIC1	OsCRY2|CRY2	OsBIC1 Directly Interacts with OsCRYs to Regulate Leaf Sheath Length through Mediating GA-Responsive Pathway.	 OsBIC1 regulated blue light-induced leaf sheath elongation through direct interaction with OsCRY1a, OsCRY1b, and OsCRY2 (OsCRYs)
OsCRY1a	OsCRY2|CRY2	OsBIC1 Directly Interacts with OsCRYs to Regulate Leaf Sheath Length through Mediating GA-Responsive Pathway.	 OsBIC1 regulated blue light-induced leaf sheath elongation through direct interaction with OsCRY1a, OsCRY1b, and OsCRY2 (OsCRYs)
OsCRY1b	OsCRY2|CRY2	OsBIC1 Directly Interacts with OsCRYs to Regulate Leaf Sheath Length through Mediating GA-Responsive Pathway.	 OsBIC1 regulated blue light-induced leaf sheath elongation through direct interaction with OsCRY1a, OsCRY1b, and OsCRY2 (OsCRYs)
OsCRY2|CRY2	OsFBO10	OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 co-regulate photomorphogenesis and photoperiodic flowering in indica rice.	OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 co-regulate photomorphogenesis and photoperiodic flowering in indica rice.
OsCRY2|CRY2	OsFBO10	OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 co-regulate photomorphogenesis and photoperiodic flowering in indica rice.	 Novel interactions were confirmed between OsCRY2 and members of ZEITLUPE family of blue/ultraviolet-A light photoreceptors, encoded by OsFBO8, OsFBO9 and OsFBO10 which are orthologous to ZEITLUPE (ZTL), LOV KELCH PROTEIN2 (LKP2) and FLAVIN BINDING, KELCH REPEAT F-BOX1 (FKF1), respectively, of Arabidopsis thaliana
OsCRY2|CRY2	OsFBO10	OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 co-regulate photomorphogenesis and photoperiodic flowering in indica rice.	 OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 interacted in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the cell and cross-regulated the expression of each other
OsCRY2|CRY2	OsFBO10	OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 co-regulate photomorphogenesis and photoperiodic flowering in indica rice.	 Both OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 played a positive role in photomorphogenic responses in different light conditions
OsCRY2|CRY2	OsFBO10	OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 co-regulate photomorphogenesis and photoperiodic flowering in indica rice.	 The physical interaction of OsCRY2 with OsFBO10, their involvement in common physiological and developmental pathways and their cross-regulation of each other suggest that the two photoreceptors may regulate common developmental pathways in plants, either jointly or redundantly
