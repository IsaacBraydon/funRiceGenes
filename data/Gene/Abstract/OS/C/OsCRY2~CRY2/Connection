OsBBX14	OsCRY2|CRY2	OsBBX14 promotes photomorphogenesis in rice by activating OsHY5L1 expression under blue light conditions.	 LUC complementation imaging (LCI) results suggested that OsBBX14 had physical interaction with OsCRY2 protein
OsBIC1	OsCRY2|CRY2	OsBIC1 Directly Interacts with OsCRYs to Regulate Leaf Sheath Length through Mediating GA-Responsive Pathway.	 OsBIC1 regulated blue light-induced leaf sheath elongation through direct interaction with OsCRY1a, OsCRY1b, and OsCRY2 (OsCRYs)
