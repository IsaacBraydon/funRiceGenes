In order to elucidate the function of cryptochromes (cry) in rice, we have characterized all rice CRY genes, including OsCRY1a, OsCRY1b and OsCRY2. Our studies revealed that OsCRY1 genes were mainly expressed in the green plant tissue, while OsCRY2 gene expression was high in the coleoptile, flower and callus. Light treatment affected neither the expression of any of the OsCRY genes nor the stability of their transcripts. However, it was found that Oscry2 protein was negatively regulated by blue light. Moreover, the level of Oscry2 protein also decreased upon red light treatment, and this red light-dependent degradation was shown to be mediated by phytochrome B. Overexpression of OsCRY1 genes resulted in an increased responsiveness to blue light when measuring coleoptile growth inhibition. Moreover, growth of leaf sheaths and blades was also repressed more in OsCRY1 overexpressers than in wild type (WT) under blue light conditions. These results suggest that Oscry1s are responsible for regulating blue light-mediated de-etiolation in rice. In addition, OsCRY2 antisense transgenic rice flowered later than WT under both long-day and short-day conditions, indicating that Oscry2 is involved in the promotion of flowering time in rice.
Hirose-2012-Cryptochrome and phy.pdf	Cryptochrome and phytochrome cooperatively but independently reduce active gibberellin content in rice seedlings under light irradiation	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Photobiology and Photosynthesis Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602 Japan. fumih@affrc.go.jp	In contrast to a wealth of knowledge about the photoregulation of gibberellin metabolism in dicots, that in monocots remains largely unclear. In this study, we found that a blue light signal triggers reduction of active gibberellin content in rice seedlings with simultaneous repression of two gibberellin 20-oxidase genes (OsGA20ox2 and OsGA20ox4) and acute induction of four gibberellin 2-oxidase genes (OsGA2ox4-OsGA2ox7). For further examination of the regulation of these genes, we established a series of cryptochrome-deficient lines through reverse genetic screening from a Tos17 mutant population and construction of knockdown lines based on an RNA interference technique. By using these lines and phytochrome mutants, we elucidated that cryptochrome 1 (cry1), consisting of two species in rice plants (cry1a and cry1b), is indispensable for robust induction of the GA2ox genes. On the other hand, repression of the GA20ox genes is mediated by phytochromes. In addition, we found that the phytochromes also mediate the repression of a gibberellin 3-oxidase gene (OsGA3ox2) in the light. These results imply that, in rice seedlings, phytochromes mediate the repression of gibberellin biosynthesis capacity, while cry1 mediates the induction of gibberellin inactivation capacity. The cry1 action was demonstrated to be dominant in the reduction of active gibberellin content, but, in rice seedlings, the cumulative effects of these independent actions reduced active gibberellin content in the light. This pathway design in which different types of photoreceptors independently but cooperatively regulate active gibberellin content is unique from the viewpoint of dicot research. This redundancy should provide robustness to the response in rice plants.
Hirose-2013-Differences and simi.pdf	Differences and similarities in the photoregulation of gibberellin metabolism between rice and dicots	2013	Plant Signal Behav	Functional Plant Research Unit; National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences; Tsukuba, Ibaraki Japan.	In rice seedlings, elongation of leaf sheaths is suppressed by light stimuli. The response is mediated by two classes of photoreceptors, phytochromes and cryptochromes. However, it remains unclear how these photoreceptors interact in the process. Our recent study using phytochrome mutants and novel cryptochrome RNAi lines revealed that cryptochromes and phytochromes function cooperatively, but independently to reduce active GA contents in seedlings in visible light. Blue light captured by cryptochrome 1 (cry1a and cry1b) induces robust expression of GA 2-oxidase genes (OsGA2ox4-7). In parallel, phytochrome B with auxiliary action of phytochrome A mediates repression of GA 20-oxidase genes (OsGA20ox2 and OsGA20ox4). The independent effects cumulatively reduce active GA contents, leading to a suppression of leaf sheath elongation. These regulatory mechanisms are distinct from phytochrome B function in dicots. We discuss reasons why the distinct system appeared in rice, and advantages of the rice system in early photomorphogenesis.
NA	OsBIC1 Directly Interacts with OsCRYs to Regulate Leaf Sheath Length through Mediating GA-Responsive Pathway.	2021	Int J Mol Sci	Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Cryptochrome 1 and 2 (CRY1 and CRY2) are blue light receptors involved in the regulation of hypocotyl elongation, cotyledon expansion, and flowering time in Arabidopsisthaliana. Two cryptochrome-interacting proteins, Blue-light Inhibitor of Cryptochrome 1 and 2 (BIC1 and BIC2), have been found in Arabidopsis. BIC1 plays critical roles in suppressing the physiological activities of CRY2, which include the blue light-dependent dimerization, phosphorylation, photobody formation, and degradation process, but the functional characterization of BIC protein in other crops has not yet been performed. To investigate the function of BIC protein in rice (Oryza sativa), two homologous genes of Arabidopsis&amp;nbsp;BIC1 and BIC2, namely OsBIC1 and OsBIC2&amp;nbsp;(OsBICs), were identified. The overexpression of OsBIC1 and OsBIC2 led to increased leaf sheath length, whereas mutations in OsBIC1 displayed shorter leaf sheath in a blue light intensity-dependent manner. OsBIC1 regulated blue light-induced leaf sheath elongation through direct interaction with OsCRY1a, OsCRY1b, and OsCRY2 (OsCRYs). Longitudinal sections of the second leaf sheath demonstrated that OsBIC1 and OsCRYs controlled leaf sheath length by influencing the ratio of epidermal cells with different lengths. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis further proved that OsBIC1 and OsCRYs regulated similar transcriptome changes in regulating Gibberellic Acids (GA)-responsive pathway. Taken together, these results suggested that OsBIC1 and OsCRYs worked together to regulate epidermal cell elongation and control blue light-induced leaf sheath elongation through the GA-responsive pathway.
NA	CRY2 gene of rice (Oryza sativa subsp. indica) encodes a blue light sensory receptor involved in regulating flowering, plant height and partial photomorphogenesis in dark.	2022	Plant Cell Rep	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, 110021, India.	OsiCRY2 is involved in light-regulated plant development and plays a role in regulating photomorphogenesis, plant height, flowering and most strikingly partial photomorphogenesis in dark. Cryptochrome 2 (CRY2), the blue/UV-A light photoreceptor in plants, has been reported to regulate photoperiod-dependent flowering and seedling photomorphogenesis (under low-intensity light). Among monocots, CRY2 has been reported from japonica rice, wheat, sorghum and barley. The two sub-species of rice, indica and japonica, exhibit a high degree of genetic variation and morphological and physiological differences. This article describes the characterization of CRY2 of indica rice (OsiCRY2). While the transcript levels of OsiCRY2 did not change significantly under blue light, its protein levels were found to decline with increased time duration under blue light. For phenotypic characterization, OsiCRY2 over-expression (OX) transgenics were generated in Oryza sativa Pusa Sugandh 2 (PS2) cultivar, a highly scented Basmati cultivar. The OsiCRY2(OX) transgenics displayed shorter coleoptiles and dwarfism than wild-type under blue light, white, and far-red light. Interestingly, even the dark-grown transgenics were shorter, concomitant with higher OsiCRY2 protein levels in transgenics than wild-type. Histological analysis revealed that the decrease in the length of the seedlings was due to a decrease in the length of the epidermal cells. The fully mature rice transgenics were shorter than the untransformed plants but flowered at the same time as wild-type. However, the OsiCRY2 Arabidopsis over-expressors exhibited early flowering by 10-15Â days, indicating the potential and conservation of function of OsiCRY2. The whole-genome transcriptome profiling of rice transgenics revealed the differential up-regulation of several light-regulated genes in dark-grown coleoptiles. These data provide evidence that OsiCRY2 regulates photomorphogenesis, plant height, and flowering in indica rice.
