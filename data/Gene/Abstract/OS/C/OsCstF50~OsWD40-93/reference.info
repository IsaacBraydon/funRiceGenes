Ouyang-2012-Genomic survey, expr.pdf	Genomic survey, expression profile and co-expression network analysis of OsWD40 family in rice	2012	BMC Genomics	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research Wuhan, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	BACKGROUND: WD40 proteins represent a large family in eukaryotes, which have been involved in a broad spectrum of crucial functions. Systematic characterization and co-expression analysis of OsWD40 genes enable us to understand the networks of the WD40 proteins and their biological processes and gene functions in rice. RESULTS: In this study, we identify and analyze 200 potential OsWD40 genes in rice, describing their gene structures, genome localizations, and evolutionary relationship of each member. Expression profiles covering the whole life cycle in rice has revealed that transcripts of OsWD40 were accumulated differentially during vegetative and reproductive development and preferentially up or down-regulated in different tissues. Under phytohormone treatments, 25 OsWD40 genes were differentially expressed with treatments of one or more of the phytohormone NAA, KT, or GA3 in rice seedlings. We also used a combined analysis of expression correlation and Gene Ontology annotation to infer the biological role of the OsWD40 genes in rice. The results suggested that OsWD40 genes may perform their diverse functions by complex network, thus were predictive for understanding their biological pathways. The analysis also revealed that OsWD40 genes might interact with each other to take part in metabolic pathways, suggesting a more complex feedback network. CONCLUSIONS: All of these analyses suggest that the functions of OsWD40 genes are diversified, which provide useful references for selecting candidate genes for further functional studies.
Plant Cell Physiol-2009-Jang-1479-92.pdf	Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Plant Signaling Network Research Center, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Korea.	The FCA protein is involved in controlling flowering time and plays more general roles in RNA-mediated chromatin silencing in Arabidopsis. It contains two RNA-binding domains and a WW domain. The FCA protein interacts with FY, a polyadenylation factor, via its WW domain. We previously characterized a rice gene, OsFCA, which was homologous to FCA. Here, we found that the OsFCA protein could interact through its WW domain with the following proteins: OsFY, a protein containing a CID domain present in RNA-processing factors such as Pcf11 and Nrd1; a protein similar to splicing factor SF1; a protein similar to FUSE splicing factor; and OsMADS8. The FY protein is associated with the 3' end processing machinery in Arabidopsis. Thus, we examined interactions between OsFY and the rice homologs (OsCstF-50, -64 and -77) of the AtCstF-50, -64 and -77 proteins. We found that OsFY could bind OsCstF50, whereas the OsCstF77 protein could bridge the interaction between OsCstF50 and OsCstF64. Taken together, our data suggest that OsFCA could interact with several proteins other than OsFY through its WW domain and may play several roles in rice.
