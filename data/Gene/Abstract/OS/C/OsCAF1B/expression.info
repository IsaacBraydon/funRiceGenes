OsCAF1B	 Using gain of function and dominant negative mutation analysis, we demonstrate that overexpression of OsCAF1B resulted in an accelerated ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA degradation phenomenon, while ectopic expression of a form of OsCAF1B that had lost its deadenylase activity resulted in a delayed ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA degradation phenomenon in transgenic rice cells |  Additionally, we found that overexpression of OsCAF1B retards seed germination and seedling growth	 Using gain of function and dominant negative mutation analysis, we demonstrate that overexpression of OsCAF1B resulted in an accelerated ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA degradation phenomenon, while ectopic expression of a form of OsCAF1B that had lost its deadenylase activity resulted in a delayed ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA degradation phenomenon in transgenic rice cells |  Additionally, we found that overexpression of OsCAF1B retards seed germination and seedling growth
OsCAF1B	 Expression of OsCAF1B was tightly coupled with low-temperature exposure |  In the present study, we investigated the function of OsCAF1B in rice by characterizing the molecular and physiological responses to cold stress in OsCAF1B overexpression lines and dominant-negative mutant lines |  Expression of OsCAF1B was closely linked with low-temperature exposure |  The increased survival percentage and reduced electrolyte leakage exhibited by OsCAF1B overexpression transgenic lines subjected to cold stress indicate that OsCAF1B plays a positive role in rice growth under low ambient temperature |  The enhancement of cold tolerance by OsCAF1B in transgenic rice seedlings involved OsCAF1B deadenylase gene expression, and was associated with elevated expression of late-response cold-related transcription factor genes |  In addition, the expression level of OsCAF1B was higher in a cold-tolerant japonica rice cultivar than in a cold-sensitive indica rice cultivar |  The results reveal a hitherto undiscovered function of OsCAF1B deadenylase gene expression, which is required for adaptation to cold stress in rice	 In the present study, we investigated the function of OsCAF1B in rice by characterizing the molecular and physiological responses to cold stress in OsCAF1B overexpression lines and dominant-negative mutant lines |  The increased survival percentage and reduced electrolyte leakage exhibited by OsCAF1B overexpression transgenic lines subjected to cold stress indicate that OsCAF1B plays a positive role in rice growth under low ambient temperature
