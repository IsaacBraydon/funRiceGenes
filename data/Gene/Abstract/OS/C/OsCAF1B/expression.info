OsCAF1B	 Using gain of function and dominant negative mutation analysis, we demonstrate that overexpression of OsCAF1B resulted in an accelerated ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA degradation phenomenon, while ectopic expression of a form of OsCAF1B that had lost its deadenylase activity resulted in a delayed ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA degradation phenomenon in transgenic rice cells |  Additionally, we found that overexpression of OsCAF1B retards seed germination and seedling growth	 Using gain of function and dominant negative mutation analysis, we demonstrate that overexpression of OsCAF1B resulted in an accelerated ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA degradation phenomenon, while ectopic expression of a form of OsCAF1B that had lost its deadenylase activity resulted in a delayed ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA degradation phenomenon in transgenic rice cells |  Additionally, we found that overexpression of OsCAF1B retards seed germination and seedling growth
