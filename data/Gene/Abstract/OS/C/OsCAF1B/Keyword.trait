OsCAF1B	growth	A CCR4 association factor 1, OsCAF1B, participates in the ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA poly(A) tail shortening and plays a role in germination and seedling growth.	 Additionally, we found that overexpression of OsCAF1B retards seed germination and seedling growth
OsCAF1B	seedling	A CCR4 association factor 1, OsCAF1B, participates in the ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA poly(A) tail shortening and plays a role in germination and seedling growth.	 Additionally, we found that overexpression of OsCAF1B retards seed germination and seedling growth
OsCAF1B	seedling	A CCR4 association factor 1, OsCAF1B, participates in the ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA poly(A) tail shortening and plays a role in germination and seedling growth.	 These findings indicate that OsCAF1B participates in sugar-induced ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA degradation and deadenylation, and acts a negative factor for germination and seedling development
