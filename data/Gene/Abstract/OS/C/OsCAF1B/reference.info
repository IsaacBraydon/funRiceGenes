NA	A CCR4 association factor 1, OsCAF1B, participates in the ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA poly(A) tail shortening and plays a role in germination and seedling growth.	2019	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Life Sciences, National Central University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan, ROC.	Poly(A) tail shortening, also termed deadenylation, is the rate-limiting step of mRNA degradation in eukaryotic cells. The CCR4-associated factor 1s (CAF1s) were shown to be one of the major enzymes for catalyzing mRNA deadenylation in yeast and mammalian cells. However, the functions of CAF1 proteins in plants are poorly understood. Herein, a sugar upregulated CAF1 gene, OsCAF1B, is investigated in rice. Using gain of function and dominant negative mutation analysis, we demonstrate that overexpression of OsCAF1B resulted in an accelerated ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA degradation phenomenon, while ectopic expression of a form of OsCAF1B that had lost its deadenylase activity resulted in a delayed ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA degradation phenomenon in transgenic rice cells. The change in ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA degradation in transgenic rice is associated with the altered lengths of the ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA poly(A) tail, indicating that OsCAF1B acts as a negative regulator of ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA stability in rice. Additionally, we found that overexpression of OsCAF1B retards seed germination and seedling growth. These findings indicate that OsCAF1B participates in sugar-induced ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA degradation and deadenylation, and acts a negative factor for germination and seedling development.
