OsC1	 The positive correlation between the expression of ABP genes and OsC1 along with the nuclear localization of OsC1 are in line with its possible involvement as a transcriptional regulator of ABP genes
OsC1	 Combined with expression pattern analysis of candidate genes, LOC_Os06g10350 (OsC1(PLSr)) was suggested as a candidate gene |  The RT-PCR revealed that OsC1(PLSr), anthocyanin synthase (ANS), diflavonol-4-reductase (DFR), flavanone-3-hydroxylase (F3H), and flavanone-3&#x27;-hydroxylase (F3&#x27;H) expression levels were dramatically down-regulated in the mutants |  The results indicated that OsC1(PLSr) synthesized anthocyanins by regulating the expression of ANS, DFR, F3H, and F3&#x27;H
