OsC1	oxidative stress	A rice R2R3-MYB (OsC1) transcriptional regulator improves oxidative stress tolerance by modulating anthocyanin biosynthesis	 The OsC1 transcriptional regulator helps to ameliorate oxidative stresses in plants owing to its anthocyanin modulating ability
OsC1	oxidative	A rice R2R3-MYB (OsC1) transcriptional regulator improves oxidative stress tolerance by modulating anthocyanin biosynthesis	 The OsC1 transcriptional regulator helps to ameliorate oxidative stresses in plants owing to its anthocyanin modulating ability
OsC1	transcriptional regulator	A rice R2R3-MYB (OsC1) transcriptional regulator improves oxidative stress tolerance by modulating anthocyanin biosynthesis	 The positive correlation between the expression of ABP genes and OsC1 along with the nuclear localization of OsC1 are in line with its possible involvement as a transcriptional regulator of ABP genes
