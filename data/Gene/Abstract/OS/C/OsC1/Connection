OsBBX14	OsC1	A Rice B-Box Protein, OsBBX14, Finely Regulates Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Rice.	 Using a steroid receptor-based inducible activation system, OsBBX14 and OsHY5 were found to directly activate OsC1 or OsB2 in an independent or collaborative manner
OsC1	OSVP1|VP1	Transcription Factors Rc and OsVP 1 Coordinately Regulate Preharvest Sprouting Tolerance in Red Pericarp Rice	 Furthermore, a luciferase complementation imaging assay showed that OsVP1 interacts with transcriptions factors Rc and OsC1
OsC1	OSVP1|VP1	Transcription Factors Rc and OsVP 1 Coordinately Regulate Preharvest Sprouting Tolerance in Red Pericarp Rice	 These results indicate that OsVP1 promotes proanthocyanidin accumulation through the interaction among OsVP1, Rc, and OsC1 and then increases the plant's ABA sensitivity and PHS resistance
OsC1	Rc|qSD7-1|qPC7	Transcription Factors Rc and OsVP 1 Coordinately Regulate Preharvest Sprouting Tolerance in Red Pericarp Rice	 Furthermore, a luciferase complementation imaging assay showed that OsVP1 interacts with transcriptions factors Rc and OsC1
OsC1	Rc|qSD7-1|qPC7	Transcription Factors Rc and OsVP 1 Coordinately Regulate Preharvest Sprouting Tolerance in Red Pericarp Rice	 These results indicate that OsVP1 promotes proanthocyanidin accumulation through the interaction among OsVP1, Rc, and OsC1 and then increases the plant's ABA sensitivity and PHS resistance
OsC1	Rb1	Dominant complementary interaction between OsC1 and two tightly linked genes, Rb1 and Rb2, controls the purple leaf sheath in rice.	Dominant complementary interaction between OsC1 and two tightly linked genes, Rb1 and Rb2, controls the purple leaf sheath in rice.
OsC1	Rb1	Dominant complementary interaction between OsC1 and two tightly linked genes, Rb1 and Rb2, controls the purple leaf sheath in rice.	 A segregation ratio of green to purple was 15:1 observed in the F(2) population from parents Minghui 63 and Xizang 2, which both had green leaf sheaths; these results demonstrate that dominant complementary interaction between OsC1 and Rb (Rb1 and Rb2) controls the purple leaf sheath
