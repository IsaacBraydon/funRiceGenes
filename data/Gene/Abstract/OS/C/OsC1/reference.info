997.full.pdf	Allelic diversification at the C (OsC1) locus of wild and cultivated rice: nucleotide changes associated with phenotypes	2004	Genetics	Plant Breeding Laboratory, Graduate School of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8589, Japan.	Divergent phenotypes are often detected in domesticated plants despite the existence of invariant phenotypes in their wild forms. One such example in rice is the occurrence of varying degrees of apiculus coloration due to anthocyanin pigmentation, which was previously reported to be caused by a series of alleles at the C locus. The present study reveals, on the basis of comparison of its maps, that the C gene appears to be the rice homolog (OsC1) of maize C1, which belongs to the group of R2R3-Myb factors. Two different types of deletions causing a frameshift were detected in the third exon, and both of the deleted nucleotides corresponded to the positions of putative base-contacting residues, suggesting that the Indica and Japonica types carry loss-of-function mutations with independent origins. In addition, replacement substitutions were frequently detected in OsC1 of strains carrying the previously defined C alleles. Molecular population analysis revealed that 17 haplotypes were found in 39 wild and cultivated rices, and the haplotypes of most cultivated forms could be classified into one of three distinct groups, with few shared haplotypes among taxa, including Indica and Japonica types. The genealogy of the OsC1 gene suggests that allelic diversification causing phenotypic change might have resulted from mutations in the coding region rather than from recombination between preexisting alleles. The McDonald and Kreitman test revealed that the changes in amino acids might be associated with selective forces acting on the lineage of group A whose haplotypes were carried by most Asian cultivated forms. The results regarding a significant implication for genetic diversity in landraces of rice are also discussed.
NA	The C-S-A gene system regulates hull pigmentation and reveals evolution of anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in rice.	2018	J Exp Bot	Key Laboratory of Crop Heterosis and Utilization, Ministry of Education/ Beijing Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Department of Plant Genetics and Breeding, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.	Floral organs in rice (Oryza sativa) can be purple, brown or red in color due to the accumulation of flavonoids. But the molecular mechanism underlying specific organ pigmentation is not clear. Here, we propose a C-S-A gene model for rice hull pigmentation and characterize through genetic, molecular and metabolomic approaches. Further we conduct phylogenetic studies to reveal the evolution of rice color. In this gene system, C1 encodes a R2R3-MYB transcription factor and acts as a color-producing gene and S1 encodes a bHLH protein that functions in a tissue-specific manner. C1 interacts with S1 and activate expression of A1 which encoding a dihydro-flavonol reductase (DFR). As a consequence, the hull is purple whereby functional A1 participation leads to high accumulation of cyanidin 3-O-glucoside. Loss of function of A1 leads to brown hull color due to accumulation of flavonoids such as hesperetin 5-O-glucoside, rutin and delphinidin 3-O-rutinoside. It shows different evolutionary pathway of rice color in japonica and indica, supporting independent origin of cultivars in each subspecies. Our findings give complete perspectives on gene regulation network of rice color formation and supply theoretical basis for extended application of this beneficial trait.
