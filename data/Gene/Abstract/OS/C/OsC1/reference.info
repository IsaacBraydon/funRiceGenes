997.full.pdf	Allelic diversification at the C (OsC1) locus of wild and cultivated rice: nucleotide changes associated with phenotypes	2004	Genetics	Plant Breeding Laboratory, Graduate School of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8589, Japan.	Divergent phenotypes are often detected in domesticated plants despite the existence of invariant phenotypes in their wild forms. One such example in rice is the occurrence of varying degrees of apiculus coloration due to anthocyanin pigmentation, which was previously reported to be caused by a series of alleles at the C locus. The present study reveals, on the basis of comparison of its maps, that the C gene appears to be the rice homolog (OsC1) of maize C1, which belongs to the group of R2R3-Myb factors. Two different types of deletions causing a frameshift were detected in the third exon, and both of the deleted nucleotides corresponded to the positions of putative base-contacting residues, suggesting that the Indica and Japonica types carry loss-of-function mutations with independent origins. In addition, replacement substitutions were frequently detected in OsC1 of strains carrying the previously defined C alleles. Molecular population analysis revealed that 17 haplotypes were found in 39 wild and cultivated rices, and the haplotypes of most cultivated forms could be classified into one of three distinct groups, with few shared haplotypes among taxa, including Indica and Japonica types. The genealogy of the OsC1 gene suggests that allelic diversification causing phenotypic change might have resulted from mutations in the coding region rather than from recombination between preexisting alleles. The McDonald and Kreitman test revealed that the changes in amino acids might be associated with selective forces acting on the lineage of group A whose haplotypes were carried by most Asian cultivated forms. The results regarding a significant implication for genetic diversity in landraces of rice are also discussed.
NA	The C-S-A gene system regulates hull pigmentation and reveals evolution of anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in rice.	2018	J Exp Bot	Key Laboratory of Crop Heterosis and Utilization, Ministry of Education/ Beijing Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Department of Plant Genetics and Breeding, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.	Floral organs in rice (Oryza sativa) can be purple, brown or red in color due to the accumulation of flavonoids. But the molecular mechanism underlying specific organ pigmentation is not clear. Here, we propose a C-S-A gene model for rice hull pigmentation and characterize through genetic, molecular and metabolomic approaches. Further we conduct phylogenetic studies to reveal the evolution of rice color. In this gene system, C1 encodes a R2R3-MYB transcription factor and acts as a color-producing gene and S1 encodes a bHLH protein that functions in a tissue-specific manner. C1 interacts with S1 and activate expression of A1 which encoding a dihydro-flavonol reductase (DFR). As a consequence, the hull is purple whereby functional A1 participation leads to high accumulation of cyanidin 3-O-glucoside. Loss of function of A1 leads to brown hull color due to accumulation of flavonoids such as hesperetin 5-O-glucoside, rutin and delphinidin 3-O-rutinoside. It shows different evolutionary pathway of rice color in japonica and indica, supporting independent origin of cultivars in each subspecies. Our findings give complete perspectives on gene regulation network of rice color formation and supply theoretical basis for extended application of this beneficial trait.
NA	Transcription Factors Rc and OsVP 1 Coordinately Regulate Preharvest Sprouting Tolerance in Red Pericarp Rice	2021	J Agric Food Chem	Key Laboratory of Soybean Molecular Design Breeding, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Harbin 150081, China.	Red pericarp associates with seed dormancy or preharvest sprouting (PHS) tolerance in crops. To identify this association's molecular mechanism, a PHS mutant Osviviparous1 (Osvp1) was characterized in rice and crossed with Kasalath, a red pericarp cultivar with Rc (red coleoptiles) genotype. Among the dehulled seeds of F2 progenies, RcRcvp1vp1 seeds performed a lower PHS rate than rcrcvp1vp1 seeds and showed shallower pigmentation than RcRcVP1VP1 seeds. Kasalath and SL9 (an RcRcVP1VP1 substitution line with Nipponbare background) showed more ABA sensitivity than the Nipponbare (rcrcVP1VP1) by the germination assay, and the transcriptional abundance of ABA signal genes OsABI2, OsSnRK2, OsVP1, ABI5, and especially OsVP1 increased in the red pericarp line SL9. Moreover, OsVP1 can directly bind Rc (bHLH) promoter by yeast one-hybrid, which activates Rc and OsLAR expression in red pericarp rice. Furthermore, a luciferase complementation imaging assay showed that OsVP1 interacts with transcriptions factors Rc and OsC1. These results indicate that OsVP1 promotes proanthocyanidin accumulation through the interaction among OsVP1, Rc, and OsC1 and then increases the plant's ABA sensitivity and PHS resistance.
NA	A rice R2R3-MYB (OsC1) transcriptional regulator improves oxidative stress tolerance by modulating anthocyanin biosynthesis	2021	Physiol Plant	Plant Functional Genomics Laboratory, Department of Botany, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India.	The R2R3 type MYB transcription factors participate in controlling flavonoid production in plants, including anthocyanin and proanthocyanin. Black rice with high anthocyanin content is an important candidate for understanding R2R3-MYB-based regulation of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway (ABP). This study was undertaken to draw the functional relationship of an R2R3-MYB protein with anthocyanin biosynthesis and oxidative stress tolerance in plants. The expression levels of the late ABP genes in the panicle stage of black rice were in good agreement with the accumulation of anthocyanin, especially cyanidin 3-glucoside. Among all MYB genes present in rice, an R2R3 type (C1) regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis and was studied further. The positive correlation between the expression of ABP genes and OsC1 along with the nuclear localization of OsC1 are in line with its possible involvement as a transcriptional regulator of ABP genes. Interestingly, OsC1 overexpressed in white rice plants triggered anthocyanin production through augmentation of the transcript level of late ABP genes. Moreover, OsC1-transformed plants exhibited a lower amount of reactive oxygen species upon exposure to oxidative stress. The increased anthocyanin content in white rice seedlings resulted in higher photosynthetic efficiency, less membrane damage and consequently lower oxidative stress. The OsC1 transcriptional regulator helps to ameliorate oxidative stresses in plants owing to its anthocyanin modulating ability.
