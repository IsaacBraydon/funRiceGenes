ART1	OsCDT3	A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance	A transcription factor for Al tolerance, ART1, regulates the expression of at least 30 genes in rice. Here we functionally characterized one of the downstream genes, OsCDT3, which encodes a predicted peptide of only 53 amino acid residues rich in cysteine.
