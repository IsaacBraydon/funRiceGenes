OsCDT3	aluminum tolerance	A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance	OsCDT3 was mainly expressed in the roots and its expression was specifically induced by Al exposure, not by low pH and other metals.
OsCDT3	aluminum tolerance	A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance	Expression of OsCDT3 in yeast conferred tolerance to Al, but not to Cd.
OsCDT3	aluminum tolerance	A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance	Taken together, our results indicate that OsCDT3 anchoring to the plasma membrane may play a role in stopping entry of Al into the root cells by binding Al, therefore, contributing to high Al tolerance in rice.
OsCDT3	root	A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance	OsCDT3 was mainly expressed in the roots and its expression was specifically induced by Al exposure, not by low pH and other metals.
