OsCP1	anther development	The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages	 Moreover, overexpression of OsDIL lessened the down-regulation by drought of anther developmental genes (OsC4, CYP704B2 and OsCP1), providing a mechanism supporting pollen fertility under drought
OsCP1	pollen	The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages	 Moreover, overexpression of OsDIL lessened the down-regulation by drought of anther developmental genes (OsC4, CYP704B2 and OsCP1), providing a mechanism supporting pollen fertility under drought
OsCP1	anther	Isolation and characterization of a rice cysteine protease gene, OSCP1, using T-DNA gene-trap system	 GUS assay with the T-DNA tagged line indicated that the OsCP1 promoter was highly active in the rice anther
OsCP1	anther	The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages	 Moreover, overexpression of OsDIL lessened the down-regulation by drought of anther developmental genes (OsC4, CYP704B2 and OsCP1), providing a mechanism supporting pollen fertility under drought
OsCP1	fertility	The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages	 Moreover, overexpression of OsDIL lessened the down-regulation by drought of anther developmental genes (OsC4, CYP704B2 and OsCP1), providing a mechanism supporting pollen fertility under drought
OsCP1	pollen	Isolation and characterization of a rice cysteine protease gene, OSCP1, using T-DNA gene-trap system	 Taken together, the results demonstrated that OsCP1 is a cysteine protease gene that might play an important role in pollen development
