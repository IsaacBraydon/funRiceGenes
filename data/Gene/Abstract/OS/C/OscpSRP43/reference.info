NA	Oryza sativa Chloroplast Signal Recognition Particle 43 (OscpSRP43) Is Required for Chloroplast Development and Photosynthesis.	2015	PLoS One	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China.	A rice chlorophyll-deficient mutant w67 was isolated from an ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-induced IR64 (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica) mutant bank. The mutant exhibited a distinct yellow-green leaf phenotype in the whole plant growth duration with significantly reduced levels of chlorophyll and carotenoid, impaired chloroplast development and lowered capacity of photosynthesis compared with the wild-type IR64. Expression of a number of genes associated with chlorophyll metabolism, chloroplast biogenesis and photosynthesis was significantly altered in the mutant. Genetic analysis indicated that the yellow-green phenotype was controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene located on the short arm of chromosome 3. Using map-based strategy, the mutation was isolated and predicted to encode a chloroplast signal recognition particle 43 KD protein (cpSRP43) with 388 amino acid residuals. A single base substitution from A to T at position 160 resulted in a premature stop codon. OscpSRP43 was constitutively expressed in various organs with the highest level in the leaf. Functional complementation could rescue the mutant phenotype and subcellular localization showed that the cpSRP43:GFP fusion protein was targeted to the chloroplast. The data suggested that Oryza sativa cpSRP43 (OscpSRP43) was required for the normal development of chloroplasts and photosynthesis in rice.
NA	PGL3 is required for chlorophyll synthesis and impacts leaf senescence in rice	2018	J Zhejiang Univ Sci B	College of Agronomy, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang 110866, China.	Rice leaf color mutants play a great role in research about the formation and development of chloroplasts and the genetic mechanism of the chlorophyll (Chl) metabolism pathway. pgl3 is a rice leaf color mutant derived from Xiushui11 (Oryza sativa L. spp. japonica), treated with ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS). The  mutant exhibited a pale-green leaf (pgl) phenotype throughout the whole development as well as reduced grain quality. Map-based cloning of PGL3 revealed  that it encodes the chloroplast signal recognition particle 43 kDa protein (cpSRP43). PGL3 affected the Chl synthesis by regulating the expression levels of the Chl synthesis-associated genes. Considerable reactive oxygen species were accumulated in the leaves of pgl3, and the transcription levels of its scavenging genes were down-regulated, indicating that pgl3 can accelerate senescence. In addition, high temperatures could inhibit the plant's growth and facilitate the process of senescence in pgl3.
