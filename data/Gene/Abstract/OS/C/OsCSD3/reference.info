NA	Biochemical and functional characterization of OsCSD3, a novel CuZn superoxide dismutase from rice.	2018	Biochem J	Molecular Biology Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, 400085, India.	Superoxide dismutases (SODs, EC 1.15.1.1) belong to an important group of antioxidant metalloenzymes. Multiple SODs exist for scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in different cellular compartments to maintain an intricate ROS balance. The present study deals with molecular and biochemical characterization of CuZn SOD encoded by LOC_Os03g11960 (referred to as OsCSD3), which is the least studied among the four rice isozymes. The OsCSD3 showed higher similarity to peroxisomal SODs in plants. The OsCSD3 transcript was up-regulated in response to salinity, drought and oxidative stress. Full-length cDNA encoding OsCSD3 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and analyzed for spectral characteristics. UV-visible spectroscopic analysis showed evidences of d-d transitions, while circular dichroism analysis indicated high ¦Â-sheet content in the protein.<U+00A0> The OsCSD3 existed as homodimer (~36 kDa) with both Cu2+ and Zn2+ metal cofactors was substantially active over a wide pH range (7.0-10.8), with optimum pH of 9.0. The enzyme was sensitive to diethyl dithiocarbamate (DDC) but insensitive to sodium azide (NaN3), which are the characteristics features of CuZn SODs. The enzyme also exhibited bicarbonate dependent peroxidase activity. Unlike several other known CuZn SODs, OsCSD3 showed higher tolerance to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and thermal inactivation. Heterologous over-expression of OsCSD3 enhanced tolerance of E. coli sod double knockout (<U+2206>sodA <U+2206>sodB) mutant and wild type strain against methyl viologen induced oxidative stress indicating the in vivo function of this enzyme. The results show that the locus LOC_Os03g11960 of rice encodes a functional CuZn SOD with biochemical characteristics similar to the peroxisomal isozymes.
