OsCSD3	oxidative stress	Biochemical and functional characterization of OsCSD3, a novel CuZn superoxide dismutase from rice.	 The OsCSD3 transcript was up-regulated in response to salinity, drought and oxidative stress
OsCSD3	drought	Biochemical and functional characterization of OsCSD3, a novel CuZn superoxide dismutase from rice.	 The OsCSD3 transcript was up-regulated in response to salinity, drought and oxidative stress
OsCSD3	tolerance	Biochemical and functional characterization of OsCSD3, a novel CuZn superoxide dismutase from rice.	 Unlike several other known CuZn SODs, OsCSD3 showed higher tolerance to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and thermal inactivation
OsCSD3	tolerance	Biochemical and functional characterization of OsCSD3, a novel CuZn superoxide dismutase from rice.	 Heterologous over-expression of OsCSD3 enhanced tolerance of E
OsCSD3	oxidative	Biochemical and functional characterization of OsCSD3, a novel CuZn superoxide dismutase from rice.	 The OsCSD3 transcript was up-regulated in response to salinity, drought and oxidative stress
OsCSD3	stress	Biochemical and functional characterization of OsCSD3, a novel CuZn superoxide dismutase from rice.	 The OsCSD3 transcript was up-regulated in response to salinity, drought and oxidative stress
