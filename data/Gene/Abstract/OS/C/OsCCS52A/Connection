OsCCS52A|TAD|TE	OsCDC27	The SnRK2-APC/C(TE) regulatory module mediates the antagonistic action of gibberellic acid and abscisic acid pathways	Yeast two-hybrid assay showing that TE interacts with MOC1 and OsCDC27, but not with MOC1d and MOC1-m
MOC1	OsCCS52A|TAD|TE	Rice APC/CTE controls tillering by mediating the degradation of MONOCULM 1	TE physically interacts with MOC1 and OsCDC27
OsCCS52A|TAD|TE	OSH1|Oskn1	Rice RS2-9, which is bound by transcription factor OSH1, blocks enhancer-promoter interactions in plants.	 We also demonstrated that OSH1 binding sites were associated with 72% of the boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs) identified in the rice genome, which is comparable to the 77% of TAD boundaries bound by the insulator CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in mammals
OsCCS52A|TAD|TE	OsMet1-2|OsMET1b	Chromatin architectural alterations due to null mutation of a major CG methylase in rice.	 Chromatin structural changes occurred in osmet1-2, including intra-/inter-chromosomal interactions, compartment transition, and topologically associated domains (TAD) variations
