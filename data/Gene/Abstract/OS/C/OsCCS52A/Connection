OsCCS52A|TAD|TE	OsCDC27	The SnRK2-APC/C(TE) regulatory module mediates the antagonistic action of gibberellic acid and abscisic acid pathways	Yeast two-hybrid assay showing that TE interacts with MOC1 and OsCDC27, but not with MOC1d and MOC1-m
MOC1	OsCCS52A|TAD|TE	Rice APC/CTE controls tillering by mediating the degradation of MONOCULM 1	TE physically interacts with MOC1 and OsCDC27
OsCCS52A|TAD|TE	OsDRM2	The ortholog of DDM1 is mainly required for CHG and CG methylation of heterochromatin and is involved in DRM2-mediated CHH methylation that targets mostly genic regions of the rice genome.	Here, we analyzed the function of OsDDM1 and OsDRM2 in genome-wide DNA methylation, TE repression, small RNA accumulation, and gene expression
