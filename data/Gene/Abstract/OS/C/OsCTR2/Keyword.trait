OsCTR2	tiller number	Rice CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE-RESPONSE2 is involved in the ethylene-receptor signalling and regulation of various aspects of rice growth and development	Yield-related agronomic traits, including flowering time and effective tiller number, were altered in osctr2 and 35S:OsCTR2 (1-513) transgenic lines
OsCTR2	growth	Rice CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE-RESPONSE2 is involved in the ethylene-receptor signalling and regulation of various aspects of rice growth and development	The osctr2 loss-of-function mutation and expression of the 35S:OsCTR2 (1-513) transgene that encodes the OsCTR2 N terminus (residues 1-513) revealed several and many aspects, respectively, of ethylene-induced growth alteration in rice
OsCTR2	growth	Rice CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE-RESPONSE2 is involved in the ethylene-receptor signalling and regulation of various aspects of rice growth and development	Because the osctr2 allele did not produce all aspects of ethylene-induced growth alteration, the ethylene-receptor signal output might be mediated in part by OsCTR2 and by other components in rice
OsCTR2	growth	Rice CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE-RESPONSE2 is involved in the ethylene-receptor signalling and regulation of various aspects of rice growth and development	Our understanding of roles of ethylene in various aspects of growth and development in japonica rice varieties could be advanced with the use of the osctr2 and 35S:OsCTR2 (1-513) transgenic lines
