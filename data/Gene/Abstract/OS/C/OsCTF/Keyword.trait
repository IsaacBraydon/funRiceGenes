OsCTF	tolerance	Identification of epigenetic mechanisms in paddy crop associated with lowering environmentally related cadmium risks to food safety.	 We functionally identified a new locus for a putative cadmium tolerance factor (here termed as OsCTF) and demonstrated that Cd-induced DNA demethylation is the drive of OsCTF expression
OsCTF	cadmium	Identification of epigenetic mechanisms in paddy crop associated with lowering environmentally related cadmium risks to food safety.	 We functionally identified a new locus for a putative cadmium tolerance factor (here termed as OsCTF) and demonstrated that Cd-induced DNA demethylation is the drive of OsCTF expression
OsCTF	demethylation	Identification of epigenetic mechanisms in paddy crop associated with lowering environmentally related cadmium risks to food safety.	 We functionally identified a new locus for a putative cadmium tolerance factor (here termed as OsCTF) and demonstrated that Cd-induced DNA demethylation is the drive of OsCTF expression
OsCTF	cadmium tolerance	Identification of epigenetic mechanisms in paddy crop associated with lowering environmentally related cadmium risks to food safety.	 We functionally identified a new locus for a putative cadmium tolerance factor (here termed as OsCTF) and demonstrated that Cd-induced DNA demethylation is the drive of OsCTF expression
