NA	Loss of function mutations in the rice chromomethylase OsCMT3a cause a burst of transposition.	2015	Plant J	National Institute of Genetics, Yata 1111, Mishima, Shizuoka, 411-8540, Japan.	The methylation patterns of plants are unique in that besides the methylation at CG dinucleotides, which occurs in mammals as well, methylation also occurs at non-CG sites. Genes are methylated at CG sites, but transposable elements (TEs) are methylated at both CG and non-CG sites. The role of non-CG methylation in the transcriptional silencing of TEs is being extensively studied, but only very rare transpositions have been reported when the non-CG methylation machineries were compromised. To understand the role of non-CG methylation in the suppression of TEs and in plant development, we characterized rice mutants of the chromomethylase gene, OsCMT3a. oscmt3a mutants exhibited a dramatic decrease in CHG methylation, changes in expression of a number of genes and TEs, and pleiotropic developmental abnormalities. Genome resequencing identified eight TE families mobilized in oscmt3a during normal propagation. These TEs include tissue-culture-activated copia retrotransposons Tos17 and Tos19 (Lullaby), a pericentromeric clustered high-copy-number non-autonomous gypsy retrotransposon Dasheng, two copia retrotransposons Osr4 and Osr13, a hAT-tip100 transposon DaiZ, a MITE transposon mPing, and a LINE element LINE1-6_OS. We confirmed the transposition of these TEs by PCR and/or Southern analysis, and showed that the transposition depends on the oscmt3a mutation. These results demonstrated that OsCMT3a-mediated non-CG DNA methylations play a critical role in development and in the suppression of a wide spectrum of TEs. These in planta mobile TEs are significant for studying the interaction between TEs and the host genome, and for rice functional genomics. This article is protected by copyright.
