NA	Overexpression of the OsChI1 gene, encoding a putative laccase precursor, increases tolerance to drought and salinity stress in transgenic Arabidopsis.	2014	Gene	Plant Genomics Lab., Department of Applied Plant Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 200-713, Republic of Korea.	In a previous study, we identified a number of genes induced by chilling using a microarray approach. In order to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying chilling tolerance and possible crosstalk with other abiotic stresses, we selected a rice gene, OsChI1 (Os01g61160), for further analysis. The OsChI1 gene encodes a putative laccase precursor protein. In accordance with our previous results, its transcript is highly accumulated during a 12-day period of chilling treatment. Higher expression of the OsChI1 gene was also detected in roots and tissues at the vegetative and productive stages. In addition, we also observed increased transcript levels of the OsChI1 gene during dehydration and high salinity conditions. Transient expression of OsChI1 proteins tagged with fluorescence protein in rice protoplasts revealed that OsChI1 is localized in the plasma membrane. The Arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing OsChI1-EGFP resulted in an increased tolerance to drought and salinity stress. In silico analysis of OsChI1 suggests that several genes coexpressed with OsChI1 in the root during various abiotic stresses, such as chilling, drought and salt stress, may play an important role in the ROS signaling pathway. Potential roles of OsChI1 in response to abiotic stresses are discussed.
NA	Biochemical and Molecular Characterization of the Rice Chalcone Isomerase Family.	2021	Plants (Basel)	Department of Genetics and Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 17104, Korea.	Chalcone isomerase (CHI) is a key enzyme in flavonoid biosynthesis. In plants, CHIs occur in multigene families, and they are divided into four types, types I-IV. Type I and II CHIs are bona fide CHIs with CHI activity, and type III and IV CHIs are non-catalytic members with different functions. Rice contains seven CHI family genes (OsCHIs). Molecular analysis suggested that OsCHI3 is a type I CHI, and the other OsCHIs were classified into types III and IV. To elucidate their biochemical functions, OsCHI1, OsCHI3, OsCHI6, and OsCHI7 were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant OsCHI proteins were purified. An activity assay of recombinant OsCHIs showed that OsCHI3 catalyzed the isomerization of naringenin chalcone and isoliquiritigenin, whereas the other recombinant OsCHIs had no CHI activity. OsCHI3 also exhibited a strong preference to naringenin chalcone compared to isoliquiritigenin, which agrees well with the catalytic properties of type I CHIs. These results ascertain OsCHI3 to be a bona fide CHI in rice. OsCHI3 and the other OsCHIs were expressed constitutively throughout the rice growth period and different tissues. OsCHI3 expression was induced immediately in response to ultra-violet (UV) stress, suggesting its involvement in the biosynthesis of sakuranetin, a flavonoid phytoalexin in rice.
