OsCML16	OsERF48|OsDRAP1	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance
OsCML16	OsERF48|OsDRAP1	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance	Our results demonstrated that OsERF48 regulates OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that  enhance root growth and drought tolerance.
OsCML16	OsPi304	OsCML16 interacts with a novel CC-NBS-LRR protein OsPi304 in the Ca2+/Mg2+ dependent and independent manner in rice.	OsCML16 interacts with a novel CC-NBS-LRR protein OsPi304 in the Ca2+/Mg2+ dependent and independent manner in rice.
OsCML16	OsPi304	OsCML16 interacts with a novel CC-NBS-LRR protein OsPi304 in the Ca2+/Mg2+ dependent and independent manner in rice.	 In addition, transcript levels of OsCML16 and OsPi304 were induced more markedly in Nipponbare than in 9311 under cold stress
