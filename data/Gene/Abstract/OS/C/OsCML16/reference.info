NA	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Graduate School of International Agricultural Technology and Crop Biotechnology Institute/GreenBio Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Pyeongchang, 25354, Korea.	The AP2/ERF family is a plant-specific transcription factor (TF) family whose members have been associated with various developmental processes and stress tolerance. Here, we functionally characterized the drought-inducible OsERF48, a group Ib member of the rice ERF family with four conserved motifs, CMI-1, -2, -3 and -4. A transactivation assay in yeast revealed that the C-terminal CMI-1 motif was essential for OsERF48 transcriptional activity. When OsERF48 was overexpressed in an either a root-specific (ROX(OsERF48) ) or whole-body (OX(OsERF48) ) manner, transgenic plants showed a longer and denser root phenotype compared to the nontransgenic (NT) controls. When plants were grown on a 40% polyethylene glycol (PEG)-infused medium under in vitro drought conditions, ROX(OsERF48) plants showed a more vigorous root growth than OX(OsERF48) and NT plants. In addition, the ROX(OsERF48) plants exhibited higher grain yield than OX(OsERF48) and NT plants under field-drought conditions. We constructed a putative OsERF48 regulatory network by cross-referencing ROX(OsERF48) root-specific RNA-seq data with a co-expression network database, from which we inferred the involvement of 20 drought-related genes in OsERF48-mediated responses. These included genes annotated as being involved in stress signaling, carbohydrate metabolism, cell-wall proteins, and drought-responses. They included, OsCML16, a key gene in calcium signaling during abiotic stress, which was shown to be a direct target of OsERF48 by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR analysis and a transient protoplast expression assay. Our results demonstrated that OsERF48 regulates OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhance root growth and drought tolerance. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
NA	Identification of novel OsCML16 target proteins and differential expression analysis under abiotic stresses in rice.	2020	J Plant Physiol	MOA Key Laboratory of Crop Ecophysiology and Farming System in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China; College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs) have been shown to play key regulatory roles in calcium signaling in plants. However, few bona-fide CMLs binding proteins have been characterized in rice, a monocot model plant. Here, through large-scale screening of a yeast-two hybrid (Y2H) cDNA library with OsCML16 as a bait, six new putative interacting partners of OsCML16 were discovered and confirmed by both pairwise Y2H and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. Interestingly, the in vitro peptide-binding assays manifested that OsERD2 could bind both OsCaM1 and OsCML16 whereas other five target proteins could specifically bind OsCML16 but not OsCaM1. Furthermore, Ca2+ and TFP, a calmodulin (CaM) antagonist, were involved in the ABA-induced transcription of OsCML16 and its target genes, and they were also obviously induced by cold, drought, and salt stresses. Taken together, our new findings have provided the basis for the novel signaling pathways of OsCML16 in the abiotic stress response in rice.
