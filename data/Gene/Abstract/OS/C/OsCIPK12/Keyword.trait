OsCIPK12	drought	Characterization of stress-responsive CIPK genes in rice for stress tolerance improvement	 Transgenic plants overexpressing the transgenes OsCIPK03, OsCIPK12, and OsCIPK15 showed significantly improved tolerance to cold, drought, and salt stress, respectively
OsCIPK12	drought	Characterization of stress-responsive CIPK genes in rice for stress tolerance improvement	Under cold and drought stresses, OsCIPK03- and OsCIPK12-overexpressing transgenic plants accumulated significantly higher contents of proline and soluble sugars than the wild type
OsCIPK12	salt stress	Characterization of stress-responsive CIPK genes in rice for stress tolerance improvement	 Transgenic plants overexpressing the transgenes OsCIPK03, OsCIPK12, and OsCIPK15 showed significantly improved tolerance to cold, drought, and salt stress, respectively
OsCIPK12	salt	Characterization of stress-responsive CIPK genes in rice for stress tolerance improvement	 Transgenic plants overexpressing the transgenes OsCIPK03, OsCIPK12, and OsCIPK15 showed significantly improved tolerance to cold, drought, and salt stress, respectively
