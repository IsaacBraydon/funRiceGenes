Calmodulin (CaM) proteins, members of the EF-hand family of Ca(2+)- binding proteins, represent important relays in plant calcium signals. Here, OsCam1-1 was isolated by PCR amplification from the rice genome. The gene contains an ORF of 450 base pairs with a single intron at the same position found in other plant Cam genes. A promoter region with a TATA box at position-26 was predicted and fused to a gus reporter gene, and this construct was used to produce transgenic rice by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. GUS activity was observed in all organs examined and throughout tissues in cross-sections, but activity was strongest in the vascular bundles of leaves and the vascular cylinders of roots. To examine the properties of OsCaM1-1, the encoding cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli. The electrophoretic mobility shift when incubated with Ca(2+) indicates that recombinant OsCaM1-1 is a functional Ca(2+)-binding protein. In addition, OsCaM1-1 bound the CaMKII target peptide confirming its likely functionality as a calmodulin.

In both rice lines, salt-stress induced OsP5CS1 gene expression, suggesting that proline accumulation occurs via OsP5CS1 gene expression during salt stress. An increase in the endogenous ABA level was required for the induction of OsP5CS1 gene expression by salt stress. Under salt stress, topical ABA application-induced OsP5CS1 gene expression only in the salt-resistant line but up-regulated OsP5CR gene expression in both rice lines, suggesting that the increased proline accumulation and salt resistance induced by topical ABA application may result from the up-regulation of OsP5CR and not, directly at least, from OsP5CS1. Moreover, exogenous ABA application up-regulates OsCam1-1 (the salt-stress-responsive calmodulin) gene expression, and calmodulin was shown to play a role in the signal transduction cascade in proline accumulation during salt stress. These data suggest the role of the calmodulin signaling cascade and the induction of OsP5CR gene expression in proline accumulation by exogenous ABA application.
1471-2229-7-4.pdf	Genome-wide identification and analyses of the rice calmodulin and related potential calcium sensor proteins	2007	BMC Plant Biol	Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Payathai Road, Patumwan, Bangkok 10330, Thailand. b.bongkoj@gmail.com	BACKGROUND: A wide range of stimuli evoke rapid and transient increases in [Ca2+]cyt in plant cells which are transmitted by protein sensors that contain EF-hand motifs. Here, a group of Oryza sativa L. genes encoding calmodulin (CaM) and CaM-like (CML) proteins that do not possess functional domains other than the Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs was analyzed. RESULTS: By functional analyses and BLAST searches of the TIGR rice database, a maximum number of 243 proteins that possibly have EF-hand motifs were identified in the rice genome. Using a neighbor-joining tree based on amino acid sequence similarity, five loci were defined as Cam genes and thirty two additional CML genes were identified. Extensive analyses of the gene structures, the chromosome locations, the EF-hand motif organization, expression characteristics including analysis by RT-PCR and a comparative analysis of Cam and CML genes in rice and Arabidopsis are presented. CONCLUSION: Although many proteins have unknown functions, the complexity of this gene family indicates the importance of Ca2+-signals in regulating cellular responses to stimuli and this family of proteins likely plays a critical role as their transducers.

We investigated heat shock (HS)-triggered Ca(2+) signalling transduced by a Ca(2+) sensor, calmodulin (CaM), linked to early transcriptome changes of HS-responsive genes in rice. We observed a biphasic [Ca(2+) ](cyt) signature in root cells that was distinct from that in epicotyl and leaf cells, which showed a monophasic response after HS. Treatment with Ca(2+) and A23187 generated an intense and sustained increase in [Ca(2+) ](cyt) in response to HS. Conversely, treatment with Ca(2+) chelator, L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker and CaM antagonist, but not intracellular Ca(2+) release inhibitor, strongly inhibited the increased [Ca(2+) ](cyt) . HS combined with Ca(2+) and A23187 accelerated the expression of OsCaM1-1 and sHSPC/N genes, which suggests that the HS-induced apoplastic Ca(2+) influx is responsible for the [Ca(2+) ](cyt) response and downstream HS signalling. In addition, the biphasic response of OsCaM1-1 in the nucleus followed the Ca(2+) signature, which may provide the information necessary to direct HS-related gene expression. Overexpression of OsCaM1-1 induced the expression of Ca(2+) /HS-related AtCBK3, AtPP7, AtHSF and AtHSP at a non-inducing temperature and enhanced intrinsic thermotolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis. Therefore, HS-triggered rapid increases in [Ca(2+) ](cyt) , together with OsCaM1-1 expression and its nuclear localization, are important in mediating downstream HS-related gene expression for the acquisition of thermotolerance in rice.
