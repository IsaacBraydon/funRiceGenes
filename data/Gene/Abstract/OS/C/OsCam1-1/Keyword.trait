OsCam1-1	salt	Exogenous ABA induces salt tolerance in indica rice (Oryza sativa L.): The role of OsP5CS1 and OsP5CR gene expression during salt stress	 Moreover, exogenous ABA application up-regulates OsCam1-1 (the salt-stress-responsive calmodulin) gene expression, and calmodulin was shown to play a role in the signal transduction cascade in proline accumulation during salt stress
OsCam1-1	salt stress	Exogenous ABA induces salt tolerance in indica rice (Oryza sativa L.): The role of OsP5CS1 and OsP5CR gene expression during salt stress	 Moreover, exogenous ABA application up-regulates OsCam1-1 (the salt-stress-responsive calmodulin) gene expression, and calmodulin was shown to play a role in the signal transduction cascade in proline accumulation during salt stress

OsCam1-1	temperature	Heat shock-induced biphasic Ca(2+) signature and OsCaM1-1 nuclear localization mediate downstream signalling in acquisition of thermotolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Overexpression of OsCaM1-1 induced the expression of Ca(2+) /HS-related AtCBK3, AtPP7, AtHSF and AtHSP at a non-inducing temperature and enhanced intrinsic thermotolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis
