GSE5	OsCam1-1	Natural Variation in the Promoter of GSE5 Contributes to Grain Size Diversity in Rice.	 GSE5 encodes a plasma membrane-associated protein with IQ domains (IQD), which interacts with the rice calmodulin protein, OsCaM1-1
GW5L	OsCam1-1	GW5-Like, a homolog of GW5, negatively regulates grain width, weight and salt resistance in rice.	 We also show that GW5L could confer salt stress resistance through an association with calmodulin protein OsCaM1-1
