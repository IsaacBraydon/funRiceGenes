GSE5	OsCam1-1	Natural Variation in the Promoter of GSE5 Contributes to Grain Size Diversity in Rice.	 GSE5 encodes a plasma membrane-associated protein with IQ domains (IQD), which interacts with the rice calmodulin protein, OsCaM1-1
GW5L	OsCam1-1	GW5-Like, a homolog of GW5, negatively regulates grain width, weight and salt resistance in rice.	 We also show that GW5L could confer salt stress resistance through an association with calmodulin protein OsCaM1-1
OsCam1-1	OsCam1-2|OsCam1	Downstream components of the calmodulin signaling pathway in the rice salt stress response revealed by transcriptome profiling and target identification.	 GO terms enriched in their associated proteins that matched those of the differentially expressed genes affected by OsCam1-1 overexpression revealed various downstream cellular processes that could potentially be regulated by OsCaM1 through their actions
