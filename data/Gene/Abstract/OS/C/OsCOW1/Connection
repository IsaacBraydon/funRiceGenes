OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7	OsYUCCA1|OsYUC1	Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMO(t) in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase	 OsFMO(t) showed high amino acid sequence identity with FMO proteins from other plants, in particular with YUCCA from Arabidopsis, FLOOZY from Petunia, and OsYUCCA1 from rice
NAL1|qFLW4	OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7	Genetic analysis of rice mutants responsible for narrow leaf phenotype and reduced vein number.	 In this paper, we examined the function of four genes that regulate the width of the leaf blade and the vein number: NARROW LEAF1 (NAL1), NAL2, NAL3 and NAL7
NAL1|qFLW4	OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7	Genetic analysis of rice mutants responsible for narrow leaf phenotype and reduced vein number.	 The nal7 mutation showed additive effects on both leaf width and vein number, when combined with the nal1 single or the nal2 nal3 double mutation
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7	Genetic analysis of rice mutants responsible for narrow leaf phenotype and reduced vein number.	 In this paper, we examined the function of four genes that regulate the width of the leaf blade and the vein number: NARROW LEAF1 (NAL1), NAL2, NAL3 and NAL7
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7	Genetic analysis of rice mutants responsible for narrow leaf phenotype and reduced vein number.	 The nal7 mutation showed additive effects on both leaf width and vein number, when combined with the nal1 single or the nal2 nal3 double mutation
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7	Genetic analysis of rice mutants responsible for narrow leaf phenotype and reduced vein number.	 In addition, observations of inner tissues revealed that cell differentiation was partially compromised in the nal2 nal3 nal7 mutant, consistent with the severe reduction in leaf width in this triple mutant
