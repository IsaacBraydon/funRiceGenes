OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7	 To understand DNL-4 function in rice, we analyzed the expression levels of leaf growth-related genes, such as NAL1, NAL7, and CSLD4, in the dnl-4 mutant |  Expression of NAL1 and NAL7 was downregulated in the dnl-4 mutant compared to the wild type |  The observation that DNL-4 expression corresponded with that of NAL1 and NAL7 is consistent with the narrow leaf phenotype of the dnl-4 mutant
