OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7	 To understand DNL-4 function in rice, we analyzed the expression levels of leaf growth-related genes, such as NAL1, NAL7, and CSLD4, in the dnl-4 mutant |  Expression of NAL1 and NAL7 was downregulated in the dnl-4 mutant compared to the wild type |  The observation that DNL-4 expression corresponded with that of NAL1 and NAL7 is consistent with the narrow leaf phenotype of the dnl-4 mutant
OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7|OsYUC8	 Further investigation revealed that the transcription factor basic region and leucine zipper 46 (OsbZIP46), involved in ABA signaling, can directly bind to the YUCCA8/rice ethylene-insensitive 7 (OsYUC8/REIN7) promoter to activate its expression, and genetic analysis revealed that OsYUC8/REIN7 is located downstream of OsbZIP46
