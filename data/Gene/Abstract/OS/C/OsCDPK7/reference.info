A rice gene encoding a calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK), OsCDPK7, was induced by cold and salt stresses. To elucidate the physiological function of OsCDPK7, we generated transgenic rice plants with altered levels of the protein. The extent of tolerance to cold and salt/drought stresses of these plants correlated well with the level of OsCDPK7 expression. Therefore, OsCDPK7 was shown to be a positive regulator commonly involved in the tolerance to both stresses in rice. Over-expression of OsCDPK7 enhanced induction of some stress-responsive genes in response to salinity/drought, but not to cold. Thus, it was suggested that the downstream pathways leading to the cold and salt/drought tolerance are different from each other. It seems likely that at least two distinct pathways commonly use a single CDPK, maintaining the signalling specificity through unknown post-translational regulation mechanisms. These results demonstrate that simple manipulation of CDPK activity has great potential with regard to plant improvement.
Plant Cell Physiol-2001-Saijo-1228-33.pdf	A Ca2+-Dependent Protein Kinase that Endows Rice Plants with Cold- and Salt-Stress Tolerance Functions in Vascular Bundles	2001	Plant and Cell Physiology	Laboratory of Plant Physiology, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8502 Japan 	A rice Ca2+-dependent protein kinase, OsCDPK7, is a positive regulator commonly involved in the tolerance to cold and salt/drought. We carried out in situ detection of the transcript and immunolocalization of the protein. In the wild-type rice plants under both stress conditions, OsCDPK7 was expressed predominantly in vascular tissues of crowns and roots, vascular bundles and central cylinder, respectively, where water stress occurs most severely. This enzyme was also expressed in the peripheral cylinder of crown vascular bundles and root sclerenchyma. Similar localization patterns with stronger signals were observed in stress-tolerant OsCDPK7 over-expressing transformants with the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The transcript of a putative target gene of the OsCDPK7 signaling pathway, rab16A, was also detected essentially in the same tissues upon salt stress, suggesting that the OsCDPK7 pathway operates predominantly in these regions. We propose that the use of the 35S promoter fortuitously strengthened the localized expression of OsCDPK7, resulting in enhancement of the stress signaling in the inherently operating regions leading to improved stress tolerance.
