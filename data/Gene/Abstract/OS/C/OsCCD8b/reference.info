Here, we identified a rice mutant htd2 from one of the 15,000 transgenic rice lines, which is characterized by a high tillering and dwarf phenotype. Phenotypic analysis of the mutant showed that the mutation did not affect formation of tiller bud, but promoted the subsequent outgrowth of tiller bud. To isolate the htd2 gene, a map-based cloning strategy was employed and 17 new insertions-deletions (InDels) markers were developed. A high-resolution physical map of the chromosomal region around the htd2 gene was made using the F(2) and F(3) population. Finally, the gene was mapped in 12.8 kb region between marker HT41 and marker HT52 within the BAC clone OSJNBa0009J13. Cloning and sequencing of the target region from the mutant showed that the T-DNA insertion caused a 463 bp deletion between the promoter and first exon of an esterase/lipase/thioesterase family gene in the 12.8 kb region. Furthermore, transgenic rice with reduced expression level of the gene exhibited an enhanced tillering and dwarf phenotype. Accordingly, the esterase/lipase/thioesterase family gene (TIGR locus Os03g10620) was identified as the HTD2 gene. HTD2 transcripts were expressed mainly in leaf. Loss of function of HTD2 resulted in a significantly increased expression of HTD1, D10 and D3, which were involved in the strigolactone biosynthetic pathway. The results suggest that the HTD2 gene could negatively regulate tiller bud outgrowth by the strigolactone pathway.
82_361.pdf	Rice tillering dwarf mutant dwarf3 has increased leaf longevity during darkness-induced senescence or hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death	2007	Genes Genet Syst	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo	Senescence or cell death in plant leaves is known to be inducible by darkness or H2O2. When the Arabidopsis gene MAX2/ORE9 is disrupted, leaf senescence or cell death in response to the above stimuli is delayed. Because the rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene DWARF3 (D3) is orthologous to MAX2/ORE9, we wished to know whether disruption of D3 also results in increased longevity in leaves. We found that darkness-induced senescence or H2O2-induced cell death in the third leaf [as measured by chlorophyll degradation, membrane ion leakage and expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs)] in a d3 rice mutant was delayed by 1â€<U+393C><U+3E33>3 d compared to that in its reference line Shiokari. Moreover, the mRNA levels of D3, HTD1 and D10, which are orthologs of Arabidopsis MAX2/ORE9, MAX3 and MAX4, respectively, increased during cell death. These results suggest that D3 protein in rice, like MAX2/ORE9 in Arabidopsis, is involved in leaf senescence or cell death.

Rice tillering is an important agronomic trait for grain production. The HIGH-TILLERING DWARF1 (HTD1) gene encodes an ortholog of Arabidopsis MAX3. Complementation analyses for HTD1 confirm that the defect in HTD1 is responsible for both high-tillering and dwarf phenotypes in the htd1 mutant. The rescue of the Arabidopsis max3 mutant phenotype by the introduction of Pro(35S):HTD1 indicates HTD1 is a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase that has the same function as MAX3 in synthesis of a carotenoid-derived signal molecule. The HTD1 gene is expressed in both shoot and root tissues. By evaluating Pro(HTD1):GUS expression, we found that the HTD1 gene is mainly expressed in vascular bundle tissues throughout the plant. Auxin induction of HTD1 expression suggests that auxin may regulate rice tillering partly through upregulation of HTD1 gene transcription. Restoration of dwarf phenotype after the removal of axillary buds indicates that the dwarfism of the htd1 mutant may be a consequence of excessive tiller production. In addition, the expression of HTD1, D3 and OsCCD8a in the htd1 and d3 mutants suggests a feedback mechanism may exist for the synthesis and perception of the carotenoid-derived signal in rice. Characterization of MAX genes in Arabidopsis, and identification of their orthologs in pea, petunia and rice indicates the existence of a conserved mechanism for shoot-branching regulation in both monocots and dicots.
j.1365-313X.2007.03210.x.pdf	DWARF10, an RMS1/MAX4/DAD1 ortholog, controls lateral bud outgrowth in rice	2007	Plant J	Graduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Yayoi, Bunkyo, Tokyo 113-0032, Japan.	Plant architecture is mostly determined by shoot branching patterns. Apical dominance is a well-known control mechanism in the development of branching patterns, but little is known regarding its role in monocots such as rice. Here, we show that the concept of apical dominance can be applied to tiller bud outgrowth of rice. In dwarf10 (d10), an enhanced branching mutant of rice, apical dominance can be observed, but the inhibitory effects of the apical meristem was reduced. D10 is a rice ortholog of MAX4/RMS1/DAD1 that encodes a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8 and is supposed to be involved in the synthesis of an unidentified inhibitor of shoot branching. D10 expression predominantly occurs in vascular cells in most organs. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that accumulation of D10 mRNA is induced by exogenous auxin. Moreover, D10 expression is upregulated in six branching mutants, d3, d10, d14, d17, d27 and high tillering dwarf (htd1). No such effects were found for D3 or HTD1, the MAX2 and MAX3 orthologs, respectively, of rice. These findings imply that D10 transcription might be a critical step in the regulation of the branching inhibitor pathway. In addition, we present observations that suggest that FINE CULM1 (FC1), a rice ortholog of teosinte branched 1 (tb1), possibly works independently of the branching inhibitor pathway.
j.1744-7909.2010.00960.x.pdf	The interactions among DWARF10, auxin and cytokinin underlie lateral bud outgrowth in rice	2010	J Integr Plant Biol	The State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Previous studies have shown that DWARF10 (D10) is a rice ortholog of MAX4/RMS1/DAD1, encoding a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase and functioning in strigolactones/strigolactone-derivatives (SL) biosynthesis. Here we use D10- RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants similar to d10 mutant in phenotypes to investigate the interactions among D10, auxin and cytokinin in regulating rice shoot branching. Auxin levels in node 1 of both decapitated D10-RNAi and wild type plants decreased significantly, showing that decapitation does reduce endogenous auxin concentration, but decapitation has no clear effects on auxin levels in node 2 of the same plants. This implies that node 1 may be the location where a possible interaction between auxin and D10 gene would be detected. D10 expression in node 1 is inhibited by decapitation, and this inhibition can be restored by exogenous auxin application, indicating that D10 may play an important role in auxin regulation of SL. The decreased expression of most OsPINs in shoot nodes of D10-RNAi plants may cause a reduced auxin transport capacity. Furthermore, effects of auxin treatment of decapitated plants on the expression of cytokinin biosynthetic genes suggest that D10 promotes cytokinin biosynthesis by reducing auxin levels. Besides, in D10-RNAi plants, decreased storage cytokinin levels in the shoot node may partly account for the increased active cytokinin contents, resulting in more tillering phenotypes.
pcq077.pdf	A new lead chemical for strigolactone biosynthesis inhibitors	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo, Tokyo, 113-8657 Japan.	Several triazole-containing chemicals have previously been shown to act as efficient inhibitors of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. To discover a strigolactone biosynthesis inhibitor, we screened a chemical library of triazole derivatives to find chemicals that induce tiller bud outgrowth of rice seedlings. We discovered a triazole-type chemical, TIS13 [2,2-dimethyl-7-phenoxy-4-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)heptan-3-ol], which induced outgrowth of second tiller buds of wild-type seedlings, as observed for non-treated strigolactone-deficient d10 mutant seedlings. TIS13 treatment reduced strigolactone levels in both roots and root exudates in a concentration-dependent manner. Co-application of GR24, a synthetic strigolactone, with TIS13 canceled the TIS13-induced tiller bud outgrowth. Taken together, these results indicate that TIS13 inhibits strigolactone biosynthesis in rice seedlings. We propose that TIS13 is a new lead compound for the development of specific strigolactone biosynthesis inhibitors.
Plant Cell Physiol-2009-Arite-1416-24.pdf	d14, a strigolactone-insensitive mutant of rice, shows an accelerated outgrowth of tillers	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Ishikawa Prefectural University, Nonoichi, Ishikawa 921-8836, Japan.	Recent studies using highly branched mutants of pea, Arabidopsis and rice have demonstrated that strigolactones, a group of terpenoid lactones, act as a new hormone class, or its biosynthetic precursors, in inhibiting shoot branching. Here, we provide evidence that DWARF14 (D14) inhibits rice tillering and may act as a new compo-nent of the strigolactone-dependent branching inhibition pathway. The d14 mutant exhibits increased shoot branch-ing with reduced plant height like the previously characterized strigolactone-deficient and -insensitive mutants d10 and d3, respectively. The d10-1 d14-1 double mutant is phenotypically indistinguishable from the d10-1 and d14-1 single mutants, consistent with the idea that D10 and D14 function in the same pathway. However, unlike with d10, the d14 branching phenotype could not be rescued by exogenous strigolactones. In addition, the d14 mutant contained a higher level of 2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol than the wild type. Positional cloning revealed that D14 encodes a protein of the alpha/beta-fold hydrolase superfamily, some members of which play a role in metabolism or signaling of plant hormones. We propose that D14 functions downstream of strigolactone synthesis, as a component of hormone signaling or as an enzyme that participates in the conversion of strigolactones to the bioactive form.
PEER_stage2_10.1042%2FBJ20080568.pdf	Carotenoid oxygenases involved in plant branching catalyse a highly specific conserved apocarotenoid cleavage reaction	2008	Biochem J	Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg, Faculty of Biology, Institute of Biology II, Schaenzlestrasse 1, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.	Recent studies with the high-tillering mutants in rice (Oryza sativa), the max (more axillary growth) mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana and the rms (ramosus) mutants in pea (Pisum sativum) have indicated the presence of a novel plant hormone that inhibits branching in an auxin-dependent manner. The synthesis of this inhibitor is initiated by the two CCDs [carotenoid-cleaving (di)oxygenases] OsCCD7/OsCCD8b, MAX3/MAX4 and RMS5/RMS1 in rice, Arabidopsis and pea respectively. MAX3 and MAX4 are thought to catalyse the successive cleavage of a carotenoid substrate yielding an apocarotenoid that, possibly after further modification, inhibits the outgrowth of axillary buds. To elucidate the substrate specificity of OsCCD8b, MAX4 and RMS1, we investigated their activities in vitro using naturally accumulated carotenoids and synthetic apocarotenoid substrates, and in vivo using carotenoid-accumulating Escherichia coli strains. The results obtained suggest that these enzymes are highly specific, converting the C27 compounds beta-apo-10'-carotenal and its alcohol into beta-apo-13-carotenone in vitro. Our data suggest that the second cleavage step in the biosynthesis of the plant branching inhibitor is conserved in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species.
