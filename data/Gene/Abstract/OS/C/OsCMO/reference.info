Glycine betaine (GB) is a compatible quaternary amine that enables plants to tolerate abiotic stresses, including salt, drought and cold. In plants, GB is synthesized through two-step of successive oxidations from choline, catalyzed by choline monooxygenase (CMO) and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH), respectively. Rice is considered as a typical non-GB accumulating species, although the entire genome sequencing revealed rice contains orthologs of both CMO and BADH. Several studies unraveled that rice has a functional BADH gene, but whether rice CMO gene (OsCMO) is functional or a pseudogene remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we report the functional characterization of rice CMO gene. The OsCMO gene was isolated from rice cv. Nipponbare (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) using RT-PCR. Northern blot demonstrated the transcription of OsCMO is enhanced by salt stress. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsCMO results in increased GB content and elevated tolerance to salt stress. Immunoblotting analysis demonstrates that a functional OsCMO protein with correct size was present in transgenic tobacco but rarely accumulated in wild-type rice plants. Surprisingly, a large amount of truncated proteins derived from OsCMO was induced in the rice seedlings in response to salt stresses. This suggests that it is the lack of a functional OsCMO protein that presumably results in non-GB accumulation in the tested rice plant. KEY MESSAGE: Expression and transgenic studies demonstrate OsCMO is transcriptionally induced in response to salt stress and functions in increasing glycinebetaine accumulation and enhancing tolerance to salt stress. Immunoblotting analysis suggests that no accumulation of glycinebetaine in the Japonica rice plant presumably results from lack of a functional OsCMO protein.
NA	The Accumulation of Glycine Betaine Is Dependent on Choline Monooxygenase (OsCMO), Not on Phosphoethanolamine N-Methyltransferase (OsPEAMT1), in Rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica)	2014	Plant Molecular Biology Reporter	Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Bio-Resource and Eco-Environment, College of Life Science and State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River EngineeringSichuan UniversityChengduChina	Glycine betaine (GB) is an important osmoprotectant, which improves plant tolerance to various abiotic stresses. In higher plants, GB is synthesized through two-step oxidations of choline, catalyzed by choline monooxygenase (CMO) and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH), respectively. Choline, the precursor of GB, is synthesized by phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEAMT). Rice is known as a typical non-GB-accumulated species. However, the underlying mechanism related to GB accumulation remains elusive. Here, we determined whether the endogenous accumulation of choline is sufficient to GB biosynthesis in rice and whether the rice CMO protein has the function of oxidizing choline to generate betaine aldehyde. The results showed that overexpression of the rice PEAMT1 gene (OsPEAMT1) resulted in increased levels of choline, while GB content remained unchanged in the transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsPEAMT1. However, the intracellular GB level and the tolerance to salt stress of the transgenic lines overexpressing OsCMO were significantly enhanced. Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that abundant functional OsCMO proteins with correct size were detected in OsCMO-overexpressing transgenic rice plants, but rarely accumulated in the wild type. Collectively, these results implicated that the endogenous accumulation level of choline is not the major factor leading to non-GB accumulation in rice. Instead, the defective expression of OsCMO resulted in non-GB accumulation.
