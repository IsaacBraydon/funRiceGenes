Symbol	Keyword	Title	Evidence
OsCOIN	temperature	Overexpression of OsCOIN, a putative cold inducible zinc finger protein, increased tolerance to chilling, salt and drought, and enhanced proline level in rice	 OsCOIN is expressed in all rice organs and strongly induced by low temperature, ABA, salt and drought
OsCOIN	drought	Overexpression of OsCOIN, a putative cold inducible zinc finger protein, increased tolerance to chilling, salt and drought, and enhanced proline level in rice	 OsCOIN is expressed in all rice organs and strongly induced by low temperature, ABA, salt and drought
OsCOIN	drought	Overexpression of OsCOIN, a putative cold inducible zinc finger protein, increased tolerance to chilling, salt and drought, and enhanced proline level in rice	Over-expression of OsCOIN in transgenic rice lines significantly enhanced their tolerance to cold, salt and drought, accompanied by an up-regulation of OsP5CS expression and an increase of cellular proline level
