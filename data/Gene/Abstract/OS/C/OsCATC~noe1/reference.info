23.pdf	ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Biology, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China.	The production of both ABA and H(2)O(2) is induced by drought and can act as signals under stress conditions. We investigated the relationships between ABA, H(2)O(2) and catalase (CAT) in rice leaves when rice seedlings were treated with polyethylene glycol as water stress treatment. As a key gene in ABA biosynthesis, OsNCED3 was significantly induced in rice by water stress treatment and such induction preceded the rapid increase in ABA. Water stress inhibited the expression of CATA and CATC but substantially enhanced the expression of CATB. Exogenously applied ABA promoted the expression of CATB also and inhibited the expression of CATC in a concentration-dependent manner. When ABA production was inhibited by using ABA biosynthesis inhibitors nordihydroguaiaretic acid and tungstate, expression of CATB was also subdued while CATC was enhanced under the water stress. Accumulation of H(2)O(2) was also reduced when endogenous ABA production was inhibited and showed a correlation with the total activity of catalases. Our results suggest that water stress-induced ABA prevents the excessive accumulation of H(2)O(2), through the induction of the expression of CATB gene during water stress.
451.pdf	Nitric oxide and protein S-nitrosylation are integral to hydrogen peroxide-induced leaf cell death in rice	2012	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Nitric oxide (NO) is a key redox-active, small molecule involved in various aspects of plant growth and development. Here, we report the identification of an NO accumulation mutant, nitric oxide excess1 (noe1), in rice (Oryza sativa), the isolation of the corresponding gene, and the analysis of its role in NO-mediated leaf cell death. Map-based cloning revealed that NOE1 encoded a rice catalase, OsCATC. Furthermore, noe1 resulted in an increase of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in the leaves, which consequently promoted NO production via the activation of nitrate reductase. The removal of excess NO reduced cell death in both leaves and suspension cultures derived from noe1 plants, implicating NO as an important endogenous mediator of H(2)O(2)-induced leaf cell death. Reduction of intracellular S-nitrosothiol (SNO) levels, generated by overexpression of rice S-nitrosoglutathione reductase gene (GSNOR1), which regulates global levels of protein S-nitrosylation, alleviated leaf cell death in noe1 plants. Thus, S-nitrosylation was also involved in light-dependent leaf cell death in noe1. Utilizing the biotin-switch assay, nanoliquid chromatography, and tandem mass spectrometry, S-nitrosylated proteins were identified in both wild-type and noe1 plants. NO targets identified only in noe1 plants included glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and thioredoxin, which have been reported to be involved in S-nitrosylation-regulated cell death in animals. Collectively, our data suggest that both NO and SNOs are important mediators in the process of H(2)O(2)-induced leaf cell death in rice.
NA	Disruption of LLM9428/OsCATC Represses Starch Metabolism and Confers Enhanced Blast Resistance in Rice.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.	Catalases (CATs) are important self-originating enzymes and are involved in many of the biological functions of plants. Multiple forms of CATs suggest their versatile role in lesion mimic mutants (LMMs), H(2)O(2) homeostasis and abiotic and biotic stress tolerance. In the current study, we identified a large lesion mimic mutant9428 (llm9428) from Ethyl-methane-sulfonate (EMS) mutagenized population. The llm9428 showed a typical phenotype of LMMs including decreased agronomic yield traits. The histochemical assays showed decreased cell viability and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the leaves of llm9428 compared to its wild type (WT). The llm9428 showed enhanced blast disease resistance and increased relative expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. Studies of the sub-cellular structure of the leaf and quantification of starch contents revealed a significant decrease in starch granule formation in llm9428. Genetic analysis revealed a single nucleotide change (C &amp;gt; T) that altered an amino acid (Ala &amp;gt; Val) in the candidate gene (Os03g0131200) encoding a CATALASE C in llm9428. CRISPR-Cas9 targetted knockout lines of LLM9428/OsCATC showed the phenotype of LMMs and reduced starch metabolism. Taken together, the current study results revealed a novel role of OsCATC in starch metabolism in addition to validating previously studied functions of CATs.

NA	ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 promotes hydrogen peroxide scavenging to enhance rice thermotolerance.	2023	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Biocatalysis and Enzyme Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Hubei University, Wuhan 430062, China.	Heat stress is a major factor limiting the production and geographic distribution of rice (Oryza sativa), and breeding rice varieties with tolerance to heat stress is of immense importance. Although extensive studies have revealed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a critical role in rice acclimation to heat stress, the molecular basis of rice controlling ROS homeostasis remains largely unclear. In this study, we discovered a novel heat stress-responsive strategy that orchestrates ROS homeostasis centering on an immune activator, rice ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (OsEDS1). OsEDS1, which confers heat stress tolerance, promotes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenging by stimulating catalase activity through the OsEDS1-catalase association. The loss-of-function mutation in OsEDS1 causes increased sensitivity to heat stress, whereas overexpression of OsEDS1 enhances thermotolerance. Furthermore, overexpression lines greatly improved rice tolerance to heat stress during the reproductive stage, which was associated with substantially increased seed setting, grain weight, and plant yield. Rice CATALASE C (OsCATC), whose activity is promoted by OsEDS1, degrades H2O2 to activate rice heat stress tolerance. Our findings greatly expand our understanding of heat stress responses in rice. We reveal a molecular framework that promotes heat tolerance through ROS homeostasis regulation, suggesting a theoretical basis and providing genetic resources for breeding heat-tolerant rice varieties.
NA	Analysis of CAT Gene Family and Functional Identification of OsCAT3 in Rice.	2023	Genes (Basel)	College of Agriculture, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang 330045, China.	Catalase (CAT) is an important antioxidant enzyme in plants that plays a key role in plant growth and stress responses. CAT is usually encoded by a small gene family that has been cloned and functionally studied in some species, such as Arabidopsis, wheat and cucumber, but its specific roles in rice are not clear at present. In this study, we identified three CAT family genes (OsCAT1, OsCAT2 and OsCAT3) in the rice genome and performed a systematic bioinformatics analysis. RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsCAT1-OsCAT3 was primarily expressed in vegetative tissues such as roots, stems and leaves. Since OsCAT3 showed the highest expression level among the three OsCAT genes, we then focused on its related functions. OsCAT3 prokaryotic expression protein has an obvious ability to remove H(2)O(2). The OsCAT3(crispr) plant was short and had a low survival rate, the leaves were small with brown lesions, and the activities of the CAT, POD and SOD enzymes were significantly reduced. A microarray analysis showed that differentially expressed genes were primarily enriched in toxin metabolism and photosynthesis. This study laid a foundation for further understanding the function of the rice OsCAT gene.
NA	The Protein Phosphatase PC1 Dephosphorylates and Deactivates CatC to Negatively Regulate H2O2 Homeostasis and Salt Tolerance in Rice.	2023	Plant Cell	Hunan Province Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Developmental Regulation, State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, National Center of Technology Innovation for Saline-Alkali Tolerant Rice, College of Biology, Hunan University; Â Changsha, 410082, China.	Catalase (CAT) is often phosphorylated and activated by protein kinases to maintain hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) homeostasis and protect cells against stresses, but whether and how CAT is switched off by protein phosphatases remains inconclusive. Here, we identified a manganese (Mn2+)-dependent protein phosphatase, which we named PHOSPHATASE OF CATALASE 1 (PC1), from rice (Oryza sativa L.) that negatively regulates salt and oxidative stress tolerance. PC1 specifically dephosphorylates CatC at Ser-9 to inhibit its tetramerization and thus activity in the peroxisome. PC1 overexpressing lines exhibited hypersensitivity to salt and oxidative stresses with a lower phospho-serine level of CATs. Phosphatase activity and seminal root growth assays indicated that PC1 promotes growth and plays a vital role during the transition from salt stress to normal growth conditions. Our findings demonstrate that PC1 acts as a molecular switch to dephosphorylate and deactivate CatC and negatively regulate H2O2 homeostasis and salt tolerance in rice. Moreover, knockout of PC1 not only improved H2O2-scavenging capacity and salt tolerance, but also limited rice grain yield loss under salt stress conditions. Together, these results shed light on the mechanisms that switch off CAT and provide a strategy for breeding highly salt-tolerant rice.
