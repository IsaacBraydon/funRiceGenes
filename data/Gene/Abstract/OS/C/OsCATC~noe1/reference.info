23.pdf	ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Biology, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China.	The production of both ABA and H(2)O(2) is induced by drought and can act as signals under stress conditions. We investigated the relationships between ABA, H(2)O(2) and catalase (CAT) in rice leaves when rice seedlings were treated with polyethylene glycol as water stress treatment. As a key gene in ABA biosynthesis, OsNCED3 was significantly induced in rice by water stress treatment and such induction preceded the rapid increase in ABA. Water stress inhibited the expression of CATA and CATC but substantially enhanced the expression of CATB. Exogenously applied ABA promoted the expression of CATB also and inhibited the expression of CATC in a concentration-dependent manner. When ABA production was inhibited by using ABA biosynthesis inhibitors nordihydroguaiaretic acid and tungstate, expression of CATB was also subdued while CATC was enhanced under the water stress. Accumulation of H(2)O(2) was also reduced when endogenous ABA production was inhibited and showed a correlation with the total activity of catalases. Our results suggest that water stress-induced ABA prevents the excessive accumulation of H(2)O(2), through the induction of the expression of CATB gene during water stress.
451.pdf	Nitric oxide and protein S-nitrosylation are integral to hydrogen peroxide-induced leaf cell death in rice	2012	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Nitric oxide (NO) is a key redox-active, small molecule involved in various aspects of plant growth and development. Here, we report the identification of an NO accumulation mutant, nitric oxide excess1 (noe1), in rice (Oryza sativa), the isolation of the corresponding gene, and the analysis of its role in NO-mediated leaf cell death. Map-based cloning revealed that NOE1 encoded a rice catalase, OsCATC. Furthermore, noe1 resulted in an increase of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in the leaves, which consequently promoted NO production via the activation of nitrate reductase. The removal of excess NO reduced cell death in both leaves and suspension cultures derived from noe1 plants, implicating NO as an important endogenous mediator of H(2)O(2)-induced leaf cell death. Reduction of intracellular S-nitrosothiol (SNO) levels, generated by overexpression of rice S-nitrosoglutathione reductase gene (GSNOR1), which regulates global levels of protein S-nitrosylation, alleviated leaf cell death in noe1 plants. Thus, S-nitrosylation was also involved in light-dependent leaf cell death in noe1. Utilizing the biotin-switch assay, nanoliquid chromatography, and tandem mass spectrometry, S-nitrosylated proteins were identified in both wild-type and noe1 plants. NO targets identified only in noe1 plants included glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and thioredoxin, which have been reported to be involved in S-nitrosylation-regulated cell death in animals. Collectively, our data suggest that both NO and SNOs are important mediators in the process of H(2)O(2)-induced leaf cell death in rice.
NA	Disruption of LLM9428/OsCATC Represses Starch Metabolism and Confers Enhanced Blast Resistance in Rice.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.	Catalases (CATs) are important self-originating enzymes and are involved in many of the biological functions of plants. Multiple forms of CATs suggest their versatile role in lesion mimic mutants (LMMs), H(2)O(2) homeostasis and abiotic and biotic stress tolerance. In the current study, we identified a large lesion mimic mutant9428 (llm9428) from Ethyl-methane-sulfonate (EMS) mutagenized population. The llm9428 showed a typical phenotype of LMMs including decreased agronomic yield traits. The histochemical assays showed decreased cell viability and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the leaves of llm9428 compared to its wild type (WT). The llm9428 showed enhanced blast disease resistance and increased relative expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. Studies of the sub-cellular structure of the leaf and quantification of starch contents revealed a significant decrease in starch granule formation in llm9428. Genetic analysis revealed a single nucleotide change (C &amp;gt; T) that altered an amino acid (Ala &amp;gt; Val) in the candidate gene (Os03g0131200) encoding a CATALASE C in llm9428. CRISPR-Cas9 targetted knockout lines of LLM9428/OsCATC showed the phenotype of LMMs and reduced starch metabolism. Taken together, the current study results revealed a novel role of OsCATC in starch metabolism in addition to validating previously studied functions of CATs.
