OsCATC|noe1	nitrate	Nitric oxide and protein S-nitrosylation are integral to hydrogen peroxide-induced leaf cell death in rice	Furthermore, noe1 resulted in an increase of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in the leaves, which consequently promoted NO production via the activation of nitrate reductase
OsCATC|noe1	cell death	Nitric oxide and protein S-nitrosylation are integral to hydrogen peroxide-induced leaf cell death in rice	Here, we report the identification of an NO accumulation mutant, nitric oxide excess1 (noe1), in rice (Oryza sativa), the isolation of the corresponding gene, and the analysis of its role in NO-mediated leaf cell death
OsCATC|noe1	cell death	Nitric oxide and protein S-nitrosylation are integral to hydrogen peroxide-induced leaf cell death in rice	The removal of excess NO reduced cell death in both leaves and suspension cultures derived from noe1 plants, implicating NO as an important endogenous mediator of H(2)O(2)-induced leaf cell death
OsCATC|noe1	cell death	Nitric oxide and protein S-nitrosylation are integral to hydrogen peroxide-induced leaf cell death in rice	Reduction of intracellular S-nitrosothiol (SNO) levels, generated by overexpression of rice S-nitrosoglutathione reductase gene (GSNOR1), which regulates global levels of protein S-nitrosylation, alleviated leaf cell death in noe1 plants
OsCATC|noe1	cell death	Nitric oxide and protein S-nitrosylation are integral to hydrogen peroxide-induced leaf cell death in rice	Thus, S-nitrosylation was also involved in light-dependent leaf cell death in noe1
OsCATC|noe1	cell death	Nitric oxide and protein S-nitrosylation are integral to hydrogen peroxide-induced leaf cell death in rice	NO targets identified only in noe1 plants included glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and thioredoxin, which have been reported to be involved in S-nitrosylation-regulated cell death in animals
OsCATC|noe1	leaf	Nitric oxide and protein S-nitrosylation are integral to hydrogen peroxide-induced leaf cell death in rice	Here, we report the identification of an NO accumulation mutant, nitric oxide excess1 (noe1), in rice (Oryza sativa), the isolation of the corresponding gene, and the analysis of its role in NO-mediated leaf cell death

OsCATC|noe1	starch	Disruption of LLM9428/OsCATC Represses Starch Metabolism and Confers Enhanced Blast Resistance in Rice.	 Taken together, the current study results revealed a novel role of OsCATC in starch metabolism in addition to validating previously studied functions of CATs
OsCATC|noe1	immunity	Rice catalase OsCATC is degraded by E3 ligase APIP6 to negatively regulate immunity	Rice catalase OsCATC is degraded by E3 ligase APIP6 to negatively regulate immunity
