OsCATB	OsCATC|noe1	ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress	 Water stress inhibited the expression of CATA and CATC but substantially enhanced the expression of CATB| Exogenously applied ABA promoted the expression of CATB also and inhibited the expression of CATC in a concentration-dependent manner| When ABA production was inhibited by using ABA biosynthesis inhibitors nordihydroguaiaretic acid and tungstate, expression of CATB was also subdued while CATC was enhanced under the water stress
