OsCATB	OsCATC|NOE1|OsCAT3	ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress	Water stress inhibited the expression of CATA and CATC but substantially enhanced the expression of CATB
OsCATB	OsCATC|NOE1|OsCAT3	ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress	Exogenously applied ABA promoted the expression of CATB also and inhibited the expression of CATC in a concentration-dependent manner
OsCATB	OsCATC|NOE1|OsCAT3	ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress	When ABA production was inhibited by using ABA biosynthesis inhibitors nordihydroguaiaretic acid and tungstate, expression of CATB was also subdued while CATC was enhanced under the water stress
OsCATA	OsCATC|NOE1|OsCAT3	ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress	Water stress inhibited the expression of CATA and CATC but substantially enhanced the expression of CATB
APIP6	OsCATC|NOE1|OsCAT3	Rice catalase OsCATC is degraded by E3 ligase APIP6 to negatively regulate immunity	Rice catalase OsCATC is degraded by E3 ligase APIP6 to negatively regulate immunity
OsCATC|NOE1|OsCAT3	RHS1	A Novel RHS1 Locus in Rice Attributes Seed-Pod Shattering by the Regulation of Endogenous S-Nitrosothiols.	 Interestingly noe1, a rice mutant with high SNO levels, exhibited low seed shattering, whereas rhs1 resulted in low SNO levels with high seed shattering
OsCATC|NOE1|OsCAT3	OsEDS1	ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 promotes hydrogen peroxide scavenging to enhance rice thermotolerance.	 Rice CATALASE C (OsCATC), whose activity is promoted by OsEDS1, degrades H2O2 to activate rice heat stress tolerance
OsCATC|NOE1|OsCAT3	WFSL1|STRIPE3|WSL214	WSL214 negatively regulates ROS accumulation and pathogen defense response in rice.	 First, WSL214 increased the expression of the catalase gene OsCATC, making the intracellular ROS scavenging enzyme more active
