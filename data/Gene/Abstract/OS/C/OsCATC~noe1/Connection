OsCATB	OsCATC|noe1	ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress	Water stress inhibited the expression of CATA and CATC but substantially enhanced the expression of CATB
OsCATB	OsCATC|noe1	ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress	Exogenously applied ABA promoted the expression of CATB also and inhibited the expression of CATC in a concentration-dependent manner
OsCATB	OsCATC|noe1	ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress	When ABA production was inhibited by using ABA biosynthesis inhibitors nordihydroguaiaretic acid and tungstate, expression of CATB was also subdued while CATC was enhanced under the water stress
OsCATA	OsCATC|noe1	ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress	Water stress inhibited the expression of CATA and CATC but substantially enhanced the expression of CATB
APIP6	OsCATC|noe1	Rice catalase OsCATC is degraded by E3 ligase APIP6 to negatively regulate immunity	Rice catalase OsCATC is degraded by E3 ligase APIP6 to negatively regulate immunity
