OsCSL1	seedlings	Chlorosis seedling lethality 1 encoding a MAP3K protein is essential for chloroplast development in rice.	 CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study revealed that OsCSL1 played roles in regulating the expression of multiple chloroplast synthesis-related genes, thereby affecting their functions, and leading to wide-ranging defects, including chlorotic seedlings and severely disrupted chloroplasts containing accumulated starch granules
OsCSL1	chloroplast	Chlorosis seedling lethality 1 encoding a MAP3K protein is essential for chloroplast development in rice.	 Additionally, disruption of OsCSL1 led to reduced expression of chloroplast-associated genes, including chlorophyll biosynthetic genes, plastid-encoded RNA polymerases, nuclear-encoded RNA polymerase, and nuclear-encoded chloroplast genes

OsCSL1	Kinase	Chlorosis seedling lethality 1 encoding a MAP3K protein is essential for chloroplast development in rice.	 Molecular cloning revealed that OsCSL1 encoded a MAPK kinase kinase22 (MKKK22) targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and functional complementation of OsCSL1 was found to restore the normal phenotype in csl1 plants
