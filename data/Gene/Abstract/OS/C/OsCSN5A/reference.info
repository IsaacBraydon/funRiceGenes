NA	Rice black-streaked dwarf virus-encoded P5-1 regulates the ubiquitination activity of SCF E3 ligases and inhibits jasmonate signaling to benefit its infection in rice.	2019	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Quality and Safety of Agro-products, Institute of Plant Virology, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315000, China.	SCF (Skp1/Cullin1/F-box) complexes are key regulators of many cellular processes. Viruses encode specific factors to interfere with or hijack these complexes and ensure their infection in plants. The molecular mechanisms controlling this interference/hijack are currently largely unknown. Here, we present evidence of a novel strategy used by Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) to regulate ubiquitination in rice (Oryza sativa) by interfering in the activity of OsCSN5A. We also show that RBSDV P5-1 specifically affects CSN-mediated deRUBylation of OsCUL1, compromising the integrity of the SCF(COI1) complex. We demonstrate that the expressions of jasmonate (JA) biosynthesis-associated genes are not inhibited, whereas the expressions of JA-responsive genes are down-regulated in transgenic P5-1 plants. More importantly, application of JA to P5-1 transgenic plants did not reduce their susceptibility to RBSDV infection. Our results suggest that P5-1 inhibits the ubiquitination activity of SCF E3 ligases through an interaction with OsCSN5A, and hinders the RUBylation/deRUBylation of CUL1, leading to an inhibition of the JA response pathway and an enhancement of RBSDV infection in rice.
