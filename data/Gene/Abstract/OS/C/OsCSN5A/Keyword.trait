OsCSN5A	dwarf	Rice black-streaked dwarf virus-encoded P5-1 regulates the ubiquitination activity of SCF E3 ligases and inhibits jasmonate signaling to benefit its infection in rice.	 Here, we present evidence of a novel strategy used by Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) to regulate ubiquitination in rice (Oryza sativa) by interfering in the activity of OsCSN5A
