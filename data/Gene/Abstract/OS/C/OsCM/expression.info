OsCM	Overexpression of OsCM alleviates BLB stress via phytohormonal accumulation and transcriptional modulation of defense-related genes in Oryza sativa |  We reported that overexpression of OsCM altered the downstream pathway of aromatic amino acids, mitigating pathogen stress by altering stress-responsive genes and hormonal accumulation |  Further analysis revealed that OsCM expression induced phenylalanine accumulation and suppressed tyrosine accumulation in response to bacterial leaf blight stress |  Furthermore, bacterial leaf blight stress induced genes downstream of the phenylpropanoid pathway in conjunction with OsCM, suggesting that the phenylpropanoid pathway is dependent on OsCM gene expression	Overexpression of OsCM alleviates BLB stress via phytohormonal accumulation and transcriptional modulation of defense-related genes in Oryza sativa |  We reported that overexpression of OsCM altered the downstream pathway of aromatic amino acids, mitigating pathogen stress by altering stress-responsive genes and hormonal accumulation
