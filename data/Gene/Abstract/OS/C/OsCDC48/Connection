OsCDC48	OsDER1	OsDER1 is an ER-associated protein degradation factor that responds to ER stress.	 Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that OsDER1 interacted with OsHRD1, OsHRD3, and OsCDC48, the essential components of the canonical ERAD pathway
G1	OsCDC48	OsCDC48/48E complex is required for plant survival in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Removal of the C-terminus of OsCDC48 caused altered expression of cell cycle-related genes, changed the percentage of cells in G1 and G2/M phases, and abolished the interaction between OsCDC48 itself and between OsCDC48 and OsCDC48E, respectively
