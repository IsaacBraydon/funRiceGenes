NA	Single base substitution in OsCDC48 is responsible for premature senescence and death phenotype in rice.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China.	A premature senescence and death 128 (psd128) mutant was isolated from an EMS-induced rice IR64 mutant bank. The premature senescence phenotype appeared at the six-leaf stage and the plant died at the early heading stage. psd128 exhibited impaired chloroplast development with significantly reduced photosynthetic ability, chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, root vigor, soluble protein content and increased malonaldehyde content. Furthermore, the expression of senescence-related genes was significantly altered in psd128. The mutant trait was controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene. Using map-based strategy, the mutation Oryza sativa cell division cycle 48 (OsCDC48) was isolated and predicted to encode a putative AAA-type ATPase with 809 amino-acid residuals. A single base substitution at position C2347T in psd128 resulted in a premature stop codon. Functional complementation could rescue the mutant phenotype. In addition, RNA interference resulted in the premature senescence and death phenotype. OsCDC48 was expressed constitutively in the root, stem, leaf and panicle. Subcellular analysis indicated that OsCDC48:YFP fusion proteins were located both in the cytoplasm and nucleus. OsCDC48 was highly conserved with more than 90% identity in the protein levels among plant species. Our results indicated that the impaired function of OsCDC48 was responsible for the premature senescence and death phenotype.
NA	OsCDC48/48E complex is required for plant survival in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2019	Plant Mol Biol	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, 359 Tiyuchang Road, Hangzhou, 310006, China.	We demonstrate that the C-terminus of OsCDC48 is essential for maintaining its full ATPase activity and OsCDC48/48E interaction is required to modulate cellular processes and plant survival in rice. Cell division cycle 48 (CDC48) belongs to the superfamily protein of ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA). We previously isolated a rice CDC48 mutant (psd128) displaying premature senescence and death phenotype. Here, we showed that OsCDC48 (Os03g0151800) interacted with OsCDC48E (Os10g0442600), a homologue of OsCDC48, to control plant survival in rice. OsCDC48E knockout plants exhibited similar behavior to psd128 with premature senescence and plant death. Removal of the C-terminus of OsCDC48 caused altered expression of cell cycle-related genes, changed the percentage of cells in G1 and G2/M phases, and abolished the interaction between OsCDC48 itself and between OsCDC48 and OsCDC48E, respectively. Furthermore, the truncated OsCDC48-PSD128 protein lacking the C-terminal 27 amino acid residues showed a decreased level of ATPase activity. Overexpression of OsCDC48-psd128 resulted in differential expression of AAA-ATPase associated genes leading to increased total ATPase activity, accumulation of reactive oxygen species and decreased plant tiller numbers while overexpression of OsCDC48 also resulted in differential expression of AAA-ATPase associated genes leading to increased total ATPase activity, but increased plant tiller numbers and grain yield, indicating its potential utilization for yield improvement. Our results demonstrated that the C-terminal region of OsCDC48 was essential for maintaining the full ATPase activity and OsCDC48/48E complex might function in form of heteromultimers to modulate cellular processes and plant survival in rice.
