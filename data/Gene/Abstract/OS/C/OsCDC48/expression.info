OsCDC48	 Removal of the C-terminus of OsCDC48 caused altered expression of cell cycle-related genes, changed the percentage of cells in G1 and G2/M phases, and abolished the interaction between OsCDC48 itself and between OsCDC48 and OsCDC48E, respectively |  Overexpression of OsCDC48-psd128 resulted in differential expression of AAA-ATPase associated genes leading to increased total ATPase activity, accumulation of reactive oxygen species and decreased plant tiller numbers while overexpression of OsCDC48 also resulted in differential expression of AAA-ATPase associated genes leading to increased total ATPase activity, but increased plant tiller numbers and grain yield, indicating its potential utilization for yield improvement	 Overexpression of OsCDC48-psd128 resulted in differential expression of AAA-ATPase associated genes leading to increased total ATPase activity, accumulation of reactive oxygen species and decreased plant tiller numbers while overexpression of OsCDC48 also resulted in differential expression of AAA-ATPase associated genes leading to increased total ATPase activity, but increased plant tiller numbers and grain yield, indicating its potential utilization for yield improvement
