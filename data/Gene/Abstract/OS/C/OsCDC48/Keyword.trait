OsCDC48	leaf	Single base substitution in OsCDC48 is responsible for premature senescence and death phenotype in rice.	OsCDC48 was expressed constitutively in the root, stem, leaf and panicle
OsCDC48	panicle	Single base substitution in OsCDC48 is responsible for premature senescence and death phenotype in rice.	OsCDC48 was expressed constitutively in the root, stem, leaf and panicle
OsCDC48	senescence	Single base substitution in OsCDC48 is responsible for premature senescence and death phenotype in rice.	Single base substitution in OsCDC48 is responsible for premature senescence and death phenotype in rice.
OsCDC48	senescence	Single base substitution in OsCDC48 is responsible for premature senescence and death phenotype in rice.	Our results indicated that the impaired function of OsCDC48 was responsible for the premature senescence and death phenotype
