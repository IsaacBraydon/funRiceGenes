OsCesA7	The expression of a rice secondary wall-specific cellulose synthase gene, OsCesA7, is directly regulated by a rice transcription factor, OsMYB58/63. | A rice MYB transcription factor, OsMYB58/63, was found to directly upregulate the expression of a rice secondary wall-specific cellulose synthase gene, cellulose synthase A7 ( OsCesA7 ); in contrast, the Arabidopsis putative orthologs AtMYB58 and AtMYB63 have been shown to specifically activate lignin biosynthesis |  This study showed that a rice MYB transcription factor, OsMYB58/63, directly upregulated the expression of a rice secondary wall-specific cellulose synthase gene, cellulose synthase A7 (OsCesA7) |  OsMYB58/63 most strongly transactivated the expression of OsCesA7 in rice protoplasts
