1330073.pdf	Three Distinct Rice Cellulose Synthase Catalytic Subunit Genes Required for Cellulose Synthesis in the Secondary Wall	2003	Plant Physiol	Institute of the Society for Techno-innovation of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0854, Japan.	Several brittle culm mutations of rice (Oryza sativa) causing fragility of plant tissues have been identified genetically but not characterized at a molecular level. We show here that the genes responsible for three distinct brittle mutations of rice, induced by the insertion of the endogenous retrotransposon Tos17, correspond to CesA (cellulose synthase catalytic subunit) genes, OsCesA4, OsCesA7 and OsCesA9. Three CesA genes were expressed in seedlings, culms, premature panicles, and roots but not in mature leaves, and the expression profiles were almost identical among the three genes. Cellulose contents were dramatically decreased (8.9%-25.5% of the wild-type level) in the culms of null mutants of the three genes, indicating that these genes are not functionally redundant. Consistent with these results, cell walls in the cortical fiber cells were shown to be thinner in all the mutants than in wild-type plants. Based on these observations, the structure of a cellulose-synthesizing complex involved in the synthesis of the secondary cell wall is discussed.
NA	The expression of a rice secondary wall-specific cellulose synthase gene, OsCesA7, is directly regulated by a rice transcription factor, OsMYB58/63.	2015	Planta	Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere, Kyoto University, Uji, Kyoto, 611-0011, Japan.	A rice MYB transcription factor, OsMYB58/63, was found to directly upregulate the expression of a rice secondary wall-specific cellulose synthase gene, cellulose synthase A7 ( OsCesA7 ); in contrast, the Arabidopsis putative orthologs AtMYB58 and AtMYB63 have been shown to specifically activate lignin biosynthesis. Although indirect evidence has shown that grass plants are similar to but partially different from dicotyledonous ones in transcriptional regulation of lignocellulose biosynthesis, little is known about the differences. This study showed that a rice MYB transcription factor, OsMYB58/63, directly upregulated the expression of a rice secondary wall-specific cellulose synthase gene, cellulose synthase A7 (OsCesA7). Gene co-expression analysis showed that, in rice, OsMYB58/63 and several rice MYB genes were co-expressed with genes encoding lignocellulose biosynthetic enzymes. The expression levels of OsMYB55/61, OsMYB55/61-L, OsMYB58/63, and OsMYB42/85 were commonly found to be high in culm internodes and nodes. All four MYB transcription factors functioned as transcriptional activators in yeast cells. OsMYB58/63 most strongly transactivated the expression of OsCesA7 in rice protoplasts. Moreover, recombinant OsMYB58/63 protein was bound to two distinct cis-regulatory elements, AC-II and SMRE3, in the OsCesA7 promoter. This is in sharp contrast to the role of Arabidopsis orthologs, AtMYB58 and AtMYB63, which had been reported to specifically activate lignin biosynthesis. The promoter analysis revealed that AC elements, which are the binding sites for MYB58 and MYB63, were lacking in cellulose and xylan biosynthetic genes in Arabidopsis, but present in cellulose, xylan, and lignin biosynthetic genes in rice, implying that the difference of transcriptional regulation between rice and Arabidopsis is due to the distinct composition of promoters. Our results provide a new insight into transcriptional regulation in grass lignocellulose biosynthesis.
NA	A Missense Mutation in the Zinc Finger Domain of OsCESA7 Deleteriously Affects Cellulose Biosynthesis and Plant Growth in Rice.	2016	PLoS One	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Rice is a model plant species for the study of cellulose biosynthesis. We isolated a mutant, S1-24, from ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-treated plants of the japonica rice cultivar, Nipponbare. The mutant exhibited brittle culms and other pleiotropic phenotypes such as dwarfism and partial sterility. The brittle culms resulted from reduced mechanical strength due to a defect in thickening of the sclerenchyma cell wall and reduced cellulose content in the culms of the S1-24 mutant. Map-based gene cloning and a complementation assay showed that phenotypes of the S1-24 mutant were caused by a recessive point mutation in the OsCESA7 gene, which encodes cellulose synthase A subunit 7. The missense mutation changed the highly conserved C40 to Y in the zinc finger domain. The OsCESA7 gene is expressed predominantly in the culm at the mature stage, particularly in mechanical tissues such as vascular bundles and sclerenchyma cells, consistent with the brittle phenotype in the culm. These results indicate that OsCESA7 plays an important role in cellulose biosynthesis and plant growth.
NA	Two Complementary Mechanisms Underpin Cell Wall Patterning during Xylem Vessel Development.	2017	Plant Cell	School of Biosciences, University of Melbourne CITY: Parkville Australia [AU].	The evolution of the plant vasculature was essential for the emergence of terrestrial life. Xylem vessels are solute-transporting elements in the vasculature that possess secondary wall thickenings deposited in intricate patterns. Evenly dispersed microtubule (MT) bands support the formation of these wall thickenings, but how the MTs direct cell wall synthesis during this process remains largely unknown. Cellulose is the major secondary wall constituent and is synthesized by plasma membrane-localized cellulose synthases (CesAs) whose catalytic activity propels them through the membrane. We show that the protein CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTING (CSI)1/POM2 is necessary to align the secondary wall CesAs and MTs during the initial phase of xylem vessel development in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice). Surprisingly, these MT-driven patterns successively become imprinted and sufficient to sustain the continued progression of wall thickening in the absence of MTs and CSI1/POM2 function. Hence, two complementary principles underpin wall patterning during xylem vessel development.
NA	Gene Expression Dynamics in Rice Peduncles at the Heading Stage	2020	Front Genet	Grass Genetics and Informatics Group, School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.	Improving grain yield in the staple food crop rice has been long sought goal of plant biotechnology. One of the traits with significant impact on rice breeding programs is peduncle elongation at the time of heading failing which leads to significant reduction in grain yield due to incomplete panicle exsertion. To decipher transcriptional dynamics and molecular players underlying peduncle elongation, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of elongating and non-elongating peduncles in two Indian cultivars, Swarna and Pokkali, at the time of heading. Along with genes associated with cell division and cell wall biosynthesis, we observed significant enrichment of genes associated with auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis/signaling in the elongating peduncles before heading in both the genotypes. Similarly, genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and mobilization, abiotic stress response along with cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene biosynthesis/signaling were enriched in non-elongating peduncles post heading. Significant enrichment of genes belonging to key transcription factor families highlights their specialized roles in peduncle elongation and grain filling before and after heading, respectively. A comparison with anther/pollen development-related genes provided 76 candidates with overlapping roles in anther/pollen development and peduncle elongation. Some of these are important for carbohydrate remobilization to the developing grains. These can be engineered to combat with incomplete panicle exsertion in male sterile lines and manipulate carbohydrate dynamics in grasses. Overall, this study provides baseline information about potential target genes for engineering peduncle elongation with implications on plant height, biomass composition and grain yields in rice.
NA	The OsmiRNA166b-OsHox32 pair regulates mechanical strength of rice plants by modulating cell wall biosynthesis	2021	Plant Biotechnol J	Key Laboratory of South China Agricultural Plant Molecular Analysis and Genetic Improvement, and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Botany, South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China.	The plant cell wall provides mechanical strength to support plant growth and development and to determine plant architecture. Cellulose and mixed-linkage glucan (MLG) present in primary cell wall, whereas cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose exist in secondary cell wall. Biosynthesis of the cell wall biopolymers needs the coordinated transcriptional regulation of all the biosynthetic genes. The module of OsmiR166b-OsHox32 regulates expression levels of the genes related to biosynthesis of MLG, cellulose and lignin. Transgenic plants knocking down miR166b (STTM166b) by short tandem target mimic (STTM) technology or overexpressing OsHox32 (OEHox32) showed drooping leaves and brittle culms. Due to accumulation of less lignin and cellulose, the cell wall thickness of STTM166b and OEHox32 plants was reduced when compared to that of wild-type plants. Overexpression of miR166b (OE166b) in rice plants or knocking down of OsHox32 by RNA interference (RNAiHox32) led to increased thickness of cell walls and enhanced mechanical strength of culms. Molecular analyses showed that OsmiR166b-OsHox32 pair regulates cell wall-related gene expression. OsHox32 binds to the promoters of OsCAD2 and OsCESA7 to suppress the expression levels of these two genes. The suppression of OsCAD2 is synergistic when OsHox32 is co-expressed with OSH15 (Oryza sativa homeobox 15). OsHox32 interacts with OSH15, and the START domain of OsHox32, harbouring the miR166b cleavage site, is required for the interaction of these two proteins. Our results demonstrate that OsmiR166b-OsHox32 pair plays important roles not only in plant growth and development but also in plant architecture by regulating the cell wall-related gene expression.
