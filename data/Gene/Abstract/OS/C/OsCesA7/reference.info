1330073.pdf	Three Distinct Rice Cellulose Synthase Catalytic Subunit Genes Required for Cellulose Synthesis in the Secondary Wall	2003	Plant Physiol	Institute of the Society for Techno-innovation of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0854, Japan.	Several brittle culm mutations of rice (Oryza sativa) causing fragility of plant tissues have been identified genetically but not characterized at a molecular level. We show here that the genes responsible for three distinct brittle mutations of rice, induced by the insertion of the endogenous retrotransposon Tos17, correspond to CesA (cellulose synthase catalytic subunit) genes, OsCesA4, OsCesA7 and OsCesA9. Three CesA genes were expressed in seedlings, culms, premature panicles, and roots but not in mature leaves, and the expression profiles were almost identical among the three genes. Cellulose contents were dramatically decreased (8.9%-25.5% of the wild-type level) in the culms of null mutants of the three genes, indicating that these genes are not functionally redundant. Consistent with these results, cell walls in the cortical fiber cells were shown to be thinner in all the mutants than in wild-type plants. Based on these observations, the structure of a cellulose-synthesizing complex involved in the synthesis of the secondary cell wall is discussed.
NA	The expression of a rice secondary wall-specific cellulose synthase gene, OsCesA7, is directly regulated by a rice transcription factor, OsMYB58/63.	2015	Planta	Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere, Kyoto University, Uji, Kyoto, 611-0011, Japan.	A rice MYB transcription factor, OsMYB58/63, was found to directly upregulate the expression of a rice secondary wall-specific cellulose synthase gene, cellulose synthase A7 ( OsCesA7 ); in contrast, the Arabidopsis putative orthologs AtMYB58 and AtMYB63 have been shown to specifically activate lignin biosynthesis. Although indirect evidence has shown that grass plants are similar to but partially different from dicotyledonous ones in transcriptional regulation of lignocellulose biosynthesis, little is known about the differences. This study showed that a rice MYB transcription factor, OsMYB58/63, directly upregulated the expression of a rice secondary wall-specific cellulose synthase gene, cellulose synthase A7 (OsCesA7). Gene co-expression analysis showed that, in rice, OsMYB58/63 and several rice MYB genes were co-expressed with genes encoding lignocellulose biosynthetic enzymes. The expression levels of OsMYB55/61, OsMYB55/61-L, OsMYB58/63, and OsMYB42/85 were commonly found to be high in culm internodes and nodes. All four MYB transcription factors functioned as transcriptional activators in yeast cells. OsMYB58/63 most strongly transactivated the expression of OsCesA7 in rice protoplasts. Moreover, recombinant OsMYB58/63 protein was bound to two distinct cis-regulatory elements, AC-II and SMRE3, in the OsCesA7 promoter. This is in sharp contrast to the role of Arabidopsis orthologs, AtMYB58 and AtMYB63, which had been reported to specifically activate lignin biosynthesis. The promoter analysis revealed that AC elements, which are the binding sites for MYB58 and MYB63, were lacking in cellulose and xylan biosynthetic genes in Arabidopsis, but present in cellulose, xylan, and lignin biosynthetic genes in rice, implying that the difference of transcriptional regulation between rice and Arabidopsis is due to the distinct composition of promoters. Our results provide a new insight into transcriptional regulation in grass lignocellulose biosynthesis.
NA	A Missense Mutation in the Zinc Finger Domain of OsCESA7 Deleteriously Affects Cellulose Biosynthesis and Plant Growth in Rice.	2016	PLoS One	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Rice is a model plant species for the study of cellulose biosynthesis. We isolated a mutant, S1-24, from ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-treated plants of the japonica rice cultivar, Nipponbare. The mutant exhibited brittle culms and other pleiotropic phenotypes such as dwarfism and partial sterility. The brittle culms resulted from reduced mechanical strength due to a defect in thickening of the sclerenchyma cell wall and reduced cellulose content in the culms of the S1-24 mutant. Map-based gene cloning and a complementation assay showed that phenotypes of the S1-24 mutant were caused by a recessive point mutation in the OsCESA7 gene, which encodes cellulose synthase A subunit 7. The missense mutation changed the highly conserved C40 to Y in the zinc finger domain. The OsCESA7 gene is expressed predominantly in the culm at the mature stage, particularly in mechanical tissues such as vascular bundles and sclerenchyma cells, consistent with the brittle phenotype in the culm. These results indicate that OsCESA7 plays an important role in cellulose biosynthesis and plant growth.
