OsCesA4|Bc7|bc11	OsCesA7	Three Distinct Rice Cellulose Synthase Catalytic Subunit Genes Required for Cellulose Synthesis in the Secondary Wall	We show here that the genes responsible for three distinct brittle mutations of rice, induced by the insertion of the endogenous retrotransposon Tos17, correspond to CesA (cellulose synthase catalytic subunit) genes, OsCesA4, OsCesA7 and OsCesA9

OsCesA7	OsMYB103L|CEF1	CEF1/OsMYB103L is involved in GA-mediated regulation of secondary wall biosynthesis in rice	OsMYB103L mediates cellulose biosynthesis and secondary walls formation mainly through directly binding the CESA4, CESA7, CESA9 and BC1 promoters and regulating their expression
OsCesA7	OSHB4|OsHox32	The OsmiRNA166b-OsHox32 pair regulates mechanical strength of rice plants by modulating cell wall biosynthesis	 OsHox32 binds to the promoters of OsCAD2 and OsCESA7 to suppress the expression levels of these two genes
GH2|OsCAD2	OsCesA7	The OsmiRNA166b-OsHox32 pair regulates mechanical strength of rice plants by modulating cell wall biosynthesis	 OsHox32 binds to the promoters of OsCAD2 and OsCESA7 to suppress the expression levels of these two genes
Bc6|OsCesA9	OsCesA7	A Semi-Dominant Mutation in OsCESA9 Improves Salt Tolerance and Favors Field Straw Decay Traits by Altering Cell Wall Properties in Rice	 Further experiments indicated that the OsCESA9D387N mutation may compete with the wild-type OsCESA9 for interacting with OsCESA4 and OsCESA7, further forming non-functional or partially functional CSCs
