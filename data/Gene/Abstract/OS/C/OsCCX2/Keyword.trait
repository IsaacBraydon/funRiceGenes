OsCCX2	tolerance	A rice tonoplastic calcium exchanger, OsCCX2 mediates Ca(2+)/cation transport in yeast.	 In contrast to AtCCXs, OsCCX2 expressing K667 yeast cells show tolerance towards excess Na(+), Li(+), Fe(2+), Zn(2+) and Co(2+) and suggest its ability to transport both mono as well as divalent cations in yeast
OsCCX2	tolerance	A rice tonoplastic calcium exchanger, OsCCX2 mediates Ca(2+)/cation transport in yeast.	 OsCCX2 can be used as potential candidate for enhancing the abiotic stress tolerance in plants as well as for phytoremediation of heavy metal polluted soil
OsCCX2	abiotic stress	A rice tonoplastic calcium exchanger, OsCCX2 mediates Ca(2+)/cation transport in yeast.	 Rice genome encode four CCXs and only OsCCX2 transcript showed differential expression under abiotic stresses and Ca(2+) starvation conditions
