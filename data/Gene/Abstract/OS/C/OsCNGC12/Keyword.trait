OsCNGC12	development	The herbicide bensulfuron-methyl inhibits rice seedling development by blocking calcium ion flux in the OsCNGC12 channel.	The herbicide bensulfuron-methyl inhibits rice seedling development by blocking calcium ion flux in the OsCNGC12 channel.
OsCNGC12	seedling	The herbicide bensulfuron-methyl inhibits rice seedling development by blocking calcium ion flux in the OsCNGC12 channel.	The herbicide bensulfuron-methyl inhibits rice seedling development by blocking calcium ion flux in the OsCNGC12 channel.
OsCNGC12	tolerance	The herbicide bensulfuron-methyl inhibits rice seedling development by blocking calcium ion flux in the OsCNGC12 channel.	 This study found that the OsCNGC12 mutants not only reduced BSM uptake but also compromised the Ca(2) ⁺ efflux caused by BSM in the roots, regulating dynamic equilibrium of Ca(2) ⁺ inside the cell and conferring non-target-site tolerance to BSM
OsCNGC12	calcium	The herbicide bensulfuron-methyl inhibits rice seedling development by blocking calcium ion flux in the OsCNGC12 channel.	The herbicide bensulfuron-methyl inhibits rice seedling development by blocking calcium ion flux in the OsCNGC12 channel.
OsCNGC12	herbicide	The herbicide bensulfuron-methyl inhibits rice seedling development by blocking calcium ion flux in the OsCNGC12 channel.	The herbicide bensulfuron-methyl inhibits rice seedling development by blocking calcium ion flux in the OsCNGC12 channel.
