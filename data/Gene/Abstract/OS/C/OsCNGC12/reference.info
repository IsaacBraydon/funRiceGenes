NA	The herbicide bensulfuron-methyl inhibits rice seedling development by blocking calcium ion flux in the OsCNGC12 channel.	2023	Plant J	National Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide/Key Laboratory of Natural Pesticide and Chemical Biology, Ministry of Education, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Identification of translocator protein-related genes involved in bensulfuron-methyl (BSM) uptake and transport in rice could facilitate the development of herbicide-tolerant cultivars by inactivating them. This study found that the OsCNGC12 mutants not only reduced BSM uptake but also compromised the Ca(2) ⁺ efflux caused by BSM in the roots, regulating dynamic equilibrium of Ca(2) ⁺ inside the cell and conferring non-target-site tolerance to BSM.
