OsCUL1-1	OsMBTB32	OsMBTB32, a MATH-BTB domain-containing protein that interacts with OsCUL1s to regulate salt tolerance in rice.	 We further found that OsCUL1 proteins, particularly OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-3, interact with OsMBTB32 and may suppress the function of OsMBTB32 during salt stress
OsCUL1-1	OsMBTB32	OsMBTB32, a MATH-BTB domain-containing protein that interacts with OsCUL1s to regulate salt tolerance in rice.	 Moreover, OsWRKY42, a homolog of ZmWRKY114 which negatively regulates salt stress in rice, directly binds to the W-box of OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-3 promoters to promote the interaction of OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-3 with OsMBTB32 protein in rice
