OsCOM1	OsRad21-4|OsREC8	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
OsCOM1	OsRad21-4|OsREC8	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
OsCOM1	PAIR2	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
OsCOM1	PAIR2	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
OsCOM1	OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
MER3|RCK	OsCOM1	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
MER3|RCK	OsCOM1	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
OsCOM1	PAIR3	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
OsCOM1	ZEP1	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
OsCOM1	ZEP1	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
OsCOM1	OsDMC1|DMC1B	OsDMC1 is not required for homologous pairing in rice meiosis.	In the absence of OsDMC1, early recombination events probably occur normally, leading to normal localization of Î³H2AX, PAIR3, OsMRE11, OsCOM1 and OsRAD51C
OsCOM1	OsDMC1|DMC1B	OsDMC1 is not required for homologous pairing in rice meiosis.	Moreover, OsDMC1 was not detected in pairing-defective mutants, such as pair2, pair3, Oscom1 and Osrad51c, while it was loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in zep1, Osmer3, Oszip4 and Oshei10
OsCOM1	ZYGO1	The F-box protein ZYGO1 mediates bouquet formation to promote homologous pairing, synapsis, and recombination in rice meiosis.	 The suppressed telomere clustering in homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis 1 (pair1) zygo1 and rice completion of meiotic recombination (Oscom1) zygo1 double mutants, together with the altered localization of OsSAD1 (a SUN protein associated with the nuclear envelope) in zygo1 showed that ZYGO1 has a significant function in bouquet formation
