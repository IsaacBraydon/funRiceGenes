OsCOM1	meiotic	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
OsCOM1	meiotic	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
OsCOM1	meiosis	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	These results provide direct evidence for the functions of OsCOM1 in promoting homologous synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis
OsCOM1	meiosis	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis
