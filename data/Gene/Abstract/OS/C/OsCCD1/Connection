OsCCD1	OsNCED1|OsCCD4a	RNAi-mediated Suppression of Three Rice Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenase Genes, OsCCD1, 4a, and 4b, Increases Carotenoid Content of Rice.	 Suppression of the OsCCD1, OsCCD4a, and OsCCD4b genes using RNA interference (Ri) was verified in transgenic rice plants by quantitative RT-PCR and small RNA detection
OsCCD1	OsNCED1|OsCCD4a	RNAi-mediated Suppression of Three Rice Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenase Genes, OsCCD1, 4a, and 4b, Increases Carotenoid Content of Rice.	 In addition, the levels of four carotenoids decreased when OsCCD1, OsCCD4a, and OsCCD4b were overexpressed in E
OsCCD1	OsNCED1|OsCCD4a	RNAi-mediated Suppression of Three Rice Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenase Genes, OsCCD1, 4a, and 4b, Increases Carotenoid Content of Rice.	 OsCCD1 and OsCCD4a had a similar high carotenoid degrading activity, followed by OsCCD4b without substrate specificity
