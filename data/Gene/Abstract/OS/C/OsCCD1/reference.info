Carotenoids are converted by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases that catalyze oxidative cleavage reactions leading to apocarotenoids. However, apocarotenoids can also be further truncated by some members of this enzyme family. The plant carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 (CCD1) subfamily is known to degrade both carotenoids and apocarotenoids in vitro, leading to different volatile compounds. In this study, we investigated the impact of the rice CCD1 (OsCCD1) on the pigmentation of Golden Rice 2 (GR2), a genetically modified rice variety accumulating carotenoids in the endosperm. For this purpose, the corresponding cDNA was introduced into the rice genome under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter in sense and anti-sense orientations. Despite high expression levels of OsCCD1 in sense plants, pigment analysis revealed carotenoid levels and patterns comparable to those of GR2, pleading against carotenoids as substrates in rice endosperm. In support, similar carotenoid contents were determined in anti-sense plants. To check whether OsCCD1 overexpressed in GR2 endosperm is active, in vitro assays were performed with apocarotenoid substrates. HPLC analysis confirmed the cleavage activity of introduced OsCCD1. Our data indicate that apocarotenoids rather than carotenoids are the substrates of OsCCD1 in planta.
NA	Characterization of the rice carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 reveals a novel route for geranial biosynthesis.	2008	FEBS J	Faculty of Biology, Institute of Biology II, Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg, Germany.	Carotenoid cleavage products--apocarotenoids--include biologically active compounds, such as hormones, pigments and volatiles. Their biosynthesis is initiated by the oxidative cleavage of C-C double bonds in carotenoid backbones, leading to aldehydes and/or ketones. This step is catalyzed by carotenoid oxygenases, which constitute an ubiquitous enzyme family, including the group of plant carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases 1 (CCD1s), which mediates the formation of volatile C(13) ketones, such as beta-ionone, by cleaving the C9-C10 and C9'-C10' double bonds of cyclic and acyclic carotenoids. Recently, it was reported that plant CCD1s also act on the C5-C6/C5'-C6' double bonds of acyclic carotenes, leading to the volatile C(8) ketone 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we show here that rice CCD1 converts lycopene into the three different volatiles, pseudoionone, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and geranial (C(10)), suggesting that the C7-C8/C7'-C8' double bonds of acyclic carotenoid ends constitute a novel cleavage site for the CCD1 plant subfamily. The results were confirmed by HPLC, LC-MS and GC-MS analyses, and further substantiated by in vitro incubations with the monocyclic carotenoid 3-OH-gamma-carotene and with linear synthetic substrates. Bicyclic carotenoids were cleaved, as reported for other plant CCD1s, at the C9-C10 and C9'-C10' double bonds. Our study reveals a novel source for the widely occurring plant volatile geranial, which is the cleavage of noncyclic ends of carotenoids.
NA	RNAi-mediated Suppression of Three Rice Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenase Genes, OsCCD1, 4a, and 4b, Increases Carotenoid Content of Rice.	2018	J Exp Bot	Department of Genetic Engineering and Graduate School of Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Republic of Korea.	Carotenoids of staple food crops have high nutritional value as provitamin A components in the daily diet. To increase the levels of carotenoids, inhibition of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs), which degrade carotenoids, has been considered as a promising target in crop biotechnology. Suppression of the OsCCD1, OsCCD4a, and OsCCD4b genes using RNA interference (Ri) was verified in transgenic rice plants by quantitative RT-PCR and small RNA detection. Leaf carotenoids were statistically increased overall in OsCCD4a_Ri lines of the T1 generation, and the highest accumulation of 1.3-fold was found in the OsCCD4a_Ri 7 line of the T2 generation relative to non-transgenic plants. The effects on seed carotenoids were elucidated via cross-fertilization between ¦Â-carotene-producing transgenic rice and one of two independent homozygous lines of OsCCD1_Ri, OsCCD4a_Ri or OsCCD4b_Ri. As a result, seed carotenoids were increased to a maximum of 1.4- and 1.6-fold in OsCCD1_Ri and OsCCD4a_Ri, respectively, with a different preference toward ¦Á-ring carotenoids and -ring carotenoids; levels were not established in OsCCD4b_Ri. In addition, the levels of four carotenoids decreased when OsCCD1, OsCCD4a, and OsCCD4b were overexpressed in E. coli strains accumulating phytoene, lycopene, -carotene, and zeaxanthin. OsCCD1 and OsCCD4a had a similar high carotenoid degrading activity, followed by OsCCD4b without substrate specificity. Collectively, the blocking of OsCCD4a activity might have potential as a practical tool for enhancing the carotenoid level of the carotenoid-accumulating seed endosperms as well as leaves of rice plants.
