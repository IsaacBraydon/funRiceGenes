OsCW-ZF7|WG7	OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	Wide Grain 7 increases grain width by enhancing H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the OsMADS1 promoter in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 EMSAs and ChIP-qPCR assay confirmed that WG7 directly bound to the promoter of OsMADS1, a grain size gene, and thereby significantly activated its expression
OsCW-ZF7|WG7	OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	Wide Grain 7 increases grain width by enhancing H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the OsMADS1 promoter in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Compared with the wild-type, deletion mutants of the cis-element motif exhibited lower expression of OsMADS1 and produced narrower grains, implicating the requirement of this motif for WG7 function

These findings demonstrated that WG7 upregulated OsMADS1 expression by directly binding to its promoter, enhanced histone H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the promoter and ultimately increased grain width
