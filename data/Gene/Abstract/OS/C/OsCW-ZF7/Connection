OsCW-ZF7|WG7	OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	Wide Grain 7 increases grain width by enhancing H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the OsMADS1 promoter in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 EMSAs and ChIP-qPCR assay confirmed that WG7 directly bound to the promoter of OsMADS1, a grain size gene, and thereby significantly activated its expression
OsCW-ZF7|WG7	OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	Wide Grain 7 increases grain width by enhancing H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the OsMADS1 promoter in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Compared with the wild-type, deletion mutants of the cis-element motif exhibited lower expression of OsMADS1 and produced narrower grains, implicating the requirement of this motif for WG7 function
OsCW-ZF7|WG7	OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	Wide Grain 7 increases grain width by enhancing H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the OsMADS1 promoter in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 ChIP-qPCR assays showed that WG7 enhanced histone H3K4me3 enrichment in the promoter of OsMADS1
OsCW-ZF7|WG7	OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	Wide Grain 7 increases grain width by enhancing H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the OsMADS1 promoter in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 These findings demonstrated that WG7 upregulated OsMADS1 expression by directly binding to its promoter, enhanced histone H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the promoter and ultimately increased grain width
OsCW-ZF5	OsCW-ZF7|WG7	Functional characterization of rice CW-domain containing zinc finger proteins involved in histone recognition.	 Here, we identified three cysteine-tryptophan (CW)-domain containing zinc finger (ZF) proteins involved in histone recognition, namely OsCW-ZF3, OsCW-ZF5 and OsCW-ZF7
OsCW-ZF5	OsCW-ZF7|WG7	Functional characterization of rice CW-domain containing zinc finger proteins involved in histone recognition.	 In contrast to OsCW-ZF3 and OsCW-ZF5 where the CW domains bind histone H3 lysine 4 with different methylated forms (H3K4me), the CW domain from OsCW-ZF7 recognizes only trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3)
