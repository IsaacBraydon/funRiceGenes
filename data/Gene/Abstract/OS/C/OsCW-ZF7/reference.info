NA	Functional characterization of rice CW-domain containing zinc finger proteins involved in histone recognition	2017	Plant Science	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, PR China	Histone recognition is important for understanding the mechanisms of histone modification, which play a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation during plant development. Here, we identified three cysteine-tryptophan (CW)-domain containing zinc finger (ZF) proteins involved in histone recognition, namely OsCW-ZF3, OsCW-ZF5 and OsCW-ZF7. Protein sequence analysis showed that they have two unknown motifs in addition to the CW domain. All three OsCW-ZFs were expressed in aerial tissues, with relatively high levels in developing panicles. Subcellular localization revealed that the OsCW-ZFs target the cell nucleus and CW domains are not necessary for their nuclear localization. In contrast to OsCW-ZF3 and OsCW-ZF5 where the CW domains bind histone H3 lysine 4 with different methylated forms (H3K4me), the CW domain from OsCW-ZF7 recognizes only trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3). Analysis of mutant suggested that three conserved tryptophan residues in the CW domain are essential for binding to H3K4me. Further study found that OsCW-ZF7 interacts with TAFII20, a transcription initiation factor TFIID 20 kDa subunit. Knockout of OsCW-ZF7 caused defective development of awns. This study provides new insights into our understanding of the CW domain and lays a foundation for further investigation of its roles in rice.
NA	Wide Grain 7 increases grain width by enhancing H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the OsMADS1 promoter in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2019	Plant J	National Key Lab of Crop Genetic improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Grain size is a major determinant of grain weight, a key component of grain yield of rice. Here, we identified the grain size gene WIDE GRAIN 7 (WG7) from a T-DNA insertion mutant. The grain size of WG7 knockout mutants and WG7 overexpression lines indicated that WG7 is a positive regulator of grain size. WG7 encodes a cysteine-tryptophan (CW) domain-containing transcriptional activator. EMSAs and ChIP-qPCR assay confirmed that WG7 directly bound to the promoter of OsMADS1, a grain size gene, and thereby significantly activated its expression. Point mutations showed that the cis-element CATTTC motif in the promoter was the binding site of WG7. Compared with the wild-type, deletion mutants of the cis-element motif exhibited lower expression of OsMADS1 and produced narrower grains, implicating the requirement of this motif for WG7 function. ChIP-qPCR assays showed that WG7 enhanced histone H3K4me3 enrichment in the promoter of OsMADS1. WG7 underwent directional selection due to the poor fertility of the nonfunctional mutant. These findings demonstrated that WG7 upregulated OsMADS1 expression by directly binding to its promoter, enhanced histone H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the promoter and ultimately increased grain width. This study will enrich the knowledge concerning the regulatory network of grain size formation in rice.
NA	Bin-based genome-wide association studies reveal superior alleles for improvement of appearance quality using a 4-way MAGIC population in rice	2020	J Adv Res	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agriculture University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Introduction: The multiparental population provides us the chance to identify superior alleles controlling a trait for genetic improvement. Genome wide association studies at bin level (bin-GWAS) are expected to be more power in QTL mapping than GWAS at SNP level (SNP-GWAS).  Objectives: This study is to estimate genetic effects of QTL conferring grain appearance quality in rice by SNP-GWAS and bin-GWAS, compare their power in QTL mapping and identify the superior alleles of all detected QTL from 4 parents for genetic improvement.  Methods: A 4-way MAGIC population and its four founders were cultivated in two environments to dissect the genetic basis of rice grain appearance quality. Both SNP-GWAS and bin-GWAS were conducted for QTL mapping. Multiple comparison among 4 parental bin/alleles was used to identify the superior alleles.  Results: A total of 16 and 20 QTL associated with grain appearance quality were identified by SNP- and bin-GWAS, respectively. A minor chalkiness QTL qPGWC8.2/qDEC8 was assigned to a 30-kb genomic region, in which OsMH_08T0121900 is the potential candidate gene because its encoded protein, glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase precursor is involved in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway. The superior parental alleles for GS3, GL3.1, GW5, GW7, and Chalk5 and two QTLs were almost carried by the high-quality parents Cypress and Yuejingsimiao (YJSM), while the poor-quality parent Guichao-2 (GC2) always carried the inferior alleles. The top five recombinant inbred lines with the highest quality of grain shape and chalkiness traits all carried gene combinations of superior alleles.  Conclusions: Both SNP- and bin-GWAS methods are encouraged for joint QTL mapping with MAGIC population. qPGWC8.2/qDEC8 is a novel candidate gene strongly associated with chalkiness. The superior alleles of GS3, GW5, GL3.1, GW7, Chalk5 and qPGWC8.2 were identified, and the pyramiding of these superior alleles is helpful to improve rice appearance quality.
