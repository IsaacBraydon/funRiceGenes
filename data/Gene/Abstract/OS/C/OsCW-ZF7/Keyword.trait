OsCW-ZF7|WG7	development	Functional characterization of rice CW-domain containing zinc finger proteins involved in histone recognition	 Knockout of OsCW-ZF7 caused defective development of awns
OsCW-ZF7|WG7	zinc	Functional characterization of rice CW-domain containing zinc finger proteins involved in histone recognition	 Here, we identified three cysteine-tryptophan (CW)-domain containing zinc finger (ZF) proteins involved in histone recognition, namely OsCW-ZF3, OsCW-ZF5 and OsCW-ZF7
OsCW-ZF7|WG7	grain	Wide Grain 7 increases grain width by enhancing H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the OsMADS1 promoter in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 The grain size of WG7 knockout mutants and WG7 overexpression lines indicated that WG7 is a positive regulator of grain size
OsCW-ZF7|WG7	grain	Wide Grain 7 increases grain width by enhancing H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the OsMADS1 promoter in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 EMSAs and ChIP-qPCR assay confirmed that WG7 directly bound to the promoter of OsMADS1, a grain size gene, and thereby significantly activated its expression
OsCW-ZF7|WG7	grain	Wide Grain 7 increases grain width by enhancing H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the OsMADS1 promoter in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 These findings demonstrated that WG7 upregulated OsMADS1 expression by directly binding to its promoter, enhanced histone H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the promoter and ultimately increased grain width
OsCW-ZF7|WG7	grain size	Wide Grain 7 increases grain width by enhancing H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the OsMADS1 promoter in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 The grain size of WG7 knockout mutants and WG7 overexpression lines indicated that WG7 is a positive regulator of grain size
OsCW-ZF7|WG7	grain size	Wide Grain 7 increases grain width by enhancing H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the OsMADS1 promoter in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 EMSAs and ChIP-qPCR assay confirmed that WG7 directly bound to the promoter of OsMADS1, a grain size gene, and thereby significantly activated its expression
OsCW-ZF7|WG7	fertility	Wide Grain 7 increases grain width by enhancing H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the OsMADS1 promoter in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 WG7 underwent directional selection due to the poor fertility of the nonfunctional mutant
OsCW-ZF7|WG7	grain width	Wide Grain 7 increases grain width by enhancing H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the OsMADS1 promoter in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 These findings demonstrated that WG7 upregulated OsMADS1 expression by directly binding to its promoter, enhanced histone H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the promoter and ultimately increased grain width
OsCW-ZF7|WG7	transcriptional activator	Wide Grain 7 increases grain width by enhancing H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the OsMADS1 promoter in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 WG7 encodes a cysteine-tryptophan (CW) domain-containing transcriptional activator
OsCW-ZF7|WG7	development	Functional characterization of rice CW-domain containing zinc finger proteins involved in histone recognition.	 Knockout of OsCW-ZF7 caused defective development of awns
