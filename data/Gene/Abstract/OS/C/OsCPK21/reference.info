Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) play important roles in regulating downstream components in calcium signaling pathways. In rice, the CDPKs constitute a large multigene family consisting of 29 genes, but the biological functions and functional divergence or redundancy of most of these genes remain unclear. Using a mini-scale full-length cDNA overexpressor (FOX) gene hunting system, we generated 250 independent transgenic rice plants overexpressing individual rice CDPKs (CDPK FOX-rice lines). These CDPK FOX-rice lines were screened for salt stress tolerance. The survival rate of the OsCPK21-FOX plants was higher than that of wild-type (WT) plants grown under high salinity conditions. The inhibition of seedling growth by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment was greater in the OsCPK21-FOX plants than in WT plants. Several ABA- and high salinity-inducible genes were more highly expressed in the OsCPK21-FOX plants than in WT plants. These results suggest that OsCPK21 is involved in the positive regulation of the signaling pathways that are involved in the response to ABA and salt stress.
NA	Calcium-dependent protein kinase 21 phosphorylates 14-3-3 proteins in response to ABA signaling and salt stress in rice.	2017	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Beijing Key Laboratory of Gene Resources and Molecular Development, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.	The calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are a class of plant-specific kinase that directly bind Ca(2+) and mediate the calcium-signaling pathways to play important physiological roles in growth and development. The rice genome contains 31 CDPK genes, one of which, OsCPK21, is known to modulate the abscisic acid (ABA) and salt stress responses in this crop; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation are largely unknown. In the present study, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening, glutathione S-transferase pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays to confirm the interaction between OsCPK21 and one of its putative targets, Os14-3-3 (OsGF14e). We used an in<U+00A0>vitro kinase assay and site-directed mutagenesis to verify that OsCPK21 phosphorylates OsGF14e at Tyr-138. We used real-time PCR to reveal that several ABA and salt inducible genes were more highly expressed in the OsCPK21-OE and OsGF14e WT-OE plants than in the mutant OsGF14e Y138A-OE and wild-type plants. These results suggest that OsCPK21 phosphorylates OsGF14e to facilitate the response to ABA and salt stress.
NA	OsCPK21 is required for pollen late-stage development in rice.	2019	J Plant Physiol	Beijing Key Laboratory of Gene Resources and Molecular Development, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China. Electronic address: 48722363@qq.com.	In flowering plants, pollen development is a critical step for reproductive success and necessarily involves complex genetic regulatory networks. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are plant-specific calcium sensors involved in the regulation of plant development and adaption to the environment; however, whether they play a role in regulating male reproduction remains elusive. Here, we found that the knockdown of spikelet-specific OsCPK21 causes pollen abortion in OsCPK21-RNAi transgenic plants. Severe defects in pollen development initiated at stage 10 of anther development and simultaneous cell death occurred in the pollen cells of OsCPK21-RNAi plants. Microarray analysis and qRT-PCR revealed that the transcription of OsCPK21 is coordinated with that of MIKC*-type MADS box transcription factors OsMADS62, OsMADS63, and OsMADS68 during rice anther development. We further showed that OsCPK21 indirectly up-regulates the transcription of OsMADS62, OsMADS63, and OsMADS68 through the potential MYB binding site, DRE/CRT element, and/or new ERF binding motif localised in the promoter region of these three MADS genes. These findings suggest that OsCPK21 plays an essential role in pollengenesis, possibly via indirectly regulating the transcription of MIKC*-type MADS box proteins.
