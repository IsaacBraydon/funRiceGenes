OsCPK21	OsGF14e|GF14e|GID2	Calcium-dependent protein kinase 21 phosphorylates 14-3-3 proteins in response to ABA signaling and salt stress in rice.	 In the present study, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening, glutathione S-transferase pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays to confirm the interaction between OsCPK21 and one of its putative targets, Os14-3-3 (OsGF14e)
OsCPK21	OsGF14e|GF14e|GID2	Calcium-dependent protein kinase 21 phosphorylates 14-3-3 proteins in response to ABA signaling and salt stress in rice.	 We used an in<U+00A0>vitro kinase assay and site-directed mutagenesis to verify that OsCPK21 phosphorylates OsGF14e at Tyr-138
OsCPK21	OsGF14e|GF14e|GID2	Calcium-dependent protein kinase 21 phosphorylates 14-3-3 proteins in response to ABA signaling and salt stress in rice.	 These results suggest that OsCPK21 phosphorylates OsGF14e to facilitate the response to ABA and salt stress
OsCPK21	OsHSD2	OsHSD2 interaction with and phosphorylation by OsCPK21 is essential for lipid metabolism during rice caryopsis development.	OsHSD2 interaction with and phosphorylation by OsCPK21 is essential for lipid metabolism during rice caryopsis development.
OsCPK21	OsHSD2	OsHSD2 interaction with and phosphorylation by OsCPK21 is essential for lipid metabolism during rice caryopsis development.	 Then, we verified the interaction between OsCPK21 and OsHSD2 using yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence assays and revealed the in vitro phosphorylation of OsHSD2 by OsCPK21
OsCPK21	OsHSD2	OsHSD2 interaction with and phosphorylation by OsCPK21 is essential for lipid metabolism during rice caryopsis development.	 Furthermore, oscpk21 and oshsd2 mutants were generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, and we found that the lipid profiles were drastically changed in both oscpk21 and oshsd2, implying that OsHSD2 phosphorylated by OsCPK21 regulates lipid abundance in caryopsis development, thereby providing a potential target for the genetic improvement of rice grain quality in future lipid-related breeding and biotechnology applications
