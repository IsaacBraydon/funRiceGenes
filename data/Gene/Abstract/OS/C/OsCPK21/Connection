OsCPK21	OsGF14e|GF14e|GID2	Calcium-dependent protein kinase 21 phosphorylates 14-3-3 proteins in response to ABA signaling and salt stress in rice.	 In the present study, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening, glutathione S-transferase pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays to confirm the interaction between OsCPK21 and one of its putative targets, Os14-3-3 (OsGF14e)
OsCPK21	OsGF14e|GF14e|GID2	Calcium-dependent protein kinase 21 phosphorylates 14-3-3 proteins in response to ABA signaling and salt stress in rice.	 We used an in<U+00A0>vitro kinase assay and site-directed mutagenesis to verify that OsCPK21 phosphorylates OsGF14e at Tyr-138
OsCPK21	OsGF14e|GF14e|GID2	Calcium-dependent protein kinase 21 phosphorylates 14-3-3 proteins in response to ABA signaling and salt stress in rice.	 These results suggest that OsCPK21 phosphorylates OsGF14e to facilitate the response to ABA and salt stress
