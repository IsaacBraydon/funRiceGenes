OsCOI1|OsCOI1a	OsCOI1b	Mutation of Oryza sativa CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1b (OsCOI1b) delays leaf senescence.	The Arabidopsis coi1-1 plants containing 35S:OsCOI1a or 35S:OsCOI1b rescued the delayed leaf senescence during dark incubation, suggesting that both OsCOI1a and OsCOI1b are required for promoting leaf senescence in rice

OsCOI1b	OSK1	A bacterial kinase phosphorylates OSK1 to suppress stomatal immunity in rice.	 Intriguingly, OSK1 phosphorylation at Ser(53) by XopC2 exclusively increases the binding affinity of OSK1 to the jasmonate receptor OsCOI1b, and specifically enhances the ubiquitination and degradation of JAZ transcription repressors and plant disease susceptibility through inhibiting stomatal immunity

OsCOI1b is involved in root growth and grain-size control and plays overlapping roles with OsCOI1a in spikelet development, while OsCOI2 regulates leaf senescence, male sterility, root growth, and grain size

OsCOI1b	OsCOI2	Genetic analysis of the rice jasmonate receptors reveals specialized functions for OsCOI2.	 Monocots such as rice have two groups of COI genes due to gene duplication: OsCOI1a and OsCOI1b that are functionally equivalent to the dicotyledons COI1 and OsCOI2 whose function remains unclear
