OsCOI1b	JA receptor	Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice	We show that EG1 is a plastid-targeted lipase that participates in JA biosynthesis, and EG2/OsJAZ1 is a JA signalling repressor that interacts with a putative JA receptor, OsCOI1b, to trigger OsJAZ1¡¯s degradation during spikelet development
