OsCOI1b	JA receptor	Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice	We show that EG1 is a plastid-targeted lipase that participates in JA biosynthesis, and EG2/OsJAZ1 is a JA signalling repressor that interacts with a putative JA receptor, OsCOI1b, to trigger OsJAZ1's degradation during spikelet development
OsCOI1b	leaf	Mutation of Oryza sativa CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1b (OsCOI1b) delays leaf senescence.	Here, we use the oscoi1b-1 knockout mutants to show that OsCOI1b mainly affects leaf senescence under senescence-promoting conditions
OsCOI1b	leaf	Mutation of Oryza sativa CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1b (OsCOI1b) delays leaf senescence.	The Arabidopsis coi1-1 plants containing 35S:OsCOI1a or 35S:OsCOI1b rescued the delayed leaf senescence during dark incubation, suggesting that both OsCOI1a and OsCOI1b are required for promoting leaf senescence in rice

OsCOI1b	fertility	Genome Editing Reveals both the Crucial Role of OsCOI2 in Jasmonate Signaling, and the Functional Diversity of COI1 Homologs in Rice Functional Diversity of COI1 Homologs in Rice.	 The oscoi2 mutants, but not the oscoi1a and oscoi1b mutants, exhibited severely low fertility, indicating the crucial role of OsCOI2 in rice fertility
OsCOI1b	jasmonate	Genome Editing Reveals both the Crucial Role of OsCOI2 in Jasmonate Signaling, and the Functional Diversity of COI1 Homologs in Rice Functional Diversity of COI1 Homologs in Rice.	 Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the transcriptional changes after methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment were moderate in the leaves of oscoi2 mutants compared to those in the wild-type or oscoi1a and oscoi1b mutants
