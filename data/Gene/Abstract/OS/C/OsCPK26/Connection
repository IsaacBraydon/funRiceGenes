OIP30	OsCPK26	OIP30, a RuvB-like DNA helicase 2, is a potential substrate for the pollen-predominant OsCPK25/26 in rice	 The interaction between OsCPK26 and OIP30 was confirmed by far-Western blot and pull-down experiments| OIP30 was phosphorylated in a calcium-dependent manner by OsCPK26 but not OsCPK2, which is highly similar to OsCPK26 in sequence and expression profile| OsCPK26 phosphorylated OIP30 and enhanced both its helicase and ATPase activity about 3-fold
