OsCPK4	OsRLCK176|BML	The kinase OsCPK4 regulates a buffering mechanism that fine-tunes innate immunity.	 OsCPK4 was further identified to interact with a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176
OsCPK4	OsRLCK176|BML	The kinase OsCPK4 regulates a buffering mechanism that fine-tunes innate immunity.	 OsRLCK176 accumulation is negatively regulated by OsCPK4
OsCPK4	OsRLCK176|BML	The kinase OsCPK4 regulates a buffering mechanism that fine-tunes innate immunity.	 Interestingly, the kinase-dead OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation more strongly than the wild-type protein
OsCPK4	OsRLCK176|BML	The kinase OsCPK4 regulates a buffering mechanism that fine-tunes innate immunity.	 OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 mutually phosphorylate each other and form a feedback loop
OsCPK4	OsRLCK176|BML	The kinase OsCPK4 regulates a buffering mechanism that fine-tunes innate immunity.	 Moreover, the kinase activity and phosphorylation of OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 contribute to the stability of OsRLCK176
OsCPK4	OsRLCK176|BML	The kinase OsCPK4 regulates a buffering mechanism that fine-tunes innate immunity.	 These findings indicate that the kinase-inactive OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation and restricts plant defenses; whereas the activation of OsCPK4-OsRLCK176 phosphorylation circuit invalidates the OsRLCK176 degradation machinery and thus enhancing plant immunity
OsCPK18	OsCPK4	Fine-tuning OsCPK18/OsCPK4 activity via genome editing of phosphorylation motif improves rice yield and immunity.	 In this study, we found that OsCPK18 and its paralog OsCPK4 positively regulate plant height and yield-related traits
OsCPK18	OsCPK4	Fine-tuning OsCPK18/OsCPK4 activity via genome editing of phosphorylation motif improves rice yield and immunity.	 In vitro and inâ€‰vivo kinase assays demonstrated that OsMPK5 phosphorylates C-terminal threonine (T505) and serine (S512) residues of OsCPK18 and OsCPK4, respectively
OsCPK18	OsCPK4	Fine-tuning OsCPK18/OsCPK4 activity via genome editing of phosphorylation motif improves rice yield and immunity.	 Interestingly, editing the MAPK phosphorylation motif in OsCPK18 and its paralog OsCPK4, which deprives OsMPK5-mediated phosphorylation but retains calcium-dependent activation of kinase activity, simultaneously increases rice yields and immunity
