OsCPK4	 Here, we report that OsCPK4 expression is induced by high salinity, drought, and the phytohormone abscisic acid |  Moreover, a plasma membrane localization of OsCPK4 was observed by transient expression assays of green fluorescent protein-tagged OsCPK4 in onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells |  Overexpression of OsCPK4 in rice plants significantly enhances tolerance to salt and drought stress |  We carried out microarray analysis of transgenic rice overexpressing OsCPK4 and found that overexpression of OsCPK4 has a low impact on the rice transcriptome |  Meanwhile, OsCPK4 overexpression has no effect on the expression of well-characterized abiotic stress-associated transcriptional regulatory networks (i	 Overexpression of OsCPK4 in rice plants significantly enhances tolerance to salt and drought stress |  We carried out microarray analysis of transgenic rice overexpressing OsCPK4 and found that overexpression of OsCPK4 has a low impact on the rice transcriptome |  Meanwhile, OsCPK4 overexpression has no effect on the expression of well-characterized abiotic stress-associated transcriptional regulatory networks (i
OsCPK4	Enhancing blast disease resistance by overexpression of the calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK4 in rice. |  It shows that overexpression of OsCPK4 gene in rice plants enhances resistance to blast disease by preventing fungal penetration |  The constitutive accumulation of OsCPK4 protein prepares rice plants for a rapid and potentiated defence response, including the production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition and defence gene expression |  OsCPK4 overexpression leads also to constitutive increased content of the glycosylated salicylic acid hormone in leaves without compromising rice yield |  Given that OsCPK4 overexpression was known to confer also salt and drought tolerance in rice, the results reported in this article demonstrate that OsCPK4 acts as a convergence component that positively modulates both biotic and abiotic signalling pathways	Enhancing blast disease resistance by overexpression of the calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK4 in rice. |  It shows that overexpression of OsCPK4 gene in rice plants enhances resistance to blast disease by preventing fungal penetration |  OsCPK4 overexpression leads also to constitutive increased content of the glycosylated salicylic acid hormone in leaves without compromising rice yield |  Given that OsCPK4 overexpression was known to confer also salt and drought tolerance in rice, the results reported in this article demonstrate that OsCPK4 acts as a convergence component that positively modulates both biotic and abiotic signalling pathways
