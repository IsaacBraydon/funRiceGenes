OsCaM61	OsCBK	Calmodulin isoform-specific activation of a rice calmodulin-binding kinase conferred by only three amino-acids of OsCaM61	 It was observed that OsCaM61 stimulated OsCBK in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner| Mutational study and fluorescent spectroscopy analysis indicated that CaM-binding affinity does not correlate with the kinase activity and that these key amino-acids in OsCaM61 play a vital role in suitable changes of OsCBK conformation for kinase activation
