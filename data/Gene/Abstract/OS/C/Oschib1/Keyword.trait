Oschib1	growth	Characterization of two rice GH18 chitinases belonging to family 8 of plant pathogenesis-related proteins.	 Oschib1 and Oschiab2 inhibited the growth of Fusarium solani, but showed only a weak or no antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma viride on the agar plates
Oschib1	R protein	Characterization of two rice GH18 chitinases belonging to family 8 of plant pathogenesis-related proteins.	Two rice GH18 chitinases, Oschib1 and Oschib2, belonging to family 8 of plant pathogenesis-related proteins (PR proteins) were expressed, purified, and characterized
Oschib1	cell wall	Characterization of two rice GH18 chitinases belonging to family 8 of plant pathogenesis-related proteins.	 The class IIIb chitinases, Oschib1 and Oschib2, seem to play important roles for the effective hydrolysis of chitin oligosaccharides released from the cell wall of the pathogenic fungi by the cooperative actions with the extracellular chitinases in rice
