NA	Rice OsClo5, a caleosin protein, negatively regulates cold tolerance through the jasmonate signalling pathway.	2021	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Rice Research Institute, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.	Caleosin is a lipid droplet-binding protein involved in maintenance of the lipid droplet structure and in signal transduction. However, the role of caleosin proteins in stress resistance is limited. Here, we report data for a rice caleosin protein gene, OsClo5, involved in cold stress tolerance via influence and regulation of the JA signalling pathway. Overexpression lines and RNAi lines of OsClo5 were subjected to cold stress and recovery to measure electrolyte leakage and survival rate. Changes were also detected in the genome-wide transcriptome of OsClo5 overexpressed plants. OsClo5 is located mainly in lipid droplets and expressed in all tissues tested. Its expression was upregulated by various stress conditions when subjected to cold treatment. Overexpression of OsClo5 decreased cold tolerance, and RNAi lines of OsClo5 had higher survival than WT seedlings. OsClo5 inhibited one jasmonate biosynthetic gene and several jasmonate ZIM domain (JAZ) genes, which were upregulated in response to cold stress. OsClo5 is a constitutively expressed caleosin protein that regulates plant cold resistance through inhibition of jasmonate signalling and JA synthesis.
