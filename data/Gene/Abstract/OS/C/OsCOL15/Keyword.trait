OsCOL15	grain	The rice CONSTANS-like protein OsCOL15 suppresses flowering by promoting Ghd7 and repressing RID1.	 Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of flowering regulator gene expression suggested that OsCOL15 suppresses flowering by up-regulating the flowering repressor Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7) and down-regulating the flowering activator Rice Indeterminate 1 (RID1), thus leading to the down-regulation of the flowering activators Early heading date 1, Heading date 3a, and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1
OsCOL15	grain number	The rice CONSTANS-like protein OsCOL15 suppresses flowering by promoting Ghd7 and repressing RID1.	 Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of flowering regulator gene expression suggested that OsCOL15 suppresses flowering by up-regulating the flowering repressor Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7) and down-regulating the flowering activator Rice Indeterminate 1 (RID1), thus leading to the down-regulation of the flowering activators Early heading date 1, Heading date 3a, and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1
OsCOL15	floral	The rice CONSTANS-like protein OsCOL15 suppresses flowering by promoting Ghd7 and repressing RID1.	 We determined that OsCOL15 is most highly expressed in young organs and exhibits a diurnal expression pattern typical of other floral regulators
OsCOL15	floral	The rice CONSTANS-like protein OsCOL15 suppresses flowering by promoting Ghd7 and repressing RID1.	 These results demonstrate that OsCOL15 is an important floral regulator acting upstream of Ghd7 and RID1 in the rice photoperiodic flowering-time regulatory network
OsCOL15	nucleus	The rice CONSTANS-like protein OsCOL15 suppresses flowering by promoting Ghd7 and repressing RID1.	 Consistent with a function in transcriptional regulation, OsCOL15 localized to the nucleus
OsCOL15	height	The rice CONSTANS-like protein OsCOL15 suppresses flowering by promoting Ghd7 and repressing RID1.	 Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of flowering regulator gene expression suggested that OsCOL15 suppresses flowering by up-regulating the flowering repressor Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7) and down-regulating the flowering activator Rice Indeterminate 1 (RID1), thus leading to the down-regulation of the flowering activators Early heading date 1, Heading date 3a, and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1
OsCOL15	heading date	The rice CONSTANS-like protein OsCOL15 suppresses flowering by promoting Ghd7 and repressing RID1.	 Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of flowering regulator gene expression suggested that OsCOL15 suppresses flowering by up-regulating the flowering repressor Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7) and down-regulating the flowering activator Rice Indeterminate 1 (RID1), thus leading to the down-regulation of the flowering activators Early heading date 1, Heading date 3a, and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1
OsCOL15	plant height	The rice CONSTANS-like protein OsCOL15 suppresses flowering by promoting Ghd7 and repressing RID1.	 Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of flowering regulator gene expression suggested that OsCOL15 suppresses flowering by up-regulating the flowering repressor Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7) and down-regulating the flowering activator Rice Indeterminate 1 (RID1), thus leading to the down-regulation of the flowering activators Early heading date 1, Heading date 3a, and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1
