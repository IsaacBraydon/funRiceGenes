OsCOL15	 We determined that OsCOL15 is most highly expressed in young organs and exhibits a diurnal expression pattern typical of other floral regulators |  Overexpression of OsCOL15 resulted in a delayed flowering phenotype under both SD and LD conditions |  Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of flowering regulator gene expression suggested that OsCOL15 suppresses flowering by up-regulating the flowering repressor Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7) and down-regulating the flowering activator Rice Indeterminate 1 (RID1), thus leading to the down-regulation of the flowering activators Early heading date 1, Heading date 3a, and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1	 Overexpression of OsCOL15 resulted in a delayed flowering phenotype under both SD and LD conditions
