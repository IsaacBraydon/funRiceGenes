Ca(2+)/calmodulin transduction pathways have been implicated in mediating stress response and tolerance in plants. Here, three genes encoding calmodulin (Cam) members of the EF-hand family of Ca(2+)-binding proteins were identified from Oryza sativa L. databases. Complementary DNA for each of the calmodulin genes, OsCam1, OsCam2, and OsCam3 were sequenced. OsCam1 and OsCam2 encode a conventional 148-amino acid calmodulin protein that contains four characteristic Ca(2+)-binding motifs. OsCam3 encode a similar protein with a 38-amino-acid extension containing a putative prenylation site (CVIL) at the carboxyl terminus. RT-PCR showed that each of the genes is expressed in leaves and roots of 2-week old rice seedlings. By RNA gel blot analysis, OsCam1 mRNA levels strongly increased in response to NaCl, mannitol and wounding treatments. In contrast, OsCam2 mRNA levels were relatively unchanged under all conditions investigated. NaCl treatment and wounding also increased the OsCam3 mRNA level, but in a more transient manner. Our results indicate that although the expression of genes encoding different calmodulin isoforms is ubiquitous, they are differentially regulated by various stress signals. In addition, we have demonstrated that the calcium-channel blocker lanthanum chloride inhibited the induction of OsCam1 gene expression by both NaCl and mannitol treatments. These results suggest that osmotic stressinduced expression of OsCam1 gene requires the [Ca(2+)]cyt elevation that is known to occur in response to these stimuli.
1471-2229-7-4.pdf	Genome-wide identification and analyses of the rice calmodulin and related potential calcium sensor proteins	2007	BMC Plant Biol	Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Payathai Road, Patumwan, Bangkok 10330, Thailand. b.bongkoj@gmail.com	BACKGROUND: A wide range of stimuli evoke rapid and transient increases in [Ca2+]cyt in plant cells which are transmitted by protein sensors that contain EF-hand motifs. Here, a group of Oryza sativa L. genes encoding calmodulin (CaM) and CaM-like (CML) proteins that do not possess functional domains other than the Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs was analyzed. RESULTS: By functional analyses and BLAST searches of the TIGR rice database, a maximum number of 243 proteins that possibly have EF-hand motifs were identified in the rice genome. Using a neighbor-joining tree based on amino acid sequence similarity, five loci were defined as Cam genes and thirty two additional CML genes were identified. Extensive analyses of the gene structures, the chromosome locations, the EF-hand motif organization, expression characteristics including analysis by RT-PCR and a comparative analysis of Cam and CML genes in rice and Arabidopsis are presented. CONCLUSION: Although many proteins have unknown functions, the complexity of this gene family indicates the importance of Ca2+-signals in regulating cellular responses to stimuli and this family of proteins likely plays a critical role as their transducers.
Acta Biochim Biophys Sin-2011-Chinpongpanich-867-76.pdf	Biophysical characterization of calmodulin and calmodulin-like proteins from rice, Oryza sativa L	2011	Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)	Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.	Calmodulin (CaM) transduces the increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations by binding to and altering the activities of target proteins, thereby affecting the physiological responses to the vast array of stimuli. Here, we examined the purified recombinant proteins encoded by three Cam and eight Cam-like (CML) genes from rice. With the exception of one OsCML, all recombinant proteins could be purified by Ca(2+)-dependent hydrophobic chromatography and exhibited an electrophoretic mobility shift when incubated with Ca(2+). The three CaMs all bound CaM kinase II peptide, but none of the eight CMLs did, suggesting a possible differential target binding between the CaM and CML proteins. In addition, their conformational changes upon Ca(2+)-binding were evaluated by circular dichroism spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy using 8-Anilino-1-naphthalene-sulfonic acid. Taken together, OsCMLs were found exhibiting a spectrum of both structural and functional characteristics that ranged from typical to atypical of CaMs. From structural comparison, the OsCMLs have overall main-chain conformation nearly identical to OsCaMs, but with distinct distribution of some charged and hydrophobic amino acids on their target-binding site. These results suggest that genetic polymorphism has promoted the functional diversity of the OsCML family, whose members possess modes of actions probably different from, though maybe overlapping with, those of OsCaMs.
