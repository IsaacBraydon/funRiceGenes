The rice genome contains two ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase genes: OsCPS1 acts in gibberellin (phytohormone) biosynthesis, and OsCPS2/OsCyc2 acts in the synthesis of oryzalexins A-F and phytocassanes A-E (phytoalexins). We characterized the enzymatic properties of recombinant OsCPS2/OsCyc2 fused with a tag-protein at the N-terminus, and compared them to those of OsCPS1. Several enzymatic properties of OsCPS2/OsCyc2, including the optimal pH, optimal temperature, divalent cation requirement, and kinetic values for the geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) substrate, were almost the same as those of OsCPS1. However, OsCPS2/OsCyc2 activity was not inhibited by 50-60 muM GGDP substrate, by which the OsCPS1 activity was inhibited. Furthermore, the OsCPS1 activity exhibited approximately 70% inhibition by 100 muM Amo-1618 (a gibberellin biosynthetic inhibitor), whereas the OsCPS2/OsCyc2 activity exhibited approximately 10% inhibition. These results indicate that the properties of OsCPS2/OsCyc2 were partially different from those of OsCPS1, although OsCPS2/OsCyc2 catalyzes the same reaction step as OsCPS1.

In vitro assays using recombinant enzymes enabled three cDNAs encoding ent-copalyl diphosphate synthases to be identified in wheat (Triticum aestivum): TaCPS1, TaCPS2, and TaCPS3. The phylogenetic tree and expression analyses suggest that TaCPS3 is responsible for gibberellin biosynthesis, while TaCPS1 and TaCPS2 are possible functional homologs of diterpene cyclase genes OsCPS2 and OsCPS4 involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis in rice.

A recessive gibberellin (GA)-insensitive dwarf mutant of rice, gibberellin-insensitive dwarf1 (gid1), has been identified, which shows a severe dwarf phenotype and contains high concentrations of endogenous GA. To elucidate the function of gid1, proteins regulated downstream of gid1 were analysed using a proteomic approach. Proteins extracted from suspension-cultured cells of gid1 and its wild type were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). Of a total of 962 proteins identified from the suspension-cultured cells, 16 were increased and 14 were decreased in gid1 compared with its wild type. Among the proteins hyper-accumulated in gid1 were osmotin, triosephosphate isomerase, probenazole inducible protein (PBZ1) and pathogenesis-related protein 10. Of these four genes, only the expression of PBZ1 was increased by exogenous GA3 application. Expression of this gene was also enhanced in shoots of the wild type by cold stress or by rice blast fungus infection. Under normal growth conditions, there was more PBZ1 protein in gid1 than in the wild type. In addition, gid1 showed increased tolerance to cold stress and resistance to blast fungus infection. The entcopalyl diphosphate synthase (OsCPS) genes, which encode enzymes at the branch point between GA and phytoalexin biosynthesis, were expressed differentially in gid1 relative to the wild type. Specifically, OsCPS1, which encodes an enzyme in the GA biosynthesis pathway, was down-regulated and OsCPS2 and OsCPS4, which encode enzymes in phytoalexin biosynthesis, were up-regulated in gid1. These results suggest that the expression of PBZ1 is regulated by GA signalling and stress stimuli, and that gid1 is involved in tolerance to cold stress and resistance to blast fungus.
j.1365-313X.2004.02175.x.pdf	Biological functions of ent- and syn-copalyl diphosphate synthases in rice: key enzymes for the branch point of gibberellin and phytoalexin biosynthesis	2004	Plant J	Course of the Science of Bioresources, The United Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Iwate University (Yamagata University), Tsuruoka, Yamagata 997-8555, Japan.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) produces ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CDP) and syn-CDP as precursors for several classes of phytoalexins and the phytohormones, gibberellins (GAs). It has recently been shown that a loss-of-function mutation of OsCPS1, a gene encoding a putative ent-CDP synthase, results in a severely GA-deficient dwarf phenotype in rice. To clarify the biological functions of the ent- and syn-CDP synthases involved in the biosynthesis of phytoalexins and/or GAs, we isolated two cDNAs, OsCyc1 and OsCyc2, encoding putative diterpene cyclases from ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated rice leaves (cv. Nipponbare). The production of phytoalexins in rice leaves is known to be highly induced by UV treatment. Using a bacterial expression system, we demonstrated that OsCyc1 encodes syn-CDP synthase and that OsCyc2 and OsCPS1 encode ent-CDP synthase. The level of expression of the OsCyc1 and OsCyc2 transcripts in rice leaves increased drastically in response to UV treatment, whereas expression of the OsCPS1 transcript was not induced by UV light. These results suggest that OsCyc1, OsCyc2 and OsCPS1 are responsible for the biosynthesis of momilactones A and B and oryzalexin S, oryzalexins A-F and phytocassanes A-E, and GAs, respectively. Our results strongly suggest the presence of two ent-CDP synthase isoforms in rice, one that participates in the biosynthesis of GAs and a second that is involved in the biosynthesis of phytoalexins.
NA	Transcripts of two ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase genes differentially localize in rice plants according to their distinct biological roles	2014	J Exp Bot	Department of Bioresource Engineering, Yamagata University, Yamagata 997-8555, Japan	Gibberellins (GAs) are diterpenoid phytohormones that regulate various aspects of plant growth. Tetracyclic hydrocarbon ent-kaurene is a biosynthetic intermediate of GAs, and is converted from geranylgeranyl diphosphate, a common precursor of diterpenoids, via ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CDP) through successive cyclization reactions catalysed by two distinct diterpene synthases, ent-CDP synthase and ent-kaurene synthase. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) has two ent-CDP synthase genes, OsCPS1 and OsCPS2. It has been thought that OsCPS1 participates in GA biosynthesis, while OsCPS2 participates in the biosynthesis of phytoalexins, phytocassanes A-E, and oryzalexins A-F. It has been shown previously that loss-of-function OsCPS1 mutants display a severe dwarf phenotype caused by GA deficiency despite possessing another ent-CDP synthase gene, OsCPS2. Here, experiments were performed to account for the non-redundant biological function of OsCPS1 and OsCPS2. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that OsCPS2 transcript levels were drastically lower than those of OsCPS1 in the basal parts, including the meristem of the second-leaf sheaths of rice seedlings. qRT-PCR results using tissue samples prepared by laser microdissection suggested that OsCPS1 transcripts mainly localized in vascular bundle tissues, similar to Arabidopsis CPS, which is responsible for GA biosynthesis, whereas OsCPS2 transcripts mainly localized in epidermal cells that address environmental stressors such as pathogen attack. Furthermore, the OsCPS2 transgene under regulation of the OsCPS1 promoter complemented the dwarf phenotype of an OsCPS1 mutant, oscps1-1. The results indicate that transcripts of the two ent-CDP synthase genes differentially localize in rice plants according to their distinct biological roles, OsCPS1 for growth and OsCPS2 for defence.
