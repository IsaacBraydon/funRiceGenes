OsCPS2|OsCyc2	temperature	Comparison of the Enzymatic Properties ofent-Copalyl Diphosphate Synthases in the Biosynthesis of Phytoalexins and Gibberellins in Rice	" Several enzymatic properties of OsCPS2/OsCyc2, including the optimal pH, optimal temperature, divalent cation requirement, and kinetic values for the geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) substrate, were almost the same as those of OsCPS1"
OsCPS2|OsCyc2	 ga 	gid1, a gibberellin-insensitive dwarf mutant, shows altered regulation of probenazole-inducible protein (PBZ1) in response to cold stress and pathogen attack	 Specifically, OsCPS1, which encodes an enzyme in the GA biosynthesis pathway, was down-regulated and OsCPS2 and OsCPS4, which encode enzymes in phytoalexin biosynthesis, were up-regulated in gid1
OsCPS2|OsCyc2	gibberellin	Comparison of the Enzymatic Properties ofent-Copalyl Diphosphate Synthases in the Biosynthesis of Phytoalexins and Gibberellins in Rice	The rice genome contains two ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase genes: OsCPS1 acts in gibberellin (phytohormone) biosynthesis, and OsCPS2/OsCyc2 acts in the synthesis of oryzalexins A-F and phytocassanes A-E (phytoalexins)| Furthermore, the OsCPS1 activity exhibited approximately 70% inhibition by 100 muM Amo-1618 (a gibberellin biosynthetic inhibitor), whereas the OsCPS2/OsCyc2 activity exhibited approximately 10% inhibition
OsCPS2|OsCyc2	phytohormone	Comparison of the Enzymatic Properties ofent-Copalyl Diphosphate Synthases in the Biosynthesis of Phytoalexins and Gibberellins in Rice	The rice genome contains two ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase genes: OsCPS1 acts in gibberellin (phytohormone) biosynthesis, and OsCPS2/OsCyc2 acts in the synthesis of oryzalexins A-F and phytocassanes A-E (phytoalexins)
OsCPS2|OsCyc2	gibberellin	Cloning and Characterization of cDNAs Encodingent-Copalyl Diphosphate Synthases in Wheat: Insight into the Evolution of Rice Phytoalexin Biosynthetic Genes	 The phylogenetic tree and expression analyses suggest that TaCPS3 is responsible for gibberellin biosynthesis, while TaCPS1 and TaCPS2 are possible functional homologs of diterpene cyclase genes OsCPS2 and OsCPS4 involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis in rice
