OsCUC3	stamen	The osa-miR164 target OsCUC1 functions redundantly with OsCUC3 in controlling rice meristem/organ boundary specification	 A single mutation in either OsCUC1 or OsCUC3 leads to defects in the establishment of the meristem/organ boundary, resulting in reduced stamen numbers and the fusion of leaves and filaments, and the defects are greatly enhanced in the double mutant
