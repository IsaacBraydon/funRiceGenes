OsCUC3	stamen	The osa-miR164 target OsCUC1 functions redundantly with OsCUC3 in controlling rice meristem/organ boundary specification	 A single mutation in either OsCUC1 or OsCUC3 leads to defects in the establishment of the meristem/organ boundary, resulting in reduced stamen numbers and the fusion of leaves and filaments, and the defects are greatly enhanced in the double mutant
OsCUC3	stamen number	The osa-miR164 target OsCUC1 functions redundantly with OsCUC3 in controlling rice meristem/organ boundary specification	 A single mutation in either OsCUC1 or OsCUC3 leads to defects in the establishment of the meristem/organ boundary, resulting in reduced stamen numbers and the fusion of leaves and filaments, and the defects are greatly enhanced in the double mutant
OsCUC3	leaf	OsmiR164-targeted OsNAM, a boundary gene, plays important roles in rice leaf and panicle development	 The osnam oscuc3 double mutant, however, resulted in severe leaf fusion of the first two leaves, while the osnam single mutant showed a similar phenotype from the seventh leaf
OsCUC3	development	OsmiR164-targeted OsNAM, a boundary gene, plays important roles in rice leaf and panicle development	 Loss-of-function mutants for OsCUC3 resulted in no obvious defects throughout the development of the rice
OsCUC3	development	OsmiR164-targeted OsNAM, a boundary gene, plays important roles in rice leaf and panicle development	 The results indicated that OsNAM and OsCUC3 act redundantly for boundary specification during postembryonic development
OsCUC3	development	OsmiR164-targeted OsNAM, a boundary gene, plays important roles in rice leaf and panicle development	 Overall, we have described the biological functions of OsNAM and OsCUC3 in rice development and the expression characteristics of OsNAM
