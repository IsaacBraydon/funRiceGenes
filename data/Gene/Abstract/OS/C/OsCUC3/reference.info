NA	The osa-miR164 target OsCUC1 functions redundantly with OsCUC3 in controlling rice meristem/organ boundary specification	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530005, China.	The specification of the meristem/organ boundary is critical for plant development. Here, we investigate two previously uncharacterized NAC transcription factors: the first, OsCUC1, which is negatively regulated by osa-miR164c, dimerizes with the second, OsCUC3, and functions partially redundantly in meristem/organ boundary specification in rice (Oryza sativa). We produced knockout lines for rice OsCUC1 (the homolog of Arabidopsis CUC1 and CUC2) and OsCUC3 (the homolog of Arabidopsis CUC3), as well as an overexpression line for osa-miR164c, to study the molecular mechanism of boundary specification in rice. A single mutation in either OsCUC1 or OsCUC3 leads to defects in the establishment of the meristem/organ boundary, resulting in reduced stamen numbers and the fusion of leaves and filaments, and the defects are greatly enhanced in the double mutant. Transgenic plants overexpressing osa-miR164c showed a phenotype similar to that of the OsCUC1 knockout line. In addition, knockout of OsCUC1 leads to multiple defects, including dwarf plant architecture, male sterility and twisted-rolling leaves. Further study indicated that OsCUC1 physically interacts with leaf-rolling related protein CURLED LEAF AND DWARF 1 (CLD1) and stabilizes it in the nucleus to control leaf morphology. This work demonstrated that the interplay of osa-miR164c, OsCUC1 and OsCUC3 controls boundary specification in rice.
NA	OsmiR164-targeted OsNAM, a boundary gene, plays important roles in rice leaf and panicle development	2020	Plant J	College of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, People's Republic of China.	The CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON (CUC) genes (CUC1, CUC2, and CUC3) regulate organ boundary formation in Arabidopsis. However, the functions of their homologous genes in rice (Oryza sativa) are still unknown. Here, we have identified an orthologous gene of CUC1 and CUC2 in rice named OsNAM. Subcellular localization and yeast two-hybrid assay results have suggested that OsNAM encodes a conserved nuclear NAC (NAM/ATAF1/CUC2) protein with a transcriptional activator. The null mutant osnam-1 presented a fused leaf structure, small panicles, reduced branches, and aberrant floral organ identities when compared with those of the wild type. GUS staining and GFP reporter lines indicated that OsNAM was expressed in young tissues and that its boundary enrichment expression was regulated by OsmiR164. Loss-of-function mutants for OsCUC3 resulted in no obvious defects throughout the development of the rice. The osnam oscuc3 double mutant, however, resulted in severe leaf fusion of the first two leaves, while the osnam single mutant showed a similar phenotype from the seventh leaf. The results indicated that OsNAM and OsCUC3 act redundantly for boundary specification during postembryonic development. Overall, we have described the biological functions of OsNAM and OsCUC3 in rice development and the expression characteristics of OsNAM. This work reveals the important role of CUC genes in rice.
