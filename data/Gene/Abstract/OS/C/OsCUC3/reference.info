NA	The osa-miR164 target OsCUC1 functions redundantly with OsCUC3 in controlling rice meristem/organ boundary specification	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530005, China.	The specification of the meristem/organ boundary is critical for plant development. Here, we investigate two previously uncharacterized NAC transcription factors: the first, OsCUC1, which is negatively regulated by osa-miR164c, dimerizes with the second, OsCUC3, and functions partially redundantly in meristem/organ boundary specification in rice (Oryza sativa). We produced knockout lines for rice OsCUC1 (the homolog of Arabidopsis CUC1 and CUC2) and OsCUC3 (the homolog of Arabidopsis CUC3), as well as an overexpression line for osa-miR164c, to study the molecular mechanism of boundary specification in rice. A single mutation in either OsCUC1 or OsCUC3 leads to defects in the establishment of the meristem/organ boundary, resulting in reduced stamen numbers and the fusion of leaves and filaments, and the defects are greatly enhanced in the double mutant. Transgenic plants overexpressing osa-miR164c showed a phenotype similar to that of the OsCUC1 knockout line. In addition, knockout of OsCUC1 leads to multiple defects, including dwarf plant architecture, male sterility and twisted-rolling leaves. Further study indicated that OsCUC1 physically interacts with leaf-rolling related protein CURLED LEAF AND DWARF 1 (CLD1) and stabilizes it in the nucleus to control leaf morphology. This work demonstrated that the interplay of osa-miR164c, OsCUC1 and OsCUC3 controls boundary specification in rice.
