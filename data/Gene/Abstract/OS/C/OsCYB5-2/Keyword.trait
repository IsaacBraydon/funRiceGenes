OsCYB5-2	seedlings	An endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b (5) regulates high-affinity K(+) transport in response to salt stress in rice.	 Finally, overexpression of OsCYB5-2 increased OsHAK21-mediated K(+) transport and improved salt tolerance in rice seedlings
OsCYB5-2	salt	An endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b (5) regulates high-affinity K(+) transport in response to salt stress in rice.	 Finally, overexpression of OsCYB5-2 increased OsHAK21-mediated K(+) transport and improved salt tolerance in rice seedlings
OsCYB5-2	tolerance	An endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b (5) regulates high-affinity K(+) transport in response to salt stress in rice.	 Finally, overexpression of OsCYB5-2 increased OsHAK21-mediated K(+) transport and improved salt tolerance in rice seedlings
OsCYB5-2	transporter	An endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b (5) regulates high-affinity K(+) transport in response to salt stress in rice.	 The association of OsCYB5-2 with the OsHAK21 transporter caused an increase in transporter activity by enhancing the apparent affinity for K(+)-binding but not Na(+)-binding
OsCYB5-2	salt tolerance	An endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b (5) regulates high-affinity K(+) transport in response to salt stress in rice.	 Finally, overexpression of OsCYB5-2 increased OsHAK21-mediated K(+) transport and improved salt tolerance in rice seedlings
