OsCYB5-2	OsHAK21|qSE3	An endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b (5) regulates high-affinity K(+) transport in response to salt stress in rice.	 In this study, we identified an endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b (5) (OsCYB5-2) that interacted with a high-affinity K(+) transporter (OsHAK21) at the plasma membrane
OsCYB5-2	OsHAK21|qSE3	An endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b (5) regulates high-affinity K(+) transport in response to salt stress in rice.	 The association of OsCYB5-2 with the OsHAK21 transporter caused an increase in transporter activity by enhancing the apparent affinity for K(+)-binding but not Na(+)-binding
OsCYB5-2	OsHAK21|qSE3	An endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b (5) regulates high-affinity K(+) transport in response to salt stress in rice.	 Heme binding to OsCYB5-2 was essential for the regulation of OsHAK21
