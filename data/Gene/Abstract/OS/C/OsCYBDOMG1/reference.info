OsCYBDOMG1 positively regulates salt tolerance, plant growth, and grain yield by affecting ascorbate biosynthesis and redox state. Soil salinity is a major abiotic stress affecting rice growth and productivity. Many genes involved in the salt stress response have been identified, but the precise mechanisms underlying salt tolerance remain unclear. In this study, we isolated a salt-sensitive mutant of rice, rss5, which exhibited more severe wilting and chlorosis with a significant increase in lipid peroxidation, electrolyte leakage, and shoot Na(+) concentration compared to wild-type plants. Map-based cloning, MutMap analysis, and genetic complementation revealed that a single-nucleotide mutation in a gene encoding a cytochrome b561 domain-containing protein (OsCYBDOMG1) was responsible for the mutant phenotype of rss5. The OsCYBDOMG1 gene was mainly expressed in young shoots and nodes, and the encoded protein was principally located in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations of OsCYBDOMG1 resulted in decreased ascorbic acid (AsA) content and AsA/DHA (dehydroascorbate) ratio, which led to increased H(2)O(2) accumulation and reduced salt tolerance. Moreover, plant growth and grain yield of rss5 and the OsCYBDOMG1 knockout mutant (cr-1) were significantly decreased compared to wild-type plants under normal conditions. The elite haplotype of OsCYBDOMG1 associated with higher salt tolerance and grain width and weight was mainly existed in japonica varieties. These results suggest that OsCYBDOMG1 plays an important role in the regulation of salt tolerance, plant growth, and grain yield in rice.
