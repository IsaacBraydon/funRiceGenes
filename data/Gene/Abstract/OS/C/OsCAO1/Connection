OsCAO1|PGL	OsCAO2	Differential regulation of chlorophyll a oxygenase genes in rice	We have identified two genes (OsCAO1 and OsCAO2) from the rice genome that are highly homologous to previously studied chlorophyll a oxygenase (CAO) genes
OsCAO1|PGL	OsCAO2	Differential regulation of chlorophyll a oxygenase genes in rice	These results suggest that OsCAO1 plays a major role in chlorophyll b biosynthesis, and that OsCAO2 may function in the dark
OsCAO1|PGL	OsPIL13|OsPIL1	Rice Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like1 (OsPIL1) is involved in the promotion of chlorophyll biosynthesis through feed-forward regulatory loops.	 Using promoter binding and transactivation assays, we found that OsPIL1 binds to the promoters of two Chl biosynthetic genes, OsPORB and OsCAO1, and promotes their transcription
OsCAO1|PGL	OsPIL13|OsPIL1	Rice Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like1 (OsPIL1) is involved in the promotion of chlorophyll biosynthesis through feed-forward regulatory loops.	 Thus, OsPIL1 is involved in the promotion of Chl biosynthesis by up-regulating the transcription of OsPORB and OsCAO1 via trifurcate feed-forward regulatory loops involving two OsGLKs
