Chlorophyll b is synthesized from chlorophyll a by chlorophyll a oxygenase. We have identified two genes (OsCAO1 and OsCAO2) from the rice genome that are highly homologous to previously studied chlorophyll a oxygenase (CAO) genes. They are positioned in tandem, probably resulting from recent gene duplications. The proteins they encode contain two conserved functional motifs - the Rieske Fe-sulfur coordinating center and a non-heme mononuclear Fe-binding site. OsCAO1 is induced by light and is preferentially expressed in photosynthetic tissues. Its mRNA level decreases when plants are grown in the dark. In contrast, OsCAO2 mRNA levels are higher under dark conditions, and its expression is down-regulated by exposure to light. To elucidate the physiological function of the CAO genes, we have isolated knockout mutant lines tagged by T-DNA or Tos17. Mutant plants containing a T-DNA insertion in the first intron of the OsCAO1 gene have pale green leaves, indicating chlorophyll b deficiency. We have also isolated a pale green mutant with a Tos17 insertion in that OsCAO1 gene. In contrast, OsCAO2 knockout mutant leaves do not differ significantly from the wild type. These results suggest that OsCAO1 plays a major role in chlorophyll b biosynthesis, and that OsCAO2 may function in the dark.
NA	PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory for Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, Zhejiang, China Key Laboratory of Crop Physiology, Ecology and Genetic Breeding, Ministry of Education, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, China.	Chlorophyll (Chl) b is a ubiquitous accessory pigment in land plants, green algae, and prochlorophytes. This pigment is synthesized from Chl a by chlorophyllide a oxygenase and plays a key role in adaptation to various environments. This study characterizes a rice mutant, pale green leaf (pgl), and isolates the gene PGL by using a map-based cloning approach. PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, is mainly expressed in the chlorenchyma and activated in the light-dependent Chl synthesis process. Compared with wild-type plants, pgl exhibits a lower Chl content with a reduced and disorderly thylakoid ultrastructure, which decreases the photosynthesis rate and results in reduced grain yield and quality. In addition, pgl exhibits premature senescence in both natural and dark-induced conditions and more severe Chl degradation and reactive oxygen species accumulation than does the wild-type. Moreover, pgl is sensitive to heat stress.
NA	Transcriptomic and physiological analysis of OsCAO1 knockout lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in rice	2020	Plant Cell Rep	Division of Horticultural Biotechnology, Hankyong National University, Anseong, 17579, South Korea.	The altered rice leaf color based on the knockout of CAO1 gene generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology plays important roles in chlorophyll degradation and ROS scavenging to regulate both natural and induced senescence in rice. Rice chlorophyllide a oxygenase (OsCAO1), identified as the chlorophyll b synthesis under light condition, plays a critical role in regulating rice plant photosynthesis. In this study, the development of edited lines with pale green leaves by knockout of OsCAO1 gene known as a chlorophyll synthesis process is reported. Eighty-one genetically edited lines out of 181 T0 plants were generated through CRISPR/Cas9 system. The edited lines have short narrow flag leaves and pale green leaves compared with wild-type 'Dongjin' plants (WT). Additionally, edited lines have lower chlorophyll b and carotenoid contents both at seedling and mature stages. A transcriptome analysis identified 580 up-regulated and 206 downregulated genes in the edited lines. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis, magnesium chelatase subunit (CHLH), and glutamate-1-semialdehyde2, 1-aminomutase (GSA) metabolism decreased significantly. Meanwhile, the gel consistency (GC) levels of rice grains, chalkiness ratios and chalkiness degrees (CD) decreased in the edited lines. Thus, knockout of OsCAO1 influenced growth period, leaf development and grain quality characters of rice. Overall, the result suggests that OsCAO1 also plays important roles in chlorophyll degradation and ROS scavenging to regulate both natural and induced rice senescence.
