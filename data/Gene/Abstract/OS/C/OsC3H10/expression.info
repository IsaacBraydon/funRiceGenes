OsC3H10	Overexpression of OsC3H10, a CCCH-Zinc Finger, Improves Drought Tolerance in Rice by Regulating Stress-Related Genes |  OsC3H10 is predominantly expressed in seeds, and its expression levels rapidly declined during seed imbibition |  The expression of OsC3H10 was induced by drought, high salinity and abscisic acid (ABA) |  Root-specific overexpression of OsC3H10 was insufficient to induce drought tolerance, while the overexpression of OsC3H10 throughout the entire plant enhanced the drought tolerance of rice plants |  Transcriptome analysis revealed that OsC3H10 overexpression elevated the expression levels of genes involved in stress responses, including LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT PROTEINs (LEAs), PATHOGENESIS RELATED GENEs (PRs) and GERMIN-LIKE PROTEINs (GLPs) |  Our results demonstrated that OsC3H10 is involved in the regulation of the drought tolerance pathway by modulating the expression of stress-related genes	Overexpression of OsC3H10, a CCCH-Zinc Finger, Improves Drought Tolerance in Rice by Regulating Stress-Related Genes |  Root-specific overexpression of OsC3H10 was insufficient to induce drought tolerance, while the overexpression of OsC3H10 throughout the entire plant enhanced the drought tolerance of rice plants |  Transcriptome analysis revealed that OsC3H10 overexpression elevated the expression levels of genes involved in stress responses, including LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT PROTEINs (LEAs), PATHOGENESIS RELATED GENEs (PRs) and GERMIN-LIKE PROTEINs (GLPs)
