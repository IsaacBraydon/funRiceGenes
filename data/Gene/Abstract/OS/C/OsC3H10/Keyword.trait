OsC3H10	seed	Overexpression of OsC3H10, a CCCH-Zinc Finger, Improves Drought Tolerance in Rice by Regulating Stress-Related Genes	 OsC3H10 is predominantly expressed in seeds, and its expression levels rapidly declined during seed imbibition
OsC3H10	drought	Overexpression of OsC3H10, a CCCH-Zinc Finger, Improves Drought Tolerance in Rice by Regulating Stress-Related Genes	 Root-specific overexpression of OsC3H10 was insufficient to induce drought tolerance, while the overexpression of OsC3H10 throughout the entire plant enhanced the drought tolerance of rice plants
OsC3H10	drought	Overexpression of OsC3H10, a CCCH-Zinc Finger, Improves Drought Tolerance in Rice by Regulating Stress-Related Genes	 Our results demonstrated that OsC3H10 is involved in the regulation of the drought tolerance pathway by modulating the expression of stress-related genes
OsC3H10	salinity	Overexpression of OsC3H10, a CCCH-Zinc Finger, Improves Drought Tolerance in Rice by Regulating Stress-Related Genes	 The expression of OsC3H10 was induced by drought, high salinity and abscisic acid (ABA)
OsC3H10	tolerance	Overexpression of OsC3H10, a CCCH-Zinc Finger, Improves Drought Tolerance in Rice by Regulating Stress-Related Genes	 Root-specific overexpression of OsC3H10 was insufficient to induce drought tolerance, while the overexpression of OsC3H10 throughout the entire plant enhanced the drought tolerance of rice plants
OsC3H10	tolerance	Overexpression of OsC3H10, a CCCH-Zinc Finger, Improves Drought Tolerance in Rice by Regulating Stress-Related Genes	 Our results demonstrated that OsC3H10 is involved in the regulation of the drought tolerance pathway by modulating the expression of stress-related genes
