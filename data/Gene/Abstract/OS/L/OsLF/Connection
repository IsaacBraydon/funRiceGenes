Hd1	OsLF	An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15	Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and Hd1 by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 and thus induce late flowering

OsLF	OsPIL15	An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15	Yeast two hybrid and colocalization assays revealed that OsLF interacts strongly with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 that are potentially involved in light signaling
OsLF	OsPIL15	An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15	Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and Hd1 by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 and thus induce late flowering

LC2|OsVIL3	OsLF	LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF	Interestingly, LC2 binds to the promoter region of a floral repressor OsLF and represses the OsLF expression via H3K27 tri-methylation modification
