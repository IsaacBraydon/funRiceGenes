OsLF	floral	LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF	 Interestingly, LC2 binds to the promoter region of a floral repressor OsLF and represses the OsLF expression via H3K27 tri-methylation modification
OsLF	flower	An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15	 In this study, we isolated the OsLF gene by its association with the T-DNA insertion in the rice late flowering mutant named A654| Overexpression of the OsLF gene in wild type rice recapitulated the late flowering phenotype of A654, indicating that the OsLF gene negatively regulates flowering| Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and Hd1 by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 and thus induce late flowering|An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15
