OsLP1	tolerance	Genetic architecture of seed glycerolipids in Asian cultivated rice.	 Further evidence demonstrated that OsLP1 also affects heading date, and that co-selection of OsLP1 and a flooding-tolerant QTL in Aus results in the abundance of saturated TAGs associated with flooding tolerance
OsLP1	heading date	Genetic architecture of seed glycerolipids in Asian cultivated rice.	 Further evidence demonstrated that OsLP1 also affects heading date, and that co-selection of OsLP1 and a flooding-tolerant QTL in Aus results in the abundance of saturated TAGs associated with flooding tolerance
OsLP1	flooding	Genetic architecture of seed glycerolipids in Asian cultivated rice.	 Further evidence demonstrated that OsLP1 also affects heading date, and that co-selection of OsLP1 and a flooding-tolerant QTL in Aus results in the abundance of saturated TAGs associated with flooding tolerance
