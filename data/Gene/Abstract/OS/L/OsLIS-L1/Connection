FON2|FON4|TG1	OsTPL|ASP1|OsLIS-L1	Transcriptional corepressor ASP1 and CLV-like signaling regulate meristem maintenance in rice.	 In this study, through genetic enhancer analysis, we found that loss of function of ABERRANT SPIKELET AND PANICLE1 (ASP1), encoding an Arabidopsis TOPLESS (TPL)-like transcriptional corepressor, enhances the fon2 flower phenotype, which displayed an increase in floral organ number
FON2|FON4|TG1	OsTPL|ASP1|OsLIS-L1	Transcriptional corepressor ASP1 and CLV-like signaling regulate meristem maintenance in rice.	 In the fon2 asp1 double mutant, the inflorescence was severely affected, resulting in bifurcation of the main axis (rachis), a phenotype that has not previously been reported
FON2|FON4|TG1	OsTPL|ASP1|OsLIS-L1	Transcriptional corepressor ASP1 and CLV-like signaling regulate meristem maintenance in rice.	 The stem cells showed marked overproliferation in fon2 asp1, resulting in extreme enlargement and splitting of the inflorescence meristem
FON2|FON4|TG1	OsTPL|ASP1|OsLIS-L1	Transcriptional corepressor ASP1 and CLV-like signaling regulate meristem maintenance in rice.	 These results suggest that ASP1 and FON2 synergistically regulate stem cell maintenance in rice
FON2|FON4|TG1	OsTPL|ASP1|OsLIS-L1	Transcriptional corepressor ASP1 and CLV-like signaling regulate meristem maintenance in rice.	 Taken together, our results suggest that TPL-like corepressor activity plays a crucial role in meristem maintenance, and that stem cell proliferation is properly maintained via the cooperation of ASP1 and FON2
MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	OsTPL|ASP1|OsLIS-L1	TILLERS ABSENT1, the WUSCHEL ortholog, is not involved in stem cell maintenance in the shoot apical meristem in rice.	 Recently, we showed that a double mutant of FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) and ABERRANT SPIKELET AND PANICLE1 (ASP1) led to a marked enlargement of the inflorescence meristem, and that the TAB1 function is not associated with massive stem cells in this meristem
MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	OsTPL|ASP1|OsLIS-L1	TILLERS ABSENT1, the WUSCHEL ortholog, is not involved in stem cell maintenance in the shoot apical meristem in rice.	 In this paper, we confirmed that TAB1 is also unrelated to the enlargement of the SAM in the vegetative phase of the fon2 and fon2 asp1 mutants
