Although a large number of genes encoding the WD40 motif have been identified as being involved in various developmental processes in Arabidopsis, little is known about the function of these genes in rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we report the cloning and functional characterization of a novel rice gene OsLIS-L1 (Lissencephaly type-1-like 1), which is required for normal fertility and the first internode elongation. OsLIS-L1 encodes a lissencephaly type-1-like protein containing the WD40 motif that is required for brain development in human. SMART algorithm analysis indicated that OsLIS-L1 contains a LIS1 homology (LisH) domain, a C terminus to LisH (CTLH) domain, a five WD40-repeat domain in the middle, and a domain with four WD40 repeats which is homologous to the beta subunit of trimeric G-proteins (G(beta)). OsLIS-L1 transcript is relatively highly abundant in stem and panicle and has a dynamic expression pattern at different panicle developmental stages. Two independent alleles, designated oslis-l1-1 and oslis-l1-2, exhibited similar abnormal developmental phenotypes, including semi-dwarf, shorter panicle length, and reduced male fertility. Cytological examination confirmed that OsLIS-L1 does not affect the meiosis in pollen mother cells. Compared with wild type, the oslis-l1 mutant had abnormal male gametophyte formation, but anther cell wall and pollen wall development were not affected. Histological analysis revealed that OsLIS-L1 regulates the cell proliferation in the first internode under the panicle. Our results indicate that OsLIS-L1 plays an important role in male gametophyte formation and the first internode elongation in rice.
j.1365-313X.2011.04872.x.pdf	Aberrant spikelet and panicle1, encoding a TOPLESS-related transcriptional co-repressor, is involved in the regulation of meristem fate in rice	2012	Plant J	Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Post-embryonic development depends on the activity of meristems in plants, and thus control of cell fate in the meristem is crucial to plant development and its architecture. In grasses such as rice and maize, the fate of reproductive meristems changes from indeterminate meristems, such as inflorescence and branch meristems, to determinate meristems, such as the spikelet meristem. Here we analyzed a recessive mutant of rice, aberrant spikelet and panicle1 (asp1), that showed pleiotropic phenotypes such as a disorganized branching pattern, aberrant spikelet morphology, and disarrangement of phyllotaxy. Close examination revealed that regulation of meristem fate was compromised in asp1: degeneration of the inflorescence meristem was delayed, transition from the branch meristem to the spikelet meristem was accelerated, and stem cell maintenance in both the branch meristem and the spikelet meristem was compromised. The genetic program was also disturbed in terms of spikelet development. Gene isolation revealed that ASP1 encodes a transcriptional co-repressor that is related to TOPLESS (TPL) in Arabidopsis and RAMOSA ENHANCER LOCUS2 (REL2) in maize. It is likely that the pleiotropic defects are associated with de-repression of multiple genes related to meristem function in the asp1 mutant. The asp1 mutant also showed de-repression of axillary bud growth and disturbed phyllotaxy in the vegetative phase, suggesting that the function of this gene is closely associated with auxin action. Consistent with these observations and the molecular function of Arabidopsis TPL, auxin signaling was also compromised in the rice asp1 mutant. Taken together, these results indicate that ASP1 regulates various aspects of developmental processes and physiological responses as a transcriptional co-repressor in rice.
