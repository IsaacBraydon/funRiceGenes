NA	Oryza sativa LIGULELESS 2s determine lamina joint positioning and differentiation by inhibiting auxin signaling	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Wheat and Maize Crop Science, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 450002, China.	The lamina joint (LJ) is a grass-specific organ that connects the leaf blade to the sheath and causes the leaf blade to bend away from the vertical axis. The angle between the leaf blade and the vertical axis is termed as the leaf angle. The leaf angle determined by the LJ in cereal crops affects light capture, particularly under conditions of high-density planting, and therefore is an important trait for high yields (Sakamoto et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2019). The LJ is a highly plastic organ that determines leaf angle dynamics and optimizes light capture in response to developmental stages, internal cues, and the changing environments (Asahina et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2015; Qiao et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017; Ruan et al., 2018). The structure of LJ varies among different grass species. In rice (Oryza sativa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), the LJ consists of the collar (mechanical hinge), the ligule (a thin and tongue-like white membrane), and a pair of auricles (hairy and sickle-shaped tissue) (Hoshikawa, 1989; Liu et al., 2019); by contrast, the maize (Zea mays) LJ consists of the ligule, the midrib, and a pair of auricles (thickened tissues that connect blade and sheath) (Kong et al., 2017).
