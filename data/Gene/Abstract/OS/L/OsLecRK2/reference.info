NA	A gene cluster encoding lectin receptor kinases confers broad-spectrum and durable insect resistance in rice	2014	Nature Biotechnology	National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	The brown planthopper (BPH) is the most destructive pest of rice (Oryza sativa) and a substantial threat to rice production, causing losses of billions of dollars annually1, 2. Breeding of resistant cultivars is currently hampered by the rapid breakdown of BPH resistance2. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify more effective BPH-resistance genes. Here, we report molecular cloning and characterization of Bph3, a locus in rice identified more than 30 years ago that confers resistance to BPH. We show that Bph3 is a cluster of three genes encoding plasma membrane¨Clocalized lectin receptor kinases (OsLecRK1-OsLecRK3). Introgression of Bph3 into susceptible rice varieties by transgenic or marker-assisted selection strategies significantly enhanced resistance to both the BPH and the white back planthopper. Our results suggest that these lectin receptor kinase genes function together to confer broad-spectrum and durable insect resistance and provide a resource for molecular breeding of insect-resistant rice cultivars.
