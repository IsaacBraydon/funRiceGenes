OslecRK	seed germination	A rice lectin receptor-like kinase that is involved in innate immune responses also contributes to seed germination	 Here, we show that the rice lectin receptor-like kinase OslecRK contributes to both seed germination and plant innate immunity| We demonstrate that knocking down the OslecRK gene depresses the expression of α–amylase genes, reducing seed viability and thereby decreasing the rate of seed germination
