OslecRK|OsLecRK1	seed germination	A rice lectin receptor-like kinase that is involved in innate immune responses also contributes to seed germination	Here, we show that the rice lectin receptor-like kinase OslecRK contributes to both seed germination and plant innate immunity
OslecRK|OsLecRK1	seed germination	A rice lectin receptor-like kinase that is involved in innate immune responses also contributes to seed germination	We demonstrate that knocking down the OslecRK gene depresses the expression of α–amylase genes, reducing seed viability and thereby decreasing the rate of seed germination
