tpj12328.pdf	A rice lectin receptor-like kinase that is involved in innate immune responses also contributes to seed germination	2013	The Plant Journal	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China	Seed germination and innate immunity both have significant effects on plant life spans because they control the plant's entry into the ecosystem and provide defenses against various external stresses, respectively. Much ecological evidence has shown that seeds with high vigor are generally more tolerant of various environmental stimuli in the field than those with low vigor. However, there is little genetic evidence linking germination and immunity in plants. Here, we show that the rice lectin receptor-like kinase OslecRK contributes to both seed germination and plant innate immunity. We demonstrate that knocking down the OslecRK gene depresses the expression of Î±â€“amylase genes, reducing seed viability and thereby decreasing the rate of seed germination. Moreover, it also inhibits the expression of defense genes, and so reduces the resistance of rice plants to fungal and bacterial pathogens as well as herbivorous insects. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that OslecRK interacts with an actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) in vivo via its kinase domain. Moreover, the rice adf mutant exhibited a reduced seed germination rate due to the suppression of Î±â€“amylase gene expression. This mutant also exhibited depressed immune responses and reduced resistance to biotic stresses. Our results thus provide direct genetic evidence for a common physiological pathway connecting germination and immunity in plants. They also partially explain the common observation that high-vigor seeds often perform well in the field. The dual effects of OslecRK may be indicative of progressive adaptive evolution in rice.
NA	A gene cluster encoding lectin receptor kinases confers broad-spectrum and durable insect resistance in rice	2014	Nature Biotechnology	National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	The brown planthopper (BPH) is the most destructive pest of rice (Oryza sativa) and a substantial threat to rice production, causing losses of billions of dollars annually1, 2. Breeding of resistant cultivars is currently hampered by the rapid breakdown of BPH resistance2. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify more effective BPH-resistance genes. Here, we report molecular cloning and characterization of Bph3, a locus in rice identified more than 30 years ago that confers resistance to BPH. We show that Bph3 is a cluster of three genes encoding plasma membrane¨Clocalized lectin receptor kinases (OsLecRK1-OsLecRK3). Introgression of Bph3 into susceptible rice varieties by transgenic or marker-assisted selection strategies significantly enhanced resistance to both the BPH and the white back planthopper. Our results suggest that these lectin receptor kinase genes function together to confer broad-spectrum and durable insect resistance and provide a resource for molecular breeding of insect-resistant rice cultivars.
