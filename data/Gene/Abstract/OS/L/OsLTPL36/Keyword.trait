OsLTPL36	seed	A lipid transfer protein, OsLTPL36, is essential for seed development and seed quality in rice.	Transcriptional profiling and in situ hybridization analysis confirmed that OsLTPL36 was exclusively expressed in developing seed coat and endosperm aleurone cells
OsLTPL36	seed	A lipid transfer protein, OsLTPL36, is essential for seed development and seed quality in rice.	Down-regulated expression of OsLTPL36 led to decreased seed setting rate and 1000-grain weight in transgenic plants
OsLTPL36	seed	A lipid transfer protein, OsLTPL36, is essential for seed development and seed quality in rice.	Moreover, impeded seed germination and puny seedling were also observed in the OsLTPL36 RNAi lines
OsLTPL36	seedling	A lipid transfer protein, OsLTPL36, is essential for seed development and seed quality in rice.	Moreover, impeded seed germination and puny seedling were also observed in the OsLTPL36 RNAi lines
OsLTPL36	development	A lipid transfer protein, OsLTPL36, is essential for seed development and seed quality in rice.	Histological analysis showed that the embryo development was delayed after down regulation of OsLTPL36
OsLTPL36	seed germination	A lipid transfer protein, OsLTPL36, is essential for seed development and seed quality in rice.	Moreover, impeded seed germination and puny seedling were also observed in the OsLTPL36 RNAi lines
OsLTPL36	endosperm	A lipid transfer protein, OsLTPL36, is essential for seed development and seed quality in rice.	Transcriptional profiling and in situ hybridization analysis confirmed that OsLTPL36 was exclusively expressed in developing seed coat and endosperm aleurone cells
OsLTPL36	endosperm	A lipid transfer protein, OsLTPL36, is essential for seed development and seed quality in rice.	Further studies showed that suppressed expression of OsLTPL36 caused chalky endosperm and resulted in reduced fat acid content in RNAi lines as compared with wild type (WT)
OsLTPL36	grain weight	A lipid transfer protein, OsLTPL36, is essential for seed development and seed quality in rice.	Down-regulated expression of OsLTPL36 led to decreased seed setting rate and 1000-grain weight in transgenic plants
