OsLTPL36	 In this study, we identified OsLTPL36, a homolog of putative lipid transport protein, and showed specific expression in rice developing seed |  Down-regulated expression of OsLTPL36 led to decreased seed setting rate and 1000-grain weight in transgenic plants |  Further studies showed that suppressed expression of OsLTPL36 caused chalky endosperm and resulted in reduced fat acid content in RNAi lines as compared with wild type (WT)	 Further studies showed that suppressed expression of OsLTPL36 caused chalky endosperm and resulted in reduced fat acid content in RNAi lines as compared with wild type (WT) |  Moreover, impeded seed germination and puny seedling were also observed in the OsLTPL36 RNAi lines
