However, the knowledge of lipid transporting related genes and their function in seed development have not been well elucidated yet. In this study, we identified OsLTPL36, a homolog of putative lipid transport protein, and showed specific expression in rice developing seed. Transcriptional profiling and in situ hybridization analysis confirmed that OsLTPL36 was exclusively expressed in developing seed coat and endosperm aleurone cells. Down-regulated expression of OsLTPL36 led to decreased seed setting rate and 1000-grain weight in transgenic plants. Further studies showed that suppressed expression of OsLTPL36 caused chalky endosperm and resulted in reduced fat acid content in RNAi lines as compared with wild type (WT). Histological analysis showed that the embryo development was delayed after down regulation of OsLTPL36. Moreover, impeded seed germination and puny seedling were also observed in the OsLTPL36 RNAi lines. The data demonstrated that OsLTPL36, a lipid transporter, was critical important not only for seed quality but also for seed development and germination in rice.
NA	OsCIP1, a secreted protein, binds to and stabilizes OsCR4 to promote aleurone layer development, seed germination and early seedling growth in rice.	2023	Plant Sci	Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology; Hebei Research Center of the Basic Discipline of Cell Biology; Hebei Collaboration Innovation Center for Cell Signaling and Environmental Adaptation; Hebei Key Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology; College of Life Sciences, Hebei Normal University, 050024 Shijiazhuang, China.

The receptor kinase CRINKLY 4 (CR4) and its orthologs are known for their essential roles in cell differentiation and their shuttling between plasma membrane and cytoplasmic vesicles, a unique feature tied to their extracellular domain. However, the extracellular regulators of CR4 have been little known. Here we identified an OsCR4 Interacting Protein 1 (OsCIP1) (also named as OsLTPL36 in rice) by a yeast two-hybrid screen using the extracellular domain of OsCR4 (OsCR4E) as bait. OsCIP1/OsLTPL36 harbors a signal peptide and is localized to the outer surface of the plasma membrane. It interacted with the TNFR subdomain of OsCR4, causing an increase in OsCR4 recycling to the plasma membrane. oscip1, in which OsCR4 protein was decreased, exhibited thinner aleurone layer, late germination and delayed growth; while OsCIP1-overexpressing plants, in which OsCR4 protein was increased, displayed enhanced growth at the early seedling stage. OsCIP1 was cleaved between W61 and Q62, and the resulting C-terminal half exhibited a greater affinity for OsCR4E than did its precursor. Abolishing this cleavage site compromises OsCIP1&#x27;s ability to promote seedling growth. Our results provide valuable clues for the regulation of CR4 activity and its functions in aleurone layer cell differentiation by a secreted small protein in rice.
