OsCR4|MIS2	OsLTPL36|OsCIP1	OsCIP1, a secreted protein, binds to and stabilizes OsCR4 to promote aleurone layer development, seed germination and early seedling growth in rice.	OsCIP1, a secreted protein, binds to and stabilizes OsCR4 to promote aleurone layer development, seed germination and early seedling growth in rice.
OsCR4|MIS2	OsLTPL36|OsCIP1	OsCIP1, a secreted protein, binds to and stabilizes OsCR4 to promote aleurone layer development, seed germination and early seedling growth in rice.	 Here we identified an OsCR4 Interacting Protein 1 (OsCIP1) (also named as OsLTPL36 in rice) by a yeast two-hybrid screen using the extracellular domain of OsCR4 (OsCR4E) as bait
OsCR4|MIS2	OsLTPL36|OsCIP1	OsCIP1, a secreted protein, binds to and stabilizes OsCR4 to promote aleurone layer development, seed germination and early seedling growth in rice.	 oscip1, in which OsCR4 protein was decreased, exhibited thinner aleurone layer, late germination and delayed growth; while OsCIP1-overexpressing plants, in which OsCR4 protein was increased, displayed enhanced growth at the early seedling stage
