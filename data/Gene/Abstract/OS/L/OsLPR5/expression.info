OsLPR5	 qRT-PCR and promoter-GUS reporter analyses indicated that under Pi-sufficient conditions OsLPR5 was highly expressed in the roots, and specific expression occurred in the leaf collars and nodes, and its expression was increased under Pi-deficient conditions |  Overexpression of OsLPR5 triggered higher ferroxidase activity, and elevated concentrations of Fe(III) in the xylem sap and of total Fe in the roots and shoots |  Transient expression of OsLPR5 in Nicotiana benthamiana provided evidence of its subcellular localization to the cell wall and endoplasmic reticulum |  Knockout mutation in OsLPR5 by means of CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in adverse effects on Pi translocation, on the relative expression of Cis-NATOsPHO1;2, and on several morphological traits, including root development and yield potential	 Overexpression of OsLPR5 triggered higher ferroxidase activity, and elevated concentrations of Fe(III) in the xylem sap and of total Fe in the roots and shoots
