OsLPR3	OsLPR5	Mutation of OsLPR3 Enhances Tolerance to Phosphate Starvation in Rice.	 Therefore, in this study, the roles of OsLPR3 in these processes were investigated, and some functions were found to differ between OsLPR3 and OsLPR5
OsLPR3	OsLPR5	Mutation of OsLPR3 Enhances Tolerance to Phosphate Starvation in Rice.	 The agronomic traits of the oslpr3 mutants, such as 1000-grain weight and seed length, were stimulated under Pi-sufficient conditions, indicating that OsLPR3 plays roles different from those of OsLPR5 during plant growth and development, as well as in the maintenance of the Pi status of rice
