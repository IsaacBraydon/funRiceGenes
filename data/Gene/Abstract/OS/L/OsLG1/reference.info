The area between the upper part of the leaf sheath and the basal portion of the leaf blade contains several specialized organs, such as the laminar joint, auricle and ligule. Here we report the identification of T-DNA insertional mutant lines that lack all of these organs. The gene knocked out in the mutant lines encodes a protein that contains a SBP (SQUAMOSA promoter Binding Protein)-domain and is highly homologous to the maize LIGULELESS1 (LG1) gene. At the amino acid sequence level, the OsLG1 protein is 69% identical to maize LG1 and 78% identical to barley LG1. We named the rice gene OsLIGULELESS1 (OsLG1). Transient expression of an OsLG1:RFP (Red Fluorescent Protein) fusion protein indicated that the protein is localized to the nucleus. Transgenic plants harboring the OsLG1 promoter:GUS (beta-glucuronidase) reporter gene construct display preferential expression in developing laminar joint regions and meristemic regions. The gene is also weakly expressed in the ligule, auricles, and leaf sheaths at the basal region. These results indicate that OsLG1 is a transcriptional factor that plays an important role in building the laminar joint between leaf blade and leaf sheath boundary, thereby controlling ligule and auricle development.
ncomms3200.pdf	Genetic control of inflorescence architecture during rice domestication	2013	Nat Commun	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, National Center for Evaluation of Agricultural Wild Plants (Rice), China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.	Inflorescence architecture is a key agronomical factor determining grain yield, and thus has been a major target of cereal crop domestication. Transition from a spread panicle typical of ancestral wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) to the compact panicle of present cultivars (O. sativa L.) was a crucial event in rice domestication. Here we show that the spread panicle architecture of wild rice is controlled by a dominant gene, OsLG1, a previously reported SBP-domain transcription factor that controls rice ligule development. Association analysis indicates that a single-nucleotide polymorphism-6 in the OsLG1 regulatory region led to a compact panicle architecture in cultivars during rice domestication. We speculate that the cis-regulatory mutation can fine-tune the spatial expression of the target gene, and that selection of cis-regulatory mutations might be an efficient strategy for crop domestication.
ng.2567.pdf	OsLG1 regulates a closed panicle trait in domesticated rice	2013	Nat Genet	Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan. tishii@kobe-u.ac.jp	Reduction in seed shattering was an important phenotypic change during cereal domestication. Here we show that a simple morphological change in rice panicle shape, controlled by the SPR3 locus, has a large impact on seed-shedding and pollinating behaviors. In the wild genetic background of rice, we found that plants with a cultivated-like type of closed panicle had significantly reduced seed shedding through seed retention. In addition, the long awns in closed panicles disturbed the free exposure of anthers and stigmas on the flowering spikelets, resulting in a significant reduction of the outcrossing rate. We localized the SPR3 locus to a 9.3-kb genomic region, and our complementation tests suggest that this region regulates the liguleless gene (OsLG1). Sequencing analysis identified reduced nucleotide diversity and a selective sweep at the SPR3 locus in cultivated rice. Our results suggest that a closed panicle was a selected trait during rice domestication.
NA	Oryza sativa LIGULELESS 2s determine lamina joint positioning and differentiation by inhibiting auxin signaling	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Wheat and Maize Crop Science, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 450002, China.	The lamina joint (LJ) is a grass-specific organ that connects the leaf blade to the sheath and causes the leaf blade to bend away from the vertical axis. The angle between the leaf blade and the vertical axis is termed as the leaf angle. The leaf angle determined by the LJ in cereal crops affects light capture, particularly under conditions of high-density planting, and therefore is an important trait for high yields (Sakamoto et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2019). The LJ is a highly plastic organ that determines leaf angle dynamics and optimizes light capture in response to developmental stages, internal cues, and the changing environments (Asahina et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2015; Qiao et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017; Ruan et al., 2018). The structure of LJ varies among different grass species. In rice (Oryza sativa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), the LJ consists of the collar (mechanical hinge), the ligule (a thin and tongue-like white membrane), and a pair of auricles (hairy and sickle-shaped tissue) (Hoshikawa, 1989; Liu et al., 2019); by contrast, the maize (Zea mays) LJ consists of the ligule, the midrib, and a pair of auricles (thickened tissues that connect blade and sheath) (Kong et al., 2017).
