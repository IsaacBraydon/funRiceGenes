NA	Stress-Responsive Expression, Subcellular Localization and Protein-Protein Interactions of the Rice Metacaspase Family.	2015	Int J Mol Sci	National Key Laboratory for Rice Biology, Institute of Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China. leihero2008@163.com.	Metacaspases, a class of cysteine-dependent proteases like caspases in animals, are important regulators of programmed cell death (PCD) during development and stress responses in plants. The present study was focused on comprehensive analyses of expression patterns of the rice metacaspase (OsMC) genes in response to abiotic and biotic stresses and stress-related hormones. Results indicate that members of the OsMC family displayed differential expression patterns in response to abiotic (e.g., drought, salt, cold, and heat) and biotic (e.g., infection by Magnaporthe oryzae, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani) stresses and stress-related hormones such as abscisic acid, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (a precursor of ethylene), although the responsiveness to these stresses or hormones varies to some extent. Subcellular localization analyses revealed that OsMC1 was solely localized and OsMC2 was mainly localized in the nucleus. Whereas OsMC3, OsMC4, and OsMC7 were evenly distributed in the cells, OsMC5, OsMC6, and OsMC8 were localized in cytoplasm. OsMC1 interacted with OsLSD1 and OsLSD3 while OsMC3 only interacted with OsLSD1 and that the zinc finger domain in OsMC1 is responsible for the interaction activity. The systematic expression and biochemical analyses of the OsMC family provide valuable information for further functional studies on the biological roles of OsMCs in PCD that is related to abiotic and biotic stress responses.
NA	Metallochaperone protein OsHIPP17 regulates the absorption and translocation of cadmium in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2023	Int J Biol Macromol	College of Ecology and Environment, Chengdu University of Technology, Sichuan 610059, China.	Heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant proteins (HIPPs) play vital roles in regulating heavy metal responding activities in plants. Yet only a handful of studies have characterized the functions of HIPPs. In this study, a novel HIPP member OsHIPP17 was functionally characterized, which was involved in the tolerance of yeast and plants to cadmium (Cd). The Cd accumulation in yeast cells was increased due to the overexpression of OsHIPP17. Nevertheless, the overexpression of OsHIPP17 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in compromised growth under Cd stress. Meanwhile, the mutation of OsHIPP17 resulted in 38.9-40.9 % increase of Cd concentration in rice roots as well as 14.3-20.0 % decrease of Cd translocation factor. Further investigation of the genes responsible for Cd absorption and transporter indicated that the expression levels of these genes were also perturbed. In addition, two OsHIPP17-interacting proteins, OsHIPP24 and OsLOL3 were identified in a yeast two hybrid assay. Further analysis of their functions revealed that OsHIPP24 or OsLOL3 may be involved in the regulation of Cd tolerance by OsHIPP17 in rice. All above results implied that OsHIPP17 may affect Cd resistance by regulating the absorption and translocation of Cd in rice.
