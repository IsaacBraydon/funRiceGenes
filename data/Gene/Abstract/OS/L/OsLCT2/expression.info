OsLCT2	Overexpression of OsLCT2, a Low-Affinity Cation Transporter Gene, Reduces Cadmium Accumulation in Shoots and Grains of Rice. |  OsLCT2 was expressed in all tissues of the elongation and maturation zones in roots, with the strongest expression in pericycle and stele cells adjacent to the xylem |  Overexpression of OsLCT2 reduces Cd accumulation in rice shoots and grains by limiting the amounts of Cd loaded into the xylem and restricting Cd translocation from roots to shoots of rice	Overexpression of OsLCT2, a Low-Affinity Cation Transporter Gene, Reduces Cadmium Accumulation in Shoots and Grains of Rice. |  Overexpression of OsLCT2 reduces Cd accumulation in rice shoots and grains by limiting the amounts of Cd loaded into the xylem and restricting Cd translocation from roots to shoots of rice
