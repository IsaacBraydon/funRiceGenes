Cadmium (Cd)-contaminated rice is a serious issue affecting food safety. Understanding the molecular regulatory mechanisms of Cd accumulation in rice grains is crucial to minimizing Cd concentrations in grains. We identified a member of the low-affinity cation transporter family, OsLCT2 in rice. It was a membrane protein. OsLCT2 was expressed in all tissues of the elongation and maturation zones in roots, with the strongest expression in pericycle and stele cells adjacent to the xylem. When grown in Cd-contaminated paddy soils, rice plants overexpressing OsLCT2 significantly reduced Cd concentrations in the straw and grains. Hydroponic experiment demonstrated its overexpression decreased the rate of Cd translocation from roots to shoots, and reduced Cd concentrations in xylem sap and in shoots of rice. Moreover, its overexpression increased Zn concentrations in roots by up-regulating the expression of OsZIP9, a gene responsible for Zn uptake. Overexpression of OsLCT2 reduces Cd accumulation in rice shoots and grains by limiting the amounts of Cd loaded into the xylem and restricting Cd translocation from roots to shoots of rice. Thus, OsLCT2 is a promising genetic resource to be engineered to reduce Cd accumulation in rice grains.
