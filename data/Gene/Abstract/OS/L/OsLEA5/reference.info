In this study, we report the molecular characterization and functional analysis of OsLEA5 gene, which belongs to the atypical late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) group 5C from Oryza sativa L. The cDNA of OsLEA5 contains a 456 bp ORF encoding a polypeptide of 151 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 16.5 kDa and a theoretical pI of 5.07. The OsLEA5 polypeptide is rich in Leu (10%), Ser (8.6%), and Asp (8.6%), while Cys, Trp, and Gln residue contents are very low, which are 2, 1.3, and 1.3%, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that group 5C LEA protein subfamily contains a Pfam:LEA_2 domain architecture and is highly hydrophobic, intrinsically ordered with largely beta-sheet and specific amino acid composition and distribution. Real-time PCR analysis showed that OsLEA5 was expressed in different tissue organs during different development stages of rice. The expression levels of OsLEA5 in the roots and panicles of full ripe stage were dramatically increased. The results of stress tolerance and cell viability assay demonstrated that recombinant E. coli cells producing OsLEA5 fusion protein exhibited improved resistance against diverse abiotic stresses: high salinity, osmotic, freezing, heat, and UV radiation. The OsLEA5 protein confers stabilization of the LDH under different abiotic stresses, such as heating, freeze-thawing, and drying in vitro. The combined results indicated that OsLEA5 protein was a hydrophobic atypical LEA and closely associated with resistance to multiple abiotic stresses. This research offered the valuable information for the development of crops with enhanced resistance to diverse stresses.
NA	The ascorbate peroxidase APX1 is a direct target of a zinc finger transcription factor ZFP36 and a late embryogenesis abundant protein OsLEA5 interacts with ZFP36 to co-regulate OsAPX1 in seed germination in rice.	2017	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210095, China; National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Seed germination is a vital developmental process. Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential repressor of seed germination, while ROS (reactive oxygen species) also plays a vital role in regulating seed germination. ABA could inhibit the production of ROS in seed germination, but the mechanism of ABA reduced ROS production in seed germination was hitherto unknown. Here, by ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation)-seq, we found that ZFP36, a rice zinc finger transcription factor, could directly bind to the promoter of OsAPX1, coding an ascorbate peroxidase (APX) which has the most affinity for H2O2 (substrate; a type of ROS), and act as a transcriptional activator of OsAPX1 promoter. Moreover, ZFP36 could interact with a late embryogenesis abundant protein OsLEA5 to co-regulate the promoter activity of OsAPX1. The seed germination is highly inhibited in ZFP36 overexpression plants under ABA treatment, while an RNA interference (RNAi) mutant of OsLEA5 rice seeds were less sensitive to ABA, and exogenous ASC (ascorbate acid) could alleviate the inhibition induced by ABA. Thus, our conclusion is that OsAPX1 is a direct target of ZFP36 and OsLEA5 could interact with ZFP36 to co-regulate ABA-inhibited seed germination by controlling the expression of OsAPX1.
NA	An Atypical Late Embryogenesis Abundant Protein OsLEA5 Plays A Positive Role In ABA-Induced Antioxidant Defense In Oryza Sativa L.	2018	Plant Cell Physiol	College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210095, China.	OsLEA5 acts as a co-regulator of a transcriptional factor ZFP36 to enhance the expression and the activity of ascorbate peroxidase OsAPX1 to regulate seed germination in rice, but it it unknown whether OsLEA5 is also crucial in plant seedlings under stress conditions. To confirm it, we generated OsLEA5-overexpression and -knockdown rice plants. We found that overexpression of OsLEA5 in rice plants enhanced the tolerance to drought and salt stress; in contrast, an RNA interference (RNAi) mutant of OsLEA5 rice plants were more sensitive to drought and salinity. Further investigation found that various stimulus and ABA could induce OsLEA5 expression, and OsLEA5 played downstream of ZFP36 to be involved in ABA-induced generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the regulation of the expression and the activities of antioxidant defense enzymes in plants leaves, and OsLEA5 contributed to stabilize ZFP36. Additionally, OsLEA5 participates in the accumulation of ABA by upregulating ABA-biosynthesis genes and downregulating ABA-metabolism genes. Moreover, we found two homologue of OsLEA5 (5C700, short for Os05g0526700 and 5C300, short for Os05g0584300) which were induced by ABA also interacted with ZFP36 separately; interestingly, the nucleus-located 5C700 could also act as a co-activator of ZFP36 to modulate OsAPX1 while 5C300 which was ABA-induced downexpressed played as an ABA-induced inhibitor of ZFP36 to regulate OsAPX1. Hence, our conclusion is that OsLEA5 participates in the ABA-mediated antioxidant defense to function in drought and salt stress response in rice, and 5C subgroup of LEAs contribute to play co-regulators of the transcription factor ZFP36.
