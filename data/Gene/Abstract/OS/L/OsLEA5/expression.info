OsLEA5	 The seed germination is highly inhibited in ZFP36 overexpression plants under ABA treatment, while an RNA interference (RNAi) mutant of OsLEA5 rice seeds were less sensitive to ABA, and exogenous ASC (ascorbate acid) could alleviate the inhibition induced by ABA |  Thus, our conclusion is that OsAPX1 is a direct target of ZFP36 and OsLEA5 could interact with ZFP36 to co-regulate ABA-inhibited seed germination by controlling the expression of OsAPX1	 The seed germination is highly inhibited in ZFP36 overexpression plants under ABA treatment, while an RNA interference (RNAi) mutant of OsLEA5 rice seeds were less sensitive to ABA, and exogenous ASC (ascorbate acid) could alleviate the inhibition induced by ABA	 The seed germination is highly inhibited in ZFP36 overexpression plants under ABA treatment, while an RNA interference (RNAi) mutant of OsLEA5 rice seeds were less sensitive to ABA, and exogenous ASC (ascorbate acid) could alleviate the inhibition induced by ABA
OsLEA5	OsLEA5 acts as a co-regulator of a transcriptional factor ZFP36 to enhance the expression and the activity of ascorbate peroxidase OsAPX1 to regulate seed germination in rice, but it it unknown whether OsLEA5 is also crucial in plant seedlings under stress conditions |  To confirm it, we generated OsLEA5-overexpression and -knockdown rice plants |  We found that overexpression of OsLEA5 in rice plants enhanced the tolerance to drought and salt stress; in contrast, an RNA interference (RNAi) mutant of OsLEA5 rice plants were more sensitive to drought and salinity |  Further investigation found that various stimulus and ABA could induce OsLEA5 expression, and OsLEA5 played downstream of ZFP36 to be involved in ABA-induced generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the regulation of the expression and the activities of antioxidant defense enzymes in plants leaves, and OsLEA5 contributed to stabilize ZFP36	 To confirm it, we generated OsLEA5-overexpression and -knockdown rice plants |  We found that overexpression of OsLEA5 in rice plants enhanced the tolerance to drought and salt stress; in contrast, an RNA interference (RNAi) mutant of OsLEA5 rice plants were more sensitive to drought and salinity	 We found that overexpression of OsLEA5 in rice plants enhanced the tolerance to drought and salt stress; in contrast, an RNA interference (RNAi) mutant of OsLEA5 rice plants were more sensitive to drought and salinity
