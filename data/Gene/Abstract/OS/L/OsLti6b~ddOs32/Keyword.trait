OsLti6b|ddOs32	seedling	Isolation of cold stress-responsive genes in the reproductive organs, and characterization of the OsLti6b gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Over-expression of OsLti6b increased cold tolerance as revealed by seedling wilting rates and ion leakages of mature leaves, demonstrating that the extent of the tolerance correlates well with its expression level
OsLti6b|ddOs32	reproductive	Isolation of cold stress-responsive genes in the reproductive organs, and characterization of the OsLti6b gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Isolation of cold stress-responsive genes in the reproductive organs, and characterization of the OsLti6b gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.)
OsLti6b|ddOs32	cold stress	Isolation of cold stress-responsive genes in the reproductive organs, and characterization of the OsLti6b gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Isolation of cold stress-responsive genes in the reproductive organs, and characterization of the OsLti6b gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.)
OsLti6b|ddOs32	seedling	The OsLti6 genes encoding low-molecular-weight membrane proteins are differentially expressed in rice cultivars with contrasting sensitivity to low temperature	Two closely related genes (OsLti6a, OsLti6b), which are induced by low temperature during seedling emergence were isolated from a cold tolerant temperate japonica rice cultivar

Over-expression of OsLti6b increased cold tolerance as revealed by seedling wilting rates and ion leakages of mature leaves, demonstrating that the extent of the tolerance correlates well with its expression level
