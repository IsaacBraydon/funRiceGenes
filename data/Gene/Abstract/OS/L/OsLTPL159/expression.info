OsLTPL159	 Overexpression of an OsLTPL159IL112 allele from the cold-tolerant introgression line IL112 in either the japonica variety Zhonghua17 (ZH17) or the indica variety Teqing background dramatically enhanced cold tolerance |  In addition, down-regulation of the expression of OsLTPL159 in the japonica variety ZH17 by RNA interference (RNAi) significantly decreased cold tolerance |  Notably, overexpression of another allele, OsLTPL159GC2 , from the recipient parent Guichao 2 (GC2), an indica variety, did not improve cold tolerance, indicating that the variations in the OsLTPL159 coding region of GC2 might disrupt its function for cold tolerance	 Overexpression of an OsLTPL159IL112 allele from the cold-tolerant introgression line IL112 in either the japonica variety Zhonghua17 (ZH17) or the indica variety Teqing background dramatically enhanced cold tolerance |  Notably, overexpression of another allele, OsLTPL159GC2 , from the recipient parent Guichao 2 (GC2), an indica variety, did not improve cold tolerance, indicating that the variations in the OsLTPL159 coding region of GC2 might disrupt its function for cold tolerance	 In addition, down-regulation of the expression of OsLTPL159 in the japonica variety ZH17 by RNA interference (RNAi) significantly decreased cold tolerance
