OsLTPL159	seedling	The lipid transfer protein OsLTPL159 is involved in cold tolerance at the early seedling stage in rice.	The lipid transfer protein OsLTPL159 is involved in cold tolerance at the early seedling stage in rice.
OsLTPL159	tolerance	The lipid transfer protein OsLTPL159 is involved in cold tolerance at the early seedling stage in rice.	The lipid transfer protein OsLTPL159 is involved in cold tolerance at the early seedling stage in rice.
OsLTPL159	tolerance	The lipid transfer protein OsLTPL159 is involved in cold tolerance at the early seedling stage in rice.	 In addition, down-regulation of the expression of OsLTPL159 in the japonica variety ZH17 by RNA interference (RNAi) significantly decreased cold tolerance
OsLTPL159	tolerance	The lipid transfer protein OsLTPL159 is involved in cold tolerance at the early seedling stage in rice.	 Notably, overexpression of another allele, OsLTPL159GC2 , from the recipient parent Guichao 2 (GC2), an indica variety, did not improve cold tolerance, indicating that the variations in the OsLTPL159 coding region of GC2 might disrupt its function for cold tolerance
OsLTPL159	tolerance	The lipid transfer protein OsLTPL159 is involved in cold tolerance at the early seedling stage in rice.	 Further sequence comparison found that all 22 japonica varieties surveyed had an OsLTPL159 haplotype identical to IL112 and were more cold-tolerant than the surveyed indica varieties, implying that the variations in OsLTPL159 might be associated with differential cold tolerance of japonica and indica rice
OsLTPL159	tolerance	The lipid transfer protein OsLTPL159 is involved in cold tolerance at the early seedling stage in rice.	 Therefore, our findings suggest that the OsLTPL159 allele of japonica rice could be used to improve cold tolerance of indica rice through a molecular breeding strategy
OsLTPL159	cold tolerance	The lipid transfer protein OsLTPL159 is involved in cold tolerance at the early seedling stage in rice.	The lipid transfer protein OsLTPL159 is involved in cold tolerance at the early seedling stage in rice.

OsLTPL159	R protein	The lipid transfer protein OsLTPL159 is involved in cold tolerance at the early seedling stage in rice.	The lipid transfer protein OsLTPL159 is involved in cold tolerance at the early seedling stage in rice.
OsLTPL159	breeding	The lipid transfer protein OsLTPL159 is involved in cold tolerance at the early seedling stage in rice.	 Therefore, our findings suggest that the OsLTPL159 allele of japonica rice could be used to improve cold tolerance of indica rice through a molecular breeding strategy
