OsLa1	grain	The RNA binding protein OsLa influences grain and anther development in rice.	 Mutant OsLa1 reduced grain length and pollen fertility, whereas OsLa1 overexpression caused the opposite phenotypes
OsLa1	grain	The RNA binding protein OsLa influences grain and anther development in rice.	 Further experiments indicated that OsLa1 modulates grain size by influencing cell expansion
OsLa1	grain length	The RNA binding protein OsLa influences grain and anther development in rice.	 Mutant OsLa1 reduced grain length and pollen fertility, whereas OsLa1 overexpression caused the opposite phenotypes
OsLa1	grain size	The RNA binding protein OsLa influences grain and anther development in rice.	 Further experiments indicated that OsLa1 modulates grain size by influencing cell expansion
OsLa1	pollen	The RNA binding protein OsLa influences grain and anther development in rice.	 Mutant OsLa1 reduced grain length and pollen fertility, whereas OsLa1 overexpression caused the opposite phenotypes
OsLa1	Pollen Fertility	The RNA binding protein OsLa influences grain and anther development in rice.	 Mutant OsLa1 reduced grain length and pollen fertility, whereas OsLa1 overexpression caused the opposite phenotypes
OsLa1	cell expansion	The RNA binding protein OsLa influences grain and anther development in rice.	 Further experiments indicated that OsLa1 modulates grain size by influencing cell expansion
