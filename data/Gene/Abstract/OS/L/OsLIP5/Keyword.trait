OsLIP5	resistance	LIP5, a MVB biogenesis regulator, is required for rice growth.	 Here we report that rice OsLIP5 gene could fully restore both the disease resistance and salt tolerance of the Arabidopsis oslip5 mutant plants to the wild-type levels
OsLIP5	disease	LIP5, a MVB biogenesis regulator, is required for rice growth.	 Here we report that rice OsLIP5 gene could fully restore both the disease resistance and salt tolerance of the Arabidopsis oslip5 mutant plants to the wild-type levels
OsLIP5	disease resistance	LIP5, a MVB biogenesis regulator, is required for rice growth.	 Here we report that rice OsLIP5 gene could fully restore both the disease resistance and salt tolerance of the Arabidopsis oslip5 mutant plants to the wild-type levels
OsLIP5	salt	LIP5, a MVB biogenesis regulator, is required for rice growth.	 Here we report that rice OsLIP5 gene could fully restore both the disease resistance and salt tolerance of the Arabidopsis oslip5 mutant plants to the wild-type levels
OsLIP5	tolerance	LIP5, a MVB biogenesis regulator, is required for rice growth.	 Here we report that rice OsLIP5 gene could fully restore both the disease resistance and salt tolerance of the Arabidopsis oslip5 mutant plants to the wild-type levels
OsLIP5	salt tolerance	LIP5, a MVB biogenesis regulator, is required for rice growth.	 Here we report that rice OsLIP5 gene could fully restore both the disease resistance and salt tolerance of the Arabidopsis oslip5 mutant plants to the wild-type levels
OsLIP5	flowering	LIP5, a MVB biogenesis regulator, is required for rice growth.	 Unlike Arabidopsis atlip5 mutants, rice oslip5 mutants were severely stunted, developed necrotic lesions and all died before flowering
