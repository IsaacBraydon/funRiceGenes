Symbol	Keyword	Title	Evidence
OsLTP5	 ABA 	Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene	 Expression of OsLTP5 was induced in shoots in response to ABA and salicylic acid
OsLTP5	stem	Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene	 The OsLTP5 transcript was expressed prominently in stems and flowers, but was barely detectable in leaves
OsLTP5	cutin	Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene	Treatment with the cutin monomer 16-hydroxypalmitic acid (HPA), a major component of cutin, elicited the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in rice leaves and induced the expression of the lipid transfer protein gene OsLTP5
OsLTP5	cutin	Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene	Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene
OsLTP5	shoot	Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene	 Expression of OsLTP5 was induced in shoots in response to ABA and salicylic acid
OsLTP5	salicylic acid	Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene	 Expression of OsLTP5 was induced in shoots in response to ABA and salicylic acid
OsLTP5	flower	Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene	 The OsLTP5 transcript was expressed prominently in stems and flowers, but was barely detectable in leaves
