Zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) play an important role in regulating plant responses to abiotic stress. However, little is known about the function of LSD1-like-type ZFP in saline-alkaline (SA) stress resistance of rice. In this study, OsLOL5 (GenBank No. AJ620677), containing two LSD1-like-type C2C2 domains, was isolated and analyzed its protection roles in transgenic plants and yeast. OsLOL5 was located in the nucleus as evidenced by the bombardment of onion epidermal cells.OsLOL5 expression significantly increased in rice leaves and roots under 150 mmol L-1 NaCl, 30 mM NaHCO3, and 10 mmol L-1 H2O2 treatment, respectively. Overexpression of OsLOL5 in yeast resulted in SA tolerance at significant level. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsLOL5 grew well in the presence ofboth NaCl and NaHCO3 treatments, whereas wild-type plants exhibited chlorosis, stunted growth phenotype, and even death. SA stress caused significant changes in the malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in non-transgenic plants compared with those in transgenic lines. Transgenic rice overexpressing OsLOL5 exhibited stronger resistance than NT under NaHCO3 treatment, as demonstrated by its greater shoot length, and fresh weight. The genes associated with oxidative stress, such as OsAPX2, OsCAT, OsCu/Zn-SOD, and OsRGRC2, were significantly upregulated in OsLOL5-overexpressing rice. The results suggested that OsLOL5 improved SA tolerance in plants, and regulated oxidative and salinity stress retardation via the active oxygen detoxification pathway.The yeast INVScI bacterium grew significantly better than the control strain under NaCl, NaHCO3, and H2O2 treatments. These findings illustrated that OsLOL5 overexpression enhanced yeast resistance for SA stress through active oxygen species. The present study showed that the OsLOL5 genes involved in the ROS signaling pathways may combine with the model plant Arabidopsis and rice in LDS1-type ZFP by ROS signaling pathways that regulate cell necrosis. We speculated that the OsLOL5 active oxygen scavenging system may have coordinating roles. The present study further revealed that OsLOL5 ZFP could regulate oxidative stress function, but could also provide a basis for salt-resistant rice strains.
