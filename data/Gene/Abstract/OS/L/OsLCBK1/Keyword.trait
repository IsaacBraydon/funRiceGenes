OsLCBK1	blast disease	Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death	 Expression of OsLCBK1 and OsLCBK2 was induced in rice seedlings after treatments with defense signaling molecules and after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of blast disease
OsLCBK1	disease resistance	Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death	 Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsLCBK1 were generated and disease resistance assays indicate that the OsLCBK1-overexpressing plants showed enhanced disease resistance against Pseudmonas syringae pv
OsLCBK1	cell death	Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death	 Treatment with fungal toxin fumonisin B1, an effective inducer of PCD in plants, resulted in reduced level of cell death in the OsLCBK1-overexpressing plants, as indicated by cell death staining, leakage of electrolyte and expression of hypersensitive response indicator genes
OsLCBK1	disease	Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death	 Expression of OsLCBK1 and OsLCBK2 was induced in rice seedlings after treatments with defense signaling molecules and after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of blast disease| Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsLCBK1 were generated and disease resistance assays indicate that the OsLCBK1-overexpressing plants showed enhanced disease resistance against Pseudmonas syringae pv
OsLCBK1	seedling	Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death	 Expression of OsLCBK1 and OsLCBK2 was induced in rice seedlings after treatments with defense signaling molecules and after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of blast disease
OsLCBK1	defense	Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death	" Expression of OsLCBK1 and OsLCBK2 was induced in rice seedlings after treatments with defense signaling molecules and after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of blast disease| Expression levels of some defense-related genes were constitutively up-regulated and further induced after pathogen infection in the OsLCBK1-overexpressing plants"
OsLCBK1	blast	Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death	 Expression of OsLCBK1 and OsLCBK2 was induced in rice seedlings after treatments with defense signaling molecules and after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of blast disease
