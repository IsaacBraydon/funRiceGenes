OsLMP1|OsUBP2	immune response	OsLMP1, Encoding a Deubiquitinase, Regulates the Immune Response in Rice.	 Furthermore, OsLMP1 epigenetically modifies SA synthetic pathway genes by deubiquitinating H(2)B and regulates the immune response in rice
OsLMP1|OsUBP2	immune response	OsLMP1, Encoding a Deubiquitinase, Regulates the Immune Response in Rice.	 In summary, this study deepens our understanding of the function of OsLMP1 in the plant immune response and provides further insight into the relationship between plants and pathogenic microorganisms
