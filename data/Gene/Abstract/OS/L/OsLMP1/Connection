OsLMP1|OsUBP2|LMM22	RSR1|qHD5	Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 2 (OsUBP2) Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Disease Resistance in Rice.	 Map-based cloning showed that the mutated gene in rsr1 encodes a Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 2 (OsUBP2)
OsLMP1|OsUBP2|LMM22	RSR1|qHD5	Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 2 (OsUBP2) Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Disease Resistance in Rice.	 The ubiquitinated proteomics data of rsr1 and WT provide some possible target protein candidates for OsUBP2
OsLMP1|OsUBP2|LMM22	SPL35	A ubiquitin-specific protease functions in regulating cell death and immune responses in rice.	 LMM22 interacts with SPOTTED LEAF 35 (SPL35), a coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to ER degradation domain-containing protein that is known to participate in ubiquitination and the regulation of cell death and disease response in rice
OsLMP1|OsUBP2|LMM22	SPL35	A ubiquitin-specific protease functions in regulating cell death and immune responses in rice.	 Additional analyses suggest that LMM22 can positively regulate and stabilise the abundance of SPL35 protein likely through its deubiquitination activity
OsLMP1|OsUBP2|LMM22	SPL35	A ubiquitin-specific protease functions in regulating cell death and immune responses in rice.	 These data therefore improve our understanding of the function of UBP in rice innate immune responses by demonstrating that LMM22 functions as a critical regulator of SPL35 in cell death and disease resistance
