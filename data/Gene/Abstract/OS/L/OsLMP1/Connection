OsLMP1|OsUBP2	RSR1|qHD5	Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 2 (OsUBP2) Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Disease Resistance in Rice.	 Map-based cloning showed that the mutated gene in rsr1 encodes a Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 2 (OsUBP2)
OsLMP1|OsUBP2	RSR1|qHD5	Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 2 (OsUBP2) Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Disease Resistance in Rice.	 The ubiquitinated proteomics data of rsr1 and WT provide some possible target protein candidates for OsUBP2
