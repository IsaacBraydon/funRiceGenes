OsLMP1|OsUBP2	 The mutation of OsUBP2 was shown to result in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, chloroplast structural defects, and programmed cell death, while the overexpression of OsUBP2 weakened rice resistance to leaf blast	 The mutation of OsUBP2 was shown to result in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, chloroplast structural defects, and programmed cell death, while the overexpression of OsUBP2 weakened rice resistance to leaf blast
OsLMP1|OsUBP2|LMM22	 Both dysfunction and overexpression of LMM22 gave rise to the hypersensitive response-like cell death, reactive oxygen species bursts, and activated defence responses |  LMM22 encodes an active UBP that is localised to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and displays a constitutive expression pattern in rice	 Both dysfunction and overexpression of LMM22 gave rise to the hypersensitive response-like cell death, reactive oxygen species bursts, and activated defence responses
