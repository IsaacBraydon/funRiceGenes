NA	OsLMP1, Encoding a Deubiquitinase, Regulates the Immune Response in Rice.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Lesion mimic mutants have become an effective material for understanding plant-microbe interactions and the immune mechanism in plants. Although many mechanisms responsible for the lesion mimic phenotype have been clarified in plants, the mechanism by which lesion mimic is regulated by posttranslational modification remained largely elusive, especially in rice. In this study, a mutant with the lesion mimic phenotype was obtained and named lmp1-1. Physiological measurements and quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the defense response was activated in the mutants. Transcriptome analysis showed that the phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) pathway was activated in the mutant, causing the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA). The results of mapping based cloning showed that OsLMP1 encodes a deubiquitinase. OsLMP1 can cleave ubiquitination precursors. Furthermore, OsLMP1 epigenetically modifies SA synthetic pathway genes by deubiquitinating H(2)B and regulates the immune response in rice. In summary, this study deepens our understanding of the function of OsLMP1 in the plant immune response and provides further insight into the relationship between plants and pathogenic microorganisms.
NA	Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 2 (OsUBP2) Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Disease Resistance in Rice.	2022	Plants (Basel)	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Lesion mimic mutants (LMMs) are great materials for studying programmed cell death and immune mechanisms in plants. Various mechanisms are involved in the phenotypes of different LMMs, but few studies have explored the mechanisms linking deubiquitination and LMMs in rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we identified a rice LMM, rust spots rice (rsr1), resulting from the mutation of a single recessive gene. This LMM has spontaneous reddish-brown spots on its leaves, and displays enhanced resistance to both fungal leaf blast (caused by Magnaporthe oryzae) and bacterial blight (caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae). Map-based cloning showed that the mutated gene in rsr1 encodes a Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 2 (OsUBP2). The mutation of OsUBP2 was shown to result in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, chloroplast structural defects, and programmed cell death, while the overexpression of OsUBP2 weakened rice resistance to leaf blast. OsUBP2 is therefore a negative regulator of immune processes and ROS production. OsUBP2 has deubiquitinating enzyme activity in vitro, and the enzyme active site includes a cysteine at the 234th residue. The ubiquitinated proteomics data of rsr1 and WT provide some possible target protein candidates for OsUBP2.
