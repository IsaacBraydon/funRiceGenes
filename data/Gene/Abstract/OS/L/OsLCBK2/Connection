OsLCBK1	OsLCBK2	Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death	 In the present study, we cloned and identified two rice long-chain base kinase (LCBK) genes (OsLCBK1 and OsLCBK2), which are involved in biosynthesis of LCBPs, and performed functional analysis in transgenic tobacco
OsLCBK1	OsLCBK2	Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death	 Expression of OsLCBK1 and OsLCBK2 was induced in rice seedlings after treatments with defense signaling molecules and after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of blast disease
