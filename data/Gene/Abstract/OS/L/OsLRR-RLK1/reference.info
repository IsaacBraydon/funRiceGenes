NA	OsLRR-RLK1, an early responsive leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, initiates rice defense responses against a chewing herbivore.	2018	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology &amp; Ministry of Agriculture Key Lab of Molecular Biology of Crop Pathogens and Insects, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, 310058, Hangzhou, China.	Plants are constantly exposed to a variety of environmental stresses, including herbivory. How plants perceive herbivores on a molecular level is poorly understood. Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs), the largest subfamily of RLKs, are essential for plants to detect external stress signals, and may therefore also be involved in herbivore perception. Here, we employed RNA interference silencing, phytohormone profiling and complementation, as well as herbivore resistance assays, to investigate the requirement of an LRR-RLK for the initiation of rice (Oryza sativa) defenses against the chewing herbivore striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis. We discovered a plasma membrane-localized LRR-RLK, OsLRR-RLK1, whose transcription is strongly up-regulated by SSB attack and treatment with oral secretions of Spodoptera frugiperda. OsLRR-RLK1 acts upstream of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK) cascades, and positively regulates defense-related MPKs and WRKY transcription factors. Moreover, OsLRR-RLK1 is a positive regulator of SSB-elicited, but not wound-elicited, levels of jasmonic acid and ethylene, trypsin protease inhibitor activity and plant resistance towards SSB. OsLRR-RLK1 therefore plays an important role in herbivory-induced defenses of rice. Given the well-documented role of LRR-RLKs in the perception of stress-related molecules, we speculate that OsLRR-RLK1 may be involved in the perception of herbivory-associated molecular patterns.
NA	Molecular dissection of early defense signaling underlying volatile-mediated defense regulation and herbivore resistance in rice.	2019	Plant Cell	University of Bern CITY: Bern Switzerland [CH].	Herbivore-induced plant volatiles prime plant defenses and resistance. How volatiles are integrated into early defense signaling is not well understood. Furthermore, whether there is a causal relationship between volatile defense priming and herbivore resistance is unclear. Here, we investigated the impact of indole, a common herbivore-induced plant volatile and known modulator of a wide range of physiological processes in plants, bacteria and animals, on early defense signaling and herbivore resistance in rice. We show that rice plants infested by Spodoptera frugiperda caterpillars release indole up to 25 ng*h-1. Exposure to equal doses of exogenous indole enhances rice resistance to S. frugiperda. Screening of early signaling components reveals that indole pre-exposure directly enhances the expression of the receptor like kinase OsLRR-RLK1. Furthermore, indole-pre exposure followed by simulated herbivory increases (i.e. primes) the transcription, accumulation and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase OsMPK3 as well as the expression of the downstream WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY70 and several jasmonate biosynthesis genes, resulting in a higher accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA). Using transgenic plants defective in early signaling, we show that OsMPK3 is required, and that OsMPK6 and OsWRKY70 contribute to indole-mediated defense priming of JA-dependent herbivore resistance. We conclude that herbivore-induced plant volatiles can increase herbivore resistance of plants through positive regulation of early defense signaling components.
