Accumulation of cadmium (Cd) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) grains poses a potential health problem, especially in Asia. Most Cd in rice grains accumulates through phloem transport, but the molecular mechanism of this transport has not been revealed. In this study, we identified a rice Cd transporter, OsLCT1, involved in Cd transport to the grains. OsLCT1-GFP was localized at the plasma membrane in plant cells, and OsLCT1 showed Cd efflux activity in yeast. In rice plants, strong OsLCT1 expression was observed in leaf blades and nodes during the reproductive stage. In the uppermost node, OsLCT1 transcripts were detected around large vascular bundles and in diffuse vascular bundles. RNAi-mediated knockdown of OsLCT1 did not affect xylem-mediated Cd transport but reduced phloem-mediated Cd transport. The knockdown plants of OsLCT1 accumulated approximately half as much Cd in the grains as did the control plants. The content of other metals in rice grains and plant growth were not negatively affected by OsLCT1 suppression. These results suggest that OsLCT1 functions at the nodes in Cd transport into grains and that in a standard japonica cultivar, the regulation of OsLCT1 enables the generation of "low-Cd rice" without negative effects on agronomical traits. These findings identify a transporter gene for phloem Cd transport in plants.
NA	Co-expression of multiple heavy metal transporters changes the translocation, accumulation, and potential oxidative stress of Cd and Zn in rice (Oryza sativa).	2019	J Hazard Mater	College of Life Science, University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	The OsHMA2, OsLCT1 and OsZIP3 transporters were all involved in zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) transport. So far, only a few researches studied on the co-regulation effect of three transporters related to Zn and Cd transport. The present study showed that rice co-expressing OsLCT1-OsHMA2-OsZIP3 (LHZ) had longer roots and shoots than wild-type (WT) rice after Zn and Cd treatments. The chlorophyll content was significantly higher, and the proline, malondialdehyde and H2O2 contents were significantly lower in co-transgenic lines than in WT under Cd and Zn stress. LHZ in the seedlings of transgenic rice decreased the root-to-shoot translocation of Cd after Cd and Zn treatments. At the filling stage, LHZ line reduced Cd accumulation in grain after Cd treatment. Moreover, LHZ line increased the translocation of Zn to grain and reduced the accumulation of Cd after Zn treatment. These results suggested that LHZ co-expression could effectively decrease the translocation and accumulation of Cd to grains, alleviated the oxidative stress of Cd and Zn, and finally enhanced the quality and safety of rice grains.
