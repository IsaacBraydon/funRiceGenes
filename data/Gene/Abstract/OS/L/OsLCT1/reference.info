Accumulation of cadmium (Cd) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) grains poses a potential health problem, especially in Asia. Most Cd in rice grains accumulates through phloem transport, but the molecular mechanism of this transport has not been revealed. In this study, we identified a rice Cd transporter, OsLCT1, involved in Cd transport to the grains. OsLCT1-GFP was localized at the plasma membrane in plant cells, and OsLCT1 showed Cd efflux activity in yeast. In rice plants, strong OsLCT1 expression was observed in leaf blades and nodes during the reproductive stage. In the uppermost node, OsLCT1 transcripts were detected around large vascular bundles and in diffuse vascular bundles. RNAi-mediated knockdown of OsLCT1 did not affect xylem-mediated Cd transport but reduced phloem-mediated Cd transport. The knockdown plants of OsLCT1 accumulated approximately half as much Cd in the grains as did the control plants. The content of other metals in rice grains and plant growth were not negatively affected by OsLCT1 suppression. These results suggest that OsLCT1 functions at the nodes in Cd transport into grains and that in a standard japonica cultivar, the regulation of OsLCT1 enables the generation of "low-Cd rice" without negative effects on agronomical traits. These findings identify a transporter gene for phloem Cd transport in plants.
NA	Co-expression of multiple heavy metal transporters changes the translocation, accumulation, and potential oxidative stress of Cd and Zn in rice (Oryza sativa).	2019	J Hazard Mater	College of Life Science, University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	The OsHMA2, OsLCT1 and OsZIP3 transporters were all involved in zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) transport. So far, only a few researches studied on the co-regulation effect of three transporters related to Zn and Cd transport. The present study showed that rice co-expressing OsLCT1-OsHMA2-OsZIP3 (LHZ) had longer roots and shoots than wild-type (WT) rice after Zn and Cd treatments. The chlorophyll content was significantly higher, and the proline, malondialdehyde and H2O2 contents were significantly lower in co-transgenic lines than in WT under Cd and Zn stress. LHZ in the seedlings of transgenic rice decreased the root-to-shoot translocation of Cd after Cd and Zn treatments. At the filling stage, LHZ line reduced Cd accumulation in grain after Cd treatment. Moreover, LHZ line increased the translocation of Zn to grain and reduced the accumulation of Cd after Zn treatment. These results suggested that LHZ co-expression could effectively decrease the translocation and accumulation of Cd to grains, alleviated the oxidative stress of Cd and Zn, and finally enhanced the quality and safety of rice grains.
NA	Salicylic acid application alleviates cadmium accumulation in brown rice by modulating its shoot to grain translocation in rice	2021	Chemosphere	Key Laboratory of Marine Food Quality and Hazard Controlling Technology of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, 310018, China. Electronic address: wfj0311@cjlu.edu.cn.	Cadmium (Cd) contamination, which poses a serious threat to human health, has been recognized as a major threat to the agricultural system and crop production. Salicylic acid (SA) is a signaling molecule that plays an important role in against Cd toxicity. Previously, we found that spraying rice with SA could reduce the Cd accumulation in rice grains grown in Cd-contaminated soil. In this study, we studied the specific mechanism of SA spray on reducing Cd accumulation in rice grain. The results showed that treatment with SA could alleviate Cd toxicity in rice by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes that reduce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation, but not by changing the pH, or total or available Cd of the soil. The key factor by which SA treatment reduced Cd accumulation in rice grains was by decreasing the Cd content in rice leaves at the flowering stage. This indicated that SA could modulate the Cd accumulation in shoots, reducing the Cd translocation to rice grains. Furthermore, SA could increase the H2O2 content, activating the SA-signaling pathway and modulating the expression levels of Cd transporters (OsLCT1 and OsLCD) in rice leaves to increase Cd tolerance and reduce Cd accumulation in the rice grain. Thus, spraying rice with SA may be effective measure to cope with Cd contamination in paddy soils.
NA	Nanoparticle-based amelioration of drought stress and cadmium toxicity in rice via triggering the stress responsive genetic mechanisms and nutrient acquisition	2020	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology and Ministry of Agriculture Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Crop Pathogens and Insects, Institute of Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, 310058 Hangzhou, China.	Cadmium and drought are the most destructive of the abiotic stresses with negative consequences in terms of impaired metabolism, restricted nutrient use efficiency and disruptive photosynthesis of plants. The present study investigated the mitigation strategy of both aforementioned stresses by the application of iron oxide (IONPs) and hydrogel nanoparticles (HGNPs) simultaneously probably for the first time. IONPs were biofabricated by using a locally identified Bacillus strain RNT1, while HGNPs were produced chemically followed by the confirmation and characterization of both NPs through nanomaterials characterization techniques. Results of FTIR and XRD showed the capping of NPs by different functional groups together with their crystalline structure, respectively. SEM and TEM analysis showed the spherical shape along with the particle size ranging from 18 to 94 nm of both NPs, while EDS analysis confirmed the elemental purity of NPs. The results revealed that IONPs-treated rice plants increased biomass, antioxidant enzyme contents, photosynthesis efficiency, nutrient acquisition together with the decrease in reactive oxygen species and acropetal Cd translocation under normal and drought stress conditions as compared with control plants. Furthermore, the expression of the Cd transporter genes, OsHMA2, OsHMA3 and OsLCT1 were curtailed in NPs-treated rice plants under normal and drought stress conditions. The overall significance of the study lies in devising the NPs-based solutions of increasing heavy metal pollution and water availability challenges being faced the farmers around the world.
