OsHMA2|OsHMA2v	OsLCT1	Co-expression of multiple heavy metal transporters changes the translocation, accumulation, and potential oxidative stress of Cd and Zn in rice (Oryza sativa).	The OsHMA2, OsLCT1 and OsZIP3 transporters were all involved in zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) transport
OsLCT1	OsZIP3	Co-expression of multiple heavy metal transporters changes the translocation, accumulation, and potential oxidative stress of Cd and Zn in rice (Oryza sativa).	The OsHMA2, OsLCT1 and OsZIP3 transporters were all involved in zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) transport
OsLCT1	ZN	Co-expression of multiple heavy metal transporters changes the translocation, accumulation, and potential oxidative stress of Cd and Zn in rice (Oryza sativa).	The OsHMA2, OsLCT1 and OsZIP3 transporters were all involved in zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) transport
OsLCD	OsLCT1	Salicylic acid application alleviates cadmium accumulation in brown rice by modulating its shoot to grain translocation in rice	 Furthermore, SA could increase the H2O2 content, activating the SA-signaling pathway and modulating the expression levels of Cd transporters (OsLCT1 and OsLCD) in rice leaves to increase Cd tolerance and reduce Cd accumulation in the rice grain
OsHMA2|OsHMA2v	OsLCT1	Nanoparticle-based amelioration of drought stress and cadmium toxicity in rice via triggering the stress responsive genetic mechanisms and nutrient acquisition	 Furthermore, the expression of the Cd transporter genes, OsHMA2, OsHMA3 and OsLCT1 were curtailed in NPs-treated rice plants under normal and drought stress conditions
OsLCT1	qCdT7|OsHMA3	Nanoparticle-based amelioration of drought stress and cadmium toxicity in rice via triggering the stress responsive genetic mechanisms and nutrient acquisition	 Furthermore, the expression of the Cd transporter genes, OsHMA2, OsHMA3 and OsLCT1 were curtailed in NPs-treated rice plants under normal and drought stress conditions
