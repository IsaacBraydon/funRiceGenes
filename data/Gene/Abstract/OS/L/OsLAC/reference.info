Increasing grain yields is a major focus of crop breeders around the world. Here we report that overexpression of the rice microRNA (miRNA) OsmiR397, which is naturally highly expressed in young panicles and grains, enlarges grain size and promotes panicle branching, leading to an increase in overall grain yield of up to 25% in a field trial. To our knowledge, no previous report has shown a positive regulatory role of miRNA in the control of plant seed size and grain yield. We determined that OsmiR397 increases grain yield by downregulating its target, OsLAC, whose product is a laccase-like protein that we found to be involved in the sensitivity of plants to brassinosteroids. As miR397 is highly conserved across different species, our results suggest that manipulating miR397 may be useful for increasing grain yield not only in rice but also in other cereal crops.
NA	MiR529a controls plant height, tiller number, panicle architecture and grain size by regulating SPL target genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2021	Plant Sci	Institute of Crop Science, Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Crop Germplasm, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world. Breeding high-yield, multi-resistant and high-quality varieties has always been the goal of rice breeding. Rice tiller, panicle architecture and grain size are the constituent factors of yield, which are regulated by both genetic and environmental factors, including miRNAs, transcription factors, and downstream target genes. Previous studies have shown that SPL (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING-LIKE) transcription factors can control rice tiller, panicle architecture and grain size, which were regulated by miR156, miR529 and miR535. In this study, we obtained miR529a target mimicry (miR529a-MIMIC) transgenic plants to investigate plant phenotypes, physiological and molecular characteristics together with miR529a overexpression (miR529a-OE) and wild type (WT) to explore the function of miR529a and its SPL target genes in rice. We found that OsSPL2, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18 at seedling stage were regulated by miR529a, but there had complicated mechanism to control plant height. OsSPL2, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and SPL18 at tillering stage were regulated by miR529a to control plant height and tiller number. And panicle architecture and grain size were controlled by miR529a through altering the expression of all five target genes OsSPL2, OsSPL7, OsSPL14, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18. Our study suggested that miR529a might control rice growth and development by regulating different SPL target genes at different stages, which could provide a new method to improve rice yield by regulating miR529a and its SPL target genes.
