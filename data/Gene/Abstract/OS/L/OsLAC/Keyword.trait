OsLAC	grain yield	Overexpression of microRNA OsmiR397 improves rice yield by increasing grain size and promoting panicle branching	 We determined that OsmiR397 increases grain yield by downregulating its target, OsLAC, whose product is a laccase-like protein that we found to be involved in the sensitivity of plants to brassinosteroids
