OsC6	OsLTP47	OsLTP47 may function in a lipid transfer relay essential for pollen wall development in rice.	 Yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays reveal that OsLTP47 physically interacts with another LTP, OsC6
OsC6	OsLTP47	OsLTP47 may function in a lipid transfer relay essential for pollen wall development in rice.	 These findings suggest that the plasma membrane-localized OsLTP47 may function as a mediator in a lipid transfer relay through association with cytosolic and/or locular OsC6 for pollen wall development and that various LTPs may function in a coordinated manner to transport lipid molecules during pollen wall development
