OsLon1	leaf	Molecular cloning and expression of a cDNA encoding Lon protease from rice (Oryza sativa)	Tissue expression pattern analysis revealed that OsLon1 was highly expressed in young leaves, mature leaves, and leaf sheaths but only weakly in young roots, mature roots, and young panicles
OsLon1	sheath	Molecular cloning and expression of a cDNA encoding Lon protease from rice (Oryza sativa)	Tissue expression pattern analysis revealed that OsLon1 was highly expressed in young leaves, mature leaves, and leaf sheaths but only weakly in young roots, mature roots, and young panicles
OsLon1	panicle	Molecular cloning and expression of a cDNA encoding Lon protease from rice (Oryza sativa)	Tissue expression pattern analysis revealed that OsLon1 was highly expressed in young leaves, mature leaves, and leaf sheaths but only weakly in young roots, mature roots, and young panicles
OsLon1	root	Molecular cloning and expression of a cDNA encoding Lon protease from rice (Oryza sativa)	Tissue expression pattern analysis revealed that OsLon1 was highly expressed in young leaves, mature leaves, and leaf sheaths but only weakly in young roots, mature roots, and young panicles
