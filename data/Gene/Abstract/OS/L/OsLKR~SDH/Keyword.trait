OsLKR|SDH	endosperm	Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain	 OsLKR/SDH was highly expressed in the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm
OsLKR|SDH	transcription factor	Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain	 Here, we show that OsLKR/SDH is directly regulated by major transcriptional regulators of seed storage protein (SSP) genes: the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor (TF), RISBZ1, and the DNA-binding with one finger (DOF) transcription factor, RPBF| This result was in contrast to the fact that a significant reduction of SSP was observed only when these transcription factors were simultaneously reduced, suggesting that RISBZ1 and RPBF regulate SSP genes and OsLKR/SDH with high and limited redundancy, respectively
OsLKR|SDH	seed	Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain	 L), a bifunctional OsLKR/SDH is predominantly present in seeds| Here, we show that OsLKR/SDH is directly regulated by major transcriptional regulators of seed storage protein (SSP) genes: the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor (TF), RISBZ1, and the DNA-binding with one finger (DOF) transcription factor, RPBF
OsLKR|SDH	grain	Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain	 Reducing either RISBZ1 or RPBF decreased OsLKR/SDH levels, resulting in an increase in free lysine content in rice grain
