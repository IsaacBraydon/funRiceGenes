OsLKR|SDH	RPBF|OsDof3	Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain	Here, we show that OsLKR/SDH is directly regulated by major transcriptional regulators of seed storage protein (SSP) genes: the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor (TF), RISBZ1, and the DNA-binding with one finger (DOF) transcription factor, RPBF
OsLKR|SDH	RPBF|OsDof3	Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain	Mutation analyses in planta, trans-activation reporter assays in vivo and electrophorestic mobility shift assays in vitro showed that the RPBF-recognizing prolamin box (AAAG) and the RISBZ1-recognizing GCN4 motif (TGAG/CTCA) act as important cis-elements for proper expression of OsLKR/SDH like SSP genes
OsLKR|SDH	RPBF|OsDof3	Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain	Reducing either RISBZ1 or RPBF decreased OsLKR/SDH levels, resulting in an increase in free lysine content in rice grain
OsLKR|SDH	RPBF|OsDof3	Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain	This result was in contrast to the fact that a significant reduction of SSP was observed only when these transcription factors were simultaneously reduced, suggesting that RISBZ1 and RPBF regulate SSP genes and OsLKR/SDH with high and limited redundancy, respectively
