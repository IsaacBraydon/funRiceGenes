OsLecRK-S.7|OsLecRK5	OsUgp1|Ugp1|UGPase1	Rice OsLecRK5 phosphorylates a UGPase to regulate callose biosynthesis during pollen development.	 In vitro assay showed that OsLecRK5 phosphorylates the callose synthesis enzyme UGP1, enhancing callose biosynthesis during anther development
OsLecRK-S.7|OsLecRK5	OsUgp1|Ugp1|UGPase1	Rice OsLecRK5 phosphorylates a UGPase to regulate callose biosynthesis during pollen development.	 Together, our results demonstrated that PM-localized OsLecRK5 phosphorylates UGP1 and promotes its activity in callose biosynthesis in rice
