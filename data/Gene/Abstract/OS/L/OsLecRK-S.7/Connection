OsLecRK-S.7|OsLecRK5|OsDAF1	OsUgp1|Ugp1|UGPase1	Rice OsLecRK5 phosphorylates a UGPase to regulate callose biosynthesis during pollen development.	 In vitro assay showed that OsLecRK5 phosphorylates the callose synthesis enzyme UGP1, enhancing callose biosynthesis during anther development
OsLecRK-S.7|OsLecRK5|OsDAF1	OsUgp1|Ugp1|UGPase1	Rice OsLecRK5 phosphorylates a UGPase to regulate callose biosynthesis during pollen development.	 Together, our results demonstrated that PM-localized OsLecRK5 phosphorylates UGP1 and promotes its activity in callose biosynthesis in rice
OsINP1	OsLecRK-S.7|OsLecRK5|OsDAF1	Rice pollen aperture formation is regulated by the interplay between OsINP1 and OsDAF1.	Rice pollen aperture formation is regulated by the interplay between OsINP1 and OsDAF1.
OsINP1	OsLecRK-S.7|OsLecRK5|OsDAF1	Rice pollen aperture formation is regulated by the interplay between OsINP1 and OsDAF1.	 Furthermore, our results demonstrate that OsINP1 is required for polarization of OsDAF1 via direct protein interaction, suggesting that OsINP1 has an additional role in the formation of annulus that is absent in Arabidopsis
