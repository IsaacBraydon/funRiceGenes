NA	Lectin receptor kinase OsLecRK-S.7 is required for pollen development and male fertility.	2019	J Integr Plant Biol	Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Plant Development, School of Life Sciences, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, 510631, China.	Pollen grains are covered by exine that protects the pollen from stress and facilitates pollination. Here we isolated a male sterile mutant s13283 in rice exhibiting aborted pollen with abnormal exine and defective aperture. The mutant gene encodes a novel plasma membrane-localized legume-lectin receptor kinase that we named OsLecRK-S.7. OsLecRK-S.7 was expressed at different levels in all tested tissues and throughout anther development. In vitro kinase assay showed OsLecRK-S.7 capable of autophosporylation. Mutation in s13283 (E560K) and mutation of the conserved ATP binding site (K418E) both knocked out the kinase activity. Mass spectrometry showed Thr376 , Ser378 , Thr386 , Thr403 , and Thr657 to be the autophosphorylation sites. Mutation of individual autophosphorylation site affected the in vitro kinase activity to different degrees, but did not abolish the gene function in fertility complementation. oslecrk-s.7 mutant plant overexpressing OsLecRK-S.7 recovered male fertility but showed severe growth retardation with reduced number of tillers, and these phenotypes were abolished by E560K or K418E mutation. The results indicated that OsLecRK-S.7 was a key regulator of pollen development. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
NA	Rice OsLecRK5 phosphorylates a UGPase to regulate callose biosynthesis during pollen development.	2020	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.	The temporary callose layer surrounding the tetrads of microspores is critical for male gametophyte development in flowering plants, as abnormal callose deposition can lead to microspore abortion. A sophisticated signaling network regulates callose biosynthesis, but these pathways are poorly understood. In this study, we characterized a rice male sterile mutant, oslecrk5, which showed defective callose deposition during meiosis. OsLecRK5 encodes a plasma membrane (PM)-localized lectin receptor like kinase, which can form dimer with itself. Moreover, normal anther development requires the K-phosphorylation site (a conserved residue at the ATP-binding site) of OsLecRK5. In vitro assay showed that OsLecRK5 phosphorylates the callose synthesis enzyme UGP1, enhancing callose biosynthesis during anther development. Together, our results demonstrated that PM-localized OsLecRK5 phosphorylates UGP1 and promotes its activity in callose biosynthesis in rice. This is the first evidence that an RLK positively regulates callose biosynthesis.
NA	Rice pollen aperture formation is regulated by the interplay between OsINP1 and OsDAF1.	2020	Nat Plants	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic &amp; Developmental Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.	The aperture on the pollen surface provides an exit for the emerging pollen tube. Apertures exhibit huge morphological variation across plant species-grasses, including rice, possess a complex aperture consisting of an annulus and an operculum-but little is known about how this species-specific cell-surface pattern forms. Here, we report a lectin receptor-like kinase in Oryza sativa, OsDAF1, which is essential for annulus formation and thus for fertility. OsDAF1 is evenly distributed in early microsporocytes but localizes to the distal pre-aperture site at the tetrad stage. We further reveal that the rice orthologue of a key aperture factor in Arabidopsis, OsINP1, has conserved and diversified roles in rice aperture formation. Disruption of OsINP1 prevents formation of the aperture, precluding pollen-tube germination. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that OsINP1 is required for polarization of OsDAF1 via direct protein interaction, suggesting that OsINP1 has an additional role in the formation of annulus that is absent in Arabidopsis. Our study reveals the importance of the aperture for rice grain yield and reveals mechanisms controlling pollen aperture development in cereal species.
