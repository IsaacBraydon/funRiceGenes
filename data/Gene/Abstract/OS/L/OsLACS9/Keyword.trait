OsLACS9	growth	Functional Analysis of Rice Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Synthetase 9 (OsLACS9) in the Chloroplast Envelope Membrane.	 Overall, the data in this study provide an advanced understanding of the function of OsLACS9 and its role in starch degradation and plant growth
OsLACS9	starch	Functional Analysis of Rice Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Synthetase 9 (OsLACS9) in the Chloroplast Envelope Membrane.	 Our results indicate that the loss-of-function mutations in OsLACS9 affect the architecture of internodes resulting in dwarf plants with large starch granules in the chloroplast, showing the suppression of starch degradation
