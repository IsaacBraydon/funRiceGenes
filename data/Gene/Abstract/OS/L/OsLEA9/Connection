OsLEA9	OsMAPK33|OsMAPK3	Cold-adaptive evolution at the reproductive stage in Geng/japonica subspecies reveals the role of OsMAPK3 and OsLEA9.	 Here, we identified MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 3 (OsMAPK3) and LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT PROTEIN 9 (OsLEA9) as two important regulators for the cold adaptation of Geng subspecies from a combination of transcriptome analysis and genome-wide association study
