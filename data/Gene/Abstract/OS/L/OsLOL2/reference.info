Arabidopsis LSD1-related proteins that contain LSD1-like zinc finger domains have been identified to be involved in disease resistance and programmed cell death. To investigate the potential role of LSD1-related gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.), we cloned an LSD1 ortholog, OsLOL2, from the rice cDNA plasmid library. The OsLOL2 gene is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 163 amino acids with two LSD1-like zinc finger domains with 74.5% identity to those of LSD1. Southern blot analysis indicated that OsLOL2 was a single-copy gene in the rice genome. Transgenic rice lines carrying the antisense strand of OsLOL2 with decreased expression of OsLOL2 had dwarf phenotypes, and the dwarfism could be restored by exogenous GA(3) treatment, suggesting that the dwarfism was the result of a deficiency in bioactive gibberellin (GA). In agreement with this possibility, the content of endogenous bioactive GA(1) decreased in the antisense transgenic lines. Expression of OsKS1, one of the genes encoding for GA biosynthetic enzymes, was suppressed in the antisense transgenic lines. Sense transgenic lines with increased expression of OsLOL2 were more resistant to rice bacterial blight, while antisense transgenic lines were less resistant to rice bacterial blight. The OsLOL2-GFP (green fluorescence protein) fusion protein was localized in the nucleus of cells of transgenic BY2 tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). These data suggest that OsLOL2 is involved in rice growth and disease resistance.
