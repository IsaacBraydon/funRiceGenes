OsLUX|OsPCL1	 OsLUX displayed an obvious diurnal rhythm expression with the peak at dusk and promoted rice flowering via coordinating the expression of genes associated with the circadian clock and the output integrators of photoperiodic flowering
OsLUX|OsPCL1	 Furthermore, overexpressing OsLUX upregulated the expression levels of oxidative stress-responsive genes, which improved reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging ability and enhanced tolerance to chilling stress |  Promoter analysis showed that the OsLUX promoter contains two dehydration-responsive element binding (DREB) motifs at positions -510/-505 (GTCGGa) and -162/-170 (cCACCGccc), which indicated that OsDREB1s and OsDREB2s probably regulate OsLUX expression by binding to the motif to respond to cold stress
