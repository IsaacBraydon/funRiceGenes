OsLUX|OsPCL1	grain	LUX ARRHYTHMO Interacts With ELF3a and ELF4a to Coordinate Vegetative Growth and Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.	 Non-functional alleles of OsLUX extremely extended vegetative phase, leading to photoperiod-insensitive late flowering and great increase of grain yield
OsLUX|OsPCL1	grain yield	LUX ARRHYTHMO Interacts With ELF3a and ELF4a to Coordinate Vegetative Growth and Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.	 Non-functional alleles of OsLUX extremely extended vegetative phase, leading to photoperiod-insensitive late flowering and great increase of grain yield
OsLUX|OsPCL1	yield	LUX ARRHYTHMO Interacts With ELF3a and ELF4a to Coordinate Vegetative Growth and Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.	 Non-functional alleles of OsLUX extremely extended vegetative phase, leading to photoperiod-insensitive late flowering and great increase of grain yield
OsLUX|OsPCL1	vegetative	LUX ARRHYTHMO Interacts With ELF3a and ELF4a to Coordinate Vegetative Growth and Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.	 Non-functional alleles of OsLUX extremely extended vegetative phase, leading to photoperiod-insensitive late flowering and great increase of grain yield
OsLUX|OsPCL1	flowering	LUX ARRHYTHMO Interacts With ELF3a and ELF4a to Coordinate Vegetative Growth and Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.	 Non-functional alleles of OsLUX extremely extended vegetative phase, leading to photoperiod-insensitive late flowering and great increase of grain yield
OsLUX|OsPCL1	flowering	LUX ARRHYTHMO Interacts With ELF3a and ELF4a to Coordinate Vegetative Growth and Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.	 OsLUX displayed an obvious diurnal rhythm expression with the peak at dusk and promoted rice flowering via coordinating the expression of genes associated with the circadian clock and the output integrators of photoperiodic flowering
OsLUX|OsPCL1	flowering	LUX ARRHYTHMO Interacts With ELF3a and ELF4a to Coordinate Vegetative Growth and Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.	 OsLUX combined with OsELF4a and OsELF3a or OsELF3b to form two ECs, of which the OsLUX-OsELF3a-OsELF4a was likely the dominant promoter for photoperiodic flowering
OsLUX|OsPCL1	transcription factor	The clock component OsLUX regulates rice heading through recruiting OsELF3-1 and OsELF4s to repress Hd1 and Ghd7.	 RESULTS: The circadian gene OsLUX encodes an MYB family transcription factor that functions as a vital circadian clock regulator and controls rice heading
OsLUX|OsPCL1	flowering time	The clock component OsLUX regulates rice heading through recruiting OsELF3-1 and OsELF4s to repress Hd1 and Ghd7.	 OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to confirm the role of OsLUX in flowering time regulation in rice
OsLUX|OsPCL1	flowering	The clock component OsLUX regulates rice heading through recruiting OsELF3-1 and OsELF4s to repress Hd1 and Ghd7.	 OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to confirm the role of OsLUX in flowering time regulation in rice
OsLUX|OsPCL1	flowering	The clock component OsLUX regulates rice heading through recruiting OsELF3-1 and OsELF4s to repress Hd1 and Ghd7.	 OsELF3-1 contributes to the translocation of OsLUX to the nucleus, and a compromised flowering phenotype results upon mutation of any component of the OsEC complex
