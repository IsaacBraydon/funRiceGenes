NA	Clock component OsPRR73 positively regulates rice salt tolerance by modulating OsHKT2;1-mediated sodium homeostasis	2020	EMBO J	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	The roles of clock components in salt stress tolerance remain incompletely characterized in rice. Here, we show that, among OsPRR (Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator) family members, OsPRR73 specifically confers salt tolerance in rice. Notably, the grain size and yield of osprr73 null mutants were significantly decreased in the presence of salt stress, with accumulated higher level of reactive oxygen species and sodium ions. RNA sequencing and biochemical assays identified OsHKT2;1, encoding a plasma membrane-localized Na+ transporter, as a transcriptional target of OsPRR73 in mediating salt tolerance. Correspondingly, null mutants of OsHKT2;1 displayed an increased tolerance to salt stress. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays further identified HDAC10 as nuclear interactor of OsPRR73 and co-repressor of OsHKT2;1. Consistently, H3K9ac histone marks at OsHKT2;1 promoter regions were significantly reduced in osprr73 mutant. Together, our findings reveal that salt-induced OsPRR73 expression confers salt tolerance by recruiting HDAC10 to transcriptionally repress OsHKT2;1, thus reducing cellular Na+ accumulation. This exemplifies a new molecular link between clock components and salt stress tolerance in rice.
Murakami-2007-Comparative overview.pdf	Comparative overviews of clock-associated genes of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, School of Agriculture, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan. t2706775@mbox.nagoya-u.ac.jp	In higher plants, circadian rhythms are highly relevant to a wide range of biological processes. To such circadian rhythms, the clock (oscillator) is central, and recent intensive studies on the model higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana have begun to shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of the central clock. Such representative clock-associated genes of A. thaliana are the homologous CCA1 and LHY genes, and five PRR genes that belong to a small family of pseudo-response regulators including TOC1. Others are GI, ZTL, ELF3, ELF4, LUX/PCL1, etc. In this context, a simple question arose as to whether or not the molecular picture of the model Arabidopsis clock is conserved in other higher plants. Here we made an effort to answer the question with special reference to Oryza sativa, providing experimental evidence that this model monocot also has a set of highly conserved clock-associated genes, such as those designated as OsCCA1, OsPRR-series including OsTOC1/OsPRR1, OsZTLs, OsPCL1 as well as OsGI. These results will provide us with insight into the general roles of plant circadian clocks, such as those for the photoperiodic control of flowering time that has a strong impact on the reproduction and yield in many higher plants.
NA	A clock regulatory module is required for salt tolerance and control of heading date in rice	2021	Plant Cell Environ	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	The circadian clock plays multiple roles in plant stress responses and developmental transition phases. Nevertheless, the underlying molecular mechanisms and individual clock components that coordinately regulate important agronomic traits of rice such as salt tolerance and heading date remain to be elucidated. Here, we identify a rice ternary repressive protein complex composed of OsELF4a, OsELF3-1 and OsLUX, which was designated as OsEC1 in analogy to a similar complex in Arabidopsis. OsELF4a physically interacts with OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2 in nucleus, whilst OsELF3-1 rather than OsELF3-2 strongly interacts with OsLUX, a Myb-domain containing transcriptional factor. Phenotypic analyses show a role for this complex in heading and salt tolerance. The loss-of-function mutants of OsEC1 exhibit lower survival rate under salt stress and late heading date. Transcriptomic profiling together with biochemical assays identified the GIGANTEA homologue OsGI as a direct transcriptional target of OsEC1. Notably, the osgi-101 mutant, generated by CRISPR/Cas9, is salt tolerant and exhibits early heading date in long day conditions. Together, our findings characterized a transcriptional module in rice composed by the OsEC1 repressing OsGI, which links the circadian clock with salt tolerance and control of heading date.
NA	LUX ARRHYTHMO Interacts With ELF3a and ELF4a to Coordinate Vegetative Growth and Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Genetics, Breeding and Multiple Utilization of Crops, Ministry of Education, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China.	The evening complex (EC) plays a critical role in photoperiod flowering in Arabidopsis. Nevertheless, the underlying functions of individual components and coordinate regulation mechanism of EC genes in rice flowering remain to be elucidated. Here, we characterized the critical role of LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX) in photoperiod perception and coordinating vegetative growth and flowering in rice. Non-functional alleles of OsLUX extremely extended vegetative phase, leading to photoperiod-insensitive late flowering and great increase of grain yield. OsLUX displayed an obvious diurnal rhythm expression with the peak at dusk and promoted rice flowering via coordinating the expression of genes associated with the circadian clock and the output integrators of photoperiodic flowering. OsLUX combined with OsELF4a and OsELF3a or OsELF3b to form two ECs, of which the OsLUX-OsELF3a-OsELF4a was likely the dominant promoter for photoperiodic flowering. In addition, OsELF4a was also essential for promoting rice flowering. Unlike OsLUX, loss OsELF4a displayed a marginal influence under short-day (SD) condition, but markedly delayed flowering time under long-day (LD) condition. These results suggest that rice EC genes share the function of promoting flowering. This is agreement with the orthologs of SD plant, but opposite to the counterparts of LD species. Taken together, rice EC genes display similar but not identical function in photoperiodic flowering, probably through regulating gene expression cooperative and independent. These findings facilitate our understanding of photoperiodic flowering in plants, especially the SD crops.
NA	The evening complex integrates photoperiod signals to control flowering in rice.	2022	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Instituto de Tecnologia Química e Biológica António Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, 2780-157 Oeiras, Portugal.	Plants use photoperiodism to activate flowering in response to a particular daylength. In rice, flowering is accelerated in short-day conditions, and even a brief exposure to light during the dark period (night-break) is sufficient to delay flowering. Although many of the genes involved in controlling flowering in and short-day flowering pathways are integrated, and the mechanism of photoperiod perception is not understood. While many of the signaling components controlling photoperiod-activated flowering are conserved between Arabidopsis and rice, flowering in these two systems is activated by opposite photoperiods. Here we establish that photoperiodism in rice is controlled by the evening complex (EC). We show that mutants in the EC genes LUX ARRYTHMO (LUX) and EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3) paralogs abolish rice flowering. We also show that the EC directly binds and suppresses the expression of flowering repressors, including PRR37 and Ghd7. We further demonstrate that light acts via phyB to cause a rapid and sustained posttranslational modification of ELF3-1. Our results suggest a mechanism by which the EC is able to control both and short-day flowering pathways.
NA	The clock component OsLUX regulates rice heading through recruiting OsELF3-1 and OsELF4s to repress Hd1 and Ghd7.	2022	J Adv Res	China National Center for Rice Improvement and State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China; Rice Research Institute, Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.	INTRODUCTION: Circadian clocks coordinate internal physiology and external environmental factors to regulate cereals flowering, which is critical for reproductive growth and optimal yield determination. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to confirm the role of OsLUX in flowering time regulation in rice. Further research illustrates how the OsELF4s-OsELF3-1-OsLUX complex directly regulates flowering-related genes to mediate rice heading. METHODS: We identified a circadian gene OsLUX by the MutMap method. The transcription levels of flowering-related genes were evaluated in WT and oslux mutants. OsLUX forms OsEC (OsELF4s-OsELF3-1-OsLUX) complex were supported by yeast two-hybrid, pull down, BiFC, and luciferase complementation assays (LCA). The EMSA, Chip-qPCR, luciferase luminescence images, and relative LUC activity assays were performed to examine the targeted regulation of flowering genes by the OsEC (OsELF4s-OsELF3-1-OsLUX) complex. RESULTS: The circadian gene OsLUX encodes an MYB family transcription factor that functions as a vital circadian clock regulator and controls rice heading. Defect in OsLUX causes an extremely late heading phenotype under natural long-day and short-day conditions, and the function was further confirmed through genetic complementation, overexpression, and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout. OsLUX forms the OsEC (OsELF4s-OsELF3-1-OsLUX) complex by recruiting OsELF3-1 and OsELF4s, which were required to regulate rice heading. OsELF3-1 contributes to the translocation of OsLUX to the nucleus, and a compromised flowering phenotype results upon mutation of any component of the OsEC complex. The OsEC complex directly represses Hd1 and Ghd7 expression via binding to their promoter&#x27;s LBS (LUX binding site) element. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that the circadian gene OsLUX regulates rice heading by directly regulating rhythm oscillation and core flowering-time-related genes. We uncovered a mechanism by which the OsEC target suppresses the expression of Hd1 and Ghd7 directly to modulate photoperiodic flowering in rice. The OsEC (OsELF4s-OsELF3-1-OsLUX)-Hd1/Ghd7 regulatory module provides the genetic targets for crop improvement.
