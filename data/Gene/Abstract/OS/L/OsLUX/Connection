OsELF4a	OsLUX|OsPCL1	A clock regulatory module is required for salt tolerance and control of heading date in rice	 Here, we identify a rice ternary repressive protein complex composed of OsELF4a, OsELF3-1 and OsLUX, which was designated as OsEC1 in analogy to a similar complex in Arabidopsis
OsELF4a	OsLUX|OsPCL1	A clock regulatory module is required for salt tolerance and control of heading date in rice	 OsELF4a physically interacts with OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2 in nucleus, whilst OsELF3-1 rather than OsELF3-2 strongly interacts with OsLUX, a Myb-domain containing transcriptional factor
Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	OsLUX|OsPCL1	A clock regulatory module is required for salt tolerance and control of heading date in rice	 Here, we identify a rice ternary repressive protein complex composed of OsELF4a, OsELF3-1 and OsLUX, which was designated as OsEC1 in analogy to a similar complex in Arabidopsis

OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	OsLUX|OsPCL1	A clock regulatory module is required for salt tolerance and control of heading date in rice	 OsELF4a physically interacts with OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2 in nucleus, whilst OsELF3-1 rather than OsELF3-2 strongly interacts with OsLUX, a Myb-domain containing transcriptional factor
OsELF4a	OsLUX|OsPCL1	LUX ARRHYTHMO Interacts With ELF3a and ELF4a to Coordinate Vegetative Growth and Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.	 OsLUX combined with OsELF4a and OsELF3a or OsELF3b to form two ECs, of which the OsLUX-OsELF3a-OsELF4a was likely the dominant promoter for photoperiodic flowering
OsELF4a	OsLUX|OsPCL1	LUX ARRHYTHMO Interacts With ELF3a and ELF4a to Coordinate Vegetative Growth and Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.	 Unlike OsLUX, loss OsELF4a displayed a marginal influence under short-day (SD) condition, but markedly delayed flowering time under long-day (LD) condition
Ghd7	OsLUX|OsPCL1	The clock component OsLUX regulates rice heading through recruiting OsELF3-1 and OsELF4s to repress Hd1 and Ghd7.	The clock component OsLUX regulates rice heading through recruiting OsELF3-1 and OsELF4s to repress Hd1 and Ghd7.
Hd1	OsLUX|OsPCL1	The clock component OsLUX regulates rice heading through recruiting OsELF3-1 and OsELF4s to repress Hd1 and Ghd7.	The clock component OsLUX regulates rice heading through recruiting OsELF3-1 and OsELF4s to repress Hd1 and Ghd7.

Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	OsLUX|OsPCL1	The clock component OsLUX regulates rice heading through recruiting OsELF3-1 and OsELF4s to repress Hd1 and Ghd7.	 OsLUX forms the OsEC (OsELF4s-OsELF3-1-OsLUX) complex by recruiting OsELF3-1 and OsELF4s, which were required to regulate rice heading
Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	OsLUX|OsPCL1	The clock component OsLUX regulates rice heading through recruiting OsELF3-1 and OsELF4s to repress Hd1 and Ghd7.	 OsELF3-1 contributes to the translocation of OsLUX to the nucleus, and a compromised flowering phenotype results upon mutation of any component of the OsEC complex
