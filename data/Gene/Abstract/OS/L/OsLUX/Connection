OsELF4a	OsLUX|OsPCL1	A clock regulatory module is required for salt tolerance and control of heading date in rice	 Here, we identify a rice ternary repressive protein complex composed of OsELF4a, OsELF3-1 and OsLUX, which was designated as OsEC1 in analogy to a similar complex in Arabidopsis
OsELF4a	OsLUX|OsPCL1	A clock regulatory module is required for salt tolerance and control of heading date in rice	 OsELF4a physically interacts with OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2 in nucleus, whilst OsELF3-1 rather than OsELF3-2 strongly interacts with OsLUX, a Myb-domain containing transcriptional factor

OsELF4a	OsLUX|OsPCL1	LUX ARRHYTHMO Interacts With ELF3a and ELF4a to Coordinate Vegetative Growth and Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.	 OsLUX combined with OsELF4a and OsELF3a or OsELF3b to form two ECs, of which the OsLUX-OsELF3a-OsELF4a was likely the dominant promoter for photoperiodic flowering
OsELF4a	OsLUX|OsPCL1	LUX ARRHYTHMO Interacts With ELF3a and ELF4a to Coordinate Vegetative Growth and Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.	 Unlike OsLUX, loss OsELF4a displayed a marginal influence under short-day (SD) condition, but markedly delayed flowering time under long-day (LD) condition
