OsELF4a	OsLUX|OsPCL1	A clock regulatory module is required for salt tolerance and control of heading date in rice	 Here, we identify a rice ternary repressive protein complex composed of OsELF4a, OsELF3-1 and OsLUX, which was designated as OsEC1 in analogy to a similar complex in Arabidopsis
OsELF4a	OsLUX|OsPCL1	A clock regulatory module is required for salt tolerance and control of heading date in rice	 OsELF4a physically interacts with OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2 in nucleus, whilst OsELF3-1 rather than OsELF3-2 strongly interacts with OsLUX, a Myb-domain containing transcriptional factor
