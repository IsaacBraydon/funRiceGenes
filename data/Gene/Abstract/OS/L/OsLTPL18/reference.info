NA	Lipid transfer protein, OsLTPL18, is essential for grain weight and seed germination in rice.	2023	Gene	School of Basic Medical Science, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China.	Nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) promote the intermembrane transportation of phospholipids, fatty acids, and steroids, and play diverse roles in various biological processes. However, the potential roles of the rice nsLTPs have not been well elucidated yet. Here, the functions of OsLTPL18 were analyzed using CRISPR/Cas9 strategy and cytological analysis. The osltpl18 (osltpl18-1, osltpl18-2, and osltpl18-3) seeds were thinner, and 1000-grain weight and grain thickness of osltpl18 plants were decreased obviously, compared to the ZH11. Meanwhile, the results of germination assay and 1Â % TTC staining showed that vigor of osltpl18 seeds decreased significantly. Furthermore, the results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the cell width of spikelet hull in osltpl18 lines was significantly reduced than that in WT, as well as cell number in grain-width direction. Finally, we found that co-expressed genes were enriched in glucan biosynthesis, protein transporter activity, serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity, and nutrient reservoir activity. In this study, we discussed that OsLTPL18 might have coordinating functions in regulation of grain weight and germination in rice.
