OsLTPL18	spikelet	Lipid transfer protein, OsLTPL18, is essential for grain weight and seed germination in rice.	 Furthermore, the results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the cell width of spikelet hull in osltpl18 lines was significantly reduced than that in WT, as well as cell number in grain-width direction
OsLTPL18	grain	Lipid transfer protein, OsLTPL18, is essential for grain weight and seed germination in rice.	 The osltpl18 (osltpl18-1, osltpl18-2, and osltpl18-3) seeds were thinner, and 1000-grain weight and grain thickness of osltpl18 plants were decreased obviously, compared to the ZH11
OsLTPL18	grain	Lipid transfer protein, OsLTPL18, is essential for grain weight and seed germination in rice.	 In this study, we discussed that OsLTPL18 might have coordinating functions in regulation of grain weight and germination in rice
