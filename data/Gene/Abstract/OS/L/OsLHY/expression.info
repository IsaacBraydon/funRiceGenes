Symbol	Expression
OsLHY	 OsPRR73 bound to the promoters of the floral gene Ehd1 and the circadian gene OsLHY, and significantly suppressed their expression at dawn
OsLHY	 Global transcriptome profiling and expression analyses revealed that OsLHY might be a vital circadian rhythm component
OsLHY	 In the oslhy mutant, the diurnal expression of circadian clock-related genes was seriously affected under both LD and SD conditions |  Furthermore, the expression of the flowering activators Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 was down-regulated and flowering repressors Hd1 and Ghd7 was up-regulated in the oslhy mutant under LD conditions
