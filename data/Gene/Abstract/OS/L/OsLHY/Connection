Hd6|CK2	OsLHY	The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution	This lack of control of the circadian clock by Hd6 CK2alpha might be due to the presence of glutamate in OsLHY (a CCA1 ortholog in rice) instead of the serine at the corresponding CK2 target site in CCA1
Hd6|CK2	OsLHY	The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution	We also demonstrated that the other conserved CK2 target sites in OsLHY conferred robust rhythmic expression of OsLHY-LUC under diurnal conditions
OsLHY	OsPRR1	The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution	However, this glutamate is critical for the control of the OsPRR1 gene (a rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis TOC1/PRR1 gene) by OsLHY for regulation of the circadian clock
OsCCT11|OsPRR73	OsLHY	The transcriptional repressor OsPRR73 links circadian clock and photoperiod pathway to control heading date in rice	 OsPRR73 bound to the promoters of the floral gene Ehd1 and the circadian gene OsLHY, and significantly suppressed their expression at dawn
OsCCT11|OsPRR73	OsLHY	The transcriptional repressor OsPRR73 links circadian clock and photoperiod pathway to control heading date in rice	 In LL and DD, the oscillatory patterns of the circadian genes OsLHY, OsTOC1, OsGI and OsELF3 were varied in OsPRR73OX and osprr73 mutants
Ehd1	OsLHY	The transcriptional repressor OsPRR73 links circadian clock and photoperiod pathway to control heading date in rice	 OsPRR73 bound to the promoters of the floral gene Ehd1 and the circadian gene OsLHY, and significantly suppressed their expression at dawn
Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	OsLHY	The transcriptional repressor OsPRR73 links circadian clock and photoperiod pathway to control heading date in rice	 In LL and DD, the oscillatory patterns of the circadian genes OsLHY, OsTOC1, OsGI and OsELF3 were varied in OsPRR73OX and osprr73 mutants
OsGI	OsLHY	The transcriptional repressor OsPRR73 links circadian clock and photoperiod pathway to control heading date in rice	 In LL and DD, the oscillatory patterns of the circadian genes OsLHY, OsTOC1, OsGI and OsELF3 were varied in OsPRR73OX and osprr73 mutants
Hd1	OsLHY	Dual function of clock component OsLHY sets critical day length for photoperiodic flowering in rice	 Additionally, the dual function of OsLHY entirely relied on Hd1, as the double mutant oslhy hd1 showed the same heading date with hd1 under about 11
Hd1	OsLHY	Dual function of clock component OsLHY sets critical day length for photoperiodic flowering in rice	 Together, OsLHY could fine-tune the CDL by directly regulating OsGI, and Hd1 acts as the final effector of CDL downstream of OsLHY
OsGI	OsLHY	Dual function of clock component OsLHY sets critical day length for photoperiodic flowering in rice	 Subsequent one-hybrid assays in yeast, DNA affinity purification qPCR, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed OsLHY could directly bind to the CBS element in OsGI promoter
OsGI	OsLHY	Dual function of clock component OsLHY sets critical day length for photoperiodic flowering in rice	 Moreover, the critical day length (CDL) for function reversal of OsLHY in oslhy (11-12 h) was prolonged in the double mutant oslhy osgi (about 13
OsGI	OsLHY	Dual function of clock component OsLHY sets critical day length for photoperiodic flowering in rice	5 h), indicating that the CDL set by OsLHY was OsGI dependent
