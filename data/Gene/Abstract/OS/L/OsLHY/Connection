Hd6|CK2	OsLHY	The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution	This lack of control of the circadian clock by Hd6 CK2alpha might be due to the presence of glutamate in OsLHY (a CCA1 ortholog in rice) instead of the serine at the corresponding CK2 target site in CCA1
