Hd6|CK2	OsLHY	The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution	 This lack of control of the circadian clock by Hd6 CK2alpha might be due to the presence of glutamate in OsLHY (a CCA1 ortholog in rice) instead of the serine at the corresponding CK2 target site in CCA1
Hd6|CK2	OsLHY	The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution	 We also demonstrated that the other conserved CK2 target sites in OsLHY conferred robust rhythmic expression of OsLHY-LUC under diurnal conditions
OsLHY	OsPRR1	The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution	 However, this glutamate is critical for the control of the OsPRR1 gene (a rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis TOC1/PRR1 gene) by OsLHY for regulation of the circadian clock
