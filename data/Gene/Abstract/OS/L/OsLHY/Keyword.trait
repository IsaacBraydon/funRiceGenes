OsLHY	development	The Rice Circadian Clock Regulates Tiller Growth and Panicle Development Through Strigolactone Signaling and Sugar Sensing	 OsCCA1 also regulates IPA1 expression to mediate panicle and grain development
OsLHY	panicle	The Rice Circadian Clock Regulates Tiller Growth and Panicle Development Through Strigolactone Signaling and Sugar Sensing	 OsCCA1 also regulates IPA1 expression to mediate panicle and grain development
OsLHY	grain	The Rice Circadian Clock Regulates Tiller Growth and Panicle Development Through Strigolactone Signaling and Sugar Sensing	 OsCCA1 also regulates IPA1 expression to mediate panicle and grain development
OsLHY	tiller	The Rice Circadian Clock Regulates Tiller Growth and Panicle Development Through Strigolactone Signaling and Sugar Sensing	 Downregulating and overexpressing OsCCA1 increases and reduces tiller numbers, respectively, whereas manipulating PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATOR1 (OsPPR1) expression results in the opposite effects
OsLHY	tiller	The Rice Circadian Clock Regulates Tiller Growth and Panicle Development Through Strigolactone Signaling and Sugar Sensing	 Genetic analyses using double mutants and overexpression in the mutants show that OsTB1, D14, and IPA1 act downstream of OsCCA1 Sugars repress OsCCA1 expression in roots and tiller buds to promote tiller-bud outgrowth
OsLHY	tiller number	The Rice Circadian Clock Regulates Tiller Growth and Panicle Development Through Strigolactone Signaling and Sugar Sensing	 Downregulating and overexpressing OsCCA1 increases and reduces tiller numbers, respectively, whereas manipulating PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATOR1 (OsPPR1) expression results in the opposite effects
