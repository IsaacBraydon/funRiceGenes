OsLHY	development	The Rice Circadian Clock Regulates Tiller Growth and Panicle Development Through Strigolactone Signaling and Sugar Sensing	 OsCCA1 also regulates IPA1 expression to mediate panicle and grain development
OsLHY	panicle	The Rice Circadian Clock Regulates Tiller Growth and Panicle Development Through Strigolactone Signaling and Sugar Sensing	 OsCCA1 also regulates IPA1 expression to mediate panicle and grain development
OsLHY	grain	The Rice Circadian Clock Regulates Tiller Growth and Panicle Development Through Strigolactone Signaling and Sugar Sensing	 OsCCA1 also regulates IPA1 expression to mediate panicle and grain development
OsLHY	tiller	The Rice Circadian Clock Regulates Tiller Growth and Panicle Development Through Strigolactone Signaling and Sugar Sensing	 Downregulating and overexpressing OsCCA1 increases and reduces tiller numbers, respectively, whereas manipulating PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATOR1 (OsPPR1) expression results in the opposite effects
OsLHY	tiller	The Rice Circadian Clock Regulates Tiller Growth and Panicle Development Through Strigolactone Signaling and Sugar Sensing	 Genetic analyses using double mutants and overexpression in the mutants show that OsTB1, D14, and IPA1 act downstream of OsCCA1 Sugars repress OsCCA1 expression in roots and tiller buds to promote tiller-bud outgrowth
OsLHY	tiller number	The Rice Circadian Clock Regulates Tiller Growth and Panicle Development Through Strigolactone Signaling and Sugar Sensing	 Downregulating and overexpressing OsCCA1 increases and reduces tiller numbers, respectively, whereas manipulating PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATOR1 (OsPPR1) expression results in the opposite effects
OsLHY	heading date	Dual function of clock component OsLHY sets critical day length for photoperiodic flowering in rice	 Additionally, the dual function of OsLHY entirely relied on Hd1, as the double mutant oslhy hd1 showed the same heading date with hd1 under about 11
OsLHY	flowering	Dual function of clock component OsLHY sets critical day length for photoperiodic flowering in rice	Dual function of clock component OsLHY sets critical day length for photoperiodic flowering in rice
OsLHY	flowering	Dual function of clock component OsLHY sets critical day length for photoperiodic flowering in rice	 By MutMap technique, we identified the candidate gene OsLHY from a later flowering mutant lem1 and further confirmed it through genetic complementation, RNA interference knockdown, and CRISPR/Cas9-knockout
OsLHY	flowering	mediated pathways in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Here we showed that CRISPR/Cas9-engineered mutations in OsLHY caused late flowering in rice only under natural long-day (nLD) and short-day (nSD) conditions, but not artificial SD (10 h light/14 h dark) conditions
OsLHY	flowering	mediated pathways in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Furthermore, the expression of the flowering activators Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 was down-regulated and flowering repressors Hd1 and Ghd7 was up-regulated in the oslhy mutant under LD conditions
OsLHY	flowering	mediated pathways in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 These results suggested that the OsLHY can promote rice flowering mainly through regulating Hd1 and Ehd1
