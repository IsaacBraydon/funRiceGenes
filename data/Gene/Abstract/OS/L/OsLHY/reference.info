Plant Cell Physiol-2003-Murakami-1229-36.pdf	The evolutionarily conserved OsPRR quintet: rice pseudo-response regulators implicated in circadian rhythm	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, School of Agriculture, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, 464-8601 Japan.	In Arabidopsis thaliana, a number of circadian-associated factors have been identified, including TOC1 (TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1) that is believed to be a component of the central oscillator. TOC1 is a member of a small family of proteins, designated as ARABIDOPSIS PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATORS (APRR1/TOC1, APRR3, APRR5, APRR7, and APRR9). As demonstrated previously, these APRR1/TOC1 quintet members are crucial for a better understanding of the molecular links between circadian rhythms, control of flowering time through photoperiodic pathways, and also photosensory signal transduction in this dicotyledonous plant. In this respect, both the dicotyledonous (e.g. A. thaliana) and monocotyledonous (e.g. Oryza sativa) plants might share the evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanism underlying the circadian rhythm. Based on such an assumption, and as the main objective of this study, we asked the question of whether rice also has a set of pseudo-response regulators, and if so, whether or not they are associated with the circadian rhythm. Here we showed that rice has five members of the OsPRR family (Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator), and also that the expressions of these OsPRR genes are under the control of circadian rhythm. They are expressed in a diurnal and sequential manner in the order of OsPRR73 (OsPRR37)-->OsPRR95 (OsPRR59)-->OsPRR1, which is reminiscent of the circadian waves of the APRR1/TOC1 quintet in A. thaliana. These and other results of this study suggested that the OsPRR quintet, including the ortholog of APRR1/TOC1, might play important roles within, or close to, the circadian clock of rice.
pp1520808.pdf	The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution	2010	Plant Physiol	University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan 305-8577.	Casein kinase II (CK2) is a protein kinase with an evolutionarily conserved function as a circadian clock component in several organisms, including the long-day plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The circadian clock component CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) is a CK2 target in Arabidopsis, where it influences photoperiodic flowering. In rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant, Heading date6 (Hd6) encodes a CK2alpha subunit that delays flowering time under long-day conditions. Here, we demonstrate that control of flowering time in rice by the Hd6 CK2alpha subunit requires a functional Hd1 gene (an Arabidopsis CONSTANS ortholog) and is independent of the circadian clock mechanism. Our findings from overexpressing the dominant-negative CK2 allele in rice support the independence of CK2 function from the circadian clock. This lack of control of the circadian clock by Hd6 CK2alpha might be due to the presence of glutamate in OsLHY (a CCA1 ortholog in rice) instead of the serine at the corresponding CK2 target site in CCA1. However, this glutamate is critical for the control of the OsPRR1 gene (a rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis TOC1/PRR1 gene) by OsLHY for regulation of the circadian clock. We also demonstrated that the other conserved CK2 target sites in OsLHY conferred robust rhythmic expression of OsLHY-LUC under diurnal conditions. These findings imply that the role of CK2 in flowering-time regulation in higher plants has diversified during evolution.
