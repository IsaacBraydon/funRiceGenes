Plant Cell Physiol-2003-Murakami-1229-36.pdf	The evolutionarily conserved OsPRR quintet: rice pseudo-response regulators implicated in circadian rhythm	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, School of Agriculture, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, 464-8601 Japan.	In Arabidopsis thaliana, a number of circadian-associated factors have been identified, including TOC1 (TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1) that is believed to be a component of the central oscillator. TOC1 is a member of a small family of proteins, designated as ARABIDOPSIS PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATORS (APRR1/TOC1, APRR3, APRR5, APRR7, and APRR9). As demonstrated previously, these APRR1/TOC1 quintet members are crucial for a better understanding of the molecular links between circadian rhythms, control of flowering time through photoperiodic pathways, and also photosensory signal transduction in this dicotyledonous plant. In this respect, both the dicotyledonous (e.g. A. thaliana) and monocotyledonous (e.g. Oryza sativa) plants might share the evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanism underlying the circadian rhythm. Based on such an assumption, and as the main objective of this study, we asked the question of whether rice also has a set of pseudo-response regulators, and if so, whether or not they are associated with the circadian rhythm. Here we showed that rice has five members of the OsPRR family (Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator), and also that the expressions of these OsPRR genes are under the control of circadian rhythm. They are expressed in a diurnal and sequential manner in the order of OsPRR73 (OsPRR37)-->OsPRR95 (OsPRR59)-->OsPRR1, which is reminiscent of the circadian waves of the APRR1/TOC1 quintet in A. thaliana. These and other results of this study suggested that the OsPRR quintet, including the ortholog of APRR1/TOC1, might play important roles within, or close to, the circadian clock of rice.
pp1520808.pdf	The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution	2010	Plant Physiol	University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan 305-8577.	Casein kinase II (CK2) is a protein kinase with an evolutionarily conserved function as a circadian clock component in several organisms, including the long-day plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The circadian clock component CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) is a CK2 target in Arabidopsis, where it influences photoperiodic flowering. In rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant, Heading date6 (Hd6) encodes a CK2alpha subunit that delays flowering time under long-day conditions. Here, we demonstrate that control of flowering time in rice by the Hd6 CK2alpha subunit requires a functional Hd1 gene (an Arabidopsis CONSTANS ortholog) and is independent of the circadian clock mechanism. Our findings from overexpressing the dominant-negative CK2 allele in rice support the independence of CK2 function from the circadian clock. This lack of control of the circadian clock by Hd6 CK2alpha might be due to the presence of glutamate in OsLHY (a CCA1 ortholog in rice) instead of the serine at the corresponding CK2 target site in CCA1. However, this glutamate is critical for the control of the OsPRR1 gene (a rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis TOC1/PRR1 gene) by OsLHY for regulation of the circadian clock. We also demonstrated that the other conserved CK2 target sites in OsLHY conferred robust rhythmic expression of OsLHY-LUC under diurnal conditions. These findings imply that the role of CK2 in flowering-time regulation in higher plants has diversified during evolution.
NA	The Rice Circadian Clock Regulates Tiller Growth and Panicle Development Through Strigolactone Signaling and Sugar Sensing	2020	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Circadian clocks regulate growth and development in plants and animals, but the role of circadian regulation in crop production is poorly understood. Rice (Oryza sativa) grain yield is largely determined by tillering, which is mediated by physiological and genetic factors. Here we report a regulatory loop that involves the circadian clock, sugar, and strigolactone (SL) pathway to regulate rice tiller-bud and panicle development. Rice CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (OsCCA1) positively regulates expression of TEOSINTE BRANCHED1 (OsTB1, also known as FC1), DWARF14 (D14), and IDEAL PLANT ARCHITECTURE1 (IPA1, also known as OsSPL14) to repress tiller-bud outgrowth. Downregulating and overexpressing OsCCA1 increases and reduces tiller numbers, respectively, whereas manipulating PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATOR1 (OsPPR1) expression results in the opposite effects. OsCCA1 also regulates IPA1 expression to mediate panicle and grain development. Genetic analyses using double mutants and overexpression in the mutants show that OsTB1, D14, and IPA1 act downstream of OsCCA1 Sugars repress OsCCA1 expression in roots and tiller buds to promote tiller-bud outgrowth. The circadian clock integrates sugar responses and the SL pathway to regulate tiller and panicle development, providing insights into improving plant architecture and yield in rice and other cereal crops.
NA	Nitrogen Mediates Flowering Time and Nitrogen Use Efficiency via Floral Regulators in Rice	2020	Curr Biol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	High nitrogen (N) fertilization for maximizing crop yield commonly leads to postponed flowering time (heading date in rice) and ripening, thus affecting resources use efficiency and followed planting time. We found that N-mediated heading date-1 (Nhd1) can directly activate florigen gene OsHd3a in rice. Inactivation of either Nhd1 or OsHd3a results in delay and insensitivity to N supply of flowering time. Knockout of Nhd1 increases N uptake and utilization efficiency at low-to-moderate N level under both short- and long-day field conditions. Increasing glutamine, the product of N assimilation, can upregulate expression of Nhd1, which in turn downregulates OsFd-GOGAT expression and OsFd-GOGAT activity, displaying a Nhd1-controlled negative feedback regulatory pathway of N assimilation. Moreover, N fertilization effect on rice flowering time shows genetically controlled diversity, and single-nucleotide polymorphism in Nhd1 promoter may relate to different responses of flowering time to N application. Nhd1 thus balances flowering time and N use efficiency in addition to photoperiod in rice.
