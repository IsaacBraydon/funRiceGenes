MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in plant responses to pathogen infections. Rice is the major staple food worldwide, and the rice blast disease is the most important disease of rice. To explore the miRNA species participating in rice immunity against the rice blast disease, we compared small RNA expression between mock- and Magnaporthe oryzae-treated rice. We found that infection by M. oryzae strain Guy11 specifically induced rice miR319 expression, and consequently suppressed its target gene, OsTCP21 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PCF), which encodes a transcription factor. By using miR319b-OE and OsTCP21-Res (resistant to miR319-mediated silencing) transgenic rice, we found that OsTCP21 is a positive regulator of rice defense response against the blast disease. When rice was infected by Guy11, or in the miR319b-OE rice, multiple Jasmonic acid (JA) synthetic and signaling components were suppressed, indicating Guy11 suppresses the JA signaling through inducing miR319. In particular, we found that LIPOXYGENASE 2 (LOX2) and LOX5 were specifically suppressed by miR319 or by Guy11 infection. LOXs are the key enzymes of JA synthesis, which catalyzes the conversion of ¦Á-linoleic acid (LnA) to hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid (HPODE). LnA application rescued disease symptoms on the OsTCP21-Res but not wild-type rice, supporting our hypothesis that OsLOX2 and OsLOX5 were the key JA synthetic genes hijacked by Guy11. Taking this advantage, Guy11 can subvert the host immunity and facilitates pathogenicity. We propose that induced expression of OsLOX2/5 (e.g., miR319:: OsLOX2/5 transgenic rice) would be a potential resolution of the rice blast disease.
