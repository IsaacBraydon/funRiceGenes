OsLHCB3	tillering	Physiological and transcriptomic analysis of OsLHCB3 knockdown lines in rice.	 Phenotypic analyses showed that OsLHCB3 knockdown led to pale green leaves and lower chlorophyll contents at both tillering and heading stages
OsLHCB3	photosynthesis	Physiological and transcriptomic analysis of OsLHCB3 knockdown lines in rice.	 Overall, these results suggest that OsLHCB3 also plays vital roles in regulating photosynthesis and antenna proteins in rice as well as responses to environment stresses
OsLHCB3	chlorophyll	Physiological and transcriptomic analysis of OsLHCB3 knockdown lines in rice.	 Phenotypic analyses showed that OsLHCB3 knockdown led to pale green leaves and lower chlorophyll contents at both tillering and heading stages
OsLHCB3	chlorophyll	Physiological and transcriptomic analysis of OsLHCB3 knockdown lines in rice.	 Besides, our transcriptomic and physiological data indicated that OsLHCB3 was essential for binding chlorophyll, but not for the metabolism of chlorophyll in rice
OsLHCB3	chlorophyll content	Physiological and transcriptomic analysis of OsLHCB3 knockdown lines in rice.	 Phenotypic analyses showed that OsLHCB3 knockdown led to pale green leaves and lower chlorophyll contents at both tillering and heading stages
