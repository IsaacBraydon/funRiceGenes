GRID: grid.463053.7. ISNI: 0000 0000 9655 6126	The photosystem II (PSII) outer antenna LHCB3 protein plays critical roles in distributing the excitation energy and modulating the rate of state transition for photosynthesis. Here, OsLHCB3 knockdown mutants were produced using the RNAi system. Phenotypic analyses showed that OsLHCB3 knockdown led to pale green leaves and lower chlorophyll contents at both tillering and heading stages. In addition, mutant lines exhibited decreased non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) capacity and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) by downregulating the expression of PSII-related genes. Moreover, RNA-seq experiments were performed at both tillering and heading stages. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) mainly involved in chlorophyll binding response to abscisic acid, photosystem II, response to chitin, and DNA-binding transcription factor. Besides, our transcriptomic and physiological data indicated that OsLHCB3 was essential for binding chlorophyll, but not for the metabolism of chlorophyll in rice. OsLHCB3 RNAi knockdown plants affected the expression of PS II-related genes, but not PS I-related genes. Overall, these results suggest that OsLHCB3 also plays vital roles in regulating photosynthesis and antenna proteins in rice as well as responses to environment stresses.
