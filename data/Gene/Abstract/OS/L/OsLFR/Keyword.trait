OsLFR	development	OsLFR is essential for early endosperm and embryo development by interacting with SWI/SNF complex members in Oryza sativa	OsLFR is essential for early endosperm and embryo development by interacting with SWI/SNF complex members in Oryza sativa
OsLFR	seed	OsLFR is essential for early endosperm and embryo development by interacting with SWI/SNF complex members in Oryza sativa	 OsLFR depletion resulted in homozygous lethality in the early seed stage through endosperm and embryo defects, which could be successfully recovered by the OsLFR genomic sequence
OsLFR	seed	OsLFR is essential for early endosperm and embryo development by interacting with SWI/SNF complex members in Oryza sativa	 Transcriptome profiling showed that many genes, involved in DNA replication, cell cycle, cell wall assembly and cell death, were differentially expressed in a knockout mutant of OsLFR (oslfr-1), which was consistent with the observed seed defects
OsLFR	cell death	OsLFR is essential for early endosperm and embryo development by interacting with SWI/SNF complex members in Oryza sativa	 Cytological observations revealed that the oslfr endosperm had relatively fewer free nuclei, had abnormal and arrested cellularization, and demonstrated premature programed cell death: the embryo was reduced in size and failed to differentiate
OsLFR	cell death	OsLFR is essential for early endosperm and embryo development by interacting with SWI/SNF complex members in Oryza sativa	 Transcriptome profiling showed that many genes, involved in DNA replication, cell cycle, cell wall assembly and cell death, were differentially expressed in a knockout mutant of OsLFR (oslfr-1), which was consistent with the observed seed defects
OsLFR	R protein	OsLFR is essential for early endosperm and embryo development by interacting with SWI/SNF complex members in Oryza sativa	 OsLFR was expressed primarily in the rice spikelets and seeds, and the OsLFR protein was localized to the nucleus
OsLFR	nucleus	OsLFR is essential for early endosperm and embryo development by interacting with SWI/SNF complex members in Oryza sativa	 OsLFR was expressed primarily in the rice spikelets and seeds, and the OsLFR protein was localized to the nucleus
OsLFR	cell wall	OsLFR is essential for early endosperm and embryo development by interacting with SWI/SNF complex members in Oryza sativa	 Transcriptome profiling showed that many genes, involved in DNA replication, cell cycle, cell wall assembly and cell death, were differentially expressed in a knockout mutant of OsLFR (oslfr-1), which was consistent with the observed seed defects
