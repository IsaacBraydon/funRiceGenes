NA	A chloroplast-localized protein LESION AND LAMINA BENDING affects defence and growth responses in rice.	2016	New Phytol	Iwate Biotechnology Research Center, Iwate, 024-003, Japan.	Understanding how plants allocate their resources to growth or defence is of long-term importance to the development of new and improved varieties of different crops. Using molecular genetics, plant physiology, hormone analysis and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based transcript profiling, we have isolated and characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) LESION AND LAMINA BENDING (LLB) gene that encodes a chloroplast-targeted putative leucine carboxyl methyltransferase. Loss of LLB function results in reduced growth and yield, hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesions, accumulation of the antimicrobial compounds momilactones and phytocassanes, and constitutive expression of pathogenesis-related genes. Consistent with these defence-associated responses, llb shows enhanced resistance to rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae) and bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae). The lesion and resistance phenotypes are likely to be caused by the over-accumulation of jasmonates (JAs) in the llb mutant including the JA precursor 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid. Additionally, llb shows an increased lamina inclination and enhanced early seedling growth due to elevated brassinosteroid (BR) synthesis and/or signalling. These findings show that LLB functions in the chloroplast to either directly or indirectly repress both JA- and BR-mediated responses, revealing a possible mechanism for controlling how plants allocate resources for defence and growth.
NA	Premature leaf senescence 3, encoding a methyltransferase, is required for melatonin biosynthesis in rice.	2018	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China, National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, China.	Premature leaf senescence in rice is one of the most common factors affecting the plant's development and yield. Although methyltransferases are involved in diverse biological functions, their roles in rice leaf senescence have not been previously reported. In this study, we identified the premature leaf senescence 3 (pls3) mutant in rice, which led to early leaf senescence and early heading date. Further investigations revealed that premature leaf senescence was triggered by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using physiological analysis, we found that chlorophyll content was reduced in the pls3 mutant leaves, while hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were elevated. Consistent with these findings, the pls3 mutant exhibited hypersensitivity to exogenous hydrogen peroxide. The expression of other senescence-associated genes such as Osh36 and RCCR1 was increased in the pls3 mutant. Positional cloning indicated the pls3 phenotype was the result of a mutation in OsMTS1, which encodes a O-methyltransferase in the melatonin biosynthetic pathway. Functional complementation of OsMTS1 in pls3 completely restored the wild-type phenotype. We found leaf melatonin content to be dramatically reduced in pls3 and that exogenous application of melatonin recovered the pls3 mutant's leaf senescence phenotype to levels comparable to that of wild-type rice. Moreover, overexpression of OsMTS1 in the wild-type plant increased the grain yield by 15.9%. Our results demonstrate that disruption of OsMTS1, which codes for a methyltransferase, can trigger leaf senescence as a result of decreased melatonin production.
