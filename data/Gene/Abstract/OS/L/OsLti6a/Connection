OsLti6a	OsLti6b|ddOs32	Characterization of two plasma membrane protein 3 genes (PutPMP3) from the alkali grass, Puccinellia tenuiflora, and functional comparison of the rice homologues, OsLti6a/b from rice	 To compare the functions of PutPMP3-1 and PutPMP3-2, the orthologous genes in rice (OsLti6a and OsLti6b) were isolated
OsLti6a	OsLti6b|ddOs32	Characterization of two plasma membrane protein 3 genes (PutPMP3) from the alkali grass, Puccinellia tenuiflora, and functional comparison of the rice homologues, OsLti6a/b from rice	 Both OsLti6a and OsLti6b could functionally complement the loss of PMP3 in yeast
OsLti6a	OsLti6b|ddOs32	Characterization of two plasma membrane protein 3 genes (PutPMP3) from the alkali grass, Puccinellia tenuiflora, and functional comparison of the rice homologues, OsLti6a/b from rice	 PutPMP3-2 and OsLti6a were more effective in reversing membrane hyperpolarization than PutPMP3-1 and OsLti6b
OsLti6a	OsLti6b|ddOs32	The OsLti6 genes encoding low-molecular-weight membrane proteins are differentially expressed in rice cultivars with contrasting sensitivity to low temperature	 Two closely related genes (OsLti6a, OsLti6b), which are induced by low temperature during seedling emergence were isolated from a cold tolerant temperate japonica rice cultivar
