Two full-length cDNAs, PutPMP3-1 and PutPMP3-2, encoding PMP3 family proteins were isolated from Puccinellia tenuiflora, a monocotyledonous halophyte. Expression of both genes was induced by low temperature, salt stress, dehydration, ABA, and NaHCO(3). Transcripts of PutPMP3-2 were more strongly induced by these stresses relative to those of PutPMP3-1, particularly under low temperature and dehydration conditions. Expression of PutPMP3-1 and PutPMP3-2 in yeast mutants lacking the PMP3 gene can functionally complement the membrane hyperpolarization and salt sensitivity phenotypes resulting from PMP3 deletion. To compare the functions of PutPMP3-1 and PutPMP3-2, the orthologous genes in rice (OsLti6a and OsLti6b) were isolated. Both OsLti6a and OsLti6b could functionally complement the loss of PMP3 in yeast. PutPMP3-2 and OsLti6a were more effective in reversing membrane hyperpolarization than PutPMP3-1 and OsLti6b. However, the four yeast transformants each showed similar levels of salt tolerance. These results imply that these PMP3 family members don't function identically under different stress tolerance conditions.
1-s2.0-S0378111904005815-main.pdf	The OsLti6 genes encoding low-molecular-weight membrane proteins are differentially expressed in rice cultivars with contrasting sensitivity to low temperature	2005	Gene	Department of Crop, Soil and Environmental Sciences, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701, USA.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is sensitive to chilling particularly at early stages of seedling establishment. Two closely related genes (OsLti6a, OsLti6b), which are induced by low temperature during seedling emergence were isolated from a cold tolerant temperate japonica rice cultivar. These genes are closely related to the Arabidopsis rare cold-inducible (RCI2) and barley low-temperature-inducible (BLT101) genes. Based on direct biochemical and indirect physiological evidence and similarity with a conserved protein domain in the Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) database (e.g., yeast PMP3), the rice genes belong to a class of low-molecular-weight hydrophobic proteins involved in maintaining the integrity of the plasma membrane during cold, dehydration and salt stress conditions. Both genes exhibit a genotype-specific expression signature characterized by early and late stress-inducible expression in tolerant and intolerant genotypes, respectively. The differences in temporal expression profiles are consistent with cultivar differences in cold-induced membrane leakiness and seedling vigor. The presence of CRT/DRE promoter cis-elements is consistent with the synchronized expression of OsLti6 genes with the C-repeat binding factor/drought responsive element-binding protein (CBF/DREB) transcriptional activator. The present results indicate that the Oslti6 genes are part of a battery of cold stress defense-related genes regulated by a common switch.
