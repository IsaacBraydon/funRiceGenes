NA	A novel senescence-associated gene encoding gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA):pyruvate transaminase is upregulated during rice leaf senescence	2004	Physiologia Plantarum	Institute of Botany, Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taipei, Taiwan	The gene Osl2, which is specifically upregulated during leaf senescence in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Tainong 67), was cloned and functionally characterized. The protein coding region of the gene consists of 19 exons encoding 516 amino acids, with a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence and conserved sequence of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-binding domain. The recombinant Osl2 fusion protein over-expressed in Escherichia coli displays pyruvate-dependent gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase (EC 2.6.1.19) activity. Examination of the expression patterns of the Osl2 gene in rice reveals that Osl2-specific transcripts are induced in the senescing leaves. The temporal profile of Osl2 protein accumulation is correlated with that of pyruvate-dependent GABA transaminase activity in rice leaves, with the highest expression level at the S3 senescent stage. The potential role for GABA transaminase during rice leaf senescence is discussed.
