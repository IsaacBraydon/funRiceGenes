Plant metabolomics developed as a powerful tool to examine gene functions and to gain deeper insight into the physiology of the plant cell. In this study, we screened Arabidopsis lines overexpressing rice full-length (FL) cDNAs (rice FOX Arabidopsis lines) using a gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS)-based technique to identify rice genes that caused metabolic changes. This screening system allows fast and reliable identification of candidate lines showing altered metabolite profiles. We performed metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis of a rice FOX Arabidopsis line that harbored the FL cDNA of the rice ortholog of the Lateral Organ Boundaries (LOB) Domain (LBD)/Asymmetric Leaves2-like (ASL) gene of Arabidopsis, At-LBD37/ASL39. The investigated rice FOX Arabidopsis line showed prominent changes in the levels of metabolites related to nitrogen metabolism. The transcriptomic data as well as the results from the metabolite analysis of the Arabidopsis At-LBD37/ASL39-overexpressor plants were consistent with these findings. Furthermore, the metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis of the Os-LBD37/ASL39-overexpressing rice plants indicated that Os-LBD37/ASL39 is associated with processes related to nitrogen metabolism in rice. Thus, the combination of a metabolomics-based screening method and a gain-of-function approach is useful for rapid characterization of novel genes in both Arabidopsis and rice.
