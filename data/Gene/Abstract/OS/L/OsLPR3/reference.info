Phosphorus (P), an essential macronutrient, is often limiting in soils and affects plant growth and development. In Arabidopsis thaliana, Low Phosphate Root1 (LPR1) and its close paralog LPR2 encode multicopper oxidases (MCOs). They regulate meristem responses of root system to phosphate (Pi) deficiency. However, the roles of LPR gene family in rice (Oryza sativa) in maintaining Pi homeostasis have not been elucidated as yet.Here, the identification and expression analysis for the homologs of LPR1/2 in rice were carried out. Five homologs, hereafter referred to as OsLPR1-5, were identified in rice, which are distributed on chromosome1 over a range of 65<U+00A0>kb. Phylogenetic analysis grouped OsLPR1/3/4/5 and OsLPR2 into two distinct sub-clades with OsLPR3 and 5 showing close proximity. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed higher expression levels of OsLPR3-5 and OsLPR2 in root and shoot, respectively. Deficiencies of different nutrients ie, P, nitrogen (N), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and iron (Fe) exerted differential and partially overlapping effects on the relative expression levels of the members of OsLPR family. Pi deficiency (-P) triggered significant increases in the relative expression levels of OsLPR3 and 5. Strong induction in the relative expression levels of OsLPR3 and 5 in osphr2 suggested their negative transcriptional regulation by OsPHR2. Further, the expression levels of OsLPR3 and 5 were either attenuated in ossiz1 and ospho2 or augmented in rice overexpressing OsSPX1.The results from this study provided insights into the evolutionary expansion and a likely functional divergence of OsLPR family with potential roles of OsLPR3 and 5 in the maintenance of Pi homeostasis in rice.
NA	Mutation of OsLPR3 Enhances Tolerance to Phosphate Starvation in Rice.	2023	Int J Mol Sci	Center for Crop Biotechnology, College of Agriculture, Anhui Science and Technology University, Fengyang 233100, China.	Low Phosphate Root (LPR) encodes a protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cell wall. This gene plays a key role in responding to phosphate (Pi) deprivation, especially in remodeling the root system architecture (RSA). An identification and expression analysis of the OsLPR family in rice (Oryza sativa) has been previously reported, and OsLPR5, functioning in Pi uptake and translocation, is required for the normal growth and development of rice. However, the role of OsLPR3, one of the five members of this family in rice, in response to Pi deficiency and/or in the regulation of plant growth and development is unknown. Therefore, in this study, the roles of OsLPR3 in these processes were investigated, and some functions were found to differ between OsLPR3 and OsLPR5. OsLPR3 was found to be induced in the leaf blades, leaf sheaths, and roots under Pi deprivation. OsLPR3 overexpression strongly inhibited the growth and development of the rice but did not affect the Pi homeostasis of the plant. However, oslpr3 mutants improved RSA and Pi utilization, and they exhibited a higher tolerance to low Pi stress in rice. The agronomic traits of the oslpr3 mutants, such as 1000-grain weight and seed length, were stimulated under Pi-sufficient conditions, indicating that OsLPR3 plays roles different from those of OsLPR5 during plant growth and development, as well as in the maintenance of the Pi status of rice.
