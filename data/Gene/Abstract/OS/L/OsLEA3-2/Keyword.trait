OsLEA3-2	drought tolerance	"OsLEA3-2, an abiotic stress induced gene of rice plays a key role in salt and drought tolerance"	"OsLEA3-2, an abiotic stress induced gene of rice plays a key role in salt and drought tolerance"
OsLEA3-2	growth	OsLEA3-2, an abiotic stress induced gene of rice plays a key role in salt and drought tolerance	 The coding protein localizes to the nucleus and overexpression of OsLEA3-2 in yeast improved growth performance compared with control under salt- and osmotic-stress conditions
OsLEA3-2	salt	"OsLEA3-2, an abiotic stress induced gene of rice plays a key role in salt and drought tolerance"	" The coding protein localizes to the nucleus and overexpression of OsLEA3-2 in yeast improved growth performance compared with control under salt- and osmotic-stress conditions|OsLEA3-2, an abiotic stress induced gene of rice plays a key role in salt and drought tolerance"
OsLEA3-2	abiotic stress	"OsLEA3-2, an abiotic stress induced gene of rice plays a key role in salt and drought tolerance"	" OsLEA3-2 was found to be only expressed in the embryo and can be induced by abiotic stresses| These results indicated that OsLEA3-2 plays an important role in tolerance to abiotic stresses|OsLEA3-2, an abiotic stress induced gene of rice plays a key role in salt and drought tolerance"
