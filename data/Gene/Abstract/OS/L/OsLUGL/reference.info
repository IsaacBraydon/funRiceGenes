Specification of floral organ identity is critical for floral morphology and inflorescence architecture. Floral organ identity in plants is controlled by floral homeotic A/B/C/D/E-class genes. Although multiple genes regulate floral organogenesis, our understanding of the regulatory network remains fragmentary. Here, we characterized a rice floral organ gene KAIKOUXIAO (KKX), mutation of which produces an uncharacteristic open hull, abnormal seed and semi-sterility. KKX encodes a putative LEUNIG-like (LUGL) transcriptional regulator OsLUGL. OsLUGL is preferentially expressed in young panicles and its protein can interact with OsSEU, which functions were reported as an adaptor for LEUNIG. OsLUGL-OsSEU functions together as a transcriptional co-regulatory complex to control organ identity. SEP3 (such as OsMADS8) and AP1 (such as OsMADS18) serve as the DNA-binding partner of OsLUGL-OsSEU complex. Further studies indicated that OsMADS8 and OsMADS18 could bind to the promoter of OsGH3-8. The altered expression of OsGH3-8 might cause the increased auxin level and the decreased expression of OsARFs. Overall, our results demonstrate a possible pathway whereby OsLUGL-OsSEU-OsAP1-OsSEP3 complex as a transcriptional co-regulator by targeting the promoter of OsGH3-8, then affecting auxin level, OsARFs expression and thereby influencing floral development. These findings provide a valuable insight into the molecular functions of OsLUGL in rice floral development.
