OsLUGL	OsLUGL is involved in the regulating auxin level and OsARFs expression in rice (Oryza sativa L.). |  Overall, our results demonstrate a possible pathway whereby OsLUGL-OsSEU-OsAP1-OsSEP3 complex as a transcriptional co-regulator by targeting the promoter of OsGH3-8, then affecting auxin level, OsARFs expression and thereby influencing floral development
