OsLHP1	 Loss of OsLHP1 function results in ectopic expression of MIR156B/C/I/E, phenocopy of miR156 overexpression, and reduced H3k27me3 levels at MIR156B/C/I/E |  Genetic and transcriptome analyses of wild-type, miR156b/c-overexpression, and Oslhp1-2 mutant plants suggest that OsLHP1 acts upstream of miR156 and SPL during the juvenile-to-adult transition	 Loss of OsLHP1 function results in ectopic expression of MIR156B/C/I/E, phenocopy of miR156 overexpression, and reduced H3k27me3 levels at MIR156B/C/I/E |  Genetic and transcriptome analyses of wild-type, miR156b/c-overexpression, and Oslhp1-2 mutant plants suggest that OsLHP1 acts upstream of miR156 and SPL during the juvenile-to-adult transition
