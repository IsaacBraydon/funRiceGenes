OsLCD	OsLCT1	Salicylic acid application alleviates cadmium accumulation in brown rice by modulating its shoot to grain translocation in rice	 Furthermore, SA could increase the H2O2 content, activating the SA-signaling pathway and modulating the expression levels of Cd transporters (OsLCT1 and OsLCD) in rice leaves to increase Cd tolerance and reduce Cd accumulation in the rice grain
OsLCD	OsNRAMP5	Generation of low-cadmium rice germplasms via knockout of OsLCD using CRISPR/Cas9.	 We also generated osnramp5 single mutants and oslcd osnramp5 double mutants in the indica background
OsLCD	OsNRAMP5	Generation of low-cadmium rice germplasms via knockout of OsLCD using CRISPR/Cas9.	 In the presence of Cd, Cd concentrations in the brown rice and shoots of oslcd osnramp5 double mutants were significantly decreased compared with WTs as well as osnramp single mutants
OsLCD	OsNRAMP5	Generation of low-cadmium rice germplasms via knockout of OsLCD using CRISPR/Cas9.	 Our results suggested that OsLCD knockout may reduce Cd accumulation alone or in combination with other knockout mutations in a variety of rice genotypes; unlike OsNramp5 mutations, OsLCD knockout did not reduce essential element contents
