The contamination of food crops by cadmium (Cd) is a major concern in food production because it can reduce crop yields and threaten human health. In this study, knockout rice plants (Oryza sativa) tagged with the gene trap vector pGA2707 were screened for Cd tolerance, and the tolerant line lcd was obtained. The lcd mutant showed tolerance to Cd on agar plates and in hydroponic culture during early plant development. Metal concentration measurements in hydroponically grown plants revealed significantly less Cd in the shoots of lcd plants compared with wild-type (WT) shoots. When cultured in the field in soil artificially contaminated with low levels of Cd, lcd showed no significant difference in the Cd content of its leaf blades; however, the Cd concentration in the grains was 55% lower in 2009 and 43% lower in 2010. There were no significant differences in plant dry weight or seed yield between lcd and wild-type plants. LCD, a novel gene, is not homologous to any other known gene. LCD localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus, and was expressed mainly in the vascular tissues in the roots and phloem companion cells in the leaves. These data indicate that lcd may be useful for understanding Cd transport mechanisms and is a promising candidate rice line for use in combating the threat of Cd to human health.
NA	Salicylic acid application alleviates cadmium accumulation in brown rice by modulating its shoot to grain translocation in rice	2021	Chemosphere	Key Laboratory of Marine Food Quality and Hazard Controlling Technology of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, 310018, China. Electronic address: wfj0311@cjlu.edu.cn.	Cadmium (Cd) contamination, which poses a serious threat to human health, has been recognized as a major threat to the agricultural system and crop production. Salicylic acid (SA) is a signaling molecule that plays an important role in against Cd toxicity. Previously, we found that spraying rice with SA could reduce the Cd accumulation in rice grains grown in Cd-contaminated soil. In this study, we studied the specific mechanism of SA spray on reducing Cd accumulation in rice grain. The results showed that treatment with SA could alleviate Cd toxicity in rice by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes that reduce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation, but not by changing the pH, or total or available Cd of the soil. The key factor by which SA treatment reduced Cd accumulation in rice grains was by decreasing the Cd content in rice leaves at the flowering stage. This indicated that SA could modulate the Cd accumulation in shoots, reducing the Cd translocation to rice grains. Furthermore, SA could increase the H2O2 content, activating the SA-signaling pathway and modulating the expression levels of Cd transporters (OsLCT1 and OsLCD) in rice leaves to increase Cd tolerance and reduce Cd accumulation in the rice grain. Thus, spraying rice with SA may be effective measure to cope with Cd contamination in paddy soils.
NA	Generation of low-cadmium rice germplasms via knockout of OsLCD using CRISPR/Cas9.	2022	J Environ Sci (China)	College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.	The OsLCD gene, which has been implicated in cadmium (Cd) accumulation in rice, might be a useful target for CRISPR/Cas9 editing. However, the effects of OsLCD gene editing on Cd accumulation, plant growth, and yield traits remain unknown. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate oslcd single mutants from indica and japonica rice cultivars. We also generated osnramp5 single mutants and oslcd osnramp5 double mutants in the indica background. When grown in Cd-contaminated paddy soils, all oslcd single mutants accumulated less Cd than the wild types (WTs). Consistent with this, oslcd single mutants grown in Cd-contaminated hydroponic culture accumulated significantly less Cd in the shoots as compared to WTs. This decrease in accumulation probably resulted from the reduction of Cd translocation under Cd stress. Oxidative damage also decreased, and plant growth increased in all oslcd single mutant seedlings as compared to WTs in the presence of Cd. Plant growth and most yield traits, as well essential element concentrations in rice seedling shoots, brown rice, and rice straw, were similar between oslcd single mutants and WTs. In the presence of Cd, Cd concentrations in the brown rice and shoots of oslcd osnramp5 double mutants were significantly decreased compared with WTs as well as osnramp single mutants. Our results suggested that OsLCD knockout may reduce Cd accumulation alone or in combination with other knockout mutations in a variety of rice genotypes; unlike OsNramp5 mutations, OsLCD knockout did not reduce essential element contents. Therefore, OsLCD knockout might be used to generate low-Cd rice germplasms.
