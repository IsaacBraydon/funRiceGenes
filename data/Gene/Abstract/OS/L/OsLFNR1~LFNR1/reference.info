Higuchi-Takeuchi-2011-Functional analysis.pdf	Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis	2011	Plant Physiol	Plant Functional Genomics Research Group, RIKEN, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 230-0045, Japan.	Ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase (FNR) mediates electron transfer between ferredoxin (Fd) and NADP(+); therefore, it is a key enzyme that provides the reducing power used in the Calvin cycle. Other than FNR, nitrite reductase, sulfite reductase, glutamate synthase, and Fd-thioredoxin reductase also accept electrons from Fd, an electron carrier protein in the stroma. Therefore, the regulation of electron partitioning in the chloroplast is important for photosynthesis and other metabolic pathways. The regulatory mechanism of electron partitioning, however, remains to be elucidated. We found, by taking advantage of a gain-of-function approach, that expression of two rice (Oryza sativa) full-length cDNAs of leaf-type FNRs (OsLFNR1 and OsLFNR2) led to altered chlorophyll fluorescence and growth in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice. We revealed that overexpression of the OsLFNR1 and OsLFNR2 full-length cDNAs resulted in distinct phenotypes despite the high sequence similarity between them. Expression of OsLFNR1 affected the nitrogen assimilation pathway without inhibition of photosynthesis under normal conditions. On the other hand, OsLFNR2 expression led to the impairment of photosynthetic linear electron transport as well as Fd-dependent cyclic electron flow around photosystem I. The endogenous protein level of OsLFNR was found to be suppressed in both OsLFNR1- and OsLFNR2-overexpressing rice plants, leading to changes in the stoichiometry of the two LFNR isoforms within the thylakoid and soluble fractions. Thus, we propose that the stoichiometry of two LFNR isoforms plays an important role in electron partitioning between carbon fixation and nitrogen assimilation.
NA	LIGHT-INDUCED RICE1 Regulates Light-Dependent Attachment of LEAF-TYPE FERREDOXIN-NADP+ OXIDOREDUCTASE to the Thylakoid Membrane in Rice and Arabidopsis.	2016	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, P.R. China.	LIR1 (LIGHT-INDUCED RICE1) encodes a 13-kD, chloroplast-targeted protein containing two nearly identical motifs of unknown function. LIR1 is present in the genomes of vascular plants, mosses, liverworts, and algae, but not in cyanobacteria. Using coimmunoprecipitation assays, pull-down assays, and yeast two-hybrid analyses, we showed that LIR1 interacts with LEAF-TYPE FERREDOXIN-NADP(+) OXIDOREDUCTASE (LFNR), an essential chloroplast enzyme functioning in the last step of photosynthetic linear electron transfer. LIR1 and LFNR formed high molecular weight thylakoid protein complexes with the TIC62 and TROL proteins, previously shown to anchor LFNR to the membrane. We further showed that LIR1 increases the affinity of LFNRs for TIC62 and that the rapid light-triggered degradation of the LIR1 coincides with the release of the LFNR from the thylakoid membrane. Loss of LIR1 resulted in a marked decrease in the accumulation of LFNR-containing thylakoid protein complexes without a concomitant decrease in total LFNR content. In rice (Oryza sativa), photosynthetic capacity of lir1 plants was slightly impaired, whereas no such effect was observed in Arabidopsis thaliana knockout mutants. The consequences of LIR1 deficiency in different species are discussed.
NA	Characterizing membrane anchoring of leaf-form ferredoxin-NADP(+) oxidoreductase in rice.	2022	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People&#x27;s Republic of China.	Leaf-form ferredoxin-NADP(+) oxidoreductases (LFNRs) function in the last step of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, exist as soluble proteins in the chloroplast stromaÂ and are weakly associated with thylakoids or tightly anchored to chloroplast membranes. Arabidopsis thaliana has two LFNRs, and the chloroplast proteins AtTROL and AtTIC62 participate in anchoring AtLFNRs to the thylakoid membrane. By contrast, the membrane anchoring mechanism of rice (Oryza sativa) LFNRs has not been elucidated. Here, we investigated the membrane-anchoring mechanism of LFNRs and its physiological roles in rice. We characterized the rice protein OsTROL1 based on its homology to AtTROL. We determined that OsTROL1 is also a thylakoid membrane anchor and its loss leads to a compensatory increase in OsTIC62. OsLFNR1 attachment through a membrane anchor depends on OsLFNR2, unlike the Arabidopsis counterparts. In addition, OsTIC62 was more highly expressed in the dark than under light conditions, consistent with the increased membrane binding of OsLFNR in the dark. Moreover, we observed reciprocal stabilization between OsLFNRs and their membrane anchors. In addition, unlike in Arabidopsis, the loss of LFNR membrane anchor affects photosynthesis in rice. Overall, our study sheds light on the mechanisms anchoring LFNRs to membranes in rice and highlights differences with Arabidopsis.
