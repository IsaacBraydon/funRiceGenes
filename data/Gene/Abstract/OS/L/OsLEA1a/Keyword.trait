OsLEA1a	vegetative	OsLEA1a, a new Em-like protein of cereal plants	Transcriptome analysis revealed OsLEA1a mainly expressed in embryos, with no or only a few transcripts in osmotic stress-treated vegetative tissues
OsLEA1a	stem	Characterization of OsLEA1a and its inhibitory effect on the resistance of E. coli to diverse abiotic stresses.	Real-time PCR analysis showed that OsLEA1a was expressed in roots, leaves and panicles of rice, with no or only a few transcripts in stem tissues, and remained at a relatively higher level in leaves during the tillering period, the heading period, the filling period and the full ripe period
OsLEA1a	resistance	Characterization of OsLEA1a and its inhibitory effect on the resistance of E. coli to diverse abiotic stresses.	Characterization of OsLEA1a and its inhibitory effect on the resistance of E. coli to diverse abiotic stresses.
OsLEA1a	resistance	Characterization of OsLEA1a and its inhibitory effect on the resistance of E. coli to diverse abiotic stresses.	The accumulation of the TrxA-OsLEA1a fusion protein or OsLEA1a protein interfered with the resistance of E
OsLEA1a	abiotic stress	Characterization of OsLEA1a and its inhibitory effect on the resistance of E. coli to diverse abiotic stresses.	Characterization of OsLEA1a and its inhibitory effect on the resistance of E. coli to diverse abiotic stresses.
OsLEA1a	abiotic stress	Characterization of OsLEA1a and its inhibitory effect on the resistance of E. coli to diverse abiotic stresses.	The findings suggested that the OsLEA1a may confor antibacterial activity under abiotic stresses
OsLEA1a	tillering	Characterization of OsLEA1a and its inhibitory effect on the resistance of E. coli to diverse abiotic stresses.	Real-time PCR analysis showed that OsLEA1a was expressed in roots, leaves and panicles of rice, with no or only a few transcripts in stem tissues, and remained at a relatively higher level in leaves during the tillering period, the heading period, the filling period and the full ripe period
OsLEA1a	biotic stress	Characterization of OsLEA1a and its inhibitory effect on the resistance of E. coli to diverse abiotic stresses.	Characterization of OsLEA1a and its inhibitory effect on the resistance of E. coli to diverse abiotic stresses.
OsLEA1a	biotic stress	Characterization of OsLEA1a and its inhibitory effect on the resistance of E. coli to diverse abiotic stresses.	The findings suggested that the OsLEA1a may confor antibacterial activity under abiotic stresses
