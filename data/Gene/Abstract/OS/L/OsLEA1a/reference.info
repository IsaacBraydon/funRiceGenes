Plant Cell Physiol-2010-Shih-2132-44.pdf	OsLEA1a, a new Em-like protein of cereal plants	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	Institute of Plant and Microbial Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, 11529, Taiwan, ROC.	Proteins abundant in seeds during the late stages of development, late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, are associated with desiccation tolerance. More than 100 of the group I LEA genes, also termed Em genes, have been identified from plants, bacteria and animals. The wide distribution indicates the functional importance of these genes. In the present study, we characterized a novel Em-like gene, OsLEA1a of rice (Oryza sativa). The encoded OsLEA1a protein has an N-terminal sequence similar to that of other plant Em proteins but lacks a 20-mer motif that is the most significant feature of typical Em proteins. The location of the sole intron indicates that the second exon of OsLEA1a is the mutated product of a typical Em gene. Transcriptome analysis revealed OsLEA1a mainly expressed in embryos, with no or only a few transcripts in osmotic stress-treated vegetative tissues. Structural analysis revealed that the OsLEA1a protein adopts high amounts of disordered conformations in solution and undergoes desiccation-induced conformational changes. Macromolecular interaction studies revealed that OsLEA1a protein interacts with non-reducing sugars and phospholipids but not poly-l-lysine. Thus, although the OsLEA1a protein lost its 20-mer motif, it is still involved in the formation of bioglasses with non-reducing sugars or plasma membrane. However, the protein does not function as a chaperone as do other groups of hydrophilic LEA proteins. The orthologs of the OsLEA1a gene had been identified from various grasses but not in dicot plants. Genetic analysis indicated that rice OsLEA1a locates at a 193 kb segment in chromosome 1 and is conserved in several published cereal genomes. Thus, the ancestor of Em-like genes might have evolved after the divergence of monocot plants.
NA	Characterization of OsLEA1a and its inhibitory effect on the resistance of E. coli to diverse abiotic stresses.	2016	Int J Biol Macromol	Key Laboratory for Biorheological Science and Technology of Ministry of Education (Chongqing University), Bioengineering College of Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China; School of Life Science and Engineering, Chongqing Three Gorges University, Chongqing 404100, China.

OsLEA1a is a late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein gene from Oryza sativa L, which contains an open reading frame of 282-bp that encodes a putative polypeptide of 93 amino acids. OsLEA1a protein contains abundant of Lys, Ala, Glu, Asp, Gly, Arg and Leu, but depleted in Cys, His, Phe, Trp and Tyr residues; and is strongly hydrophilic. OsLEA1a includes six helical domains and a Î²-sheet domain. Real-time PCR analysis showed that OsLEA1a was expressed in roots, leaves and panicles of rice, with no or only a few transcripts in stem tissues, and remained at a relatively higher level in leaves during the tillering period, the heading period, the filling period and the full ripe period. To make sense of OsLEA1a functions, TrxA-OsLEA1a fusion protein expression vector and OsLEA1a protein expression vector were transformed into E. coli DL21 (DE3), respectively. The accumulation of the TrxA-OsLEA1a fusion protein or OsLEA1a protein interfered with the resistance of E. coli to high salinity, metal ions, hyperosmotic, oxidation, heat and freeze-thaw stresses. The purified TrxA-OsLEA1a fusion protein reduced stabilization of LDH and increased damage of diverse abiotic stresses to LDH. The findings suggested that the OsLEA1a may confor antibacterial activity under abiotic stresses.
NA	OsLEA1a overexpression enhances tolerance to diverse abiotic stresses by inhibiting cell membrane damage and enhancing ROS scavenging capacity in transgenic rice	2021	Funct Plant Biol	 Engineering Technology Research Centre of Characteristic Biological Resources in Northeast of Chongqing, College of Biology and Food Engineering, Chongqing Three Gorges University, Chongqing 404120, China.	Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are involved in diverse abiotic stresses tolerance in many different organisms. Our previous studies have shown that the heterologous expression of OsLEA1a interfered with the resistance of Escherichia coli to abiotic stresses. However, in the present study, based on growth status and physiological indices of rice plant, the overexpression of OsLEA1a in rice conferred increased resistance to abiotic stresses compared with the wild-type (WT) plants. Before applying abiotic stresses, there were no significant differences in physiological indices of rice seedlings. After NaCl, sorbitol, CuSO4 and H2O2 stresses, the transgenic lines had lower relative electrical conductivity, malondialdehyde and lipid peroxidation, greater the contents of proline, soluble sugar and glutathione, and higher the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase than the WT plants. The results indicate that the OsLEA1a gene is involved in the protective response of plants to various abiotic stresses by inhibiting cell membrane damage and enhancing reactive oxygen species scavenging capacity. It was speculated that post-translational modification causes OsLEA1a functional differences in E. coli and rice. The present study shows that OsLEA1a could be a useful candidate gene for engineering abiotic stress tolerance in cultivated plants.
