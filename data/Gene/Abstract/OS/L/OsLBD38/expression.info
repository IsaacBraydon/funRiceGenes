OsLBD38	OsLBD37 and OsLBD38, two class II type LBD proteins, are involved in the regulation of heading date by controlling the expression of Ehd1 in rice. |  Overexpression of OsLBD37 and OsLBD38 separately causes delayed heading date and increased yield |  Further analysis revealed that OsLBD37 and OsLBD38 delayed heading date by down-regulating the expression of the florigen genes Hd3a and RFT1 through key regulator of heading date Ehd1	 Overexpression of OsLBD37 and OsLBD38 separately causes delayed heading date and increased yield
