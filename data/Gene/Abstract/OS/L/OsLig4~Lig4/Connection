OsKu80|Ku80	OsLig4|Lig4	Suppression of Ku70/80 or Lig4 leads to decreased stable transformation and enhanced homologous recombination in rice	Rice calli from OsKu70, OsKu80 and OsLig4 knockdown (KD) plants were infected with Agrobacterium harboring a sensitive emerald luciferase (LUC) reporter construct to evaluate stable expression and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) construct to monitor transient expression of T-DNA
OsKu80|Ku80	OsLig4|Lig4	Suppression of Ku70/80 or Lig4 leads to decreased stable transformation and enhanced homologous recombination in rice	In addition, suppression of OsKu70, OsKu80 and OsLig4 induced the expression of HR-related genes on treatment with DNA-damaging agents
