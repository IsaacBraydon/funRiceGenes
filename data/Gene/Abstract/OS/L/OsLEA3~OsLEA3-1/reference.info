1-s2.0-S0378111997000590-main.pdf	A group 3 LEA cDNA of rice, responsive to abscisic acid, but not to jasmonic acid, shows variety-specific differences insaltstressresponse	1997	Gene	Laboratorium voor Genetica, Department of Genetics, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology (VIB), Universiteit Gent, Belgium.	A cDNA clone oslea3, encoding a group 3 late-embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein was isolated from roots of rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.). The encoded OSLEA3 protein has previously been found to accumulate to higher levels in roots of two salt-tolerant compared to a salt-sensitive rice variety in response to abscisic acid (ABA) [Moons et al., 1995. Plant Physiol. 107, 177-186]. The OSLEA3 protein (Mr 20.5, pI 6.5) characteristically contains ten imperfect 11-mer amino acid repeats. Exogenous application of ABA and exposure to salt shock (150 mM NaCl) rapidly induces a de novo, abundant oslea3 transcript accumulation in seedling roots, whereas application of jasmonic acid (9 microM) does not induce oslea3 expression. The stress-induced oslea3 transcript gradually declined upon prolonged salt shock, as wilting-induced damage became irreversible. oslea3 expression was compared for the salt-tolerant variety Pokkali and the salt-sensitive cultivar Taichung N1. Higher maximal mRNA levels were found in roots of the tolerant variety, also declining less rapidly upon sustained salt shock, concomitant with a delayed drop in shoot water content. DNA blot analysis indicated the existence of a small oslea3 gene family in rice with an equal gene number in both ecotypes. The results suggest that a differential regulation of oslea3 expression is an aspect of the varietal differences in salt stress tolerance.

OsbZIP52/RISBZ5 is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor (TF) family in rice (Oryza sativa) isolated from rice (Zhonghua11) panicles. Expression of the OsbZIP52 gene was strongly induced by low temperature (4 degrees C) but not by drought, PEG, salt, or ABA. The subcellular localization of OsbZIP52-GFP in onion (Allium cepa) epidermis cells revealed that OsbZIP52 is a nuclear localized protein. A transactivation assay in yeast demonstrated that OsbZIP52 functions as a transcriptional activator and can specifically bind to the G-box promoter motif. In a yeast two-hybrid (Y-2-H) experiment, OsbZIP52 was able to form homodimeric complexes. Rice plants overexpressing OsbZIP52 showed significantly increased sensitivity to cold and drought stress. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that some abiotic stress-related genes, such as OsLEA3, OsTPP1, Rab25, gp1 precursor, beta-gal, LOC_Os05g11910 and LOC_Os05g39250, were down-regulated in OsbZIP52 overexpression lines. These results suggest that OsbZIP52/RISBZ5 could function as a negative regulator in cold and drought stress environments.
10.1007-s00438-010-0557-0.pdf	The abiotic stress-responsive NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC5 regulates stress-inducible genes and stress tolerance in rice	2010	Mol Genet Genomics	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.	The transcription factor OsNAC5 in rice is a member of the plant-specific NAC family that regulates stress responses. Expression of OsNAC5 is induced by abiotic stresses such as drought, cold, high salinity, abscisic acid and methyl jasmonic acid. Transactivation assays using rice protoplasts demonstrated that OsNAC5 is a transcriptional activator, and subcellular localization studies using OsNAC5-GFP fusion proteins showed that it is localized to the nucleus. Pull-down assays revealed that OsNAC5 interacts with OsNAC5, OsNAC6 and SNAC1. To analyze the function of OsNAC5 in rice plants, we generated transgenic plants that overexpressed OsNAC5. The growth of these plants was similar to that of control plants, whereas the growth of OsNAC6-overexpressing transgenic plants was retarded. OsNAC5-overexpressing transgenic plants also had improved tolerance to high salinity compared to control plants. By microarray analysis, many stress-inducible genes, including the "late embryogenesis abundant" gene OsLEA3, were upregulated in rice plants that overexpressed OsNAC5. By gel mobility shift assay, OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 were shown to bind to the OsLEA3 promoter. Collectively, our results indicate that the stress-responsive proteins OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 are transcriptional activators that enhance stress tolerance by upregulating the expression of stress-inducible rice genes such as OsLEA3, although the effects of these proteins on growth are different. Furthermore, because OsNAC5 overexpression did not retard growth, OsNAC5 may be a useful gene that can improve the stress tolerance of rice without affecting its growth.
erq120.pdf	Functional analysis of a novel Cys2/His2-type zinc finger protein involved in salt tolerance in rice	2010	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	The Cys2/His2-type zinc finger proteins have been implicated in different cellular processes involved in plant development and stress responses. Through microarray analysis, a salt-responsive zinc finger protein gene ZFP179 was identified and subsequently cloned from rice seedlings. ZFP179 encodes a 17.95 kDa protein with two C2H2-type zinc finger motifs having transcriptional activation activity. The real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that ZFP179 was highly expressed in immature spikes, and markedly induced in the seedlings by NaCl, PEG 6000, and ABA treatments. Overexpression of ZFP179 in rice increased salt tolerance and the transgenic seedlings showed hypersensitivity to exogenous ABA. The increased levels of free proline and soluble sugars were observed in transgenic plants compared to wild-type plants under salt stress. The ZFP179 transgenic rice exhibited significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging ability, and expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including OsDREB2A, OsP5CS OsProT, and OsLea3 under salt stress. Our studies suggest that ZFP179 plays a crucial role in the plant response to salt stress, and is useful in developing transgenic crops with enhanced tolerance to salt stress.
journal.pone.0092913.pdf	Overexpression of OsMYB48-1, a novel MYB-related transcription factor, enhances drought and salinity tolerance in rice	2014	PLoS One	Key Lab of Crop Heterosis and Utilization of Ministry of Education and Beijing Key Lab of Crop Genetic Improvement, China Agricultural University, Beijing, People's Republic of China.	MYB-type transcription factors (TFs) play essential roles in plant growth, development and respond to environmental stresses. Role of MYB-related TFs of rice in drought stress tolerance is not well documented. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel MYB-related TF, OsMYB48-1, of rice. Expression of OsMYB48-1 was strongly induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG), abscisic acid (ABA), H2O2, and dehydration, while being slightly induced by high salinity and cold treatment. The OsMYB48-1 protein was localized in the nucleus with transactivation activity at the C terminus. Overexpression of OsMYB48-1 in rice significantly improved tolerance to simulated drought and salinity stresses caused by mannitol, PEG, and NaCl, respectively, and drought stress was caused by drying the soil. In contrast to wild type plants, the overexpression lines exhibited reduced rate of water loss, lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content and higher proline content under stress conditions. Moreover, overexpression plants were hypersensitive to ABA at both germination and post-germination stages and accumulated more endogenous ABA under drought stress conditions. Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of OsMYB48-1 could regulate the expression of some ABA biosynthesis genes (OsNCED4, OsNCED5), early signaling genes (OsPP2C68, OSRK1) and late responsive genes (RAB21, OsLEA3, RAB16C and RAB16D) under drought stress conditions. Collectively, these results suggested that OsMYB48-1 functions as a novel MYB-related TF which plays a positive role in drought and salinity tolerance by regulating stress-induced ABA synthesis.
P020120608657921798951.pdf	A R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice	2012	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change, Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, PR China.	MYB-type transcription factors play a diverse role in plant development and response to abiotic stress. This study isolated a rice R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, and functionally characterized its role in tolerance to abiotic stress by generating transgenic rice plants with overexpressing and RNA interference OsMYB2. Expression of OsMYB2 was up-regulated by salt, cold, and dehydration stress. OsMYB2 was localized in the nucleus with transactivation activity. No difference in growth and development between the OsMYB2-overexpressing and wild-type plants was observed under normal growth conditions, but the OsMYB2-overexpressing plants were more tolerant to salt, cold, and dehydration stresses and more sensitive to abscisic acid than wild-type plants. The OsMYB2-overexpressing plants accumulated greater amounts of soluble sugars and proline than wild-type plants under salt stress. Overexpression of OsMYB2 enhanced up-regulation of genes encoding proline synthase and transporters. The OsMYB2-overexpressing plants accumulated less amounts of H(2)O(2) and malondialdehyde. The enhanced activities of antioxidant enzymes, including peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, may underlie the lower H(2)O(2) contents in OsMYB2-overexpressing plants. There was greater up-regulation of stress-related genes, including OsLEA3, OsRab16A, and OsDREB2A, in the OsMYB2-overexpressing plants. Microarray analysis showed that expression of numerous genes involving diverse functions in stress response was altered in the OsMYB2-overexpressing plants. These findings suggest that OsMYB2 encodes a stress-responsive MYB transcription factor that plays a regulatory role in tolerance of rice to salt, cold, and dehydration stress.
XBZ_TAG_2007.pdf	Over-expression of a LEA gene in rice improves drought resistance under the field conditions	2007	Theor Appl Genet	National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins have been implicated in many stress responses of plants. In this report, a LEA protein gene OsLEA3-1 was identified and over-expressed in rice to test the drought resistance of transgenic lines under the field conditions. OsLEA3-1 is induced by drought, salt and abscisic acid (ABA), but not by cold stress. The promoter of OsLEA3-1 isolated from the upland rice IRAT109 exhibits strong activity under drought- and salt-stress conditions. Three expression constructs consisting of the full-length cDNA driven by the drought-inducible promoter of OsLEA3-1 (OsLEA3-H), the CaMV 35S promoter (OsLEA3-S), and the rice Actin1 promoter (OsLEA3-A) were transformed into the drought-sensitive japonica rice Zhonghua 11. Drought resistance pre-screening of T(1) families at anthesis stage revealed that the over-expressing families with OsLEA3-S and OsLEA3-H constructs had significantly higher relative yield (yield under drought stress treatment/yield under normal growth conditions) than the wild type under drought stress conditions, although a yield penalty existed in T(1) families under normal growth conditions. Nine homozygous families, exhibiting over-expression of a single-copy of the transgene and relatively low yield penalty in the T(1) generation, were tested in the field for drought resistance in the T(2) and T(3) generations and in the PVC pipes for drought tolerance in the T(2) generation. Except for two families (transformed with OsLEA3-A), all the other families (transformed with OsLEA3-S and OsLEA3-H constructs) had higher grain yield than the wild type under drought stress in both the field and the PVC pipes conditions. No significant yield penalty was detected for these T(2 )and T(3) families. These results indicate that transgenic rice with significantly enhanced drought resistance and without yield penalty can be generated by over-expressing OsLEA3-1 gene with appropriate promoters and following a bipartite (stress and non-stress) in-field screening protocol.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs00299-013-1532-0.pdf	Overexpression of a new stress-repressive gene OsDSR2 encoding a protein with a DUF966 domain increases salt and simulated drought stress sensitivities and reduces ABA sensitivity in rice	2014	Plant Cell Rep	Xiamen Key Laboratory for Plant Genetics, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, China.	Domain of Unknown Function 966 (DUF966) gene family was found in the protein family database, which consisted of seven genes in rice. The proteins encoded by these genes contained one or two highly conserved DUF966 domains. The available data of public microarray databases implied that these genes might play crucial roles in plant response to abiotic stresses. In this study, a member of the DUF966 gene family, DUF966-stress repressive gene 2 in Oryza sativa (OsDSR2, Loc_Os01g62200), was cloned and its role in rice responding to salt and simulated drought stresses was functionally characterized. OsDSR2 was expressed mainly in nodes of stems and leaf blades from rice. Expression profile analysis of adversity showed that OsDSR2 had different transcriptional responses to salt, drought, cold, heat and oxidative (H2O2) stresses, as well as abscisic acid (ABA), methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, gibberellin acid and auxin treatments. Transient expression demonstrated that OsDSR2 was localized in the membrane and nucleus. Overexpression of OsDSR2 could increase salt and simulated drought (polyethyleneglycol)-stress sensitivities in rice by downregulating the expression of ABA- and stress-responsive genes including OsNCED4, SNAC1, OsbZIP23, P5CS, Oslea3 and rab16C. Furthermore, OsDSR2-overexpressing plants showed reduced ABA sensitivity during the post-germination stage. These results suggested that OsDSR2 negatively regulated rice response to salt and simulated drought stresses as well as ABA signaling, which provided some useful data for understanding the functional roles of DUF966 family genes in abiotic stress responses in plants.
NA	Histone deacetylase HDA710 controls salt tolerance by regulating ABA signaling in rice	2020	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agriculture University, Wuhan, 430030, China.	Plants have evolved numerous mechanisms that assist them in withstanding environmental stresses. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play crucial roles in plant stress responses; however, their regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we explored the function of HDA710/OsHDAC2, a member of the HDAC RPD3/HDA1 family, in stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa). We established that HDA710 localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm and is involved in regulating the acetylation of histone H3 and H4, specifically targeting H4K5 and H4K16 under normal conditions. HDA710 transcript accumulation levels were strongly induced by abiotic stresses including drought and salinity, as well as by the phytohormones jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA). hda710 knockout mutant plants showed enhanced salinity tolerance and reduced ABA sensitivity, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing HDA710 displayed the opposite phenotypes. Moreover, ABA- and salt-stress-responsive genes, such as OsLEA3, OsABI5, OsbZIP72, and OsNHX1, were upregulated in hda710 compared with wild-type plants. These expression differences corresponded with higher levels of histone H4 acetylation in gene promoter regions in hda710 compared with the wild type under ABA and salt-stress treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that HDA710 is involved in regulating ABA- and salt-stress-responsive genes by altering H4 acetylation levels in their promoters.

NA	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	2020	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530004, China.	Background: Salt stress threatens crop yields all over the world. Many NAC transcription factors have been reported to be involved in different abiotic stress responses, but it remains unclear how loss of these transcription factors alters the transcriptomes of plants. Previous reports have demonstrated that overexpression of OsNAC45 enhances salt and drought tolerance in rice, and that OsNAC45 may regulate the expression of two specific genes, OsPM1 and OsLEA3-1.  Results: Here, we found that ABA repressed, and NaCl promoted, the expression of OsNAC45 in roots. Immunostaining showed that OsNAC45 was localized in all root cells and was mainly expressed in the stele. Loss of OsNAC45 decreased the sensitivity of rice plants to ABA and over-expressing this gene had the opposite effect, which demonstrated that OsNAC45 played an important role during ABA signal responses. Knockout of OsNAC45 also resulted in more ROS accumulation in roots and increased sensitivity of rice to salt stress. Transcriptome sequencing assay found that thousands of genes were differently expressed in OsNAC45-knockout plants. Most of the down-regulated genes participated in plant stress responses. Quantitative real time RT-PCR suggested that seven genes may be regulated by OsNAC45 including OsCYP89G1, OsDREB1F, OsEREBP2, OsERF104, OsPM1, OsSAMDC2, and OsSIK1.  Conclusions: These results indicate that OsNAC45 plays vital roles in ABA signal responses and salt tolerance in rice. Further characterization of this gene may help us understand ABA signal pathway and breed rice plants that are more tolerant to salt stress.
