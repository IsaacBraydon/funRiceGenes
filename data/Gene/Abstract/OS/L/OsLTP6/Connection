OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	OsDIL|OsLTP6	The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages	The expression levels of the drought-responsive genes RD22, SODA1, bZIP46 and POD, as well as the ABA synthetic gene ZEP1 were up-regulated in the OsDIL-overexpression lines but the ABA degradation gene ABAOX3 was down-regulated
OsCP1	OsDIL|OsLTP6	The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages	Moreover, overexpression of OsDIL lessened the down-regulation by drought of anther developmental genes (OsC4, CYP704B2 and OsCP1), providing a mechanism supporting pollen fertility under drought
OsDIL|OsLTP6	ZEP1|OsZEP	The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages	The expression levels of the drought-responsive genes RD22, SODA1, bZIP46 and POD, as well as the ABA synthetic gene ZEP1 were up-regulated in the OsDIL-overexpression lines but the ABA degradation gene ABAOX3 was down-regulated
