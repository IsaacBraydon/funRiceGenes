NA	Clock component OsPRR73 positively regulates rice salt tolerance by modulating OsHKT2;1-mediated sodium homeostasis	2020	EMBO J	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	The roles of clock components in salt stress tolerance remain incompletely characterized in rice. Here, we show that, among OsPRR (Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator) family members, OsPRR73 specifically confers salt tolerance in rice. Notably, the grain size and yield of osprr73 null mutants were significantly decreased in the presence of salt stress, with accumulated higher level of reactive oxygen species and sodium ions. RNA sequencing and biochemical assays identified OsHKT2;1, encoding a plasma membrane-localized Na+ transporter, as a transcriptional target of OsPRR73 in mediating salt tolerance. Correspondingly, null mutants of OsHKT2;1 displayed an increased tolerance to salt stress. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays further identified HDAC10 as nuclear interactor of OsPRR73 and co-repressor of OsHKT2;1. Consistently, H3K9ac histone marks at OsHKT2;1 promoter regions were significantly reduced in osprr73 mutant. Together, our findings reveal that salt-induced OsPRR73 expression confers salt tolerance by recruiting HDAC10 to transcriptionally repress OsHKT2;1, thus reducing cellular Na+ accumulation. This exemplifies a new molecular link between clock components and salt stress tolerance in rice.
NA	Suppression of cuticular wax biosynthesis mediated by rice LOV KELCH REPEAT PROTEIN 2 supports a negative role in drought stress tolerance.	2023	Plant Cell Environ	Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Bioresources, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.	Drought tolerance is important for grain crops, including rice (Oryza sativa); for example, rice cultivated under intermittent irrigation produces less methane gas compared to rice grown in anaerobic paddy field conditions, but these plants require greater drought tolerance. Moreover, the roles of rice circadian-clock genes in drought tolerance remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the mutation of LOV KELCH REPEAT PROTEIN 2 (OsLKP2) enhanced drought tolerance by increasing cuticular wax biosynthesis. Among ZEITLUPE family genes, OsLKP2 expression specifically increased under dehydration stress. OsLKP2 knockdown (oslkp2-1) and knockout (oslkp2-2) mutants exhibited enhanced drought tolerance. Cuticular waxes inhibit non-stomatal water loss. Under drought conditions, total wax loads on the leaf surface increased by approximately 10% in oslkp2-1 and oslkp2-2 compared to the wild type, and the transcript levels of cuticular wax biosynthesis genes were upregulated in the oslkp2 mutants. Yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that OsLKP2 interacts with GIGANTEA (OsGI) in the nucleus. The osgi mutants also showed enhanced tolerance to drought stress, with a high density of wax crystals on their leaf surface. These results demonstrate that the OsLKP2-OsGI interaction negatively regulates wax accumulation on leaf surfaces, thereby decreasing rice resilience to drought stress.
