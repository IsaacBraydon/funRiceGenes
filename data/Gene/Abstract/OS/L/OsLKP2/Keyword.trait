OsLKP2	leaf	Suppression of cuticular wax biosynthesis mediated by rice LOV KELCH REPEAT PROTEIN 2 supports a negative role in drought stress tolerance.	 Under drought conditions, total wax loads on the leaf surface increased by approximately 10% in oslkp2-1 and oslkp2-2 compared to the wild type, and the transcript levels of cuticular wax biosynthesis genes were upregulated in the oslkp2 mutants
OsLKP2	drought	Suppression of cuticular wax biosynthesis mediated by rice LOV KELCH REPEAT PROTEIN 2 supports a negative role in drought stress tolerance.	 OsLKP2 knockdown (oslkp2-1) and knockout (oslkp2-2) mutants exhibited enhanced drought tolerance

OsLKP2	stress	Suppression of cuticular wax biosynthesis mediated by rice LOV KELCH REPEAT PROTEIN 2 supports a negative role in drought stress tolerance.	 Among ZEITLUPE family genes, OsLKP2 expression specifically increased under dehydration stress
OsLKP2	tolerance	Suppression of cuticular wax biosynthesis mediated by rice LOV KELCH REPEAT PROTEIN 2 supports a negative role in drought stress tolerance.	 OsLKP2 knockdown (oslkp2-1) and knockout (oslkp2-2) mutants exhibited enhanced drought tolerance
OsLKP2	nucleus	Suppression of cuticular wax biosynthesis mediated by rice LOV KELCH REPEAT PROTEIN 2 supports a negative role in drought stress tolerance.	 Yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that OsLKP2 interacts with GIGANTEA (OsGI) in the nucleus
OsLKP2	drought tolerance	Suppression of cuticular wax biosynthesis mediated by rice LOV KELCH REPEAT PROTEIN 2 supports a negative role in drought stress tolerance.	 OsLKP2 knockdown (oslkp2-1) and knockout (oslkp2-2) mutants exhibited enhanced drought tolerance
