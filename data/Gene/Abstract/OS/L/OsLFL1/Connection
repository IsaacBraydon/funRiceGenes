Ehd1	OsLFL1	Ectopic expression of OsLFL1 in rice represses Ehd1 by binding on its promoter	 In this study, it was found that the flowering promoting gene Ehd1 and its putative downstream genes were all repressed by OsLFL1| Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses suggest that OsLFL1 binds to the RY cis-elements (CATGCATG) in the promoter of the Ehd1 gene| Thus, ectopically expressed OsLFL1 might repress Ehd1 via binding directly to the RY cis-elements in its promoter|Ectopic expression of OsLFL1 in rice represses Ehd1 by binding on its promoter
Ehd1	OsLFL1	OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice	 In the osmads50 mutants and 56OX transgenic plants, transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 were reduced, although that of OsLFL1 increased| These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in regulating LD-dependent flowering
Hd3a	OsLFL1	OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice	 In the osmads50 mutants and 56OX transgenic plants, transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 were reduced, although that of OsLFL1 increased

OsLFL1	OsMADS56	OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice	 These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in regulating LD-dependent flowering

Ehd1	OsLFL1	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	 In osvil2 mutants OsLFL1 expression was increased, but that of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 was reduced| As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression
Hd3a	OsLFL1	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	 In osvil2 mutants OsLFL1 expression was increased, but that of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 was reduced
OsEMF2b	OsLFL1	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	 As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression
OsLFL1	OsVIL2	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	 In osvil2 mutants OsLFL1 expression was increased, but that of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 was reduced| Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that OsVIL2 was directly associated with OsLFL1 chromatin| We also observed that H3K27me3 was significantly enriched by OsLFL1 chromatin in the wild type, but that this enrichment was diminished in the osvil2 mutants| These results indicated that OsVIL2 epigenetically represses OsLFL1 expression| As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression| Thus, we conclude that OsVIL2 functions together with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1|OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice

GD1	OsLFL1	The rice GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, encoding a B3 domain transcriptional repressor, regulates seed germination and seedling development by integrating GA and carbohydrate metabolism	 Furthermore, GD1 binds to the promoter of OsLFL1, a LEC2/FUS3-like gene of rice, via an RY element, leading to significant up-regulation of OsLFL1 and a large subset of seed maturation genes in the gd1 mutant| Plants over-expressing OsLFL1 partly mimic the gd1 mutant
