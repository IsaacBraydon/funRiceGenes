OsLBD3-7	leaf	OsLBD3-7 Overexpression Induced Adaxially Rolled Leaves in Rice.	 Microscopy of flag leaf cross-sections indicated that overexpression of OsLBD3-7 led to a decrease in both bulliform cell size and number
OsLBD3-7	leaf	OsLBD3-7 Overexpression Induced Adaxially Rolled Leaves in Rice.	 These results indicated that OsLBD3-7 might acts as an upstream regulatory gene of bulliform cell development to regulate leaf rolling, which will give more insights on the leaf rolling regulation mechanism
OsLBD3-7	development	OsLBD3-7 Overexpression Induced Adaxially Rolled Leaves in Rice.	 These results indicated that OsLBD3-7 might acts as an upstream regulatory gene of bulliform cell development to regulate leaf rolling, which will give more insights on the leaf rolling regulation mechanism
OsLBD3-7	nucleus	OsLBD3-7 Overexpression Induced Adaxially Rolled Leaves in Rice.	 OsLBD3-7 works as a transcription activator and its protein is located on the plasma membrane and in the nucleus
