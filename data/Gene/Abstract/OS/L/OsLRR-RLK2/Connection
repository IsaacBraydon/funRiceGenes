OsLRR-RLK2	OsMPK6|OsMPK4	Suppression of a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase enhances host plant resistance to a specialist herbivore.	 Silencing OsLRR-RLK2 decreases the constitutive activity of  mitogen-activated protein kinase (OsMPK6) and alters BPH-induced transcript levels of several defense-related WRKY transcription factors
