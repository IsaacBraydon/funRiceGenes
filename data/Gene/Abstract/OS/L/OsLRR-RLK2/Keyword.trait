OsLRR-RLK2	transcription factor	Suppression of a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase enhances host plant resistance to a specialist herbivore.	 Silencing OsLRR-RLK2 decreases the constitutive activity of  mitogen-activated protein kinase (OsMPK6) and alters BPH-induced transcript levels of several defense-related WRKY transcription factors
OsLRR-RLK2	ethylene	Suppression of a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase enhances host plant resistance to a specialist herbivore.	 Moreover, silencing OsLRR-RLK2 reduces BPH-induction of jasmonic acid and ethylene but promotes the biosynthesis of both elicited salicylic acid and H2 O2 ; silencing also enhances  the production of volatiles emitted from rice plants infested with gravid BPH females
OsLRR-RLK2	salicylic acid	Suppression of a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase enhances host plant resistance to a specialist herbivore.	 Moreover, silencing OsLRR-RLK2 reduces BPH-induction of jasmonic acid and ethylene but promotes the biosynthesis of both elicited salicylic acid and H2 O2 ; silencing also enhances  the production of volatiles emitted from rice plants infested with gravid BPH females
OsLRR-RLK2	jasmonic	Suppression of a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase enhances host plant resistance to a specialist herbivore.	 Moreover, silencing OsLRR-RLK2 reduces BPH-induction of jasmonic acid and ethylene but promotes the biosynthesis of both elicited salicylic acid and H2 O2 ; silencing also enhances  the production of volatiles emitted from rice plants infested with gravid BPH females

OsLRR-RLK2	Kinase	Suppression of a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase enhances host plant resistance to a specialist herbivore.	 Silencing OsLRR-RLK2 decreases the constitutive activity of  mitogen-activated protein kinase (OsMPK6) and alters BPH-induced transcript levels of several defense-related WRKY transcription factors
OsLRR-RLK2	protein kinase	Suppression of a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase enhances host plant resistance to a specialist herbivore.	 Silencing OsLRR-RLK2 decreases the constitutive activity of  mitogen-activated protein kinase (OsMPK6) and alters BPH-induced transcript levels of several defense-related WRKY transcription factors
