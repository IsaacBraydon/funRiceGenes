LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsBZR1|BZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	Here, we demonstrate that Oryza sativa LEAF and TILLER ANGLE INCREASED CONTROLLER (LIC) acts as an antagonistic transcription factor of BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) to attenuate the BR signaling pathway
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsBZR1|BZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	The gain-of-function mutant lic-1 and LIC-overexpressing lines showed erect leaves, similar to BZR1-depleted lines, which indicates the opposite roles of LIC and BZR1 in regulating leaf bending
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsBZR1|BZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	For negative feedback, LIC bound to the core element CTCGC in the BZR1 promoter on gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and repressed its transcription on transient transformation assay

LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsBZR1|BZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	Repression of LIC in ILI1 transcription in protoplasts was partially rescued by BZR1
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsBZR1|BZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	Phenotypic analysis of the crossed lines depleted in both LIC and BZR1 suggested that BZR1 functionally depends on LIC
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsBZR1|BZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	Molecular and physiology assays revealed that LIC plays a dominant role at high BR levels, whereas BZR1 is dominant at low levels
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsBZR1|BZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	Thus, LIC regulates rice leaf bending as an antagonistic transcription factor of BZR1
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	SRS3|OsKINESIN-13A|BHS1	The kinesin-13 protein BR HYPERSENSITIVEÂ 1 is a negative brassinosteroid signaling component regulating rice growth and development.	 Furthermore, we found that the BR-induced degradation of BHS1 was attenuated in Osbri1 and Osbak1 mutants, but not in Osbzr1 and Oslic mutants
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsWRKY30	OsMAPK6 phosphorylates a zinc finger protein OsLIC to promote downstream OsWRKY30 for rice resistance to bacterial blight and leaf streak.	OsMAPK6 phosphorylates a zinc finger protein OsLIC to promote downstream OsWRKY30 for rice resistance to bacterial blight and leaf streak.
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsWRKY30	OsMAPK6 phosphorylates a zinc finger protein OsLIC to promote downstream OsWRKY30 for rice resistance to bacterial blight and leaf streak.	 Biochemical assays showed that OsLIC bound to OsWRKY30 promoter and suppressed its transcription
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsWRKY30	OsMAPK6 phosphorylates a zinc finger protein OsLIC to promote downstream OsWRKY30 for rice resistance to bacterial blight and leaf streak.	 Genetic assays confirmed that the osilc knockout mutants and OsWRKY30-overexpressing plants exhibited enhanced resistance to Xoo and Xoc, knocking out OsWRKY30 in the oslic mutants attenuated the resistance against bacterial pathogens
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsWRKY30	OsMAPK6 phosphorylates a zinc finger protein OsLIC to promote downstream OsWRKY30 for rice resistance to bacterial blight and leaf streak.	 In addition, both OsMAPK6-phosphorylated activation of OsLIC and phosphorylation-mimic OsLIC(5D) had reduced DNA-binding activity towards OsWRKY30 promoter, thereby promoting OsWRKY30 transcription
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsWRKY30	OsMAPK6 phosphorylates a zinc finger protein OsLIC to promote downstream OsWRKY30 for rice resistance to bacterial blight and leaf streak.	 Collectively, these results reveal that OsMAPK6-mediated phosphorylation of OsLIC positively regulates rice resistance to Xoo and Xoc by modulating OsWRKY30 transcription, suggesting that OsMAPK6-OsLIC-OsWRKY30 module is an immune signaling pathway in response to the bacterial pathogens
