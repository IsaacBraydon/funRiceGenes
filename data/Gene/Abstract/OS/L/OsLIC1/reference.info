Brassinosteroids (BRs) regulate rice plant architecture, including leaf bending, which affects grain yield. Although BR signaling has been investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana, the components negatively regulating this pathway are less well understood. Here, we demonstrate that Oryza sativa LEAF and TILLER ANGLE INCREASED CONTROLLER (LIC) acts as an antagonistic transcription factor of BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) to attenuate the BR signaling pathway. The gain-of-function mutant lic-1 and LIC-overexpressing lines showed erect leaves, similar to BZR1-depleted lines, which indicates the opposite roles of LIC and BZR1 in regulating leaf bending. Quantitative PCR revealed LIC transcription rapidly induced by BR treatment. Image analysis and immunoblotting showed that upon BR treatment LIC proteins translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion. Phosphorylation assay in vitro revealed LIC phosphorylated by GSK3-like kinases. For negative feedback, LIC bound to the core element CTCGC in the BZR1 promoter on gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and repressed its transcription on transient transformation assay. LIC directly regulated target genes such as INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION 1 (ILI1) to oppose the action of BZR1. Repression of LIC in ILI1 transcription in protoplasts was partially rescued by BZR1. Phenotypic analysis of the crossed lines depleted in both LIC and BZR1 suggested that BZR1 functionally depends on LIC. Molecular and physiology assays revealed that LIC plays a dominant role at high BR levels, whereas BZR1 is dominant at low levels. Thus, LIC regulates rice leaf bending as an antagonistic transcription factor of BZR1. The phenotypes of lic-1 and LIC-overexpressing lines in erect leaves contribute to ideal plant architecture. Improving this phenotype may be a potential approach to molecular breeding for high yield in rice.
journal.pone.0003521.pdf	OsLIC, a Novel CCCH-Type Zinc Finger Protein with Transcription Activation, Mediates Rice Architecture via Brassinosteroids Signaling	2008	PLoS One	Key Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Environmental Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Rice architecture is an important agronomic trait and a major limiting factor for its high productivity. Here we describe a novel CCCH-type zinc finger gene, OsLIC (Oraza sativaleaf and tiller angle increased controller), which is involved in the regulation of rice plant architecture. OsLIC encoded an ancestral and unique CCCH type zinc finge protein. It has many orthologous in other organisms, ranging from yeast to humane. Suppression of endogenous OsLIC expression resulted in drastically increased leaf and tiller angles, shortened shoot height, and consequently reduced grain production in rice. OsLIC is predominantly expressed in rice collar and tiller bud. Genetic analysis suggested that OsLIC is epistatic to d2-1, whereas d61-1 is epistatic to OsLIC. Interestingly, sterols were significantly higher in level in transgenic shoots than in the wild type. Genome-wide expression analysis indicated that brassinosteroids (BRs) signal transduction was activated in transgenic lines. Moreover, transcription of OsLIC was induced by 24-epibrassinolide. OsLIC, with a single CCCH motif, displayed binding activity to double-stranded DNA and single-stranded polyrA, polyrU and polyrG but not polyrC. It contains a novel conserved EELR domain among eukaryotes and displays transcriptional activation activity in yeast. OsLIC may be a transcription activator to control rice plant architecture.
NA	OsRELA Regulates Leaf Inclination by Repressing the Transcriptional Activity of OsLIC in Rice	2021	Front Plant Sci	Joint CAAS/IRRI Laboratory for Photosynthetic Enhancement, Biotechnology Research Institute/National Key Facility for Genetic Resources and Gene Improvement, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Leaf angle is one of the most important agronomic traits in rice, and changes in leaf angle can alter plant architecture to affect photosynthetic efficiency and thus determine grain yield. Therefore, it is important to identify key genes controlling leaf angle and elucidate the molecular mechanisms to improve rice yield. We obtained a mutant rela (regulator of leaf angle) with reduced leaf angle in rice by EMS mutagenesis, and map-based cloning revealed that OsRELA encodes a protein of unknown function. Coincidentally, DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 2 (DEP2) was reported in a previous study with the same gene locus. RNA-seq analysis revealed that OsRELA is involved in regulating the expression of ILI and Expansin family genes. Biochemical and genetic analyses revealed that OsRELA is able to interact with OsLIC, a negative regulator of BR signaling, through its conserved C-terminal domain, which is essential for OsRELA function in rice. The binding of OsRELA can activate the expression of downstream genes repressed by OsLIC, such as OsILI1, a positive regulator of leaf inclination in rice. Therefore, our results suggest that OsRELA can act as a transcriptional regulator and is involved in the regulation of leaf inclination by regulating the transcriptional activity of OsLIC.
NA	OsMAPK6 phosphorylates a zinc finger protein OsLIC to promote downstream OsWRKY30 for rice resistance to bacterial blight and leaf streak.	2022	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Hubei Hongshan Laboratory, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Rice OsLIC encoding a CCCH zinc finger transcription factor plays an important role in immunity. However, the immune signaling pathways that OsLIC-involved and the underlying mechanisms that OsLIC-conferred resistance against pathogens are largely unclear. Here, we show that OsLIC, as a substrate for OsMAPK6, negatively regulates resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) by directly suppressing OsWRKY30 transcription. Biochemical assays showed that OsLIC bound to OsWRKY30 promoter and suppressed its transcription. Genetic assays confirmed that the osilc knockout mutants and OsWRKY30-overexpressing plants exhibited enhanced resistance to Xoo and Xoc, knocking out OsWRKY30 in the oslic mutants attenuated the resistance against bacterial pathogens. OsMAPK6 physically interacted with and phosphorylated OsLIC leading to decreased OsLIC DNA-binding activity, therefore, overexpression of OsLIC partially suppressed OsMAPK6-mediated rice resistance. In addition, both OsMAPK6-phosphorylated activation of OsLIC and phosphorylation-mimic OsLIC(5D) had reduced DNA-binding activity towards OsWRKY30 promoter, thereby promoting OsWRKY30 transcription. Collectively, these results reveal that OsMAPK6-mediated phosphorylation of OsLIC positively regulates rice resistance to Xoo and Xoc by modulating OsWRKY30 transcription, suggesting that OsMAPK6-OsLIC-OsWRKY30 module is an immune signaling pathway in response to the bacterial pathogens.
NA	An Analysis of Natural Variation Reveals That OsFLA2 Controls Flag Leaf Angle in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2022	Front Plant Sci	Institute of Rice Research, Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hefei, China.	Flag leaf angle (FLA) is an important outcrossing trait affecting the hybrid seed production in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Natural variation of FLA has been reported in rice, but the molecular basis for this variation is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the phenotypic values of FLA in 353 rice natural accessions in six environments, which indicated that there was abundant phenotypic variation. We performed a genome-wide association study on FLA using 1.3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A total of six quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified significantly associated with FLA, of which five were located in previously reported QTLs/genes and one was novel. We identified two causal gene loci for FLA, namely, OsFLA6 and OsFLA2; OsFLA6 was co-localized with the gene OsLIC. In addition, the accessions with large and small FLA values have corresponding high and low OsFLA6 expressions. OsFLA2(TT) allele could increase significantly the seed setting percentage in hybrid F(1) seed production by field experiment. We also confirmed that the allele OsFLA2 (TT) increased the FLA compared with that of the isogenic line carrying allele OsFLA2 (CC) by transgenic complementation experiment. The allele frequencies of OsFLA6 (GG) and OsFLA2 (TT) decreased gradually with an increase in latitude in the Northern Hemisphere. Our results should facilitate the improvement of FLA of parents of hybrid rice.
