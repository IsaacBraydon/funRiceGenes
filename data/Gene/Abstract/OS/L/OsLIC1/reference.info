Brassinosteroids (BRs) regulate rice plant architecture, including leaf bending, which affects grain yield. Although BR signaling has been investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana, the components negatively regulating this pathway are less well understood. Here, we demonstrate that Oryza sativa LEAF and TILLER ANGLE INCREASED CONTROLLER (LIC) acts as an antagonistic transcription factor of BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) to attenuate the BR signaling pathway. The gain-of-function mutant lic-1 and LIC-overexpressing lines showed erect leaves, similar to BZR1-depleted lines, which indicates the opposite roles of LIC and BZR1 in regulating leaf bending. Quantitative PCR revealed LIC transcription rapidly induced by BR treatment. Image analysis and immunoblotting showed that upon BR treatment LIC proteins translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion. Phosphorylation assay in vitro revealed LIC phosphorylated by GSK3-like kinases. For negative feedback, LIC bound to the core element CTCGC in the BZR1 promoter on gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and repressed its transcription on transient transformation assay. LIC directly regulated target genes such as INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION 1 (ILI1) to oppose the action of BZR1. Repression of LIC in ILI1 transcription in protoplasts was partially rescued by BZR1. Phenotypic analysis of the crossed lines depleted in both LIC and BZR1 suggested that BZR1 functionally depends on LIC. Molecular and physiology assays revealed that LIC plays a dominant role at high BR levels, whereas BZR1 is dominant at low levels. Thus, LIC regulates rice leaf bending as an antagonistic transcription factor of BZR1. The phenotypes of lic-1 and LIC-overexpressing lines in erect leaves contribute to ideal plant architecture. Improving this phenotype may be a potential approach to molecular breeding for high yield in rice.
journal.pone.0003521.pdf	OsLIC, a Novel CCCH-Type Zinc Finger Protein with Transcription Activation, Mediates Rice Architecture via Brassinosteroids Signaling	2008	PLoS One	Key Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Environmental Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Rice architecture is an important agronomic trait and a major limiting factor for its high productivity. Here we describe a novel CCCH-type zinc finger gene, OsLIC (Oraza sativaleaf and tiller angle increased controller), which is involved in the regulation of rice plant architecture. OsLIC encoded an ancestral and unique CCCH type zinc finge protein. It has many orthologous in other organisms, ranging from yeast to humane. Suppression of endogenous OsLIC expression resulted in drastically increased leaf and tiller angles, shortened shoot height, and consequently reduced grain production in rice. OsLIC is predominantly expressed in rice collar and tiller bud. Genetic analysis suggested that OsLIC is epistatic to d2-1, whereas d61-1 is epistatic to OsLIC. Interestingly, sterols were significantly higher in level in transgenic shoots than in the wild type. Genome-wide expression analysis indicated that brassinosteroids (BRs) signal transduction was activated in transgenic lines. Moreover, transcription of OsLIC was induced by 24-epibrassinolide. OsLIC, with a single CCCH motif, displayed binding activity to double-stranded DNA and single-stranded polyrA, polyrU and polyrG but not polyrC. It contains a novel conserved EELR domain among eukaryotes and displays transcriptional activation activity in yeast. OsLIC may be a transcription activator to control rice plant architecture.
NA	OsRELA Regulates Leaf Inclination by Repressing the Transcriptional Activity of OsLIC in Rice	2021	Front Plant Sci	Joint CAAS/IRRI Laboratory for Photosynthetic Enhancement, Biotechnology Research Institute/National Key Facility for Genetic Resources and Gene Improvement, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Leaf angle is one of the most important agronomic traits in rice, and changes in leaf angle can alter plant architecture to affect photosynthetic efficiency and thus determine grain yield. Therefore, it is important to identify key genes controlling leaf angle and elucidate the molecular mechanisms to improve rice yield. We obtained a mutant rela (regulator of leaf angle) with reduced leaf angle in rice by EMS mutagenesis, and map-based cloning revealed that OsRELA encodes a protein of unknown function. Coincidentally, DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 2 (DEP2) was reported in a previous study with the same gene locus. RNA-seq analysis revealed that OsRELA is involved in regulating the expression of ILI and Expansin family genes. Biochemical and genetic analyses revealed that OsRELA is able to interact with OsLIC, a negative regulator of BR signaling, through its conserved C-terminal domain, which is essential for OsRELA function in rice. The binding of OsRELA can activate the expression of downstream genes repressed by OsLIC, such as OsILI1, a positive regulator of leaf inclination in rice. Therefore, our results suggest that OsRELA can act as a transcriptional regulator and is involved in the regulation of leaf inclination by regulating the transcriptional activity of OsLIC.
