NA	LOX genes in blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) resistance in rice.	2012	Funct Integr Genomics	Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering, G.B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar, India. soma.marla@nbpgr.ernet.in	Plant Lipoxygenases (LOX) are known to play major role in plant immunity by providing front-line defense against pathogen-induced injury. To verify this, we isolated a full-length OsLOX3 gene and also 12 OsLOX cDNA clones from Oryza sativa indica (cultivar Pusa Basmati 1). We have examined the role played by LOXs in plant development and during attack by blast pathogen Magnaporthe grisea. Gene expression, promoter region analysis, and biochemical and protein structure analysis of isolated OsLOX3 revealed significant homology with LOX super family. Protein sequence comparison of OsLOXs revealed high levels of homology when compared with japonica rice (up to100%) and Arabidopsis (up to 64%). Isolated LOX3 gene and 12 OsLOX cDNAs contained the catalytic LOX domains much required for oxygen binding and synthesis of oxylipins. Amino acid composition, protein secondary structure, and promoter region analysis (with abundance of motifs CGTCA and TGACG) support the role of OsLOX3 gene in providing resistance to diseases in rice plants. OsLOX3 gene expression analysis of root, shoot, flag leaf, and developing and mature seed revealed organ specific patterns during rice plant development and gave evidence to association between tissue location and physiological roles played by individual OsLOXs. Increased defense activity of oxylipins was observed as demonstrated by PCR amplification of OsLOX3 gene and upon inoculation with virulent strains of M. grisea and ectopic application of methyl jasmonate in the injured leaf tissue in adult rice plants.
NA	The lipoxygenase OsLOX10 affects seed longevity and resistance to saline-alkaline stress during rice seedlings.	2023	Plant Mol Biol	College of Agriculture, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, 350002, Fuzhou, China.	Prolonged storage of rice seeds can lead to a decrease in seed vigor and seedling quality. The Lipoxygenase (LOX) gene family is widely distributed in plants, and LOX activity is closely related to seed viability and stress tolerance. In this study, the lipoxygenase OsLOX10 gene from the 9-lipoxygenase metabolic pathway was cloned from rice, and its roles in determining seed longevity and tolerance to saline-alkaline stress caused by Na(2)CO(3) in rice seedlings were mainly investigated. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of OsLOX10 increased seed longevity compared with the wild-type and OsLOX10 overexpression lines in response to artificial aging. The expression levels of other 9-lipoxygenase metabolic pathway related genes, such as LOX1, LOX2 and LOX3, were increased in the LOX10 overexpression lines. Quantitative real-time PCR and histochemical staining analysis showed that the expression of LOX10 was highest in seed hulls, anthers and the early germinating seeds. KI-I(2) staining of starch showed that LOX10 could catalyze the degradation of linoleic acid. Furthermore, we found that the transgenic lines overexpressing LOX10 showed better tolerance to saline-alkaline stress than the wild-type and knockout mutant lines. Overall, our study demonstrated that the knockout LOX10 mutant increased seed longevity, whereas overexpression of LOX10 enhanced tolerance to saline-alkaline stress in rice seedlings.
