NA	Both overexpression and suppression of an Oryza sativa NB-LRR-like gene OsLSR result in autoactivation of immune response and thiamine accumulation.	2016	Sci Rep	Institute of Crop Science, Zhejiang University, Yu-Hang-Tang Road No 866, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Tight and accurate regulation of immunity and thiamine biosynthesis is critical for proper defence mechanisms and several primary metabolic cycles in plants. Although thiamine is known to enhance plant defence by priming, the mechanism by which thiamine biosynthesis responds to immune signals remains poorly understood. Here we identified a novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) NB-LRR gene via an insertion mutation, this mutant confesses a low seed setting phenotype and the corresponding genetic locus was named OsLSR (Low seed setting related). Comparing with wildtype plant, both overexpression and suppression of OsLSR lead to the autoactivation of the rice immune system and accumulation of thiamine, which result in a great fitness cost and yield penalty. Moreover, when fused with eGFP at their C terminus, two fragments, OsLSR1-178 and OsLSR464-546, localized to chloroplasts where thiamine is produced. Our result suggests that OsLSR differs from traditional NB-LRR genes. Its expression is closely related to the immune status and thiamine level in plant cells and should be maintained within a narrow range for rice growth.
