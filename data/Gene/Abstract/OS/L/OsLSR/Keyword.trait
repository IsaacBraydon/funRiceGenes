OsLSR	seed	Both overexpression and suppression of an Oryza sativa NB-LRR-like gene OsLSR result in autoactivation of immune response and thiamine accumulation.	) NB-LRR gene via an insertion mutation, this mutant confesses a low seed setting phenotype and the corresponding genetic locus was named OsLSR (Low seed setting related)
OsLSR	yield	Both overexpression and suppression of an Oryza sativa NB-LRR-like gene OsLSR result in autoactivation of immune response and thiamine accumulation.	Comparing with wildtype plant, both overexpression and suppression of OsLSR lead to the autoactivation of the rice immune system and accumulation of thiamine, which result in a great fitness cost and yield penalty
OsLSR	immune response	Both overexpression and suppression of an Oryza sativa NB-LRR-like gene OsLSR result in autoactivation of immune response and thiamine accumulation.	Both overexpression and suppression of an Oryza sativa NB-LRR-like gene OsLSR result in autoactivation of immune response and thiamine accumulation.
