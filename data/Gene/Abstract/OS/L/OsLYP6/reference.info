3406.pdf	Lysin motif-containing proteins LYP4 and LYP6 play dual roles in peptidoglycan and chitin perception in rice innate immunity	2012	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education and Guangdong Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 510275 Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.	Plant innate immunity relies on successful detection of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) of invading microbes via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) at the plant cell surface. Here, we report two homologous rice (Oryza sativa) lysin motif-containing proteins, LYP4 and LYP6, as dual functional PRRs sensing bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and fungal chitin. Live cell imaging and microsomal fractionation consistently revealed the plasma membrane localization of these proteins in rice cells. Transcription of these two genes could be induced rapidly upon exposure to bacterial pathogens or diverse MAMPs. Both proteins selectively bound PGN and chitin but not lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. Accordingly, silencing of either LYP specifically impaired PGN- or chitin- but not LPS-induced defense responses in rice, including reactive oxygen species generation, defense gene activation, and callose deposition, leading to compromised resistance against bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae and fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Interestingly, pretreatment with excess PGN dramatically attenuated the alkalinization response of rice cells to chitin but not to flagellin; vice versa, pretreatment with chitin attenuated the response to PGN, suggesting that PGN and chitin engage overlapping perception components in rice. Collectively, our data support the notion that LYP4 and LYP6 are promiscuous PRRs for PGN and chitin in rice innate immunity.
Liu-2013-OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 pl.pdf	OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 play critical roles in rice defense signal transduction	2013	Plant Signal Behav	State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol and Guangdong Key Laboratory of Plant Resources; School of Life Sciences; Sun Yat-sen University; P.R. China.	Plant innate immunity relies on successful detection of trespassing pathogens through recognizing their microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) at the cell surface. We recently reported two rice lysin motif (LysM)-containing proteins, OsLYP4 and OsLYP6, as dual functional PRRs sensing bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and fungal chitin. Here we further demonstrated the important roles of OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 in rice defense signaling, as silencing of either LYP impaired the defense marker gene activation induced by either bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzaecola or fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Moreover, we found that OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 could form homo- and hetero-dimers, and could interact with CEBiP, suggesting an unexpected complexity of chitin perception in rice.
NA	Identification and fine mapping of qGR6.2, a novel locus controlling rice seed germination under salt stress	2021	BMC Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Modern Crop Production, Cyrus Tang Innovation Center for Crop Seed Industry, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Background: Rice growth is frequently affected by salinity. When exposed to high salinity, rice seed germination and seedling establishment are significantly inhibited. With the promotion of direct-seeding in Asia, improving rice seed germination under salt stress is crucial for breeding.  Results: In this study, an indica landrace Wujiaozhan (WJZ) was identified with high germinability under salt stress. A BC1F2 population derived from the crossing WJZ/Nip (japonica, Nipponbare)//Nip, was used to quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping for the seed germination rate (GR) and germination index (GI) under H2O and 300 mM NaCl conditions. A total of 13 QTLs were identified, i.e. ten QTLs under H2O conditions and nine QTLs under salt conditions. Six QTLs, qGR6.1, qGR8.1, qGR8.2, qGR10.1, qGR10.2 and qGI10.1 were simultaneously identified under two conditions. Under salt conditions, three QTLs, qGR6.2, qGR10.1 and qGR10.2 for GR were identified at different time points during seed germination, which shared the same chromosomal region with qGI6.2, qGI10.1 and qGI10.2 for GI respectively. The qGR6.2 accounted for more than 20% of phenotypic variation under salt stress, as the major effective QTL. Furthermore, qGR6.2 was verified via the BC2F2 population and narrowed to a 65.9-kb region with eleven candidate genes predicted. Based on the microarray database, five candidate genes were found with high transcript abundances at the seed germination stage, of which LOC_Os06g10650 and LOC_Os06g10710 were differentially expressed after seed imbibition. RT-qPCR results showed the expression of LOC_Os06g10650 was significantly up-regulated in two parents with higher levels in WJZ than Nip during seed germination under salt conditions. Taken together, it suggests that LOC_Os06g10650, encoding tyrosine phosphatase family protein, might be the causal candidate gene for qGR6.2.  Conclusions: In this study, we identified 13 QTLs from a landrace WJZ that confer seed germination traits under H2O and salt conditions. A major salt-tolerance-specific QTL qGR6.2 was fine mapped to a 65.9-kb region. Our results provide information on the genetic basis of improving rice seed germination under salt stress by marker-assisted selection (MAS).
