LYP4|OsLYP4	LYP6|OsLYP6	Lysin motif-containing proteins LYP4 and LYP6 play dual roles in peptidoglycan and chitin perception in rice innate immunity	Here, we report two homologous rice (Oryza sativa) lysin motif-containing proteins, LYP4 and LYP6, as dual functional PRRs sensing bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and fungal chitin
LYP4|OsLYP4	LYP6|OsLYP6	Lysin motif-containing proteins LYP4 and LYP6 play dual roles in peptidoglycan and chitin perception in rice innate immunity	Collectively, our data support the notion that LYP4 and LYP6 are promiscuous PRRs for PGN and chitin in rice innate immunity
LYP4|OsLYP4	LYP6|OsLYP6	Lysin motif-containing proteins LYP4 and LYP6 play dual roles in peptidoglycan and chitin perception in rice innate immunity	Lysin motif-containing proteins LYP4 and LYP6 play dual roles in peptidoglycan and chitin perception in rice innate immunity
LYP4|OsLYP4	LYP6|OsLYP6	OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 play critical roles in rice defense signal transduction	We recently reported two rice lysin motif (LysM)-containing proteins, OsLYP4 and OsLYP6, as dual functional PRRs sensing bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and fungal chitin
LYP4|OsLYP4	LYP6|OsLYP6	OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 play critical roles in rice defense signal transduction	Here we further demonstrated the important roles of OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 in rice defense signaling, as silencing of either LYP impaired the defense marker gene activation induced by either bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzaecola or fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae
LYP4|OsLYP4	LYP6|OsLYP6	OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 play critical roles in rice defense signal transduction	Moreover, we found that OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 could form homo- and hetero-dimers, and could interact with CEBiP, suggesting an unexpected complexity of chitin perception in rice
LYP4|OsLYP4	LYP6|OsLYP6	OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 play critical roles in rice defense signal transduction	OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 play critical roles in rice defense signal transduction
CEBiP|OsCEBiP	LYP6|OsLYP6	OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 play critical roles in rice defense signal transduction	Moreover, we found that OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 could form homo- and hetero-dimers, and could interact with CEBiP, suggesting an unexpected complexity of chitin perception in rice
LYP6|OsLYP6	OsCERK1	OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity	OsCERK1 associated with OsLYP4 or OsLYP6 when induced by PGN but it associated with OsLYP4, OsLYP6, or CEBiP under chitin treatment, suggesting the presence of different patterns of ligand-induced heterooligomeric receptor complexes.
