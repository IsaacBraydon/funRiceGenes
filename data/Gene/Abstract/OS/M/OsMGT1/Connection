OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8|OsHK1;5	OsMGT1	A magnesium transporter OsMGT1 plays a critical role in salt tolerance in rice.	 Here, we show evidence that a rice Mg transporter OsMGT1 is required for the salt-tolerance probably by regulating transport activity of OsHKT1;5, a key transporter for the removal of Na+ from the xylem sap at the root mature zone
OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8|OsHK1;5	OsMGT1	A magnesium transporter OsMGT1 plays a critical role in salt tolerance in rice.	 Furthermore, knockout of OsHKT1;5 in osmgt1 mutant background did not further increase its salt sensitivity
OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8|OsHK1;5	OsMGT1	A magnesium transporter OsMGT1 plays a critical role in salt tolerance in rice.	 Taken together, our results suggest that Mg2+ transported by OsMGT1 in the root mature zone is required for enhancing OsHKT1;5 activity, thereby restricting Na accumulation to the shoots
