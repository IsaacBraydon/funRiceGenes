OsMGT1	aluminum	Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice	Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice
OsMGT1	transporter	Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice	 When a putative rice (Oryza sativa) Mg transporter gene, Oryza sativa MAGNESIUM TRANSPORTER1 (OsMGT1), was knocked out, the tolerance to Al, but not to cadmium and lanthanum, was decreased
OsMGT1	transporter	Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice	 Taken together, our results indicate that OsMGT1 is a transporter for Mg uptake in the roots and that up-regulation of this gene is required for conferring Al tolerance in rice by increasing Mg concentration in the cell

OsMGT1	cadmium	Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice	 When a putative rice (Oryza sativa) Mg transporter gene, Oryza sativa MAGNESIUM TRANSPORTER1 (OsMGT1), was knocked out, the tolerance to Al, but not to cadmium and lanthanum, was decreased
OsMGT1	root	Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice	 OsMGT1 was expressed in both the roots and shoots in the absence of Al, but the expression only in the roots was rapidly up-regulated by Al
