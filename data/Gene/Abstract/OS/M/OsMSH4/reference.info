NA	Crossover Formation During Rice Meiosis Relies on Interaction of OsMSH4 and OsMSH5.	2014	Genetics	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	MSH4 encodes a MutS protein that plays a specialized role in meiosis. In eukaryotic species, such as budding yeast, mice, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Arabidopsis, msh4 mutants display meiotic defects with a reduced number of chiasmata. Here, we characterized rice MSH4 by map-based cloning. In Osmsh4 mutants, the chiasma frequency was dramatically decreased to бл10% of the wild type, but the synaptonemal complex was normally installed. The double mutant analysis showed that in the Osmsh4 Osmsh5 mutant, the reduction of chiasmata was greater than other zmm mutants. This was consistent with the absence of localization for OsZIP4 and OsMER3 in Osmsh4 and suggests an earlier role for OsMSH4 and OsMSH5 than other ZMM proteins where they may be required to stabilize progenitor Holliday junctions. Using yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays, we verified the direct physical association between OsMSH4 and OsMSH5 and OsMSH5 and HEI10 in plants for the first time. The MSH4-MSH5 heterodimer has been demonstrated in mammals to stabilize the formation of progenitor and double Holliday junctions that may be resolved as crossovers (COs). We propose that OsMSH4 interacts with OsMSH5 to promote formation of the majority of COs in rice.
NA	The role of OsMSH4 in male and female gamete development in rice meiosis.	2015	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, PR China.	Meiosis is essential for gametogenesis in sexual reproduction in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We identified a MutS-homolog (MSH) family gene OsMSH4 in a trisomic plant. Cytological analysis showed that developments of both pollen and embryo sacs in an Osmsh4 mutant were blocked due to defective chromosome pairing. Compared with the wild type, the Osmsh4 mutant displayed a significant ~21.9% reduction in chiasma frequency, which followed a Poisson distribution, suggesting that class I crossover formation in the mutant was impaired. Temporal and spatial expression pattern analyses showed that OsMSH4 was preferentially expressed in meiocytes during their meiosis, indicating a critical role in gametogenesis. Subcellular localization showed that OsMSH4-green fluorescent protein was predominantly located in the nucleus. OsMSH4 could interact with another MSH member (OsMSH5) through the N-terminus and C-terminus, respectively. Direct physical interaction between OsMSH5, OsRPA1a, OsRPA2b, OsRPA1c, and OsRPA2c was identified by yeast two-hybrid assays and further validated by pull-down assays. Our results supported the conclusion that the OsMSH4/5 heterodimer plays a key role in regulation of crossover formation during rice meiosis by interaction with the RPA complex.
