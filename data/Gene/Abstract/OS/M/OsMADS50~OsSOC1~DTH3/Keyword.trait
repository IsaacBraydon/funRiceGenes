OsMADS50|OsSOC1|DTH3	flower	Reciprocal control of flowering time by OsSOC1 in transgenic Arabidopsis and by FLC in transgenic rice	In a screen for MADS box genes which activate and/or repress flowering in rice, we identified a gene encoding a MADS domain protein (OsSOC1) related to the Arabidopsis gene AtSOC1| The constitutive expression of OsSOC1 in Arabidopsis results in early flowering, suggesting that the rice gene is a functional equivalent of AtSOC1| We were not able to identify FLC-like sequences in the rice genome; however, we show that ectopic expression of the Arabidopsis FLC delays flowering in rice, and the up-regulation of OsSOC1 at the onset of flowering initiation is delayed in the AtFLC transgenic lines|Reciprocal control of flowering time by OsSOC1 in transgenic Arabidopsis and by FLC in transgenic rice
