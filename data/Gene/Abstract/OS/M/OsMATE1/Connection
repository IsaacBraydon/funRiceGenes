OsMATE1	OsMATE2	Expression of OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 alters development, stress responses and pathogen susceptibility in Arabidopsis	In this study, we functionally characterised two members of rice MATE gene family, OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 through expression in heterologous system, Arabidopsis
OsMATE1	OsMATE2	Expression of OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 alters development, stress responses and pathogen susceptibility in Arabidopsis	Our results reveal that OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 regulate plant growth and development as well as negatively affect disease resistance
