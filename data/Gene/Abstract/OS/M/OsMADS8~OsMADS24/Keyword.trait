OsMADS8|OsMADS24	stamen	Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)	 Plants affected in both OsMADS7 and OsMADS8 show severe phenotypes including late flowering, homeotic changes of lodicules, stamens and carpels into palea/lemma-like organs, and a loss of floral determinacy
OsMADS8|OsMADS24	flower	Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)	 Plants affected in both OsMADS7 and OsMADS8 show severe phenotypes including late flowering, homeotic changes of lodicules, stamens and carpels into palea/lemma-like organs, and a loss of floral determinacy
OsMADS8|OsMADS24	lemma	Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)	 Plants affected in both OsMADS7 and OsMADS8 show severe phenotypes including late flowering, homeotic changes of lodicules, stamens and carpels into palea/lemma-like organs, and a loss of floral determinacy
OsMADS8|OsMADS24	lemma	Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)	 Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs
