OsMADS7|OsMADS45	OsMADS8|OsMADS24	Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)	Plants affected in both OsMADS7 and OsMADS8 show severe phenotypes including late flowering, homeotic changes of lodicules, stamens and carpels into palea/lemma-like organs, and a loss of floral determinacy
OsMADS7|OsMADS45	OsMADS8|OsMADS24	Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)	Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs
OsMADS5	OsMADS8|OsMADS24	Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)	Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs

FCA|OsFCA	OsMADS8|OsMADS24	Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY	Here, we found that the OsFCA protein could interact through its WW domain with the following proteins: OsFY, a protein containing a CID domain present in RNA-processing factors such as Pcf11 and Nrd1; a protein similar to splicing factor SF1; a protein similar to FUSE splicing factor; and OsMADS8
OsFY	OsMADS8|OsMADS24	Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY	Here, we found that the OsFCA protein could interact through its WW domain with the following proteins: OsFY, a protein containing a CID domain present in RNA-processing factors such as Pcf11 and Nrd1; a protein similar to splicing factor SF1; a protein similar to FUSE splicing factor; and OsMADS8
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	OsMADS8|OsMADS24	Regulatory role of FZP in the determination of panicle branching and spikelet formation in rice.	FZP overexpression positively regulates the expression of a subset of the class B genes, AGL6 genes (OsMADS6 and OsMADS17) as well as class E genes (OsMADS1, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8) in floral meristem (FM)
