10.1007-s00425-011-1386-z.pdf	A novel rice calmodulin-like gene, OsMSR2, enhances drought and salt tolerance and increases ABA sensitivity in Arabidopsis	2011	Planta	Laboratory for Agro-ecological Process in the Subtropical Region, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hunan 410125, China.	Many abiotic stimuli, such as drought and salt stresses, elicit changes in intracellular calcium levels that serve to convey information and activate adaptive responses. Ca(2)(+) signals are perceived by different Ca(2)(+) sensors, and calmodulin (CaM) is one of the best-characterized Ca(2)(+) sensors in eukaryotes. Calmodulin-like (CML) proteins also exist in plants, but their functions at the physiological and molecular levels are largely unknown. In this report, we present data on OsMSR2 (Oryza sativa L. Multi-Stress-Responsive gene 2), a novel calmodulin-like protein gene isolated from rice Pei'ai 64S (Oryza sativa L.). Expression of OsMSR2 was strongly up-regulated by a wide spectrum of stresses, including cold, drought, and heat in different tissues at different developmental stages of rice, as revealed by both microarray and quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses. Analysis of the recombinant OsMSR2 protein demonstrated its potential ability to bind Ca(2)(+) in vitro. Expression of OsMSR2 conferred enhanced tolerance to high salt and drought in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accompanied by altered expression of stress/ABA-responsive genes. Transgenic plants also exhibited hypersensitivity to ABA during the seed germination and post-germination stages. The results suggest that expression of OsMSR2 modulated salt and drought tolerance in Arabidopsis through ABA-mediated pathways.
NA	Identification of candidate genes controlling chilling tolerance of rice in the cold region at the booting stage by BSA-Seq and RNA-Seq	2020	R Soc Open Sci	Rice Research Institute of Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jiamusi 154026, People's Republic of China.	Rice is sensitive to low temperatures, specifically at the booting stage. Chilling tolerance of rice is a quantitative trait loci that is governed by multiple genes, and thus, its precise identification through the conventional methods is an arduous task. In this study, we investigated the candidate genes related to chilling tolerance at the booting stage of rice. The F2 population was derived from Longjing25 (chilling-tolerant) and Longjing11 (chilling-sensitive) cross. Two bulked segregant analysis pools were constructed. A 0.82 Mb region containing 98 annotated genes on chromosomes 6 and 9 was recognized as the candidate region associated with chilling tolerance of rice at the booting stage. Transcriptomic analysis of Longjing25 and Longjing11 revealed 50 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) on the candidate intervals. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed. Nine pathways were found to be enriched, which contained 10 DEGs. A total of four genes had different expression patterns or levels between Longjing25 and Longjing11. Four out of the 10 DEGs were considered as potential candidate genes for chilling tolerance. This study will assist in the cloning of the candidate genes responsible for chilling tolerance and molecular breeding of rice for the development of chilling-tolerant rice varieties.
