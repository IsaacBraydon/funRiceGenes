OsMADS27	 Constitutive expression of OsMADS27 significantly inhibited the elongation of primary root (PR), but enhanced lateral root (LR) formation in a NO3--dependent manner |  Furthermore, OsMADS27 overexpression promoted NO3- accumulation as well as the expression of NO3- transporter genes |  The root growth and development in OsMADS27 overexpression lines was shown to be more sensitive to exogenous ABA than wild type |  Moreover, under NO3- conditions, higher levels of ABA accumulates in OsMADS27 overexpression plants |  More importantly, OsMADS27 overexpression could enhance the salt tolerance	 Furthermore, OsMADS27 overexpression promoted NO3- accumulation as well as the expression of NO3- transporter genes |  The root growth and development in OsMADS27 overexpression lines was shown to be more sensitive to exogenous ABA than wild type |  Moreover, under NO3- conditions, higher levels of ABA accumulates in OsMADS27 overexpression plants |  More importantly, OsMADS27 overexpression could enhance the salt tolerance
