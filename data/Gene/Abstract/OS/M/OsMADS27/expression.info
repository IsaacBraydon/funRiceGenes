OsMADS27	 Constitutive expression of OsMADS27 significantly inhibited the elongation of primary root (PR), but enhanced lateral root (LR) formation in a NO3--dependent manner |  Furthermore, OsMADS27 overexpression promoted NO3- accumulation as well as the expression of NO3- transporter genes |  The root growth and development in OsMADS27 overexpression lines was shown to be more sensitive to exogenous ABA than wild type |  Moreover, under NO3- conditions, higher levels of ABA accumulates in OsMADS27 overexpression plants |  More importantly, OsMADS27 overexpression could enhance the salt tolerance	 Furthermore, OsMADS27 overexpression promoted NO3- accumulation as well as the expression of NO3- transporter genes |  The root growth and development in OsMADS27 overexpression lines was shown to be more sensitive to exogenous ABA than wild type |  Moreover, under NO3- conditions, higher levels of ABA accumulates in OsMADS27 overexpression plants |  More importantly, OsMADS27 overexpression could enhance the salt tolerance
OsMADS27	 Although miR444 has the potential to target multiple genes, we identified OsMADS27 as the major miR444 target that regulates the expression of nitrate transporters, as well as several key genes including expansins, and those associated with auxin signalling, to promote root growth |  In agreement with this, overexpression of miRNA-resistant OsMADS27 improved root development and tolerance to abiotic stresses, while its silencing suppressed root growth	 In agreement with this, overexpression of miRNA-resistant OsMADS27 improved root development and tolerance to abiotic stresses, while its silencing suppressed root growth
