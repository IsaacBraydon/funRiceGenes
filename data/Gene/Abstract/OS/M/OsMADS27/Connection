OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsMADS27	OsMADS27 regulates the root development in a NO3--Dependent manner and modulates the salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that OsMADS27 physically interacts with ABA-INSENSITIVE5 (OsABI5) via DELLA protein OsSLR1

miR444	OsMADS27	Nitrate-dependent regulation of miR444-OsMADS27 signalling cascade controls root development in rice.	 Although miR444 has the potential to target multiple genes, we identified OsMADS27 as the major miR444 target that regulates the expression of nitrate transporters, as well as several key genes including expansins, and those associated with auxin signalling, to promote root growth
