NA	OsMADS27 regulates the root development in a NO3--Dependent manner and modulates the salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2018	Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Bioengineering College, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400030, PR China.	OsMADS27 is one of the ANR1-like homologues in rice, whreas its functions in plant growth and development as well as the abiotic stress responses remain unclear. Here we investigated the roles of OsMADS27 in the root development in response to NO3- availability. Constitutive expression of OsMADS27 significantly inhibited the elongation of primary root (PR), but enhanced lateral root (LR) formation in a NO3--dependent manner. Furthermore, OsMADS27 overexpression promoted NO3- accumulation as well as the expression of NO3- transporter genes. ABA is reported to play an important role in mediating the effects of NO3- on the root development, thus it is supposed that OsMADS27 might regulate the root growth and development by ABA pathway. The root growth and development in OsMADS27 overexpression lines was shown to be more sensitive to exogenous ABA than wild type. Moreover, under NO3- conditions, higher levels of ABA accumulates in OsMADS27 overexpression plants. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that OsMADS27 physically interacts with ABA-INSENSITIVE5 (OsABI5) via DELLA protein OsSLR1. More importantly, OsMADS27 overexpression could enhance the salt tolerance. Taken together, our findings suggested that OsMADS27 is an important regulator controlling the root system development and adaption to osmotic stress in rice.
NA	Nitrate-dependent regulation of miR444-OsMADS27 signalling cascade controls root development in rice.	2021	J Exp Bot	National Centre for Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, GKVK Campus, Bangalore, India.	Nitrate is an important nutrient and a key signalling molecule for plant development. A number of transcription factors involved in the response to nitrate and their regulatory mechanisms have been identified. However, little is known about the transcription factors involved in nitrate sensing and their regulatory mechanisms among crop plants. In this study, we identified functions of a nitrate-responsive miR444:MADS-box transcription factor OsMADS27 module and its downstream targets mediating rice root growth and stress responses. Transgenic rice plants expressing miR444 target mimic improved rice root growth. Although miR444 has the potential to target multiple genes, we identified OsMADS27 as the major miR444 target that regulates the expression of nitrate transporters, as well as several key genes including expansins, and those associated with auxin signalling, to promote root growth. In agreement with this, overexpression of miRNA-resistant OsMADS27 improved root development and tolerance to abiotic stresses, while its silencing suppressed root growth. OsMADS27 mediated robust stress tolerance in plants through its ability to bind to the promoters of specific stress regulators, as observed in ChIP-seq analysis. Our results provide evidence of a nitrate-dependent miR444-OsMADS27 signalling cascade involved in the regulation of rice root growth, as well as its surprising role in stress responses.

Salt stress is a major constraint on plant growth and yield. Nitrogen (N) fertilizers are known to alleviate salt stress. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that nitrate-dependent salt tolerance is mediated by OsMADS27 in rice. The expression of OsMADS27 is specifically induced by nitrate. The salt-inducible expression of OsMADS27 is also nitrate dependent. OsMADS27 knockout mutants are more sensitive to salt stress than the wild type, whereas OsMADS27 overexpression lines are more tolerant. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that OsMADS27 upregulates the expression of a number of known stress-responsive genes as well as those involved in ion homeostasis and antioxidation. We demonstrate that OsMADS27 directly binds to the promoters of OsHKT1.1 and OsSPL7 to regulate their expression. Notably, OsMADS27-mediated salt tolerance is nitrate dependent and positively correlated with nitrate concentration. Our results reveal the role of nitrate-responsive OsMADS27 and its downstream target genes in salt tolerance, providing a molecular mechanism for the enhancement of salt tolerance by nitrogen fertilizers in rice. OsMADS27 overexpression increased grain yield under salt stress in the presence of sufficient nitrate, suggesting that OsMADS27 is a promising candidate for the improvement of salt tolerance in rice.
