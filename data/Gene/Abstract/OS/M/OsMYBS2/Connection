OsMYBS1	OsMYBS2	Three Novel MYB Proteins with One DNA Binding Repeat Mediate Sugar and Hormone Regulation of alpha-Amylase Gene Expression	 In the present study, three cDNA clones encoding novel MYB proteins with single DNA binding domains were isolated from a rice suspension cell cDNA library and designated OsMYBS1, OsMYBS2, and OsMYBS3
OsMYBS1	OsMYBS2	Three Novel MYB Proteins with One DNA Binding Repeat Mediate Sugar and Hormone Regulation of alpha-Amylase Gene Expression	 Yeast one-hybrid experiments demonstrated that OsMYBS1 and OsMYBS2 bind to the TATCCA element and transactivate a promoter containing the TATCCA element in vivo
OsMYBS1	OsMYBS2	Three Novel MYB Proteins with One DNA Binding Repeat Mediate Sugar and Hormone Regulation of alpha-Amylase Gene Expression	 Transient expression assays with barley half-seeds showed that OsMYBS1 and OsMYBS2 transactivate a promoter containing the TATCCA element when sugar is provided, whereas OsMYBS3 represses transcription of the same promoter under sugar starvation
