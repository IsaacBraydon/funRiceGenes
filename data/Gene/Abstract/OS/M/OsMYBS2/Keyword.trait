OsMYBS2	seed	Three Novel MYB Proteins with One DNA Binding Repeat Mediate Sugar and Hormone Regulation of alpha-Amylase Gene Expression	Transient expression assays with barley half-seeds showed that OsMYBS1 and OsMYBS2 transactivate a promoter containing the TATCCA element when sugar is provided, whereas OsMYBS3 represses transcription of the same promoter under sugar starvation
OsMYBS2	cytoplasm	The coordination of OsbZIP72 and OsMYBS2 with reverse roles regulates the transcription of OsPsbS1 in rice	 GF14A protein affects the repression activity of OsMYBS2 by regulating its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, and Ser53 is necessary for OsMYBS2 to be retained in the cytoplasm
