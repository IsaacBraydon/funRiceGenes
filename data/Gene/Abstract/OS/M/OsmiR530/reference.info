NA	OsmiR530 acts downstream of OsPIL15 to regulate grain yield in rice.	2019	New Phytol	Shandong Rice Engineering Technology Research Center, Shandong Rice Research Institute, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan, 250100, China.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that play important roles in plant growth and development as well as in stress responses. However, little is known about their regulatory functions affecting the rice grain yield. We functionally characterized a novel miRNA in rice, OsmiR530, its target OsPL3, and its upstream regulator phytochrome-interacting factor-like 15 (OsPIL15). Their effects on rice yield were comprehensively dissected. We determined that OsmiR530 negatively regulates grain yield. Blocking OsmiR530 increases grain yield, whereas OsmiR530 overexpression significantly decreases grain size and panicle branching, leading to yield loss. Additionally, OsPL3, which encodes a PLUS3 domain-containing protein, is directly targeted by OsmiR530. Knocking out OsPL3 decreases the grain yield. In-depth analyses indicated that OsPIL15 activates OsMIR530 expression by directly binding to the G-box elements in the promoter. Analyses of genetic variations suggested that the OsMIR530 locus has likely been subjected to artificial selection during rice breeding. The results presented herein reveal a novel OsPIL15-OsmiR530 module controlling the rice grain yield and provide researchers with a new target for the breeding of high-yielding rice.
NA	Blocking miR530 Improves Rice Resistance, Yield, and Maturity.	2021	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.	MicroRNAs fine-tune plant growth and resistance against multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. The trade-off between biomass and resistance can penalize crop yield. In this study, we have shown that rice miR530 regulates blast disease resistance, yield, and growth period. While the overexpression of miR530 results in compromised blast disease resistance, reduced grain yield, and late maturity, blocking miR530 using a target mimic (MIM530) leads to enhanced resistance, increased grain yield, and early maturity. Further study revealed that the accumulation of miR530 was decreased in both leaves and panicles along with the increase of age. Such expression patterns were accordant with the enhanced resistance from seedlings to adult plants, and the grain development from panicle formation to fully-filled seeds. Divergence analysis of miR530 precursor with upstream 1,000-bp promoter sequence in 11 rice species revealed that miR530 was diverse in Oryza sativa japonica and O. sativa indica group, which was consistent with the different accumulation of miR530 in japonica accessions and indica accessions. Altogether, our results indicate that miR530 coordinates rice resistance, yield, and maturity, thus providing a potential regulatory module for breeding programs aiming to improve yield and disease resistance.
