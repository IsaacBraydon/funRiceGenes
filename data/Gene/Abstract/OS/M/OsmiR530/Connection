OsmiR530	OsPIL15	OsmiR530 acts downstream of OsPIL15 to regulate grain yield in rice.	OsmiR530 acts downstream of OsPIL15 to regulate grain yield in rice.
OsmiR530	OsPIL15	OsmiR530 acts downstream of OsPIL15 to regulate grain yield in rice.	 We functionally characterized a novel miRNA in rice, OsmiR530, its target OsPL3, and its upstream regulator phytochrome-interacting factor-like 15 (OsPIL15)
OsmiR530	OsPIL15	OsmiR530 acts downstream of OsPIL15 to regulate grain yield in rice.	 In-depth analyses indicated that OsPIL15 activates OsMIR530 expression by directly binding to the G-box elements in the promoter
