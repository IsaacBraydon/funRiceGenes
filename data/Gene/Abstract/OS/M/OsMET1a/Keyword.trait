OsMet1-1|OsMET1a	root	Alternative splicing of the rice OsMET1 genes encoding maintenance DNA methyltransferase	The transcripts of OsMET1b accumulate more abundantly than those of OsMET1a in all of the tissues examined, and both genes actively transcribed at the callus, imbibed embryo, root, meristem, young panicle, anther, pistil, and endosperm, all of which contain actively dividing cells
