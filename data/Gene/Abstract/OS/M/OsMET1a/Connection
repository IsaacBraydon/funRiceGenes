OsMet1-1|OsMET1a|OsDMT702	OsMet1-2|OsMET1b	Alternative splicing of the rice OsMET1 genes encoding maintenance DNA methyltransferase	While the Arabidopsis genome carries one copy of the methyltransferase 1 (MET1) gene for DNA methyltransferase, which is mainly responsible for maintaining CpG methylation, the rice genome bears two copies of the MET1 genes, OsMET1a and OsMET1b
OsMet1-1|OsMET1a|OsDMT702	OsMet1-2|OsMET1b	Alternative splicing of the rice OsMET1 genes encoding maintenance DNA methyltransferase	The transcripts of OsMET1b accumulate more abundantly than those of OsMET1a in all of the tissues examined, and both genes actively transcribed at the callus, imbibed embryo, root, meristem, young panicle, anther, pistil, and endosperm, all of which contain actively dividing cells
