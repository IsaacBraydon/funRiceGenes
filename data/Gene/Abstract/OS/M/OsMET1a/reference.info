While the Arabidopsis genome carries one copy of the methyltransferase 1 (MET1) gene for DNA methyltransferase, which is mainly responsible for maintaining CpG methylation, the rice genome bears two copies of the MET1 genes, OsMET1a and OsMET1b. The transcripts of OsMET1b accumulate more abundantly than those of OsMET1a in all of the tissues examined, and both genes actively transcribed at the callus, imbibed embryo, root, meristem, young panicle, anther, pistil, and endosperm, all of which contain actively dividing cells. The OsMET1a transcripts contain two 5'-untranslated exons and alternatively spliced 3'-terminal exons. The alternatively spliced transcripts consist of 14, 15, or 16 exons, and all of them encode a putative protein of 1527 amino acids. While the 3'-terminal exon of OsMET1b is unique, alternative splicing occurs in the 5'-terminal regions, which comprise either exons containing 5'-untranslated regions or an exon bearing the initiation codon. Depending upon alternative usage of 5' exons by alternative splicing, the OsMET1b transcripts comprise 11, 12, 13, or 14 exons, and the former two and the latter two longer transcripts encode putative proteins of 1486 and 1529 amino acids, respectively. Moreover, the 5' splicing patterns of OsMET1b can vary in different tissues. These findings are discussed with respect to the possible regulation of the OsMET1 genes.

Epigenetic modification is essential for normal development and plays important roles in gene regulation in higher plants. Multiple factors interact to regulate the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation in plant genome. We had previously cloned and characterized DNA methyltransferase (DNA MTase) gene homologues (OsMET1) from rice. In this present study, determination of DNA MTase activity in different cellular compartments showed that DNA MTase was enriched in nuclei and the activity was remarkably increased during imbibing dry seeds. We had optimized the purification technique for DNA MTase enzyme from shoots of 10-day-old rice seedlings using the three successive chromatographic columns. The Econo-Pac Q, the Hitrap-Heparin and the Superdex-200 columns yielded a protein fraction of a specific activity of 29, 298 and 800 purification folds, compared to the original nuclear extract, respectively. The purified protein preferred hemi-methylated DNA substrate, suggesting the maintenance activity of methylation. The native rice DNA MTase was approximately 160-170 kDa and exhibited a broad pH optimum in the range of 7.6 and 8.0. The enzyme kinetics and inhibitory effects by methyl donor analogs, base analogs, cations, and cationic amines on rice DNA MTase were examined. Global cytosine methylation status of rice genome during development and in various tissue culture systems were monitored and the results suggested that the cytosine methylation level is not directly correlated with the DNA MTase activity. The purification and characterization of rice DNA MTase enzyme are expected to enhance our understanding of this enzyme function and their possible contributions in Gramineae plant development.
j.1365-313X.2008.03624.x.pdf	De novo DNA methylation induced by siRNA targeted to endogenous transcribed sequences is gene-specific and OsMet1-independent in rice	2008	Plant J	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma 630-0101, Japan.	Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is an essential factor for epigenetic modification of the genome. Recent studies have suggested that endogenous siRNAs induce DNA methylation, chromatin modification and chromatin inactivation at homologous sequences. We have shown that siRNAs targeted to promoter regions of endogenous rice genes induce strong DNA methylation of the targeted sequences, but transcriptional gene silencing is rarely observed. Here, an analysis of epigenetic modifications induced by RNAi targeted to transcribed regions of endogenous rice genes shows that the effects of siRNA are gene-specific, but that they tend to induce higher de novo DNA methylation of CpG dinucleotides than of other cytosines. However, loss of OsMet1 expression by RNAi did not significantly affect levels and patterns of de novo DNA methylation or post-transcriptional mRNA suppression. We also showed that sequence-specific de novo DNA methylation extended both 5' and 3' of the targeted sequences, but there was no significant extension of siRNA signals either 5' or 3'. These results suggest that exogenous siRNAs are strong inducers of de novo DNA methylation in transcribed sequences of rice endogenous genes, but are insufficient to induce heterochromatin formation.
j.1365-313X.2009.03947.x.pdf	Homologous recombination-mediated knock-in targeting of the MET1a gene for a maintenance DNA methyltransferase reproducibly reveals dosage-dependent spatiotemporal gene expression in rice	2009	Plant J	National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki 444-8585, Japan.	Although homologous recombination-promoted knock-in targeting to monitor the expression of a gene by fusing a reporter gene with its promoter is routine practice in mice, gene targeting to modify endogenous genes in flowering plants remains in its infancy. In the knock-in targeting, the junction sequence between a reporter gene and an endogenous target promoter can be designed properly, and transgenic plants carrying an identical and desired knock-in allele can be repeatedly obtained. By employing a reproducible gene-targeting procedure with positive-negative selection in rice, we were able to obtain fertile transgenic knock-in plants with the promoterless GUS reporter gene encoding beta-glucuronidase fused with the endogenous promoter of MET1a, one of two rice MET1 genes encoding a maintenance DNA methyltransferase. All of the primary (T(0)) transgenic knock-in plants obtained were found to carry only one copy of GUS, with the anticipated structure in the heterozygous condition, and no ectopic events associated with gene targeting could be detected. We showed the reproducible, dosage-dependent and spatiotemporal expression of GUS in the selfed progenies of independently isolated knock-in targeted plants. The results in knock-in targeted plants contrast sharply with the results in transgenic plants with the MET1a promoter-fused GUS reporter gene integrated randomly in the genome: clear interindividual variation of GUS expression was observed among independently obtained plants bearing the randomly integrated transgenes. As our homologous recombination-mediated gene-targeting strategy with positive-negative selection is, in principle, applicable to modify any endogenous gene, knock-in targeting would facilitate basic and applied plant research.
NA	Alterations of Rice ( Oryza sativa L.) DNA Methylation Patterns Associated with Gene Expression in Response to Rice Black Streaked Dwarf Virus	2020	Int J Mol Sci	College of Horticulture and Plant Protection, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, China.	Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) causes severe yield losses in rice (Oryza sativa L.) in China. Studies have shown that the mechanisms of DNA methylation-mediated plant defense against DNA viruses and RNA viruses are different. However, in rice its function in response to infection of RBSDV, a double-stranded RNA virus, remains unclear. In this study, high-throughput single-base resolution bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq) was carried out to analyze the distribution pattern and characteristics of cytosine methylation in RBSDV-infected rice. Widespread differences were identified in CG and non-CG contexts between the RBSDV-infected and RBSDV-free rice. We identified a large number of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) along the genome of RBSDV-infected rice. Additionally, the transcriptome sequencing analysis obtained 1119 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Correlation analysis of DMRs-related genes (DMGs) and DEGs filtered 102 genes with positive correlation and 71 genes with negative correlation between methylation level at promoter regions and gene expression. Key genes associated with maintaining DNA methylation in rice were analyzed by RT-qPCR and indicated that OsDMT702 might be responsible for the global increase of DNA methylation level in rice under RBSDV stress. Our results suggest important roles of rice DNA methylation in response to RBSDV and provide potential target genes for rice antiviral immunity.
