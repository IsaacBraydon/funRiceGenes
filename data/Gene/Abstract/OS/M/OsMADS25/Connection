OsMADS25	OsP5CR	Rice transcription factor OsMADS25 modulates root growth and confers salinity tolerance via the ABA-mediated regulatory pathway and ROS scavenging.	 Furthermore, OsMADS25 specifically activated the transcription of OsP5CR, a key component of proline biosynthesis, by binding to its promoter
OsGST4	OsMADS25	Rice transcription factor OsMADS25 modulates root growth and confers salinity tolerance via the ABA-mediated regulatory pathway and ROS scavenging.	 Transcriptional activation assays indicated that OsMADS25 activates OsGST4 (glutathione S-transferase) expression directly by binding to its promoter
OsMADS25	OsYUCCA4|OsYUC4	Rice transcription factor OsMADS25 modulates root growth and confers salinity tolerance via the ABA-mediated regulatory pathway and ROS scavenging.	 In addition, OsMADS25 seemed to promote auxin signaling by activating OsYUC4 transcription
OsMADS25	OsR3L1	OsHyPRP06/R3L1 regulates root system development and salt tolerance via apoplastic ROS homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 The expression of OsR3L1 was initiated by the OsMADS25 transcription factor
