OsMADS25	OsP5CR	Rice transcription factor OsMADS25 modulates root growth and confers salinity tolerance via the ABA-mediated regulatory pathway and ROS scavenging.	 Furthermore, OsMADS25 specifically activated the transcription of OsP5CR, a key component of proline biosynthesis, by binding to its promoter
OsGST4	OsMADS25	Rice transcription factor OsMADS25 modulates root growth and confers salinity tolerance via the ABA-mediated regulatory pathway and ROS scavenging.	 Transcriptional activation assays indicated that OsMADS25 activates OsGST4 (glutathione S-transferase) expression directly by binding to its promoter
OsMADS25	OsYUCCA4|OsYUC4	Rice transcription factor OsMADS25 modulates root growth and confers salinity tolerance via the ABA-mediated regulatory pathway and ROS scavenging.	 In addition, OsMADS25 seemed to promote auxin signaling by activating OsYUC4 transcription
OsMADS25	OsR3L1	OsHyPRP06/R3L1 regulates root system development and salt tolerance via apoplastic ROS homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 The expression of OsR3L1 was initiated by the OsMADS25 transcription factor
OsARF7	OsMADS25	Nuclear translocation of OsMADS25 facilitated by OsNAR2.1 in response to nitrate signal promotes root growth by regulating the expression of OsMADS27 and OsARF7 in rice.	Nuclear translocation of OsMADS25 facilitated by OsNAR2.1 in response to nitrate signal promotes root growth by regulating the expression of OsMADS27 and OsARF7 in rice.
OsARF7	OsMADS25	Nuclear translocation of OsMADS25 facilitated by OsNAR2.1 in response to nitrate signal promotes root growth by regulating the expression of OsMADS27 and OsARF7 in rice.	 Secondly, our ChIP-seq, ChIP-qPCR, Y1H and LUC experiments showed that OsMADS25 could directly activate the expression of OsMADS27 and OsARF7, which were reported to associate with root growth
OsARF7	OsMADS25	Nuclear translocation of OsMADS25 facilitated by OsNAR2.1 in response to nitrate signal promotes root growth by regulating the expression of OsMADS27 and OsARF7 in rice.	1, which is required for nuclear accumulation of OsMADS25, further to promote the expression of OsMADS27 and OsARF7 and root growth in a nitrate dependent manner
