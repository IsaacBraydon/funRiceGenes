OsMIR168a	seedling	CRISPR-Cas9 mediated OsMIR168a knockout reveals its pleiotropy in rice.	 The rice OsMIR168a mutants grew rapidly at the seedling stage, produced more tillers, and matured early
OsMIR168a	transcriptional regulator	CRISPR-Cas9 mediated OsMIR168a knockout reveals its pleiotropy in rice.	 Many protein-coding genes and miRNAs showed differential expression in the OsMIR168a mutants, suggesting OsMIR168a exerts a major transcriptional regulatory role, likely through its potential target genes such as OsAGO1s and OsAGO18
