AGO18|OsAGO18	OsMIR168a	CRISPR-Cas9 mediated OsMIR168a knockout reveals its pleiotropy in rice.	 Intriguingly, OsAGO18, a member of a new AGO clade that is conserved in monocots, was confirmed to be a target of OsMIR168a not only by informatic prediction but also by expression analysis and a cell-based cleavage assay in the OsMIR168a mutants
AGO18|OsAGO18	OsMIR168a	CRISPR-Cas9 mediated OsMIR168a knockout reveals its pleiotropy in rice.	 Many protein-coding genes and miRNAs showed differential expression in the OsMIR168a mutants, suggesting OsMIR168a exerts a major transcriptional regulatory role, likely through its potential target genes such as OsAGO1s and OsAGO18
OsAGO1a	OsMIR168a	CRISPR-Cas9 mediated OsMIR168a knockout reveals its pleiotropy in rice.	 Analysis of gene expression showed that the transcription levels of OsMIR168a&#39;s target genes such as OsAGO1a, OsAGO1b and OsAGO1d were elevated significantly in the OsMIR168a mutants
OsAGO1b	OsMIR168a	CRISPR-Cas9 mediated OsMIR168a knockout reveals its pleiotropy in rice.	 Analysis of gene expression showed that the transcription levels of OsMIR168a&#39;s target genes such as OsAGO1a, OsAGO1b and OsAGO1d were elevated significantly in the OsMIR168a mutants
OsAGO1d	OsMIR168a	CRISPR-Cas9 mediated OsMIR168a knockout reveals its pleiotropy in rice.	 Analysis of gene expression showed that the transcription levels of OsMIR168a&#39;s target genes such as OsAGO1a, OsAGO1b and OsAGO1d were elevated significantly in the OsMIR168a mutants
