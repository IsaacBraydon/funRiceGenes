The toxic metalloid arsenite has become a potential threat to rice growing regions leading to serious contamination in food chain. In the present study effect of different physiological concentration of arsenite that is toxic and triggers the molecular events were evaluated in rice seedlings. Along with severe effect on the growth of rice seedling, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) in arsenite treated rice roots was also observed. Activation of a 42kDa mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK/MPK) by arsenite was observed in rice leaves and 42 and 44kDa in roots in dose dependent manner. The activated MAPK could be immunoprecipitated with anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody, 4G10. The kinetic of MAPK activation by arsenite was found to be dose dependent. Transcript analysis of MAPK family and immunokinase assay in arsenite treated rice seedling revealed significant level of induction in OsMPK3 transcripts in leaves and OsMPK3, OsMPK4 transcripts in roots. Among MAPK kinase (MKKs) gene family, OsMKK4 transcripts were found to be induced in arsenite treated rice leaves and roots. In-silico homology modeling and docking analysis supported OsMPK3-OsMKK4 interaction. The data indicates that arsenite stress is transduced through MAPK signaling cascade in rice.
Kim-2012-The bHLH Rac Immunit.pdf	The bHLH Rac Immunity1 (RAI1) Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma, Japan.	The Rac/Rop GTPase OsRac1 plays an essential role in rice immunity. However, the regulatory genes acting downstream of OsRac1 are largely unknown. We focused on the RAI1 gene, which is up-regulated in suspension cells expressing a constitutively active form of OsRac1. RAI1 encodes a putative basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. A microarray analysis of cells transformed with an inducible RAI1 construct showed increased expression of PAL1 and OsWRKY19 genes after induction, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RAI1. This was confirmed using RAI1 T-DNA activation-tagged and RNA interference lines. The PAL1 and OsWRKY19 genes were also up-regulated by sphingolipid and chitin elicitors, and the RAI1 activation-tagged plants had increased resistance to a rice blast fungus. These results indicated that RAI1 is involved in defense responses in rice. RAI1 interacted with OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 proteins in vivo and in vitro. Also, RAI1 was phosphorylated by OsMAPK3/6 and OsMKK4-dd in vitro. Overexpression of OsMAPK6 and/or OsMAPK3 together with OsMKK4-dd increased PAL1 and OsWRKY19 expression in rice protoplasts. Therefore, the regulation of PAL1 and OsWRKY19 expression by RAI1 could be controlled via an OsMKK4-OsMAPK3/6 cascade. Co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that OsMAPK3 and OsRac1 occur in the same complex as OsMAPK6. Taken together, our results indicate that RAI1 could be regulated by OsRac1 through an OsMAPK3/6 cascade. In this study, we have identified RAI1 as the first transcription factor acting downstream of OsRac1. This work will help us to understand the immune system regulated by OsRac1 in rice and its orthologs in other plant species.
tpj12405.pdf	SMALL GRAIN 1, which encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4, influences grain size in rice	2014	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Cell and Chromosome Engineering, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China.	Although grain size is one of the most important components of grain yield, little information is known about the mechanisms that determine final grain size in crops. Here we characterize rice small grain1 (smg1) mutants, which exhibit small and light grains, dense and erect panicles and comparatively slightly shorter plants. The short grain and panicle phenotypes of smg1 mutants are caused by a defect in cell proliferation. The smg1 mutations were identified, using a map-based cloning approach, in mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (OsMKK4). Relatively higher expression of OsMKK4/SMG1 was detected in younger organs than in older ones, consistent with its role in cell proliferation. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-OsMKK4/SMG1 fusion proteins appear to be distributed ubiquitously in plant cells. Further results revealed that OsMKK4 influenced brassinosteroid (BR) responses and the expression of BR-related genes. Thus, our findings have identified OsMKK4 as a factor for grain size, and suggest a possible link between the MAPK pathways and BRs in grain growth.
NA	Involvement of the OsMKK4-OsMPK1 Cascade and its Downstream Transcription Factor OsWRKY53 in the Wounding Response in Rice	2014	Plant Pathol J	Department of Plant Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 500-757, Korea.	Plant has possessed diverse stress signals from outside and maintained its fitness. Out of such plant responses, it is well known that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade plays important role in wounding and pathogen attack in most dicot plants. However, little is understood about its role in wounding response for the economically important monocot rice plant. In this study, therefore, the involvement of MAPK was investigated to understand the wounding signaling pathway in rice. The OsMPK1 was rapidly activated by wounding within 10 min, and OsMPK1 was also activated by challenge of rice blast fungus. Further analysis revealed that OsMKK4, the upstream kinase of OsMPK1, phosphorylated OsMPK1 by wounding in vivo. Furthermore, OsMPK1 directly interacted with a rice defense-related transcription factor OsWRKY53. To understand a functional link between MAPK and its target transcription factor, we showed that OsMPK1 activated by the constitutively active mutant OsMKK4(DD) phosphorylated OsWRKY53 in vitro. Taken together, components involving in the wounding signaling pathway, OsMKK4-OsMPK1-OsWRKY53, can be important players in regulating crosstalk between abiotic stress and biotic stress.
NA	Control of grain size and weight by the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMAPK6 signaling pathway in rice.	2018	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Cell and Chromosome Engineering, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; CAS Centre for Excellence in Molecular Plant Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Grain size is one of the key agronomic traits that determine grain yield in crops. However, the mechanisms underlying grain size control in crops remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMAPK6 signaling pathway positively regulates grain size and weight in rice. Loss of OsMKKK10 function results in small and light grains, short panicles and semi-dwarf plants, while overexpression of constitutively active OsMKKK10 (CA-OsMKKK10) causes large and heavy grains, long panicles and tall plants in rice. OsMKKK10 interacts with and phosphorylates OsMKK4. We identify a gain-of-function mutant of OsMKK4 (large11-1D), which causes large and heavy grains. OsMKK4A227T encoded by the large11-1D allele has stronger kinase activity than OsMKK4. Overexpression of a constitutively active OsMKK4 (OsMKK4-DD) also forms large grains. Further biochemical and genetic analyses reveal that OsMKKK10, OsMKK4 and OsMAPK6 function in a common pathway to control grain size. Thus, our findings reveal an important genetic and molecular framework for the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMAPK6 cascade-mediated control of grain size and weight in rice.
NA	ERECTA1 Acts Upstream of the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 Cascade to Control Spikelet Number by Regulating Cytokinin Metabolism in Rice 	2020	plant cell	Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, SIBS, CAS CITY: Shanghai China [CN].	Grain number is a flexible trait that strongly contributes to grain yield. In rice (Oryza sativa), the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 cascade, which is negatively regulated by the dual-specificity phosphatase GSN1, coordinates the trade-off between grain number and grain size. However, the specific components upstream and downstream of the GSN1-MAPK module that regulate spikelet number per panicle remain obscure. Here, we report that ERECTA1 (OsER1), a negative regulator of spikelet number per panicle, acts upstream of the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 cascade and that the OsER1-OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 pathway is required to maintain cytokinin homeostasis. OsMPK6 directly interacts with and phosphorylates the zinc finger transcription factor DST to enhance its transcriptional activation of CYTOKININ OXIDASE2 (OsCKX2), indicating that the OsER1-OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 pathway shapes panicle morphology by regulating cytokinin metabolism. Furthermore, overexpression of either DST or OsCKX2 rescued the spikelet number phenotype of the oser1, osmkkk10, osmkk4, and osmpk6 mutants, suggesting that the DST-OsCKX2 module genetically functions downstream of the OsER1-OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 pathway. These findings reveal specific crosstalk between a MAPK signaling pathway and cytokinin metabolism, shedding light on how developmental signals modulate phytohormone homeostasis to shape the inflorescence. 
NA	OrMKK3 Influences Morphology and Grain Size in Rice	2021	J Plant Biol	Rice Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences/Guangxi Key Laboratory of Rice Genetics and Breeding, Nanning, 530007 China.	Although morphology and grain size are important to rice growth and yield, the identity of abundant natural allelic variations that determine agronomically important differences in crops is unknown. Here, we characterized the function of mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 from Oryza officinalis Wall. ex Watt encoded by OrMKK3. Different alternative splicing variants occurred in OrMKK3. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-OrMKK3 fusion proteins localized to the cell membrane and nuclei of rice protoplasts. Overexpression of OrMKK3 influenced the expression levels of the grain size-related genes SMG1, GW8, GL3, GW2, and DEP3. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OrMKK3 is well conserved in plants while showing large amounts of variation between indica, japonica, and wild rice. In addition, OrMKK3 slightly influenced brassinosteroid (BR) responses and the expression levels of BR-related genes. Our findings thus identify a new gene, OrMKK3, influencing morphology and grain size and that represents a possible link between mitogen-activated protein kinase and BR response pathways in grain growth.
