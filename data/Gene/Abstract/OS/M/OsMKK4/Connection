OsMKK4	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	The bHLH Rac Immunity1 (RAI1) Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity	Overexpression of OsMAPK6 and/or OsMAPK3 together with OsMKK4-dd increased PAL1 and OsWRKY19 expression in rice protoplasts
OsMKK4	RAI1	The bHLH Rac Immunity1 (RAI1) Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity	Also, RAI1 was phosphorylated by OsMAPK3/6 and OsMKK4-dd in vitro
OsMKK4	RAI1	The bHLH Rac Immunity1 (RAI1) Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity	Therefore, the regulation of PAL1 and OsWRKY19 expression by RAI1 could be controlled via an OsMKK4-OsMAPK3/6 cascade
OsMKK4	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	Involvement of the OsMKK4-OsMPK1 Cascade and its Downstream Transcription Factor OsWRKY53 in the Wounding Response in Rice	Further analysis revealed that OsMKK4, the upstream kinase of OsMPK1, phosphorylated OsMPK1 by wounding in vivo.
OsMKK4	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsMAPK6, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, influences rice grain size and biomass production	As a functional kinase, OsMAPK6 interacts strongly with OsMKK4, indicating that OsMKK4 is likely to be the upstream MAPKK of OsMAPK6 in rice.
OsMKK4	OsMKP1|GSN1	GRAIN SIZE AND NUMBER1 Negatively Regulates the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 Cascade to Coordinate the Trade-off between Grain Number per Panicle and Grain Size in Rice.	 Consistent with this finding, the suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase genes OsMPK6, OsMKK4, and OsMKKK10 separately resulted in denser panicles and smaller grains, which rescued the mutant gsn1 phenotypes
