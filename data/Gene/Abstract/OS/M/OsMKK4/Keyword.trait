OsMKK4	brassinosteroid	SMALL GRAIN 1, which encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4, influences grain size in rice	 Further results revealed that OsMKK4 influenced brassinosteroid (BR) responses and the expression of BR-related genes
OsMKK4	root	Arsenic stress activates MAP kinase in rice roots and leaves	 Among MAPK kinase (MKKs) gene family, OsMKK4 transcripts were found to be induced in arsenite treated rice leaves and roots
OsMKK4	arsenite	Arsenic stress activates MAP kinase in rice roots and leaves	 Among MAPK kinase (MKKs) gene family, OsMKK4 transcripts were found to be induced in arsenite treated rice leaves and roots
OsMKK4	grain	SMALL GRAIN 1, which encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4, influences grain size in rice	 Thus, our findings have identified OsMKK4 as a factor for grain size, and suggest a possible link between the MAPK pathways and BRs in grain growth
OsMKK4	grain size	SMALL GRAIN 1, which encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4, influences grain size in rice	 Thus, our findings have identified OsMKK4 as a factor for grain size, and suggest a possible link between the MAPK pathways and BRs in grain growth
OsMKK4	growth	SMALL GRAIN 1, which encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4, influences grain size in rice	 Thus, our findings have identified OsMKK4 as a factor for grain size, and suggest a possible link between the MAPK pathways and BRs in grain growth
