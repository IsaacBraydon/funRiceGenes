NA	Rice microtubule-associated protein OsMAP65-3.1, but not OsMAP65-3.2, plays a critical role in phragmoplast microtubule organization in cytokinesis.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Crop Physiology, Ecology, and Genetic Breeding of the Ministry of Education, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China.	In plants, MAP65 preferentially cross-links the anti-parallel microtubules (MTs) and plays an important role for cytokinesis. However, the functions of MAP65 isoforms in rice (Oryza sativa. L) are largely unknown. Here, we identified two MAP65-3 homologs in rice, OsMAP65-3.1 and OsMAP65-3.2. We found that both OsMAP65-3.1 and OsMAP65-3.2 were similar in dimerization and location to AtMAP65-3, and the expression of either rice genes driven by the AtMAP65-3 promoter suppressed the cytokinesis failure and growth defect of atmap65-3. However, OsMAP65-3.1 with native promoter also recovered the atmap65-3, but OsMAP65-3.2 with its own promoter had no effects. OsMAP65-3.1 but not OsMAP65-3.2 was actively expressed in tissues enriched with dividing cells. R1R2R3-Myb (MYB3R) transcription factors directly bound to the OsMAP65-3.1 promoter but not that of OsMAP65-3.2. Furthermore, osmap65-3.2 had no obvious phenotype, while either osmap65-3.1 or osmap65-3.1(+/-) was lethal. The eminent MTs around the daughter nuclei and cytokinesis defects were frequently observed in OsMAP65-3.1-defective plants. Taken together, our findings suggest that OsMAP65-3.1, rather than OsMAP65-3.2, plays essential roles in rice cytokinesis resulting from their differential expression which were passably directly regulated by OsMYB3Rs.
