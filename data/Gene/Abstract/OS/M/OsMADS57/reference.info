ncomms2542.pdf	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	2013	Nat Commun	The Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	Rice tillering is a multigenic trait that influences grain yield, but its regulation molecular module is poorly understood. Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice. An activation-tagged mutant osmads57-1 and OsMADS57-overexpression lines showed increased tillers, whereas OsMADS57 antisense lines had fewer tillers. OsMIR444a-overexpressing lines exhibited suppressed OsMADS57 expression and tillering. Furthermore, osmads57-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57's function in tillering was dependent on D14. D14 expression was downregulated in osmads57-1, but upregulated in antisense and OsMIR444a-overexpressing lines. OsMADS57 bound to the CArG motif [C(A/T)TTAAAAAG] in the promoter and directly suppressed D14 expression. Interaction of OsMADS57 with OsTB1 reduced OsMADS57 inhibition of D14 transcription. Therefore, OsMIR444a-regulated OsMADS57, together with OsTB1, target D14 to control tillering. This regulation mechanism could have important application in rice molecular breeding programs focused on high grain yield.
NA	OsMADS57 together with OsTB1 coordinates transcription of its target OsWRKY94 and D14 to switch its organogenesis to defense for cold adaptation in rice.	2018	New Phytol	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China.	Plants modify their development to adapt to their environment, protecting themselves from detrimental conditions such as chilling stress by triggering a variety of signaling pathways; however, little is known about how plants coordinate developmental patterns and stress responses at the molecular level. Here, we demonstrate that interacting transcription factors OsMADS57 and OsTB1 directly target the defense gene OsWRKY94 and the organogenesis gene D14 to trade off the functions controlling/moderating rice tolerance to cold. Overexpression of OsMADS57 maintains rice tiller growth under chilling stress. OsMADS57 binds directly to the promoter of OsWRKY94, activating its transcription for the cold stress response, while suppressing its activity under normal temperatures. In addition, OsWRKY94 was directly targeted and suppressed by OsTB1 under both normal and chilling temperatures. However, D14 transcription was directly promoted by OsMADS57 for suppressing tillering under the chilling treatment, whereas D14 was repressed for enhancing tillering under normal condition.We demonstrated that OsMADS57 and OsTB1 conversely affect rice chilling tolerance via targeting OsWRKY94. Our findings highlight a molecular genetic mechanism coordinating organogenesis and chilling tolerance in rice, which supports and extends recent work suggesting that chilling stress environments influence organ differentiation.
NA	A Transcription Factor, OsMADS57, Regulates Long-distance Nitrate Transport and Root Elongation.	2019	Plant Physiol	Xinyang Agriculture and Forestry University CITY: Xinyang China [CN].	Root nitrate uptake adjusts to the plant's nitrogen demand for growth. Here we report that OsMADS57, a MADS-box transcription factor, modulates nitrate translocation from rice (Oryza sativa) roots to shoots under low-nitrate conditions. OsMADS57 is abundantly expressed in xylem parenchyma cells of root stele and is induced by nitrate. Compared with wild-type rice plants supplied with 0.2 mM nitrate, osmads57 mutants had 31% less xylem loading of nitrate, while overexpression lines had two-fold higher levels. Shoot-root 15N content ratios were 40% lower in the mutants and 76% higher in the overexpression lines. Rapid NO3- root influx experiments showed that mutation of OsMADS57 did not affect root nitrate uptake. RT-qPCR analysis of OsNRT2 nitrate transporter genes showed that after 5 min in 0.2 mM nitrate, only OsNRT2.3a (a vascular-specific high-affinity nitrate transporter) had reduced (by two-thirds) expression levels. At 60 min of nitrate treatment, lower expression levels were also observed for three additional NRT2 genes (OsNRT2.1/2.2/2.4). Conversely, in the overexpression lines, four NRT2 genes had much higher expression profiles at all time points tested. As previously reported, OsNRT2.3a functions in nitrate translocation, indicating the possible interaction between OsMADS57 and OsNRT2.3a. Yeast one-hybrid and transient expression assays demonstrated that OsMADS57 binds to the CArG motif [CATTTTATAG] within the OsNRT2.3a promoter. Moreover, seminal root elongation was inhibited in osmads57 mutants, which may be associated with higher auxin levels in and auxin polar transport to root tips of mutant plants. Taken together, these results suggest that OsMADS57 has a role in regulating nitrate translocation from root to shoot via OsNRT2.3a.
NA	Rice transcription factor OsMADS57 regulates plant height by modulating gibberellin catabolism.	2019	Rice (N Y)	Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Bioengineering College, Chongqing University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China.	The MADS-box transcription factors mainly function in floral organ organogenesis and identity specification. Few research on their roles in vegetative growth has been reported.Here we investigated the functions of OsMADS57 in plant vegetative growth in rice (Oryza sativa). Knockdown of OsMADS57 reduced the plant height, internode elongation and panicle exsertion in rice plants. Further study showed that the cell length was remarkably reduced in the uppermost internode in OsMADS57 knockdown plants at maturity. Moreover, OsMADS57 knockdown plants were more sensitive to gibberellic acid (GA3), and contained less bioactive GA3 than wild-type plants, which implied that OsMADS57 is involved in gibberellin (GA) pathway. Expectedly, the transcript levels of OsGA2ox3, encoding GAs deactivated enzyme, were significantly enhanced in OsMADS57 knockdown plants. The level of EUI1 transcripts involved in GA deactivation was also increased in OsMADS57 knockdown plants. More importantly, dual-luciferase reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that OsMADS57 directly regulates the transcription of OsGA2ox3 as well as EUI1 through binding to the CArG-box motifs in their promoter regions. In addition, OsMADS57 also modulated the expression of multiple genes involved in GA metabolism or GA signaling pathway, indicating the key and complex regulatory role of OsMADS57 in GA pathway in rice.These results indicated that OsMADS57 acts as an important transcriptional regulator that regulates stem elongation and panicle exsertion in rice via GA-mediated regulatory pathway.
NA	MiR529a controls plant height, tiller number, panicle architecture and grain size by regulating SPL target genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2021	Plant Sci	Institute of Crop Science, Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Crop Germplasm, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world. Breeding high-yield, multi-resistant and high-quality varieties has always been the goal of rice breeding. Rice tiller, panicle architecture and grain size are the constituent factors of yield, which are regulated by both genetic and environmental factors, including miRNAs, transcription factors, and downstream target genes. Previous studies have shown that SPL (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING-LIKE) transcription factors can control rice tiller, panicle architecture and grain size, which were regulated by miR156, miR529 and miR535. In this study, we obtained miR529a target mimicry (miR529a-MIMIC) transgenic plants to investigate plant phenotypes, physiological and molecular characteristics together with miR529a overexpression (miR529a-OE) and wild type (WT) to explore the function of miR529a and its SPL target genes in rice. We found that OsSPL2, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18 at seedling stage were regulated by miR529a, but there had complicated mechanism to control plant height. OsSPL2, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and SPL18 at tillering stage were regulated by miR529a to control plant height and tiller number. And panicle architecture and grain size were controlled by miR529a through altering the expression of all five target genes OsSPL2, OsSPL7, OsSPL14, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18. Our study suggested that miR529a might control rice growth and development by regulating different SPL target genes at different stages, which could provide a new method to improve rice yield by regulating miR529a and its SPL target genes.
