ncomms2542.pdf	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	2013	Nat Commun	The Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	Rice tillering is a multigenic trait that influences grain yield, but its regulation molecular module is poorly understood. Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice. An activation-tagged mutant osmads57-1 and OsMADS57-overexpression lines showed increased tillers, whereas OsMADS57 antisense lines had fewer tillers. OsMIR444a-overexpressing lines exhibited suppressed OsMADS57 expression and tillering. Furthermore, osmads57-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57's function in tillering was dependent on D14. D14 expression was downregulated in osmads57-1, but upregulated in antisense and OsMIR444a-overexpressing lines. OsMADS57 bound to the CArG motif [C(A/T)TTAAAAAG] in the promoter and directly suppressed D14 expression. Interaction of OsMADS57 with OsTB1 reduced OsMADS57 inhibition of D14 transcription. Therefore, OsMIR444a-regulated OsMADS57, together with OsTB1, target D14 to control tillering. This regulation mechanism could have important application in rice molecular breeding programs focused on high grain yield.
NA	OsMADS57 together with OsTB1 coordinates transcription of its target OsWRKY94 and D14 to switch its organogenesis to defense for cold adaptation in rice.	2018	New Phytol	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China.	Plants modify their development to adapt to their environment, protecting themselves from detrimental conditions such as chilling stress by triggering a variety of signaling pathways; however, little is known about how plants coordinate developmental patterns and stress responses at the molecular level. Here, we demonstrate that interacting transcription factors OsMADS57 and OsTB1 directly target the defense gene OsWRKY94 and the organogenesis gene D14 to trade off the functions controlling/moderating rice tolerance to cold. Overexpression of OsMADS57 maintains rice tiller growth under chilling stress. OsMADS57 binds directly to the promoter of OsWRKY94, activating its transcription for the cold stress response, while suppressing its activity under normal temperatures. In addition, OsWRKY94 was directly targeted and suppressed by OsTB1 under both normal and chilling temperatures. However, D14 transcription was directly promoted by OsMADS57 for suppressing tillering under the chilling treatment, whereas D14 was repressed for enhancing tillering under normal condition.We demonstrated that OsMADS57 and OsTB1 conversely affect rice chilling tolerance via targeting OsWRKY94. Our findings highlight a molecular genetic mechanism coordinating organogenesis and chilling tolerance in rice, which supports and extends recent work suggesting that chilling stress environments influence organ differentiation.
