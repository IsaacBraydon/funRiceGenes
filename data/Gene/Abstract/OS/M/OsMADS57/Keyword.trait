OsMADS57	tiller	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	An activation-tagged mutant osmads57-1 and OsMADS57-overexpression lines showed increased tillers, whereas OsMADS57 antisense lines had fewer tillers
OsMADS57	tiller	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	OsMIR444a-overexpressing lines exhibited suppressed OsMADS57 expression and tillering
OsMADS57	tiller	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	Furthermore, osmads57-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57's function in tillering was dependent on D14
OsMADS57	tiller	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	Therefore, OsMIR444a-regulated OsMADS57, together with OsTB1, target D14 to control tillering
OsMADS57	tiller	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14
OsMADS57	growth	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice
OsMADS57	growth	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	Furthermore, osmads57-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57's function in tillering was dependent on D14
OsMADS57	strigolactone	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	Furthermore, osmads57-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57's function in tillering was dependent on D14
OsMADS57	tillering	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	OsMIR444a-overexpressing lines exhibited suppressed OsMADS57 expression and tillering
OsMADS57	tillering	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	Furthermore, osmads57-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57's function in tillering was dependent on D14
OsMADS57	tillering	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	Therefore, OsMIR444a-regulated OsMADS57, together with OsTB1, target D14 to control tillering
OsMADS57	tillering	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14
OsMADS57	dwarf	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice
OsMADS57	dwarf	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14
