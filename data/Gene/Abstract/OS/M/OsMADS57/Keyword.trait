OsMADS57	tiller	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	 An activation-tagged mutant osmads57-1 and OsMADS57-overexpression lines showed increased tillers, whereas OsMADS57 antisense lines had fewer tillers| OsMIR444a-overexpressing lines exhibited suppressed OsMADS57 expression and tillering| Furthermore, osmads57-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57's function in tillering was dependent on D14| Therefore, OsMIR444a-regulated OsMADS57, together with OsTB1, target D14 to control tillering|The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14
OsMADS57	growth	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	 Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice| Furthermore, osmads57-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57's function in tillering was dependent on D14
OsMADS57	strigolactone	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	 Furthermore, osmads57-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57's function in tillering was dependent on D14
