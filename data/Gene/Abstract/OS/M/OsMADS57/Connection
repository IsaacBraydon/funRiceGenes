OsMADS57	OsRDR1	A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.	We further show that three miR444 targets, the MIKCC-type MADS-box proteins OsMADS23, OsMADS27a and OsMADS57, form homodimers and heterodimers between them to repress the expression of OsRDR1 by directly binding to the CArG motifs of its promoter
OsMADS57	OsRDR1	A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.	Consequently, increased level of miR444 diminishes the repressive roles of OsMADS23, OsMADS27a and OsMADS57 on OsRDR1 transcription thus to activate OsRDR1-dependent antiviral RNA silencing pathway
OsMADS57	OsRDR1	A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.	We also show that overexpression of miR444-resistant OsMADS57 reduced OsRDR1 expression and rice resistance against RSV infection and knockout of OsRDR1 reduced rice resistance against RSV infection
HTD2|D88|D14	OsMADS57	OsMADS57 together with OsTB1 coordinates transcription of its target OsWRKY94 and D14 to switch its organogenesis to defense for cold adaptation in rice.
