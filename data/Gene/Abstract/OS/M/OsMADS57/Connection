HTD2|D88|D14	OsMADS57	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	 Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice
HTD2|D88|D14	OsMADS57	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	 Furthermore, osmads57-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57's function in tillering was dependent on D14
HTD2|D88|D14	OsMADS57	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	 D14 expression was downregulated in osmads57-1, but upregulated in antisense and OsMIR444a-overexpressing lines
HTD2|D88|D14	OsMADS57	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	 OsMADS57 bound to the CArG motif [C(A/T)TTAAAAAG] in the promoter and directly suppressed D14 expression
HTD2|D88|D14	OsMADS57	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	 Interaction of OsMADS57 with OsTB1 reduced OsMADS57 inhibition of D14 transcription
HTD2|D88|D14	OsMADS57	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	 Therefore, OsMIR444a-regulated OsMADS57, together with OsTB1, target D14 to control tillering
OsMADS57	OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	 Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice
OsMADS57	OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	 Interaction of OsMADS57 with OsTB1 reduced OsMADS57 inhibition of D14 transcription
OsMADS57	OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	 Therefore, OsMIR444a-regulated OsMADS57, together with OsTB1, target D14 to control tillering
OsMADS57	OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14
OsMADS57	OsRDR1	A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.	 We further show that three miR444 targets, the MIKCC-type MADS-box proteins OsMADS23, OsMADS27a and OsMADS57, form homodimers and heterodimers between them to repress the expression of OsRDR1 by directly binding to the CArG motifs of its promoter
OsMADS57	OsRDR1	A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.	 Consequently, increased level of miR444 diminishes the repressive roles of OsMADS23, OsMADS27a and OsMADS57 on OsRDR1 transcription thus to activate OsRDR1-dependent antiviral RNA silencing pathway
OsMADS57	OsRDR1	A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.	 We also show that overexpression of miR444-resistant OsMADS57 reduced OsRDR1 expression and rice resistance against RSV infection and knockout of OsRDR1 reduced rice resistance against RSV infection
