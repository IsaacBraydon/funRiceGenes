OsMADS57	 Overexpression of OsMADS57 maintains rice tiller growth under chilling stress	 Overexpression of OsMADS57 maintains rice tiller growth under chilling stress
OsMADS57	2 mM nitrate, osmads57 mutants had 31% less xylem loading of nitrate, while overexpression lines had two-fold higher levels |  Yeast one-hybrid and transient expression assays demonstrated that OsMADS57 binds to the CArG motif [CATTTTATAG] within the OsNRT2	2 mM nitrate, osmads57 mutants had 31% less xylem loading of nitrate, while overexpression lines had two-fold higher levels
OsMADS57	 Gene expression pattern analysis revealed that OsMADS57 was induced by NaCl |  Overexpression of OsMADS57 in both Arabidopsis thaliana (A |  Further experiments exhibited that overexpression of OsMADS57 in rice significantly increased the tolerance ability of plants to oxidative damage under salt stress, mainly by increasing the activities of antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD), reducing malonaldehyde (MDA) content and improving the expression of stress-related genes	 Overexpression of OsMADS57 in both Arabidopsis thaliana (A |  Further experiments exhibited that overexpression of OsMADS57 in rice significantly increased the tolerance ability of plants to oxidative damage under salt stress, mainly by increasing the activities of antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD), reducing malonaldehyde (MDA) content and improving the expression of stress-related genes
