OsMADS57	2 mM nitrate, osmads57 mutants had 31% less xylem loading of nitrate, while overexpression lines had two-fold higher levels |  Yeast one-hybrid and transient expression assays demonstrated that OsMADS57 binds to the CArG motif [CATTTTATAG] within the OsNRT2	2 mM nitrate, osmads57 mutants had 31% less xylem loading of nitrate, while overexpression lines had two-fold higher levels
