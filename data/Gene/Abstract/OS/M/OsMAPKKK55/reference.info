NA	Regulatory Role of OsTDL1A-MSP1 Signaling in Specifying Anther Cell Identity in Rice.	2016	Plant Physiol	Shanghai Jiao Tong University CITY: Shanghai China [CN].	In flowering plants, sequential formation of anther cell types is a highly ordered process that is essential for successful meiosis and sexual reproduction. Differentiation of meristematic cells and cell-cell communication are proposed to coordinate anther development. Among the proposed mechanisms of cell fate specification are cell surface-localized leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) and their putative ligands. Here we present the genetic and biochemical evidence that a rice LRR-RLK, MSP1, interacts with its ligand OsTDL1A, specifying the cell identity of anther wall layers and microsporocytes. An in vitro assay indicates that the 21 amino-acid peptide of OsTDL1A has a physical interaction with the LRR domain of MSP1. ostdl1a msp1 double mutant showed the defect in lacking middle layers and tapetal cells, and having an increased number of microsporocytes similar to ostdl1a or msp1 single mutant, indicating the same pathway of OsTDL1A-MSP1 in regulating anther development. Genome-wide expression profiles showed the altered expression of genes encoding transcription factors, particularly basic helix-loop-helix and basic leucine zipper domain transcription factors in ostdl1a and msp1. Among these reduced expressed genes, one putatively encodes a TGA (TGACGTCA cis-element-binding protein) factor OsTGA10, and another one encodes a plant-specific CC-type glutaredoxin OsGrx_I1. OsTGA10 was shown to interact with OsGrx_I1, suggesting that OsTDL1A-MSP1 signaling specifies anther cell fate directly or indirectly affecting redox status. Collectively, these data point to a central role of the OsTDL1A-MSP1 signaling pathway in specifying somatic cell identity and suppressing over-proliferation of archesporial cells in rice.
NA	OsMKKK70 Negatively Regulates Cold Tolerance at Booting Stage in Rice.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	Key Laboratory of Soybean Molecular Design Breeding, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Harbin 150081, China.	Cold stress at the booting stage leads to a lower seed setting rate and seriously threatens the production of rice (Oryza sativa L.), which has become a major yield-limiting factor in higher-altitude and -latitude regions. Because cold tolerance at the booting stage (CTB) is a complex trait and is controlled by multiple loci, only a few genes have been reported so far. In this study, a function of OsMKKK70 (Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase 70) in response to CTB was characterized. OsMKKK70 expression was rapidly induced by cold stress at the booting stage. OsMKKK70 overexpression (OsMKKK70-OE) plants were more sensitive to cold stress at the booting stage with a lower seed setting and pollen fertility, but there was no significant difference between the osmkkk70 mutant and WT. Considering the effect of functional redundancy, we further tested the CTB response of osmkkk62/70 and osmkkk55/62/70, the double and triple mutants of OsMKKK70 with its closest homologs OsMKKK62 and OsMKKK55, and found that osmkkk62/70 and osmkkk55/62/70 displayed significantly increased CTB with a higher seed setting and pollen fertility, indicating that OsMKKK70 negatively regulates rice CTB. Moreover, under the low-temperature (LT) condition, the osmkkk62/70 mutant had slightly higher Gibberellin (GA) contents, increased expression of GA biosynthesis genes, and lower protein level of OsSLR1 in anthers than those in WT. By contrast, OsMKKK70-OE anther had a lower GA biosynthesis than that of WT. Together, these findings suggest that OsMKKK70 negatively regulates rice CTB by fine-tuning GA levels in anthers.
