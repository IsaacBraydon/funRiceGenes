OsMY1	panicle	Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L	 One of its putative partners, OsMY1, was isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening from rice panicle cDNA library| Real-time PCR shows that OsMY1 and OsRac5 are coordinately expressed in rice leaves and panicles with similar expression patterns
OsMY1	growth	Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L	 Our results suggest that OsMY1 is an important target of OsRac5 and that these two genes are involved in the same biological processes in rice growth and development
