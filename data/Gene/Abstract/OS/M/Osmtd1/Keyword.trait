Osmtd1	architecture	A T-DNA insertion mutant Osmtd1 aas altered in architecture by upregulating MicroRNA156f in rice.	A T-DNA insertion mutant Osmtd1 aas altered in architecture by upregulating MicroRNA156f in rice.
Osmtd1	dwarf	A T-DNA insertion mutant Osmtd1 aas altered in architecture by upregulating MicroRNA156f in rice.	Here, we identified a T-DNA insertion mutant Osmtd1 (Oryza sativa multi-tillering and dwarf mutant)
Osmtd1	leaf	The Copy Number Variation of OsMTD1 Regulates Rice Plant Architecture	 Moreover, we revealed that OsMTD1 not only influences rice tiller number and leaf angle, but also represses pri-miR156f transcription in the CNV region
Osmtd1	tiller	The Copy Number Variation of OsMTD1 Regulates Rice Plant Architecture	 Moreover, we revealed that OsMTD1 not only influences rice tiller number and leaf angle, but also represses pri-miR156f transcription in the CNV region
