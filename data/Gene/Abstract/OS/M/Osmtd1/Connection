Osmtd1	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	A T-DNA insertion mutant Osmtd1 aas altered in architecture by upregulating MicroRNA156f in rice.	 We showed that the expression of OsSPL3, OsSPL12 and OsSPL14 was significantly down-regulated in Osmtd1 or OsmiR156f overexpressed lines, indicating that OsSPL3, OsSPL12 and OsSPL14 were possibly direct target genes of OsmiR156f
