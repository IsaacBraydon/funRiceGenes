NA	A T-DNA insertion mutant Osmtd1 aas altered in architecture by upregulating MicroRNA156f in rice.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Phytohormones and Growth Development, Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Crop Germplasm Innovation and Utilization, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China.	The plant architecture is an important factor for crop production. Some members of microRNA156 (miR156) and their target genes SQUAMOSA Promoter-Binding Protein-Like (SPL) were identified to play essential roles in the establishment of plant architecture. However, the roles and regulation of miR156 is not well understood yet. Here, we identified a T-DNA insertion mutant Osmtd1 (Oryza sativa multi-tillering and dwarf mutant). Osmtd1 produced more tillers and displayed short stature phenotype. We determined that the dramatic morphological changes were caused by a single T-DNA insertion in Osmtd1. Further analysis revealed that the T-DNA insertion was located in the gene Os08g34258 encoding a putative inhibitor I family protein. Os08g34258 was knocked out and OsmiR156f was significantly upregulated in Osmtd1. Overexpression of Os08g34258 in Osmtd1 complemented the defects of the mutant architecture, while overexpression of OsmiR156f in wild-type rice phenocopied Osmtd1. We showed that the expression of OsSPL3, OsSPL12 and OsSPL14 was significantly down-regulated in Osmtd1 or OsmiR156f overexpressed lines, indicating that OsSPL3, OsSPL12 and OsSPL14 were possibly direct target genes of OsmiR156f. Our results suggested that OsmiR156f controlled plant architecture by mediating plant stature and tiller outgrowth and might be regulated by an unknown protease inhibitor I family protein.
NA	The Copy Number Variation of OsMTD1 Regulates Rice Plant Architecture	2021	Front Plant Sci	Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Phytohormones and Growth Development, College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, China.	Copy number variation (CNV) may have phenotypic effects by altering the expression level of the gene(s) or regulatory element(s) contained. It is believed that CNVs play pivotal roles in controlling plant architecture and other traits in plant. However, the effects of CNV contributing to special traits remain largely unknown. Here we report a CNV involved in rice architecture by modulating tiller number and leaf angle. In the genome of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare, we found a locus Loc_Os08g34249 is derived from a 13,002-bp tandem duplication in the nearby region of OsMTD1, a gene regulating tillering in rice. Further survey of 230 rice cultivars showed that the duplication occurred in only 13 japonica rice cultivars. Phenotypic investigation indicated that this CNV region may contribute to tiller number. Moreover, we revealed that OsMTD1 not only influences rice tiller number and leaf angle, but also represses pri-miR156f transcription in the CNV region. Intriguingly, this CNV performs function through both the dosage and position effects on OsMTD1 and pri-miR156f. Thus, our work identified a CNV and revealed a molecular regulatory basis for its effects on plant architecture, implying this CNV may possess importance and application potential in molecular breeding in rice.
