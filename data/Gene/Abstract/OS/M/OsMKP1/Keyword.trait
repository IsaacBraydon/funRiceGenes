OsMKP1|GSN1|LARGE8|GLA1	dwarf	A calmodulin-binding mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase is induced by wounding and regulates the activities of stress-related mitogen-activated protein kinases in rice	Unlike the Arabidopsis atmkp1 loss-of-function mutant, which shows no abnormal phenotype without stimuli, osmkp1 showed a semi-dwarf phenotype
OsMKP1|GSN1|LARGE8|GLA1	dwarf	A calmodulin-binding mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase is induced by wounding and regulates the activities of stress-related mitogen-activated protein kinases in rice	Exogenous supply of neither gibberellin nor brassinosteroid complemented the semi-dwarf phenotype of osmkp1

OsMKP1|GSN1|LARGE8|GLA1	panicle	GRAIN SIZE AND NUMBER1 Negatively Regulates the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 Cascade to Coordinate the Trade-off between Grain Number per Panicle and Grain Size in Rice.	 We confirmed that GSN1 is a negative regulator of the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 cascade that determines panicle architecture
OsMKP1|GSN1|LARGE8|GLA1	grain	GRAIN SIZE AND NUMBER1 Negatively Regulates the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 Cascade to Coordinate the Trade-off between Grain Number per Panicle and Grain Size in Rice.	 Reduced expression of GSN1 resulted in larger and fewer grains, whereas increased expression resulted in more grains but reduced grain size

OsMKP1|GSN1|LARGE8|GLA1	Kinase	GRAIN SIZE AND NUMBER1 Negatively Regulates the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 Cascade to Coordinate the Trade-off between Grain Number per Panicle and Grain Size in Rice.	 GSN1 encodes the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase OsMKP1, a dual-specificity phosphatase of unknown function
OsMKP1|GSN1|LARGE8|GLA1	Kinase	GRAIN SIZE AND NUMBER1 Negatively Regulates the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 Cascade to Coordinate the Trade-off between Grain Number per Panicle and Grain Size in Rice.	 GSN1 directly interacts with and inactivates the mitogen-activated protein kinase OsMPK6 via dephosphorylation
OsMKP1|GSN1|LARGE8|GLA1	Kinase	GRAIN SIZE AND NUMBER1 Negatively Regulates the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 Cascade to Coordinate the Trade-off between Grain Number per Panicle and Grain Size in Rice.	 Consistent with this finding, the suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase genes OsMPK6, OsMKK4, and OsMKKK10 separately resulted in denser panicles and smaller grains, which rescued the mutant gsn1 phenotypes
