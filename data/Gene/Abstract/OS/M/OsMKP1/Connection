OsMKP1|GSN1|LARGE8|GLA1	OsMPK6|OsMPK4	A calmodulin-binding mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase is induced by wounding and regulates the activities of stress-related mitogen-activated protein kinases in rice	Activities of two stress-responsive MAPKs, OsMPK3 and OsMPK6, in osmkp1 were higher than those in the wild type both before and after wounding
OsMKK4|LARGE11	OsMKP1|GSN1|LARGE8|GLA1	GRAIN SIZE AND NUMBER1 Negatively Regulates the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 Cascade to Coordinate the Trade-off between Grain Number per Panicle and Grain Size in Rice.	 Consistent with this finding, the suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase genes OsMPK6, OsMKK4, and OsMKKK10 separately resulted in denser panicles and smaller grains, which rescued the mutant gsn1 phenotypes
OsMKP1|GSN1|LARGE8|GLA1	OsMPK6|OsMPK4	GRAIN SIZE AND NUMBER1 Negatively Regulates the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 Cascade to Coordinate the Trade-off between Grain Number per Panicle and Grain Size in Rice.	 GSN1 directly interacts with and inactivates the mitogen-activated protein kinase OsMPK6 via dephosphorylation
