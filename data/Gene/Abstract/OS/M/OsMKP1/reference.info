Plant Cell Physiol-2007-Katou-332-44.pdf	A calmodulin-binding mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase is induced by wounding and regulates the activities of stress-related mitogen-activated protein kinases in rice	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs) are negative regulators of MAPKs. In dicotyledons such as Arabidopsis and tobacco, MKPs have been shown to play pivotal roles in abiotic stress responses, hormone responses and microtubule organization. However, little is known about the role of MKPs in monocotyledons such as rice. Database searches identified five putative MKPs in rice. We investigated their expression in response to wounding, and found that the expression of OsMKP1 is rapidly induced by wounding. In this study, we functionally characterized the involvement of OsMKP1 in wound responses. The deduced amino acid sequence of OsMKP1 shows strong similarity to Arabidopsis AtMKP1 and tobacco NtMKP1. Moreover, OsMKP1 bound calmodulin in a manner similar to NtMKP1. To determine the biological function of OsMKP1, we obtained osmkp1, a loss-of-function mutant, in which retrotransposon Tos17 was inserted in the second exon of OsMKP1. Unlike the Arabidopsis atmkp1 loss-of-function mutant, which shows no abnormal phenotype without stimuli, osmkp1 showed a semi-dwarf phenotype. Exogenous supply of neither gibberellin nor brassinosteroid complemented the semi-dwarf phenotype of osmkp1. Activities of two stress-responsive MAPKs, OsMPK3 and OsMPK6, in osmkp1 were higher than those in the wild type both before and after wounding. Microarray analysis identified 13 up-regulated and eight down-regulated genes in osmkp1. Among the up-regulated genes, the expression of five genes showed clear responses to wounding, indicating that wound responses are constitutively activated in osmkp1. These results suggest that OsMKP1 is involved in the negative regulation of rice wound responses.
NA	GRAIN SIZE AND NUMBER1 Negatively Regulates the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 Cascade to Coordinate the Trade-off between Grain Number per Panicle and Grain Size in Rice.	2018	Plant Cell	Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, SIBS, CAS CITY: Shanghai China [CN].	Grain number and size are interactive agronomic traits that determine grain yield. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for coordinating the trade-off between these traits remain elusive. Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) grain size and number 1 (gsn1) mutant, which has larger grains but sparser panicles than the wild type due to disordered localized cell differentiation and proliferation. GSN1 encodes the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase OsMKP1, a dual-specificity phosphatase of unknown function. Reduced expression of GSN1 resulted in larger and fewer grains, whereas increased expression resulted in more grains but reduced grain size. GSN1 directly interacts with and inactivates the mitogen-activated protein kinase OsMPK6 via dephosphorylation. Consistent with this finding, the suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase genes OsMPK6, OsMKK4, and OsMKKK10 separately resulted in denser panicles and smaller grains, which rescued the mutant gsn1 phenotypes. Therefore, OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 participates in panicle morphogenesis and acts on a common pathway in rice. We confirmed that GSN1 is a negative regulator of the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 cascade that determines panicle architecture. The GSN1-MAPK module coordinates the trade-off between grain number and grain size by integrating localized cell differentiation and proliferation. These findings provide important insights into the developmental plasticity of the panicle and a potential means to improve crop yields.
NA	A Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatase influences grain size and weight in rice.	2018	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Cell and Chromosome Engineering, CAS Centre for Excellence in Molecular Plant Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Grain size and weight are directly associated with grain yield in crops. However, the molecular mechanisms that set final grain size and weight remain largely unknown. Here, we characterize two large grain mutants, large grain8-1 (large8-1) and large grain8-2 (large8-2). LARGE8 encodes the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase1 (OsMKP1). Loss of function mutations in OsMKP1 results in large grains, while overexpression of OsMKP1 leads to small grains. OsMKP1 determines grain size by restricting cell proliferation in grain hulls. OsMKP1 directly interacts with and deactivates the mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (OsMAPK6). Taken together, we identify OsMKP1 as a crucial factor that influences grain size by deactivating OsMAPK6, indicating that the reversible phosphorylation of OsMAPK6 plays important roles in determining grain size in rice.

NA	GRAIN LENGTH AND AWN 1 negatively regulates grain size in rice.	2018	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.	Grain size is an important factor determining yield in rice. Here, we identified a recessive mutant gene, grain length and awn 1 (gla1), which caused a significant increase in grain length and weight, and was associated with long awns. The gla1 mutation was mapped to a single-nucleotide polymorphism in a gene encoding a cytoplasmically-localized mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase. Overexpression of GLA1 caused a decrease in grain length, and the GLA1 protein interacted with OsMAPK6. These results suggest that GLA1 may serve as a negative regulator of the OsMAPKK4-OsMAPK6 cascade, controlling grain size via the dephosphorylation of OsMAPK6.
