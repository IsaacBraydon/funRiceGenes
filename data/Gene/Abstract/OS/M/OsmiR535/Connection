DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	OsmiR535	The multiple roles of OsmiR535 in modulating plant height, panicle branching and grain shape.	 Through quantitative real-time PCR analyses, we further revealed that OsmiR535 overexpression repressed the expression of OsSPL7/12/16, as well as the OsSPLs downstream panicle related genes, including OsPIN1B, OsDEP1, OsLOG and OsSLR1
