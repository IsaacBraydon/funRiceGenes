NA	The multiple roles of OsmiR535 in modulating plant height, panicle branching and grain shape.	2019	Plant Sci	Crop Stress Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University, Daqing, 163319, China; Plant Bioengineering Laboratory, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin, 150030, China.	The miR156/miR529-SPL module acts a vital role in regulating plant growth and development. Though miR535 shows very high sequence identity to miR156 and miR529, it is still unknown whether miR535 could control plant growth and development. In this study, we performed the evolutionary analyses of miR535s in land plants and found that miR535s were less conserved than miR156s during evolution. In rice, miR535 expressed at a very low level during the vegetative growth but highly accumulated in young panicles, which is similar with OsmiR529, but opposite to OsmiR156. Expectedly, OsmiR535 overexpression in rice reduced plant height by decreasing the 1st and 2nd internode length. Furthermore, OsmiR535 overexpression imposed great influence in panicle architecture, such as more but shorter panicles, and fewer primary/secondary panicle branches. Moreover, OsmiR535 overexpression increased the grain length, but did not affect grain width. Through quantitative real-time PCR analyses, we further revealed that OsmiR535 overexpression repressed the expression of OsSPL7/12/16, as well as the OsSPLs downstream panicle related genes, including OsPIN1B, OsDEP1, OsLOG and OsSLR1. Taken together, our findings suggest that OsmiR535 multiply modulates plant height, panicle architecture and grain shape possibly by regulating OsSPLs genes in rice.
NA	OsmiR535, a Potential Genetic Editing Target for Drought and Salinity Stress Tolerance in Oryza sativa	2020	Plants (Basel)	Institute of Crop Science, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	OsmiR535 belongs to the miR156/miR529/miR535 superfamily, a highly conserved miRNA family in plants. OsmiR535 is involved in regulating the cold-stress response, modulating plant development, and determining panicle architecture and grain length. However, the role that OsmiR535 plays in plant responses to drought and salinity are elusive. In the current study, molecular and genetic engineering techniques were used to elucidate the possible role of OsmiR535 in response to NaCl, PEG(Poly ethylene glycol), ABA(Abscisic acid), and dehydration stresses. Our results showed that OsmiR535 is induced under stressed conditions as compared to control. With transgenic and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout system techniques, our results verified that either inhibition or knockout of OsmiR535 in rice could enhance the tolerance of plants to NaCl, ABA, dehydration and PEG stresses. In addition, the overexpression of OsmiR535 significantly reduced the survival rate of rice seedlings during PEG and dehydration post-stress recovery. Our results demonstrated that OsmiR535 negatively regulates the stress response in rice. Moreover, our practical application of CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing created a homozygous 5 bp deletion in the coding sequence of OsmiR535, demonstrating that OsmiR535 could be a useful genetic editing target for drought and salinity tolerance and a new marker for molecular breeding of Oryza sativa.
