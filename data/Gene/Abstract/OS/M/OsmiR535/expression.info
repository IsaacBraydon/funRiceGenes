OsmiR535	 Expectedly, OsmiR535 overexpression in rice reduced plant height by decreasing the 1st and 2nd internode length |  Furthermore, OsmiR535 overexpression imposed great influence in panicle architecture, such as more but shorter panicles, and fewer primary/secondary panicle branches |  Moreover, OsmiR535 overexpression increased the grain length, but did not affect grain width |  Through quantitative real-time PCR analyses, we further revealed that OsmiR535 overexpression repressed the expression of OsSPL7/12/16, as well as the OsSPLs downstream panicle related genes, including OsPIN1B, OsDEP1, OsLOG and OsSLR1	 Expectedly, OsmiR535 overexpression in rice reduced plant height by decreasing the 1st and 2nd internode length |  Furthermore, OsmiR535 overexpression imposed great influence in panicle architecture, such as more but shorter panicles, and fewer primary/secondary panicle branches |  Moreover, OsmiR535 overexpression increased the grain length, but did not affect grain width |  Through quantitative real-time PCR analyses, we further revealed that OsmiR535 overexpression repressed the expression of OsSPL7/12/16, as well as the OsSPLs downstream panicle related genes, including OsPIN1B, OsDEP1, OsLOG and OsSLR1
