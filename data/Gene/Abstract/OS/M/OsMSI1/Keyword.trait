OsMSI1	development	RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED genes specifically control inner floral organ morphogenesis and pollen development in rice.	 OsMSI1 was ubiquitously expressed and appears to be essential for development in rice, as the mutation of OsMSI1 was lethal
OsMSI1	development	RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED genes specifically control inner floral organ morphogenesis and pollen development in rice.	 These results suggest that OsRBR1 and OsRBR2 function with OsMSI1 in reproductive development in rice
OsMSI1	floral	RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED genes specifically control inner floral organ morphogenesis and pollen development in rice.	 Similar to the protein interaction between AtRBR and AtMSI1 that is essential for floral de-velopment in Arabidopsis, OsMSI1 was identified as an interaction partner of OsRBR1 and OsRBR2
OsMSI1	reproductive	RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED genes specifically control inner floral organ morphogenesis and pollen development in rice.	 These results suggest that OsRBR1 and OsRBR2 function with OsMSI1 in reproductive development in rice
OsMSI1	reproductive development	RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED genes specifically control inner floral organ morphogenesis and pollen development in rice.	 These results suggest that OsRBR1 and OsRBR2 function with OsMSI1 in reproductive development in rice
