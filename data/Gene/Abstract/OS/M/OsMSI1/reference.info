RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) is an essential gene in plants, but its molecular func-tion outside of its role in cell cycle entry remains poorly understood. We characterized the functions of OsRBR1 and OsRBR2 in plant growth and development in rice using both for-ward and reverse genetics methods. The two genes were co-expressed and performed redun-dant roles in vegetative organs, but exhibited separate functions in flowers. OsRBR1 was highly expressed in the floral meristem (FM) and regulated the expression of floral homeo-tic genes to ensure floral organ formation. Mutation of OsRBR1 caused loss of FM identity, resulting in the replacement of lodicules, stamens, and the pistil with either a panicle-like structure or whorls of lemma-like organs. OsRBR2 was preferentially expressed in stamens and promoted pollen formation. Mutation of OsRBR2 led to deformed anthers without pollen. Similar to the protein interaction between AtRBR and AtMSI1 that is essential for floral de-velopment in Arabidopsis, OsMSI1 was identified as an interaction partner of OsRBR1 and OsRBR2. OsMSI1 was ubiquitously expressed and appears to be essential for development in rice, as the mutation of OsMSI1 was lethal. These results suggest that OsRBR1 and OsRBR2 function with OsMSI1 in reproductive development in rice. This work characteriz-es further functions of RBRs and improves current understanding of specific regulatory pathways of floral specification and pollen formation in rice.
