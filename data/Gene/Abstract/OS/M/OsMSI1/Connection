OsMSI1	OsRBR1	RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED genes specifically control inner floral organ morphogenesis and pollen development in rice.	 Similar to the protein interaction between AtRBR and AtMSI1 that is essential for floral de-velopment in Arabidopsis, OsMSI1 was identified as an interaction partner of OsRBR1 and OsRBR2
OsMSI1	OsRBR1	RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED genes specifically control inner floral organ morphogenesis and pollen development in rice.	 These results suggest that OsRBR1 and OsRBR2 function with OsMSI1 in reproductive development in rice
OsMSI1	PANDA	The Harbinger transposon-derived gene PANDA epigenetically coordinates panicle number and grain size in rice	The PANDA-encoding protein can bind to the core polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components OsMSI1 and OsFIE2, and regulates the deposition of H3K27me3 in the target genes, thereby epigenetically repressing their expression.
