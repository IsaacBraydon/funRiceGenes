OsMSI1	OsRBR1	RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED genes specifically control inner floral organ morphogenesis and pollen development in rice.	 Similar to the protein interaction between AtRBR and AtMSI1 that is essential for floral de-velopment in Arabidopsis, OsMSI1 was identified as an interaction partner of OsRBR1 and OsRBR2
OsMSI1	OsRBR1	RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED genes specifically control inner floral organ morphogenesis and pollen development in rice.	 These results suggest that OsRBR1 and OsRBR2 function with OsMSI1 in reproductive development in rice
