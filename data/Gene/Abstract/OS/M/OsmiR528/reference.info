NA	Transcriptional regulation of miR528 by OsSPL9 orchestrates antiviral response in rice.	2019	Mol Plant	The State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China.	Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are critical regulators of plant antiviral defense. However, little is known as to how these miRNAs respond to virus invasion at the transcriptional level. We established previously that defense to Rice stripe virus (RSV) invasion entailed a reduction of miR528 accumulation in rice, thus alleviating miR528-mediated degradation of L-Ascorbate Oxidase (AO) mRNA, bolstering the antiviral activity of AO. Here we show that this miR528-AO defense module is also regulated by the transcription factor SPL9. SPL9 displayed high affinity binding to specific motifs within the promoter region of miR528 and activated the transcription of miR528 promoter in vivo assay. Loss-of-function mutations in SPL9 correlated with a significant reduction of miR528 but a substantial increase of AO mRNA, enhancing rice resistance to RSV. Conversely, transgenic overexpression of SPL9 stimulated the expression of miR528, hence lowering the level of AO mRNA and compromising rice defense to RSV. Importantly, gain in RSV susceptibility did not occur when SPL9 overexpression was attempted in mir528 loss-of-function mutants, or in transgenic rice expressing a miR528-resistant AO. In conclusion, SPL9-mediated transcriptional activation of miR528 expression adds a novel layer of regulation of the miR528-AO antiviral defense.
NA	OsmiR528 Enhances Cold Stress Tolerance by Repressing Expression of Stress Response-related Transcription Factor Genes in Plant Cells.	2019	Curr Genomics	1College of Horticulture and Gardening, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei Province 434025, P.R. China; 2Program of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC27708, USA.	MicroRNAs participate in many molecular mechanisms and signaling trans-duction pathways that are associated with plant stress tolerance by repressing expression of their target genes. However, how microRNAs enhance tolerance to low temperature stress in plant cells remains elusive.In this investigation, we demonstrated that overexpression of the rice microRNA528 (Os-miR528) increases cell viability, growth rate, antioxidants content, ascorbate peroxidase (APOX) activi-ty, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and decreases ion leakage rate and thiobarbituric acid reac-tive substances (TBARS) under low temperature stress in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), pine (Pi-nus elliottii), and rice (Oryza sativa).To investigate the potential mechanism of OsmiR528 in increasing cold stress tolerance, we examined expression of stress-associated MYB transcription factors OsGAMYB-like1, OsMYBS3, OsMYB4, OsMYB3R-2, OsMYB5, OsMYB59, OsMYB30, OsMYB1R, and OsMYB20 in rice cells by qRT-PCR.Our experiments demonstrated that OsmiR528 decreases expression of transcription factor OsMYB30 by targeting a F-box domain containing protein gene (Os06g06050), which is a positive regulator of OsMYB30. In OsmiR528 transgenic rice, reduced OsMYB30 expression results in in-creased expression of BMY genes OsBMY2, OsBMY6, and OsBMY10. The transcript levels of the OsBMY2, OsBMY6, and OsBMY10 were elevated by OsMYB30 knockdown, but decreased by Os-MYB30 overexpression in OsmiR528 transgenic cell lines, suggesting that OsmiR528 increases low temperature tolerance by modulating expression of stress response-related transcription factor.Our experiments provide novel information in increasing our understanding in molecular mechanisms of microRNAs-associated low temperature tolerance and are valuable in plant molecular breeding from monocotyledonous, dicotyledonous, and gymnosperm plants.
