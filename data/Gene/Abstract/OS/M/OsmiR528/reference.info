NA	Transcriptional regulation of miR528 by OsSPL9 orchestrates antiviral response in rice.	2019	Mol Plant	The State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China.	Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are critical regulators of plant antiviral defense. However, little is known as to how these miRNAs respond to virus invasion at the transcriptional level. We established previously that defense to Rice stripe virus (RSV) invasion entailed a reduction of miR528 accumulation in rice, thus alleviating miR528-mediated degradation of L-Ascorbate Oxidase (AO) mRNA, bolstering the antiviral activity of AO. Here we show that this miR528-AO defense module is also regulated by the transcription factor SPL9. SPL9 displayed high affinity binding to specific motifs within the promoter region of miR528 and activated the transcription of miR528 promoter in vivo assay. Loss-of-function mutations in SPL9 correlated with a significant reduction of miR528 but a substantial increase of AO mRNA, enhancing rice resistance to RSV. Conversely, transgenic overexpression of SPL9 stimulated the expression of miR528, hence lowering the level of AO mRNA and compromising rice defense to RSV. Importantly, gain in RSV susceptibility did not occur when SPL9 overexpression was attempted in mir528 loss-of-function mutants, or in transgenic rice expressing a miR528-resistant AO. In conclusion, SPL9-mediated transcriptional activation of miR528 expression adds a novel layer of regulation of the miR528-AO antiviral defense.
