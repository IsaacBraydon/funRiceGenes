OsMKK10-2|MPKK10.2|OsMKK10.2	ion homeostasis	Genome-wide association studies identify OsWRKY53 as a key regulator of salt tolerance in rice	We further find that OsWRKY53 acts as a negative modulator regulating expression of OsMKK10.2 in promoting ion homeostasis.
OsMKK10-2|MPKK10.2|OsMKK10.2	ionic stress	Genome-wide association studies identify OsWRKY53 as a key regulator of salt tolerance in rice	We show that the OsWRKY53-OsMKK10.2 and OsWRKY53-OsHKT1;5 module coordinate defenses against ionic stress.
