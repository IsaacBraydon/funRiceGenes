While the Arabidopsis genome carries one copy of the methyltransferase 1 (MET1) gene for DNA methyltransferase, which is mainly responsible for maintaining CpG methylation, the rice genome bears two copies of the MET1 genes, OsMET1a and OsMET1b. The transcripts of OsMET1b accumulate more abundantly than those of OsMET1a in all of the tissues examined, and both genes actively transcribed at the callus, imbibed embryo, root, meristem, young panicle, anther, pistil, and endosperm, all of which contain actively dividing cells. The OsMET1a transcripts contain two 5'-untranslated exons and alternatively spliced 3'-terminal exons. The alternatively spliced transcripts consist of 14, 15, or 16 exons, and all of them encode a putative protein of 1527 amino acids. While the 3'-terminal exon of OsMET1b is unique, alternative splicing occurs in the 5'-terminal regions, which comprise either exons containing 5'-untranslated regions or an exon bearing the initiation codon. Depending upon alternative usage of 5' exons by alternative splicing, the OsMET1b transcripts comprise 11, 12, 13, or 14 exons, and the former two and the latter two longer transcripts encode putative proteins of 1486 and 1529 amino acids, respectively. Moreover, the 5' splicing patterns of OsMET1b can vary in different tissues. These findings are discussed with respect to the possible regulation of the OsMET1 genes.

Epigenetic modification is essential for normal development and plays important roles in gene regulation in higher plants. Multiple factors interact to regulate the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation in plant genome. We had previously cloned and characterized DNA methyltransferase (DNA MTase) gene homologues (OsMET1) from rice. In this present study, determination of DNA MTase activity in different cellular compartments showed that DNA MTase was enriched in nuclei and the activity was remarkably increased during imbibing dry seeds. We had optimized the purification technique for DNA MTase enzyme from shoots of 10-day-old rice seedlings using the three successive chromatographic columns. The Econo-Pac Q, the Hitrap-Heparin and the Superdex-200 columns yielded a protein fraction of a specific activity of 29, 298 and 800 purification folds, compared to the original nuclear extract, respectively. The purified protein preferred hemi-methylated DNA substrate, suggesting the maintenance activity of methylation. The native rice DNA MTase was approximately 160-170 kDa and exhibited a broad pH optimum in the range of 7.6 and 8.0. The enzyme kinetics and inhibitory effects by methyl donor analogs, base analogs, cations, and cationic amines on rice DNA MTase were examined. Global cytosine methylation status of rice genome during development and in various tissue culture systems were monitored and the results suggested that the cytosine methylation level is not directly correlated with the DNA MTase activity. The purification and characterization of rice DNA MTase enzyme are expected to enhance our understanding of this enzyme function and their possible contributions in Gramineae plant development.
j.1365-313X.2008.03624.x.pdf	De novo DNA methylation induced by siRNA targeted to endogenous transcribed sequences is gene-specific and OsMet1-independent in rice	2008	Plant J	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma 630-0101, Japan.	Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is an essential factor for epigenetic modification of the genome. Recent studies have suggested that endogenous siRNAs induce DNA methylation, chromatin modification and chromatin inactivation at homologous sequences. We have shown that siRNAs targeted to promoter regions of endogenous rice genes induce strong DNA methylation of the targeted sequences, but transcriptional gene silencing is rarely observed. Here, an analysis of epigenetic modifications induced by RNAi targeted to transcribed regions of endogenous rice genes shows that the effects of siRNA are gene-specific, but that they tend to induce higher de novo DNA methylation of CpG dinucleotides than of other cytosines. However, loss of OsMet1 expression by RNAi did not significantly affect levels and patterns of de novo DNA methylation or post-transcriptional mRNA suppression. We also showed that sequence-specific de novo DNA methylation extended both 5' and 3' of the targeted sequences, but there was no significant extension of siRNA signals either 5' or 3'. These results suggest that exogenous siRNAs are strong inducers of de novo DNA methylation in transcribed sequences of rice endogenous genes, but are insufficient to induce heterochromatin formation.
NA	Gene-body CG methylation and divergent expression of duplicate genes in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Key Laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of the Ministry of Education (MOE), Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, P. R. China.	Gene and genome duplication fosters genetic novelty, but redundant gene copies would undergo mutational decay unless preserved via selective or neutral forces. Molecular mechanisms mediating duplicate preservation remain incompletely understood. Several recent studies showed an association between DNA methylation and expression divergence of duplicated genes and suggested a role of epigenetic mechanism in duplicate retention. Here, we compare genome-wide gene-body CG methylation (BCGM) and duplicate gene expression between a rice mutant null for OsMet1-2(a major CG methytransferase in rice) and its isogenic wild-type. We demonstrate a causal link between BCGM divergence and expression difference of duplicate copies. Interestingly, the higher- and lower-expressing copies of duplicates as separate groups show broadly different responses with respect to direction of expression alteration upon loss of BCGM. A role for BCGM in conditioning expression divergence between copies of duplicates generally holds for duplicates generated by whole genome duplication (WGD) or by small-scale duplication processes. However, differences are evident among these categories, including a higher proportion of WGD duplicates manifesting expression alteration, and differential propensities to lose BCGM by the higher- and lower-expression copies in the mutant. Together, our results support the notion that differential epigenetic marking may facilitate long-term retention of duplicate genes.
NA	Rice Interploidy Crosses Disrupt Epigenetic Regulation, Gene Expression, and Seed Development.	2017	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, 1 Weigang Road, Nanjing 210095, China.	Seed development in angiosperms requires a 2:1 maternal-to-paternal genome ratio (2m:1p) in the endosperm. When the ratio is disrupted, the seed development is impaired. Rice interploidy crosses result in endosperm failures. Here we report that the defective endosperm was associated with nonadditive expression of small RNAs and protein-coding genes. Interestingly, 24-nt siRNAs were enriched in the 5' and 3' flanking sequences of nonadditively expressed genes in the interploidy crosses and negatively associated with the expression of imprinted genes. Furthermore, some PRC2 gene family members and the genes for DNA methylation including OsMET1b and OsCMT3a were upregulated in the 2X4 cross but repressed in the reciprocal cross. These different epigenetic effects could lead to precocious or delayed cellularization during endosperm development. Notably, many endosperm-preferred genes including starch metabolic and storage protein genes during grain filling were associated with DNA methylation or H3K27me3 and repressed in both 2X4 and 4X2 crosses. WUSCHEL homeobox2 (WOX2)-like (WOX2L), an endosperm-preferred gene, was expressed specifically in the rice endosperm, In contrast to WOX2 expression in the Arabidopsis embryo. CRISPR/Cas9 editing of WOX2L in transgenic rice blocked starch and protein accumulation, resulting in seed abortion. In addition to gene repression, disrupting epigenetic process in the interploidy crosses also induced expression of stress-responsive genes. Thus, maintaining the 2m:1p genome ratio in the endosperm is essential for normal grain development in rice and other cereal crops.
