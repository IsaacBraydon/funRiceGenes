OsMet1-1|OsMET1a|OsDMT702	OsMet1-2|OsMET1b	Alternative splicing of the rice OsMET1 genes encoding maintenance DNA methyltransferase	While the Arabidopsis genome carries one copy of the methyltransferase 1 (MET1) gene for DNA methyltransferase, which is mainly responsible for maintaining CpG methylation, the rice genome bears two copies of the MET1 genes, OsMET1a and OsMET1b
OsMet1-1|OsMET1a|OsDMT702	OsMet1-2|OsMET1b	Alternative splicing of the rice OsMET1 genes encoding maintenance DNA methyltransferase	The transcripts of OsMET1b accumulate more abundantly than those of OsMET1a in all of the tissues examined, and both genes actively transcribed at the callus, imbibed embryo, root, meristem, young panicle, anther, pistil, and endosperm, all of which contain actively dividing cells
OsCMT3a	OsMet1-2|OsMET1b	Rice Interploidy Crosses Disrupt Epigenetic Regulation, Gene Expression, and Seed Development.	 Furthermore, some PRC2 gene family members and the genes for DNA methylation including OsMET1b and OsCMT3a were upregulated in the 2X4 cross but repressed in the reciprocal cross
OsCCS52A|TAD|TE	OsMet1-2|OsMET1b	Chromatin architectural alterations due to null mutation of a major CG methylase in rice.	 Chromatin structural changes occurred in osmet1-2, including intra-/inter-chromosomal interactions, compartment transition, and topologically associated domains (TAD) variations
