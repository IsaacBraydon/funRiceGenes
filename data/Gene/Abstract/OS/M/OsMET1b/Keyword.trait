OsMet1-2|OsMET1b	meristem	Alternative splicing of the rice OsMET1 genes encoding maintenance DNA methyltransferase	The transcripts of OsMET1b accumulate more abundantly than those of OsMET1a in all of the tissues examined, and both genes actively transcribed at the callus, imbibed embryo, root, meristem, young panicle, anther, pistil, and endosperm, all of which contain actively dividing cells
OsMet1-2|OsMET1b	anther	Alternative splicing of the rice OsMET1 genes encoding maintenance DNA methyltransferase	The transcripts of OsMET1b accumulate more abundantly than those of OsMET1a in all of the tissues examined, and both genes actively transcribed at the callus, imbibed embryo, root, meristem, young panicle, anther, pistil, and endosperm, all of which contain actively dividing cells

OsMet1-2|OsMET1b	methyltransferase	Mutation of a major CG methylase alters genome-wide lncRNA expression in rice	 In this study, we characterized and compared the profiles of genome-wide lncRNA profiles (including long intergenic non-coding RNAs [lincRNAs] and long noncoding natural antisense transcripts [lncNATs]) of a null mutant of the rice DNA methyltransferase 1, OsMET1-2 (designated OsMET1-2-/-) and its isogenic wild type (OsMET1-2+/+)
OsMet1-2|OsMET1b	methyltransferase	Chromatin architectural alterations due to null mutation of a major CG methylase in rice.	 We constructed a high-resolution Hi-C interaction map for the null OsMET1-2 (the major CG methyltransferase in rice) mutant (osmet1-2) and isogenic wild-type rice (WT)
