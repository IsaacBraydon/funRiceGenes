OsGGP	OsMIOX	Ascorbate biosynthesis and its involvement in stress tolerance and plant development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 KO of two isoforms of GDP-D-mannose epimerase (OsGME) reduced the foliar AsA level by 20-30 %, and KO of GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase (OsGGP) by 80 %, while KO of myo-inositol oxygenase (OsMIOX) did not affect foliar AsA levels
