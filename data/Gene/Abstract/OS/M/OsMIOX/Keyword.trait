OsMIOX	drought	OsMIOX, a myo-inositol oxygenase gene, improves drought tolerance through scavenging of reactive oxygen species in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	OsMIOX was expressed predominantly in the roots and induced by drought, H(2)O(2), salt, cold and abscisic acid
OsMIOX	drought	OsMIOX, a myo-inositol oxygenase gene, improves drought tolerance through scavenging of reactive oxygen species in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Together, these data suggest that OsMIOX has a specific function in drought stress tolerance by decreasing oxidative damage
OsMIOX	drought	OsMIOX, a myo-inositol oxygenase gene, improves drought tolerance through scavenging of reactive oxygen species in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	OsMIOX, a myo-inositol oxygenase gene, improves drought tolerance through scavenging of reactive oxygen species in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
OsMIOX	root	OsMIOX, a myo-inositol oxygenase gene, improves drought tolerance through scavenging of reactive oxygen species in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	OsMIOX was expressed predominantly in the roots and induced by drought, H(2)O(2), salt, cold and abscisic acid
OsMIOX	salt	OsMIOX, a myo-inositol oxygenase gene, improves drought tolerance through scavenging of reactive oxygen species in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	OsMIOX was expressed predominantly in the roots and induced by drought, H(2)O(2), salt, cold and abscisic acid
OsMIOX	oxidative	OsMIOX, a myo-inositol oxygenase gene, improves drought tolerance through scavenging of reactive oxygen species in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Together, these data suggest that OsMIOX has a specific function in drought stress tolerance by decreasing oxidative damage
OsMIOX	growth	OsMIOX, a myo-inositol oxygenase gene, improves drought tolerance through scavenging of reactive oxygen species in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	The transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsMIOX showed obviously improved growth performance in the medium containing 200 mM mannitol
OsMIOX	drought tolerance	OsMIOX, a myo-inositol oxygenase gene, improves drought tolerance through scavenging of reactive oxygen species in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	OsMIOX, a myo-inositol oxygenase gene, improves drought tolerance through scavenging of reactive oxygen species in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
