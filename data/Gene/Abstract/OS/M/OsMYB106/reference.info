Irrigated lands are increasingly salinized, which adversely affects agricultural productivity. To respond to high sodium (Na+) concentrations, plants harbor multiple Na+ transport systems. Rice (Oryza sativa) HIGH-AFFINITY POTASSIUM (K+) TRANSPORTER1;5 (OsHKT1;5), a Na+-selective transporter, maintains K+/Na+ homeostasis under salt stress. However, the mechanism regulating OsHKT1;5 expression remains unknown. Here, we present evidence that a protein complex consisting of rice BCL-2-ASSOCIATED ATHANOGENE4 (OsBAG4), OsMYB106, and OsSUVH7 regulates OsHKT1;5 expression in response to salt stress. We isolated a salt stress-sensitive mutant, osbag4-1, that showed significantly reduced OsHKT1;5 expression and reduced K+ and elevated Na+ levels in shoots. Using comparative interactomics, we isolated two OsBAG4-interacting proteins, OsMYB106 (a MYB transcription factor) and OsSUVH7 (a DNA methylation reader), that were crucial for OsHKT1;5 expression. OsMYB106 and OsSUVH7 bound to the MYB binding cis-element (MYBE) and the miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) upstream of the MYBE, respectively, in the OsHKT1;5 promoter. OsBAG4 functioned as a bridge between OsSUVH7 and OsMYB106 to facilitate OsMYB106 binding to the consensus MYBE in the OsHKT1;5 promoter, thereby activating the OsHKT1;5 expression. Elimination of the MITE or knockout of OsMYB106 or OsSUVH7 decreased OsHKT1;5 expression and increased salt sensitivity. Our findings reveal a transcriptional complex, consisting of a DNA methylation reader, a chaperone regulator, and a transcription factor, that collaboratively regulate OsHKT1;5 expression during salinity stress.
NA	Plasma membrane-localized Hsp40/DNAJ chaperone protein facilitates OsSUVH7-OsBAG4-OsMYB106 transcriptional complex formation for OsHKT1;5 activation.	2022	J Integr Plant Biol	Key Laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of the Ministry of Education (MOE), Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, China.	The salinization of irrigated land affects agricultural productivity. HIGH-AFFINITY POTASSIUM (K(+) ) TRANSPORTER 1;5 (OsHKT1;5)-dependent sodium (Na(+) ) transport is a key salt tolerance mechanism during rice growth and development. Using a previously generated high-throughput activation tagging-based T-DNA insertion mutant pool, we isolated a mutant exhibiting salt stress-sensitive phenotype, caused by a reduction in OsHKT1;5 transcripts. The salt stress-sensitive phenotype of this mutant results from the loss of function of OsDNAJ15, which encodes plasma membrane-localized heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40). osdnaj15 loss-of-function mutants show decreased plant height, increased leaf angle, and reduced grain number caused by shorter panicle length and fewer branches. On the other h&#x27;and, OsDNAJ15-overexpression plants showed salt stress-tolerant phenotypes. Intriguingly, salt stress facilitates the nuclear relocation of OsDNAJ15 so that it can interact with OsBAG4, and OsDNAJ15 and OsBAG4 synergistically facilitate the DNA-binding activity of OsMYB106 to positively regulate the expression of OsHKT1;5. Overall, our results reveal a novel function of plasma membrane-localized Hsp40 protein in modulating, alongside chaperon regulator OsBAG4, transcriptional regulation under salinity stress tolerance.
