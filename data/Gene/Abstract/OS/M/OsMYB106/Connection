OsBAG4	OsMYB106	A DNA Methylation Reader-Chaperone Regulator-Transcription Factor Complex Activates OsHKT1;5 Expression during Salinity Stress	 Here, we present evidence that a protein complex consisting of rice BCL-2-ASSOCIATED ATHANOGENE4 (OsBAG4), OsMYB106, and OsSUVH7 regulates OsHKT1;5 expression in response to salt stress
OsBAG4	OsMYB106	A DNA Methylation Reader-Chaperone Regulator-Transcription Factor Complex Activates OsHKT1;5 Expression during Salinity Stress	 OsBAG4 functioned as a bridge between OsSUVH7 and OsMYB106 to facilitate OsMYB106 binding to the consensus MYBE in the OsHKT1;5 promoter, thereby activating the OsHKT1;5 expression

OsBAG4	OsMYB106	Plasma membrane-localized Hsp40/DNAJ chaperone protein facilitates OsSUVH7-OsBAG4-OsMYB106 transcriptional complex formation for OsHKT1;5 activation.	 Intriguingly, salt stress facilitates the nuclear relocation of OsDNAJ15 so that it can interact with OsBAG4, and OsDNAJ15 and OsBAG4 synergistically facilitate the DNA-binding activity of OsMYB106 to positively regulate the expression of OsHKT1;5
