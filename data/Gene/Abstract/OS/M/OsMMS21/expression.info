OsMMS21	 Transcriptome analysis showed a significant decrease in the expression of genes involved in auxin signaling in the roots of osmms21 mutants |  Moreover, the expression levels of the cycB2-1 and MCM genes, which are involved the cell cycle, were significantly lower in the shoots of the mutants, indicating that OsMMS21 was involved in both hormone signaling pathways and the cell cycle
