OsWJUMK1|OsMPK12|OsBWMK1	defense	Alternative splicing of the OsBWMK1 gene generates three transcript variants showing differential subcellular localizations	" Moreover, treatment with defense signaling related molecules, such as H(2)O(2) and SA, induced translocation of OsBWMK1 isoforms from the cytoplasm to the nucleus"
OsWJUMK1|OsMPK12|OsBWMK1	transcription factor	OsBWMK1 mediates SA-dependent defense responses by activating the transcription factor OsWRKY33	 In a previous study, we demonstrated that OsBWMK1, which localizes in the nucleus, mediates PR gene expression by activating the OsEREBP1 transcription factor, and that the constitutive expression of OsBWMK1 also enhances resistance against pathogen infections [Y| Altogether, OsBWMK1 may mediate SA-dependent defense responses by activating the WRKY transcription factor in plants|OsBWMK1 mediates SA-dependent defense responses by activating the transcription factor OsWRKY33
OsWJUMK1|OsMPK12|OsBWMK1	defense	Identification and characterization of alternative promoters of the rice MAP kinase gene OsBWMK1	" Furthermore, the expression of pOsBWMK1S::GUS was upregulated in response to hydrogen peroxide, a plant defense signaling molecule, in both plant species"
