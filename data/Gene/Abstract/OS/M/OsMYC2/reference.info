NA	Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice	2014	Nature Communications	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China	The spikelet is the basal unit of inflorescence in grasses, and its formation is crucial for reproductive success and cereal yield. Here, we report a previously unknown role of the plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) in determining rice (Oryza sativa) spikelet morphogenesis. The extra glume 1 (eg1) and eg2 mutants exhibit altered spikelet morphology with changed floral organ identity and number, as well as defective floral meristem determinacy. We show that EG1 is a plastid-targeted lipase that participates in JA biosynthesis, and EG2/OsJAZ1 is a JA signalling repressor that interacts with a putative JA receptor, OsCOI1b, to trigger OsJAZ1¡¯s degradation during spikelet development. OsJAZ1 also interacts with OsMYC2, a transcription factor in the JA signalling pathway, and represses OsMYC2¡¯s role in activating OsMADS1, an E-class gene crucial to the spikelet development. This work discovers a key regulatory mechanism of grass spikelet development and suggests that the role of JA in reproduction has diversified during the flowering plant evolution.
