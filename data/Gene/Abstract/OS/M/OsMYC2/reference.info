NA	Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice	2014	Nature Communications	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China	The spikelet is the basal unit of inflorescence in grasses, and its formation is crucial for reproductive success and cereal yield. Here, we report a previously unknown role of the plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) in determining rice (Oryza sativa) spikelet morphogenesis. The extra glume 1 (eg1) and eg2 mutants exhibit altered spikelet morphology with changed floral organ identity and number, as well as defective floral meristem determinacy. We show that EG1 is a plastid-targeted lipase that participates in JA biosynthesis, and EG2/OsJAZ1 is a JA signalling repressor that interacts with a putative JA receptor, OsCOI1b, to trigger OsJAZ1's degradation during spikelet development. OsJAZ1 also interacts with OsMYC2, a transcription factor in the JA signalling pathway, and represses OsMYC2's role in activating OsMADS1, an E-class gene crucial to the spikelet development. This work discovers a key regulatory mechanism of grass spikelet development and suggests that the role of JA in reproduction has diversified during the flowering plant evolution.
NA	Overexpression of OsMYC2 Results in the Up-Regulation of Early JA-Rresponsive Genes and Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	Plant Genome and Resource Research Center, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagawa University, Miki, Kagawa, 761-0795 Japan.	JASMONATE ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins act as transcriptional repressors of jasmonic acid (JA) responses and play a crucial role in the regulation of host immunity in plants. Here, we report that OsMYC2, a JAZ-interacting transcription factor in rice (Oryza sativa L.), plays an important role in the resistance response against rice bacterial blight, which is one of the most serious diseases in rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The results showed that OsMYC2 interacted with some OsJAZ proteins in a JAZ-interacting domain (JID)-dependent manner. The up-regulation of OsMYC2 in response to JA was regulated by OsJAZ8. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsMYC2 exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and were more resistant to Xoo. A large-scale microarray analysis revealed that OsMYC2 up-regulated OsJAZ10 as well as many other defense-related genes. OsMYC2 selectively bound to the G-box-like motif of the OsJAZ10 promoter in vivo and regulated the expression of early JA-responsive genes, but not of late JA-responsive genes. The nuclear localization of OsMYC2 depended on a nuclear localization signal within JID. Overall, we conclude that OsMYC2 acts as a positive regulator of early JA signals in the JA-induced resistance against Xoo in rice.
NA	OsMYC2, an essential factor for JA-inductive sakuranetin production in rice, interacts with MYC2-like proteins that enhance its transactivation ability.	2017	Sci Rep	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.	Biosynthesis of sakuranetin, a flavonoid anti-fungal phytoalexin that occurs in rice, is highly dependent on jasmonic acid (JA) signalling and induced by a variety of environmental stimuli. We previously identified OsNOMT, which encodes naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase (NOMT); NOMT is a key enzyme for sakuranetin production. Although OsNOMT expression is induced by JA treatment, the regulation mechanism that activates the biosynthetic pathway of sakuranetin has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we show that JA-inducible basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional factor OsMYC2 drastically enhances the activity of the OsNOMT promoter and is essential for JA-inducible sakuranetin production. In addition, we identified 2 collaborators of OsMYC2, OsMYC2-like protein 1 and 2 (OsMYL1 and OsMYL2) that further activated the OsNOMT promoter in synergy with OsMYC2. Physical interaction of OsMYC2 with OsMYL1 and OsMYL2 further supported the idea that these interactions lead to the enhancement of the transactivation activity of OsMYC2. Our results indicate that JA signalling via OsMYC2 is reinforced by OsMYL1 and OsMYL2, resulting in the inductive production of sakuranetin during defence responses in rice.
NA	OsMYC2 mediates numerous defence-related transcriptional changes via jasmonic acid signalling in rice.	2017	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.	Jasmonic acid (JA) plays central roles in various events in plants, especially defence against pathogens and insects. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor MYC2 has attracted attention as a master regulator of JA signalling in dicotyledonous plants. However, how MYC2 functions in monocotyledonous plants, including agriculturally important crops such as cultivated rice, has been poorly understood. To elucidate the comprehensive effects of rice MYC2 (OsMYC2) on the JA-inducible transcriptional modifications, we performed RNA-sequencing by using OsMYC2-knockdown plants (osmyc2RNAi). In osmyc2RNAi, JA-inducible expression of many defence-related genes, for example chitinases and proteinase inhibitors, was compromised. Decrease in JA-dependent activation of the biosynthetic pathways of specialised metabolites, especially defence compounds, was also evident in the osmyc2RNAi line. Furthermore, a substantial change was noted in the expression of distinct types of transcription factors, such as MYB-type factors, likely depicting the importance of OsMYC2 in not only defence responses but also other morphogenetic events. Our findings provide fundamental information to understand the overall functions of MYC2 in JA signalling in monocotyledonous plants, which might yield agricultural benefits.
NA	Identification of OsMYC2-regulated senescence-associated genes in rice.	2017	Planta	Plant Genome and Resource Research Center, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagawa University, Miki, Kagawa, 761-0795, Japan.	The jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive transcription factor OsMYC2 acts as a positive regulator of leaf senescence by direct regulation of some senescence-associated genes in rice. OsMYC2, a transcription factor (TF), acts as a positive regulator of jasmonic acid (JA) signaling involved in development and defense in rice. Here, we report that OsMYC2 plays an important role in leaf senescence under dark-induced senescence (DIS) conditions. Overexpression of OsMYC2 significantly promoted leaf senescence, indicated by reduction of chlorophyll content under DIS conditions in rice. Leaf senescence under the DIS conditions was negatively regulated by OsJAZ8, a rice jasmonate ZIM-domain protein involved in the JA signaling pathway. OsMYC2 upregulated the expression of some senescence-associated genes (SAGs) and selectively bound to the G-box/G-box-like motifs in the promoters of some SAGs in vivo. These results suggest that OsMYC2 acts as a positive regulator of leaf senescence by direct- or indirect-regulation of SAGs in rice.
NA	Rice MYC2 (OsMYC2) modulates light-dependent seedling phenotype, disease defence but not ABA signalling.	2017	J Biosci	School of life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110 067, India.	Arabidopsis MYC2 (AtMYC2) is a bHLH class transcription factor that mediates light-dependent seedling development, disease defence, JA and ABA signalling. AtMYC2 gene modulates hypocotyl elongation and expression of chlorophyll A/B binding protein 1 (CAB1) and rubisco small subunit protein1 (RBCS1) under blue light. The atmyc2 mutants are resistant against virulent bacterial pathogens. MYC2 orthologues from several crop plants have been characterized. The rice gene Os10g42430 has been referred earlier as OsMYC2 and has been shown to promote expression of JA-inducible genes. However, the role of OsMYC2 in seedling development under ABA, dark or light of specific wavelengths was not known. It was also not known whether OsMYC2 complements AtMYC2 function in Arabidopsis. We show here that expression of OsMYC2 in the atmyc2 mutant of Arabidopsis complements the blue-light-mediated defects in hypocotyl elongation and expression of CAB1 and RBCS1. We generated multiple transgenic rice lines for over-expression and RNAi-mediated suppression of OsMYC2. In agreement with AtMYC2 function, OsMYC2 over-expression and RNAi lines showed enhanced and suppressed seedling growth compared to WT plants respectively under blue light, and showed little effect under white light or dark. In agreement with the negative regulatory role of AtMYC2 in disease defence, the RNAi lines showed enhanced resistance against bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. However, in contrast to AtMYC2 function, OsMYC2 influences seedling development under red light and show no effect in ABA-mediated seed germination. Thus, the results suggest evolutionarily conserved as well as the distinct role of OsMYC2 in comparison with AtMYC2.
NA	OsJAZ13 Negatively Regulates Jasmonate Signaling and Activates Hypersensitive Cell Death Response in Rice	2020	Int J Mol Sci.	  State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, The Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins belong to the subgroup of TIFY family and act as key regulators of jasmonate (JA) responses in plants. To date, only a few JAZ proteins have been characterized in rice. Here, we report the identification and function of rice OsJAZ13 gene. The gene encodes three different splice variants: OsJAZ13a, OsJAZ13b, and OsJAZ13c. The expression of OsJAZ13 was mainly activated in vegetative tissues and transiently responded to JA and ethylene. Subcellular localization analysis indicated OsJAZ13a is a nuclear protein. Yeast two-hybrid assays revealed OsJAZ13a directly interacts with OsMYC2, and also with OsCOI1, in a COR-dependent manner. Furthermore, OsJAZ13a recruited a general co-repressor OsTPL via an adaptor protein OsNINJA. Remarkably, overexpression of OsJAZ13a resulted in the attenuation of root by methyl JA. Furthermore, OsJAZ13a-overexpressing plants developed lesion mimics in the sheath after approximately 30-45 days of growth. Tillers with necrosis died a few days later. Gene-expression analysis suggested the role of OsJAZ13 in modulating the expression of JA/ethylene response-related genes to regulate growth and activate hypersensitive cell death. Taken together, these observations describe a novel regulatory mechanism in rice and provide the basis for elucidating the function of OsJAZ13 in signal transduction and cell death in plants.
