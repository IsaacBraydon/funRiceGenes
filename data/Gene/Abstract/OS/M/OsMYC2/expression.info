OsMYC2	Overexpression of OsMYC2 Results in the Up-Regulation of Early JA-Rresponsive Genes and Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice. |  OsMYC2 selectively bound to the G-box-like motif of the OsJAZ10 promoter in vivo and regulated the expression of early JA-responsive genes, but not of late JA-responsive genes	Overexpression of OsMYC2 Results in the Up-Regulation of Early JA-Rresponsive Genes and Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice.
OsMYC2	 Overexpression of OsMYC2 significantly promoted leaf senescence, indicated by reduction of chlorophyll content under DIS conditions in rice |  OsMYC2 upregulated the expression of some senescence-associated genes (SAGs) and selectively bound to the G-box/G-box-like motifs in the promoters of some SAGs in vivo	 Overexpression of OsMYC2 significantly promoted leaf senescence, indicated by reduction of chlorophyll content under DIS conditions in rice
