OsMYC2 selectively bound to the G-box-like motif of the OsJAZ10 promoter in vivo and regulated the expression of early JA-responsive genes, but not of late JA-responsive genes
OsMYC2	OsMYL2	OsMYC2, an essential factor for JA-inductive sakuranetin production in rice, interacts with MYC2-like proteins that enhance its transactivation ability.	In addition, we identified 2 collaborators of OsMYC2, OsMYC2-like protein 1 and 2 (OsMYL1 and OsMYL2) that further activated the OsNOMT promoter in synergy with OsMYC2
OsMYC2	OsMYL2	OsMYC2, an essential factor for JA-inductive sakuranetin production in rice, interacts with MYC2-like proteins that enhance its transactivation ability.	Physical interaction of OsMYC2 with OsMYL1 and OsMYL2 further supported the idea that these interactions lead to the enhancement of the transactivation activity of OsMYC2

Our results indicate that JA signalling via OsMYC2 is reinforced by OsMYL1 and OsMYL2, resulting in the inductive production of sakuranetin during defence responses in rice
OsMYC2	OsNOMT	OsMYC2, an essential factor for JA-inductive sakuranetin production in rice, interacts with MYC2-like proteins that enhance its transactivation ability.	In this study, we show that JA-inducible basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional factor OsMYC2 drastically enhances the activity of the OsNOMT promoter and is essential for JA-inducible sakuranetin production
OsMYC2	OsNOMT	OsMYC2, an essential factor for JA-inductive sakuranetin production in rice, interacts with MYC2-like proteins that enhance its transactivation ability.	In addition, we identified 2 collaborators of OsMYC2, OsMYC2-like protein 1 and 2 (OsMYL1 and OsMYL2) that further activated the OsNOMT promoter in synergy with OsMYC2
OsMYC2	OsNINJA1	Overexpression of OsNINJA1 negatively affects a part of OsMYC2-mediated abiotic and biotic responses in rice.	 In this study, we found that OsNINJA1, which is a JAZ-interacting adaptor protein, plays an important role in JA signaling that is positively regulated by the transcription factor OsMYC2 in rice
OsMYC2	OsSRO1a|TWI1	The overexpression of OsSRO1a, which encodes an OsNINJA1- and OsMYC2-interacting protein, negatively affects OsMYC2-mediated jasmonate signaling in rice.	OsNINJA1-interacting protein, OsSRO1a, acts as a mediator that suppresses OsMYC2 activity in response to JA
OsMYC2	OsSRO1a|TWI1	The overexpression of OsSRO1a, which encodes an OsNINJA1- and OsMYC2-interacting protein, negatively affects OsMYC2-mediated jasmonate signaling in rice.	 OsSRO1a also interacted with OsMYC2, a positive transcription factor in JA signaling, in both plant and yeast cells

GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OsMYC2	Rice stripe virus suppresses jasmonic acid-mediated resistance by hijacking brassinosteroid signaling pathway in rice	 OsGSK2 physically interacts with OsMYC2, resulting in the degradation of OsMYC2 by phosphorylation and reduces JA-mediated defense to facilitate virus infection
