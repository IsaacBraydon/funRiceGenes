OsJAZ1|OsTIFY3|EG2	OsMYC2	Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice	OsJAZ1 also interacts with OsMYC2, a transcription factor in the JA signalling pathway, and represses OsMYC2's role in activating OsMADS1, an E-class gene crucial to the spikelet development.
OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	OsMYC2	Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice	OsJAZ1 also interacts with OsMYC2, a transcription factor in the JA signalling pathway, and represses OsMYC2's role in activating OsMADS1, an E-class gene crucial to the spikelet development.
OsJAZ8|OsTIFY10c	OsMYC2	Overexpression of OsMYC2 Results in the Up-Regulation of Early JA-Rresponsive Genes and Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice.	 The up-regulation of OsMYC2 in response to JA was regulated by OsJAZ8
OsJAZ10	OsMYC2	Overexpression of OsMYC2 Results in the Up-Regulation of Early JA-Rresponsive Genes and Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice.	 A large-scale microarray analysis revealed that OsMYC2 up-regulated OsJAZ10 as well as many other defense-related genes
OsJAZ10	OsMYC2	Overexpression of OsMYC2 Results in the Up-Regulation of Early JA-Rresponsive Genes and Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice.	 OsMYC2 selectively bound to the G-box-like motif of the OsJAZ10 promoter in vivo and regulated the expression of early JA-responsive genes, but not of late JA-responsive genes
