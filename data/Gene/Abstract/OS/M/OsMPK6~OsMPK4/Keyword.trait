OsMPK6|OsMPK4	seedling	Biochemical identification of the OsMKK6-OsMPK3 signalling pathway for chilling stress tolerance in rice	 An MBP (myelin basic protein) kinase assay of the immunoprecipitation complex indicated that OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 were activated in response to a moderately low temperature (12 degrees C), but not a severely low temperature (4 degrees C) in rice seedlings
OsMPK6|OsMPK4	jasmonic	Opposite functions of a rice mitogen-activated protein kinase during the process of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae	 Activation of OsMPK6 resulted in the formation of lesion mimics and local resistance to Xoo, accompanied by the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), and the induced expression of SA- and JA-signaling genes
OsMPK6|OsMPK4	defense	Mitogen-activated protein kinase OsMPK6 negatively regulates rice disease resistance to bacterial pathogens	 These results suggest that OsMPK6 functions as a repressor to regulate rice defense responses upon bacterial invasion
OsMPK6|OsMPK4	defense	Opposite functions of a rice mitogen-activated protein kinase during the process of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae	" Nuclear localization of OsMPK6 was essential for local resistance, suggesting that modulating the expression of defense-responsive genes through transcription regulators may be the primary mechanism of OsMPK6-mediated local resistance"

OsMPK6|OsMPK4	transcription regulator	Opposite functions of a rice mitogen-activated protein kinase during the process of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae	 Nuclear localization of OsMPK6 was essential for local resistance, suggesting that modulating the expression of defense-responsive genes through transcription regulators may be the primary mechanism of OsMPK6-mediated local resistance
OsMPK6|OsMPK4	salicylic acid	Opposite functions of a rice mitogen-activated protein kinase during the process of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae	 Activation of OsMPK6 resulted in the formation of lesion mimics and local resistance to Xoo, accompanied by the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), and the induced expression of SA- and JA-signaling genes

OsMPK6|OsMPK4	 sa 	Opposite functions of a rice mitogen-activated protein kinase during the process of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae	 The knock-out of OsMPK6 resulted in enhanced Xoo resistance, increased accumulation of SA and enhanced resistance to X

OsMPK6|OsMPK4	jasmonic acid	Opposite functions of a rice mitogen-activated protein kinase during the process of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae	 Activation of OsMPK6 resulted in the formation of lesion mimics and local resistance to Xoo, accompanied by the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), and the induced expression of SA- and JA-signaling genes
OsMPK6|OsMPK4	 xoo 	Opposite functions of a rice mitogen-activated protein kinase during the process of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae	 The knock-out of OsMPK6 resulted in enhanced Xoo resistance, increased accumulation of SA and enhanced resistance to X| Xoo infection induced the expression of PR1a, the marker gene of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), in systemic health tissues of OsMPK6-knock-out plants
