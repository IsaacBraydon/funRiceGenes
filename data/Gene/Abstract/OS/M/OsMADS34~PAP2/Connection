Hd3a	OsMADS34|PAP2	Inflorescence meristem identity in rice is specified by overlapping functions of three AP1/FUL-like MADS box genes and PAP2, a SEPALLATA MADS box gene	 Furthermore, the precocious flowering phenotype caused by the overexpression of Hd3a, a rice florigen gene, was weakened in pap2-1 mutants
OsMADS14	OsMADS34|PAP2	Inflorescence meristem identity in rice is specified by overlapping functions of three AP1/FUL-like MADS box genes and PAP2, a SEPALLATA MADS box gene	 Using laser microdissection and microarrays, we found that expression of PANICLE PHYTOMER2 (PAP2) and three APETALA1 (AP1)/FRUITFULL (FUL)-like genes (MADS14, MADS15, and MADS18) is induced in the SAM during meristem phase transition in rice (Oryza sativa)
OsMADS15|DEP	OsMADS34|PAP2	Inflorescence meristem identity in rice is specified by overlapping functions of three AP1/FUL-like MADS box genes and PAP2, a SEPALLATA MADS box gene	 Further depletion of PAP2 function from these triple knockdown plants inhibited the transition of the meristem to the IM| Using laser microdissection and microarrays, we found that expression of PANICLE PHYTOMER2 (PAP2) and three APETALA1 (AP1)/FRUITFULL (FUL)-like genes (MADS14, MADS15, and MADS18) is induced in the SAM during meristem phase transition in rice (Oryza sativa)| PAP2 physically interacts with MAD14 and MADS15 in vivo
OsMADS18	OsMADS34|PAP2	Inflorescence meristem identity in rice is specified by overlapping functions of three AP1/FUL-like MADS box genes and PAP2, a SEPALLATA MADS box gene	 Using laser microdissection and microarrays, we found that expression of PANICLE PHYTOMER2 (PAP2) and three APETALA1 (AP1)/FRUITFULL (FUL)-like genes (MADS14, MADS15, and MADS18) is induced in the SAM during meristem phase transition in rice (Oryza sativa)
OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	OsMADS34|PAP2	The SEPALLATA-like gene OsMADS34 is required for rice inflorescence and spikelet development	 Moreover, analysis of the double mutant osmads34 osmads1 suggests that OsMADS34 specifies the identities of floral organs, including the lemma/palea, lodicules, stamens, and carpel, in combination with another rice SEP-like gene, OsMADS1| Collectively, our study suggests that the origin and diversification of OsMADS34 and OsMADS1 contribute to the origin of distinct grass inflorescences and spikelets
OsEMF2b	OsMADS34|PAP2	The polycomb group gene EMF2B is essential for maintenance of floral meristem determinacy in rice	Transcriptome analysis identified the E-function genes OsMADS1, OsMADS6 and OsMADS34 as differentially expressed in the emf2b mutant compared with wild type. 
OsEMF2b	OsMADS34|PAP2	The polycomb group gene EMF2B is essential for maintenance of floral meristem determinacy in rice	OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, known to be required for meristem determinacy in rice, have reduced expression in the emf2b mutant, whereas OsMADS34 which interacts genetically with OsMADS1 was ectopically expressed.
