OsMUTE	OsSCR|OsSCR2	Multiple transcriptional factors control stomata development in rice.	 More importantly, we found that OsSCR/OsSHR controls the initiation of stomatal lineage cells and the formation of subsidiary cells, and the transcription of OsSCR is activated by OsSPCH and OsMUTE
OsMUTE	OsSCR|OsSCR2	SCARECROW is deployed in distinct contexts during rice and maize leaf development	The stomatal regulator OsMUTE is downregulated in Osscr1;Osscr2 mutants, indicating that OsSCR acts early in stomatal development.
