OsMYB511	 Tissue-specific expression analysis indicated that OsMYB511 was highly expressed in rice panicles at earlier development stage |  Interestingly, OsMYB511 expression is fully subjected to circadian rhythm regulation |  Co-expression analysis revealed additional 2 MYB genes co-expressed with OsMYB511, implying that these MYB genes might coordinately regulate stress responses in rice
