NA	OsMYB511 encodes a MYB domain transcription activator early regulated by abiotic stress in rice.	2015	Genet Mol Res	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	The MYB-domain proteins exist universally across diverse organisms and regulate numerous processes during the plant life cycle. In the present research, a full-length MYB gene OsMYB511 was identified from rice seedlings through microarray data. Induction of OsMYB511 by cold stress was dramatic in japonica cultivar Jiucaiqing as compared to indica IR26. In addition to cold, OsMYB511 was also markedly induced by osmotic stress, high temperature, and exogenous ABA, suggesting that OsMYB511 is a multiple-stress responsive gene in rice. Tissue-specific expression analysis indicated that OsMYB511 was highly expressed in rice panicles at earlier development stage. Interestingly, OsMYB511 expression is fully subjected to circadian rhythm regulation. The subcellular localization and yeast hybrid assay suggested that OsMYB511 is nucleus-localized transcription activator. Deletion analysis suggested that trans-activation activity of OsMYB511 relied on its C-terminus. Co-expression analysis revealed additional 2 MYB genes co-expressed with OsMYB511, implying that these MYB genes might coordinately regulate stress responses in rice.
NA	Overexpression of a novel MYB-related transcription factor, OsMYBR1, confers improved drought tolerance and decreased ABA sensitivity in rice.	2017	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Key Laboratory of Agro-Ecological Processes in Subtropical Region, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changsha, People&#39;s Republic of China.	The MYB proteins play important roles in regulating plant responses to environmental stresses. We cloned and functionally characterized a novel MYB-related gene, OsMYBR1, from rice. Our microarray and qRT-PCR analyses showed that its expression was induced by drought and cold in different tissues at various developmental stages. This gene encodes a putative MYB-related protein of 463 amino acid residues. Compared with wild-type (WT) plants, transgenic plants over-expressing OsMYBR1 exhibited much greater tolerance to drought stress and decreased sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA). Under drought treatment, levels of free proline and soluble sugar were higher in transgenic plants than in the WT. Furthermore, transcriptional was significantly increased in transgenic plants under drought stressed conditions and ABA. Our results provide evidence that OsMYBR1 is involved in mediating plant responses to ABA and drought.
