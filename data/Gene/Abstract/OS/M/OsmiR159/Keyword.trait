OsmiR159	resistance	OsmiR159 Modulate BPH Resistance Through Regulating G-Protein γ Subunit GS3 Gene in Rice.	 In this study, we found that each OsMIR159 gene in rice responded to BPH feeding very obviously, and genetic function assay proved them to negatively regulate BPH resistance, with STTM159 showing resistance to BPH, and over expression of OsmiR159d susceptible to BPH
