NA	OsMKK3, a Stress-Responsive Protein Kinase, Positively Regulates Rice Resistance to Nilaparvata lugens via Phytohormone Dynamics.	2019	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology &amp; Ministry of Agriculture Key Lab of Agricultural Entomology, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China. 3090100232@zju.edu.cn.	Plants undergo several but very precise molecular, physiological, and biochemical modulations in response to biotic stresses. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades orchestrate multiple cellular processes including plant growth and development as well as plant responses against abiotic and biotic stresses. However, the role of MAPK kinases (MAPKKs/MKKs/MEKs) in the regulation of plant resistance to herbivores has not been extensively investigated. Here, we cloned a rice MKK gene, OsMKK3, and investigated its function. It was observed that mechanical wounding, infestation of brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, and treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or salicylic acid (SA) could induce the expression of OsMKK3. The over-expression of OsMKK3 (oe-MKK3) increased levels of jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile), and abscisic acid (ABA), and decreased SA levels in rice after BPH attack. Additionally, the preference for feeding and oviposition, the hatching rate of BPH eggs, and BPH nymph survival rate were significantly compromised due to over-expression of OsMKK3. Besides, oe-MKK3 also augmented chlorophyll content but impaired plant growth. We confirm that MKK3 plays a pivotal role in the signaling pathway. It is proposed that OsMKK3 mediated positive regulation of rice resistance to BPH by means of herbivory-induced phytohormone dynamics.
