NA	OsMKK3, a Stress-Responsive Protein Kinase, Positively Regulates Rice Resistance to Nilaparvata lugens via Phytohormone Dynamics.	2019	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology &amp; Ministry of Agriculture Key Lab of Agricultural Entomology, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China. 3090100232@zju.edu.cn.	Plants undergo several but very precise molecular, physiological, and biochemical modulations in response to biotic stresses. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades orchestrate multiple cellular processes including plant growth and development as well as plant responses against abiotic and biotic stresses. However, the role of MAPK kinases (MAPKKs/MKKs/MEKs) in the regulation of plant resistance to herbivores has not been extensively investigated. Here, we cloned a rice MKK gene, OsMKK3, and investigated its function. It was observed that mechanical wounding, infestation of brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, and treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or salicylic acid (SA) could induce the expression of OsMKK3. The over-expression of OsMKK3 (oe-MKK3) increased levels of jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile), and abscisic acid (ABA), and decreased SA levels in rice after BPH attack. Additionally, the preference for feeding and oviposition, the hatching rate of BPH eggs, and BPH nymph survival rate were significantly compromised due to over-expression of OsMKK3. Besides, oe-MKK3 also augmented chlorophyll content but impaired plant growth. We confirm that MKK3 plays a pivotal role in the signaling pathway. It is proposed that OsMKK3 mediated positive regulation of rice resistance to BPH by means of herbivory-induced phytohormone dynamics.
NA	OrMKK3 Influences Morphology and Grain Size in Rice	2021	J Plant Biol	Rice Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences/Guangxi Key Laboratory of Rice Genetics and Breeding, Nanning, 530007 China.	Although morphology and grain size are important to rice growth and yield, the identity of abundant natural allelic variations that determine agronomically important differences in crops is unknown. Here, we characterized the function of mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 from Oryza officinalis Wall. ex Watt encoded by OrMKK3. Different alternative splicing variants occurred in OrMKK3. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-OrMKK3 fusion proteins localized to the cell membrane and nuclei of rice protoplasts. Overexpression of OrMKK3 influenced the expression levels of the grain size-related genes SMG1, GW8, GL3, GW2, and DEP3. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OrMKK3 is well conserved in plants while showing large amounts of variation between indica, japonica, and wild rice. In addition, OrMKK3 slightly influenced brassinosteroid (BR) responses and the expression levels of BR-related genes. Our findings thus identify a new gene, OrMKK3, influencing morphology and grain size and that represents a possible link between mitogen-activated protein kinase and BR response pathways in grain growth.
