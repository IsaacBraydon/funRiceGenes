NA	OsMKK3, a Stress-Responsive Protein Kinase, Positively Regulates Rice Resistance to Nilaparvata lugens via Phytohormone Dynamics.	2019	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology &amp; Ministry of Agriculture Key Lab of Agricultural Entomology, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China. 3090100232@zju.edu.cn.	Plants undergo several but very precise molecular, physiological, and biochemical modulations in response to biotic stresses. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades orchestrate multiple cellular processes including plant growth and development as well as plant responses against abiotic and biotic stresses. However, the role of MAPK kinases (MAPKKs/MKKs/MEKs) in the regulation of plant resistance to herbivores has not been extensively investigated. Here, we cloned a rice MKK gene, OsMKK3, and investigated its function. It was observed that mechanical wounding, infestation of brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, and treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or salicylic acid (SA) could induce the expression of OsMKK3. The over-expression of OsMKK3 (oe-MKK3) increased levels of jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile), and abscisic acid (ABA), and decreased SA levels in rice after BPH attack. Additionally, the preference for feeding and oviposition, the hatching rate of BPH eggs, and BPH nymph survival rate were significantly compromised due to over-expression of OsMKK3. Besides, oe-MKK3 also augmented chlorophyll content but impaired plant growth. We confirm that MKK3 plays a pivotal role in the signaling pathway. It is proposed that OsMKK3 mediated positive regulation of rice resistance to BPH by means of herbivory-induced phytohormone dynamics.
NA	OrMKK3 Influences Morphology and Grain Size in Rice	2021	J Plant Biol	Rice Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences/Guangxi Key Laboratory of Rice Genetics and Breeding, Nanning, 530007 China.	Although morphology and grain size are important to rice growth and yield, the identity of abundant natural allelic variations that determine agronomically important differences in crops is unknown. Here, we characterized the function of mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 from Oryza officinalis Wall. ex Watt encoded by OrMKK3. Different alternative splicing variants occurred in OrMKK3. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-OrMKK3 fusion proteins localized to the cell membrane and nuclei of rice protoplasts. Overexpression of OrMKK3 influenced the expression levels of the grain size-related genes SMG1, GW8, GL3, GW2, and DEP3. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OrMKK3 is well conserved in plants while showing large amounts of variation between indica, japonica, and wild rice. In addition, OrMKK3 slightly influenced brassinosteroid (BR) responses and the expression levels of BR-related genes. Our findings thus identify a new gene, OrMKK3, influencing morphology and grain size and that represents a possible link between mitogen-activated protein kinase and BR response pathways in grain growth.
NA	Natural Variation in OsMKK3 Contributes to Grain Size and Chalkiness in Rice.	2021	Front Plant Sci	Guangxi Key Laboratory of Rice Genetics and Breeding, Rice Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanning, China.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important staple food crop for more than half of the world&#39;s population. Enhancing the grain quality and yield of rice to meet growing demand remains a major challenge. Here, we show that OsMKK3 encode a MAP kinase kinase that controls grain size and chalkiness by affecting cell proliferation in spikelet hulls. We showed that OsSPL16, GS5, and GIF1 have a substantial effect on the OsMKK3-regulated grain size pathway. OsMKK3 has experienced strong directional selection in indica and japonica. Wild rice accessions contained four OsMKK3 haplotypes, suggesting that the OsMKK3 haplotypes present in cultivated rice likely originated from different wild rice accessions during rice domestication. OsMKK3-Hap1, gs3, and gw8 were polymerized to enhance the grain length. Polymerization of beneficial alleles, such as OsMKK3-Hap1, gs3, gw8, fgr, alk, chalk5, and wx, also improved the quality of hybrid rice. Overall, the results indicated that beneficial OsMKK3 alleles could be used for genomic-assisted breeding for rice cultivar improvement and be polymerized with other beneficial alleles.
NA	Editing of rice (Oryza sativa L.) OsMKK3 gene using CRISPR/Cas9 decreases grain length by modulating the expression of photosystem components.	2023	Proteomics	Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences/Guangxi Key Laboratory of Rice Genetics and Breeding, Rice Research Institute, Nanning, China.	Grain size is one of the most important agronomic traits for grain yield determination in rice. To better understand the proteins that are regulated by the grain size regulatory gene OsMKK3, this gene was knocked out using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling combined with liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed to study the regulation of proteins in the panicle. Quantitative proteomic screening revealed a total of 106 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) via comparison of the OsMKK3 mutant line to the wild-type YexiangB, including 15 and 91 up-regulated and down-regulated DEPs, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed that DEPs were enriched in metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and photosynthesis. Strong interactions were detected among seven down-regulated proteins related to photosystem components in the protein-protein interaction network, and photosynthetic rate was decreased in mutant plants. The results of the liquid chromatography-parallel reaction monitoring/mass spectromery analysis and western blot analysis were consistent with the results of the proteomic analysis, and the results of the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression levels of most candidate genes were consistent with protein levels. Overall, OsMKK3 controls grain size by regulating the protein content in cells. Our findings provide new candidate genes that will aid the study of grain size regulatory mechanisms associated with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.
