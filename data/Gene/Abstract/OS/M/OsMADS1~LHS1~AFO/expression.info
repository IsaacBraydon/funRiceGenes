OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	 Gene expression profiling further identified that OsMADS1 regulates expression of OsMADS17, and affects other genes involved in floral identity and hormone signaling
OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	 Combining expression data from OsMADS1 knockdown florets with these DNA binding data, a snapshot of a gene regulatory network was deduced where targets, such as AP2/ERF and bHLH transcription factors and chromatin remodelers form nodes |  We show that the expression status of these nodal factors can be altered by inducing the OsMADS1-GR fusion protein and present a model for a regulatory cascade where the direct targets of OsMADS1, OsbHLH108/SPT, OsERF034 and OsHSF24, in turn control genes such as OsMADS32 and OsYABBY5
OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	 Quantitative PCR analysis indicated that OsLG3b expression was higher during the panicle and seed development stages
