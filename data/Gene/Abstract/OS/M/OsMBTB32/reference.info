MATH-BTB proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes that regulate cell homeostasis and developmental processes. Previous studies reported the involvement of BTB proteins in the development of various organs in plants; however, the function of BTB proteins in salt stress is less studied. Here, we found a novel MATH-BTB domain-containing OsMBTB32 protein that was highly expressed in leaf, root, and shoot. The up-regulation of the OsMBTB32 transcript in 2-week-old seedlings under salt stress suggests the significant role of the OsMBTB32 gene in salinity. The OsMBTB32 transgenic seedlings (OE and RNAi) exhibited significant differences in various phenotypes, including plumule, radical, primary root, and shoot length, compared to WT seedlings. We further found that OsCUL1 proteins, particularly OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-3, interact with OsMBTB32 and may suppress the function of OsMBTB32 during salt stress. Moreover, OsWRKY42, a homolog of ZmWRKY114 which negatively regulates salt stress in rice, directly binds to the W-box of OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-3 promoters to promote the interaction of OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-3 with OsMBTB32 protein in rice. The overexpression of OsMBTB32 and OsCUL1-3 further confirmed the function of OsMBTB32 and OsCUL1s in salt tolerance in Arabidopsis. Overall, the findings of the present study provide promising knowledge regarding the MATH-BTB domain-containing proteins and their role in enhancing the growth and development of rice under salt stress.MATH-BTB proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes that regulate cell homeostasis and developmental processes.
