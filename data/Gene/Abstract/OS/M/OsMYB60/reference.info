NA	A novel antisense long noncoding RNA, TWISTED LEAF, maintains leaf blade flattening by regulating its associated sense R2R3-MYB gene in rice.	2018	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Natural antisense long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are widespread in many organisms. However, their biological functions remain largely unknown, particularly in plants. We report the identification and characterization of an endogenous lncRNA, TWISTED LEAF (TL), which is transcribed from the opposite strand of the R2R3 MYB transcription factor gene locus, OsMYB60, in rice (Oryza sativa). TL and OsMYB60 were found to be coexpressed in many different tissues, and the expression level of TL was higher than that of OsMYB60. Downregulation of TL by RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression of OsMYB60 resulted in twisted leaf blades in transgenic rice. The expression level of OsMYB60 was significantly increased in TL-RNAi transgenic plants. This suggests that TL may play a cis-regulatory role on OsMYB60 in leaf morphological development. We also determined that the antisense transcription suppressed the sense gene expression by mediating chromatin modifications. We further discovered that a C2H2 transcription factor, OsZFP7, is an OsMYB60 binding partner and involved in leaf development. Taken together, these findings reveal that the cis-natural antisense lncRNA plays a critical role in maintaining leaf blade flattening in rice. Our study uncovers a regulatory mechanism of lncRNA in plant leaf development.
NA	Mutation of OsMYB60 reduces rice resilience to drought stress by attenuating cuticular wax biosynthesis.	2022	Plant J	Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Bioresources, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, 08826, Seoul, Republic of Korea.	The cuticular wax layer on leaf surfaces limits non-stomatal water loss to the atmosphere and protects against pathogen invasion. Although many genes associated with wax biosynthesis and wax transport in plants have been identified, their regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the MYB transcription factor OsMYB60 positively regulates cuticular wax biosynthesis and this helps rice (Oryza sativa) plants tolerate drought stress. Compared with the wild type (japonica cultivar &#x27;Dongjin&#x27;), osmyb60 null mutants (osmyb60-1 and osmyb60-2) exhibited increased drought sensitivity, with higher chlorophyll leaching and faster rates of water loss. Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR showed that the loss-of-function of OsMYB60 led to downregulation of wax biosynthetic genes, leading to reduced amounts of total wax components on leaf surfaces under normal conditions. Yeast one-hybrid, luciferase transient transcriptional activity, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that OsMYB60 directly binds to the promoter of OsCER1 (a key gene involved in very-long-chain alkane biosynthesis) and upregulates its expression. Taken together, these results demonstrate that OsMYB60 contributes to enhancing rice resilience to drought stress by promoting cuticular wax biosynthesis on leaf surfaces.
