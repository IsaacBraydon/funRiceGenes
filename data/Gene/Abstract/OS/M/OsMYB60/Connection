OsCER1|OsGL1-4	OsMYB60	Mutation of OsMYB60 reduces rice resilience to drought stress by attenuating cuticular wax biosynthesis.	 Yeast one-hybrid, luciferase transient transcriptional activity, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that OsMYB60 directly binds to the promoter of OsCER1 (a key gene involved in very-long-chain alkane biosynthesis) and upregulates its expression
