OsMsr9	 Overexpression of OsMsr9 in Arabidopsis and rice showed enhanced salt stress tolerance displaying increased shoot and root elongation, higher survival rates in transgenic plants compared with wild type |  OsMsr9 might act as a positive regulator of plant salt tolerance with reinforced expression of stress-related genes, such as RD29A, DREB2A and RAB18 in transgenic plants under salt conditions	 Overexpression of OsMsr9 in Arabidopsis and rice showed enhanced salt stress tolerance displaying increased shoot and root elongation, higher survival rates in transgenic plants compared with wild type
OsMsr9|OsFBX257	 OsFBX257 expression level modulates root architecture and drought stress tolerance in rice |  In contrast, its overexpression (OsFBX257(OE) ) increases root depth, leaf and grain length, number of panicles, and grain yield in rice	 In contrast, its overexpression (OsFBX257(OE) ) increases root depth, leaf and grain length, number of panicles, and grain yield in rice
