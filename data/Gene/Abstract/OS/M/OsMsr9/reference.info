NA	OsMsr9, a novel putative rice F-box containing protein, confers enhanced salt tolerance in transgenic rice and Arabidopsis	2014	Molecular Breeding	Key Laboratory for Agro-Ecological Process in Subtropical Region, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changsha 410125, Hunan, China	Salinity is a major environmental stress that limits agricultural production and geographical distribution of plants. In a previous study, it has been shown that OsMsr9 was induced by cold, drought and heat stresses. However, functions of OsMsr9 at physiological and molecular levels are still unknown. Here, we report that OsMsr9 plays roles in salt tolerance in plants. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that OsMsr9 was also rapidly and strongly induced by salt stress. Overexpression of OsMsr9 in Arabidopsis and rice showed enhanced salt stress tolerance displaying increased shoot and root elongation, higher survival rates in transgenic plants compared with wild type. OsMsr9 might act as a positive regulator of plant salt tolerance with reinforced expression of stress-related genes, such as RD29A, DREB2A and RAB18 in transgenic plants under salt conditions. Furthermore, transgenic plants accumulated more compatible solutes (proline and soluble sugar) and low level of malondialdehyde, alleviating the changes in reactive oxygen species. These results indicate that OsMsr9 could be a useful gene in developing transgenic crops with enhanced salt tolerance.
NA	Stress-induced F-Box protein-coding gene OsFBX257 modulates drought stress adaptations and ABA responses in rice.	2022	Plant Cell Environ	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics &amp; Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, India.	F-box (FB) proteins that form part of SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF) type of E3 ubiquitin ligases are important components of plant growth and development. Here we characterized OsFBX257, a rice FB protein-coding gene that is differentially expressed under drought conditions and other abiotic stresses. Population genomics analysis suggest that OsFBX257 shows high allelic diversity in aus accessions and has been under positive selection in some japonica, aromatic and indica cultivars. Interestingly, allelic variation at OsFBX257 in aus cultivar Nagina22 is associated with an alternatively spliced transcript. Conserved among land plants, OsFBX257 is a component of the SCF complex, can form homomers and interact molecularly with the 14-3-3 rice proteins GF14b and GF14c. OsFBX257 is co-expressed in a network involving protein kinases and phosphatases. We show that OsFBX257 can bind the kinases OsCDPK1 and OsSAPK2, and that its phosphorylation can be reversed by phosphatase OsPP2C08. OsFBX257 expression level modulates root architecture and drought stress tolerance in rice. OsFBX257 knockdown (OsFBX257(KD) ) lines show reduced total root length and depth, crown root number, panicle size and survival under stress. In contrast, its overexpression (OsFBX257(OE) ) increases root depth, leaf and grain length, number of panicles, and grain yield in rice. OsFBX257 is a promising breeding target for alleviating drought stress-induced damage in rice.
