NA	Potential Application of the Oryza sativa Monodehydroascorbate Reductase Gene (OsMDHAR) to Improve the Stress Tolerance and Fermentative Capacity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	2016	PLoS One	School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.	Monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR; EC 1.6.5.4) is an important enzyme for ascorbate recycling. To examine whether heterologous expression of MDHAR from Oryza sativa (OsMDHAR) can prevent the deleterious effects of unfavorable growth conditions, we constructed a transgenic yeast strain harboring a recombinant plasmid carrying OsMDHAR (p426GPD::OsMDHAR). OsMDHAR-expressing yeast cells displayed enhanced tolerance to hydrogen peroxide by maintaining redox homoeostasis, proteostasis, and the ascorbate (AsA)-like pool following the accumulation of antioxidant enzymes and molecules, metabolic enzymes, and molecular chaperones and their cofactors, compared to wild-type (WT) cells carrying vector alone. The addition of exogenous AsA or its analogue isoascorbic acid increased the viability of WT and ara2Δ cells under oxidative stress. Furthermore, the survival of OsMDHAR-expressing cells was greater than that of WT cells when cells at mid-log growth phase were exposed to high concentrations of ethanol. High OsMDHAR expression also improved the fermentative capacity of the yeast during glucose-based batch fermentation at a standard cultivation temperature (30°C). The alcohol yield of OsMDHAR-expressing transgenic yeast during fermentation was approximately 25% (0.18 g·g-1) higher than that of WT yeast. Accordingly, OsMDHAR-expressing transgenic yeast showed prolonged survival during the environmental stresses produced during fermentation. These results suggest that heterologous OsMDHAR expression increases tolerance to reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative stress by improving cellular redox homeostasis and improves survival during fermentation, which enhances fermentative capacity.
NA	Structure and catalytic mechanism of monodehydroascorbate reductase, MDHAR, from Oryza sativa L. japonica.	2016	Sci Rep	Division of Polar Life Sciences, Korea Polar Research Institute, Incheon 21990, Republic of Korea.	Ascorbic acid (AsA) maintains redox homeostasis by scavenging reactive oxygen species from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, especially plants. The enzyme monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) regenerates AsA by catalysing the reduction of monodehydroascorbate, using NADH or NADPH as an electron donor. The detailed recycling mechanism of MDHAR remains unclear due to lack of structural information. Here, we present the crystal structures of MDHAR in the presence of cofactors, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP(+)), and complexed with AsA as well as its analogue, isoascorbic acid (ISD). The overall structure of MDHAR is similar to other iron-sulphur protein reductases, except for a unique long loop of 63-80 residues, which seems to be essential in forming the active site pocket. From the structural analysis and structure-guided point mutations, we found that the Arg320 residue plays a major substrate binding role, and the Tyr349 residue mediates electron transfer from NAD(P)H to bound substrate via FAD. The enzymatic activity of MDHAR favours NADH as an electron donor over NADPH. Our results show, for the first time, structural insights into this preference. The MDHAR-ISD complex structure revealed an alternative binding conformation of ISD, compared with the MDHAR-AsA complex. This implies a broad substrate (antioxidant) specificity and resulting greater protective ability of MDHAR.
