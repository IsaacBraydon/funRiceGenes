Osmyb3|SG3	 SG3 overexpression and knockdown plants showed shortened and elongated grains, respectively, which demonstrated that SG3 acts as a negative regulator of grain length	 SG3 overexpression and knockdown plants showed shortened and elongated grains, respectively, which demonstrated that SG3 acts as a negative regulator of grain length
Osmyb3|SG3|SMG3	 Overexpression of SMG3 in rice produces a phenotype with more grains but reduces grain length and weight	 Overexpression of SMG3 in rice produces a phenotype with more grains but reduces grain length and weight
Osmyb3|SG3|SMG3	 Loss of function of SMG3 or DGS1 results in small grains, while overexpression of SMG3 or DGS1 leads to long grains	 Loss of function of SMG3 or DGS1 results in small grains, while overexpression of SMG3 or DGS1 leads to long grains
