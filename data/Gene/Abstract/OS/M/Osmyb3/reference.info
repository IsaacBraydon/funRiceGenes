Three elements in the promoter of rice glutelin genes are important for their endosperm specific expression. One of these, an AACA motif, has been shown to be a negative regulator in non-seed tissues and has a similarity to the barley gibberellin responsive element recognized by MYB-like DNA binding proteins. A cDNA library constructed from immature rice seed was screened using two types of myb gene probes to isolate cDNA clones representing genes encoding MYB-like DNA binding proteins that may recognize the AACA motif in rice glutelin gene promoter. We obtained four cDNA clones encoding MYB-related proteins, Oryza sativa MYB (OSMYB) 1-4, using the maize C1 probe. Another myb-like clone, Osmyb5, was obtained by screening a rice seed cDNA library with probes designed to recognize the AACA-like binding domain in GAMYB and PHMYB3. RT-PCR was used to analyze Osmyb expression during rice seed development and their presence in other rice tissues, as it was not possible to detect these mRNAs by conventional Northern analysis. RT-PCR analysis showed that Osmyb2, Osmyb3 and Osmyb5 genes were expressed in all tissues examined. In seed, the mRNA levels of Osmyb1 and Osmyb4 genes reached a maximum at 14 days after flowering (DAF), suggesting that these genes may play a role in seed maturation. As Osmyb5 exhibits a high similarity to the regions in both GAMYB and PHMYB3, which can bind to the AACA motif, there is a possibility that the OSMYB5 protein may bind to the AACA motif of glutelin genes.
NA	A minor QTL, SG3, encoding an R2R3-MYB protein, negatively controls grain length in rice.	2020	Theor Appl Genet.	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agriculture University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	SG3, an R2R3 MYB protein coding gene that tightly linked to a major QTLGS3, negatively regulates grain length while dependent on the status ofGS3in rice. It is often very difficult to isolate a minor QTL that is closely linked to a major QTL in rice. In this study, we focused on the isolation of a minor grain length QTL, small grain 3 (SG3), which is closely linked to the major QTL grain size 3 (GS3). The genetic effect of SG3 on grain length was dependent on GS3 status. Its genetic effect was larger in the presence of nonfunctional sg3 than functional SG3. A large number of near-isogenic F2 plants in which GS3 was fixed with nonfunctional alleles were developed to clone SG3. A gene encoding an R2R3 MYB domain transcriptional regulator was identified as the candidate gene for SG3. SG3 overexpression and knockdown plants showed shortened and elongated grains, respectively, which demonstrated that SG3 acts as a negative regulator of grain length. SG3 was preferentially expressed in panicles after flowering, and SG3 acted as a transcription activator. Comparative sequencing analysis identified a 12-bp insertion in the third exon of NYZ that led to a frameshift and resulted in a premature stop codon. The insertion/deletion was associated with grain length in the presence of functional GS3 in the indica subspecies. SG3 and GS3 were frequently in coupling phase in indica rice, making them good targets for the breeding of cultivars with short or long grains. The isolation of the SG3 MYB gene provides new gene resource and contributes to the regulatory network of grain length in rice.
NA	Bin-based genome-wide association studies reveal superior alleles for improvement of appearance quality using a 4-way MAGIC population in rice	2020	J Adv Res	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agriculture University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Introduction: The multiparental population provides us the chance to identify superior alleles controlling a trait for genetic improvement. Genome wide association studies at bin level (bin-GWAS) are expected to be more power in QTL mapping than GWAS at SNP level (SNP-GWAS).  Objectives: This study is to estimate genetic effects of QTL conferring grain appearance quality in rice by SNP-GWAS and bin-GWAS, compare their power in QTL mapping and identify the superior alleles of all detected QTL from 4 parents for genetic improvement.  Methods: A 4-way MAGIC population and its four founders were cultivated in two environments to dissect the genetic basis of rice grain appearance quality. Both SNP-GWAS and bin-GWAS were conducted for QTL mapping. Multiple comparison among 4 parental bin/alleles was used to identify the superior alleles.  Results: A total of 16 and 20 QTL associated with grain appearance quality were identified by SNP- and bin-GWAS, respectively. A minor chalkiness QTL qPGWC8.2/qDEC8 was assigned to a 30-kb genomic region, in which OsMH_08T0121900 is the potential candidate gene because its encoded protein, glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase precursor is involved in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway. The superior parental alleles for GS3, GL3.1, GW5, GW7, and Chalk5 and two QTLs were almost carried by the high-quality parents Cypress and Yuejingsimiao (YJSM), while the poor-quality parent Guichao-2 (GC2) always carried the inferior alleles. The top five recombinant inbred lines with the highest quality of grain shape and chalkiness traits all carried gene combinations of superior alleles.  Conclusions: Both SNP- and bin-GWAS methods are encouraged for joint QTL mapping with MAGIC population. qPGWC8.2/qDEC8 is a novel candidate gene strongly associated with chalkiness. The superior alleles of GS3, GW5, GL3.1, GW7, Chalk5 and qPGWC8.2 were identified, and the pyramiding of these superior alleles is helpful to improve rice appearance quality.
