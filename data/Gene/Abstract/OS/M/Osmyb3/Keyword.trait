Osmyb3|SG3|SMG3	grain	A minor QTL, SG3, encoding an R2R3-MYB protein, negatively controls grain length in rice.	 The genetic effect of SG3 on grain length was dependent on GS3 status
Osmyb3|SG3|SMG3	grain	A minor QTL, SG3, encoding an R2R3-MYB protein, negatively controls grain length in rice.	 SG3 overexpression and knockdown plants showed shortened and elongated grains, respectively, which demonstrated that SG3 acts as a negative regulator of grain length
Osmyb3|SG3|SMG3	grain	A minor QTL, SG3, encoding an R2R3-MYB protein, negatively controls grain length in rice.	 The isolation of the SG3 MYB gene provides new gene resource and contributes to the regulatory network of grain length in rice
Osmyb3|SG3|SMG3	grain length	A minor QTL, SG3, encoding an R2R3-MYB protein, negatively controls grain length in rice.	 The genetic effect of SG3 on grain length was dependent on GS3 status
Osmyb3|SG3|SMG3	grain length	A minor QTL, SG3, encoding an R2R3-MYB protein, negatively controls grain length in rice.	 SG3 overexpression and knockdown plants showed shortened and elongated grains, respectively, which demonstrated that SG3 acts as a negative regulator of grain length
Osmyb3|SG3|SMG3	grain length	A minor QTL, SG3, encoding an R2R3-MYB protein, negatively controls grain length in rice.	 The isolation of the SG3 MYB gene provides new gene resource and contributes to the regulatory network of grain length in rice
Osmyb3|SG3|SMG3	breeding	A minor QTL, SG3, encoding an R2R3-MYB protein, negatively controls grain length in rice.	 SG3 and GS3 were frequently in coupling phase in indica rice, making them good targets for the breeding of cultivars with short or long grains
Osmyb3|SG3|SMG3	transcriptional regulator	A minor QTL, SG3, encoding an R2R3-MYB protein, negatively controls grain length in rice.	 A gene encoding an R2R3 MYB domain transcriptional regulator was identified as the candidate gene for SG3
Osmyb3|SG3|SMG3	transcription activator	A minor QTL, SG3, encoding an R2R3-MYB protein, negatively controls grain length in rice.	 SG3 was preferentially expressed in panicles after flowering, and SG3 acted as a transcription activator
