Osmyb3|SG3	Osmyb5	Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed	RT-PCR analysis showed that Osmyb2, Osmyb3 and Osmyb5 genes were expressed in all tissues examined
Osmyb3|SG3	Osmyb5	Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed	Another myb-like clone, Osmyb5, was obtained by screening a rice seed cDNA library with probes designed to recognize the AACA-like binding domain in GAMYB and PHMYB3
Osmyb3|SG3	Osmyb5	Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed	As Osmyb5 exhibits a high similarity to the regions in both GAMYB and PHMYB3, which can bind to the AACA motif, there is a possibility that the OSMYB5 protein may bind to the AACA motif of glutelin genes
Osmyb2	Osmyb3|SG3	Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed	RT-PCR analysis showed that Osmyb2, Osmyb3 and Osmyb5 genes were expressed in all tissues examined
GS3	Osmyb3|SG3	A minor QTL, SG3, encoding an R2R3-MYB protein, negatively controls grain length in rice.	 In this study, we focused on the isolation of a minor grain length QTL, small grain 3 (SG3), which is closely linked to the major QTL grain size 3 (GS3)
GS3	Osmyb3|SG3	A minor QTL, SG3, encoding an R2R3-MYB protein, negatively controls grain length in rice.	 The genetic effect of SG3 on grain length was dependent on GS3 status
GS3	Osmyb3|SG3	A minor QTL, SG3, encoding an R2R3-MYB protein, negatively controls grain length in rice.	 A large number of near-isogenic F2 plants in which GS3 was fixed with nonfunctional alleles were developed to clone SG3
GS3	Osmyb3|SG3	A minor QTL, SG3, encoding an R2R3-MYB protein, negatively controls grain length in rice.	 SG3 and GS3 were frequently in coupling phase in indica rice, making them good targets for the breeding of cultivars with short or long grains
