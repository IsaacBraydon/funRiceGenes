OsMCM2	seed	Identification and characterization of a rice MCM2 homologue required for DNA replycation	We found OsMCM2 transcript expression in roots, leaves, and seeds, although expression levels differed slightly among the organs
OsMCM2	root	Identification and characterization of a rice MCM2 homologue required for DNA replycation	We found OsMCM2 transcript expression in roots, leaves, and seeds, although expression levels differed slightly among the organs
OsMCM2	cell cycle	Identification and characterization of a rice MCM2 homologue required for DNA replycation	Likewise, the OsMCM2 protein was ubiquitously expressed, but it was downregulated when nutritients were limiting, indicating that MCM2 expression (and therefore cell cycle progression) requires adequate nutrition
