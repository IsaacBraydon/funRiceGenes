OsLFL1	OsMADS56|GL10	OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice	These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in regulating LD-dependent flowering
OsMADS50|OsSOC1|DTH3	OsMADS56|GL10	OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice	Here, we report the functional analysis of OsMADS50 and its closely related gene OsMADS56
OsMADS50|OsSOC1|DTH3	OsMADS56|GL10	OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice	These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in regulating LD-dependent flowering
OsMADS50|OsSOC1|DTH3	OsMADS56|GL10	OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice	These results suggest that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 may form a complex that regulates downstream target genes
OsMADS50|OsSOC1|DTH3	OsMADS56|GL10	OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice	OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice
Ehd1	OsMADS56|GL10	OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice	These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in regulating LD-dependent flowering
Hd18	OsMADS56|GL10	Hd18, encoding histone acetylase related to Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS D, is involved in the control of flowering time in rice.	We revealed that Hd18 acts as an accelerator in the rice-flowering pathway under both short- and long-day conditions by elevating transcription levels of Ehd1 Gene expression analysis also suggested the involvement of MADS-box genes such as OsMADS50, OsMADS51, and OsMADS56 in the Hd18-associated regulation of Ehd1 These results suggest that, like FLD, its rice homolog accelerates flowering time but is involved in rice flowering pathways that differ from the autonomous pathways in Arabidopsis
LFS	OsMADS56|GL10	The AP2/ERF transcription factor LATE FLOWERING SEMI-DWARF suppresses long-day-dependent repression of flowering.	 LFS did not affect the expression of other OsLFL1 regulators, including OsMADS50, OsMADS56, VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE3-LIKE 2, and GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, or interact with them
