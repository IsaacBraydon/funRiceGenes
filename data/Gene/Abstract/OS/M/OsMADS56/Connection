Hd18	OsMADS56|GL10	Hd18, encoding histone acetylase related to Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS D, is involved in the control of flowering time in rice.	We revealed that Hd18 acts as an accelerator in the rice-flowering pathway under both short- and long-day conditions by elevating transcription levels of Ehd1 Gene expression analysis also suggested the involvement of MADS-box genes such as OsMADS50, OsMADS51, and OsMADS56 in the Hd18-associated regulation of Ehd1 These results suggest that, like FLD, its rice homolog accelerates flowering time but is involved in rice flowering pathways that differ from the autonomous pathways in Arabidopsis
LFS	OsMADS56|GL10	The AP2/ERF transcription factor LATE FLOWERING SEMI-DWARF suppresses long-day-dependent repression of flowering.	 LFS did not affect the expression of other OsLFL1 regulators, including OsMADS50, OsMADS56, VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE3-LIKE 2, and GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, or interact with them
OsMADS56|GL10	RIFLA	Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.	), RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), is required for the inhibition of OsMADS56 expression
OsMADS56|GL10	RIFLA	Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.	 RIFLA is produced from the first intron of the OsMADS56 gene
OsMADS56|GL10	RIFLA	Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.	 Overexpression of RIFLA in rice repressed OsMADS56 expression but activated the expression of flowering inducers Hd3a and RFT1
OsMADS56|GL10	RIFLA	Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.	 Under normal conditions, the transcript level of the rice enhancer of zeste gene OsiEZ1, a homolog of Arabidopsis histone H3K27-specific methyltransferase genes SWINGER (SWN) and CURLY LEAF (CLF), was as low as that of RIFLA, whereas the transcript level of OsMADS56 was relatively high
OsMADS56|GL10	RIFLA	Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.	 In the osiez1 mutant, OsMADS56 expression was upregulated, whereas RIFLA expression was downregulated
OsMADS56|GL10	RIFLA	Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.	 Together, these results suggest that the floral repressor activity of OsMADS56 is epigenetically regulated by RIFLA and OsiEZ1
