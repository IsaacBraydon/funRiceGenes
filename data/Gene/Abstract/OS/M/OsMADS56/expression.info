OsMADS56	 Using OsMADS56 knock-out mutants and overexpression transgenic plants, OsMADS56 was validated as the causal gene for qTGW10-20 |  In these populations, decreased grain weight and size were associated with a reduction in the expression of OsMADS56	 Using OsMADS56 knock-out mutants and overexpression transgenic plants, OsMADS56 was validated as the causal gene for qTGW10-20
OsMADS56|GL10	 The knockout of GL10 in the HJX74 background leads to grain phenotypes similar to that of NIL-gl10, while overexpression of GL10 results in increased grain length and weight and earlier heading date	 The knockout of GL10 in the HJX74 background leads to grain phenotypes similar to that of NIL-gl10, while overexpression of GL10 results in increased grain length and weight and earlier heading date
