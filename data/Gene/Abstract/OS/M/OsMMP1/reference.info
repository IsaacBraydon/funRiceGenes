NA	Rice matrix metalloproteinase OsMMP1 plays pleiotropic roles in plant development and symplastic-apoplastic transport by modulating cellulose and callose depositions.	2018	Sci Rep	Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, 721302, India.	Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are well-known proteolytic enzymes in animal systems and play roles in tissue differentiation, growth, and defence. Although a few plant MMPs have been reported, their exact functions in development and growth remain elusive. In this study, we characterized the promoter and coding sequence of OsMMP1, one of the putative MMP genes in rice (Oryza sativa). The OsMMP1 catalytic domain is structurally similar to human MMPs with respect to cofactor orientation as predicted by homology modeling. Bacterially expressed recombinant OsMMP1 showed protease activity with bovine serum albumin and gelatin as substrates. Analyses of transcript accumulation and promoter-reporter gene expression revealed that OsMMP1 is spatio-temporally expressed in vegetative and reproductive parts of plants. The plasma membrane-localized OsMMP1 protease affected plant development upon heterologous expression in tobacco and endogenous gene silencing in rice. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing OsMMP1 showed enhanced deposition of cellulose and callose, leading to impairment of symplastic and apoplastic translocations. Moreover, transgenic tobacco tissues exhibited tolerance to oxidative stress-inducing agent by confining the area of tissue death owing to callose lining. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the involvement of a plant MMP in growth, organ differentiation, and development in relation to cell wall modification.
