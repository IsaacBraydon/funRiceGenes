OsMTA2	methyltransferase	The subunit of RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase OsFIP regulates early degeneration of microspores in rice.	 In this study, we reported that OsFIP and OsMTA2 are the components of m6A RNA methyltransferase complex in rice and uncovered a previously unknown function of m6A RNA methylation in regulation of plant sporogenesis
