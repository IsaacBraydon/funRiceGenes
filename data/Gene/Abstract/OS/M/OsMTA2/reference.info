NA	The subunit of RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase OsFIP regulates early degeneration of microspores in rice.	2019	PLoS Genet	Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, P. R. China.	N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation plays important roles during development in different species. However, knowledge of m6A RNA methylation in monocots remains limited. In this study, we reported that OsFIP and OsMTA2 are the components of m6A RNA methyltransferase complex in rice and uncovered a previously unknown function of m6A RNA methylation in regulation of plant sporogenesis. Importantly, OsFIP is essential for rice male gametogenesis. Knocking out of OsFIP results in early degeneration of microspores at the vacuolated pollen stage and simultaneously causes abnormal meiosis in prophase I. We further analyzed the profile of rice m6A modification during sporogenesis in both WT and OsFIP loss-of-function plants, and identified a rice panicle specific m6A modification motif &quot;UGWAMH&quot;. Interestingly, we found that OsFIP directly mediates the m6A methylation of a set of threonine protease and NTPase mRNAs and is essential for their expression and/or splicing, which in turn regulates the progress of sporogenesis. Our findings revealed for the first time that OsFIP plays an indispensable role in plant early sporogenesis. This study also provides evidence for the different functions of the m6A RNA methyltransferase complex between rice and Arabidopsis.
NA	OseIF3h Regulates Plant Growth and Pollen Development at Translational Level Presumably through Interaction with OsMTA2	2021	Plants (Basel)	Institute of Crop Science, Zhejiang University, Yu-Hang-Tang Road No 866, Hangzhou 310058, China.	The initiation stage of protein biosynthesis is a sophisticated process tightly regulated by numerous initiation factors and their associated components. However, the mechanism underlying translation initiation has not been completely understood in rice. Here, we showed knock-out mutation of the rice eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit h (OseIF3h) resulted in plant growth retardation and seed-setting rate reduction as compared to the wild type. Further investigation demonstrated an interaction between OseIF3h and OsMTA2 (mRNA adenosine methylase 2), a rice homolog of METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3) in mammals, which provided new insight into how N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of messenger RNA (mRNA) is engaged in the translation initiation process in monocot species. Moreover, the RIP-seq (RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing) data suggested that OseIF3h was involved in multiple biological processes, including photosynthesis, cellular metabolic process, precursor metabolites, and energy generation. Therefore, we infer that OseIF3h interacts with OsMTA2 to target a particular subset of genes at translational level, regulating plant growth and pollen development.
