OsFIP	OsMTA2	The subunit of RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase OsFIP regulates early degeneration of microspores in rice	In this study, we reported that OsFIP and OsMTA2 are the components of m6A RNA methyltransferase complex in rice and uncovered a previously unknown function of m6A RNA methylation in regulation of plant sporogenesis.
OseIF3h	OsMTA2	OseIF3h Regulates Plant Growth and Pollen Development at Translational Level Presumably through Interaction with OsMTA2	OseIF3h Regulates Plant Growth and Pollen Development at Translational Level Presumably through Interaction with OsMTA2
OseIF3h	OsMTA2	OseIF3h Regulates Plant Growth and Pollen Development at Translational Level Presumably through Interaction with OsMTA2	 Further investigation demonstrated an interaction between OseIF3h and OsMTA2 (mRNA adenosine methylase 2), a rice homolog of METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3) in mammals, which provided new insight into how N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of messenger RNA (mRNA) is engaged in the translation initiation process in monocot species
OseIF3h	OsMTA2	OseIF3h Regulates Plant Growth and Pollen Development at Translational Level Presumably through Interaction with OsMTA2	 Therefore, we infer that OseIF3h interacts with OsMTA2 to target a particular subset of genes at translational level, regulating plant growth and pollen development
