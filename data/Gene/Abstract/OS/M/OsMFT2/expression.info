OsMFT2	 OsMFT2 knock-out lines exhibited pre-harvest sprouting, while OsMFT2 overexpression lines showed delayed germination |  RNA expression profiling showed that OsMFT2 was specifically expressed in seeds |  Performance of transgenic plants demonstrated that overexpressing OsbZIP23 rescued the pre-harvest sprouting phenotype and expression decrease of ABA signaling genes caused by OsMFT2 knocking-out	 OsMFT2 knock-out lines exhibited pre-harvest sprouting, while OsMFT2 overexpression lines showed delayed germination
OsMFT2	 Overexpression of OsMFT1 (OsMFT1OE) or OsMFT2 increased the sensitivity to salt stress during seed germination	 Overexpression of OsMFT1 (OsMFT1OE) or OsMFT2 increased the sensitivity to salt stress during seed germination
