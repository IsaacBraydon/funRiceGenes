OsbZIP23	OsMFT2	OsMFT2 is involved in the regulation of ABA signaling-mediated seed germination through interacting with OsbZIP23/66/72 in rice.	 In vivo and in vitro assays showed that three bZIP transcription factors, OsbZIP23, OsbZIP66 and OsbZIP72, interacted with OsMFT2
OsbZIP23	OsMFT2	OsMFT2 is involved in the regulation of ABA signaling-mediated seed germination through interacting with OsbZIP23/66/72 in rice.	 Performance of transgenic plants demonstrated that overexpressing OsbZIP23 rescued the pre-harvest sprouting phenotype and expression decrease of ABA signaling genes caused by OsMFT2 knocking-out
OsbZIP72|OsABF4	OsMFT2	OsMFT2 is involved in the regulation of ABA signaling-mediated seed germination through interacting with OsbZIP23/66/72 in rice.	 In vivo and in vitro assays showed that three bZIP transcription factors, OsbZIP23, OsbZIP66 and OsbZIP72, interacted with OsMFT2
OsMFT2	RAB21|Rab16A|OsRab16A	OsMFT2 is involved in the regulation of ABA signaling-mediated seed germination through interacting with OsbZIP23/66/72 in rice.	 OsbZIP23/66/72 bound to the promoter of Rab16A, a typical ABA responsive element containing gene, and OsMFT2 enhanced their binding activities to Rab16A promoter
OsMFT2	TRAB1|OsbZIP66	OsMFT2 is involved in the regulation of ABA signaling-mediated seed germination through interacting with OsbZIP23/66/72 in rice.	 In vivo and in vitro assays showed that three bZIP transcription factors, OsbZIP23, OsbZIP66 and OsbZIP72, interacted with OsMFT2
