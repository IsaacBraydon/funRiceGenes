OsbZIP23	OsMFT2	OsMFT2 is involved in the regulation of ABA signaling-mediated seed germination through interacting with OsbZIP23/66/72 in rice.	 In vivo and in vitro assays showed that three bZIP transcription factors, OsbZIP23, OsbZIP66 and OsbZIP72, interacted with OsMFT2
OsbZIP23	OsMFT2	OsMFT2 is involved in the regulation of ABA signaling-mediated seed germination through interacting with OsbZIP23/66/72 in rice.	 Performance of transgenic plants demonstrated that overexpressing OsbZIP23 rescued the pre-harvest sprouting phenotype and expression decrease of ABA signaling genes caused by OsMFT2 knocking-out
OsbZIP72|OsABF4	OsMFT2	OsMFT2 is involved in the regulation of ABA signaling-mediated seed germination through interacting with OsbZIP23/66/72 in rice.	 In vivo and in vitro assays showed that three bZIP transcription factors, OsbZIP23, OsbZIP66 and OsbZIP72, interacted with OsMFT2

OsMFT1	OsMFT2	OsMFT1 inhibits seed germination through modulating abscisic acid signaling and gibberellin biosynthesis under salt stress in rice.	 There are two orthologous genes of AtMFT in rice (Oryza sativa), namely OsMFT1 and OsMFT2
OsMFT1	OsMFT2	OsMFT1 inhibits seed germination through modulating abscisic acid signaling and gibberellin biosynthesis under salt stress in rice.	 In this study, we found that seeds of loss-of-function osmft1 mutants germinated faster than wild-type (WT) seeds under salt stress, but this was not the case for loss-of-function osmft2 mutants
OsMFT1	OsMFT2	OsMFT1 inhibits seed germination through modulating abscisic acid signaling and gibberellin biosynthesis under salt stress in rice.	 Overexpression of OsMFT1 (OsMFT1OE) or OsMFT2 increased the sensitivity to salt stress during seed germination
