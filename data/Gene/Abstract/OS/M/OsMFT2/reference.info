NA	OsMFT2 is involved in the regulation of ABA signaling-mediated seed germination through interacting with OsbZIP23/66/72 in rice.	2020	Plant J	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Seed germination is a<U+00A0>complex<U+00A0>process<U+00A0>involving various physical and biochemical cues, which is determined by exogenous and endogenous factors. Here, we identified a gene, OsMFT2, which negatively regulates seed germination in rice. OsMFT2 knock-out lines exhibited pre-harvest sprouting, while OsMFT2 overexpression lines showed delayed germination. RNA expression profiling showed that OsMFT2 was specifically expressed in seeds. Subcellular localization indicated that OsMFT2 was a nuclear protein. Exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatment on imbibed seeds and seedlings indicated that OsMFT2 altered ABA sensitivity during seed germination and post-germination growth. In vivo and in vitro assays showed that three bZIP transcription factors, OsbZIP23, OsbZIP66 and OsbZIP72, interacted with OsMFT2. OsbZIP23/66/72 bound to the promoter of Rab16A, a typical ABA responsive element containing gene, and OsMFT2 enhanced their binding activities to Rab16A promoter. Moreover, several ABA responsive genes were differentially expressed in the imbibed seeds of OsMFT2 transgenic lines and wild-type. Performance of transgenic plants demonstrated that overexpressing OsbZIP23 rescued the pre-harvest sprouting phenotype and expression decrease of ABA signaling genes caused by OsMFT2 knocking-out. All these results demonstrated that OsMFT2 positively regulates ABA response genes through interacting with OsbZIP23/66/72 and functions in seed germination.
NA	Genome-wide association study identifies a gene responsible for temperature-dependent rice germination.	2022	Nat Commun	Institute of Fermentation Sciences, Fukushima University, Fukushima, 960-1248, Japan. hyoshida@agri.fukushima-u.ac.jp.	Environment is an important determinant of agricultural productivity; therefore, crops have been bred with traits adapted to their environment. It is assumed that the physiology of seed germination is optimised for various climatic conditions. Here, to understand the genetic basis underlying seed germination, we conduct a genome-wide association study considering genotype-by-environment interactions on the germination rate of Japanese rice cultivars under different temperature conditions. We find that a 4â€‰bp InDel in one of the 14-3-3 family genes, GF14h, preferentially changes the germination rate of rice under optimum temperature conditions. The GF14h protein constitutes a transcriptional regulatory module with a bZIP-type transcription factor, OREB1, and a florigen-like protein, MOTHER OF FT AND TFL 2, to control the germination rate by regulating abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive genes. The GF14h loss-of-function allele enhances ABA signalling and reduces the germination rate. This allele is found in rice varieties grown in the northern area and in modern cultivars of Japan and China, suggesting that it contributes to the geographical adaptation of rice. This study demonstrates the complicated molecular system involved in the regulation of seed germination in response to temperature, which has allowed rice to be grown in various geographical locations.
NA	OsMFT1 inhibits seed germination through modulating abscisic acid signaling and gibberellin biosynthesis under salt stress in rice.	2023	Plant Cell Physiol	College of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Seed dormancy and germination are regulated by endogenous gene expression as well as hormonal and environmental conditions, such as salinity, which greatly inhibits seed germination. MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (MFT), which encodes a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein, is a key regulator in seed germination of Arabidopsis thaliana. There are two orthologous genes of AtMFT in rice (Oryza sativa), namely OsMFT1 and OsMFT2. However, the functions of these two genes in regulating rice seed germination under salt stress remain unknown. In this study, we found that seeds of loss-of-function osmft1 mutants germinated faster than wild-type (WT) seeds under salt stress, but this was not the case for loss-of-function osmft2 mutants. Overexpression of OsMFT1 (OsMFT1OE) or OsMFT2 increased the sensitivity to salt stress during seed germination. Transcriptome comparisons of osmft1 vs WT in the absence and presence of salt stress yielded several differentially expressed genes, which were associated with salt stress, plant hormone metabolism, and signaling pathways, such as B-BOX ZINC FINGER 6, Oryza sativa bZIP PROTEIN 8, and GIBBERELLIN (GA) 20-oxidase 1. In addition, the sensitivity of OsMFT1OE seeds to GA and osmft1 seeds to ABA during seed germination increased under salt stress. Overall, our results indicate that ABA and GA metabolism and their signaling pathways are regulated by OsMFT1, modulating seed germination in rice under salt stress.
