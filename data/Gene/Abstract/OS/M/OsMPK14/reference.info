An MAPK gene, OsMPK14 (GenBank Accession No. GQ265780) from rice (Oryza sativa L.), was cloned by RT-PCR. The full-length cDNA of OsMPK14 consists of 1660 bp in size, containing an open reading frame of 1629 bp, which encodes a 542-amino-acid polypeptide and has a typical protein kinase domain and a phosphorylation activation motif TDY. Sequence alignment and analysis revealed that OsMPK14 was located on rice chromosome 5, and composed of nine exons and eight introns in the coding region. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression patterns of OsMPK14 in rice shoots and roots under darkness, drought, high salinity, low temperature and abscisic acid treatments. The OsMPK14 mRNA was induced by abscisic acid, low temperature and high salinity, but weakly inhibited by drought. In addition, the expression of OsMPK14 was up-regulated in roots, but down-regulated in shoots by light. The results indicate that OsMPK14 could be implicated in diverse rice stimuli-responsive signaling cascades, and its expression might be regulated by multiple factors.

Both the WRKY transcription factor (TF) and MAP kinases have been shown to regulate gene expression in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. Several reports have shown that WRKY TFs may function downstream of MAPK cascades. Here, we have shown that OsWRKY30 interacted with OsMPK3, OsMPK4, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, OsMPK20-4, and OsMPK20-5, and could be phosphorylated by OsMPK3, OsMPK7, and OsMPK14. Overexpression of OsWRKY30 in rice dramatically increased drought tolerance. Overexpression of OsWRKY30AA, in which all SP (serine residue followed by proline residue) sites were replaced by AP (A, alanine), resulted in no improvement in drought tolerance. In addition, the function of transcriptional activation of OsWRKY30 was impaired after SP was replaced by AP. These results proved that the phosphorylation of OsWRKY30 by MAPKs was crucial in order for OsWRKY30 to perform its biological function.
MPMI-19-0530.pdf	Molecular analysis of the rice MAP kinase gene family in relation to Magnaporthe grisea infection	2006	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Department of Plant Pathology, Program in Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701, USA.	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play a crucial role in plant growth and development as well as biotic and abiotic stress responses. In Arabidopsis, 20 MAPKs have been identified and divided into four major groups. In rice, a monocot model and economically important cereal crop, only five MAPKs were characterized, including three related to the host defense response. In this study, we have identified 17 members of the rice MAPK gene (OsMPK) family through an in silico search of rice genome databases. Based on the phylogenetic analysis and pairwise comparison of Arabidopsis and rice MAPKs, we propose that MAPKs can be divided into six groups. Interestingly, the rice genome contains many more MAPKs with the TDY phosphorylation site (11 members) than with the TEY motif (six members). In contrast, the Arabidopsis genome contains more MAPKs with the TEY motif (12 members) than with the TDY motif (eight members). Upon inoculation with the blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea), nine of 17 OsMPK genes were found to be induced at the mRNA level during either early, late, or both stages of infection. Four of the M. grisea-induced OsMPK genes were associated with host-cell death in the lesion-mimic rice mutant, and eight of them were differentially induced in response to defense signal molecules such as jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, abscisic acid, and ethylene. The genome-wide expression analysis suggests that about half of the rice MAPK genes are associated with pathogen infection and host defense response.
