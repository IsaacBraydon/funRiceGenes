OsMAR1	root	The microtubule-associated RING finger protein 1 (OsMAR1) acts as a negative regulator for salt-stress response through the regulation of OCPI2 (O. sativa chymotrypsin protease inhibitor 2).	 Heterogeneous overexpression of OsMAR1 in Arabidopsis showed retarded root growth compared with that of control plants, and then led to hypersensitivity phenotypes under high salinity stress
OsMAR1	growth	The microtubule-associated RING finger protein 1 (OsMAR1) acts as a negative regulator for salt-stress response through the regulation of OCPI2 (O. sativa chymotrypsin protease inhibitor 2).	 Heterogeneous overexpression of OsMAR1 in Arabidopsis showed retarded root growth compared with that of control plants, and then led to hypersensitivity phenotypes under high salinity stress
OsMAR1	salinity	The microtubule-associated RING finger protein 1 (OsMAR1) acts as a negative regulator for salt-stress response through the regulation of OCPI2 (O. sativa chymotrypsin protease inhibitor 2).	 Heterogeneous overexpression of OsMAR1 in Arabidopsis showed retarded root growth compared with that of control plants, and then led to hypersensitivity phenotypes under high salinity stress
OsMAR1	 ABA 	The microtubule-associated RING finger protein 1 (OsMAR1) acts as a negative regulator for salt-stress response through the regulation of OCPI2 (O. sativa chymotrypsin protease inhibitor 2).	 Herein, we found that a rice gene, OsMAR1 (Oryza sativa microtubule-associated RING finger protein 1), encoding the RING E3 ligase was highly expressed in response to high salinity, water deficit, and ABA treatment
OsMAR1	stress	The microtubule-associated RING finger protein 1 (OsMAR1) acts as a negative regulator for salt-stress response through the regulation of OCPI2 (O. sativa chymotrypsin protease inhibitor 2).	 Heterogeneous overexpression of OsMAR1 in Arabidopsis showed retarded root growth compared with that of control plants, and then led to hypersensitivity phenotypes under high salinity stress
OsMAR1	salinity stress	The microtubule-associated RING finger protein 1 (OsMAR1) acts as a negative regulator for salt-stress response through the regulation of OCPI2 (O. sativa chymotrypsin protease inhibitor 2).	 Heterogeneous overexpression of OsMAR1 in Arabidopsis showed retarded root growth compared with that of control plants, and then led to hypersensitivity phenotypes under high salinity stress
OsMAR1	R protein	The microtubule-associated RING finger protein 1 (OsMAR1) acts as a negative regulator for salt-stress response through the regulation of OCPI2 (O. sativa chymotrypsin protease inhibitor 2).	 Herein, we found that a rice gene, OsMAR1 (Oryza sativa microtubule-associated RING finger protein 1), encoding the RING E3 ligase was highly expressed in response to high salinity, water deficit, and ABA treatment
OsMAR1	ABA	The microtubule-associated RING finger protein 1 (OsMAR1) acts as a negative regulator for salt-stress response through the regulation of OCPI2 (O. sativa chymotrypsin protease inhibitor 2).	 Herein, we found that a rice gene, OsMAR1 (Oryza sativa microtubule-associated RING finger protein 1), encoding the RING E3 ligase was highly expressed in response to high salinity, water deficit, and ABA treatment
OsMAR1	stress response	The microtubule-associated RING finger protein 1 (OsMAR1) acts as a negative regulator for salt-stress response through the regulation of OCPI2 (O. sativa chymotrypsin protease inhibitor 2).	 Taken together, OsMAR1 negatively regulates the salt-stress response via the regulation of the OCPI2 protein in rice
