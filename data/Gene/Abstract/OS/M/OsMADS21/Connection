OsMADS13	OsMADS21	Functional analysis of all AGAMOUS subfamily members in rice reveals their roles in reproductive organ identity determination and meristem determinacy	 Here, we investigate the genetic interactions between the four rice (Oryza sativa) AG subfamily members, MADS3, MADS13, MADS21, and MADS58
OsMADS13	OsMADS21	The D-lineage MADS-box gene OsMADS13 controls ovule identity in rice	 OsMADS21 is most likely to be a paralog of OsMADS13, although its expression is not restricted to ovules
OsMADS13	OsMADS21	The D-lineage MADS-box gene OsMADS13 controls ovule identity in rice	 Furthermore, combining the osmads13 and the osmads21 mutants did not result in any additive ovule defect, indicating that osmads21 does not control ovule identity
