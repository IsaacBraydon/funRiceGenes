Imparting cold stress tolerance to crops is a major challenge in subtropical agriculture. New genes conferring cold tolerance needs to be identified and characterised for sustainable crop production in low-temperature stress affected areas. Here we report functional characterisation of OsRBGD3, classified previously as a class D glycine-rich RNA recognition motif (RRM) containing proteins from a drought-tolerant Indica rice cultivar N22. The gene was isolated by screening yeast one-hybrid library using the minimal promoter region of the OsMYB38 that is necessary for cold stress-responsive expression. OsRBGD3 exhibited cold, drought and salt stress inductive expression in a drought tolerant N22 rice cultivar as compared with susceptible variety IR64. OsRBGD3 was found to be localised to both nuclear and cytoplasmic subcellular destinations. Constitutive overexpression of the OsRBGD3 in transgenic Arabidopsis conferred tolerance to cold stress. ABA sensitivity was also observed in transgenic lines suggesting the regulatory role of this gene in the ABA signalling pathway. OsRBGD3 overexpression also attributed to significant root development and early flowering in transgenics. Hence, OsRBGD3 could be an important target for developing cold tolerant early flowering rice and other crops&#39; genotypes for increasing production in low temperature affected areas.
