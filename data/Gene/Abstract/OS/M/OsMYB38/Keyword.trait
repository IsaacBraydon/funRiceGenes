OsMYB38	cold stress	Heterologous expression of rice RNA-binding glycine-rich (RBG) gene OsRBGD3 in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana confers cold stress tolerance.	 The gene was isolated by screening yeast one-hybrid library using the minimal promoter region of the OsMYB38 that is necessary for cold stress-responsive expression
