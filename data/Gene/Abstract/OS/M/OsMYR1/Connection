OsCERK1	OsMYR1	A LysM Receptor Heteromer Mediates Perception of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiotic Signal in Rice	 Compared with control plants, Osmyr1 and Oscerk1 mutant rice plants are less sensitive to Myc factors and show decreased AM colonization
OsCERK1	OsMYR1	A LysM Receptor Heteromer Mediates Perception of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiotic Signal in Rice	 We engineered transgenic rice by expressing chimeric receptors that respectively replaced the ectodomains of OsMYR1 and OsCERK1 with those from the homologous Nod factor receptors MtNFP and MtLYK3 of Medicago truncatula
