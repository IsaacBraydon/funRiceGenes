OsMDH1	leaf	Rice Plastidial NAD-Dependent Malate Dehydrogenase 1 Negatively Regulates Salt Stress Response by Reducing the Vitamin B6 Content.	 The OsMDH1 was expressed in different tissues of rice plants including leaf, leaf sheath, panicle, glume, bud, root, and stem and was induced in the presence of NaCl
OsMDH1	chloroplast	Rice Plastidial NAD-Dependent Malate Dehydrogenase 1 Negatively Regulates Salt Stress Response by Reducing the Vitamin B6 Content.	 Transient expression of OsMDH1-GFP in rice protoplasts showed that OsMDH1 localizes to chloroplast
OsMDH1	stem	Rice Plastidial NAD-Dependent Malate Dehydrogenase 1 Negatively Regulates Salt Stress Response by Reducing the Vitamin B6 Content.	 The OsMDH1 was expressed in different tissues of rice plants including leaf, leaf sheath, panicle, glume, bud, root, and stem and was induced in the presence of NaCl
OsMDH1	salt	Rice Plastidial NAD-Dependent Malate Dehydrogenase 1 Negatively Regulates Salt Stress Response by Reducing the Vitamin B6 Content.	 In this study, we identified a new loss-of-function osmdh1 mutant displaying salt stress-tolerant phenotype
OsMDH1	salt	Rice Plastidial NAD-Dependent Malate Dehydrogenase 1 Negatively Regulates Salt Stress Response by Reducing the Vitamin B6 Content.	 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsMDH1 (OsMDH1OX) displayed a salt stress-sensitive phenotype
OsMDH1	salt	Rice Plastidial NAD-Dependent Malate Dehydrogenase 1 Negatively Regulates Salt Stress Response by Reducing the Vitamin B6 Content.	 Moreover, the pyridoxine content was higher in the osmdh1 mutant and lower in OsMDH1OX plants than in the NIP plants under the salt stress, indicating that OsMDH1 negatively regulates salt stress-induced pyridoxine accumulation
OsMDH1	salt	Rice Plastidial NAD-Dependent Malate Dehydrogenase 1 Negatively Regulates Salt Stress Response by Reducing the Vitamin B6 Content.	 Together, our results establish a novel, negative regulatory role of OsMDH1 in salt stress tolerance by affecting vitamin B6 content of rice tissues
OsMDH1	tolerance	Rice Plastidial NAD-Dependent Malate Dehydrogenase 1 Negatively Regulates Salt Stress Response by Reducing the Vitamin B6 Content.	 Together, our results establish a novel, negative regulatory role of OsMDH1 in salt stress tolerance by affecting vitamin B6 content of rice tissues
