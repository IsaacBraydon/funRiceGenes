OsMDH1	 Transient expression of OsMDH1-GFP in rice protoplasts showed that OsMDH1 localizes to chloroplast |  Furthermore, genome-wide RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis indicated that ectopic expression of OsMDH1 altered the expression level of genes encoding key enzymes of the vitamin B6 biosynthesis pathway, possibly reducing the level of pyridoxine
