Salinity is an important environmental factor that adversely impacts crop growth and productivity. Malate dehydrogenases (MDHs) catalyze the reversible interconversion of malate and oxaloacetate using NAD(H)/NADP(H) as a cofactor and regulate plant development and abiotic stress tolerance. Vitamin B6 function as essential cofactors in enzymatic reactions involved in numerous cellular processes. However, the role of plastidial MDH in rice (Oryza sativa) in salt stress response by altering vitamin B6 content remains unknown. In this study, we identified a new loss-of-function osmdh1 mutant displaying salt stress-tolerant phenotype. The OsMDH1 was expressed in different tissues of rice plants including leaf, leaf sheath, panicle, glume, bud, root, and stem and was induced in the presence of NaCl. Transient expression of OsMDH1-GFP in rice protoplasts showed that OsMDH1 localizes to chloroplast. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsMDH1 (OsMDH1OX) displayed a salt stress-sensitive phenotype. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolic profiling revealed that the amount of pyridoxine was significantly reduced in OsMDH1OX lines compared with the NIP plants. Moreover, the pyridoxine content was higher in the osmdh1 mutant and lower in OsMDH1OX plants than in the NIP plants under the salt stress, indicating that OsMDH1 negatively regulates salt stress-induced pyridoxine accumulation. Furthermore, genome-wide RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis indicated that ectopic expression of OsMDH1 altered the expression level of genes encoding key enzymes of the vitamin B6 biosynthesis pathway, possibly reducing the level of pyridoxine. Together, our results establish a novel, negative regulatory role of OsMDH1 in salt stress tolerance by affecting vitamin B6 content of rice tissues. This article is protected by copyright.
