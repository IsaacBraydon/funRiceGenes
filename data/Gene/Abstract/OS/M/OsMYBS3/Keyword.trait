MYBS3|OsMYBS3	transcription factor	A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice	 MYBS3 is a single DNA-binding repeat MYB transcription factor previously shown to mediate sugar signaling in rice
MYBS3|OsMYBS3	seed	Three Novel MYB Proteins with One DNA Binding Repeat Mediate Sugar and Hormone Regulation of alpha-Amylase Gene Expression	 Transient expression assays with barley half-seeds showed that OsMYBS1 and OsMYBS2 transactivate a promoter containing the TATCCA element when sugar is provided, whereas OsMYBS3 represses transcription of the same promoter under sugar starvation
MYBS3|OsMYBS3	yield	A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice	 Transgenic rice constitutively overexpressing MYBS3 tolerated 4 degrees C for at least 1 week and exhibited no yield penalty in normal field conditions
MYBS3|OsMYBS3	cold tolerance	A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice	 Gain- and loss-of-function analyses indicated that MYBS3 was sufficient and necessary for enhancing cold tolerance in rice|A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice
MYBS3|OsMYBS3	abiotic stress	A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice	 Several genes activated by MYBS3 as well as inducible by cold have previously been implicated in various abiotic stress responses and/or tolerance in rice and other plant species
MYBS3|OsMYBS3	cold stress	A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice	" DREB1 responded quickly and transiently while MYBS3 responded slowly to cold stress, which suggests that distinct pathways act sequentially and complementarily for adapting short- and long-term cold stress in rice"
MYBS3|OsMYBS3	seed	Three Novel MYB Proteins with One DNA Binding Repeat Mediate Sugar and Hormone Regulation of alpha-Amylase Gene Expression	 Transient expression assays with barley half-seeds showed that OsMYBS1 and OsMYBS2 transactivate a promoter containing the TATCCA element when sugar is provided, whereas OsMYBS3 represses transcription of the same promoter under sugar starvation
