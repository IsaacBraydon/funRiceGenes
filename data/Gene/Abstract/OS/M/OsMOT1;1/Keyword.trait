OsMOT1;1	grain	Natural variation in a molybdate transporter controls grain molybdenum concentration in rice.	 Identification of natural allelic variation in OsMOT1;1 may facilitate the development of rice varieties with Mo enriched grain for dietary needs and improve Mo nutrition of rice on Mo-deficient soils
