NA	Natural variation in a molybdate transporter controls grain molybdenum concentration in rice.	2018	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential micronutrient for most living organisms, including humans. Cereals such as rice are the major dietary source of Mo. However, little is known about the genetic basis of the variation in Mo content in rice (Oryza sativa) grain. We mapped a quantitative trait locus (QTL) qGMo8 that controls Mo accumulation in rice grain by using a recombinant inbred line population and a backcross introgression line population. We identified a molybdate transporter, OsMOT1;1, as the causal gene for this QTL. OsMOT1;1 exhibits transport activity for molybdate, but not sulfate, when heterogeneously expressed in yeast cells. OsMOT1;1 is mainly expressed in roots and is involved in the uptake and translocation of molybdate under molybdate limited condition. Knock-down of OsMOT1;1 results in less Mo being translocated to shoots, lower Mo concentration in grains and higher sensitivity to Mo deficiency. We reveal that the natural variation of Mo concentration in rice grains is attributed to the variable expression of OsMOT1;1 due to sequence variation in its promoter. Identification of natural allelic variation in OsMOT1;1 may facilitate the development of rice varieties with Mo enriched grain for dietary needs and improve Mo nutrition of rice on Mo-deficient soils.

NA	Genetic mapping of ionomic quantitative trait loci in rice grain and straw reveals OsMOT1;1 as the putative causal gene for a molybdenum QTL qMo8.	2019	Mol Genet Genomics	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice is a major dietary source of essential mineral nutrients and toxic elements (aka ionome) for humans. However, the genetic basis underlying the variation in ionome is still largely unknown. Here, we mapped 51 and 61 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling the concentrations of 13 and 15 elements in rice (Oryza sativa L.) grain and straw, respectively, using a recombinant inbred lines (RILs) that were grown at three different field sites in 3<U+00A0>years. Several QTLs were repeatedly detected in both grain and straw or in multiple years; the resulting 87 unique QTLs with 17 of them (20%) were co-localized with previously reported corresponding QTLs and 70 were novel ionomic QTLs. At least, 14 genomic clusters that controlled the concentrations of multiple elements were identified. Furthermore, we identified a molybdate transporter gene OsMOT1;1 as the putative causal gene for a QTL controlling molybdenum concentration in both straw and grain. QTL analyses based on the concentrations of multiple elements in both grain and straw of RIL population grown in three field sites in 3<U+00A0>years allow us to identify tissue common QTLs and reproducible QTLs that were validated in multiple years. The identification of ionomic QTLs will be useful in revealing the molecular mechanisms underlying the accumulation of elements in rice and providing the opportunity to reduce the accumulation of toxic elements and enrich the accumulation of beneficial elements in rice grain.
