OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	OsMADS5	Conservation of the E-function for floral organ identity in rice revealed by the analysis of tissue culture-induced loss-of-function mutants of the OsMADS1 gene	) by characterizing tissue culture-induced mutants of two MADS-box genes, OsMADS1and OsMADS5, which form a subclade within the well-supported clade of SEP-genes (E-function) phylogeny
OsMADS5	OsMADS8|OsMADS24	Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)	Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs

OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	OsMADS5	Loss of LOFSEP transcription factor function converts Spikelet to Leaf-like Structures in Rice.	 OsMADS5 belongs to the conserved LOFSEP subgroup along with OsMADS1 and OsMADS34
OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	OsMADS5	Loss of LOFSEP transcription factor function converts Spikelet to Leaf-like Structures in Rice.	 Genetic and molecular analyses demonstrated that OsMADS1, OsMADS5 and OsMADS34 together regulate floral meristem determinacy, and specify the identities of spikelet organs by positively regulating the other MADS-box floral homeotic genes
OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	OsMADS5	Loss of LOFSEP transcription factor function converts Spikelet to Leaf-like Structures in Rice.	 Experiments conducted in yeast also suggested that OsMADS1, OsMADS5 and OsMADS34 form protein-protein interactions with other MADS-box floral homeotic members, which seems to be a typical, conserved feature of plant SEP proteins
OsMADS34|PAP2	OsMADS5	Loss of LOFSEP transcription factor function converts Spikelet to Leaf-like Structures in Rice.	 OsMADS5 belongs to the conserved LOFSEP subgroup along with OsMADS1 and OsMADS34
