OsMADS5	 We have generated loss-of-function and overexpression mutants of the paralogous OsMADS5 and OsMADS34 genes in rice (Oryza sativa), and analysed their panicle phenotypes |  Our results reveal a role for OsMADS5 in panicle development, and show that OsMADS5 and OsMADS34 play similar functions in limiting branching and promoting the transition to spikelet meristem identity, in part by repressing RCN4 expression	 We have generated loss-of-function and overexpression mutants of the paralogous OsMADS5 and OsMADS34 genes in rice (Oryza sativa), and analysed their panicle phenotypes
OsMADS5	 Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the expression level of OsMADS5 was supply |  Moreover, OsMADS5-overexpression plants displayed the opposite SR phenotype	 Moreover, OsMADS5-overexpression plants displayed the opposite SR phenotype
