OsMADS5	leaf	Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)	 Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs
OsMADS5	floral	Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)	 Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs
OsMADS5	lemma	Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)	 Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs
OsMADS5	vegetative	Conservation of the E-function for floral organ identity in rice revealed by the analysis of tissue culture-induced loss-of-function mutants of the OsMADS1 gene	 In case of the loss-of-function mutation of OsMADS5, no defect in either panicles or vegetative organs was observed
OsMADS5	panicle	Conservation of the E-function for floral organ identity in rice revealed by the analysis of tissue culture-induced loss-of-function mutants of the OsMADS1 gene	 In case of the loss-of-function mutation of OsMADS5, no defect in either panicles or vegetative organs was observed
