OsMDHAR4	leaf	Suppression of OsMDHAR4 enhances heat tolerance by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice plants.	 OsMDHAR4 expression was detected in all tissues surveyed and peaked in leaf blade
OsMDHAR4	resistance	Suppression of OsMDHAR4 enhances heat tolerance by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice plants.	 In rice, however, the detailed roles of OsMDHAR4 in resistance against heat stress remains unclear
OsMDHAR4	tolerance	Suppression of OsMDHAR4 enhances heat tolerance by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice plants.	Suppression of OsMDHAR4 enhances heat tolerance by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice plants.
OsMDHAR4	tolerance	Suppression of OsMDHAR4 enhances heat tolerance by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice plants.	 In comparison with wild type, the osmdhar4 mutant exhibited improved tolerance to heat stress, whereas OsMDHAR4 overexpression lines exhibited enhanced sensitivity to heat stress
OsMDHAR4	tolerance	Suppression of OsMDHAR4 enhances heat tolerance by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice plants.	Taken together, these results indicated that OsMDHAR4 negatively regulates tolerance to heat stress by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice
OsMDHAR4	stress	Suppression of OsMDHAR4 enhances heat tolerance by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice plants.	 In rice, however, the detailed roles of OsMDHAR4 in resistance against heat stress remains unclear
OsMDHAR4	stress	Suppression of OsMDHAR4 enhances heat tolerance by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice plants.	 In comparison with wild type, the osmdhar4 mutant exhibited improved tolerance to heat stress, whereas OsMDHAR4 overexpression lines exhibited enhanced sensitivity to heat stress
OsMDHAR4	stress	Suppression of OsMDHAR4 enhances heat tolerance by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice plants.	Taken together, these results indicated that OsMDHAR4 negatively regulates tolerance to heat stress by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice
OsMDHAR4	stomatal	Suppression of OsMDHAR4 enhances heat tolerance by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice plants.	Suppression of OsMDHAR4 enhances heat tolerance by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice plants.
OsMDHAR4	stomatal	Suppression of OsMDHAR4 enhances heat tolerance by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice plants.	 Moreover, we found that suppression of OsMDHAR4 promoted stomatal closure and hydrogen peroxide accumulation, and overexpression of OsMDHAR4 increased stomatal opening and decreased hydrogen peroxide content in rice leaves
OsMDHAR4	stomatal	Suppression of OsMDHAR4 enhances heat tolerance by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice plants.	Taken together, these results indicated that OsMDHAR4 negatively regulates tolerance to heat stress by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice
OsMDHAR4	heat tolerance	Suppression of OsMDHAR4 enhances heat tolerance by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice plants.	Suppression of OsMDHAR4 enhances heat tolerance by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice plants.
