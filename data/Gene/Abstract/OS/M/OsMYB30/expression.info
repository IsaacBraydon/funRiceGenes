OsMYB30	The OsMYB30 transcription factor suppresses cold tolerance by interacting with a JAZ protein and suppressing ¦Â-amylase expression. |  Functional analysis revealed that overexpression of OsMYB30 in rice resulted in increased cold sensitivity, while the osmyb30 knockout mutant showed increased cold tolerance |  The ¦Â-amylase activity and maltose content, which were decreased and increased in the OsMYB30-overexpression (OsMYB30-OE) and osmyb30 knockout mutant respectively, were correlated with the expression patterns of the BMY genes	 Functional analysis revealed that overexpression of OsMYB30 in rice resulted in increased cold sensitivity, while the osmyb30 knockout mutant showed increased cold tolerance |  The ¦Â-amylase activity and maltose content, which were decreased and increased in the OsMYB30-overexpression (OsMYB30-OE) and osmyb30 knockout mutant respectively, were correlated with the expression patterns of the BMY genes
