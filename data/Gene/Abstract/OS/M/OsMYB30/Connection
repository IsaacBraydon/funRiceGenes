OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	OsMYB30|OsMYB5P	The OsMYB30 transcription factor suppresses cold tolerance by interacting with a JAZ protein and suppressing beta-amylase expression.	Furthermore, we identified an OsMYB30-interacting protein OsJAZ9 that had a significant effect in suppressing the transcriptional activation of OsMYB30 and in the repression of BMY genes mediated by OsMYB30
OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	OsMYB30|OsMYB5P	The OsMYB30 transcription factor suppresses cold tolerance by interacting with a JAZ protein and suppressing beta-amylase expression.	These results together suggested that OsMYB30 might be a novel regulator of cold tolerance through the negative regulation of the BMY genes by interacting with OsJAZ9 to fine tune the starch breakdown and the content of maltose which might contribute to the cold tolerance as a compatible solute
OsMYB30|OsMYB5P	OsPht1;5|OsPT5	Rice OsMYB5P improves plant phosphate acquisition by regulation of phosphate transporter.	 Interestingly, OsMYB5P directly bound to MBS (MYB binding site) motifs on the OsPT5 promoter and induced transcription of OsPT5 in rice
OsmiR528	OsMYB30|OsMYB5P	OsmiR528 Enhances Cold Stress Tolerance by Repressing Expression of Stress Response-related Transcription Factor Genes in Plant Cells.	To investigate the potential mechanism of OsmiR528 in increasing cold stress tolerance, we examined expression of stress-associated MYB transcription factors OsGAMYB-like1, OsMYBS3, OsMYB4, OsMYB3R-2, OsMYB5, OsMYB59, OsMYB30, OsMYB1R, and OsMYB20 in rice cells by qRT-PCR
OsmiR528	OsMYB30|OsMYB5P	OsmiR528 Enhances Cold Stress Tolerance by Repressing Expression of Stress Response-related Transcription Factor Genes in Plant Cells.	Our experiments demonstrated that OsmiR528 decreases expression of transcription factor OsMYB30 by targeting a F-box domain containing protein gene (Os06g06050), which is a positive regulator of OsMYB30
OsmiR528	OsMYB30|OsMYB5P	OsmiR528 Enhances Cold Stress Tolerance by Repressing Expression of Stress Response-related Transcription Factor Genes in Plant Cells.	 In OsmiR528 transgenic rice, reduced OsMYB30 expression results in in-creased expression of BMY genes OsBMY2, OsBMY6, and OsBMY10
OsmiR528	OsMYB30|OsMYB5P	OsmiR528 Enhances Cold Stress Tolerance by Repressing Expression of Stress Response-related Transcription Factor Genes in Plant Cells.	 The transcript levels of the OsBMY2, OsBMY6, and OsBMY10 were elevated by OsMYB30 knockdown, but decreased by Os-MYB30 overexpression in OsmiR528 transgenic cell lines, suggesting that OsmiR528 increases low temperature tolerance by modulating expression of stress response-related transcription factor
OsMYB30|OsMYB5P	OsPAL8	An R2R3 MYB transcription factor confers brown planthopper resistance by regulating the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase pathway in rice.	 Furthermore, we show that expression of OsPAL6 and OsPAL8 in response to BPH attack is directly up-regulated by OsMYB30, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor
