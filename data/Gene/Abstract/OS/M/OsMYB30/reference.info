NA	The OsMYB30 transcription factor suppresses cold tolerance by interacting with a JAZ protein and suppressing beta-amylase expression.	2017	Plant Physiol	Huazhong Agricultural University CITY: Wuhan China [CN].	Cold stress is one of the major limiting factors for rice productivity. Several MYB transcriptional factors have been reported as important regulators in cold response, but the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we characterized a cold-responsive R2R3-type MYB gene OsMYB30 for its regulatory function in cold tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa). Functional analysis revealed that overexpression of OsMYB30 in rice resulted in increased cold sensitivity, while the osmyb30 knockout mutant showed increased cold tolerance. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) analyses revealed that a few beta-amylase (BMY) genes were down-regulated by OsMYB30. The beta-amylase activity and maltose content, which were decreased and increased in the OsMYB30-overexpression (OsMYB30-OE) and osmyb30 knockout mutant respectively, were correlated with the expression patterns of the BMY genes. OsMYB30 was shown to bind to the promoters of the BMY genes. These results suggested that OsMYB30 exhibited a regulatory effect on the breakdown of starch through the regulation of the BMY genes. In addition, application of maltose had a protective effect for cell membranes under cold stress conditions. Furthermore, we identified an OsMYB30-interacting protein OsJAZ9 that had a significant effect in suppressing the transcriptional activation of OsMYB30 and in the repression of BMY genes mediated by OsMYB30. These results together suggested that OsMYB30 might be a novel regulator of cold tolerance through the negative regulation of the BMY genes by interacting with OsJAZ9 to fine tune the starch breakdown and the content of maltose which might contribute to the cold tolerance as a compatible solute.
NA	The MAMP-responsive MYB transcription factors MYB30, MYB55, and MYB110 activate the HCAA synthesis pathway and enhance immunity in rice.	2018	Plant Cell Physiol	Genetically Modified Organism Research Center.	Phenylpropanoids including diverse compounds, such as monolignols and hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAAs), are essential for land plants to protect them against abiotic stresses, and create physical and chemical barriers to pathogen infection. However, the production control of these compounds against to pathogens has been poorly understood. Previously we showed that a MAMP (microbe-associated molecular pattern) -responsive MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascade (MKK4-MPK3/MPK6) comprehensively induced the expression of cinnamate/monolignol synthesis genes in rice cells. Here, we identified three MYB proteins, MYB30, MYB55, and MYB110, which are transcriptionally induced by the MAMP-treatment, MAPK-activation, and pathogen inoculation. Induced expression of these MYB genes systematically and specifically induced a large part of the genes encoding enzymes in the cinnamate/monolignol pathway. Furthermore, induced expression of the MYB genes caused accumulation of ferulic acid, one of the HCAAs, and enhanced resistance to both fungal and bacterial pathogens in planta. In conclusion, MYB30, MYB55, and MYB110 are involved in the signal pathway between MAMP perception and cinnamate/monolignol synthesis, and have important roles for plant immunity.
