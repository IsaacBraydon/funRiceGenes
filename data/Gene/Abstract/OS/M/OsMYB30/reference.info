NA	The OsMYB30 transcription factor suppresses cold tolerance by interacting with a JAZ protein and suppressing ¦Â-amylase expression.	2017	Plant Physiol	Huazhong Agricultural University CITY: Wuhan China [CN].	Cold stress is one of the major limiting factors for rice productivity. Several MYB transcriptional factors have been reported as important regulators in cold response, but the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we characterized a cold-responsive R2R3-type MYB gene OsMYB30 for its regulatory function in cold tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa). Functional analysis revealed that overexpression of OsMYB30 in rice resulted in increased cold sensitivity, while the osmyb30 knockout mutant showed increased cold tolerance. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) analyses revealed that a few ¦Â-amylase (BMY) genes were down-regulated by OsMYB30. The ¦Â-amylase activity and maltose content, which were decreased and increased in the OsMYB30-overexpression (OsMYB30-OE) and osmyb30 knockout mutant respectively, were correlated with the expression patterns of the BMY genes. OsMYB30 was shown to bind to the promoters of the BMY genes. These results suggested that OsMYB30 exhibited a regulatory effect on the breakdown of starch through the regulation of the BMY genes. In addition, application of maltose had a protective effect for cell membranes under cold stress conditions. Furthermore, we identified an OsMYB30-interacting protein OsJAZ9 that had a significant effect in suppressing the transcriptional activation of OsMYB30 and in the repression of BMY genes mediated by OsMYB30. These results together suggested that OsMYB30 might be a novel regulator of cold tolerance through the negative regulation of the BMY genes by interacting with OsJAZ9 to fine tune the starch breakdown and the content of maltose which might contribute to the cold tolerance as a compatible solute.
