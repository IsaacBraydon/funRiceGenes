NA	The OsMYB30 transcription factor suppresses cold tolerance by interacting with a JAZ protein and suppressing beta-amylase expression.	2017	Plant Physiol	Huazhong Agricultural University CITY: Wuhan China [CN].	Cold stress is one of the major limiting factors for rice productivity. Several MYB transcriptional factors have been reported as important regulators in cold response, but the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we characterized a cold-responsive R2R3-type MYB gene OsMYB30 for its regulatory function in cold tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa). Functional analysis revealed that overexpression of OsMYB30 in rice resulted in increased cold sensitivity, while the osmyb30 knockout mutant showed increased cold tolerance. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) analyses revealed that a few beta-amylase (BMY) genes were down-regulated by OsMYB30. The beta-amylase activity and maltose content, which were decreased and increased in the OsMYB30-overexpression (OsMYB30-OE) and osmyb30 knockout mutant respectively, were correlated with the expression patterns of the BMY genes. OsMYB30 was shown to bind to the promoters of the BMY genes. These results suggested that OsMYB30 exhibited a regulatory effect on the breakdown of starch through the regulation of the BMY genes. In addition, application of maltose had a protective effect for cell membranes under cold stress conditions. Furthermore, we identified an OsMYB30-interacting protein OsJAZ9 that had a significant effect in suppressing the transcriptional activation of OsMYB30 and in the repression of BMY genes mediated by OsMYB30. These results together suggested that OsMYB30 might be a novel regulator of cold tolerance through the negative regulation of the BMY genes by interacting with OsJAZ9 to fine tune the starch breakdown and the content of maltose which might contribute to the cold tolerance as a compatible solute.
NA	The MAMP-responsive MYB transcription factors MYB30, MYB55, and MYB110 activate the HCAA synthesis pathway and enhance immunity in rice.	2018	Plant Cell Physiol	Genetically Modified Organism Research Center.	Phenylpropanoids including diverse compounds, such as monolignols and hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAAs), are essential for land plants to protect them against abiotic stresses, and create physical and chemical barriers to pathogen infection. However, the production control of these compounds against to pathogens has been poorly understood. Previously we showed that a MAMP (microbe-associated molecular pattern) -responsive MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascade (MKK4-MPK3/MPK6) comprehensively induced the expression of cinnamate/monolignol synthesis genes in rice cells. Here, we identified three MYB proteins, MYB30, MYB55, and MYB110, which are transcriptionally induced by the MAMP-treatment, MAPK-activation, and pathogen inoculation. Induced expression of these MYB genes systematically and specifically induced a large part of the genes encoding enzymes in the cinnamate/monolignol pathway. Furthermore, induced expression of the MYB genes caused accumulation of ferulic acid, one of the HCAAs, and enhanced resistance to both fungal and bacterial pathogens in planta. In conclusion, MYB30, MYB55, and MYB110 are involved in the signal pathway between MAMP perception and cinnamate/monolignol synthesis, and have important roles for plant immunity.
NA	Rice OsMYB5P improves plant phosphate acquisition by regulation of phosphate transporter.	2018	PLoS One	College of Life Science and Natural Resources, Dong-A University, Busan, Korea.	Myeloblastosis (MYB) transcription factors play central roles in plant developmental processes and in responses to nutrient deficiency. In this study, OsMYB5P, an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, was isolated and identified from rice (Oryza sativa L. 'Dongjin') under inorganic phosphate (Pi)-deficient conditions. OsMYB5P protein is localized to the nucleus and functions as a transcription activator in plant development. Overexpression of OsMYB5P in rice and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0) increases tolerance to phosphate starvation, whereas OsMYB5P knock-out through RNA interference increases sensitivity to Pi depletion in rice. Furthermore, shoots and roots of transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsMYB5P were longer than those of wild plants under both normal and Pi-deficient conditions. These results indicate that OsMYB5P is associated with the regulation of shoot development and root- system architecture. Overexpression of OsMYB5P led to increased Pi accumulation in shoots and roots. Interestingly, OsMYB5P directly bound to MBS (MYB binding site) motifs on the OsPT5 promoter and induced transcription of OsPT5 in rice. In addition, overexpression of OsMYB5P in Arabidopsis triggered increased expression of AtPht1;3, an Arabidopsis Pi transporter, in shoots and roots under normal and Pi-deficient conditions. Together, these results demonstrate that overexpression of OsMYB5P increases tolerance to Pi deficiency in plants by modulating Pi transporters at the transcriptional level in monocots and dicots.
NA	Sclerenchyma cell thickening through enhanced lignification induced by OsMYB30 prevents fungal penetration of rice leaves.	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Key Laboratory of Major Crop Diseases &amp; Collaborative Innovation Center for Hybrid Rice in Yangtze River Basin, Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University at Wenjiang, Chengdu, Sichuan, 611130, China.	Broad-spectrum resistance is highly preferred in crop breeding programs. Previously, we reported the identification of the broad-spectrum resistance-Digu 1 (bsr-d1) allele from rice Digu. The bsr-d1 allele prevents activation of Bsr-d1 expression by Magnaporthe oryzae infection and degradation of H2 O2 by peroxidases, leading to resistance to M. oryzae. However, it remains unknown whether defense pathways other than H2 O2 burst and peroxidases contribute to the bsr-d1-mediated immunity. Blast resistance was determined in rice leaves by spray and punch inoculations. Target genes of OsMYB30 was identified by one-hybrid assays in yeast and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Lignin contents were measured by phloroglucinol-HCl staining, and acetyl bromide and thioacidolysis methods. Here, we report the involvement of the OsMYB30 gene in the bsr-d1-mediated blast resistance. Expression of OsMYB30 is induced during M. oryzae infection or when Bsr-d1 is knocked out or downregulated, as occurs in bsr-d1 plants upon infection. We further find that OsMYB30 binds to and activates the promoters of 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase genes (Os4CL3 and Os4CL5) resulting in accumulation of lignin subunits G and S. This action leads to obvious thickening of sclerenchyma cells near the epidermis, inhibiting M. oryzae penetration at the early stage of infection. Our study reveals novel components required for bsr-d1-mediated resistance and penetration-dependent immunity, and advances our understanding of broad-spectrum disease resistance.
NA	OsGATA16, a GATA Transcription Factor, Confers Cold Tolerance by Repressing OsWRKY45-1 at the Seedling Stage in Rice 	2021	Rice (N Y)	Jilin Province Engineering Laboratory of Plant Genetic Improvement, College of Plant Science, Jilin University, No. 5333 Xi'an Road, Changchun, 130062, China.	Background: Cold stress is the main abiotic stress in rice, which seriously affects the growth and yield of rice. Identification of cold tolerance genes is of great significance for rice to solve these problems. GATA-family transcription factors involve diverse biological functions, however, their role in cold tolerance in rice remains unclear.  Results: In this study, a GATA-type zinc finger transcription factor OsGATA16, which can improve cold tolerance, was isolated and characterized from rice. OsGATA16 belongs to OsGATA subfamily-II and contains 11 putative phosphorylation sites, a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and other several conserved domains. OsGATA16 was expressed in all plant tissues, with the strongest in panicles. It was induced by cold and ABA treatments, but was repressed by drought, cytokinin and JA, and acted as a transcriptional suppressor in the nucleus. Overexpression of OsGATA16 improves cold tolerance of rice at seedling stage. Under cold stress treatments, the transcription of four cold-related genes OsWRKY45-1, OsSRFP1, OsCYL4, and OsMYB30 was repressed in OsGATA16-overexpressing (OE) rice compared with wild-type (WT). Interestingly, OsGATA16 bound to the promoter of OsWRKY45-1 and repressed its expression. In addition, haplotype analysis showed that OsGATA16 polarized between the two major rice subspecies japonica and indica, and had a non-synonymous SNP8 (336G) associated with cold tolerance.  Conclusion: OsGATA16 is a GATA transcription factor, which improves cold tolerance at seedling stage in rice. It acts as a positive regulator of cold tolerance by repressing some cold-related genes such as OsWRKY45-1, OsSRFP1, OsCYL4 and OsMYB30. Additionally, OsGATA16 has a non-synonymous SNP8 (336G) associated with cold tolerance on CDS region. This study provides a theoretical basis for elucidating the mechanism of cold tolerance in rice and new germplasm resources for rice breeding.
