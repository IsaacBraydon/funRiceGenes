Hu-2011-The Bphi008a gene in.pdf	The Bphi008a gene interacts with the ethylene pathway and transcriptionally regulates MAPK genes in the response of rice to brown planthopper feeding	2011	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, People's Republic of China.	We examined ways in which the Brown planthopper induced008a (Bphi008a; AY256682) gene of rice (Oryza sativa) enhances the plant's resistance to a specialist herbivore, the brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens). Measurement of the expression levels of ethylene synthases and of ethylene emissions showed that BPH feeding rapidly initiated the ethylene signaling pathway and up-regulated Bphi008a transcript levels after 6 to 96 h of feeding. In contrast, blocking ethylene transduction (using 1-methylcyclopropene) reduced Bphi008a transcript levels in wild-type plants fed upon by BPH. In vitro kinase assays showed that Bphi008a can be phosphorylated by rice Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase5 (OsMPK5), and yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal proline-rich region of Bphi008a interacts directly with this kinase. Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that this interaction occurs in the nucleus. Subsequently, we found that Bphi008a up-regulation and down-regulation were accompanied by different changes in transcription levels of OsMPK5, OsMPK12, OsMPK13, and OsMPK17 in transgenic plants. Immunoblot analysis also showed that the OsMPK5 protein level increased in overexpressing plants and decreased in RNA interference plants after BPH feeding. In transgenic lines, changes in the expression levels of several enzymes that are important components of the defenses against the BPH were also observed. Finally, yeast two-hybrid screening results showed that Bphi008a is able to interact with a b-ZIP transcription factor (OsbZIP60) and a RNA polymerase polypeptide (SDRP).
MPMI-19-0530.pdf	Molecular analysis of the rice MAP kinase gene family in relation to Magnaporthe grisea infection	2006	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Department of Plant Pathology, Program in Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701, USA.	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play a crucial role in plant growth and development as well as biotic and abiotic stress responses. In Arabidopsis, 20 MAPKs have been identified and divided into four major groups. In rice, a monocot model and economically important cereal crop, only five MAPKs were characterized, including three related to the host defense response. In this study, we have identified 17 members of the rice MAPK gene (OsMPK) family through an in silico search of rice genome databases. Based on the phylogenetic analysis and pairwise comparison of Arabidopsis and rice MAPKs, we propose that MAPKs can be divided into six groups. Interestingly, the rice genome contains many more MAPKs with the TDY phosphorylation site (11 members) than with the TEY motif (six members). In contrast, the Arabidopsis genome contains more MAPKs with the TEY motif (12 members) than with the TDY motif (eight members). Upon inoculation with the blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea), nine of 17 OsMPK genes were found to be induced at the mRNA level during either early, late, or both stages of infection. Four of the M. grisea-induced OsMPK genes were associated with host-cell death in the lesion-mimic rice mutant, and eight of them were differentially induced in response to defense signal molecules such as jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, abscisic acid, and ethylene. The genome-wide expression analysis suggests that about half of the rice MAPK genes are associated with pathogen infection and host defense response.
NA	Rice MPK17 Plays a Negative Role in the Xa21-Mediated Resistance Against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2022	Rice (N Y)	College of Life Sciences, Hebei Agricultural University, 2596 Lekai South Street, West Campus, Baoding, 071001, Hebei, China.	Rice bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is one of the most serious diseases affecting rice production worldwide. Xa21 was the first disease resistance gene cloned in rice, which encodes a receptor kinase and confers broad resistance against Xoo stains. Dozens of components in the Xa21-mediated pathway have been identified in the past decades, however, the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) genes in the pathway has not been well described. To identify MAPK involved in Xa21-mediated resistance, the level of MAPK proteins was profiled using Western blot analysis. The abundance of OsMPK17 (MPK17) was found decreased during the rice-Xoo interaction in the background of Xa21. To investigate the function of MPK17, MPK17-RNAi and over-expression (OX) transgenic lines were generated. The RNAi lines showed an enhanced resistance, while OX lines had impaired resistance against Xoo, indicating that MPK17 plays negative role in Xa21-mediated resistance. Furthermore, the abundance of transcription factor WRKY62 and pathogenesis-related proteins PR1A were changed in the MPK17 transgenic lines when inoculated with Xoo. We also observed that the MPK17-RNAi and -OX rice plants showed altered agronomic traits, indicating that MPK17 also plays roles in the growth and development. On the basis of the current study and published results, we propose a &quot;Xa21-MPK17-WRKY62-PR1A&quot; signaling that functions in the Xa21-mediated disease resistance pathway. The identification of MPK17 advances our understanding of the mechanism underlying Xa21-mediated immunity, and late-stages.
