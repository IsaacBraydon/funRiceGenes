OsMTI2B|OsMT2c	vascular bundle	Two metallothionein genes highly expressed in rice nodes are involved in distribution of Zn to the grain	 Both OsMT2b and OsMT2c were mainly and constitutively expressed in the phloem region of enlarged and diffuse vascular bundles in the nodes and of the anther
OsMTI2B|OsMT2c	grain	Two metallothionein genes highly expressed in rice nodes are involved in distribution of Zn to the grain	 Knockout of either OsMT2b or OsMT2c increased zinc (Zn) accumulation in the nodes, but decreased Zn distribution to the panicle, resulting in decreased grain yield
OsMTI2B|OsMT2c	grain	Two metallothionein genes highly expressed in rice nodes are involved in distribution of Zn to the grain	 Our results suggest that both OsMT2b and OsMT2c play an important role mainly in the distribution of Zn to grain through chelation and subsequent transport of Zn in the phloem in rice
OsMTI2B|OsMT2c	anther	Two metallothionein genes highly expressed in rice nodes are involved in distribution of Zn to the grain	 Both OsMT2b and OsMT2c were mainly and constitutively expressed in the phloem region of enlarged and diffuse vascular bundles in the nodes and of the anther
OsMTI2B|OsMT2c	grain yield	Two metallothionein genes highly expressed in rice nodes are involved in distribution of Zn to the grain	 Knockout of either OsMT2b or OsMT2c increased zinc (Zn) accumulation in the nodes, but decreased Zn distribution to the panicle, resulting in decreased grain yield
OsMTI2B|OsMT2c	yield	Two metallothionein genes highly expressed in rice nodes are involved in distribution of Zn to the grain	 Knockout of either OsMT2b or OsMT2c increased zinc (Zn) accumulation in the nodes, but decreased Zn distribution to the panicle, resulting in decreased grain yield
OsMTI2B|OsMT2c	zinc	Two metallothionein genes highly expressed in rice nodes are involved in distribution of Zn to the grain	 Knockout of either OsMT2b or OsMT2c increased zinc (Zn) accumulation in the nodes, but decreased Zn distribution to the panicle, resulting in decreased grain yield
OsMTI2B|OsMT2c	phloem	Two metallothionein genes highly expressed in rice nodes are involved in distribution of Zn to the grain	 Both OsMT2b and OsMT2c were mainly and constitutively expressed in the phloem region of enlarged and diffuse vascular bundles in the nodes and of the anther
OsMTI2B|OsMT2c	phloem	Two metallothionein genes highly expressed in rice nodes are involved in distribution of Zn to the grain	 Our results suggest that both OsMT2b and OsMT2c play an important role mainly in the distribution of Zn to grain through chelation and subsequent transport of Zn in the phloem in rice
OsMTI2B|OsMT2c	Zn distribution	Two metallothionein genes highly expressed in rice nodes are involved in distribution of Zn to the grain	 Knockout of either OsMT2b or OsMT2c increased zinc (Zn) accumulation in the nodes, but decreased Zn distribution to the panicle, resulting in decreased grain yield
