NA	Functional characterization of a type 2 metallothionein isoform (OsMTI-2b) from rice.	2016	Int J Biol Macromol	Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, College of Agriculture, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran.	Metallothioneins (MTs) are a family of Cys-rich, low molecular weight, cytoplasmic metal binding proteins. MTs are present in all eukaryotes as well as some prokaryotes. Plant MTs are divided into four types based on Cys distribution pattern in their amino acid sequences. In the present work, the gene encoding OsMTI-2b, a type 2 MT found in rice, was cloned into pET41a vector. The resulting construct was transformed into Escherichia coli strain Rosetta (DE3). Following the induction with Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside the OsMTI-2b was expressed as carboxyl-terminal extensions of glutathione-S-transferase (GST-tag), a 6His-tag, and an S-tag. The expressed recombinant fusion protein was named GST-OsMTI-2b. As compared with control, transgenic E. coli cells expressing GST-OsMTI-2b accumulated more Pb(2+), Ni(2+), Cd(2+), Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) from culture medium and showed increased βtolerance against these metals. Furthermore the E. coli cells expressing OsMTI-2b accumulated significantly higher Pb(2+) than previously made strains which expressing other rice OsMT isoforms. The recombinant GST-OsMTI-2b was purified using affinity chromatography. According to in vitro assays the protein GST-OsMTI-2b was able to form complexes with Pb(2+), Ni(2+), Cd(2+) and Zn(2+). However, the binding ability for the different metals differed in the order: Pb(2+)&gt;Cd(2+)&gt;Zn(2+)&gt;Ni(2+).
NA	Two metallothionein genes highly expressed in rice nodes are involved in distribution of Zn to the grain	2020	New Phytol	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Chuo 2-20-1, Kurashiki, 710-0046, Japan.	A rice node is a hub for distribution of mineral elements; however, most genes highly expressed in the node have not been functionally characterized. Transcriptomic analysis of a rice node revealed that two metallothionein genes, OsMT2b and OsMT2c, were highly expressed in the node I. We functionally characterized these genes in terms of gene expression pattern, cellular and subcellular localization, phenotypic analysis of the single and double knockout mutants and metal-binding ability. Both OsMT2b and OsMT2c were mainly and constitutively expressed in the phloem region of enlarged and diffuse vascular bundles in the nodes and of the anther. Knockout of either OsMT2b or OsMT2c increased zinc (Zn) accumulation in the nodes, but decreased Zn distribution to the panicle, resulting in decreased grain yield. A double mutant, osmt2bmt2c, showed further negative effects on the Zn distribution and grain yield. By contrast, knockout of OsMT2b had a small effect on copper (Cu) accumulation. Both OsMT2b and OsMT2c showed binding ability with Zn, whereas only OsMT2b showed binding ability with Cu in yeast. Our results suggest that both OsMT2b and OsMT2c play an important role mainly in the distribution of Zn to grain through chelation and subsequent transport of Zn in the phloem in rice.
