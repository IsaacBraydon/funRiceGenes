OsMT-II-1a	seed	Characterization of a rice class II metallothionein gene: tissue expression patterns and induction in response to abiotic factors	 Northern blot analysis showed that accumulation of OsMT-II-1a mRNA is specifically abundant in developing seeds and 2-day glumes after pollination, and OsMT-II-1a transcription can markedly be induced by H2O2, paraquat, SNP, ethephon, ABA and SA, but barely by metal ions or other exogenous abiotic factors such as low temperature and PEG
OsMT-II-1a	seed	Characterization of a rice class II metallothionein gene: tissue expression patterns and induction in response to abiotic factors	 Taken together, the above results suggest that the processes of pollination and seed development might be mediated, at least in part, by expression of the OsMT-II-1a gene that is regulated by several abiotic factors
