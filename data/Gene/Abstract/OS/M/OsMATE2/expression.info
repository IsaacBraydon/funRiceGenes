OsMATE2	Expression of rice MATE family transporter OsMATE2 modulates arsenic accumulation in tobacco and rice. | The OsMATE2 upon constitutive expression in tobacco decreases root-to-shoot As transfer coefficient and its endosperm-specific silencing in rice reduces grain As content, broadening the role of MATE proteins in planta |  Therefore, to understand the role of OsMATE2 in As accumulation, constitutive expression in tobacco was carried out	 Consequently, RNAi strategy was utilized for endosperm-specific silencing of endogenous OsMATE2 to mitigate As accumulation in rice grains
