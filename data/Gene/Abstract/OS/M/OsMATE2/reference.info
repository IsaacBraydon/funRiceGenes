srep03964.pdf	Expression of OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 alters development, stress responses and pathogen susceptibility in Arabidopsis	2014	Sci Rep	National Botanical Research Institute, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow-226 001, INDIA.	Multidrug and Toxic compound Extrusion proteins (MATE) are a group of secondary active transporters with ubiquitous occurrences in all domains of life. This is a newly characterized transporter family with limited functional knowledge in plants. In this study, we functionally characterised two members of rice MATE gene family, OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 through expression in heterologous system, Arabidopsis. Expression of OsMATEs in Arabidopsis altered growth and morphology of transgenic plants. Genome-wide expression analysis revealed modulation of genes involved in plant growth, development and biotic stress in transgenic lines. Transgenic plants displayed sensitivity for biotic and abiotic stresses. Elevated pathogen susceptibility of transgenic lines was correlated with reduced expressions of defence related genes. Promoter and cellular localization studies suggest that both MATEs express in developing and reproductive organs and are plasma-membrane localised. Our results reveal that OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 regulate plant growth and development as well as negatively affect disease resistance.
NA	Expression of rice MATE family transporter OsMATE2 modulates arsenic accumulation in tobacco and rice.	2018	Plant Mol Biol	Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, 721302, India.	The OsMATE2 upon constitutive expression in tobacco decreases root-to-shoot As transfer coefficient and its endosperm-specific silencing in rice reduces grain As content, broadening the role of MATE proteins in planta. Rice (Oryza sativa) is capable of accumulating significant amount of arsenic (As) in grains, causing serious health hazard for rice consuming population. The multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) protein family comprises a large group of secondary transporters present universally in living organisms, and transports metabolites and/or xenobiotic compounds. OsMATE2, one of the MATE family members of rice was found to be transcriptionally up-regulated (sixfolds) in the developing seeds during As stress, and showed positive correlation with the As content in mature grains. Therefore, to understand the role of OsMATE2 in As accumulation, constitutive expression in tobacco was carried out. Transgenic tobacco plants exhibited decreased root-to-shoot As transfer coefficient (33.3-39.6%) along with augmented As sensitivity by increasing oxidative stress compared to untransformed control plants, indicating the involvement of OsMATE2 in As accumulation. Consequently, RNAi strategy was utilized for endosperm-specific silencing of endogenous OsMATE2 to mitigate As accumulation in rice grains. Transgenic rice lines demonstrated significant reduction of both OsMATE2 transcript (~<U+2009>38-87%) and grain As content (36.9-47.8%) compared to the control plants without undesirable effects on agronomical traits. Together, the present findings indicate the connection of OsMATE2 in As accumulation, and could expand the functional role of MATE proteins in planta.
