OsMATE2	growth	Expression of OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 alters development, stress responses and pathogen susceptibility in Arabidopsis	Our results reveal that OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 regulate plant growth and development as well as negatively affect disease resistance
OsMATE2	disease resistance	Expression of OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 alters development, stress responses and pathogen susceptibility in Arabidopsis	Our results reveal that OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 regulate plant growth and development as well as negatively affect disease resistance
OsMATE2	disease	Expression of OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 alters development, stress responses and pathogen susceptibility in Arabidopsis	Our results reveal that OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 regulate plant growth and development as well as negatively affect disease resistance
OsMATE2	grain	Expression of rice MATE family transporter OsMATE2 modulates arsenic accumulation in tobacco and rice.	The OsMATE2 upon constitutive expression in tobacco decreases root-to-shoot As transfer coefficient and its endosperm-specific silencing in rice reduces grain As content, broadening the role of MATE proteins in planta
OsMATE2	grain	Expression of rice MATE family transporter OsMATE2 modulates arsenic accumulation in tobacco and rice.	 Transgenic rice lines demonstrated significant reduction of both OsMATE2 transcript (~<U+2009>38-87%) and grain As content (36
OsMATE2	oxidative stress	Expression of rice MATE family transporter OsMATE2 modulates arsenic accumulation in tobacco and rice.	6%) along with augmented As sensitivity by increasing oxidative stress compared to untransformed control plants, indicating the involvement of OsMATE2 in As accumulation
OsMATE2	oxidative	Expression of rice MATE family transporter OsMATE2 modulates arsenic accumulation in tobacco and rice.	6%) along with augmented As sensitivity by increasing oxidative stress compared to untransformed control plants, indicating the involvement of OsMATE2 in As accumulation
OsMATE2	stress	Expression of rice MATE family transporter OsMATE2 modulates arsenic accumulation in tobacco and rice.	6%) along with augmented As sensitivity by increasing oxidative stress compared to untransformed control plants, indicating the involvement of OsMATE2 in As accumulation
OsMATE2	transporter	Expression of rice MATE family transporter OsMATE2 modulates arsenic accumulation in tobacco and rice.	Expression of rice MATE family transporter OsMATE2 modulates arsenic accumulation in tobacco and rice.
OsMATE2	arsenic accumulation	Expression of rice MATE family transporter OsMATE2 modulates arsenic accumulation in tobacco and rice.	Expression of rice MATE family transporter OsMATE2 modulates arsenic accumulation in tobacco and rice.
