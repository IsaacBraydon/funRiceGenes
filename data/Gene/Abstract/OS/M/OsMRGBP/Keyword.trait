OsMRGBP	flowering time	Rice OsMRG702 and Its Partner OsMRGBP Control Flowering Time through H4 Acetylation.	 Both Osmrg702 and Osmrgbp mutants show the delayed flowering phenotype with the reduction in the transcription of multiple key flowering time genes, including Ehd1 and RFT1

OsMRGBP	flowering	Rice OsMRG702 and Its Partner OsMRGBP Control Flowering Time through H4 Acetylation.	 In summary, OsMRG702 controls flowering gene regulation by altering H4 acetylation in rice; it works either together with OsMRGBP to enhance transcription by promoting H4 acetylation or with other unknown mechanisms to dampen transcription by preventing H4 acetylation
