Ehd1	OsMRGBP	Rice OsMRG702 and Its Partner OsMRGBP Control Flowering Time through H4 Acetylation.	 Both Osmrg702 and Osmrgbp mutants show the delayed flowering phenotype with the reduction in the transcription of multiple key flowering time genes, including Ehd1 and RFT1
Ehd1	OsMRGBP	Rice OsMRG702 and Its Partner OsMRGBP Control Flowering Time through H4 Acetylation.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation study showed that both OsMRG702 and OsMRGBP bind to the Ehd1 and RFT1 loci and the absence of either OsMRG702 or OsMRGBP leads to a decrease of H4K5 acetylation at these loci, indicating OsMRG702 and OsMRGBP cooperatively together to promote the H4K5 acetylation
Ghd7	OsMRGBP	Rice OsMRG702 and Its Partner OsMRGBP Control Flowering Time through H4 Acetylation.	 In addition, whilst Ghd7 are upregulated in both Osmrg702 and Osmrgbp mutants, only OsMRG702 binds to the loci, together with the global increased and Ghd7 locus-specific increased H4K5ac levels in Osmrg702 mutants, suggesting an additional negative effect of OsMRG702 on H4K5 acetylation
OsMRGBP	RFT1	Rice OsMRG702 and Its Partner OsMRGBP Control Flowering Time through H4 Acetylation.	 Both Osmrg702 and Osmrgbp mutants show the delayed flowering phenotype with the reduction in the transcription of multiple key flowering time genes, including Ehd1 and RFT1
OsMRGBP	RFT1	Rice OsMRG702 and Its Partner OsMRGBP Control Flowering Time through H4 Acetylation.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation study showed that both OsMRG702 and OsMRGBP bind to the Ehd1 and RFT1 loci and the absence of either OsMRG702 or OsMRGBP leads to a decrease of H4K5 acetylation at these loci, indicating OsMRG702 and OsMRGBP cooperatively together to promote the H4K5 acetylation
