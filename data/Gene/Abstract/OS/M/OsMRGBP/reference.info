NA	Rice OsMRG702 and Its Partner OsMRGBP Control Flowering Time through H4 Acetylation.	2023	Int J Mol Sci	College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agriculture University, Nanjing 210014, China.	MORF-RELATED GENE702 (OsMRG702) regulates flowering time genes in rice, but how it controls transcription is not well known. Here, we found that OsMRGBP can directly interact with OsMRG702. Both Osmrg702 and Osmrgbp mutants show the delayed flowering phenotype with the reduction in the transcription of multiple key flowering time genes, including Ehd1 and RFT1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation study showed that both OsMRG702 and OsMRGBP bind to the Ehd1 and RFT1 loci and the absence of either OsMRG702 or OsMRGBP leads to a decrease of H4K5 acetylation at these loci, indicating OsMRG702 and OsMRGBP cooperatively together to promote the H4K5 acetylation. In addition, whilst Ghd7 are upregulated in both Osmrg702 and Osmrgbp mutants, only OsMRG702 binds to the loci, together with the global increased and Ghd7 locus-specific increased H4K5ac levels in Osmrg702 mutants, suggesting an additional negative effect of OsMRG702 on H4K5 acetylation. In summary, OsMRG702 controls flowering gene regulation by altering H4 acetylation in rice; it works either together with OsMRGBP to enhance transcription by promoting H4 acetylation or with other unknown mechanisms to dampen transcription by preventing H4 acetylation.
