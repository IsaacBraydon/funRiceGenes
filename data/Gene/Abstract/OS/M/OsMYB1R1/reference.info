NA	Overexpression of OsMYB1R1-VP64 fusion protein increases grain yield in rice by delaying flowering time.	2016	FEBS Lett	National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, China.	VP64 is widely used as a transcriptional activator to investigate the biological function of genes, but its potential for application in genetic improvement of crops has not been fully investigated. Here, we characterized an OsMYB1R1-VP64 fusion protein that enhanced the grain yield of rice cultivar 'Kita-ake' by 35%. OsMYB1R1-VP64 regulated grain yield of transgenic plants mainly by extending the vegetative growth stage. Further analysis indicated that OsMYB1R1-VP64 delayed flowering by down-regulating expression of Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and RICE FLOWERING LOCUST 1 (RFT1) through repression of Early heading date 1 (Ehd1). The expression pattern of OsMYB1R1 was constitutive and rhythmically controlled. OsMYB1R1 protein had transcriptional activation activity and was localized to the nucleus. Our findings suggest that the OsMYB1R1-VP64 construct can be used to increase grain yield in rice.
