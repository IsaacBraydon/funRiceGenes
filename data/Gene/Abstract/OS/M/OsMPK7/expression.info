OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	 Here, we identified a group D mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) gene from rice (Oryza sativa), OsMAPK20-5, whose expression was rapidly induced by infestation of gravid female adults of a destructive rice pest, brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) but not by BPH nymphs |  Expression silencing of OsMAPK20-5 (irMAPK) increased the accumulation of ethylene and nitric oxide (NO) following gravid female BPH infestation, and thereby increased rice plant resistance to BPH adults and oviposited eggs
