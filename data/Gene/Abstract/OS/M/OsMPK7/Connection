OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	OsWRKY30	OsWRKY30 is activated by MAP kinases to confer drought tolerance in rice	Here, we have shown that OsWRKY30 interacted with OsMPK3, OsMPK4, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, OsMPK20-4, and OsMPK20-5, and could be phosphorylated by OsMPK3, OsMPK7, and OsMPK14
OsMPK6|OsMPK4	OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	OsWRKY30 is activated by MAP kinases to confer drought tolerance in rice	Here, we have shown that OsWRKY30 interacted with OsMPK3, OsMPK4, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, OsMPK20-4, and OsMPK20-5, and could be phosphorylated by OsMPK3, OsMPK7, and OsMPK14
OsMPK14	OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	OsWRKY30 is activated by MAP kinases to confer drought tolerance in rice	Here, we have shown that OsWRKY30 interacted with OsMPK3, OsMPK4, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, OsMPK20-4, and OsMPK20-5, and could be phosphorylated by OsMPK3, OsMPK7, and OsMPK14
OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	Differential Responses of OsMPKs in IR56 Rice to Two BPH Populations of Different Virulence Levels.	 Out of these genes, five OsMPKs (OsMPK1, OsMPK3, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, and OsMPK16) were found to exhibit upregulated expression only during incompatible interaction
OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	OsMSRMK2|OsMAP1|OsMPK5|OsMAPK2|OsMAPK5|OsBIMK1|OsMPK3	Differential Responses of OsMPKs in IR56 Rice to Two BPH Populations of Different Virulence Levels.	 Out of these genes, five OsMPKs (OsMPK1, OsMPK3, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, and OsMPK16) were found to exhibit upregulated expression only during incompatible interaction
OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	OsWRKY55|WRKY55a|WRKY55b	Rice Transcription Factor OsWRKY55 Is Involved in the Drought Response and Regulation of Plant Growth 	 Through yeast two-hybrid assays, we found that OsWRKY55 interacted with four mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that could be induced by drought, including OsMPK7, OsMPK9, OsMPK20-1, and OsMPK20-4
OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	OsWRKY30	Functional Involvement of a Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Module, OsMKK3-OsMPK7-OsWRK30 in Mediating Resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae in Rice.	 Here we report involvement of a poorly characterized group C MAPK of rice namely, OsMPK7 along with its upstream MAPK kinase, OsMKK3 and downstream target, OsWRKY30 during Xanthomonas oryzae infection, a causal agent of leaf blight disease in rice
OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	OsWRKY30	Functional Involvement of a Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Module, OsMKK3-OsMPK7-OsWRK30 in Mediating Resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae in Rice.	 Furthermore, OsWRKY30 was identified as downstream target of OsMPK7 through protein-protein interaction techniques and was found to be a positive regulator of defence response against X
