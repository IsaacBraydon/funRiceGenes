OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	OsWRKY30	OsWRKY30 is activated by MAP kinases to confer drought tolerance in rice	Here, we have shown that OsWRKY30 interacted with OsMPK3, OsMPK4, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, OsMPK20-4, and OsMPK20-5, and could be phosphorylated by OsMPK3, OsMPK7, and OsMPK14
OsMPK6|OsMPK4	OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	OsWRKY30 is activated by MAP kinases to confer drought tolerance in rice	Here, we have shown that OsWRKY30 interacted with OsMPK3, OsMPK4, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, OsMPK20-4, and OsMPK20-5, and could be phosphorylated by OsMPK3, OsMPK7, and OsMPK14

OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	Differential Responses of OsMPKs in IR56 Rice to Two BPH Populations of Different Virulence Levels.	 Out of these genes, five OsMPKs (OsMPK1, OsMPK3, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, and OsMPK16) were found to exhibit upregulated expression only during incompatible interaction
