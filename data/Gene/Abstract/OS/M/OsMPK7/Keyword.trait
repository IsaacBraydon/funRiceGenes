OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	resistance	A group D MAPK protects plants from autotoxicity by suppressing herbivore-induced defense signaling.	 Expression silencing of OsMAPK20-5 (irMAPK) increased the accumulation of ethylene and nitric oxide (NO) following gravid female BPH infestation, and thereby increased rice plant resistance to BPH adults and oviposited eggs
OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	resistance	A group D MAPK protects plants from autotoxicity by suppressing herbivore-induced defense signaling.	 Taken together, our study shows that although OsMAPK20-5 can reduce the resistance of rice plants to planthoppers, it also enables rice plants to control excessive defense responses and thereby prevents defense response-related autotoxicity

Taken together, our study shows that although OsMAPK20-5 can reduce the resistance of rice plants to planthoppers, it also enables rice plants to control excessive defense responses and thereby prevents defense response-related autotoxicity

OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	leaf	Silencing OsMAPK20-5 has different effects on rice pests in the field.	 In this context, we observed that silencing OsMAPK20-5 increased the percentage of leaf roll caused by leaf folder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis and the severity of rice blast caused by Magnaporthe grisea but decreased the severity of sheath blight caused by Rhizoctonia solani
OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	resistance	Silencing OsMAPK20-5 has different effects on rice pests in the field.	 These findings show that silencing OsMAPK20-5 has different effects on rice pests in the field, and these differences have important implications for the evolution and exploitation of resistance strategies in plants
OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	sheath	Silencing OsMAPK20-5 has different effects on rice pests in the field.	 In this context, we observed that silencing OsMAPK20-5 increased the percentage of leaf roll caused by leaf folder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis and the severity of rice blast caused by Magnaporthe grisea but decreased the severity of sheath blight caused by Rhizoctonia solani
OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	blast	Silencing OsMAPK20-5 has different effects on rice pests in the field.	 In this context, we observed that silencing OsMAPK20-5 increased the percentage of leaf roll caused by leaf folder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis and the severity of rice blast caused by Magnaporthe grisea but decreased the severity of sheath blight caused by Rhizoctonia solani
OsMPK7|OsMAPK20-5	blight	Silencing OsMAPK20-5 has different effects on rice pests in the field.
