OsMIK	OsMRP5	Phytic Acid Contents and Metabolite Profiles of Progenies from Crossing Low Phytic Acid OsMIK and OsMRP5 Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Mutants.	 Progenies resulting from the cross of Os-lpa-XS110-1, a rice mutant carrying the myo-inositol (OsMIK) mutated gene, and Os-lpa-XS110-2 with the multi-drug resistance-associated protein ABC transporter gene 5 (OsMRP5) as mutation target, were subjected to high pressure ion chromatography
