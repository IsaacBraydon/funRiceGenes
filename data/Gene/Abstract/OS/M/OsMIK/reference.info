The rice low phytic acid (lpa) mutant Os-lpa-XS110-1(XS-lpa) has ~45 % reduction in seed phytic acid (PA) compared with the wild-type cultivar Xiushui 110. Previously, a single recessive gene mutation was shown to be responsible for the lpa phenotype and was mapped to a region of chromosome 3 near OsMIK (LOC_Os03g52760) and OsIPK1 (LOC_Os03g51610), two genes involved in PA biosynthesis. Here, we report the identification of a large insert in the intron of OsMIK in the XS-lpa mutant. Sequencing of fragments amplified through TAIL-PCRs revealed that the insert was a derivative of the LINE retrotransposon gene LOC_Os03g56910. Further analyses revealed the following characteristics of the insert and its impacts: (1) the inserted sequence of LOC_Os03g56910 was split at its third exon and rejoined inversely, with its 5' and 3' flanking sequences inward and the split third exon segments outward; (2) the LOC_Os03g56910 remained in its original locus in XS-lpa, and the insertion probably resulted from homologous recombination repair of a DNA double strand break; (3) while the OsMIK transcripts of XS-lpa and Xiushui 110 were identical, substantial reductions of the transcript abundance (~87 %) and the protein level (~60 %) were observed in XS-lpa, probably due to increased methylation in its promoter region. The above findings are discussed in the context of plant mutagenesis, epigenetics and lpa breeding.

Using a forward genetics approach, we isolated two independent low phytic acid (lpa) rice mutants, N15-186 and N15-375. Both mutants are caused by single gene, recessive non-lethal mutations, which result in approximately 75% (N15-186) and 43% (N15-375) reductions in seed phytic acid (inositol hexakisphosphate). High-performance liquid chromatography and GC-MS analysis of seed extracts from N15-186 indicated that, in addition to phytic acid, inositol monophosphate was significantly reduced whereas inorganic phosphorus and myo-inositol were greatly increased when compared with wild-type. The changes observed in N15-186 resemble those previously described for the maize lpa3 mutant. Analysis of N15-375 revealed changes similar to those observed in previously characterized rice lpa1 mutants (i.e. significant reduction in phytic acid and corresponding increase in inorganic phosphorus with little or no change in inositol phosphate intermediates or myo-inositol). Further genetic analysis of the N15-186 mutant indicated that the mutation, designated lpa N15-186, was located in a region on chromosome 3 between the microsatellite markers RM15875 and RM15907. The rice orthologue of maize lpa3, which encodes a myo-inositol kinase, is in this interval. Sequence analysis of the N15-186 allele of this orthologue (Os03g52760) revealed a single base pair change (C/G to T/A) in the first exon of the gene, which results in a nonsense mutation. Our results indicate that lpa N15-186 is a mutant allele of the rice myo-inositol kinase (OsMIK) gene. Identification and characterization of lpa mutants, such as N15-186, will facilitate studies on the regulation of phytic acid biosynthesis and accumulation and help address questions concerning the contribution of the inositol lipid-dependent and independent biosynthetic pathways to the production of seed phytic acid.
