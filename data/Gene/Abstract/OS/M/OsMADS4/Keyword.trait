OsMADS4	stamen	Divergent regulatory OsMADS2 functions control size, shape and differentiation of the highly derived rice floret second-whorl organ	The global architecture of transcripts regulated by OsMADS2 gives insights into the regulation of cell division and vascular differentiation that together can form this highly modified grass organ with important functions in floret opening and stamen emergence independent of the paralogous gene OsMADS4

OsMADS4	flower	Functional analysis of the rice AP3 homologue OsMADS16 by RNA interference	Our results demonstrate that OsMADS16 is an AP3/DEF orthologue to specify the identities of lodicules and stamens in rice flower and also support that OsMADS4 is a PI orthologue
OsMADS4	stamen	Functional analysis of the rice AP3 homologue OsMADS16 by RNA interference	Our results demonstrate that OsMADS16 is an AP3/DEF orthologue to specify the identities of lodicules and stamens in rice flower and also support that OsMADS4 is a PI orthologue
OsMADS4	 pi 	Functional analysis of the rice AP3 homologue OsMADS16 by RNA interference	Transcription of a rice PI homologous gene, OsMADS4, was also reduced remarkably in the transgenic plants
OsMADS4	 pi 	Functional analysis of the rice AP3 homologue OsMADS16 by RNA interference	Our results demonstrate that OsMADS16 is an AP3/DEF orthologue to specify the identities of lodicules and stamens in rice flower and also support that OsMADS4 is a PI orthologue
OsMADS4	floral	Dwarf and deformed flower 1, encoding an F-box protein, is critical for vegetative and floral development in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Consistent with the mutant floral phenotype, DDF1 positively regulates B-class genes OsMADS4 and OsMADS16, and negatively regulates pistil specification gene DL
OsMADS4	stamen	Unequal genetic redundancy of rice PISTILLATA orthologs, OsMADS2 and OsMADS4, in lodicule and stamen development	Unequal genetic redundancy of rice PISTILLATA orthologs, OsMADS2 and OsMADS4, in lodicule and stamen development
OsMADS4	architecture	Divergent regulatory OsMADS2 functions control size, shape and differentiation of the highly derived rice floret second-whorl organ	The global architecture of transcripts regulated by OsMADS2 gives insights into the regulation of cell division and vascular differentiation that together can form this highly modified grass organ with important functions in floret opening and stamen emergence independent of the paralogous gene OsMADS4
OsMADS4	stamen	Double-stranded RNA interference of a rice PI/GLO paralog, OsMADS2, uncovers its second-whorl-specific function in floral organ patterning	Our data demonstrate its essential role in lodicule development and implicate the second PI/GLO paralog, OsMADS4, to suffice for stamen specification
