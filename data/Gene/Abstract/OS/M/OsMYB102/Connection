OsMYB102	OsNAP	The rice transcription factor OsMYB102 delays leaf senescence by downregulating abscisic acid accumulation and signaling.	 Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of OsMYB102 regulates the expression of SAGs, including genes associated with ABA degradation and ABA signaling (OsABF4, OsNAP, and OsCYP707A6), under dark-induced senescence conditions
OsMYB102	OsNAP	The rice transcription factor OsMYB102 delays leaf senescence by downregulating abscisic acid accumulation and signaling.	 OsMYB102 also indirectly represses ABA-responsive genes, such as OsABF4 and OsNAP
