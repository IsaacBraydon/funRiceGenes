OsMLH3	development	Rice MutL¦Ã, the MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer, participates in the formation of type I crossovers and regulation of embryo sac fertility	 OsMLH3 and OsMLH1 (MutL-homolog 1) interact to form a heterodimer (MutL¦Ã) to promote crossover formation in the macrospore and microspore mother cells and development of functional megaspore during meiosis, defective OsMLH3 or OsMLH1 in fsv1 and CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout lines results in reduced type I crossover and bivalent frequency
OsMLH3	map-based cloning	Rice MutL¦Ã, the MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer, participates in the formation of type I crossovers and regulation of embryo sac fertility	 Through map-based cloning and functional analyses, we isolated the causal gene of fsv1, OsMLH3 encoding a MutL-homolog 3 protein, an ortholog of HvMLH3 in barley and AtMLH3 in Arabidopsis
OsMLH3	microspore	Rice MutL¦Ã, the MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer, participates in the formation of type I crossovers and regulation of embryo sac fertility	 OsMLH3 and OsMLH1 (MutL-homolog 1) interact to form a heterodimer (MutL¦Ã) to promote crossover formation in the macrospore and microspore mother cells and development of functional megaspore during meiosis, defective OsMLH3 or OsMLH1 in fsv1 and CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout lines results in reduced type I crossover and bivalent frequency
