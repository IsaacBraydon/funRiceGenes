Monosaccharides transporters play important roles in assimilate supply for sink tissue development. In this study, a new monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST6 was identified from rice (Oryza sativa L.). The predicted OsMST6 protein shows typical features of sugar transporters and shares 79.6% identity with the rice monosaccharide transporter OsMST3. Heterologous expression in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) demonstrated that OsMST6 is a broad-spectrum monosaccharide transporter, with a K (m) of 266.1 muMu for glucose. OsMST6-green fluorescent protein fusion protein is localized to the plasma membrane in plant. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis exhibited that OsMST6 is expressed in all tested organs/tissues. In developing seeds, OsMST6 expression level is high at the early and middle grain filling stages and gradually declines later. Further analysis detected its expression in both maternal and filial tissues. RNA in situ hybridization analysis indicated that OsMST6 is predominantly expressed in the vascular parenchyma of the chalazal vein, cross-cells, nucellar tissue and endosperm of young seeds, in mesophyll cells of source leaf blades, and in pollens and the connective vein of anthers. In addition, OsMST6 expression is up-regulated by salt stress and sugars. The physiological role of OsMST6 for seed development and its roles in other sink and source tissues are discussed.
NA	Gene Expression Dynamics in Rice Peduncles at the Heading Stage	2020	Front Genet	Grass Genetics and Informatics Group, School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.	Improving grain yield in the staple food crop rice has been long sought goal of plant biotechnology. One of the traits with significant impact on rice breeding programs is peduncle elongation at the time of heading failing which leads to significant reduction in grain yield due to incomplete panicle exsertion. To decipher transcriptional dynamics and molecular players underlying peduncle elongation, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of elongating and non-elongating peduncles in two Indian cultivars, Swarna and Pokkali, at the time of heading. Along with genes associated with cell division and cell wall biosynthesis, we observed significant enrichment of genes associated with auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis/signaling in the elongating peduncles before heading in both the genotypes. Similarly, genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and mobilization, abiotic stress response along with cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene biosynthesis/signaling were enriched in non-elongating peduncles post heading. Significant enrichment of genes belonging to key transcription factor families highlights their specialized roles in peduncle elongation and grain filling before and after heading, respectively. A comparison with anther/pollen development-related genes provided 76 candidates with overlapping roles in anther/pollen development and peduncle elongation. Some of these are important for carbohydrate remobilization to the developing grains. These can be engineered to combat with incomplete panicle exsertion in male sterile lines and manipulate carbohydrate dynamics in grasses. Overall, this study provides baseline information about potential target genes for engineering peduncle elongation with implications on plant height, biomass composition and grain yields in rice.
NA	OsRRM, an RNA-Binding Protein, Modulates Sugar Transport in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	2020	Front Plant Sci	Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Key Laboratory of Crop Genomics and Molecular Breeding of Jiangsu Province, Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology of Jiangsu Province, College of Agriculture, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.	Sugar allocation between vegetative and reproductive tissues is vital to plant development, and sugar transporters play fundamental roles in this process. Although several transcription factors have been identified that control their transcription levels, the way in which the expression of sugar transporter genes is controlled at the posttranscriptional level is unknown. In this study, we showed that OsRRM, an RNA-binding protein, modulates sugar allocation in tissues on the source-to-sink route. The OsRRM expression pattern partly resembles that of several sugar transporter and transcription factor genes that specifically affect sugar transporter gene expression. The messenger RNA levels of almost all of the sugar transporter genes are severely reduced in the osrrm mutant, and this alters sugar metabolism and sugar signaling, which further affects plant height, flowering time, seed size, and starch synthesis. We further showed that OsRRM binds directly to messenger RNAs encoded by sugar transporter genes and thus may stabilize their transcripts. Therefore, we have uncovered the physiological function of OsRRM, which sheds new light on sugar metabolism and sugar signaling.
NA	A Heat Stress Responsive NAC Transcription Factor Heterodimer Plays Key Roles in Rice Grain Filling	2021	J Exp Bot	College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	High temperature often leads to the failure of grain filling in rice (Oryza sativa) to cause yield loss, while the mechanism is not well elucidated yet. Here, we report that two seed-specific NAM/ATAF/CUC domain transcription factors, ONAC127 and ONAC129, are responsive to heat stress and involved in the grain filling process of rice. ONAC127 and ONAC129 are dominantly expressed in the pericarp and can form a heterodimer during rice grain filling. CRISPR/Cas9 induced mutants and overexpression lines were then generated to investigate the functions of these two transcription factors. Interestingly, both knock-out and overexpression plants showed incomplete grain filling and shrunken grains, which became more severe under heat stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed that ONAC127 and ONAC129 mainly regulate stimulus response and nutrient transport. ChIP-seq analysis identified that the direct targets of ONAC127 and ONAC129 in developing rice seeds include monosaccharide transporter OsMST6, sugar transporter OsSWEET4, calmodulin-like protein OsMSR2 and AP2/ERF factor OsEATB. These results suggest that ONAC127 and ONAC129 may regulate grain filling through affecting sugar transportation and abiotic stress responses. Overall, this study demonstrates a transcriptional regulatory network involving ONAC127 and ONAC129 and coordinating multiple pathways to modulate seed development and heat stress response at rice reproductive stage.
