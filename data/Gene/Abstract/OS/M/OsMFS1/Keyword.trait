OsMFS1	development	OsMFS1/OsHOP2 Complex Participates in Rice Male and Female Development.	 Taken together, our results indicated that OsMFS1 is indispensable to the normal development of anther and embryo sacs in rice
OsMFS1	pollen	OsMFS1/OsHOP2 Complex Participates in Rice Male and Female Development.	 Here, we characterized a completely sterile Osmfs1 (male and female sterility 1) mutant which has its pollen and embryo sacs both aborted at the reproductive stage due to severe chromosome defection
OsMFS1	anther	OsMFS1/OsHOP2 Complex Participates in Rice Male and Female Development.	 Taken together, our results indicated that OsMFS1 is indispensable to the normal development of anther and embryo sacs in rice
OsMFS1	sterility	OsMFS1/OsHOP2 Complex Participates in Rice Male and Female Development.	 Here, we characterized a completely sterile Osmfs1 (male and female sterility 1) mutant which has its pollen and embryo sacs both aborted at the reproductive stage due to severe chromosome defection
OsMFS1	map-based cloning	OsMFS1/OsHOP2 Complex Participates in Rice Male and Female Development.	 Map-based cloning revealed that the OsMFS1 encodes a meiotic coiled-coil protein, and it is responsible for DSB repairing that acts as an important cofactor to stimulate the single strand invasion
OsMFS1	reproductive	OsMFS1/OsHOP2 Complex Participates in Rice Male and Female Development.	 Here, we characterized a completely sterile Osmfs1 (male and female sterility 1) mutant which has its pollen and embryo sacs both aborted at the reproductive stage due to severe chromosome defection
OsMFS1	nucleus	OsMFS1/OsHOP2 Complex Participates in Rice Male and Female Development.	 Subcellular localization analysis of OsMFS1 revealed its association with the nucleus exclusively
OsMFS1	meiosis	OsMFS1/OsHOP2 Complex Participates in Rice Male and Female Development.	 Expression pattern analyses showed the OsMFS1 was preferentially expressed in meiosis stage
OsMFS1	sterile	OsMFS1/OsHOP2 Complex Participates in Rice Male and Female Development.	 Here, we characterized a completely sterile Osmfs1 (male and female sterility 1) mutant which has its pollen and embryo sacs both aborted at the reproductive stage due to severe chromosome defection
OsMFS1	meiotic	OsMFS1/OsHOP2 Complex Participates in Rice Male and Female Development.	 Map-based cloning revealed that the OsMFS1 encodes a meiotic coiled-coil protein, and it is responsible for DSB repairing that acts as an important cofactor to stimulate the single strand invasion
OsMFS1	male sterility	OsMFS1/OsHOP2 Complex Participates in Rice Male and Female Development.	 Here, we characterized a completely sterile Osmfs1 (male and female sterility 1) mutant which has its pollen and embryo sacs both aborted at the reproductive stage due to severe chromosome defection
OsMFS1	homologous recombination	OsMFS1/OsHOP2 Complex Participates in Rice Male and Female Development.	 In addition, a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and pull-down assay showed that OsMFS1 could physically interact with OsHOP2 protein to form a stable complex to ensure faithful homologous recombination
