OsMADS13	OsMADS21	The D-lineage MADS-box gene OsMADS13 controls ovule identity in rice	OsMADS21 is most likely to be a paralog of OsMADS13, although its expression is not restricted to ovules
OsMADS13	OsMADS21	The D-lineage MADS-box gene OsMADS13 controls ovule identity in rice	Furthermore, combining the osmads13 and the osmads21 mutants did not result in any additive ovule defect, indicating that osmads21 does not control ovule identity
