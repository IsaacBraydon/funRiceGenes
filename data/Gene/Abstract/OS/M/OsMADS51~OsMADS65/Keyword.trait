OsMADS51|OsMADS65	flower	OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a	In SDs OsMADS51 null mutants flowered 2 weeks later than normal, whereas in long days loss of OsMADS51 had little effect on flowering
OsMADS51|OsMADS65	flower	OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a	Ectopic expression of OsMADS51 caused flowering to occur about 7 d earlier only in SDs
OsMADS51|OsMADS65	flower	OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a	These results indicate that OsMADS51 is a flowering promoter, particularly in SDs, and that this gene functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a
OsMADS51|OsMADS65	flower	OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a	In summary, OsMADS51 is a novel flowering promoter that transmits a SD promotion signal from OsGI to Ehd1
OsMADS51|OsMADS65	flower	OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a	OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a
OsMADS51|OsMADS65	heading date	OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice	The expression of Hd3a and FTL decreased in these transgenic plants, whereas the expression of Hd1, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), OsMADS51, and OsMADS50 did not significantly change
OsMADS51|OsMADS65	flower	Rice Indeterminate 1 (OsId1) is necessary for the expression of Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) regardless of photoperiod	In rice, the expression of Ehd1 is also controlled by the photoperiodic flowering genes OsGI (a rice ortholog of GI) and OsMADS51
