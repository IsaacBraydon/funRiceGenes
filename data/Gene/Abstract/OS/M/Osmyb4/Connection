Osmyb1	Osmyb4	Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed	In seed, the mRNA levels of Osmyb1 and Osmyb4 genes reached a maximum at 14 days after flowering (DAF), suggesting that these genes may play a role in seed maturation
Osmyb4	OsNHX1	OsbZIP71, a bZIP transcription factor, confers salinity and drought tolerance in rice	Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the abiotic stress-related genes, OsVHA-B, OsNHX1, COR413-TM1, and OsMyb4, were up-regulated in overexpressing lines, while these same genes were down-regulated in RNAi lines
OsmiR528	Osmyb4	OsmiR528 Enhances Cold Stress Tolerance by Repressing Expression of Stress Response-related Transcription Factor Genes in Plant Cells.	To investigate the potential mechanism of OsmiR528 in increasing cold stress tolerance, we examined expression of stress-associated MYB transcription factors OsGAMYB-like1, OsMYBS3, OsMYB4, OsMYB3R-2, OsMYB5, OsMYB59, OsMYB30, OsMYB1R, and OsMYB20 in rice cells by qRT-PCR
