Its overexpression in Arabidopsis thaliana plants increases biotic and abiotic stress tolerance and results in the accumulation of several metabolites, essential in defence response. The heterologous expression of the Myb4 transcription factor represents a promising potential approach to improve stress tolerance in crops, avoiding endogenous mechanisms that often co-suppress the transgene of interest. In order to explore the potential of the Osmyb4 gene to enhance tolerance toward multiple stresses in different host plant genomes, we generated transgenic tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. Tondino) plants. Like Arabidopsis, tomato plants overexpressing Osmyb4 acquired a higher tolerance to drought stress and to virus disease. However, the transgenic plants did not appear to be more cold tolerant than the WT, in any tested condition. The data obtained indicate that the specificity and the degree of Osmyb4 activity depend on the host genomic background.

Three elements in the promoter of rice glutelin genes are important for their endosperm specific expression. One of these, an AACA motif, has been shown to be a negative regulator in non-seed tissues and has a similarity to the barley gibberellin responsive element recognized by MYB-like DNA binding proteins. A cDNA library constructed from immature rice seed was screened using two types of myb gene probes to isolate cDNA clones representing genes encoding MYB-like DNA binding proteins that may recognize the AACA motif in rice glutelin gene promoter. We obtained four cDNA clones encoding MYB-related proteins, Oryza sativa MYB (OSMYB) 1-4, using the maize C1 probe. Another myb-like clone, Osmyb5, was obtained by screening a rice seed cDNA library with probes designed to recognize the AACA-like binding domain in GAMYB and PHMYB3. RT-PCR was used to analyze Osmyb expression during rice seed development and their presence in other rice tissues, as it was not possible to detect these mRNAs by conventional Northern analysis. RT-PCR analysis showed that Osmyb2, Osmyb3 and Osmyb5 genes were expressed in all tissues examined. In seed, the mRNA levels of Osmyb1 and Osmyb4 genes reached a maximum at 14 days after flowering (DAF), suggesting that these genes may play a role in seed maturation. As Osmyb5 exhibits a high similarity to the regions in both GAMYB and PHMYB3, which can bind to the AACA motif, there is a possibility that the OSMYB5 protein may bind to the AACA motif of glutelin genes.
1-s2.0-S0885576507000021-main.pdf	The ectopic expression of the rice Osmyb4 gene in Arabidopsis increases tolerance to abiotic, environmental and biotic stresses	2006	Physiological and Molecular Plant Pathology	Dipartimento Ambiente, Salute, Sicurezza, UniversitÃ  degli Studi dellâ€™Insubria, via J. H. Dunant 3, 21100 Varese, Italy	The Osmyb4 rice gene encodes a Myb transcription factor involved in cold acclimation. Its constitutive expression in Arabidopsis thaliana results in improved cold and freezing tolerance. Osmyb4 up-regulated 254 genes, 22% of which encode proteins involved in gene expression regulation and signal transduction, suggesting an upstream role of Myb4 in stress response. Most of the up-regulated genes are known to be involved in tolerance not only to cold, but also to other abiotic and environmental stresses (drought, salt, oxidative stresses). Moreover, a high proportion has known functions in resistance to pathogen attacks. Therefore, we analyzed the biochemical and physiological differences between Osmyb4-expressing and wild-type plants and found increased levels of several amino acids that are involved in stress adaptation, acting as osmolytes, scavengers and/or metabolite precursors. When exposed to different adverse conditions, namely drought, salt, u.v., ozone, viruses, bacteria and fungi, transgenic plants effectively demonstrated improved tolerance/resistance to all these stress conditions, suggesting that Osmyb4 represents a crucial knot in the cross-talk of stress signalling cascades through the activation of multiple components.

The constitutive expression of the rice Osmyb4 gene in Arabidopsis plants gives rise to enhanced abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, probably by activating several stress-inducible pathways. However, the effect of Osmyb4 on stress tolerance likely depends on the genetic background of the transformed species. In this study, we explored the potential of Osmyb4 to enhance the cold and freezing tolerance of Osteospermum ecklonis, an ornamental and perennial plant native to South Africa, because of an increasing interest in growing this species in Europe where winter temperatures are low. Transgenic O. ecklonis plants were obtained through transformation with the Osmyb4 rice gene under the control of the CaMV35S promoter. We examined the phenotypic adaptation of transgenic plants to cold and freezing stress. We also analysed the ability of wild-type and transgenic Osteospermum to accumulate several solutes, such as proline, amino acids and sugars. Using nuclear magnetic resonance, we outlined the metabolic profile of this species under normal growth conditions and under stress for the first time. Indeed, we found that overexpression of Osmyb4 improved the cold and freezing tolerance and produced changes in metabolite accumulation, especially of sugars and proline. Based on our data, it could be of agronomic and economic interest to use this gene to produce Osteospermum plants capable of growing in open field, even during the winter season in climatic zone Z9.
10.1007-s13353-011-0081-x.pdf	The rice Osmyb4 gene enhances tolerance to frost and improves germination under unfavourable conditions in transgenic barley plants	2012	J Appl Genet	Agricultural Institute, Centre for Agricultural Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, 2462, Martonvasar, Brunszvik u. 2, Hungary.	The Osmyb4 rice gene, coding for a transcription factor, proved to be efficient against different abiotic stresses as a trans(cis)gene in several plant species, although the effectiveness was dependent on the host genomic background. Eight barley transgenic lines carrying the rice Osmyb4 gene under the control of the Arabidopsis cold inducible promoter cor15a were produced to test the efficiency of this gene in barley. After a preliminary test, the best performing lines were subjected to freezing at -11 degrees C and -12 degrees C. Frost tolerance was assessed measured the F(v)/F(m) parameter widely used to indicate the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry in the dark adapted state. Three transgenic lines showed significantly increased tolerance. These selected lines were further studied under a complex stress applying cold and hypoxia at germinating stage. In these conditions the three selected transgenic lines outperformed the wild type barley in terms of germination vigour. The transgenic plants also showed a significant modification of their metabolism under cold/hypoxia conditions as demonstrated through the assessment of the activity of key enzymes involved in anoxic stress response. None of the transgenic lines showed dwarfism, just a slight retarded growth. These results provide evidence that the cold dependent expression of Osmyb4 can efficiently improved frost tolerance and germination vigour at low temperature without deleterious effect on plant growth.
10.1134-S1021443711060070.pdf	Response of transgenic rape plants bearing the Osmyb4 gene from rice encoding a trans-factor to low above-zero temperature	2011	Russian Journal of Plant Physiology	Peopleâ€™s Friedenship University, Moscow, Russia	Accumulation of soluble sugars (sucrose, fructose, and glucose), proline, phenols (total phenols and flavonoids), and antocyanins during adaptation to low-temperature stress (4Â°C) of two lines of spring rape (Brassica napus L., cv. Westar) characterized by weak (Bn-1) and strong (Bn-3) expression of the Osmyb4 transgene was studied. Vegetatively propagated transgenic and wild-type plants were grown in the hydroponic culture at 24Â°C; at the stage of 5â€<U+393C><U+3E33>6 leaves, plants were exposed to 4Â°C for 5 days and then returned to the optimum temperature of 24Â°C for recovery. Transgenic plants were established to manifest improved cold and frost tolerance, which was evident from more active biomass accumulation at 4Â°C as compared with wild-type plants and from sustaining their viability after 2-day-long exposure to âˆ<U+393C><U+3E32>6Â°C. Determination of MDA content showed that one of the reasons of their improved cold tolerance was their capability of maintaining oxidative homeostasis under low-temperature stress. This suggestion is supported by intense accumulation of phenols and antocyanins, manifesting pronounced antioxidant effects, by transgenic plants during their cold adaptation. Thus, during 2â€<U+393C><U+3E33>5 days of plant exposure to 4Â°C, in transgenic plants the total content of phenols increased by 2.6â€<U+393C><U+3E33>3.7 times, flavonoids â€<U+393C><U+3E34> by 3.7â€<U+393C><U+3E33>4.7 times, and antocyanins â€<U+393C><U+3E34> by 3.5â€<U+393C><U+3E33>5.3 times as compared with control plants growing at 24Â°C. Transgenic Bn-3 plants with strong expression of the Osmyb4 gene accumulated phenols and antocyanins at 4Â°C more actively than Bn-1 plants characterized by weak expression of this gene. Transgenic rape plants subjected to cold stress accumulated more proline, manifesting stress-protection effects, and lesser accumulation of soluble sugars. Before the beginning of experiment, the content of soluble sugars was approximately similar in wild-type plants and transgenic lines; at 4Â°C their level in transgenic plants was substantially lower than in control plants. As distinct from the process of cold adaptation, during recovery, the content of all tested stress-protection compounds dropped sharply. The results obtained indicate that active expression of the Osmyb4 gene from rice in the rape plants was accompanied not only by accumulation of compatible osmolytes but also by biosynthesis of antioxidants of phenolic nature.

The R2R3-type OsMyb4 transcription factor of rice has been shown to play a role in the regulation of osmotic adjustment in heterologous overexpression studies. However, the exact composition and organization of its underlying transcriptional network has not been established to be a robust tool for stress tolerance enhancement by regulon engineering. OsMyb4 network was dissected based on commonalities between the global chilling stress transcriptome and the transcriptome configured by OsMyb4 overexpression. OsMyb4 controls a hierarchical network comprised of several regulatory sub-clusters associated with cellular defense and rescue, metabolism and development. It regulates target genes either directly or indirectly through intermediary MYB, ERF, bZIP, NAC, ARF and CCAAT-HAP transcription factors. Regulatory sub-clusters have different combinations of MYB-like, GCC-box-like, ERD1-box-like, ABRE-like, G-box-like, as1/ocs/TGA-like, AuxRE-like, gibberellic acid response element (GARE)-like and JAre-like cis-elements. Cold-dependent network activity enhanced cellular antioxidant capacity through radical scavenging mechanisms and increased activities of phenylpropanoid and isoprenoid metabolic processes involving various abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), ethylene and reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsive genes. OsMyb4 network is independent of drought response element binding protein/C-repeat binding factor (DREB/CBF) and its sub-regulons operate with possible co-regulators including nuclear factor-Y. Because of its upstream position in the network hierarchy, OsMyb4 functions quantitatively and pleiotrophically. Supra-optimal expression causes misexpression of alternative targets with costly trade-offs to panicle development.
j.1365-313X.2003.01938.x.pdf	Overexpression of the rice Osmyb4 gene increases chilling and freezing tolerance of Arabidopsis thaliana plants	2004	Plant J	Dipartimento di Biologia Strutturale e Funzionale, Universita dell'Insubria, via J.H. Dunant 3, 21100 Varese, Italy.	The expression of the gene Osmyb4, detected at low level in rice (Oryza sativa) coleoptiles grown for 3 days at 29 degrees C, is strongly induced by treatments at 4 degrees C. At sublethal temperatures of 10 and 15 degrees C, its expression in rice seedlings is already evident, but this effect cannot be vicariated by other stresses or ABA treatment. We demonstrate by transient expression that Myb4 transactivates the PAL2, ScD9 SAD and COR15a cold-inducible promoters. The Osmyb4 function in vivo is demonstrated overexpressing its cDNA in Arabidopsis thaliana plants (ecotype Wassilewskija) under the control of the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter. Myb4 overexpressing plants show a significant increased cold and freezing tolerance, measured as membrane or Photosystem II (PSII) stability and as whole plant tolerance. Finally, in Osmyb4 transgenic plants, the expression of genes participating in different cold-induced pathways is affected, suggesting that Myb4 represents a master switch in cold tolerance.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs11103-013-0115-3.pdf	OsbZIP71, a bZIP transcription factor, confers salinity and drought tolerance in rice	2014	Plant Mol Biol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	The bZIP transcription factor (TF) family plays an important role in the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway of abiotic stress in plants. We here report the cloning and characterization of OsbZIP71, which encodes a rice bZIP TF. Functional analysis showed that OsbZIP71 is a nuclear-localized protein that specifically binds to the G-box motif, but has no transcriptional activity both in yeast and rice protoplasts. In yeast two-hybrid assays, OsbZIP71 can form both homodimers and heterodimers with Group C members of the bZIP gene family. Expression of OsbZIP71 was strongly induced by drought, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and ABA treatments, but repressed by salt treatment. OsbZIP71 overexpressing (p35S::OsbZIP71) rice significantly improved tolerance to drought, salt and PEG osmotic stresses. In contrast, RNAi knockdown transgenic lines were much more sensitive to salt, PEG osmotic stresses, and also ABA treatment. Inducible expression (RD29A::OsbZIP71) lines were significantly improved their tolerance to PEG osmotic stresses, but hypersensitivity to salt, and insensitivity to ABA. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the abiotic stress-related genes, OsVHA-B, OsNHX1, COR413-TM1, and OsMyb4, were up-regulated in overexpressing lines, while these same genes were down-regulated in RNAi lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that OsbZIP71 directly binds the promoters of OsNHX1 and COR413-TM1 in vivo. These results suggest that OsbZIP71 may play an important role in ABA-mediated drought and salt tolerance in rice.
