Ma-2009-Enhanced tolerance t.pdf	Enhanced tolerance to chilling stress in OsMYB3R-2 transgenic rice is mediated by alteration in cell cycle and ectopic expression of stress genes	2009	Plant Physiol	Research Center for Molecular and Developmental Biology, Key Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Environmental Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	MYB transcription factors play central roles in plant responses to abiotic stresses. How stress affects development is poorly understood. Here, we show that OsMYB3R-2 functions in both stress and developmental processes in rice (Oryza sativa). Transgenic plants overexpressing OsMYB3R-2 exhibited enhanced cold tolerance. Cold treatment greatly induced the expression of OsMYB3R-2, which encodes an active transcription factor. We show that OsMYB3R-2 specifically bound to a mitosis-specific activator cis-element, (T/C)C(T/C)AACGG(T/C)(T/C)A, a conserved sequence that was found in promoters of cyclin genes such as OsCycB1;1 and OsKNOLLE2. In addition, overexpression of OsMYB3R-2 in rice led to higher transcript levels of several G2/M phase-specific genes, including OsCycB1;1, OsCycB2;1, OsCycB2;2, and OsCDC20.1, than those in OsMYB3R-2 antisense lines or wild-type plants in response to cold treatment. Flow cytometry analysis revealed an increased cell mitotic index in overexpressed transgenic lines of OsMYB3R-2 after cold treatment. Furthermore, resistance to cold stress in the transgenic plants overexpressing OsCycB1;1 was also enhanced. The level of cellular free proline was increased in the overexpressed rice lines of OsMYB3R-2 and OsCycB1;1 transgenic plants compared with wild-type plants under the cold treatment. These results suggest that OsMYB3R-2 targets OsCycB1;1 and regulates the progress of the cell cycle during chilling stress. OsCPT1, which may be involved in the dehydration-responsive element-binding factor 1A pathway, showed the same transcription pattern in response to cold as did OsCycB1;1 in transgenic rice. Therefore, a cold resistance mechanism in rice could be mediated by regulating the cell cycle, which is controlled by key genes including OsMYB3R-2.

By transcript analyses, expression of OsCLC1 was found in leaves and roots. Transcriptional regulation during salt stress was compared in the salt-sensitive Clâˆ<U+393C><U+3E32>-accumulating rice line IR29 and the salt-tolerant Clâˆ<U+393C><U+3E32>-excluding rice line Pokkali. In response to salt stress OsCLC1 transcript levels were repressed in leaves and roots of IR29 whereas in Pokkali expression was transiently induced. Under same conditions, in IR29 mRNA levels of the Na+/H+ antiporter OsNHX1 and of the vacuolar H+-ATPase subunit OsVHA-B decreased upon salt stress whereas Pokkali showed transient stimulation of OsVHA-B transcripts. Cell-specificity of OsCLC1 transcription was analyzed by in situ PCR. In leaves, signals were detected in mesophyll cells and stomata. In addition, expression occurred in xylem parenchyma cells and in the phloem whereas in salt-treated plants transcript amounts were reduced in mesophyll cells. Our results indicate coordinated regulation of anion and cation homeostasis in salt-treated rice and suggest function of OsCLC1 in osmotic adjustment at high salinity.
