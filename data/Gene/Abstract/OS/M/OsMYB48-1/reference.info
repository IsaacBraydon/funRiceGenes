MYB-type transcription factors (TFs) play essential roles in plant growth, development and respond to environmental stresses. Role of MYB-related TFs of rice in drought stress tolerance is not well documented. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel MYB-related TF, OsMYB48-1, of rice. Expression of OsMYB48-1 was strongly induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG), abscisic acid (ABA), H2O2, and dehydration, while being slightly induced by high salinity and cold treatment. The OsMYB48-1 protein was localized in the nucleus with transactivation activity at the C terminus. Overexpression of OsMYB48-1 in rice significantly improved tolerance to simulated drought and salinity stresses caused by mannitol, PEG, and NaCl, respectively, and drought stress was caused by drying the soil. In contrast to wild type plants, the overexpression lines exhibited reduced rate of water loss, lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content and higher proline content under stress conditions. Moreover, overexpression plants were hypersensitive to ABA at both germination and post-germination stages and accumulated more endogenous ABA under drought stress conditions. Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of OsMYB48-1 could regulate the expression of some ABA biosynthesis genes (OsNCED4, OsNCED5), early signaling genes (OsPP2C68, OSRK1) and late responsive genes (RAB21, OsLEA3, RAB16C and RAB16D) under drought stress conditions. Collectively, these results suggested that OsMYB48-1 functions as a novel MYB-related TF which plays a positive role in drought and salinity tolerance by regulating stress-induced ABA synthesis.
NA	Characterization of transcription factor MYB59 and expression profiling in response to low K(+) and NO(3)(-) in indica rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2021	J Genet Eng Biotechnol	Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, 3114, Bangladesh.	BACKGROUND: Nitrogen and potassium are crucial supplements for plant development and growth. Plants can detect potassium and nitrate ions in soils and in like way, they modify root-to-shoot transport of these ions to adjust the conveyance among roots and shoots. Transcription factor MYB59 plays essential roles in numerous physiological processes inclusive of hormone response, abiotic stress tolerance, plant development, and metabolic regulation. In this study, we retrieved 56 MYB59 proteins from different plant species. Multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree, conserved motif, chromosomal localization, and cis-regulatory elements of the retrieved sequences were analyzed. Gene structure, protein 3D structure, and DNA binding of OsMYB59 indica were also predicted. Finally, we characterized OsMYB59 and its function under low K(+)/NO(3)(-) conditions in Oryza sativa subsp. indica. RESULTS: Data analysis showed that MYB59s from various groups separated in terms of conserved functional domains and gene structure, where members of genus Oryza clustered together. Plants showed reduced height and yellowish appearance when grown on K(+) and NO(3)(-) deficient medium. Quantitative real-time PCR uncovered that the OsMYB59 reacted to abiotic stresses where its expression was increased in BRRI dhan56 but decreased in other varieties on K(+) deficient medium. In addition, OsMYB59 transcript level increased on NO(3)(-) deficient medium. CONCLUSIONS: Our results can help to explain the biological functions of indica rice MYB59 protein and gave a theoretical premise to additionally describe its biological roles in response to abiotic stresses particularly drought.
