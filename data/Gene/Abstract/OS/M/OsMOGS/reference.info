NA	OsMOGS is required for N-glycan formation and auxin-mediated root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2014	The Plant Journal	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China	N-glycosylation is a major modification of glycoproteins in eukaryotic cells. In Arabidopsis, great progress has been made in functional analysis of N-glycan production, however there are few studies in monocotyledons. Here, we characterized a rice (Oryza sativa L.) osmogs mutant with shortened roots and isolated a gene that coded a putative mannosyl-oligosaccharide glucosidase (OsMOGS), an ortholog of ¦Á-glucosidase I in Arabidopsis, which trims the terminal glucosyl residue of the oligosaccharide chain of nascent peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). OsMOGS is strongly expressed in rapidly cell-dividing tissues and OsMOGS protein is localized in the ER. Mutation of OsMOGS entirely blocked N-glycan maturation and inhibited high-mannose N-glycan formation. The osmogs mutant exhibited severe defects in root cell division and elongation, resulting in a short-root phenotype. In addition, osmogs plants had impaired root hair formation and elongation, and reduced root epidemic cell wall thickness due to decreased cellulose synthesis. Further analysis showed that auxin content and polar transport in osmogs roots were reduced due to incomplete N-glycosylation of the B subfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporter proteins (ABCBs). Our results demonstrate that involvement of OsMOGS in N-glycan formation is required for auxin-mediated root development in rice.
