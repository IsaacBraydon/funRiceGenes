OsMTI-1b	Heterologous expression of a rice metallothionein isoform (OsMTI-1b) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae enhances cadmium, hydrogen peroxide and ethanol tolerance. |  The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of heterologous expression of a rice metallothionein isoform (OsMTI-1b) on the tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to Cd(2+), H(2)O(2) and ethanol stress |  The gene encoding OsMTI-1b was cloned into p426GPD as a yeast expression vector |  After verification of heterologous expression of OsMTI-1b, the new strain and control were grown under stress conditions |  In addition, the heterologous expression of GST-OsMTI-1b conferred H(2)O(2) and ethanol tolerance to S
