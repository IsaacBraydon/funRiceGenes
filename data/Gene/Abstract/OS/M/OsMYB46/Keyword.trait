OsMYB46	transcription factor	Transcriptional activation of secondary wall biosynthesis by rice and maize NAC and MYB transcription factors	It was also found that the rice and maize MYB transcription factors, OsMYB46 and ZmMYB46, are functional orthologs of Arabidopsis MYB46/MYB83 and, when overexpressed in Arabidopsis, they were able to activate the entire secondary wall biosynthetic program
