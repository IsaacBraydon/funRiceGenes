OsIG1	OsMADS6|MFO1	Down-regulation of a LBD-like gene, OsIG1, leads to occurrence of unusual double ovules and developmental abnormalities of various floral organs and megagametophyte in rice	Additionally, down-regulation of OsIG1 differentially affected the expression of genes associated with the floral organ development including EG1, OsMADS6 and OsMADS1.
OsEMF2b	OsMADS6|MFO1	The polycomb group gene EMF2B is essential for maintenance of floral meristem determinacy in rice	Transcriptome analysis identified the E-function genes OsMADS1, OsMADS6 and OsMADS34 as differentially expressed in the emf2b mutant compared with wild type.
OsEMF2b	OsMADS6|MFO1	The polycomb group gene EMF2B is essential for maintenance of floral meristem determinacy in rice	OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, known to be required for meristem determinacy in rice, have reduced expression in the emf2b mutant, whereas OsMADS34 which interacts genetically with OsMADS1 was ectopically expressed.
