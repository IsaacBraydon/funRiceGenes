In recent years, there have been reports on genomic localization, protein motif structure, phylogenetic relationships, gene structure and expression of the entire MADS-box family in the model plant system, Arabidopsis. Though there have been some studies in rice as well, an analysis of the complete MADS-box family along with a comprehensive expression profiling was still awaited after the completion of rice genome sequencing. Furthermore, owing to the role of MADS-box family in flower development, an analysis involving structure, expression and functional aspects of MADS-box genes in rice and Arabidopsis was required to understand the role of this gene family in reproductive development. RESULTS: A genome-wide molecular characterization and microarray-based expression profiling of the genes encoding MADS-box transcription factor family in rice is presented. Using a thorough annotation exercise, 75 MADS-box genes have been identified in rice and categorized into MIKCc, MIKC*, Malpha, Mbeta and Mgamma groups based on phylogeny. Chromosomal localization of these genes reveals that 16 MADS-box genes, mostly MIKCc-type, are located within the duplicated segments of the rice genome, whereas most of the M-type genes, 20 in all, seem to have resulted from tandem duplications. Nine members belonging to the Mbeta group, which was considered absent in monocots, have also been identified. The expression profiles of all the MADS-box genes have been analyzed under 11 temporal stages of panicle and seed development, three abiotic stress conditions, along with three stages of vegetative development. Transcripts for 31 genes accumulate preferentially in the reproductive phase, of which, 12 genes are specifically expressed in seeds, and six genes show expression specific to panicle development. Differential expression of seven genes under stress conditions is also evident. An attempt has been made to gain insight into plausible functions of rice MADS-box genes by collating the expression data of functionally validated genes in rice and Arabidopsis. CONCLUSION: Only a limited number of MADS genes have been functionally validated in rice. A comprehensive annotation and transcriptome profiling undertaken in this investigation adds to our understanding of the involvement of MADS-box family genes during reproductive development and stress in rice and also provides the basis for selection of candidate genes for functional validation studies.
cr2009143a.pdf	The AGL6-like gene OsMADS6 regulates floral organ and meristem identities in rice	2009	Cell Res	School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai 200240, China.	Although AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6) MADS-box genes are ancient with wide distributions in gymnosperms and angiosperms, their functions remain poorly understood. Here, we show the biological role of the AGL6-like gene, OsMADS6, in specifying floral organ and meristem identities in rice (Oryza sativa L.). OsMADS6 was strongly expressed in the floral meristem at early stages. Subsequently, OsMADS6 transcripts were mainly detectable in paleas, lodicules, carpels and the integument of ovule, as well as in the receptacle. Compared to wild type plants, osmads6 mutants displayed altered palea identity, extra glume-like or mosaic organs, abnormal carpel development and loss of floral meristem determinacy. Strikingly, mutation of a SEPALLATA (SEP)-like gene, OsMADS1 (LHS1), enhanced the defect of osmads6 flowers, and no inner floral organs or glume-like structures were observed in whorls 2 and 3 of osmads1-z osmads6-1 flowers. Furthermore, the osmads1-z osmads6-1 double mutants developed severely indeterminate floral meristems. Our finding, therefore, suggests that the ancient OsMADS6 gene is able to specify "floral state" by determining floral organ and meristem identities in monocot crop rice together with OsMADS1.
Duanyuanlin.pdf	Characterization of Osmads6-5, a null allele, reveals that OsMADS6 is a critical regulator for early flower development in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2012	Plant Mol Biol	Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Genetics, Breeding and Multiple Utilization of Crops, Fujian Agricultural & Forestry University, Fuzhou, China.	AGL6-clade genes are a subfamily of MADS-box genes and preferentially expressed in floral organs. OsMADS6 and OsMADS17 are two AGL6-like genes in rice. OsMADS17 has been shown to play a minor role in floral development and appears to result from a duplication of OsMADS6. OsMADS6 was initially named as MFO1 for mosaic floral organs based on its moderate mutant phenotypes. So far, four moderate or weak mutant alleles of OsMADS6 have been described, providing valuable insights into its role in flower development. Here, we report a null allele of OsMADS6 (Osmads6-5), which exhibited a strong mutant phenotype in spikelet without affecting vegetative traits, causing all floral organs except lemma homeotically transformed into lemma-like organs (LLOs) as well as an indeterminate floral meristem, thus resulting in a mutant floret consisting of reiterating whorls of lemma and LLOs. In consistently, over-expression of OsMADS6 led to additional lodicule-, stamen- and carpel-like organs. Expression analysis showed that OsMADS6 controls the formation of the incipient primordia of lodicule, stamen and carpel via regulating the expression of class B, C and SEP-like MADS-box genes. Taken together, our results revealed that OsMADS6 acts as a critical regulator for early flower development in rice and provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of OsMADS6.
j.1365-313X.2010.04354.x.pdf	OsMADS6 plays an essential role in endosperm nutrient accumulation and is subject to epigenetic regulation in rice (Oryza sativa)	2010	Plant J	Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mississippi State University, MS 39762, USA.	MADS-box transcription factors are known for their roles in plant growth and development. The regulatory mechanisms of spatial and temporal specific expression of MADS-box genes and the function of MADS-box genes in other biological processes are still to be explored. Here, we report that OsMADS6 is highly expressed in flower and endosperm in Oryza sativa (rice). In addition to displaying a homeotic organ identity phenotype in all the four whorls of the flowers, the endosperm development is severely affected in its mutant. At least 32% of the seeds lacked starch filling and aborted. For seeds that have starch filling and develop to maturity, the starch content is reduced by at least 13%. In addition, the seed shape changes from elliptical to roundish, and the protein content increases from 12.1 to 15.0% (P < 0.05). Further investigation shows that ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase genes, encoding the rate-limiting step enzyme in the starch synthesis pathway, are subject to the regulation of OsMADS6. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR analyses on the chromatin of the OsMADS6 gene find that H3K27 is trimethylated in tissues where OsMADS6 is silenced, and that H3K36 is trimethylated in tissues where OsMADS6 is highly activated. Point mutation analysis reveals that leucine at position 83 is critical to OsMADS6 function.
Plant Cell-2009-Ohmori-3008-25.pdf	MOSAIC FLORAL ORGANS1, an AGL6-like MADS box gene, regulates floral organ identity and meristem fate in rice	2009	Plant Cell	Rice Biotechnology Research Subteam (Hokuriku Region), National Agricultural Research Center, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, Niigata 943-0193, Japan.	Floral organ identity and meristem determinacy in plants are controlled by combinations of activities mediated by MADS box genes. AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6)-like genes are MADS box genes expressed in floral tissues, but their biological functions are mostly unknown. Here, we describe an AGL6-like gene in rice (Oryza sativa), MOSAIC FLORAL ORGANS1 (MFO1/MADS6), that regulates floral organ identity and floral meristem determinacy. In the flower of mfo1 mutants, the identities of palea and lodicule are disturbed, and mosaic organs were observed. Furthermore, the determinacy of the floral meristem was lost, and extra carpels or spikelets developed in mfo1 florets. The expression patterns of floral MADS box genes were disturbed in the mutant florets. Suppression of another rice AGL6-like gene, MADS17, caused no morphological abnormalities in the wild-type background, but it enhanced the phenotype in the mfo1 background, indicating that MADS17 has a minor but redundant function with that of MFO1. Whereas single mutants in either MFO1 or the SEPALLATA-like gene LHS1 showed moderate phenotypes, the mfo1 lhs1 double mutant showed a severe phenotype, including the loss of spikelet meristem determinacy. We propose that rice AGL6-like genes help to control floral organ identity and the establishment and determinacy of the floral meristem redundantly with LHS1.
Plant Cell-2011-Li-2536-52.pdf	Rice MADS6 interacts with the floral homeotic genes SUPERWOMAN1, MADS3, MADS58, MADS13, and DROOPING LEAF in specifying floral organ identities and meristem fate	2011	Plant Cell	Institute of Plant Science, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.	AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6) genes play essential roles in flower development, but whether and how they work with floral organ identity genes remain less understood. Here, we describe interactions of the rice (Oryza sativa) AGL6 gene MADS6 with other rice floral homeotic genes in flower development. Genetic analyses revealed that MADS6 specifies the identity of the three inner whorls and floral meristem determinacy redundantly with SUPERWOMAN1/MADS16 (B-gene) or MADS3 (C-gene). MADS6 was shown to define carpel/ovule development and floral determinacy by interacting with MADS13 (D-gene) and control the palea and floral meristem identities together with the YABBY gene DROOPING LEAF. Expression analyses revealed that the transcript levels of six B-, C-, and E-class genes were reduced in mads6-1 at the early flower developmental stage, suggesting that MADS6 is a key regulator of early flower development. Moreover, MADS6 can directly bind to a putative regulatory motif on MADS58 (C-gene), and mads6-1 mads58 displayed phenotypes similar to that of mads6-1. These results suggest that MADS6 is a key player in specifying flower development via interacting with other floral homeotic genes in rice, thus providing new insights into the mechanism by which flower development is controlled.
Plant Cell Physiol-2011-Yadav-2123-35.pdf	Auxin-responsive OsMGH3, a common downstream target of OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, controls rice floret fertility	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore-560012, India.	GH3 proteins control auxin homeostasis by inactivating excess auxin as conjugates of amino acids and sugars and thereby controlling cellular bioactive auxin. Since auxin regulates many aspects of plant growth and development, regulated expression of these genes offers a mechanism to control various developmental processes. OsMGH3/OsGH3-8 is expressed abundantly in rice florets and is regulated by two related and redundant transcription factors, OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, but its contribution to flower development is not known. We functionally characterize OsMGH3 by overexpression and knock-down analysis and show a partial overlap in these phenotypes with that of mutants in OsMADS1 and OsMADS6. The overexpression of OsMGH3 during the vegetative phase affects the overall plant architecture, whereas its inflorescence-specific overexpression creates short panicles with reduced branching, resembling in part the effects of OsMADS1 overexpression. In contrast, the down-regulation of endogenous OsMGH3 caused phenotypes consistent with auxin overproduction or activated signaling, such as ectopic rooting from aerial nodes. Florets in OsMGH3 knock-down plants were affected in carpel development and pollen viability, both of which reduced fertility. Some of these floret phenotypes are similar to osmads6 mutants. Taken together, we provide evidence for the functional significance of auxin homeostasis and its transcriptional regulation during rice panicle branching and floret organ development.

We used a transgenic approach and yeast two-hybrid experiments to study the role of the rice ( Oryza sativa L.) B-function MADS-box gene, OsMADS16. Transgenic rice plants were generated that ectopically expressed OsMADS16 under the control of the maize ( Zea mays L.) ubiquitin1 promoter. Microscopic observations revealed that the innermost-whorl carpels had been replaced by stamen-like organs, which resembled the flowers of the previously described Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. mutation superman as well as those ectopically expressing the AP3 gene. These results indicate that expression of OsMADS16 in the innermost whorl induces stamen development. Occasionally, carpels had completely disappeared. In addition, ectopic expression of OsMADS16 enhanced expression of OsMADS4, another B-function gene, causing superman phenotypes. In the yeast two-hybrid system, OsMADS16 did not form a homodimer but, rather, the protein interacted with OsMADS4. OsMADS16 also interacted with OsMADS6 and OSMADS8, both of which are homologous to SEPALLATA proteins required for the proper function of class-B and class-C genes in Arabidopsis. Based on the gene expression pattern and our yeast two-hybrid data, we discuss a quartet model of MADS-domain protein interactions in the lodicule and stamen whorls of rice florets.
NA	ABNORMAL FLOWER AND GRAIN 1 encodes OsMADS6 and determines palea identity and affects rice grain yield and quality.	2020	Sci China Life Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Center for Rice Improvement, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, China.	The palea and lemma are floral organ structures unique to grasses; these structures form the hull and directly affect grain size and quality. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the development of the hull are not well understood. In this study, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) abnormal flower and grain1 (afg1) mutant, a new allele of OsMADS6. Similar to previously characterized osmads6 alleles, in the afg1 floret, the palea lost its marginal region and acquired the lemma identity. However, in contrast to other osmads6 alleles, the afg1 mutant showed altered grain size and grain quality, with decreased total starch and amylose contents, and increased protein and soluble sugar contents. The analysis of transcriptional activity suggested that AFG1 is a transcriptional activator and may affect grain size by regulating the expression levels of several genes related to cell expansion and proliferation in the afg1 mutant. These results revealed that AFG1 plays an important role in determining palea identity and affecting grain yield and quality in rice.
