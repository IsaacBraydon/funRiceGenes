NA	Loss of function of pollen-expressed phospholipase OsMATL2 triggers haploid induction in japonica rice	2023	Plant Physiology	Department of Applied Plant Science, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 61186, Republic of Korea	To clarify the subcellular localization of OsMATL2, green fluorescence protein (GFP) was fused to the C-terminus of OsMATL2, and the cassette was expressed under the control of the native OsMATL2 promoter. Observation of rice root cells demonstrated a clear localization of OsMATL2 in the plasma membranes.
