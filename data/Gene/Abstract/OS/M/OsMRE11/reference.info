Mre11, a conserved protein found in organisms ranging from yeast to multicellular organisms, is required for normal meiotic recombination. Mre11 interacts with Rad50 and Nbs1/Xrs2 to form a complex (MRN/X) that participates in double-strand break (DSB) ends processing. In this study, we silenced the MRE11 gene in rice and detailed its function using molecular and cytological methods. The OsMRE11-deficient plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but could not set seed. Cytological analysis indicated that in the OsMRE11-deficient plants, homologous pairing was totally inhibited, and the chromosomes were completely entangled as a formation of multivalents at metaphase I, leading to the consequence of serious chromosome fragmentation during anaphase I. Immunofluorescence studies further demonstrated that OsMRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing but is dispensable for meiotic DSB formation. We found that OsMRE11 protein was located on meiotic chromosomes from interphase to late pachytene. This protein showed normal localization in zep1, Oscom1 and Osmer3, as well as in OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants, but not in pair2 and pair3 mutants. Taken together, our results provide evidence that OsMRE11 performs a function essential for maintaining the normal HR process and inhibiting non-homologous recombination during meiosis.
NA	OsMre11 Is Required for Mitosis during Rice Growth and Development	2020	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China.	Meiotic recombination 11 (Mre11) is a relatively conserved nuclease in various species. Mre11 plays important roles in meiosis and DNA damage repair in yeast, humans and Arabidopsis, but little research has been done on mitotic DNA replication and repair in rice. Here, it was found that Mre11 was an extensively expressed gene among the various tissues and organs of rice, and loss-of-function of Mre11 resulted in severe defects of vegetative and reproductive growth, including dwarf plants, abnormally developed male and female gametes, and completely abortive seeds. The decreased number of cells in the apical meristem and the appearance of chromosomal fragments and bridges during the mitotic cell cycle in rice mre11 mutant roots revealed an essential role of OsMre11. Further research showed that DNA replication was suppressed, and a large number of DNA strand breaks occurred during the mitotic cell cycle of rice mre11 mutants. The expression of OsMre11 was up-regulated with the treatment of hydroxyurea and methyl methanesulfonate. Moreover, OsMre11 could form a complex with OsRad50 and OsNbs1, and they might function together in non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination repair pathways. These results indicated that OsMre11 plays vital roles in DNA replication and damage repair of the mitotic cell cycle, which ensure the development and fertility of rice by maintaining genome stability.
