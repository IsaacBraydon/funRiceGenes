OsMRE11	meiosis	MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis	 Taken together, our results provide evidence that OsMRE11 performs a function essential for maintaining the normal HR process and inhibiting non-homologous recombination during meiosis
OsMRE11	meiotic	MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis	 Immunofluorescence studies further demonstrated that OsMRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing but is dispensable for meiotic DSB formation
OsMRE11	meiotic	MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis	 We found that OsMRE11 protein was located on meiotic chromosomes from interphase to late pachytene
OsMRE11	seed	MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis	 The OsMRE11-deficient plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but could not set seed
OsMRE11	growth	MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis	 The OsMRE11-deficient plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but could not set seed
OsMRE11	vegetative	MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis	 The OsMRE11-deficient plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but could not set seed
