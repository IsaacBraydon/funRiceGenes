OsMRE11	meiosis	MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis	Taken together, our results provide evidence that OsMRE11 performs a function essential for maintaining the normal HR process and inhibiting non-homologous recombination during meiosis
OsMRE11	meiotic	MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis	Immunofluorescence studies further demonstrated that OsMRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing but is dispensable for meiotic DSB formation
OsMRE11	meiotic	MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis	We found that OsMRE11 protein was located on meiotic chromosomes from interphase to late pachytene
OsMRE11	seed	MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis	The OsMRE11-deficient plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but could not set seed
OsMRE11	growth	MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis	The OsMRE11-deficient plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but could not set seed
OsMRE11	vegetative	MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis	The OsMRE11-deficient plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but could not set seed
OsMRE11	growth	OsMre11 Is Required for Mitosis during Rice Growth and Development	OsMre11 Is Required for Mitosis during Rice Growth and Development
OsMRE11	development	OsMre11 Is Required for Mitosis during Rice Growth and Development	OsMre11 Is Required for Mitosis during Rice Growth and Development
OsMRE11	development	OsMre11 Is Required for Mitosis during Rice Growth and Development	 These results indicated that OsMre11 plays vital roles in DNA replication and damage repair of the mitotic cell cycle, which ensure the development and fertility of rice by maintaining genome stability
OsMRE11	fertility	OsMre11 Is Required for Mitosis during Rice Growth and Development	 These results indicated that OsMre11 plays vital roles in DNA replication and damage repair of the mitotic cell cycle, which ensure the development and fertility of rice by maintaining genome stability
OsMRE11	meristem	OsMre11 Is Required for Mitosis during Rice Growth and Development	 The decreased number of cells in the apical meristem and the appearance of chromosomal fragments and bridges during the mitotic cell cycle in rice mre11 mutant roots revealed an essential role of OsMre11
OsMRE11	mitosis	OsMre11 Is Required for Mitosis during Rice Growth and Development	OsMre11 Is Required for Mitosis during Rice Growth and Development
OsMRE11	cell cycle	OsMre11 Is Required for Mitosis during Rice Growth and Development	 The decreased number of cells in the apical meristem and the appearance of chromosomal fragments and bridges during the mitotic cell cycle in rice mre11 mutant roots revealed an essential role of OsMre11
OsMRE11	cell cycle	OsMre11 Is Required for Mitosis during Rice Growth and Development	 These results indicated that OsMre11 plays vital roles in DNA replication and damage repair of the mitotic cell cycle, which ensure the development and fertility of rice by maintaining genome stability
OsMRE11	homologous recombination	OsMre11 Is Required for Mitosis during Rice Growth and Development	 Moreover, OsMre11 could form a complex with OsRad50 and OsNbs1, and they might function together in non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination repair pathways
