OsMYB91	SLR1|OsGAI	The R2R3-type MYB gene OsMYB91 has a function in coordinating plant growth and salt stress tolerance in rice.	More interestingly, SLR1, the rice homolog of Arabidopsis DELLA genes that have been shown to integrate endogenous developmental signals with adverse environmental conditions, was highly induced by OsMYB91 over-expression, while the salt-induction of SLR1 expression was impaired in the RNAi plants
OsMYB91	SLR1|OsGAI	The R2R3-type MYB gene OsMYB91 has a function in coordinating plant growth and salt stress tolerance in rice.	These results suggested that OsMYB91 was a stress-responsive gene that might be involved in coordinating rice tolerance to abiotic stress and plant growth by regulating SLR1 expression
