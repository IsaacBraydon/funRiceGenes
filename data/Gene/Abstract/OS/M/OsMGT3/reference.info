NA	Diel magnesium fluctuations in chloroplasts contribute to photosynthesis in rice 	2020	Nat Plants	  Root Biology Center, College of Life Science, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China.	Photosynthesis provides food, fibre and fuel that support our society; understanding the mechanisms controlling dynamic changes in this process helps identify new options to improve photosynthesis. Photosynthesis shows diel changes, which have been largely attributed to external light/dark conditions, as well as internal gene expression and the post-translational modification of critical enzymes. Here we report diel fluctuations of magnesium (Mg) in rice (Oryza sativa) chloroplasts, which may function as a rhythm regulator contributing to the post-translational regulation of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation in rice. We found that a chloroplast-localized Mg2+ transporter gene, OsMGT3, which is rhythmically expressed in leaf mesophyll cells, partly modulates Mg fluctuations in rice chloroplasts. Knockout of OsMGT3 substantially reduced Mg2+ uptake, as well as the amplitude of free Mg2+ fluctuations in chloroplasts, which was closely associated with a decrease in ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase activity in vivo and a consequent decline in the photosynthetic rate. In addition, the mesophyll-specific overexpression of OsMGT3 remarkably improved photosynthetic efficiency and growth performance in rice. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that OsMGT3-dependent diel Mg fluctuations in chloroplasts may contribute to Mg-dependent enzyme activities for photosynthesis over the daily cycle. Enhancing Mg2+ input to chloroplasts could be a potential approach to improving photosynthetic efficiency in plants. 
NA	Two central circadian oscillators OsPRR59 and OsPRR95 modulate magnesium homeostasis and carbon fixation in rice.	2022	Mol Plant	Root Biology Center, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China.	Photosynthesis, which provides oxygen and energy for all living organisms, is circadian regulated. Photosynthesis-associated metabolism must tightly coordinate with the circadian clock to maximize the efficiency of the light-energy capture and carbon fixation. However, the molecular basis for the interplay of photosynthesis and the circadian clock is not fully understood, particularly in crop plants. Here, we report two central oscillator genes of circadian clock, OsPRR95 and OsPRR59 in rice, which function as transcriptional repressors to negatively regulate the rhythmic expression of OsMGT3 encoding a chloroplast-localized Mg(2+) transporter. OsMGT3-dependent rhythmic Mg fluctuations modulate carbon fixation and consequent sugar output in rice chloroplasts. Furthermore, sugar triggers the increase of superoxide, which may act as a feedback signal to positively regulate the expression of OsPRR95 and OsPRR59. Taken together, our results reveal a negative-feedback loop that strengthens the crosstalk between photosynthetic carbon fixation and the circadian clock, which may improve plan adaptation and performance in fluctuating environments.
