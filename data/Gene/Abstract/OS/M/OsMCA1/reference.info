BACKGROUND: Mechanosensing and its downstream responses are speculated to involve sensory complexes containing Ca2+-permeable mechanosensitive channels. On recognizing osmotic signals, plant cells initiate activation of a widespread signal transduction network that induces second messengers and triggers inducible defense responses. Characteristic early signaling events include Ca2+ influx, protein phosphorylation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pharmacological analyses show Ca2+ influx mediated by mechanosensitive Ca2+ channels to influence induction of osmotic signals, including ROS generation. However, molecular bases and regulatory mechanisms for early osmotic signaling events remain poorly elucidated. RESULTS: We here identified and investigated OsMCA1, the sole rice homolog of putative Ca2+-permeable mechanosensitive channels in Arabidopsis (MCAs). OsMCA1 was specifically localized at the plasma membrane. A promoter-reporter assay suggested that OsMCA1 mRNA is widely expressed in seed embryos, proximal and apical regions of shoots, and mesophyll cells of leaves and roots in rice. Ca2+ uptake was enhanced in OsMCA1-overexpressing suspension-cultured cells, suggesting that OsMCA1 is involved in Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. Hypo-osmotic shock-induced ROS generation mediated by NADPH oxidases was also enhanced in OsMCA1-overexpressing cells. We also generated and characterized OsMCA1-RNAi transgenic plants and cultured cells; OsMCA1-suppressed plants showed retarded growth and shortened rachises, while OsMCA1-suppressed cells carrying Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin showed partially impaired changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) induced by hypo-osmotic shock and trinitrophenol, an activator of mechanosensitive channels. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a sole MCA ortholog in the rice genome and developed both overexpression and suppression lines. Analyses of cultured cells with altered levels of this putative Ca2+-permeable mechanosensitive channel indicate that OsMCA1 is involved in regulation of plasma membrane Ca2+ influx and ROS generation induced by hypo-osmotic stress in cultured rice cells. These findings shed light on our understanding of mechanical sensing pathways.

Mechanosensing and its downstream responses are speculated to involve sensory complexes containing Ca(2+)-permeable mechanosensitive channels. On recognizing hypo-osmotic stress, plant cells initiate activation of a widespread signal transduction network involving second messengers such as Ca(2+) to trigger inducible defense responses including the induction of transcriptional factors. However, most of the components involved in these signaling networks still remain to be identified. Recently we identified and investigated OsMCA1, the sole homolog of the MCA family putative Ca(2+)-permeable mechanosensitive channels in rice. Functional characterization of the OsMCA1-suppressed cells as well as the overexpressing cells indicated that OsMCA1 is involved in the regulation of plasma membrane Ca(2+) influx and NADPH oxidase-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by hypo-osmotic stress. Here we will discuss possible molecular mechanisms and physiological functions of the MCA protein in hypo-osmotic signaling.
