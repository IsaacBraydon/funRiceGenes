OsMYB57	Kinase	OsMYB57 transcriptionally regulates OsMAPK11 to interact with OsPAL2;3 and modulate rice allelopathy.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation incorporated with HiSeq demonstrated that OsMYB57 transcriptionally regulated a mitogen-activated protein kinase (OsMAPK11); in addition, OsMAPK11 interacted with OsPAL2;3

OsMYB57	transcription activator	OsMYB57 transcriptionally regulates OsMAPK11 to interact with OsPAL2;3 and modulate rice allelopathy.	 Increasing the OsMYB57 expression in rice using the transcription activator VP64 resulted in increased inhibitory ratios against barnyardgrass
