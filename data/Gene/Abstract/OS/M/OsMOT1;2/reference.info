NA	Tonoplast-Localized OsMOT1;2 Participates in Interorgan Molybdate Distribution in Rice.	2021	Plant Cell Physiol	Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, 305-8604 Japan.	Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential element for plant growth and is utilized by several key enzymes in biological redox processes. Rice assimilates molybdate ions via OsMOT1;1, a transporter with a high affinity for molybdate. However, other systems involved in the molecular transport of molybdate in rice remain unclear. Here, we characterized OsMOT1;2, which shares amino acid sequence similarity with AtMOT1;2 and functions in vacuolar molybdate export. We isolated a rice mutant harboring a complete deletion of OsMOT1;2. This mutant exhibited a significantly lower grain Mo concentration than the wild type (WT), but its growth was not inhibited. The Mo concentration in grains was restored by the introduction of WT OsMOT1;2. The OsMOT1;2-GFP protein was localized to the vacuolar membrane when transiently expressed in rice protoplasts. At the reproductive growth stage of the WT plant, OsMOT1;2 was highly expressed in the 2nd and lower leaf blades and nodes. The deletion of OsMOT1;2 impaired interorgan Mo allocation in aerial parts: relative to the WT, the mutant exhibited decreased Mo levels in the 1st and 2nd leaf blades and grains but increased Mo levels in the 2nd and lower leaf sheaths, nodes and internodes. When the seedlings were exposed to a solution with a high KNO3 concentration in the absence of Mo, the mutant exhibited significantly lower nitrate reductase activity in the shoots than the WT. Our results suggest that OsMOT1;2 plays an essential role in interorgan Mo distribution and molybdoenzyme activity in rice.
NA	The Vacuolar Molybdate Transporter OsMOT1;2 Controls Molybdenum Remobilization in Rice.	2022	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential micronutrient for almost all living organisms. The Mo uptake process in plants has been well investigated. However, the mechanisms controlling Mo translocation and remobilization among different plant tissues are largely unknown, especially the allocation of Mo to rice grains that are the major dietary source of Mo for humans. In this study, we characterized the functions of a molybdate transporter, OsMOT1;2, in the interorgan allocation of Mo in rice. Heterologous expression in yeast established the molybdate transport activity of OsMOT1;2. OsMOT1;2 was highly expressed in the blades of the flag leaf and the second leaf during the grain filling stage. Subcellular localization revealed that OsMOT1;2 localizes to the tonoplast. Knockout of OsMOT1;2 led to more Mo accumulation in roots and less Mo translocation to shoots at the seedling stage and to grains at the maturity stage. The remobilization of Mo from older leaves to young leaves under molybdate-depleted condition was also decreased in the osmot1;2 knockout mutant. In contrast, overexpression of OsMOT1;2 enhanced the translocation of Mo from roots to shoots at the seedling stage. The remobilization of Mo from upper leaves to grains was also enhanced in the overexpression lines during grain filling. Our results suggest that OsMOT1;2 may function as a vacuolar molybdate exporter facilitating the efflux of Mo from the vacuole into the cytoplasm, and thus, it plays an important role in the root-to-shoot translocation of Mo and the remobilization of Mo from leaves to grains.
