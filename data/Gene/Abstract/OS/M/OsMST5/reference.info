The sugar transporters identified as being specific to the seed development may play a crucial role for flowering and grain development. The rice sucrose transporterOsSUT1 and the monosaccharide transportersOsMST1-3 have been previously characterized. To investigate sugar transport processes during flowering and in developing grains of rice, we newly isolated two genomic clonesOsSUT2(Oryzasativasucrosetransporter 2) andOsMST5(Oryzasativamonosaccharidetransporter 5) and their corresponding cDNAs.OsSUT2 andOsMST5are encoded by open reading frames of 1485 and 1557 bp encoding 495 and 519amino acids, respectively. The putative amino acid sequence ofOsSUT2showed 63.0 and 62.4 percnt; identity to that ofOsSUT1and barley transporterHvSUT1, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed thatOsSUT2andOsMST5mRNA accumulates in panicles before pollination.In situ hybridization analysis showed thatOsSUT2transcript is specific to the developing pollen. These data presented suggest that bothOsSUT2andOsMST5 play a role during the development at the early stage of the seed development. On the other handOsSUT1 was expressed at the early stage of the grain development, suggesting a different physiological role compared to Os SUT2.
67_556.pdf	Characterization of Rice Functional Monosaccharide Transporter,OsMST5	2014	Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry	Graduate School of Science, Hokkaido University	cDNA of a monosaccharide transporter in rice, OsMST5 (Oryza sativa monosaccharide transporter 5) was cloned and its sugar transport activity was characterized by heterologous expression analysis. The amino acid sequence and topology were similar to the sequences and topology of other plant monosaccharide transporters. Yeast cells co-expressed with OsMST5 cDNA transported some monosaccharide substrates. The transport rate increased when ethanol as an electron donor was added, so the transporter was an energy-dependent active one. Most of the OsMST5 was expressed in panicles before pollination, indicating that it is associated with pollen development in rice.
