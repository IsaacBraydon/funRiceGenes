OsMST5	OsSUT2|OsSUT2M	Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice	 To investigate sugar transport processes during flowering and in developing grains of rice, we newly isolated two genomic clonesOsSUT2(Oryzasativasucrosetransporter 2) andOsMST5(Oryzasativamonosaccharidetransporter 5) and their corresponding cDNAs
OsMST5	OsSUT2|OsSUT2M	Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice	OsSUT2 andOsMST5are encoded by open reading frames of 1485 and 1557 bp encoding 495 and 519amino acids, respectively
OsMST5	OsSUT2|OsSUT2M	Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice	 Northern blot analysis revealed thatOsSUT2andOsMST5mRNA accumulates in panicles before pollination
OsMST5	OsSUT2|OsSUT2M	Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice	 These data presented suggest that bothOsSUT2andOsMST5 play a role during the development at the early stage of the seed development
