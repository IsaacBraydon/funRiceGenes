OsMST5	seed development	Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice	These data presented suggest that bothOsSUT2andOsMST5 play a role during the development at the early stage of the seed development
OsMST5	flower	Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice	To investigate sugar transport processes during flowering and in developing grains of rice, we newly isolated two genomic clonesOsSUT2(Oryzasativasucrosetransporter 2) andOsMST5(Oryzasativamonosaccharidetransporter 5) and their corresponding cDNAs
OsMST5	grain	Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice	To investigate sugar transport processes during flowering and in developing grains of rice, we newly isolated two genomic clonesOsSUT2(Oryzasativasucrosetransporter 2) andOsMST5(Oryzasativamonosaccharidetransporter 5) and their corresponding cDNAs
