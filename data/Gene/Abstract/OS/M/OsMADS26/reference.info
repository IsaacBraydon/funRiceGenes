Plant MADS-box genes can be divided into 11 groups. Genetic analysis has revealed that most of them function in flowering-time control, reproductive organ development, and vegetative growth. Here, we elucidated the role of OsMADS26, a member of the AGL12 group. Transcript levels of OsMADS26 were increased in an age-dependent manner in the shoots and roots. Transgenic plants of both rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) overexpressing this gene manifested phenotypes related to stress responses, such as chlorosis, cell death, pigment accumulation, and defective root/shoot growth. In addition, apical hook development was significantly suppressed in Arabidopsis. Plants transformed with the OsMADS26-GR (glucocorticoid receptor) fusion construct displayed those stress-related phenotypes when treated with dexamethasone. Microarray analyses using this inducible system showed that biosynthesis genes for jasmonate, ethylene, and reactive oxygen species, as well as putative downstream targets involved in the stress-related process, were up-regulated in OsMADS26-overexpressing plants. These results suggest that OsMADS26 induces multiple responses that are related to various stresses.
