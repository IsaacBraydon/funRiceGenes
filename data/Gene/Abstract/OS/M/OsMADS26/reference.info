Plant MADS-box genes can be divided into 11 groups. Genetic analysis has revealed that most of them function in flowering-time control, reproductive organ development, and vegetative growth. Here, we elucidated the role of OsMADS26, a member of the AGL12 group. Transcript levels of OsMADS26 were increased in an age-dependent manner in the shoots and roots. Transgenic plants of both rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) overexpressing this gene manifested phenotypes related to stress responses, such as chlorosis, cell death, pigment accumulation, and defective root/shoot growth. In addition, apical hook development was significantly suppressed in Arabidopsis. Plants transformed with the OsMADS26-GR (glucocorticoid receptor) fusion construct displayed those stress-related phenotypes when treated with dexamethasone. Microarray analyses using this inducible system showed that biosynthesis genes for jasmonate, ethylene, and reactive oxygen species, as well as putative downstream targets involved in the stress-related process, were up-regulated in OsMADS26-overexpressing plants. These results suggest that OsMADS26 induces multiple responses that are related to various stresses.
NA	OsMADS26 negatively regulates resistance to pathogens and drought tolerance in rice	2015	Plant Physiol	Universit√© de Montpellier CITY: Montpellier France [FR].

Over-expression of the OsMADS26 gene in rice (Oryza sativa) has revealed a possible function related to stress response (Lee et al., 2008b). Here we show that OsMADS26 down-regulated plants exhibit enhanced resistance against two major rice pathogens, Magnaporthe oryzae  and Xanthomonas oryzae. Despite this enhanced resistance to biotic stresses, OsMADS26 down-regulated plants also displayed enhanced tolerance to water deficit. These phenotypes were observed both in controlled and field conditions.  Interestingly, alteration of OsMADS26 expression has no strong impact on plant development. Gene expression profiling revealed that a majority of genes miss-regulated in over-expresser and down-regulated OsMADS26 lines compared to control plants are associated to biotic or abiotic stress response. Altogether, our data indicate that OsMADS26 acts as an upstream regulator of stress-associated genes and thereby as a hub to modulate the response to various  stresses in the rice plant.
