OsMADS26	shoot	Further characterization of a rice AGL12 group MADS-box gene, OsMADS26	 Transcript levels of OsMADS26 were increased in an age-dependent manner in the shoots and roots
OsMADS26	jasmonate	Further characterization of a rice AGL12 group MADS-box gene, OsMADS26	 Microarray analyses using this inducible system showed that biosynthesis genes for jasmonate, ethylene, and reactive oxygen species, as well as putative downstream targets involved in the stress-related process, were up-regulated in OsMADS26-overexpressing plants
OsMADS26	root	Further characterization of a rice AGL12 group MADS-box gene, OsMADS26	 Transcript levels of OsMADS26 were increased in an age-dependent manner in the shoots and roots
OsMADS26	ethylene	Further characterization of a rice AGL12 group MADS-box gene, OsMADS26	 Microarray analyses using this inducible system showed that biosynthesis genes for jasmonate, ethylene, and reactive oxygen species, as well as putative downstream targets involved in the stress-related process, were up-regulated in OsMADS26-overexpressing plants
