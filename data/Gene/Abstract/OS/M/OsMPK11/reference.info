MPMI-19-0530.pdf	Molecular analysis of the rice MAP kinase gene family in relation to Magnaporthe grisea infection	2006	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Department of Plant Pathology, Program in Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701, USA.	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play a crucial role in plant growth and development as well as biotic and abiotic stress responses. In Arabidopsis, 20 MAPKs have been identified and divided into four major groups. In rice, a monocot model and economically important cereal crop, only five MAPKs were characterized, including three related to the host defense response. In this study, we have identified 17 members of the rice MAPK gene (OsMPK) family through an in silico search of rice genome databases. Based on the phylogenetic analysis and pairwise comparison of Arabidopsis and rice MAPKs, we propose that MAPKs can be divided into six groups. Interestingly, the rice genome contains many more MAPKs with the TDY phosphorylation site (11 members) than with the TEY motif (six members). In contrast, the Arabidopsis genome contains more MAPKs with the TEY motif (12 members) than with the TDY motif (eight members). Upon inoculation with the blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea), nine of 17 OsMPK genes were found to be induced at the mRNA level during either early, late, or both stages of infection. Four of the M. grisea-induced OsMPK genes were associated with host-cell death in the lesion-mimic rice mutant, and eight of them were differentially induced in response to defense signal molecules such as jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, abscisic acid, and ethylene. The genome-wide expression analysis suggests that about half of the rice MAPK genes are associated with pathogen infection and host defense response.
NA	OsMYB57 transcriptionally regulates OsMAPK11 to interact with OsPAL2;3 and modulate rice allelopathy.	2019	J Exp Bot	Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Agroecological Processing and Safety Monitoring, College of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, P. R. China.	Rice allelopathy is a natural weed control method that is regarded as an eco-friendly practice in agroecology. The allelopathic potential of rice is regulated by various genes, including those that encode transcription factors. Our study characterised a MYB transcription factor, OsMYB57, to explore its role in the regulation of rice allelopathy. Increasing the OsMYB57 expression in rice using the transcription activator VP64 resulted in increased inhibitory ratios against barnyardgrass. The gene expression levels of OsPAL, OsC4H, OsOMT and OsCAD from the phenylpropanoid pathway were also upregulated, and the content of L-phenylalanine increased. Chromatin immunoprecipitation incorporated with HiSeq demonstrated that OsMYB57 transcriptionally regulated a mitogen-activated protein kinase (OsMAPK11); in addition, OsMAPK11 interacted with OsPAL2;3. The transcriptional ability of OsPAL2;3 was higher in the allelopathic rice PI312777 than in the non-allelopathic rice Lemont, and OsPAL2;3 was negatively regulated by Whirly transcription factors. Moreover, microbes with weed-suppression potential, including Penicillium spp. and Bacillus spp., were assembled in the rhizosphere of rice accession Kitaake with increased expression of OsMYB57 and were responsible for phenolic acid induction. Our findings suggest that OsMYB57 positively regulated rice allelopathy, providing an option for the improvement of rice allelopathic traits through genetic modification.
NA	OsWRKY28 positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice.	2022	Plant Cell Rep	Jilin Province Engineering Laboratory of Plant Genetic Improvement, College of Plant Science, Jilin University, Changchun, 130062, People&#x27;s Republic of China.	OsWRKY28 confers salinity tolerance by directly binding to OsDREB1B promoter and increasing its transcriptional activity, and negatively regulates abscisic acid mediated seedling establishment in rice. WRKY transcription factors have been reported to play a vital role in plants growth, development, abiotic and biotic stress responses. In this study, we explored the functions of a transcription factor OsWRKY28 in rice. The transcript level of OsWRKY28 was strikingly increased under drought, chilling, salt and abscisic acid treatments. The OsWRKY28 overexpression lines showed enhanced salinity stress tolerance, whereas the oswrky28 mutants displayed salt sensitivity compared to wild-type plants. Under salt stress treatment, the expression levels of OsbZIP05, OsHKT1;1 and OsDREB1B were significantly lower yet the level of OsHKT2;1 was significantly higher in oswrky28 mutants than those in wide type plants. Our data of yeast one-hybrid assay and dual-luciferase assay supported that OsWRKY28 could directly bind to the promoter of OsDREB1B to enhance salinity tolerance in rice. In addition, OsWRKY28 overexpression lines displayed hyposensitivity and the oswrky28 mutants showed hypersensitivity compared to wild-type plants under exogenous abscisic acid treatment. Based on the results of yeast two-hybrid assay and GAL4-dependent chimeric transactivation assay, OsWRKY28 physically interacts with OsMPK11 and its transcriptional activity could be regulated by OsMPK11. Together, OsWRKY28 confers salinity tolerance through directly targeting OsDREB1B promoter and further activating its transcription in rice.
