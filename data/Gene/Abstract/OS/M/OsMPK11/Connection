OsMPK11|OsMAPK11	OsWRKY28	OsWRKY28 positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice.	 Based on the results of yeast two-hybrid assay and GAL4-dependent chimeric transactivation assay, OsWRKY28 physically interacts with OsMPK11 and its transcriptional activity could be regulated by OsMPK11
