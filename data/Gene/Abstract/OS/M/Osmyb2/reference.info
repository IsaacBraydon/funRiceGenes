Three elements in the promoter of rice glutelin genes are important for their endosperm specific expression. One of these, an AACA motif, has been shown to be a negative regulator in non-seed tissues and has a similarity to the barley gibberellin responsive element recognized by MYB-like DNA binding proteins. A cDNA library constructed from immature rice seed was screened using two types of myb gene probes to isolate cDNA clones representing genes encoding MYB-like DNA binding proteins that may recognize the AACA motif in rice glutelin gene promoter. We obtained four cDNA clones encoding MYB-related proteins, Oryza sativa MYB (OSMYB) 1-4, using the maize C1 probe. Another myb-like clone, Osmyb5, was obtained by screening a rice seed cDNA library with probes designed to recognize the AACA-like binding domain in GAMYB and PHMYB3. RT-PCR was used to analyze Osmyb expression during rice seed development and their presence in other rice tissues, as it was not possible to detect these mRNAs by conventional Northern analysis. RT-PCR analysis showed that Osmyb2, Osmyb3 and Osmyb5 genes were expressed in all tissues examined. In seed, the mRNA levels of Osmyb1 and Osmyb4 genes reached a maximum at 14 days after flowering (DAF), suggesting that these genes may play a role in seed maturation. As Osmyb5 exhibits a high similarity to the regions in both GAMYB and PHMYB3, which can bind to the AACA motif, there is a possibility that the OSMYB5 protein may bind to the AACA motif of glutelin genes.

MYB-type transcription factors play a diverse role in plant development and response to abiotic stress. This study isolated a rice R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, and functionally characterized its role in tolerance to abiotic stress by generating transgenic rice plants with overexpressing and RNA interference OsMYB2. Expression of OsMYB2 was up-regulated by salt, cold, and dehydration stress. OsMYB2 was localized in the nucleus with transactivation activity. No difference in growth and development between the OsMYB2-overexpressing and wild-type plants was observed under normal growth conditions, but the OsMYB2-overexpressing plants were more tolerant to salt, cold, and dehydration stresses and more sensitive to abscisic acid than wild-type plants. The OsMYB2-overexpressing plants accumulated greater amounts of soluble sugars and proline than wild-type plants under salt stress. Overexpression of OsMYB2 enhanced up-regulation of genes encoding proline synthase and transporters. The OsMYB2-overexpressing plants accumulated less amounts of H(2)O(2) and malondialdehyde. The enhanced activities of antioxidant enzymes, including peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, may underlie the lower H(2)O(2) contents in OsMYB2-overexpressing plants. There was greater up-regulation of stress-related genes, including OsLEA3, OsRab16A, and OsDREB2A, in the OsMYB2-overexpressing plants. Microarray analysis showed that expression of numerous genes involving diverse functions in stress response was altered in the OsMYB2-overexpressing plants. These findings suggest that OsMYB2 encodes a stress-responsive MYB transcription factor that plays a regulatory role in tolerance of rice to salt, cold, and dehydration stress.
