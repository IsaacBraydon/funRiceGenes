Osmyb2	Osmyb5	Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed	RT-PCR analysis showed that Osmyb2, Osmyb3 and Osmyb5 genes were expressed in all tissues examined
Osmyb2	Osmyb3|SG3|SMG3	Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed	RT-PCR analysis showed that Osmyb2, Osmyb3 and Osmyb5 genes were expressed in all tissues examined
OsDREB2A	Osmyb2	A R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice	There was greater up-regulation of stress-related genes, including OsLEA3, OsRab16A, and OsDREB2A, in the OsMYB2-overexpressing plants
OsLEA3|OsLEA3-1	Osmyb2	A R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice	There was greater up-regulation of stress-related genes, including OsLEA3, OsRab16A, and OsDREB2A, in the OsMYB2-overexpressing plants
Osmyb2	OsWRKY5	Inactivating transcription factor OsWRKY5 enhances drought tolerance through abscisic acid signaling pathways.	 Transcriptome deep sequencing and RT-qPCR analyses demonstrated that the expression of abiotic stress-related genes including rice MYB2 (OsMYB2) was upregulated in oswrky5 knockout mutants and downregulated in oswrky5-D mutants
Osmyb2	OsWRKY5	Inactivating transcription factor OsWRKY5 enhances drought tolerance through abscisic acid signaling pathways.	 Moreover, dual-luciferase, yeast one-hybrid, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that OsWRKY5 directly binds to the W-box sequences in the promoter region of OsMYB2 and represses OsMYB2 expression, thus downregulating genes downstream of OsMYB2 in the ABA signaling pathways
OsbZIP14	Osmyb2	Integrated ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq Data Analysis to Reveal OsbZIP14 Function in Rice in Response to Heat Stress.	 This study identified three TF genes, including OsbZIP14, OsMYB2, and OsHSF7, by integrating transcriptomic and epigenetic sequencing data analysis of rice in response to heat stress
