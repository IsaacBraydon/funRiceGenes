OsMOS1	 Knocking out OsMOS1 delayed heading, while the overexpression of OsMOS1 promoted heading in rice under long-day conditions |  Conversely, the overexpression of OsMOS1 promoted the expressions of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1, but inhibited the expression of Hd1 |  Furthermore, we also found that the overexpression of OsMOS1 in the Arabidopsis&amp;amp;nbsp;mos1 mutant background could suppress its phenotypes of late flowering and increased seed size	 Knocking out OsMOS1 delayed heading, while the overexpression of OsMOS1 promoted heading in rice under long-day conditions |  Conversely, the overexpression of OsMOS1 promoted the expressions of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1, but inhibited the expression of Hd1 |  Furthermore, we also found that the overexpression of OsMOS1 in the Arabidopsis&amp;amp;nbsp;mos1 mutant background could suppress its phenotypes of late flowering and increased seed size
