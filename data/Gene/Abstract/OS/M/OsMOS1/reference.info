The heading date and grain size are two essential traits affecting rice yield. Here, we found that OsMOS1 promotes rice heading and affects its grain size. Knocking out OsMOS1 delayed heading, while the overexpression of OsMOS1 promoted heading in rice under long-day conditions. The transcriptions of the heading activators Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 were decreased and the heading repressor Hd1 was increased in the osmos1 mutant. Conversely, the overexpression of OsMOS1 promoted the expressions of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1, but inhibited the expression of Hd1. This suggests that OsMOS1 may control heading in rice by modulating the transcriptions of Ehd1, Hd3a, RFT1, and Hd1. In addition, knocking out OsMOS1 led to larger grains with longer grain lengths and higher grain weights. The seed cell size measurement showed that the cell lengths and cell widths of the outer glume epidermal cells of the osmos1 mutant were greater than those of the wild type. Furthermore, we also found that the overexpression of OsMOS1 in the Arabidopsis&amp;amp;nbsp;mos1 mutant background could suppress its phenotypes of late flowering and increased seed size. Thus, our study shows a conserved function of MOS1 in rice and Arabidopsis, and these findings shed light on the heading and seed size regulation in rice and suggest that OsMOS1 is a promising target for rice yield improvement.
