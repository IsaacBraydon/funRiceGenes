OsMED4	SAD1	SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development	Here we show that SAD1 interacts physically with the Mediator complex through a direct binding with OsMED4, a component of the middle module of the Mediator complex in rice. 
OsMED4	OsRPC53	SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development	TFIIF2 and RPC53 are counterparts of RPA34.5 in Pol II and Pol III, respectively. We demonstrate that the rice orthologs of these proteins also interact with OsMED4.
OsMED4	OsTFIIF2-1	SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development	TFIIF2 and RPC53 are counterparts of RPA34.5 in Pol II and Pol III, respectively. We demonstrate that the rice orthologs of these proteins also interact with OsMED4.
