Ehd1	OsMFT1	OsMFT1 increases spikelets per panicle and delays heading date in rice by suppressing Ehd1, FZP and SEPALLATA-like genes.	OsMFT1 increases spikelets per panicle and delays heading date in rice by suppressing Ehd1, FZP and SEPALLATA-like genes.
Ehd1	OsMFT1	OsMFT1 increases spikelets per panicle and delays heading date in rice by suppressing Ehd1, FZP and SEPALLATA-like genes.	 Overexpression of OsMFT1 significantly suppressed Ehd1 expression, and Ghd7 up-regulated OsMFT1 expression
Ehd1	OsMFT1	OsMFT1 increases spikelets per panicle and delays heading date in rice by suppressing Ehd1, FZP and SEPALLATA-like genes.	 Therefore, OsMFT1 is a suppressor of flowering acting downstream of Ghd7 and upstream of Ehd1, and a positive regulator of panicle architecture
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	OsMFT1	OsMFT1 increases spikelets per panicle and delays heading date in rice by suppressing Ehd1, FZP and SEPALLATA-like genes.	OsMFT1 increases spikelets per panicle and delays heading date in rice by suppressing Ehd1, FZP and SEPALLATA-like genes.
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	OsMFT1	OsMFT1 increases spikelets per panicle and delays heading date in rice by suppressing Ehd1, FZP and SEPALLATA-like genes.	 RNA-seq and RNA in situ hybridization analysis confirmed that OsMFT1 repressed expression of FZP and five SEPALLATA-like genes, indicating that the transition from branch meristem to spikelet meristem was delayed and thus more panicle branches were produced
Ghd7	OsMFT1	OsMFT1 increases spikelets per panicle and delays heading date in rice by suppressing Ehd1, FZP and SEPALLATA-like genes.	 Overexpression of OsMFT1 significantly suppressed Ehd1 expression, and Ghd7 up-regulated OsMFT1 expression
Ghd7	OsMFT1	OsMFT1 increases spikelets per panicle and delays heading date in rice by suppressing Ehd1, FZP and SEPALLATA-like genes.	 Double mutants showed that OsMFT1 acted downstream of Ghd7
Ghd7	OsMFT1	OsMFT1 increases spikelets per panicle and delays heading date in rice by suppressing Ehd1, FZP and SEPALLATA-like genes.	 Therefore, OsMFT1 is a suppressor of flowering acting downstream of Ghd7 and upstream of Ehd1, and a positive regulator of panicle architecture
OsLFL1	OsMFT1	OsMFT1 increases spikelets per panicle and delays heading date in rice by suppressing Ehd1, FZP and SEPALLATA-like genes.	 In addition, transcription factor OsLFL1 was verified to directly bind to the promoter of OsMFT1 via an RY motif and activate the expression of OsMFT1 in vivo and in vitro
