NA	OsMFT1 increases spikelets per panicle and delays heading date in rice by suppressing Ehd1, FZP and SEPALLATA-like genes.	2018	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	Heading date and panicle architecture are important agronomic traits in rice. Here, we identified a gene MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (OsMFT1) that regulates rice heading and panicle architecture. Overexpressing OsMFT1 delayed heading date by over 7 d and greatly increased spikelets per panicle and the number of branches. In contrast, OsMFT1 knockout mutants had an advanced heading date and reduced spikelets per panicle. Overexpression of OsMFT1 significantly suppressed Ehd1 expression, and Ghd7 up-regulated OsMFT1 expression. Double mutants showed that OsMFT1 acted downstream of Ghd7. In addition, transcription factor OsLFL1 was verified to directly bind to the promoter of OsMFT1 via an RY motif and activate the expression of OsMFT1 in vivo and in vitro. RNA-seq and RNA in situ hybridization analysis confirmed that OsMFT1 repressed expression of FZP and five SEPALLATA-like genes, indicating that the transition from branch meristem to spikelet meristem was delayed and thus more panicle branches were produced. Therefore, OsMFT1 is a suppressor of flowering acting downstream of Ghd7 and upstream of Ehd1, and a positive regulator of panicle architecture.
NA	Nuclear Translocation of OsMFT1 That is Impeded by OsFTIP1 Promotes Drought Tolerance in Rice	2021	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Resources, Institute of Crop Science, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Drought has been the leading environmental threat affecting the productivity of crops, and plants have evolved a series of mechanisms to adapt to drought stress. The FT-INTERACTING PROTEINs (FTIPs) and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins (PEBPs) play key roles in developmental processes, whereas their roles in the regulation of stress response are still largely unknown. Here, we report that OsFTIP1 negatively affects drought response. Further study reveals that OsFTIP1 interacts with a PEBP, rice MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (OsMFT1), which promotes rice tolerance to drought treatment. OsMFT1 was found to interact with two key drought-related transcription factors, OsbZIP66 and OsMYB26, and regulates their binding capacity on drought-related genes, thus enhancing drought tolerance in rice. We further revealed that OsFTIP1 impedes the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of OsMFT1. These results demonstrate that dynamic modulation of drought responsive genes by OsMFT1-OsMYB26 complex and OsMFT1-OsbZIP66 complex is integral to OsFTIP1 effect on impeding nuclear translocation of OsMFT1. Our findings suggest that OsMFT1 acts as a hitherto unknown nucleocytoplasmic trafficking signal that regulates drought tolerance in rice in response to environmental signals.
