NA	OsMFT1 increases spikelets per panicle and delays heading date in rice by suppressing Ehd1, FZP and SEPALLATA-like genes.	2018	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	Heading date and panicle architecture are important agronomic traits in rice. Here, we identified a gene MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (OsMFT1) that regulates rice heading and panicle architecture. Overexpressing OsMFT1 delayed heading date by over 7 d and greatly increased spikelets per panicle and the number of branches. In contrast, OsMFT1 knockout mutants had an advanced heading date and reduced spikelets per panicle. Overexpression of OsMFT1 significantly suppressed Ehd1 expression, and Ghd7 up-regulated OsMFT1 expression. Double mutants showed that OsMFT1 acted downstream of Ghd7. In addition, transcription factor OsLFL1 was verified to directly bind to the promoter of OsMFT1 via an RY motif and activate the expression of OsMFT1 in vivo and in vitro. RNA-seq and RNA in situ hybridization analysis confirmed that OsMFT1 repressed expression of FZP and five SEPALLATA-like genes, indicating that the transition from branch meristem to spikelet meristem was delayed and thus more panicle branches were produced. Therefore, OsMFT1 is a suppressor of flowering acting downstream of Ghd7 and upstream of Ehd1, and a positive regulator of panicle architecture.
NA	Nuclear Translocation of OsMFT1 That is Impeded by OsFTIP1 Promotes Drought Tolerance in Rice	2021	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Resources, Institute of Crop Science, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Drought has been the leading environmental threat affecting the productivity of crops, and plants have evolved a series of mechanisms to adapt to drought stress. The FT-INTERACTING PROTEINs (FTIPs) and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins (PEBPs) play key roles in developmental processes, whereas their roles in the regulation of stress response are still largely unknown. Here, we report that OsFTIP1 negatively affects drought response. Further study reveals that OsFTIP1 interacts with a PEBP, rice MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (OsMFT1), which promotes rice tolerance to drought treatment. OsMFT1 was found to interact with two key drought-related transcription factors, OsbZIP66 and OsMYB26, and regulates their binding capacity on drought-related genes, thus enhancing drought tolerance in rice. We further revealed that OsFTIP1 impedes the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of OsMFT1. These results demonstrate that dynamic modulation of drought responsive genes by OsMFT1-OsMYB26 complex and OsMFT1-OsbZIP66 complex is integral to OsFTIP1 effect on impeding nuclear translocation of OsMFT1. Our findings suggest that OsMFT1 acts as a hitherto unknown nucleocytoplasmic trafficking signal that regulates drought tolerance in rice in response to environmental signals. 
NA	OsMFT1 inhibits seed germination through modulating abscisic acid signaling and gibberellin biosynthesis under salt stress in rice.	2023	Plant Cell Physiol	College of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Seed dormancy and germination are regulated by endogenous gene expression as well as hormonal and environmental conditions, such as salinity, which greatly inhibits seed germination. MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (MFT), which encodes a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein, is a key regulator in seed germination of Arabidopsis thaliana. There are two orthologous genes of AtMFT in rice (Oryza sativa), namely OsMFT1 and OsMFT2. However, the functions of these two genes in regulating rice seed germination under salt stress remain unknown. In this study, we found that seeds of loss-of-function osmft1 mutants germinated faster than wild-type (WT) seeds under salt stress, but this was not the case for loss-of-function osmft2 mutants. Overexpression of OsMFT1 (OsMFT1OE) or OsMFT2 increased the sensitivity to salt stress during seed germination. Transcriptome comparisons of osmft1 vs WT in the absence and presence of salt stress yielded several differentially expressed genes, which were associated with salt stress, plant hormone metabolism, and signaling pathways, such as B-BOX ZINC FINGER 6, Oryza sativa bZIP PROTEIN 8, and GIBBERELLIN (GA) 20-oxidase 1. In addition, the sensitivity of OsMFT1OE seeds to GA and osmft1 seeds to ABA during seed germination increased under salt stress. Overall, our results indicate that ABA and GA metabolism and their signaling pathways are regulated by OsMFT1, modulating seed germination in rice under salt stress.
