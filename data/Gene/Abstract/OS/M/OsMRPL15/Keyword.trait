OsMRPL15	development	The transcribed centromeric gene OsMRPL15 is essential for pollen development in rice.	The transcribed centromeric gene OsMRPL15 is essential for pollen development in rice.
OsMRPL15	pollen	The transcribed centromeric gene OsMRPL15 is essential for pollen development in rice.	The transcribed centromeric gene OsMRPL15 is essential for pollen development in rice.
OsMRPL15	pollen	The transcribed centromeric gene OsMRPL15 is essential for pollen development in rice.	 Osmrpl15 pollen was completely sterile, with abnormalities appearing at the tricellular stage including the absence of starch granules and disrupted mitochondrial structure
OsMRPL15	pollen	The transcribed centromeric gene OsMRPL15 is essential for pollen development in rice.	 Loss of OsMRPL15 caused abnormal accumulation of mitoribosomal proteins and large subunit rRNA in pollen mitochondria
OsMRPL15	pollen	The transcribed centromeric gene OsMRPL15 is essential for pollen development in rice.	 Osmrpl15 pollen contained smaller amounts of intermediates related to starch metabolism than wild-type pollen, while biosynthesis of several amino acids was upregulated, possibly to compensate for defective mitochondrial protein biosynthesis and initiate consumption of carbohydrates necessary for starch biosynthesis
OsMRPL15	starch	The transcribed centromeric gene OsMRPL15 is essential for pollen development in rice.	 Osmrpl15 pollen was completely sterile, with abnormalities appearing at the tricellular stage including the absence of starch granules and disrupted mitochondrial structure
OsMRPL15	starch	The transcribed centromeric gene OsMRPL15 is essential for pollen development in rice.	 Osmrpl15 pollen contained smaller amounts of intermediates related to starch metabolism than wild-type pollen, while biosynthesis of several amino acids was upregulated, possibly to compensate for defective mitochondrial protein biosynthesis and initiate consumption of carbohydrates necessary for starch biosynthesis
OsMRPL15	mitochondria	The transcribed centromeric gene OsMRPL15 is essential for pollen development in rice.	 Loss of OsMRPL15 caused abnormal accumulation of mitoribosomal proteins and large subunit rRNA in pollen mitochondria
OsMRPL15	pollen development	The transcribed centromeric gene OsMRPL15 is essential for pollen development in rice.	The transcribed centromeric gene OsMRPL15 is essential for pollen development in rice.
