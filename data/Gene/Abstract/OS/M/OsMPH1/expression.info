OsMPH1	 Overexpression of OsMPH1 leads to increases of plant height and grain yield in rice, while knockdown of OsMPH1 leads to the opposite phenotypes	 Overexpression of OsMPH1 leads to increases of plant height and grain yield in rice, while knockdown of OsMPH1 leads to the opposite phenotypes
OsMPH1|OsMYB45	 OsMYB45 is highly expressed in rice leaves, husks, stamens, pistils, and lateral roots, and its expression is induced by Cd stress |  In addition, overexpression of OsMYB45 in the mutant complemented the mutant phenotype	 In addition, overexpression of OsMYB45 in the mutant complemented the mutant phenotype
