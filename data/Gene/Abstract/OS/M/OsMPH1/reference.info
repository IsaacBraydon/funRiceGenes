NA	OsMPH1 regulates plant height and improves grain yield in rice.	2017	PLoS One	Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Plant height is a major trait affecting yield potential in rice. Using a large-scale hybrid transcription factor approach, we identified the novel MYB-like transcription factor OsMPH1 (MYB-like gene of Plant Height 1), which is involved in the regulation of plant height in rice. Overexpression of OsMPH1 leads to increases of plant height and grain yield in rice, while knockdown of OsMPH1 leads to the opposite phenotypes. Microscopy of longitudinal stem sections indicated that a change in internode cell length resulted in the change in plant height. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of transgenic rice lines showed that multiple genes related to cell elongation and cell wall synthesis, which are associated with plant height and yield phenotypes, exhibited an altered expression profile. These results imply that OsMPH1 might be involved in specific recognition and signal transduction processes related to plant height and yield formation, providing further insights into the mechanisms underlying the regulation of plant height and providing a candidate gene for the efficient improvement of rice yield.
NA	OsMYB45 plays an important role in rice resistance to cadmium stress	2017	Plant Science	College of Life Science, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China	Cadmium (Cd) is one of the most toxic heavy metal elements in nature, and it causes serious damage to plant cells. Here, we report that a transcription factor OsMYB45 is involved in Cd stress response in rice. OsMYB45 is highly expressed in rice leaves, husks, stamens, pistils, and lateral roots, and its expression is induced by Cd stress. OsMYB45 fused to green fluorescent protein localized to the cell nucleus in onion epidermal cells. Mutation of OsMYB45 resulted in hypersensitivity to Cd treatment, and the concentration of H2O2 in the leaves of mutant nearly doubled, while catalase (CAT) activity was halved compared with the wild-type. Moreover, gene expression analysis indicated that OsCATA and OsCATC expression is significantly lower in the mutant than in the wild-type. In addition, overexpression of OsMYB45 in the mutant complemented the mutant phenotype. Taken together, OsMYB45 plays an important role in tolerance to Cd stress in rice.
