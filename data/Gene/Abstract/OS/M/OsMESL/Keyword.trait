OsMESL	resistance	Repressed OsMESL expression triggers reactive oxygen species-mediated broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.	Repressed OsMESL expression triggers reactive oxygen species-mediated broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.
OsMESL	resistance	Repressed OsMESL expression triggers reactive oxygen species-mediated broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.	 Complementary T-DNA mutants demonstrated a phenotype similar to the wild type (WT), thereby indicating that osmesl confers resistance to pathogens
OsMESL	resistance	Repressed OsMESL expression triggers reactive oxygen species-mediated broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.	 Overall, these results suggested that osmesl enhances disease resistance to Xoo, R
OsMESL	disease	Repressed OsMESL expression triggers reactive oxygen species-mediated broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.	Repressed OsMESL expression triggers reactive oxygen species-mediated broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.
OsMESL	disease	Repressed OsMESL expression triggers reactive oxygen species-mediated broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.	 The abundance of JA, a hormone associated with disease resistance, was significantly more in osmesl mutants than in WT plants
OsMESL	disease	Repressed OsMESL expression triggers reactive oxygen species-mediated broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.	 Overall, these results suggested that osmesl enhances disease resistance to Xoo, R
