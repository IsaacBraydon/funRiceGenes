14704206.pdf	Double-stranded RNA interference of a rice PI/GLO paralog, OsMADS2, uncovers its second-whorl-specific function in floral organ patterning	2003	Genetics	Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.	Unlike many eudicot species, grasses have duplicated PI/GLO-like genes. Functional analysis of one of the rice PI/GLO paralogs, OsMADS2, is reported here. Our data demonstrate its essential role in lodicule development and implicate the second PI/GLO paralog, OsMADS4, to suffice for stamen specification. We provide the first evidence for differential contributions of grass PI/GLO paralogs in patterning second- and third-whorl floral organs.

In recent years, there have been reports on genomic localization, protein motif structure, phylogenetic relationships, gene structure and expression of the entire MADS-box family in the model plant system, Arabidopsis. Though there have been some studies in rice as well, an analysis of the complete MADS-box family along with a comprehensive expression profiling was still awaited after the completion of rice genome sequencing. Furthermore, owing to the role of MADS-box family in flower development, an analysis involving structure, expression and functional aspects of MADS-box genes in rice and Arabidopsis was required to understand the role of this gene family in reproductive development. RESULTS: A genome-wide molecular characterization and microarray-based expression profiling of the genes encoding MADS-box transcription factor family in rice is presented. Using a thorough annotation exercise, 75 MADS-box genes have been identified in rice and categorized into MIKCc, MIKC*, Malpha, Mbeta and Mgamma groups based on phylogeny. Chromosomal localization of these genes reveals that 16 MADS-box genes, mostly MIKCc-type, are located within the duplicated segments of the rice genome, whereas most of the M-type genes, 20 in all, seem to have resulted from tandem duplications. Nine members belonging to the Mbeta group, which was considered absent in monocots, have also been identified. The expression profiles of all the MADS-box genes have been analyzed under 11 temporal stages of panicle and seed development, three abiotic stress conditions, along with three stages of vegetative development. Transcripts for 31 genes accumulate preferentially in the reproductive phase, of which, 12 genes are specifically expressed in seeds, and six genes show expression specific to panicle development. Differential expression of seven genes under stress conditions is also evident. An attempt has been made to gain insight into plausible functions of rice MADS-box genes by collating the expression data of functionally validated genes in rice and Arabidopsis. CONCLUSION: Only a limited number of MADS genes have been functionally validated in rice. A comprehensive annotation and transcriptome profiling undertaken in this investigation adds to our understanding of the involvement of MADS-box family genes during reproductive development and stress in rice and also provides the basis for selection of candidate genes for functional validation studies.
GEN1761283.pdf	Divergent regulatory OsMADS2 functions control size, shape and differentiation of the highly derived rice floret second-whorl organ	2007	Genetics	Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.	Functional diversification of duplicated genes can contribute to the emergence of new organ morphologies. Model eudicot plants like Arabidopsis thaliana and Antirrhinum majus have a single PI/GLO gene that together with AP3/DEF regulate petal and stamen formation. Lodicules of grass flowers are morphologically distinct reduced organs occupying the position of petals in other flowers. They serve a distinct function in partial and transient flower opening to allow stamen emergence and cross-pollination. Grasses have duplicated PI/GLO-like genes and in rice (Oryza sativa) one these genes, OsMADS2, controls lodicule formation without affecting stamen development. In this study, we investigate the mechanistic roles played by OsMADS2. We ascribe a function for OsMADS2 in controlling cell division and differentiation along the proximal-distal axis. OsMADS2 is required to trigger parenchymatous and lodicule-specific vascular development while maintaining a small organ size. Our data implicate the developmentally late spatially restricted accumulation of OsMADS2 transcripts in the differentiating lodicule to control growth of these regions. The global architecture of transcripts regulated by OsMADS2 gives insights into the regulation of cell division and vascular differentiation that together can form this highly modified grass organ with important functions in floret opening and stamen emergence independent of the paralogous gene OsMADS4.
Plant Cell Physiol-2008-Yao-853-7.pdf	Unequal genetic redundancy of rice PISTILLATA orthologs, OsMADS2 and OsMADS4, in lodicule and stamen development	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	Hokuriku Research Center, National Agricultural Research Center, Niigata, 943-0193 Japan.	Two homologs of PISTILLATA have been identified in rice: OsMADS2 and OsMADS4. However, their roles in floral organ development are controversial. Here, we demonstrate that the genes show unequal redundancy of class B function. Although OsMADS2 plays an important role in lodicule development, OsMADS4 also supports the specification of lodicule identity. In contrast, the genes are roughly equally important in stamen development. Consistent with their redundant functions, both OsMADS2 and OsMADS4 interact with the unique rice AP3 ortholog SPW1.
