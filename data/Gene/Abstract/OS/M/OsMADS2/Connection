OsMADS2	OsMADS4	Divergent regulatory OsMADS2 functions control size, shape and differentiation of the highly derived rice floret second-whorl organ	 The global architecture of transcripts regulated by OsMADS2 gives insights into the regulation of cell division and vascular differentiation that together can form this highly modified grass organ with important functions in floret opening and stamen emergence independent of the paralogous gene OsMADS4
OsMADS2	OsMADS4	Unequal genetic redundancy of rice PISTILLATA orthologs, OsMADS2 and OsMADS4, in lodicule and stamen development	Two homologs of PISTILLATA have been identified in rice: OsMADS2 and OsMADS4| Although OsMADS2 plays an important role in lodicule development, OsMADS4 also supports the specification of lodicule identity| Consistent with their redundant functions, both OsMADS2 and OsMADS4 interact with the unique rice AP3 ortholog SPW1|Unequal genetic redundancy of rice PISTILLATA orthologs, OsMADS2 and OsMADS4, in lodicule and stamen development
