miR408|OsMIR408|OsmiR408	OsmiR396	OsmiR396/Growth Regulating Factor modulate rice grain size through direct regulation of embryo-specific miR408	 Our findings suggest that genetic regulatory networks comprising various miRNAs, such as OsmiR396 and OsmiR408, may be crucial for controlling rice grain size
OsGRF8	OsmiR396	OsmiR396/Growth Regulating Factor modulate rice grain size through direct regulation of embryo-specific miR408	 The grain shape of Growth Regulating Factor8 (OsGRF8)-overexpressing transgenic plants was most similar to that of MIM396 plants, suggesting OsGRF8 is a major mediator of OsmiR396 in grain size regulation
