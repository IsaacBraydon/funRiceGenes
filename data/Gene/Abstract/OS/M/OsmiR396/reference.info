NA	SLENDER RICE1 and Oryza sativa INDETERMINATE DOMAIN2 Regulating OsmiR396 Is Involved in Stem Elongation.	2020	Plant Physiol	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology/Key Laboratory of the Ministry of CITY: Yangzhou STATE: Jiangsu province POSTAL_CODE: 225009 China [CN].	Gibberellins (GAs) play key roles in controlling cell proliferation through the GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1)/DELLA-mediated pathway. However, how DELLA proteins affect downstream pathways is not well understood. Therefore, discovering the signaling events downstream of DELLAs is key to better understanding the roles of GAs in plant development. Here we discovered that miR396 is regulated by SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1) in controlling cell proliferation. The positive response of rice (Oryza sativa) GROWTH-REGULATING FACTORs (OsGRFs) to GAs was found to be caused by a negative response of miR396 to GAs. miR396 acts downstream of SLR1 and upstream of GA-induced cell-cycle genes. Rice INDETERMINATE DOMAIN2 (OsIDD2) directly binds the promoter of OsmiR396a and can interact with SLR1 in vivo and in vitro. Rice lines overexpressing miR396a (miR396OE) or OsIDD2 (OsIDD2OE) displayed dwarfism resulting from higher abundance of miR396 RNA. However, the stem elongation of OsIDD2OE plants could be significantly stimulated by applying exogenous GA3, while that of miR396OE plants could not. Rice with OsIDD2 knocked down by RNA interference (OsIDD2RNAi) showed a slr1-like phenotype, in which the expression of miR396 was inhibited while its targets were enhanced. The protein levels of OsIDD2 were unaffected by GA in the wild type and OsIDD2OE plants, implying that OSIDD2 promotes the expression of miR396 and likely requires the coactivator of SLR1. Taken together, these results provided a close link between SLR1/OsIDD2 and GRFs via a negative regulator, miR396, and thus highlighted a molecular mechanism of GA-mediated cell proliferation in rice.
NA	OsmiR396/Growth Regulating Factor modulate rice grain size through direct regulation of embryo-specific miR408	2021	Plant Physiol	Key Laboratory of Insect Developmental and Evolutionary Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200032, China.	microRNAs (miRNAs) are promising targets for crop improvement of complex agricultural traits. Coordinated activity between/among different miRNAs may fine-tune specific developmental processes in diverse organisms. Grain size is a main factor determining rice (Oryza sativa L.) crop yield, but the network of miRNAs influencing this trait remains uncharacterized. Here we show that sequestering OsmiR396 through target mimicry (MIM396) can substantially increase grain size in several japonica and indica rice subspecies and in plants with excessive tillers and a high panicle density. Thus, OsmiR396 has a major role related to the regulation of rice grain size. The grain shape of Growth Regulating Factor8 (OsGRF8)-overexpressing transgenic plants was most similar to that of MIM396 plants, suggesting OsGRF8 is a major mediator of OsmiR396 in grain size regulation. A miRNA microarray analysis revealed changes to the expression of many miRNAs, including OsmiR408, in the MIM396 plants. Analyses of gene expression patterns and functions indicated OsmiR408 is an embryo-specific miRNA that positively regulates grain size. Silencing OsmiR408 expression (miR408KO) using CRISPR technology resulted in small grains. Moreover, we revealed the direct regulatory effects of OsGRF8 on OsMIR408 expression. A genetic analysis further showed that the large-grain phenotype of MIM396 plants could be complemented by miR408KO. Also, several hormone signaling pathways might be involved in the OsmiR396/GRF-meditated grain size regulation. Our findings suggest that genetic regulatory networks comprising various miRNAs, such as OsmiR396 and OsmiR408, may be crucial for controlling rice grain size. Furthermore, the OsmiR396/GRF module may be important for breeding new high-yielding rice varieties.
