OsmiR396	stem	SLENDER RICE1 and Oryza sativa INDETERMINATE DOMAIN2 Regulating OsmiR396 Is Involved in Stem Elongation.	SLENDER RICE1 and Oryza sativa INDETERMINATE DOMAIN2 Regulating OsmiR396 Is Involved in Stem Elongation.
OsmiR396	growth	OsmiR396/Growth Regulating Factor modulate rice grain size through direct regulation of embryo-specific miR408	 The grain shape of Growth Regulating Factor8 (OsGRF8)-overexpressing transgenic plants was most similar to that of MIM396 plants, suggesting OsGRF8 is a major mediator of OsmiR396 in grain size regulation
OsmiR396	panicle	OsmiR396/Growth Regulating Factor modulate rice grain size through direct regulation of embryo-specific miR408	 Here we show that sequestering OsmiR396 through target mimicry (MIM396) can substantially increase grain size in several japonica and indica rice subspecies and in plants with excessive tillers and a high panicle density
OsmiR396	grain	OsmiR396/Growth Regulating Factor modulate rice grain size through direct regulation of embryo-specific miR408	 Here we show that sequestering OsmiR396 through target mimicry (MIM396) can substantially increase grain size in several japonica and indica rice subspecies and in plants with excessive tillers and a high panicle density
OsmiR396	grain	OsmiR396/Growth Regulating Factor modulate rice grain size through direct regulation of embryo-specific miR408	 Thus, OsmiR396 has a major role related to the regulation of rice grain size

OsmiR396	grain	OsmiR396/Growth Regulating Factor modulate rice grain size through direct regulation of embryo-specific miR408	 Our findings suggest that genetic regulatory networks comprising various miRNAs, such as OsmiR396 and OsmiR408, may be crucial for controlling rice grain size
