NA	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	2014	Plant Sci	College of Life Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, PR China.	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways have been implicated in signal transduction of both biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. In this study, we found that the transcript of a rice (Oryza sativa) MAPKK (OsMKK1) was markedly increased by salt stress. By examining the survival rate and Na(+) content in shoot, we found that OsMKK1-knockout (osmkk1) mutant was more sensitive to salt stress than the wild type. OsMKK1 activity in the wild-type seedlings and protoplasts was increased by salt stress. Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro and in vivo kinase assays revealed that OsMKK1 targeted OsMPK4. OsMPK4 activity was increased by salt, which was impaired in osmkk1 plants. In contrast, overexpression of OsMKK1 increased OsMPK4 activity in protoplasts. By comparing the transcription factors levels between WT and osmkk1 mutant, OsMKK1 was necessary for salt-induced increase in OsDREB2B and OsMYBS3. Taken together, the data suggest that OsMKK1 and OsMPK4 constitute a signaling pathway that regulates salt stress tolerance in rice.
NA	Rice calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase directly phosphorylates a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase to regulate abscisic acid responses	2021	Plant Cell	College of Life Sciences, National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Crop Physiology Ecology and Production Management, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) is an important positive regulator of abscisic acid (ABA) and abiotic stress signaling in plants and is believed to act upstream of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in ABA signaling. However, it is unclear how CCaMK activates MAPK in ABA signaling. Here, we show that OsDMI3, a rice (Oryza sativa) CCaMK, directly interacts with and phosphorylates OsMKK1, a MAPK kinase (MKK) in rice, in vitro and in vivo. OsDMI3 was found to directly phosphorylate Thr-25 in the N-terminus of OsMKK1, and this Thr-25 phosphorylation is OsDMI3-specific in ABA signaling. The activation of OsMKK1 and its downstream kinase OsMPK1 is dependent on Thr-25 phosphorylation of OsMKK1 in ABA signaling. Moreover, ABA treatment induces phosphorylation in the activation loop of OsMKK1, and the two phosphorylations, in the N-terminus and in the activation loop, are independent. Further analyses revealed that OsDMI3-mediated phosphorylation of OsMKK1 positively regulates ABA responses in seed germination, root growth, and tolerance to both water stress and oxidative stress. Our results indicate that OsMKK1 is a direct target of OsDMI3, and OsDMI3-mediated phosphorylation of OsMKK1 plays an important role in activating the MAPK cascade and ABA signaling.
NA	Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase OsMEK2 and OsMPK1 Signaling Is Required for Ferroptotic Cell Death in Rice- Magnaporthe oryzae Interactions	2021	Front Plant Sci	Division of Integrative Bioscience and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea.	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling is required for plant cell death responses to invading microbial pathogens. Iron- and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent ferroptotic cell death occurs in rice (Oryza sativa) during an incompatible rice-Magnaporthe oryzae interaction. Here, we show that rice MAP kinase (OsMEK2 and OsMPK1) signaling cascades are involved in iron- and ROS-dependent ferroptotic cell death responses of rice to M. oryzae infection using OsMEK2 knock-out mutant and OsMEK2 and OsMPK1 overexpression rice plants. The OsMPK1:GFP and OsWRKY90:GFP transcription factor were localized to the nuclei, suggesting that OsMPK1 in the cytoplasm moves into the nuclei to interact with the WRKY90. M. oryzae infection in ¦¤Osmek2 knock-out plants did not trigger iron and ROS accumulation and lipid peroxidation, and also downregulated OsMPK1, OsWRKY90, OsRbohB, and OsPR-1b expression. However, 35S:OsMEK2 overexpression induced ROS- and iron-dependent cell death in rice. The downstream MAP kinase (OsMPK1) overexpression induced ROS- and iron-dependent ferroptotic cell death response to virulent M. oryzae infection. The small-molecule ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 suppressed iron- and ROS-dependent ferroptotic cell death in 35S:OsMPK1 overexpression plants. However, the small-molecule inducer erastin triggered iron- and lipid ROS-dependent, but OsMEK2-independent, ferroptotic cell death during M. oryzae infection. Disease (susceptibility)-related cell death was lipid ROS-dependent, but iron-independent in the ¦¤Osmek2 knock-out mutant during the late M. oryzae infection stage. These combined results suggest that OsMEK2 and OsMPK1 expression positively regulates iron- and ROS-dependent ferroptotic cell death, and blast disease (susceptibility)-related cell death was ROS-dependent but iron-independent in rice-M. oryzae interactions.
NA	Rice iron storage protein ferritin 2 (OsFER2) positively regulates ferroptotic cell death and defense responses against Magnaporthe oryzae.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Division of Integrative Bioscience and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea.	Ferritin is a ubiquitous iron storage protein that regulates iron homeostasis and oxidative stress in plants. Iron plays an important role in ferroptotic cell death response of rice (Oryza sativa) to Magnaporthe oryzae infection. Here, we and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent ferroptotic cell death and defense response against the avirulent M. oryzae INA168. The full-length ferritin OsFER2 and its transit peptide were localized to the chloroplast, the most Fe-rich organelle for photosynthesis. This suggests that the transit peptide acts as a signal peptide for the rice ferritin OsFER2 to move into chloroplasts. OsFER2 expression is involved in rice resistance to M. oryzae infection. OsFER2 knock-out in wild-type rice HY did not induce ROS and ferric ion (Fe(3+)) accumulation, lipid peroxidation and hypersensitive response (HR) cell death, and also downregulated the defense-related genes OsPAL1, OsPR1-b, OsRbohB, OsNADP-ME2-3, OsMEK2 and OsMPK1, and vacuolar membrane transporter OsVIT2 expression. OsFER2 complementation in Î”Osfer2 knock-out mutants restored ROS and iron accumulation and HR cell death phenotypes during infection. The iron chelator deferoxamine, the lipid-ROS scavenger ferrostatin-1, the actin microfilament polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin E and the redox inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium suppressed ROS and iron accumulation and HR cell death in rice leaf sheaths. However, the small-molecule inducer erastin did not trigger iron-dependent ROS accumulation and HR cell death induction in Î”Osfer2 mutants. These combined results suggest and ROS-dependent ferroptotic cell death and defense response in rice-M. oryzae interactions.
