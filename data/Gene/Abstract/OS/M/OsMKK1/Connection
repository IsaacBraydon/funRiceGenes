MYBS3|OsMYBS3	OsMKK1	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	By comparing the transcription factors levels between WT and osmkk1 mutant, OsMKK1 was necessary for salt-induced increase in OsDREB2B and OsMYBS3
OsDREB2B	OsMKK1	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	By comparing the transcription factors levels between WT and osmkk1 mutant, OsMKK1 was necessary for salt-induced increase in OsDREB2B and OsMYBS3
OsMKK1	OsMPK6|OsMPK4	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro and in vivo kinase assays revealed that OsMKK1 targeted OsMPK4
OsMKK1	OsMPK6|OsMPK4	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	OsMPK4 activity was increased by salt, which was impaired in osmkk1 plants
OsMKK1	OsMPK6|OsMPK4	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	In contrast, overexpression of OsMKK1 increased OsMPK4 activity in protoplasts
OsMKK1	OsMPK6|OsMPK4	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	Taken together, the data suggest that OsMKK1 and OsMPK4 constitute a signaling pathway that regulates salt stress tolerance in rice
OsMAPKKK63	OsMKK1	OsMAPKKK63 is involved in salt stress response and seed dormancy control.	 Our data indicate that OsMAPKKK63 possesses in vitro kinase activity and that it interacts with rice MAP kinase kinase OsMKK1 and OsMKK6
