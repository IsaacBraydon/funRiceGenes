OsMKK1	transcription factor	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	 By comparing the transcription factors levels between WT and osmkk1 mutant, OsMKK1 was necessary for salt-induced increase in OsDREB2B and OsMYBS3
OsMKK1	salt	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	 OsMKK1 activity in the wild-type seedlings and protoplasts was increased by salt stress
OsMKK1	salt	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	 Taken together, the data suggest that OsMKK1 and OsMPK4 constitute a signaling pathway that regulates salt stress tolerance in rice
OsMKK1	salt stress	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	 OsMKK1 activity in the wild-type seedlings and protoplasts was increased by salt stress
OsMKK1	salt stress	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	 Taken together, the data suggest that OsMKK1 and OsMPK4 constitute a signaling pathway that regulates salt stress tolerance in rice
OsMKK1	tolerance	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	 Taken together, the data suggest that OsMKK1 and OsMPK4 constitute a signaling pathway that regulates salt stress tolerance in rice
OsMKK1	stress	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	 OsMKK1 activity in the wild-type seedlings and protoplasts was increased by salt stress
OsMKK1	stress	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	 Taken together, the data suggest that OsMKK1 and OsMPK4 constitute a signaling pathway that regulates salt stress tolerance in rice
OsMKK1	stress tolerance	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	 Taken together, the data suggest that OsMKK1 and OsMPK4 constitute a signaling pathway that regulates salt stress tolerance in rice
OsMKK1	Kinase	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	 Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro and in vivo kinase assays revealed that OsMKK1 targeted OsMPK4
OsMKK1	seedlings	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	 OsMKK1 activity in the wild-type seedlings and protoplasts was increased by salt stress
