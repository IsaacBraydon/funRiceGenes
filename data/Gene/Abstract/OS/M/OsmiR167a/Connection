OsARF12	OsmiR167a	OsmiR167a-targeted auxin response factors modulate tiller angle via fine-tuning auxin distribution in rice.	 In the overexpression of OsMIR167a plants, the expression of OsARF12, OsARF17 and OsARF25 were severely repressed, and displayed larger tiller angle as well as the osarf12/osarf17 and osarf12/ osarf25 plants
OsARF12	OsmiR167a	OsmiR167a-targeted auxin response factors modulate tiller angle via fine-tuning auxin distribution in rice.	 Our results reveal that OsmiR167a represses its targets, OsARF12, OsARF17 and OsARF25, to control rice tiller angle by fine-tuning auxin asymmetric distribution in shoots
OsARF17	OsmiR167a	OsmiR167a-targeted auxin response factors modulate tiller angle via fine-tuning auxin distribution in rice.	 In the overexpression of OsMIR167a plants, the expression of OsARF12, OsARF17 and OsARF25 were severely repressed, and displayed larger tiller angle as well as the osarf12/osarf17 and osarf12/ osarf25 plants
