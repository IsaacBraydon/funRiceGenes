OsMT2b	A 146-bp sugar response complex MTSRC is identified in the promoter of rice metallothionein OsMT2b gene conferring high-level expression of luciferase reporter gene and bioactive recombinant haFGF in transgenic rice |  A rice subfamily type 2 plant metallothionein (pMT) gene, OsMT2b, encoding a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger protein, has been previously shown to exhibit the most abundant gene expression in young rice seedling |  Expression of OsMT2b was found to be regulated negatively by ethylene and hydrogen peroxide in rice stem node under flooding stress, but little is known about its response to sugar depletion |  In this study, transient expression assay and transgenic approach were employed to characterize the regulation of the OsMT2b gene expression in rice |  We found that the expression of OsMT2b gene is induced by sugar starvation in both rice suspension cells and germinated embryos
