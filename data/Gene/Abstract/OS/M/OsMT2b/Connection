OsMT2b	OsRac1	Down-regulation of metallothionein, a reactive oxygen scavenger, by the small GTPase OsRac1 in rice	 We found that the expression of a metallothionein gene (OsMT2b) was synergically down-regulated by OsRac1 and rice (Oryza sativa) blast-derived elicitors| Taken together, these results showed that OsMT2b is an ROS scavenger and its expression is down-regulated by OsRac1, thus potentiating ROS, which function as signals in resistance response
