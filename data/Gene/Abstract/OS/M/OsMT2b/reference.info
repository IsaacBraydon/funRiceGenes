10.1007-s00299-013-1555-6.pdf	The promoter and the 5'-untranslated region of rice metallothionein OsMT2b gene are capable of directing high-level gene expression in germinated rice embryos	2014	Plant Cell Rep	Department of Bioagricultural Science, National Chiayi University, Chiayi, 60004, Taiwan, ROC.	KEY MESSAGE: Critical regions within the rice metallothionein OsMT2b gene promoter are identified and the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) is found essential for the high-level promoter activity in germinated transgenic rice embryos. Many metallothionein (MT) genes are highly expressed in plant tissues. A rice subfamily p2 (type 2) MT gene, OsMT2b, has been shown previously to exhibit the most abundant gene expression in young rice seedling. In the present study, transient expression assays and a transgenic approach were employed to characterize the expression of the OsMT2b gene in rice. We found that the OsMT2b gene is strongly and differentially expressed in germinated rice embryos during seed germination and seedling development. Histochemical staining analysis of transgenic rice carrying OsMT2b::GUS chimeric gene showed that high-level GUS activity was detected in germinated embryos and at the meristematic part of other tissues during germination. Deletion analysis of the OsMT2b promoter revealed that the 5'-flanking region of the OsMT2b between nucleotides -351 and -121 relative to the transcriptional initiation site is important for promoter activity in rice embryos, and this region contains the consensus sequences of G box and TA box. Our study demonstrates that the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of OsMT2b gene is not only necessary for the OsMT2b promoter activity, but also sufficient to augment the activity of a minimal promoter in both transformed cell cultures and germinated transgenic embryos in rice. We also found that addition of the maize Ubi intron 1 significantly enhanced the OsMT2b promoter activity in rice embryos. Our studies reveal that OsMT2b351-ubi(In) promoter can be applied in plant transformation and represents potential for driving high-level production of foreign proteins in transgenic rice.

Metallothioneins are small, ubiquitous Cys-rich proteins known to be involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and metal homeostasis. We found that the expression of a metallothionein gene (OsMT2b) was synergically down-regulated by OsRac1 and rice (Oryza sativa) blast-derived elicitors. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsMT2b showed increased susceptibility to bacterial blight and blast fungus. OsMT2b-overexpressing cells showed reduced elicitor-induced hydrogen peroxide production. In contrast, homozygous OsMT2b::Tos17-inserted mutant and OsMT2b-RNAi-silenced transgenic cells showed significantly higher elicitor-induced hydrogen peroxide production than the wild-type cells. In vitro assay showed that recombinant OsMT2b protein possessed superoxide- and hydroxyl radical-scavenging activities. Taken together, these results showed that OsMT2b is an ROS scavenger and its expression is down-regulated by OsRac1, thus potentiating ROS, which function as signals in resistance response. The results suggest that OsRac1 plays a dual role as an inducer of ROS production and a suppressor of ROS scavenging.
pp1461637.pdf	Characteristic and expression analysis of a metallothionein gene, OsMT2b, down-regulated by cytokinin suggests functions in root development and seed embryo germination of rice	2008	Plant Physiol	College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China.	Metallothioneins (MTs) are low molecular mass and cysteine-rich metal-binding proteins known to be mainly involved in maintaining metal homeostasis and stress responses. But, their functions in higher plant development are scarcely studied. Here, we characterized rice (Oryza sativa) METALLOTHIONEIN2b (OsMT2b) molecularly and found that its expression was down-regulated by cytokinins. OsMT2b was preferentially expressed in rice immature panicles, scutellum of germinating embryos, and primordium of lateral roots. In contrast with wild-type plants, OsMT2b-RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants had serious handicap in plant growth and root formation, whereas OsMT2b-overexpressing transformants were dwarfed and presented more adventitious roots and big lateral roots. The increased cytokinin levels in RNAi plants and decreased cytokinin levels in overexpressing plants were confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography quantitative analysis in the roots of wild-type and transgenic plants. In RNAi plants, localization of isopentenyladenosine, a kind of endogenous cytokinin, in roots and germinating embryos expanded to the whole tissues, whereas in overexpressing plants, the isopentenyladenosine signals were very faint in the vascular tissues of roots and scutellum cells of germinating embryos. In vitro culture of embryos could largely resume the reduced germination frequency in RNAi plants but had no obvious change in overexpressing plants. Taken together, these results indicate a possible feedback regulation mechanism of OsMT2b to the level of endogenous cytokinins that is involved in root development and seed embryo germination of rice.
