OsMED14_1	 We analyzed its expression pattern through RNA in situ hybridization and pOsMED14_1:GUS transgenics that showed its expression in roots, leaves, anthers and seeds prominently at younger stages, indicating possible involvement of this subunit in multiple aspects of rice development	 To understand the developmental roles of OsMED14_1 in rice, we generated and studied RNAi-based knockdown rice plants that showed multiple effects including less height, narrower leaves and culms with reduced vasculature, lesser lateral root branching, defective microspore development, reduced panicle branching and seed set, and smaller seeds
