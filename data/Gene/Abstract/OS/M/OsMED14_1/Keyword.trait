OsMED14_1	transcription factor	Mediator subunit OsMED14_1 plays an important role in rice development.	 OsMED14_1 physically interacts with transcription factors YABBY5, TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION (TDR) and MADS29, possibly regulating auxin homeostasis and ultimately leading to lateral organ/leaf, microspore and seed development
OsMED14_1	root	Mediator subunit OsMED14_1 plays an important role in rice development.	 To understand the developmental roles of OsMED14_1 in rice, we generated and studied RNAi-based knockdown rice plants that showed multiple effects including less height, narrower leaves and culms with reduced vasculature, lesser lateral root branching, defective microspore development, reduced panicle branching and seed set, and smaller seeds
