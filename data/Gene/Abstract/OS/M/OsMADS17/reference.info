NA	OsMADS17 simultaneously increases grain number and grain weight in rice.	2023	Nat Commun	Department of Plant Genetics and Breeding, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.	During the processes of rice domestication and improvement, a trade-off effect between grain number and grain weight was a major obstacle for increasing yield. Here, we identify a critical gene COG1, encoding the transcription factor OsMADS17, with a 65-bp deletion in the 5&#x27; untranslated region (5&#x27; UTR) presented in cultivated rice increasing grain number and grain weight simultaneously through decreasing mRNA translation efficiency. OsMADS17 controls grain yield by regulating multiple genes and that the interaction with one of them, OsAP2-39, has been characterized. Besides, the expression of OsMADS17 is regulated by OsMADS1 directly. It indicates that OsMADS1-OsMADS17-OsAP2-39 participates in the regulatory network controlling grain yield, and downregulation of OsMADS17 or OsAP2-39 expression can further improve grain yield by simultaneously increasing grain number and grain weight. Our findings provide insights into understanding the molecular basis co-regulating rice yield-related traits, and offer a strategy for breeding higher-yielding rice varieties.
