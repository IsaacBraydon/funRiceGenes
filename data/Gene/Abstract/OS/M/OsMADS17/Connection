OsAP2-39	OsMADS17	OsMADS17 simultaneously increases grain number and grain weight in rice.	 OsMADS17 controls grain yield by regulating multiple genes and that the interaction with one of them, OsAP2-39, has been characterized
OsAP2-39	OsMADS17	OsMADS17 simultaneously increases grain number and grain weight in rice.	 It indicates that OsMADS1-OsMADS17-OsAP2-39 participates in the regulatory network controlling grain yield, and downregulation of OsMADS17 or OsAP2-39 expression can further improve grain yield by simultaneously increasing grain number and grain weight
OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	OsMADS17	OsMADS17 simultaneously increases grain number and grain weight in rice.	 Besides, the expression of OsMADS17 is regulated by OsMADS1 directly
