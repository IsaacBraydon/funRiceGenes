CEBiP|OsCEBiP	OsMYB22	Warm temperature compromises JA-regulated basal resistance to enhance Magnaporthe oryzae infection in rice.	 Among these affected genes, OsCEBiP (chitin elicitor-binding protein precursor) was found to be directly regulated by OsMYB22 and its interacting protein OsMYC2, a key component of JA signaling, and this contributed to temperature-modulated blast resistance
