NA	Warm temperature compromises JA-regulated basal resistance to enhance Magnaporthe oryzae infection in rice.	2022	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 311400, China.	Changes in global temperatures profoundly affect the occurrence of plant diseases. It is well known that rice blast can easily become epidemic in relatively warm weather. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we show that enhanced blast development at a warm temperature (22°C) compared with the normal growth temperature (28°C) is rice plant-determined. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and signaling genes in rice could be effectively induced by Magnaporthe oryzae at 28°C but not at 22°C. Phenotypic analyses of the osaoc1 and osmyc2 mutants, OsCOI1 RNAi lines, and OsMYC2-OE plants further demonstrated that compromised M. oryzae-induced JA biosynthesis and signaling lead to enhanced blast susceptibility at the warm temperature. Consistent with these results, we found that exogenous application of methyl jasmonate served as an effective strategy for improving blast resistance under the warm environmental conditions. Furthermore, decreased activation of JA signaling resulted in the downregulated expression of some key basal resistance genes at 22°C when compared with 28°C. Among these affected genes, OsCEBiP (chitin elicitor-binding protein precursor) was found to be directly regulated by OsMYB22 and its interacting protein OsMYC2, a key component of JA signaling, and this contributed to temperature-modulated blast resistance. Taken together, these results suggest that warm temperature compromises basal resistance in rice and enhances M. oryzae infection by reducing JA biosynthesis and signaling, providing potential new strategies for managing rice blast disease under warm climate conditions.
NA	A novel transcriptional repressor complex MYB22-TOPLESS-HDAC1 promotes rice resistance to brown planthopper by repressing F3&#x27;H expression.	2023	New Phytol	CAS Key Laboratory of Insect Developmental and Evolutionary Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 200032, Shanghai, China.	The brown planthopper (BPH) is the most destructive pest of rice. The MYB transcription factors are vital for rice immunity, but most are activators. Although MYB22 positively regulates rice resistance to BPH and has an EAR motif associated with active repression, it remains unclear whether it is a transcriptional repressor affecting rice-BPH interaction. Genetic analyses revealed that MYB22 regulates rice resistance to BPH via its EAR motif. Several biochemical experiments (e.g. transient transcription assay, Y2H, LCA, and BiFC) indicated that MYB22 is a transcriptional repressor that interacts with the corepressor TOPLESS via its EAR motif and recruits HDAC1 to form a tripartite complex. Flavonoid-3&#x27;-hydroxylase (F3&#x27;H) is a flavonoid biosynthesis pathway-related gene that negatively regulates rice resistance to BPH. Based on a bioinformatics analysis and the results of EMSA and transient transcription assays, MYB22 can bind directly to the F3&#x27;H promoter and repress gene expression along with TOPLESS and HDAC1. We revealed a transcriptional regulatory mechanism influencing the rice-BPH interaction that differs from previously reported mechanisms. Specifically, MYB22-TOPLESS-HDAC1 is a novel transcriptional repressor complex with components that synergistically and positively regulate rice resistance to BPH through the transcriptional repression of F3&#x27;H.
