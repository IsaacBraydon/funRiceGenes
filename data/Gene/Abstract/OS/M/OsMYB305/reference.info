NA	Overexpression of OsMYB305 in Rice Enhances the Nitrogen Uptake Under Low-Nitrogen Condition.	2020	Front Plant Sci	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	Excessive nitrogen fertilizer application causes severe environmental degradation and drives up agricultural production costs. Thus, improving crop nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is essential for the development of sustainable agriculture. Here, we characterized the roles of the MYB transcription factor OsMYB305 in nitrogen uptake and assimilation in rice. OsMYB305 encoded a transcriptional activator and its expression was induced by N deficiency in rice root. Under low-N condition, OsMYB305 overexpression significantly increased the tiller number, shoot dry weight and total N concentration. In the roots of OsMYB305-OE rice lines, the expression of OsNRT2.1, OsNRT2.2, OsNAR2.1, and OsNiR2 was up-regulated and (15)NO(3) (-) influx was significantly increased. In contrast, the expression of lignocellulose biosynthesis-related genes was repressed so that cellulose content decreased, and soluble sugar concentration increased. Certain intermediates in the glycolytic pathway and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were significantly altered and NADH-GOGAT, Pyr-K, and G6PDH were markedly elevated in the roots of OsMYB305-OE rice lines grown under low-N condition. Our results revealed that OsMYB305 overexpression suppressed cellulose biosynthesis under low-nitrogen condition, thereby freeing up carbohydrate for nitrate uptake and assimilation and enhancing rice growth. OsMYB305 is a potential molecular target for increasing NUE in rice.
