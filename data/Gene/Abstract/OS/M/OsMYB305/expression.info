OsMYB305	Overexpression of OsMYB305 in Rice Enhances the Nitrogen Uptake Under Low-Nitrogen Condition. |  OsMYB305 encoded a transcriptional activator and its expression was induced by N deficiency in rice root |  Under low-N condition, OsMYB305 overexpression significantly increased the tiller number, shoot dry weight and total N concentration |  In the roots of OsMYB305-OE rice lines, the expression of OsNRT2 |  Our results revealed that OsMYB305 overexpression suppressed cellulose biosynthesis under low-nitrogen condition, thereby freeing up carbohydrate for nitrate uptake and assimilation and enhancing rice growth	Overexpression of OsMYB305 in Rice Enhances the Nitrogen Uptake Under Low-Nitrogen Condition. |  Under low-N condition, OsMYB305 overexpression significantly increased the tiller number, shoot dry weight and total N concentration |  Our results revealed that OsMYB305 overexpression suppressed cellulose biosynthesis under low-nitrogen condition, thereby freeing up carbohydrate for nitrate uptake and assimilation and enhancing rice growth
