NA	OsMATL mutation induces haploid seed formation in indica rice.	2018	Nat Plants	Syngenta Beijing Innovation Center, ZhongGuanCun Life Science Park, Beijing, China.	Intraspecific haploid induction in maize (Zea mays) is triggered by a native frameshift mutation in MATRILINEAL (MATL), which encodes a pollen-specific phospholipase. To develop a haploid inducer in rice (Oryza sativa), we generated an allelic series in the putative ZmMATL orthologue, OsMATL, and found that knockout mutations led to a reduced seed set and a 2-6% haploid induction rate. This demonstrates MATL functional conservation and represents a major advance for rice breeding.
