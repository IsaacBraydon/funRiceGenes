OZT1|OsMTP1	ZN	A vacuolar transporter plays important roles in zinc and cadmium accumulation in rice grain.	 OsMTP1 knockout decreased Zn concentration in the root cell sap, roots, aleurone layer and embryo, and subsequently increased Zn concentration in shoots and polished rice (endosperm) without yield penalty
OZT1|OsMTP1	ZN	A vacuolar transporter plays important roles in zinc and cadmium accumulation in rice grain.	 OsMTP1 haplotype analysis revealed elite alleles associated with increased Zn level in polished rice, mostly because of the decreased OsMTP1 transcripts
OZT1|OsMTP1	ZN	A vacuolar transporter plays important roles in zinc and cadmium accumulation in rice grain.	 OsMTP1 expression in yeast enhanced Zn tolerance but did not affect that of Cd
OZT1|OsMTP1	ZN	A vacuolar transporter plays important roles in zinc and cadmium accumulation in rice grain.	 While OsMTP1 knockout resulted in decreased uptake, translocation and accumulation of Cd in plant and rice grain, which could be attributed to the indirect effects of altered Zn accumulation
OZT1|OsMTP1	ZN	A vacuolar transporter plays important roles in zinc and cadmium accumulation in rice grain.	 Our results suggest that rice OsMTP1 primarily functions as a tonoplast-localized transporter for sequestrating Zn into vacuole
OZT1|OsMTP1	ZN	A vacuolar transporter plays important roles in zinc and cadmium accumulation in rice grain.	 OsMTP1 knockout elevated Zn concentration but prevented Cd deposition in polished rice without yield penalty
OZT1|OsMTP1	ZN	A vacuolar transporter plays important roles in zinc and cadmium accumulation in rice grain.	 Thus, OsMTP1 is a candidate gene for enhancing Zn level and reducing Cd level in rice grains
