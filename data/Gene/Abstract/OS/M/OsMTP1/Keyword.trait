OZT1|OsMTP1	homeostasis	Characterization of a vacuolar zinc transporter OZT1 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Together, OZT1 is a CDF family vacuolar zinc transporter conferring tolerance to Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) stress, which is important to transporting and homeostasis of Zn, Cd or other heavy metals in plants
OZT1|OsMTP1	transporter	Molecular characterization of a rice metal tolerance protein, OsMTP1	 Taken together, our results show that OsMTP1 is a bivalent cation transporter localized in the cell membrane, which is necessary for efficient translocation of Zn, Cd and other heavy metals, and maintain ion homeostasis in plant
OZT1|OsMTP1	Al tolerance	Functional analysis of the rice vacuolar zinc transporter OsMTP1	 OsMTP1 is a member of the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF)/metal tolerance protein (MTP) family of metal cation transporters in Oryza sativa, which is closely related to Arabidopsis thaliana MTP1

OZT1|OsMTP1	growth	Functional analysis of the rice vacuolar zinc transporter OsMTP1	 OsMTP1 alleviated, to some extent, the Co sensitivity of this mutant, rescued the Fe hypersensitivity of the ccc1 mutant at low Fe concentrations, and restored growth of the Cd-hypersensitive mutant ycf1 at low Cd concentrations
OZT1|OsMTP1	seedling	Characterization of a vacuolar zinc transporter OZT1 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 The OZT1 expression was significantly induced both in the seedlings of japonica rice Nipponbare and indica rice IR26 in response to Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) treatments
OZT1|OsMTP1	growth	Molecular characterization of a rice metal tolerance protein, OsMTP1	 OsMTP1 expression increased tolerance to Zn, Cd, and Ni in wild-type yeast BY4741 during the exponential growth phase
OZT1|OsMTP1	seedling	Molecular characterization of a rice metal tolerance protein, OsMTP1	 OsMTP1 dsRNAi mediated by transgenic assay in rice seedlings resulted in heavy metal sensitivity and changed the heavy metal accumulation in different organs of mature rice under low-concentration heavy metal stress
OZT1|OsMTP1	transporter	Characterization of a vacuolar zinc transporter OZT1 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 In this research, a full length cDNA named Oryza sativa Zn Transporter 1 (OZT1) that closely related to rat ZnT-2 (Zn Transporter 2) gene was isolated from rice
