Rice (Oryza sativa L. 'Nipponbare') cDNA subtractive suppression hybridization (SSH) libraries constructed using cadmium (Cd)-treated seedling roots were screened to isolate Cd-responsive genes. A cDNA clone, encoding the rice homolog of Metal Tolerance Protein (OsMTP1), was induced by Cd treatment. Plant MTPs belong to cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) protein family, which are widespread in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. OsMTP1 heterologous expression in yeast mutants showed that OsMTP1 was able to complement the mutant strains' hypersensitivity to Ni, Cd, and Zn, but not other metals including Co and Mn. OsMTP1 expression increased tolerance to Zn, Cd, and Ni in wild-type yeast BY4741 during the exponential growth phase. OsMTP1 fused to green fluorescent protein was localized in onion epidermal cell plasma membranes, consistent with an OsMTP1 function in heavy metal transporting. OsMTP1 dsRNAi mediated by transgenic assay in rice seedlings resulted in heavy metal sensitivity and changed the heavy metal accumulation in different organs of mature rice under low-concentration heavy metal stress. Taken together, our results show that OsMTP1 is a bivalent cation transporter localized in the cell membrane, which is necessary for efficient translocation of Zn, Cd and other heavy metals, and maintain ion homeostasis in plant.
J. Exp. Bot.-2013-Menguer-jxb-ert136.pdf	Functional analysis of the rice vacuolar zinc transporter OsMTP1	2013	J Exp Bot	Centre for Biological Science, University of Southampton, Life Sciences Building 85, Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1B, UK.	Heavy metal homeostasis is maintained in plant cells by specialized transporters which compartmentalize or efflux metal ions, maintaining cytosolic concentrations within a narrow range. OsMTP1 is a member of the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF)/metal tolerance protein (MTP) family of metal cation transporters in Oryza sativa, which is closely related to Arabidopsis thaliana MTP1. Functional complementation of the Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant mtp1-1 demonstrates that OsMTP1 transports Zn in planta and localizes at the tonoplast. When heterologously expressed in the yeast mutant zrc1 cot1, OsMTP1 complemented its Zn hypersensitivity and was also localized to the vacuole. OsMTP1 alleviated, to some extent, the Co sensitivity of this mutant, rescued the Fe hypersensitivity of the ccc1 mutant at low Fe concentrations, and restored growth of the Cd-hypersensitive mutant ycf1 at low Cd concentrations. These results suggest that OsMTP1 transports Zn but also Co, Fe, and Cd, possibly with lower affinity. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed two substitutions in OsMTP1 that alter the transport function of this protein. OsMTP1 harbouring a substitution of Leu82 to a phenylalanine can still transport low levels of Zn, with an enhanced affinity for Fe and Co, and a gain of function for Mn. A substitution of His90 with an aspartic acid completely abolishes Zn transport but improves Fe transport in OsMTP1. These amino acid residues are important in determining substrate specificity and may be a starting point for refining transporter activity in possible biotechnological applications, such as biofortification and phytoremediation.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs11033-012-2162-2.pdf	Characterization of a vacuolar zinc transporter OZT1 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2013	Mol Biol Rep	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, People's Republic of China.	The CDF family is a ubiquitous family that has been identified in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archaea. Members of this family are important heavy metal transporters that transport metal ions out of the cytoplasm. In this research, a full length cDNA named Oryza sativa Zn Transporter 1 (OZT1) that closely related to rat ZnT-2 (Zn Transporter 2) gene was isolated from rice. The OZT1 encoding a CDF family protein shares 28.2 % ~ 84.3 % of identities and 49.3 % ~ 90.9 % of similarities with other zinc transporters such as RnZnT-2, HsZnT-8, RnZnT-8 and AtMTP1. OZT1 was constitutively expressed in various rice tissues. The OZT1 expression was significantly induced both in the seedlings of japonica rice Nipponbare and indica rice IR26 in response to Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) treatments. Besides, OZT1 expression was also increased when exposed to other excess metals, such as Cu(2+), Fe(2+) and Mg(2+). Subcellular localization analysis indicated that OZT1 localized to vacuole. Heterologous expression of OZT1 in yeast increased tolerance to Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) stress but not the Mg(2+) stress. Together, OZT1 is a CDF family vacuolar zinc transporter conferring tolerance to Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) stress, which is important to transporting and homeostasis of Zn, Cd or other heavy metals in plants.
NA	Enhanced cadmium accumulation and tolerance in transgenic tobacco overexpressing rice metal tolerance protein gene OsMTP1 is promising for phytoremediation	2016	Plant Physiology and Biochemistry	Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur 721302, India	One of the most grievous heavy metal pollutants in the environment is cadmium (Cd), which is not only responsible for the crop yield loss owing to its phytotoxicity, but also for the human health hazards as the toxic elements accumulated in the consumable parts of crop plants. In the present study, we aimed to isolate and functionally characterize the OsMTP1 gene from indica rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. IR64) to study its potential application for efficient phytoremediation of Cd. The 1257 bp coding DNA sequence (CDS) of OsMTP1 encodes a ∼46 kDa protein belonging to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) or metal tolerance/transport protein (MTP) family. The OsMTP1 transcript in rice plant was found to respond during external Cd stress. Heterologous expression of OsMTP1 in tobacco resulted in the reduction of Cd stress-induced phytotoxic effects, including growth inhibition, lipid peroxidation, and cell death. Compared to untransformed control, the transgenic tobacco plants showed enhanced vacuolar thiol content, indicating vacuolar localization of the sequestered Cd. The transgenic tobacco plants exhibited significantly higher biomass growth (2.2–2.8-folds) and hyperaccumulation of Cd (1.96–2.22-folds) compared to untransformed control under Cd exposure. The transgenic plants also showed moderate tolerance and accumulation of arsenic (As) upon exogenous As stress, signifying broad substrate specificity of OsMTP1. Together, findings of our research suggest that the transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsMTP1 with its hyperaccumulating activity and increased growth rate could be useful for future phytoremediation applications to clean up the Cd-contaminated soil.
NA	Salicylic acid application alleviates cadmium accumulation in brown rice by modulating its shoot to grain translocation in rice	2021	Chemosphere	Key Laboratory of Marine Food Quality and Hazard Controlling Technology of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, 310018, China. Electronic address: wfj0311@cjlu.edu.cn.	Cadmium (Cd) contamination, which poses a serious threat to human health, has been recognized as a major threat to the agricultural system and crop production. Salicylic acid (SA) is a signaling molecule that plays an important role in against Cd toxicity. Previously, we found that spraying rice with SA could reduce the Cd accumulation in rice grains grown in Cd-contaminated soil. In this study, we studied the specific mechanism of SA spray on reducing Cd accumulation in rice grain. The results showed that treatment with SA could alleviate Cd toxicity in rice by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes that reduce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation, but not by changing the pH, or total or available Cd of the soil. The key factor by which SA treatment reduced Cd accumulation in rice grains was by decreasing the Cd content in rice leaves at the flowering stage. This indicated that SA could modulate the Cd accumulation in shoots, reducing the Cd translocation to rice grains. Furthermore, SA could increase the H2O2 content, activating the SA-signaling pathway and modulating the expression levels of Cd transporters (OsLCT1 and OsLCD) in rice leaves to increase Cd tolerance and reduce Cd accumulation in the rice grain. Thus, spraying rice with SA may be effective measure to cope with Cd contamination in paddy soils.
NA	Comparative transcriptome profile analysis of rice varieties with different tolerance to zinc deficiency	2020	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	CAAS-IRRI Joint Laboratory for Genomics-Assisted Germplasm Enhancement, Agricultural Genomics Institute in Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, China.	Zinc (Zn) is an indispensable element for rice growth. Zn deficiency results in brown blotches and streaks 2-3 weeks after transplanting, as well as stunting, reduced tillering, and low productivity of rice plants. These processes are controlled by different families of expressed genes. A comparative transcriptome profile analysis was conducted using the roots of two Zn deficiency tolerant varieties (UCP122 and KALIBORO26) and two sensitive varieties (IR26 and IR64) by merging data from untreated control (CK) and Zn deficiency treated samples. Results revealed a total of 4,688 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the normal Zn and deficient conditions, with 2,702 and 1,489 unique DEGs upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis identified transcription factors (TFs), such as WRKY, MYB, ERF, and bHLH which are important in the regulation of the Zn deficiency response. Furthermore, chitinases, jasmonic acid, and phenylpropanoid pathways were found to be important in the Zn deficiency response. The metal tolerance protein (MTP) genes also appeared to play an important role in conferring tolerance to Zn deficiency. A heavy metal-associated domain-containing protein 7 was associated with tolerance to Zn deficiency and negatively regulated downstream genes. Collectively, our findings provide valuable expression patterns and candidate genes for the study of molecular mechanisms underlying the response to Zn deficiency and for improvements in breeding for tolerance to Zn deficiency in rice.

NA	A vacuolar transporter plays important roles in zinc and cadmium accumulation in rice grain.	2023	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Key Laboratory of Biology and Germplasm Innovation of Perennial Rice, Key Laboratory of Crop Quality Improvement of Yunnan Higher Education Institutes, School of Agriculture, Yunnan University, Kunming, 650500, China.	Rice grain is a poor dietary source of zinc (Zn) but the primary source of cadmium (Cd) for humans; however, the molecular mechanisms for their accumulation in rice grain remain incompletely understood. This study functionally characterized a tonoplast-localized transporter, OsMTP1. OsMTP1 was preferentially expressed in the roots, aleurone layer, and embryo of seeds. OsMTP1 knockout decreased Zn concentration in the root cell sap, roots, aleurone layer and embryo, and subsequently increased Zn concentration in shoots and polished rice (endosperm) without yield penalty. OsMTP1 haplotype analysis revealed elite alleles associated with increased Zn level in polished rice, mostly because of the decreased OsMTP1 transcripts. OsMTP1 expression in yeast enhanced Zn tolerance but did not affect that of Cd. While OsMTP1 knockout resulted in decreased uptake, translocation and accumulation of Cd in plant and rice grain, which could be attributed to the indirect effects of altered Zn accumulation. Our results suggest that rice OsMTP1 primarily functions as a tonoplast-localized transporter for sequestrating Zn into vacuole. OsMTP1 knockout elevated Zn concentration but prevented Cd deposition in polished rice without yield penalty. Thus, OsMTP1 is a candidate gene for enhancing Zn level and reducing Cd level in rice grains.
