Monosaccharides transporters play important roles in assimilate supply for sink tissue development. In this study, a new monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST6 was identified from rice (Oryza sativa L.). The predicted OsMST6 protein shows typical features of sugar transporters and shares 79.6% identity with the rice monosaccharide transporter OsMST3. Heterologous expression in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) demonstrated that OsMST6 is a broad-spectrum monosaccharide transporter, with a K (m) of 266.1 muMu for glucose. OsMST6-green fluorescent protein fusion protein is localized to the plasma membrane in plant. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis exhibited that OsMST6 is expressed in all tested organs/tissues. In developing seeds, OsMST6 expression level is high at the early and middle grain filling stages and gradually declines later. Further analysis detected its expression in both maternal and filial tissues. RNA in situ hybridization analysis indicated that OsMST6 is predominantly expressed in the vascular parenchyma of the chalazal vein, cross-cells, nucellar tissue and endosperm of young seeds, in mesophyll cells of source leaf blades, and in pollens and the connective vein of anthers. In addition, OsMST6 expression is up-regulated by salt stress and sugars. The physiological role of OsMST6 for seed development and its roles in other sink and source tissues are discussed.

This study deals with the cloning and characterization of monosaccharide transporter cDNAs in rice. OsMST1-3 (Oryza sativa monosaccharide transporters 1-3) have two sets of putative six transmembrane domains separated by a central long hydrophilic region. Heterologous expression of OsMST3 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated that OsMST3 has transport activity for some monosaccharides in an energy-dependent H+ co-transport manner. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses showed that OsMST3 mRNA is detectable in leaf blades, leaf sheaths, calli and roots, especially the xylem as well as in sclerenchyma cells in the root. These results suggested that OsMST3 is involved in the accumulation of monosaccharides required for cell wall synthesis at the stage of cell thickening.
