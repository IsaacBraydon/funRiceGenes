OsMST3	root	Characterization and expression of monosaccharide transporters (osMSTs) in rice	Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses showed that OsMST3 mRNA is detectable in leaf blades, leaf sheaths, calli and roots, especially the xylem as well as in sclerenchyma cells in the root
OsMST3	xylem	Characterization and expression of monosaccharide transporters (osMSTs) in rice	Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses showed that OsMST3 mRNA is detectable in leaf blades, leaf sheaths, calli and roots, especially the xylem as well as in sclerenchyma cells in the root
OsMST3	leaf	Characterization and expression of monosaccharide transporters (osMSTs) in rice	Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses showed that OsMST3 mRNA is detectable in leaf blades, leaf sheaths, calli and roots, especially the xylem as well as in sclerenchyma cells in the root
OsMST3	transporter	Molecular cloning, functional characterization and expression analysis of a novel monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST6 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	6% identity with the rice monosaccharide transporter OsMST3
OsMST3	cell wall	Characterization and expression of monosaccharide transporters (osMSTs) in rice	These results suggested that OsMST3 is involved in the accumulation of monosaccharides required for cell wall synthesis at the stage of cell thickening
OsMST3	sheath	Characterization and expression of monosaccharide transporters (osMSTs) in rice	Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses showed that OsMST3 mRNA is detectable in leaf blades, leaf sheaths, calli and roots, especially the xylem as well as in sclerenchyma cells in the root
