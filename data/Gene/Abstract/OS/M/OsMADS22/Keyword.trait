OsMADS22	leaf	Functional conservation and diversification between rice OsMADS22/OsMADS55 and Arabidopsis SVP proteins	Overexpression of OsMADS22 and OsMADS55 led to abnormal floral morphologies including leaf-like sepals, whereas only OsMADS55 expression caused delayed flowering via downregulation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1)
OsMADS22	spikelet meristem	OsMADS22, an STMADS11-like MADS-box gene of rice, is expressed in non-vegetative tissues and its ectopic expression induces spikelet meristem indeterminacy	OsMADS22, an STMADS11-like MADS-box gene of rice, is expressed in non-vegetative tissues and its ectopic expression induces spikelet meristem indeterminacy
OsMADS22	flowering time	Functional conservation and diversification between rice OsMADS22/OsMADS55 and Arabidopsis SVP proteins	Overexpression of OsMADS55, but not OsMADS22, complemented the early flowering phenotype and ambient temperature-insensitive flowering phenotype seen in svp mutants, suggesting that OsMADS55 regulates flowering time associated with ambient temperature responses in Arabidopsis
