NA	The expression of a rice secondary wall-specific cellulose synthase gene, OsCesA7, is directly regulated by a rice transcription factor, OsMYB58/63.	2015	Planta	Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere, Kyoto University, Uji, Kyoto, 611-0011, Japan.	A rice MYB transcription factor, OsMYB58/63, was found to directly upregulate the expression of a rice secondary wall-specific cellulose synthase gene, cellulose synthase A7 ( OsCesA7 ); in contrast, the Arabidopsis putative orthologs AtMYB58 and AtMYB63 have been shown to specifically activate lignin biosynthesis. Although indirect evidence has shown that grass plants are similar to but partially different from dicotyledonous ones in transcriptional regulation of lignocellulose biosynthesis, little is known about the differences. This study showed that a rice MYB transcription factor, OsMYB58/63, directly upregulated the expression of a rice secondary wall-specific cellulose synthase gene, cellulose synthase A7 (OsCesA7). Gene co-expression analysis showed that, in rice, OsMYB58/63 and several rice MYB genes were co-expressed with genes encoding lignocellulose biosynthetic enzymes. The expression levels of OsMYB55/61, OsMYB55/61-L, OsMYB58/63, and OsMYB42/85 were commonly found to be high in culm internodes and nodes. All four MYB transcription factors functioned as transcriptional activators in yeast cells. OsMYB58/63 most strongly transactivated the expression of OsCesA7 in rice protoplasts. Moreover, recombinant OsMYB58/63 protein was bound to two distinct cis-regulatory elements, AC-II and SMRE3, in the OsCesA7 promoter. This is in sharp contrast to the role of Arabidopsis orthologs, AtMYB58 and AtMYB63, which had been reported to specifically activate lignin biosynthesis. The promoter analysis revealed that AC elements, which are the binding sites for MYB58 and MYB63, were lacking in cellulose and xylan biosynthetic genes in Arabidopsis, but present in cellulose, xylan, and lignin biosynthetic genes in rice, implying that the difference of transcriptional regulation between rice and Arabidopsis is due to the distinct composition of promoters. Our results provide a new insight into transcriptional regulation in grass lignocellulose biosynthesis.
NA	RRS1 shapes robust root system to enhance drought resistance in rice.	2023	New Phytol	Beijing Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.	A strong root system facilitates the absorption of water and nutrients from the soil, to improve the growth of crops. However, to date, there are still very few root development regulatory genes that can be used in crop breeding for agriculture. In this study, we cloned a negative regulator gene of root development, Robust Root System 1 (RRS1), which encodes an R2R3-type MYB family transcription factor. RRS1 knockout plants showed enhanced root growth, including longer root length, longer lateral root length, and larger lateral root density. RRS1 represses root development by directly activating the expression of OsIAA3 which is involved in the auxin signaling pathway. A natural variation in the coding region of RRS1 changes the transcriptional activity of its protein. RRS1(T) allele, originating from wild rice, possibly increases root length by means of weakening regulation of OsIAA3. Knockout of RRS1 enhances drought resistance by promoting water absorption and improving water use efficiency. This study provides a new gene resource for improving root systems and cultivating drought-resistant rice varieties with important values in agricultural applications.
