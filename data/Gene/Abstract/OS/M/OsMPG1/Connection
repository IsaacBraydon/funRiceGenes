OsMPG1|OsVTC1-1	OsVTC1-8	Rice GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase OsVTC1-1 and OsVTC1-3 play different roles in ascorbic acid synthesis.	The rice genome encodes three GMPase homologs OsVTC1-1, OsVTC1-3 and OsVTC1-8, but their roles in AsA synthesis are unclear
OsMPG1|OsVTC1-1	OsVTC1-8	Rice GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase OsVTC1-1 and OsVTC1-3 play different roles in ascorbic acid synthesis.	The overexpression of OsVTC1-1 or OsVTC1-3 restored the AsA synthesis of vtc1-1 in Arabidopsis, while that of OsVTC1-8 did not, indicating that only OsVTC1-1 and OsVTC1-3 are involved in AsA synthesis in rice
OsMPG1|OsVTC1-1	OsVTC1-8	Rice GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase OsVTC1-1 and OsVTC1-3 play different roles in ascorbic acid synthesis.	Unlike OsVTC1-1, the expression level of OsVTC1-3 was high in roots and quickly induced by the dark, while the transcription level of OsVTC1-8 did not show obvious changes under constant light or dark treatments
OsMPG1|OsVTC1-1	OsVTC1-8	Rice GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase OsVTC1-1 and OsVTC1-3 play different roles in ascorbic acid synthesis.	The enzyme activity showed that OsVTC1-1 and OsVTC1-3 had higher GMPase activities than OsVTC1-8 in vitro
OsMPG1|OsVTC1-1	OsVTC1-3|OsMPG3	OsEIL1 protects rice growth under NH(4) (+) nutrition by regulating OsVTC1-3-dependent N-glycosylation and root NH(4) (+) efflux.	 OsEIL1 constrains NH(4) (+) efflux by activation of OsVTC1-3, but not OsVTC1-1 or OsVTC1-8
