Salinity, one of the most deleterious stresses, affects growth and overall yield of crop plants. To identify new "candidate genes" having potential role in salinity tolerance, we have carried out 'functional screening' of a cDNA library (made from a salt tolerant rice-Pokkali). Based on this screening, we identified a cDNA clone that was allowing yeast cells to grow in the presence of 1.2 M NaCl. Sequencing and BLAST search identified it as mannose-1-phosphate guanyl transferase (OsMPG1) gene from rice. Analysis of rice genome sequence database indicated the presence of 3 additional genes for MPG. Out of four, three MPG genes viz. OsMPG1, 3 and 4 were able to functionally complement yeast MPG mutant -YDL055C. We have carried out detailed transcript profiling of all members of MPG family by qRT-PCR using two contrasting rice genotypes (IR64 and Pokkali) under different abiotic stresses (salinity, drought, oxidative stress, heat stress, cold or UV light). These MPG genes showed differential expression under various abiotic stresses with two genes (OsMPG1 and 3) showing high induction in response to multiple stresses. Analysis of rice microarray data indicated higher expression levels for OsMPG1 in specific tissues such as roots, leaves, shoot apical meristem and different stages of panicle and seed development, thereby indicating its developmental regulation. Functional validation of OsMPG1 carried out by overexpression in the transgenic tobacco revealed its involvement in enhancing salinity stress tolerance.
NA	Rice GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase OsVTC1-1 and OsVTC1-3 play different roles in ascorbic acid synthesis.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, China.	GDP-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GMPase) catalyzes the synthesis of GDP-D-mannose, which is a precursor for ascorbic acid (AsA) synthesis in plants. The rice genome encodes three GMPase homologs OsVTC1-1, OsVTC1-3 and OsVTC1-8, but their roles in AsA synthesis are unclear. The overexpression of OsVTC1-1 or OsVTC1-3 restored the AsA synthesis of vtc1-1 in Arabidopsis, while that of OsVTC1-8 did not, indicating that only OsVTC1-1 and OsVTC1-3 are involved in AsA synthesis in rice. Similar to Arabidopsis VTC1, the expression of OsVTC1-1 was high in leaves, induced by light, and inhibited by dark. Unlike OsVTC1-1, the expression level of OsVTC1-3 was high in roots and quickly induced by the dark, while the transcription level of OsVTC1-8 did not show obvious changes under constant light or dark treatments. In OsVTC1-1 RNAi plants, the AsA content of rice leaves decreased, and the AsA production induced by light was limited. In contrast, OsVTC1-3 RNAi lines altered AsA synthesis levels in rice roots, but not in the leaves or under the light/dark treatment. The enzyme activity showed that OsVTC1-1 and OsVTC1-3 had higher GMPase activities than OsVTC1-8 in vitro. Our data showed that, unlike in Arabidopsis, the rice GPMase homologous proteins illustrated a new model in AsA synthesis: OsVTC1-1 may be involved in the AsA synthesis, which takes place in leaves, while OsVTC1-3 may be responsible for AsA synthesis in roots. The different roles of rice GMPase homologous proteins in AsA synthesis may be due to their differences in transcript levels and enzyme activities.
NA	Knocking Down the Expression of GMPase Gene OsVTC1-1 Decreases Salt Tolerance of  Rice at Seedling and Reproductive Stages	2016	PLoS One	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China	Salinity is a severe environmental stress that greatly impairs production of crops worldwide. Previous studies have shown that GMPase plays an important role  in tolerance of plants to salt stress at vegetative stage. However, the function  of GMPase in plant responses to salt stress at reproductive stage remains unclear. Studies have shown that heterologous expression of rice GMPase OsVTC1-1  enhanced salt tolerance of tobacco seedlings, but the native role of OsVTC1-1 in  salt stress tolerance of rice is unknown. To illustrate the native function of GMPase in response of rice to salt stress, OsVTC1-1 expression was suppressed using RNAi-mediated gene silencing. Suppressing OsVTC1-1 expression obviously decreased salt tolerance of rice varieties at vegetative stage. Intriguingly, grain yield of OsVTC1-1 RNAi rice was also significantly reduced under salt stress, indicating that OsVTC1-1 plays an important role in salt tolerance of rice at both seedling and reproductive stages. OsVTC1-1 RNAi rice accumulated more ROS under salt stress, and supplying exogenous ascorbic acid restored salt tolerance of OsVTC1-1 RNAi lines, suggesting that OsVTC1-1 is involved in salt tolerance of rice through the biosynthesis regulation of ascorbic acid. Altogether, results of present study showed that rice GMPase gene OsVTC1-1 plays  a critical role in salt tolerance of rice at both vegetative and reproductive stages through AsA scavenging of excess ROS.
NA	OsVTC1-1 Gene Silencing Promotes a Defense Response in Rice and Enhances Resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae.	2022	Plants (Basel)	Department of Genetics, Faculty of Science, Kasetsart University, Chatuchak, Bangkok 10900, Thailand.	Rice blast disease is a serious disease in rice caused by Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae). Ascorbic acid (AsA), or vitamin C, is a strong antioxidant that prevents oxidative damage to cellular components and plays an essential role in plant defense response. GDP-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GMP or VTC1) is an enzyme that generates GDP-D-mannose for AsA, cell wall, and glycoprotein synthesis. The OsVTC1 gene has three homologs in the rice genome: OsVTC1-1, OsVTC1-3, and OsVTC1-8. Using OsVTC1-1 RNAi lines, this study investigated the role of the OsVTC1-1 gene during rice blast fungus inoculation. The OsVTC1-1 RNAi inoculated with rice blast fungus induced changes to cell wall monosaccharides, photosynthetic efficiency, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Additionally, the OsVTC1-1 RNAi lines were shown to be more resistant to rice blast fungus than the wild type. Genes and proteins related to defense response, plant hormone synthesis, and signaling pathways, especially salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, were up-regulated in the OsVTC1-1 RNAi lines after rice blast inoculation. These results suggest that the OsVTC1-1 gene regulates rice blast resistance through several defense mechanisms, including hormone synthesis and signaling pathways.
