OsBZR1	OsMED25	Oryza sativa mediator subunit OsMED25 interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate Brassinosteroid signaling and plant architecture in rice.	Oryza sativa mediator subunit OsMED25 interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate Brassinosteroid signaling and plant architecture in rice.
OsBZR1	OsMED25	Oryza sativa mediator subunit OsMED25 interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate Brassinosteroid signaling and plant architecture in rice.	 Further biochemical analysis showed that OsMED25 interacts with OsBZR1 in vivo, and OsMED25 is enriched on the promoter of OsBZR1 target genes
OsBZR1	OsMED25	Oryza sativa mediator subunit OsMED25 interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate Brassinosteroid signaling and plant architecture in rice.	 RNA sequencing analysis indicated that OsMED25 affects the expression of approximately 45% of OsBZR1-regulated genes and mainly functions as a co-repressor of OsBZR1
OsBZR1	OsMED25	Oryza sativa mediator subunit OsMED25 interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate Brassinosteroid signaling and plant architecture in rice.	 Together, these findings revealed that OsMED25 regulates rice BR signaling by interacting with OsBZR1 and modulating the expression of OsBZR1 target genes, thus expanding our understanding of the roles of mediators in plant hormone signaling
