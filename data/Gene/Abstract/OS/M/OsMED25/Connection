OsBZR1|BZR1	OsMED25	Oryza sativa mediator subunit OsMED25 interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate Brassinosteroid signaling and plant architecture in rice.	 Further biochemical analysis showed that OsMED25 interacts with OsBZR1 in vivo, and OsMED25 is enriched on the promoter of OsBZR1 target genes
OsBZR1|BZR1	OsMED25	Oryza sativa mediator subunit OsMED25 interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate Brassinosteroid signaling and plant architecture in rice.	 RNA sequencing analysis indicated that OsMED25 affects the expression of approximately 45% of OsBZR1-regulated genes and mainly functions as a co-repressor of OsBZR1
OsBZR1|BZR1	OsMED25	Oryza sativa mediator subunit OsMED25 interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate Brassinosteroid signaling and plant architecture in rice.	 Together, these findings revealed that OsMED25 regulates rice BR signaling by interacting with OsBZR1 and modulating the expression of OsBZR1 target genes, thus expanding our understanding of the roles of mediators in plant hormone signaling

OsMED25	OsMYC2	Rice MEDIATOR25, OsMED25, is an essential subunit for jasmonate-mediated root development and OsMYC2-mediated leaf senescence	 Mutated osmed25 protein could not interact with OsMYC2, which is a positive TF in JA signaling in rice
OsMED25	OsMYC2	Rice MEDIATOR25, OsMED25, is an essential subunit for jasmonate-mediated root development and OsMYC2-mediated leaf senescence 	 Mutated osmed25 protein could not interact with OsMYC2, which is a positive TF in JA signaling in rice
DST|WL1|HST1	OsMED25	Mediator complex subunit MED25 physically interacts with DST to regulate spikelet number in rice.	 Here, we demonstrate that DST-interacting protein 1 (DIP1), known as Mediator subunit OsMED25, acts as an interacting coactivator of DST
DST|WL1|HST1	OsMED25	Mediator complex subunit MED25 physically interacts with DST to regulate spikelet number in rice.	 Phenotypic analyses revealed that OsMED25-RNAi and the osmed25 mutant plants exhibited enlarged panicles, with enhanced branching and spikelet number, similar to the dst mutant
DST|WL1|HST1	OsMED25	Mediator complex subunit MED25 physically interacts with DST to regulate spikelet number in rice.	 Further biochemical analysis showed that OsMED25 physically interacts with DST at the promoter region of OsCKX2, and then recruits RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to activate OsCKX2 transcription
DST|WL1|HST1	OsMED25	Mediator complex subunit MED25 physically interacts with DST to regulate spikelet number in rice.	 Thus, OsMED25 was involved in the communication between DST and Pol II general transcriptional machinery to regulate spikelet number
Gn1a|OsCKX2	OsMED25	Mediator complex subunit MED25 physically interacts with DST to regulate spikelet number in rice.	 Further biochemical analysis showed that OsMED25 physically interacts with DST at the promoter region of OsCKX2, and then recruits RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to activate OsCKX2 transcription
OsMED25	OsMYC2	The Mutation of Rice MEDIATOR25, OsMED25, Induces Rice Bacterial Blight and Auxin-Signaling.	 The expression of JA-responsive defense-related genes regulated by OsMYC2, which is a positive TF in JA signaling, was downregulated in osmed25 mutants
