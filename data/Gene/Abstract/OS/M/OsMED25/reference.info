NA	Oryza sativa mediator subunit OsMED25 interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate Brassinosteroid signaling and plant architecture in rice.	2020	J Integr Plant Biol	Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Key Laboratory of Soybean Molecular Design Breeding, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Harbin, 150081, China.	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant-specific steroid hormones that regulate plant growth, development, and adaptation. Transcriptional regulation plays key roles in plant hormone signaling. A mediator can serve as a bridge between gene-specific transcription factors and the RNA polymerase machinery, functioning as an essential component in regulating the transcriptional process. However, whether a mediator is involved in BR signaling is unknown. Here, we discovered that Oryza sativa mediator subunit 25 (OsMED25) is an important regulator of rice BR signaling. Phenotypic analyses showed that the OsMED25-RNAi and osmed25 mutant presented erect leaves, as observed in BR-deficient mutants. In addition, the OsMED25-RNAi and osmed25 mutant exhibited decreased BR sensitivity. Genetic analysis indicated that OsMED25-RNAi could suppress the enhanced BR signaling phenotype of Osbzr1-D. Further biochemical analysis showed that OsMED25 interacts with OsBZR1 in vivo, and OsMED25 is enriched on the promoter of OsBZR1 target genes. RNA sequencing analysis indicated that OsMED25 affects the expression of approximately 45% of OsBZR1-regulated genes and mainly functions as a co-repressor of OsBZR1. Together, these findings revealed that OsMED25 regulates rice BR signaling by interacting with OsBZR1 and modulating the expression of OsBZR1 target genes, thus expanding our understanding of the roles of mediators in plant hormone signaling.

NA	Functional Analysis of OsMED16 and OsMED25 in Response to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses in Rice 	2021	Front Plant Sci	College of Life Science, Taizhou University, Taizhou, China.	Mediator complex is a multiprotein complex that regulates RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Moreover, it functions in several signaling pathways, including those involved in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. We used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to study the functions of two genes, namely OsMED16 and OsMED25 in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in rice. Both genes were differentially induced by Magnaporthe grisea (M. grisea), the causative agent of blast disease, hormone treatment, and abiotic stress. We found that both BMV: OsMED16- and BMV: OsMED25-infiltrated seedlings reduced the resistance to M. grisea by regulating the accumulation of H2O2 and expression of defense-related genes. Furthermore, BMV: OsMED16-infiltrated seedlings decreased the tolerance to cold by increasing the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and reducing the expression of cold-responsive genes. 
NA	Rice MEDIATOR25, OsMED25, is an essential subunit for jasmonate-mediated root development and OsMYC2-mediated leaf senescence	2021	Plant Sci	Plant Genome and Resource Research Center, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagawa University, Miki, Kagawa, 761-0795, Japan.	The Mediator multiprotein complex acts as a universal adaptor between transcription factors (TFs) and RNA polymerase II. MEDIATOR25 (MED25) has an important role in jasmonic acid (JA) signaling in Arabidopsis. However, no research has been conducted on the role of MED25 in JA signaling in rice, which is one of the most important food crops globally and is a model plant for molecular studies in other monocotyledonous species. In the present study, we isolated the loss-of function mutant of MED25, osmed25, through the map-based cloning and phenotypic complementation analysis by the introduction of OsMED25 and investigated the role of OsMED25 in JA signaling in rice. The osmed25 mutants had longer primary (seminal) roots than those of the wild-type (WT) and exhibited JA-insensitive phenotypes. S-type lateral root densities in osmed25 mutants were lower than those in the WT, whereas L-type lateral root densities in osmed25 mutants were higher than those in the WT. Furthermore, the osmed25 mutants retarded JA-regulated leaf senescence under dark-induced senescence. Mutated osmed25 protein could not interact with OsMYC2, which is a positive TF in JA signaling in rice. The expression of JA-responsive senescence-associated genes was not upregulated in response to JA in the osmed25 mutants. The results suggest that OsMED25 participates in JA-mediated root development and OsMYC2-mediated leaf senescence in rice. 
NA	Mediator complex subunit MED25 physically interacts with DST to regulate spikelet number in rice.	2022	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, National Centre for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, The Innovative Academy of Seed Design, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Grain number is a flexible trait and contributes significantly to grain yield. In rice, the zinc finger transcription factor DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE (DST) controls grain number by directly regulating cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase 2 (OsCKX2) expression. Although specific upstream regulators of the DST-OsCKX2 module have been identified, the mechanism employed by DST to regulate the expression of OsCKX2 remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that DST-interacting protein 1 (DIP1), known as Mediator subunit OsMED25, acts as an interacting coactivator of DST. Phenotypic analyses revealed that OsMED25-RNAi and the osmed25 mutant plants exhibited enlarged panicles, with enhanced branching and spikelet number, similar to the dst mutant. Genetic analysis indicated that OsMED25 acts in the same pathway as the DST-OsCKX2 module to regulate spikelet number per panicle. Further biochemical analysis showed that OsMED25 physically interacts with DST at the promoter region of OsCKX2, and then recruits RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to activate OsCKX2 transcription. Thus, OsMED25 was involved in the communication between DST and Pol II general transcriptional machinery to regulate spikelet number. In general, our findings reveal a novel function of OsMED25 in DST-OsCKX2 modulated transcriptional regulation, thus enhancing our understanding of the regulatory mechanism underlying DST-OsCKX2-mediated spikelet number.
NA	The Mutation of Rice MEDIATOR25, OsMED25, Induces Rice Bacterial Blight and Auxin-Signaling.	2022	Plants (Basel)	Faculty of Agriculture, Kagawa University, Miki 761-0795, Japan.	Rice bacterial blight disease caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is one of the most severe diseases of rice. However, the regulatory mechanisms of rice defense against Xoo remain poorly understood. The rice MEDIATOR25, OsMED25-a subunit of the mediator multiprotein complex that acts as a universal adaptor between transcription factors (TFs) and RNA polymerase II-plays an important role in jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated lateral root development in rice. In this study, and auxin-mediated resistance responses against rice bacterial blight. The osmed25 loss-of-function mutant exhibited high resistance to Xoo. The expression of JA-responsive defense-related genes regulated by OsMYC2, which is a positive TF in JA signaling, was downregulated in osmed25 mutants. Conversely, expression of some OsMYC2-independent JA-responsive defense-related genes was upregulated in osmed25 mutants. Furthermore, OsMED25 interacted with some AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORS (OsARFs) that regulate auxin signaling, whereas the mutated osmed25 protein did not interact with the OsARFs. The expression of auxin-responsive genes was downregulated in osmed25 mutants, and auxin-induced susceptibility to Xoo was not observed in osmed25 mutants. These results indicate that OsMED25 plays an and auxin-mediated signaling in rice defense response.
