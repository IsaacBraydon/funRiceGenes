OsMED25	 RNA sequencing analysis indicated that OsMED25 affects the expression of approximately 45% of OsBZR1-regulated genes and mainly functions as a co-repressor of OsBZR1 |  Together, these findings revealed that OsMED25 regulates rice BR signaling by interacting with OsBZR1 and modulating the expression of OsBZR1 target genes, thus expanding our understanding of the roles of mediators in plant hormone signaling	 Phenotypic analyses showed that the OsMED25-RNAi and osmed25 mutant presented erect leaves, as observed in BR-deficient mutants |  In addition, the OsMED25-RNAi and osmed25 mutant exhibited decreased BR sensitivity |  Genetic analysis indicated that OsMED25-RNAi could suppress the enhanced BR signaling phenotype of Osbzr1-D
