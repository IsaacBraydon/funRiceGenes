OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	OsMADS7|OsMADS45	Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)	 Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs
OsMADS7|OsMADS45	OsMADS8|OsMADS24	Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)	 Plants affected in both OsMADS7 and OsMADS8 show severe phenotypes including late flowering, homeotic changes of lodicules, stamens and carpels into palea/lemma-like organs, and a loss of floral determinacy| Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs

FZP|BFL1	OsMADS7|OsMADS45	Regulatory role of FZP in the determination of panicle branching and spikelet formation in rice.	 FZP overexpression positively regulates the expression of a subset of the class B genes, AGL6 genes (OsMADS6 and OsMADS17) as well as class E genes (OsMADS1, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8) in floral meristem (FM)
