Symbol	Keyword	Title	Evidence
OsMIZ1	disease	Cloning and characterization of a gene encoding MIZ1, a domain of unknown function protein and its role in salt and drought stress in rice.	 Furthermore, expression studies using publically available resources showed that enhanced expression of OsMIZ1 is regulated in response to disease infections, mineral deficiency, and heavy metal stresses and is also expressed in reproductive tissues in addition to roots
OsMIZ1	drought	Cloning and characterization of a gene encoding MIZ1, a domain of unknown function protein and its role in salt and drought stress in rice.	 These results highlight the possible involvement of OsMIZ1 in drought and salt stress tolerance in rice
OsMIZ1	salt	Cloning and characterization of a gene encoding MIZ1, a domain of unknown function protein and its role in salt and drought stress in rice.	 These results highlight the possible involvement of OsMIZ1 in drought and salt stress tolerance in rice
OsMIZ1	tolerance	Cloning and characterization of a gene encoding MIZ1, a domain of unknown function protein and its role in salt and drought stress in rice.	 These results highlight the possible involvement of OsMIZ1 in drought and salt stress tolerance in rice
OsMIZ1	salt stress	Cloning and characterization of a gene encoding MIZ1, a domain of unknown function protein and its role in salt and drought stress in rice.	 These results highlight the possible involvement of OsMIZ1 in drought and salt stress tolerance in rice
OsMIZ1	stress	Cloning and characterization of a gene encoding MIZ1, a domain of unknown function protein and its role in salt and drought stress in rice.	 These results highlight the possible involvement of OsMIZ1 in drought and salt stress tolerance in rice
OsMIZ1	reproductive	Cloning and characterization of a gene encoding MIZ1, a domain of unknown function protein and its role in salt and drought stress in rice.	 Furthermore, expression studies using publically available resources showed that enhanced expression of OsMIZ1 is regulated in response to disease infections, mineral deficiency, and heavy metal stresses and is also expressed in reproductive tissues in addition to roots
OsMIZ1	stress tolerance	Cloning and characterization of a gene encoding MIZ1, a domain of unknown function protein and its role in salt and drought stress in rice.	 These results highlight the possible involvement of OsMIZ1 in drought and salt stress tolerance in rice
