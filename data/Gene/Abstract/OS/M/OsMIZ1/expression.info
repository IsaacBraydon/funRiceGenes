OsMIZ1	 Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsMIZ1 expression levels were upregulated significantly in tolerant cv |  However, in the roots of susceptible genotypes, OsMIZ1 expression decreased under both the stresses |  Furthermore, expression studies using publically available resources showed that enhanced expression of OsMIZ1 is regulated in response to disease infections, mineral deficiency, and heavy metal stresses and is also expressed in reproductive tissues in addition to roots
