OsMTP11	tolerance	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.
OsMTP11	stress	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.	 Real time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated OsMTP11 expression was substantially enhanced following 4 h under Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn treatments, suggesting possible roles of OsMTP11 involvement in heavy metal stress responses
OsMTP11	stress	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.	 DNA methylation assays of genomic DNA in rice treated with Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn revealed that decreased DNA methylation levels were present in the OsMTP11 promoter region, which was consistent with OsMTP11 induced-expression patterns resulting from heavy metal stress
OsMTP11	Al tolerance	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.
OsMTP11	manganese	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.
OsMTP11	stress response	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.	 Real time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated OsMTP11 expression was substantially enhanced following 4 h under Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn treatments, suggesting possible roles of OsMTP11 involvement in heavy metal stress responses
OsMTP11	transporter	OsMTP11 is localised at the Golgi and contributes to Mn tolerance.	 This indicates their importance for OsMTP11 function and is a starting point for refining transporter activity/specificity
