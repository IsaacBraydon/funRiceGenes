OsMTP11	tolerance	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.
OsMTP11	stress	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.	 Real time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated OsMTP11 expression was substantially enhanced following 4 h under Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn treatments, suggesting possible roles of OsMTP11 involvement in heavy metal stress responses
OsMTP11	stress	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.	 DNA methylation assays of genomic DNA in rice treated with Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn revealed that decreased DNA methylation levels were present in the OsMTP11 promoter region, which was consistent with OsMTP11 induced-expression patterns resulting from heavy metal stress
OsMTP11	Al tolerance	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.
OsMTP11	manganese	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.
OsMTP11	stress response	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.	 Real time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated OsMTP11 expression was substantially enhanced following 4 h under Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn treatments, suggesting possible roles of OsMTP11 involvement in heavy metal stress responses
OsMTP11	transporter	OsMTP11 is localised at the Golgi and contributes to Mn tolerance.	 This indicates their importance for OsMTP11 function and is a starting point for refining transporter activity/specificity
OsMTP11	growth	OsMTP11, a trans-Golgi network localized transporter, is involved in manganese tolerance in rice.	 Knockdown of OsMTP11 resulted in growth inhibition in the presence of high concentrations of Mn, and also led to increased accumulation of Mn in the shoots and roots
OsMTP11	tolerance	OsMTP11, a trans-Golgi network localized transporter, is involved in manganese tolerance in rice.	 The expression of OsMTP11 was found to enhance Mn tolerance in the Mn-sensitive yeast mutant pmr1
OsMTP11	tolerance	OsMTP11, a trans-Golgi network localized transporter, is involved in manganese tolerance in rice.	 The overexpression of OsMTP11 was found to enhance Mn tolerance in rice, and under supplementation with a toxic level of Mn, decreased Mn concentration was observed in the shoots and roots
OsMTP11	tolerance	OsMTP11, a trans-Golgi network localized transporter, is involved in manganese tolerance in rice.	 These findings suggest that OsMTP11 is a TGN-localized Mn transporter that is required for Mn homeostasis and contributes towards Mn tolerance in rice
OsMTP11	homeostasis	OsMTP11, a trans-Golgi network localized transporter, is involved in manganese tolerance in rice.	 These findings suggest that OsMTP11 is a TGN-localized Mn transporter that is required for Mn homeostasis and contributes towards Mn tolerance in rice
OsMTP11	transporter	OsMTP11, a trans-Golgi network localized transporter, is involved in manganese tolerance in rice.	 Here we report on the rice gene OsMTP11 that encodes a putative CDF transporter that is homologous to members of the Mn-CDF cluster
OsMTP11	transporter	OsMTP11, a trans-Golgi network localized transporter, is involved in manganese tolerance in rice.	 These findings suggest that OsMTP11 is a TGN-localized Mn transporter that is required for Mn homeostasis and contributes towards Mn tolerance in rice
OsMTP11	plasma membrane	OsMTP11, a trans-Golgi network localized transporter, is involved in manganese tolerance in rice.	 Subcellular localization in rice protoplasts and tobacco epidermal cells revealed that OsMTP11 localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and a significant relocalization to the plasma membrane can be triggered by high extracellular Mn in tobacco epidermal cells
