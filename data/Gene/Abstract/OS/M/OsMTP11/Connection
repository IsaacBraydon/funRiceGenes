OsMTP11	ZN	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.	 Real time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated OsMTP11 expression was substantially enhanced following 4 h under Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn treatments, suggesting possible roles of OsMTP11 involvement in heavy metal stress responses
OsMTP11	ZN	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.	 DNA methylation assays of genomic DNA in rice treated with Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn revealed that decreased DNA methylation levels were present in the OsMTP11 promoter region, which was consistent with OsMTP11 induced-expression patterns resulting from heavy metal stress
