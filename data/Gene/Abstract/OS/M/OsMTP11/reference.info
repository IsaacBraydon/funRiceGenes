NA	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.	2017	PLoS One	Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Botany, South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China.	Metal tolerance proteins (MTPs) are a gene family of cation efflux transporters that occur widely in plants and might serve an essential role in metal homeostasis and tolerance. Our research describes the identification, characterization, and localization of OsMTP11, a member of the MTP family from rice. OsMTP11 was expressed constitutively and universally in different tissues in rice plant. Heterologous expression in yeast showed that OsMTP11 complemented the hypersensitivity of mutant strains to Mn, and also complemented yeast mutants to other metals, including Co and Ni. Real time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated OsMTP11 expression was substantially enhanced following 4 h under Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn treatments, suggesting possible roles of OsMTP11 involvement in heavy metal stress responses. Promoter analysis by transgenic assays with GUS as a reporter gene and mRNA in situ hybridization experiments showed that OsMTP11 was expressed specifically in conducting tissues in rice. DNA methylation assays of genomic DNA in rice treated with Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn revealed that decreased DNA methylation levels were present in the OsMTP11 promoter region, which was consistent with OsMTP11 induced-expression patterns resulting from heavy metal stress. This result suggested that DNA methylation is one of major factors regulating expression of OsMTP11 through epigenetic mechanisms. OsMTP11 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) localized to the entire onion epidermal cell cytoplasm, while vacuolar membrane exhibited increased GFP signals, consistent with an OsMTP11 function in cation sequestration. Our results indicated that OsMTP11 might play vital roles in Mn and other heavy metal transportation in rice.
NA	OsMTP11 is localised at the Golgi and contributes to Mn tolerance.	2017	Sci Rep	Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Life Sciences Building 85, Highfield Campus, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, Hampshire, United Kingdom.	Membrane transporters play a key role in obtaining sufficient quantities of manganese (Mn) but also in protecting against Mn toxicity. We have characterized OsMTP11, a member of the Cation Diffusion Facilitator/Metal Tolerance Protein (CDF/MTP) family of metal cation transporters in Oryza sativa. We demonstrate that OsMTP11 functions in alleviating Mn toxicity as its expression can rescue the Mn-sensitive phenotype of the Arabidopsis mtp11-3 knockout mutant. When expressed stably in Arabidopsis and transiently in rice and tobacco, it localises to the Golgi. OsMTP11 partially rescues the Mn-hypersensitivity of the pmr1 yeast mutant but only slightly alleviates the Zn sensitivity of the zrc1 cot1 yeast mutant. Overall, these results suggest that OsMTP11 predominantly functions as a Mn-transporting CDF with lower affinity for Zn. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed four substitutions in OsMTP11 that<U+00A0>appear to alter its transport activity. OsMTP11 harbouring a substitution of leucine 150 to a serine fully rescued pmr1 Mn-sensitivity at all concentrations tested. The other substitutions, including those at conserved DxxxD domains, reduced complementation of pmr1 to different levels. This indicates their importance for OsMTP11 function and is a starting point for refining transporter activity/specificity.
NA	A member of cation diffusion facilitator family, MTP11, is required for manganese tolerance and high fertility in rice.	2018	Planta	Graduate School of Integrated Arts and Science, Kochi University, 200 Otsu, Monobe, Nankoku, Kochi, 783-8502, Japan.	Rice MTP11 is the trans-Golgi-localized transporter that is involved in Mn tolerance with MTP8.1, and it is required for normal fertility. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most manganese (Mn)-tolerant species, and it is able to accumulate high levels of this metal in the leaves without showing toxic symptoms. The metal tolerance protein 8.1 (MTP8.1), a member of the Mn-cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family, has been shown to play a central role in high Mn tolerance by sequestering Mn into vacuoles. Recently, rice MTP11 was identified as an Mn transporter that is localized to Golgi-associated compartments, but its exact role in Mn tolerance in planta has not yet been understood. Here, we investigated the role of MTP11 in rice Mn tolerance using knockout lines. Old leaves presented higher levels of constitutively expressed MTP11 than other tissues and MTP11 expression was also found in reproductive organs. Fused MTP11:green fluorescent protein was co-localized to trans-Golgi markers and differentiated from other Golgi-associated markers. Knockout of MTP11 in wild-type rice did not affect tolerance and accumulation of Mn and other heavy metals, but knockout in the mtp8.1 mutant showed exacerbated Mn sensitivity at the vegetative growth stage. Knockout of MTP11 alone resulted in decreased grain yield and fertility at the reproductive stage. Thus, MTP11 is a trans-Golgi localized transporter for Mn, which plays a role in Mn tolerance through intracellular Mn compartmentalization. It is also required for maintaining high fertility in rice.
