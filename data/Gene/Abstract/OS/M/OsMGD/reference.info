14605002.pdf	Cloning of a putative monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants and its expression in response to submergence and other stresses	2004	Planta	Laboratory of Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Agriculture, Tottori University, Koyama, 680-8553, Japan.	Suppression subtractive hybridization was used to construct a subtractive cDNA library from plants of non-submerged and 7-day-submerged rice (Oryza sativa L., FR13A, a submergence-tolerant cultivar). One clone of the subtractive cDNA library, S23, was expressed abundantly during submergence. The full length of S23 was amplified using 5'- and 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and found to consist of 1,671 bp with an open reading frame of 1,077 bp (181-1257) encoding 358 amino acids. Its deduced amino acid sequence showed a high homology with monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase (UDPgalactose: 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-beta-D-galactosyl transferase; EC 2.4.1.46, MGDG synthase) from Arabidopsis thaliana; therefore, we named the gene OsMGD. Time-course studies showed that the expression of OsMGD in the rice cultivars FR13A and IR42 (submergence-susceptive cultivar) during submergence was gradually increased and that expression in FR13A was higher than in IR42. The expression of OsMGD in FR13A was influenced by benzyladenine and illumination. The accumulation of OsMGD mRNA in both FR13A and IR42 was also increased by ethephon, gibberellin, drought and salt treatment, but cold stress had no effect on the expression of the gene. These results suggest that the expression of OsMGD mRNA requires benzyladenine or illumination, and that the process is also mediated by ethephon and gibberellin. Salt and drought stress have an effect similar to that of submergence. Furthermore, the enhanced expression of OsMGD may relate to photosynthesis, and play an important role during submergence.
NA	Characterization and Mutational Analysis of a Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Synthase Gene OsMGD2 in Rice.	2019	Front Plant Sci	National Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Institute of Crop Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) are the two predominant galactolipids present in the photosynthetic membrane in many photosynthetic organisms, including algae and higher plants. These galactolipids are the main constituents of thylakoid membrane and are essential for chloroplast biogenesis and photoautotrophic growth. In silico analysis revealed that rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome has three genes encoding MGDG synthase (OsMGD1, 2, and 3). Although subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that OsMGD2 is localized to chloroplast, its expression was observed mainly in anther and endosperm, suggesting that MGDG might have an important role in the development of flower and grain in rice. Knock-out mutants of OsMGD2 were generated employing the CRISPR/Cas9 system and their morphology, yield and grain quality related traits were studied. The leaf of osmgd2 mutants showed reduced MGDG (∼11.6%) and DGDG (∼9.5%) content with chlorophyll a content decreased by ∼23%, consequently affecting the photosynthesis. The mutants also exhibited poor agronomic performance with plant height and panicle length decreased by ∼12.2 and ∼7.3%, respectively. Similarly, the number of filled grains per panicle was reduced by 43.8%, while the 1000 grain weight was increased by ∼6.3% in the mutants. The milled rice of mutants also had altered pasting properties and decreased linoleic acid content (∼26.6%). Put together, the present study demonstrated that OsMGD2 is the predominantly expressed gene encoding MGDG synthase in anther and grain and plays important roles in plant growth and development, as well as in grain quality.
NA	Gene Expression Dynamics in Rice Peduncles at the Heading Stage	2020	Front Genet	Grass Genetics and Informatics Group, School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.	Improving grain yield in the staple food crop rice has been long sought goal of plant biotechnology. One of the traits with significant impact on rice breeding programs is peduncle elongation at the time of heading failing which leads to significant reduction in grain yield due to incomplete panicle exsertion. To decipher transcriptional dynamics and molecular players underlying peduncle elongation, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of elongating and non-elongating peduncles in two Indian cultivars, Swarna and Pokkali, at the time of heading. Along with genes associated with cell division and cell wall biosynthesis, we observed significant enrichment of genes associated with auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis/signaling in the elongating peduncles before heading in both the genotypes. Similarly, genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and mobilization, abiotic stress response along with cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene biosynthesis/signaling were enriched in non-elongating peduncles post heading. Significant enrichment of genes belonging to key transcription factor families highlights their specialized roles in peduncle elongation and grain filling before and after heading, respectively. A comparison with anther/pollen development-related genes provided 76 candidates with overlapping roles in anther/pollen development and peduncle elongation. Some of these are important for carbohydrate remobilization to the developing grains. These can be engineered to combat with incomplete panicle exsertion in male sterile lines and manipulate carbohydrate dynamics in grasses. Overall, this study provides baseline information about potential target genes for engineering peduncle elongation with implications on plant height, biomass composition and grain yields in rice.
