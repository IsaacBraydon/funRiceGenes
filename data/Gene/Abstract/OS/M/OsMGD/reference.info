14605002.pdf	Cloning of a putative monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants and its expression in response to submergence and other stresses	2004	Planta	Laboratory of Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Agriculture, Tottori University, Koyama, 680-8553, Japan.	Suppression subtractive hybridization was used to construct a subtractive cDNA library from plants of non-submerged and 7-day-submerged rice (Oryza sativa L., FR13A, a submergence-tolerant cultivar). One clone of the subtractive cDNA library, S23, was expressed abundantly during submergence. The full length of S23 was amplified using 5'- and 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and found to consist of 1,671 bp with an open reading frame of 1,077 bp (181-1257) encoding 358 amino acids. Its deduced amino acid sequence showed a high homology with monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase (UDPgalactose: 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-beta-D-galactosyl transferase; EC 2.4.1.46, MGDG synthase) from Arabidopsis thaliana; therefore, we named the gene OsMGD. Time-course studies showed that the expression of OsMGD in the rice cultivars FR13A and IR42 (submergence-susceptive cultivar) during submergence was gradually increased and that expression in FR13A was higher than in IR42. The expression of OsMGD in FR13A was influenced by benzyladenine and illumination. The accumulation of OsMGD mRNA in both FR13A and IR42 was also increased by ethephon, gibberellin, drought and salt treatment, but cold stress had no effect on the expression of the gene. These results suggest that the expression of OsMGD mRNA requires benzyladenine or illumination, and that the process is also mediated by ethephon and gibberellin. Salt and drought stress have an effect similar to that of submergence. Furthermore, the enhanced expression of OsMGD may relate to photosynthesis, and play an important role during submergence.
