OsMEK1|OsMKK6	anther	Two novel mitogen-activated protein signaling components, OsMEK1 and OsMAP1, are involved in a moderate low-temperature signaling pathway in rice	Subtractive screening of cDNA that accumulated in 12 degrees C-treated anthers identified a cDNA clone, OsMEK1, encoding a protein with features characteristic of a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase
OsMEK1|OsMKK6	anther	Two novel mitogen-activated protein signaling components, OsMEK1 and OsMAP1, are involved in a moderate low-temperature signaling pathway in rice	OsMEK1 transcript levels were induced in rice anthers by 12 degrees C treatment for 48 h
OsMEK1|OsMKK6	temperature	Two novel mitogen-activated protein signaling components, OsMEK1 and OsMAP1, are involved in a moderate low-temperature signaling pathway in rice	 Taken together, these results lead us to conclude that at least two signaling pathways for low temperature stress exist in rice, and that a MAP kinase pathway with OsMEK1 and OsMAP1 components is possibly involved in the signaling for the higher range low-temperature stress

OsMEK1|OsMKK6	temperature	Biochemical identification of the OsMKK6-OsMPK3 signalling pathway for chilling stress tolerance in rice	 Taken together, our data suggest that OsMKK6 and OsMPK3 constitute a moderately low-temperature signalling pathway and regulate cold stress tolerance in rice
OsMEK1|OsMKK6	salt	Overexpression of constitutively active mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 6 enhances tolerance to salt stress in rice	 In the present study, a MKK from rice (Oryza sativa), OsMKK6 was functionally characterized in salt stress by transforming its constitutively active form
OsMEK1|OsMKK6	salt	Overexpression of constitutively active mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 6 enhances tolerance to salt stress in rice	CONCLUSION: Present work suggest role of OsMKK6 gene in salt stress signaling in rice
