OsMEK1|OsMKK6	OsMPK6|OsMPK4	Biochemical identification of the OsMKK6-OsMPK3 signalling pathway for chilling stress tolerance in rice	 In the present study, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening to identify partner MAPKs for OsMKK (Oryza sativa MAPK kinase) 6, a rice MAPK kinase, and revealed specific interactions of OsMKK6 with OsMPK3 and OsMPK6
OsMEK1|OsMKK6	OsMPK6|OsMPK4	Biochemical identification of the OsMKK6-OsMPK3 signalling pathway for chilling stress tolerance in rice	 OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 each co-immunoprecipitated OsMKK6, and both were directly phosphorylated by OsMKK6 in vitro
OsMEK1|OsMKK6	OsMPK6|OsMPK4	Biochemical identification of the OsMKK6-OsMPK3 signalling pathway for chilling stress tolerance in rice	 A constitutively active form of OsMKK6, OsMKK6DD, showed elevated phosphorylation activity against OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 in vitro
OsMEK1|OsMKK6	OsMPK6|OsMPK4	Biochemical identification of the OsMKK6-OsMPK3 signalling pathway for chilling stress tolerance in rice	 OsMPK3, but not OsMPK6, was constitutively activated in transgenic plants overexpressing OsMKK6DD, indicating that OsMPK3 is an in vivo target of OsMKK6
OsMEK1|OsMKK6	OsMSRMK2|OsMAP1|OsMPK5|OsMAPK2|OsMAPK5|OsBIMK1|OsMPK3	Two novel mitogen-activated protein signaling components, OsMEK1 and OsMAP1, are involved in a moderate low-temperature signaling pathway in rice	 Among the three MAP kinase homologs cloned, only OsMAP1 displayed similar 12 degrees C-specific induction pattern as OsMEK1
OsMEK1|OsMKK6	OsMSRMK2|OsMAP1|OsMPK5|OsMAPK2|OsMAPK5|OsBIMK1|OsMPK3	Two novel mitogen-activated protein signaling components, OsMEK1 and OsMAP1, are involved in a moderate low-temperature signaling pathway in rice	 A yeast two-hybrid system revealed that OsMEK1 interacts with OsMAP1, but not with OsMAP2 and OsMAP3, suggesting that OsMEK1 and OsMAP1 probably function in the same signaling pathway
OsMEK1|OsMKK6	OsMSRMK2|OsMAP1|OsMPK5|OsMAPK2|OsMAPK5|OsBIMK1|OsMPK3	Two novel mitogen-activated protein signaling components, OsMEK1 and OsMAP1, are involved in a moderate low-temperature signaling pathway in rice	 Taken together, these results lead us to conclude that at least two signaling pathways for low temperature stress exist in rice, and that a MAP kinase pathway with OsMEK1 and OsMAP1 components is possibly involved in the signaling for the higher range low-temperature stress
OsMEK1|OsMKK6	OsMSRMK2|OsMAP1|OsMPK5|OsMAPK2|OsMAPK5|OsBIMK1|OsMPK3	Two novel mitogen-activated protein signaling components, OsMEK1 and OsMAP1, are involved in a moderate low-temperature signaling pathway in rice	Two novel mitogen-activated protein signaling components, OsMEK1 and OsMAP1, are involved in a moderate low-temperature signaling pathway in rice
