NA	Regulatory Role of OsTDL1A-MSP1 Signaling in Specifying Anther Cell Identity in Rice.	2016	Plant Physiol	Shanghai Jiao Tong University CITY: Shanghai China [CN].	In flowering plants, sequential formation of anther cell types is a highly ordered process that is essential for successful meiosis and sexual reproduction. Differentiation of meristematic cells and cell-cell communication are proposed to coordinate anther development. Among the proposed mechanisms of cell fate specification are cell surface-localized leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) and their putative ligands. Here we present the genetic and biochemical evidence that a rice LRR-RLK, MSP1, interacts with its ligand OsTDL1A, specifying the cell identity of anther wall layers and microsporocytes. An in vitro assay indicates that the 21 amino-acid peptide of OsTDL1A has a physical interaction with the LRR domain of MSP1. ostdl1a msp1 double mutant showed the defect in lacking middle layers and tapetal cells, and having an increased number of microsporocytes similar to ostdl1a or msp1 single mutant, indicating the same pathway of OsTDL1A-MSP1 in regulating anther development. Genome-wide expression profiles showed the altered expression of genes encoding transcription factors, particularly basic helix-loop-helix and basic leucine zipper domain transcription factors in ostdl1a and msp1. Among these reduced expressed genes, one putatively encodes a TGA (TGACGTCA cis-element-binding protein) factor OsTGA10, and another one encodes a plant-specific CC-type glutaredoxin OsGrx_I1. OsTGA10 was shown to interact with OsGrx_I1, suggesting that OsTDL1A-MSP1 signaling specifies anther cell fate directly or indirectly affecting redox status. Collectively, these data point to a central role of the OsTDL1A-MSP1 signaling pathway in specifying somatic cell identity and suppressing over-proliferation of archesporial cells in rice.
NA	OsMAPKKK63 is involved in salt stress response and seed dormancy control.	2019	Plant Signal Behav	a Department of Biotechnology and Kumho Life Science Laboratory, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences , Chonnam National University , Gwangju , South Korea.	Approximately 75 MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKKs) have been identified in the rice genome. However, only a few of them have been functionally characterized. In this paper, we report the function of a rice MAPKKK, OsMAPKKK63. OsMAPKKK63 was found to be induced by several abiotic stresses, including high salinity, chilling and drought. Our data indicate that OsMAPKKK63 possesses in vitro kinase activity and that it interacts with rice MAP kinase kinase OsMKK1 and OsMKK6. The two rice MKKs are known mediator of the salt stress response, implying that OsMAPKKK63 may be involved in the high salinity response. Our analysis of an OsMAPKKK63 knockout mutant indeed demonstrated that it is necessary for normal response to high salt. On the other hand, OsMAPKKK63 OX lines exhibited viviparous phenotype in both rice and Arabidopsis. The result suggests that OsMAPKKK63 may also be involved in seed dormancy control.
