OsMPK15	resistance	The OsMPK15 Negatively Regulates Magnaporthe oryza and Xoo Disease Resistance via SA and JA Signaling Pathway in Rice.	The OsMPK15 Negatively Regulates Magnaporthe oryza and Xoo Disease Resistance via SA and JA Signaling Pathway in Rice.
OsMPK15	resistance	The OsMPK15 Negatively Regulates Magnaporthe oryza and Xoo Disease Resistance via SA and JA Signaling Pathway in Rice.	 In this article, to characterize the mechanisms, the knock-out and overexpression mutants of OsMPK15 were constructed and the disease resistance was investigated under the various fungal and bacterial inoculations
OsMPK15	resistance	The OsMPK15 Negatively Regulates Magnaporthe oryza and Xoo Disease Resistance via SA and JA Signaling Pathway in Rice.	 The knock-out mutant of OsMPK15 resulted in the constitutive expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggered by the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) elicitor chitin, and significantly enhanced the disease resistance to different races of Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv
OsMPK15	resistance	The OsMPK15 Negatively Regulates Magnaporthe oryza and Xoo Disease Resistance via SA and JA Signaling Pathway in Rice.	 We conclude that OsMPK15 may negatively regulate the disease resistance through modulating SA- and JA-mediated signaling pathway
