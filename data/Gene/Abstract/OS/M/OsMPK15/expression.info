OsMPK15	 In this article, to characterize the mechanisms, the knock-out and overexpression mutants of OsMPK15 were constructed and the disease resistance was investigated under the various fungal and bacterial inoculations |  The knock-out mutant of OsMPK15 resulted in the constitutive expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggered by the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) elicitor chitin, and significantly enhanced the disease resistance to different races of Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv |  On contrary, the expression of PR genes and ROS were down-regulated in the OsMPK15-overexpressing (OsMPK15-OE) lines |  The expression of SA- and JA-pathway associated genes were significantly upregulated in the mpk15 mutant, whereas it was down regulated in the OsMPK15-OE lines	 In this article, to characterize the mechanisms, the knock-out and overexpression mutants of OsMPK15 were constructed and the disease resistance was investigated under the various fungal and bacterial inoculations
