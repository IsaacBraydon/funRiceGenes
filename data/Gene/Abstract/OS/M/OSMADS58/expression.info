OSMADS58	A gene expression profiling of early rice stamen development that reveals inhibition of photosynthetic genesby OsMADS58. |  Following the finding of systematic low expression of nuclear genes encoding photosynthetic proteins in early rice stamen, we found that a C-class MADS box protein OsMADS58 can bind many nuclear coded photosystem and other light reaction genes based on ChIP-seq analysis |  When the expression level of OsMADS58 is downregulated, e |  in osmads58 mutant, the expression levels of OsMADS58 target genes increase, more prochloroplasts are observed, and more ROS signal is detected in the mutant anthers
