OSMADS3	OSMADS58	Functional diversification of the two C-class MADS box genes OSMADS3 and OSMADS58 in Oryza sativa	To examine the conservation and diversification of C-class gene function in monocots, we analyzed two C-class genes in rice (Oryza sativa), OSMADS3 and OSMADS58, which may have arisen by gene duplication before divergence of rice and maize (Zea mays)
OSMADS3	OSMADS58	Functional diversification of the two C-class MADS box genes OSMADS3 and OSMADS58 in Oryza sativa	, the functions regulated by AG have been partially partitioned into two paralogous genes, OSMADS3 and OSMADS58, which were produced by a recent gene duplication event in plant evolution)

CCP1|DFO1|EMF1|OsEMF1	OSMADS58	CURVED CHIMERIC PALEA 1 encoding an EMF1-like protein maintains epigenetic repression of OsMADS58 in rice palea development.	We found that OsMADS58, a C-class gene responsible for carpel morphogenesis, was ectopically expressed in the ccp1palea, indicating that the ccp1 palea was misspecified and partially acquired carpel-like identity
CCP1|DFO1|EMF1|OsEMF1	OSMADS58	CURVED CHIMERIC PALEA 1 encoding an EMF1-like protein maintains epigenetic repression of OsMADS58 in rice palea development.	Constitutive expression of OsMADS58 in the wild-type rice plants caused morphological abnormality of palea similar to that of ccp1, whereas OsMADS58 knockdown by RNAi in ccp1 could rescue the abnormal phenotype of mutant palea, suggesting that the repression of OsMADS58 expression by CCP1 is critical for palea development
CCP1|DFO1|EMF1|OsEMF1	OSMADS58	CURVED CHIMERIC PALEA 1 encoding an EMF1-like protein maintains epigenetic repression of OsMADS58 in rice palea development.	Taken together, our results show that CCP1 plays an important role in palea development through maintaining H3K27me3-mediated epigenetic silence of the carpel identity-specifying gene OsMADS58, shedding light on the epigenetic mechanism in floral organ development
OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	OSMADS58	Interactions of OsMADS1 with Floral Homeotic Genes in Rice Flower Development.	The physical and genetic interaction of OsMADS1 and OsMADS3 is essential for floral meristem activity maintenance and organ identity specification; while OsMADS1 physically and genetically interacts with OsMADS58 in regulating floral meristem determinacy and suppressing spikelet meristem reversion
CFO1|OsMADS32	OSMADS58	OsMADS32 Regulates Rice Floral Patterning through Interactions with Multiple Floral Homeotic Genes	 Furthermore, our results indicate important roles of OsMADS32 in defining stamen, pistil and ovule development through physical and genetic interactions with OsMADS1, OsMADS58 and OsMADS13, and in specifying floral meristem identity with OsMADS6, OsMADS3 and OsMADS58 respectively
