OSMADS3	OSMADS58	Functional diversification of the two C-class MADS box genes OSMADS3 and OSMADS58 in Oryza sativa	 To examine the conservation and diversification of C-class gene function in monocots, we analyzed two C-class genes in rice (Oryza sativa), OSMADS3 and OSMADS58, which may have arisen by gene duplication before divergence of rice and maize (Zea mays)|, the functions regulated by AG have been partially partitioned into two paralogous genes, OSMADS3 and OSMADS58, which were produced by a recent gene duplication event in plant evolution)|Functional diversification of the two C-class MADS box genes OSMADS3 and OSMADS58 in Oryza sativa
