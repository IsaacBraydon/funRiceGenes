Mol. Plant-2013-Luo-729-42.pdf	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	2013	Mol Plant	College of Plant Protection, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China.	MSH5, a meiosis-specific member of the MutS-homolog family, is required for normal level of recombination in budding yeast, mice, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Arabidopsis. Here, we report the identification and characterization of its rice homolog, OsMSH5, and demonstrate its function in rice meiosis. Five independent Osmsh5 mutants exhibited normal vegetative growth and severe sterility. The synaptonemal complex is well installed in Osmsh5, while the chiasma frequency is greatly reduced to approximately 10% of that observed in the wild-type, leading to the homologous non-disjunction and complete sterile phenotype. OsMSH5 is predominantly expressed in panicles. Immunofluorescence studies indicate that OsMSH5 chromosomal localization is limited to the early meiotic prophase I. OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10. However, those ZMM proteins cannot be localized normally in the absence of OsMSH5. Furthermore, the residual chiasmata were shown to be the least frequent among the zmm mutants, including Osmer3, Oszip4, hei10, and Osmsh5. Taken together, we propose that OsMSH5 functions upstream of OsZIP4, OsMER3, and HEI10 in class I crossover formation.
NA	RAD51C-RAD51D interplays with MSH5 and regulates crossover maturation in rice meiosis.	2023	New Phytol	Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Regulation Biology of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China.	Meiotic crossovers ensure accurate chromosome segregation and increase genetic diversity. RAD51C and RAD51D play an early role in facilitating RAD51 during homologous recombination. However, their later function in meiosis is largely unknown in plants. Here, through targeted disruption of RAD51C and RAD51D, we generated three new mutants and revealed their later meiotic role in crossover maturation. The rad51c-3 and rad51d-4 mutants showed a mixture of bivalents and univalents and no chromosomal entanglements, whereas rad51d-5 exhibited an intermediate phenotype with reduced chromosomal entanglements and increased bivalent formation compared with knockout alleles. Comparisons of RAD51 loadings and chromosomal entanglements in these single mutants, rad51c-3 rad51d-4, rad51c-3 dmc1a dmc1b, and rad51d-4 dmc1a dmc1b suggest that the retained level of RAD51 in mutants is required for uncovering their function in crossover formation. Reductions in chiasma frequency and later HEI10 foci in these mutants support that crossover maturation requires RAD51C and RAD51D. Moreover, interaction between RAD51D and MSH5 indicates that RAD51 paralogs may cooperate with MSH5 to ensure accurate Holliday junction processing into crossover products. This finding of the role of RAD51 paralogs in crossover control may be conserved from mammals to plants and advances our current understanding of these proteins.
