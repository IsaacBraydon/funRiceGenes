HEI10	OsMSH5	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10
HEI10	OsMSH5	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	Furthermore, the residual chiasmata were shown to be the least frequent among the zmm mutants, including Osmer3, Oszip4, hei10, and Osmsh5
HEI10	OsMSH5	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	Taken together, we propose that OsMSH5 functions upstream of OsZIP4, OsMER3, and HEI10 in class I crossover formation

OsMSH4	OsMSH5	Crossover Formation During Rice Meiosis Relies on Interaction of OsMSH4 and OsMSH5	Crossover Formation During Rice Meiosis Relies on Interaction of OsMSH4 and OsMSH5
OsMSH4	OsMSH5	The role of OsMSH4 in male and female gamete development in rice meiosis.	OsMSH4 could interact with another MSH member (OsMSH5) through the N-terminus and C-terminus, respectively
OsMSH5	OsRAD17	OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.	 Similar phenotypes were observed in the Osmsh5 Osrad17 and Osmer3 Osrad1 double mutants, suggesting the cooperation between the checkpoint proteins and ZMM proteins in assuring accurate HR in rice
HEIP1|OsAGG1	OsMSH5	The plant-specific gene ABERRANT GAMETOGENESIS 1 is essential for meiosis in rice.	 Moreover, OsAGG1 was found to interact with ZMM proteins OsHEI10, OsZIP4 and OsMSH5
