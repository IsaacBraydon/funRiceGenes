HEI10	OsMSH5	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	 OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10| Furthermore, the residual chiasmata were shown to be the least frequent among the zmm mutants, including Osmer3, Oszip4, hei10, and Osmsh5| Taken together, we propose that OsMSH5 functions upstream of OsZIP4, OsMER3, and HEI10 in class I crossover formation
