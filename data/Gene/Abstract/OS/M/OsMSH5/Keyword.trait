OsMSH5	sterile	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	 The synaptonemal complex is well installed in Osmsh5, while the chiasma frequency is greatly reduced to approximately 10% of that observed in the wild-type, leading to the homologous non-disjunction and complete sterile phenotype
OsMSH5	meiotic	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	 Immunofluorescence studies indicate that OsMSH5 chromosomal localization is limited to the early meiotic prophase I
OsMSH5	meiotic	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	 OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10
OsMSH5	meiosis	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	 Here, we report the identification and characterization of its rice homolog, OsMSH5, and demonstrate its function in rice meiosis
OsMSH5	meiosis	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis
OsMSH5	panicle	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	 OsMSH5 is predominantly expressed in panicles
OsMSH5	sterility	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	 Five independent Osmsh5 mutants exhibited normal vegetative growth and severe sterility
OsMSH5	vegetative	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	 Five independent Osmsh5 mutants exhibited normal vegetative growth and severe sterility
OsMSH5	growth	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	 Five independent Osmsh5 mutants exhibited normal vegetative growth and severe sterility
OsMSH5	crossover	Crossover Formation During Rice Meiosis Relies on Interaction of OsMSH4 and OsMSH5	The MSH4-MSH5 heterodimer has been demonstrated in mammals to stabilize the formation of progenitor and double Holliday junctions that may be resolved as crossovers (COs).
