Osmyb2	Osmyb5	Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed	 RT-PCR analysis showed that Osmyb2, Osmyb3 and Osmyb5 genes were expressed in all tissues examined
Osmyb3	Osmyb5	Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed	 RT-PCR analysis showed that Osmyb2, Osmyb3 and Osmyb5 genes were expressed in all tissues examined
Osmyb3	Osmyb5	Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed	 Another myb-like clone, Osmyb5, was obtained by screening a rice seed cDNA library with probes designed to recognize the AACA-like binding domain in GAMYB and PHMYB3
Osmyb3	Osmyb5	Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed	 As Osmyb5 exhibits a high similarity to the regions in both GAMYB and PHMYB3, which can bind to the AACA motif, there is a possibility that the OSMYB5 protein may bind to the AACA motif of glutelin genes
