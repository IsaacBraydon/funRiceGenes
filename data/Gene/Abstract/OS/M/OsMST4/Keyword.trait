OsMST4	endosperm	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of a monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST4 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Cellular location in young caryopses through RNA in situ hybridization showed that OsMST4 mRNA mainly accumulates in the vascular parenchyma of the chalazal vein, cross-cells, nucellar tissue and endosperm
OsMST4	grain	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of a monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST4 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	These data indicate that OsMST4 is actively involved in monosaccharides supply for seed development during the course of grain filling
OsMST4	seed development	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of a monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST4 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	These data indicate that OsMST4 is actively involved in monosaccharides supply for seed development during the course of grain filling
OsMST4	transporter	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of a monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST4 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	The deduced OsMST4 protein shows typical features of monosaccharide transporters, and shares high homology with other plant homologues
OsMST4	transporter	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of a monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST4 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Heterologous expression in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) showed that OsMST4 is a functional monosaccharide transporter capable of transporting glucose, fructose, mannose and galactose
OsMST4	transporter	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of a monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST4 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of a monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST4 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)
OsMST4	grain filling	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of a monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST4 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	These data indicate that OsMST4 is actively involved in monosaccharides supply for seed development during the course of grain filling
OsMST4	seed	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of a monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST4 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	These data indicate that OsMST4 is actively involved in monosaccharides supply for seed development during the course of grain filling
