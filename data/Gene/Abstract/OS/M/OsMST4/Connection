OsMST4	OsNF-YB1	NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm	Real-time PCR performed in caryopses collected at 5 DAP showed that levels of SUT1, SUT3, SUT4 and MST4 expression were reduced in nfyb1-1, while no evident reduction was observed for SUT2, suggesting that SUT1, SUT3, SUT4 and MST4 may be regulated by NF-YB1
