NA	Molecular characterization of rice endosperm development under heat stress identifies OsMADS87 as a determinant of seed size and thermal sensitivity.	2016	Plant Physiol	University of Nebraska CITY: Lincoln United States Of America [US].	Early seed development events are highly sensitive to increased temperature. This high sensitivity to a short duration temperature spike reduces seed viability and seed size at maturity. The molecular basis of the heat stress sensitivity during early seed development is not known. We selected rice, a highly heat-sensitive species to explore this phenomenon. Here, we elucidate the molecular pathways that contribute to the heat sensitivity of a critical developmental window during which the endosperm transitions from syncytium to the cellularization stage in young seeds. A transcriptomic comparison of seeds exposed to moderate (35°C) and severe heat stress (39°C) with control (28°C) seeds identified a set of putative imprinted genes, which were down-regulated under severe heat stress. Several Type-I MADS box genes, specifically expressed during the syncytial stage were differentially regulated under moderate and severe heat stress. The suppression and over-accumulation of these genes is associated with precocious and delayed cellularization under moderate and severe stress, respectively. We show that modulating the expression of OsMADS87, one of the heat-sensitive, imprinted genes associated with syncytial stage endosperm, regulates rice seed size. Transgenic seeds deficient in OsMADS87 exhibit accelerated endosperm cellularization. These seeds also have lower sensitivity to a moderate heat stress in terms of seed size reduction compared to seeds from wild type and plants over-expressing OsMADS87. Our findings suggest that OsMADS87 and several other genes identified in this study could be potential targets for improving thermal resilience of rice during reproductive development.
