OsMYB6	Overexpression of a MYB Family Gene, OsMYB6, Increases Drought and Salinity Stress Tolerance in Transgenic Rice. |  Overexpression of OsMYB6 in rice did not suggest a negative effect on the growth and development of transgenic plants, but OsMYB6-overexpressing plants showed increased tolerance to drought and salt stress compared with wild-type plants, as are evaluated by higher proline content, higher CAT and SOD activities, lower REL and MDA content in transgenic plants under drought and salt stress conditions |  In addition, the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes were significantly higher in OsMYB6 transgenic plants than that in wild-type plants under drought and salt stress conditions	Overexpression of a MYB Family Gene, OsMYB6, Increases Drought and Salinity Stress Tolerance in Transgenic Rice. |  Overexpression of OsMYB6 in rice did not suggest a negative effect on the growth and development of transgenic plants, but OsMYB6-overexpressing plants showed increased tolerance to drought and salt stress compared with wild-type plants, as are evaluated by higher proline content, higher CAT and SOD activities, lower REL and MDA content in transgenic plants under drought and salt stress conditions
OsMYB6|ARE4	 Upon sensing a glucose signal, ARE4 is released, is translocated into the nucleus, and activates the expression of a subset of high-affinity nitrate transporter genes, thereby boosting nitrate uptake and accumulation |  The are4 mutations compromise in nitrate utilization and plant growth, whereas overexpression of ARE4 increases grain size	 The are4 mutations compromise in nitrate utilization and plant growth, whereas overexpression of ARE4 increases grain size
