NA	Overexpression of a MYB Family Gene, OsMYB6, Increases Drought and Salinity Stress Tolerance in Transgenic Rice.	2019	Front Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Plant Genetics and Molecular Breeding, Zhoukou Normal University, Zhoukou, China.	MYB transcription factors have been demonstrated to play key regulatory roles in plant growth, development and abiotic stress response. However, knowledge concerning the involvement of rice MYB genes in salinity and drought stress resistance are largely unknown. In the present study, we cloned and characterized the OsMYB6 gene, which was induced by drought and salinity stress. Subcellular localization of OsMYB6-YFP fusion protein in protoplast cells indicated that OsMYB6 was localized in the nucleus. Overexpression of OsMYB6 in rice did not suggest a negative effect on the growth and development of transgenic plants, but OsMYB6-overexpressing plants showed increased tolerance to drought and salt stress compared with wild-type plants, as are evaluated by higher proline content, higher CAT and SOD activities, lower REL and MDA content in transgenic plants under drought and salt stress conditions. In addition, the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes were significantly higher in OsMYB6 transgenic plants than that in wild-type plants under drought and salt stress conditions. These results indicate that OsMYB6 gene functions as a stress-responsive transcription factor which plays a positive regulatory role in response to drought and salt stress resistance, and may be used as a candidate gene for molecular breeding of salt-tolerant and drought-tolerant crop varieties.
NA	Link glucose signaling to nitrogen utilization by the OsHXK7-ARE4 complex in rice.	2023	Dev Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; College of Advanced Agricultural Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.	How reciprocal regulation of carbon and nitrogen metabolism works is a long-standing question. In plants, glucose and nitrate are proposed to act as signaling molecules, regulating carbon and nitrogen metabolism via largely unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that the MYB-related transcription factor ARE4 coordinates glucose signaling and nitrogen utilization in rice. ARE4 is retained in the cytosol in complexing with the glucose sensor OsHXK7. Upon sensing a glucose signal, ARE4 is released, is translocated into the nucleus, and activates the expression of a subset of high-affinity nitrate transporter genes, thereby boosting nitrate uptake and accumulation. This regulatory scheme displays a diurnal pattern in response to circadian changes of soluble sugars. The are4 mutations compromise in nitrate utilization and plant growth, whereas overexpression of ARE4 increases grain size. We propose that the OsHXK7-ARE4 complex links glucose to the transcriptional regulation of nitrogen utilization, thereby coordinating carbon and nitrogen metabolism.
