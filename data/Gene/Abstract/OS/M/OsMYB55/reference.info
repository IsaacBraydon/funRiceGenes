El-Kereamy-2012-The rice R2R3-MYB tr.pdf	The rice R2R3-MYB transcription factor OsMYB55 is involved in the tolerance to high temperature and modulates amino acid metabolism	2012	PLoS One	Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.	Temperatures higher than the optimum negatively affects plant growth and development. Tolerance to high temperature is a complex process that involves several pathways. Understanding this process, especially in crops such as rice, is essential to prepare for predicted climate changes due to global warming. Here, we show that OsMYB55 is induced by high temperature and overexpression of OsMYB55 resulted in improved plant growth under high temperature and decreased the negative effect of high temperature on grain yield. Transcriptome analysis revealed an increase in expression of several genes involved in amino acids metabolism. We demonstrate that OsMYB55 binds to the promoter regions of target genes and directly activates expression of some of those genes including glutamine synthetase (OsGS1;2) glutamine amidotransferase (GAT1) and glutamate decarboxylase 3 (GAD3). OsMYB55 overexpression resulted in an increase in total amino acid content and of the individual amino acids produced by the activation of the above mentioned genes and known for their roles in stress tolerance, namely L-glutamic acid, GABA and arginine especially under high temperature condition. In conclusion, overexpression of OsMYB55 improves rice plant tolerance to high temperature, and this high tolerance is associated with enhanced amino acid metabolism through transcription activation.
NA	The MAMP-responsive MYB transcription factors MYB30, MYB55, and MYB110 activate the HCAA synthesis pathway and enhance immunity in rice.	2018	Plant Cell Physiol	Genetically Modified Organism Research Center.	Phenylpropanoids including diverse compounds, such as monolignols and hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAAs), are essential for land plants to protect them against abiotic stresses, and create physical and chemical barriers to pathogen infection. However, the production control of these compounds against to pathogens has been poorly understood. Previously we showed that a MAMP (microbe-associated molecular pattern) -responsive MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascade (MKK4-MPK3/MPK6) comprehensively induced the expression of cinnamate/monolignol synthesis genes in rice cells. Here, we identified three MYB proteins, MYB30, MYB55, and MYB110, which are transcriptionally induced by the MAMP-treatment, MAPK-activation, and pathogen inoculation. Induced expression of these MYB genes systematically and specifically induced a large part of the genes encoding enzymes in the cinnamate/monolignol pathway. Furthermore, induced expression of the MYB genes caused accumulation of ferulic acid, one of the HCAAs, and enhanced resistance to both fungal and bacterial pathogens in planta. In conclusion, MYB30, MYB55, and MYB110 are involved in the signal pathway between MAMP perception and cinnamate/monolignol synthesis, and have important roles for plant immunity.
NA	A rice gene, OsPL, encoding a MYB family transcription factor confers anthocyanin synthesis, heat stress response and hormonal signaling.	2019	Gene	Department of Agronomy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Sylhet Agricultural University, Sylhet, Bangladesh. Electronic address: 11516090@zju.edu.cn.	Plants with purple leave attain interest because of their biological importance. A new rice mutant, purple leaf (pl) was isolated from an indicia cultivar Zhenong 34, which was induced by ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis. The genetic analyses substantiated that pl was corroborated by one recessive allele and confirmed by map based cloning using Insertion-Deletion (InDel) markers located on the long arm of chromosome 5. DNAseq data of the candidate part showed one bp insertion ('C' insertion) at +901<U+202F>bp position in the 3rd exon of OsPL gene. The pl was characterized as purple leaves, sheaths and leaf senescence phenotype at late grain filling stage of growth cycle. It possessed abnormal cell with distorted chloroplasts, less chlorophyll, and increased anthocyanin content in leaves. The anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, OsPAL, OsCHS, OsANS, and OsMYB55 showed up-regulation in pl plants compared to wild type (WT). High super oxide dismutase enzyme (SOD), catalase enzyme activity (CAT), total soluble sugar (TSS) and malondialdehyde activity (MDA) were detected in the pl; contrastingly, photosynthesis linked genes were down-regulated. The germinated pl seeds showed comparatively higher temperature stress tolerance than WT. The phytohormones abscicic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA) and indole acetic acid (IAA) content were increased significantly in the pl plants. This research work will be provided information on better understanding of the molecular mechanism toward the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in rice. Therefore, OsPL gene could be a good genetic tool in marker aided backcrossing or gene editing for improving the rice cultivation in future.
