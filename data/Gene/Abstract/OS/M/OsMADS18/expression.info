OsMADS18	 Here, we report that downregulation of OsMADS18 expression in the RNAi lines caused delay in seed germination and young seedling growth, whereas the overexpression (OE) of OsMADS18 produced plants with less tillers |  The expression of OsMADS18 could be stimulated by ABA, and ABA-stimulation triggered the cleavage of HA-OsMADS18 and the translocation of OsMADS18 from the PM to the nucleus	 Here, we report that downregulation of OsMADS18 expression in the RNAi lines caused delay in seed germination and young seedling growth, whereas the overexpression (OE) of OsMADS18 produced plants with less tillers	 Here, we report that downregulation of OsMADS18 expression in the RNAi lines caused delay in seed germination and young seedling growth, whereas the overexpression (OE) of OsMADS18 produced plants with less tillers
