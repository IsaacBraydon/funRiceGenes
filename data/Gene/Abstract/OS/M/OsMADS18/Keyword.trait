OsMADS18	flower	Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes	Overexpression of OsMADS18 in rice induced early flowering, and detailed histological analysis revealed that the formation of axillary shoot meristems was accelerated
OsMADS18	meristem	Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes	Overexpression of OsMADS18 in rice induced early flowering, and detailed histological analysis revealed that the formation of axillary shoot meristems was accelerated
OsMADS18	shoot	Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes	Overexpression of OsMADS18 in rice induced early flowering, and detailed histological analysis revealed that the formation of axillary shoot meristems was accelerated
OsMADS18	transcription factor	Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes	Silencing of OsMADS18 using an RNA interference approach did not result in any visible phenotypic alteration, indicating that OsMADS18 is probably redundant with other MADS box transcription factors
OsMADS18	seed	Ternary complex formation between MADS-box transcription factors and the histone fold protein NF-YB	A rice seed-specific NF-YB was identified as partner of OsMADS18 by two-hybrid screening
OsMADS18	heading date	Functional analyses of the flowering time gene OsMADS50, the putative SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1/AGAMOUS-LIKE 20 (SOC1/AGL20) ortholog in rice	RT-PCR analyses of the OsMADS50 KO and ubiquitin (ubi):OsMADS50 plants showed that OsMADS50 is an upstream regulator of OsMADS1, OsMADS14, OsMADS15, OsMADS18, and Hd (Heading date)3a, but works either parallel with or downstream of Hd1 and O
OsMADS18	transcription factor	OsMADS18, a membrane-bound MADS-box transcription factor, modulates plant architecture and the ABA response in rice.	The APETALA1 (AP1)/FRUITFULL (FUL)-like transcription factor OsMADS18 plays diverse functions in rice development, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are far from fully understood
OsMADS18	seedling	OsMADS18, a membrane-bound MADS-box transcription factor, modulates plant architecture and the ABA response in rice.	 Here, we report that downregulation of OsMADS18 expression in the RNAi lines caused delay in seed germination and young seedling growth, whereas the overexpression (OE) of OsMADS18 produced plants with less tillers
OsMADS18	development	OsMADS18, a membrane-bound MADS-box transcription factor, modulates plant architecture and the ABA response in rice.	 Finally, the results from analyzing the interaction of OsMADS18 with OsMADS14, OsMADS15, and OsMADS57 suggest an essential role of OsMADS18 in rice development
OsMADS18	seed	OsMADS18, a membrane-bound MADS-box transcription factor, modulates plant architecture and the ABA response in rice.	 Here, we report that downregulation of OsMADS18 expression in the RNAi lines caused delay in seed germination and young seedling growth, whereas the overexpression (OE) of OsMADS18 produced plants with less tillers
OsMADS18	seed germination	OsMADS18, a membrane-bound MADS-box transcription factor, modulates plant architecture and the ABA response in rice.	 Here, we report that downregulation of OsMADS18 expression in the RNAi lines caused delay in seed germination and young seedling growth, whereas the overexpression (OE) of OsMADS18 produced plants with less tillers
OsMADS18	nucleus	OsMADS18, a membrane-bound MADS-box transcription factor, modulates plant architecture and the ABA response in rice.	 The expression of OsMADS18 could be stimulated by ABA, and ABA-stimulation triggered the cleavage of HA-OsMADS18 and the translocation of OsMADS18 from the PM to the nucleus
OsMADS18	panicle	Genome-wide expression quantitative trait locus studies facilitate isolation of causal genes controlling panicle structure 	 By combining pQTL and eQTL data, two genes were identified as controlling panicle structure: OsMADS18 modulates the average length of the primary rachis and OsFTL1 has pleiotropic effects on the total number of secondary rachides, number of grains per panicle, plant height and the length of flag leaves
OsMADS18	grains per panicle	Genome-wide expression quantitative trait locus studies facilitate isolation of causal genes controlling panicle structure 	 By combining pQTL and eQTL data, two genes were identified as controlling panicle structure: OsMADS18 modulates the average length of the primary rachis and OsFTL1 has pleiotropic effects on the total number of secondary rachides, number of grains per panicle, plant height and the length of flag leaves
