OsMADS18	flower	Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes	Overexpression of OsMADS18 in rice induced early flowering, and detailed histological analysis revealed that the formation of axillary shoot meristems was accelerated
OsMADS18	meristem	Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes	Overexpression of OsMADS18 in rice induced early flowering, and detailed histological analysis revealed that the formation of axillary shoot meristems was accelerated
OsMADS18	shoot	Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes	Overexpression of OsMADS18 in rice induced early flowering, and detailed histological analysis revealed that the formation of axillary shoot meristems was accelerated
OsMADS18	transcription factor	Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes	Silencing of OsMADS18 using an RNA interference approach did not result in any visible phenotypic alteration, indicating that OsMADS18 is probably redundant with other MADS box transcription factors
OsMADS18	seed	Ternary complex formation between MADS-box transcription factors and the histone fold protein NF-YB	A rice seed-specific NF-YB was identified as partner of OsMADS18 by two-hybrid screening
OsMADS18	heading date	Functional analyses of the flowering time gene OsMADS50, the putative SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1/AGAMOUS-LIKE 20 (SOC1/AGL20) ortholog in rice	RT-PCR analyses of the OsMADS50 KO and ubiquitin (ubi):OsMADS50 plants showed that OsMADS50 is an upstream regulator of OsMADS1, OsMADS14, OsMADS15, OsMADS18, and Hd (Heading date)3a, but works either parallel with or downstream of Hd1 and O
