Galactolipids are essential for compensating for the loss of phospholipids by &quot;membrane lipid remodeling&quot; in plants under phosphorus (P) deficiency. Monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (MGDG) synthases catalyze the synthesis of MGDG which is further converted into digalactosyl diacylglycerol (DGDG), later replacing phospholipids in the extraplastidial membranes. However, the roles of these enzymes are not well explored in rice. In this study, the rice MGDG synthase gene, OsMGD3 was identified and functionally characterized. We showed that plant phosphate (Pi) status and transcription factor OsPHR2 are involved in the transcriptional regulation of OsMGD3. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (KO) and overexpression (OE) lines of OsMGD3 were generated to explore its potential role in rice adaptation to Pi deficiency. Compared to WT, OsMGD3 KO lines displayed a reduction while OE lines showed an enhanced, Pi acquisition and utilization. Further, OsMGD3 showed a predominant role in roots, altering lateral root growth. Our comprehensive lipidomic analysis revealed the role of OsMGD3 in membrane lipid remodeling in addition to a role in regulating diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid levels that affected the expression of Pi transporters. Our study highlights the role of OsMGD3 in affecting both internal P utilization and P acquisition in rice.
