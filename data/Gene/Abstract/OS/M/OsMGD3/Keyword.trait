OsMGD3	transcription factor	Monogalactosyl Diacylglycerol Synthase 3 (OsMGD3) affects phosphate utilization and acquisition in rice.	 We showed that plant phosphate (Pi) status and transcription factor OsPHR2 are involved in the transcriptional regulation of OsMGD3
OsMGD3	root	Monogalactosyl Diacylglycerol Synthase 3 (OsMGD3) affects phosphate utilization and acquisition in rice.	 Further, OsMGD3 showed a predominant role in roots, altering lateral root growth

OsMGD3	phosphate	Monogalactosyl Diacylglycerol Synthase 3 (OsMGD3) affects phosphate utilization and acquisition in rice.	 We showed that plant phosphate (Pi) status and transcription factor OsPHR2 are involved in the transcriptional regulation of OsMGD3
OsMGD3	Pi	Monogalactosyl Diacylglycerol Synthase 3 (OsMGD3) affects phosphate utilization and acquisition in rice.	 CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (KO) and overexpression (OE) lines of OsMGD3 were generated to explore its potential role in rice adaptation to Pi deficiency
OsMGD3	Pi	Monogalactosyl Diacylglycerol Synthase 3 (OsMGD3) affects phosphate utilization and acquisition in rice.	 Compared to WT, OsMGD3 KO lines displayed a reduction while OE lines showed an enhanced, Pi acquisition and utilization
OsMGD3	Pi	Monogalactosyl Diacylglycerol Synthase 3 (OsMGD3) affects phosphate utilization and acquisition in rice.	 Our comprehensive lipidomic analysis revealed the role of OsMGD3 in membrane lipid remodeling in addition to a role in regulating diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid levels that affected the expression of Pi transporters
