OsMPS	salt	MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways	OsMPS is induced by salt stress and expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues
OsMPS	biomass	MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways	Over-expression of OsMPS reduces growth under non-stress conditions, while knockdown plants display increased biomass
OsMPS	reproductive	MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways	OsMPS is induced by salt stress and expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues
OsMPS	phytohormone	MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways	Expression profiling revealed that OsMPS negatively regulates the expression of EXPANSIN (EXP) and cell-wall biosynthesis as well as phytohormone signaling genes
OsMPS	phytohormone	MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways	The multiple responses of OsMPS and its target genes to various hormones suggest an integrative function of OsMPS in the cross-talk between phytohormones and the environment to regulate adaptive growth
OsMPS	cytokinin	MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways	OsMPS expression is induced by abscisic acid and cytokinin, but is repressed by auxin, gibberellin and brassinolide
OsMPS	cytokinin	MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways	Furthermore, the expression of OsMPS-dependent genes is regulated by auxin, cytokinin and abscisic acid
OsMPS	vegetative	MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways	OsMPS is induced by salt stress and expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues
OsMPS	salt stress	MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways	OsMPS is induced by salt stress and expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues
OsMPS	transcription factor	MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways	Here, the role of MULTIPASS (OsMPS), an R2R3-type MYB transcription factor of rice, was explored
OsMPS	gibberellin	MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways	OsMPS expression is induced by abscisic acid and cytokinin, but is repressed by auxin, gibberellin and brassinolide
