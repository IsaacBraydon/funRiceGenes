OsMT1d	 Expression analysis of ROS producing and scavenging genes revealed that the metallothionein genes clustered on chromosome 12, especially OsMT1d, were strongly repressed in OsWRKY42OX plants |  An OsMT1d promoter:LUC construct was found to be repressed by OsWRKY42 overexpression in rice protoplasts	 An OsMT1d promoter:LUC construct was found to be repressed by OsWRKY42 overexpression in rice protoplasts
