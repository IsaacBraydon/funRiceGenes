OsMT1a|rgMT|OsMT1e	root	Identification of a new function of metallothionein-like gene OsMT1e for cadmium detoxification and potential phytoremediation	 Phenotypic analysis revealed that OsMT1e overexpression enhanced the rice growth concerning the increased shoot or root elongation, dry weight and chlorophyll contents, whereas the RNAi lines displayed a sensitive growth phenotype compared to wild-type
OsMT1a|rgMT|OsMT1e	growth	Identification of a new function of metallothionein-like gene OsMT1e for cadmium detoxification and potential phytoremediation	 Phenotypic analysis revealed that OsMT1e overexpression enhanced the rice growth concerning the increased shoot or root elongation, dry weight and chlorophyll contents, whereas the RNAi lines displayed a sensitive growth phenotype compared to wild-type
OsMT1a|rgMT|OsMT1e	shoot	Identification of a new function of metallothionein-like gene OsMT1e for cadmium detoxification and potential phytoremediation	 Phenotypic analysis revealed that OsMT1e overexpression enhanced the rice growth concerning the increased shoot or root elongation, dry weight and chlorophyll contents, whereas the RNAi lines displayed a sensitive growth phenotype compared to wild-type
OsMT1a|rgMT|OsMT1e	seed	Identification of a new function of metallothionein-like gene OsMT1e for cadmium detoxification and potential phytoremediation	 OsMT1e was dominantly expressed in roots at all developmental stages and, to less extent, expressed in leaves at vegetative and seed filling stages
OsMT1a|rgMT|OsMT1e	tolerance	Identification of a new function of metallothionein-like gene OsMT1e for cadmium detoxification and potential phytoremediation	 Expression of OsMT1e in a yeast Cd-sensitive strain ycf1 conferred cellular tolerance to Cd, even though the ycf1 + OsMT1e cells accumulated more Cd than the control cells (ycf1 + pYES2)
OsMT1a|rgMT|OsMT1e	vegetative	Identification of a new function of metallothionein-like gene OsMT1e for cadmium detoxification and potential phytoremediation	 OsMT1e was dominantly expressed in roots at all developmental stages and, to less extent, expressed in leaves at vegetative and seed filling stages
OsMT1a|rgMT|OsMT1e	root elongation	Identification of a new function of metallothionein-like gene OsMT1e for cadmium detoxification and potential phytoremediation	 Phenotypic analysis revealed that OsMT1e overexpression enhanced the rice growth concerning the increased shoot or root elongation, dry weight and chlorophyll contents, whereas the RNAi lines displayed a sensitive growth phenotype compared to wild-type
OsMT1a|rgMT|OsMT1e	nucleus	Identification of a new function of metallothionein-like gene OsMT1e for cadmium detoxification and potential phytoremediation	 OsMT1e was mainly targeted to the nucleus and substantially induced by Cd exposure
OsMT1a|rgMT|OsMT1e	cadmium	Identification of a new function of metallothionein-like gene OsMT1e for cadmium detoxification and potential phytoremediation	Identification of a new function of metallothionein-like gene OsMT1e for cadmium detoxification and potential phytoremediation
OsMT1a|rgMT|OsMT1e	chlorophyll content	Identification of a new function of metallothionein-like gene OsMT1e for cadmium detoxification and potential phytoremediation	 Phenotypic analysis revealed that OsMT1e overexpression enhanced the rice growth concerning the increased shoot or root elongation, dry weight and chlorophyll contents, whereas the RNAi lines displayed a sensitive growth phenotype compared to wild-type
