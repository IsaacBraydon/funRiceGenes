OsMST8	transporter	Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice	Expression of rice anther specific monosaccharide transporter (OsMST8) is greatly affected by chilling treatment
OsMST8	chilling	Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice	 Expression of rice anther specific monosaccharide transporter (OsMST8) is greatly affected by chilling treatment
OsMST8	chilling	Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice	Perturbed carbohydrate metabolism, which is particularly triggered by repressed genes OsINV4 and OsMST8 during chilling, causes unusual starch storage in the endothecium and this also contributes to other symptoms such as vacuolation and poor microspore wall formation
