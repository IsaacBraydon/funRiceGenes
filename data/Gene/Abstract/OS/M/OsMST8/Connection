OSINV4	OsMST8	Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice	Perturbed carbohydrate metabolism, which is particularly triggered by repressed genes OsINV4 and OsMST8 during chilling, causes unusual starch storage in the endothecium and this also contributes to other symptoms such as vacuolation and poor microspore wall formation
CSA	OsMST8	Carbon starved anther encodes a MYB domain protein that regulates sugar partitioning required for rice pollen development	In addition, the expression of MST8, encoding a monosaccharide transporter, was greatly reduced in csa anthers
CSA	OsMST8	Carbon starved anther encodes a MYB domain protein that regulates sugar partitioning required for rice pollen development	Furthermore, CSA was found to be associated in vivo and in vitro with the promoter of MST8
