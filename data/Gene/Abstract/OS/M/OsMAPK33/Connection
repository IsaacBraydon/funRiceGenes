OsHOS1	OsMAPK33|OsMAPK3	OsMAPK3 Phosphorylates OsbHLH002/OsICE1 and Inhibits Its Ubiquitination to Activate OsTPP1 and Enhances Rice Chilling Tolerance.	 OsMAPK3 interacts with OsbHLH002 to prevent its ubiquitination by the E3 ligase OsHOS1
OsMAPK33|OsMAPK3	OsTPP1	OsMAPK3 Phosphorylates OsbHLH002/OsICE1 and Inhibits Its Ubiquitination to Activate OsTPP1 and Enhances Rice Chilling Tolerance.	OsMAPK3 Phosphorylates OsbHLH002/OsICE1 and Inhibits Its Ubiquitination to Activate OsTPP1 and Enhances Rice Chilling Tolerance.
OsMAPK33|OsMAPK3	OsTPP1	OsMAPK3 Phosphorylates OsbHLH002/OsICE1 and Inhibits Its Ubiquitination to Activate OsTPP1 and Enhances Rice Chilling Tolerance.	 Under chilling stress, active OsMAPK3 phosphorylates OsbHLH002, leading to accumulation of phospho-OsbHLH002, which promotes OsTPP1 expression and increases trehalose content and resistance to chilling damage
OsMAPK33|OsMAPK3	OsTPP1	OsMAPK3 Phosphorylates OsbHLH002/OsICE1 and Inhibits Its Ubiquitination to Activate OsTPP1 and Enhances Rice Chilling Tolerance.	<U+00A0>Taken together, these results indicate that OsbHLH002 is phosphorylated by OsMAPK3, which enhances OsbHLH002 activation to its target OsTPP1 during chilling stress
OsMAPK33|OsMAPK3	OsZFP213|PINE1|DEC1	A C2H2 zinc-finger protein OsZFP213 interacts with OsMAPK3 to enhance salt tolerance in rice.	A C2H2 zinc-finger protein OsZFP213 interacts with OsMAPK3 to enhance salt tolerance in rice.
OsMAPK33|OsMAPK3	OsZFP213|PINE1|DEC1	A C2H2 zinc-finger protein OsZFP213 interacts with OsMAPK3 to enhance salt tolerance in rice.	 Yeast two-hybrid, pull-down, and BiFC analysis showed that OsMAPK3 is a direct partner of OsZFP213, and this interaction enhanced the transactivation activity of OsZFP213
OsMAPK33|OsMAPK3	OsZFP213|PINE1|DEC1	A C2H2 zinc-finger protein OsZFP213 interacts with OsMAPK3 to enhance salt tolerance in rice.	 Taken together, these results suggest that OsZFP213 cooperates with OsMAPK3 in the regulation of rice salt stress tolerance by enhancing the ability of scavenging reactive oxygen
