OsMSP1|MSP1|OsTMS15	temperature	Low temperature compensates for defective tapetum initiation to restore the fertility of the novel TGMS line ostms15.	 We propose that the recovered protein interaction together with slow development under low temperature compensates for the defective tapetum initiation, which further restores ostms15 fertility
OsMSP1|MSP1|OsTMS15	development	Low temperature compensates for defective tapetum initiation to restore the fertility of the novel TGMS line ostms15.	 OsTMS15 encodes an LRR-RLK protein MULTIPLE SPOROCYTE1 (MSP1) which was reported to interact with its ligand to initiate tapetum development for pollen formation

We propose that the recovered protein interaction together with slow development under low temperature compensates for the defective tapetum initiation, which further restores ostms15 fertility
OsMSP1|MSP1|OsTMS15	fertility	Low temperature compensates for defective tapetum initiation to restore the fertility of the novel TGMS line ostms15.	 We propose that the recovered protein interaction together with slow development under low temperature compensates for the defective tapetum initiation, which further restores ostms15 fertility
OsMSP1|MSP1|OsTMS15	pollen	Low temperature compensates for defective tapetum initiation to restore the fertility of the novel TGMS line ostms15.	 OsTMS15 encodes an LRR-RLK protein MULTIPLE SPOROCYTE1 (MSP1) which was reported to interact with its ligand to initiate tapetum development for pollen formation
OsMSP1|MSP1|OsTMS15	tapetum	Low temperature compensates for defective tapetum initiation to restore the fertility of the novel TGMS line ostms15.	 OsTMS15 encodes an LRR-RLK protein MULTIPLE SPOROCYTE1 (MSP1) which was reported to interact with its ligand to initiate tapetum development for pollen formation
