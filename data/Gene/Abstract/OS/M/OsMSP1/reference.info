Tapetum development and meiosis play crucial roles in anther development. Here we identified a rice gene, DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1), which controls the early stages of that development. This gene encodes for an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein that is present only in cereals. Our T-DNA insertion mutations gave rise to abnormal tapetal formation. Cellular organelles, especially the ER, were underdeveloped, which led to hampered differentiation and degeneration of the tapetum. In addition, the development of pollen mother cells was arrested at the early stages of meiotic prophase I. RNA in-situ hybridization analyses showed that DTM1 transcripts were most abundant in tapetal cells at stages 6 and 7, and moderately in the pollen mother cells and meiocytes. Transcripts of UDT1, which functions in tapetum development during early meiosis, were reduced in dtm1 anthers, as were those of PAIR1, which is involved in chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis. However, expression of MSP1 and MEL1, which function in anther wall specification and germ cell division, respectively, was not altered in the dtm1 mutant. Moreover, transcripts of DTM1 were reduced in msp1 mutant anthers, but not in udt1 and pair1 mutants. These results, together with their mutant phenotypes, suggest that DTM1 plays important roles in the ER membrane during early tapetum development, functioning after MSP1 and before UDT1, and also in meiocyte development, after MEL1 and before PAIR1.
PC15081728.pdf	The MSP1 Gene Is Necessary to Restrict the Number of Cells Entering into Male and Female Sporogenesis and to Initiate Anther Wall Formation in Rice	2003	The Plant Cell Online	Experimental Farm/Plant Genetics Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, Yata1111, Mishima, Shizuoka 411-8540, Japan. 	The function of the novel gene MSP1 (MULTIPLE SPOROCYTE), which controls early sporogenic development, was elucidated by characterizing a retrotransposon-tagged mutation of rice. The MSP1 gene encoded a Leu-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase. The msp1 mutation gave rise to an excessive number of both male and female sporocytes. In addition, the formation of anther wall layers was disordered and the tapetum layer was lost completely. Although the mutation never affected homologous chromosome pairing and chiasma maintenance, the development of pollen mother cells was arrested at various stages of meiotic prophase I, which resulted in complete male sterility. Meanwhile, plural megaspore mother cells in a mutant ovule generated several megaspores, underwent gametogenesis, and produced germinable seeds when fertilized with wild-type pollen despite disorganized female gametophytes. In situ expression of MSP1 was detected in surrounding cells of male and female sporocytes and some flower tissues, but never in the sporocytes themselves. These results suggest that the MSP1 product plays crucial roles in restricting the number of cells entering into male and female sporogenesis and in initiating anther wall formation in rice.
NA	Reproductive cells and peripheral parietal cells collaboratively participate in meiotic fate acquisition in rice anthers	2021	Plant Journal	State Key Lab of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101 China	In flowering plants, the transition from mitosis to meiosis is the precondition for gametogenesis, which is the most crucial event during sexual reproduction. Here, we report an intriguing mechanism whereby germ cells and surrounding somatic cells cooperatively involve in the meiotic switch during anther development in rice (Oryza sativa). In double mutants with loss function of both leptotene chromosome establishment- and somatic cell layer differentiation-associated genes, chromosome morphology in the reproductive cells remains the same as that in somatic cells, and sporogenous cells fail to differentiate into pollen mother cells. OsSPOROCYTELESS and MICROSPORELESS1, two pivotal genes involved in meiosis entry, are prominently downregulated in anthers of plants with mutations in both MULTIPLE SPOROCYTE1 and LEPTOTENE 1. In addition, the transcription of redox-related genes is also affected. Therefore, germ cells and the surrounding somatic cells collaboratively participate in meiosis initiation in rice.
