Plant Cell Physiol-2007-Mimida-648-54.pdf	Two alternatively spliced transcripts generated from OsMUS81, a rice homolog of yeast MUS81, are up-regulated by DNA-damaging treatments	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, 305-8602 Japan.	OsMUS81, a rice homolog of the yeast MUS81 endonuclease gene, produced two alternative transcripts, OsMUS81alpha and OsMUS81beta. OsMus81alpha contained a Helix-hairpin-Helix (HhH) motif at the N- and C-termini, and a conserved XPF-like motif in the center, while the OsMus81beta isoform lacked the second HhH motif by alternative splicing of a cryptic intron generating a truncated protein. The two transcripts were induced after DNA-damaging treatments such as high intensity light, UV-C and gamma-radiation. The yeast two-hybrid assay detected a strong interaction between OsMus81 and OsRad54 recombinational repair proteins. These findings suggest that OsMus81 functions in maintaining genome integrity through homologous recombination.
NA	MUS81 is required for atypical recombination intermediate resolution but not crossover designation in rice.	2022	New Phytol	Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Yangzhou University, 225009, Yangzhou, China.	The endonuclease methyl methanesulfonate and UV-sensitive protein 81 (MUS81) has been reported to participate in DNA repair during mitosis and meiosis. However, the exact meiotic function of MUS81 in rice remains unclear. Here, we use a combination of physiological, cytological, and genetic approaches to provide evidence that MUS81 functions in atypical recombination intermediate resolution rather than crossover designation in rice. Cytological and genetic analysis revealed that the total chiasma numbers in mus81 mutants were indistinguishable from wild-type. The numbers of HEI10 foci (the sites of interference-sensitive crossovers) in mus81 were also similar to that of wild-type. Moreover, disruption of MUS81 in msh5 or msh4 msh5 background did not further decrease chiasmata frequency, suggesting that rice MUS81 did not function in crossover designation. Mutation of FANCM and ZEP1 could enhance recombination frequency. Unexpectedly, chromosome fragments and bridges were frequently observed in mus81 zep1 and mus81 fancm, illustrating that MUS81 may resolve atypical recombination intermediates. Taken together, our data suggest that MUS81 contributes little to crossover designation but plays a crucial role in the resolution of atypical meiotic intermediates by working together with other anti-crossover factors.
