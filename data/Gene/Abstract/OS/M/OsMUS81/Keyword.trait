OsMUS81	DNA damaging	Two alternatively spliced transcripts generated from OsMUS81, a rice homolog of yeast MUS81, are up-regulated by DNA-damaging treatments.	Two alternatively spliced transcripts generated from OsMUS81, a rice homolog of yeast MUS81, are up-regulated by DNA-damaging treatments.
OsMUS81	homologous recombination	Two alternatively spliced transcripts generated from OsMUS81, a rice homolog of yeast MUS81, are up-regulated by DNA-damaging treatments.	These findings suggest that OsMus81 functions in maintaining genome integrity through homologous recombination.
OsMUS81	recombination	MUS81 is required for atypical recombination intermediate resolution but not crossover designation in rice	MUS81 is required for atypical recombination intermediate resolution but not crossover designation in rice
