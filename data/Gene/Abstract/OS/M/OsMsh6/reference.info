NA	Specific-Locus Amplified Fragment Sequencing Reveals Spontaneous Single-Nucleotide Mutations in Rice OsMsh6 Mutants.	2017	Biomed Res Int	Institute of Nuclear-Agricultural Sciences/Key Laboratory of Chinese Ministry of Agriculture for Nuclear-Agricultural Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310029, China.	Genomic stability depends in part on an efficient DNA lesion recognition and correction by the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. We investigated mutations arising spontaneously in rice OsMsh6 mutants by specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing. Totally 994 single-nucleotide mutations were identified in three mutants and on average the mutation density is about 1/136.72<U+2009>Kb per mutant line. These mutations were relatively randomly distributed in genome and might be accumulated in generation-dependent manner. All possible base transitions and base transversions could be seen and the ratio of transitions to transversions was about 3.12. We also observed the nearest-neighbor bias around the mutated base. Our data suggests that OsMsh6 (LOC_Os09g24220) is important in ensuring genome stability by recognizing mismatches that arise spontaneously and provides useful information for investigating the function of the OsMsh6 gene in DNA repair and exploiting MMR mutants in rice induced mutation breeding.
NA	Effects of OsMSH6 Mutations on Microsatellite Stability and Homeologous Recombination in Rice.	2020	Front Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Chinese Ministry of Agriculture for Nuclear-Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Nuclear-Agricultural Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system is important for maintaining DNA replication fidelity and genome stability by repairing erroneous deletions, insertions and mis-incorporation of bases. With the aim of deciphering the role of the MMR system in genome stability and recombination in rice, we investigated the function of OsMSH6 gene, an import component of the MMR system. To achieve this goal, homeologous recombination and endogenous microsatellite stability were evaluated by using rice mutants carrying a Tos17 insertion into the OsMSH6 gene. Totally 60 microsatellites were analyzed and 15 distributed on chromosome 3, 6, 8, and 10 showed instability in three OsMSH6 mutants, D6011, NF7784 and NF9010, compared with the wild type MSH6WT (the control). The disruption of OsMSH6 gene is associated with modest increases in homeologous recombination, ranging from 2.0% to 32.5% on chromosome 1, 3, 9, and 10 in the BCF2 populations of the mutant ND6011 and NF9010. Our results suggest that the OsMSH6 plays an important role in ensuring genome stability and genetic recombination, providing the first evidence for the MSH6 gene in maintaining microsatellite stability and restricting homeologous recombination in plants.
