OsMsh6	breeding	Specific-Locus Amplified Fragment Sequencing Reveals Spontaneous Single-Nucleotide Mutations in Rice OsMsh6 Mutants.	 Our data suggests that OsMsh6 (LOC_Os09g24220) is important in ensuring genome stability by recognizing mismatches that arise spontaneously and provides useful information for investigating the function of the OsMsh6 gene in DNA repair and exploiting MMR mutants in rice induced mutation breeding
