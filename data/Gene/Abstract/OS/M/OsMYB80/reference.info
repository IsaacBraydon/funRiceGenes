The Arabidopsis AtMYB80 transcription factor (formerly AtMYB103) regulate genes essential for tapetal and pollen development. One of these genes, coding for an aspartic protease (UNDEAD), may control the timing of tapetal programmed cell death (PCD). In crop plants such as rice and wheat, abiotic stresses lead to abnormal tapetal development resulting in delayed PCD. Manipulation of AtMYB80 function has been used to develop a reversible male sterility system applicable to hybrid crop production. MYB80 homologs were cloned from wheat, rice, canola and cotton. The promoters of the homologs drove temporal and spatial expression patterns of the GUS reporter gene in the tapetum and microspores of Arabidopsis anthers identical to the AtMYB80 promoter. A short region is conserved in all five MYB80 promoters. The MYB80 homolog genes, driven by the AtMYB80 or their respective promoters, rescued the atmyb80 mutant, completely restoring male fertility. The canola MYB80 was fused to the EAR (ERF-associated amphiphilic repression) repressor and canola plants transgenic for the construct exhibited premature tapetal degradation and subsequent pollen abortion. The five MYB80 homologs all shared a 44 amino acid sequence immediately adjacent to the R2R3 domain which appears to be necessary for MYB80 function.
NA	MYB80 homologues in Arabidopsis, cotton and Brassica: regulation and functional conservation in tapetal and pollen development	2014	BMC Plant Biol		BackgroundThe Arabidopsis AtMYB80 transcription factor regulates genes involved in pollen development and controls the timing of tapetal programmed cell death (PCD). Downregulation of AtMYB80 expression precedes tapetal degradation. Inhibition of AtMYB80 expression results in complete male sterility. Full-length AtMYB80 homologs have been isolated in wheat, rice, barley and canola (C genome).ResultsThe complete sequences of MYB80 genes from the Brassica. napus (A gene), B. juncea (A gene), B. oleracea (C gene) and the two orthologs from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) were determined. The deduced amino acid sequences possess a highly conserved MYB domain, 44-amino acid region and 18-amino acid C-terminal sequence. The cotton MYB80 protein can fully restore fertility of the atmyb80 mutant, while removal of the 44 amino acid sequence abolishes its function. Two conserved MYB cis-elements in the AtMYB80 promoter are required for downregulation of MYB80 expression in anthers, apparently via negative auto-regulation. In cotton, tapetal degradation occurs at a slightly earlier stage of anther development than in Arabidopsis, consistent with an earlier increase and subsequent downregulation in GhMYB80 expression. The MYB80 homologs fused with the EAR repressor motif have been shown to induce male sterility in Arabidopsis. Constructs were designed to maximize the level of male sterility.Conclusions MYB80 genes are conserved in structure and function in all monocot and dicot species so far examined. Expression patterns of MYB80 in these species are also highly similar. The reversible male sterility system developed in Arabidopsis by manipulating MYB80 expression should be applicable to all major crops.
NA	OsMYB80 regulates anther development and pollen fertility by targeting multiple biological pathways.	2020	Plant Cell Physiol	Guangdong Key Lab of Biotechnology for Plant Development, School of Life Sciences, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China.	Pollen development is critical to the reproductive success of flowering plants, but how it is regulated is not well understood. Here we isolated two allelic male sterile mutants of OsMYB80 and investigated how OsMYB80 regulates male fertility in rice. OsMYB80 was barely expressed in tissues other than anthers, where it initiated the expression during meiosis, reached the peak at the tetrad-releasing stage, and then quickly declined afterwards. The osmyb80 mutants exhibited premature tapetum cell death, lack of Ubisch bodies, no exine, and microspore degeneration. To understand how OsMYB80 regulates anther development, RNA-seq analysis was conducted to identify genes differentially regulated by OsMYB80 in rice anthers. In addition, DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq) analysis was performed to identify DNA fragments interacting with OsMYB80 in vitro. Overlap of the genes identified by RNA-seq and DAP-seq revealed 188 genes that were differentially regulated by OsMYB80 and also carried an OsMYB80-interacting DNA element in the promoter. Ten of these promoter elements were randomly selected for gel shift assay and yeast one-hybrid assay, and all showed OsMYB80-binding. The ten promoters also showed OsMYB80-dependent induction when co-expressed in rice protoplast. Functional annotation of the 188 genes suggested that OsMYB80 regulates male fertility by directly targeting multiple biological processes. The identification of these genes significantly enriched the gene networks governing anther development and provided much new information for understanding of pollen development and male fertility.
NA	The MYB transcription factor Baymax1 plays a critical role in rice male fertility	2020	Theor Appl Genet	Key Laboratory for Zhejiang Super Rice Research and State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 311400, China.	Rice male fertility gene Baymax1, isolated through map-based cloning, encodes a MYB transcription factor and is essential for rice tapetum and microspore development.Abstract The mining and characterization of male fertility gene will provide theoretical and material basis for future rice production. In Arabidopsis, the development of male organ (namely anther), usually involves the coordination between MYB (v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog) and bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) members. However, the role of MYB proteins in rice anther development remains poorly understood. In this study, we isolated and characterized a male sterile mutant (with normal vegetative growth) of Baymax1 (BM1), which encodes a MYB protein. The bm1 mutant exhibited slightly lagging meiosis, aborted transition of the tapetum to a secretory type, premature tapetal degeneration, and abnormal pollen exine formation, leading to ultimately lacks of visible pollens in the mature white anthers. Map-based cloning, complementation and targeted mutagenesis using CRISPR/Cas9 technology demonstrated that the mutated LOC_Os04g39470 is the causal gene in bm1. BM1 is preferentially expressed in rice anthers from stage 5 to stage 10. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that rice BM1 and its homologs in millet, maize, rape, cabbage, and pigeonpea are evolutionarily conserved. BM1 can physically interacts with bHLH protein TIP2, EAT1, and PHD (plant homeodomain)-finger member TIP3, respectively. Moreover, BM1 affects the expression of several known genes related to tapetum and microspore development. Collectively, our results suggest that BM1 is one of key regulators for rice male fertility and may serve as a potential target for rice male-sterile line breeding and hybrid seed production.
