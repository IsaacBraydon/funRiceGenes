OsMYB80|BM1|OsMS188	 OsMYB80 was barely expressed in tissues other than anthers, where it initiated the expression during meiosis, reached the peak at the tetrad-releasing stage, and then quickly declined afterwards
OsMYB80|BM1|OsMS188	 Moreover, BM1 affects the expression of several known genes related to tapetum and microspore development
OsMYB80|BM1|OsMS188	 Further biochemical assays demonstrated that OsMS188 binds directly to the promoters of these genes to regulate their expression |  Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and activation assays revealed that TDR directly regulates OsMS188 expression |  Additionally, protein interaction assays indicated that TDR interacts with OsMS188 to regulate downstream gene expression
