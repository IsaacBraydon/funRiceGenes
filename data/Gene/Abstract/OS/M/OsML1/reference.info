NA	Genetic Architecture and Candidate Genes for Deep-Sowing Tolerance in Rice Revealed by Non-syn GWAS.	2018	Front Plant Sci	Key Lab of Crop Heterosis and Utilization of Ministry of Education and Beijing Key Lab of Crop Genetic Improvement, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.	Dry direct-seeding of rice is rapidly increasing in China, but variable planting depth associated with machine sowing can lead to low seedling emergence rates. Phenotype analysis of 621 rice accessions showed that mesocotyl length (ML) was induced by deep soil covering and was important in deep-sowing tolerance in the field. Here, we performed and compared GWAS using three types of SNPs (non-synonymous SNP, non-synonymous SNPs and SNPs within promoters and 3 million randomly selected SNPs from the entire set of SNPs) and found that Non-Syn GWAS (GWAS using non-synonyomous SNP) decreased computation time and eliminated confounding by other loci relative to GWAS using randomly selected SNPs. Thirteen QTLs were finally detected, and two new major-effect genes, namedOsML1andOsML2, were identified by an integrated analysis. There were 2 and 7 non-synonymous SNPs inOsML1andOsML2, respectively, from which 3 and 4 haplotypes were detected in cultivated rice. Combinations of superior haplotypes ofOsML1andOsML2increased ML by up to 4 cm, representing high emergence rate (85%) in the field with 10 cm of soil cover. The studies provide key loci and naturally occurring alleles of ML that can be used in improving tolerance to dry direct-seeding.
NA	Natural variation of OsML1, a mitochondrial transcription termination factor, contributes to mesocotyl length variation in rice.	2023	Plant J	Sanya Nanfan Research Institute of Hainan University, Hainan University, Sanya, 572025, China.	Mesocotyl length (ML) is a crucial factor in determining the establishment and yield of rice planted through dry direct seeding, a practice that is increasingly popular in rice production worldwide. ML is determined by the endogenous and external environments, and inherits as a complex trait. To date, only a few genes have been cloned, and the mechanisms underlying mesocotyl elongation remain largely unknown. Here, through a genome-wide association study using sequenced germplasm, we reveal that natural allelic variations in a mitochondrial transcription termination factor, OsML1, predominantly determined the natural variation of ML in rice. Natural variants in the coding regions of OsML1 resulted in five major haplotypes with a clear differentiation between subspecies and subpopulations in cultivated rice. The much-reduced genetic diversity of cultivated rice compared to the common wild rice suggested that OsML1 underwent selection during domestication. Transgenic experiments and molecular analysis demonstrated that OsML1 contributes to ML by influencing cell elongation primarily determined by H(2) O(2) homeostasis. Overexpression of OsML1 promoted mesocotyl elongation and thus improved the emergence rate under deep direct seeding. Taken together, our results suggested that OsML1 is a key positive regulator of ML, and is useful in developing varieties for deep direct seeding by conventional and transgenic approaches.
