OsML1	domestication	Natural variation of OsML1, a mitochondrial transcription termination factor, contributes to mesocotyl length variation in rice.	 The much-reduced genetic diversity of cultivated rice compared to the common wild rice suggested that OsML1 underwent selection during domestication
OsML1	homeostasis	Natural variation of OsML1, a mitochondrial transcription termination factor, contributes to mesocotyl length variation in rice.	 Transgenic experiments and molecular analysis demonstrated that OsML1 contributes to ML by influencing cell elongation primarily determined by H(2) O(2) homeostasis
OsML1	cell elongation	Natural variation of OsML1, a mitochondrial transcription termination factor, contributes to mesocotyl length variation in rice.
