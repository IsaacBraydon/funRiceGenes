OsABA1|OSZEP1	OsNCED2	ABA regulates apoplastic sugar transport and is a potential signal for cold-induced pollen sterility in rice	The differences in endogenous ABA levels in Doongara and R31 correlated with differences in expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes encoding zeaxanthin epoxidase (OSZEP1) and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (OSNCED2, OSNCED3) in anthers
OsABA1|OSZEP1	OsNCED3	ABA regulates apoplastic sugar transport and is a potential signal for cold-induced pollen sterility in rice	The differences in endogenous ABA levels in Doongara and R31 correlated with differences in expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes encoding zeaxanthin epoxidase (OSZEP1) and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (OSNCED2, OSNCED3) in anthers
OsABA1|OSZEP1	OsTATC	Screening of the rice viviparous mutants generated by endogenous retrotransposon Tos17 insertion. Tagging of a zeaxanthin epoxidase gene and a novel ostatc gene	Deduced amino acids of the causative genes of Osaba1 and Ostatc manifested a significantly high homology with zeaxanthin epoxidase isolated from other plant species and with bacterial Sec-independent translocase TATC protein, respectively
OsABA1|OSZEP1	OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	A Rice NAC Transcription Factor Promotes Leaf Senescence via ABA Biosynthesis.	 Moreover, ectopic expression of OsNAC2 leads to an increase in ABA levels via directly upregulating expression of ABA biosynthetic genes (OsNCED3 and OsZEP1) as well as downregulating the ABA catabolic gene (OsABA8ox1)
OsABA1|OSZEP1	OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsNAC2 Is Involved in Multiple Hormonal Pathways to Mediate Germination of Rice Seeds and Establishment of Seedling	 Moreover, OsNAC2 delays the germination of seeds and coleoptile growth through the ABA pathway instead of the ethylene and GA pathway, by targeting the promoters of OsNCED3, OsZEP1, and OsABA8ox1
miR162b	OsABA1|OSZEP1	Identification and Characterization of ABA-Responsive MicroRNAs in Rice.	 Among them, miR1425-5P, miR169a, miR169n, miR390-5P, miR397a and miR397b were up-regulated, but miR162b reduced in expression in Osaba1
