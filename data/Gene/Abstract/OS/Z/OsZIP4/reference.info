Ishimaru-2005-OsZIP4, a novel zinc.pdf	OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice	2005	J Exp Bot	Department of Global Agricultural Sciences, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Science, University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Zinc (Zn) is an essential element for the normal growth of plants but information is scarce on the mechanisms whereby Zn is transported in rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants. Four distinct genes, OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP6, and OsZIP7 that exhibit sequence similarity to the rice ferrous ion transporter, OsIRT1, were isolated. Microarray and northern blot analysis revealed that OsZIP4 was highly expressed under conditions of Zn deficiency in roots and shoots. Real-time-PCR revealed that the OsZIP4 transcripts were more abundant than those of OsZIP1 or OsZIP3 in Zn-deficient roots and shoots. OsZIP4 complemented a Zn-uptake-deficient yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant, Deltazrt1,Deltazrt2, indicating that OsZIP4 is a functional transporter of Zn. OsZIP4-synthetic green fluorescent protein (sGFP) fusion protein was transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells localized to the plasma membrane. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that OsZIP4 in Zn-deficient rice was expressed in shoots and roots, especially in phloem cells. Furthermore, OsZIP4 transcripts were detected in the meristem of Zn-deficient roots and shoots. These results suggested that OsZIP4 is a Zn transporter that may be responsible for the translocation of Zn within rice plants.
J. Exp. Bot.-2007-Ishimaru-2909-15.pdf	Overexpression of the OsZIP4 zinc transporter confers disarrangement of zinc distribution in rice plants	2007	J Exp Bot	Department of Global Agricultural Sciences, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657 Japan.	Zinc (Zn), an essential nutrient in cells, plays a vital role in controlling cellular processes such as growth, development, and differentiation. Although the mechanisms of Zn translocation in rice plants (Oryza sativa) are not fully understood, it has recently received increased interest. OsZIP4 is a Zn transporter that localizes to apical cells. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the OsZIP4 gene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter were produced. The Zn concentration in roots of 35S-OsZIP4 transgenic plants was 10 times higher than in those of vector controls, but it was five times lower in shoots. The Zn concentration in seeds of 35S-OsZIP4 plants was four times lower compared with vector controls. Northern blot analysis and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR revealed transcripts of OsZIP4 expression driven by the CaMV 35S promoter in roots and shoots of 35S-OsZIP4 plants, but levels of endogenous OsZIP4 transcripts were low in roots and high in shoots compared with vector controls. Microarray analysis revealed that the genes expressed in shoots of 35S-OsZIP4 plants coincided with those induced in shoots of Zn-deficient plants. These results indicate that constitutive expression of OsZIP4 changes the Zn distribution within rice plants, and that OsZIP4 is a critical Zn transporter that must be strictly regulated.
NA	A transporter for delivering zinc to the developing tiller bud and panicle in rice	2020	Plant Journal	College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Tiller number is one of the most important agronomic traits that determine rice (Oryza sativa) yield. Active growth of tiller bud (TB) requires high amount of mineral nutrients, however, the mechanism underlying the distribution of mineral nutrients to TB with low transpiration is unknown. Here, we found that the distribution of zinc (Zn) to TB is mediated by OsZIP4; one of the ZIP (ZRT, IRT-like protein) family member. The expression of OsZIP4 was highly detected in TB and nodes, and was induced by Zn deficiency. Immunostaining analysis revealed that OsZIP4 was mainly expressed in phloem of diffuse vascular bundles (DVBs) in the nodes and the axillary meristem. Mutation of OsZIP4 did not affect the total Zn uptake, but altered Zn distribution; less Zn was delivered to TB and new leaf, but more Zn was retained in the basal stems at the vegetative growth stage. Bioimaging analysis showed that the mutant aberrantly accumulated Zn in enlarged and transit vascular bundles of the basal node, whereas in wild type high accumulation of Zn was observed in the meristem part. At the reproductive stage, mutation of OsZIP4 resulted in delayed panicles development, which is associated with decreased Zn distribution to the panicles. Collectively, OsZIP4 is involved in transporting Zn to the phloem of DVBs in the nodes for subsequent distribution to TBs and other developing tissues. It also plays a role in transporting Zn to meristem cells in the TBs.
NA	Comparative transcriptome profile analysis of rice varieties with different tolerance to zinc deficiency	2020	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	CAAS-IRRI Joint Laboratory for Genomics-Assisted Germplasm Enhancement, Agricultural Genomics Institute in Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, China.	Zinc (Zn) is an indispensable element for rice growth. Zn deficiency results in brown blotches and streaks 2-3 weeks after transplanting, as well as stunting, reduced tillering, and low productivity of rice plants. These processes are controlled by different families of expressed genes. A comparative transcriptome profile analysis was conducted using the roots of two Zn deficiency tolerant varieties (UCP122 and KALIBORO26) and two sensitive varieties (IR26 and IR64) by merging data from untreated control (CK) and Zn deficiency treated samples. Results revealed a total of 4,688 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the normal Zn and deficient conditions, with 2,702 and 1,489 unique DEGs upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis identified transcription factors (TFs), such as WRKY, MYB, ERF, and bHLH which are important in the regulation of the Zn deficiency response. Furthermore, chitinases, jasmonic acid, and phenylpropanoid pathways were found to be important in the Zn deficiency response. The metal tolerance protein (MTP) genes also appeared to play an important role in conferring tolerance to Zn deficiency. A heavy metal-associated domain-containing protein 7 was associated with tolerance to Zn deficiency and negatively regulated downstream genes. Collectively, our findings provide valuable expression patterns and candidate genes for the study of molecular mechanisms underlying the response to Zn deficiency and for improvements in breeding for tolerance to Zn deficiency in rice.
