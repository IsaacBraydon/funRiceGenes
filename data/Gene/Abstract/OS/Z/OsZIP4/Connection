OsZIP4	OsZIP5	OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice	Four distinct genes, OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP6, and OsZIP7 that exhibit sequence similarity to the rice ferrous ion transporter, OsIRT1, were isolated
OsIRT1	OsZIP4	OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice	Four distinct genes, OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP6, and OsZIP7 that exhibit sequence similarity to the rice ferrous ion transporter, OsIRT1, were isolated
OsDMC1|DMC1B|OsDMC1B	OsZIP4	OsDMC1 is not required for homologous pairing in rice meiosis.	Moreover, OsDMC1 was not detected in pairing-defective mutants, such as pair2, pair3, Oscom1 and Osrad51c, while it was loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in zep1, Osmer3, Oszip4 and Oshei10
OsRAD17	OsZIP4	OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.	OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.
OsRAD17	OsZIP4	OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.	 We found that homologous pairing and synapsis, which was roughly unaffected in Oszip4 and Osrad17 single mutant, was severely disturbed in the Oszip4 Osrad17 double mutant
OsZIP4	qCdT7|OsHMA3	A tonoplast-localized OsHMA3 plays an important role in maintaining Zn homeostasis in rice.	 Higher expression levels of OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP8 and OsZIP10 were found in the roots of accessions with functional OsHMA3 than those of accessions with non-functional OsHMA3 in response to Zn-deficiency
HEIP1|OsAGG1	OsZIP4	The plant-specific gene ABERRANT GAMETOGENESIS 1 is essential for meiosis in rice.	 Moreover, OsAGG1 was found to interact with ZMM proteins OsHEI10, OsZIP4 and OsMSH5
OsZIP4	ZN	A transporter for delivering zinc to the developing tiller bud and panicle in rice	 The expression of OsZIP4 was highly detected in TB and nodes, and was induced by Zn deficiency
OsZIP4	ZN	A transporter for delivering zinc to the developing tiller bud and panicle in rice	 Mutation of OsZIP4 did not affect the total Zn uptake, but altered Zn distribution; less Zn was delivered to TB and new leaf, but more Zn was retained in the basal stems at the vegetative growth stage
OsZIP4	ZN	A transporter for delivering zinc to the developing tiller bud and panicle in rice	 At the reproductive stage, mutation of OsZIP4 resulted in delayed panicles development, which is associated with decreased Zn distribution to the panicles
OsZIP4	ZN	A transporter for delivering zinc to the developing tiller bud and panicle in rice	 Collectively, OsZIP4 is involved in transporting Zn to the phloem of DVBs in the nodes for subsequent distribution to TBs and other developing tissues
