OsZIP4	OsZIP5	OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice	Four distinct genes, OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP6, and OsZIP7 that exhibit sequence similarity to the rice ferrous ion transporter, OsIRT1, were isolated
OsIRT1	OsZIP4	OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice	Four distinct genes, OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP6, and OsZIP7 that exhibit sequence similarity to the rice ferrous ion transporter, OsIRT1, were isolated
OsDMC1|DMC1B	OsZIP4	OsDMC1 is not required for homologous pairing in rice meiosis.	Moreover, OsDMC1 was not detected in pairing-defective mutants, such as pair2, pair3, Oscom1 and Osrad51c, while it was loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in zep1, Osmer3, Oszip4 and Oshei10
