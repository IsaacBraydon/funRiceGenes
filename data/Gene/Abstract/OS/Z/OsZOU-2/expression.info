OsZOU-2	 The results of this study show that rice genomes contain two most closely related homologs ofAtZOU,OsZOU-1andOsZOU-2; of these,OsZOU-1expression is limited to within the endosperm where it can be detected throughout this structure 5 days after pollination (DAP) |  Heterologous expression ofOsZOU-1andOsZOU-2inAtzou-4mutants also revealed thatOsZOU-1partially complements the seed phenotypes of these individuals, while its counterpart,OsZOU-2, was unable to recover these phenotypes
