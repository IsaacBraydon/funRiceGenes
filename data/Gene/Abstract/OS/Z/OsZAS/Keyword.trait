OsZAS	plant growth	Zaxinone synthase controls arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization level in rice.	The Oryza sativa (rice) carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase OsZAS was described to produce zaxinone, a plant growth-promoting apocarotenoid
OsZAS	AM symbiosis	Zaxinone synthase controls arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization level in rice.	 Overall, our results show that the genetic manipulation of OsZAS activity in planta leads to a different effect on AM symbiosis from that of exogenous zaxinone treatment, and demonstrate that OsZAS influences the extent of AM colonization, acting as a component of a regulatory network that involves SLs

OsZAS	AM colonization	Zaxinone synthase controls arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization level in rice.	 Moreover, exogenous treatment with the synthetic SL analog GR24 rescued the zas mutant mycorrhizal phenotype, indicating that the lower AM colonization rate of zas is caused by a deficiency in SLs at the early stages of the interaction, and indicating that during this phase OsZAS activity is required to induce SL production, possibly mediated by the Dwarf14-Like (D14L) signaling pathway
