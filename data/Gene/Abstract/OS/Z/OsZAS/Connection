D14L	OsZAS	Zaxinone synthase controls arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization level in rice.	 Moreover, exogenous treatment with the synthetic SL analog GR24 rescued the zas mutant mycorrhizal phenotype, indicating that the lower AM colonization rate of zas is caused by a deficiency in SLs at the early stages of the interaction, and indicating that during this phase OsZAS activity is required to induce SL production, possibly mediated by the Dwarf14-Like (D14L) signaling pathway
OsPht1;11|OsPT11	OsZAS	Zaxinone synthase controls arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization level in rice.	 OsZAS is expressed in arbuscule-containing cells, and OsPT11prom::OsZAS transgenic lines, where OsZAS expression is driven by the OsPT11 promoter active in arbusculated cells, exhibit increased mycorrhization compared with the wild type
OsZAS	OsZAS1b	ZAXINONE SYNTHASE 2 regulates growth and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	 The rice genome encodes three OsZAS homologs, called here OsZAS1b, OsZAS1c, and OsZAS2, with unknown functions
