OsZFP	 Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the expression of certain Aux/IAA genes was altered in OsCYP2- and OsZFP-RNAi lines in response to IAA	 T2 OsZFP-RNAi lines had significantly fewer lateral roots than did wild type plants, which suggests a role for OsCYP2 and OsZFP in regulating lateral root development |  Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the expression of certain Aux/IAA genes was altered in OsCYP2- and OsZFP-RNAi lines in response to IAA |  More importantly, OsIAA11 showed functional redundancy not only in OsCYP2-RNAi lines but also in OsZFP-RNAi lines, which provides important clues for the elucidation of mechanisms controlling lateral root development in response to auxin
