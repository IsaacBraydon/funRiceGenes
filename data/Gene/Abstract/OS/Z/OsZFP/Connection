OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsZFP	A zinc finger protein, interacted with cyclophilin, affects root development via IAA pathway in rice.	 Yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down results confirmed that OsCYP2 interacted with a C2HC-type zinc finger protein (OsZFP, Os01g0252900) which is located in the rice nucleus
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsZFP	A zinc finger protein, interacted with cyclophilin, affects root development via IAA pathway in rice.	 T2 OsZFP-RNAi lines had significantly fewer lateral roots than did wild type plants, which suggests a role for OsCYP2 and OsZFP in regulating lateral root development
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsZFP	A zinc finger protein, interacted with cyclophilin, affects root development via IAA pathway in rice.	 These findings imply that OsCYP2 and OsZFP participate in IAA signal pathways controlling lateral root development
