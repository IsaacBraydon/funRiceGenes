OsZFP	root	A zinc finger protein, interacted with cyclophilin, affects root development via IAA pathway in rice.	 T2 OsZFP-RNAi lines had significantly fewer lateral roots than did wild type plants, which suggests a role for OsCYP2 and OsZFP in regulating lateral root development
OsZFP	root	A zinc finger protein, interacted with cyclophilin, affects root development via IAA pathway in rice.	 These findings imply that OsCYP2 and OsZFP participate in IAA signal pathways controlling lateral root development
