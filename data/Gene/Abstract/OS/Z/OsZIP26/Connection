LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC|OsFLA6	OsZIP26	The transcriptional hub SHORT INTERNODES1 integrates hormone signals to orchestrate rice growth and development.	 Furthermore, we demonstrated that three classes of transcription factors, AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 19 (OsARF19), LEAF AND TILLER ANGLE INCREASED CONTROLLER (LIC), OsZIP26 and OsZIP86, directly bind to the promoter of OsSHI1 and regulate its expression in response to auxin, BR and ABA, respectively
