Plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to coordinate their growth and stress responses via integrating various phytohormone signaling pathways. However, the precise molecular mechanisms orchestrating integration of the phytohormone signaling pathways remain largely obscure. In this study, we found that the rice (Oryza sativa) short internodes1 (shi1) mutant exhibits typical auxin-deficient root development and gravitropic response, brassinosteroid (BR)-deficient plant architecture and grain size as well as enhanced abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated drought tolerance. Additionally, we found that the shi1 mutant is also hyposensitive to auxin and BR treatment but hypersensitive to ABA. Further, we showed that OsSHI1 promotes the biosynthesis of auxin and BR by activating the expression of OsYUCCAs and D11, meanwhile dampens ABA signaling by inducing the expression of OsNAC2, which encodes a repressor of ABA signaling. Furthermore, we demonstrated that three classes of transcription factors, AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 19 (OsARF19), LEAF AND TILLER ANGLE INCREASED CONTROLLER (LIC), OsZIP26 and OsZIP86, directly bind to the promoter of OsSHI1 and regulate its expression in response to auxin, BR and ABA, respectively. Collectively, our results unravel an OsSHI1-centered transcriptional regulatory hub that orchestrates the integration and self-feedback regulation of multiple phytohormone signaling pathways to coordinate plant growth and stress adaptation.
