OsZOU-1|bHLH144	seed development	Identification of ZHOUPI Orthologs in Rice Involved in Endosperm Development and Cuticle Formation.	The over-expression of OsZOU-1 severely disrupts both seed development and plant growth in transgenic rice lines, as plants in which this gene has been knocked down failed in the separation of endosperm from embryo and cuticle formation during seed development.

OsZOU-1|bHLH144	endosperm development	Identification of ZHOUPI Orthologs in Rice Involved in Endosperm Development and Cuticle Formation.	The results of this study therefore suggest that OsZOU-1 is orthologous to the AtZOU, and regulates both endosperm development and cuticle formation in rice.
