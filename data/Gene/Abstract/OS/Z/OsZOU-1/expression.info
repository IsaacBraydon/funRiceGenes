OsZOU-1	 The results of this study show that rice genomes contain two most closely related homologs ofAtZOU,OsZOU-1andOsZOU-2; of these,OsZOU-1expression is limited to within the endosperm where it can be detected throughout this structure 5 days after pollination (DAP) |  Heterologous expression ofOsZOU-1andOsZOU-2inAtzou-4mutants also revealed thatOsZOU-1partially complements the seed phenotypes of these individuals, while its counterpart,OsZOU-2, was unable to recover these phenotypes |  The over-expression ofOsZOU-1severely disrupts both seed development and plant growth in transgenic rice lines, as plants in which this gene has been knocked down failed in the separation of endosperm from embryo and cuticle formation during seed development
