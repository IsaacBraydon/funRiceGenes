OsZIP5	transporter	OsZIP5 is a plasma membrane zinc transporter in rice	OsZIP5 is a plasma membrane zinc transporter in rice
OsZIP5	zinc	OsZIP5 is a plasma membrane zinc transporter in rice	OsZIP5 is a plasma membrane zinc transporter in rice
OsZIP5	transporter	OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice	Four distinct genes, OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP6, and OsZIP7 that exhibit sequence similarity to the rice ferrous ion transporter, OsIRT1, were isolated
OsZIP5	root	ZINC TRANSPORTER5 and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 function synergistically in zinc/cadmium uptake.	 The expression profiles of OsZIP5 and OsZIP9 overlap in the root epidermis and respond to the local Zn status in the root
OsZIP5	growth	ZINC TRANSPORTER5 and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 function synergistically in zinc/cadmium uptake.	 The decreased Zn/Cd levels and growth retardation in the oszip5 mutant are less severe than in the oszip9 mutant
OsZIP5	epidermis	ZINC TRANSPORTER5 and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 function synergistically in zinc/cadmium uptake.	 The expression profiles of OsZIP5 and OsZIP9 overlap in the root epidermis and respond to the local Zn status in the root
