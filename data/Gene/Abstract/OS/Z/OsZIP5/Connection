OsZIP4	OsZIP5	OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice	Four distinct genes, OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP6, and OsZIP7 that exhibit sequence similarity to the rice ferrous ion transporter, OsIRT1, were isolated
OsIRT1	OsZIP5	OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice	Four distinct genes, OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP6, and OsZIP7 that exhibit sequence similarity to the rice ferrous ion transporter, OsIRT1, were isolated
OsZIP5	qCdT7|OsHMA3	A tonoplast-localized OsHMA3 plays an important role in maintaining Zn homeostasis in rice.	 Higher expression levels of OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP8 and OsZIP10 were found in the roots of accessions with functional OsHMA3 than those of accessions with non-functional OsHMA3 in response to Zn-deficiency
