OsZIP4	OsZIP5	OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice	Four distinct genes, OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP6, and OsZIP7 that exhibit sequence similarity to the rice ferrous ion transporter, OsIRT1, were isolated
OsIRT1	OsZIP5	OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice	Four distinct genes, OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP6, and OsZIP7 that exhibit sequence similarity to the rice ferrous ion transporter, OsIRT1, were isolated
OsZIP5	qCdT7|OsHMA3	A tonoplast-localized OsHMA3 plays an important role in maintaining Zn homeostasis in rice.	 Higher expression levels of OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP8 and OsZIP10 were found in the roots of accessions with functional OsHMA3 than those of accessions with non-functional OsHMA3 in response to Zn-deficiency
OsZIP5	OsZIP9	ZINC TRANSPORTER5 and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 function synergistically in zinc/cadmium uptake.	 In this study, we functionally characterized two Zn transporter genes in rice (Oryza sativa), ZINC TRANSPORTER5 (OsZIP5) and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 (OsZIP9), which are tandem duplicates and act synergistically in Zn/Cd uptake
OsZIP5	OsZIP9	ZINC TRANSPORTER5 and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 function synergistically in zinc/cadmium uptake.	 The expression profiles of OsZIP5 and OsZIP9 overlap in the root epidermis and respond to the local Zn status in the root
OsZIP5	OsZIP9	ZINC TRANSPORTER5 and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 function synergistically in zinc/cadmium uptake.	 OsZIP5 functions redundantly to OsZIP9, but has a relatively weaker effect
OsZIP5	OsZIP9	ZINC TRANSPORTER5 and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 function synergistically in zinc/cadmium uptake.	 Plants with the knockout mutations oszip5, oszip9, or oszip5oszip9 show impaired Zn/Cd uptake
OsZIP5	OsZIP9	ZINC TRANSPORTER5 and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 function synergistically in zinc/cadmium uptake.	 The decreased Zn/Cd levels and growth retardation in the oszip5 mutant are less severe than in the oszip9 mutant
