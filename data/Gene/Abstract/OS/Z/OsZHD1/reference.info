Leaf rolling is receiving considerable attention as an important agronomic trait in rice (Oryza sativa L.). However, little has been known on the molecular mechanism of rice leaf rolling, especially the abaxial rolling. We identified a novel abaxially curled and drooping leaf-dominant mutant from a T(1) transgenic rice line. The abaxially curled leaf phenotypes, co-segregating with the inserted transferred DNA, were caused by overexpression of a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor (OsZHD1). OsZHD1 exhibited a constitutive expression pattern in wild-type plants and accumulated in the developing leaves and panicles. Artificial overexpression of OsZHD1 or its closest homolog OsZHD2 induced the abaxial leaf curling. Histological analysis indicated that both the increased number and the abnormal arrangement of bulliform cells in leaf were responsible for the abaxially curled leaves. We herein reported OsZHD1 with key roles in rice morphogenesis, especially in the modulating of leaf rolling, which provided a novel insight into the molecular mechanism of leaf development in rice.
NA	Homeobox transcription factors OsZHD1 and OsZHD2 induce inflorescence meristem activity at floral transition in rice.	2022	Plant Cell Environ	Department of Plant Bioscience,Â College of Natural Resources and Life Science, Pusan National University, Miryang, Republic of Korea.	Floral transition starts in the leaves when florigens respond to various environmental and developmental factors. Among several regulatory genes that are preferentially expressed in the inflorescence meristem during the floral transition, this study examines the homeobox genes OsZHD1 and OsZHD2 for their roles in regulating this transition. Although single mutations in these genes did not result in visible phenotype changes, double mutations in these genes delayed flowering. Florigen expression was not altered in the double mutants, indicating that the delay was due to a defect in florigen signaling. Morphological analysis of shoot apical meristem at the early developmental stage indicated that inflorescence meristem development was significantly delayed in the double mutants. Overexpression of ZHD2 causes early flowering because of downstream signals after the generation of florigens. Expression levels of the auxin biosynthesis genes were reduced in the mutants and the addition of indole-3-acetic acid recovered the defect in the mutants, suggesting that these homeobox genes play a role in auxin biosynthesis. A rice florigen, RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1, binds to the promoter regions of homeobox genes. These results indicate that florigens stimulate the expression of homeobox genes, enhancing inflorescence development in the shoot apex.
