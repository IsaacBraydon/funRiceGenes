OsZHD1	OsZHD2	Homeobox transcription factors OsZHD1 and OsZHD2 induce inflorescence meristem activity at floral transition in rice.	Homeobox transcription factors OsZHD1 and OsZHD2 induce inflorescence meristem activity at floral transition in rice.
OsZHD1	OsZHD2	Homeobox transcription factors OsZHD1 and OsZHD2 induce inflorescence meristem activity at floral transition in rice.	 Among several regulatory genes that are preferentially expressed in the inflorescence meristem during the floral transition, this study examines the homeobox genes OsZHD1 and OsZHD2 for their roles in regulating this transition
