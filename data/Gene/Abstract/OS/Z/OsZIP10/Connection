OsZIP10	OsZIP7a|OsZIP7	OsNAC15 Regulates Tolerance to Zinc Deficiency and Cadmium by Binding to OsZIP7 and OsZIP10 in Rice.	OsNAC15 Regulates Tolerance to Zinc Deficiency and Cadmium by Binding to OsZIP7 and OsZIP10 in Rice.
OsZIP10	OsZIP7a|OsZIP7	OsNAC15 Regulates Tolerance to Zinc Deficiency and Cadmium by Binding to OsZIP7 and OsZIP10 in Rice.	 The yeast one-hybrid assay, transient transcriptional activity assay using the dual-luciferase reporter system and electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that OsNAC15 directly binds to the zinc deficiency-responsive element motifs in the promoters of OsZIP7 and OsZIP10 to repress their transcriptions
