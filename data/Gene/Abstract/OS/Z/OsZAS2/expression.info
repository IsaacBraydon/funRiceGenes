OsZAS2	 Here, we investigated the enzymatic activity, expression pattern, and subcellular localization of OsZAS2 and generated and characterized loss-of-function CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and associated protein 9)-Oszas2 mutants |  Moreover, OsZAS2 expression increased during mycorrhization, specifically in arbuscule-containing cells |  Consistent with the OsZAS2 expression pattern, Oszas2 mutants displayed a lower frequency of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization
