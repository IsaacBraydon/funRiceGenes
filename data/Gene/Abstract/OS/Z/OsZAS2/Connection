OsZAS	OsZAS2	ZAXINONE SYNTHASE 2 regulates growth and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	 The rice genome encodes three OsZAS homologs, called here OsZAS1b, OsZAS1c, and OsZAS2, with unknown functions
OsZAS	OsZAS2	ZAXINONE SYNTHASE 2 regulates growth and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	 In conclusion, OsZAS2 is a zaxinone-forming enzyme that, similar to the previously reported OsZAS, determines rice growth, architecture, and SL content, and is required for optimal mycorrhization
