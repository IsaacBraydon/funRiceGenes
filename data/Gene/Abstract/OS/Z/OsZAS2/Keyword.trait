OsZAS2	root	ZAXINONE SYNTHASE 2 regulates growth and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	 Oszas2 mutants contained lower zaxinone content in roots and exhibited reduced root and shoot biomass, fewer tillers, and higher strigolactone (SL) levels
OsZAS2	growth	ZAXINONE SYNTHASE 2 regulates growth and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	 Exogenous zaxinone application repressed SL biosynthesis and partially rescued the growth retardation of the Oszas2 mutant
OsZAS2	shoot	ZAXINONE SYNTHASE 2 regulates growth and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	 Oszas2 mutants contained lower zaxinone content in roots and exhibited reduced root and shoot biomass, fewer tillers, and higher strigolactone (SL) levels
OsZAS2	strigolactone	ZAXINONE SYNTHASE 2 regulates growth and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	 Oszas2 mutants contained lower zaxinone content in roots and exhibited reduced root and shoot biomass, fewer tillers, and higher strigolactone (SL) levels
OsZAS2	phosphate	ZAXINONE SYNTHASE 2 regulates growth and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	 OsZAS2 was predominantly localized in plastids and mainly expressed under phosphate starvation
OsZAS2	phosphate starvation	ZAXINONE SYNTHASE 2 regulates growth and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	 OsZAS2 was predominantly localized in plastids and mainly expressed under phosphate starvation
