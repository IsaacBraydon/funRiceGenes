OsZIP5	OsZIP9	ZINC TRANSPORTER5 and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 function synergistically in zinc/cadmium uptake.	 In this study, we functionally characterized two Zn transporter genes in rice (Oryza sativa), ZINC TRANSPORTER5 (OsZIP5) and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 (OsZIP9), which are tandem duplicates and act synergistically in Zn/Cd uptake
OsZIP5	OsZIP9	ZINC TRANSPORTER5 and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 function synergistically in zinc/cadmium uptake.	 The expression profiles of OsZIP5 and OsZIP9 overlap in the root epidermis and respond to the local Zn status in the root
OsZIP5	OsZIP9	ZINC TRANSPORTER5 and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 function synergistically in zinc/cadmium uptake.	 OsZIP5 functions redundantly to OsZIP9, but has a relatively weaker effect
OsZIP5	OsZIP9	ZINC TRANSPORTER5 and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 function synergistically in zinc/cadmium uptake.	 Plants with the knockout mutations oszip5, oszip9, or oszip5oszip9 show impaired Zn/Cd uptake
OsZIP5	OsZIP9	ZINC TRANSPORTER5 and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 function synergistically in zinc/cadmium uptake.	 The decreased Zn/Cd levels and growth retardation in the oszip5 mutant are less severe than in the oszip9 mutant
OsZIP9	ZN	ZINC TRANSPORTER5 and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 function synergistically in zinc/cadmium uptake.	 In this study, we functionally characterized two Zn transporter genes in rice (Oryza sativa), ZINC TRANSPORTER5 (OsZIP5) and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 (OsZIP9), which are tandem duplicates and act synergistically in Zn/Cd uptake
OsZIP9	ZN	ZINC TRANSPORTER5 and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 function synergistically in zinc/cadmium uptake.	 The expression profiles of OsZIP5 and OsZIP9 overlap in the root epidermis and respond to the local Zn status in the root
OsZIP9	ZN	ZINC TRANSPORTER5 and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 function synergistically in zinc/cadmium uptake.	 However, OsZIP9 is also regulated by systemic signals of Zn status from the shoot
OsZIP9	ZN	The ZIP transporter family member OsZIP9 contributes to root Zn uptake in rice under Zn-limited conditions.	The ZIP transporter family member OsZIP9 contributes to root Zn uptake in rice under Zn-limited conditions.
OsZIP9	ZN	The ZIP transporter family member OsZIP9 contributes to root Zn uptake in rice under Zn-limited conditions.	 Here, we found that OsZIP9, a member of ZIP (ZRT, IRT-like protein) family, is involved in Zn uptake in rice under Zn-limited conditions
OsZIP9	ZN	The ZIP transporter family member OsZIP9 contributes to root Zn uptake in rice under Zn-limited conditions.	 OsZIP9 was mainly localized to the plasma membrane and showed transport activity for Zn in yeast
OsZIP9	ZN	The ZIP transporter family member OsZIP9 contributes to root Zn uptake in rice under Zn-limited conditions.	 For plants grown in a hydroponic solution with low Zn concentration, knockout of OsZIP9 significantly reduced plant growth, which was accompanied by decreased Zn concentrations in both the root and shoot
OsZIP9	ZN	The ZIP transporter family member OsZIP9 contributes to root Zn uptake in rice under Zn-limited conditions.	 Combined, these results indicate that OsZIP9 localized at the root exodermis and endodermis functions as an influx transporter of Zn and contributes to Zn uptake under Zn-limited conditions in rice
OsZIP9	ZN	A high activity zinc transporter OsZIP9 mediates zinc uptake in rice.	 Here, we report that a member of ZIP (ZRT, IRT-like protein) family, OsZIP9, functions in Zn uptake in rice
OsZIP9	ZN	A high activity zinc transporter OsZIP9 mediates zinc uptake in rice.	 Yeast-expressed OsZIP9 showed much higher Zn influx transport activity than other rice ZIP proteins in a wide range of Zn concentrations
OsZIP9	ZN	A high activity zinc transporter OsZIP9 mediates zinc uptake in rice.	 OsZIP9 knockout rice plants showed a significant reduction in growth at low Zn concentration, but could be rescued by high Zn supply
OsZIP9	ZN	A high activity zinc transporter OsZIP9 mediates zinc uptake in rice.	 Natural variation of OsZIP9 expression level is highly associated with Zn content in milled grain among rice varieties in the germplasm collection
OsZIP9	ZN	A high activity zinc transporter OsZIP9 mediates zinc uptake in rice.	 Taken together, these results show that OsZIP9 is an important influx transporter responsible for uptake of Zn and Co from external media into root cells
