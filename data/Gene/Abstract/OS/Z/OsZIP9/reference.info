NA	ZINC TRANSPORTER5 and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 function synergistically in zinc/cadmium uptake.	2020	Plant Physiol	Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences CITY: Changsha China [CN].	The elements Zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) have similar chemical and physical properties, but contrasting physiological effects in higher organisms. In plants, Zn/Cd transport is mediated by various transporter proteins belonging to different families. In this study, we functionally characterized two Zn transporter genes in rice (Oryza sativa), ZINC TRANSPORTER5 (OsZIP5) and ZINC TRANSPORTER9 (OsZIP9), which are tandem duplicates and act synergistically in Zn/Cd uptake. Both genes encode plasma membrane-localized proteins with influx transporter activity. The expression profiles of OsZIP5 and OsZIP9 overlap in the root epidermis and respond to the local Zn status in the root. However, OsZIP9 is also regulated by systemic signals of Zn status from the shoot. OsZIP5 functions redundantly to OsZIP9, but has a relatively weaker effect. Plants with the knockout mutations oszip5, oszip9, or oszip5oszip9 show impaired Zn/Cd uptake. The decreased Zn/Cd levels and growth retardation in the oszip5 mutant are less severe than in the oszip9 mutant. However, the double mutant oszip5oszip9 showed an enhanced Zn deficiency phenotype compared with the single mutants, and few double knockout plants were able to survive the entire growth cycle without excessive Zn supply. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsZIP9 had markedly enhanced Zn/Cd levels in the aboveground tissues and brown rice. The results of our study fill a gap in current knowledge of Zn uptake and improve our understanding of Zn/Cd accumulation in rice.
NA	The ZIP transporter family member OsZIP9 contributes to root Zn uptake in rice under Zn-limited conditions.	2020	Plant Physiol	Okayama University CITY: Kurashiki Japan [JP].	Zinc is an important essential micronutrient for plants and humans; however, the exact transporter responsible for root zinc (Zn) uptake from soil has not been identified. Here, we found that OsZIP9, a member of ZIP (ZRT, IRT-like protein) family, is involved in Zn uptake in rice under Zn-limited conditions. OsZIP9 was mainly localized to the plasma membrane and showed transport activity for Zn in yeast. Expression pattern analysis showed that OsZIP9 was mainly expressed in the roots throughout all growth stages and its expression was up-regulated by Zn-deficiency. Furthermore, OsZIP9 was expressed in the exodermis and endodermis of root mature regions. For plants grown in a hydroponic solution with low Zn concentration, knockout of OsZIP9 significantly reduced plant growth, which was accompanied by decreased Zn concentrations in both the root and shoot. However, plant growth and Zn accumulation did not differ between knockout lines and wild-type rice under Zn-sufficient conditions. When grown in soil, Zn concentrations in the shoots and grains of knockout lines were decreased to half of wild-type rice, whereas the concentrations of other mineral nutrients were not altered. A short-term kinetic experiment with stable isotope 67Zn showed that 67Zn uptake in knockout lines was much lower than that in wild-type rice. Combined, these results indicate that OsZIP9 localized at the root exodermis and endodermis functions as an influx transporter of Zn and contributes to Zn uptake under Zn-limited conditions in rice.
