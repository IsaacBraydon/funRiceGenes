OsMAPK33|OsMAPK3	OsZFP213|PINE1|DEC1	A C2H2 zinc-finger protein OsZFP213 interacts with OsMAPK3 to enhance salt tolerance in rice.	A C2H2 zinc-finger protein OsZFP213 interacts with OsMAPK3 to enhance salt tolerance in rice.
OsMAPK33|OsMAPK3	OsZFP213|PINE1|DEC1	A C2H2 zinc-finger protein OsZFP213 interacts with OsMAPK3 to enhance salt tolerance in rice.	 Yeast two-hybrid, pull-down, and BiFC analysis showed that OsMAPK3 is a direct partner of OsZFP213, and this interaction enhanced the transactivation activity of OsZFP213
OsMAPK33|OsMAPK3	OsZFP213|PINE1|DEC1	A C2H2 zinc-finger protein OsZFP213 interacts with OsMAPK3 to enhance salt tolerance in rice.	 Taken together, these results suggest that OsZFP213 cooperates with OsMAPK3 in the regulation of rice salt stress tolerance by enhancing the ability of scavenging reactive oxygen
OsSIN|ACE1	OsZFP213|PINE1|DEC1	Antagonistic regulation of the gibberellic acid response during stem growth in rice 	 We also show that the mechanism of internode elongation that is mediated by ACE1 and DEC1 is conserved in the Gramineae family
OsSIN|ACE1	OsZFP213|PINE1|DEC1	Antagonistic regulation of the gibberellic acid response during stem growth in rice 	 Furthermore, an analysis of genetic diversity suggests that mutations in ACE1 and DEC1 have historically contributed to the selection of shorter plants in domesticated populations of rice to increase their resistance to lodging, and of taller plants in wild species of rice for adaptation to growth in deep water
