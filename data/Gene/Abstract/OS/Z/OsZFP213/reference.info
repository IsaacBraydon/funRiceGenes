NA	A C2H2 zinc-finger protein OsZFP213 interacts with OsMAPK3 to enhance salt tolerance in rice.	2018	J Plant Physiol	The Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China.	Improvement of salt tolerance is one of the major targets in rice breeding. Here, we report that the zinc-finger protein (ZFP) OsZFP213 functions in enhancing salt tolerance in rice. OsZFP213 is localized in the nucleus and has transactivation activity. Transgenic rice overexpressing OsZFP213 showed enhanced salt tolerance compared with wild type and OsZFP213 RNAi plants. Furthermore, OsZFP213 overexpression plants showed higher transcription levels of antioxidant system genes and higher catalytic activity of scavenging enzymes of reactive oxygen, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GR), and a lower level of ROS accumulation than that in wild type and OsZFP213 RNAi plants under salt treatment. Yeast two-hybrid, pull-down, and BiFC analysis showed that OsMAPK3 is a direct partner of OsZFP213, and this interaction enhanced the transactivation activity of OsZFP213. Taken together, these results suggest that OsZFP213 cooperates with OsMAPK3 in the regulation of rice salt stress tolerance by enhancing the ability of scavenging reactive oxygen.
NA	A transcription factor coordinating internode elongation and photoperiodic signals in rice.	2019	Nat Plants	Department of Biosciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.	In several plant species, inflorescence formation is accompanied by stem elongation. Both processes are accelerated in rice upon perception of shortening days. Here, we show that PREMATURE INTERNODE ELONGATION 1 (PINE1), encoding a rice zinc-finger transcription factor, reduces the sensitivity of the stem to gibberellin (GA). The florigens reduce PINE1 expression to increase stem responsiveness to GA and promote flowering. These data indicate the existence of a regulatory network coordinating flowering and GA-dependent growth.
