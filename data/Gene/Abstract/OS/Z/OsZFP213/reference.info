NA	A C2H2 zinc-finger protein OsZFP213 interacts with OsMAPK3 to enhance salt tolerance in rice.	2018	J Plant Physiol	The Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China.	Improvement of salt tolerance is one of the major targets in rice breeding. Here, we report that the zinc-finger protein (ZFP) OsZFP213 functions in enhancing salt tolerance in rice. OsZFP213 is localized in the nucleus and has transactivation activity. Transgenic rice overexpressing OsZFP213 showed enhanced salt tolerance compared with wild type and OsZFP213 RNAi plants. Furthermore, OsZFP213 overexpression plants showed higher transcription levels of antioxidant system genes and higher catalytic activity of scavenging enzymes of reactive oxygen, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GR), and a lower level of ROS accumulation than that in wild type and OsZFP213 RNAi plants under salt treatment. Yeast two-hybrid, pull-down, and BiFC analysis showed that OsMAPK3 is a direct partner of OsZFP213, and this interaction enhanced the transactivation activity of OsZFP213. Taken together, these results suggest that OsZFP213 cooperates with OsMAPK3 in the regulation of rice salt stress tolerance by enhancing the ability of scavenging reactive oxygen.
NA	A transcription factor coordinating internode elongation and photoperiodic signals in rice.	2019	Nat Plants	Department of Biosciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.	In several plant species, inflorescence formation is accompanied by stem elongation. Both processes are accelerated in rice upon perception of shortening days. Here, we show that PREMATURE INTERNODE ELONGATION 1 (PINE1), encoding a rice zinc-finger transcription factor, reduces the sensitivity of the stem to gibberellin (GA). The florigens reduce PINE1 expression to increase stem responsiveness to GA and promote flowering. These data indicate the existence of a regulatory network coordinating flowering and GA-dependent growth.
NA	Antagonistic regulation of the gibberellic acid response during stem growth in rice 	2020	nature	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan.	The size of plants is largely determined by growth of the stem. Stem elongation is stimulated by gibberellic acid1-3. Here we show that internode stem elongation in rice is regulated antagonistically by an 'accelerator' and a 'decelerator' in concert with gibberellic acid. Expression of a gene we name ACCELERATOR OF INTERNODE ELONGATION 1 (ACE1), which encodes a protein of unknown function, confers cells of the intercalary meristematic region with the competence for cell division, leading to internode elongation in the presence of gibberellic acid. By contrast, upregulation of DECELERATOR OF INTERNODE ELONGATION 1 (DEC1), which encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor, suppresses internode elongation, whereas downregulation of DEC1 allows internode elongation. We also show that the mechanism of internode elongation that is mediated by ACE1 and DEC1 is conserved in the Gramineae family. Furthermore, an analysis of genetic diversity suggests that mutations in ACE1 and DEC1 have historically contributed to the selection of shorter plants in domesticated populations of rice to increase their resistance to lodging, and of taller plants in wild species of rice for adaptation to growth in deep water. Our identification of these antagonistic regulatory factors enhances our understanding of the gibberellic acid response as an additional mechanism that regulates internode elongation and environmental fitness, beyond biosynthesis and gibberellic acid signal transduction.
