NA	Overexpression of the zinc finger protein gene OsZFP350 improves root development by increasing resistance to abiotic stress in rice.	2019	Acta Biochim Pol	School of Bioengineering, Sichuan University of Science and Engineering, Yibin 644005, Sichuan, China.	The root system of rice is influenced by various environmental factors. However, how the root system responds to abiotic stress has not yet been fully understood. A zinc finger protein gene, OsZFP350, is exclusively expressed in the rice root, but its biological function needs to be investigated. Expression of OsZFP350 was up-regulated by salt, drought and high temperature, indicating that it might be a regulator in response to abiotic stress in rice root. The primary root length, the number of adventitious and lateral roots was significantly increased in OsZFP350 transgenic plants when compared to the wild-type. In addition, our results also show that the up-regulated OsZFP350 could significantly increase the germination rate of seeds under abiotic stress, and attenuate the heat, salinity and drought stress during the development of rice roots. Based on these findings, it could be concluded that OsZFP350 plays a positive role in the adaptability of rice roots to abiotic stress.
