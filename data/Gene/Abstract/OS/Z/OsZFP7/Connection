OsZFP7|ZFP207	sd1|GA20ox2	A Cys2/His2 zinc finger protein acts as a repressor of green revolution gene SD1/OsGA20ox2 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Moreover, ZFP207 repressed the expression of OsGA20ox2 via binding to its promoter region.
OsZFP7|ZFP207	sd1|GA20ox2	A Cys2/His2 zinc finger protein acts as a repressor of green revolution gene SD1/OsGA20ox2 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Taken together, ZFP207 acts as a transcriptional repressor of SD1/OsGA20ox2 and it may play a critical role in plant growth and development through fine-tuning GA biosynthesis in rice.
OsZFP7|ZFP207	sd1|GA20ox2	A Cys2/His2 zinc finger protein acts as a repressor of green revolution gene SD1/OsGA20ox2 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Here we report a Cys2/His2 zinc finger protein ZFP207 acting as a transcriptional repressor of OsGA20ox2.
