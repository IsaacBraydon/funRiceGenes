NA	A novel antisense long noncoding RNA, TWISTED LEAF, maintains leaf blade flattening by regulating its associated sense R2R3-MYB gene in rice.	2018	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Natural antisense long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are widespread in many organisms. However, their biological functions remain largely unknown, particularly in plants. We report the identification and characterization of an endogenous lncRNA, TWISTED LEAF (TL), which is transcribed from the opposite strand of the R2R3 MYB transcription factor gene locus, OsMYB60, in rice (Oryza sativa). TL and OsMYB60 were found to be coexpressed in many different tissues, and the expression level of TL was higher than that of OsMYB60. Downregulation of TL by RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression of OsMYB60 resulted in twisted leaf blades in transgenic rice. The expression level of OsMYB60 was significantly increased in TL-RNAi transgenic plants. This suggests that TL may play a cis-regulatory role on OsMYB60 in leaf morphological development. We also determined that the antisense transcription suppressed the sense gene expression by mediating chromatin modifications. We further discovered that a C2H2 transcription factor, OsZFP7, is an OsMYB60 binding partner and involved in leaf development. Taken together, these findings reveal that the cis-natural antisense lncRNA plays a critical role in maintaining leaf blade flattening in rice. Our study uncovers a regulatory mechanism of lncRNA in plant leaf development.
NA	A Cys2/His2 zinc finger protein acts as a repressor of green revolution gene SD1/OsGA20ox2 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2020	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Gibberellins (GAs) play important roles in the regulation of plant growth and development. The green revolution gene SD1 encoding gibberellin 20-oxidase 2 (GA20ox2) has been widely used in modern rice breeding. However, the molecular mechanism of how SD1/OsGA20ox2 expression is regulated remains unclear. Here we report a Cys2/His2 zinc finger protein ZFP207 acting as a transcriptional repressor of OsGA20ox2. ZFP207 was mainly accumulated in young tissues and more specifically in culm nodes. ZFP207-overexpression (ZFP207OE) plants displayed semi-dwarfism phenotype and small grains by modulating cell length. RNA interference of ZFP207 caused increased plant height and grain length. Application of exogenous GA3 could rescue the semi-dwarf phenotype of ZFP207OE rice seedlings. Moreover, ZFP207 repressed the expression of OsGA20ox2 via binding to its promoter region. Taken together, ZFP207 acts as a transcriptional repressor of SD1/OsGA20ox2 and it may play a critical role in plant growth and development through fine-tuning GA biosynthesis in rice.
