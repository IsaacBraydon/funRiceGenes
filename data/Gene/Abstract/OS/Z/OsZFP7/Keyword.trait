OsZFP7|ZFP207	leaf development	A novel antisense long noncoding RNA, TWISTED LEAF, maintains leaf blade flattening by regulating its associated sense R2R3-MYB gene in rice.	We further discovered that a C2H2 transcription factor, OsZFP7, is an OsMYB60 binding partner and involved in leaf development.
OsZFP7|ZFP207	leaf flattening	A novel antisense long noncoding RNA, TWISTED LEAF, maintains leaf blade flattening by regulating its associated sense R2R3-MYB gene in rice.	A C2H2 transcription factor, OsZFP7, also is involved in the TL/OsMYB60©\regulated pathway to maintain leaf flattening
