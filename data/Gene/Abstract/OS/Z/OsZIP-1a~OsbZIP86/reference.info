10.1007-s11741-009-0216-3.pdf	Genome-wide analysis of basic leucine zipper transcription factor families in Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Populus trichocarpa	2009	Journal of Shanghai University (English Edition)	School of Life Sciences, Shanghai University, Shanghai, 200444, P. R. China	The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors form a large gene family that is important in pathogen defense, light and stress signaling, etc. The Completed whole genome sequences of model plants Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa) constitute a valuable resource for genome-wide analysis and genomic comparative analysis, as they are representatives of the two major evolutionary lineages within the angiosperms: the monocotyledons and the dicotyledons. In this study, bioinformatics analysis identified 74, 89 and 88 bZIP genes respectively in Arabidopsis, rice and poplar. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of this gene family is presented, including the gene structure, phylogeny, chromosome distribution, conserved motifs. As a result, the plant bZIPs were organized into 10 subfamilies on basis of phylogenetic relationship. Gene duplication events during the family evolution history were also investigated. And it was further concluded that chromosomal/segmental duplication might have played a key role in gene expansion of bZIP gene family.
J. Biol. Chem.-1996-Nantel-31296-305.pdf	Characterization of three rice basic/leucine zipper factors, including two inhibitors of EmBP-1 DNA binding activity	1996	J Biol Chem	Department of Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-3280, USA. andre.nantel@br.nrc.ca	The promoter of the wheat Em gene contains elements with a CACGTG core sequence (G-boxes), which are recognized by EmBP-1, a wheat basic/leucine zipper (bZIP) protein. G-boxes are required for Em expression in response to the phytohormone abscisic acid and for transactivation by the Viviparous-1 protein (VP1) using transient expression systems. In order to identify other factors that are part of the transcriptional complex that associates with G-boxes, we have screened a rice (Oryza sativa) cDNA library with biotinylated EmBP-1. We have isolated osZIP-1a, a homolog of EmBP-1 and other plant G-box-binding factors. We show that EmBP-1 and osZIP-1a will preferentially heterodimerize in vitro. Overexpression of osZIP-1a in rice protoplasts can enhance expression from the Em promoter only in the presence of abscisic acid. Two other clones have been identified by screening with EmBP-1: osZIP-2a and osZIP-2b. These osZIP-2 factors represent a novel class of bZIP proteins with an unusual DNA-binding domain that does not recognize G-boxes. The osZIP-2 factors can heterodimerize with EmBP-1 and prevent it from binding to the Em promoter. Interestingly, osZIP-1a does not heterodimerize with the osZIP-2 factors and its DNA binding activity is unaffected by their presence. Thus, osZIP-2 factors may be involved in sequestering a particular group of G-box-binding factors into inactive heterodimers.

The basic leucine (Leu) zipper (bZIP) proteins compose a family of transcriptional regulators present exclusively in eukaryotes. The bZIP proteins characteristically harbor a bZIP domain composed of two structural features: a DNA-binding basic region and the Leu zipper dimerization region. They have been shown to regulate diverse plant-specific phenomena, including seed maturation and germination, floral induction and development, and photomorphogenesis, and are also involved in stress and hormone signaling. We have identified 89 bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Their chromosomal distribution and sequence analyses suggest that the bZIP transcription factor family has evolved via gene duplication. The phylogenetic relationship among rice bZIP domains as well as with bZIP domains from other plant bZIP factors suggests that homologous bZIP domains exist in plants. Similar intron/exon structural patterns were observed in the basic and hinge regions of their bZIP domains. Detailed sequence analysis has been done to identify additional conserved motifs outside the bZIP domain and to predict their DNA-binding site specificity as well as dimerization properties, which has helped classify them into different groups and subfamilies, respectively. Expression of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes has been analyzed by full-length cDNA and expressed sequence tag-based expression profiling. This expression profiling was complemented by microarray analysis. The results indicate specific or coexpression patterns of rice bZIP transcription factors starting from floral transition to various stages of panicle and seed development. bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice also displayed differential expression patterns in rice seedlings in response to abiotic stress and light irradiation. An effort has been made to link the structure and expression pattern of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice to their function, based on the information obtained from our analyses and earlier known results. This information will be important for functional characterization of bZIP transcription factors in rice.
