Two ZIP (Zrt, Irt-like Protein) cDNAs were isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) by RT-PCR approach, and named as OsZIP7a and OsZIP8 respectively. The predicted proteins of OsZIP7a and OsZIP8 consist of 384 and 390 amino acid residues respectively, and display high similarity to other plant ZIP proteins. Each protein contains eight transmembrane (TM) domains and a highly conserved ZIP signature motif, with a histidine-rich region in the variable region between TM domains III and IV. By semi-quantitative RT-PCR approach, it was found that the expression of OsZIP7a was significantly induced in rice roots by iron-deficiency, while that of OsZIP8 induced in both rice roots and shoots by zinc-deficiency. When expressed in yeast cells, OsZIP7a and OsZIP8 could complement an iron-uptake-deficient yeast mutant and a zinc-uptake-deficient yeast mutant respectively. It suggested that the OsZIP7a and OsZIP8 might encode an iron and a zinc transporter protein in rice respectively.
NA	Elemental Profiling of Rice FOX Lines Leads to Characterization of a New Zn Plasma Membrane Transporter, OsZIP7.	2018	Front Plant Sci	Programa de P¨®s-Gradua<U+00E7><U+00E3>o em Biologia Celular e Molecular, Centro de Biotecnologia, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.	Iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) are essential micronutrients required for proper development in both humans and plants. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) grains are the staple food for nearly half of the world's population, but a poor source of metals such as Fe and Zn. Populations that rely on milled cereals are especially prone to Fe and Zn deficiencies, the most prevalent nutritional deficiencies in humans. Biofortification is a cost-effective solution for improvement of the nutritional quality of crops. However, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying grain accumulation of mineral nutrients is required before this approach can achieve its full potential. Characterization of gene function is more time-consuming in crops than in model species such as Arabidopsis thaliana. Aiming to more quickly characterize rice genes related to metal homeostasis, we applied the concept of high throughput elemental profiling (ionomics) to Arabidopsis lines heterologously expressing rice cDNAs driven by the 35S promoter, named FOX (Full Length Over-eXpressor) lines. We screened lines expressing candidate genes that could be used in the development of biofortified grain. Among the most promising candidates, we identified two lines ovexpressing the metal cation transporter OsZIP7. OsZIP7 expression in Arabidopsis resulted in a 25% increase in shoot Zn concentrations compared to non-transformed plants. We further characterized OsZIP7 and showed that it is localized to the plasma membrane and is able to complement Zn transport defective (but not Fe defective) yeast mutants. Interestingly, we showed that OsZIP7 does not transport Cd, which is commonly transported by ZIP proteins. Importantly, OsZIP7-expressing lines have increased Zn concentrations in their seeds. Our results indicate that OsZIP7 is a good candidate for developing Zn biofortified rice. Moreover, we showed the use of heterologous expression of genes from crops in A. thaliana as a fast method for characterization of crop genes related to the ionome and potentially useful in biofortification strategies.
NA	OsZIP7 functions in xylem loading in roots and inter-vascular transfer in nodes to deliver Zn/Cd to grain in rice.	2019	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Key Laboratory of Agro-ecological Processes in Subtropical Region, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changsha, Hunan, 410125, China. Electronic address: tanlongtao@isa.ac.cn.	Rice has lower zinc (Zn) but higher cadmium (Cd) content in grains than other staple crops. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in Zn and Cd transportation could benefit homeostatic control, facilitating optimisation of Zn and Cd levels to provide maximum nutrition and safety. In this study, we functionally characterised in planta the rice (Oryza sativa) transporter OsZIP7, which encodes a plasma membrane-localised protein with influx transport activity for both Zn and Cd. OsZIP7 was expressed in parenchyma cells of vascular bundles in roots and nodes. OsZIP7 knockout resulted in retention of Zn and Cd in roots and basal nodes, which hindered their upward delivery to upper nodes and brown rice. And a short-term labelling experiment with the stable 67Zn isotope showed that Zn was distributed toward roots and basal regions and away from leaves in the mutant compared with wild-type rice. Thus, OsZIP7 plays an integral role in xylem loading in roots and inter-vascular transfer in nodes to preferentially deliver Zn and Cd to developing tissues and rice grains.
NA	Physiological responses of rice ( Oryza sativa L.) oszip7 loss-of-function plants exposed to varying Zn concentrations 	2020	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	Programa de P¨®s Gradua<U+00E7><U+00E3>o em Agrobiologia, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Santa Maria, Brazil.	Rice is a daily staple for half of the world's population. However, rice grains are poor in micronutrients such as Fe and Zn, the two most commonly deficient minerals in the human diet. In plants, Fe and Zn must be absorbed from the soil, distributed and stored, so that their concentrations are maintained at sufficient but non-toxic levels. The understanding of mechanisms of Fe and Zn homeostasis in plants has the potential to benefit agriculture, improving the use of micronutrients by plants, as well as to indicate approaches that aim at biofortification of the grains. ZIP transporters are commonly associated with Zn uptake, but there are few reports about their physiological relevance in planta. Here we describe a Tos17 loss-of-function line for the Zn plasma membrane transporter OsZIP7 (oszip7). We showed that the absence of functional OsZIP7 leads to deregulated Zn partitioning, increasing Zn accumulation in roots but decreasing in shoots and seeds. We also demonstrated that, upon Zn deficiency, oszip7 plants slightly increase their photosynthetic performance, suggesting that these plants might be primed for Zn deficiency which makes them more tolerant. On the other hand, we found that Zn excess is more deleterious to oszip7 plants compared to wild type, which may be linked to secondary effects in concentrations of other elements such as Fe. Our data suggest that OsZIP7 is important for Zn homeostasis under physiological Zn concentrations, and that Fe homeostasis might be affected due to loss of function of OsZIP7.
