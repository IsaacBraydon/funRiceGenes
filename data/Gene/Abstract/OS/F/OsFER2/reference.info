However, when free and in excess, iron can catalyze the formation of oxygen free radicals. Ferritin, a protein capable of storing up to 4500 atoms of iron, can act as an iron buffer inside plant cells. Using a strategy based in amplicon size difference, we were able to analyze the expression profile of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2). Both genes are expressed, although with different regulation and organ distribution. Exposure to copper, Paraquat, SNP and excess iron led to accumulation of ferritin mRNA, remarkably of OsFER2. The iron-induced expression was abolished by treatment with GSH, indicating that the induction observed is dependent of an oxidative step. OsFER2 mRNA levels in rice flag leaves and panicles at different reproductive stages were higher than OsFER1 mRNA levels. No ferritin mRNA was detected in rice seeds. However, imbibition under light led to ferritin expression, which was abolished when seeds were kept in the dark, suggesting a light-regulated induction. Ferritin mRNA accumulation was seen in the dark only when seeds were germinated in the presence of externally supplied iron. We suggest that the primary role of rice ferritins is related to defense against iron-mediated oxidative stress.
