However, when free and in excess, iron can catalyze the formation of oxygen free radicals. Ferritin, a protein capable of storing up to 4500 atoms of iron, can act as an iron buffer inside plant cells. Using a strategy based in amplicon size difference, we were able to analyze the expression profile of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2). Both genes are expressed, although with different regulation and organ distribution. Exposure to copper, Paraquat, SNP and excess iron led to accumulation of ferritin mRNA, remarkably of OsFER2. The iron-induced expression was abolished by treatment with GSH, indicating that the induction observed is dependent of an oxidative step. OsFER2 mRNA levels in rice flag leaves and panicles at different reproductive stages were higher than OsFER1 mRNA levels. No ferritin mRNA was detected in rice seeds. However, imbibition under light led to ferritin expression, which was abolished when seeds were kept in the dark, suggesting a light-regulated induction. Ferritin mRNA accumulation was seen in the dark only when seeds were germinated in the presence of externally supplied iron. We suggest that the primary role of rice ferritins is related to defense against iron-mediated oxidative stress.
NA	Rice iron storage protein ferritin 2 (OsFER2) positively regulates ferroptotic cell death and defense responses against Magnaporthe oryzae.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Division of Integrative Bioscience and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea.	Ferritin is a ubiquitous iron storage protein that regulates iron homeostasis and oxidative stress in plants. Iron plays an important role in ferroptotic cell death response of rice (Oryza sativa) to Magnaporthe oryzae infection. Here, we and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent ferroptotic cell death and defense response against the avirulent M. oryzae INA168. The full-length ferritin OsFER2 and its transit peptide were localized to the chloroplast, the most Fe-rich organelle for photosynthesis. This suggests that the transit peptide acts as a signal peptide for the rice ferritin OsFER2 to move into chloroplasts. OsFER2 expression is involved in rice resistance to M. oryzae infection. OsFER2 knock-out in wild-type rice HY did not induce ROS and ferric ion (Fe(3+)) accumulation, lipid peroxidation and hypersensitive response (HR) cell death, and also downregulated the defense-related genes OsPAL1, OsPR1-b, OsRbohB, OsNADP-ME2-3, OsMEK2 and OsMPK1, and vacuolar membrane transporter OsVIT2 expression. OsFER2 complementation in ΔOsfer2 knock-out mutants restored ROS and iron accumulation and HR cell death phenotypes during infection. The iron chelator deferoxamine, the lipid-ROS scavenger ferrostatin-1, the actin microfilament polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin E and the redox inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium suppressed ROS and iron accumulation and HR cell death in rice leaf sheaths. However, the small-molecule inducer erastin did not trigger iron-dependent ROS accumulation and HR cell death induction in ΔOsfer2 mutants. These combined results suggest and ROS-dependent ferroptotic cell death and defense response in rice-M. oryzae interactions.
