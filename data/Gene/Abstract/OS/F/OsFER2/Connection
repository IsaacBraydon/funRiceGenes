OsFER1	OsFER2	Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)	 Using a strategy based in amplicon size difference, we were able to analyze the expression profile of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)| OsFER2 mRNA levels in rice flag leaves and panicles at different reproductive stages were higher than OsFER1 mRNA levels|Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)
