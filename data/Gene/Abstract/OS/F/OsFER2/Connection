OsFER1	OsFER2	Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)	Using a strategy based in amplicon size difference, we were able to analyze the expression profile of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)
OsFER1	OsFER2	Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)	OsFER2 mRNA levels in rice flag leaves and panicles at different reproductive stages were higher than OsFER1 mRNA levels
OsFER1	OsFER2	Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)	Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)
OsFER2	OsMKK1|OsMEK2	Rice iron storage protein ferritin 2 (OsFER2) positively regulates ferroptotic cell death and defense responses against Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsFER2 knock-out in wild-type rice HY did not induce ROS and ferric ion (Fe(3+)) accumulation, lipid peroxidation and hypersensitive response (HR) cell death, and also downregulated the defense-related genes OsPAL1, OsPR1-b, OsRbohB, OsNADP-ME2-3, OsMEK2 and OsMPK1, and vacuolar membrane transporter OsVIT2 expression
OsFER2	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	Rice iron storage protein ferritin 2 (OsFER2) positively regulates ferroptotic cell death and defense responses against Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsFER2 knock-out in wild-type rice HY did not induce ROS and ferric ion (Fe(3+)) accumulation, lipid peroxidation and hypersensitive response (HR) cell death, and also downregulated the defense-related genes OsPAL1, OsPR1-b, OsRbohB, OsNADP-ME2-3, OsMEK2 and OsMPK1, and vacuolar membrane transporter OsVIT2 expression
OsFER2	OsrbohB|Osrboh7	Rice iron storage protein ferritin 2 (OsFER2) positively regulates ferroptotic cell death and defense responses against Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsFER2 knock-out in wild-type rice HY did not induce ROS and ferric ion (Fe(3+)) accumulation, lipid peroxidation and hypersensitive response (HR) cell death, and also downregulated the defense-related genes OsPAL1, OsPR1-b, OsRbohB, OsNADP-ME2-3, OsMEK2 and OsMPK1, and vacuolar membrane transporter OsVIT2 expression
OsFER2	OsVIT2	Rice iron storage protein ferritin 2 (OsFER2) positively regulates ferroptotic cell death and defense responses against Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsFER2 knock-out in wild-type rice HY did not induce ROS and ferric ion (Fe(3+)) accumulation, lipid peroxidation and hypersensitive response (HR) cell death, and also downregulated the defense-related genes OsPAL1, OsPR1-b, OsRbohB, OsNADP-ME2-3, OsMEK2 and OsMPK1, and vacuolar membrane transporter OsVIT2 expression
OsFER2	PAL|OsPAL4|OsPAL1	Rice iron storage protein ferritin 2 (OsFER2) positively regulates ferroptotic cell death and defense responses against Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsFER2 knock-out in wild-type rice HY did not induce ROS and ferric ion (Fe(3+)) accumulation, lipid peroxidation and hypersensitive response (HR) cell death, and also downregulated the defense-related genes OsPAL1, OsPR1-b, OsRbohB, OsNADP-ME2-3, OsMEK2 and OsMPK1, and vacuolar membrane transporter OsVIT2 expression
