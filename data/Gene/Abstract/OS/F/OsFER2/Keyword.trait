OsFER2	panicle	Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)	OsFER2 mRNA levels in rice flag leaves and panicles at different reproductive stages were higher than OsFER1 mRNA levels
OsFER2	iron	Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)	Exposure to copper, Paraquat, SNP and excess iron led to accumulation of ferritin mRNA, remarkably of OsFER2
OsFER2	reproductive	Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)	OsFER2 mRNA levels in rice flag leaves and panicles at different reproductive stages were higher than OsFER1 mRNA levels
