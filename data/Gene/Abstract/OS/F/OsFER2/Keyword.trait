OsFER2	panicle	Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)	OsFER2 mRNA levels in rice flag leaves and panicles at different reproductive stages were higher than OsFER1 mRNA levels
OsFER2	iron	Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)	Exposure to copper, Paraquat, SNP and excess iron led to accumulation of ferritin mRNA, remarkably of OsFER2
OsFER2	reproductive	Differential regulation of the two rice ferritin genes (OsFER1 and OsFER2)	OsFER2 mRNA levels in rice flag leaves and panicles at different reproductive stages were higher than OsFER1 mRNA levels
OsFER2	resistance	Rice iron storage protein ferritin 2 (OsFER2) positively regulates ferroptotic cell death and defense responses against Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsFER2 expression is involved in rice resistance to M
OsFER2	photosynthesis	Rice iron storage protein ferritin 2 (OsFER2) positively regulates ferroptotic cell death and defense responses against Magnaporthe oryzae.	 The full-length ferritin OsFER2 and its transit peptide were localized to the chloroplast, the most Fe-rich organelle for photosynthesis
OsFER2	cell death	Rice iron storage protein ferritin 2 (OsFER2) positively regulates ferroptotic cell death and defense responses against Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsFER2 knock-out in wild-type rice HY did not induce ROS and ferric ion (Fe(3+)) accumulation, lipid peroxidation and hypersensitive response (HR) cell death, and also downregulated the defense-related genes OsPAL1, OsPR1-b, OsRbohB, OsNADP-ME2-3, OsMEK2 and OsMPK1, and vacuolar membrane transporter OsVIT2 expression
OsFER2	cell death	Rice iron storage protein ferritin 2 (OsFER2) positively regulates ferroptotic cell death and defense responses against Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsFER2 complementation in ΔOsfer2 knock-out mutants restored ROS and iron accumulation and HR cell death phenotypes during infection
OsFER2	transporter	Rice iron storage protein ferritin 2 (OsFER2) positively regulates ferroptotic cell death and defense responses against Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsFER2 knock-out in wild-type rice HY did not induce ROS and ferric ion (Fe(3+)) accumulation, lipid peroxidation and hypersensitive response (HR) cell death, and also downregulated the defense-related genes OsPAL1, OsPR1-b, OsRbohB, OsNADP-ME2-3, OsMEK2 and OsMPK1, and vacuolar membrane transporter OsVIT2 expression
OsFER2	iron	Rice iron storage protein ferritin 2 (OsFER2) positively regulates ferroptotic cell death and defense responses against Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsFER2 complementation in ΔOsfer2 knock-out mutants restored ROS and iron accumulation and HR cell death phenotypes during infection
