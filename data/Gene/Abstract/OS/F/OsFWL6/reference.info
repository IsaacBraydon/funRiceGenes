NA	Targeted Mutagenesis of the Rice FW 2.2-Like Gene Family Using the CRISPR/Cas9 System Reveals OsFWL4 as a Regulator of Tiller Number and Plant Yield in Rice.	2020	Int J Mol Sci	Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Regional Modern Agriculture &amp; Environmental Protection/Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Eco-Agricultural Biotechnology around Hongze Lake, Huaiyin Normal University, Huai&#39;an 223300, China.	The FW2.2-like (FWL) genes encode cysteine-rich proteins with a placenta-specific 8 domain. They play roles in cell division and organ size control, response to rhizobium infection, and metal ion homeostasis in plants. Here, we target eight rice FWL genes using the CRISPR/Cas9 system delivered by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. We successfully generate transgenic T(0) lines for 15 of the 16 targets. The targeted mutations are detected in the T(0) lines of all 15 targets and the average mutation rate is found to be 81.6%. Transfer DNA (T-DNA) truncation is a major reason for the failure of mutagenesis in T(0) plants. T-DNA segregation analysis reveals that the T-DNA inserts in transgenic plants can be easily eliminated in the T(1) generation. Of the 30 putative off-target sites examined, unintended mutations are detected in 13 sites. Phenotypic analysis reveals that tiller number and plant yield of OsFWL4 gene mutants are significantly greater than those of the wild type. Flag leaves of OsFWL4 gene mutants are wider than those of the wild type. The increase in leaf width of the mutants is caused by an increase in cell number. Additionally, grain length of OsFWL1 gene mutants is higher than that of the wild type. Our results suggest that transgene-free rice plants with targeted mutations can be produced in the T(1) generation using the Agrobacterium-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 system and that the OsFWL4 gene is a negative regulator of tiller number and plant yield.
NA	A New RING Finger Protein, PLANT ARCHITECTURE and GRAIN NUMBER 1, Affects Plant Architecture and Grain Yield in Rice.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering and MOE Engineering Research Center of Gene Technology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China.	Developing methods for increasing the biomass and improving the plant architecture is important for crop improvement. We herein describe a gene belonging to the RING_Ubox (RING (Really Interesting New Gene) finger domain and U-box domain) superfamily, PLANT ARCHITECTURE and&amp;nbsp;GRAIN NUMBER 1 (PAGN1), which regulates the number of grains per panicle, the plant height, and the number of tillers. We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce loss-of-function mutations to OsPAGN1. Compared with the control plants, the resulting pagn1 mutant plants had a higher grain yield because of increases in the plant height and in the number of tillers and grains per panicle. Thus, OsPAGN1 may be useful for the genetic improvement of plant architecture and yield. An examination of evolutionary relationships revealed that OsPAGN1 is highly conserved in rice. We demonstrated that OsPAGN1 can interact directly with OsCNR10 (CELL NUMBER REGULATOR10), which negatively regulates the number of rice grains per panicle. A transcriptome analysis indicated that silencing OsPAGN1 affects the levels of active cytokinins in rice. Therefore, our findings have clarified the OsPAGN1 functions related to rice growth and grain development.
