OsFTL1	panicle	Genome-wide expression quantitative trait locus studies facilitate isolation of causal genes controlling panicle structure 	 By combining pQTL and eQTL data, two genes were identified as controlling panicle structure: OsMADS18 modulates the average length of the primary rachis and OsFTL1 has pleiotropic effects on the total number of secondary rachides, number of grains per panicle, plant height and the length of flag leaves
