OsFWL5	resistance	Overexpression a &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene OsFWL5 improves rice resistance.	 The OsFWL5-overexpresing plants show activated flg22-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and increased resistance to Xoo, indicating that OsFWL5 functions to increase pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity in rice
OsFWL5	resistance	Overexpression a &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene OsFWL5 improves rice resistance.	 Furthermore, Cd can induce rice resistance to Xoo, and OsFWL5 is required for Cd-induced rice defense response
OsFWL5	resistance	Overexpression a &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene OsFWL5 improves rice resistance.	Putting our finds and previous work together, OsFWL5 could be a candiate gene for breeders to genetically improve rice resistance and grain quality
OsFWL5	grain	Overexpression a &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene OsFWL5 improves rice resistance.	Putting our finds and previous work together, OsFWL5 could be a candiate gene for breeders to genetically improve rice resistance and grain quality
OsFWL5	defense	Overexpression a &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene OsFWL5 improves rice resistance.	Here, we validated that one of rice FWL genes OsFWL5 plays a positive role in defense to Xanthomonas oryzae pv
OsFWL5	defense	Overexpression a &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene OsFWL5 improves rice resistance.	 Furthermore, Cd can induce rice resistance to Xoo, and OsFWL5 is required for Cd-induced rice defense response
OsFWL5	defense response	Overexpression a &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene OsFWL5 improves rice resistance.	 Furthermore, Cd can induce rice resistance to Xoo, and OsFWL5 is required for Cd-induced rice defense response
OsFWL5	cell death	Overexpression a &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene OsFWL5 improves rice resistance.	 Overexpresion of OsFWL5 promotes H2O2 accumulation and cell death
OsFWL5	immunity	Overexpression a &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene OsFWL5 improves rice resistance.	 The OsFWL5-overexpresing plants show activated flg22-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and increased resistance to Xoo, indicating that OsFWL5 functions to increase pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity in rice
OsFWL5	quality	Overexpression a &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene OsFWL5 improves rice resistance.	Putting our finds and previous work together, OsFWL5 could be a candiate gene for breeders to genetically improve rice resistance and grain quality
OsFWL5	reactive oxygen species	Overexpression a &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene OsFWL5 improves rice resistance.	 The OsFWL5-overexpresing plants show activated flg22-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and increased resistance to Xoo, indicating that OsFWL5 functions to increase pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity in rice
OsFWL5	grain quality	Overexpression a &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene OsFWL5 improves rice resistance.	Putting our finds and previous work together, OsFWL5 could be a candiate gene for breeders to genetically improve rice resistance and grain quality
