OsFDML1	OsMADS6|MFO1|AFG1	OsMADS6 controls flower development by activating rice FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE 1.	 In the present study, we report that OsMADS6 directly targets FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE 1 (OsFDML1), a rice homolog of the SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING3-like gene FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION 1 (FDM1) from Arabidopsis thaliana
OsFDML1	OsMADS6|MFO1|AFG1	OsMADS6 controls flower development by activating rice FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE 1.	 The expression of OsFDML1 overlaps with that of OsMADS6 in the palea primordia and the ovule, and OsMADS6 directly promotes OsFDML1 expression through binding to regions containing putative CArG motifs within the OsFDML1 promoter during rice spikelet development
OsFDML1	OsMADS6|MFO1|AFG1	OsMADS6 controls flower development by activating rice FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE 1.	 Consistent with the phenotypes of osmads6 mutants, the osfdml1 mutants showed floral defects, including altered palea identity with lemma-like shape containing no marginal region of palea, increased numbers of stigmas and fused carpels, and meristem indeterminacy
