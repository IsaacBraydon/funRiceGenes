OsFDML1	flower	OsMADS6 controls flower development by activating rice FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE 1.	 Arabidopsis FDM1 is involved in RNA-directed DNA methylation and OsFDML1 regulates flower development
OsFDML1	spikelet	OsMADS6 controls flower development by activating rice FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE 1.	 The expression of OsFDML1 overlaps with that of OsMADS6 in the palea primordia and the ovule, and OsMADS6 directly promotes OsFDML1 expression through binding to regions containing putative CArG motifs within the OsFDML1 promoter during rice spikelet development
OsFDML1	development	OsMADS6 controls flower development by activating rice FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE 1.	 Arabidopsis FDM1 is involved in RNA-directed DNA methylation and OsFDML1 regulates flower development

OsFDML1	floral	OsMADS6 controls flower development by activating rice FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE 1.	 Consistent with the phenotypes of osmads6 mutants, the osfdml1 mutants showed floral defects, including altered palea identity with lemma-like shape containing no marginal region of palea, increased numbers of stigmas and fused carpels, and meristem indeterminacy
OsFDML1	floral	OsMADS6 controls flower development by activating rice FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE 1.	 Moreover, transgenic plants overexpressing OsFDML1 displayed floral defects, such as abnormal paleae
OsFDML1	meristem	OsMADS6 controls flower development by activating rice FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE 1.	 Consistent with the phenotypes of osmads6 mutants, the osfdml1 mutants showed floral defects, including altered palea identity with lemma-like shape containing no marginal region of palea, increased numbers of stigmas and fused carpels, and meristem indeterminacy
OsFDML1	palea	OsMADS6 controls flower development by activating rice FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE 1.
