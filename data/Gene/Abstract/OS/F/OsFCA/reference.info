0270225.pdf	Overexpression of the rFCA RNA recognition motif affects morphologies modifications in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2007	Biosci Rep	Institute of Genetics, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, PR China.	RNA recognition motifs as important regulators of gene expression are highly conserved in animals and plants. The FCA floral promotion gene in Arabidopsis encodes a protein, containing two RNA recognition motifs (RRM) and a WW protein interaction domain. Here we isolated FCA cDNA from rice. FCA in rice (rFCA) was homologous to FCA-gamma of Arabidopsis and contained conserved domains. To investigate the function of RRM domain, fragment RRM1 and RRM2 of rFCA were introduced into rice subspecies Oryza sativa L. subsp. Indica var. 9311 and another rice subspecies Oryza sativa L. subsp. Japonica var. zhonghua11 transformation. Two transgenic lines exhibited similar phenotypes, flowering time delay, seed size and cell volume of transgenic plants was increased. These results showed that constitutive expression of RRMs could regulate cellular size. The patterns of overexpression of two RRM domains and their similar morphologies indicate they may play a same role.
21007783.pdf	Alternative splicing and expression analysis of OsFCA (FCA in Oryza sativa L.), a gene homologous to FCA in Arabidopsis	2006	DNA Seq	Institute of Genetics, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China.	A subtracted cDNAs library was constructed using rice (Oryza sativa L.) calli cDNA as driver and differentiating calli cDNA as tester. A novel gene homologous with FCA in Arabidopsis was cloned from rice by screening the SSH (suppression subtractive hybridization) library followed by RACE. Four alternative transcripts of OsFCA were cloned from the leaves of rice, and designated as OsFCA-1, OsFCA-2, OsFCA-3 and OsFCA-4 respectively. OsFCA-1 was homologous to FCA-gamma of Arabidopsis and contained several conserved domains (two RNA Recognition Motifs and one WW-domain). OsFCA-2 was 102 bp shorter than OsFCA-1 which caused the WW-domain deletion. The proteins encoded by OsFCA-3 and OsFCA-4 were 101 amino acids shorter than OsFCA-1 at the N-terminal which is a glycine-rich region. The fluorescence quantitative PCR analysis showed that the mRNA of OsFCA-1 is the most abundant in the four splicing variants of rice FCA, and its expression level is much higher in differentiating calli than in calli. The expression of OsFCA-1 is steady in the leaves of three different stage, but up-regulated in young spikelet of primary branch-differentiating stage and down-regulated in young spikelet of pistil and stamen-differentiating stage.

FCA and FY are flowering time related genes involved in the autonomous flowering pathway in Arabidopsis. FCA interacts with FY to regulate the alternative processing of FCA pre-mRNA. The FCA/FY interaction is also required for the regulation of FLC expression, a major floral repressor in Arabidopsis. However, it is not clear if the regulation of this autonomous flowering pathway is also present in monocot plants, such as rice. Recently, alternative RNA processing of OsFCA was observed in rice, which strongly suggested the existence of an autonomous flowering pathway in rice. In this work, we cloned the cDNA of the autonomous flowering pathway gene OsFY from rice. The predicted OsFY protein contained a conserved 7 WD-repeat region and at least two Pro-Pro-Leu-Pro motifs compared to Arabidopsis FY. The protein-protein interaction between OsFY and OsFCA-gamma, the key feature of their gene function, was also demonstrated using the yeast two-hybrid system. The GenBank database search provided evidence of expression for other autonomous pathway gene homologs in rice. These results indicate that the autonomous flowering pathway is present in monocots, and the regulation through FY and FCA interaction is conserved between monocots and dicots.
Plant Cell Physiol-2009-Jang-1479-92.pdf	Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Plant Signaling Network Research Center, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Korea.	The FCA protein is involved in controlling flowering time and plays more general roles in RNA-mediated chromatin silencing in Arabidopsis. It contains two RNA-binding domains and a WW domain. The FCA protein interacts with FY, a polyadenylation factor, via its WW domain. We previously characterized a rice gene, OsFCA, which was homologous to FCA. Here, we found that the OsFCA protein could interact through its WW domain with the following proteins: OsFY, a protein containing a CID domain present in RNA-processing factors such as Pcf11 and Nrd1; a protein similar to splicing factor SF1; a protein similar to FUSE splicing factor; and OsMADS8. The FY protein is associated with the 3' end processing machinery in Arabidopsis. Thus, we examined interactions between OsFY and the rice homologs (OsCstF-50, -64 and -77) of the AtCstF-50, -64 and -77 proteins. We found that OsFY could bind OsCstF50, whereas the OsCstF77 protein could bridge the interaction between OsCstF50 and OsCstF64. Taken together, our data suggest that OsFCA could interact with several proteins other than OsFY through its WW domain and may play several roles in rice.

Although several genes have been identified in rice which are functionally equivalent to the flowering time genes in Arabidopsis, primarily genes involved in the photoperiod pathway, little data is available regarding the genes that function in the autonomous pathway in rice. In order to acquire further insight into the control of heading dates in rice, we isolated and conducted an expression analysis on OsFCA, which exhibited 38% sequence homology with Arabidopsis FCA. The N-terminal region of the OsFCA protein appears to be unusually rich in glycine-residues, unlike the N-terminal region found in FCA. However, the genetic structure of OsFCA is, in general, similar to that of FCA. RT-PCR and in silico analyses also showed that alternative splicing and polyadenylation at intron3 were conserved in the genetic expression of OsFCA. We were able to detect alpha, beta, and gamma transcripts, but not the delta transcript, of the OsFCA gene. The beta and gamma transcripts of the OsFCA gene were detected via Northern analysis in the leaves, roots, and flowers of the plant. Flowers in younger stages exhibited higher transcript levels. These data suggest that intron3 may constitute a primary control point in the OsFCA pre-mRNA processing of rice. The overexpression of OsFCA cDNA, driven by the 35S promoter, was shown to partially rescue the late flowering phenotype of the fca mutant, suggesting that the functions of the OsFCA and the FCA are partially overlapped, despite the lack of an apparent FLC homologue in the rice genome. The constitutive expression of OsFCA resulted in no downregulation of FLC, but did result in the weak upregulation of SOC1 in the transgenic Arabidopsis. OsFCA overexpression did not result in a reduction of the gamma transcript levels of FCA in the transgenic Arabidopsis either, thereby suggesting that OsFCA had no effects on the autoregulation of Arabidopsis FCA. All of these results imply conservation and divergence in the functions of FCA between rice and Arabidopsis.
