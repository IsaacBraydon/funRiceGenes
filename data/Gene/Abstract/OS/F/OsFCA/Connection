FCA|OsFCA	OsFY	OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	FCA and FY are flowering time related genes involved in the autonomous flowering pathway in Arabidopsis| FCA interacts with FY to regulate the alternative processing of FCA pre-mRNA| The FCA/FY interaction is also required for the regulation of FLC expression, a major floral repressor in Arabidopsis| The protein-protein interaction between OsFY and OsFCA-gamma, the key feature of their gene function, was also demonstrated using the yeast two-hybrid system| These results indicate that the autonomous flowering pathway is present in monocots, and the regulation through FY and FCA interaction is conserved between monocots and dicots|OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)
FCA|OsFCA	OsFY	Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY	 The FCA protein interacts with FY, a polyadenylation factor, via its WW domain| Here, we found that the OsFCA protein could interact through its WW domain with the following proteins: OsFY, a protein containing a CID domain present in RNA-processing factors such as Pcf11 and Nrd1; a protein similar to splicing factor SF1; a protein similar to FUSE splicing factor; and OsMADS8| Taken together, our data suggest that OsFCA could interact with several proteins other than OsFY through its WW domain and may play several roles in rice|Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY
