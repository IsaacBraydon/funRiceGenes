FCA|OsFCA	floral	OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 The FCA/FY interaction is also required for the regulation of FLC expression, a major floral repressor in Arabidopsis
FCA|OsFCA	stamen	Alternative splicing and expression analysis of OsFCA (FCA in Oryza sativa L.), a gene homologous to FCA in Arabidopsis	 The expression of OsFCA-1 is steady in the leaves of three different stage, but up-regulated in young spikelet of primary branch-differentiating stage and down-regulated in young spikelet of pistil and stamen-differentiating stage
FCA|OsFCA	heading date	Conservation and divergence of FCA function between Arabidopsis and rice	 In order to acquire further insight into the control of heading dates in rice, we isolated and conducted an expression analysis on OsFCA, which exhibited 38% sequence homology with Arabidopsis FCA
FCA|OsFCA	spikelet	Alternative splicing and expression analysis of OsFCA (FCA in Oryza sativa L.), a gene homologous to FCA in Arabidopsis	 The expression of OsFCA-1 is steady in the leaves of three different stage, but up-regulated in young spikelet of primary branch-differentiating stage and down-regulated in young spikelet of pistil and stamen-differentiating stage
FCA|OsFCA	floral	Overexpression of the rFCA RNA recognition motif affects morphologies modifications in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 The FCA floral promotion gene in Arabidopsis encodes a protein, containing two RNA recognition motifs (RRM) and a WW protein interaction domain
FCA|OsFCA	flowering time	Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY	Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY
FCA|OsFCA	flower	OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Recently, alternative RNA processing of OsFCA was observed in rice, which strongly suggested the existence of an autonomous flowering pathway in rice
FCA|OsFCA	root	Conservation and divergence of FCA function between Arabidopsis and rice	 The beta and gamma transcripts of the OsFCA gene were detected via Northern analysis in the leaves, roots, and flowers of the plant
FCA|OsFCA	flower	Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY	The FCA protein is involved in controlling flowering time and plays more general roles in RNA-mediated chromatin silencing in Arabidopsis
FCA|OsFCA	flower	Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY	Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY
FCA|OsFCA	flowering time	OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	FCA and FY are flowering time related genes involved in the autonomous flowering pathway in Arabidopsis
FCA|OsFCA	flower	Conservation and divergence of FCA function between Arabidopsis and rice	 The beta and gamma transcripts of the OsFCA gene were detected via Northern analysis in the leaves, roots, and flowers of the plant
FCA|OsFCA	flower	Conservation and divergence of FCA function between Arabidopsis and rice	 The overexpression of OsFCA cDNA, driven by the 35S promoter, was shown to partially rescue the late flowering phenotype of the fca mutant, suggesting that the functions of the OsFCA and the FCA are partially overlapped, despite the lack of an apparent FLC homologue in the rice genome
