OsFRO1	 Transient expression of OsFRO1: GFP protein fusion revealed that OsFRO1 is localized to the vacuolar membrane in rice protoplast	 Under Fe excess condition, the downregulation of OsFRO1 in the RNAi plants reduced the amount of Fe (II) available for cytoplasm, to alleviate Fe excess toxicity
