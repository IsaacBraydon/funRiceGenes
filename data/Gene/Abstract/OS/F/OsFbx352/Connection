OsFbx352	OsNCED3	A rice F-box gene, OsFbx352, is involved in glucose-delayed seed germination in rice	Overexpression of OsFbx352 led to a reduction in expression of genes responsible for ABA synthesis (OsNced2, OsNced3) and an increase in expression of genes encoding ABA catabolism (OsAba-ox2, OsAba-ox3) in the presence of glucose
