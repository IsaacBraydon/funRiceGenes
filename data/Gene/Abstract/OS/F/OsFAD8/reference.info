A cDNA, designated Osfad8, encoding a chloroplast omega-3 fatty acid desaturase responsible for trienoic fatty acid formation, was isolated from the leaves of Oryza sativa L. by RT-PCR. Southern blot hybridization indicated that a small gene family composed of two copies or closely linked genes exists. RNA in situ hybridization showed that the accumulation of Osfad8 mRNA was abundant in leaves but hardly detectable in roots. The Osfad8 transcript level in leaves was much higher at 15 degrees C than at normal temperature (25 degrees C). In situ hybridization also showed particularly prominent expression of Osfad8 in the palisade layer and spongy parenchyma cells of leaves when exposed to 15 degrees C conditions for 5 days and 10 days. Two transgenic lines (8S-52 and 8S-101) harboring the Osfad8 ORF in sense orientation under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter contained increased levels of hexadecatrienoic (16:3) and linolenic (18:3) fatty acids. When exposed to 2 degrees C for 7 days, the damage observed to the control plants was significantly alleviated in the 8S-52 and 8S-101 lines. The amounts of trienoic fatty acids in an Osfad8 antisense line (8A-35) declined 40.2% compared to the control plants. The 8A-35 plants survived after growth at 44 degrees C for 3 days while the control plants died. These data suggest that Osfad8 encodes a temperature-dependent chloroplast omega-3 fatty acid desaturase.
10.1007-s11240-009-9541-y.pdf	Effects of low temperature stress on rice (Oryza sativa L.) plastid omega-3 desaturase gene, OsFAD8 and its functional analysis using T-DNA mutants	2009	Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture (PCTOC)	Department of Biological Sciences, Pusan National University, Pusan, Republic of Korea	Expression of two rice plastidial omega-3 desaturase genes, OsFAD7 and OsFAD8 under different temperatures has been investigated. Transcript levels of OsFAD7 increased at high temperature; while those of OsFAD8 increased at low temperatures. Fatty acid analysis of homozygous OsFAD8 T-DNA knockout mutant and wild type plants have exhibited changes in fatty acid composition after cold stress, thus confirming that OsFAD8 gene codes for omega-3 fatty acid desaturase activity at low temperature. Photosynthetic efficiency and recovery of OsFAD8 knockout mutants are significantly reduced after cold stress as compared to those of wild type plants. Characterization of OsFAD8 suggests that it has a functional role in maintaining levels of trienoic fatty acids and stress tolerance at low temperatures.
P020120524356755853639.pdf	Identification and evaluation of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase genes for hyperfortifying alpha-linolenic acid in transgenic rice seed	2012	J Exp Bot	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA) deficiency and a skewed of omega6:omega3 fatty acid ratio in the diet are a major explanation for the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. There is a need to enhance the ALA content and to reduce the ratio of linoleic acid (LA) to ALA. Six omega-3 (Delta-15) fatty acid desaturase (FAD) genes were cloned from rice and soybean. The subcellular localizations of the proteins were identified. The FAD genes were introduced into rice under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, GluC, or a Ubi-1 promoter to evaluate their potential in increasing the ALA content in seeds. The ALA contents in the seeds of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized GmFAD3-1 and OsFAD3 overexpression lines increased from 0.36 mg g(-)(1) to 8.57 mg g(-)(1) and 10.06 mg g(-)(1), respectively, which was 23.8- and 27.9-fold higher than that of non-transformants. The trait of high ALA content was stably inheritable over three generations. Homologous OsFAD3 is more active than GmFAD3-1 in catalysing LA conversion to ALA in rice seeds. Overexpression of ER-localized GmFAD3-2/3 and chloroplast-localized OsFAD7/8 had less effect on increasing the ALA content in rice seeds. The GluC promoter is advantageous compared with Ubi-1 in this experimental system. The enhanced ALA was preferentially located at the sn-2 position in triacylglycerols. A meal-size portion of high ALA rice would meet >80% of the daily adult ALA requirement. The ALA-rich rice could be expected to ameliorate much of the global dietary ALA deficiency.
NA	Rice mutants deficient in omega-3 fatty acid desaturase (FAD8) fail to acclimate to cold temperatures	2016	Plant Physiology and Biochemistry	Department of Integrated Biological Science, Department of Molecular Biology, Pusan National University, Busan 609-735, South Korea	To investigate the role of omega-3 fatty acid (FA) desaturase (FAD8) during cold acclimation in higher plants, we characterized three independent T-DNA insertional knock-out mutants of OsFAD8 from rice (Oryza sativa L.). At room temperature (28 C), osfad8 plants exhibited significant alterations in fatty acid (FA) unsaturation for all four investigated plastidic lipid classes. During a 5-d acclimation period at 4 C, further changes in FA unsaturation in both wild-type (WT) and mutant plants varied according to the type of lipid. We also monitored the fluidity of the thylakoid membrane using a threshold temperature to represent the change in fluorescence. The values were altered significantly by both FAD8 mutation and cold acclimation, suggesting that factors other than FAD8 are involved in C18 FA unsaturation and fluctuations in membrane fluidity. Similarly, significant changes were noted for both the mutant and WT samples in terms of their FA compositions as well as activities related to photosystem (PS) I, PSII, and photoprotection. This included the development of non-photochemical quenching and increased zeaxanthin accumulation. Despite the relatively small changes in FA composition during cold acclimation, cold-inducible FAD8 knock-out mutants displayed strong differences in photoprotective activities and a further drop in membrane fluidity. The mutants were more sensitive than WT to short-term low-temperature stress that resulted in increased production of reactive oxygen species after 5 d of chilling. Taken together, our findings suggest that FA unsaturation by OsFAD8 is crucial for the acclimation of higher plants to low-temperature stress.
