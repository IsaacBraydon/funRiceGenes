Ehd1	OsFTL10	Overexpression of OsFTL10 induces early flowering and improves drought tolerance in Oryza sativa L.	 OsFTL10 also regulated Ehd1 and OsMADS51 through a feedback mechanism
Hd3a	OsFTL10	Overexpression of OsFTL10 induces early flowering and improves drought tolerance in Oryza sativa L.	 Furthermore, yeast two hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) results show that OsFTL10 could interact with multiple 14-3-3s, suggesting that OsFTL10 might function in a similar way to Hd3a in promoting rice flowering by forming a FAC complex with 14-3-3, and OsFD1

OsFTL10	OsMADS15|DEP	Overexpression of OsFTL10 induces early flowering and improves drought tolerance in Oryza sativa L.	 Overexpression of OsFTL10 resulted in earlier flowering in rice plants by up to 2 weeks, through up-regulation of the downstream gene OsMADS15
