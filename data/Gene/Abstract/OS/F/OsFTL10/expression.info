OsFTL10	Overexpression of OsFTL10 induces early flowering and improves drought tolerance in Oryza sativa L. |  The expression level of OsFTL10 was high in young seedlings and shown to be induced by GA3 and drought stress |  Overexpression of OsFTL10 resulted in earlier flowering in rice plants by up to 2 weeks, through up-regulation of the downstream gene OsMADS15 |  Further experiments revealed that constitutive expression of OsFTL10 improved the drought tolerance of transgenic plants by stimulating the expression of drought responsive genes	Overexpression of OsFTL10 induces early flowering and improves drought tolerance in Oryza sativa L. |  Overexpression of OsFTL10 resulted in earlier flowering in rice plants by up to 2 weeks, through up-regulation of the downstream gene OsMADS15
