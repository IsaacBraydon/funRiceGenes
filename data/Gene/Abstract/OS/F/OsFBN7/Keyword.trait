OsFBN7	chloroplast	OsFBN7-OsKAS I module promotes formation of plastoglobules clusters in rice chloroplasts.	 Lipidomic analysis of chloroplast subcompartments, including PGs in the OsFBN7 overexpression lines, confirmed that levels of diacylglycerol (DAG), a chloroplast lipid precursor and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), the main chloroplast membrane lipids, were increased in PGs and chloroplasts
OsFBN7	chloroplast	OsFBN7-OsKAS I module promotes formation of plastoglobules clusters in rice chloroplasts.	 In conclusion, this study proposes a new model in which OsFBN7 binds to OsKAS Ia/Ib in chloroplast and enhances their abundance and stability, thereby regulating the chloroplast and PG membrane lipids involved in the formation of PG clusters
OsFBN7	oxidative	OsFBN7-OsKAS I module promotes formation of plastoglobules clusters in rice chloroplasts.	 Furthermore, OsFBN7 enhanced the abundances of OsKAS Ia/Ib in planta and their stability under oxidative and heat stresses
OsFBN7	heat stress	OsFBN7-OsKAS I module promotes formation of plastoglobules clusters in rice chloroplasts.	 Furthermore, OsFBN7 enhanced the abundances of OsKAS Ia/Ib in planta and their stability under oxidative and heat stresses
