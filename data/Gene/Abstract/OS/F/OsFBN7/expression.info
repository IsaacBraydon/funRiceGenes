OsFBN7	 Using molecular genetics and physiobiochemical approaches, we observed that OsFBN7 overexpression promoted PG clustering in rice chloroplasts |  Lipidomic analysis of chloroplast subcompartments, including PGs in the OsFBN7 overexpression lines, confirmed that levels of diacylglycerol (DAG), a chloroplast lipid precursor and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), the main chloroplast membrane lipids, were increased in PGs and chloroplasts |  In addition, RNA sequencing and real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses showed that the expression of the DAG synthetase gene PAP1 and MGDG synthase gene MDG2 was upregulated by OsFBN7	 Using molecular genetics and physiobiochemical approaches, we observed that OsFBN7 overexpression promoted PG clustering in rice chloroplasts |  Lipidomic analysis of chloroplast subcompartments, including PGs in the OsFBN7 overexpression lines, confirmed that levels of diacylglycerol (DAG), a chloroplast lipid precursor and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), the main chloroplast membrane lipids, were increased in PGs and chloroplasts
