Ehd1	OsFLZ2	OsFLZ2 interacts with OsMADS51 to fine-tune rice flowering time.	 Co-expression of OsFLZ2 can destabilize OsMADS51 and weaken its transcriptional activation of the downstream target gene Early heading date 1 (Ehd1)
OsFLZ2	OsMADS51|OsMADS65	OsFLZ2 interacts with OsMADS51 to fine-tune rice flowering time.	OsFLZ2 interacts with OsMADS51 to fine-tune rice flowering time.
OsFLZ2	OsMADS51|OsMADS65	OsFLZ2 interacts with OsMADS51 to fine-tune rice flowering time.	 Biochemical assays showed OsFLZ2 physically interacts with OsMADS51, a flowering activator under short-day (SD) conditions
OsFLZ2	OsMADS51|OsMADS65	OsFLZ2 interacts with OsMADS51 to fine-tune rice flowering time.	 Both OsFLZ2 and OsMADS51 are highly expressed in rice leaves before floral transition under natural SD conditions, and their proteins are colocalized in the nucleus
OsFLZ2	OsMADS51|OsMADS65	OsFLZ2 interacts with OsMADS51 to fine-tune rice flowering time.	 Co-expression of OsFLZ2 can destabilize OsMADS51 and weaken its transcriptional activation of the downstream target gene Early heading date 1 (Ehd1)
OsFLZ2	OsMADS51|OsMADS65	OsFLZ2 interacts with OsMADS51 to fine-tune rice flowering time.	 Taken together, these results indicate that OsFLZ2 can interfere with the function of OsMADS51 to fine-tune rice flowering time
