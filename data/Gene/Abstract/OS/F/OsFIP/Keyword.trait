OsFIP	pollen	The subunit of RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase OsFIP regulates early degeneration of microspores in rice.	 Knocking out of OsFIP results in early degeneration of microspores at the vacuolated pollen stage and simultaneously causes abnormal meiosis in prophase I
OsFIP	panicle	The subunit of RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase OsFIP regulates early degeneration of microspores in rice.	 We further analyzed the profile of rice m6A modification during sporogenesis in both WT and OsFIP loss-of-function plants, and identified a rice panicle specific m6A modification motif &quot;UGWAMH&quot;
OsFIP	meiosis	The subunit of RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase OsFIP regulates early degeneration of microspores in rice.	 Knocking out of OsFIP results in early degeneration of microspores at the vacuolated pollen stage and simultaneously causes abnormal meiosis in prophase I
OsFIP	methyltransferase	The subunit of RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase OsFIP regulates early degeneration of microspores in rice.	The subunit of RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase OsFIP regulates early degeneration of microspores in rice.
OsFIP	methyltransferase	The subunit of RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase OsFIP regulates early degeneration of microspores in rice.	 In this study, we reported that OsFIP and OsMTA2 are the components of m6A RNA methyltransferase complex in rice and uncovered a previously unknown function of m6A RNA methylation in regulation of plant sporogenesis
