NA	Analysis of drought-responsive signalling network in two contrasting rice cultivars using transcriptome-based approach.	2017	Sci Rep	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi - 110021, India.	Traditional cultivars of rice in India exhibit tolerance to drought stress due to their inherent genetic variations. Here we present comparative physiological and transcriptome analyses of two contrasting cultivars, drought tolerant Dhagaddeshi (DD) and susceptible IR20. Microarray analysis revealed several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) exclusively in DD as compared to IR20 seedlings exposed to 3<U+2009>h drought stress. Physiologically, DD seedlings showed higher cell membrane stability and differential ABA accumulation in response to dehydration, coupled with rapid changes in gene expression. Detailed analyses of metabolic pathways enriched in expression data suggest interplay of ABA dependent along with secondary and redox metabolic networks that activate osmotic and detoxification signalling in DD. By co-localization of DEGs with QTLs from databases or published literature for physiological traits of DD and IR20, candidate genes were identified including those underlying major QTL qDTY1.1 in DD. Further, we identified previously uncharacterized genes from both DD and IR20 under drought conditions including OsWRKY51, OsVP1 and confirmed their expression by qPCR in multiple rice cultivars. OsFBK1 was also functionally validated in susceptible PB1 rice cultivar and Arabidopsis for providing drought tolerance. Some of the DEGs mapped to the known QTLs could thus, be of potential significance for marker-assisted breeding.
NA	The OsFBK1 E3 ligase subunit affects anther and root secondary cell wall thickenings by mediating turn-over of a cinnamoyl-CoA reductase.	2018	Plant Physiol	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus CITY: New Delhi STATE: Delhi POSTAL_CODE: 110021 India [IN].	Regulated proteolysis by the Ubiquitin-26S proteasome system challenges transcription and phosphorylation in magnitude and is one of the most important regulatory mechanisms in plants. This article describes the characterization of a rice auxin-responsive Kelch-domain containing F-box protein, OsFBK1, found to be a component of an SCF E3 ligase by interaction studies in yeast. Rice transgenics of OsFBK1 displayed variations in anther and root secondary cell wall content; it could be corroborated by electron/confocal microscopy and lignification studies, with no apparent changes in auxin content/signalling pathway. The presence of U-shaped secondary wall thickenings (or lignin) in the anthers were remarkably less pronounced in plants over-expressing OsFBK1 as compared to wild-type and knock-down transgenics. The roots of the transgenics also displayed differential accumulation of lignin. Y2H anther library screening identified an OsCCR that is homologue of the well-studied Arabidopsis IRX4; OsFBK1-OsCCR interaction was confirmed by fluorescence and immunoprecipitation studies. Degradation of OsCCR mediated by SCFOsFBK1 and 26S proteasome pathway was validated by cell-free experiments in the absence of auxin, indicating that the phenotype observed is due to the direct interaction between OsFBK1 and OsCCR. Interestingly, the OsCCR knock-down transgenics also displayed a decrease in root and anther lignin depositions, suggesting that OsFBK1 plays a role in the development of rice anthers and roots by regulating the cellular levels of a key enzyme controlling lignification.
NA	The Rice EP3 and OsFBK1 E3 ligases alter plant architecture and flower development, and affect transcript accumulation of microRNA pathway genes and their targets.	2021	Plant Biotechnol J	Plant and Crop Sciences Division, School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, LE12 5RD, UK.	ERECTA PANICLE 3 (EP3) and ORYZA SATIVA F-BOX KELCH 1 (OsFBK1) proteins share 57% and 54% sequence identity with the Arabidopsis F-box protein HAWAIIAN SKIRT (HWS). Previously we showed that EP3 is a functional orthologue of HWS. Here we demonstrate that OsFBK1 is another functional orthologue of HWS and show the complexity of interaction between EP3 and OsFBK1 genes at different developmental stages of the plant. qRT-PCR expression analyses and studies of EP3-GFP and OsFBK1-RFP promoter reporter lines demonstrate that although EP3 and OsFBK1 expression can be detected in the same tissues some cells exclusively express EP3 or OsFBK1 whilst others co-express both genes. Loss, reduction or gain of function lines for EP3 and OsFBK1, show that EP3 and OsFBK1 affect plant architecture, organ size, floral organ number and size, floral morphology, pollen viability, grain size and weight. We have identified the putative orthologue genes of the rice microRNA pathway for ORYZA SATIVA DAWDLE (OsDDL) and ORYZA SATIVA SERRATE (OsSE), and demonstrated that EP3 and OsFBK1 affect their transcript levels as well as those of CROWN ROOT DEFECT 1/ORYZA SATIVA Exportin-5 HASTY (CRD1/OsHST), ORYZA SATIVA DICER-LIKE 1 (OsDCL) and ORYZA SATIVA WEAVY LEAF1 (OsWAF1). We show that EP3 affects OsPri-MIR164, OsNAM1 and OsNAC1 transcript levels. OsNAC1 transcripts are modified by OsFBK1, suggesting two independent regulatory pathways, one via EP3 and OsMIR164 and the other via OsFBK1. Our data propose EP3 and OsFBK1 conjointly play similar roles in rice as HWS does in Arabidopsis.
