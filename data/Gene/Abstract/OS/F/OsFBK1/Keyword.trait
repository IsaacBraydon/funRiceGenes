OsFBK1	root	The OsFBK1 E3 ligase subunit affects anther and root secondary cell wall thickenings by mediating turn-over of a cinnamoyl-CoA reductase.	The OsFBK1 E3 ligase subunit affects anther and root secondary cell wall thickenings by mediating turn-over of a cinnamoyl-CoA reductase.
OsFBK1	root	The OsFBK1 E3 ligase subunit affects anther and root secondary cell wall thickenings by mediating turn-over of a cinnamoyl-CoA reductase.	 Rice transgenics of OsFBK1 displayed variations in anther and root secondary cell wall content; it could be corroborated by electron/confocal microscopy and lignification studies, with no apparent changes in auxin content/signalling pathway
OsFBK1	root	The OsFBK1 E3 ligase subunit affects anther and root secondary cell wall thickenings by mediating turn-over of a cinnamoyl-CoA reductase.
