OsFPN1	xylem	Golgi-Localized OsFPN1 is Involved in Co and Ni Transport and Their Detoxification in Rice.	 In addition to the high Co and Ni in brown rice and shoots, the mutant also exhibited high Co and Ni concentrations in the xylem sap, but low concentrations in the roots, suggesting that OsFPN1 is involved in the root-to-shoot translocation of Co and Ni
OsFPN1	growth	Golgi-Localized OsFPN1 is Involved in Co and Ni Transport and Their Detoxification in Rice.	 The growth of 1187_n and CRISPR/Cas9 lines were suppressed under high Co and Ni condition, indicating OsFPN1 is required for the normal growth under high Co and Ni
OsFPN1	detoxification	Golgi-Localized OsFPN1 is Involved in Co and Ni Transport and Their Detoxification in Rice.	Golgi-Localized OsFPN1 is Involved in Co and Ni Transport and Their Detoxification in Rice.
OsFPN1	detoxification	Golgi-Localized OsFPN1 is Involved in Co and Ni Transport and Their Detoxification in Rice.	 These results suggest that OsFPN1 can transport Co and Ni and is vital detoxification in rice
