NA	Antagonistic Transcription Factor Complexes Modulate the Floral Transition in Rice.	2017	Plant Cell	University of Milan CITY: Milan Italy [IT].	Plants measure day or night lengths to coordinate specific developmental changes with a favorable season. In rice (Oryza sativa), the reproductive phase is initiated by exposure to short days when expression of HEADING DATE 3a (Hd3a) and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1) is induced in leaves. The cognate proteins are components of the florigenic signal, and move systemically through the phloem to reach the shoot apical meristem (SAM). In the SAM, they form a transcriptional activation complex with the bZIP transcription factor OsFD1, to start panicle development. Here, we show that Hd3a and RFT1 can form transcriptional activation or repression complexes also in leaves, and feed-back to regulate their own transcription. Activation complexes depend upon OsFD1 to promote flowering. However, additional bZIPs, including Hd3a BINDING REPRESSOR FACTOR 1 (HBF1) and HBF2 form repressor complexes that reduce Hd3a and RFT1 expression to delay flowering. We propose that Hd3a and RFT1 are also active locally in leaves to fine-tune photoperiodic flowering responses.
NA	Hd3a and OsFD1 negatively regulate rice resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola.	2019	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	In rice, Hd3a, GF14 and OsFD1 proteins, forming florigen activation complex, are key components in flowering time regulation. GF14 genes in rice response to biotic and abiotic stress has also been well addressed. The role of GF14e in rice defense has been well studied. However, whether Hd3a and OsFD1 play roles in defense is unclear. In present study, we identified that Hd3a and OsFD1 expression is repressed by Xoo and JA, and validated that Hd3a and OsFD1 negatively regulate resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc). hd3a and osfd1 mutants increase resistance to Xoo and Xoc, and activate JA responsive genes expression. Our data also demonstrate that OsFD1 binds to the promoters of and activates the expression of JAZ genes; Hd3a, cooperating with GF14e, promotes OsFD1 action on JAZ gene expression. The functional confirmation of Hd3a and OsFD1 in rice defense makes them to be promising targets in molecular rice breeding.
NA	Primary Leaf-type Ferredoxin1 Participates in Photosynthetic Electron Transport and Carbon Assimilation in Rice 	2020	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, China.	Ferredoxins (Fd) play a crucial role in photosynthesis by regulating the distribution of electrons to downstream enzymes. Multiple Fd genes have been annotated in the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome; however, their specific functions are not well understood. Here, we report the functional characterization of rice Fd1. Sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis of seven rice Fd proteins, and RT-qPCR analysis showed that rice Fd1 is a primary leaf-type Fd. Electron transfer assays involving NADP+ and cytochrome c indicated that Fd1 can donate electrons from photosystem I (PSI) to ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase. Loss-of-function fd1 mutants showed chlorosis and seedling lethality at the three-leaf stage. The deficiency of Fd1 impaired photosynthetic electron transport, which affected carbon assimilation. Exogenous glucose treatment partially restored the mutant phenotype, suggesting that Fd1 plays an important role in photosynthetic electron transport in rice. In addition, the transcript levels of Fd-dependent genes were affected in fd1 mutants, and the trend was similar to that observed in the fdc2 plants. Together, these results suggest that OsFd1 is the primary Fd in photosynthetic electron transport and carbon assimilation in rice.
