OsFD1	SaM	Antagonistic Transcription Factor Complexes Modulate the Floral Transition in Rice.	 In the SAM, they form a transcriptional activation complex with the bZIP transcription factor OsFD1, to start panicle development
OsFD1	OsFTL10	Overexpression of OsFTL10 induces early flowering and improves drought tolerance in Oryza sativa L.	 Furthermore, yeast two hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) results show that OsFTL10 could interact with multiple 14-3-3s, suggesting that OsFTL10 might function in a similar way to Hd3a in promoting rice flowering by forming a FAC complex with 14-3-3, and OsFD1
