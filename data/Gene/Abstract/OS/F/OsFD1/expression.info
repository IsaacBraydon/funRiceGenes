OsFD1	 In present study, we identified that Hd3a and OsFD1 expression is repressed by Xoo and JA, and validated that Hd3a and OsFD1 negatively regulate resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv |  hd3a and osfd1 mutants increase resistance to Xoo and Xoc, and activate JA responsive genes expression |  Our data also demonstrate that OsFD1 binds to the promoters of and activates the expression of JAZ genes; Hd3a, cooperating with GF14e, promotes OsFD1 action on JAZ gene expression
