OsFKBP20-1b	abiotic stress	OsFKBP20-1b interacts with the splicing factor OsSR45 and participates in the environmental stress response at the post-transcriptional level in rice.	 Expression of OsFKBP20-1b was highly upregulated under various abiotic stresses
OsFKBP20-1b	abiotic stress	OsFKBP20-1b interacts with the splicing factor OsSR45 and participates in the environmental stress response at the post-transcriptional level in rice.	 Moreover genetic analysis revealed that OsFKBP20-1b positively affected transcription and pre-mRNA splicing of stress-responsive genes under abiotic stress conditions
