OsFKBP20-1b	OsSR45	Nuclear OsFKBP20-1b maintains SR34 stability and promotes the splicing of retained introns upon ABA exposure in rice.	 We also analyzed whether OsFKBP20-1b and the splicing factors OsSR34 and OsSR45 function together in AS using protoplast transfection assays
OsFKBP20-1b	OsSR45	Nuclear OsFKBP20-1b maintains SR34 stability and promotes the splicing of retained introns upon ABA exposure in rice.	 In addition, interacting proteins, OsSR34 and OsSR45, regulate the splicing of the same retained introns as OsFKBP20-1b after ABA treatment
