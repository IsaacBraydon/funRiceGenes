NA	OsFKBP20-1b interacts with the splicing factor OsSR45 and participates in the environmental stress response at the post-transcriptional level in rice.	2020	Plant J	Plant Systems Engineering Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon, 34141, Korea.	Sessile plants have evolved distinct mechanisms to respond and adapt to adverse environmental conditions through diverse mechanisms including RNA processing. While the role of RNA processing in the stress response is well understood in Arabidopsis thaliana, limited information is available in rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we show that OsFKBP20-1b, belonging to the immunophilin family, interacts with the splicing factor OsSR45 in both nuclear speckles and cytoplasmic foci and plays an essential role in post-transcriptional regulation of abiotic stress response. Expression of OsFKBP20-1b was highly upregulated under various abiotic stresses. Moreover genetic analysis revealed that OsFKBP20-1b positively affected transcription and pre-mRNA splicing of stress-responsive genes under abiotic stress conditions. In osfkbp20-1b loss-of-function mutants, expression of stress-responsive genes was downregulated, while that of their splicing variants was increased. Conversely, in plants overexpressing OsFKBP20-1b, the expression of the same stress-responsive genes was strikingly upregulated under abiotic stress. In vivo experiments demonstrated that OsFKBP20-1b directly maintains protein stability of OsSR45 splicing factor. Furthermore, we found that the plant-specific OsFKBP20-1b gene has uniquely evolved as a paralog only in some Poaceae species. Together, our findings suggest that OsFKBP20-1b-mediated RNA processing contributes to stress adaptation in rice.
NA	Nuclear OsFKBP20-1b maintains SR34 stability and promotes the splicing of retained introns upon ABA exposure in rice.	2023	New Phytol	Plant Systems Engineering Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon, 34141, South Korea.	Alternative splicing (AS) is a critical means by which plants respond to changes in the environment, but few splicing factors contributing to AS have been reported and functionally characterized in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, we explored the function and molecular mechanism of the spliceosome-associated protein OsFKBP20-1b during AS. We determined the AS landscape of wild-type and osfkbp20-1b knockout plants upon abscisic acid (ABA) treatment by transcriptome deep sequencing. To capture the dynamics of translating intron-containing mRNAs, we blocked transcription with cordycepin and performed polysome profiling. We also analyzed whether OsFKBP20-1b and the splicing factors OsSR34 and OsSR45 function together in AS using protoplast transfection assays. We show that OsFKBP20-1b interacts with OsSR34 and regulates its stability, suggesting a role as a chaperone-like protein in the spliceosome. OsFKBP20-1b facilitates the splicing of mRNAs with retained introns after ABA treatment; some of these mRNAs are translatable and encode functional transcriptional regulators of stress-responsive genes. In addition, interacting proteins, OsSR34 and OsSR45, regulate the splicing of the same retained introns as OsFKBP20-1b after ABA treatment. Our findings reveal that spliceosome-associated immunophilin functions in alternative RNA splicing in rice by positively regulating the splicing of retained introns to limit ABA response.
