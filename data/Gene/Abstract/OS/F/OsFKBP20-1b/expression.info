OsFKBP20-1b	 Expression of OsFKBP20-1b was highly upregulated under various abiotic stresses |  In osfkbp20-1b loss-of-function mutants, expression of stress-responsive genes was downregulated, while that of their splicing variants was increased |  Conversely, in plants overexpressing OsFKBP20-1b, the expression of the same stress-responsive genes was strikingly upregulated under abiotic stress
