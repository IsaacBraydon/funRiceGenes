Osfuct	OsXylT|RCN11	Inactivation of the ¦Â (1, 2)-xylosyltransferase and the ¦Á (1, 3)-fucosyltransferase gene in rice (Oryza sativa) by multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 strategy	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated OsXylT and OsFucT mutation caused the elimination of plant-specific ¦Â1,2-xylose and ¦Á1,3-fucose residues on glycoproteins in rice, which is the first report of OsXylT/OsFucT double KO mutation in rice
Osfuct	OsXylT|RCN11	Inactivation of the ¦Â (1, 2)-xylosyltransferase and the ¦Á (1, 3)-fucosyltransferase gene in rice (Oryza sativa) by multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 strategy	 As an effort to use plants as a platform to produce biopharmaceuticals, the plant-specific N-glycan genes of rice (Oryza sativa), ¦Â1,2-xylT (OsXylT) and ¦Á1,3-FucT (OsFucT), were knocked out using multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 technology
Osfuct	OsXylT|RCN11	Inactivation of the ¦Â (1, 2)-xylosyltransferase and the ¦Á (1, 3)-fucosyltransferase gene in rice (Oryza sativa) by multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 strategy	 Thus, we suggest that each enzymes working on the process for complex N-glycan biosynthesis might independently act in rice, hence the double knock-out of both OsXylT and OsFucT might be not enough to humanize N-glycan structure in rice
