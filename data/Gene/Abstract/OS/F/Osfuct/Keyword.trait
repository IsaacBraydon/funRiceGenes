Osfuct	pollen	Lack of the ¦Á1,3-Fucosyltransferase Gene (Osfuct) Affects Anther Development and Pollen Viability in Rice.	 We characterized an Osfuct mutant that displayed pleiotropic developmental defects, such as impaired anther and pollen development, diminished growth, shorter plant height, fewer tillers, and shorter panicle length and internodes under field conditions
Osfuct	panicle	Lack of the ¦Á1,3-Fucosyltransferase Gene (Osfuct) Affects Anther Development and Pollen Viability in Rice.	 We characterized an Osfuct mutant that displayed pleiotropic developmental defects, such as impaired anther and pollen development, diminished growth, shorter plant height, fewer tillers, and shorter panicle length and internodes under field conditions
