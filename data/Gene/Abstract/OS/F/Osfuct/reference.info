NA	Lack of the ¦Á1,3-Fucosyltransferase Gene (Osfuct) Affects Anther Development and Pollen Viability in Rice.	2018	Int J Mol Sci	Metabolic Engineering Division, Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, National Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Rural Development Administration, Jeonju 54874, Korea. jssim@korea.kr.	N-linked glycosylation is one of the key post-translational modifications. &amp;alpha;1,3-Fucosyltransferase (OsFucT) is responsible for transferring &amp;alpha;1,3-linked fucose residues to the glycoprotein N-glycan in plants. We characterized an Osfuct mutant that displayed pleiotropic developmental defects, such as impaired anther and pollen development, diminished growth, shorter plant height, fewer tillers, and shorter panicle length and internodes under field conditions. In addition, the anthers were curved, the pollen grains were shriveled, and pollen viability and pollen number per anther decreased dramatically in the mutant. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analyses of the N-glycans revealed that &amp;alpha;1,3-fucose was lacking in the N-glycan structure of the mutant. Mutant complementation revealed that the phenotype was caused by loss of Osfuct function. Transcriptome profiling also showed that several genes essential for plant developmental processes were significantly altered in the mutant, including protein kinases, transcription factors, genes involved in metabolism, genes related to protein synthesis, and hypothetical proteins. Moreover, the mutant exhibited sensitivity to an increased concentration of salt. This study facilitates a further understanding of the function of genes mediating N-glycan modification and anther and pollen development in rice.
NA	Inactivation of the ¦Â (1, 2)-xylosyltransferase and the ¦Á (1, 3)-fucosyltransferase gene in rice (Oryza sativa) by multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 strategy	2021	Plant Cell Rep	Department of Molecular Biology, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Jeollabuk-do, 561-756, Republic of Korea.	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated OsXylT and OsFucT mutation caused the elimination of plant-specific ¦Â1,2-xylose and ¦Á1,3-fucose residues on glycoproteins in rice, which is the first report of OsXylT/OsFucT double KO mutation in rice. N-glycosylation pathway is the one of post-translational mechanism and is known as highly conserved in eukaryotes. However, the process for complex-N-glycan modification is different between mammals and plants. In plant-specific manner, ¦Â1,2-xylose and ¦Á1,3-fucose residues are transferred to N-glycan core structure on glycoproteins by ¦Â1,2-xylosyltransferase (¦Â1,2-XylT) and ¦Á1,3-fucosyltransferase (¦Á1,3-FucT), respectively. As an effort to use plants as a platform to produce biopharmaceuticals, the plant-specific N-glycan genes of rice (Oryza sativa), ¦Â1,2-xylT (OsXylT) and ¦Á1,3-FucT (OsFucT), were knocked out using multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The double knock-out lines were found to have frameshift mutations by INDELs. Both ¦Â1,2-xylose and ¦Á1,3-fucose residues in the lines were not detected in Western blot analysis. Consistently, there was no peak corresponding to the N-glycans in MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. Although ¦Á1,3-fucose and ¦Â1,2-xylose residues were not detected in the line, other plant-specific residues of ¦Â1,3-galactose and ¦Á1,4-fucose were detected. Thus, we suggest that each enzymes working on the process for complex N-glycan biosynthesis might independently act in rice, hence the double knock-out of both OsXylT and OsFucT might be not enough to humanize N-glycan structure in rice.
