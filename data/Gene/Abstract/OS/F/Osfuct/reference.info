NA	Lack of the ¦Á1,3-Fucosyltransferase Gene (Osfuct) Affects Anther Development and Pollen Viability in Rice.	2018	Int J Mol Sci	Metabolic Engineering Division, Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, National Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Rural Development Administration, Jeonju 54874, Korea. jssim@korea.kr.	N-linked glycosylation is one of the key post-translational modifications. &amp;alpha;1,3-Fucosyltransferase (OsFucT) is responsible for transferring &amp;alpha;1,3-linked fucose residues to the glycoprotein N-glycan in plants. We characterized an Osfuct mutant that displayed pleiotropic developmental defects, such as impaired anther and pollen development, diminished growth, shorter plant height, fewer tillers, and shorter panicle length and internodes under field conditions. In addition, the anthers were curved, the pollen grains were shriveled, and pollen viability and pollen number per anther decreased dramatically in the mutant. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analyses of the N-glycans revealed that &amp;alpha;1,3-fucose was lacking in the N-glycan structure of the mutant. Mutant complementation revealed that the phenotype was caused by loss of Osfuct function. Transcriptome profiling also showed that several genes essential for plant developmental processes were significantly altered in the mutant, including protein kinases, transcription factors, genes involved in metabolism, genes related to protein synthesis, and hypothetical proteins. Moreover, the mutant exhibited sensitivity to an increased concentration of salt. This study facilitates a further understanding of the function of genes mediating N-glycan modification and anther and pollen development in rice.
