OsFlot	cell death	Overexpression of BAX INHIBITOR-1 Links Plasma Membrane Microdomain Proteins to Stress.	Loss-of-function analysis demonstrated that FLOT and HIR3 are required for cell death by oxidative stress and salicylic acid, suggesting that the decreased levels of these proteins directly contribute to the stress-tolerant phenotypes in BI-1-overexpressing rice cells.
