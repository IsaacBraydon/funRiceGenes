Cryptochromes (CRYs) are a class of photoreceptors that perceive blue/ultraviolet-A light of the visible spectrum to mediate a vast number of physiological responses in bacteria, fungi, animals and plants. In the present study, we have characterized OsCRY2 in a photoperiod sensitive indica variety, Basmati 370, by generating and analyzing overexpression (OE) and knock-down (KD) transgenic lines. The OsCRY2(OE) lines displayed dwarfism as shown in their reduced plant height and leaf length, attributed largely by an overall reduction in their cell size. The OsCRY2(OE) lines flowered significantly earlier and showed shorter and broader seeds with an overall reduced seed weight. The OsCRY2(KD) lines showed contrasting phenotypes, such as increased plant height and delayed flowering, however, decreased seed size and weight were also observed in the KD lines, along with reduced spikelet fertility and high seed shattering rate in mature panicles. Novel interactions were confirmed between OsCRY2 and members of ZEITLUPE family of blue/ultraviolet-A light photoreceptors, encoded by OsFBO8, OsFBO9 and OsFBO10 which are orthologous to ZEITLUPE (ZTL), LOV KELCH PROTEIN2 (LKP2) and FLAVIN BINDING, KELCH REPEAT F-BOX1 (FKF1), respectively, of Arabidopsis thaliana. Since FKF1 is known to play a role in regulating photoperiodic flowering, OsFBO10 was chosen for further studies. OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 interacted in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the cell and cross-regulated the expression of each other. They were also found to regulate the expression of several genes involved in photoperiodic flowering in rice. Both OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 played a positive role in photomorphogenic responses in different light conditions. The physical interaction of OsCRY2 with OsFBO10, their involvement in common physiological and developmental pathways and their cross-regulation of each other suggest that the two photoreceptors may regulate common developmental pathways in plants, either jointly or redundantly.
