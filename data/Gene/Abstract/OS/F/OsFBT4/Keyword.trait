OsFBT4	stress	Overexpression of a rice Tubby-like protein-encoding gene, OsFBT4, confers tolerance to abiotic stresses.	 Here, we investigated the role of OsFBT4 in abiotic stress signalling
OsFBT4	stress	Overexpression of a rice Tubby-like protein-encoding gene, OsFBT4, confers tolerance to abiotic stresses.	 Overexpression of OsFBT4 caused upregulation of several ABA-regulated/independent stress-responsive genes at more advanced stages of growth, showing wide and intricate roles played by OsFBT4 in stress signalling
OsFBT4	abiotic stress	Overexpression of a rice Tubby-like protein-encoding gene, OsFBT4, confers tolerance to abiotic stresses.	 Here, we investigated the role of OsFBT4 in abiotic stress signalling
OsFBT4	abiotic stress	Overexpression of a rice Tubby-like protein-encoding gene, OsFBT4, confers tolerance to abiotic stresses.	 The OsFBT4 transcript was strongly upregulated in response to different abiotic stresses in rice, including exogenous ABA
OsFBT4	ABA	Overexpression of a rice Tubby-like protein-encoding gene, OsFBT4, confers tolerance to abiotic stresses.	 The OsFBT4 transcript was strongly upregulated in response to different abiotic stresses in rice, including exogenous ABA
OsFBT4	biotic stress	Overexpression of a rice Tubby-like protein-encoding gene, OsFBT4, confers tolerance to abiotic stresses.	 Here, we investigated the role of OsFBT4 in abiotic stress signalling
OsFBT4	biotic stress	Overexpression of a rice Tubby-like protein-encoding gene, OsFBT4, confers tolerance to abiotic stresses.	 The OsFBT4 transcript was strongly upregulated in response to different abiotic stresses in rice, including exogenous ABA
OsFBT4	plasma membrane	Overexpression of a rice Tubby-like protein-encoding gene, OsFBT4, confers tolerance to abiotic stresses.	 The OsFBT4 showed interaction with several OSKs (Oryza SKP1 proteins) and localized to the plasma membrane (PM)
