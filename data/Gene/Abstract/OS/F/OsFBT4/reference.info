The OsFBT4 belongs to a small sub-class of rice F-box proteins called TLPs (Tubby-like proteins) containing the conserved N-terminal F-box domain and a C-terminal Tubby domain. These proteins have largely been implicated in both abiotic and biotic stress responses, besides developmental roles in plants. Here, we investigated the role of OsFBT4 in abiotic stress signalling. The OsFBT4 transcript was strongly upregulated in response to different abiotic stresses in rice, including exogenous ABA. When ectopically expressed, in Arabidopsis, under a constitutive CaMV 35S promoter, the overexpression (OE) caused hypersensitivity to most abiotic stresses, including ABA, during seed germination and early seedling growth. At the 5-day-old seedling growth stage, the OE conferred tolerance to all abiotic stresses. The OE lines displayed significant tolerance to salinity and water deficit at the mature growth stage. The stomatal size and density were seen to be altered in the OE lines, accompanied by hypersensitivity to ABA and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and a reduced water loss rate. Overexpression of OsFBT4 caused upregulation of several ABA-regulated/independent stress-responsive genes at more advanced stages of growth, showing wide and intricate roles played by OsFBT4 in stress signalling. The OsFBT4 showed interaction with several OSKs (Oryza SKP1 proteins) and localized to the plasma membrane (PM). The protein translocates to the nucleus, in response to oxidative and osmotic stresses, but failed to show transactivation activity in the yeast system. The OE lines also displayed morphological deviations from the wild-type (WT) plants, suggesting a role of the gene also in plant development.
