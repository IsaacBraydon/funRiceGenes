OsFUG1	panicle architecture	Insights into the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the rice SUMOylation machinery and into the role of two rice SUMO proteases.	Data suggests a role for OsFUG1 in seed-related stages that influence panicle architecture and fertility
OsFUG1	fertility	Insights into the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the rice SUMOylation machinery and into the role of two rice SUMO proteases.	Data suggests a role for OsFUG1 in seed-related stages that influence panicle architecture and fertility
OsFUG1	internode elongation	Insights into the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the rice SUMOylation machinery and into the role of two rice SUMO proteases.	Although the differences are not statistically significant, both OsELS1 and OsFUG1 KO lines showed decreased internode elongation compared to the respective controls
OsFUG1	development	Insights into the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the rice SUMOylation machinery and into the role of two rice SUMO proteases.	OsFUG1 KO also significantly impacts development and fertility
