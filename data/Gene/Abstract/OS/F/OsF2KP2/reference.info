China.	Starch accounts for about 80-85% of the dry weight of grains and determines yield by impact on grain weight. And, the content and composition of starch also determine appearance, eating, cooking and nutritional quality of rice. By coordinating crucial reactions of the primary carbohydrate metabolism in all eukaryotes, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P(2)) is a traffic signal in metabolism. However, the metabolic regulation of starch in plant sink tissues by Fru-2,6-P(2) remains unclear. Here we isolated rice mutant floury endosperm23 (flo23) which has opaque endosperm and anomalous compound starch grains (SGs). flo23 mutant grains had reduced contents of starch, lipids and proteins. Map-based cloning and genetic complementation experiments showed that FLO23 encodes a cytoplasmic Fructose-6-phosphate-2-kinase/Fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (F2KP). Mutation of OsF2KP2 decreased Fru-2,6-P(2) content in endosperm cells, leading to drastically reduced phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and pyruvate contents and disordered glycolysis and energy metabolism. The results imply that OsF2KP2 participates in the glycolytic pathway by providing precursors and energy for synthesis of grain storage compounds.
