OsF2KP2	grain	Fructose-6-phosphate-2-kinase/Fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase Regulates Energy Metabolism and Synthesis of Storage Products in Developing Rice Endosperm.	 The results imply that OsF2KP2 participates in the glycolytic pathway by providing precursors and energy for synthesis of grain storage compounds
OsF2KP2	endosperm	Fructose-6-phosphate-2-kinase/Fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase Regulates Energy Metabolism and Synthesis of Storage Products in Developing Rice Endosperm.	 Mutation of OsF2KP2 decreased Fru-2,6-P(2) content in endosperm cells, leading to drastically reduced phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and pyruvate contents and disordered glycolysis and energy metabolism
