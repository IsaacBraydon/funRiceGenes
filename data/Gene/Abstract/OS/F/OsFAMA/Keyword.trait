OsFAMA	stoma differentiation	Multiple transcriptional factors control stomata development in rice	OsFAMA/OsICE influences subsidiary mother cell asymmetric division and mature stoma differentiation.
OsFAMA	cell fate transition	Multiple transcriptional factors control stomata development in rice	These results indicated that OsFAMA controlled the cell fate transition from GMCs to GCs and from SMCs to SCs and affected SMC asymmetrical division.
OsFAMA	stomatal development	Multiple transcriptional factors control stomata development in rice	OsICE1 and OsICE2 interact with OsSPCH1, OsSPCH2, OsMUTE or OsFAMA to specify three cell fate transition steps during stomatal development
