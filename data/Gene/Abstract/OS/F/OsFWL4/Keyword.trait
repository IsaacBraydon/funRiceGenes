OsFWL4	seedlings	The rice &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene family member OsFWL4 is involved in the translocation of cadmium from roots to shoots.	 Real-time PCR analysis showed that OsFWL4 expression was induced by CdCl2stress in rice seedlings
OsFWL4	resistance	The rice &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene family member OsFWL4 is involved in the translocation of cadmium from roots to shoots.	2-like&quot; (OsFWL) affects Cd resistance in yeast, and OsFWL4 mediates the translocation of Cd from roots to shoots
OsFWL4	resistance	The rice &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene family member OsFWL4 is involved in the translocation of cadmium from roots to shoots.	 The Cd contents of OsFWL3-, -4-, -6- and -7-transformed Cd(II)-sensitive yeast mutant ycf1 cells were strongly decreased compared with those of empty vector, with the strongest resistance to Cd observed in cells expressing OsFWL4
OsFWL4	resistance	The rice &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene family member OsFWL4 is involved in the translocation of cadmium from roots to shoots.	 Evaluation of truncated and site-directed mutation derivatives revealed that the CCXXG motifs near the second transmembrane region of OsFWL4 are involved in Cd resistance in yeast
OsFWL4	transporter	The rice &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene family member OsFWL4 is involved in the translocation of cadmium from roots to shoots.	 These results suggest that OsFWL4 might act directly as a transporter and is involved in the translocation of Cd from roots to shoots in rice
OsFWL4	cadmium	The rice &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene family member OsFWL4 is involved in the translocation of cadmium from roots to shoots.	The rice &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene family member OsFWL4 is involved in the translocation of cadmium from roots to shoots.
