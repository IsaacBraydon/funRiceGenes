OsFIF3	 Moreover, FLO2 and SUT1 with abundant OsFIF3 binding signals showed significant expression reduction in OsFIF3 overexpression lines, further confirming OsFIF3&#x27;s role in starch metabolism regulation and energy material allocation |  Taken together, these findings show that the overexpression of OsFIF3 inhibits the expression of FLO2 and SUT1, thereby increasing grain chalkiness and affecting grain weight	 Moreover, FLO2 and SUT1 with abundant OsFIF3 binding signals showed significant expression reduction in OsFIF3 overexpression lines, further confirming OsFIF3&#x27;s role in starch metabolism regulation and energy material allocation |  Taken together, these findings show that the overexpression of OsFIF3 inhibits the expression of FLO2 and SUT1, thereby increasing grain chalkiness and affecting grain weight
