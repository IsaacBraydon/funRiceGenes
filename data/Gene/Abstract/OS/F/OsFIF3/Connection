FLO2	OsFIF3	Regulation of Grain Chalkiness and Starch Metabolism by FLO2 Interaction Factor 3, a bHLH Transcription Factor in Oryza sativa.	 Here, FLO2 interaction factor 3 (OsFIF3), a bHLH transcription factor, was identified and analyzed in Oryza sativa
FLO2	OsFIF3	Regulation of Grain Chalkiness and Starch Metabolism by FLO2 Interaction Factor 3, a bHLH Transcription Factor in Oryza sativa.	 The DAP-seq (DNA affinity purification sequencing) results showed that OsFIF3 could affect the transcriptional accumulation of β-amylase 1, α-amylase isozyme 2A-like, pectinesterase 11, β-glucosidase 28 like, pectinesterase, sucrose transport protein 1 (SUT1), and FLO2 through the binding of the CACGTG motif on their promoters
FLO2	OsFIF3	Regulation of Grain Chalkiness and Starch Metabolism by FLO2 Interaction Factor 3, a bHLH Transcription Factor in Oryza sativa.	 Moreover, FLO2 and SUT1 with abundant OsFIF3 binding signals showed significant expression reduction in OsFIF3 overexpression lines, further confirming OsFIF3&#x27;s role in starch metabolism regulation and energy material allocation
FLO2	OsFIF3	Regulation of Grain Chalkiness and Starch Metabolism by FLO2 Interaction Factor 3, a bHLH Transcription Factor in Oryza sativa.	 Taken together, these findings show that the overexpression of OsFIF3 inhibits the expression of FLO2 and SUT1, thereby increasing grain chalkiness and affecting grain weight
