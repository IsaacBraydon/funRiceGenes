OsFBX322	leaf	[PROVISIONAL] Overexpression of rice F-box protein OsFBX322 confers increased sensitivity to gamma irradiation in Arabidopsis.	 Transient expression of a GFP-OsFBX322 fusion protein in tobacco leaf epidermis indicated that OsFBX322 localized at the nucleus
OsFBX322	defense	[PROVISIONAL] Overexpression of rice F-box protein OsFBX322 confers increased sensitivity to gamma irradiation in Arabidopsis.	 These results suggest that OsFBX322 play the negative role in defense response to radiation in plants
OsFBX322	defense response	[PROVISIONAL] Overexpression of rice F-box protein OsFBX322 confers increased sensitivity to gamma irradiation in Arabidopsis.	 These results suggest that OsFBX322 play the negative role in defense response to radiation in plants
OsFBX322	nucleus	[PROVISIONAL] Overexpression of rice F-box protein OsFBX322 confers increased sensitivity to gamma irradiation in Arabidopsis.	 Transient expression of a GFP-OsFBX322 fusion protein in tobacco leaf epidermis indicated that OsFBX322 localized at the nucleus
OsFBX322	epidermis	[PROVISIONAL] Overexpression of rice F-box protein OsFBX322 confers increased sensitivity to gamma irradiation in Arabidopsis.	 Transient expression of a GFP-OsFBX322 fusion protein in tobacco leaf epidermis indicated that OsFBX322 localized at the nucleus
