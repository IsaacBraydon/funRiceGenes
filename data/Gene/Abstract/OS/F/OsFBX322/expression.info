OsFBX322	[PROVISIONAL] Overexpression of rice F-box protein OsFBX322 confers increased sensitivity to gamma irradiation in Arabidopsis. |  OsFBX322 expression patterns in response to radiation were confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR |  Transient expression of a GFP-OsFBX322 fusion protein in tobacco leaf epidermis indicated that OsFBX322 localized at the nucleus |  To determine the effect of OsFBX322 expression on radiation response, OsFBX322 was overexpressed in Arabidopsis |  In addition, we obtained four co-expression genes of OsFBX322 by specific co-expression networks using the ARANCE	[PROVISIONAL] Overexpression of rice F-box protein OsFBX322 confers increased sensitivity to gamma irradiation in Arabidopsis.
