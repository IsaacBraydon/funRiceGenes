OsCLF|SDG711	OsFIE1|Epi-df	Imprinted Gene OsFIE1 Modulates Rice Seed Development by Influencing the Nutrient Metabolism and Modifying Genome H3K27me3.	OsFIE1 specifically expressed in endosperm, and mRNA of OsFIE1 also enriched in inner seed coat with the corresponding PcG members of OsiEZ1 and OsCLF
OsFIE1|Epi-df	OsiEZ1|OsSET1|SDG718	Imprinted Gene OsFIE1 Modulates Rice Seed Development by Influencing the Nutrient Metabolism and Modifying Genome H3K27me3.	OsFIE1 specifically expressed in endosperm, and mRNA of OsFIE1 also enriched in inner seed coat with the corresponding PcG members of OsiEZ1 and OsCLF
OsFIE1|Epi-df	OsFIE2	Functional divergence of two duplicated Fertilization Independent Endosperm genes in rice with respect to seed development	 OsFIE1 and OsFIE2 are two FIE homologs in the rice genome
OsFIE1|Epi-df	OsFIE2	Functional divergence of two duplicated Fertilization Independent Endosperm genes in rice with respect to seed development	 Here, we showed that OsFIE1 probably duplicated from OsFIE2 after the origin of the tribe Oryzeae, but has a specific expression pattern and methylation landscape
OsFIE1|Epi-df	OsFIE2	Functional divergence of two duplicated Fertilization Independent Endosperm genes in rice with respect to seed development	 During evolution, OsFIE1 underwent a less intensive purifying selection than did OsFIE2
OsFIE1|Epi-df	OsFIE2	Functional divergence of two duplicated Fertilization Independent Endosperm genes in rice with respect to seed development	 Ectopic expression of OsFIE1, but not OsFIE2, was deleterious to vegetative growth in a dose-dependent manner
