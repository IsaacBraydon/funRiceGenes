OsFIE1|Epi-df	 Western blot showed that the complex of OsFIE1-PcG in endosperm regulated the expression of target genes by genome H3K27me3 modification	 The RNAi of OsFIE1 and homozygous T-DNA insertion mutant osfie1 led to smaller seed, delayed embryo development, smaller aleurone layer cell, and decreased seed set rate |  Meanwhile, the contents of seed storage proteins and Ile, Leu, and Val were decreased, accompanied with the down-regulation of multiple transcription factors, storage protein synthesis and amino acid metabolism related genes in OsFIE1-RNAi lines and osfie1
