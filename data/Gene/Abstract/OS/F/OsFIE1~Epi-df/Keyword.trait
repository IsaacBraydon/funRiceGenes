OsFIE1|Epi-df	floral	Identification and characterization of an epi-allele of FIE1 reveals a regulatory linkage between two epigenetic marks in rice	 Here, we identify a gain-of-function epi-allele (Epi-df) of rice (Oryza sativa) FIE1; this allele causes a dwarf stature and various floral defects that are inherited in a dominant fashion
OsFIE1|Epi-df	dwarf	Identification and characterization of an epi-allele of FIE1 reveals a regulatory linkage between two epigenetic marks in rice	 Here, we identify a gain-of-function epi-allele (Epi-df) of rice (Oryza sativa) FIE1; this allele causes a dwarf stature and various floral defects that are inherited in a dominant fashion
OsFIE1|Epi-df	endosperm	Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes	 OsFIE1 is expressed only in endosperm; the maternal copy is expressed while the paternal copy is not active
