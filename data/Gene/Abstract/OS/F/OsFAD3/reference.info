The omega-3 fatty acid desaturases are membrane-bound enzymes catalyzing the conversion of linoleic acid to linolenic acid in lipids, and are located both in the microsome and plastid envelopes as two different isoforms. A cDNA encoding the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase (OsFAD3) and the corresponding genomic clone were isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.). The OsFAD3 gene was composed of 8 exons and 7 introns. A microsatellite was present in the second exon of the OsFAD3 gene, showing polymorphism between Indica and Japonica rice varieties. The mapping of this microsatellite showed that the OsFAD3 gene was located on chromosome 11. Expression of the OsFAD3 cDNA in tobacco hairy root tissues and subsequent analysis of fatty acid compositions demonstrated the activity of the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase. The OsFAD3 mRNA was abundant in root tissues, but was hardly detectable in leaves. In root tissues, a high level of the OsFAD3 mRNA was observed at 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C, with its level decreasing markedly at temperatures below 10 degrees C. The accumulation of the OsFAD3 mRNA in leaf tissues remained at quite low levels, both at normal growth temperatures and at chilling temperatures. Similar temperature responses of the OsFAD3 gene were observed both in chilling- tolerant and in chilling-intolerant rice cultivars.

There is a need to enhance the ALA content and to reduce the ratio of linoleic acid (LA) to ALA. Six omega-3 (Delta-15) fatty acid desaturase (FAD) genes were cloned from rice and soybean. The subcellular localizations of the proteins were identified. The FAD genes were introduced into rice under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, GluC, or a Ubi-1 promoter to evaluate their potential in increasing the ALA content in seeds. The ALA contents in the seeds of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized GmFAD3-1 and OsFAD3 overexpression lines increased from 0.36 mg g(-)(1) to 8.57 mg g(-)(1) and 10.06 mg g(-)(1), respectively, which was 23.8- and 27.9-fold higher than that of non-transformants. The trait of high ALA content was stably inheritable over three generations. Homologous OsFAD3 is more active than GmFAD3-1 in catalysing LA conversion to ALA in rice seeds. Overexpression of ER-localized GmFAD3-2/3 and chloroplast-localized OsFAD7/8 had less effect on increasing the ALA content in rice seeds. The GluC promoter is advantageous compared with Ubi-1 in this experimental system. The enhanced ALA was preferentially located at the sn-2 position in triacylglycerols. A meal-size portion of high ALA rice would meet >80% of the daily adult ALA requirement. The ALA-rich rice could be expected to ameliorate much of the global dietary ALA deficiency.
