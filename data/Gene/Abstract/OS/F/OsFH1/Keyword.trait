OsFH1	root hair	Formin homology 1 (OsFH1) regulates root-hair elongation in rice (Oryza sativa)	The mutant Osfh1 exhibited root-hair defects when roots were grown submerged in solution, and mutant roots produced normal root hairs in the air
OsFH1	root	Formin homology 1 (OsFH1) regulates root-hair elongation in rice (Oryza sativa)	Subsequent analysis of two additional T-DNA mutants verified that OsFH1 is important for root-hair elongation
OsFH1	root	Formin homology 1 (OsFH1) regulates root-hair elongation in rice (Oryza sativa)	Further studies revealed that the action of OsFH1 on root-hair growth is dependent on growth conditions
OsFH1	root	Formin homology 1 (OsFH1) regulates root-hair elongation in rice (Oryza sativa)	The mutant Osfh1 exhibited root-hair defects when roots were grown submerged in solution, and mutant roots produced normal root hairs in the air
OsFH1	root	Formin homology 1 (OsFH1) regulates root-hair elongation in rice (Oryza sativa)	This study shows that OsFH1 plays a significant role in root-hair elongation in a growth condition-dependent manner
