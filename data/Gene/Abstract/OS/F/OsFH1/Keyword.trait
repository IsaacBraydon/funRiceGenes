OsFH1	root hair	Formin homology 1 (OsFH1) regulates root-hair elongation in rice (Oryza sativa)	 The mutant Osfh1 exhibited root-hair defects when roots were grown submerged in solution, and mutant roots produced normal root hairs in the air
OsFH1	root	Formin homology 1 (OsFH1) regulates root-hair elongation in rice (Oryza sativa)	 Subsequent analysis of two additional T-DNA mutants verified that OsFH1 is important for root-hair elongation| Further studies revealed that the action of OsFH1 on root-hair growth is dependent on growth conditions| The mutant Osfh1 exhibited root-hair defects when roots were grown submerged in solution, and mutant roots produced normal root hairs in the air| This study shows that OsFH1 plays a significant role in root-hair elongation in a growth condition-dependent manner|Formin homology 1 (OsFH1) regulates root-hair elongation in rice (Oryza sativa)
