NA	OsFTIP7 determines auxin-mediated anther dehiscence in rice.	2018	Nat Plants	Department of Biological Sciences and Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.	Anther dehiscence determines successful sexual reproduction of flowering plants through timely release of pollen grains for pollination and fertilization. Downregulation of auxin levels during pollen mitosis is essential for promoting anther dehiscence along with pollen maturation. How this key transition of auxin levels is regulated in male organs remains elusive. Here, we report that the rice FT-INTERACTING PROTEIN 7 is highly expressed in anthers before pollen mitotic divisions and facilitates nuclear translocation of a homeodomain transcription factor, Oryza sativa homeobox<U+2009>1, which directly suppresses a predominant auxin biosynthetic gene, OsYUCCA4, during the late development of anthers. This confers a key switch of auxin levels between meiosis of microspore mother cells and pollen mitotic divisions, thus controlling the timing of anther dehiscence during rice anthesis. Our findings shed light on the mechanism of hormonal control of anther dehiscence, and provide a new avenue for creating hormone-sensitive male sterile lines for hybrid plant breeding.
NA	OsFTIP7 determines metallic oxide nanoparticles response and tolerance by regulating auxin biosynthesis in rice	2021	J Hazard Mater	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Resources, Institute of Crop Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	The widely application of metallic oxide nanoparticles (NPs) has led to an increase in their accumulation in farmland. Previous studies have found that the metallic oxide NPs have negative effect on plants development and growth. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanism of response to metallic oxide NPs in rice remains elusive. In this study, we show that rice FT-INTERACTING PROTEIN 7 (OsFTIP7) plays an essential role in NPs of CuO and ZnO-mediated physiological and biochemical changes in rice. Loss of function of OsFTIP7 reduced the toxicity of the NPs of CuO and ZnO to the seedlings by accumulating more biomass and chlorophyll contents. Furthermore, after high exposure to metallic oxide NPs, more indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) were determined in Osftip7 with higher expression of auxin biosynthetic genes than the control seedlings. What's more, IAA-treated seedlings displayed the similar phenotype as Osftip7 under high concentrations of NPs of CuO and ZnO. Taken together, the results substantiate that OsFTIP7 is involved in metallic oxide nanoparticle-mediated physiological and biochemical changes by negatively regulating auxin biosynthesis in rice.
