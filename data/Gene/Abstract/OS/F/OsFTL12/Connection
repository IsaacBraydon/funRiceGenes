GF14b|OsGF14b	OsFTL12	OsFTL12, a member of FT-like family, modulates the heading date and plant architecture by florigen repression complex in rice.	 We further demonstrate that OsFTL12 interacts with GF14b and OsFD1, two key components of the florigen activation complex (FAC), to form the florigen repression complex (FRC) by competing with Hd3a for binding GF14b
Hd3a	OsFTL12	OsFTL12, a member of FT-like family, modulates the heading date and plant architecture by florigen repression complex in rice.	 Here, we show that OsFTL12 plays an antagonistic function against Hd3a and RFT1 to modulate the heading date and plant architecture in rice
Hd3a	OsFTL12	OsFTL12, a member of FT-like family, modulates the heading date and plant architecture by florigen repression complex in rice.	 Unlike Hd3a and RFT1, OsFTL12 is not regulated by daylength and highly expressed in both SD and LD conditions, and delays the heading date under either SD or LD conditions
