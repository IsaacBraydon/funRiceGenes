OsFTL12	architecture	OsFTL12, a member of FT-like family, modulates the heading date and plant architecture by florigen repression complex in rice.	 Here, we show that OsFTL12 plays an antagonistic function against Hd3a and RFT1 to modulate the heading date and plant architecture in rice
OsFTL12	heading date	OsFTL12, a member of FT-like family, modulates the heading date and plant architecture by florigen repression complex in rice.	 Here, we show that OsFTL12 plays an antagonistic function against Hd3a and RFT1 to modulate the heading date and plant architecture in rice
OsFTL12	heading date	OsFTL12, a member of FT-like family, modulates the heading date and plant architecture by florigen repression complex in rice.	 Unlike Hd3a and RFT1, OsFTL12 is not regulated by daylength and highly expressed in both SD and LD conditions, and delays the heading date under either SD or LD conditions
OsFTL12	plant architecture	OsFTL12, a member of FT-like family, modulates the heading date and plant architecture by florigen repression complex in rice.	 Here, we show that OsFTL12 plays an antagonistic function against Hd3a and RFT1 to modulate the heading date and plant architecture in rice
