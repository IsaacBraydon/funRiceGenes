FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), a florigen in Arabidopsis, plays critical roles in floral transition. Among 13 FT-like members in rice, OsFTL2 (Hd3a) and OsFTL3 (RFT1), two rice homologues of FT, have been well characterized to act as florigens to induce flowering under short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions, respectively, but the functions of other rice FT-like members remain largely unclear. Here, we show that OsFTL12 plays an antagonistic function against Hd3a and RFT1 to modulate the heading date and plant architecture in rice. Unlike Hd3a and RFT1, OsFTL12 is not regulated by daylength and highly expressed in both SD and LD conditions, and delays the heading date under either SD or LD conditions. We further demonstrate that OsFTL12 interacts with GF14b and OsFD1, two key components of the florigen activation complex (FAC), to form the florigen repression complex (FRC) by competing with Hd3a for binding GF14b. Notably, OsFTL12-FRC can bind to the promoters of the floral identity genes OsMADS14 and OsMADS15 and suppress their expression. The osmads14 osmads15 double mutants could not develop panicles and showed erect leaves. Taken together, our results reveal that different FT-like members can fine-tune heading date and plant architecture by regulating the balance of FAC and FRC in rice.
