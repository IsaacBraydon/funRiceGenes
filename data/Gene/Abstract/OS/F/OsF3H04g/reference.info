NA	Tal2c Activates the Expression of OsF3H(04g) to Promote Infection as a Redundant TALE of Tal2b in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola.	2021	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Crop Biology, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai&#39;an 271018, China.	Xanthomonas oryzae delivers transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) into plant cells to facilitate infection. Following economic principles, the redundant TALEs are rarely identified in Xanthomonas. Previously, we identified the Tal2b, which activates the expression of the rice 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase gene OsF3H(03g) to promote infection in the highly virulent strain of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola HGA4. Here, we reveal that another clustered TALE, Tal2c, also functioned as a virulence factor to target rice OsF3H(04g), a homologue of OsF3H(03g). Transferring Tal2c into RS105 induced expression of OsF3H(04g) to coincide with increased susceptibility in rice. Overexpressing OsF3H(04g) caused higher susceptibility and less salicylic acid (SA) production compared to wild-type plants. Moreover, CRISPR-Cas9 system-mediated editing of the effector-binding element in the promoters of OsF3H(03g) or OsF3H(04g) was found to specifically enhance resistance or Tal2c-transferring strains, but had no effect on resistance to either RS105 or HGA4. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that several reported SA-related and defense-related genes commonly altered expression in OsF3H(04g) overexpression line compared with those identified in OsF3H(03g) overexpression line. Overall, our results reveal a functional redundancy mechanism of pathogenic virulence in Xoc in which tandem Tal2b and Tal2c specifically target homologues of host genes to interfere with rice immunity by reducing SA.
NA	Salicylic Acid Is Required for Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance in Rice.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	Key Laboratory of Pest Monitoring and Green Management, MOA, Joint Laboratory for International Cooperation in Crop Molecular Breeding, Department of Plant Pathology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.	Rice plants contain high basal levels of salicylic acid (SA), but some of their functions remain elusive. To elucidate the importance of SA homeostasis in rice immunity, we characterized four rice SA hydroxylase genes (OsSAHs) and verified their roles in SA metabolism and disease resistance. Recombinant OsSAH proteins catalyzed SA in vitro, while OsSAH3 protein showed only SA 5-hydroxylase (SA5H) activity, which was remarkably higher than that of other OsSAHs that presented both SA3H and SA5H activities. Amino acid substitutions revealed that three amino acids in the binding pocket affected SAH enzyme activity and/or specificity. Knockout OsSAH2 and OsSAH3 (sahKO) genes conferred enhanced resistance to both hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens, whereas overexpression of each OsSAH gene increased susceptibility to the pathogens. sahKO mutants showed increased SA and jasmonate levels compared to those of the wild type and OsSAH-overexpressing plants. Analysis of the OsSAH3 promoter indicated that its induction was mainly restricted around Magnaporthe oryzae infection sites. Taken together, our findings indicate that SA plays a vital role in immune signaling. Moreover, fine-tuning SA homeostasis through suppression of SA metabolism is an effective approach in studying broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.
