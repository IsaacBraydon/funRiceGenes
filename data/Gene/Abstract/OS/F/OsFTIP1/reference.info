NA	OsFTIP1-Mediated Regulation of Florigen Transport in Rice Is Negatively Regulated by a Ubiquitin-like Domain Kinase OsUbDKγ4.	2017	Plant Cell	National University of Singapore CITY: Singapore Singapore [SG].	Flowering time is a critical agronomic trait that determines successful seed production and adaptation of crop plants. Photoperiodic control of this process in flowering plants is mediated by the long-distance mobile signal called florigen partly encoded by FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis and its orthologs in other plant species. Despite the progress in understanding FT transport in the dicot model Arabidopsis, the mechanisms of florigen transport in monocots, which provide most of the biomass in agriculture, are unknown. Here we show that rice FT-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 (OsFTIP1), a member of the family of multiple C2 domain and transmembrane region proteins (MCTPs) and the closest ortholog of Arabidopsis FTIP1, is required for export of RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1) from companion cells to sieve elements. This affects RFT1 movement to the shoot apical meristem and its regulation of rice flowering time under long days. We further reveal that a ubiquitin-like domain kinase γ4, OsUbDKγ4, interacts with OsFTIP1, and modulates its degradation in leaves through the 26S proteasome, which in turn affects RFT1 transport to the SAM. Thus, dynamic modulation of OsFTIP1 abundance in leaves by a negative regulator OsUbDKγ4 is integral to the role of OsFTIP1 in mediating RFT1 transport in rice, and provide key evidence for a conserved role of FTIP1-like MCTPs in mediating florigen transport in flowering plants.
NA	Nuclear Translocation of OsMFT1 That is Impeded by OsFTIP1 Promotes Drought Tolerance in Rice	2021	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Resources, Institute of Crop Science, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Drought has been the leading environmental threat affecting the productivity of crops, and plants have evolved a series of mechanisms to adapt to drought stress. The FT-INTERACTING PROTEINs (FTIPs) and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins (PEBPs) play key roles in developmental processes, whereas their roles in the regulation of stress response are still largely unknown. Here, we report that OsFTIP1 negatively affects drought response. Further study reveals that OsFTIP1 interacts with a PEBP, rice MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (OsMFT1), which promotes rice tolerance to drought treatment. OsMFT1 was found to interact with two key drought-related transcription factors, OsbZIP66 and OsMYB26, and regulates their binding capacity on drought-related genes, thus enhancing drought tolerance in rice. We further revealed that OsFTIP1 impedes the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of OsMFT1. These results demonstrate that dynamic modulation of drought responsive genes by OsMFT1-OsMYB26 complex and OsMFT1-OsbZIP66 complex is integral to OsFTIP1 effect on impeding nuclear translocation of OsMFT1. Our findings suggest that OsMFT1 acts as a hitherto unknown nucleocytoplasmic trafficking signal that regulates drought tolerance in rice in response to environmental signals.
