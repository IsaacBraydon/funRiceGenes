OsFTIP1	florigen transport	OsFTIP1-Mediated Regulation of Florigen Transport in Rice Is Negatively Regulated by the Ubiquitin-Like Domain Kinase OsUbDK¦Ã4.	Thus, dynamic modulation of OsFTIP1 abundance in leaves by a negative regulator OsUbDK¦Ã4 is integral to the role of OsFTIP1 in mediating RFT1 transport in rice and provides key evidence for a conserved role of FTIP1-like MCTPs in mediating florigen transport in flowering plants.
