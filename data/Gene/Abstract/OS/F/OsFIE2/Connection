OsEMF2b	OsFIE2	Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes	The rice genome contains two E(z)-like genes, OsiEZ1 and OsCLF, two homologs of Su(z)12, OsEMF2a and OsEMF2b, and two ESC-like genes, OsFIE1 and OsFIE2
OsFIE1|Epi-df	OsFIE2	Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes	The rice genome contains two E(z)-like genes, OsiEZ1 and OsCLF, two homologs of Su(z)12, OsEMF2a and OsEMF2b, and two ESC-like genes, OsFIE1 and OsFIE2
OsFIE2	OsiEZ1|OsSET1|SDG718	Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes	The rice genome contains two E(z)-like genes, OsiEZ1 and OsCLF, two homologs of Su(z)12, OsEMF2a and OsEMF2b, and two ESC-like genes, OsFIE1 and OsFIE2
OsFIE2	OsiEZ1|OsSET1|SDG718	Polycomb Protein OsFIE2 Affects Plant Height and Grain Yield in Rice.	Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays demonstrated that OsFIE2 interacts with OsiEZ1 which encodes an enhancer of zeste protein previously identified as a histone methylation enzyme
OsCLF|SDG711	OsFIE2	Regulation of plant height in rice by the Polycomb group genes OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF.	Regulation of plant height in rice by the Polycomb group genes OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF.
OsCLF|SDG711	OsFIE2	Regulation of plant height in rice by the Polycomb group genes OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF.	 To determine how PcG genes regulate plant height, we investigated the phenotypes of the emf2b mutant and OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF RNAi transgenic plants; they all exhibited dwarf phenotype
OsCLF|SDG711	OsFIE2	Regulation of plant height in rice by the Polycomb group genes OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF.	 Reduced cell expansion and cell division of stem caused significant reduction of stem length during mature period of OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF RNAi transgenic plants
OsCLF|SDG711	OsFIE2	Regulation of plant height in rice by the Polycomb group genes OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF.	 H3K27me3-modified sites were observed in 95 of the 109 up-regulated genes, and some of them were up-regulated in OsFIE2, OsCLF and OsEMF2b RNAi transgenic plants, and their H3K27me3 levels were reduced in emf2b
OsCLF|SDG711	OsFIE2	Regulation of plant height in rice by the Polycomb group genes OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF.	 Therefore, we speculated that these PcG genes, OsFIE2, OsCLF and OsEMF2b, may work as a PRC2 to regulate rice height
OsFIE1|Epi-df	OsFIE2	Functional divergence of two duplicated Fertilization Independent Endosperm genes in rice with respect to seed development	 OsFIE1 and OsFIE2 are two FIE homologs in the rice genome
OsFIE1|Epi-df	OsFIE2	Functional divergence of two duplicated Fertilization Independent Endosperm genes in rice with respect to seed development	 Here, we showed that OsFIE1 probably duplicated from OsFIE2 after the origin of the tribe Oryzeae, but has a specific expression pattern and methylation landscape
OsFIE1|Epi-df	OsFIE2	Functional divergence of two duplicated Fertilization Independent Endosperm genes in rice with respect to seed development	 During evolution, OsFIE1 underwent a less intensive purifying selection than did OsFIE2
OsFIE1|Epi-df	OsFIE2	Functional divergence of two duplicated Fertilization Independent Endosperm genes in rice with respect to seed development	 Ectopic expression of OsFIE1, but not OsFIE2, was deleterious to vegetative growth in a dose-dependent manner
OsFIE1|Epi-df	OsFIE2	Functional divergence of two duplicated Fertilization Independent Endosperm genes in rice with respect to seed development	 Our findings revealed the functional divergence of OsFIE1 and OsFIE2 and shed light on their distinct evolution following duplication
