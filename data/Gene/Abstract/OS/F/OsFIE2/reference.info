Over the last decade, various Polycomb proteins have been identified and functionally characterized in plants, and it has been found that they form the PRC2 suppressor complex, which is involved in various developmental programs, including seed development. In this study, the function of the rice fertilization-independent endosperm gene OsFIE2, which expresses a protein homologous to the Arabidopsis Polycomb protein FIE, was characterized. We also characterized OsEZ1/OsiEZ1, another key component of the PRC2 complex. Both the OsFIE2 and OsEZ11 genes are strongly expressed in leaf and stem compared to other tissues, including root, anther, ovary, and ovule. We further examined whether OsFIE2 interacted with OsEZ1 using a yeast two-hybrid system. Interaction analysis showed that OsFIE2 interacted with OsEZ1 but not with Arabidopsis MEA protein. To examine the physiological roles of OsFIE2, 35S:OsFIE2 Arabidopsis lines were generated. Transgenic plants with 35S:OsFIE2 grew faster than wild-type plants during early development. Importantly, they produced bigger seed than the wild type, indicating that OsFIE2 may play an important role in seed size. In addition, we generated pOsFIE2:GUS plants to examine the spatial expression pattern of OsFIE2. GUS expression was detected in cotyledon but not in any other tissues, suggesting that OsFIE2 expression may be required to suppress homeotic genes in cotyledon.
44545945.pdf	Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes	2009	Mol Plant	CSIRO Plant Industry, GPO BOX 1600, ACT 2601, Australia. ming.luo@csiro.au	Polycomb group proteins (PcG) play important roles in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Some core PcG proteins, such as Enhancer of Zeste (E(z)), Suppressor of Zeste (12) (Su(z)12), and Extra Sex Combs (ESC), are conserved in plants. The rice genome contains two E(z)-like genes, OsiEZ1 and OsCLF, two homologs of Su(z)12, OsEMF2a and OsEMF2b, and two ESC-like genes, OsFIE1 and OsFIE2. OsFIE1 is expressed only in endosperm; the maternal copy is expressed while the paternal copy is not active. Other rice PcG genes are expressed in a wide range of tissues and are not imprinted in the endosperm. The two E(z)-like genes appear to have duplicated before the separation of the dicots and monocots; the two homologs of Su(z)12 possibly duplicated during the evolution of the Gramineae and the two ESC-like genes are likely to have duplicated in the ancestor of the grasses. No homologs of the Arabidopsis seed-expressed PcG genes MEA and FIS2 were identified in the rice genome. We have isolated T-DNA insertion lines in the rice homologs of three PcG genes. There is no autonomous endosperm development in these T-DNA insertion lines. One line with a T-DNA insertion in OsEMF2b displays pleiotropic phenotypes including altered flowering time and abnormal flower organs, suggesting important roles in rice development for this gene.

Cereal endosperm represents 60% of the calories consumed by human beings worldwide. In addition, cereals also serve as the primary feedstock for livestock. However, the regulatory mechanism of cereal endosperm and seed development is largely unknown. Polycomb complex has been shown to play a key role in the regulation of endosperm development in Arabidopsis, but its role in cereal endosperm development remains obscure. Additionally, the enzyme activities of the polycomb complexes have not been demonstrated in plants. Here we purified the rice OsFIE2-polycomb complex using tandem affinity purification and demonstrated its specific H3 methyltransferase activity. We found that the OsFIE2 gene product was responsible for H3K27me3 production specifically in vivo. Genetic studies showed that a reduction of OsFIE2 expression led to smaller seeds, partially filled seeds, and partial loss of seed dormancy. Gene expression and proteomics analyses found that the starch synthesis rate limiting step enzyme and multiple storage proteins are down-regulated in OsFIE2 reduction lines. Genome wide ChIP-Seq data analysis shows that H3K27me3 is associated with many genes in the young seeds. The H3K27me3 modification and gene expression in a key helix-loop-helix transcription factor is shown to be regulated by OsFIE2. Our results suggest that OsFIE2-polycomb complex positively regulates rice endosperm development and grain filling via a mechanism highly different from that in Arabidopsis.
NA	Polycomb Protein OsFIE2 Affects Plant Height and Grain Yield in Rice.	2016	PLoS One	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Key Laboratory of Rice Biology and Breeding of Ministry of Agriculture, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, China.	Polycomb group (PcG) proteins have been shown to affect growth and development in plants. To further elucidate their role in these processes in rice, we isolated and characterized a rice mutant which exhibits dwarfism, reduced seed setting rate, defective floral organ, and small grains. Map-based cloning revealed that abnormal phenotypes were attributed to a mutation of the Fertilization Independent Endosperm 2 (OsFIE2) protein, which belongs to the PcG protein family. So we named the mutant as osfie2-1. Histological analysis revealed that the number of longitudinal cells in the internodes decreased in osfie2-1, and that lateral cell layer of the internodes was markedly thinner than wild-type. In addition, compared to wild-type, the number of large and small vascular bundles decreased in osfie2-1, as well as cell number and cell size in spikelet hulls. OsFIE2 is expressed in most tissues and the coded protein localizes in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays demonstrated that OsFIE2 interacts with OsiEZ1 which encodes an enhancer of zeste protein previously identified as a histone methylation enzyme. RNA sequencing-based transcriptome profiling and qRT-PCR analysis revealed that some homeotic genes and genes involved in endosperm starch synthesis, cell division/expansion and hormone synthesis and signaling are differentially expressed between osfie2-1 and wild-type. In addition, the contents of IAA, GA3, ABA, JA and SA in osfie2-1 are significantly different from those in wild-type. Taken together, these results indicate that OsFIE2 plays an important role in the regulation of plant height and grain yield in rice.
NA	Functional divergence of two duplicated Fertilization Independent Endosperm genes in rice with respect to seed development	2021	Plant J	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology/Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics of the Ministry of Education/Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genomics and Molecular Breeding/Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, College of Agriculture, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.	Fertilization Independent Endosperm (FIE) is an essential member of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) that plays important roles in the developmental regulation of plants. OsFIE1 and OsFIE2 are two FIE homologs in the rice genome. Here, we showed that OsFIE1 probably duplicated from OsFIE2 after the origin of the tribe Oryzeae, but has a specific expression pattern and methylation landscape. During evolution, OsFIE1 underwent a less intensive purifying selection than did OsFIE2. The mutant osfie1 produced smaller seeds and displayed reduced dormancy, indicating that OsFIE1 predominantly functions in late seed development. Ectopic expression of OsFIE1, but not OsFIE2, was deleterious to vegetative growth in a dose-dependent manner. The newly evolved N-terminal tail of OsFIE1 was probably not the cause of the adverse effects on vegetative growth. The CRISPR/Cas9-derived mutant osfie2 exhibited impaired cellularization of the endosperm, which suggested that OsFIE2 is indispensable for early seed development as a positive regulator of cellularization. Autonomous endosperm was observed in both OsFIE2+- and osfie1/OsFIE2+- but at a very low frequency. Although OsFIE1-PRC2 exhibited H3K27me3 methyltransferase ability in plants, OsFIE1-PRC2 is likely to be less important for development in rice than is OsFIE2-PRC2. Our findings revealed the functional divergence of OsFIE1 and OsFIE2 and shed light on their distinct evolution following duplication.
