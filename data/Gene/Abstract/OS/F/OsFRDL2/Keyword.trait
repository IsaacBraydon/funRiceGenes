OsFRDL2	root	Functional analysis of a MATE gene OsFRDL2 revealed its involvement in Al-induced secretion of citrate, but less contribution to Al tolerance in rice.	The Al-induced inhibition of the root elongation was similar between the OsFRDL2 knockout line and its wild type rice
OsFRDL2	tolerance	Functional analysis of a MATE gene OsFRDL2 revealed its involvement in Al-induced secretion of citrate, but less contribution to Al tolerance in rice.	Functional analysis of a MATE gene OsFRDL2 revealed its involvement in Al-induced secretion of citrate, but less contribution to Al tolerance in rice.
OsFRDL2	tolerance	Functional analysis of a MATE gene OsFRDL2 revealed its involvement in Al-induced secretion of citrate, but less contribution to Al tolerance in rice.	Furthermore, the expression of OsFRDL2 was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type Zn-finger transcription factor for Al tolerance
OsFRDL2	tolerance	Functional analysis of a MATE gene OsFRDL2 revealed its involvement in Al-induced secretion of citrate, but less contribution to Al tolerance in rice.	Collectively, our results indicate that although OsFRDL2 is involved in the Al-induced secretion of citrate, its contribution to high Al tolerance is relatively small in rice
OsFRDL2	transcription factor	Functional analysis of a MATE gene OsFRDL2 revealed its involvement in Al-induced secretion of citrate, but less contribution to Al tolerance in rice.	Furthermore, the expression of OsFRDL2 was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type Zn-finger transcription factor for Al tolerance
