NA	Genome-Wide Identification, Expression and Functional Analysis Reveal the Involvement of FCS-Like Zinc Finger Gene Family in Submergence Response in Rice	2021	Rice	Rice Research Institute, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guangzhou, 510640, China	Here, we have performed a genome-wide identification of FCS-like zinc finger (FLZ) proteins and assessed their involvement in submergence response in rice. We identified 29 FLZ genes in rice, and the expression analysis revealed that several genes actively responded to submergence stress. Eight OsFLZ proteins interact with SnRK1A. As a case study, we demonstrated that OsFLZ18 interacted with SnRK1A and inhibited the transcriptional activation activity of SnRK1A in modulating the expression of its target gene ¦ÁAmy3, a positive regulator in rice flooding tolerance. In line with this, OsFLZ18-overexpression lines displayed retarded early seedling growth and shorter coleoptile following submergence.
