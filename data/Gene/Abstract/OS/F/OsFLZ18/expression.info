OsFLZ18	 As a case study, we demonstrated that OsFLZ18 interacted with SnRK1A and inhibited the transcriptional activation activity of SnRK1A in modulating the expression of its target gene ¦ÁAmy3, a positive regulator in rice flooding tolerance |  In line with this, OsFLZ18-overexpression lines displayed retarded early seedling growth and shorter coleoptile following submergence	 In line with this, OsFLZ18-overexpression lines displayed retarded early seedling growth and shorter coleoptile following submergence
