FCA|OsFCA	OsFY	OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	FCA and FY are flowering time related genes involved in the autonomous flowering pathway in Arabidopsis
FCA|OsFCA	OsFY	OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	FCA interacts with FY to regulate the alternative processing of FCA pre-mRNA
FCA|OsFCA	OsFY	OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	The FCA/FY interaction is also required for the regulation of FLC expression, a major floral repressor in Arabidopsis
FCA|OsFCA	OsFY	OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	The protein-protein interaction between OsFY and OsFCA-gamma, the key feature of their gene function, was also demonstrated using the yeast two-hybrid system
FCA|OsFCA	OsFY	OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	These results indicate that the autonomous flowering pathway is present in monocots, and the regulation through FY and FCA interaction is conserved between monocots and dicots

FCA|OsFCA	OsFY	Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY	The FCA protein interacts with FY, a polyadenylation factor, via its WW domain
FCA|OsFCA	OsFY	Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY	Here, we found that the OsFCA protein could interact through its WW domain with the following proteins: OsFY, a protein containing a CID domain present in RNA-processing factors such as Pcf11 and Nrd1; a protein similar to splicing factor SF1; a protein similar to FUSE splicing factor; and OsMADS8
FCA|OsFCA	OsFY	Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY	Taken together, our data suggest that OsFCA could interact with several proteins other than OsFY through its WW domain and may play several roles in rice
