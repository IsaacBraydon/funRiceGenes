Hd3a	OsFTIP9	The tetratricopeptide repeat protein OsTPR075 promotes heading by regulating florigen transport in rice.	 Here, we report that FT-INTERACTING PROTEIN9 (OsFTIP9) specifically regulates rice flowering time under SDs by facilitating Hd3a transport from companion cells to sieve elements
Hd3a	OsFTIP9	The tetratricopeptide repeat protein OsTPR075 promotes heading by regulating florigen transport in rice.	 Furthermore, we show that the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein OsTPR075 interacts with both OsFTIP9 and OsFTIP1 and strengthens their respective interactions with Hd3a and the florigen RFT1
