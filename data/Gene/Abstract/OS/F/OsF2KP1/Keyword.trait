OsF2KP1	endosperm	Dry-milled flour rice &#x27;Seolgaeng&#x27; harbors a mutated fructose-6-phosphate 2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase2.	 CRISPR/Cas9-induced double mutants of OsF2KP1 and OsF2KP2 (f2kp-d) possessed more opaque endosperm compared to f2kp2 single mutants, whereas the endosperm of the f2kp1 single mutant was normal
OsF2KP1	endosperm	Dry-milled flour rice &#x27;Seolgaeng&#x27; harbors a mutated fructose-6-phosphate 2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase2.	 These results suggest that OsF2KP2 functions as the main F2KP isoform in endosperm experiencing hypoxia, but OsF2KP1 may partially compensate for the absence of OsF2KP2
