OsFLP	 Consistently, phenotypic analysis under salt stress conditions showed that osflp exhibited significant sensitivity to salt stress, while OsFLP over-expression lines displayed obvious salt tolerance |  Additionally, Yeast one-hybrid assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that OsFLP directly bound to the promoter region of Oryza sativa B-type Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1;1 (OsCDKB1;1), and the expression of OsCDKB1;1 was repressed in osflp
