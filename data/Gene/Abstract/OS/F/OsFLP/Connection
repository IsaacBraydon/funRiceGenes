CDKB1;1|CDKB1|OsCDKB1;1	OsFLP	Transcriptomic analysis reveals the role of FOUR LIPS in response to salt stress in rice.	 Additionally, Yeast one-hybrid assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that OsFLP directly bound to the promoter region of Oryza sativa B-type Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1;1 (OsCDKB1;1), and the expression of OsCDKB1;1 was repressed in osflp
CDKB1;1|CDKB1|OsCDKB1;1	OsFLP	Transcriptomic analysis reveals the role of FOUR LIPS in response to salt stress in rice.	 Taken together, our findings reveal a crucial function of OsFLP regulating OsCDKB1;1 in salt tolerance and largely extend the knowledge about the role of OsFLP in rice
OsFLP	OsNAC6|SNAC2	A Rice R2R3-Type MYB Transcription Factor OsFLP Positively Regulates Drought Stress Response via OsNAC.	 The yeast-one-hybrid assay indicated that OsFLP can specifically bind and positively regulate OsNAC1 and OsNAC6
OsFLP	OsNAC6|SNAC2	A Rice R2R3-Type MYB Transcription Factor OsFLP Positively Regulates Drought Stress Response via OsNAC.	 These findings suggested that OsFLP positively participates in drought stress, mainly through regulating regulators&#x27; transcripts of OsNAC1 and OsNAC6
