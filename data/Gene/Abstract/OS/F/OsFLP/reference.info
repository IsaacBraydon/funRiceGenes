NA	Multiple transcriptional factors control stomata development in rice.	2019	New Phytol	MOE Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, China.	The grass stomata can balance the gas exchange and evaporation effectively in rapidly changing environment via their unique anatomical features. Although the key components of stomatal development in Arabidopsis have been largely elucidated during the past decade, the molecular mechanisms that govern stomatal development in grasses are poorly understood. Via the genome editing system and T-DNA insertion lines, the key transcriptional factors (TFs) regulating stomatal development in rice (Oryza sativa) were knocked out. A combination of genetic and biochemical assays subsequently revealed the functions of these TFs. OsSPCH/OsICE is essential for the initiation of stomatal lineage. OsMUTE/OsICE determines meristemoid to guard mother cell (GMC) transition. OsFAMA/OsICE influences subsidiary mother cell asymmetric division and mature stoma differentiation. OsFLP regulates the orientation of GMC symmetric division. More importantly, we found that OsSCR/OsSHR controls the initiation of stomatal lineage cells and the formation of subsidiary cells, and the transcription of OsSCR is activated by OsSPCH and OsMUTE. This study characterized the functions of master regulatory TFs that control each stomatal developmental stage in rice. Our findings are helpful to elucidate how various species reprogramme the molecular mechanisms to generate different stomatal types during evolution. This article is protected by copyright.

NA	RSD1 Is Essential for Stomatal Patterning and Files in Rice	2020	Front Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China.	Stomatal density is an important factor that determines the efficiency of plant gas exchange and water transpiration. Through forward genetics, we screened a mutant rice stomata developmental defect 1 (rsd1-1) with decreased stomatal density and clustered stomata in rice (Oryza sativa). After the first asymmetric division, some of the larger sister cells undergo an extra asymmetric division to produce a small cell neighboring guard mother cell. Some of these small cells develop into stomata, which leads to stomatal clustering, and the rest arrested or developed into pavement cell. After map-based cloning, we found the protein encoded by this gene containing DUF630 and DUF632 domains. Evolutionary analysis showed that the DUF630/632 gene family differentiated earlier in land plants. It was found that the deletion of RSD1 would lead to the disorder of gene expression regarding stomatal development, especially the expression of stomatal density and distribution 1 (OsSDD1). Through the construction of OsSDD1 deletion mutants by CRISPR-Cas9, we found that, similar to rsd1 mutants, the ossdd1 mutants have clustered stomata and extra small cells adjacent to the stomata. OsSDD1 and RSD1 are both required for inhibiting ectopic asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) and clustered stomata. By dehydration stress assay, the decreased stomatal density of rsd1 mutants enhanced their dehydration avoidance. This study characterized the functions of RSD1 and OsSDD1 in rice stomatal development. Our findings will be helpful in developing drought-resistant crops through controlling the stomatal density.
NA	Transcriptomic analysis reveals the role of FOUR LIPS in response to salt stress in rice.	2022	Plant Mol Biol	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China.	An R2R3-MYB transcription factor FOUR LIPS associated with B-type Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1;1 confers salt tolerance in rice. The Arabidopsis FOUR LIPS (AtFLP), an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, acts as an important stomatal development regulator. Only one orthologue protein of AtFLP, Oryza sativa FLP (OsFLP), was identified in rice. However, the function of OsFLP is largely unknown. In this study, we conducted RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to investigate the potential role of OsFLP in rice. Our results reveal that OsFLP is probably a multiple functional regulator involved in many biological processes in growth development and stress responses in rice. However, we mainly focus on the role of OsFLP in salt stress response. Consistently, phenotypic analysis under salt stress conditions showed that osflp exhibited significant sensitivity to salt stress, while OsFLP over-expression lines displayed obvious salt tolerance. Additionally, Yeast one-hybrid assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that OsFLP directly bound to the promoter region of Oryza sativa B-type Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1;1 (OsCDKB1;1), and the expression of OsCDKB1;1 was repressed in osflp. Disturbing the expression of OsCDKB1;1 remarkably enhanced the tolerance to salt stress. Taken together, our findings reveal a crucial function of OsFLP regulating OsCDKB1;1 in salt tolerance and largely extend the knowledge about the role of OsFLP in rice.
NA	A Rice R2R3-Type MYB Transcription Factor OsFLP Positively Regulates Drought Stress Response via OsNAC.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Tree Breeding by Molecular Design, Beijing University of Agriculture, Beijing 102206, China.	Abiotic stresses adversely affect plant growth and the yield of crops worldwide. R2R3-MYB transcriptional factors have been found to be vital for plants to confer stress response. In Arabidopsis, FOUR LIPS (FLP, MYB124) and its paralogous MYB88 function redundantly regulated the symmetric division of guard mother cells (GMCs) and abiotic stress response. Here, OsFLP was identified as an R2R3-MYB transcriptional activator and localized in the nucleus. OsFLP was transiently induced by drought, salt stress and abscisic acid (ABA). Overexpression of OsFLP showed enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses. The stomatal density in OsFLP-OE plants was not changed, whereas the stomatal closure was sensitive to ABA treatment compared to wild-type plants. In contrast, OsFLP-RNAi plants had abnormal stomata and were sensitive to drought. Moreover, the transcripts of stomatal closure-related genes DST and peroxidase 24 precursor, which are identified as downstream of OsNAC1, were inhibited in OsFLP-RNAi plants. The yeast-one-hybrid assay indicated that OsFLP can specifically bind and positively regulate OsNAC1 and OsNAC6. Meanwhile, stress response genes, such as OsLEA3 and OsDREB2A, were up-regulated in OsFLP-OE plants. These findings suggested that OsFLP positively participates in drought stress, mainly through regulating regulators&#x27; transcripts of OsNAC1 and OsNAC6.
