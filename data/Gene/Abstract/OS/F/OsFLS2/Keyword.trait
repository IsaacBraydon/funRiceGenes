OsFLS2	growth	Analysis of flagellin perception mediated by flg22 receptor OsFLS2 in rice	 However, examination of the growth rate of the compatible strain in inoculated OsFLS2-overexpressing rice could not confirm bacterial growth suppression compared with wild-type rice
OsFLS2	cell death	Analysis of flagellin perception mediated by flg22 receptor OsFLS2 in rice	 OsFLS2-overexpressing rice cultured cells generated stronger immune responses with the induction of cell death following stimulation with flg22 and flagellin
