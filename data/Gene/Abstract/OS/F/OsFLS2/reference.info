Mol. Plant-2014-Chen-mp-ssu003.pdf	An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors	2014	Mol Plant	Department of Plant Pathology and the Genome Center, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.	The rice XA21 immune receptor kinase and the structurally related XA3 receptor confer immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent of bacterial leaf blight. Here we report the isolation of OsSERK2 (rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2) and demonstrate that OsSERK2 positively regulates immunity mediated by XA21 and XA3 as well as the rice immune receptor FLS2 (OsFLS2). Rice plants silenced for OsSerk2 display altered morphology and reduced sensitivity to the hormone brassinolide. OsSERK2 interacts with the intracellular domains of each immune receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system in a kinase activity-dependent manner. OsSERK2 undergoes bidirectional transphosphorylation with XA21 in vitro and forms a constitutive complex with XA21 in vivo. These results demonstrate an essential role for OsSERK2 in the function of three rice immune receptors and suggest that direct interaction with the rice immune receptors is critical for their function. Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanism of OsSERK2-meditated regulation of rice XA21, XA3, and FLS2 differs from that of AtSERK3/BAK1-mediated regulation of Arabidopsis FLS2 and EFR.
MPMI-21-12-1635.pdf	Analysis of flagellin perception mediated by flg22 receptor OsFLS2 in rice	2008	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), 8916-5, Takayama Ikoma, Nara 630-0191, Japan.	Plants have sensitive perception systems that recognize various pathogen-derived molecules. We previously reported that rice detects flagellin from a rice-incompatible strain of gram-negative phytopathogenic bacterium, Acidovorax avenae, which induces subsequent immune responses involving cell death. The mechanism of flagellin perception in rice, however, has remained obscure. In this study, we found that flg22, a peptide derived from the flagellin N-terminus, induced weak immune responses without cell death in cultured rice cells. To elucidate the mechanism by which flg22 induced signaling in rice, we characterized OsFLS2, the rice ortholog of AtFLS2, which mediates flg22 perception. Heterologous expression of OsFLS2 functions in Arabidopsis, showing the conservation of the flg22 signaling pathway across divergent plant taxa. OsFLS2-overexpressing rice cultured cells generated stronger immune responses with the induction of cell death following stimulation with flg22 and flagellin. However, examination of the growth rate of the compatible strain in inoculated OsFLS2-overexpressing rice could not confirm bacterial growth suppression compared with wild-type rice. These results suggest that rice possesses a conserved flagellin perception system utilizing the FLS2 receptor which, when upregulated, hardly affects resistance against compatible A. avenae.
NA	Rice OsFLS2-mediated perception of bacterial flagellins is evaded by Xanthomonas oryzae pvs. oryzae and oryzicola.	2015	Mol Plant	Department of Plant Pathology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China; Key Laboratory of Plant Pathology, Ministry of Agriculture, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.	Bacterial flagellins are often recognized by the receptor kinase FLAGELLIN SENSITIVE2 (FLS2) and activate MAMP-triggered immunity in dicotyledonous plants. However, the capacity of monocotyledonous rice to recognize flagellins of key rice pathogens and its biological relevance remain poorly understood. We demonstrated that ectopically expressed OsFLS2 in Arabidopsis senses the eliciting flg22 peptide and in vitro purified Acidovorax avenae (Aa) flagellin in an expression level-dependent manner, but does not recognize purified flagellins or derivative flg22(Xo) peptides of Xanthomonas oryzae pvs. oryzae (Xoo) and oryzicola (Xoc). Consistently, the flg22 peptide and purified Aa flagellin, but not Xoo/Xoc flagellins, induce various immune responses such as defense gene induction and MAPK activation in rice. Perception of flagellin by rice does induce strong resistance to Xoo infection, as shown after pretreatment of rice leaves with Aa flagellin. OsFLS2 was found to exhibit different perception specificities or sensitivities to the flg22 region from AtFLS2. In additional work, post-translational modification of Xoc flagellin was altered by deletion of glycosyltransferase-encoding rbfC but this had little effect on Xoc motility and did not detectably reduce virulence on rice. Deletion of flagellin-encoding fliC from Xoo/Xoc blocked swimming motility but also did not significantly alter Xoo/Xoc virulence. The results suggest that Xoo/Xoc carry flg22-region amino acid changes that allow motility while evading the ancient flagellin detection system in rice, which retains recognition capacity for other bacterial pathogens.
