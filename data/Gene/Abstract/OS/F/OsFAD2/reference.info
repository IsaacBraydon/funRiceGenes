The deduced amino acid sequence of OsFAD2 displayed three histidine boxes characteristic of all membrane-bound desaturases, and possessed a C-terminal signal for endoplasmic reticulum retention. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OsFAD2 is grouped within plant housekeeping FAD2 sequences. Expression analysis by real-time PCR showed that the gene is expressed in all tissues of rice tested, including root, seed, stem, and leaf. In situ hybridization showed that OsFAD2 mRNA accumulated in leaf mesophyll cells and in root epidermis cells when exposed to 15°C for 4 days in dark conditions. When OsFAD2 was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the cells could convert oleic acid to linoleic acid, which wild-type yeast cells cannot do, suggesting that the isolated gene encoded a functional FAD2 enzyme. Heterologous expression of OsFAD2 enhanced the yeast cells cold tolerance capacity compared to wild-type yeast. OsFAD2 was also shown to be a highly active desaturase when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In addition, when the OsFAD2 gene was transferred into an Arabidopsis thaliana fad2-1 mutant, it effectively restored wild-type fatty acid composition and growth characteristics. Stress tolerance and light regulatory elements were identified in the predicted promoter of the OsFAD2 gene. Exogenously supplied hormone affected the level of FAD2 mRNA accumulation, accompanied by a change of content of di-unsaturated fatty acid species in rice leaves. Furthermore, OsFAD2 enhanced tolerance to low temperature when overexpressed in rice at the vegetative stage. More importantly, the 35S::OsFAD2 plants showed significantly enhanced cold tolerance at the reproductive stage, increasing grain yield by 46% over controls in the greenhouse under cold conditions. These results indicated that OsFAD2 is involved in fatty acid desaturation and maintenance of the membrane lipids balance in cells, and could improve the tolerance of yeast and rice to low temperature stress.
NA	RNAi-mediated down-regulation of the expression of OsFAD2-1: effect on lipid accumulation and expression of lipid biosynthetic genes in the rice grain.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	School of Science, Monash University Malaysia, 46150 Bandar Sunway, Selangor, Malaysia.	The bran from polished rice grains can be used to produce rice bran oil (RBO). High oleic (HO) RBO has been generated previously through RNAi down-regulation of OsFAD2-1. HO-RBO has higher oxidative stability and could be directly used in the food industry without hydrogenation, and is hence free of trans fatty acids. However, relative to a classic oilseed, lipid metabolism in the rice grain is poorly studied and the genetic alteration in the novel HO genotype remains unexplored.Here, we have undertaken further analysis of role of OsFAD2-1 in the developing rice grain. The use of Illumina-based NGS transcriptomics analysis of developing rice grain reveals that knockdown of Os-FAD2-1 gene expression was accompanied by the down regulation of the expression of a number of key genes in the lipid biosynthesis pathway in the HO rice line. A slightly higher level of oil accumulation was also observed in the HO-RBO.Prominent among the down regulated genes were those that coded for FatA, LACS, SAD2, SAD5, caleosin and steroleosin. It may be possible to further increase the oleic acid content in rice oil by altering the expression of the lipid biosynthetic genes that are affected in the HO line.
