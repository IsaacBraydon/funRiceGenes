NA	The OsmiR396-OsGRF8-OsF3H-flavonoid pathway mediates resistance to the brown planthopper in rice (Oryza sativa).	2019	Plant Biotechnol J	Key Laboratory of Insect Developmental and Evolutionary Biology, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200032, China.	Multi-functional microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key modulators of plant-pathogen interactions. Although the involvement of some miRNAs in plant-insect interactions has been revealed, the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. The brown planthopper (BPH) is the most notorious rice (Oryza sativa)-specific insect that causes severe yield losses each year and requires urgent biological control. To reveal the miRNAs involved in rice-BPH interactions, we performed miRNA sequencing and identified BPH-responsive OsmiR396. Sequestering OsmiR396 by overexpressing target mimicry (MIM396) in three genetic backgrounds indicated that OsmiR396 negatively regulated BPH resistance. Over-expression of one BPH-responsive target gene of OsmiR396, growth regulating factor 8 (OsGRF8), showed resistance to BPH. Furthermore, the flavonoid contents increased in both the OsmiR396-sequestered and the OsGRF8 over-expressing plants. By analyzing 39 natural rice varieties, the elevated flavonoid contents were found to correlate with enhanced BPH resistance. Artificial applications of flavonoids to wild type (WT) plants also increased resistance to BPH. A BPH-responsive flavanone 3-hydroxylase (OsF3H) gene in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway was proved to be directly regulated by OsGRF8. A genetic functional analysis of OsF3H revealed its positive role in mediating both the flavonoid contents and BPH resistance. And analysis of the genetic correlation between OsmiR396 and OsF3H showed that down-regulation of OsF3H complemented the BPH resistance characteristic and simultaneously decreased the flavonoid contents of the MIM396 plants. Thus, we revealed a new BPH resistance mechanism mediated by the OsmiR396-OsGRF8-OsF3H-flavonoid pathway. Our study suggests potential applications of miRNAs in BPH resistance breeding.

NA	Discovery and Validation of a Novel Step Catalyzed by OsF3H in the Flavonoid Biosynthesis Pathway	2021	Biology (Basel)	Division of Plant Biosciences, School of Applied Biosciences, College of Agriculture & Life Science, Kyungpook National University, 80 Dahak-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu 41566, Korea.	Kaempferol and quercetin are the essential plant secondary metabolites that confer huge biological functions in the plant defense system. In this study, biosynthetic pathways for kaempferol and quercetin were constructed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using naringenin as a substrate. OsF3H was cloned into pRS42K yeast episomal plasmid (YEp) vector and the activity of the target gene was analyzed in engineered and empty strains. We confirmed a novel step of kaempferol and quercetin biosynthesis directly from naringenin, catalyzed by the rice flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H). The results were confirmed through thin layer chromatography (TLC) followed by western blotting, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry LCMS-MS. TLC showed positive results when comparing both compounds extracted from the engineered strain with the standard reference. Western blotting confirmed the lack of OsF3H activity in empty strains and confirmed high OsF3H expression in engineered strains. NMR spectroscopy confirmed only quercetin, while LCMS-MS results revealed that F3H is responsible for the conversion of naringenin to both kaempferol and quercetin.
NA	Tal2b targets and activates the expression of OsF3H(03g) to hijack OsUGT74H4 and synergistically interfere with rice immunity.	2021	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Biology, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai&#39;an, Shandong, 271018, China.	Transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors are major virulence factors secreted by the type III secretion systems of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) and X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), causing bacterial leaf streak and bacterial blight, respectively, in rice. However, the knowledge of Xoc TAL effector function in promoting bacterial virulence remains limited. Here, we isolated the highly virulent Xoc strain HGA4 from the outbreak region of Huanggang (Hubei, China), which contains four TAL effectors not found in the Chinese model strain RS105. Among these, Tal2b was selected for introduction into RS105, which resulted in a longer lesion length than that in the control. Tal2b directly binds to the promoter region of the gene and activates the expression of OsF3H(03g) , which encodes 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase in rice. OsF3H(03g) negatively regulates salicylic acid (SA)-related defense by directly reducing SA, and it plays a positive role in susceptibility to both Xoc and Xoo in rice. OsF3H(03g) interacts with a uridine diphosphate-glycosyltransferase protein (OsUGT74H4), which positively regulates bacterial leaf streak susceptibility and may inactivate SA via glycosylation modification.
