OsF3H03g|OsS5H2	resistance	The OsmiR396-OsGRF8-OsF3H-flavonoid pathway mediates resistance to the brown planthopper in rice (Oryza sativa).	 A genetic functional analysis of OsF3H revealed its positive role in mediating both the flavonoid contents and BPH resistance
OsF3H03g|OsS5H2	resistance	The OsmiR396-OsGRF8-OsF3H-flavonoid pathway mediates resistance to the brown planthopper in rice (Oryza sativa).	 And analysis of the genetic correlation between OsmiR396 and OsF3H showed that down-regulation of OsF3H complemented the BPH resistance characteristic and simultaneously decreased the flavonoid contents of the MIM396 plants
