Symbol	Expression
OsF3H	 Western blotting confirmed the lack of OsF3H activity in empty strains and confirmed high OsF3H expression in engineered strains
OsF3H	Tal2b targets and activates the expression of OsF3H(03g) to hijack OsUGT74H4 and synergistically interfere with rice immunity. |  Tal2b directly binds to the promoter region of the gene and activates the expression of OsF3H(03g) , which encodes 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase in rice
