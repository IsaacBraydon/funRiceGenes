NA	The Rice AAA-ATPase OsFIGNL1 Is Essential for Male Meiosis.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Key Laboratory for Zhejiang Super Rice Research and State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, China.	Meiosis is crucial in reproduction of plants and ensuring genetic diversity. Although several genes involved in homologous recombination and DNA repair have been reported, their functions in rice (Oryza sativa) male meiosis remain poorly understood. Here, we isolated and characterized the rice OsFIGNL1 (OsFidgetin-like 1) gene, encoding a conserved AAA-ATPase, and explored its function and importance in male meiosis and pollen formation. The rice Osfignl1 mutant exhibited normal vegetative growth, but failed to produce seeds and displayed pollen abortion phenotype. Phenotypic comparisons between the wild-type and Osfignl1 mutant demonstrated that OsFIGNL1 is required for anther development, and that the recessive mutation of this gene causes male sterility in rice. Complementation and CRISPR/Cas9 experiments demonstrated that wild-type OsFIGNL1 is responsible for the male sterility phenotype. Subcellular localization showed that OsFIGNL1-green fluorescent protein was exclusively localized in the nucleus of rice protoplasts. Male meiosis in the Osfignl1 mutant exhibited abnormal chromosome behavior, including chromosome bridges and multivalent chromosomes at diakinesis, lagging chromosomes, and chromosome fragments during meiosis. Yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated OsFIGNL1 could interact with RAD51A1, RAD51A2, DMC1A, DMC1B, and these physical interactions were further confirmed by BiFC assay. Taken together, our results suggest that OsFIGNL1 plays an important role in regulation of male meiosis and anther development.
NA	FIGNL1 Inhibits Non-homologous Chromosome Association and Crossover Formation.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.	Meiotic crossovers (COs) not only generate genetic diversity but also ensure the accuracy of homologous chromosome segregation. Here, we identified FIGNL1 as a new inhibitor for extra crossover formation in rice. The fignl1 mutant displays abnormal interactions between non-homologous chromosomes at diakinesis, and chromosome bridges and fragmentation at subsequent stages of meiosis, but shows normal homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis during early prophase I. FIGNL1 participates in homologous chromosome recombination and functions downstream of DMC1. Mutation of FIGNL1 increases the number of bivalents in zip4 mutants, but does not change the number of HEI10 foci, indicating that FIGNL1 functions in limiting class II CO formation. FIGNL1 interacts with MEICA1, and colocalizes with MEICA1 in a dynamic pattern as punctate foci located between two linear homologous chromosomes. The localization of FIGNL1 depends on ZEP1-mediated assembly of the synaptonemal complex. Based on these results, we propose that FIGNL1 inhibits non-homologous chromosome interaction and CO formation during rice meiosis.
