OsFRDL4	Retrotransposon-mediated aluminum tolerance through enhanced expression of the citrate transporter OsFRDL4. |  Here, we investigated the factors regulating the expression of OsFRDL4, a gene encoding citrate efflux transporter involved in Al-induced citrate secretion from the roots |  Analysis with chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSL) derived from Nipponbare (high OsFRDL4 expression) and Kasalath (low OsFRDL4 expression) revealed that differential expression of OsFRDL4 is responsible for the QTL for Al tolerance detected previously on chromosome 1 |  However, this insertion did not alter the spatial expression or cellular localization of OsFRDL4 | 2-kb insertion in the OsFRDL4 promoter region in japonica subspecies is responsible for their higher expression level of OsFRDL4 due to the increased number of cis-acting elements of ART1
OsFRDL4	 This treatment also masked Al-binding sites in the cell wall by upregulating the expression ofOsSATR1andOsSTAR2in roots and reduced Al binding in the cell wall by stimulating the expression of the citrate acid exudation geneOsFRDL4and increasing the secretion of citrate acid
