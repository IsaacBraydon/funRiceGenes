ART1	OsFRDL4	An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice	Furthermore, the OsFRDL4 expression was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor for Al tolerance
OsFRDL2	OsFRDL4	Functional analysis of a MATE gene OsFRDL2 revealed its involvement in Al-induced secretion of citrate, but less contribution to Al tolerance in rice.	A double mutant between osfrdl2 and osfrdl4 or osfrdl1 did not further decrease the Al-induced citrate secretion and Fe translocation compared with the single mutant
ART1	OsFRDL4	Retrotransposon-mediated aluminum tolerance through enhanced expression of the citrate transporter OsFRDL4.	2-kb insertion in the OsFRDL4 promoter region in japonica subspecies is responsible for their higher expression level of OsFRDL4 due to the increased number of cis-acting elements of ART1
OsFRDL4	OsWRKY22	Transcription factor WRKY22 promotes aluminum tolerance via activation of OsFRDL4 expression and enhancement of citrate secretion in rice (Oryza sativa).	 We define the role of OsWRKY22 in response to Al stress in rice by using mutation and transgenic complementation assays, and characterize the regulation of OsFRDL4 by OsWRKY22 via yeas one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and ChIP-quantitative PCR
OsFRDL4	OsWRKY22	Transcription factor WRKY22 promotes aluminum tolerance via activation of OsFRDL4 expression and enhancement of citrate secretion in rice (Oryza sativa).	 We next show that OsWRKY22 is localized in the nucleus, functions as a transcriptional activator and is able to bind to the promoter of OsFRDL4 via W-box elements
OsFRDL4	OsWRKY22	Transcription factor WRKY22 promotes aluminum tolerance via activation of OsFRDL4 expression and enhancement of citrate secretion in rice (Oryza sativa).	 Finally, we find that both OsFRDL4 expression and Al-induced citrate secretion are significantly lower in art1 oswrky22 double mutants than in the respective single mutants
OsFRDL4	OsWRKY22	Transcription factor WRKY22 promotes aluminum tolerance via activation of OsFRDL4 expression and enhancement of citrate secretion in rice (Oryza sativa).	 We conclude that OsWRKY22 promotes Al-induced increases in OsFRDL4 expression, thus enhancing Al-induced citrate secretion and Al tolerance in rice
