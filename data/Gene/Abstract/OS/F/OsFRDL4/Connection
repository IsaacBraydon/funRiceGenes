ART1	OsFRDL4	An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice	 Furthermore, the OsFRDL4 expression was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor for Al tolerance
OsFRDL2	OsFRDL4	Functional analysis of a MATE gene OsFRDL2 revealed its involvement in Al-induced secretion of citrate, but less contribution to Al tolerance in rice.	 A double mutant between osfrdl2 and osfrdl4 or osfrdl1 did not further decrease the Al-induced citrate secretion and Fe translocation compared with the single mutant
