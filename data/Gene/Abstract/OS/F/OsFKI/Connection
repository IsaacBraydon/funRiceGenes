OsFKI	OsFKII	Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice	Two cDNA clones, OsFKI and OsFKII, encoding fructokinase (EC 2
OsFKI	OsFKII	Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice	In contrast, OsFKII cDNA encoded a deduced protein of 336 amino acids that shared only 64% amino acid identity with OsFKI
OsFKI	OsFKII	Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice	The identity of OsFKI and OsFKII as fructokinases was confirmed by the expression of enzyme activity in E
OsFKI	OsFKII	Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice	Although both OsFKI and OsFKII utilized fructose as substrate, only OsFKII activity was strongly inhibited at a high fructose concentration
OsFKI	OsFKII	Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice	The mRNA corresponding to OsFKII accumulated at high levels in developing rice grains, whereas there were only low levels of OsFKI transcripts in immature seeds
