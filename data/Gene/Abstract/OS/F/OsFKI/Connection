OsFKI	OsFKII	Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice	Two cDNA clones, OsFKI and OsFKII, encoding fructokinase (EC 2| In contrast, OsFKII cDNA encoded a deduced protein of 336 amino acids that shared only 64% amino acid identity with OsFKI| The identity of OsFKI and OsFKII as fructokinases was confirmed by the expression of enzyme activity in E| Although both OsFKI and OsFKII utilized fructose as substrate, only OsFKII activity was strongly inhibited at a high fructose concentration| The mRNA corresponding to OsFKII accumulated at high levels in developing rice grains, whereas there were only low levels of OsFKI transcripts in immature seeds
