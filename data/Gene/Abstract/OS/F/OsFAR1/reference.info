OsFAR1 encodes a fatty acyl-CoA reductase involved in biosynthesis of primary alcohols and plays an important role in drought stress response in rice. Cuticular waxes cover the outermost surface of terrestrial plants and contribute to inhibiting nonstomatal water loss and improving plant drought resistance. Primary alcohols are the most abundant components in the leaf cuticular waxes of rice (Oryza sativa), but the biosynthesis and regulation of primary alcohol remain largely unknown in rice. Here, we identified and characterized an OsFAR1 gene belonging to the fatty acyl-CoA reductases (FARs) via a homology-based approach in rice. OsFAR1 was activated by abiotic stresses and abscisic acid, resulting in increased production of primary alcohol in rice. Heterologous expression of OsFAR1 enhanced the amounts of C22:0 and C24:0 primary alcohols in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and C24:0 to C32:0 primary alcohols in Arabidopsis. Similarly, OsFAR1 overexpression significantly increased the content of C24:0 to C30:0 primary alcohols on rice leaves. Finally, OsFAR1 overexpression lines exhibited reduced cuticle permeability and enhanced drought tolerance in rice and Arabidopsis. Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsFAR1 is involved in rice primary alcohol biosynthesis and plays an important role in responding to drought and other environmental stresses.
