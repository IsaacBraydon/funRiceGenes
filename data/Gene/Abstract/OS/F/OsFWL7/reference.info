NA	Targeted Mutagenesis of the Rice FW 2.2-Like Gene Family Using the CRISPR/Cas9 System Reveals OsFWL4 as a Regulator of Tiller Number and Plant Yield in Rice.	2020	Int J Mol Sci	Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Regional Modern Agriculture &amp; Environmental Protection/Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Eco-Agricultural Biotechnology around Hongze Lake, Huaiyin Normal University, Huai&#39;an 223300, China.	The FW2.2-like (FWL) genes encode cysteine-rich proteins with a placenta-specific 8 domain. They play roles in cell division and organ size control, response to rhizobium infection, and metal ion homeostasis in plants. Here, we target eight rice FWL genes using the CRISPR/Cas9 system delivered by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. We successfully generate transgenic T(0) lines for 15 of the 16 targets. The targeted mutations are detected in the T(0) lines of all 15 targets and the average mutation rate is found to be 81.6%. Transfer DNA (T-DNA) truncation is a major reason for the failure of mutagenesis in T(0) plants. T-DNA segregation analysis reveals that the T-DNA inserts in transgenic plants can be easily eliminated in the T(1) generation. Of the 30 putative off-target sites examined, unintended mutations are detected in 13 sites. Phenotypic analysis reveals that tiller number and plant yield of OsFWL4 gene mutants are significantly greater than those of the wild type. Flag leaves of OsFWL4 gene mutants are wider than those of the wild type. The increase in leaf width of the mutants is caused by an increase in cell number. Additionally, grain length of OsFWL1 gene mutants is higher than that of the wild type. Our results suggest that transgene-free rice plants with targeted mutations can be produced in the T(1) generation using the Agrobacterium-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 system and that the OsFWL4 gene is a negative regulator of tiller number and plant yield.
NA	Mutation in OsFWL7 Affects Cadmium and Micronutrient Metal Accumulation in Rice.	2021	Int J Mol Sci	Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Regional Modern Agriculture &amp; Environmental Protection/Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Eco-Agricultural Biotechnology around Hongze Lake, Huaiyin Normal University, Huai&#39;an 223300, China.	Micronutrient metals, such as Mn, Cu, Fe, and Zn, are essential heavy metals for plant growth and development, while Cd is a nonessential heavy metal that is highly toxic to both plants and humans. Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Cd and micronutrient metal accumulation in plants remains incomplete. Here, we show that OsFWL7, an FW2.2-like (FWL) family gene in Oryza sativa, is preferentially expressed in the root and encodes a protein localized to the cell membrane. The osfwl7 mutation reduces both the uptake and the root-to-shoot translocation of Cd in rice plants. Additionally, the accumulation of micronutrient metals, including Mn, Cu, and Fe, was lower in osfwl7 mutants than in the wildtype plants under normal growth conditions. Moreover, the osfwl7 mutation affects the expression of several heavy metal transporter genes. Protein interaction analyses reveal that rice FWL proteins interact with themselves and one another, and with several membrane microdomain marker proteins. Our results suggest that OsFWL7 is involved in Cd and micronutrient metal accumulation in rice. Additionally, rice FWL proteins may form oligomers and some of them may be located in membrane microdomains.
