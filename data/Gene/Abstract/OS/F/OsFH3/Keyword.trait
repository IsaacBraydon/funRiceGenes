OsFH3	dwarf	OsFH3 Encodes a Type II Formin Required for Rice Morphogenesis.	 osfh3 osfh5 mutants were dwarf with more severe developmental defectiveness
OsFH3	phosphatase	OsFH3 Encodes a Type II Formin Required for Rice Morphogenesis.	 Furthermore, its N-terminal phosphatase and tensin homolog domain played a key role in modulating OsFH3 localization at intersections of AF and punctate structures of microtubules, which differed from other reported plant formins
