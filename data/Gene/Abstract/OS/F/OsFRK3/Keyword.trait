OsFRK3	grain	New Fructokinase, OsFRK3, Regulates Starch Accumulation and Grain Filling in Rice.	 Evidently decreased grain width, grain thickness, and endosperm filling rate were detected in the osfrk3 mutants (osfrk3-1 and osfrk3-2) compared with those of the WT
OsFRK3	starch	New Fructokinase, OsFRK3, Regulates Starch Accumulation and Grain Filling in Rice.	 These results suggest that OsFRK3 may positively regulate the accumulation of starch through influencing the sugar metabolism
OsFRK3	endosperm	New Fructokinase, OsFRK3, Regulates Starch Accumulation and Grain Filling in Rice.	 Evidently decreased grain width, grain thickness, and endosperm filling rate were detected in the osfrk3 mutants (osfrk3-1 and osfrk3-2) compared with those of the WT
OsFRK3	sugar	New Fructokinase, OsFRK3, Regulates Starch Accumulation and Grain Filling in Rice.	 These results suggest that OsFRK3 may positively regulate the accumulation of starch through influencing the sugar metabolism
OsFRK3	grain width	New Fructokinase, OsFRK3, Regulates Starch Accumulation and Grain Filling in Rice.	 Evidently decreased grain width, grain thickness, and endosperm filling rate were detected in the osfrk3 mutants (osfrk3-1 and osfrk3-2) compared with those of the WT
