Plant Physiol.-2009-Yokosho-297-305.pdf	OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice	2009	Plant Physiol	Research Institute for Bioresources, Okayama University, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan.	Multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporters represent a large family in plants, but their functions are poorly understood. Here, we report the function of a rice (Oryza sativa) MATE gene (Os03g0216700, OsFRDL1), the closest homolog of barley (Hordeum vulgare) HvAACT1 (aluminum [Al]-activated citrate transporter 1), in terms of metal stress (iron [Fe] deficiency and Al toxicity). This gene was mainly expressed in the roots and the expression level was not affected by either Fe deficiency or Al toxicity. Knockout of this gene resulted in leaf chlorosis, lower leaf Fe concentration, higher accumulation of zinc and manganese concentration in the leaves, and precipitation of Fe in the root's stele. The concentration of citrate and ferric iron in the xylem sap was lower in the knockout line compared to the wild-type rice. Heterologous expression of OsFRDL1 in Xenopus oocytes showed transport activity for citrate. Immunostaining showed that OsFRDL1 was localized at the pericycle cells of the roots. On the other hand, there was no difference in the Al-induced secretion of citrate from the roots between the knockout line and the wild-type rice. Taken together, our results indicate that OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter localized at the pericycle cells, which is necessary for efficient translocation of Fe to the shoot as a Fe-citrate complex.

Of these, we cloned three OsFRDL genes from a cDNA library prepared from iron-deficient rice roots: OsFRDL1, OsFRDL2, and OsFRDL3. OsFRDL1 was expressed weakly in Fe-sufficient roots, and slight expression was induced in the roots of Fe-deficient plants. OsFRDL2 was expressed constitutively in both roots and leaves, and Fe deficiency reduced its expression in leaves. OsFRDL3 was expressed in leaves, but not in roots; Fe deficiency induced slight expression in leaves. An OsFRDL1-sGFP fusion protein was localized in the plasma membrane in onion epidermal cells. The promoter GUS analysis showed that OsFRDL1 was localized in the cells involved in long-distance transport, in both Fe-sufficient and Fe-deficient plants. Furthermore, OsFRDL1 expression was observed during the reproductive stage. These results suggest that OsFRDL1 is a transporter that resides in the plasma membrane of cells involved in long-distant transport.
