OsFD2	transcription factor	Florigen repression complexes involving rice CENTRORADIALIS2 regulate grain size.	 Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that GF14f directly interacts with the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, OsFD2
OsFD2	spikelet	Florigen repression complexes involving rice CENTRORADIALIS2 regulate grain size.	 We found that OsFD2 also influences grain size by controlling cell expansion and division in the spikelet hull
OsFD2	grain	Florigen repression complexes involving rice CENTRORADIALIS2 regulate grain size.	 We found that OsFD2 also influences grain size by controlling cell expansion and division in the spikelet hull
OsFD2	grain size	Florigen repression complexes involving rice CENTRORADIALIS2 regulate grain size.	 We found that OsFD2 also influences grain size by controlling cell expansion and division in the spikelet hull
OsFD2	cell expansion	Florigen repression complexes involving rice CENTRORADIALIS2 regulate grain size.	 We found that OsFD2 also influences grain size by controlling cell expansion and division in the spikelet hull
