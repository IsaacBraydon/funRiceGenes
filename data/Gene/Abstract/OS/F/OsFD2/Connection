GF14f|OsGF14f	OsFD2	Florigen repression complexes involving rice CENTRORADIALIS2 regulate grain size.	 Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that GF14f directly interacts with the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, OsFD2
OsCEN2	OsFD2	Florigen repression complexes involving rice CENTRORADIALIS2 regulate grain size	Our results reveal the molecular mechanisms of the OsCEN2-GF14f-OsFD2 regulatory module in controlling grain size.
