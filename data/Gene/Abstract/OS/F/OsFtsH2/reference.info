NA	Involvement of Abscisic Acid in PSII Photodamage and D1 Protein Turnover for Light-Induced Premature Senescence of Rice Flag Leaves.	2016	PLoS One	Institute of Crop Science, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	D1 protein in the PSII reaction center is the major target of photodamage, and it exhibits the highest turnover rate among all the thylakoid proteins. In this paper, rice psf (premature senescence of flag leaves) mutant and its wild type were used to investigate the genotype-dependent alteration in PSII photo-damage and D1 protein turnover during leaf senescence and its relation to ABA accumulation in senescent leaves. The symptom and extent of leaf senescence of the psf mutant appeared to be sunlight-dependent under natural field condition. The psf also displayed significantly higher levels of ABA accumulation in senescent leaves than the wild type. However, the premature senescence lesion of psf leaves could be alleviated by shaded treatment, concomitantly with the strikingly suppressed ABA level in the shaded areas of flag leaves. The change in ABA concentration contributed to the regulation of shade-delayed leaf senescence. The participation of ABA in the timing of senescence initiation and in the subsequent rate of leaf senescence was closely associated with PSII photodamage and D1 protein turnover during leaf senescence, in which the transcriptional expression of several key genes (psbA, psbB, psbC and OsFtsH2) involved in D1 protein biosynthesis and PSII repair cycle was seriously suppressed by the significantly increased ABA level. This response resulted in the low rate of D1 protein synthesis and impaired repair recovery in the presence of ABA. The psf showed evidently decreased D1 protein amount in the senescent leaves. Both the inhibition of de novo synthesized D1 protein and the slow rate of proteolytic removal for the photodamaged D1 protein was among the most crucial steps for the linkage between light-dependent leaf senescence and the varying ABA concentration in psf mutant leaves. OsFtsH2 transcriptional expression possibly played an important role in the regulation of D1 protein turnover and PSII repair cycle in relation to ABA mediated leaf senescence.
NA	The essential roles of OsFtsH2 in developing the chloroplast of rice.	2021	BMC Plant Biol	School of Biological and Chemical Engineering, NingboTech University, Ningbo, 315100, China.	BACKGROUND: Filamentation temperature-sensitive H (FtsH) is an ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease with ATPase activity, proteolysis activity and molecular chaperone-like activity. For now, a total of nine FtsH proteins have been encoded in rice, but their functions have not revealed in detail. In order to investigate the molecular mechanism of OsFtsH2 here, several osftsh2 knockout mutants were successfully generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. RESULTS: All the mutants exhibited a phenotype of striking albino leaf and could not survive through the stage of three leaves. OsFtsH2 was located in the chloroplast and preferentially expressed in green tissues. In addition, osftsh2 mutants could not form normal chloroplasts and had lost photosynthetic autotrophic capacity. RNA sequencing analysis indicated that many biological processes such as photosynthesis-related pathways and plant hormone signal transduction were significantly affected in osftsh2 mutants. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results suggested OsFtsH2 to be essential for chloroplast development in rice.
