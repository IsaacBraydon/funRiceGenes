NA	FRUCTOKINASE-LIKE PROTEIN 1 interacts with TRXz to regulate chloroplast development in rice.	2018	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China.	Chloroplast genes are transcribed by the PEP or NEP. FRUCTOKINASE-LIKE PROTEINS (FLNs) are phosphofructokinase-B (PfkB)-type carbohydrate kinases that act as part of the PEP complex; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying FLNs activity in rice remain elusive. Previously, we identified and characterized a heat-stress sensitive albino (hsa1) mutant in rice. Map-based cloning revealed that HSA1 encodes a putative OsFLN2. Here, we further demonstrated that knockdown or knockout of the OsFLN1, a close homolog of HSA1/OsFLN2, considerably inhibits chloroplast biogenesis and the fln1 knockout mutants created by CRISPR/Cas9 exhibit severe albino phenotype and seedling lethality. Moreover, OsFLN1 localizes to the chloroplast. Yeast two-hybrid, pull-down and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments revealed that OsFLN1 and HSA1/OsFLN2 interact with THIOREDOXINZ (OsTRXz) to regulate chloroplast development. In agreement with this, knockout of OsTRXz resulted in a similar albino and seedling lethality phenotype to that of the fln1 mutants. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis revealed that the transcription and translation of PEP-dependent genes were strongly inhibited in fln1 and trxz mutants, indicating that loss of OsFLN1, HSA1/OsFLN2, or OsTRXz function perturbs the stability of the transcriptionally active chromosome complex and PEP activity. These results show that OsFLN1 and HSA1/OsFLN2 contribute to chloroplast biogenesis and plant growth.
NA	The newly identified heat-stress sensitive albino 1 gene affects chloroplast development in rice.	2017	Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China.	High temperature, a major abiotic stress, significantly affects the yield and quality of crops in many parts of the world. Components of the photosynthetic apparatus are highly susceptible to thermal damage. Although the responses to acute heat stress have been studied intensively, the mechanisms that regulate chloroplast development under heat stress remain obscure, especially in crop plants. Here, we cloned and characterized the gene responsible for the heat-sensitive albino1 (hsa1) mutation in rice (Oryza sativa). The hsa1 mutant harbors a recessive mutation in a gene encoding fructokinase-like protein2 (FLN2); the mutation causes a premature stop codon and results in a severe albino phenotype, with defects in early chloroplast development. The color of hsa1 mutant plants gradually changed from albino to green at later stages of development at various temperatures and chloroplast biogenesis was strongly delayed at high temperature (32<U+202F>¡ãC). HSA1 expression was strongly reduced in hsa1 plants compared to wild type (WT). HSA1 localizes to the chloroplast and regulates chloroplast development. An HSA1 deletion mutant induced by CRISPR/Cas9 was heat sensitive but had a faster greening phenotype than the original hsa1 allele at all temperatures. RNA and protein levels of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase-dependent plastid genes were markedly reduced in hsa1 plants compared to WT. These results demonstrated that HSA1 plays important roles in chloroplast development at early stages, and functions in protecting chloroplasts under heat stress at later stages in rice.
NA	Characterization of dwarf and narrow leaf ( dnl-4) mutant in rice	2020	Plant Signal Behav	College of Life Science and Natural Resources, Dong-A University , Busan, Korea.	Height and leaf morphology are important agronomic traits of the major crop plant rice (Oryza sativa). In previous studies, the dwarf and narrow leaf genes (dnl1, dnl2 and dnl3) have identified in rice. Using the Ac/Ds knockout system, we found a new dwarf and narrow leaf (dnl) mutant and identified mutated gene. The dnl-4 mutant showed reduced plant height and leaf blade width compared to the wild type, and increased leaf inclination. The morphological defects of the mutant were caused by the suppressed expression of the DNL-4 gene, which encodes a pfkB carbohydrate kinase protein. These results suggest that DNL-4 expression is involved in modulating plant height and leaf growth. Furthermore, DNL-4 expression also affects productivity in rice: the dnl-4 mutant exhibited reduced panicle length and grain width compared with the wild type. To understand DNL-4 function in rice, we analyzed the expression levels of leaf growth-related genes, such as NAL1, NAL7, and CSLD4, in the dnl-4 mutant. Expression of NAL1 and NAL7 was downregulated in the dnl-4 mutant compared to the wild type. The observation that DNL-4 expression corresponded with that of NAL1 and NAL7 is consistent with the narrow leaf phenotype of the dnl-4 mutant. These results suggest that DNL-4 regulates plant height and leaf structure in rice.
NA	A natural variation in the promoter of GRA117 affects carbon assimilation in rice.	2023	Planta	Key Laboratory of Rice Biology and Genetic Breeding in Northeast China (Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Areas), Rice Research Institute of Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, 110866, People&#x27;s Republic of China.	GRA117 is crucial in the process of carbon assimilation in rice as it regulates the development of chloroplasts, which in turn facilitates the Calvin-Benson cycle. Carbon assimilation is a critical process for plant growth, and despite numerous relevant studies, there are still unknown constraints. In this study, we isolated a rice mutant, gra117, which exhibited seedling albinism, delayed chloroplast development, decreased chlorophyll content, reduced yield, and seedling stress susceptibility, as compared to WT. Our further investigations revealed that gra117 had a significantly lower net photosynthetic carbon assimilation rate, as well as reduced levels of Rubisco enzyme activity, RUBP, PGA, carbohydrate, protein content, and dry matter accumulation. These findings provide evidence for decreased carbon assimilation in gra117. By mapping cloning, we discovered a 665Â bp insertion in the GRA117 promoter region that decreases GRA117 transcriptional activity and causes the gra117 phenotype. GRA117 encodes PfkB-type fructokinase-like 2, which is subcellularly localized in chloroplasts and is widely expressed in various rice tissues, particularly at high levels in leaf tissues. GRA117 transcription is regulated by the core region 1029Â bp before the start codon. Our quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot assays showed that GRA117 promotes the expression and translation of photosynthetic genes. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that GRA117 plays a significant role in photosynthetic carbon fixation, carbon metabolism, and chloroplast ribosome-related pathways. Our study supports that GRA117 promotes the Calvin-Benson cycle by regulating chloroplast development, ultimately leading to enhanced carbon assimilation in rice.
