NA	FRUCTOKINASE-LIKE PROTEIN 1 interacts with TRXz to regulate chloroplast development in rice.	2018	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China.	Chloroplast genes are transcribed by the PEP or NEP. FRUCTOKINASE-LIKE PROTEINS (FLNs) are phosphofructokinase-B (PfkB)-type carbohydrate kinases that act as part of the PEP complex; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying FLNs activity in rice remain elusive. Previously, we identified and characterized a heat-stress sensitive albino (hsa1) mutant in rice. Map-based cloning revealed that HSA1 encodes a putative OsFLN2. Here, we further demonstrated that knockdown or knockout of the OsFLN1, a close homolog of HSA1/OsFLN2, considerably inhibits chloroplast biogenesis and the fln1 knockout mutants created by CRISPR/Cas9 exhibit severe albino phenotype and seedling lethality. Moreover, OsFLN1 localizes to the chloroplast. Yeast two-hybrid, pull-down and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments revealed that OsFLN1 and HSA1/OsFLN2 interact with THIOREDOXINZ (OsTRXz) to regulate chloroplast development. In agreement with this, knockout of OsTRXz resulted in a similar albino and seedling lethality phenotype to that of the fln1 mutants. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis revealed that the transcription and translation of PEP-dependent genes were strongly inhibited in fln1 and trxz mutants, indicating that loss of OsFLN1, HSA1/OsFLN2, or OsTRXz function perturbs the stability of the transcriptionally active chromosome complex and PEP activity. These results show that OsFLN1 and HSA1/OsFLN2 contribute to chloroplast biogenesis and plant growth.
NA	The newly identified heat-stress sensitive albino 1 gene affects chloroplast development in rice.	2017	Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China.	High temperature, a major abiotic stress, significantly affects the yield and quality of crops in many parts of the world. Components of the photosynthetic apparatus are highly susceptible to thermal damage. Although the responses to acute heat stress have been studied intensively, the mechanisms that regulate chloroplast development under heat stress remain obscure, especially in crop plants. Here, we cloned and characterized the gene responsible for the heat-sensitive albino1 (hsa1) mutation in rice (Oryza sativa). The hsa1 mutant harbors a recessive mutation in a gene encoding fructokinase-like protein2 (FLN2); the mutation causes a premature stop codon and results in a severe albino phenotype, with defects in early chloroplast development. The color of hsa1 mutant plants gradually changed from albino to green at later stages of development at various temperatures and chloroplast biogenesis was strongly delayed at high temperature (32<U+202F>°„C). HSA1 expression was strongly reduced in hsa1 plants compared to wild type (WT). HSA1 localizes to the chloroplast and regulates chloroplast development. An HSA1 deletion mutant induced by CRISPR/Cas9 was heat sensitive but had a faster greening phenotype than the original hsa1 allele at all temperatures. RNA and protein levels of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase-dependent plastid genes were markedly reduced in hsa1 plants compared to WT. These results demonstrated that HSA1 plays important roles in chloroplast development at early stages, and functions in protecting chloroplasts under heat stress at later stages in rice.
