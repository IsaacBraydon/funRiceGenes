pp1400580.pdf	The role of OsBRI1 and its homologous genes, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, in rice	2006	Plant Physiol	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	Since first identifying two alleles of a rice (Oryza sativa) brassinosteroid (BR)-insensitive mutant, d61, that were also defective in an orthologous gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1), we have isolated eight additional alleles, including null mutations, of the rice BRI1 gene OsBRI1. The most severe mutant, d61-4, exhibited severe dwarfism and twisted leaves, although pattern formation and differentiation were normal. This severe shoot phenotype was caused mainly by a defect in cell elongation and the disturbance of cell division after the determination of cell fate. In contrast to its severe shoot phenotype, the d61-4 mutant had a mild root phenotype. Concomitantly, the accumulation of castasterone, the active BR in rice, was up to 30-fold greater in the shoots, while only 1.5-fold greater in the roots. The homologous genes for OsBRI1, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, were highly expressed in roots but weakly expressed in shoots, and their expression was higher in d61-4 than in the wild type. Based on these observations, we conclude that OsBRI1 is not essential for pattern formation or organ initiation, but is involved in organ development through controlling cell division and elongation. In addition, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3 are at least partly involved in BR perception in the roots.
NA	Gene Expression Dynamics in Rice Peduncles at the Heading Stage	2020	Front Genet	Grass Genetics and Informatics Group, School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.	Improving grain yield in the staple food crop rice has been long sought goal of plant biotechnology. One of the traits with significant impact on rice breeding programs is peduncle elongation at the time of heading failing which leads to significant reduction in grain yield due to incomplete panicle exsertion. To decipher transcriptional dynamics and molecular players underlying peduncle elongation, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of elongating and non-elongating peduncles in two Indian cultivars, Swarna and Pokkali, at the time of heading. Along with genes associated with cell division and cell wall biosynthesis, we observed significant enrichment of genes associated with auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis/signaling in the elongating peduncles before heading in both the genotypes. Similarly, genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and mobilization, abiotic stress response along with cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene biosynthesis/signaling were enriched in non-elongating peduncles post heading. Significant enrichment of genes belonging to key transcription factor families highlights their specialized roles in peduncle elongation and grain filling before and after heading, respectively. A comparison with anther/pollen development-related genes provided 76 candidates with overlapping roles in anther/pollen development and peduncle elongation. Some of these are important for carbohydrate remobilization to the developing grains. These can be engineered to combat with incomplete panicle exsertion in male sterile lines and manipulate carbohydrate dynamics in grasses. Overall, this study provides baseline information about potential target genes for engineering peduncle elongation with implications on plant height, biomass composition and grain yields in rice.
