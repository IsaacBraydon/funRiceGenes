OsbZIP79	Overexpression of the bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP79 suppresses the production of diterpenoid phytoalexin in rice cells. |  Intriguingly, whereas OsbZIP79 transactivation activity was observed in a transient reporter assay, the overexpression of OsbZIP79 resulted in suppression of the elicitor-inducible expression of diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthetic genes, and thus caused a decrease in the accumulation of phytoalexin in rice cells	Overexpression of the bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP79 suppresses the production of diterpenoid phytoalexin in rice cells. |  Intriguingly, whereas OsbZIP79 transactivation activity was observed in a transient reporter assay, the overexpression of OsbZIP79 resulted in suppression of the elicitor-inducible expression of diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthetic genes, and thus caused a decrease in the accumulation of phytoalexin in rice cells
