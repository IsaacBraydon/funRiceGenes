OsbZIP79|OsTGA911	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	Overexpression of the bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP79 suppresses the production of diterpenoid phytoalexin in rice cells.	 Among the OsTGAP1-interacting protein candidates, a TGA factor OsbZIP79 was investigated to verify its physical interaction with OsTGAP1 and involvement in the regulation of phytoalexin production
OsbZIP79|OsTGA911	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	Overexpression of the bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP79 suppresses the production of diterpenoid phytoalexin in rice cells.	 An in vitro pull-down assay demonstrated that OsTGAP1 and OsbZIP79 exhibited a heterodimeric as well as a homodimeric interaction
OsbZIP79|OsTGA911	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	Overexpression of the bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP79 suppresses the production of diterpenoid phytoalexin in rice cells.	 A bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis also showed the interaction between OsTGAP1 and OsbZIP79 in vivo
OsbZIP79|OsTGA911	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	Overexpression of the bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP79 suppresses the production of diterpenoid phytoalexin in rice cells.	 These results suggest that OsbZIP79 functions as a negative regulator of phytoalexin production triggered by a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor in rice cells, although it remains open under which conditions OsbZIP79 can work with OsTGAP1
