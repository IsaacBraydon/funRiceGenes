OsbZIP79|OsTGA911	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	Overexpression of the bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP79 suppresses the production of diterpenoid phytoalexin in rice cells.	Among the OsTGAP1-interacting protein candidates, a TGA factor OsbZIP79 was investigated to verify its physical interaction with OsTGAP1 and involvement in the regulation of phytoalexin production
OsbZIP79|OsTGA911	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	Overexpression of the bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP79 suppresses the production of diterpenoid phytoalexin in rice cells.	An in vitro pull-down assay demonstrated that OsTGAP1 and OsbZIP79 exhibited a heterodimeric as well as a homodimeric interaction
OsbZIP79|OsTGA911	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	Overexpression of the bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP79 suppresses the production of diterpenoid phytoalexin in rice cells.	A bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis also showed the interaction between OsTGAP1 and OsbZIP79 in vivo
OsbZIP79|OsTGA911	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	Overexpression of the bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP79 suppresses the production of diterpenoid phytoalexin in rice cells.	These results suggest that OsbZIP79 functions as a negative regulator of phytoalexin production triggered by a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor in rice cells, although it remains open under which conditions OsbZIP79 can work with OsTGAP1
OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsbZIP79|OsTGA911	Melatonin activates the OsbZIP79-OsABI5 module that orchestrates nitrogen and ROS homeostasis to alleviate nitrogen-limitation stress in rice.	 OsbZIP79 activated the transcriptionÂ of OsABI5, and OsABI5 then bound to the promoters of target genes, including genes involved in ROS homeostasis and nitrogen metabolism, activating their transcription
