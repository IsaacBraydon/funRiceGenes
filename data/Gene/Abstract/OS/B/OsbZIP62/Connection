OsbZIP62|OsFD7	OsSAUR11	Overexpression of a novel small auxin-up RNA gene, OsSAUR11, enhances rice deep rootedness.	 Through an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and gene expression analysis in transgenic rice, we found that the transcription factor OsbZIP62 can bind to the promoter of OsSAUR11 and promote its expression
