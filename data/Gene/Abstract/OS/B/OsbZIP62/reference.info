NA	A stress-responsive bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP62 improves drought and oxidative tolerance in rice.	2019	BMC Plant Biol	College of Plant Science &amp; Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Drought is a major abiotic stress factor that influences the yield of crops. Basic leucine zipper motif (bZIP) transcription factors play an important regulatory role in plant drought stress responses. However, the functions of a number of bZIP transcription factors in rice are still unknown.In this study, a novel drought stress-related bZIP transcription factor, OsbZIP62, was identified in rice. This gene was selected from a transcriptome analysis of several typical rice varieties with different drought tolerances. OsbZIP62 expression was induced by drought, hydrogen peroxide, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Overexpression of OsbZIP62-VP64 (OsbZIP62V) enhanced the drought tolerance and oxidative stress tolerance of transgenic rice, while osbzip62 mutants exhibited the opposite phenotype. OsbZIP62-GFP was localized to the nucleus, and the N-terminal sequence (amino acids 1-68) was necessary for the transcriptional activation activity of OsbZIP62. RNA-seq analysis showed that the expression of many stress-related genes (e.g., OsGL1, OsNAC10, and DSM2) was upregulated in OsbZIP62V plants. Moreover, OsbZIP62 could bind to the promoters of several putative target genes and could interact with stress/ABA-activated protein kinases (SAPKs).OsbZIP62 is involved in ABA signalling pathways and positively regulates rice drought tolerance by regulating the expression of genes associated with stress, and this gene could be used for the genetic modification of crops with improved drought tolerance.
NA	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	2020	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530004, China.	Background: Salt stress threatens crop yields all over the world. Many NAC transcription factors have been reported to be involved in different abiotic stress responses, but it remains unclear how loss of these transcription factors alters the transcriptomes of plants. Previous reports have demonstrated that overexpression of OsNAC45 enhances salt and drought tolerance in rice, and that OsNAC45 may regulate the expression of two specific genes, OsPM1 and OsLEA3-1.  Results: Here, we found that ABA repressed, and NaCl promoted, the expression of OsNAC45 in roots. Immunostaining showed that OsNAC45 was localized in all root cells and was mainly expressed in the stele. Loss of OsNAC45 decreased the sensitivity of rice plants to ABA and over-expressing this gene had the opposite effect, which demonstrated that OsNAC45 played an important role during ABA signal responses. Knockout of OsNAC45 also resulted in more ROS accumulation in roots and increased sensitivity of rice to salt stress. Transcriptome sequencing a
NA	OsbZIP62/OsFD7, a functional ortholog of FLOWERING LOCUS D (FD), regulates floral transition and panicle development in rice	2021	J Exp Bot	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi-110021, India.	We have characterized a rice bZIP protein coding gene OsbZIP62/OsFD7 that expresses preferentially in SAM and during early panicle developmental stages in comparison to other OsFDs characterised to date. Surprisingly, unlike OsFD1, OsFD7 interacts directly and more efficiently with OsFTLs; the interaction is strongest with OsFTL1 followed by Hd3a and RFT1, as confirmed by FLIM-FRET analysis. Also, OsFD7 is phosphorylated at its C-terminal end by OsCDPK41 and OsCDPK49 in vitro and this phosphorylated moiety is recognized by OsGF14 proteins. OsFD7 RNAi transgenics were late flowering; the transcript levels of some floral meristem identity genes (e.g. OsMADS14, OsMADS15 and OsMADS18) were also down-regulated. RNAi lines also exhibited dense panicle morphology with increase in the number of primary and secondary branches resulting in longer panicles and more seeds probably due to downregulation of SEPALLATA (SEP) family genes. In comparison to other FD-like proteins characterized thus far from rice, it appears that OsFD7 may have undergone diversification during evolution resulting in the acquisition of newer functions and thus playing dual role in floral transition and panicle development in rice.
