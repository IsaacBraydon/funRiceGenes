OsBBPI	jasmonic	Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors	 OsBBPI was found to be rapidly induced in rice seedling leaf in response to cut, exogenous jasmonic acid (JA), and two potent protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitors, cantharidin (CN) and endothall (EN), in a light/dark-, time- and dose-dependent manner; this induction was completely inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX), indicating a requirement for de novo protein synthesis in its induction
OsBBPI	seedling	Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors	 OsBBPI was found to be rapidly induced in rice seedling leaf in response to cut, exogenous jasmonic acid (JA), and two potent protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitors, cantharidin (CN) and endothall (EN), in a light/dark-, time- and dose-dependent manner; this induction was completely inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX), indicating a requirement for de novo protein synthesis in its induction
OsBBPI	salicylic acid	Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors	 However, a simultaneous application of salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA), with JA, respectively, completely blocked OsBBPI gene expression, whereas kinetin (KN) was only partially effective
OsBBPI	leaf	Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors	 OsBBPI was found to be rapidly induced in rice seedling leaf in response to cut, exogenous jasmonic acid (JA), and two potent protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitors, cantharidin (CN) and endothall (EN), in a light/dark-, time- and dose-dependent manner; this induction was completely inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX), indicating a requirement for de novo protein synthesis in its induction
OsBBPI	 ja 	Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors	 Taken together, these results suggest that among the phytohormones tested here, JA and ethylene play important role(s) in regulating OsBBPI expression, with an intimate interaction with light signals
OsBBPI	phytohormone	Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors	 Taken together, these results suggest that among the phytohormones tested here, JA and ethylene play important role(s) in regulating OsBBPI expression, with an intimate interaction with light signals
OsBBPI	ethylene	Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors	 Besides JA, it was found that the ethylene generator ethephon (ET) also had an enhancing effect on OsBBPI transcript, suggesting a direct effect of ethylene on OsBBPI expression
OsBBPI	ethylene	Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors	 Taken together, these results suggest that among the phytohormones tested here, JA and ethylene play important role(s) in regulating OsBBPI expression, with an intimate interaction with light signals
OsBBPI	 ABA 	Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors	 To the best of our knowledge, complete inhibition of JA-induced OsBBPI expression by SA is the first report in monocots, and with ABA in plants
OsBBPI	jasmonic acid	Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors	 OsBBPI was found to be rapidly induced in rice seedling leaf in response to cut, exogenous jasmonic acid (JA), and two potent protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitors, cantharidin (CN) and endothall (EN), in a light/dark-, time- and dose-dependent manner; this induction was completely inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX), indicating a requirement for de novo protein synthesis in its induction
OsBBPI	 sa 	Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors	 To the best of our knowledge, complete inhibition of JA-induced OsBBPI expression by SA is the first report in monocots, and with ABA in plants
