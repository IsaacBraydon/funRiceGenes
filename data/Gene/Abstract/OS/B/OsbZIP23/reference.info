R. China	The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors form a large gene family that is important in pathogen defense, light and stress signaling, etc. The Completed whole genome sequences of model plants Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa) constitute a valuable resource for genome-wide analysis and genomic comparative analysis, as they are representatives of the two major evolutionary lineages within the angiosperms: the monocotyledons and the dicotyledons. In this study, bioinformatics analysis identified 74, 89 and 88 bZIP genes respectively in Arabidopsis, rice and poplar. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of this gene family is presented, including the gene structure, phylogeny, chromosome distribution, conserved motifs. As a result, the plant bZIPs were organized into 10 subfamilies on basis of phylogenetic relationship. Gene duplication events during the family evolution history were also investigated. And it was further concluded that chromosomal/segmental duplication might have played a key role in gene expansion of bZIP gene family.
1755.pdf	Constitutive activation of transcription factor OsbZIP46 improves drought tolerance in rice	2012	Plant Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	OsbZIP46 is one member of the third subfamily of bZIP transcription factors in rice (Oryza sativa). It has high sequence similarity to ABA-responsive element binding factor (ABF/AREB) transcription factors ABI5 and OsbZIP23, two transcriptional activators positively regulating stress tolerance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice, respectively. Expression of OsbZIP46 was strongly induced by drought, heat, hydrogen peroxide, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment; however, it was not induced by salt and cold stresses. Overexpression of the native OsbZIP46 gene increased ABA sensitivity but had no positive effect on drought resistance. The activation domain of OsbZIP46 was defined by a series of deletions, and a region (domain D) was identified as having a negative effect on the activation. We produced a constitutive active form of OsbZIP46 (OsbZIP46CA1) with a deletion of domain D. Overexpression of OsbZIP46CA1 in rice significantly increased tolerance to drought and osmotic stresses. Gene chip analysis of the two overexpressors (native OsbZIP46 and the constitutive active form OsbZIP46CA1) revealed that a large number of stress-related genes, many of them predicted to be downstream genes of ABF/AREBs, were activated in the OsbZIP46CA1 overexpressor but not (even down-regulated) in the OsbZIP46 overexpressor. OsbZIP46 can interact with homologs of SnRK2 protein kinases that phosphorylate ABFs in Arabidopsis. These results suggest that OsbZIP46 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling and drought stress tolerance of rice depending on its activation. The stress-related genes activated by OsbZIP46CA1 are largely different from those activated by the other rice ABF/AREB homologs (such as OsbZIP23), further implying the value of OsbZIP46CA1 in genetic engineering of drought tolerance.
Nijhawan-2008-Genomic survey and g.pdf	Genomic survey and gene expression analysis of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family in rice	2008	Plant Physiol	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.	The basic leucine (Leu) zipper (bZIP) proteins compose a family of transcriptional regulators present exclusively in eukaryotes. The bZIP proteins characteristically harbor a bZIP domain composed of two structural features: a DNA-binding basic region and the Leu zipper dimerization region. They have been shown to regulate diverse plant-specific phenomena, including seed maturation and germination, floral induction and development, and photomorphogenesis, and are also involved in stress and hormone signaling. We have identified 89 bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Their chromosomal distribution and sequence analyses suggest that the bZIP transcription factor family has evolved via gene duplication. The phylogenetic relationship among rice bZIP domains as well as with bZIP domains from other plant bZIP factors suggests that homologous bZIP domains exist in plants. Similar intron/exon structural patterns were observed in the basic and hinge regions of their bZIP domains. Detailed sequence analysis has been done to identify additional conserved motifs outside the bZIP domain and to predict their DNA-binding site specificity as well as dimerization properties, which has helped classify them into different groups and subfamilies, respectively. Expression of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes has been analyzed by full-length cDNA and expressed sequence tag-based expression profiling. This expression profiling was complemented by microarray analysis. The results indicate specific or coexpression patterns of rice bZIP transcription factors starting from floral transition to various stages of panicle and seed development. bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice also displayed differential expression patterns in rice seedlings in response to abiotic stress and light irradiation. An effort has been made to link the structure and expression pattern of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice to their function, based on the information obtained from our analyses and earlier known results. This information will be important for functional characterization of bZIP transcription factors in rice.
pp1481938.pdf	Characterization of OsbZIP23 as a key player of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family for conferring abscisic acid sensitivity and salinity and drought tolerance in rice	2008	Plant Physiol	National Center of Plant Gene Research , National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	OsbZIP23 is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor family in rice (Oryza sativa). Expression of OsbZIP23 is strongly induced by a wide spectrum of stresses, including drought, salt, abscisic acid (ABA), and polyethylene glycol treatments, while other stress-responsive genes of this family are slightly induced only by one or two of the stresses. Transactivation assay in yeast demonstrated that OsbZIP23 functions as a transcriptional activator, and the sequences at the N terminus (amino acids 1-59) and a region close to the C terminus (amino acids 210-240) are required for the transactivation activity. Transient expression of OsbZIP23-green fluorescent protein in onion (Allium cepa) cells revealed a nuclear localization of the protein. Transgenic rice overexpressing OsbZIP23 showed significantly improved tolerance to drought and high-salinity stresses and sensitivity to ABA. On the other hand, a null mutant of this gene showed significantly decreased sensitivity to a high concentration of ABA and decreased tolerance to high-salinity and drought stress, and this phenotype can be complemented by transforming the OsbZIP23 back into the mutant. GeneChip and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that hundreds of genes were up- or down-regulated in the rice plants overexpressing OsbZIP23. More than half of these genes have been annotated or evidenced for their diverse functions in stress response or tolerance. In addition, more than 30 genes that are possible OsbZIP23-specific target genes were identified based on the comparison of the expression profiles in the overexpressor and the mutant of OsbZIP23. Collectively, these results indicate that OsbZIP23 functions as a transcriptional regulator that can regulate the expression of a wide spectrum of stress-related genes in response to abiotic stresses through an ABA-dependent regulation pathway. We propose that OsbZIP23 is a major player of the bZIP family in rice for conferring ABA-dependent drought and salinity tolerance and has high potential usefulness in genetic improvement of stress tolerance.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs00299-013-1532-0.pdf	Overexpression of a new stress-repressive gene OsDSR2 encoding a protein with a DUF966 domain increases salt and simulated drought stress sensitivities and reduces ABA sensitivity in rice	2014	Plant Cell Rep	Xiamen Key Laboratory for Plant Genetics, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, China.	Domain of Unknown Function 966 (DUF966) gene family was found in the protein family database, which consisted of seven genes in rice. The proteins encoded by these genes contained one or two highly conserved DUF966 domains. The available data of public microarray databases implied that these genes might play crucial roles in plant response to abiotic stresses. In this study, a member of the DUF966 gene family, DUF966-stress repressive gene 2 in Oryza sativa (OsDSR2, Loc_Os01g62200), was cloned and its role in rice responding to salt and simulated drought stresses was functionally characterized. OsDSR2 was expressed mainly in nodes of stems and leaf blades from rice. Expression profile analysis of adversity showed that OsDSR2 had different transcriptional responses to salt, drought, cold, heat and oxidative (H2O2) stresses, as well as abscisic acid (ABA), methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, gibberellin acid and auxin treatments. Transient expression demonstrated that OsDSR2 was localized in the membrane and nucleus. Overexpression of OsDSR2 could increase salt and simulated drought (polyethyleneglycol)-stress sensitivities in rice by downregulating the expression of ABA- and stress-responsive genes including OsNCED4, SNAC1, OsbZIP23, P5CS, Oslea3 and rab16C. Furthermore, OsDSR2-overexpressing plants showed reduced ABA sensitivity during the post-germination stage. These results suggested that OsDSR2 negatively regulated rice response to salt and simulated drought stresses as well as ABA signaling, which provided some useful data for understanding the functional roles of DUF966 family genes in abiotic stress responses in plants.
NA	Enhanced Gene Expression Rather than Natural Polymorphism in Coding Sequence of the OsbZIP23 Determines Drought Tolerance and Yield Improvement in Rice Genotypes.	2016	PLoS One	Adv. Lab. for Plant Genetic Engineering, Advanced Technology Development Center, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur 721302, India.	Drought is one of the major limiting factors for productivity of crops including rice (Oryza sativa L.). Understanding the role of allelic variations of key regulatory genes involved in stress-tolerance is essential for developing an effective strategy to combat drought. The bZIP transcription factors play a crucial role in abiotic-stress adaptation in plants via abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway. The present study aimed to search for allelic polymorphism in the OsbZIP23 gene across selected drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive rice genotypes, and to characterize the new allele through overexpression (OE) and gene-silencing (RNAi). Analyses of the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of the cloned OsbZIP23 gene revealed single nucleotide polymorphism at four places and a 15-nucleotide deletion at one place. The single-copy OsbZIP23 gene is expressed at relatively higher level in leaf tissues of drought-tolerant genotypes, and its abundance is more in reproductive stage. Cloning and sequence analyses of the OsbZIP23-promoter from drought-tolerant O. rufipogon and drought-sensitive IR20 cultivar showed variation in the number of stress-responsive cis-elements and a 35-nucleotide deletion at 5'-UTR in IR20. Analysis of the GFP reporter gene function revealed that the promoter activity of O. rufipogon is comparatively higher than that of IR20. The overexpression of any of the two polymorphic forms (1083 bp and 1068 bp CDS) of OsbZIP23 improved drought tolerance and yield-related traits significantly by retaining higher content of cellular water, soluble sugar and proline; and exhibited decrease in membrane lipid peroxidation in comparison to RNAi lines and non-transgenic plants. The OE lines showed higher expression of target genes-OsRab16B, OsRab21 and OsLEA3-1 and increased ABA sensitivity; indicating that OsbZIP23 is a positive transcriptional-regulator of the ABA-signaling pathway. Taken together, the present study concludes that the enhanced gene expression rather than natural polymorphism in coding sequence of OsbZIP23 is accountable for improved drought tolerance and yield performance in rice genotypes.
NA	Feedback regulation of ABA signaling and biosynthesis by a bZIP transcription factor targets drought resistance related genes.	2016	Plant Physiol	Huazhong Agricultural University CITY: Wuhan China [CN].	The OsbZIP23 transcription factor has been characterized for its essential role in drought resistance in rice, but the mechanism is unknown. In this study, we first investigated the transcriptional activation activity of OsbZIP23. A homolog of SnRK2 protein kinase SAPK2 was found to interact with and phosphorylate OsbZIP23 for its transcriptional activation. SAPK2 also interacted with OsPP2C49, an ABI1 homolog, which deactivated the SAPK2 to inhibit the transcriptional activation activity of OsbZIP23. Next, we performed genome-wide identification of OsbZIP23 targets by immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analyses in the OsbZIP23-overexpression, osbzip23 mutant, and wild-type rice under normal and drought stress conditions. OsbZIP23 directly regulates a large number of reported genes that function in stress response, hormone signaling, and developmental processes. Among these targets, we found that OsbZIP23 could positively regulate OsPP2C49, and overexpression of OsPP2C49 in rice resulted in significantly decreased sensitivity of the ABA response and rapid dehydration. Moreover, OsNCED4 (9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 4), a key gene in ABA biosynthesis, was also positively regulated by OsbZIP23. Together, our results suggest that OsbZIP23 acts as a central regulator in ABA signaling and biosynthesis, and drought resistance in rice.
NA	Synergistic regulation of drought-responsive genes by transcription factor OsbZIP23 and histone modification in rice.	2019	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Thousands of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) have been identified in rice under drought stress conditions. However, the regulatory mechanism of these DEGs remains largely unclear. Here, we report an interplay between histone H3K4me3 modification and transcription factor OsbZIP23 in the regulation of a dehydrin gene cluster under drought stress conditions in rice. When the H3K4me3 modification level was increased, the dehydrin gene expression levels were increased, and the binding levels of OsbZIP23 to the promoter of the dehydrin genes were also enhanced. Conversely, the H3K4me3 modification and dehydrin gene expression levels were down-regulated in the osbzip23 mutant under drought stress conditions. Our study uncovers a collaboration between transcription factor and H3K4me3 modification in the regulation of drought-responsive genes, which will help us to further understand the gene regulation mechanism under stress conditions in plants.

NA	OsMFT2 is involved in the regulation of ABA signaling-mediated seed germination through interacting with OsbZIP23/66/72 in rice 	2020	Plant J.	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Seed germination is a complex process involving various physical and biochemical cues, determined by exogenous and endogenous factors. Here, we identified a gene, OsMFT2, that negatively regulates seed germination in rice. OsMFT2 knock-out lines exhibited pre-harvest sprouting, whereas OsMFT2 overexpression lines showed delayed germination. RNA expression profiling showed that OsMFT2 was specifically expressed in seeds. Subcellular localization indicated that OsMFT2 was a nuclear protein. Exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatment of imbibed seeds and seedlings indicated that OsMFT2 altered ABA sensitivity during seed germination and post-germination growth. In vivo and in vitro assays showed that three bZIP transcription factors, OsbZIP23, OsbZIP66 and OsbZIP72, interacted with OsMFT2. OsbZIP23/66/72 bound to the promoter of Rab16A, a typical gene containing the ABA-responsive element, and OsMFT2 enhanced the binding to the Rab16A promoter. Moreover, several ABA-responsive genes were differentially expressed in the imbibed seeds of OsMFT2 transgenic lines and the wild type. The performance of the transgenic plants demonstrated that overexpressing OsbZIP23 rescued the pre-harvest sprouting phenotype and the decrease in ABA-signaling genes expression caused by OsMFT2 knock-out. All of these results demonstrate that OsMFT2 positively regulates ABA-responsive genes through interacting with OsbZIP23/66/72 and functions in seed germination. 
NA	The coordination of OsbZIP72 and OsMYBS2 with reverse roles regulates the transcription of OsPsbS1 in rice	2021	New Phytol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ), an intricate photoprotective process, plays fundamental roles in maintaining plant fitness. The PsbS protein is essential for the rapid induction of NPQ, and acts in a dose-dependent manner in leaves. However, little information is known on the transcriptional control of PsbS in land plants. Here we demonstrated that the expression of OsPsbS1 is directly upregulated by OsbZIP72 while repressed by OsMYBS2 in rice. We identified a new cis-element GACAGGTG in japonica OsPsbS1 promoter, to which OsbZIP72 could strongly bind and activate the expression of OsPsbS1. The new cis-element CTAATC confers specific binding for OsMYBS2 in japonica OsPsbS1 promoter. OsbZIP72 can be activated by SAPK1, and acts depending on the abscisic acid (ABA) signalling pathway. GF14A protein affects the repression activity of OsMYBS2 by regulating its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, and Ser53 is necessary for OsMYBS2 to be retained in the cytoplasm. The inducibility of OsPsbS1 transcription under high light conditions in OsbZIP72 knockout lines was greatly impaired, while the repression of OsPsbS1 transcription under a low light environment in OsMYBS2 knockout lines was significantly alleviated. These results reveal cross-talk among NPQ processes, the ABA signalling pathway and abiotic stress signalling. The elaborate mechanisms may help enhance photoprotection and improve photosynthesis in rice.
NA	Rice glycosyltransferase gene UGT2 functions in salt stress tolerance under the regulation of bZIP23 transcription factor.	2022	Plant Cell Rep	The Key Laboratory of Plant Development and Environment Adaptation Biology, Ministry of Education, School of Life Science, Shandong University, Qingdao, 266237, China.	Rice glycosyltransferase gene UGT2 was identified to play a crucial role in salt tolerance. The transcription factor OsbZIP23 was demonstrated to regulate the UGT2 expression under stress conditions. UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) play key roles in modulating plant responses to environmental challenges. In this study, we characterized a novel glycosyltransferase, UGT2, which plays an important role in salt stress responses in rice (Oryza sativa L). We found that seedlings overexpressing UGT2 exhibited better growth than wild type in shoot and root under hydroponic culture with salt stress treatments, while ugt2ko mutant lines suffered much more growth inhibition. When the soil-grown UGT2 transgenic plants were subjected to salt stress, we also found that ugt2ko mutant lines were severely withered and most of them died, while the overexpression lines grew well and had higher survival rate. Compared with wild-type plants, UGT2 overexpression greatly increased the expression levels of the reactive oxygen species scavenging genes and stress-responsive genes. Furthermore, the upstream regulatory mechanism of the UGT2 gene was identified and we found that a bZIP transcription factor, OsbZIP23, can bind to the UGT2 promoter and enhance the UGT2 transcription levels. This work reveals that OsbZIP23-UGT2 module may play a major role in regulating the salt stress tolerance in rice.
NA	A multiomic study uncovers a bZIP23-PER1A-mediated detoxification pathway to enhance seed vigor in rice.	2022	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	Seed vigor in crops is important in terms of improving grain quality and germplasm conservation; however, little is known about its regulatory mechanisms through the encoded proteome and gene network. Comparative analyses of transcriptome (RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]) and broadly targeted metabolic profiling of two subspecific rice cultivars with distinct seed vigor during accelerated aging revealed various biological pathways and metabolic processes as key influences explaining trait differences. RNA-seq coexpression regulatory network analyses identified several transcription factors, including bZIP23 and bZIP42, that act as nodes in the gene network. Importantly, transgenic seeds of overexpression of bZIP23 enhanced seed vigor, whereas its gene knockout reduced seed vigor, suggesting that the protein it encodes functions as a positive regulator. Similarly, overexpression and knockout of PER1A that encodes a key player in the detoxification pathway enhanced and decreased seed vigor, respectively. We further demonstrated a direct interaction of the PER1A promoter with bZIP23 in seeds, which activates the expression of PER1A, and the genetic evidence suggested that bZIP23 most likely functions in a common pathway with and acts upstream of PER1A to modulate seed vigor. In addition, the control of seed vigor by the bZIP23-PER1A module was connected with that of the abscisic acid signaling pathway. Collectively, we revealed the genetic architecture of variation in seed vigor and uncovered the bZIP23-PER1A-mediated detoxification pathway that enhances the trait in rice.
