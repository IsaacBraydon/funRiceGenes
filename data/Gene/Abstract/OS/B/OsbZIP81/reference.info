NA	OsbZIP81, A Homologue of Arabidopsis VIP1, May Positively Regulate JA Levels by Directly Targetting the Genes in JA Signaling and Metabolism Pathway in Rice.	2019	Int J Mol Sci	College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China. liudefang@webmail.hzau.edu.cn.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important food crops in the world. In plants, jasmonic acid (JA) plays essential roles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. As one of the largest transcription factors (TFs), basic region/leucine zipper motif (bZIP) TFs play pivotal roles through the whole life of plant growth. However, the relationship between JA and bZIP TFs were rarely reported, especially in rice. In this study, we found two rice homologues of Arabidopsis VIP1 (VirE2-interacting protein 1), OsbZIP81, and OsbZIP84. OsbZIP81 has at least two alternative transcripts, OsbZIP81.1 and OsbZIP81.2. OsbZIP81.1 and OsbZIP84 are typical bZIP TFs, while OsbZIP81.2 is not. OsbZIP81.1 can directly bind OsPIOX and activate its expression. In OsbZIP81.1 overexpression transgenic rice plant, JA (Jasmonic Acid) and SA (Salicylic acid) were up-regulated, while ABA (Abscisic acid) was down-regulated. Moreover, Agrobacterium, Methyl Jasmonic Acid (MeJA), and PEG6000 can largely induce OsbZIP81. Based on ChIP-Seq and Random DNA Binding Selection Assay (RDSA), we identified a novel cis-element OVRE (Oryza VIP1 response element). Combining ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, we obtained 1332 targeted genes that were categorized in biotic and abiotic responses, including Î±-linolenic acid metabolism and fatty acid degradation. Together, these results suggest that OsbZIP81 may positively regulate JA levels by directly targeting the genes in JA signaling and metabolism pathway in rice.
