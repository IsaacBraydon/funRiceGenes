OsbZIP81	 ja 	OsbZIP81, A Homologue of Arabidopsis VIP1, May Positively Regulate JA Levels by Directly Targetting the Genes in JA Signaling and Metabolism Pathway in Rice.	 Together, these results suggest that OsbZIP81 may positively regulate JA levels by directly targeting the genes in JA signaling and metabolism pathway in rice
