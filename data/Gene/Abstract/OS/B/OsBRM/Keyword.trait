OsBRM	development	SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPases SPLAYED and BRAHMA control embryo development in rice.	 Here, we constructed ossyd and osbrm mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and analyzed the effects of mutations on rice embryo development
OsBRM	development	SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPases SPLAYED and BRAHMA control embryo development in rice.	 We discovered that the ossyd and osbrm mutants exhibited severe defects during embryonic development, whereas endosperm development was normal
OsBRM	development	SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPases SPLAYED and BRAHMA control embryo development in rice.	 Collectively, our findings provide the basis for elucidating the function of OsSYD and OsBRM during embryo development in rice
OsBRM	shoot	SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPases SPLAYED and BRAHMA control embryo development in rice.	Chromatin remodeling ATPases OsSYD and OsBRM are involved in shoot establishment, and both affect OSH gene transcription
OsBRM	endosperm	SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPases SPLAYED and BRAHMA control embryo development in rice.	 We discovered that the ossyd and osbrm mutants exhibited severe defects during embryonic development, whereas endosperm development was normal
OsBRM	endosperm development	SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPases SPLAYED and BRAHMA control embryo development in rice.	 We discovered that the ossyd and osbrm mutants exhibited severe defects during embryonic development, whereas endosperm development was normal
OsBRM	embryo	SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPases SPLAYED and BRAHMA control embryo development in rice.	 Here, we constructed ossyd and osbrm mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and analyzed the effects of mutations on rice embryo development
OsBRM	embryo	SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPases SPLAYED and BRAHMA control embryo development in rice.	 Collectively, our findings provide the basis for elucidating the function of OsSYD and OsBRM during embryo development in rice
OsBRM	embryo development	SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPases SPLAYED and BRAHMA control embryo development in rice.	 Here, we constructed ossyd and osbrm mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and analyzed the effects of mutations on rice embryo development
OsBRM	embryo development	SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPases SPLAYED and BRAHMA control embryo development in rice.	 Collectively, our findings provide the basis for elucidating the function of OsSYD and OsBRM during embryo development in rice
