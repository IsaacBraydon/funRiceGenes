FCP1|OsCLE402	OsbZIP47	OsbZIP47 Is an Integrator for Meristem Regulators During Rice Plant Growth and Development.	 Further, we demonstrate that OsbZIP47 redox status affects its DNA binding affinity to a cis element in FCP1, a target locus
OsbZIP47	OSH1|Oskn1	OsbZIP47 Is an Integrator for Meristem Regulators During Rice Plant Growth and Development.	 Protein interaction assays showed OsbZIP47 partnerships with RICE HOMEOBOX1 (OSH1), RICE FLORICULA/LEAFY (RFL), and OsMADS1 transcription factors
OsbZIP47	OSH1|Oskn1	OsbZIP47 Is an Integrator for Meristem Regulators During Rice Plant Growth and Development.	 The meta-analysis of KD panicle transcriptomes in OsbZIP47KD, OsMADS1KD, and RFLKD transgenics, combined with global OSH1 binding sites divulge potential targets coregulated by OsbZIP47, OsMADS1, OSH1, and RFL
OsbZIP47	OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	OsbZIP47 Is an Integrator for Meristem Regulators During Rice Plant Growth and Development.	 Protein interaction assays showed OsbZIP47 partnerships with RICE HOMEOBOX1 (OSH1), RICE FLORICULA/LEAFY (RFL), and OsMADS1 transcription factors
