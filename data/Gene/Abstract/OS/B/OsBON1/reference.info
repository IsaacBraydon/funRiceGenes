Breeding for disease resistance is the most effective strategy to control diseases, particularly with broad-spectrum disease resistance in many crops. However, knowledge on genes and mechanism of broad-spectrum resistance and tradeoff between defense and growth in crops is limited. Here, we show that the rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 are critical suppressors of immunity. Both OsBON1 and OsBON3 changed their protein subcellular localization upon pathogen challenge. Knockdown of OsBON1 and dominant negative mutant of OsBON3 enhanced resistance to rice bacterial and fungal pathogens with either hemibiotrophic or necrotrophic life styles. The defense activation in OsBON1 knockdown mutants was associated with reduced growth, both of which were largely suppressed under high temperature. In contrast, overexpression of OsBON1 or OsBON3 decreased disease resistance and promoted plant growth. However, neither OsBON1 nor OsBON3 could rescue the dwarf phenotype of the Arabidopsis BON1 knockout mutant, suggesting an evolutionary divergence of the rice and Arabidopsis copine genes. Our study therefore shows that the rice copine genes play a negative role in regulating disease resistance and their expression level and protein location likely have a large impact on the balance between immunity and agronomic traits.
