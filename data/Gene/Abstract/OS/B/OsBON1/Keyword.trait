OsBON1	temperature	Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.	 The defense activation in OsBON1 knockdown mutants was associated with reduced growth, both of which were largely suppressed under high temperature
OsBON1	growth	Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.	 In contrast, overexpression of OsBON1 or OsBON3 decreased disease resistance and promoted plant growth
OsBON1	resistance	Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.	 Knockdown of OsBON1 and dominant negative mutant of OsBON3 enhanced resistance to rice bacterial and fungal pathogens with either hemibiotrophic or necrotrophic life styles
OsBON1	resistance	Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.	 In contrast, overexpression of OsBON1 or OsBON3 decreased disease resistance and promoted plant growth
OsBON1	defense	Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.	 The defense activation in OsBON1 knockdown mutants was associated with reduced growth, both of which were largely suppressed under high temperature
OsBON1	disease	Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.	Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.
OsBON1	disease	Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.	 In contrast, overexpression of OsBON1 or OsBON3 decreased disease resistance and promoted plant growth
OsBON1	disease resistance	Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.	Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.
OsBON1	disease resistance	Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.	 In contrast, overexpression of OsBON1 or OsBON3 decreased disease resistance and promoted plant growth
OsBON1	dwarf	Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.	 However, neither OsBON1 nor OsBON3 could rescue the dwarf phenotype of the Arabidopsis BON1 knockout mutant, suggesting an evolutionary divergence of the rice and Arabidopsis copine genes
OsBON1	R protein	Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.	 Both OsBON1 and OsBON3 changed their protein subcellular localization upon pathogen challenge
OsBON1	immunity	Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.	 Here, we show that the rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 are critical suppressors of immunity
OsBON1	pathogen	Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.	 Both OsBON1 and OsBON3 changed their protein subcellular localization upon pathogen challenge
OsBON1	plant growth	Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.	 In contrast, overexpression of OsBON1 or OsBON3 decreased disease resistance and promoted plant growth
OsBON1	broad-spectrum disease resistance	Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.	Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.
