We isolated and identified four rice genes, OsBIERF1 to OsBIERF4 (Oryza sativa benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced ethylene responsive transcriptional factors (ERF)) and analyzed their expressions in rice disease resistance response and under various abiotic stress conditions. The OsBIERF1-4 proteins contain conserved ERF domains, but are categorized into different classes of the previously characterized ERF proteins based on their structural organizations. OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF2 belong to Classes I and II, respectively; while OsBIRERF1 and OsBIERF4 are members of Class IV. OsBIERF3 could bind specifically to the GCC box sequence and was targeted to nucleus when transiently expressed in onion epidermis cells. Expression of OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 was induced by treatments with BTH and salicylic acid, chemical inducers capable of inducing disease resistance response in rice. In the BTH-treated rice seedlings, expression of OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 was further induced by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, the rice blast fungus, as compared with those in water-treated seedlings. OsBIERF1 and OsBIERF3 were activated in an incompatible interaction but not in compatible interaction between rice and M. grisea. Moreover, OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 were also up-regulated by salt, cold, drought and wounding. These results suggest that OsBIERF proteins may participate in different signaling pathways that mediate disease resistance response and stress responses to abiotic factors.
NA	Isolation of a novel protein phosphatase2C in rice and its response to gibberellin.	2018	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, University of Suwon, Hwaseong, South Korea; Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh, Bangladesh.	Protein phosphatase 2Cs (PP2Cs) have been referred to act as negative modulators of the protein kinase pathways involved in different environmental stress responses and developmental processes. In Arabidopsis, PP2Cs have been extensively studied and some are known to negatively regulate abscisic acid signaling. In rice, PP2Cs are scarcely characterized functionally. Here, we identified a novel PP2C from rice (OsPP2C34), which is highly inducible by gibberellin (GA) and expressed in various tissues. Subcellular localization analysis in maize protoplasts using a green fluorescence protein fusion vector localized OsPP2C34 to the cytosol. Genetic analysis of T-DNA insertional mutants revealed that plant height and internode length were significantly shorter in mutants than in corresponding wild types under GA treatment. The induction of the GA-inducible¦Á-amylase genes RAmy3E and OsAmy was delayed in mutant plants. The substrate of OsPP2C34 was identified by immunoblotting using anti serine/threonine antibodies. A 65<U+202F>kDa protein was phosphorylated in Ospp2c34-1 but dephosphorylated in the wild type during early germination stage. Overall, the present results indicated that OsPP2C34 is involved in¦Á-amylase expression of GA signal transduction pathway.
