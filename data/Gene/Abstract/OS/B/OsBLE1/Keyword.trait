OsBLE1	iaa	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel brassinolide enhanced gene OsBLE1 in Oryza sativa seedlings	 OsBLE1 expression was most responsive to BL in lamina joint in rice seedlings; besides, IAA and GA3 also enhanced its expression
OsBLE1	root	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel brassinolide enhanced gene OsBLE1 in Oryza sativa seedlings	 OsBLE1 expressed mainly in active tissues such as vascular bundles and root primordial
OsBLE1	lamina	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel brassinolide enhanced gene OsBLE1 in Oryza sativa seedlings	 OsBLE1 expression was most responsive to BL in lamina joint in rice seedlings; besides, IAA and GA3 also enhanced its expression
OsBLE1	seedling	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel brassinolide enhanced gene OsBLE1 in Oryza sativa seedlings	 OsBLE1 expression was most responsive to BL in lamina joint in rice seedlings; besides, IAA and GA3 also enhanced its expression| Results suggest that OsBLE1 might be involved in BL-regulated growth processes in rice seedlings|Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel brassinolide enhanced gene OsBLE1 in Oryza sativa seedlings
OsBLE1	vascular bundle	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel brassinolide enhanced gene OsBLE1 in Oryza sativa seedlings	 OsBLE1 expressed mainly in active tissues such as vascular bundles and root primordial
OsBLE1	growth	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel brassinolide enhanced gene OsBLE1 in Oryza sativa seedlings	 Transgenic rice expressing antisense OsBLE1 exhibits various degrees of repressed growth| Results suggest that OsBLE1 might be involved in BL-regulated growth processes in rice seedlings
