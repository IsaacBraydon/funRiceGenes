OsBOR4	pollen	Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process	 Quantitative PCR analysis and OsBOR4 promoter-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion revealed that OsBOR4 was both highly and specifically expressed in pollen
OsBOR4	pollen	Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process	 The pollen grains were viable and development of floral organs was normal in the homozygous osbor4 mutants
OsBOR4	pollen	Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process	 Pollen from osbor4 homozygous plants elongated fewer tubes on wild-type stigmas, and tube elongation of mutant pollen was less efficient compared with the wild-type pollen, suggesting reduced competence of osbor4 mutant pollen
OsBOR4	pollen	Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process	 The reduced competence of mutant pollen was further supported by the crosses of independent Tos17-inserted alleles of OsBOR4
OsBOR4	pollen	Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process	 Our results suggest that OsBOR4, a boron efflux transporter, is required for normal pollen germination and/or tube elongation
OsBOR4	pollen	Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process	Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process
OsBOR4	floral	Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process	 The pollen grains were viable and development of floral organs was normal in the homozygous osbor4 mutants
OsBOR4	transporter	Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process	 OsBOR4 is an active efflux transporter of B
OsBOR4	transporter	Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process	 Our results suggest that OsBOR4, a boron efflux transporter, is required for normal pollen germination and/or tube elongation

OsBOR4	grain	Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process	 The pollen grains were viable and development of floral organs was normal in the homozygous osbor4 mutants
OsBOR4	reproductive	Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process	 These results establish that OsBOR4 is essential for normal reproductive processes
