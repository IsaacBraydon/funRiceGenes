NA	OsBBX14 delays heading date by repressing florigen gene expression under long and short-day conditions in rice	2016	Plant Science	Shandong Rice Research Institute, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan 250100, PR China	B-box (BBX) proteins are zinc finger proteins containing B-box domains, which have roles in Arabidopsis growth and development. However, little is known concerning rice BBXs. Herein, we identified a rice BBX protein, Oryza sativa BBX14 (OsBBX14). OsBBX14 is highly expressed in flag leaf blades. OsBBX14 expression shows a diurnal rhythm under photoperiodic conditions and subsequent continuous white light. OsBBX14 is located in the nucleus and has transcriptional activation potential. OsBBX14-overexpression (OsBBX14-OX) lines exhibited delayed heading date under long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) conditions, whereas RNAi lines of OsBBX14 lines had similar heading dates to the WT. The florigen genes, Hd3a and RFT1, were downregulated in the OsBBX14-OX lines under LD and SD conditions. Under LD conditions, Hd1 was expressed higher in the OsBBX14-OX lines than in the wild type (WT), and the rhythmic expression of circadian clock genes, OsLHY and OsPRR1, was changed in OsBBX14-OX lines. Thus, OsBBX14 acts as a floral repressor by promoting Hd1 expression under LD conditions, probably because of crosstalk with the circadian clock. Under SD conditions, Ehd1 expression was reduced in OsBBX14-OX lines, but Hd1 and circadian clock gene expressions were unaffected, indicating that OsBBX14 acts as a repressor of Ehd1. Our findings suggested that OsBBX14 regulates heading date differently under LD and SD conditions.
NA	A Rice B-Box Protein, OsBBX14, Finely Regulates Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Rice.	2018	Int J Mol Sci	National Institute of Agricultural Science, Rural Development Administration, Jeonju 54874, Korea. kimdh143@jbnu.ac.kr.	Anthocyanins are responsible pigments for giving attractive colors of plant organs and nutraceutical benefits of grains. Anthocyanin biosynthesis is known to be regulated by transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. In rice (Oryza sativa), the R2R3 MYB transcription factor (TF) OsC1 and a bHLH TF, OsB2, were previously reported to control anthocyanin biosynthesis in vegetative tissues and seeds, respectively; however, the regulatory mechanisms of the anthocyanin biosynthesis by TFs remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified OsBBX14, a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana B-box domain protein 22 (AtBBX22), and investigated its function. The transcript level of OsBBX14 was high in pigmented rice seeds and gradually increased as the seeds matured. The ectopic expression of OsBBX14 in Arabidopsis resulted in a dramatic increase in anthocyanin accumulation in its seedlings. Using a steroid receptor-based inducible activation system, OsBBX14 and OsHY5 were found to directly activate OsC1 or OsB2 in an independent or collaborative manner. Yeast two hybrid revealed that the second B-box domain of OsBBX14 physically interacts with the bZIP domain of OsHY5. These results suggest that the anthocyanin biosynthesis in rice is induced and finely tuned by OsBBX14 in collaboration with OsHY5.
NA	OsBBX14 promotes photomorphogenesis in rice by activating OsHY5L1 expression under blue light conditions.	2019	Plant Sci	Shandong Rice Research Institute, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan 250100, PR China. Electronic address: baibosdau@163.com.	In rice, OsBBX14, a B-box (BBX) transcription factor, reportedly delays heading. Here, we revealed that OsBBX14 positively regulates rice photomorphogenesis. The OsBBX14-overexpressing (OsBBX14-OX) seedlings were hypersensitive to light, especially blue light, and exhibited dwarfism, while the OsBBX14 knock-out plants (osbbx14) were taller than wild-type plants under blue light. Histological analyses indicated that the observed dwarfism was mainly due to decreased cell length. Additionally, OsBBX14 abundance (mRNA and protein levels) was influenced by different light wavelengths in a time-dependent manner. The expression levels of HY5Ls (LONG HYPOCOTYL 5 LIKE) and ELIPs (EARLY LIGHT-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN) genes, whose Arabidopsis thaliana homologs function as positive regulators in the light signaling pathway, were significantly upregulated in OsBBX14-OX lines. In contrast, the expression of genes related to cell wall organization and dwarfism was downregulated in OsBBX14-OX lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirmed that OsBBX14 binds to the T/G-box of HY5L1 (LONG HYPOCOTYL 5 LIKE 1) promoter. LUC complementation imaging (LCI) results suggested that OsBBX14 had physical interaction with OsCRY2 protein. Collectively, in response to blue light, OsBBX14 promotes photomorphogenesis, probably by directly or indirectly regulating the expression of HY5L1 or other genes related to cell wall organization and dwarfism.
NA	Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant. In addition to serving as a model plant for molecular genetic studies of monocots, rice is a staple crop for about half of the world population. Heading date is a critical agronomic trait, and many genes controlling heading date have been cloned during the last two decades. The mechanism of flowering in rice from recognition of day length by leaves to floral activation in the shoot apical meristem has been extensively studied. In this review, we summarize current progress on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice with emphasis on post-translational modifications of key regulators, including Heading Date 1 (Hd1), Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Grain Number, Plant Height, and Heading Date7 (Ghd7). The contribution of heading date genes to heterosis and the expansion of rice cultivation areas from low-latitude to high-latitude regions are also discussed. To overcome limitations of diverse genetic backgrounds used in heading date studies and to gain a clearer understanding of flowering in rice, we propose a systematic collection of genetic resources in a common genetic background. Strategies in breeding adapted cultivars by rational design are also discussed.
