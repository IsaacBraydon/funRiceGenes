Ehd1	OsBBX14	OsBBX14 delays heading date by repressing florigen gene expression under long and short-day conditions in rice	 Under SD conditions, Ehd1 expression was reduced in OsBBX14-OX lines, but Hd1 and circadian clock gene expressions were unaffected, indicating that OsBBX14 acts as a repressor of Ehd1
Hd1	OsBBX14	OsBBX14 delays heading date by repressing florigen gene expression under long and short-day conditions in rice	 Thus, OsBBX14 acts as a floral repressor by promoting Hd1 expression under LD conditions, probably because of crosstalk with the circadian clock
