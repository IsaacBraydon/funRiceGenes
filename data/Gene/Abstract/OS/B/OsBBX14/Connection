Ehd1	OsBBX14	OsBBX14 delays heading date by repressing florigen gene expression under long and short-day conditions in rice	Under SD conditions, Ehd1 expression was reduced in OsBBX14-OX lines, but Hd1 and circadian clock gene expressions were unaffected, indicating that OsBBX14 acts as a repressor of Ehd1
Hd1	OsBBX14	OsBBX14 delays heading date by repressing florigen gene expression under long and short-day conditions in rice	Thus, OsBBX14 acts as a floral repressor by promoting Hd1 expression under LD conditions, probably because of crosstalk with the circadian clock
Hd1	OsBBX14	OsBBX14 delays heading date by repressing florigen gene expression under long and short-day conditions in rice	Under SD conditions, Ehd1 expression was reduced in OsBBX14-OX lines, but Hd1 and circadian clock gene expressions were unaffected, indicating that OsBBX14 acts as a repressor of Ehd1
OsBBX14	OsC1	A Rice B-Box Protein, OsBBX14, Finely Regulates Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Rice.	 Using a steroid receptor-based inducible activation system, OsBBX14 and OsHY5 were found to directly activate OsC1 or OsB2 in an independent or collaborative manner
