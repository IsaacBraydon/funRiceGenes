OsBBX14	leaf	OsBBX14 delays heading date by repressing florigen gene expression under long and short-day conditions in rice	 OsBBX14 is highly expressed in flag leaf blades
OsBBX14	floral	OsBBX14 delays heading date by repressing florigen gene expression under long and short-day conditions in rice	 Thus, OsBBX14 acts as a floral repressor by promoting Hd1 expression under LD conditions, probably because of crosstalk with the circadian clock
OsBBX14	heading date	OsBBX14 delays heading date by repressing florigen gene expression under long and short-day conditions in rice	OsBBX14 delays heading date by repressing florigen gene expression under long and short-day conditions in rice
OsBBX14	heading date	OsBBX14 delays heading date by repressing florigen gene expression under long and short-day conditions in rice	 OsBBX14-overexpression (OsBBX14-OX) lines exhibited delayed heading date under long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) conditions, whereas RNAi lines of OsBBX14 lines had similar heading dates to the WT
OsBBX14	heading date	OsBBX14 delays heading date by repressing florigen gene expression under long and short-day conditions in rice	 Our findings suggested that OsBBX14 regulates heading date differently under LD and SD conditions
OsBBX14	nucleus	OsBBX14 delays heading date by repressing florigen gene expression under long and short-day conditions in rice	 OsBBX14 is located in the nucleus and has transcriptional activation potential
