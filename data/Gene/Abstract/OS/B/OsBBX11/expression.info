OsBBX11	 Furthermore, we found that the knockout mutants of two BBX genes, OsBBX11 and OsBBX19, which interact with the OsBTB97 protein at translation and transcriptional level, respectively, displayed lower OsBTB97 expression, suggesting the genetic relationship between the BTB protein and the BBX transcription factors in rice
