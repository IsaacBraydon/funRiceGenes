OsBBX11	transcription factor	OsBBX11 on qSTS4 links to salt tolerance at the seeding stage in Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica.	 In conclusion, this study identified OsBBX11 as a salt-tolerance gene, and one SNPs in the OsBBX11 promoter region can be used to identify its interacting transcription factors
OsBBX11	stress	OsBBX11 on qSTS4 links to salt tolerance at the seeding stage in Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica.	 Transgenic plants using knockout-based technology and demonstrated that Na(+) and K(+) in the roots of the functional-loss-type OsBBX11 were translocated largely to the leaves under 120 mmol/L NaCl compared with the wild-type, causing osbbx11 leaves to die after 12 days of salt stress due to an imbalance in osmotic pressure
