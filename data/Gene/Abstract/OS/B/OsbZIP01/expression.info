OsbZIP01|OsRE1	OsRE1 interacts with OsRIP1 to regulate rice heading date by finely modulating Ehd1 expression |  Osre1 confers an early heading phenotype due to elevated expression levels of Ehd1 |  OsRE1 is a nucleus-localized bZIP transcription factor with a diurnal rhythmic expression pattern |  Furthermore, we identified an OsRE1-interacting protein, OsRIP1, and demonstrated that OsRIP1 can repress the transcript expression of Ehd1 in an OsRE1-dependent manner |  Together, our results suggest that OsRE1 functions cooperatively with OsRIP1 to regulate heading date through finely modulating the expression of Ehd1
