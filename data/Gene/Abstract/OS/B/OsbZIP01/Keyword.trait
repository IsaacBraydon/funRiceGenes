OsbZIP01|OsRE1	transcription factor	OsRE1 interacts with OsRIP1 to regulate rice heading date by finely modulating Ehd1 expression	 OsRE1 is a nucleus-localized bZIP transcription factor with a diurnal rhythmic expression pattern
OsbZIP01|OsRE1	heading date	OsRE1 interacts with OsRIP1 to regulate rice heading date by finely modulating Ehd1 expression	OsRE1 interacts with OsRIP1 to regulate rice heading date by finely modulating Ehd1 expression
OsbZIP01|OsRE1	heading date	OsRE1 interacts with OsRIP1 to regulate rice heading date by finely modulating Ehd1 expression	 Our genetic data showed that OsRE1 and OsRIP1 may function upstream of Ehd1 in regulating heading date
OsbZIP01|OsRE1	heading date	OsRE1 interacts with OsRIP1 to regulate rice heading date by finely modulating Ehd1 expression	 Together, our results suggest that OsRE1 functions cooperatively with OsRIP1 to regulate heading date through finely modulating the expression of Ehd1
OsbZIP01|OsRE1	heading date	OsRE1 interacts with OsRIP1 to regulate rice heading date by finely modulating Ehd1 expression	 In addition, OsRE1 and OsRIP1 are two minor heading date regulators, which are more desirable for fine-tuning heading date to improve rice regional adaptability
OsbZIP01|OsRE1	adaptability	OsRE1 interacts with OsRIP1 to regulate rice heading date by finely modulating Ehd1 expression	 In addition, OsRE1 and OsRIP1 are two minor heading date regulators, which are more desirable for fine-tuning heading date to improve rice regional adaptability
