10.1007-BF02772762.pdf	Identification of a novel rice bZIP-type transcription factor gene,OsbZIP1, involved in response to infection ofMagnaporthe grisea	2012	Plant Molecular Biology Reporter	State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology and Department of Plant Pathology, China Agricultural University, 100094, Beijing, China	The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins belong to a large family of transcriptional factors, some of which are thought to be involved in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli. In this work, we cloned a novel bZIP gene from rice, designatedOsbZIP1, which is inducible in response to infection withMagnaporthe grisea. Sequence analysis showed that the deduced protein had a potential nuclear localization signal and 2 possible acidic activation domains. Results of transient expression experiments demonstrated that OsbZIP1 is localized in the nucleus. The ability of OsbZIP1 to activate the transcription of the reporter gene was also determined in yeast. Northern blotting analysis showed thatOsbZIP1 was constitutively expressed in the roots and strongly induced in rice leaves in response to infection with both the compatible race MS220 and incompatible race 131 ofM. grisea. Furthermore, OsbZIP1 expression could be rapidly induced in leaves treated with salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid. These results indicate that the OsbZIP1 may function as a transcription factor and may play a role in salicylic acid-dependent signal transduction pathway for defense of rice against pathogens.
10.1007-s11741-009-0216-3.pdf	Genome-wide analysis of basic leucine zipper transcription factor families in Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Populus trichocarpa	2009	Journal of Shanghai University (English Edition)	School of Life Sciences, Shanghai University, Shanghai, 200444, P. R. China	The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors form a large gene family that is important in pathogen defense, light and stress signaling, etc. The Completed whole genome sequences of model plants Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa) constitute a valuable resource for genome-wide analysis and genomic comparative analysis, as they are representatives of the two major evolutionary lineages within the angiosperms: the monocotyledons and the dicotyledons. In this study, bioinformatics analysis identified 74, 89 and 88 bZIP genes respectively in Arabidopsis, rice and poplar. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of this gene family is presented, including the gene structure, phylogeny, chromosome distribution, conserved motifs. As a result, the plant bZIPs were organized into 10 subfamilies on basis of phylogenetic relationship. Gene duplication events during the family evolution history were also investigated. And it was further concluded that chromosomal/segmental duplication might have played a key role in gene expansion of bZIP gene family.
Nijhawan-2008-Genomic survey and g.pdf	Genomic survey and gene expression analysis of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family in rice	2008	Plant Physiol	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.	The basic leucine (Leu) zipper (bZIP) proteins compose a family of transcriptional regulators present exclusively in eukaryotes. The bZIP proteins characteristically harbor a bZIP domain composed of two structural features: a DNA-binding basic region and the Leu zipper dimerization region. They have been shown to regulate diverse plant-specific phenomena, including seed maturation and germination, floral induction and development, and photomorphogenesis, and are also involved in stress and hormone signaling. We have identified 89 bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Their chromosomal distribution and sequence analyses suggest that the bZIP transcription factor family has evolved via gene duplication. The phylogenetic relationship among rice bZIP domains as well as with bZIP domains from other plant bZIP factors suggests that homologous bZIP domains exist in plants. Similar intron/exon structural patterns were observed in the basic and hinge regions of their bZIP domains. Detailed sequence analysis has been done to identify additional conserved motifs outside the bZIP domain and to predict their DNA-binding site specificity as well as dimerization properties, which has helped classify them into different groups and subfamilies, respectively. Expression of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes has been analyzed by full-length cDNA and expressed sequence tag-based expression profiling. This expression profiling was complemented by microarray analysis. The results indicate specific or coexpression patterns of rice bZIP transcription factors starting from floral transition to various stages of panicle and seed development. bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice also displayed differential expression patterns in rice seedlings in response to abiotic stress and light irradiation. An effort has been made to link the structure and expression pattern of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice to their function, based on the information obtained from our analyses and earlier known results. This information will be important for functional characterization of bZIP transcription factors in rice.
NA	OsRE1 interacts with OsRIP1 to regulate rice heading date by finely modulating Ehd1 expression	2020	Plant Biotechnology Journal	National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Heading date is a key agronomic trait affecting crop yield. In rice, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) is an important B-type response regulator in determination of heading date. Although many regulatory factors of Ehd1 expression have been functionally characterized, the direct regulators of Ehd1 largely remain to be identified. Here, we identified a new regulator of Ehd1, OsRE1, that directly binds to the A-box motif in the Ehd1 promoter. Osre1 confers an early heading phenotype due to elevated expression levels of Ehd1. OsRE1 is a nucleus-localized bZIP transcription factor with a diurnal rhythmic expression pattern. Furthermore, we identified an OsRE1-interacting protein, OsRIP1, and demonstrated that OsRIP1 can repress the transcript expression of Ehd1 in an OsRE1-dependent manner. Our genetic data showed that OsRE1 and OsRIP1 may function upstream of Ehd1 in regulating heading date. Together, our results suggest that OsRE1 functions cooperatively with OsRIP1 to regulate heading date through finely modulating the expression of Ehd1. In addition, OsRE1 and OsRIP1 are two minor heading date regulators, which are more desirable for fine-tuning heading date to improve rice regional adaptability.
