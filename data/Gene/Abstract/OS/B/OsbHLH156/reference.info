NA	A transcription factor OsbHLH156 regulates Strategy II iron acquisition through localizing IRO2 to the nucleus in rice.	2019	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310058, P. R. China.	Plants have evolved two strategies to acquire ferrous (Strategy I) or ferric (Strategy II) iron from soil. The Iron-related bHLH transcription factor 2 (IRO2) has been identified as a key regulator of iron acquisition (Strategy II) in rice. However, its mode of action, sub-cellular localization and binding partners are not clearly defined. Using RNA-seq analyses, we identified a novel bHLH-type transcription factor, OsbHLH156. The function of OsbHLH156 in Fe homeostasis was analyzed by characterization of the phenotypes, elemental content, transcriptome, interaction and subcellular localization of OsbHLH156 and IRO2. OsbHLH156 is primarily expressed in the roots and transcript abundance is greatly increased by Fe deficiency. Loss function of OsbHLH156 resulted in Fe-deficiency-induced chlorosis and reduced Fe concentration in the shoots under upland or Fe(III) supplied conditions. Transcriptome analyses revealed that the expression of most Fe-deficiency-responsive genes involved in Strategy II were not induced in osbhlh156-1 mutant. Furthermore, OsbHLH156 was required for nuclear localization of IRO2. We conclude that OsbHLH156 is required for a Strategy II uptake mechanism in rice, partnering with a previously identified 'master' regulator IRO2. Mechanistically it is required for the nuclear localization of IRO2.
