NA	Rice leaf angle and grain size are affected by the OsBUL1 transcriptional activator complex	2016	Plant Physiology	Biotechnology Center in Southern Taiwan, Academia Sinica CITY: Tainan	Rice atypical HLH protein Oryza sativa BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED 1-LIKE 1 (OsBUL1) is preferentially expressed in the laminar joint where it controls cell elongation and positively affects leaf angles. OsBUL1 knockout mutant (osbul1) and transgenic rice for double stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) of OsBUL1 produced erected leaves with smaller grains whereas OsBUL1 overexpressors and an activation tagging line of OsBUL1 exhibited increased laminar inclination and grain size. Moreover, OsBUL1 expression was induced by brassinolide (BL) and osbul1 did not respond to BL treatment. To understand the molecular network of OsBUL1 function in rice, we isolated a novel OsBUL1-interacting protein, LO9-177, an uncharacterized protein containing a KxDL motif and functionally studied it with respect to the laminar inclination and grain size of rice. OsBUL1 COMPLEX1 (OsBC1) is a basic HLH (bHLH) transcriptional activator that interacts with OsBUL1 only in the presence of LO9-177 forming a possible trimeric complex for cell elongation in the laminar joint of rice. Expression of OsBC1 is also upregulated by BL and has a similar pattern to that of OsBUL1. Transgenic rice plants expressing OsBC1 under the control of OsBUL1 promoter showed increased grain size as well as leaf bending while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of OsBC1 displayed reduced plant height and grain size. Together, these results demonstrated that a novel protein complex consisting of OsBUL1, LO9-177 and OsBC1 is associated with the HLH-bHLH system providing new insight into the molecular functional network based on HLH-bHLH proteins for cell elongation.
NA	Gene Expression Dynamics in Rice Peduncles at the Heading Stage	2020	Front Genet	Grass Genetics and Informatics Group, School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.	Improving grain yield in the staple food crop rice has been long sought goal of plant biotechnology. One of the traits with significant impact on rice breeding programs is peduncle elongation at the time of heading failing which leads to significant reduction in grain yield due to incomplete panicle exsertion. To decipher transcriptional dynamics and molecular players underlying peduncle elongation, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of elongating and non-elongating peduncles in two Indian cultivars, Swarna and Pokkali, at the time of heading. Along with genes associated with cell division and cell wall biosynthesis, we observed significant enrichment of genes associated with auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis/signaling in the elongating peduncles before heading in both the genotypes. Similarly, genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and mobilization, abiotic stress response along with cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene biosynthesis/signaling were enriched in non-elongating peduncles post heading. Significant enrichment of genes belonging to key transcription factor families highlights their specialized roles in peduncle elongation and grain filling before and after heading, respectively. A comparison with anther/pollen development-related genes provided 76 candidates with overlapping roles in anther/pollen development and peduncle elongation. Some of these are important for carbohydrate remobilization to the developing grains. These can be engineered to combat with incomplete panicle exsertion in male sterile lines and manipulate carbohydrate dynamics in grasses. Overall, this study provides baseline information about potential target genes for engineering peduncle elongation with implications on plant height, biomass composition and grain yields in rice.
