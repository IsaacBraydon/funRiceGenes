OsBC1	 Expression of OsBC1 is also upregulated by BL and has a similar pattern to that of OsBUL1	 Transgenic rice plants expressing OsBC1 under the control of OsBUL1 promoter showed increased grain size as well as leaf bending while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of OsBC1 displayed reduced plant height and grain size
