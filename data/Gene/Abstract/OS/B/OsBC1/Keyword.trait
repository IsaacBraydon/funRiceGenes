OsBC1	leaf	Rice leaf angle and grain size are affected by the OsBUL1 transcriptional activator complex	 Transgenic rice plants expressing OsBC1 under the control of OsBUL1 promoter showed increased grain size as well as leaf bending while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of OsBC1 displayed reduced plant height and grain size
OsBC1	grain	Rice leaf angle and grain size are affected by the OsBUL1 transcriptional activator complex	 Transgenic rice plants expressing OsBC1 under the control of OsBUL1 promoter showed increased grain size as well as leaf bending while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of OsBC1 displayed reduced plant height and grain size
OsBC1	grain size	Rice leaf angle and grain size are affected by the OsBUL1 transcriptional activator complex	 Transgenic rice plants expressing OsBC1 under the control of OsBUL1 promoter showed increased grain size as well as leaf bending while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of OsBC1 displayed reduced plant height and grain size
OsBC1	cell elongation	Rice leaf angle and grain size are affected by the OsBUL1 transcriptional activator complex	 Together, these results demonstrated that a novel protein complex consisting of OsBUL1, LO9-177 and OsBC1 is associated with the HLH-bHLH system providing new insight into the molecular functional network based on HLH-bHLH proteins for cell elongation
OsBC1	height	Rice leaf angle and grain size are affected by the OsBUL1 transcriptional activator complex	 Transgenic rice plants expressing OsBC1 under the control of OsBUL1 promoter showed increased grain size as well as leaf bending while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of OsBC1 displayed reduced plant height and grain size
OsBC1	plant height	Rice leaf angle and grain size are affected by the OsBUL1 transcriptional activator complex	 Transgenic rice plants expressing OsBC1 under the control of OsBUL1 promoter showed increased grain size as well as leaf bending while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of OsBC1 displayed reduced plant height and grain size
