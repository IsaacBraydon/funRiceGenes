LO9-177	OsBC1	Rice Leaf Angle and Grain Size Are Affected by the OsBUL1 Transcriptional Activator Complex.	 OsBUL1 COMPLEX1 (OsBC1) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional activator that interacts with OsBUL1 only in the presence of LO9-177 forming a possible trimeric complex for cell elongation in the lamina joint of rice
LO9-177	OsBC1	Rice Leaf Angle and Grain Size Are Affected by the OsBUL1 Transcriptional Activator Complex.	 Together, these results demonstrated that a novel protein complex consisting of OsBUL1, LO9-177, and OsBC1 is associated with the HLH-bHLH system, providing new insight into the molecular functional network based on HLH-bHLH proteins for cell elongation
