OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059	root	Identification of two transcription factors activating the expression of OsXIP in rice defence response.	 Moreover, transcriptional analysis revealed that mechanical wounding and treatment with MeJA resulted in an obvious increase in transcript levels of OsbHLH59 and OsERF71 in root and shoot tissues
