OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059	OsERF71	Identification of two transcription factors activating the expression of OsXIP in rice defence response.	 Using yeast one-hybrid screening, coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, a basic helix-loop-helix protein (OsbHLH59) and an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) transcription factor OsERF71 directly binding to the 562<U+00A0>bp key sequence to activate the expression of OsXIP were identified, which is further supported by transient expression assay
OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059	OsERF71	Identification of two transcription factors activating the expression of OsXIP in rice defence response.	 Moreover, transcriptional analysis revealed that mechanical wounding and treatment with MeJA resulted in an obvious increase in transcript levels of OsbHLH59 and OsERF71 in root and shoot tissues

OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059	OsHRZ1	OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 transcription factors positively regulate iron deficiency responses in rice.	 Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that OsbHLH058 interacts with OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 more strongly than OsbHLH060, whereas OsbHLH059 showed no interaction
