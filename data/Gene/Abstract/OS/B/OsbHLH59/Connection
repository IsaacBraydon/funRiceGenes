OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059|OsPRI3	OsERF71	Identification of two transcription factors activating the expression of OsXIP in rice defence response.	 Using yeast one-hybrid screening, coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, a basic helix-loop-helix protein (OsbHLH59) and an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) transcription factor OsERF71 directly binding to the 562<U+00A0>bp key sequence to activate the expression of OsXIP were identified, which is further supported by transient expression assay
OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059|OsPRI3	OsERF71	Identification of two transcription factors activating the expression of OsXIP in rice defence response.	 Moreover, transcriptional analysis revealed that mechanical wounding and treatment with MeJA resulted in an obvious increase in transcript levels of OsbHLH59 and OsERF71 in root and shoot tissues
OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059|OsPRI3	OsXIP	Identification of two transcription factors activating the expression of OsXIP in rice defence response.

OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059|OsPRI3	OsHRZ1	OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 transcription factors positively regulate iron deficiency responses in rice.	 Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that OsbHLH058 interacts with OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 more strongly than OsbHLH060, whereas OsbHLH059 showed no interaction
OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059|OsPRI3	OsHRZ2	OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 transcription factors positively regulate iron deficiency responses in rice.	 Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that OsbHLH058 interacts with OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 more strongly than OsbHLH060, whereas OsbHLH059 showed no interaction
OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059|OsPRI3	OsHRZ1	Oryza sativa POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON DEFICIENCY RESPONSE 2 (OsPRI2) and OsPRI3 are involved in the maintenance of Fe homeostasis.	 In this study, we identified and functionally characterized OsPRI2 and OsPRI3, two paralogs of OsPRI1, observing that they directly interact with OsHRZ1
OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059|OsPRI3	OsHRZ1	Oryza sativa POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON DEFICIENCY RESPONSE 2 (OsPRI2) and OsPRI3 are involved in the maintenance of Fe homeostasis.	 Additional analyses suggested that OsHRZ1 promotes the degradation of OsPRI2 and OsPRI3
OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059|OsPRI3	OsIRO2|OsbHLH056	Oryza sativa POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON DEFICIENCY RESPONSE 2 (OsPRI2) and OsPRI3 are involved in the maintenance of Fe homeostasis.	 We also provide evidence that OsPRI2 and OsPRI3 bind to the promoters of OsIRO2 and OsIRO3, two key regulators of Fe homeostasis
OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059|OsPRI3	OsIRO3|OsOsbHLH063	Oryza sativa POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON DEFICIENCY RESPONSE 2 (OsPRI2) and OsPRI3 are involved in the maintenance of Fe homeostasis.	 We also provide evidence that OsPRI2 and OsPRI3 bind to the promoters of OsIRO2 and OsIRO3, two key regulators of Fe homeostasis
OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059|OsPRI3	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	Oryza sativa POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON DEFICIENCY RESPONSE 2 (OsPRI2) and OsPRI3 are involved in the maintenance of Fe homeostasis.	 In this study, we identified and functionally characterized OsPRI2 and OsPRI3, two paralogs of OsPRI1, observing that they directly interact with OsHRZ1
OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059|OsPRI3	OsYSL2	Oryza sativa POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON DEFICIENCY RESPONSE 2 (OsPRI2) and OsPRI3 are involved in the maintenance of Fe homeostasis.	 Moreover, OsPRI2 and OsPRI3 directly induce expression of the metal-nicotianamine transporter, OsYSL2, by associating with the promoter in response to Fe deficiency
