NA	Identification of two transcription factors activating the expression of OsXIP in rice defence response.	2017	BMC Biotechnol	College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Xylanase inhibitors have been confirmed to be involved in plant defence. OsXIP is a XIP-type rice xylanase inhibitor, yet its transcriptional regulation remains unknown.Herbivore infestation, wounding and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment enhanced mRNA levels and protein levels of OsXIP. By analyzing different 5' deletion mutants of OsXIP promoter exposed to rice brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens stress, a 562<U+00A0>bp region (-1451 - -889) was finally identified as the key sequence for the herbivores stress response. Using yeast one-hybrid screening, coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, a basic helix-loop-helix protein (OsbHLH59) and an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) transcription factor OsERF71 directly binding to the 562<U+00A0>bp key sequence to activate the expression of OsXIP were identified, which is further supported by transient expression assay. Moreover, transcriptional analysis revealed that mechanical wounding and treatment with MeJA resulted in an obvious increase in transcript levels of OsbHLH59 and OsERF71 in root and shoot tissues.Our data shows that two proteins as direct transcriptional activators of OsXIP responding to stress were identified. These results reveal a coordinated regulatory mechanism of OsXIP, which may probably be involved in defence responses via a JA-mediated signaling pathway.
NA	OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 transcription factors positively regulate iron deficiency responses in rice.	2019	Plant Mol Biol	Research Institute for Bioresources and Biotechnology, Ishikawa Prefectural University, 1-308 Suematsu, Nonoichi, Ishikawa, 921-8836, Japan. abkoba@ishikawa-pu.ac.jp.	Subgroup IVc basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 positively regulate major iron deficiency responses in rice in a similar but distinct manner, putatively under partial control by OsHRZs. Under low iron availability, plants transcriptionally induce the expression of genes involved in iron uptake and translocation. OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 ubiquitin ligases negatively regulate this iron deficiency response in rice. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor OsbHLH060 interacts with OsHRZ1, and positively regulates iron deficiency-inducible genes. However, the functions of three other subgroup IVc bHLH transcription factors in rice, OsbHLH057, OsbHLH058, and OsbHLH059, have not yet been characterized. In the present study, we investigated the functions of OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 related to iron deficiency response. OsbHLH058 expression was repressed under iron deficiency, whereas the expression of OsbHLH057 and OsbHLH060 was moderately induced. Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that OsbHLH058 interacts with OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 more strongly than OsbHLH060, whereas OsbHLH059 showed no interaction. An in vitro ubiquitination assay detected no OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH060 ubiquitination by OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsbHLH058 showed tolerance for iron deficiency and higher iron concentration in seeds. These lines also showed enhanced expression of many iron deficiency-inducible genes involved in iron uptake and translocation under iron-sufficient conditions. Conversely, OsbHLH058 knockdown lines showed susceptibility to iron deficiency and reduced expression of many iron deficiency-inducible genes. OsbHLH059 knockdown lines were also susceptible to iron deficiency, and formed characteristic brownish regions in iron-deficient new leaves. OsbHLH059 knockdown lines also showed reduced expression of many iron deficiency-inducible genes. These results indicate that OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 positively regulate major iron deficiency responses in a similar but distinct manner, and that this function may be partially controlled by OsHRZs.
