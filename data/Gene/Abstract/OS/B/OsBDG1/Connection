OsBDG1	PGL2|OsBUL1|OsbHLH173	Oryza sativa BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 LIKE1 Induces the Expression of a Gene Encoding a Small Leucine-Rich-Repeat Protein to Positively Regulate Lamina Inclination and Grain Size in Rice.	 Here, we identified a putative downstream gene of OsBUL1, OsBUL1 DOWNSTREAM GENE1 (OsBDG1) encoding a small protein with short leucine-rich-repeats by cDNA microarray analyses in the lamina joint and panicles of wild-type and osbul1 plants

Moreover, transgenic rice expressing OsBDG1 under the control of OsBUL1 promoter also shows enlarged leaf bending and grain size phenotypes
