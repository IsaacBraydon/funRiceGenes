OsBDG1	 Transgenic rice plants with increased OsBDG1 expression exhibit increased leaf angle and grain size, which is similar to an OsBDG1 activation tagging line whereas double stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) lines for OsBDG1 knock-down generate erect leaves with smaller grains |  Two genes, OsAP2 (OsAPETALA2) and OsWRKY24 were identified as being upregulated transcriptional activators in the lamina joint of pOsBUL1:OsBDG1 plants and induced expression of the two genes driven by OsBUL1 promoter caused increased lamina inclination and grain size in rice	 Transgenic rice plants with increased OsBDG1 expression exhibit increased leaf angle and grain size, which is similar to an OsBDG1 activation tagging line whereas double stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) lines for OsBDG1 knock-down generate erect leaves with smaller grains
