10.1007-s11741-009-0216-3.pdf	Genome-wide analysis of basic leucine zipper transcription factor families in Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Populus trichocarpa	2009	Journal of Shanghai University (English Edition)	School of Life Sciences, Shanghai University, Shanghai, 200444, P. R. China	The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors form a large gene family that is important in pathogen defense, light and stress signaling, etc. The Completed whole genome sequences of model plants Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa) constitute a valuable resource for genome-wide analysis and genomic comparative analysis, as they are representatives of the two major evolutionary lineages within the angiosperms: the monocotyledons and the dicotyledons. In this study, bioinformatics analysis identified 74, 89 and 88 bZIP genes respectively in Arabidopsis, rice and poplar. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of this gene family is presented, including the gene structure, phylogeny, chromosome distribution, conserved motifs. As a result, the plant bZIPs were organized into 10 subfamilies on basis of phylogenetic relationship. Gene duplication events during the family evolution history were also investigated. And it was further concluded that chromosomal/segmental duplication might have played a key role in gene expansion of bZIP gene family.
Hayashi-2012-Signal transduction.pdf	Signal transduction by IRE1-mediated splicing of bZIP50 and other stress sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response of rice	2012	Plant J	Genetically Modified Organism Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor IRE1 transduces signals by inducing the unconventional splicing of mRNAs encoding key transcription factors: HAC1 in yeast and XBP1 in animals. However, no HAC1 or XBP1 homologues have been found in plants, and until recently the substrate for plant IRE1 has remained unknown. This study demonstrates that the Oryza sativa (rice) OsbZIP50 transcription factor, an orthologue of Arabidopsis AtbZIP60, is regulated by IRE1-mediated splicing of its RNA. Despite the presence of a transcriptional activation domain, OsbZIP50 protein is not translocated into the nucleus efficiently in the absence of OsbZIP50 mRNA splicing. Unconventional splicing of OsbZIP50 mRNA causes a frame shift, which results in the appearance of a nuclear localization signal in the newly translated OsbZIP50. OsbZIP50 mRNA is spliced in a similar manner to HAC1 and XBP1 mRNAs; however, this splicing has very different effects on the translation products, a finding that shows the diversity of IRE1-related transcription factors in eukaryotes. In addition, the expression of OsbZIP50 is affected by ER stress sensor proteins OsIRE1, OsbZIP39 and OsbZIP60. ER stress-related genes differ with respect to their dependency on OsbZIP50 for their expression. The findings of this study improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the plant ER stress response.
Hu-2011-The Bphi008a gene in.pdf	The Bphi008a gene interacts with the ethylene pathway and transcriptionally regulates MAPK genes in the response of rice to brown planthopper feeding	2011	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, People's Republic of China.	We examined ways in which the Brown planthopper induced008a (Bphi008a; AY256682) gene of rice (Oryza sativa) enhances the plant's resistance to a specialist herbivore, the brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens). Measurement of the expression levels of ethylene synthases and of ethylene emissions showed that BPH feeding rapidly initiated the ethylene signaling pathway and up-regulated Bphi008a transcript levels after 6 to 96 h of feeding. In contrast, blocking ethylene transduction (using 1-methylcyclopropene) reduced Bphi008a transcript levels in wild-type plants fed upon by BPH. In vitro kinase assays showed that Bphi008a can be phosphorylated by rice Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase5 (OsMPK5), and yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal proline-rich region of Bphi008a interacts directly with this kinase. Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that this interaction occurs in the nucleus. Subsequently, we found that Bphi008a up-regulation and down-regulation were accompanied by different changes in transcription levels of OsMPK5, OsMPK12, OsMPK13, and OsMPK17 in transgenic plants. Immunoblot analysis also showed that the OsMPK5 protein level increased in overexpressing plants and decreased in RNA interference plants after BPH feeding. In transgenic lines, changes in the expression levels of several enzymes that are important components of the defenses against the BPH were also observed. Finally, yeast two-hybrid screening results showed that Bphi008a is able to interact with a b-ZIP transcription factor (OsbZIP60) and a RNA polymerase polypeptide (SDRP).
j.1467-7652.2010.00502.x.pdf	Analysis of ER stress in developing rice endosperm accumulating beta-amyloid peptide	2010	Plant Biotechnol J	Transgenic Crop Research and Development Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	The common neurodegenerative disorder known as Alzheimer's disease is characterized by cerebral neuritic plaques of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide. Plaque formation is related to the highly aggregative property of this peptide, because it polymerizes to form insoluble plaques or fibrils causing neurotoxicity. Here, we expressed Abeta peptide as a new causing agent to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to study ER stress occurred in plant. When the dimer of Abeta(1-42) peptide was expressed in maturing seed under the control of the 2.3-kb glutelin GluB-1 promoter containing its signal peptide, a maximum of about 8 mug peptide per grain accumulated and was deposited at the periphery of distorted ER-derived PB-I protein bodies. Synthesis of Abeta peptide in the ER lumen severely inhibited the synthesis and deposition of seed storage proteins, resulting in the generation of many small and abnormally appearing PB bodies. This ultrastructural change was accounted for by ER stress leading to the accumulation of aggregated Abeta peptide in the ER lumen and a coordinated increase in ER-resident molecular chaperones such as BiPs and PDIs in Abeta-expressing plants. Microarray analysis also confirmed that expression of several BiPs, PDIs and OsbZIP60 containing putative transmembrane domains was affected by the ER stress response. Abeta-expressing transgenic rice kernels exhibited an opaque and shrunken phenotype. When grain phenotype and expression levels were compared among transgenic rice grains expressing several different recombinant peptides, such detrimental effects on grain phenotype were correlated with the expressed peptide causing ER stress rather than expression levels.
Nijhawan-2008-Genomic survey and g.pdf	Genomic survey and gene expression analysis of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family in rice	2008	Plant Physiol	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.	The basic leucine (Leu) zipper (bZIP) proteins compose a family of transcriptional regulators present exclusively in eukaryotes. The bZIP proteins characteristically harbor a bZIP domain composed of two structural features: a DNA-binding basic region and the Leu zipper dimerization region. They have been shown to regulate diverse plant-specific phenomena, including seed maturation and germination, floral induction and development, and photomorphogenesis, and are also involved in stress and hormone signaling. We have identified 89 bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Their chromosomal distribution and sequence analyses suggest that the bZIP transcription factor family has evolved via gene duplication. The phylogenetic relationship among rice bZIP domains as well as with bZIP domains from other plant bZIP factors suggests that homologous bZIP domains exist in plants. Similar intron/exon structural patterns were observed in the basic and hinge regions of their bZIP domains. Detailed sequence analysis has been done to identify additional conserved motifs outside the bZIP domain and to predict their DNA-binding site specificity as well as dimerization properties, which has helped classify them into different groups and subfamilies, respectively. Expression of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes has been analyzed by full-length cDNA and expressed sequence tag-based expression profiling. This expression profiling was complemented by microarray analysis. The results indicate specific or coexpression patterns of rice bZIP transcription factors starting from floral transition to various stages of panicle and seed development. bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice also displayed differential expression patterns in rice seedlings in response to abiotic stress and light irradiation. An effort has been made to link the structure and expression pattern of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice to their function, based on the information obtained from our analyses and earlier known results. This information will be important for functional characterization of bZIP transcription factors in rice.
