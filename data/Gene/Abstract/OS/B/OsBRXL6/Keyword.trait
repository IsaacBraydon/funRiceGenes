OsBRXL6	salt	Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice	Except one member (OsBRXL6) that was not expressed in all the tissues and organs investigated, the other five genes were differentially responsive to major stresses including drought, salt, and cold, suggesting that the BRX-like family may also function in abiotic stress responses
OsBRXL6	drought	Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice	Except one member (OsBRXL6) that was not expressed in all the tissues and organs investigated, the other five genes were differentially responsive to major stresses including drought, salt, and cold, suggesting that the BRX-like family may also function in abiotic stress responses
