OsBSK1-2	resistance	OsBSK1-2, an Orthologous of AtBSK1, Is Involved in Rice Immunity.	 Silencing OsBSK1-2 in rice results in compromised responses to chitin- or flg22-triggered immunity and resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae, but does not alter the plant's architecture nor reduce plant responses to brassinosteroid signaling
OsBSK1-2	magnaporthe oryzae	OsBSK1-2, an Orthologous of AtBSK1, Is Involved in Rice Immunity.	 Silencing OsBSK1-2 in rice results in compromised responses to chitin- or flg22-triggered immunity and resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae, but does not alter the plant's architecture nor reduce plant responses to brassinosteroid signaling
OsBSK1-2	architecture	OsBSK1-2, an Orthologous of AtBSK1, Is Involved in Rice Immunity.	 Silencing OsBSK1-2 in rice results in compromised responses to chitin- or flg22-triggered immunity and resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae, but does not alter the plant's architecture nor reduce plant responses to brassinosteroid signaling
OsBSK1-2	brassinosteroid	OsBSK1-2, an Orthologous of AtBSK1, Is Involved in Rice Immunity.	 Silencing OsBSK1-2 in rice results in compromised responses to chitin- or flg22-triggered immunity and resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae, but does not alter the plant's architecture nor reduce plant responses to brassinosteroid signaling
OsBSK1-2	Brassinosteroid	OsBSK1-2, an Orthologous of AtBSK1, Is Involved in Rice Immunity.	 Silencing OsBSK1-2 in rice results in compromised responses to chitin- or flg22-triggered immunity and resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae, but does not alter the plant's architecture nor reduce plant responses to brassinosteroid signaling
OsBSK1-2	immunity	OsBSK1-2, an Orthologous of AtBSK1, Is Involved in Rice Immunity.	 Silencing OsBSK1-2 in rice results in compromised responses to chitin- or flg22-triggered immunity and resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae, but does not alter the plant's architecture nor reduce plant responses to brassinosteroid signaling
OsBSK1-2	immunity	OsBSK1-2, an Orthologous of AtBSK1, Is Involved in Rice Immunity.	 Our study reveals that OsBSK1-2 functions as a major regulator in rice plant immunity
OsBSK1-2	Brassinosteroid Signaling	OsBSK1-2, an Orthologous of AtBSK1, Is Involved in Rice Immunity.	 Silencing OsBSK1-2 in rice results in compromised responses to chitin- or flg22-triggered immunity and resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae, but does not alter the plant's architecture nor reduce plant responses to brassinosteroid signaling
