NA	A guanine insert in OsBBS1 leads to early leaf senescence and salt stress sensitivity in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2018	Plant Cell Rep	Department of Agronomy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	A rice receptor-like kinase gene OSBBS1/OsRLCK109 was identified; this gene played vital roles in leaf senescence and the salt stress response. Early leaf senescence can cause negative effects on rice yield, but the underlying molecular regulation is not fully understood. bilateral blade senescence 1 (bbs1), an early leaf senescence mutant with a premature senescence phenotype that occurs mainly performing at the leaf margins, was isolated from a rice mutant population generated by ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS) treatment. The mutant showed premature leaf senescence beginning at the tillering stage and exhibited severe symptoms at the late grain-filling stage. bbs1 showed accelerated dark-induced leaf senescence. The OsBBS1 gene was cloned by a map-based cloning strategy, and a guanine (G) insertion was found in the first exon of LOC_Os03g24930. This gene encodes a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase and was named OsRLCK109 in a previous study. Transgenic LOC_Os03g24930 knockout plants generated by a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy exhibited similar early leaf senescence phenotypes as did the bbs1 mutant, which confirmed that LOC_Os03g24930 was the OsBBS1 gene. OsBBS1/OsRLCK109 was expressed in all detected tissues and was predominantly expressed in the main vein region of mature leaves. The expression of OsBBS1 could be greatly induced by salt stress, and the bbs1 mutant exhibited hypersensitivity to salt stress. In conclusion, this is the first identification of OsRLCKs participating in leaf senescence and playing critical roles in the salt stress response in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
NA	LMM24 Encodes Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase 109, Which Regulates Cell Death and Defense Responses in Rice.	2019	Int J Mol Sci	Key Laboratory for Zhejiang Super Rice Research and State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China.	Lesion mimic mutants are excellent models for research on molecular mechanisms of cell death and defense responses in rice. We identified a new rice lesion mimic mutant lmm24 from a mutant pool of indica rice cultivar &quot;ZhongHui8015&quot;. The LMM24 gene was identified by MutMap, and LMM24 was confirmed as a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase 109 by amino acid sequence analysis. The lmm24 mutant displayed dark brown lesions in leaves and growth retardation that were not observed in wild-type ZH8015. The results of histochemical staining and TUNEL assays showed enhanced ROS accumulation and cell death in lmm24. Chloroplast degradation was observed in lmm24 leaves, with decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes and increased expression of the senescence-induced STAYGREEN (SGR) gene and other senescence-associated genes. Furthermore, lmm24 exhibited enhanced resistance to rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) and up-regulation of defense response genes. Our data demonstrate that LMM24 regulates cell death and defense responses in rice.
