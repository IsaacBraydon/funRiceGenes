Plant genes respond differentially to insects of different feeding modes. In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of OsBi1, a rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene significantly induced by feeding of the sucking herbivore brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål.). The OsBi1 gene contains an open reading frame that encodes a polypeptide of 283 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 36.2 kDa. Homology search in GenBank databases showed that the deduced OSBI1 protein was homologous to the inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) protein in the CBS domain. Genomic Southern analysis indicated that the OsBi1 gene was present as a single copy sequence in the rice genome. Restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping assigned the OsBi1 gene to the long arm of chromosome 2. Increase in the level of OsBi1 expression was detected in rice plants shortly after brown planthopper feeding. OsBi1 gene expression was up-regulated in response to ethephone and water deficit. In situ hybridization indicated that transcripts of the gene accumulated specifically around the vascular bundle of stem. Evidences suggest that OsBi1 is a BPH-inducible gene that is implicated in the resistance of rice plants to brown planthopper.
