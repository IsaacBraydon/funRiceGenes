Jasmonates play important roles in development, stress responses and defense in plants. Here, we report the results of a study using a functional genomics approach that identified a rice basic helix-loop-helix domain gene, OsbHLH148, that conferred drought tolerance as a component of the jasmonate signaling module in rice. OsbHLH148 transcript levels were rapidly increased by treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or abscisic acid, and abiotic stresses including dehydration, high salinity, low temperature and wounding. Transgenic over-expression of OsbHLH148 in rice confers plant tolerance to drought stress. Expression profiling followed by DNA microarray and RNA gel-blot analyses of transgenic versus wild-type rice identified genes that are up-regulated by OsbHLH148 over-expression. These include OsDREB and OsJAZ genes that are involved in stress responses and the jasmonate signaling pathway, respectively. OsJAZ1, a rice ZIM domain protein, interacted with OsbHLH148 in yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays, but it interacted with the putative OsCOI1 only in the presence of coronatine. Furthermore, the OsJAZ1 protein was degraded by rice and Arabidopsis extracts in the presence of coronatine, and its degradation was inhibited by MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, suggesting 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of OsJAZ1 via the SCF(OsCOI1) complex. The transcription level of OsJAZ1 increased upon exposure of rice to MeJA. These results show that OsJAZ1 could act as a transcriptional regulator of the OsbHLH148-related jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance. Thus, our study suggests that OsbHLH148 acts on an initial response of jasmonate-regulated gene expression toward drought tolerance, constituting the OsbHLH148-OsJAZ-OsCOI1 signaling module in rice.
NA	OsWRKY76 positively regulates drought stress via OsbHLH148-mediated jasmonate signaling in rice.	2023	Front Plant Sci	Jilin Province Engineering Laboratory of Plant Genetic Improvement, College of Plant Science, Jilin University, Changchun, China.	Drought stress is a major environmental threat that limits plant growth and crop productivity. Therefore, it is necessary to uncover the molecular mechanisms behind drought tolerance in crops. Here, OsWRKY76 positively regulated drought stress in rice. OsWRKY76 expression was induced by PEG treatment, dehydration stress, and exogenous MeJA rather than by no treatment. Notably, OsWRKY76 knockout weakened drought tolerance at the seedling stage and decreased MeJA sensitivity. OsJAZ12 was significantly induced by drought stress, and its expression was significantly higher in OsWRKY76-knockout mutants than in wild-type ZH11 under drought stress. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsWRKY76 interacted with OsJAZ12. OsWRKY76 weakened the interaction between OsbHLH148 and OsJAZ12 in yeast cells. The OsJAZ12 protein repressed the transactivation activity of OsbHLH148, and this repression was partly restored by OsWRKY76 in rice protoplasts. Moreover, OsDREB1E expression was lower in OsWRKY76-knockout mutants than in wild-type ZH11 under drought stress, but it was upregulated under normal growth conditions. Yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift, and dual-luciferase assays showed that OsWRKY76 and OsbHLH148 bound directly to the OsDREB1E promoter and activated OsDREB1E expression in response to drought stress. These results suggest that OsWRKY76 confers drought tolerance through OsbHLH148-mediated jasmonate signaling in rice, offering a new clue to uncover the mechanisms behind drought tolerance.
