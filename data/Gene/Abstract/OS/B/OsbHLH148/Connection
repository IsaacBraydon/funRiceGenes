OsbHLH148	OsJAZ1|OsTIFY3|EG2	OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice	OsJAZ1, a rice ZIM domain protein, interacted with OsbHLH148 in yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays, but it interacted with the putative OsCOI1 only in the presence of coronatine
OsbHLH148	OsJAZ1|OsTIFY3|EG2	OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice	These results show that OsJAZ1 could act as a transcriptional regulator of the OsbHLH148-related jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance
OsbHLH148	OsCOI1|OsCOI1a	OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice	OsJAZ1, a rice ZIM domain protein, interacted with OsbHLH148 in yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays, but it interacted with the putative OsCOI1 only in the presence of coronatine
OsbHLH148	OsCOI1|OsCOI1a	OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice	Thus, our study suggests that OsbHLH148 acts on an initial response of jasmonate-regulated gene expression toward drought tolerance, constituting the OsbHLH148-OsJAZ-OsCOI1 signaling module in rice
OsbHLH148	OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	Jasmonate Zim-Domain Protein 9 Interacts With Slender Rice 1 to Mediate the Antagonistic Interaction Between Jasmonic and Gibberellic Acid Signals in Rice.	 Based on this broader interaction, we explored the function of OsJAZ9 in JA and GA responses by analyzing transcript levels of the JA-responsive gene OsbHLH148 and the GA-responsive gene OsPIL14 in OsJAZ9-overexpressing (OsJAZ9-Ox) and osjaz9 mutant plants
OsbHLH148	OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	Jasmonate Zim-Domain Protein 9 Interacts With Slender Rice 1 to Mediate the Antagonistic Interaction Between Jasmonic and Gibberellic Acid Signals in Rice.	 By contrast, in osjaz9 mutants, the expression of OsbHLH148 was upregulated and the expression of OsPIL14 was downregulated
OsbHLH148	OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	Jasmonate Zim-Domain Protein 9 Interacts With Slender Rice 1 to Mediate the Antagonistic Interaction Between Jasmonic and Gibberellic Acid Signals in Rice.	 These observations indicated that OsJAZ9 regulates both JA and GA responses in rice, and this finding was supported by the opposite expression patterns of OsDREB1s, downstream targets of OsbHLH148 and OsPIL14, in the OsJAZ9-Ox and osjaz9 plants
OsbHLH148	OsWRKY76	OsWRKY76 positively regulates drought stress via OsbHLH148-mediated jasmonate signaling in rice.	 OsWRKY76 weakened the interaction between OsbHLH148 and OsJAZ12 in yeast cells
OsbHLH148	OsWRKY76	OsWRKY76 positively regulates drought stress via OsbHLH148-mediated jasmonate signaling in rice.	 The OsJAZ12 protein repressed the transactivation activity of OsbHLH148, and this repression was partly restored by OsWRKY76 in rice protoplasts
OsbHLH148	OsWRKY76	OsWRKY76 positively regulates drought stress via OsbHLH148-mediated jasmonate signaling in rice.	 Yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift, and dual-luciferase assays showed that OsWRKY76 and OsbHLH148 bound directly to the OsDREB1E promoter and activated OsDREB1E expression in response to drought stress
