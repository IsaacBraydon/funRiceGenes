OsbHLH65	OsMSRMK2|OsMAP1|OsMPK5|OsMAPK2|OsMAPK5|OsBIMK1|OsMPK3	OsMPK3 is a TEY-type rice MAPK in Group C and phosphorylates OsbHLH65, a transcription factor binding to the E-box element.	OsMPK3 is a TEY-type rice MAPK in Group C and phosphorylates OsbHLH65, a transcription factor binding to the E-box element.
OsbHLH65	OsMSRMK2|OsMAP1|OsMPK5|OsMAPK2|OsMAPK5|OsBIMK1|OsMPK3	OsMPK3 is a TEY-type rice MAPK in Group C and phosphorylates OsbHLH65, a transcription factor binding to the E-box element.	OsMPK3 is a TEY-type rice MAPK belonging to Group C and directly phosphorylates OsbHLH65 in the nucleus
OsbHLH65	OsMSRMK2|OsMAP1|OsMPK5|OsMAPK2|OsMAPK5|OsBIMK1|OsMPK3	OsMPK3 is a TEY-type rice MAPK in Group C and phosphorylates OsbHLH65, a transcription factor binding to the E-box element.	 OsMPK3 and OsbHLH65 are induced by biotic stress and defense-related hormones
OsbHLH65	OsMSRMK2|OsMAP1|OsMPK5|OsMAPK2|OsMAPK5|OsBIMK1|OsMPK3	OsMPK3 is a TEY-type rice MAPK in Group C and phosphorylates OsbHLH65, a transcription factor binding to the E-box element.	 In the study reported here, we determined that a TEY-type rice MAPK belonging to subgroup C, named OsMPK3, phosphorylates its substrate OsbHLH65 in the nucleus
OsbHLH65	OsMSRMK2|OsMAP1|OsMPK5|OsMAPK2|OsMAPK5|OsBIMK1|OsMPK3	OsMPK3 is a TEY-type rice MAPK in Group C and phosphorylates OsbHLH65, a transcription factor binding to the E-box element.	 Both OsMPK3 and OsbHLH65 were induced by treatments with rice blast (Magnaporthe grisea), brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), and defense-related hormones, such as methyl jasmonic acid and salicylic acid
