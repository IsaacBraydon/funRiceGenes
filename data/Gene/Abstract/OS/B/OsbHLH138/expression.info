OsbHLH138	 Further, we identified a nucleus-localized bHLH transcription factor OsbHLH138, which can form the basic helix-loop-helix structure and bind the core region of tms5-2 promoter sequences by bHLH domain, and activate expression of tms5-2 by the acidic amino acid-rich domain |  By altering expression of OsbHLH138, we can regulate the expression level of TMS5 and the accumulation of UbL40 mRNAs to command the male fertility in different temperatures
