pce12223.pdf	Overexpression of stress-inducible OsBURP16, the beta subunit of polygalacturonase 1, decreases pectin content and cell adhesion and increases abiotic stress sensitivity in rice	2014	Plant Cell Environ	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China; Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.	Polygalacturonase (PG), one of the hydrolases responsible for cell wall pectin degradation, is involved in organ consenescence and biotic stress in plants. PG1 is composed of a catalytic subunit, PG2, and a non-catalytic PG1beta subunit. OsBURP16 belongs to the PG1beta-like subfamily of BURP-family genes and encodes one putative PG1beta subunit precursor in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Transcription of OsBURP16 is induced by cold, salinity and drought stresses, as well as by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Analysis of plant survival rates, relative ion leakage rates, accumulation levels of H2 O2 and water loss rates of leaves showed that overexpression of OsBURP16 enhanced sensitivity to cold, salinity and drought stresses compared with controls. Young leaves of Ubi::OsBURP16 transgenic plants showed reduced cell adhesion and increased cuticular transpiration rate. Mechanical strength measurement of Ubi::OsBURP16 plants showed that reduced force was required to break leaves as compared with wild type. Transgenic rice showed enhanced PG activity and reduced pectin content. All these results suggested that overexpression of OsBURP16 caused pectin degradation and affected cell wall integrity as well as transpiration rate, which decreased tolerance to abiotic stresses.
NA	Ethylene insensitive3-like2 (OsEIL2) confers stress sensitivity by regulating OsBURP16, the ¦Â subunit of polygalacturonase (PG1¦Â-like) subfamily gene in rice.	2019	Plant Sci	Tongji University, No. 1239 Siping Road, Shanghai, 200092, China; Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Environment, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 300 Fenglin Road, Shanghai, 200032, China; University of Chinese Academy of Science, China.	The transcription factors EIN3 (ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE 3) and EILs (EIN3-Likes) play important roles in plant development and defense responses; however, their mechanism in these processes remain unclear. Here, we report that OsEIL2, an EIN3-like transcription factor from rice (Oryza sativa), plays important roles in abiotic stress and leaf senescence. OsEIL2 is a nuclear-localized protein with transactivation activity in the C-terminus (amino acids 344-583) and can be induced by NaCl, polyethylene glycol (PEG), dark, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Transgenic plants of overexpressing OsEIL2 (OsEIL2-OX) show reduced tolerance to salt and drought stress compared with the controls. While the transgenic plants of overexpressing OsEIL2-RNA interference (OsEIL2-RNAi) exhibit enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stress compared with the controls. Moreover, seedlings of OsEIL2-overexpressing transgenic plants exhibit delayed leaf development and an accelerated dark-induced senescence phenotype, whereas OsEIL2-RNAi plants display the opposite phenotype. We further found that OsEIL2 functions upstream of OsBURP14 and OsBURP16. OsBURP14 and OsBURP16 are the members of the ¦Â subunit of polygalacturonase subfamilies. OsBURP16 overexpression reduced pectin content and cell adhesion and increased abiotic stress sensitivity in rice. OsEIL2 binds directly to the promoter of OsBURP14 and OsBURP16 and activates their transcript levels. We also found that OsEIL2 overexpression decreased the pectin content by increasing polygalacturonase (PG) activity. Taken together, these results revealed a new mechanism of OsEIL2 in abiotic stress responses. These findings provide new insights into plant resistance to abiotic stress.
