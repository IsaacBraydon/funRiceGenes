OsBURP16	OsEIL2	Ethylene insensitive3-like2 (OsEIL2) confers stress sensitivity by regulating OsBURP16, the ¦Â subunit of polygalacturonase (PG1¦Â-like) subfamily gene in rice.	Ethylene insensitive3-like2 (OsEIL2) confers stress sensitivity by regulating OsBURP16, the ¦Â subunit of polygalacturonase (PG1¦Â-like) subfamily gene in rice.
OsBURP16	OsEIL2	Ethylene insensitive3-like2 (OsEIL2) confers stress sensitivity by regulating OsBURP16, the ¦Â subunit of polygalacturonase (PG1¦Â-like) subfamily gene in rice.	 We further found that OsEIL2 functions upstream of OsBURP14 and OsBURP16
OsBURP16	OsEIL2	Ethylene insensitive3-like2 (OsEIL2) confers stress sensitivity by regulating OsBURP16, the ¦Â subunit of polygalacturonase (PG1¦Â-like) subfamily gene in rice.	 OsEIL2 binds directly to the promoter of OsBURP14 and OsBURP16 and activates their transcript levels
OsBURP16	OsTMF	OsTMF attenuates cold tolerance by affecting cell wall properties in rice.	 Cold stress increased the expression of OsTMF and accumulation of OsTMF in the nucleus, where OsTMF acts as a transcription activator and modulates the expression of genes involved in pectin degradation (OsBURP16), cellulose biosynthesis (OsCesA4 and OsCesA9), and cell wall structural maintenance (genes encoding proline-rich proteins and peroxidases)
OsBURP16	OsTMF	OsTMF attenuates cold tolerance by affecting cell wall properties in rice.	 OsTMF directly activated the expression of OsBURP16, OsCesA4, and OsCesA9 through binding to the TATA cis-elements in their promoters
