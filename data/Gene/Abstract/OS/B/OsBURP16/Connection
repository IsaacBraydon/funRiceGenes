OsBURP16	OsEIL2	Ethylene insensitive3-like2 (OsEIL2) confers stress sensitivity by regulating OsBURP16, the ¦Â subunit of polygalacturonase (PG1¦Â-like) subfamily gene in rice.	Ethylene insensitive3-like2 (OsEIL2) confers stress sensitivity by regulating OsBURP16, the ¦Â subunit of polygalacturonase (PG1¦Â-like) subfamily gene in rice.
OsBURP16	OsEIL2	Ethylene insensitive3-like2 (OsEIL2) confers stress sensitivity by regulating OsBURP16, the ¦Â subunit of polygalacturonase (PG1¦Â-like) subfamily gene in rice.	 We further found that OsEIL2 functions upstream of OsBURP14 and OsBURP16
OsBURP16	OsEIL2	Ethylene insensitive3-like2 (OsEIL2) confers stress sensitivity by regulating OsBURP16, the ¦Â subunit of polygalacturonase (PG1¦Â-like) subfamily gene in rice.	 OsEIL2 binds directly to the promoter of OsBURP14 and OsBURP16 and activates their transcript levels
