NA	OsbZIP42 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling and confers drought tolerance to rice.	2019	Planta	Division of Bioscience and Bioinformatics, Myongji University, Yongin, 449-728, Korea.	OsbZIP42 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling and drought stress tolerance. The activation of OsbZIP42 depends on stress-/ABA-activated protein kinase 4 (SAPK4) and an additional ABA-dependent modification of OsbZIP42. Basic leucine zipper transcription factors (bZIP TFs) play important roles in the ABA signaling pathway in plants. Rice OsbZIP42 is a member of the group E bZIP, which is an ortholog of Arabidopsis group A bZIP. This latter group includes abscisic acid-responsive element (ABRE)-binding factors (ABFs) involved in abiotic stress tolerance. The expression of OsbZIP42 was induced by ABA treatment, although it was not induced by drought and salt stresses. Unlike other bZIP TFs, OsbZIP42 contained two transcriptional activation domains. Although the full-length OsbZIP42 protein did not, the N-terminus of the protein interacted with SAPK4. Our results suggest that the activation of OsbZIP42 by SAPK4 requires another ABA-dependent modification of OsbZIP42. Transgenic rice overexpressing OsbZIP42 (OsbZIP42-OX) exhibited a rapidly elevated expression of the ABA-responsive LEA3 and Rab16 genes and was hypersensitive to ABA. Analyses of the OsbZIP42-OX plants revealed enhanced tolerance to drought stress. These results suggest that OsbZIP42 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling and drought stress tolerance depending on its activation, which is followed by an additional ABA-dependent modification. We propose that OsbZIP42 is an important player in rice for conferring ABA-dependent drought tolerance.
NA	Antagonistic Transcription Factor Complexes Modulate the Floral Transition in Rice.	2017	Plant Cell	University of Milan CITY: Milan Italy [IT].	Plants measure day or night lengths to coordinate specific developmental changes with a favorable season. In rice (Oryza sativa), the reproductive phase is initiated by exposure to short days when expression of HEADING DATE 3a (Hd3a) and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1) is induced in leaves. The cognate proteins are components of the florigenic signal, and move systemically through the phloem to reach the shoot apical meristem (SAM). In the SAM, they form a transcriptional activation complex with the bZIP transcription factor OsFD1, to start panicle development. Here, we show that Hd3a and RFT1 can form transcriptional activation or repression complexes also in leaves, and feed-back to regulate their own transcription. Activation complexes depend upon OsFD1 to promote flowering. However, additional bZIPs, including Hd3a BINDING REPRESSOR FACTOR 1 (HBF1) and HBF2 form repressor complexes that reduce Hd3a and RFT1 expression to delay flowering. We propose that Hd3a and RFT1 are also active locally in leaves to fine-tune photoperiodic flowering responses.
NA	Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant. In addition to serving as a model plant for molecular genetic studies of monocots, rice is a staple crop for about half of the world population. Heading date is a critical agronomic trait, and many genes controlling heading date have been cloned during the last two decades. The mechanism of flowering in rice from recognition of day length by leaves to floral activation in the shoot apical meristem has been extensively studied. In this review, we summarize current progress on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice with emphasis on post-translational modifications of key regulators, including Heading Date 1 (Hd1), Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Grain Number, Plant Height, and Heading Date7 (Ghd7). The contribution of heading date genes to heterosis and the expansion of rice cultivation areas from low-latitude to high-latitude regions are also discussed. To overcome limitations of diverse genetic backgrounds used in heading date studies and to gain a clearer understanding of flowering in rice, we propose a systematic collection of genetic resources in a common genetic background. Strategies in breeding adapted cultivars by rational design are also discussed.
