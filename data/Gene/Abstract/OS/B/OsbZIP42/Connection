OsbZIP42	SAPK4|OSPDK	OsbZIP42 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling and confers drought tolerance to rice.	 The activation of OsbZIP42 depends on stress-/ABA-activated protein kinase 4 (SAPK4) and an additional ABA-dependent modification of OsbZIP42
OsbZIP42	SAPK4|OSPDK	OsbZIP42 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling and confers drought tolerance to rice.	 Although the full-length OsbZIP42 protein did not, the N-terminus of the protein interacted with SAPK4
OsbZIP42	SAPK4|OSPDK	OsbZIP42 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling and confers drought tolerance to rice.	 Our results suggest that the activation of OsbZIP42 by SAPK4 requires another ABA-dependent modification of OsbZIP42
