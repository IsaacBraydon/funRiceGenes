Symbol	Expression
OsbZIP42|HBF1	 The expression of OsbZIP42 was induced by ABA treatment, although it was not induced by drought and salt stresses |  Transgenic rice overexpressing OsbZIP42 (OsbZIP42-OX) exhibited a rapidly elevated expression of the ABA-responsive LEA3 and Rab16 genes and was hypersensitive to ABA
OsbZIP42|HBF1	 However, additional bZIPs, including Hd3a BINDING REPRESSOR FACTOR 1 (HBF1) and HBF2 form repressor complexes that reduce Hd3a and RFT1 expression to delay flowering
