Rice leaf angle is an important agronomic trait determining plant architecture and crop yield. Brassinosteroids (BRs) play crucial roles in controlling rice leaf angle, thus an increasing number of researches were focused on the BR signaling pathway in rice. However, the orthologs of some important components in Arabidopsis BR signaling have not yet been characterized in rice. In this study, we identified a rice bHLH transcription factor named OsBIM1, as the closest rice homolog of AtBIM1 (BES1-Interacting MYC-like Protein1). Overexpression of OsBIM1 significantly increases rice leaf angles, whereas the T-DNA knock-out mutant osbim1 and wide type (WT) showed similar leaf inclination. OsBIM1 overexpression enhances the sensitivity and response to BR treatment in rice. Gene expression analysis showed that the overexpression of OsBIM1 significantly increased the transcripts of INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION1 (OsILI1) that functions as a key transcription factor promoting BR signaling and response. Meanwhile, OsBIM1 inhibited the expression of DWARF2 (OsD2, a key enzyme in BR biosynthesis pathway). OsBIM1 can bind with OsILI1 promoter and enhance OsILI1 expression in response to BR treatment. The promoting effect of OsBIM1 overexpression on leaf angle can still be observed at harvest stage, but overexpression of OsBIM1 resulted in smaller grain size and reduced yield. These results indicate that OsBIM1 functions as a positive regulator in BR signaling, and its overexpression increases rice lamina inclination by promoting BR sensitivity and response.
