NA	Overexpression of jasmonate-responsive OsbHLH034 in rice results in the induction of bacterial blight resistance via an increase in lignin biosynthesis	2020	Plant Cell Reports	Plant Genome and Resource Research Center, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagawa University, Miki, Kagawa, 761-0795, Japan	Jasmonic acid (JA) is a plant hormone under strict regulation by various transcription factors (TFs) that acts as a signaling compound in the regulation of plant defense responses and development. Here, we report that a basic helix¨Cloop¨Chelix (bHLH)-type TF, OsbHLH034, plays an important role in the JA-mediated resistance response against rice bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The expression of OsbHLH034 was upregulated at a late phase after JA treatment. OsbHLH034 interacted with a Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein, OsJAZ9, in both plant and yeast cells. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsbHLH034 exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and increased resistance against rice bacterial blight. Conversely, OsbHLH034-overexpressing plants exhibited high sensitivity to salt stress. The expression of some JA-responsive secretory-type peroxidase genes was upregulated in the OsbHLH034-overexpressing rice plants. Concomitantly, the lignin content significantly increased in these transgenic plants compared to that in the wild-type. These results indicate that OsbHLH034 acts as a positive regulator of the JA-mediated defense response in rice.
