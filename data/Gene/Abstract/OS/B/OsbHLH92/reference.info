NA	OsbHLH92, in the noncanonical brassinosteroid signaling pathway, positively regulates leaf angle and grain weight in rice.	2023	New Phytol	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, China.	Modifications of plant architecture can increase planting density, regulate photosynthesis, and improve crop yields. Many basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors participate in the brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway and are critical for plant architecture morphogenesis in rice. However, the number of identified bHLH genes suitable for improving production value is still limited. In this study, we cloned Lam1, encoding the typical bHLH transcription factor OsbHLH92. OsbHLH92 knockout (KO) lines exhibit erect leaves. Decreases in the number and size of parenchyma cell layers on the adaxial side of the lamina joint in KO lines were the main reason for the decreased leaf angle. Genetic experiments verify that OsBU1 and its homologs are downstream of OsbHLH92, which is involved in the noncanonical RGA1-mediated BR signaling pathway. OsbHLH91, an OsbHLH92 homolog, plays both conserved and differentiated roles relative to OsbHLH92. Notably, OsbHLH92-KO lines show erect leaves without the acquisition of adverse agronomic traits. Moreover, by driving a specific panicle promoter, OsbHLH92 can greatly increase productivity by at least 10%. This study identifies new components of the BR signaling pathway, demonstrates the importance of OsbHLH92 in improving planting density and crop productivity, and broadens our knowledge of typical and atypical bHLH family members in rice.
