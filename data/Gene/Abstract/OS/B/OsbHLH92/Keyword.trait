OsbHLH92	transcription factor	OsbHLH92, in the noncanonical brassinosteroid signaling pathway, positively regulates leaf angle and grain weight in rice.	 In this study, we cloned Lam1, encoding the typical bHLH transcription factor OsbHLH92
OsbHLH92	BR	OsbHLH92, in the noncanonical brassinosteroid signaling pathway, positively regulates leaf angle and grain weight in rice.	 This study identifies new components of the BR signaling pathway, demonstrates the importance of OsbHLH92 in improving planting density and crop productivity, and broadens our knowledge of typical and atypical bHLH family members in rice
OsbHLH92	BR signaling	OsbHLH92, in the noncanonical brassinosteroid signaling pathway, positively regulates leaf angle and grain weight in rice.	 This study identifies new components of the BR signaling pathway, demonstrates the importance of OsbHLH92 in improving planting density and crop productivity, and broadens our knowledge of typical and atypical bHLH family members in rice
OsbHLH92	panicle	OsbHLH92, in the noncanonical brassinosteroid signaling pathway, positively regulates leaf angle and grain weight in rice.	 Moreover, by driving a specific panicle promoter, OsbHLH92 can greatly increase productivity by at least 10%
OsbHLH92	 BR 	OsbHLH92, in the noncanonical brassinosteroid signaling pathway, positively regulates leaf angle and grain weight in rice.	 This study identifies new components of the BR signaling pathway, demonstrates the importance of OsbHLH92 in improving planting density and crop productivity, and broadens our knowledge of typical and atypical bHLH family members in rice
OsbHLH92	erect	OsbHLH92, in the noncanonical brassinosteroid signaling pathway, positively regulates leaf angle and grain weight in rice.	 OsbHLH92 knockout (KO) lines exhibit erect leaves
OsbHLH92	leaf angle	OsbHLH92, in the noncanonical brassinosteroid signaling pathway, positively regulates leaf angle and grain weight in rice	OsbHLH92, in the noncanonical brassinosteroid signaling pathway, positively regulates leaf angle and grain weight in rice
