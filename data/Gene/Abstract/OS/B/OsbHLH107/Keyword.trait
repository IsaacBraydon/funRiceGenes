OsbHLH107	transcription factor	Overexpression of OsbHLH107, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family, enhances grain size in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 OsbHLH107 is a nucleus-localized bHLH transcription factor, which can form a homodimer with itself
OsbHLH107	grain	Overexpression of OsbHLH107, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family, enhances grain size in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	We concluded that OsbHLH107 and its homologs are important regulators of grain size development and might be useful for grain yield improvement in rice
OsbHLH107	development	Overexpression of OsbHLH107, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family, enhances grain size in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	We concluded that OsbHLH107 and its homologs are important regulators of grain size development and might be useful for grain yield improvement in rice
OsbHLH107	grain yield	Overexpression of OsbHLH107, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family, enhances grain size in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	We concluded that OsbHLH107 and its homologs are important regulators of grain size development and might be useful for grain yield improvement in rice
OsbHLH107	yield	Overexpression of OsbHLH107, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family, enhances grain size in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	We concluded that OsbHLH107 and its homologs are important regulators of grain size development and might be useful for grain yield improvement in rice
OsbHLH107	grain size	Overexpression of OsbHLH107, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family, enhances grain size in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	We concluded that OsbHLH107 and its homologs are important regulators of grain size development and might be useful for grain yield improvement in rice
