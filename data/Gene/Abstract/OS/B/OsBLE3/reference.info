Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a group of plant hormones involved in a wide range of plant growth and developmental processes. To investigate the mechanism of BR action in monocots, a brassinolide (BL) upregulated gene designated OsBLE3 was identified, cloned and characterized in rice. It was mainly expressed in roots and leaf sheaths with levels of expression directly dependent on the dose of BL. In situ hybridization detected OsBLE3 mRNA in the shoot apical meristem, organ primordia and vascular tissue. Furthermore, its expression was enhanced by co-treatment with BL and low concentrations of IAA. These results, and the existence of auxin response elements in the 5'-flanking region of the OsBLE3 gene, indicate that OsBLE3 expression is under control of both BR and auxin. The GUS reporter gene driven by a 2277 bp OsBLE3 putative promoter was mainly expressed in vascular tissues, branch root primordia and was responsive to exogenous BL treatment. OsBLE3 transcript levels were greatly reduced in brd1 plants, a BL deficient mutant, compared to the wild type control. In OsBRI1 antisense transgenic rice and OsBLE3, the BR-insensitive mutant expression of OsBLE3 in response to exogenous BL treatment was significantly lower compared to that in control plants transformed with a vacant vector. Reduced OsBLE3 expression and growth retardation was also observed in OsBLE3 antisense transgenic rice plants. Internode cell length of the OsBLE3 antisense transgenic lines was about 70% of that in the vacant vector transformed control lines. These results suggest that OsBLE3 is involved in cell elongation in rice through dual regulation by BL and IAA.
