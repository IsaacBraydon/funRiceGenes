OsBLE3	cell elongation	OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice	 These results suggest that OsBLE3 is involved in cell elongation in rice through dual regulation by BL and IAA
OsBLE3	shoot apical meristem	OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice	 In situ hybridization detected OsBLE3 mRNA in the shoot apical meristem, organ primordia and vascular tissue
OsBLE3	growth	OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice	 Reduced OsBLE3 expression and growth retardation was also observed in OsBLE3 antisense transgenic rice plants
OsBLE3	growth	OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice	OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice
OsBLE3	iaa	OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice	 These results suggest that OsBLE3 is involved in cell elongation in rice through dual regulation by BL and IAA
OsBLE3	auxin	OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice	 These results, and the existence of auxin response elements in the 5'-flanking region of the OsBLE3 gene, indicate that OsBLE3 expression is under control of both BR and auxin
OsBLE3	 BR 	OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice	 To investigate the mechanism of BR action in monocots, a brassinolide (BL) upregulated gene designated OsBLE3 was identified, cloned and characterized in rice
OsBLE3	 BR 	OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice	 These results, and the existence of auxin response elements in the 5'-flanking region of the OsBLE3 gene, indicate that OsBLE3 expression is under control of both BR and auxin
OsBLE3	meristem	OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice	 In situ hybridization detected OsBLE3 mRNA in the shoot apical meristem, organ primordia and vascular tissue
OsBLE3	shoot	OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice	 In situ hybridization detected OsBLE3 mRNA in the shoot apical meristem, organ primordia and vascular tissue
OsBLE3	root	OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice	 The GUS reporter gene driven by a 2277 bp OsBLE3 putative promoter was mainly expressed in vascular tissues, branch root primordia and was responsive to exogenous BL treatment
