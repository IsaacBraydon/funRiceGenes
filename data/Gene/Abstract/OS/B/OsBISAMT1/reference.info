We isolated and identified a full-length cDNA, OsBISAMT1 [Oryza sativa L. benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced SAMT 1], which encodes a putative S-adenosyl-L: -methionine:salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (SAMT) from rice. OsBISAMT1 contains an ORE of 1128 bp, which predicts to encode a 375 aa protein. The OsBISAMT1 protein sequence shows a high level of identity to known plant SAMTs and contains a conserved characteristic methyltransferase domain. OsBISAMT1 is a member of a small gene family in the rice genome. Expression of OsBISAMT1 in rice leaves was induced by treatments with benzothiadiazole and salicylic acid, which are capable of inducing rice disease resistance. OsBISAMT1 was also up-regulated in both incompatible and compatible interactions between rice and the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grsiea, but the induced expression of OsBISAMT1 was greater and more rapid in the incompatible interaction than that in the compatible one. Moreover, mechanical wounding also activated OsBISAMT1 expression. The results suggest that OsBISAMT1 may be involved in disease resistance responses as well as in wound response in rice.
