OsBISAMT1	disease	OsBISAMT1, a gene encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine: salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, is differentially expressed in rice defense responses	 Expression of OsBISAMT1 in rice leaves was induced by treatments with benzothiadiazole and salicylic acid, which are capable of inducing rice disease resistance| The results suggest that OsBISAMT1 may be involved in disease resistance responses as well as in wound response in rice
OsBISAMT1	defense	"OsBISAMT1, a gene encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine: salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, is differentially expressed in rice defense responses"	"OsBISAMT1, a gene encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine: salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, is differentially expressed in rice defense responses"
OsBISAMT1	salicylic acid	OsBISAMT1, a gene encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine: salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, is differentially expressed in rice defense responses	 Expression of OsBISAMT1 in rice leaves was induced by treatments with benzothiadiazole and salicylic acid, which are capable of inducing rice disease resistance|OsBISAMT1, a gene encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine: salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, is differentially expressed in rice defense responses
OsBISAMT1	defense response	"OsBISAMT1, a gene encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine: salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, is differentially expressed in rice defense responses"	"OsBISAMT1, a gene encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine: salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, is differentially expressed in rice defense responses"
OsBISAMT1	blast	OsBISAMT1, a gene encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine: salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, is differentially expressed in rice defense responses	 OsBISAMT1 was also up-regulated in both incompatible and compatible interactions between rice and the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grsiea, but the induced expression of OsBISAMT1 was greater and more rapid in the incompatible interaction than that in the compatible one
OsBISAMT1	disease resistance	OsBISAMT1, a gene encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine: salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, is differentially expressed in rice defense responses	 Expression of OsBISAMT1 in rice leaves was induced by treatments with benzothiadiazole and salicylic acid, which are capable of inducing rice disease resistance| The results suggest that OsBISAMT1 may be involved in disease resistance responses as well as in wound response in rice
