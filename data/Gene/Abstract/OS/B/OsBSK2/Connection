D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	OsBSK2	OsBSK2, a putative brassinosteroid-signaling kinase, positively controls grain size in rice.	 OsBSK2 directly interacts with the BR receptor kinase OsBRI1, however, genetic experiments have demonstrated that OsBSK2 likely regulates grain size independently of the BR signaling pathway
OsBSK2	OsBSK3	OsBSK2, a putative brassinosteroid-signaling kinase, positively controls grain size in rice.	 OsBSK2 can form a homodimer or heterodimers with OsBSK3 and OsBSK4, and silencing OsBSK2, OsBSK3, and OsBSK4 reduced grain size
