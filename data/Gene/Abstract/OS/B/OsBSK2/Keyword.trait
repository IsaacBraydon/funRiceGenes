OsBSK2	Kinase	OsBSK2, a putative brassinosteroid-signaling kinase, positively controls grain size in rice.	 OsBSK2 directly interacts with the BR receptor kinase OsBRI1, however, genetic experiments have demonstrated that OsBSK2 likely regulates grain size independently of the BR signaling pathway
OsBSK2	grain	OsBSK2, a putative brassinosteroid-signaling kinase, positively controls grain size in rice.	 OsBSK2 directly interacts with the BR receptor kinase OsBRI1, however, genetic experiments have demonstrated that OsBSK2 likely regulates grain size independently of the BR signaling pathway
OsBSK2	grain	OsBSK2, a putative brassinosteroid-signaling kinase, positively controls grain size in rice.	 OsBSK2 can form a homodimer or heterodimers with OsBSK3 and OsBSK4, and silencing OsBSK2, OsBSK3, and OsBSK4 reduced grain size
OsBSK2	grain size	OsBSK2, a putative brassinosteroid-signaling kinase, positively controls grain size in rice.	 OsBSK2 directly interacts with the BR receptor kinase OsBRI1, however, genetic experiments have demonstrated that OsBSK2 likely regulates grain size independently of the BR signaling pathway
OsBSK2	grain size	OsBSK2, a putative brassinosteroid-signaling kinase, positively controls grain size in rice.	 OsBSK2 can form a homodimer or heterodimers with OsBSK3 and OsBSK4, and silencing OsBSK2, OsBSK3, and OsBSK4 reduced grain size
OsBSK2	brassinosteroid	OsBSK2, a putative brassinosteroid-signaling kinase, positively controls grain size in rice.	 MutMap-based gene mapping and transgenic experiments demonstrated that GLW10 encodes a putative brassinosteroid (BR)-signaling kinase, OsBSK2
OsBSK2	BR	OsBSK2, a putative brassinosteroid-signaling kinase, positively controls grain size in rice.	 OsBSK2 directly interacts with the BR receptor kinase OsBRI1, however, genetic experiments have demonstrated that OsBSK2 likely regulates grain size independently of the BR signaling pathway

OsBSK2	BR signaling	OsBSK2, a putative brassinosteroid-signaling kinase, positively controls grain size in rice.	 OsBSK2 directly interacts with the BR receptor kinase OsBRI1, however, genetic experiments have demonstrated that OsBSK2 likely regulates grain size independently of the BR signaling pathway

OsBSK2	plasma membrane	OsBSK2, a putative brassinosteroid-signaling kinase, positively controls grain size in rice.	 OsBSK2 is a plasma membrane protein, and an N-myristoylation site is needed for both its membrane localization and functions
OsBSK2	receptor kinase	OsBSK2, a putative brassinosteroid-signaling kinase, positively controls grain size in rice.	 OsBSK2 directly interacts with the BR receptor kinase OsBRI1, however, genetic experiments have demonstrated that OsBSK2 likely regulates grain size independently of the BR signaling pathway
