NA	OsBSK1-2, an Orthologous of AtBSK1, Is Involved in Rice Immunity.	2017	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Key Laboratory of Major Crop Diseases &amp; Collaborative Innovation Center for Hybrid Rice in Yangtze River Basin, Sichuan Agricultural University at Wenjiang, ChengduChina.	The brassinosteroid-SIGNALING KINASE (BSK) belongs to the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase XII subgroup. BSK1 regulates development and immunity in Arabidopsis. However, the function of rice (Oryza sativa) BSK1 is largely unknown. Here, we report that the expression level of OsBSK1-2 is induced after a chitin or fagellin22 (flg22) treatment. Silencing OsBSK1-2 in rice results in compromised responses to or flg22-triggered immunity and resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae, but does not alter the plant&#39;s architecture nor reduce plant responses to brassinosteroid signaling. Our study reveals that OsBSK1-2 functions as a major regulator in rice plant immunity.
NA	OsBSK2, a putative brassinosteroid-signaling kinase, positively controls grain size in rice.	2022	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Chengdu, 611130, Sichuan, China.	Grain size is an important trait that directly affects grain yield in rice; however, the genetic and molecular mechanisms regulating grain size remain unclear. In this study, we identified a mutant, grain length and grain weight 10 (glw10), which exhibited significantly reduced grain length and grain weight. Histological analysis demonstrated that GLW10 affects cell expansion, which regulates grain size. MutMap-based gene mapping and transgenic experiments demonstrated that GLW10 encodes a putative brassinosteroid (BR)-signaling kinase, OsBSK2. OsBSK2 is a plasma membrane protein, and an N-myristoylation site is needed for both its membrane localization and functions. OsBSK2 directly interacts with the BR receptor kinase OsBRI1, however, genetic experiments have demonstrated that OsBSK2 likely regulates grain size independently of the BR signaling pathway. OsBSK2 can form a homodimer or heterodimers with OsBSK3 and OsBSK4, and silencing OsBSK2, OsBSK3, and OsBSK4 reduced grain size. This indicates that OsBSKs seem to function as homodimers or heterodimers to positively regulate grain size in rice. They are both highly expressed in young panicles and spikelet hulls, which indicates that they regulate grain size. In summary, our results provide novel insights into the function of BSKs in rice and novel targets for improving grain size during crop breeding.
NA	The divergence of brassinosteroid sensitivity between rice subspecies involves natural variation conferring altered internal auto-binding of OsBSK2.	2022	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, China.	Japonica/geng and indica/xian are two major rice (Oryza sativa) subspecies with multiple divergent traits, but how these traits are related and interact within each subspecies remains elusive. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of steroid phytohormones that modulate many important agronomic traits in rice. Here, using different physiological assays, we revealed that japonica rice exhibits an overall lower BR sensitivity than indica. Extensive screening of BR signaling genes led to the identification of a set of genes distributed throughout the primary BR signaling pathway with divergent polymorphisms. Among these, we demonstrate that the C38/T variant in BR Signaling Kinase2 (OsBSK2), causing the amino acid change P13L, plays a central role in mediating differential BR signaling in japonica and indica rice. OsBSK2(L13) in indica plays a greater role in BR signaling than OsBSK2(P13) in japonica by affecting the auto-binding and protein accumulation of OsBSK2. Finally, we determined that OsBSK2 is involved in a number of divergent traits in japonica relative to indica rice, including grain shape, tiller number, cold adaptation, and nitrogen-use efficiency. Our study suggests that the natural variation in OsBSK2 plays a key role in the divergence of BR signaling, which underlies multiple divergent traits between japonica and indica.
