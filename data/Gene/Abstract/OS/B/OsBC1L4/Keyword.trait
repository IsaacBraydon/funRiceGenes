OsBC1L4	cellulose	OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice	 A decrease in cellulose content but the increase in pectin and starch contents was identified in Osbc1l4 mutants by measuring the content of wall components
OsBC1L4	cellulose	OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice	 Correlation analysis indicated that the expression of OsBC1L4 was highly correlated to that of several primary wall-forming cellulose synthase genes (CESAs)
OsBC1L4	cellulose	OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice	 Moreover, the expression level of several cellulose-related genes is increased in Osbc1l4 mutants, which suggests that a feedback mechanism may exist during cellulose synthesis
OsBC1L4	cellulose	OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice	OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice
OsBC1L4	tiller	OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice	 Previously, a dwarf mutant with fewer tillers, Osbc1l4 (Oryza sativa brittle culm 1 like 4), was identified by screening a rice T-DNA insertion mutant library
OsBC1L4	cell wall	OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice	 OsBC1L4 protein is mainly located in the cell wall and plasma membrane
OsBC1L4	dwarf	OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice	 Previously, a dwarf mutant with fewer tillers, Osbc1l4 (Oryza sativa brittle culm 1 like 4), was identified by screening a rice T-DNA insertion mutant library
OsBC1L4	starch	OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice	 A decrease in cellulose content but the increase in pectin and starch contents was identified in Osbc1l4 mutants by measuring the content of wall components
OsBC1L4	culm	OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice	 Previously, a dwarf mutant with fewer tillers, Osbc1l4 (Oryza sativa brittle culm 1 like 4), was identified by screening a rice T-DNA insertion mutant library
