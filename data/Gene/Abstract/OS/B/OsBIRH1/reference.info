Bot.-2008-Li-2133-46.pdf	OsBIRH1, a DEAD-box RNA helicase with functions in modulating defence responses against pathogen infection and oxidative stress	2008	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory for Rice Biology, Institute of Biotechnology, Zhejiang University-Huajiachi Campus, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310029, People's Republic of China.	DEAD-box proteins comprise a large protein family with members from all kingdoms and play important roles in all types of processes in RNA metabolism. In this study, a rice gene OsBIRH1, which encodes a DEAD-box RNA helicase protein, was cloned and characterized. The predicted OsBIRH1 protein contains a DEAD domain and all conserved motifs that are common characteristics of DEAD-box RNA helicases. Recombinant OsBIRH1 protein purified from Escherichia coli was shown to have both RNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent RNA helicase activities in vitro. Expression of OsBIRH1 was activated in rice seedling leaves after treatment with defence-related signal chemicals, for example benzothiadiazole, salicylic acid, l-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, and jasmonic acid, and was also up-regulated in an incompatible interaction between a resistant rice genotype and the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress the OsBIRH1 gene were generated. Disease resistance phenotype assays revealed that the OsBIRH1-overexpressing transgenic plants showed an enhanced disease resistance against Alternaria brassicicola and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. Meanwhile, defence-related genes, for example PR-1, PR-2, PR-5, and PDF1.2, showed an up-regulated expression in the transgenic plants. Moreover, the OsBIRH1 transgenic Arabidopsis plants also showed increased tolerance to oxidative stress and elevated expression levels of oxidative defence genes, AtApx1, AtApx2, and AtFSD1. The results suggest that OsBIRH1 encodes a functional DEAD-box RNA helicase and plays important roles in defence responses against biotic and abiotic stresses.
NA	A DEAD-box RNA helicase TCD33 that confers chloroplast development in rice at seedling stage under cold stress.	2020	J Plant Physiol	College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China.	Cold stress is one of the most common unfavorable environmental factors affecting the growth, development, and survival of plants. The DEAD-box RNA helicases play important roles in all types of processes of RNA metabolism. However, the function of DEAD-box RNA helicase under cold stress is poorly explored in plants, especially in rice. This study reported the identification of a novel rice thermo-sensitive chlorophyll-deficient mutant, tcd33, which displayed an albino phenotype before the four-leaf stage, then withered and eventually died at 20<U+2009>°„C, while wild-type plants exhibited normal green coloration at 32<U+2009>°„C. The tcd33 seedlings also exhibited less chlorophyll contents and severe defects of chloroplast structure under 20<U+2009>°„C condition. Map-based cloning and complementation experiments suggested that TCD33 encodes a chloroplast-located DEAD-box RNA helicase protein. The transcript expression level of TCD33 indicated that the genes related to chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis, photosynthesis, and chloroplast development in tcd33 mutants were down-regulated at 20<U+2009>°„C, while the down-regulated genes were nearly recovered to or slightly higher than the WT level at 32<U+2009>°„C. Together, our results suggest that the cold-inducible TCD33 is essential for early chloroplast development and is important for cold-responsive gene regulation and cold tolerance in rice.
