NA	OsBIC1 Directly Interacts with OsCRYs to Regulate Leaf Sheath Length through Mediating GA-Responsive Pathway.	2021	Int J Mol Sci	Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Cryptochrome 1 and 2 (CRY1 and CRY2) are blue light receptors involved in the regulation of hypocotyl elongation, cotyledon expansion, and flowering time in Arabidopsisthaliana. Two cryptochrome-interacting proteins, Blue-light Inhibitor of Cryptochrome 1 and 2 (BIC1 and BIC2), have been found in Arabidopsis. BIC1 plays critical roles in suppressing the physiological activities of CRY2, which include the blue light-dependent dimerization, phosphorylation, photobody formation, and degradation process, but the functional characterization of BIC protein in other crops has not yet been performed. To investigate the function of BIC protein in rice (Oryza sativa), two homologous genes of Arabidopsis&amp;nbsp;BIC1 and BIC2, namely OsBIC1 and OsBIC2&amp;nbsp;(OsBICs), were identified. The overexpression of OsBIC1 and OsBIC2 led to increased leaf sheath length, whereas mutations in OsBIC1 displayed shorter leaf sheath in a blue light intensity-dependent manner. OsBIC1 regulated blue light-induced leaf sheath elongation through direct interaction with OsCRY1a, OsCRY1b, and OsCRY2 (OsCRYs). Longitudinal sections of the second leaf sheath demonstrated that OsBIC1 and OsCRYs controlled leaf sheath length by influencing the ratio of epidermal cells with different lengths. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis further proved that OsBIC1 and OsCRYs regulated similar transcriptome changes in regulating Gibberellic Acids (GA)-responsive pathway. Taken together, these results suggested that OsBIC1 and OsCRYs worked together to regulate epidermal cell elongation and control blue light-induced leaf sheath elongation through the GA-responsive pathway.
