OsBC1L1	 OsBC1L1 overexpression also causes abnormal stomatal patterning in rice |  The expression of OsSPCH2 and OsFAMA, two genes key to stomatal development is both down-regulated in osbc1l1 osbc1l8 |  In contrast, overexpressing OsBC1L1 suppresses only the expression of OsSPCH2	 OsBC1L1 overexpression also causes abnormal stomatal patterning in rice
