OsbZIP49	 Additionally, we provide evidence that OsbZIP49 activates the expression of indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetases OsGH3-2 and OsGH3-13 by directly binding to TGACG motifs located within the promoters of both genes |  Knockout of OsbZIP49 led to reduced expression of both OsGH3-2 and OsGH3-13 within the shoot base, and increased accumulation of IAA and increased OsIAA20 expression levels were observed in transformants following gravistimulation
