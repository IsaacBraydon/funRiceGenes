OsbZIP49	OsGH3-2|OsGH3.2	Transcription Factor OsbZIP49 Controls Tiller Angle and Plant Architecture through the Induction of Indole-3-acetic Acid-amido Synthetases in Rice.	 Additionally, we provide evidence that OsbZIP49 activates the expression of indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetases OsGH3-2 and OsGH3-13 by directly binding to TGACG motifs located within the promoters of both genes
OsbZIP49	OsGH3-2|OsGH3.2	Transcription Factor OsbZIP49 Controls Tiller Angle and Plant Architecture through the Induction of Indole-3-acetic Acid-amido Synthetases in Rice.	 Knockout of OsbZIP49 led to reduced expression of both OsGH3-2 and OsGH3-13 within the shoot base, and increased accumulation of IAA and increased OsIAA20 expression levels were observed in transformants following gravistimulation
OsbZIP49	OsGH3.13|TLD1|OsGH3-13	Transcription Factor OsbZIP49 Controls Tiller Angle and Plant Architecture through the Induction of Indole-3-acetic Acid-amido Synthetases in Rice	Knockout of OsbZIP49 led to reduced expression of both OsGH3-2 and OsGH3-13 within the shoot base, and increased accumulation of IAA and increased OsIAA20 expression levels were observed in transformants following gravistimulation.
