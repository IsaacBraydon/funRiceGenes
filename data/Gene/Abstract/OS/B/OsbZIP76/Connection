OsbZIP76	OsNF-YB1	OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice  (Oryza sativa).	 As a putative  transcription factor, OsbZIP76 alone lacked transcriptional activation activity;  however, it interacted with the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) family transcription factors OsNF-YB9 and OsNF-YB1 in yeast and in planta
OsbZIP76	OsNF-YB1	OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice  (Oryza sativa).	 Seeds of osnf-yb1 and osbzip76 mutants showed reduced size and reduced apparent amylose content
OsbZIP76	OsNF-YB9	OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice  (Oryza sativa).	 As a putative  transcription factor, OsbZIP76 alone lacked transcriptional activation activity;  however, it interacted with the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) family transcription factors OsNF-YB9 and OsNF-YB1 in yeast and in planta
OsbZIP76	OsNF-YB9	OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice  (Oryza sativa).	 OsbZIP76 and OsNF-YB9 were  predominantly expressed in the endosperm and the proteins colocalized
