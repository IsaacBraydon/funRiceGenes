OsbZIP76	transcription factor	OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice  (Oryza sativa).	 As a putative  transcription factor, OsbZIP76 alone lacked transcriptional activation activity;  however, it interacted with the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) family transcription factors OsNF-YB9 and OsNF-YB1 in yeast and in planta
OsbZIP76	development	OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice  (Oryza sativa).	 Genes involved in endosperm development or starch biosynthesis were prematurely activated in the osbzip76 caryopsis
OsbZIP76	development	OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice  (Oryza sativa).	 In summary, OsbZIP76 is an endosperm-expressed imprinted gene that regulates endosperm development in rice
OsbZIP76	starch	OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice  (Oryza sativa).	 Genes involved in endosperm development or starch biosynthesis were prematurely activated in the osbzip76 caryopsis
OsbZIP76	endosperm	OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice  (Oryza sativa).	OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice  (Oryza sativa).

OsbZIP76	endosperm cellularization	OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice (Oryza sativa)	OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice (Oryza sativa)
OsbZIP76	amylose content	OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice (Oryza sativa)	Seeds of osnf-yb1 and osbzip76 mutants showed reduced size and reduced apparent amylose content.
