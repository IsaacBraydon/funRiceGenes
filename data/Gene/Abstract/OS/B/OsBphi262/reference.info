Park-2008-Molecular tagging of.pdf	Molecular tagging of the Bph1 locus for resistance to brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stal) through representational difference analysis	2008	Mol Genet Genomics	Rice Division, Yeongnam Agricultural Research Institute, National Institute of Crop Science, RDA, Milyang, South Korea.	During brown planthopper (BPH) feeding on rice plants, we employed a modified representational difference analysis (RDA) method to detect rare transcripts among those differentially expressed in SNBC61, a BPH resistant near-isogenic line (NIL) carrying the Bph1 resistance gene. This identified 3 RDA clones: OsBphi237, OsBphi252 and OsBphi262. DNA gel-blot analysis revealed that the loci of the RDA clones in SNBC61 corresponded to the alleles of the BPH resistant donor Samgangbyeo. Expression analysis indicated that the RDA genes were up-regulated in SNBC61 during BPH feeding. Interestingly, analysis of 64 SNBC NILs, derived from backcrosses of Samgangbyeo with a BPH susceptible Nagdongbyeo, using a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker indicated that OsBphi252, which encodes a putative lipoxygenase (LOX), co-segregates with BPH resistance. Our results suggest that OsBphi252 is tightly linked to Bph1, and may be useful in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for resistance to BPH.
