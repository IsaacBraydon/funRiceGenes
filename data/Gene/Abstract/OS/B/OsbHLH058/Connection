OsbHLH058|OsPRI2	OsHRZ1	OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 transcription factors positively regulate iron deficiency responses in rice.	 Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that OsbHLH058 interacts with OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 more strongly than OsbHLH060, whereas OsbHLH059 showed no interaction
OsbHLH058|OsPRI2	OsHRZ1	OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 transcription factors positively regulate iron deficiency responses in rice.	 An in vitro ubiquitination assay detected no OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH060 ubiquitination by OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2
OsbHLH058|OsPRI2	OsHRZ2	OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 transcription factors positively regulate iron deficiency responses in rice.	 Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that OsbHLH058 interacts with OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 more strongly than OsbHLH060, whereas OsbHLH059 showed no interaction
OsbHLH058|OsPRI2	OsHRZ2	OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 transcription factors positively regulate iron deficiency responses in rice.	 An in vitro ubiquitination assay detected no OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH060 ubiquitination by OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2
OsbHLH058|OsPRI2	OsIMA2	Iron deficiency-inducible peptide coding genes OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 positively regulate a major pathway of iron uptake and translocation in rice	 Here, we report that the expressions of two IMA/FEP genes in rice, OsIMA1 and OsIMA2, are strongly induced under Fe-deficiency, positively regulated by the transcription factors IDEF1, OsbHLH058, OsbHLH059, as well as OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 themselves, and negatively regulated by HRZ ubiquitin ligases
