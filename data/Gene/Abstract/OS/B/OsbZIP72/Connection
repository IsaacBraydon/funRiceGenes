OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsbZIP72|OsABF4	The OsABF1 transcription factor improves drought tolerance by activating the transcription of COR413-TM1 in rice.	 In addition, OsABF1 directly regulates the expression of the protein phosphatase 2C (OsPP48 and OsPP108) and bZIP (OsbZIP23, OsbZIP46, and OsbZIP72) genes, thus forming a complex feedback circuit in the drought/abscisic acid signaling pathway
OsbZIP72|OsABF4	OsMFT2	OsMFT2 is involved in the regulation of ABA signaling-mediated seed germination through interacting with OsbZIP23/66/72 in rice.	 In vivo and in vitro assays showed that three bZIP transcription factors, OsbZIP23, OsbZIP66 and OsbZIP72, interacted with OsMFT2

OsbZIP72|OsABF4	OsSWEET15	Sucrose transport in response to drought and salt stress involves ABA-mediated induction of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 in rice	 Transactivation analyses showed that an abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 directly binds to the promoters of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 and activates their expression
OsbZIP72|OsABF4	OsSWEET15	Sucrose transport in response to drought and salt stress involves ABA-mediated induction of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 in rice	 Taken together, the results showed that the higher expressions of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 genes, induced by binding of an ABA-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 to the promoters, potentially modulate sucrose transport and distribution in response to the abiotic stresses
OsbZIP72|OsABF4	Xa25|OsSWEET13	Sucrose transport in response to drought and salt stress involves ABA-mediated induction of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 in rice	 Transactivation analyses showed that an abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 directly binds to the promoters of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 and activates their expression
