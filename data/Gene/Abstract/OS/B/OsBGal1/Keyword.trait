OsBGal1	seedling	Molecular characterization of Î²-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)	 The two genes were found to be relatively highly expressed in seedling roots and shoots and in leaf sheath in 15â€<U+393C><U+3E33>30-day-old plants, which contained major immunoreactive proteins of approximately 90 kDa for OsBGal1 protein and 55 kDa for OsBGal2 in extracts of these tissues
