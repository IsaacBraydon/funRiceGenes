1-s2.0-S0733521012001683-main.pdf	An SNP downstream of the OsBEIIb gene is significantly associated with amylose content and viscosity properties in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2012	Journal of Cereal Science	Department of Plant Resources, College of Industrial Sciences, Kongju National University, Yesan 340-802, Republic of Korea	Allele mining in starch synthesis-related genes (SSRGs) has facilitated the discovery of desired natural sequence variations for eating quality in rice. This study investigated the sequence variations from 10 SSRGs, and further evaluated their relationship with the amylose content (AC) and rapid viscosity analysis profiles in a global collection of rice accessions by association mapping (AM). In total, 83 sequence variations were found in 10 sequenced amplicons, including 73 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), eight insertion-deletions (InDels) and two polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Four subpopulations were identified by population structure analysis based on 170 genome-wide SSR genotypes. AM revealed 11 significant associations between three phenotypic indices and three sequence variations. One SNP with a g/c transversion at the 63rd nucleotide downstream of the OsBEIIb gene termination codon on rice chromosome 2 was significantly associated with multiple trait indices in both the general linear and mixed linear models (GLM and MLM), including the final viscosity (p < 0.001, R2 = 23.87%) in both 2009 and 2010, and AC (p < 0.01, R2 = 11.25%) and trough viscosity (p < 0.01, R2 = 20.43) in 2010. This study provides a new perspective of allele mining for breeding strategies based on marker-assisted selection.
14763103.pdf	The structure of starch can be manipulated by changing the expression levels of starch branching enzyme IIb in rice endosperm	2004	Plant Biotechnol J	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	When the starch branching enzyme IIb (BEIIb) gene was introduced into a BEIIb-defective mutant, the resulting transgenic rice plants showed a wide range of BEIIb activity and the fine structure of their amylopectins showed considerable variation despite having the two other BE isoforms, BEI and BEIIa, in their endosperm at the same levels as in the wild-type. The properties of the starch granules, such as their gelatinization behaviour, morphology and X-ray diffraction pattern, also changed dramatically depending on the level of BEIIb activity, even when this was either slightly lower or higher than that of the wild-type. The over-expression of BEIIb resulted in the accumulation of excessive branched, water-soluble polysaccharides instead of amylopectin. These results imply that the manipulation of BEIIb activity is an effective strategy for the generation of novel starches for use in foodstuffs and industrial applications.

Starch composition and the amount in endosperm, both of which contribute dramatically to seed yield, cooking quality, and taste in cereals, are determined by a series of complex biochemical reactions. However, the mechanism regulating starch biosynthesis in cereal seeds is not well understood. This study showed that OsbZIP58, a bZIP transcription factor, is a key transcriptional regulator controlling starch synthesis in rice endosperm. OsbZIP58 was expressed mainly in endosperm during active starch synthesis. osbzip58 null mutants displayed abnormal seed morphology with altered starch accumulation in the white belly region and decreased amounts of total starch and amylose. Moreover, osbzip58 had a higher proportion of short chains and a lower proportion of intermediate chains of amylopectin. Furthermore, OsbZIP58 was shown to bind directly to the promoters of six starch-synthesizing genes, OsAGPL3, Wx, OsSSIIa, SBE1, OsBEIIb, and ISA2, and to regulate their expression. These findings indicate that OsbZIP58 functions as a key regulator of starch synthesis in rice seeds and provide new insights into seed quality control.
NA	MutMapPlus identified novel mutant alleles of a rice starch branching enzyme IIb gene for fine-tuning of cooked rice texture.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Division of Crop Development, Central Region Agricultural Research Center, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO).	Physico-chemical properties of storage starch largely determine rice grain quality and food characteristics. Therefore, modification of starch property is effective to fine-tune cooked rice textures. To obtain new resources with modified starch property as breeding materials, we screened a mutant population of a japonica cultivar Nipponbare and found two independent mutant lines, altered gelatinization (age) 1 and age2, with moderate changes in starch gelatinization property. A combination of conventional genetic analyses and the latest mapping method, MutMapPlus, revealed that both of these lines harbor novel independent mutant alleles of starch branching enzyme IIb (BEIIb) gene. In age1, amino acid substitution of Met-723 to Lys completely abolished BEIIb enzyme activity without significant reduction of its protein level. A transposon insertion in an intron of BEIIb gene reduced BEIIb protein level and activity in age2. Production of a series of the mutant lines by combining age alleles and indica-type starch synthase IIa allele established stepwise alteration of the physico-chemical properties of starch including apparent amylose content, thermal property, digestibility by ¦Á-amylase, and branched structures of amylopectin. Consistent with the alteration of starch properties, the results of a sensory evaluation test demonstrated that warm cooked rice of the mutants showed a variety of textures without marked reduction of overall palatability. These results suggest that a series of the mutant lines are capable of manipulation of cooked rice textures. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
