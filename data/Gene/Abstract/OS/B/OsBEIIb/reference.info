1-s2.0-S0733521012001683-main.pdf	An SNP downstream of the OsBEIIb gene is significantly associated with amylose content and viscosity properties in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2012	Journal of Cereal Science	Department of Plant Resources, College of Industrial Sciences, Kongju National University, Yesan 340-802, Republic of Korea	Allele mining in starch synthesis-related genes (SSRGs) has facilitated the discovery of desired natural sequence variations for eating quality in rice. This study investigated the sequence variations from 10 SSRGs, and further evaluated their relationship with the amylose content (AC) and rapid viscosity analysis profiles in a global collection of rice accessions by association mapping (AM). In total, 83 sequence variations were found in 10 sequenced amplicons, including 73 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), eight insertion-deletions (InDels) and two polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Four subpopulations were identified by population structure analysis based on 170 genome-wide SSR genotypes. AM revealed 11 significant associations between three phenotypic indices and three sequence variations. One SNP with a g/c transversion at the 63rd nucleotide downstream of the OsBEIIb gene termination codon on rice chromosome 2 was significantly associated with multiple trait indices in both the general linear and mixed linear models (GLM and MLM), including the final viscosity (p < 0.001, R2 = 23.87%) in both 2009 and 2010, and AC (p < 0.01, R2 = 11.25%) and trough viscosity (p < 0.01, R2 = 20.43) in 2010. This study provides a new perspective of allele mining for breeding strategies based on marker-assisted selection.
14763103.pdf	The structure of starch can be manipulated by changing the expression levels of starch branching enzyme IIb in rice endosperm	2004	Plant Biotechnol J	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	When the starch branching enzyme IIb (BEIIb) gene was introduced into a BEIIb-defective mutant, the resulting transgenic rice plants showed a wide range of BEIIb activity and the fine structure of their amylopectins showed considerable variation despite having the two other BE isoforms, BEI and BEIIa, in their endosperm at the same levels as in the wild-type. The properties of the starch granules, such as their gelatinization behaviour, morphology and X-ray diffraction pattern, also changed dramatically depending on the level of BEIIb activity, even when this was either slightly lower or higher than that of the wild-type. The over-expression of BEIIb resulted in the accumulation of excessive branched, water-soluble polysaccharides instead of amylopectin. These results imply that the manipulation of BEIIb activity is an effective strategy for the generation of novel starches for use in foodstuffs and industrial applications.

Starch composition and the amount in endosperm, both of which contribute dramatically to seed yield, cooking quality, and taste in cereals, are determined by a series of complex biochemical reactions. However, the mechanism regulating starch biosynthesis in cereal seeds is not well understood. This study showed that OsbZIP58, a bZIP transcription factor, is a key transcriptional regulator controlling starch synthesis in rice endosperm. OsbZIP58 was expressed mainly in endosperm during active starch synthesis. osbzip58 null mutants displayed abnormal seed morphology with altered starch accumulation in the white belly region and decreased amounts of total starch and amylose. Moreover, osbzip58 had a higher proportion of short chains and a lower proportion of intermediate chains of amylopectin. Furthermore, OsbZIP58 was shown to bind directly to the promoters of six starch-synthesizing genes, OsAGPL3, Wx, OsSSIIa, SBE1, OsBEIIb, and ISA2, and to regulate their expression. These findings indicate that OsbZIP58 functions as a key regulator of starch synthesis in rice seeds and provide new insights into seed quality control.
