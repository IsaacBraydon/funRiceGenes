FLO2	OsBEIIb|OsSBEIIb	Three novel alleles of FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2) confer dull grains with low amylose content in rice.	The allelic diversity of flo2 perturbed the expression of starch synthesis-related genes including OsAGPL2, OsAGPS2b, OsGBSSI, OsBEI, OsBEIIb, OsISA1, and OsPUL
OsBEIIb|OsSBEIIb	OsFRK3	New Fructokinase, OsFRK3, Regulates Starch Accumulation and Grain Filling in Rice.	 The transcript levels of OsGBSS1, OsBEIIb, OsPFP1Î², and OsAGPL1 were significantly decreased in the osfrk3 mutants
