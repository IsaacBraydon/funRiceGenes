OsBAG4	resistance	An E3<U+00A0>Ubiquitin Ligase-BAG Protein Module Controls Plant Innate Immunity and Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance.	Elevated levels of OsBAG4 in rice are necessary and sufficient to trigger PCD and enhanced disease resistance to pathogenic infection, most likely by activating pathogen-associated molecular patterns-triggered immunity (PTI)

OsBAG4	disease	The Divergent Roles of the Rice bcl-2 Associated Athanogene (BAG) Genes in Plant Development and Environmental Responses.	 The co-expression analysis and the hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that the OsBAG1 and OsBAG3 were co-expressed with primary cell wall-biosynthesizing genes, OsBAG4 was co-expressed with phytohormone and transcriptional factors, and OsBAG6 was co-expressed with disease and shock-associated genes

OsBAG4	stress	Plasma membrane-localized Hsp40/DNAJ chaperone protein facilitates OsSUVH7-OsBAG4-OsMYB106 transcriptional complex formation for OsHKT1;5 activation.	 Intriguingly, salt stress facilitates the nuclear relocation of OsDNAJ15 so that it can interact with OsBAG4, and OsDNAJ15 and OsBAG4 synergistically facilitate the DNA-binding activity of OsMYB106 to positively regulate the expression of OsHKT1;5
