NA	An E3<U+00A0>Ubiquitin Ligase-BAG Protein Module Controls Plant Innate Immunity and Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance.	2016	Cell Host Microbe	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics and National Center of Plant Gene Research, Institute of Plant Physiology &amp; Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China; University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.	Programmed cell death (PCD) and immunity in plants are tightly controlled to promote antimicrobial defense while preventing autoimmunity. However, the mechanisms contributing to this immune homeostasis are poorly understood. Here, we isolated a rice mutant ebr1 (enhanced blight and blast resistance 1) that shows enhanced broad-spectrum bacterial and fungal disease resistance, but displays spontaneous PCD, autoimmunity, and stunted growth. EBR1 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with OsBAG4, which belongs to the BAG (Bcl-2-associated athanogene) family that functions in cell death, growth arrest, and immune responses in mammals. EBR1 directly targets OsBAG4 for ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Elevated levels of OsBAG4 in rice are necessary and sufficient to trigger PCD and enhanced disease resistance to pathogenic infection, most likely by activating pathogen-associated molecular patterns-triggered immunity (PTI). Together, our study suggests that an E3-BAG module orchestrates innate immune homeostasis and coordinates the trade-off between defense and growth in plants.
NA	The Divergent Roles of the Rice bcl-2 Associated Athanogene (BAG) Genes in Plant Development and Environmental Responses.	2021	Plants (Basel)	State Key Laboratory for Conservation &amp; Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, College of Agriculture, Guangxi University, Nanning 530004, China.	Bcl-2-associated athanogene (BAG), a group of proteins evolutionarily conserved and functioned as co-chaperones in plants and animals, is involved in various cell activities and diverse physiological processes. However, the biological functions of this gene family in rice are largely unknown. In this study, we identified a total of six BAG members in rice. These genes were classified into two groups, OsBAG1, -2, -3, and -4 are in group I with a conserved ubiquitin-like structure and OsBAG5 and -6 are in group ‚Öêı<U+3E31> with a calmodulin-binding domain, in addition to a common BAG domain. The BAG genes exhibited diverse expression patterns, with OsBAG4 showing the highest expression level, followed by OsBAG1 and OsBAG3, and OsBAG6 preferentially expressed in the panicle, endosperm, and calli. The co-expression analysis and the hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that the OsBAG1 and OsBAG3 were co-expressed with primary cell wall-biosynthesizing genes, OsBAG4 was co-expressed with phytohormone and transcriptional factors, and OsBAG6 was co-expressed with disease and shock-associated genes. Œ≤-glucuronidase (GUS) staining further indicated that OsBAG3 is mainly involved in primary young tissues under both primary and secondary growth. In addition, the expression of the BAG genes under brown planthopper (BPH) feeding, N, P, and K deficiency, heat, drought and plant hormones treatments was investigated. Our results clearly showed that OsBAGs are multifunctional molecules as inferred by their protein structures, subcellular localizations, and expression profiles. BAGs in group I are mainly involved in plant development, whereas BAGs in group II are reactive in gene regulations and stress responses. Our results provide a solid basis for the further elucidation of the biological functions of plant BAG genes.
NA	Plasma membrane-localized Hsp40/DNAJ chaperone protein facilitates OsSUVH7-OsBAG4-OsMYB106 transcriptional complex formation for OsHKT1;5 activation.	2022	J Integr Plant Biol	Key Laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of the Ministry of Education (MOE), Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, China.	The salinization of irrigated land affects agricultural productivity. HIGH-AFFINITY POTASSIUM (K(+) ) TRANSPORTER 1;5 (OsHKT1;5)-dependent sodium (Na(+) ) transport is a key salt tolerance mechanism during rice growth and development. Using a previously generated high-throughput activation tagging-based T-DNA insertion mutant pool, we isolated a mutant exhibiting salt stress-sensitive phenotype, caused by a reduction in OsHKT1;5 transcripts. The salt stress-sensitive phenotype of this mutant results from the loss of function of OsDNAJ15, which encodes plasma membrane-localized heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40). osdnaj15 loss-of-function mutants show decreased plant height, increased leaf angle, and reduced grain number caused by shorter panicle length and fewer branches. On the other h&#x27;and, OsDNAJ15-overexpression plants showed salt stress-tolerant phenotypes. Intriguingly, salt stress facilitates the nuclear relocation of OsDNAJ15 so that it can interact with OsBAG4, and OsDNAJ15 and OsBAG4 synergistically facilitate the DNA-binding activity of OsMYB106 to positively regulate the expression of OsHKT1;5. Overall, our results reveal a novel function of plasma membrane-localized Hsp40 protein in modulating, alongside chaperon regulator OsBAG4, transcriptional regulation under salinity stress tolerance.
