EBR1	OsBAG4	An E3 Ubiquitin Ligase-BAG Protein Module Controls Plant Innate Immunity and Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance	EBR1 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with OsBAG4, which belongs to the BAG (Bcl-2-associated athanogene) family that functions in cell death, growth arrest, and immune responses in mammals.
EBR1	OsBAG4	An E3 Ubiquitin Ligase-BAG Protein Module Controls Plant Innate Immunity and Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance	EBR1 directly targets OsBAG4 for ubiquitination-mediated degradation.
OsBAG4	OsSUVH7	A DNA Methylation Reader-Chaperone Regulator-Transcription Factor Complex Activates OsHKT1;5 Expression during Salinity Stress	 Here, we present evidence that a protein complex consisting of rice BCL-2-ASSOCIATED ATHANOGENE4 (OsBAG4), OsMYB106, and OsSUVH7 regulates OsHKT1;5 expression in response to salt stress
OsBAG4	OsSUVH7	A DNA Methylation Reader-Chaperone Regulator-Transcription Factor Complex Activates OsHKT1;5 Expression during Salinity Stress	 OsBAG4 functioned as a bridge between OsSUVH7 and OsMYB106 to facilitate OsMYB106 binding to the consensus MYBE in the OsHKT1;5 promoter, thereby activating the OsHKT1;5 expression
OsBAG4	OsMYB106	A DNA Methylation Reader-Chaperone Regulator-Transcription Factor Complex Activates OsHKT1;5 Expression during Salinity Stress	 Here, we present evidence that a protein complex consisting of rice BCL-2-ASSOCIATED ATHANOGENE4 (OsBAG4), OsMYB106, and OsSUVH7 regulates OsHKT1;5 expression in response to salt stress
OsBAG4	OsMYB106	A DNA Methylation Reader-Chaperone Regulator-Transcription Factor Complex Activates OsHKT1;5 Expression during Salinity Stress	 OsBAG4 functioned as a bridge between OsSUVH7 and OsMYB106 to facilitate OsMYB106 binding to the consensus MYBE in the OsHKT1;5 promoter, thereby activating the OsHKT1;5 expression
OsBAG1	OsBAG4	The Divergent Roles of the Rice bcl-2 Associated Athanogene (BAG) Genes in Plant Development and Environmental Responses.	 The BAG genes exhibited diverse expression patterns, with OsBAG4 showing the highest expression level, followed by OsBAG1 and OsBAG3, and OsBAG6 preferentially expressed in the panicle, endosperm, and calli
OsBAG1	OsBAG4	The Divergent Roles of the Rice bcl-2 Associated Athanogene (BAG) Genes in Plant Development and Environmental Responses.	 The co-expression analysis and the hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that the OsBAG1 and OsBAG3 were co-expressed with primary cell wall-biosynthesizing genes, OsBAG4 was co-expressed with phytohormone and transcriptional factors, and OsBAG6 was co-expressed with disease and shock-associated genes
