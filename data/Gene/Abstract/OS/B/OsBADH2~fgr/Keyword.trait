OsBADH2|fgr	root	RNAi-directed downregulation of OsBADH2 results in aroma (2-acetyl-1-pyrroline) production in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	RESULTS: The results showed that multiple mutations identical to fgr allele occur in the 13 fragrant rice accessions across China; OsBADH2 is expressed constitutively, with less expression abundance in mature roots; the disrupted OsBADH2 by RNA interference leads to significantly increased 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline production
OsBADH2|fgr	sterile	Creation of Two-Line Fragrant Glutinous Hybrid Rice by Editing the Wx and OsBADH2 Genes via the CRISPR/Cas9 System.	 We edited Wx and OsBADH2 using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to produce both homozygous male sterile mutant lines and homozygous restorer mutant lines with Cas9-free
