We describe a boron (B) transporter, Os BOR1, in rice (Oryza sativa). Os BOR1 is a plasma membrane-localized efflux transporter of B and is required for normal growth of rice plants under conditions of limited B supply (referred to as -B). Disruption of Os BOR1 reduced B uptake and xylem loading of B. The accumulation of Os BOR1 transcripts was higher in roots than that in shoots and was not affected by B deprivation; however, Os BOR1 was detected in the roots of wild-type plants under -B conditions, but not under normal conditions, suggesting regulation of protein accumulation in response to B nutrition. Interestingly, tissue specificity of Os BOR1 expression is affected by B treatment. Transgenic rice plants containing an Os BOR1 promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion construct grown with a normal B supply showed the strongest GUS activity in the steles, whereas after 3 d of -B treatment, GUS activity was elevated in the exodermis. After 6 d of -B treatment, GUS activity was again strong in the stele. Our results demonstrate that Os BOR1 is required both for efficient B uptake and for xylem loading of B. Possible roles of the temporal changes in tissue-specific patterns of Os BOR1 expression in response to B condition are discussed.
NA	Fine regulation system for distribution of boron to different tissues in rice	2021	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Silviculture, Zhejiang A&F University, Lin'An 311300, Zhejiang, China.	Requirement of boron (B) essential for the growth and development differs with organs and tissues, but the molecular mechanisms underlying proper distribution of B to different tissues are poorly understood. We investigated the role of a rice gene (OsBOR1) encoding a boron (B) efflux transporter in distribution of B to different tissues under different B supplies. OsBOR1 was highly expressed in the nodes at all growth stages. The OsBOR1 protein shows polar localization at the distal side of bundle sheath cells in nodes and xylem parenchyma cells of elongating leaf sheath, but at the proximal side of bundle sheath in the mature leaf sheath and blade. Furthermore, the expression of OsBOR1 was not affected by external B fluctuations, but the OsBOR1 protein was gradually degraded in response to high B. Knockout of this gene altered B distribution; decreased distribution of B to new leaves and panicles, but increased B distribution to old leaves. These results indicate that OsBOR1 expressed in nodes and leaf sheath is involved in the proper distribution of B to different tissues in rice. Furthermore, the OsBOR1 undergoes degradation in response to high B for fine regulation of B distribution to different tissues.
