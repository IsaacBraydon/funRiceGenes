OsBOR1	leaf	Fine regulation system for distribution of boron to different tissues in rice	 The OsBOR1 protein shows polar localization at the distal side of bundle sheath cells in nodes and xylem parenchyma cells of elongating leaf sheath, but at the proximal side of bundle sheath in the mature leaf sheath and blade
OsBOR1	leaf	Fine regulation system for distribution of boron to different tissues in rice	 These results indicate that OsBOR1 expressed in nodes and leaf sheath is involved in the proper distribution of B to different tissues in rice
