D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	OsBSK3	OsBRI1 activates BR signaling by preventing binding between the TPR and kinase domains of OsBSK3 via phosphorylation.	OsBRI1 activates BR signaling by preventing binding between the TPR and kinase domains of OsBSK3 via phosphorylation.
D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	OsBSK3	OsBRI1 activates BR signaling by preventing binding between the TPR and kinase domains of OsBSK3 via phosphorylation.	Genetic studies revealed that OsBSK3 is a positive regulator of BR signaling in rice, while in vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that OsBRI1 interacts directly with and phosphorylates OsBSK3
D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	OsBSK3	OsBRI1 activates BR signaling by preventing binding between the TPR and kinase domains of OsBSK3 via phosphorylation.	Phosphorylation of OsBSK3 by OsBRI1 disrupts the interaction between its TPR and kinase domains, thereby increasing the binding between OsBSK3's kinase domain and BSU1
OsBSK2	OsBSK3	OsBSK2, a putative brassinosteroid-signaling kinase, positively controls grain size in rice.	 OsBSK2 can form a homodimer or heterodimers with OsBSK3 and OsBSK4, and silencing OsBSK2, OsBSK3, and OsBSK4 reduced grain size
