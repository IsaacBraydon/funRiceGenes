D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1|HFR131	OsBSK3	OsBRI1 activates BR signaling by preventing binding between the TPR and kinase domains of OsBSK3 via phosphorylation.	Genetic studies revealed that OsBSK3 is a positive regulator of BR signaling in rice, while in vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that OsBRI1 interacts directly with and phosphorylates OsBSK3
D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1|HFR131	OsBSK3	OsBRI1 activates BR signaling by preventing binding between the TPR and kinase domains of OsBSK3 via phosphorylation.	Phosphorylation of OsBSK3 by OsBRI1 disrupts the interaction between its TPR and kinase domains, thereby increasing the binding between OsBSK3's kinase domain and BSU1
OsBSK2	OsBSK3	OsBSK2, a putative brassinosteroid-signaling kinase, positively controls grain size in rice.	 OsBSK2 can form a homodimer or heterodimers with OsBSK3 and OsBSK4, and silencing OsBSK2, OsBSK3, and OsBSK4 reduced grain size

Furthermore, OsBSK3 could physically interact with OsPPKL1 and OsGSK3, the downstream components in BR signaling, as a scaffold protein, and inhibit the phosphatase activity of OsPPKL1 on the dephosphorylation of OsGSK3
GL3.1|qGL3-1|qGL3|OsPPKL1	OsBSK3	OsBSK3 Positively Regulates Grain Length and Weight by Inhibiting the Phosphatase Activity of OsPPKL1.	 In addition, the genetic evidence showed OsBSK3 acts upstream of OsPPKL1 in regulating grain length and weight
