NA	OsBRI1 activates BR signaling by preventing binding between the TPR and kinase domains of OsBSK3 via phosphorylation.	2015	Plant Physiol	Hebei Normal University CITY: Shijiazhuang STATE: Hebei Province China [CN].	Many plant receptor kinases transduce signals through receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs); however, the molecular mechanisms that create an effective on-off switch are unknown. The receptor kinase BRI1 transduces brassinosteroid (BR) signal by phosphorylating members of the BR-signaling kinase (BSK) family of RLCKs, which contain a kinase domain and a C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. Here, we show that the BR signaling function of BSKs is conserved in Arabidopsis and rice, and that the TPR domain of BSKs functions as a &quot;phospho-switchable&quot; autoregulatory domain to control BSKs' activity. Genetic studies revealed that OsBSK3 is a positive regulator of BR signaling in rice, while in vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that OsBRI1 interacts directly with and phosphorylates OsBSK3. The TPR domain of OsBSK3, which interacts directly with the protein's kinase domain, serves as an autoinhibitory domain to prevent OsBSK3 from interacting with BSU1. Phosphorylation of OsBSK3 by OsBRI1 disrupts the interaction between its TPR and kinase domains, thereby increasing the binding between OsBSK3's kinase domain and BSU1. Our results not only demonstrate that OsBSK3 plays a conserved role in regulating BR signaling in rice, but also provide insight into the molecular mechanism by which BSK family proteins are inhibited under basal conditions but switched on by the upstream receptor kinase BRI1.
NA	OsBSK1-2, an Orthologous of AtBSK1, Is Involved in Rice Immunity.	2017	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Key Laboratory of Major Crop Diseases &amp; Collaborative Innovation Center for Hybrid Rice in Yangtze River Basin, Sichuan Agricultural University at Wenjiang, ChengduChina.	The brassinosteroid-SIGNALING KINASE (BSK) belongs to the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase XII subgroup. BSK1 regulates development and immunity in Arabidopsis. However, the function of rice (Oryza sativa) BSK1 is largely unknown. Here, we report that the expression level of OsBSK1-2 is induced after a chitin or fagellin22 (flg22) treatment. Silencing OsBSK1-2 in rice results in compromised responses to or flg22-triggered immunity and resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae, but does not alter the plant&#39;s architecture nor reduce plant responses to brassinosteroid signaling. Our study reveals that OsBSK1-2 functions as a major regulator in rice plant immunity.
NA	OsBSK3 Positively Regulates Grain Length and Weight by Inhibiting the Phosphatase Activity of OsPPKL1.	2022	Plants (Basel)	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a crucial class of plant hormones that regulate many important agronomic traits in rice (Oryza sativa L.); thus, the BR signaling pathway is a very important tool for breeders to improve the grain yield and quantity of rice. Contrary to the well-established BR signaling pathway in Arabidopsis, there are significant gaps in the rice BR signaling pathway, especially the regulation mechanism from OsBSK3 to OsPPKLs and OsGSKs. In this study, we report how OsBSK3 knockout mutants confer shorter and lighter grains and exhibit a typical BR-insensitive phenotype, suggesting OsBSK3 plays a positive role in BR signaling without genetic redundancy with homologs. Furthermore, OsBSK3 could physically interact with OsPPKL1 and OsGSK3, the downstream components in BR signaling, as a scaffold protein, and inhibit the phosphatase activity of OsPPKL1 on the dephosphorylation of OsGSK3. In addition, the genetic evidence showed OsBSK3 acts upstream of OsPPKL1 in regulating grain length and weight. Our results clarify the role of OsBSK3 and provide new insights into BR-signaling mechanisms, leading to potential new targets for the genetic improvement of rice.
