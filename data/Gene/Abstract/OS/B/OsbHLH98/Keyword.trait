OsbHLH98	leaf	OsbHLH98 regulates leaf angle in rice through transcriptional repression of OsBUL1.	OsbHLH98 regulates leaf angle in rice through transcriptional repression of OsBUL1.
OsbHLH98	leaf	OsbHLH98 regulates leaf angle in rice through transcriptional repression of OsBUL1.	 osbhlh98 mutant leaves formed a larger leaf angle, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing OsbHLH98 exhibited a slight reduction in leaf angle
OsbHLH98	leaf	OsbHLH98 regulates leaf angle in rice through transcriptional repression of OsBUL1.	 We determined that the changes in leaf angle resulted from increased number and size of parenchyma cells on the adaxial side of the lamina joint in osbhlh98 mutants
OsbHLH98	leaf	OsbHLH98 regulates leaf angle in rice through transcriptional repression of OsBUL1.	 Experiments using reporter constructs showed that OsbHLH98 is expressed on the adaxial side of lamina joints, consistent with its proposed function in regulating leaf angle
OsbHLH98	leaf	OsbHLH98 regulates leaf angle in rice through transcriptional repression of OsBUL1.	 Our results demonstrate that OsbHLH98 negatively regulates leaf angle by counteracting brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation via the repression of OsBUL1 transcription
OsbHLH98	leaf	OsbHLH98 regulates leaf angle in rice through transcriptional repression of OsBUL1.	 The characterization of OsbHLH98 and its role in determining leaf angle will lay the foundation to develop the ideal plant architecture for adaptation to high planting density
