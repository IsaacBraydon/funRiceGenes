OsBRXL4	auxin	Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice	 OsBRXL1 and OsBRXL4 were significantly up-regulated by brassinosteroid and auxin, respectively| The OsBRXL4-overexpression plant showed significantly longer root and increased sensitivity to auxin than wild type, suggesting that OsBRXL4 may be involved in primary root growth through the auxin signaling pathway
OsBRXL4	root	Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice	 The OsBRXL4-overexpression plant showed significantly longer root and increased sensitivity to auxin than wild type, suggesting that OsBRXL4 may be involved in primary root growth through the auxin signaling pathway
OsBRXL4	growth	Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice	 The OsBRXL4-overexpression plant showed significantly longer root and increased sensitivity to auxin than wild type, suggesting that OsBRXL4 may be involved in primary root growth through the auxin signaling pathway
OsBRXL4	primary root	Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice	 The OsBRXL4-overexpression plant showed significantly longer root and increased sensitivity to auxin than wild type, suggesting that OsBRXL4 may be involved in primary root growth through the auxin signaling pathway
OsBRXL4	brassinosteroid	Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice	 OsBRXL1 and OsBRXL4 were significantly up-regulated by brassinosteroid and auxin, respectively
OsBRXL4	panicle	Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice	 Four rice BRX-like genes were predominantly (OsBRXL1, OsBRXL2, and OsBRXL4) or specifically (OsBRXL3) expressed in young panicle
