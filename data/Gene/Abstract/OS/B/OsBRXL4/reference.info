In this study, six members of rice BRX-like gene family containing the conserved BRX domain were identified in japonica rice. Phytogenetic analysis suggested that BRX-like genes may be evolved before the divergence of vascular plant and bryophytes species. Four rice BRX-like genes were predominantly (OsBRXL1, OsBRXL2, and OsBRXL4) or specifically (OsBRXL3) expressed in young panicle. Except one member (OsBRXL6) that was not expressed in all the tissues and organs investigated, the other five genes were differentially responsive to major stresses including drought, salt, and cold, suggesting that the BRX-like family may also function in abiotic stress responses. OsBRXL1 and OsBRXL4 were significantly up-regulated by brassinosteroid and auxin, respectively. To further test the function of BRX-like genes in rice, the OsBRXL4 was overexpressed in rice Zhonghua 11. The OsBRXL4-overexpression plant showed significantly longer root and increased sensitivity to auxin than wild type, suggesting that OsBRXL4 may be involved in primary root growth through the auxin signaling pathway.
NA	OsBRXL4 Regulates Shoot Gravitropism and Rice Tiller Angle through Affecting LAZY1 Nuclear Localization.	2019	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100039, China; Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Rice tiller angle is a key agronomic trait that contributes to ideal plant architecture and grain production. Our previous study showed that LAZY1 (LA1) controls tiller angle via affecting shoot gravitropism, but the molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we identified a LA1-interacting protein named Brevis Radix Like 4 (OsBRXL4). We showed that the interaction between OsBRXL4 and LA1 occurs at the plasma membrane and that their interaction determines LA1 nuclear localization. We found that LA1 nuclear localization is essential for LA1 function, which is different from AtLA1, the ortholog in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of OsBRXL4 leads to a prostrate growth phenotype, whereas OsBRXLs RNAi plants, in which the expression levels of OsBRXL1, OsBRXL4, and OsBRXL5 were decreased, display a compact phenotype. Further genetic evidence confirmed that OsBRXL4 controls rice tiller angle by affecting LA1 nuclear localization. Consistent with this, OsBRXL4 regulates the shoot gravitropism through affecting polar auxin transport as did LA1. Therefore, our study not only identifies OsBRXL4 as a regulatory component of rice tiller angle, but also provides a new insight into our understanding of rice plant architecture.
