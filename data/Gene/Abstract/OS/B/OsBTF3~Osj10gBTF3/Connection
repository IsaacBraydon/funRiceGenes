OsBTF3|Osj10gBTF3	OsPPR676|OsATP4	A Plastid-Localized Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein is Required for Both Pollen Development and Plant Growth in Rice	 In this study, OsPPR676 was confirmed to be an interacted protein with Osj10gBTF3, β-subunit of nascent polypeptide-associated complex (β-NAC), by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, indicating that both proteins are probably involved in the same regulatory pathway of pollen development
Hsp90|rHsp90|OSGrp94	OsBTF3|Osj10gBTF3	Osj10gBTF3-Mediated Import of Chloroplast Protein Is Essential for Pollen Development in Rice	 Here, we demonstrated that Osj10gBTF3, a NAC protein, regulates pollen and chloroplast development in rice by coordinating with a Hsp90 family chaperone OsHSP82 to mediate chloroplast import
Hsp90|rHsp90|OSGrp94	OsBTF3|Osj10gBTF3	Osj10gBTF3-Mediated Import of Chloroplast Protein Is Essential for Pollen Development in Rice	 Our results reveal a chaperone role of Osj10gBTF3 in chloroplast import different from Hsp90 and provide a link between chloroplast transport and pollen development in rice
OsBTF3|Osj10gBTF3	OsPPR676|OsATP4	Osj10gBTF3-Mediated Import of Chloroplast Protein Is Essential for Pollen Development in Rice	 Knockout of Osj10gBTF3 affects pollen and chloroplast development and significantly reduces the accumulation of fertility-related chloroplast protein OsPPR676
OsBTF3|Osj10gBTF3	OsPPR676|OsATP4	Osj10gBTF3-Mediated Import of Chloroplast Protein Is Essential for Pollen Development in Rice	 Both Osj10gBTF3 and OsHSP82 interact with OsPPR676
OsBTF3|Osj10gBTF3	OsPPR676|OsATP4	Osj10gBTF3-Mediated Import of Chloroplast Protein Is Essential for Pollen Development in Rice	 Interestingly, the interaction between OsHSP82 and OsPPR676 is only found in the cytoplasm, while the interaction between Osj10gBTF3 and OsPPR676 also occurs inside the chloroplast
OsBTF3|Osj10gBTF3	OsPPR676|OsATP4	Osj10gBTF3-Mediated Import of Chloroplast Protein Is Essential for Pollen Development in Rice	 Further investigation indicates that Osj10gBTF3 enters the chloroplast stroma possibly through the inner chloroplast membrane channel protein Tic110 and then recruits OsCpn60 for the folding or assembly of OsPPR676
