BTF3, which was originally recognized as a basal transcription factor, has been known to be involved in transcription initiation, translational regulation and protein localization in many eukaryotic organisms. However, its function remains largely unknown in plant species. In the present study, we analyzed a BTF3-related sequence in Oryza sativa L. subsp. japonica, which shares the conserved domain of a nascent polypeptide-associated complex with human BTF3, and was referred to as Osj10gBTF3. The expression of Osj10gBTF3 was primarily constitutive and generally modulated by salt, high temperature and exogenous phytohormone stress. The Osj10gBTF3::EGFP (enhanced green fluorescence protein) fusion protein was localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasmic membrane system. Inhibition of Osj10gBTF3 led to significant morphological changes in all detected tissues and organs, with a reduced size of between 25% and 52%. Furthermore, the pollen that developed was completely sterile, which was correlated with the altered expression of two Rf (fertility restorer)-like genes that encode pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins OsPPR676 and OsPPR920, translational initiation factors OseIF3e and OseIF3h, and the heat shock protein OsHSP82. These findings were verified through a yeast two-hybrid assay using a Nipponbare callus cDNA library as bait followed by the reverse transcription-PCR analysis of total leaf or anther RNAs. Our demonstration of the important role of Osj10gBTF3 in rice growth and development provides new insights showing that more complex regulatory functions are associated with BTF3 in plants.
NA	Osj10gBTF3-Mediated Import of Chloroplast Protein Is Essential for Pollen Development in Rice	2021	Front Plant Sci	Institute of Crop Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Chloroplasts are crucial organelles for the generation of fatty acids and starch required for plant development. Nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) proteins have been implicated in development as transcription factors. However, their chaperone roles in chloroplasts and their relationship with pollen development in plants remain to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that Osj10gBTF3, a NAC protein, regulates pollen and chloroplast development in rice by coordinating with a Hsp90 family chaperone OsHSP82 to mediate chloroplast import. Knockout of Osj10gBTF3 affects pollen and chloroplast development and significantly reduces the accumulation of fertility-related chloroplast protein OsPPR676. Both Osj10gBTF3 and OsHSP82 interact with OsPPR676. Interestingly, the interaction between OsHSP82 and OsPPR676 is only found in the cytoplasm, while the interaction between Osj10gBTF3 and OsPPR676 also occurs inside the chloroplast. The chloroplast stroma chaperone OsCpn60 can also be co-precipitated with Osj10gBTF3, but not with OsHSP82. Further investigation indicates that Osj10gBTF3 enters the chloroplast stroma possibly through the inner chloroplast membrane channel protein Tic110 and then recruits OsCpn60 for the folding or assembly of OsPPR676. Our results reveal a chaperone role of Osj10gBTF3 in chloroplast import different from Hsp90 and provide a link between chloroplast transport and pollen development in rice.
