NA	OsBSK1-2, an Orthologous of AtBSK1, Is Involved in Rice Immunity.	2017	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Key Laboratory of Major Crop Diseases &amp; Collaborative Innovation Center for Hybrid Rice in Yangtze River Basin, Sichuan Agricultural University at Wenjiang, ChengduChina.	The brassinosteroid-SIGNALING KINASE (BSK) belongs to the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase XII subgroup. BSK1 regulates development and immunity in Arabidopsis. However, the function of rice (Oryza sativa) BSK1 is largely unknown. Here, we report that the expression level of OsBSK1-2 is induced after a chitin or fagellin22 (flg22) treatment. Silencing OsBSK1-2 in rice results in compromised responses to or flg22-triggered immunity and resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae, but does not alter the plant&#39;s architecture nor reduce plant responses to brassinosteroid signaling. Our study reveals that OsBSK1-2 functions as a major regulator in rice plant immunity.
NA	BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE1-1, a positive regulator of brassinosteroid signalling, modulates plant architecture and grain size in rice.	2022	J Exp Bot	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a crucial class of plant hormones that regulate plant growth and development, thus affecting many important agronomic traits in crops. However, there are still significant gaps in our understanding of the BR signalling pathway in rice. In this study, we provide multiple lines of evidence to indicate that BR-SIGNALING KINASE1-1 (OsBSK1-1) likely represents a missing component in the BR signalling pathway in rice. We showed that knockout mutants of OsBSK1-1 are less sensitive to BR and exhibit a pleiotropic phenotype, including lower plant height, less tiller number and shortened grain length, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing a gain-of-function dominant mutant form of OsBSK1-1 (OsBSK1-1A295V) are hypersensitive to BR, and exhibit some enhanced BR-responsive phenotypes. We found that OsBSK1-1 physically interacts with the BR receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (OsBRI1), and GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE2 (OsGSK2), a downstream component crucial for BR signalling. Moreover, we showed that OsBSK1-1 can be phosphorylated by OsBRI1 and can inhibit OsGSK2-mediated phosphorylation of BRASSINOSTEROID RESISTANT1 (OsBZR1). We further demonstrated that OsBSK1-1 genetically acts downstream of OsBRI1, but upstream of OsGSK2. Together, our results suggest that OsBSK1-1 may serve as a scaffold protein directly bridging OsBRI1 and OsGSK2 to positively regulate BR signalling, thus affecting plant architecture and grain size in rice.
