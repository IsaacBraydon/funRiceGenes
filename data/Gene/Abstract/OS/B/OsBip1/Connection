OsBip1	OsBiP4	Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice	OsBiP1 is constitutively expressed in various tissues, whereas the expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 (OsBiP4&5) is not detected in any tissue under normal conditions
OsBip1	OsBiP4	Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice	However, expression of OsBiP4&5 was highly and specifically activated under ER stress conditions induced by DTT treatment, OsBiP1 knockdown, OsBiP1 overexpression, OsIRE1 overexpression, or various exogenous recombinant proteins in transgenic rice
OsBip1	OsBiP4	Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice	When the subcellular localization of OsBiP4&5 was investigated in seed endosperm cells under the ER stress condition, OsBiP4&5 were localized to the ER, but did not participate in ER-derived protein body (PB-I) formation in a different manner to OsBiP1
OsBip1	OsBiP4	Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice	Taken together, these results suggest that OsBiP4&5 are ER stress-related BiP proteins that are regulated by OsIRE1/OsbZIP50 pathway and that they may have a distinct function from that of OsBiP1 in rice

NEF|Fes1-like	OsBip1	OsFes1C, a potential nucleotide exchange factor for OsBiP1, is involved in the ER and salt stress responses 	 OsFes1C interacts directly with OsBiP1 and the interaction is inhibited by ATP but promoted by ADP, suggesting that OsFes1C acts as a potential NEF of OsBiP1 in vivo
OsBip1	OsbZIP60	OsbZIP60-mediated unfolded protein response regulates grain chalkiness in rice.	 Notably, the expression of unfolded protein response (UPR) genes, such as OsbZIP50, OsBiP1, OsBiP2 and OsBiP3, is up-regulated in the endosperm cells of osbzip60, and overexpression of all these UPR genes causes various degrees of chalkiness
OsBip1	OsbZIP60	OsbZIP60-mediated unfolded protein response regulates grain chalkiness in rice.	 Furthermore, OsbZIP60 is found to activate the expression of key genes related to grain chalkiness, such as GPA3, FSE1, FLO7, Chalk5, OsNF-YB1, and OsPK2, whose expression is significantly suppressed in osbzip60 and overexpression lines of OsbZIP50, OsBiP1, OsBiP2, and OsBiP3
