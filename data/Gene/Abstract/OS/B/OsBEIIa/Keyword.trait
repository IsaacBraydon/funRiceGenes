OsBEIIa	starch	Sugary Endosperm is Modulated by Starch Branching Enzyme IIa in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 CONCLUSIONS: Complementary interactions between the starch biosynthesis genes OsISA1 and OsBEIIa determine the mild sugary endosperm mutant, sugary-h, in rice
OsBEIIa	endosperm	Sugary Endosperm is Modulated by Starch Branching Enzyme IIa in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Complementation tests indicated that OsBEIIa regulated the properties of sugary endosperm
