NA	Sugary Endosperm is Modulated by Starch Branching Enzyme IIa in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Rice (N Y)	Department of Plant Science and Research Institute for Agriculture and Life Sciences, and Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, South Korea.	BACKGROUND: Starch biosynthesis is one of the most important pathways that determine both grain quality and yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Sugary endosperm, sugary-1 (sug-1), is a mutant trait for starch biosynthesis. Rice plants carrying sug-1 produce grains that accumulate water-soluble carbohydrates instead of starch, even after maturity. Although this trait enhances the diversity of grain quality, sugary endosperm rice has hardly been commercialized due to the severely wrinkled grains and subsequent problems in milling. This study was conducted to identify the genes responsible for the sug-h phenotype through a map-based cloning technology. RESULTS: We induced a mild sugary mutant, sugary-h (sug-h) through the chemical mutagenesis on the Korean japonica cultivar Hwacheong. Grains of the sug-h mutant were translucent and amber-colored, and the endosperm appeared less wrinkled than sug-1, whereas the soluble sugar content was fairly high. These characteristics confer greater marketability to the sug-h mutant. Genetic analyses indicated that the sug-h mutant phenotype was controlled by a complementary interaction of two recessive genes, Isoamylase1 (OsISA1), which was reported previously, and Starch branching enzyme IIa (OsBEIIa), which was newly identified in this study. Complementation tests indicated that OsBEIIa regulated the properties of sugary endosperm. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary interactions between the starch biosynthesis genes OsISA1 and OsBEIIa determine the mild sugary endosperm mutant, sugary-h, in rice. Our finding may facilitate the breeding of sugaryendosperm rice for commercial benefit.
NA	Relative importance of branching enzyme isoforms in determining starch fine structure and physicochemical properties of indica rice.	2021	Plant Mol Biol	Key Laboratory of Nuclear Agricultural Sciences of Ministry of Agriculture and Zhejiang Province, Institute of Nuclear Agricultural Sciences, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Zijingang Campus, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Down-regulation of starch branching enzymes alters fine structure and starch properties, especially the B-type crystalline pattern and extremely high amylose content identified in the BEIIb-deficiency mutant in the indica rice. The relative importance of the starch branching enzymes in determining the molecular fine structure and starch functional properties were uncovered in this study. An indica rice, Guangluai 4 with high amylose content (AC) and high gelatinization temperature (GT) was used to generate the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/associated protein-9 (Cas9) knockout lines. Five mutant lines were identified including be1-1, be1-2, be2a-1, be2a-2 and be2b-1, and analysis of western blot showed the CRISPR/Cas9 system was successful in inducing mutations in the targeted genes. AC of be2b-1 (34.1%) was greater than that of wild type (WT) (27.4%) and other mutants. Mutations of either BEI or BEIIa did not alter the starch crystallite pattern (A-type). The BEIIb deficiency caused an opaque endosperm to B-type, and dramatically increased the degree of ordered structure, the relative proportion of amylose chains and intermediate to long amylopectin chains, average chain length of amylopectin molecules as well as GT. The BEIIa deficiency had no effect on the proportion of amylose chains, the length of amylopectin intermediate-long chains, conclusion temperature and enthalpy of gelatinization. Down-regulation of BEI increased the proportion of shortest amylopectin chains (fa) but decreased the proportion of long amylopectin chains (fb2 and fb3), leading to a lower GT. It is concluded that the relative importance in determining starch fine structures and functionality was in the order of BEIIb &gt; BEI &gt; BEIIa. Our results provide new information for utilizations of BE-deficient mutants in rice quality breeding.
