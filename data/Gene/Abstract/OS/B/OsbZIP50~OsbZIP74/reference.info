A protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family oxidoreductase, PDIL2-3, is involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses in rice. We identified a critical cis-element required for induction of the ER stress response. The activation of PDIL2-3 in response to ER stress strongly depends on the IRE1-OsbZIP50 signaling pathway.
10.1007-s11741-009-0216-3.pdf	Genome-wide analysis of basic leucine zipper transcription factor families in Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Populus trichocarpa	2009	Journal of Shanghai University (English Edition)	School of Life Sciences, Shanghai University, Shanghai, 200444, P. R. China	The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors form a large gene family that is important in pathogen defense, light and stress signaling, etc. The Completed whole genome sequences of model plants Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa) constitute a valuable resource for genome-wide analysis and genomic comparative analysis, as they are representatives of the two major evolutionary lineages within the angiosperms: the monocotyledons and the dicotyledons. In this study, bioinformatics analysis identified 74, 89 and 88 bZIP genes respectively in Arabidopsis, rice and poplar. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of this gene family is presented, including the gene structure, phylogeny, chromosome distribution, conserved motifs. As a result, the plant bZIPs were organized into 10 subfamilies on basis of phylogenetic relationship. Gene duplication events during the family evolution history were also investigated. And it was further concluded that chromosomal/segmental duplication might have played a key role in gene expansion of bZIP gene family.
Hayashi-2012-Signal transduction.pdf	Signal transduction by IRE1-mediated splicing of bZIP50 and other stress sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response of rice	2012	Plant J	Genetically Modified Organism Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor IRE1 transduces signals by inducing the unconventional splicing of mRNAs encoding key transcription factors: HAC1 in yeast and XBP1 in animals. However, no HAC1 or XBP1 homologues have been found in plants, and until recently the substrate for plant IRE1 has remained unknown. This study demonstrates that the Oryza sativa (rice) OsbZIP50 transcription factor, an orthologue of Arabidopsis AtbZIP60, is regulated by IRE1-mediated splicing of its RNA. Despite the presence of a transcriptional activation domain, OsbZIP50 protein is not translocated into the nucleus efficiently in the absence of OsbZIP50 mRNA splicing. Unconventional splicing of OsbZIP50 mRNA causes a frame shift, which results in the appearance of a nuclear localization signal in the newly translated OsbZIP50. OsbZIP50 mRNA is spliced in a similar manner to HAC1 and XBP1 mRNAs; however, this splicing has very different effects on the translation products, a finding that shows the diversity of IRE1-related transcription factors in eukaryotes. In addition, the expression of OsbZIP50 is affected by ER stress sensor proteins OsIRE1, OsbZIP39 and OsbZIP60. ER stress-related genes differ with respect to their dependency on OsbZIP50 for their expression. The findings of this study improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the plant ER stress response.
Mol. Plant-2012-Lu-504-14.pdf	Conservation of IRE1-regulated bZIP74 mRNA unconventional splicing in rice (Oryza sativa L.) involved in ER stress responses	2012	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, China.	Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a fundamental process in plant cells that is vulnerable to many environmental stresses. When unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, the well-conserved unfolded protein response (UPR) is initiated to mitigate the ER stress by enhancing the protein folding capability and/or accelerating the ER-associated protein degradation. Here, we report the conservation of the activation mechanism of OsbZIP74 (also known as OsbZIP50), an important ER stress regulator in monocot plant rice (Oryza sativa L.). Under normal conditions, OsbZIP74 mRNA encodes a basic leucine-zipper transcription factor with a putative transmembrane domain. When treating with ER stress-inducing agents such as tunicamycin and DTT, the conserved double stem-loop structures of OsbZIP74 mRNA are spliced out. Thereafter, the resulting new OsbZIP74 mRNA produces the nucleus-localized form of OsbZIP74 protein, eliminating the hydrophobic region. The activated form of OsbZIP74 has transcriptional activation activity in both yeast cells and Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts. The induction of OsbZIP74 splicing is much suppressed in the OsIRE1 knock-down rice plants, indicating the involvement of OsIRE1 in OsbZIP74 splicing. We also demonstrate that the unconventional splicing of OsbZIP74 mRNA is associated with heat stress and salicylic acid, which is an important plant hormone in systemic acquired resistance against pathogen or parasite.
Nijhawan-2008-Genomic survey and g.pdf	Genomic survey and gene expression analysis of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family in rice	2008	Plant Physiol	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.	The basic leucine (Leu) zipper (bZIP) proteins compose a family of transcriptional regulators present exclusively in eukaryotes. The bZIP proteins characteristically harbor a bZIP domain composed of two structural features: a DNA-binding basic region and the Leu zipper dimerization region. They have been shown to regulate diverse plant-specific phenomena, including seed maturation and germination, floral induction and development, and photomorphogenesis, and are also involved in stress and hormone signaling. We have identified 89 bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Their chromosomal distribution and sequence analyses suggest that the bZIP transcription factor family has evolved via gene duplication. The phylogenetic relationship among rice bZIP domains as well as with bZIP domains from other plant bZIP factors suggests that homologous bZIP domains exist in plants. Similar intron/exon structural patterns were observed in the basic and hinge regions of their bZIP domains. Detailed sequence analysis has been done to identify additional conserved motifs outside the bZIP domain and to predict their DNA-binding site specificity as well as dimerization properties, which has helped classify them into different groups and subfamilies, respectively. Expression of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes has been analyzed by full-length cDNA and expressed sequence tag-based expression profiling. This expression profiling was complemented by microarray analysis. The results indicate specific or coexpression patterns of rice bZIP transcription factors starting from floral transition to various stages of panicle and seed development. bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice also displayed differential expression patterns in rice seedlings in response to abiotic stress and light irradiation. An effort has been made to link the structure and expression pattern of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice to their function, based on the information obtained from our analyses and earlier known results. This information will be important for functional characterization of bZIP transcription factors in rice.
srep00944.pdf	Multiple roles of the ER stress sensor IRE1 demonstrated by gene targeting in rice	2012	Sci Rep	Genetically Modified Organism Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences , Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor, IRE1, contains a kinase domain and a ribonuclease domain. Ribonuclease mediates the unconventional splicing of mRNA encoding the transcription factor AtbZIP60 in Arabidopsis, or OsbZIP50 in rice, and thereby transduces signals from stressed ER. Here, we demonstrate the additional roles of plant IRE1 using genetically modified rice plants. Using a gene targeting system based on homologous recombination, genomic IRE1 was replaced with two types of missense alleles, leading to a defect in the kinase or ribonuclease activity of IRE1. Genetic analysis of these alleles demonstrated that the kinase activity of IRE1 plays a vital role independent of ribonuclease activity. Furthermore, the existence of ribonuclease substrates other than OsbZIP50 mRNA is demonstrated for the first time. This study provides new insights into higher plant signalling using a gene targeting approach.
