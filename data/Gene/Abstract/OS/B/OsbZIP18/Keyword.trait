OsbZIP18	nitrogen	Natural variation in the OsbZIP18 promoter contributes to branched-chain amino acid levels in rice	 We further demonstrated that OsbZIP18 is strongly induced by nitrogen (N) deficiency and that N starvation results in enhanced BCAA levels in an OsbZIP18-dependent manner
OsbZIP18	transcription factor	OsbZIP18, a Positive Regulator of Serotonin Biosynthesis, Negatively Controls the UV-B Tolerance in Rice.	 Here, we identified the basic leucine zipper transcription factor OsbZIP18 as a positive regulator of serotonin biosynthesis in rice
OsbZIP18	growth	OsbZIP18, a Positive Regulator of Serotonin Biosynthesis, Negatively Controls the UV-B Tolerance in Rice.	 Overexpression of OsbZIP18 strongly induced the levels of serotonin and its early precursors (tryptophan and tryptamine), resulting in stunted growth and dark-brown phenotypes
OsbZIP18	serotonin biosynthesis	OsbZIP18, a Positive Regulator of Serotonin Biosynthesis, Negatively Controls the UV-B Tolerance in Rice	OsbZIP18, a Positive Regulator of Serotonin Biosynthesis, Negatively Controls the UV-B Tolerance in Rice
OsbZIP18	UV-B tolerance	OsbZIP18, a Positive Regulator of Serotonin Biosynthesis, Negatively Controls the UV-B Tolerance in Rice	OsbZIP18, a Positive Regulator of Serotonin Biosynthesis, Negatively Controls the UV-B Tolerance in Rice
