NA	Natural variation in the OsbZIP18 promoter contributes to branched-chain amino acid levels in rice	2020	Plant Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are essential amino acids that must be obtained from the diet for humans and animals, and they play important roles in various aspects of plant growth and development. Although BCAA biosynthetic pathways in higher plants have been uncovered, knowledge of their genetic control is still limited, and no positive regulators have been identified to date. Here, we showed that variation in BCAA levels in rice is attributable to differential transcription of OsbZIP18, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, due to polymorphisms in its promoter. Functional analysis revealed that OsbZIP18 positively regulates BCAA synthesis by binding directly to the ACE and C-box cis-elements in the promoters of the biosynthetic genes branched-chain aminotransferase1 (OsBCAT1) and OsBCAT2. We further demonstrated that OsbZIP18 is strongly induced by nitrogen (N) deficiency and that N starvation results in enhanced BCAA levels in an OsbZIP18-dependent manner. Overall, we identified OsbZIP18, a positive regulator of BCAA biosynthesis, which contributed to natural variation in BCAA levels and mediated BCAA accumulation through de novo synthesis by directly modulating the key biosynthetic genes OsBCAT1 and OsBCAT2.
NA	OsbZIP18, a Positive Regulator of Serotonin Biosynthesis, Negatively Controls the UV-B Tolerance in Rice.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	College of Tropical Crops, Hainan University, Haikou 570228, China.	Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) plays an important role in many developmental processes and biotic/abiotic stress responses in plants. Although serotonin biosynthetic pathways in plants have been uncovered, knowledge of the mechanisms of serotonin accumulation is still limited, and no regulators have been identified to date. Here, we identified the basic leucine zipper transcription factor OsbZIP18 as a positive regulator of serotonin biosynthesis in rice. Overexpression of OsbZIP18 strongly induced the levels of serotonin and its early precursors (tryptophan and tryptamine), resulting in stunted growth and dark-brown phenotypes. A function analysis showed that OsbZIP18 activated serotonin biosynthesis genes (including tryptophan decarboxylase 1 (OsTDC1), tryptophan decarboxylase 3 (OsTDC3), and tryptamine 5-hydroxylase (OsT5H)) by directly binding to the ACE-containing or G-box cis-elements in their promoters. Furthermore, we demonstrated that OsbZIP18 is induced by UV-B stress, and experiments using UV-B radiation showed that transgenic plants overexpressing OsbZIP18 exhibited UV-B stress-sensitive phenotypes. Besides, exogenous serotonin significantly exacerbates UV-B stress of OsbZIP18_OE plants, suggesting that the excessive accumulation of serotonin may be responsible for the sensitivity of OsbZIP18_OE plants to UV-B stress. Overall, we identified a positive regulator of serotonin biosynthesis and demonstrated that UV-B-stress induced serotonin accumulation, partly in an OsbZIP18-dependent manner.
