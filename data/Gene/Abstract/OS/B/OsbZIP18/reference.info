NA	Natural variation in the OsbZIP18 promoter contributes to branched-chain amino acid levels in rice	2020	Plant Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are essential amino acids that must be obtained from the diet for humans and animals, and they play important roles in various aspects of plant growth and development. Although BCAA biosynthetic pathways in higher plants have been uncovered, knowledge of their genetic control is still limited, and no positive regulators have been identified to date. Here, we showed that variation in BCAA levels in rice is attributable to differential transcription of OsbZIP18, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, due to polymorphisms in its promoter. Functional analysis revealed that OsbZIP18 positively regulates BCAA synthesis by binding directly to the ACE and C-box cis-elements in the promoters of the biosynthetic genes branched-chain aminotransferase1 (OsBCAT1) and OsBCAT2. We further demonstrated that OsbZIP18 is strongly induced by nitrogen (N) deficiency and that N starvation results in enhanced BCAA levels in an OsbZIP18-dependent manner. Overall, we identified OsbZIP18, a positive regulator of BCAA biosynthesis, which contributed to natural variation in BCAA levels and mediated BCAA accumulation through de novo synthesis by directly modulating the key biosynthetic genes OsBCAT1 and OsBCAT2.
