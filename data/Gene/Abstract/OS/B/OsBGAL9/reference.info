NA	SPOTTED-LEAF7 targets the gene encoding β-Galactosidase9, which functions in rice growth and stress responses.	2023	Plant Physiol	Graduate School of Green-Bio Science, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 17104, Korea.	β-Galactosidases (Bgals) remove terminal β-D-galactosyl residues from the non-reducing ends of β-D-galactosides and oligosaccharides. Bgals are present in bacteria, fungi, animals, and plants and have various functions. Despite many studies on the evolution of BGALs in plants, their functions remain obscure. Here, we identified rice (Oryza sativa) β-galactosidase9 (OsBGAL9) as a direct target of the heat stress-induced transcription factor SPOTTED-LEAF7 (OsSPL7), as demonstrated by protoplast transactivation analysis and yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Knockout plants for OsBGAL9 (Osbgal9) showed short stature and growth retardation. Histochemical ß-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis of transgenic lines harboring an OsBGAL9pro:GUS reporter construct revealed that OsBGAL9 is mainly expressed in internodes at the mature stage. OsBGAL9 expression was barely detectable in seedlings under normal conditions but increased in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Ectopic expression of OsBGAL9 enhanced resistance to the rice pathogens Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, as well as tolerance to cold and heat stress, while Osbgal9 mutant plants showed the opposite phenotypes. OsBGAL9 localized to the cell wall, suggesting that OsBGAL9 and its plant putative orthologs likely evolved functions distinct from those of its closely related animal enzymes. Enzyme activity assays and analysis of the cell wall composition of OsBGAL9 overexpression and mutant plants indicated that OsBGAL9 has activity toward galactose residues of arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs). Our study clearly demonstrates a role for a member of the BGAL family in AGP processing during plant development and stress responses.
