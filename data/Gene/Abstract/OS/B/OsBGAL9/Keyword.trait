OsBGAL9	seedlings	SPOTTED-LEAF7 targets the gene encoding β-Galactosidase9, which functions in rice growth and stress responses.	 OsBGAL9 expression was barely detectable in seedlings under normal conditions but increased in response to biotic and abiotic stresses
OsBGAL9	growth	SPOTTED-LEAF7 targets the gene encoding β-Galactosidase9, which functions in rice growth and stress responses.	 Knockout plants for OsBGAL9 (Osbgal9) showed short stature and growth retardation
OsBGAL9	resistance	SPOTTED-LEAF7 targets the gene encoding β-Galactosidase9, which functions in rice growth and stress responses.	 Ectopic expression of OsBGAL9 enhanced resistance to the rice pathogens Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv
OsBGAL9	tolerance	SPOTTED-LEAF7 targets the gene encoding β-Galactosidase9, which functions in rice growth and stress responses.	 oryzae, as well as tolerance to cold and heat stress, while Osbgal9 mutant plants showed the opposite phenotypes
OsBGAL9	abiotic stress	SPOTTED-LEAF7 targets the gene encoding β-Galactosidase9, which functions in rice growth and stress responses.	 OsBGAL9 expression was barely detectable in seedlings under normal conditions but increased in response to biotic and abiotic stresses
OsBGAL9	biotic stress	SPOTTED-LEAF7 targets the gene encoding β-Galactosidase9, which functions in rice growth and stress responses.	 OsBGAL9 expression was barely detectable in seedlings under normal conditions but increased in response to biotic and abiotic stresses
OsBGAL9	cold	SPOTTED-LEAF7 targets the gene encoding β-Galactosidase9, which functions in rice growth and stress responses.	 oryzae, as well as tolerance to cold and heat stress, while Osbgal9 mutant plants showed the opposite phenotypes
OsBGAL9	magnaporthe oryzae	SPOTTED-LEAF7 targets the gene encoding β-Galactosidase9, which functions in rice growth and stress responses.	 Ectopic expression of OsBGAL9 enhanced resistance to the rice pathogens Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv
OsBGAL9	cell wall	SPOTTED-LEAF7 targets the gene encoding β-Galactosidase9, which functions in rice growth and stress responses.	 OsBGAL9 localized to the cell wall, suggesting that OsBGAL9 and its plant putative orthologs likely evolved functions distinct from those of its closely related animal enzymes
OsBGAL9	cell wall	SPOTTED-LEAF7 targets the gene encoding β-Galactosidase9, which functions in rice growth and stress responses.	 Enzyme activity assays and analysis of the cell wall composition of OsBGAL9 overexpression and mutant plants indicated that OsBGAL9 has activity toward galactose residues of arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs)
OsBGAL9	heat stress	SPOTTED-LEAF7 targets the gene encoding β-Galactosidase9, which functions in rice growth and stress responses.	 oryzae, as well as tolerance to cold and heat stress, while Osbgal9 mutant plants showed the opposite phenotypes
OsBGAL9	Heat Stress	SPOTTED-LEAF7 targets the gene encoding β-Galactosidase9, which functions in rice growth and stress responses.	 oryzae, as well as tolerance to cold and heat stress, while Osbgal9 mutant plants showed the opposite phenotypes
