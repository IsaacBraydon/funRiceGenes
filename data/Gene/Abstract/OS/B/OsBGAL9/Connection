OsBGAL9	OsSPL7	SPOTTED-LEAF7 targets the gene encoding β-Galactosidase9, which functions in rice growth and stress responses.	 Here, we identified rice (Oryza sativa) β-galactosidase9 (OsBGAL9) as a direct target of the heat stress-induced transcription factor SPOTTED-LEAF7 (OsSPL7), as demonstrated by protoplast transactivation analysis and yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assays
