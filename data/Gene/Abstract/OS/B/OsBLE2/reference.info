Brassinosteroids (BRs) are growth-promoting natural substances required for normal plant growth and development. To understand the molecular mechanism of BR action, a cDNA microarray containing 1265 rice genes was analyzed for expression differences in rice lamina joint treated with brassinolide (BL). A novel BL-enhanced gene, designated OsBLE2, was identified and cloned. The full-length cDNA is 3243 bp long, encoding a predicted polypeptide of 761 amino acid residues and nine possible transmembrane regions. OsBLE2 expression was most responsive to BL in the lamina joint and leaf sheath in rice seedlings. Besides, auxin and gibberellins also increased its expression. OsBLE2 expressed more, as revealed by in situ hybridization, in vascular bundles and root primordia, where the cells are actively undergoing division, elongation, and differentiation. Transgenic rice expressing antisense OsBLE2 exhibits various degrees of repressed growth. BL could not enhance its expression in transgenic rice expressing antisense BRI1, a BR receptor, indicating that BR signaling to the enhanced expression of OsBLE2 is through BRI1. BL effect in the d1 mutant rice was much weaker than that in its wild-type control, indicating that heterotrimeric G protein may be a component of BRs signaling. These results suggest that OsBLE2 is involved in BL-regulated growth and development processes in rice.
