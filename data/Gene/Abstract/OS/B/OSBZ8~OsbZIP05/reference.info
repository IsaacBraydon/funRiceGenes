10.1007-s00299-007-0498-1.pdf	Trans-acting factor designated OSBZ8 interacts with both typical abscisic acid responsive elements as well as abscisic acid responsive element-like sequences in the vegetative tissues of indica rice cultivars	2008	Plant Cell Rep	Department of Botany, Bose Institute, Kolkata, 700009, West Bengal, India.	Specific cis-acting elements, identified in the stress-regulated promoters, can respond to the changes in the levels of abscisic acid. Most of our previous works were done with ACGT-containing typical abscisic acid responsive elements (ABREs) but not with non-ACGT, GC-rich sequences also present in such promoters. The current communication shows a comparative analysis performed on the binding of rice nuclear proteins, together with the purified transcription factor OSBZ8, to the cis-elements in the promoters of Rab16A (Motif I/Motif II), Osem (Motif A-1/Motif B) and Em (4X ABRE/2X ABRC). Our data show that the extent of binding of nuclear protein from salt-tolerant rice to both typical ABREs and non-ACGT, ABRE-like sequences such as Motif IIa, is much higher than that from salt-sensitive rice and occurs constitutively, i.e., even with the protein from unstressed plants. The complex formation is low and inducible only by salt in the salt-sensitive variety. While Motif I bind to a single 38 kDa protein, Motif IIa bind to two polypeptides of 38 and 29 kDa. We also show here that the activation and binding of OSBZ8 to the upstream regions of salt-inducible genes depends on its phosphorylated state. The novelty of our work is that it shows rice OSBZ8 as the prime factor interacting with both typical ABRE(s) and ABRE-like sequences. To our knowledge, this is also the first report for the detection and identification of Motif IIa (non-ACGT, coupling element-like)-binding factor(s) from rice and their expression pattern in different rice cultivars.
10.1007-s11738-012-0929-7.pdf	Spermidine-mediated in vitro phosphorylation of transcriptional regulator OSBZ8 by SNF1-type serine/threonine protein kinase SAPK4 homolog in indica rice	2012	Acta Physiologiae Plantarum	Division of Plant Biology, Bose Institute (Main Campus), 93/1 A.P.C Road, Kolkata, 700009, India	Plants respond to abiotic stresses such as salinity, extreme temperature and drought by the activation of complex intracellular signaling cascades that regulate acclimatory biochemical and physiological changes. Protein kinases are major signal transduction factors that play a central role in mediating acclimation to environmental changes in eukaryotic organisms. It is well known that changes in abiotic conditions such as the concentration of ions, temperature and humidity lead to modulation of polyamine contents in plants. However, little is known about the relevant part these polyamines play in abiotic stress responses. Here, we address a specific role of spermidine during high salt stress by studying its interaction with OSPDK, a sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase2 (SnRK2)-type serine/threonine protein kinase SAPK4 homolog in indica rice. In this report, we demonstrate that spermidine mediates in vitro phosphorylation of OSBZ8, a bZIP class of ABRE-binding transcription factor, by OSPDK. Our results give a first-hand indication of the pivotal role played by polyamines in abiotic stress cell signaling in plants.
1471-2229-6-18.pdf	An ABRE-binding factor, OSBZ8, is highly expressed in salt tolerant cultivars than in salt sensitive cultivars of indica rice	2006	BMC Plant Biol	Department of Botany, Bose Institute, 93/1 Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road, Kolkata 700 009, India. mkakali@yahoo.com	BACKGROUND: The bZIP class Abscisic acid Responsive Element (ABRE)-binding factor, OSBZ8 (38.5 kD) has been considered to regulate ABA-mediated transcription in the suspension cultured cells of japonica rice. Still, nothing is known about the expression of OSBZ8 at protein level in vegetative tissue of salt sensitive and salt tolerant rice plants. In our previous study, Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) of [32P]ABRE-DNA and nuclear extracts prepared from the lamina of Pokkali rice plants has detected the presence of an ABRE-binding factor. Northern analysis has also detected salinity stress induced accumulation of transcripts for bZIP class of factor. Therefore, OSBZ8 was considered to play an important role in the regulation of transcription in the vegetative tissue of rice. The aim of this study is to find out whether OSBZ8 has any role in regulating the NaCl-stress induced gene expression in vegetative tissue and whether the expression of OSBZ8 factor directly correlates with the stress tolerance of different varieties of indica type rice. RESULTS: Northern analysis of total RNA from roots and lamina of salt-sensitive M-I-48 and salt-tolerant Nonabokra, when probed with the N-terminal unique region of OSBZ8 (OSBZ8p, without the highly conserved basic region), a transcript of 1.3 kb hybridized and its level was much higher in tolerant cultivar. EMSA with Em1a, the strongest ABA Responsive Element till reported from the upstream of EmBP1, and the nuclear extracts from laminar tissue of untreated and salt-treated seedlings of three salt sensitive, one moderately sensitive and two salt tolerant indica rice cultivars showed specific binding of nuclear factor to ABRE element. Intensity of binding was low and inducible in salt sensitive rice cultivars while high and constitutive in salt tolerant cultivars. EMSA with 300 bp 5'upstream region of Rab16A gene, a well known salt stress and ABA-inducible gene of rice, showed formation of two complexes, again very weak in salt sensitive and strong in salt tolerant rice cultivar. CONCLUSION: The bZIP factor OSBZ8 was found to be present in the ABRE-DNA: protein complex as shown by the supershift of the complex by the purified antiserum raised against OSBZ8p. Treatment of the seedlings with NaCl was found to enhance the complex formation, suggesting the regulation of OSBZ8 gene at both transcriptional and post-translational steps. Comparative EMSA with different varieties of rice suggests a positive correlation with the expression pattern of OSBZ8 and salt tolerance in rice cultivars.
j.1365-313X.1996.09020217.x.pdf	A rice bZIP protein, designated OSBZ8, is rapidly induced by abscisic acid	1996	The Plant Journal	Center for Molecular Biology and Genetics, Mie University, Tsu, Japan.	A cDNA that encoded a bZIP protein, designated OSBZ8, was isolated from a rice embryo cDNA library by use of degenerate oligonucleotide probes that corresponded to the amino acid sequences conserved among the basic regions of plant G-box-binding factor-type bZIP proteins (GBF). OSBZ8 was shown to have structural features typical of the GBF-type bZIP proteins and to bind to G-box and G-box-like sequences that include ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) which have been functionally identified in the promoters of ABA-inducible genes, such as Em, Osem and Rab16. The accumulation of OSBZ8 mRNA was induced by treatment with ABA of imbibed mature rice embryos, of young plant tissues and of suspension-cultured cells. The accumulation of OSBZ8 mRNA in response to ABA preceded that of Osem and Rab16A mRNAs and was not inhibited by an inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide. By contrast, the induction of Osem and Rab16A was partially inhibited and almost completely inhibited, respectively, by cycloheximide. These results strongly suggest that OSBZ8 might be involved in the regulation of transcription by ABA in rice.
Nijhawan-2008-Genomic survey and g.pdf	Genomic survey and gene expression analysis of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family in rice	2008	Plant Physiol	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.	The basic leucine (Leu) zipper (bZIP) proteins compose a family of transcriptional regulators present exclusively in eukaryotes. The bZIP proteins characteristically harbor a bZIP domain composed of two structural features: a DNA-binding basic region and the Leu zipper dimerization region. They have been shown to regulate diverse plant-specific phenomena, including seed maturation and germination, floral induction and development, and photomorphogenesis, and are also involved in stress and hormone signaling. We have identified 89 bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Their chromosomal distribution and sequence analyses suggest that the bZIP transcription factor family has evolved via gene duplication. The phylogenetic relationship among rice bZIP domains as well as with bZIP domains from other plant bZIP factors suggests that homologous bZIP domains exist in plants. Similar intron/exon structural patterns were observed in the basic and hinge regions of their bZIP domains. Detailed sequence analysis has been done to identify additional conserved motifs outside the bZIP domain and to predict their DNA-binding site specificity as well as dimerization properties, which has helped classify them into different groups and subfamilies, respectively. Expression of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes has been analyzed by full-length cDNA and expressed sequence tag-based expression profiling. This expression profiling was complemented by microarray analysis. The results indicate specific or coexpression patterns of rice bZIP transcription factors starting from floral transition to various stages of panicle and seed development. bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice also displayed differential expression patterns in rice seedlings in response to abiotic stress and light irradiation. An effort has been made to link the structure and expression pattern of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice to their function, based on the information obtained from our analyses and earlier known results. This information will be important for functional characterization of bZIP transcription factors in rice.
NA	Comparative analysis of Histone modifications and DNA methylation at OsBZ8 locus under salinity stress in IR64 and Nonabokra rice varieties.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	Division of Plant Biology, Bose Institute, P 1/12 C.I.T. Scheme VII M, Kolkata, 700054, India.	Rice being an important cereal crop is highly sensitive to salinity stress causing growth retardation and loss in productivity. However, certain rice genotypes like Nonabokra and Pokkali show a high level of tolerance towards salinity stress compared to IR64 variety. This differential response of tolerant varieties towards salinity stress may be a cumulative effect of genetic and epigenetic factors. In this study, we have compared the salinity-induced changes in chromatin modifications at the OsBZ8 locus in salt-tolerant Nonabokra and salt-sensitive IR64 rice varieties. Expression analysis indicates that the OsBZ8 gene is highly induced in Nonabokra plants even in the absence of salt stress, whereas in IR64, the expression significantly increases only during salt stress. Sequence analysis and nucleosomal arrangement within the region -2000 to +1000 of OsBZ8 gene show no difference between the two rice varieties. However, there was a considerable difference in histone modifications and DNA methylation at the locus between these varieties. In Nonabokra, the upstream region was hyperacetylated at H3K9 and H3K27, and this acetylation did not change during salt stress. However, in IR64, histone acetylation was observed only during salt stress. Moreover, the upstream region of OsBZ8 gene has highly dynamic nucleosome arrangement in Nonabokra, compared to IR64. Furthermore, loss of DNA methylation was observed at OsBZ8 locus in Nonabokra control plants along with low H3K27me3 and high H3K4me3. Control IR64 plants show high DNA methylation and enriched H3K27me3. Collectively these results indicate a significant difference in chromatin modifications between the rice varieties that regulates differential expression of OsBZ8 gene during salt stress.
NA	OsWRKY28 positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice.	2022	Plant Cell Rep	Jilin Province Engineering Laboratory of Plant Genetic Improvement, College of Plant Science, Jilin University, Changchun, 130062, People&#x27;s Republic of China.	OsWRKY28 confers salinity tolerance by directly binding to OsDREB1B promoter and increasing its transcriptional activity, and negatively regulates abscisic acid mediated seedling establishment in rice. WRKY transcription factors have been reported to play a vital role in plants growth, development, abiotic and biotic stress responses. In this study, we explored the functions of a transcription factor OsWRKY28 in rice. The transcript level of OsWRKY28 was strikingly increased under drought, chilling, salt and abscisic acid treatments. The OsWRKY28 overexpression lines showed enhanced salinity stress tolerance, whereas the oswrky28 mutants displayed salt sensitivity compared to wild-type plants. Under salt stress treatment, the expression levels of OsbZIP05, OsHKT1;1 and OsDREB1B were significantly lower yet the level of OsHKT2;1 was significantly higher in oswrky28 mutants than those in wide type plants. Our data of yeast one-hybrid assay and dual-luciferase assay supported that OsWRKY28 could directly bind to the promoter of OsDREB1B to enhance salinity tolerance in rice. In addition, OsWRKY28 overexpression lines displayed hyposensitivity and the oswrky28 mutants showed hypersensitivity compared to wild-type plants under exogenous abscisic acid treatment. Based on the results of yeast two-hybrid assay and GAL4-dependent chimeric transactivation assay, OsWRKY28 physically interacts with OsMPK11 and its transcriptional activity could be regulated by OsMPK11. Together, OsWRKY28 confers salinity tolerance through directly targeting OsDREB1B promoter and further activating its transcription in rice.
