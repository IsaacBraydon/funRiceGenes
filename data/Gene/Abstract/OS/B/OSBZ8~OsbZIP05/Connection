OSBZ8|OsbZIP05	SAPK4|OSPDK	Spermidine-mediated in vitro phosphorylation of transcriptional regulator OSBZ8 by SNF1-type serine/threonine protein kinase SAPK4 homolog in indica rice	In this report, we demonstrate that spermidine mediates in vitro phosphorylation of OSBZ8, a bZIP class of ABRE-binding transcription factor, by OSPDK

OSBZ8|OsbZIP05	OsWRKY28	OsWRKY28 positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice.	 Under salt stress treatment, the expression levels of OsbZIP05, OsHKT1;1 and OsDREB1B were significantly lower yet the level of OsHKT2;1 was significantly higher in oswrky28 mutants than those in wide type plants
OSBZ8|OsbZIP05	OsDREB1B	OsWRKY28 positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice.	 Under salt stress treatment, the expression levels of OsbZIP05, OsHKT1;1 and OsDREB1B were significantly lower yet the level of OsHKT2;1 was significantly higher in oswrky28 mutants than those in wide type plants
OSBZ8|OsbZIP05	OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsWRKY28 positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice.	 Under salt stress treatment, the expression levels of OsbZIP05, OsHKT1;1 and OsDREB1B were significantly lower yet the level of OsHKT2;1 was significantly higher in oswrky28 mutants than those in wide type plants
OSBZ8|OsbZIP05	OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	OsWRKY28 positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice.	 Under salt stress treatment, the expression levels of OsbZIP05, OsHKT1;1 and OsDREB1B were significantly lower yet the level of OsHKT2;1 was significantly higher in oswrky28 mutants than those in wide type plants
OSBZ8|OsbZIP05	STK	Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase STK Confers Salt Tolerance in Rice.	 Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) suggested that four stress-related genes may be regulated by STK including OsABAR1, Os3BGlu6, OSBZ8 and OsSIK1
