OsBMY4	stress	Co-Overexpression of Two Key Source Genes, OsBMY4 and OsISA3, Improves Multiple Key Traits of Rice Seeds.	 Systematic analyses of the transgenic rice indicated that co-overexpression of OsBMY4 and OsISA3 not only promoted rice yield and quality, but also improved seed germination and stress tolerance
OsBMY4	seed	Co-Overexpression of Two Key Source Genes, OsBMY4 and OsISA3, Improves Multiple Key Traits of Rice Seeds.	 Systematic analyses of the transgenic rice indicated that co-overexpression of OsBMY4 and OsISA3 not only promoted rice yield and quality, but also improved seed germination and stress tolerance
OsBMY4	starch	Co-Overexpression of Two Key Source Genes, OsBMY4 and OsISA3, Improves Multiple Key Traits of Rice Seeds.	 In this study, OsBMY4 and OsISA3, the key β-amylase and debranching enzymes that control transient starch degradation in rice leaves, were co-overexpressed in rice in order to accelerate starch degradation efficiency and increase the sugar supply for sink organs
OsBMY4	quality	Co-Overexpression of Two Key Source Genes, OsBMY4 and OsISA3, Improves Multiple Key Traits of Rice Seeds.	 Moreover, since the OsBMY4 gene has not been characterized, we generated osbmy4 mutants using CRIPSR/Cas9 gene editing, which helped to reveal the roles of β-amylase in rice yield and quality
OsBMY4	seed germination	Co-Overexpression of Two Key Source Genes, OsBMY4 and OsISA3, Improves Multiple Key Traits of Rice Seeds.	 Systematic analyses of the transgenic rice indicated that co-overexpression of OsBMY4 and OsISA3 not only promoted rice yield and quality, but also improved seed germination and stress tolerance
OsBMY4	tolerance	Co-Overexpression of Two Key Source Genes, OsBMY4 and OsISA3, Improves Multiple Key Traits of Rice Seeds.	 Systematic analyses of the transgenic rice indicated that co-overexpression of OsBMY4 and OsISA3 not only promoted rice yield and quality, but also improved seed germination and stress tolerance
OsBMY4	yield	Co-Overexpression of Two Key Source Genes, OsBMY4 and OsISA3, Improves Multiple Key Traits of Rice Seeds.	 Systematic analyses of the transgenic rice indicated that co-overexpression of OsBMY4 and OsISA3 not only promoted rice yield and quality, but also improved seed germination and stress tolerance
OsBMY4	yield	Co-Overexpression of Two Key Source Genes, OsBMY4 and OsISA3, Improves Multiple Key Traits of Rice Seeds.	 Moreover, since the OsBMY4 gene has not been characterized, we generated osbmy4 mutants using CRIPSR/Cas9 gene editing, which helped to reveal the roles of β-amylase in rice yield and quality
OsBMY4	stress tolerance	Co-Overexpression of Two Key Source Genes, OsBMY4 and OsISA3, Improves Multiple Key Traits of Rice Seeds.	 Systematic analyses of the transgenic rice indicated that co-overexpression of OsBMY4 and OsISA3 not only promoted rice yield and quality, but also improved seed germination and stress tolerance
OsBMY4	sugar	Co-Overexpression of Two Key Source Genes, OsBMY4 and OsISA3, Improves Multiple Key Traits of Rice Seeds.	 In this study, OsBMY4 and OsISA3, the key β-amylase and debranching enzymes that control transient starch degradation in rice leaves, were co-overexpressed in rice in order to accelerate starch degradation efficiency and increase the sugar supply for sink organs
