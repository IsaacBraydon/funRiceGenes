Optimized source-sink interactions are determinants of both rice yield and quality. However, most source genes have not been well studied in rice, a major grain crop. In this study, OsBMY4 and OsISA3, the key β-amylase and debranching enzymes that control transient starch degradation in rice leaves, were co-overexpressed in rice in order to accelerate starch degradation efficiency and increase the sugar supply for sink organs. Systematic analyses of the transgenic rice indicated that co-overexpression of OsBMY4 and OsISA3 not only promoted rice yield and quality, but also improved seed germination and stress tolerance. Moreover, since the OsBMY4 gene has not been characterized, we generated osbmy4 mutants using CRIPSR/Cas9 gene editing, which helped to reveal the roles of β-amylase in rice yield and quality. This study demonstrated that specific modulation of the expression of some key source genes improves the source-sink balance and leads to improvements in multiple key traits of rice seeds.
