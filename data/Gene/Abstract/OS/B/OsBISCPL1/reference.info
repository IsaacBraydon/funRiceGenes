Serine carboxypeptidase-like proteins (SCPLs) comprise a large family of protein hydrolyzing enzymes that play roles in multiple cellular processes. During the course of study aimed at elucidating the molecular basis of induced immunity in rice, a gene, OsBISCPL1, encoding a putative SCPL, was isolated and identified. OsBISCPL1 contains a conserved peptidase S10 domain, serine active site and a signal peptide at N-terminus. OsBISCPL1 is expressed ubiquitously in rice, including roots, stems, leaves and spikes. Expression of OsBISCPL1 in leaves was significantly up-regulated after treatments with benzothiadiazole, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, and also up-regulated in incompatible interactions between rice and the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants with constitutive expression of OsBISCPL1 were generated and disease resistance assays indicated that the OsBISCPL1-overexpressing plants showed an enhanced disease resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and Alternaria brassicicola. Expression levels of defense-related genes, e.g. PR1, PR2, PR5 and PDF1.2, were constitutively up-regulated in transgenic plants as compared with those in wild-type plants. Furthermore, the OsBISCPL1-overexpressing plants also showed an increased tolerance to oxidative stress and up-regulated expression of oxidative stress-related genes. The results suggest that the OsBISCPL1 may be involved in regulation of defense responses against pathogen infection and oxidative stress.
