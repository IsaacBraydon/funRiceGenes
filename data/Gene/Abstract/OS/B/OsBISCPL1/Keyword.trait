OsBISCPL1	blast	A rice serine carboxypeptidase-like gene OsBISCPL1 is involved in regulation of defense responses against biotic and oxidative stress	Expression of OsBISCPL1 in leaves was significantly up-regulated after treatments with benzothiadiazole, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, and also up-regulated in incompatible interactions between rice and the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea
OsBISCPL1	oxidative	A rice serine carboxypeptidase-like gene OsBISCPL1 is involved in regulation of defense responses against biotic and oxidative stress	Furthermore, the OsBISCPL1-overexpressing plants also showed an increased tolerance to oxidative stress and up-regulated expression of oxidative stress-related genes
OsBISCPL1	oxidative	A rice serine carboxypeptidase-like gene OsBISCPL1 is involved in regulation of defense responses against biotic and oxidative stress	The results suggest that the OsBISCPL1 may be involved in regulation of defense responses against pathogen infection and oxidative stress
OsBISCPL1	oxidative	A rice serine carboxypeptidase-like gene OsBISCPL1 is involved in regulation of defense responses against biotic and oxidative stress	A rice serine carboxypeptidase-like gene OsBISCPL1 is involved in regulation of defense responses against biotic and oxidative stress
OsBISCPL1	stem	A rice serine carboxypeptidase-like gene OsBISCPL1 is involved in regulation of defense responses against biotic and oxidative stress	OsBISCPL1 is expressed ubiquitously in rice, including roots, stems, leaves and spikes
OsBISCPL1	disease	A rice serine carboxypeptidase-like gene OsBISCPL1 is involved in regulation of defense responses against biotic and oxidative stress	Transgenic Arabidopsis plants with constitutive expression of OsBISCPL1 were generated and disease resistance assays indicated that the OsBISCPL1-overexpressing plants showed an enhanced disease resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv
OsBISCPL1	jasmonic acid	A rice serine carboxypeptidase-like gene OsBISCPL1 is involved in regulation of defense responses against biotic and oxidative stress	Expression of OsBISCPL1 in leaves was significantly up-regulated after treatments with benzothiadiazole, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, and also up-regulated in incompatible interactions between rice and the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea
