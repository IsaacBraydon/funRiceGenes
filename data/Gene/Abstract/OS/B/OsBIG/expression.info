OsBIG	 Transgenic rice plants in which the expression of OsBIG was disrupted through the CRISPR/Cas9 system-mediated genome editing were used for phenotypic analysis |  Moreover, gene expression between Osbig/- and wild-type plants analyzed by RNA-seq indicates that a number of metabolic and hormonal pathways including ribosome, DNA replication, photosynthesis, and chlorophyll metabolism were significantly perturbed by OsBIG deficiency
