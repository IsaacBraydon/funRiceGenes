A rice diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) gene, OsBIDK1, which encodes a 499-amino acid protein, was cloned and characterized. OsBIDK1 contains a conserved DGK domain, consisting of a diacylglycerol kinase catalytic subdomain and a diacylglycerol kinase accessory subdomain. Expression of OsBIDK1 in rice seedlings was induced by treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical activator of the plant defense response, and by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, causal agent of blast disease. In BTH-treated rice seedlings, expression of OsBIDK1 was induced earlier and at a higher level than in water-treated control seedlings after inoculation with M. grisea. Transgenic tobacco plants that constitutively express the OsBIDK1 gene were generated and disease resistance assays showed that overexpression of OsBIDK1 in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in enhanced resistance against infection by tobacco mosaic virus and Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae. These results suggest that OsBIDK1 may play a role in disease resistance responses.
NA	Diacylglycerol Kinase and Associated Lipid Mediators Modulate Rice Root Architecture.	2019	New Phytol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) phosphorylates diacylglycerol (DAG) to generate phosphatidic acid (PA), and both DAG and PA are lipid mediators in the cell. Here we show that DGK1 in rice (Oryza sativa) plays important roles in root growth and development. Two independent OsDGK1-knockout (dgk1) lines exhibited a higher density of lateral roots (LR) and thinner seminal roots (SR), whereas OsDGK1-overexpressing plants displayed a lower LR density and thicker SR than wild-type (WT) plants. Overexpression of OsDGK1 led to a decline in the DGK substrate DAG whereas specific PA species decreased in dgk1 roots. Supplementation of DAG to OsDGK1-overexpressing seedlings restored the LR density and SR thickness whereas application of PA to dgk1 seedlings restored the LR density and SR thickness to those of WT. In addition, treatments of rice seedling with the DGK inhibitor R59022 increased the level of DAG and decreased PA, which also restored the root phenotype of OsDGK1-overexpressing seedlings close to that of WT. Taken together, these results indicate that DGK1 and associated lipid mediators modulate rice root architecture; DAG promotes LR formation and suppresses SR growth whereas PA suppresses LR number and promotes SR thickness.
