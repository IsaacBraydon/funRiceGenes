OsBIDK1	blast	Overexpression of a rice diacylglycerol kinase gene OsBIDK1 enhances disease resistance in transgenic tobacco	 Expression of OsBIDK1 in rice seedlings was induced by treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical activator of the plant defense response, and by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, causal agent of blast disease
OsBIDK1	defense	Overexpression of a rice diacylglycerol kinase gene OsBIDK1 enhances disease resistance in transgenic tobacco	" Expression of OsBIDK1 in rice seedlings was induced by treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical activator of the plant defense response, and by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, causal agent of blast disease"
OsBIDK1	disease	Overexpression of a rice diacylglycerol kinase gene OsBIDK1 enhances disease resistance in transgenic tobacco	 Expression of OsBIDK1 in rice seedlings was induced by treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical activator of the plant defense response, and by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, causal agent of blast disease| Transgenic tobacco plants that constitutively express the OsBIDK1 gene were generated and disease resistance assays showed that overexpression of OsBIDK1 in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in enhanced resistance against infection by tobacco mosaic virus and Phytophthora parasitica var| These results suggest that OsBIDK1 may play a role in disease resistance responses|Overexpression of a rice diacylglycerol kinase gene OsBIDK1 enhances disease resistance in transgenic tobacco
