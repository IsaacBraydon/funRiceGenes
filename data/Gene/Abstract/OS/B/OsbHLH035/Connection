OsABA2	OsbHLH035|OsbHLH35	The transcription factor OsbHLH035 mediates seed germination and enables seedling recovery from salt stress through ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways, respectively.	 In parallel, abscisic acid (ABA) contents are over-accumulated, and the expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes OsABA2 and OsAAO3 is upregulated; furthermore, compared with that in wild-type (WT) seedlings, the salt-induced expression of OsABA8ox1, an ABA catabolic gene, in germinating Osbhlh035 mutant seeds is downregulated
