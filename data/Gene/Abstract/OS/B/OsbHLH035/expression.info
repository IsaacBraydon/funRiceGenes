OsbHLH035	 The expression of OsbHLH035 is induced by drought and salinity |  Stable expression of GFP-fused OsbHLH035 in rice transgenic plants revealed that this protein is predominantly localized to the nucleus |  In parallel, abscisic acid (ABA) contents are over-accumulated, and the expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes OsABA2 and OsAAO3 is upregulated; furthermore, compared with that in wild-type (WT) seedlings, the salt-induced expression of OsABA8ox1, an ABA catabolic gene, in germinating Osbhlh035 mutant seeds is downregulated |  Additionally, the expression of the sodium transporters OsHKT1;3 and 1;5 is reduced in Osbhlh035 aerial and terrestrial tissues, respectively
