NA	The transcription factor OsbHLH035 mediates seed germination and enables seedling recovery from salt stress through ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways, respectively.	2018	Rice (N Y)	Department of Agronomy, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Section 4, Roosevelt Road, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.	Many transcription factors (TFs), such as those in the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family, are important for regulating plant growth and plant responses to abiotic stress. The expression of OsbHLH035 is induced by drought and salinity. However, its functional role in rice growth, development, and the salt response is still unknown.The bHLH TF OsbHLH035 is a salt-induced gene that is primarily expressed in germinating seeds and seedlings. Stable expression of GFP-fused OsbHLH035 in rice transgenic plants revealed that this protein is predominantly localized to the nucleus. Osbhlh035 mutants show delayed seed germination, particularly under salt-stress conditions. In parallel, abscisic acid (ABA) contents are over-accumulated, and the expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes OsABA2 and OsAAO3 is upregulated; furthermore, compared with that in wild-type (WT) seedlings, the salt-induced expression of OsABA8ox1, an ABA catabolic gene, in germinating Osbhlh035 mutant seeds is downregulated. Moreover, Osbhlh035 mutant seedlings are unable to recover from salt-stress treatment. Consistently, sodium is over-accumulated in aerial tissues but slightly reduced in terrestrial tissues from Osbhlh035 seedlings after salt treatment. Additionally, the expression of the sodium transporters OsHKT1;3 and 1;5 is reduced in Osbhlh035 aerial and terrestrial tissues, respectively. Furthermore, genetic complementation can restore both the delayed seed germination and the impaired recovery of salt-treated Osbhlh035 seedlings to normal growth.OsbHLH035 mediates seed germination and seedling recovery after salt stress relief through the ABA-dependent and ABA-independent activation of OsHKT pathways, respectively.
NA	Tightly controlled expression of OsbHLH35 is critical for anther development in rice	2021	Plant Sci	Programa de P¨®s-graduao em Gen¨¦tica e Biologia Molecular, Departamento de Gen¨¦tica, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, 91509-900, RS, Brazil. Electronic address: francieliortolan7@gmail.com.	Anther development is a complex process regulated by a myriad of transcription factors belonging to distinct protein families. In this study, we focus on the functional characterization of OsbHLH35, a basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) TF that regulates anther development in rice. Plants overexpressing OsbHLH35 presented small and curved anthers, leading to a reduction of 72 % on seed production. Rice transgenic plants expressing GUS reporter gene under the control of OsbHLH35 promoter (pOsbHLH35::GUS) showed that this TF specifically accumulates in anthers at the meiosis stage and in other spikelet tissues. Yeast one-hybrid screening identified three members of the Growth-Regulating Factor (GRF) family, OsGRF3, OsGRF4, and OsGRF11, as transcriptional regulators of OsbHLH35. Transactivation assay showed that OsGRF11 negatively regulates OsbHLH35 expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts. This regulation was also observed in planta through the analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsGRF11 (OsGRF11OE), confirming that OsGRF11 is a negative regulator of OsbHLH35 in rice. Our data suggest that OsbHLH35 plays an essential role in anther development in rice and the fine control of its expression is crucial to ensure proper seed production.
