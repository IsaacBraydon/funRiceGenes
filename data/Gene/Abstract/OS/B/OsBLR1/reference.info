NA	The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor OsBLR1 regulates leaf angle in rice via brassinosteroid signalling.	2020	Plant Mol Biol	College of Agronomy, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 450002, Henan, China.	Leaf angle is a key factor in plant architecture and crop yield. Brassinosteroids (BRs) regulate many developmental processes, especially the leaf angle in monocots. However, the BR signalling pathway is complex and includes many unknown members. Here, we propose that Oryza sativa BRASSINOSTEROID-RESPONSIVE LEAF ANGLE REGULATOR 1 (OsBLR1) encodes a bHLH transcription factor, and positively regulates BR signalling to increase the leaf angle and grain length in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Lines overexpressing OsBLR1 (blr1-D and BLR1-OE-1/2/3) had similar traits, with increased leaf angle and grain length. Conversely, OsBLR1-knockout mutants (blr1-1/2/3) had erect leaves and shorter grains. Lamina joint inclination, coleoptile elongation, and root elongation assay results indicated that these overexpression lines were more sensitive to BR, while the knockout mutants were less sensitive. There was no significant difference in the endogenous BR contents of blr1-1/2 and wild-type plants. These results suggest that OsBLR1 is involved in BR signal transduction. The blr1-D mutant, with increased cell growth in the lamina joint and smaller leaf midrib, showed significant changes in gene expression related to the cell wall and leaf development compared with wild-type plants; furthermore, the cellulose and protopectin contents in blr1-D were reduced, which resulted in the increased leaf angle and bent leaves. As the potential downstream target gene of OsBLR1, the REGULATOR OF LEAF INCLINATION1 (OsRLI1) gene expression was up-regulated in OsBLR1-overexpression lines and down-regulated in OsBLR1-knockout mutants. Moreover, we screened OsRACK1A as an interaction protein of OsBLR1 using a yeast two-hybrid assay and glutathione-S-transferase pull-down.
NA	The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix 79 (OsbHLH079) Determines Leaf Angle and Grain Shape.	2020	Int J Mol Sci	Department of Plant Science, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea.	Changes in plant architecture, such as leaf size, leaf shape, leaf angle, plant height, and floral organs, have been major factors in improving the yield of cereal crops. Moreover, changes in grain size and weight can also increase yield. Therefore, screens for additional factors affecting plant architecture and grain morphology may enable additional improvements in yield. Among the basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factors in rice (Oryza sativa), we found an enhancer-trap T-DNA insertion mutant of OsbHLH079 (termed osbhlh079-D). The osbhlh079-D mutant showed a wide leaf angle phenotype and produced long grains, similar to the phenotypes of mutants with increased brassinosteroid (BR) levels or enhanced BR signaling. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis showed that BR signaling-associated genes are largely upregulated in osbhlh079-D, but BR biosynthesis-associated genes are not upregulated, compared with its parental japonica cultivar 'Dongjin'. Consistent with this, osbhlh079-D was hypersensitive to BR treatment. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the expansion of cell size in the adaxial side of the lamina joint was responsible for the increase in leaf angle in osbhlh079-D. The expression of cell-elongation-associated genes encoding expansins and xyloglucan endotransglycosylases/hydrolases increased in the lamina joints of leaves in osbhlh079-D. The regulatory function of OsbHLH079 was further confirmed by analyzing 35S::OsbHLH079 overexpression and 35S::RNAi-OsbHLH079 gene silencing lines. The 35S::OsbHLH079 plants showed similar phenotypes to osbhlh079-D, and the 35S::RNAi-OsbHLH079 plants displayed opposite phenotypes to osbhlh079-D. Taking these observations together, we propose that OsbHLH079 functions as a positive regulator of BR signaling in rice.
