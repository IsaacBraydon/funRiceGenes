OsBLR1|OsbHLH079	grain	The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor OsBLR1 regulates leaf angle in rice via brassinosteroid signalling.	 Lines overexpressing OsBLR1 (blr1-D and BLR1-OE-1/2/3) had similar traits, with increased leaf angle and grain length
OsBLR1|OsbHLH079	grain length	The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor OsBLR1 regulates leaf angle in rice via brassinosteroid signalling.	 Lines overexpressing OsBLR1 (blr1-D and BLR1-OE-1/2/3) had similar traits, with increased leaf angle and grain length
OsBLR1|OsbHLH079	brassinosteroid	The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor OsBLR1 regulates leaf angle in rice via brassinosteroid signalling.	The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor OsBLR1 regulates leaf angle in rice via brassinosteroid signalling.
OsBLR1|OsbHLH079	 BR 	The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor OsBLR1 regulates leaf angle in rice via brassinosteroid signalling.	 These results suggest that OsBLR1 is involved in BR signal transduction
OsBLR1|OsbHLH079	Brassinosteroid	The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor OsBLR1 regulates leaf angle in rice via brassinosteroid signalling.	The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor OsBLR1 regulates leaf angle in rice via brassinosteroid signalling.
OsBLR1|OsbHLH079	signal transduction	The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor OsBLR1 regulates leaf angle in rice via brassinosteroid signalling.	 These results suggest that OsBLR1 is involved in BR signal transduction
