OsBP-73	leaf	OsBP-73, a rice gene, encodes a novel DNA-binding protein with a SAP-like domain and its genetic interference by double-stranded RNA inhibits rice growth	 Northern blot analysis demonstrated that OsBP-73 is weakly expressed in root, leaf and immature seed
OsBP-73	growth	OsBP-73, a rice gene, encodes a novel DNA-binding protein with a SAP-like domain and its genetic interference by double-stranded RNA inhibits rice growth	 Genetic interference of OsBP-73 gene expression by double-stranded RNA strikingly inhibits the whole plant growth but does not affect the passage from the juvenile to adult phase|OsBP-73, a rice gene, encodes a novel DNA-binding protein with a SAP-like domain and its genetic interference by double-stranded RNA inhibits rice growth
OsBP-73	seed	OsBP-73, a rice gene, encodes a novel DNA-binding protein with a SAP-like domain and its genetic interference by double-stranded RNA inhibits rice growth	 Northern blot analysis demonstrated that OsBP-73 is weakly expressed in root, leaf and immature seed
OsBP-73	root	OsBP-73, a rice gene, encodes a novel DNA-binding protein with a SAP-like domain and its genetic interference by double-stranded RNA inhibits rice growth	 Northern blot analysis demonstrated that OsBP-73 is weakly expressed in root, leaf and immature seed
