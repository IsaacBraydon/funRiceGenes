goodman-095.pdf	Up-regulation of OsBIHD1, a rice gene encoding BELL homeodomain transcriptional factor, in disease resistance responses	2005	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Institute of Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, PR China.	In the present study, we cloned and identified a full-length cDNA of a rice gene, OsBIHD1, encoding a homeodomain type transcriptional factor. OsBIHD1 is predicted to encode a 642 amino acid protein and the deduced protein sequence of OsBIHD1 contains all conserved domains, a homeodomain, a BELL domain, a SKY box, and a VSLTLGL box, which are characteristics of the BELL type homedomain proteins. The recombinant OsBIHD1 protein expressed in Escherichia coli bound to the TGTCA motif that is the characteristic cis-element DNA sequence of the homeodomain transcriptional factors. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that the OsBIHD1 protein localized in the nucleus of the plant cells. The OsBIHD1 gene was mapped to chromosome 3 of the rice genome and is a single-copy gene with four exons and three introns. Northern blot analysis showed that expression of OsBIHD1 was activated upon treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), which is capable of inducing disease resistance. Expression of OsBIHD1 was also up-regulated rapidly during the first 6 h after inoculation with Magnaporthe grisea in BTH-treated rice seedlings and during the incompatible interaction between M. grisea and a resistant genotype. These results suggest that OsBIHD1 is a BELL type of homeodomain transcription factor present in the nucleus, whose induction is associated with resistance response in rice.
J. Exp. Bot.-2005-Luo-2673-82.pdf	Overexpression in transgenic tobacco reveals different roles for the rice homeodomain gene OsBIHD1 in biotic and abiotic stress responses	2005	J Exp Bot	Institute of Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310029, PR China.	The rice OsBIHD1 gene encodes a transcriptional factor belonging to the homeodomain class. It had previously been shown to be activated by treatment with benzothiadiazole, a chemical inducer of disease resistance, and in an incompatible interaction between rice and the blast fungus. To allow a better understanding of the function of OsBIHD1 in plant disease resistance response, the OsBIHD1 gene in tobacco was overexpressed by Agrobacterium-mediated leaf disc transformation with a construct containing the OsBIHD1 ORF under control of the 35S promoter. Overexpression of the rice OsBIHD1 gene in some of the transgenic tobacco lines led to some morphological abnormalities in the top buds and roots. The transgenic tobacco plants showed an elevated level of defence-related PR-1 gene expression and enhanced disease resistance against infection by tomato mosaic virus, tobacco mosaic virus, and Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae. However, the transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsBIHD1 showed enhanced sensitivity to salt and oxidative stress as compared with the wild-type plants. The results suggested that the OsBIHD1 protein may be positively involved in activating expression of the defence-related genes in disease resistance responses, and is also important in rice development and abiotic stress tolerance.
NA	NBS-LRR Protein Pik-H4 Interacts with OsBIHD1 to Balance Rice Blast Resistance and Growth by Coordinating Ethylene-Brassinosteroid Pathway.	2017	Front Plant Sci	National Engineering Research Center of Plant Space Breeding, South China Agricultural University Guangzhou, China.	The regulation of innate immunity and plant growth, along with the trade-off between them, affects the defense and recovery mechanisms of the plant after it is attacked by pathogens. Although it is known that hormonal crosstalk plays a major role in regulating interaction of plant growth and PAMP-triggered immunity, the relationship between plant growth and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) remains unclear. In a large-scale yeast two-hybrid screening for Pik-H4-interacting proteins, a homeodomain transcription factor OsBIHD1 was identified, which is previously known to function in biotic and abiotic stress responses. The knockout of OsBIHD1 in rice lines carrying Pik-H4 largely compromised the resistance of the rice lines to Magnaporthe oryzae, the fungus that causes rice blast. While overexpression of OsBIHD1 resulted in enhanced expression of the pathogenesis-related (PR) and ethylene (ET) synthesis genes. Moreover, OsBIHD1 was also found to directly bind to the promoter region of ethylene-synthesis enzyme OsACO3. In addition, OsBIHD1 overexpression or deficiency provoked dwarfism and reduced brassinosteroid (BR) insensitivity through repressing the expression of several critical genes involved in BR biosynthesis and BR signaling. During M. oryzae infection, transcript levels of the crucial BR catabolic genes (CYP734A2, CYP734A4, and CYP734A6) were significantly up-regulated in OsBIHD1-OX plants. Furthermore, OsBIHD1 was found to be capable of binding to the sequence-specific cis-elements on the promoters of CYP734A2 to suppress the plant growth under fungal invasion. Our results collectively suggest a model that OsBIHD1 is required for Pik-H4-mediated blast resistance through modulating the trade-off between resistance and growth by coordinating brassinosteroid-ethylene pathway.
