OsBRCA2	OsDMC1|DMC1B|OsDMC1B	Rice OsBRCA2 Is Required for DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Meiotic Cells	 In the absence of OsBRCA2, localization to the meiotic chromosome axes of the strand-invasion proteins OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 is severely reduced and in vitro OsBRCA2 directly interacts with OsRAD51 and OsDMC1
OsBRCA2	OsDMC1|DMC1B|OsDMC1B	Rice OsBRCA2 Is Required for DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Meiotic Cells	 These results indicate that OsBRCA2 is essential for facilitating the loading of OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 onto resected ends of programmed double-strand breaks (DSB) during meiosis to promote single-end invasions of homologous chromosomes and accurate recombination
