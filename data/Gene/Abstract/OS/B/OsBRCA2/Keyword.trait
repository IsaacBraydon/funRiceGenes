OsBRCA2	growth	Rice OsBRCA2 Is Required for DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Meiotic Cells	 Osbrca2 mutant plants exhibit normal vegetative growth but experience complete male and female sterility as a consequence of severe meiotic defects
OsBRCA2	sterility	Rice OsBRCA2 Is Required for DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Meiotic Cells	 Osbrca2 mutant plants exhibit normal vegetative growth but experience complete male and female sterility as a consequence of severe meiotic defects
OsBRCA2	vegetative	Rice OsBRCA2 Is Required for DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Meiotic Cells	 Osbrca2 mutant plants exhibit normal vegetative growth but experience complete male and female sterility as a consequence of severe meiotic defects
OsBRCA2	meiosis	Rice OsBRCA2 Is Required for DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Meiotic Cells	 These results indicate that OsBRCA2 is essential for facilitating the loading of OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 onto resected ends of programmed double-strand breaks (DSB) during meiosis to promote single-end invasions of homologous chromosomes and accurate recombination
OsBRCA2	meiotic	Rice OsBRCA2 Is Required for DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Meiotic Cells	Rice OsBRCA2 Is Required for DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Meiotic Cells
OsBRCA2	meiotic	Rice OsBRCA2 Is Required for DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Meiotic Cells	 Osbrca2 mutant plants exhibit normal vegetative growth but experience complete male and female sterility as a consequence of severe meiotic defects
OsBRCA2	meiotic	Rice OsBRCA2 Is Required for DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Meiotic Cells	 In the absence of OsBRCA2, localization to the meiotic chromosome axes of the strand-invasion proteins OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 is severely reduced and in vitro OsBRCA2 directly interacts with OsRAD51 and OsDMC1
OsBRCA2	male sterility	Rice OsBRCA2 Is Required for DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Meiotic Cells	 Osbrca2 mutant plants exhibit normal vegetative growth but experience complete male and female sterility as a consequence of severe meiotic defects
