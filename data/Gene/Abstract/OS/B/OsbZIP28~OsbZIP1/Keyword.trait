OsbZIP28|OsbZIP1	root	Identification of a novel rice bZIP-type transcription factor gene,OsbZIP1, involved in response to infection ofMagnaporthe grisea	 Northern blotting analysis showed thatOsbZIP1 was constitutively expressed in the roots and strongly induced in rice leaves in response to infection with both the compatible race MS220 and incompatible race 131 ofM
OsbZIP28|OsbZIP1	salicylic acid	Identification of a novel rice bZIP-type transcription factor gene,OsbZIP1, involved in response to infection ofMagnaporthe grisea	 Furthermore, OsbZIP1 expression could be rapidly induced in leaves treated with salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid
OsbZIP28|OsbZIP1	salicylic acid	Identification of a novel rice bZIP-type transcription factor gene,OsbZIP1, involved in response to infection ofMagnaporthe grisea	 These results indicate that the OsbZIP1 may function as a transcription factor and may play a role in salicylic acid-dependent signal transduction pathway for defense of rice against pathogens
OsbZIP28|OsbZIP1	jasmonic	Identification of a novel rice bZIP-type transcription factor gene,OsbZIP1, involved in response to infection ofMagnaporthe grisea	 Furthermore, OsbZIP1 expression could be rapidly induced in leaves treated with salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid
OsbZIP28|OsbZIP1	jasmonic acid	Identification of a novel rice bZIP-type transcription factor gene,OsbZIP1, involved in response to infection ofMagnaporthe grisea	 Furthermore, OsbZIP1 expression could be rapidly induced in leaves treated with salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid
OsbZIP28|OsbZIP1	transcription factor	Identification of a novel rice bZIP-type transcription factor gene,OsbZIP1, involved in response to infection ofMagnaporthe grisea	 These results indicate that the OsbZIP1 may function as a transcription factor and may play a role in salicylic acid-dependent signal transduction pathway for defense of rice against pathogens
OsbZIP28|OsbZIP1	transcription factor	Identification of a novel rice bZIP-type transcription factor gene,OsbZIP1, involved in response to infection ofMagnaporthe grisea	Identification of a novel rice bZIP-type transcription factor gene,OsbZIP1, involved in response to infection ofMagnaporthe grisea
OsbZIP28|OsbZIP1	defense	"Identification of a novel rice bZIP-type transcription factor gene,OsbZIP1, involved in response to infection ofMagnaporthe grisea"	 These results indicate that the OsbZIP1 may function as a transcription factor and may play a role in salicylic acid-dependent signal transduction pathway for defense of rice against pathogens
