NA	OsbHLH057 targets the AATCA cis-element to regulate disease resistance and drought tolerance in rice.	2022	Plant Cell Rep	State Key Laboratory of Crop Biology, College of Agronomy, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai&#x27;an 271018, China.	The AATCA motif was identified to respond pathogens infection in the promoter of defense-related gene Os2H16. OsbHLH057 bound to the motif to positively regulate rice disease resistance and drought tolerance. Sheath blight (ShB), caused by the necrotrophic fungus Rhizoctonia solani, is a devastating disease in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The transcriptional regulation of host defense-related genes in response to R. solani infection is poorly understood. In this study, we identified a cis-element, AATCA, in the promoter of Os2H16, a previously identified multifaceted defense-related gene in rice that responded to fungal attack. Using a DNA pull-down assay coupled with mass spectrometry, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor OsbHLH057 was determined to interact with the AATCA cis-element. OsbHLH057 was rapidly induced by R. solani, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), and osmotic stress. Furthermore, overexpressing OsbHLH057 enhanced rice disease resistance and drought tolerance, while knocking out OsbHLH057 made rice more susceptible to pathogens and drought. Overall, our results uncovered an OsbHLH057 and AATCA module that synergistically regulates the expression of Os2H16 in response to R. solani, Xoo, and drought in conjunction with the previously identified stress-related OsASR2 and GT-1 module.
NA	bHLH57 confers chilling tolerance and grain yield improvement in rice.	2022	Plant Cell Environ	Hunan Province Key Laboratory of Crop Sterile Germplasm Resource Innovation and Application, College of Life Sciences, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China.	Chilling stress has become a major limiting factor that reduces crop productivity worldwide. In this study, we identified a new gene bHLH57, whose product enhances chilling tolerance in rice at diverse developmental stages. bHLH57 was mainly expressed in leaves and anthers, and its protein was targeted to the nucleus. Overexpression of bHLH57 enhanced chilling tolerance by increasing trehalose synthesis, whereas its mutants by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis were more sensitive to chilling and had reduced trehalose. Meanwhile, bHLH57 may regulate dependent pathways in response to chilling stress. In addition, the overexpression of bHLH57 resulted in increased grain yield under normal and chilling conditions, however, the disruption of bHLH57 displayed decreased grain size and seed setting rate, thus reduced grain yield. Phylogenetic and nucleotide diversity analyses suggested that bHLH57 is relatively conserved in monocotyledons, and may be selected during indica populations adaptation. Taken together, we have identified a new bHLH regulator involved rice chilling tolerance and grain yield, and provide a potential target gene for improving chilling tolerance and grain yield of rice.
NA	The bHLH Transcription Factor OsbHLH057 Regulates Iron Homeostasis in Rice.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Many basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factors precisely regulate the expression of Fe uptake and translocation genes to control iron (Fe) homeostasis, as both Fe deficiency and toxicity impair plant growth and development. In rice, three clade IVc bHLH transcription factors have been characterised as positively regulating Fe-deficiency response genes. However, the function of OsbHLH057, another clade IVc bHLH transcription factor, in regulating Fe homeostasis is unknown. Here, we report that OsbHLH057 is involved in regulating Fe homeostasis in rice. OsbHLH057 was highly expressed in the leaf blades and lowly expressed in the roots; it was mainly expressed in the stele and highly expressed in the lateral roots. In addition, OsbHLH057 was slightly induced by Fe deficiency in the shoots on the first day but was not affected by Fe availability in the roots. OsbHLH057 localised in the nucleus exhibited transcriptional activation activity. Under Fe-sufficient conditions, OsbHLH057 knockout or overexpression lines increased or decreased the shoot Fe concentration and the expression of several Fe homeostasis-related genes, respectively. Under Fe-deficient conditions, plants with an OsbHLH057 mutation showed susceptibility to Fe deficiency and accumulated lower Fe concentrations in the shoot compared with the wild type. Unexpectedly, the OsbHLH057-overexpressing lines had reduced tolerance to Fe deficiency. These results indicate that OsbHLH057 plays a positive role in regulating Fe homeostasis, at least under Fe-sufficient conditions.
