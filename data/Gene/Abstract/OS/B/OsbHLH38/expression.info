OsbHLH38	 Comprehensive functional analyses using knockout and overexpression transgenic lines revealed that OsbHLH38 expression was responsive to multiple abiotic stresses |  Overexpression of OsbHLH38 increased seedling salt tolerance, while knockout of OsbHLH38 increased sensitivity to salt stress |  Moreover, OsbHLH38 affected rice abiotic stress tolerance by mediating the expression of a large set of transporter genes of phytohormones, transcription factor genes, and many downstream genes with diverse functions, including photosynthesis, redox homeostasis, and abiotic stress responsiveness	 Comprehensive functional analyses using knockout and overexpression transgenic lines revealed that OsbHLH38 expression was responsive to multiple abiotic stresses |  Overexpression of OsbHLH38 increased seedling salt tolerance, while knockout of OsbHLH38 increased sensitivity to salt stress
