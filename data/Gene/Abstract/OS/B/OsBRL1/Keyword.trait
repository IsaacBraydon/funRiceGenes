OsBRL1	 BR 	The role of OsBRI1 and its homologous genes, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, in rice	In addition, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3 are at least partly involved in BR perception in the roots
OsBRL1	shoot	The role of OsBRI1 and its homologous genes, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, in rice	The homologous genes for OsBRI1, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, were highly expressed in roots but weakly expressed in shoots, and their expression was higher in d61-4 than in the wild type

OsBRL1	root	The role of OsBRI1 and its homologous genes, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, in rice	In addition, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3 are at least partly involved in BR perception in the roots
