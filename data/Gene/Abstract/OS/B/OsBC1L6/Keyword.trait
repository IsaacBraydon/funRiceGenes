OsBC1L6	seed	Oryza sativa Brittle Culm 1-like 6 modulates β-glucan levels in the endosperm cell wall.	 These findings suggest that OsBC1L6 modulates β-glucan synthesis during endosperm cell wall formation by interacting with cellulose moieties on the plasma membrane during seed ripening
OsBC1L6	cellulose	Oryza sativa Brittle Culm 1-like 6 modulates β-glucan levels in the endosperm cell wall.	 These findings suggest that OsBC1L6 modulates β-glucan synthesis during endosperm cell wall formation by interacting with cellulose moieties on the plasma membrane during seed ripening
OsBC1L6	cell wall	Oryza sativa Brittle Culm 1-like 6 modulates β-glucan levels in the endosperm cell wall.	 These findings suggest that OsBC1L6 modulates β-glucan synthesis during endosperm cell wall formation by interacting with cellulose moieties on the plasma membrane during seed ripening
OsBC1L6	endosperm	Oryza sativa Brittle Culm 1-like 6 modulates β-glucan levels in the endosperm cell wall.	 OsBC1L6 mRNA was expressed in ripening seeds during endosperm enlargement
OsBC1L6	endosperm	Oryza sativa Brittle Culm 1-like 6 modulates β-glucan levels in the endosperm cell wall.	 These findings suggest that OsBC1L6 modulates β-glucan synthesis during endosperm cell wall formation by interacting with cellulose moieties on the plasma membrane during seed ripening
OsBC1L6	plasma membrane	Oryza sativa Brittle Culm 1-like 6 modulates β-glucan levels in the endosperm cell wall.	 These findings suggest that OsBC1L6 modulates β-glucan synthesis during endosperm cell wall formation by interacting with cellulose moieties on the plasma membrane during seed ripening
