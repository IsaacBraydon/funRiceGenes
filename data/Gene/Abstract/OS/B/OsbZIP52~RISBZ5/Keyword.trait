OsbZIP52|RISBZ5	temperature	bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP52/RISBZ5: a potential negative regulator of cold and drought stress response in rice	" Expression of the OsbZIP52 gene was strongly induced by low temperature (4 degrees C) but not by drought, PEG, salt, or ABA"
OsbZIP52|RISBZ5	panicle	bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP52/RISBZ5: a potential negative regulator of cold and drought stress response in rice	OsbZIP52/RISBZ5 is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor (TF) family in rice (Oryza sativa) isolated from rice (Zhonghua11) panicles
OsbZIP52|RISBZ5	drought	bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP52/RISBZ5: a potential negative regulator of cold and drought stress response in rice	" Expression of the OsbZIP52 gene was strongly induced by low temperature (4 degrees C) but not by drought, PEG, salt, or ABA| Rice plants overexpressing OsbZIP52 showed significantly increased sensitivity to cold and drought stress| These results suggest that OsbZIP52/RISBZ5 could function as a negative regulator in cold and drought stress environments|bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP52/RISBZ5: a potential negative regulator of cold and drought stress response in rice"
