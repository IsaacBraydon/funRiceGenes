OsBGal2	seedling	Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)	 The two genes were found to be relatively highly expressed in seedling roots and shoots and in leaf sheath in 15~30-day-old plants, which contained major immunoreactive proteins of approximately 90 kDa for OsBGal1 protein and 55 kDa for OsBGal2 in extracts of these tissues
OsBGal2	root	Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)	 The two genes were found to be relatively highly expressed in seedling roots and shoots and in leaf sheath in 15~30-day-old plants, which contained major immunoreactive proteins of approximately 90 kDa for OsBGal1 protein and 55 kDa for OsBGal2 in extracts of these tissues
OsBGal2	panicle	Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)	 The genes encoding two isoforms of β-galactosidase expressed in germinating rice and panicle, designated OsBGal1 and OsBGal2, were cloned and sequenced
OsBGal2	panicle	Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)	 The related OsBGal2 clone from panicle at flowering stage encodes 715 amino acid residues, including a signal peptide of 20 residues
OsBGal2	shoot	Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)	 The two genes were found to be relatively highly expressed in seedling roots and shoots and in leaf sheath in 15~30-day-old plants, which contained major immunoreactive proteins of approximately 90 kDa for OsBGal1 protein and 55 kDa for OsBGal2 in extracts of these tissues

OsBGal2	flower	Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)	 Both were also expressed at low levels in flowers and immature seeds, but only the OsBGal2 transcript was found in mature seeds
OsBGal2	seed	Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)	 The two genes were found to be relatively highly expressed in seedling roots and shoots and in leaf sheath in 15~30-day-old plants, which contained major immunoreactive proteins of approximately 90 kDa for OsBGal1 protein and 55 kDa for OsBGal2 in extracts of these tissues
