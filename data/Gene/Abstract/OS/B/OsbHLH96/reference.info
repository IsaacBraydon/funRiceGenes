NA	OsHLH61-OsbHLH96 influences rice defense to brown planthopper through regulating the pathogen-related genes.	2019	Rice	Key Laboratory of Insect Developmental and Evolutionary Biology, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200032, China.	BACKGROUND: In plants, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins form the largest transcription factor (TF) family. Among them, HLH proteins are a small group of atypical members that lack the basic domain, and form dimers with bHLH proteins. Although bHLH proteins have been proved to play important roles in plant development and physiology, the function of HLH proteins is rarely studied, not to mention in plant biotic resistance. Brown planthopper (BPH) is a kind of rice-specific insect that causes devastating yield losses each year.  RESULTS: In this study, we identified OsHLH61 gene that encodes HLH protein. OsHLH61 gene could be highly induced by BPH infestation. Furthermore, Methyl Jasmonic acid (Me-JA) and cis-12-oxo- phytodienoic acid (OPDA) induced expression of OsHLH61, while SA repressed it. We knocked down expression of OsHLH61 by RNA interference (RNAi), the transgenic plants were susceptible to BPH infestation. RNA-seq analysis revealed that some pathogen-related (PR) genes in the Salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway that mediate plant immunity were obviously down-regulated in the OsHLH61 RNAi plants. Meanwhile, yeast two-hybrid assay and bimolecular luciferase complementation (BiLC) analysis identified bHLH096 to be an interacting factor of OsHLH61. Also, some PR genes were down-regulated in the OsbHLH96 over expressing lines. Expression of OsbHLH96 was inhibited. Besides, OsbHLH96 might interact with Jasmonate Zim-Domain3 (OsJAZ3).  CONCLUSION: Altogether, we identified an OsHLH61-OsbHLH96 complex that might mediate defense to BPH through regulating PR genes. And OsHLH61-OsbHLH96 might be important in mediating SA and JA signaling crosstalk.
NA	Loss-of-function mutations of OsbHLH044 transcription factor lead to salinity sensitivity and a greater chalkiness in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2022	Plant Physiol Biochem	Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Crop Germplasm, College of Agriculture &amp; Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	The most hazardous abiotic stress, salinity, restricted the world crop production, and grain chalkiness affected the grain quality to limit consumers&#x27; acceptance. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins modulate massive biological processes in plants. Here the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing mutants were obtained to detect the function of OsbHLH044. The loss-of-function of OsbHLH044 mutants showed numerous altered plant phenotypes. Notably, the osbhlh044 mutants resulted in prominently reduced morphological and physiological parameters under salt stress. Lower antioxidant activities and higher lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) accumulation in the osbhlh044 mutants caused salinity sensitivity due to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under salt stress, both shoots and roots of the osbhlh044 mutants acquired higher Na(+). Moreover, the expression of ion homeostasis-related genes (OsHKTs, OsHAK, OsSOSs, and OsNHX) and ABA-responsive gene (OsLEA3) was significantly altered in the osbhlh044 mutants after salt stress. The expression levels of genes coding for starch (OsAGPL1, OsSSIIa, OsWx, and OsFLO2) and seed storage proteins (GluA1 and Globulin 1) were significantly decreased, indicating that they synthesize less store starch and proteins, resulting in grain chalkiness in the osbhlh044 (OsHKT1;3, OsHAK7, OsSOS1, OsSOS2, OsNHX2, and OsLEA3 but not OsHKT2;1), and starch-related genes (OsSSIIa, OsWx, and OsFLO2) by binding to the G-boxes of their promoters. Therefore, the OsbHLH044 gene editing mutants revealed multiple functions, specifically a positive regulator of salt stress and grain quality, which might bring new insights into the breeding of rice varieties.
