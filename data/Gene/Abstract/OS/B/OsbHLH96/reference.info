BACKGROUND: In plants, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins form the largest transcription factor (TF) family. Among them, HLH proteins are a small group of atypical members that lack the basic domain, and form dimers with bHLH proteins. Although bHLH proteins have been proved to play important roles in plant development and physiology, the function of HLH proteins is rarely studied, not to mention in plant biotic resistance. Brown planthopper (BPH) is a kind of rice-specific insect that causes devastating yield losses each year.  RESULTS: In this study, we identified OsHLH61 gene that encodes HLH protein. OsHLH61 gene could be highly induced by BPH infestation. Furthermore, Methyl Jasmonic acid (Me-JA) and cis-12-oxo- phytodienoic acid (OPDA) induced expression of OsHLH61, while SA repressed it. We knocked down expression of OsHLH61 by RNA interference (RNAi), the transgenic plants were susceptible to BPH infestation. RNA-seq analysis revealed that some pathogen-related (PR) genes in the Salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway that mediate plant immunity were obviously down-regulated in the OsHLH61 RNAi plants. Meanwhile, yeast two-hybrid assay and bimolecular luciferase complementation (BiLC) analysis identified bHLH096 to be an interacting factor of OsHLH61. Also, some PR genes were down-regulated in the OsbHLH96 over expressing lines. Expression of OsbHLH96 was inhibited. Besides, OsbHLH96 might interact with Jasmonate Zim-Domain3 (OsJAZ3).  CONCLUSION: Altogether, we identified an OsHLH61-OsbHLH96 complex that might mediate defense to BPH through regulating PR genes. And OsHLH61-OsbHLH96 might be important in mediating SA and JA signaling crosstalk.
