OsbHLH96	 Expression of OsbHLH96 was inhibited
OsbHLH96|OsbHLH044	 Moreover, the expression of ion homeostasis-related genes (OsHKTs, OsHAK, OsSOSs, and OsNHX) and ABA-responsive gene (OsLEA3) was significantly altered in the osbhlh044 mutants after salt stress |  The expression levels of genes coding for starch (OsAGPL1, OsSSIIa, OsWx, and OsFLO2) and seed storage proteins (GluA1 and Globulin 1) were significantly decreased, indicating that they synthesize less store starch and proteins, resulting in grain chalkiness in the osbhlh044 (OsHKT1;3, OsHAK7, OsSOS1, OsSOS2, OsNHX2, and OsLEA3 but not OsHKT2;1), and starch-related genes (OsSSIIa, OsWx, and OsFLO2) by binding to the G-boxes of their promoters
