Although rice (Oryza sativa L.) produces little glycine betaine (GB), it has two betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH; EC 1.2.1.8) gene homologs (OsBADH1 and OsBADH2). We found that OsBADH1 catalyzes the oxidation of acetaldehyde efficiently, while the activity of OsBADH2 is extremely low. The accumulation of OsBADH1 mRNA decreases following submergence treatment, but quickly recovers after re-aeration. We confirmed that OsBADH1 localizes in peroxisomes. In this paper, a possible physiological function of OsBADH1 in the oxidation of acetaldehyde produced by catalase in rice plant peroxisomes is discussed.

Fragrance rice (Oryza sativa) contains two isoforms of BADH, named OsBADH1 and OsBADH2. OsBADH1 is implicated in acetaldehyde oxidation in rice plant peroxisomes, while the non-functional OsBADH2 is believed to be involved in the accumulation of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, the major compound of aroma in fragrance rice. In the present study, site-directed mutagenesis, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies were used to investigate the substrate specificity towards Bet-ald and GAB-ald. Consistent with our previous study, kinetics data indicated that the enzymes catalyze the oxidation of GAB-ald more efficiently than Bet-ald and the OsBADH1 W172F and OsBADH2 W170F mutants displayed a higher catalytic efficiency towards GAB-ald. Molecular docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulations for the first time provided models for aldehyde substrate-bound complexes of OsBADHs. The amino acid residues, E262, L263, C296 and W461 of OsBADH1 and E260, L261, C294 and W459 of OsBADH2 located within 5 A of the OsBADH active site mainly interacted with GAB-ald forming strong hydrogen bonds in both OsBADH isoforms. Residues W163, N164, Q294, C296 and F397 of OsBADH1-Bet-ald and Y163, M167, W170, E260, S295 and C453 of OsBADH2-Bet-ald formed the main interaction sites while E260 showed an interaction energy of -14.21 kcal/mol. Unconserved A290 in OsBADH1 and W288 in OsBADH2 appeared to be important for substrate recognition similar to that observed in PsAMADHs. Overall, the results here help to explain how two homologous rice BADHs recognize the aldehyde substrate differently, a key property to their biological role.

Japonica rice (salt-sensitive) was genetically engineered to enhance salt tolerance by introducing the OsBADH1 gene from Indica rice (salt-tolerant), which is a GB accumulator. We produced transgenic rice plants overexpressing the modified OsBADH1 gene under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter. The transgenic rice showed increased OsBADH1 gene expression and OsBADH1 enzyme production, resulting in the accumulation of GB. It also exhibited enhanced salt tolerance in immature and mature transgenic rice seedlings. The adverse effect of salt stress on seed germination, the growth of immature and mature seedlings, water status, and photosynthetic pigments was alleviated in transgenic seedlings.
hastanasombut_4_7_2011_400_407.pdf	Expression of OsBADH1 gene in Indica rice (Oryza sativaL.) in correlation with salt, plasmolysis, temperature and light stresses 	2011	Plant Omics	Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Rama VI Road, Bangkok 10400, Thailand 	The relationship between environmental factors, salt tolerant and the expression of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) gene, salt stress related gene, was investigated in Indica rice. The expression was observed in various rice cultivars as well as under different environmental conditions. Northern blot analysis revealed that salt-tolerant in each rice cultivar is correlated to the expression level of OsBADH1 mRNA. The expression studies showed that OsBADH1 can be induced by a variety of environmental factors such as salinity, drought, cold, heat, light intensity and CO2 concentration. The results demonstrated that the OsBADH1 mRNA expression was up-regulated by salinity, drought, cold and high light intensity but down-regulated by CO2 enrichment and heat stress. The primary response of OsBADH1 gene expression was induced within 24 h after salinity, cold or drought stress treatment. Moreover, these results suggest that the expression of OsBADH1 gene in response to salt stress could be magnified under high light conditions. Interestingly, the effect of salt stress on the expression of OsBADH1 gene was alleviated by CO2 enrichment. This report showed that BADH1 gene not only plays role in the response of indica rice to salt stress but also to plasmolysis, temperature and light stresses. Therefore, BADH1 gene might involve in multifunctional mechanisms in response to environmental stresses of indica rice.

Rice (Oryza sativa) has two betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase homologs, BAD1 and BAD2, encoded on chromosome four and chromosome eight respectively. BAD2 is responsible for the characteristic aroma of fragrant rice. Complementary DNA clones of both BAD1 and BAD2 were isolated and expressed in E. coli. BAD2 had optimum activity at pH 10, little to no affinity towards N-acetyl-gamma-aminobutyraldehyde (NAGABald) with a Km of approximately 10 mM and moderate affinity towards gamma-guanidinobutyraldehyde (GGBald) and betaine aldehyde (bet-ald) with Km values of approximately 260 microM and 63 microM respectively. A lower Km of approximately 9 microM was observed with gamma-aminobutyraldehyde (GABald), suggesting BAD2 has a higher affinity towards this substate in vivo. The enzyme encoded on chromosome four, BAD1, had optimum activity at pH 9.5, showed little to no affinity towards bet-ald with a Km of 3 mM and had moderate affinity towards GGBald, NAGABald and GABald with Km values of approximately 545, 420 and 497 microM respectively. BAD1 had a half life roughly double that of BAD2. We discuss the implications of these findings on the pathway of fragrance generation in Basmati and Jasmine rice and the potential of rice to accumulate the osmoprotectant glycine betaine.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs11816-009-0123-6.pdf	Expression of Indica rice OsBADH1 gene under salinity stress in transgenic tobacco	2009	Plant Biotechnology Reports	Laboratory of Plant Cell Technology, Graduate School of Horticulture, Chiba University, 648 Matsudo, Matsudo City, Chiba, 271-8510, Japan	Glycine betaine has been reported as an osmoprotectant compound conferring tolerance to salinity and osmotic stresses in plants. We previously found that the expression of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 gene (OsBADH1), encoding a key enzyme for glycine betaine biosynthesis pathway, showed close correlation with salt tolerance of rice. In this study, the expression of the OsBADH1 gene in transgenic tobacco was investigated in response to salt stress using a transgenic approach. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing the OsBADH1 gene were generated under the control of a promoter from the maize ubiquitin gene. Three homozygous lines of T2 progenies with single transgene insert were chosen for gene expression analysis. RT-PCR and western blot analysis results indicated that the OsBADH1 gene was effectively expressed in transgenic tobacco leading to the accumulation of glycine betaine. Transgenic lines demonstrated normal seed germination and morphology, and normal growth rates of seedlings under salt stress conditions. These results suggest that the OsBADH1 gene could be an excellent candidate for producing plants with osmotic stress tolerance.
NA	RNAi-directed downregulation of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (OsBADH1) results in decreased stress tolerance and increased oxidative markers without affecting glycine betaine biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa).	2014	Plant Mol Biol	Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Bio-resource and Eco-environment, State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, College of Life Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.	As an important osmoprotectant, glycine betaine (GB) plays an essential role in resistance to abiotic stress in a variety of organisms, including rice (Oryza sativa L.). However, GB content is too low to be detectable in rice, although rice genome possesses several orthologs coding for betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) involved in plant GB biosynthesis. Rice BADH1 (OsBADH1) has been shown to be targeted to peroxisome and its overexpression resulted in increased GB biosynthesis and tolerance to abiotic stress. In this study, we demonstrated a pivotal role of OsBADH1 in stress tolerance without altering GB biosynthesis capacity, using the RNA interference (RNAi) technique. OsBADH1 was ubiquitously expressed in different organs, including roots, stems, leaves and flowers. Transgenic rice lines downregulating OsBADH1 exhibited remarkably reduced tolerance to NaCl, drought and cold stresses. The decrease of stress tolerance occurring in the OsBADH1-RNAi repression lines was associated with an elevated level of malondialdehyde content and hydrogen peroxidation. No GB accumulation was detected in transgene-positive and transgene-negative lines derived from heterozygous transgenic T0 plants. Moreover, transgenic OsBADH1-RNAi repression lines showed significantly reduced seed set and yield. In conclusion, the downregulation of OsBADH1, even though not causing any change of GB content, was accounted for the reduction of ability to dehydrogenate the accumulating metabolism-derived aldehydes and subsequently resulted in decreased stress tolerance and crop productivity. These results suggest that OsBADH1 possesses an enzyme activity to catalyze other aldehydes in addition to betaine aldehyde (the precursor of GB) and thus alleviate their toxic effects under abiotic stresses.
