BAD1|OsBADH1	OsBADH2|fgr	OsBADH1 is possibly involved in acetaldehyde oxidation in rice plant peroxisomes	8) gene homologs (OsBADH1 and OsBADH2)
BAD1|OsBADH1	OsBADH2|fgr	OsBADH1 is possibly involved in acetaldehyde oxidation in rice plant peroxisomes	We found that OsBADH1 catalyzes the oxidation of acetaldehyde efficiently, while the activity of OsBADH2 is extremely low
BAD1|OsBADH1	OsBADH2|fgr	Dissecting substrate specificity of two rice BADH isoforms: Enzyme kinetics, docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies	Fragrance rice (Oryza sativa) contains two isoforms of BADH, named OsBADH1 and OsBADH2
BAD1|OsBADH1	OsBADH2|fgr	Dissecting substrate specificity of two rice BADH isoforms: Enzyme kinetics, docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies	OsBADH1 is implicated in acetaldehyde oxidation in rice plant peroxisomes, while the non-functional OsBADH2 is believed to be involved in the accumulation of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, the major compound of aroma in fragrance rice
BAD1|OsBADH1	OsBADH2|fgr	Dissecting substrate specificity of two rice BADH isoforms: Enzyme kinetics, docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies	Consistent with our previous study, kinetics data indicated that the enzymes catalyze the oxidation of GAB-ald more efficiently than Bet-ald and the OsBADH1 W172F and OsBADH2 W170F mutants displayed a higher catalytic efficiency towards GAB-ald
BAD1|OsBADH1	OsBADH2|fgr	Dissecting substrate specificity of two rice BADH isoforms: Enzyme kinetics, docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies	The amino acid residues, E262, L263, C296 and W461 of OsBADH1 and E260, L261, C294 and W459 of OsBADH2 located within 5 A of the OsBADH active site mainly interacted with GAB-ald forming strong hydrogen bonds in both OsBADH isoforms
BAD1|OsBADH1	OsBADH2|fgr	Dissecting substrate specificity of two rice BADH isoforms: Enzyme kinetics, docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies	Residues W163, N164, Q294, C296 and F397 of OsBADH1-Bet-ald and Y163, M167, W170, E260, S295 and C453 of OsBADH2-Bet-ald formed the main interaction sites while E260 showed an interaction energy of -14
BAD1|OsBADH1	OsBADH2|fgr	Dissecting substrate specificity of two rice BADH isoforms: Enzyme kinetics, docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies	Unconserved A290 in OsBADH1 and W288 in OsBADH2 appeared to be important for substrate recognition similar to that observed in PsAMADHs
