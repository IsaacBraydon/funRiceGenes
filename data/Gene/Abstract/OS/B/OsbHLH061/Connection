OsbHLH061	OsIRO2|OsbHLH056	OsbHLH061 links TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED repressor proteins with POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 to maintain iron homeostasis in rice.	 Mechanistically, OsbHLH061 expression is upregulated by high Fe, and physically interacts with OsPRI1, the OsbHLH061-OsPRI1 complex recruits TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED (OsTPL/TPR) co-repressors to repress OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 expression
OsbHLH061	OsIRO3|OsOsbHLH063	OsbHLH061 links TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED repressor proteins with POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 to maintain iron homeostasis in rice.	 Mechanistically, OsbHLH061 expression is upregulated by high Fe, and physically interacts with OsPRI1, the OsbHLH061-OsPRI1 complex recruits TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED (OsTPL/TPR) co-repressors to repress OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 expression
OsbHLH061	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	OsbHLH061 links TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED repressor proteins with POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 to maintain iron homeostasis in rice.	 The bHLH transcription factor OsbHLH061 interacts with OsPRI1, and this study used molecular, genetics, biochemical and physiological approaches to functionally characterise OsbHLH061 and how it affects Fe homeostasis
