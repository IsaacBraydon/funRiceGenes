NA	OsbHLH061 links TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED repressor proteins with POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 to maintain iron homeostasis in rice.	2022	New Phytol	College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210095, China.	As excess iron (Fe) is toxic, uptake of this essential micronutrient must be tightly controlled. Previous studies have shown that Oryza sativa (rice) POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS1 (OsPRI1) acts upstream of the iron-related transcription factor 2 (OsIRO2) and OsIRO3 to positively regulate root-to-shoot Fe translocation. However, as expression of OsPRI1 is constitutive it is unclear how the Fe-deficiency response is turned off to prevent toxicity when Fe is sufficient. The bHLH transcription factor OsbHLH061 interacts with OsPRI1, and this study used molecular, genetics, biochemical and physiological approaches to functionally characterise OsbHLH061 and how it affects Fe homeostasis. OsbHLH061 knockout or overexpression lines increase or decrease Fe accumulation in shoots respectively. Mechanistically, OsbHLH061 expression is upregulated by high Fe, and physically interacts with OsPRI1, the OsbHLH061-OsPRI1 complex recruits TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED (OsTPL/TPR) co-repressors to repress OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 expression. The OsbHLH061 ethylene-responsive element-binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif is required for this transcriptional repression activity. These results define a functional OsTPL/TPR-OsbHLH061-OsPRI1-OsIRO2/3 module that negatively controls long-distance transport of Fe in plants for adaptation to changing Fe environments and maintain Fe homeostasis in rice.
NA	OsbHLHq11, the Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor, Involved in Regulation of Chlorophyll Content in Rice.	2022	Biology (Basel)	Department of Applied Biosciences, Graduate School, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Korea.	Photosynthesis is an important factor in determining the yield of rice. In particular, the size and efficiency of the photosynthetic system after the heading has a great impact on the yield. Research related to high-efficiency photosynthesis is essential to meet the growing demands of crops for the growing population. Chlorophyll is a key molecule in photosynthesis, a pigment that acts as an antenna to absorb light energy. Improvement of chlorophyll content characteristics has been emphasized in rice breeding for several decades. It is expected that an increase in chlorophyll content may increase photosynthetic efficiency, and understanding the genetic basis involved is important. In this study, we measured leaf color (CIELAB), chlorophyll content (SPAD), and chlorophyll fluorescence, and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping was performed using 120 Cheongcheong/Nagdong double haploid (CNDH) line after the heading date. A major QTL related to chlorophyll content was detected in the RM26981-RM287 region of chromosome 11. OsbHLHq11 was finally selected through screening of genes related to chlorophyll content in the RM26981-RM287 region. The relative expression level of the gene of OsbHLHq11 was highly expressed in cultivars with low chlorophyll content, and is expected to have a similar function to BHLH62 of the Gramineae genus. OsbHLHq11 is expected to increase photosynthetic efficiency by being involved in the chlorophyll content, and is expected to be utilized as a new genetic resource for breeding high-yield rice.
