AP59|OsBIERF3|OsAP59	We previously showed that overexpression of the rice ERF transcription factor gene OsBIERF3 in tobacco increased resistance against different pathogens |  Expression of OsBIERF3 was induced by Xanthomonas oryzae pv |  The OsBIERF3-OE plants attenuated while OsBIERF3-Ri plants enhanced cold tolerance, accompanied by altered expression of cold-responsive genes and proline accumulation	We previously showed that overexpression of the rice ERF transcription factor gene OsBIERF3 in tobacco increased resistance against different pathogens
