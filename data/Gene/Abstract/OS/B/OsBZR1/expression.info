OsBZR1	 BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (OsBZR1), a core transcription activator of BR signaling, directly promoted the accumulation of OsmiR396d which controlled BR response and GA biosynthesis by regulating the expression of different target genes respectively
OsBZR1	 We provided preliminary evidence that OsBZR1 can bind to the DGS1 promoter to activate expression of DGS1
OsBZR1	The histone deacetylase HDA703 interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate rice brassinosteroid signaling, growth and heading date through repression of Ghd7 expression
