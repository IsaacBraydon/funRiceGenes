DLT|OsGRAS-32|D62|GS6	OsBZR1	DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING, a new member of the GRAS family, plays positive roles in brassinosteroid signaling in rice	 Finally, consistent with the fact that DLT is also negatively feedback-regulated by BR treatment, a gel mobility shift assay showed that OsBZR1 can bind to the DLT promoter through the BR-response element
ILI1	OsBZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	 LIC directly regulated target genes such as INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION 1 (ILI1) to oppose the action of BZR1
ILI1	OsBZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	 Repression of LIC in ILI1 transcription in protoplasts was partially rescued by BZR1
LIC|OsLIC1	OsBZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	 Here, we demonstrate that Oryza sativa LEAF and TILLER ANGLE INCREASED CONTROLLER (LIC) acts as an antagonistic transcription factor of BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) to attenuate the BR signaling pathway
LIC|OsLIC1	OsBZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	 The gain-of-function mutant lic-1 and LIC-overexpressing lines showed erect leaves, similar to BZR1-depleted lines, which indicates the opposite roles of LIC and BZR1 in regulating leaf bending
LIC|OsLIC1	OsBZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	 For negative feedback, LIC bound to the core element CTCGC in the BZR1 promoter on gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and repressed its transcription on transient transformation assay
LIC|OsLIC1	OsBZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	 LIC directly regulated target genes such as INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION 1 (ILI1) to oppose the action of BZR1
LIC|OsLIC1	OsBZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	 Repression of LIC in ILI1 transcription in protoplasts was partially rescued by BZR1
LIC|OsLIC1	OsBZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	 Phenotypic analysis of the crossed lines depleted in both LIC and BZR1 suggested that BZR1 functionally depends on LIC
LIC|OsLIC1	OsBZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	 Molecular and physiology assays revealed that LIC plays a dominant role at high BR levels, whereas BZR1 is dominant at low levels
LIC|OsLIC1	OsBZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	 Thus, LIC regulates rice leaf bending as an antagonistic transcription factor of BZR1
CSA	OsBZR1	Brassinosteroids Promote Development of Rice Pollen Grains and Seeds by Triggering Expression of CSA, a MYB Domain Protein.	 Mechanically, OsBZR1 directly promotes CSA expression and CSA directly triggers expression of sugar partitioning and metabolic genes during pollen and seed development
OsBZR1	OsDof12|OsCDF1	Overexpression of OsDof12 affects plant architecture in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Of note, in WT plants the expression of OsDof12 was found up-regulated by BR treatment while in OsDof12 overexpression plants two positive BR signaling regulators, OsBRI1 and OsBZR1, were significantly down-regulated, indicating that OsDof12 may act as a negative BR regulator in rice
OsBZR1	OsPRA2	A Small G Protein as a Novel Component of the Rice Brassinosteroid Signal Transduction.	 Mechanistic study uncovered that OsPRA2 inhibited the dephosphorylation of, and thus inactivated the transcription factor BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (OsBZR1)
OsBZR1	OsPRA2	A Small G Protein as a Novel Component of the Rice Brassinosteroid Signal Transduction.	 Together, these results revealed a possible working mechanism of OsPRA2 as a novel negative regulator on OsBRI1 and OsBZR1 in the BR signaling pathway in rice, and further extended the knowledge about the regulatory mechanism of rice BR signaling
