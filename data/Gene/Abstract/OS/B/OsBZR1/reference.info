Rapid progress has been made regarding the understanding of brassinosteroid (BR) signaling in Arabidopsis. However, little is known about BR signaling in monotyledons. Here, we characterized a rice dwarf and low-tillering (dlt) mutant and cloned the corresponding gene via map-based cloning. DLT encodes a new member of the plant-specific GRAS family. The dwarf phenotype of dlt is similar to BR-deficient or signaling mutants in rice. In addition, both lamina bending and coleoptile elongation assays show that dlt is insensitive or much less responsive to brassinolide (BL), the most active BR, suggesting that DLT is involved in BR signaling. Consistent with this conclusion, the accumulation of transcripts of BR biosynthesis genes in the dlt mutant indicated that DLT is involved in feedback inhibition of BR biosynthesis genes. In addition, transcription of several other BR-regulated genes is altered in the dlt mutant. Finally, consistent with the fact that DLT is also negatively feedback-regulated by BR treatment, a gel mobility shift assay showed that OsBZR1 can bind to the DLT promoter through the BR-response element. Taken together, these studies have enabled us to identify a new signaling component that is involved in several specific BR responses in rice.
journal.pgen.1002686.pdf	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	2012	PLoS Genet	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology/Photosynthesis and Environmental Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Brassinosteroids (BRs) regulate rice plant architecture, including leaf bending, which affects grain yield. Although BR signaling has been investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana, the components negatively regulating this pathway are less well understood. Here, we demonstrate that Oryza sativa LEAF and TILLER ANGLE INCREASED CONTROLLER (LIC) acts as an antagonistic transcription factor of BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) to attenuate the BR signaling pathway. The gain-of-function mutant lic-1 and LIC-overexpressing lines showed erect leaves, similar to BZR1-depleted lines, which indicates the opposite roles of LIC and BZR1 in regulating leaf bending. Quantitative PCR revealed LIC transcription rapidly induced by BR treatment. Image analysis and immunoblotting showed that upon BR treatment LIC proteins translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion. Phosphorylation assay in vitro revealed LIC phosphorylated by GSK3-like kinases. For negative feedback, LIC bound to the core element CTCGC in the BZR1 promoter on gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and repressed its transcription on transient transformation assay. LIC directly regulated target genes such as INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION 1 (ILI1) to oppose the action of BZR1. Repression of LIC in ILI1 transcription in protoplasts was partially rescued by BZR1. Phenotypic analysis of the crossed lines depleted in both LIC and BZR1 suggested that BZR1 functionally depends on LIC. Molecular and physiology assays revealed that LIC plays a dominant role at high BR levels, whereas BZR1 is dominant at low levels. Thus, LIC regulates rice leaf bending as an antagonistic transcription factor of BZR1. The phenotypes of lic-1 and LIC-overexpressing lines in erect leaves contribute to ideal plant architecture. Improving this phenotype may be a potential approach to molecular breeding for high yield in rice.
PNAS-2007-Bai-13839-44.pdf	Functions of OsBZR1 and 14-3-3 proteins in brassinosteroid signaling in rice	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Key Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Environmental Molecular Biology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	Brassinosteroids (BR) are essential growth hormones found throughout the plant kingdom. BR bind to the receptor kinase BRI1 on the cell surface to activate a signal transduction pathway that regulates nuclear gene expression and plant growth. To understand the downstream BR signaling mechanism in rice, we studied the function of OsBZR1 using reverse genetic approaches and identified OsBZR1-interacting proteins. Suppressing OsBZR1 expression by RNAi resulted in dwarfism, erect leaves, reduced BR sensitivity, and altered BR-responsive gene expression in transgenic rice plants, demonstrating an essential role of OsBZR1 in BR responses in rice. Moreover, a yeast two-hybrid screen identified 14-3-3 proteins as OsBZR1-interacting proteins. Mutation of a putative 14-3-3-binding site of OsBZR1 abolished its interaction with the 14-3-3 proteins in yeast and in vivo. Such mutant OsBZR1 proteins suppressed the phenotypes of the Arabidopsis bri1-5 mutant and showed an increased nuclear distribution compared with the wild-type protein, suggesting that 14-3-3 proteins directly inhibit OsBZR1 function at least in part by reducing its nuclear localization. These results demonstrate a conserved function of OsBZR1 and an important role of 14-3-3 proteins in brassinosteroid signal transduction in rice.
NA	OsmiR396d miRNA affects gibberellin and brassinosteroid signaling to regulate plant architecture.	2017	Plant Physiol	Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences CITY: Beijing China [CN].	Genetic improvement of plant architecture is one of the strategies for increasing the yield potential of rice (Oryza sativa). Although great progress has been made in the understanding of plant architecture regulation, the precise mechanism is still an urgent need to be revealed. Here, we report that over-expression of OsMIR396d in rice results in semi-dwarf and increased leaf angle, a typical phenotype of BR enhanced mutant. OsmiR396d is involved in the interaction network of BR and GA signal. In OsMIR396d over-expression plants, BR signaling was enhanced. In contrast, both the signaling and biosynthesis of GA were impaired. BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (OsBZR1), a core transcription activator of BR signaling, directly promoted the accumulation of OsmiR396d which controlled BR response and GA biosynthesis by regulating the expression of different target genes respectively. GROWTH REGULATING FACTOR 6 (OsGRF6), one of OsmiR396d targets, participated in GA biosynthesis and signal transduction, but was not directly involved in BR signaling. This study provides a new insight into the understanding of interaction between BR and GA from multiple levels on controlling plant architecture.
NA	Strigolactones and brassinosteroids antagonistically regulate the stability of D53-OsBZR1 complex to determine FC1 expression in rice tillering.	2019	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and Center of Integrative Biology, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070 China; College of Agricultural Sciences, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025 China.	Rice tillering, a key architecture trait to determine grain yield, is highly regulated by a class of newly identified phytohormone, strigolactones (SLs). However, their whole signaling pathway from receptor to downstream transcription factor to finally inhibit tillering remains unrevealed. We first found that brassinosteroids (BRs) strongly enhanced tillering by promoting bud outgrowth in rice, which is largely different from that in Arabidopsis. Genetic and biochemical analysis indicate that both SL and BR signaling controls rice tillering through regulating the stability of D53 and/or OsBZR1-RLA1-DLT module, the transcriptional complex in rice BR signaling pathway. Further experiments demonstrate that D53 interacts with OsBZR1 to inhibit FC1 expression, the local inhibitor for tillering, which depends on the direct DNA-binding by OsBZR1 to recruit D53 to FC1 promoter in rice buds. Thus, these findings uncover the mechanism how SLs and BRs coordinately regulate rice tillering via the early responsive gene FC1.
NA	OrMKK3 Influences Morphology and Grain Size in Rice	2021	J Plant Biol	Rice Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences/Guangxi Key Laboratory of Rice Genetics and Breeding, Nanning, 530007 China.	Although morphology and grain size are important to rice growth and yield, the identity of abundant natural allelic variations that determine agronomically important differences in crops is unknown. Here, we characterized the function of mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 from Oryza officinalis Wall. ex Watt encoded by OrMKK3. Different alternative splicing variants occurred in OrMKK3. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-OrMKK3 fusion proteins localized to the cell membrane and nuclei of rice protoplasts. Overexpression of OrMKK3 influenced the expression levels of the grain size-related genes SMG1, GW8, GL3, GW2, and DEP3. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OrMKK3 is well conserved in plants while showing large amounts of variation between indica, japonica, and wild rice. In addition, OrMKK3 slightly influenced brassinosteroid (BR) responses and the expression levels of BR-related genes. Our findings thus identify a new gene, OrMKK3, influencing morphology and grain size and that represents a possible link between mitogen-activated protein kinase and BR response pathways in grain growth.
NA	Decreased grain size1, a C3HC4-type RING protein, influences grain size in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2021	Plant Mol Biol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	We reported that DGS1 plays a positive role in regulating grain size in rice and was regulated by OsBZR1. Grain size is an important agronomic trait that contributes to grain yield. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that determine final grain size are still largely unknown. We isolated a rice mutant showing reduced grain size in a 60Co-irradiated variety Nanjing 35 population. We named the mutant decreased grain size1 (dgs1). Map-based cloning and subsequent transgenic CRISPR and complementation assays indicated that a mutation had occurred in LOC_Os03g49900 and that the DGS1 allele regulated grain size. DGS1 encodes a protein with a 7-transmembrane domain and C3HC4 type RING domain. It was widely expressed, especially in young tissues. DGS1 is a membrane-located protein. OsBZR1 (BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1), a core transcription activator of BR signaling, also plays a positive role in grain size. We provided preliminary evidence that OsBZR1 can bind to the DGS1 promoter to activate expression of DGS1.
NA	The histone deacetylase HDA703 interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate rice brassinosteroid signaling, growth and heading date through repression of Ghd7 expression	2021	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	The plant steroid hormones brassinosteroids (BRs) play crucial roles in plant growth and development. The BR signal transduction pathway from perception to the key transcription factors has been well understood in Arabidopsis thaliana and in rice (Oryza sativa); however, the mechanisms conferring BR-mediated growth and flowering remain largely unknown, especially in rice. In this study, we show that HDA703 is a histone H4K8 and H4K12 deacetylase in rice. Hda703 mutants display a typical BR loss-of-function phenotype and reduced sensitivity to brassinolide, the most active BR. Rice plants overexpressing HDA703 exhibit some BR gain-of-function phenotypes dependent on BR biosynthesis and signaling. We also show that HDA703 is a direct target of BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (OsBZR1), a primary regulator of rice BR signaling, and HDA703 interacts with OsBZR1 in rice. We further show that GRAIN NUMBER, PLANT HEIGHT, and HEADING DATE 7 (Ghd7), a central regulator of growth, development, and the stress response, is a direct target of OsBZR1. HDA703 directly targets Ghd7 and represses its expression through histone H4 deacetylation. HDA703-overexpressing rice plants phenocopy Ghd7-silencing rice plants in both growth and heading date. Together, our study suggests that HDA703, a histone H4 deacetylase, interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate rice BR signaling, growth, and heading date through epigenetic regulation of Ghd7.
NA	BZR1 Regulates Brassinosteroid-Mediated Activation of AMT1;2 in Rice	2021	Front Plant Sci .	College of Plant Protection, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China.	Although it is known that brassinosteroids (BRs) play pleiotropic roles in plant growth and development, their roles in plant nutrient uptake remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that BRs directly regulate ammonium uptake by activating the expression of rice AMT1-type genes. Exogenous BR treatment upregulated both AMT1;1 and AMT1;2 expression, while this induction was impaired in the BR-receptor gene BRI1 mutant d61-1. We then focused on brassinazole-resistant 1 (BZR1), a central hub of the BR signaling pathway, demonstrating the important role of this signaling pathway in regulating AMT1 expression and rice roots NH4 + uptake. The results showed that BR-induced expression of AMT1;2 was suppressed in BZR1 RNAi plants but was increased in bzr1-D, a gain-of-function BZR1 mutant. Further EMSA and ChIP analyses showed that BZR1 bound directly to the BRRE motif located in the promoter region of AMT1;2. Moreover, cellular ammonium contents, 15NH4 + uptake, and the regulatory effect of methyl-ammonium on root growth are strongly dependent on the levels of BZR1. Overexpression lines of BRI1 and BZR1 and Genetic combination of them mutants showed that BZR1 activates AMT1;2 expression downstream of BRI1. In conclusion, the findings suggest that BRs regulation of NH4+ uptake in rice involves transcription regulation of ammonium transporters.
