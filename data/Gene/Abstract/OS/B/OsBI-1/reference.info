Treatment of suspension-cultured cells of rice (Oryza sativa L.) with cell wall extract of rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) elicits a rapid generation of H2O2, alkalinization of culture medium, and eventual cell death. To elucidate genes involved in these processes, we exploited SAGE (Serial Analysis of Gene Expression) technique for the molecular analysis of cell death in suspension-cultured cells treated with the elicitor. Among the downregulated genes in the elicitor-treated cells, a BI-1 gene coding for Bax inhibitor was identified. Transgenic rice cells overexpressing Arabidopsis BI-1 gene showed sustainable cell survival when challenged with M. grisea elicitor. Thus, the plant Bax inhibitor plays a functional role in regulating cell death in the rice cell culture system.
NA	Profiling of rice Cd-tolerant genes through yeast-based cDNA library survival screening	2020	Plant Physiol Biochem	Lianyungang Institute of Agricultural Sciences in Jiangsu Xuhuai Region, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lianyungang, China.	The bioaccumulation of cadmium (Cd) in crop and the subsequent food chain has aroused extensive concerns. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of plant Cd tolerance remain to be clarified from the viewpoint of novel candidate genes. Here we described a highly efficient approach for preliminary identifying rice Cd-tolerant genes through the yeast-based cDNA library survival screening combined with high-throughput sequencing strategy. About 690 gene isoforms were identified as being Cd-tolerant candidates using this shotgun approach. Among the Cd-tolerant genes identified, several categories of genes such as BAX inhibitor (BI), NAC transcription factors and Rapid ALkalinization Factors (RALFs) were of particular interest, and their function of Cd tolerance was further validated via heterologous expression, which suggested that SNAC1, RALF12, OsBI-1 can confer Cd tolerance in yeast and tobacco leaves. Regarding the genes involved in ion transport, the validated Cd-tolerant heavy metal-associated domain (HMAD) isoprenylated protein HIPP42 was particularly noteworthy. Further elucidation of these genes associated with Cd tolerance in rice will benefit agricultural activities.
