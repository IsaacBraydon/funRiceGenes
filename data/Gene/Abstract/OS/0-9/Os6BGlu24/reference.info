NA	Specific roles of Os4BGlu10, Os6BGlu24, and Os9BGlu33 in seed germination, root elongation, and drought tolerance in rice.	2019	Planta	Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China.	Morphological, physiological, and gene expression analyses showed that Os4BGlu10, Os6BGlu24, and Os9BGlu33 played specific roles in seed germination, root elongation, and drought tolerance of rice, with various relations with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. ¦Â-Glucosidases (BGlus) belong to glycoside hydrolase family 1 and have many functions in plants. In this study, we investigated the function of three BGlus in seed germination, drought tolerance, and root elongation using the loss-of-function mutants bglu10, bglu24, and bglu33. These mutants germinated slightly later under normal conditions and had significantly longer roots than the wild type. In the presence of ABA, bglu10 and bglu24 exhibited a higher germination inhibition percentage, whereas bglu33 had a lower germination inhibition percentage, compared to the wild type. All of the mutants exhibited less drought tolerance, with the survival rates significantly lower than that of the wild type, which was also confirmed by a decrease in relative leaf water content and Fv/Fm ratio after drought treatment. The root length of bglu10 did not respond to IAA, whereas that of bglu24 responded to a high (0.25<U+00A0>¦ÌM) concentration of IAA, and that of bglu33 to a low (0.05<U+00A0>¦ÌM) concentration of IAA. The root length of bglu10 and bglu24 did not respond to ABA, whereas that of bglu33 increased significantly in response to a high (0.05<U+00A0>¦ÌM) concentration of ABA. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that expression of Os4BGlu10 was up-regulated by polyethylene glycol (PEG), whereas that of Os6BGlu24 was up-regulated by 0.25<U+00A0>¦ÌM IAA, and Os9BGlu33 was up-regulated by PEG, IAA, and ABA. Taken together, we demonstrate that Os4BGlu10, Os6BGlu24, and Os9BGlu33 play specific roles in seed germination, root elongation, and drought tolerance with various relation with IAA and ABA signaling.
