Os1BGlu4	leaf	Recombinant expression and characterization of the cytoplasmic rice β-glucosidase Os1BGlu4.	Fluorescence microscopy of maize protoplasts and tobacco leaf cells expressing green fluorescent protein-tagged Os1BGlu4 confirmed the cytoplasmic localization
Os1BGlu4	cytoplasm	Recombinant expression and characterization of the cytoplasmic rice β-glucosidase Os1BGlu4.	The Os1BGlu4 β-glucosidase is the only glycoside hydrolase family 1 member in rice that is predicted to be localized in the cytoplasm
