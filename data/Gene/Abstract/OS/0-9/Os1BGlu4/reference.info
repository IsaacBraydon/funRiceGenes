NA	Recombinant expression and characterization of the cytoplasmic rice β-glucosidase Os1BGlu4.	2014	PLoS One	School of Biotechnology, Institute of Agricultural Technology, Suranaree University of Technology, Muang District, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand; Guizhou Institute of Upland Food Crops, Guizhou Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.	The Os1BGlu4 β-glucosidase is the only glycoside hydrolase family 1 member in rice that is predicted to be localized in the cytoplasm. To characterize the biochemical function of rice Os1BGlu4, the Os1bglu4 cDNA was cloned and used to express a thioredoxin fusion protein in Escherichia coli. After removal of the tag, the purified recombinant Os1BGlu4 (rOs1BGlu4) exhibited an optimum pH of 6.5, which is consistent with Os1BGlu4's cytoplasmic localization. Fluorescence microscopy of maize protoplasts and tobacco leaf cells expressing green fluorescent protein-tagged Os1BGlu4 confirmed the cytoplasmic localization. Purified rOs1BGlu4 can hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl (pNP)-β-D-glucoside (pNPGlc) efficiently (kcat/Km  =  17.9 mM(-1) · s(-1)), and hydrolyzes pNP-β-D-fucopyranoside with about 50% the efficiency of the pNPGlc. Among natural substrates tested, rOs1BGlu4 efficiently hydrolyzed β-(1,3)-linked oligosaccharides of degree of polymerization (DP) 2-3, and β-(1,4)-linked oligosaccharide of DP 3-4, and hydrolysis of salicin, esculin and p-coumaryl alcohol was also detected. Analysis of the hydrolysis of pNP-β-cellobioside showed that the initial hydrolysis was between the two glucose molecules, and suggested rOs1BGlu4 transglucosylates this substrate. At 10 mM pNPGlc concentration, rOs1BGlu4 can transfer the glucosyl group of pNPGlc to ethanol and pNPGlc. This transglycosylation activity suggests the potential use of Os1BGlu4 for pNP-oligosaccharide and alkyl glycosides synthesis.
NA	Rice β-Glucosidase 4 (Os1βGlu4) Regulates the Hull Pigmentation via Accumulation of Salicylic Acid.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	Key Laboratory of Southwest Crop Genetic Resources and Genetic Improvement, Ministry of Education, Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.	Salicylic acid (SA) is a stress hormone synthesized in phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and the branching acid pathway. SA has two interconvertible forms in plants: SAG (SA O-β-glucoside) and SA (free form). The molecular mechanism of conversion of SA to SAG had been reported previously. However, which genes regulate SAG to SA remained unknown. Here, we report a cytoplasmic β-glucosidase (β-Glu) which participates in the SA pathway and is involved in the brown hull pigmentation in rice grain. In the current study, an EMS-generated mutant brown hull 1 (bh1) displayed decreased contents of SA in hulls, a lower photosynthesis rate, and high-temperature sensitivity compared to the wild type (WT). A plaque-like phenotype (brown pigmentation) was present on the hulls of bh1, which causes a significant decrease in the seed setting rate. Genetic analysis revealed a mutation in LOC_Os01g67220, which encodes a cytoplasmic Os1βGlu4. The knock-out lines displayed the phenotype of brown pigmentation on hulls and decreased seed setting rate comparable with bh1. Overexpression and complementation lines of Os1βGlu4 restored the phenotype of hulls and normal seed setting rate comparable with WT. Subcellular localization revealed that the protein of Os1βGlu4 was localized in the cytoplasm. In contrast to WT, bh1 could not hydrolyze SAG into SA in vivo. Together, our results revealed the novel role of Os1βGlu4 in the accumulation of flavonoids in hulls by regulating the level of free SA in the cellular pool.
