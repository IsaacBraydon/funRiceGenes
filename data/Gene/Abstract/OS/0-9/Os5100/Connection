Os1900|CYP711A5	Os5100|CYP711A6	Fertilization controls tiller numbers via transcriptional regulation of a MAX1-like gene in rice cultivation.	 Elaborate genetic and biochemical analyses using CRISPR/Cas9 mutants reveal that Os1900 together with another MAX1-like gene, Os5100, play a critical role in controlling the conversion of carlactone into carlactonoic acid during strigolactone biosynthesis and tillering in rice
