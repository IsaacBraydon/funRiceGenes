Os4BGlu10	seed germination	Specific roles of Os4BGlu10, Os6BGlu24, and Os9BGlu33 in seed germination, root elongation, and drought tolerance in rice	Morphological, physiological, and gene expression analyses showed that Os4BGlu10, Os6BGlu24, and Os9BGlu33 played specific roles in seed germination, root elongation, and drought tolerance of rice, with various relations with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. ¦Â-Glucosidases (BGlus) belong to glycoside hydrolase family 1 and have many functions in plants.
