Os4BGlu10	Morphological, physiological, and gene expression analyses showed that Os4BGlu10, Os6BGlu24, and Os9BGlu33 played specific roles in seed germination, root elongation, and drought tolerance of rice, with various relations with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling |  Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that expression of Os4BGlu10 was up-regulated by polyethylene glycol (PEG), whereas that of Os6BGlu24 was up-regulated by 0
