OsYUC12	 The analysis shows a brief peak of OsYUC12 expression early in endosperm development |  Meta-analysis of microarray data, confirmed by quantitative expression analysis, revealed that OsYUC12 is coexpressed with OsIAA29, which encodes an unusual AUX/IAA transcription factor previously reported as poorly expressed |  Maximum expression of OsYUC12 and OsIAA29 coincided with maximum CWIN activity, but also with a peak in INVINH expression |  Unlike ZmYUC1, OsYUC12 expression is not reduced in the rice CWIN mutant, gif1
