OsYUC12	grain	Auxin and Cell Wall Invertase Related Signaling during Rice Grain Development.	 OsYUC12 is one of three IAA biosynthesis genes we previously reported as expressed during early rice grain development, correlating with a large increase in IAA content of the grain
OsYUC12	development	Auxin and Cell Wall Invertase Related Signaling during Rice Grain Development.	 The analysis shows a brief peak of OsYUC12 expression early in endosperm development
OsYUC12	transcription factor	Auxin and Cell Wall Invertase Related Signaling during Rice Grain Development.	 Meta-analysis of microarray data, confirmed by quantitative expression analysis, revealed that OsYUC12 is coexpressed with OsIAA29, which encodes an unusual AUX/IAA transcription factor previously reported as poorly expressed
OsYUC12	iaa	Auxin and Cell Wall Invertase Related Signaling during Rice Grain Development.	 OsYUC12 is one of three IAA biosynthesis genes we previously reported as expressed during early rice grain development, correlating with a large increase in IAA content of the grain
OsYUC12	endosperm	Auxin and Cell Wall Invertase Related Signaling during Rice Grain Development.	 The analysis shows a brief peak of OsYUC12 expression early in endosperm development
