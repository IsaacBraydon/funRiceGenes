Os11Gsk	yield	Os11Gsk gene from a wild rice, Oryza rufipogon improves yield in rice	Three sister lines of IL50-7 yielding higher than KMR3 showed presence of Os11Gsk, whereas the gene was absent in three other ILs from the same cross having lower yield than KMR3, indicating an association of the presence of Os11Gsk with high yield
Os11Gsk	yield	Os11Gsk gene from a wild rice, Oryza rufipogon improves yield in rice	Thus, we show that Os11Gsk is a wild rice-derived gene introduced in KMR3 background and increases yield either by regulating expression of functional genes sharing homology with it or by causing epigenetic modifications in the introgression line
