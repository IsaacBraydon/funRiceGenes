Plant Physiol.-2011-Gui-574-86.pdf	Functional characterization of evolutionarily divergent 4-coumarate:coenzyme a ligases in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China.	4-Coumarate:coenzyme A ligase (4CL; EC 6.2.1.12) is a key enzyme in the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathways for monolignol and flavonoid biosynthesis. 4CL has been much studied in dicotyledons, but its function is not completely understood in monocotyledons, which display a different monolignol composition and phenylpropanoid profile. In this study, five members of the 4CL gene family in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome were cloned and analyzed. Biochemical characterization of the 4CL recombinant proteins revealed that the rice 4CL isoforms displayed different substrate specificities and catalytic turnover rates. Among them, Os4CL3 exhibited the highest turnover rate. No apparent tissue-specific expression of the five 4CLs was observed, but significant differences in their expression levels were detected. The rank in order of transcript abundance was Os4CL3 > Os4CL5 > Os4CL1 > Os4CL4 > Os4CL2. Suppression of Os4CL3 expression resulted in significant lignin reduction, shorter plant growth, and other morphological changes. The 4CL-suppressed transgenics also displayed decreased panicle fertility, which may be attributed to abnormal anther development as a result of disrupted lignin synthesis. This study demonstrates that the rice 4CLs exhibit different in vitro catalytic properties from those in dicots and that 4CL-mediated metabolism in vivo may play important roles in regulating a broad range of biological events over the course of rice growth and development.
NA	ART1 and putrescine contribute to rice aluminum resistance via OsMYB30 in cell wall modification.	2023	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Cell wall is the first physical barrier to aluminum (Al) toxicity. Modification of cell wall properties to change its binding capacity to Al is one of the major strategies for plant Al resistance; nevertheless, how it is regulated in rice remains largely unknown. In this study, we show that exogenous application of putrescines (Put) could significantly restore the Al resistance of art1, a rice mutant lacking the central regulator Al RESISTANCE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1 (ART1), and reduce its Al accumulation particularly in the cell wall of root tips. Based on RNA-sequencing, yeast-one-hybrid and electrophoresis mobility shift assays, we identified an R2R3 MYB transcription factor OsMYB30 as the novel target in both ART1-dependent and Put-promoted Al resistance. Furthermore, transient dual-luciferase assay showed that ART1 directly inhibited the expression of OsMYB30, and in turn repressed Os4CL5-dependent 4-coumaric acid accumulation, hence reducing the Al-binding capacity of cell wall and enhancing Al resistance. Additionally, Put repressed OsMYB30 expression by eliminating Al-induced H(2) O(2) accumulation, while exogenous H(2) O(2) promoted OsMYB30 expression. We concluded that ART1 confers Put-promoted Al resistance via repression of OsMYB30-regulated modification of cell wall properties in rice.
