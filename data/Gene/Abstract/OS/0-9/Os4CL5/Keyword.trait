Os4CL5	Al resistance	ART1 and putrescine contribute to rice aluminum resistance via OsMYB30 in cell wall modification	Furthermore, transient dual-luciferase assay showed that ART1 directly inhibited the expression of OsMYB30, and in turn repressed Os4CL5-dependent 4-coumaric acid accumulation, hence reducing the Al-binding capacity of cell wall and enhancing Al resistance.
