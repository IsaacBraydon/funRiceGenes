Os4CL1	Os4CL3	Functional characterization of evolutionarily divergent 4-coumarate:coenzyme a ligases in rice	The rank in order of transcript abundance was Os4CL3 > Os4CL5 > Os4CL1 > Os4CL4 > Os4CL2
Os4CL2	Os4CL3	Functional characterization of evolutionarily divergent 4-coumarate:coenzyme a ligases in rice	The rank in order of transcript abundance was Os4CL3 > Os4CL5 > Os4CL1 > Os4CL4 > Os4CL2
Os4CL3	Os4CL4	Functional characterization of evolutionarily divergent 4-coumarate:coenzyme a ligases in rice	The rank in order of transcript abundance was Os4CL3 > Os4CL5 > Os4CL1 > Os4CL4 > Os4CL2
Os4CL3	Os4CL5	Functional characterization of evolutionarily divergent 4-coumarate:coenzyme a ligases in rice	The rank in order of transcript abundance was Os4CL3 > Os4CL5 > Os4CL1 > Os4CL4 > Os4CL2
Os4CL3	OsMYB30|OsMYB5P	Sclerenchyma cell thickening through enhanced lignification induced by OsMYB30 prevents fungal penetration of rice leaves.	 We further find that OsMYB30 binds to and activates the promoters of 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase genes (Os4CL3 and Os4CL5) resulting in accumulation of lignin subunits G and S
