Os4CL3	OsMYB30|OsMYB5P	Sclerenchyma cell thickening through enhanced lignification induced by OsMYB30 prevents fungal penetration of rice leaves.	 We further find that OsMYB30 binds to and activates the promoters of 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase genes (Os4CL3 and Os4CL5) resulting in accumulation of lignin subunits G and S
Os4CL3	Os4CL4	Genome-edited rice deficient in two 4-COUMARATE:COENZYME A LIGASE genes displays diverse lignin alterations.	) 4CL isoforms (Os4CL3 and Os4CL4) primarily by analyzing the cell wall chemical structures of rice mutants generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis
Os4CL3	Os4CL4	Genome-edited rice deficient in two 4-COUMARATE:COENZYME A LIGASE genes displays diverse lignin alterations.	 A series of chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses revealed that loss-of-function of Os4CL3 and Os4CL4 differently altered the composition of lignin polymer units
Os4CL3	Os4CL4	Genome-edited rice deficient in two 4-COUMARATE:COENZYME A LIGASE genes displays diverse lignin alterations.	 Loss-of-function of Os4CL4, but not of Os4CL3, reduced the grass-specific lignin-bound tricin units, indicating that Os4CL4 plays a key role not only in monolignol biosynthesis but also in the biosynthesis of tricin used for lignification
Os4CL3	Os4CL4	Genome-edited rice deficient in two 4-COUMARATE:COENZYME A LIGASE genes displays diverse lignin alterations.	 Further, the loss-of-function of Os4CL3 and Os4CL4 notably reduced cell-wall-bound ferulates, indicating their roles in cell wall feruloylation
Os4CL3	OsSWN1	Lodging variation of weedy rice in China and its epigenetic influencing mechanisms.	 DNA methylation variation of lignin synthesis-related OsSWN1, OsMYBX9, OsPAL1 and Os4CL3 mediated their expression level differnece and affected the ratio of cellulose to lignin content
