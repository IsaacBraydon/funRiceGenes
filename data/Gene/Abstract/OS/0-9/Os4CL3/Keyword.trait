Os4CL3	growth	Functional characterization of evolutionarily divergent 4-coumarate:coenzyme a ligases in rice	Suppression of Os4CL3 expression resulted in significant lignin reduction, shorter plant growth, and other morphological changes
Os4CL3	cell wall	Genome-edited rice deficient in two 4-COUMARATE:COENZYME A LIGASE genes displays diverse lignin alterations.	 Further, the loss-of-function of Os4CL3 and Os4CL4 notably reduced cell-wall-bound ferulates, indicating their roles in cell wall feruloylation
Os4CL3	lignin	Genome-edited rice deficient in two 4-COUMARATE:COENZYME A LIGASE genes displays diverse lignin alterations.	 A series of chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses revealed that loss-of-function of Os4CL3 and Os4CL4 differently altered the composition of lignin polymer units
Os4CL3	lignin	Genome-edited rice deficient in two 4-COUMARATE:COENZYME A LIGASE genes displays diverse lignin alterations.	 Loss of function of Os4CL3 induced marked reductions in the major guaiacyl and syringyl lignin units derived from both the conserved non-γ-p-coumaroylated and the grass-specific γ-p-coumaroylated monolignols, with more prominent reductions in guaiacyl units than in syringyl units
Os4CL3	cellulose	Lodging variation of weedy rice in China and its epigenetic influencing mechanisms.	 DNA methylation variation of lignin synthesis-related OsSWN1, OsMYBX9, OsPAL1 and Os4CL3 mediated their expression level differnece and affected the ratio of cellulose to lignin content
