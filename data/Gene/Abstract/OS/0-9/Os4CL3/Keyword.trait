Os4CL3	growth	Functional characterization of evolutionarily divergent 4-coumarate:coenzyme a ligases in rice	Suppression of Os4CL3 expression resulted in significant lignin reduction, shorter plant growth, and other morphological changes
Os4CL3	cell wall	Genome-edited rice deficient in two 4-COUMARATE:COENZYME A LIGASE genes displays diverse lignin alterations.	 Further, the loss-of-function of Os4CL3 and Os4CL4 notably reduced cell-wall-bound ferulates, indicating their roles in cell wall feruloylation
Os4CL3	lignin	Genome-edited rice deficient in two 4-COUMARATE:COENZYME A LIGASE genes displays diverse lignin alterations.	 A series of chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses revealed that loss-of-function of Os4CL3 and Os4CL4 differently altered the composition of lignin polymer units
Os4CL3	lignin	Genome-edited rice deficient in two 4-COUMARATE:COENZYME A LIGASE genes displays diverse lignin alterations.	 Loss of function of Os4CL3 induced marked reductions in the major guaiacyl and syringyl lignin units derived from both the conserved non-γ-p-coumaroylated and the grass-specific γ-p-coumaroylated monolignols, with more prominent reductions in guaiacyl units than in syringyl units
