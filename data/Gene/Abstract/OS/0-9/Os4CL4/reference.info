Plant Physiol.-2011-Gui-574-86.pdf	Functional characterization of evolutionarily divergent 4-coumarate:coenzyme a ligases in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China.	4-Coumarate:coenzyme A ligase (4CL; EC 6.2.1.12) is a key enzyme in the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathways for monolignol and flavonoid biosynthesis. 4CL has been much studied in dicotyledons, but its function is not completely understood in monocotyledons, which display a different monolignol composition and phenylpropanoid profile. In this study, five members of the 4CL gene family in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome were cloned and analyzed. Biochemical characterization of the 4CL recombinant proteins revealed that the rice 4CL isoforms displayed different substrate specificities and catalytic turnover rates. Among them, Os4CL3 exhibited the highest turnover rate. No apparent tissue-specific expression of the five 4CLs was observed, but significant differences in their expression levels were detected. The rank in order of transcript abundance was Os4CL3 > Os4CL5 > Os4CL1 > Os4CL4 > Os4CL2. Suppression of Os4CL3 expression resulted in significant lignin reduction, shorter plant growth, and other morphological changes. The 4CL-suppressed transgenics also displayed decreased panicle fertility, which may be attributed to abnormal anther development as a result of disrupted lignin synthesis. This study demonstrates that the rice 4CLs exhibit different in vitro catalytic properties from those in dicots and that 4CL-mediated metabolism in vivo may play important roles in regulating a broad range of biological events over the course of rice growth and development.

The 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase (4CL) is a key enzyme that contributes to channeling metabolic flux in the cinnamate/monolignol pathway, leading to the production of monolignols, p-hydroxycinnamates, and a flavonoid tricin, the major building blocks of lignin polymer in grass cell walls. Vascular plants often contain multiple 4CL genes; however, the contribution of each 4CL isoform to lignin biosynthesis remains unclear, especially in grasses. In this study, we characterized the functions of two rice (Oryza sativa L.) 4CL isoforms (Os4CL3 and Os4CL4) primarily by analyzing the cell wall chemical structures of rice mutants generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis. A series of chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses revealed that loss-of-function of Os4CL3 and Os4CL4 differently altered the composition of lignin polymer units. Loss of function of Os4CL3 induced marked reductions in the major guaiacyl and syringyl lignin units derived from both the conserved non-γ-p-coumaroylated and the grass-specific γ-p-coumaroylated monolignols, with more prominent reductions in guaiacyl units than in syringyl units. In contrast, the loss-of-function mutation to Os4CL4 primarily decreased the abundance of the non-γ-p-coumaroylated guaiacyl units. Loss-of-function of Os4CL4, but not of Os4CL3, reduced the grass-specific lignin-bound tricin units, indicating that Os4CL4 plays a key role not only in monolignol biosynthesis but also in the biosynthesis of tricin used for lignification. Further, the loss-of-function of Os4CL3 and Os4CL4 notably reduced cell-wall-bound ferulates, indicating their roles in cell wall feruloylation. Overall, this study demonstrates the overlapping but divergent roles of 4CL isoforms during the coordinated production of various lignin monomers.
