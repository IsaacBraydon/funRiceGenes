Os4CL1	Os4CL4	Functional characterization of evolutionarily divergent 4-coumarate:coenzyme a ligases in rice	The rank in order of transcript abundance was Os4CL3 > Os4CL5 > Os4CL1 > Os4CL4 > Os4CL2
Os4CL2	Os4CL4	Functional characterization of evolutionarily divergent 4-coumarate:coenzyme a ligases in rice	The rank in order of transcript abundance was Os4CL3 > Os4CL5 > Os4CL1 > Os4CL4 > Os4CL2
Os4CL3	Os4CL4	Functional characterization of evolutionarily divergent 4-coumarate:coenzyme a ligases in rice	The rank in order of transcript abundance was Os4CL3 > Os4CL5 > Os4CL1 > Os4CL4 > Os4CL2
Os4CL4	Os4CL5	Functional characterization of evolutionarily divergent 4-coumarate:coenzyme a ligases in rice	The rank in order of transcript abundance was Os4CL3 > Os4CL5 > Os4CL1 > Os4CL4 > Os4CL2
Os4CL3	Os4CL4	Genome-edited rice deficient in two 4-COUMARATE:COENZYME A LIGASE genes displays diverse lignin alterations.	) 4CL isoforms (Os4CL3 and Os4CL4) primarily by analyzing the cell wall chemical structures of rice mutants generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis
Os4CL3	Os4CL4	Genome-edited rice deficient in two 4-COUMARATE:COENZYME A LIGASE genes displays diverse lignin alterations.	 A series of chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses revealed that loss-of-function of Os4CL3 and Os4CL4 differently altered the composition of lignin polymer units
Os4CL3	Os4CL4	Genome-edited rice deficient in two 4-COUMARATE:COENZYME A LIGASE genes displays diverse lignin alterations.	 Loss-of-function of Os4CL4, but not of Os4CL3, reduced the grass-specific lignin-bound tricin units, indicating that Os4CL4 plays a key role not only in monolignol biosynthesis but also in the biosynthesis of tricin used for lignification
Os4CL3	Os4CL4	Genome-edited rice deficient in two 4-COUMARATE:COENZYME A LIGASE genes displays diverse lignin alterations.	 Further, the loss-of-function of Os4CL3 and Os4CL4 notably reduced cell-wall-bound ferulates, indicating their roles in cell wall feruloylation
