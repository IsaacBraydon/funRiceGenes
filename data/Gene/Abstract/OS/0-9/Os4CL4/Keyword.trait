Os4CL4	cell wall	Genome-edited rice deficient in two 4-COUMARATE:COENZYME A LIGASE genes displays diverse lignin alterations.	 Further, the loss-of-function of Os4CL3 and Os4CL4 notably reduced cell-wall-bound ferulates, indicating their roles in cell wall feruloylation
Os4CL4	lignin	Genome-edited rice deficient in two 4-COUMARATE:COENZYME A LIGASE genes displays diverse lignin alterations.	 A series of chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses revealed that loss-of-function of Os4CL3 and Os4CL4 differently altered the composition of lignin polymer units
