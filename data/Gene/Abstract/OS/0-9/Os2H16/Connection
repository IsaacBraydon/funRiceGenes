ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Os2H16	OsASR2 regulates the expression of a defense-related gene, Os2H16, by targeting the GT-1 cis-element.	OsASR2 regulates the expression of a defense-related gene, Os2H16, by targeting the GT-1 cis-element.
ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Os2H16	OsASR2 regulates the expression of a defense-related gene, Os2H16, by targeting the GT-1 cis-element.	 Furthermore, we identified that OsASR2 was specifically bound to GT-1 and activated the expression of the target gene Os2H16, as well as GFP driven by the chimeric promoter of 2 Ã— GT-1-35S mini construct
