ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Os2H16	OsASR2 regulates the expression of a defense-related gene, Os2H16, by targeting the GT-1 cis-element.	OsASR2 regulates the expression of a defense-related gene, Os2H16, by targeting the GT-1 cis-element.
ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Os2H16	OsASR2 regulates the expression of a defense-related gene, Os2H16, by targeting the GT-1 cis-element.	 Furthermore, we identified that OsASR2 was specifically bound to GT-1 and activated the expression of the target gene Os2H16, as well as GFP driven by the chimeric promoter of 2 Ã— GT-1-35S mini construct
Os2H16	OsbHLH057	OsbHLH057 targets the AATCA cis-element to regulate disease resistance and drought tolerance in rice.	 Overall, our results uncovered an OsbHLH057 and AATCA module that synergistically regulates the expression of Os2H16 in response to R
