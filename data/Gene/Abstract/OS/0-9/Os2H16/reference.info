NA	OsASR2 regulates the expression of a defense-related gene, Os2H16, by targeting the GT-1 cis-element.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Crop Biology College of Agronomy, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai an, Shandong, 271018, China.	The GT-1 cis-element widely exists in many plant gene promoters. However, the molecular mechanism that underlies the response of the GT-1 cis-element to abiotic and biotic stresses remains elusive in rice. We previously isolated a rice short-chain peptide encoding gene, Os2H16, and demonstrated that it plays important roles in both disease resistance and drought tolerance. Here, we conducted a promoter assay of Os2H16 and identified GT-1 as an important cis-element that mediates Os2H16 expression in response to pathogen attack and osmotic stress. By using the repeated GT-1 as bait, we characterized an abscisic acid, stress and ripening 2 (ASR2) protein from yeast-one hybridization screening. Sequence alignments showed that the carboxy-terminal domain of OsASR2 containing residues 80-138 was the DNA-binding domain. Furthermore, we identified that OsASR2 was specifically bound to GT-1 and activated the expression of the target gene Os2H16, as well as GFP driven by the chimeric promoter of 2 × GT-1-35S mini construct. Additionally, the expression of OsASR2 was elevated by pathogens and osmotic stress challenges. Overexpression of OsASR2 enhanced the resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani, and tolerance to drought in rice. These results suggest that the interaction between OsASR2 and GT-1 plays an important role in the crosstalk of the response of rice to biotic and abiotic stresses.

NA	Overexpression of Os2H16 enhances resistance to phytopathogens and tolerance to drought stress in rice	2013	Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture	State Key Laboratory of Crop Biology, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai an 271018, Shandong, People’s Republic of China	Os2H16, a rice gene of unknown function, has been previously reported to be upregulated in response to infection by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. In this study, expression patterns of Os2H16 were analyzed, demonstrating that expression of Os2H16 was dramatically induced by both bacterial and fungal infection as well as by drought stress, but repressed by salt treatment. To further investigate the role of Os2H16 in plant defense responses to abiotic and biotic stresses, transgenic lines of rice were developed. In comparison with wild-type rice, transgenic lines overexpressing Os2H16 show enhanced tolerance to bacterial blight and sheath blight disease, respectively caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani. On the contrary, Os2H16 knockdown lines were more susceptible to both pathogens. Consistent with their individual phenotypes, upon inoculation, the expression of defense-related marker genes were elevated in Os2H16 overexpression individuals than in wild-type, while they were significantly reduced in Os2H16 knockdown lines. We also show that Os2H16 overexpression lines display enhanced tolerance to drought stress and elevated induction of drought-related genes, compared to wild-type rice. Os2H16 knockdown lines were more sensitive to drought stress and exhibited reduced induction of drought-related genes. Our study provides the first functional characterization of the rice Os2H16 gene, and suggests that Os2H16 positively modulate plant defense to abiotic and biotic stress.
