Os11N3|OsSWEET14	 Here, we report the generation of an allele library of OsSWEET14 promoter through stable expression of TALE-Nuclease (TALEN) constructs in rice
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	 Moreover, the expression of OsSWEET14 was detected in vascular tissues, including the stem, leaf sheath, leaf blade and root
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	 Both OsSWEET14 and OsSWEET11 exhibited distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns between the early stage of caryopsis development and the rapid grain-filling stage
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	 Importantly, one of these T2 lines, harboring the largest homozygous 6-bp deletion, displayed decreased OsSWEET14 expression as well as a significantly reduced susceptibility to a Vietnamese Xoo strains and complete resistance to another one
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	 Moreover, carbohydrate distribution was changed, leading to the accumulation of sucrose and starch in the leaves containing ossac3 on account of decreased expression of OsSWEET3a, OsSWEET6a and OsSWEET14 and oxidized inactivation of starch degradation enzymes in ossac3
