Os11N3|OsSWEET14	 Here, we report the generation of an allele library of OsSWEET14 promoter through stable expression of TALE-Nuclease (TALEN) constructs in rice
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	 Moreover, the expression of OsSWEET14 was detected in vascular tissues, including the stem, leaf sheath, leaf blade and root
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	 Both OsSWEET14 and OsSWEET11 exhibited distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns between the early stage of caryopsis development and the rapid grain-filling stage
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	 Importantly, one of these T2 lines, harboring the largest homozygous 6-bp deletion, displayed decreased OsSWEET14 expression as well as a significantly reduced susceptibility to a Vietnamese Xoo strains and complete resistance to another one
