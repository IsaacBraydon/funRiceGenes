Os11N3|OsSWEET14	Os8N3|xa13|OsSWEET11	Rice xa13 recessive resistance to bacterial blight is defeated by induction of the disease susceptibility gene Os-11N3	The finding that Os-8N3 and Os-11N3 encode closely related proteins also provides evidence that N3 proteins have a specific function in facilitating bacterial blight disease

JMJ704	Os11N3|OsSWEET14	JMJ704 positively regulates rice defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv.  oryzae infection via reducing H3K4me2/3 associated with negative disease resistance regulators	Moreover, JMJ704 suppressed the transcription of the rice defense negative regulator genes, such as NRR, OsWRKY62 and Os-11N3, by reducing the activation marks H3K4me2/3 on them
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	OsSAC1	Mutation of the OsSAC1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum protein with an unknown function, causes sugar accumulation in rice leaves.	 Extremely more OsAGPL1 and OsAGPS1 (responsible for starch synthesis) expression and significantly less OscFBP1, OscFBP2, OsSPS1, and OsSPS11 (responsible for sucrose synthesis) and OsSWEET11, OsSWEET14, and OsSUT1 (responsible for sucrose loading) expression occurred in ossac1 source leaves than in WT source leaves
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	OsDOF11	Rice Transcription Factor OsDOF11 Modulates Sugar Transport by Promoting Expression of Sucrose Transporter and SWEET genes.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that OsDOF11 directly binds to the promoter regions of SUT1, OsSWEET11, and OsSWEET14, indicating that OsDOF11 coordinately controls transporters that are responsible for sucrose transport via apoplastic loading
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	Xa25|OsSWEET13	Natural variations in the promoter of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET14 expand the range of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	Natural variations in the promoter of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET14 expand the range of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	Xa25|OsSWEET13	Natural variations in the promoter of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET14 expand the range of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	 In this study, we identified candidate resistance alleles by mining a rice diversity panel for mutations in the promoter of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET14, which are direct targets of three major TALEs PthXo2, PthXo3 and AvrXa7
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	Os8N3|xa13|OsSWEET11	OsSWEET14 cooperates with OsSWEET11 to contribute to grain filling in rice	OsSWEET14 cooperates with OsSWEET11 to contribute to grain filling in rice
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	Os8N3|xa13|OsSWEET11	OsSWEET14 cooperates with OsSWEET11 to contribute to grain filling in rice	 ossweet14 knockout mutants did not show any detectable phenotypic differences from the wild type, whereas ossweet14;ossweet11 double-knockout mutants had much more severe phenotypes than ossweet11 single-knockout mutants, including strongly reduced grain weight and yield, reduced grain-filling rate, and increased starch accumulation in the pericarp
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	Os8N3|xa13|OsSWEET11	OsSWEET14 cooperates with OsSWEET11 to contribute to grain filling in rice	 Both OsSWEET14 and OsSWEET11 exhibited distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns between the early stage of caryopsis development and the rapid grain-filling stage
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	Os8N3|xa13|OsSWEET11	OsSWEET14 cooperates with OsSWEET11 to contribute to grain filling in rice	 During the rapid grain-filling stage, OsSWEET14 and OsSWEET11 localized to four key sites: vascular parenchyma cells, the nucellar projection, the nucellar epidermis, and cross cells
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	OsDOF11	OsDOF11 Affects Nitrogen Metabolism by Sucrose Transport Signaling in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Previously, we noted that Oryza sativa DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER 11 (OsDOF11) mediated sucrose transport by binding to the promoter regions of Sucrose Transporter 1 (SUT1), Oryza sativa Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters 11 (OsSWEET11), and OsSWEET14
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	OsDOF11	OsDOF11 Affects Nitrogen Metabolism by Sucrose Transport Signaling in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Mutants of the sucrose transporter gene OsSWEET14 displayed a phenotype similar to that of OsDOF11
