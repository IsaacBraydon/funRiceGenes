Os11N3|OsSWEET14	Os8N3|xa13|OsSWEET11	Rice xa13 recessive resistance to bacterial blight is defeated by induction of the disease susceptibility gene Os-11N3	The finding that Os-8N3 and Os-11N3 encode closely related proteins also provides evidence that N3 proteins have a specific function in facilitating bacterial blight disease
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	Os8N3|xa13|OsSWEET11	Rice xa13 recessive resistance to bacterial blight is defeated by induction of the disease susceptibility gene Os-11N3	Rice xa13 recessive resistance to bacterial blight is defeated by induction of the disease susceptibility gene Os-11N3
JMJ704	Os11N3|OsSWEET14	JMJ704 positively regulates rice defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv.  oryzae infection via reducing H3K4me2/3 associated with negative disease resistance regulators	Moreover, JMJ704 suppressed the transcription of the rice defense negative regulator genes, such as NRR, OsWRKY62 and Os-11N3, by reducing the activation marks H3K4me2/3 on them
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	OsSAC1	Mutation of the OsSAC1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum protein with an unknown function, causes sugar accumulation in rice leaves.	 Extremely more OsAGPL1 and OsAGPS1 (responsible for starch synthesis) expression and significantly less OscFBP1, OscFBP2, OsSPS1, and OsSPS11 (responsible for sucrose synthesis) and OsSWEET11, OsSWEET14, and OsSUT1 (responsible for sucrose loading) expression occurred in ossac1 source leaves than in WT source leaves
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	OsDOF11	Rice Transcription Factor OsDOF11 Modulates Sugar Transport by Promoting Expression of Sucrose Transporter and SWEET genes.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that OsDOF11 directly binds to the promoter regions of SUT1, OsSWEET11, and OsSWEET14, indicating that OsDOF11 coordinately controls transporters that are responsible for sucrose transport via apoplastic loading
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	Xa25|OsSWEET13	Natural variations in the promoter of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET14 expand the range of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	Natural variations in the promoter of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET14 expand the range of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.
Os11N3|OsSWEET14	Xa25|OsSWEET13	Natural variations in the promoter of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET14 expand the range of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	 In this study, we identified candidate resistance alleles by mining a rice diversity panel for mutations in the promoter of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET14, which are direct targets of three major TALEs PthXo2, PthXo3 and AvrXa7
