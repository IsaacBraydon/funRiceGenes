Os11N3|OsSWEET14	Os8N3|xa13	Rice xa13 recessive resistance to bacterial blight is defeated by induction of the disease susceptibility gene Os-11N3	 The finding that Os-8N3 and Os-11N3 encode closely related proteins also provides evidence that N3 proteins have a specific function in facilitating bacterial blight disease

JMJ704	Os11N3|OsSWEET14	JMJ704 positively regulates rice defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv.  oryzae infection via reducing H3K4me2/3 associated with negative disease resistance regulators	Moreover, JMJ704 suppressed the transcription of the rice defense negative regulator genes, such as NRR, OsWRKY62 and Os-11N3, by reducing the activation marks H3K4me2/3 on them
