Os4BGlu12	cell wall	Rice Os4BGlu12 is a wound-induced β-glucosidase that hydrolyzes cell wall-β-glucan-derived oligosaccharides and glycosides	 Os4BGlu12 expressed in recombinant Escherichia coli hydrolyzed β-(1,3;1,4)-glucooligosaccharides generated by the wounding-induced rice endo-(1,3;1,4)-β-glucanase OsEGL1, suggesting that both enzymes may act in concert in remodeling of damaged cell wall
Os4BGlu12	cell wall	Rice Os4BGlu12 is a wound-induced β-glucosidase that hydrolyzes cell wall-β-glucan-derived oligosaccharides and glycosides	 The amino acid residues predicted to line the active site of Os4BGlu12 are more similar to those of cyanogenic and flavonoid β-glucosidases than oligosaccharide hydrolases, and it may function in defense, as well as in cell wall-derived oligosaccharide break-down
