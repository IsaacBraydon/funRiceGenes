Os4BGlu12, an oligosaccharide and tuberonic acid glucoside-hydrolyzing beta-glucosidase with significant thioglucohydrolase activity	2011	Arch Biochem Biophys	Institute of Science, Schools of Biochemistry and Chemistry, Suranaree University of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand.	Rice Os4BGlu12, a glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1) beta-glucosidase, hydrolyzes beta-(1,4)-linked oligosaccharides of 3-6 glucosyl residues and the beta-(1,3)-linked disaccharide laminaribiose, as well as certain glycosides. The crystal structures of apo Os4BGlu12, and its complexes with 2,4-dinitrophenyl-2-deoxyl-2-fluoroglucoside (DNP2FG) and 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose (G2F) were solved at 2.50, 2.45 and 2.40A resolution, respectively. The overall structure of rice Os4BGlu12 is typical of GH1 enzymes, but it contains an extra disulfide bridge in the loop B region. The glucose ring of the G2F in the covalent intermediate was found in a (4)C(1) chair conformation, while that of the noncovalently bound DNP2FG had a (1)S(3) skew boat, consistent with hydrolysis via a (4)H(3) half-chair transition state. The position of the catalytic nucleophile (Glu393) in the G2F structure was more similar to that of the Sinapsis alba myrosinase G2F complex than to that in covalent intermediates of other O-glucosidases, such as rice Os3BGlu6 and Os3BGlu7 beta-glucosidases. This correlated with a significant thioglucosidase activity for Os4BGlu12, although with 200- to 1200-fold lower k(cat)/K(m) values for S-glucosides than the comparable O-glucosides, while hydrolysis of S-glucosides was undetectable for Os3BGlu6 and Os3BGlu7.
1-s2.0-S0168945210001524-main.pdf	Rice Os4BGlu12 is a wound-induced Î²-glucosidase that hydrolyzes cell wall-Î²-glucan-derived oligosaccharides and glycosides	2010	Plant Science	School of Biochemistry, Institute of Science, Suranaree University of Technology, Muang District, Nakhon Ratchasima 30000, Thailand	Rice Os4BGlu12 Î²-glucosidase is a family 1 glycoside hydrolase, the transcript levels of which have previously been found to be induced in response to herbivore attack and salinity stress. Here, high levels of Os4bglu12 transcripts were also detected in the shoot during germination, in the leaf sheath and stem of mature rice plants under normal growth conditions. The transcripts of this gene were up-regulated in response to wounding, methyl jasmonate and ethephon in 10-day-old rice seedlings. Os4BGlu12 expressed in recombinant Escherichia coli hydrolyzed Î²-(1,3;1,4)-glucooligosaccharides generated by the wounding-induced rice endo-(1,3;1,4)-Î²-glucanase OsEGL1, suggesting that both enzymes may act in concert in remodeling of damaged cell wall. Among oligosaccharides tested, Os4BGlu12 hydrolyzed Î²-(1,4)-linked glucooligosaccharides with highest catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km = 2.7â€<U+393C><U+3E33>4.9 sâˆ<U+393C><U+3E32>1 mMâˆ<U+393C><U+3E32>1) when the degree of polymerization ranged from 3 to 6. It also hydrolyzed the Î²-(1,3)-linked disaccharide laminaribiose with high catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km = 4.5 sâˆ<U+393C><U+3E32>1 mMâˆ<U+393C><U+3E32>1). Among the natural glycosides tested, Os4BGlu12 efficiently hydrolyzed deoxycorticosterone 21-glucoside (kcat/Km = 20 sâˆ<U+393C><U+3E32>1 mMâˆ<U+393C><U+3E32>1) and apigenin 7-O-Î²-d-glucoside (kcat/Km = 6.7 sâˆ<U+393C><U+3E32>1 mMâˆ<U+393C><U+3E32>1). The amino acid residues predicted to line the active site of Os4BGlu12 are more similar to those of cyanogenic and flavonoid Î²-glucosidases than oligosaccharide hydrolases, and it may function in defense, as well as in cell wall-derived oligosaccharide break-down.
1471-2229-6-33.pdf	Analysis of rice glycosyl hydrolase family 1 and expression of Os4bglu12 beta-glucosidase	2006	BMC Plant Biol	Institute of Science, Suranaree University of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima 30000, Thailand. opassiri@hotmail.com <opassiri@hotmail.com>	BACKGROUND: Glycosyl hydrolase family 1 (GH1) beta-glucosidases have been implicated in physiologically important processes in plants, such as response to biotic and abiotic stresses, defense against herbivores, activation of phytohormones, lignification, and cell wall remodeling. Plant GH1 beta-glucosidases are encoded by a multigene family, so we predicted the structures of the genes and the properties of their protein products, and characterized their phylogenetic relationship to other plant GH1 members, their expression and the activity of one of them, to begin to decipher their roles in rice. RESULTS: Forty GH1 genes could be identified in rice databases, including 2 possible endophyte genes, 2 likely pseudogenes, 2 gene fragments, and 34 apparently competent rice glycosidase genes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that GH1 members with closely related sequences have similar gene structures and are often clustered together on the same chromosome. Most of the genes appear to have been derived from duplications that occurred after the divergence of rice and Arabidopsis thaliana lineages from their common ancestor, and the two plants share only 8 common gene lineages. At least 31 GH1 genes are expressed in a range of organs and stages of rice, based on the cDNA and EST sequences in public databases. The cDNA of the Os4bglu12 gene, which encodes a protein identical at 40 of 44 amino acid residues with the N-terminal sequence of a cell wall-bound enzyme previously purified from germinating rice, was isolated by RT-PCR from rice seedlings. A thioredoxin-Os4bglu12 fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli efficiently hydrolyzed beta-(1,4)-linked oligosaccharides of 3-6 glucose residues and laminaribiose. CONCLUSION: Careful analysis of the database sequences produced more reliable rice GH1 gene structure and protein product predictions. Since most of these genes diverged after the divergence of the ancestors of rice and Arabidopsis thaliana, only a few of their functions could be implied from those of GH1 enzymes from Arabidopsis and other dicots. This implies that analysis of GH1 enzymes in monocots is necessary to understand their function in the major grain crops. To begin this analysis, Os4bglu12 beta-glucosidase was characterized and found to have high exoglucanase activity, consistent with a role in cell wall metabolism.
f-66-00320.pdf	Expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of rice (Oryza sativa L.) Os4BGlu12 beta-glucosidase	2010	Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struct Biol Cryst Commun	School of Biochemistry, Institute of Science, Suranaree University of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima 30000, Thailand.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Os4BGlu12, a glycoside hydrolase family 1 beta-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21), was expressed as a fusion protein with an N-terminal thioredoxin/His(6) tag in Escherichia coli strain Origami B (DE3) and purified with subsequent removal of the N-terminal tag. Native Os4BGlu12 and its complex with 2,4-dinitrophenyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-D-glucopyranoside (DNP2FG) were crystallized using 19% polyethylene glycol (3350 or 2000, respectively) in 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 0.16 M NaCl at 288 K. Diffraction data sets for the apo and inhibitor-bound forms were collected to 2.50 and 2.45 A resolution, respectively. The space group and the unit-cell parameters of the crystal indicated the presence of two molecules per asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of 50%. The structure of Os4BGlu12 was successfully solved in space group P4(3)2(1)2 by molecular replacement using the white clover cyanogenic beta-glucosidase structure (PDB code 1cbg) as a search model.
