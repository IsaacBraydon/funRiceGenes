Os3BGlu7	seed	Rice family GH1 glycoside hydrolases with beta-D-glucosidase and beta-D-mannosidase activities	Rice BGlu1, hereafter designated Os3BGlu7 to be consistent with the names of other rice isoenzymes, is another rice b-D-glucosidase, which is highly expressed in germinating seed, shoot, and flower, and is also specific to (1,3)- and (1,4)-b-D-linked glucooligosaccharides
