Os1-CysPrxA|PER1A	root	Comparative Expression Analysis of Rice and Arabidopsis Peroxiredoxin Genes Suggests Conserved or Diversified Roles Between the Two Species and Leads to the Identification of Tandemly Duplicated Rice Peroxiredoxin Genes Differentially Expressed in Seeds.	 Our GUS expression data from developing seeds and those that were germinating indicated that Os1-CysPrxB is involved in root development, as initiated from the embryo, while Os1-CysPrxA has roles in regulating endosperm development near the aleurone layer

Os1-CysPrxA|PER1A	seed	A multiomic study uncovers a bZIP23-PER1A-mediated detoxification pathway to enhance seed vigor in rice.	 Similarly, overexpression and knockout of PER1A that encodes a key player in the detoxification pathway enhanced and decreased seed vigor, respectively
Os1-CysPrxA|PER1A	seed	A multiomic study uncovers a bZIP23-PER1A-mediated detoxification pathway to enhance seed vigor in rice.	 We further demonstrated a direct interaction of the PER1A promoter with bZIP23 in seeds, which activates the expression of PER1A, and the genetic evidence suggested that bZIP23 most likely functions in a common pathway with and acts upstream of PER1A to modulate seed vigor
Os1-CysPrxA|PER1A	detoxification	A multiomic study uncovers a bZIP23-PER1A-mediated detoxification pathway to enhance seed vigor in rice.	 Similarly, overexpression and knockout of PER1A that encodes a key player in the detoxification pathway enhanced and decreased seed vigor, respectively
