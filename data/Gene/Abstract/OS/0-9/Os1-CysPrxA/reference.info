NA	Comparative Expression Analysis of Rice and Arabidopsis Peroxiredoxin Genes Suggests Conserved or Diversified Roles Between the Two Species and Leads to the Identification of Tandemly Duplicated Rice Peroxiredoxin Genes Differentially Expressed in Seeds.	2017	Rice (N Y)	Graduate School of Biotechnology &amp; Crop Biotech Institute, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, 17104, Republic of Korea.	BACKGROUND: Peroxiredoxins (PRXs) have recently been identified as plant antioxidants. Completion of various genome sequencing projects has provided each have 10 PRX members. Although significant progress has been made in understanding their biological roles in Arabidopsis, those functions in rice, a model crop plant, have not been well studied. RESULTS: We performed a comparative expression analysis of rice and Arabidopsis PRXs. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that one subgroup contains three rice and three Arabidopsis Type-II PRXs that are expressed ubiquitously. This suggests that they are involved in housekeeping functions to process reactive oxygen species (ROS). Within the second subgroup, expression of Os1-CysPrxA (LOC_Os7g44430) and AtOs1-CysPrx is conserved in seeds while Os1-CysPrxB (LOC_Os7g44440) shows a root-preferential pattern of expression. We used transgenic plants expressing the GUS reporter gene under the control of the promoters of these two tandem duplicates to confirm their meta-expression patterns. Our GUS expression data from developing seeds and those that were germinating indicated that Os1-CysPrxB is involved in root development, as initiated from the embryo, while Os1-CysPrxA has roles in regulating endosperm development near the aleurone layer. For the third and fourth subgroups, the rice PRXs are more likely to show leaf/shoot-preferential expression, while those from Arabidopsis are significantly expressed in the flowers and seeds in addition to the leaf/shoot. To determine the biological meaning of those expression patterns that were dominantly identified in rice PRXs, we analyzed three rice genes showing leaf/shoot-preferential expression in a mutant of the light-responsive 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (dxr) gene and found that two of them were significantly down-regulated in the mutant. CONCLUSION: A global expression analysis of the PRX family in rice identified tandem duplicates, Os1-CysPrxA and Os1-CysPrxB, in the 1-CysPrx subgroup that are differentially expressed in developing seeds and germinating seeds. Analysis of the cis-acting regulatory elements (CREs) revealed unique CREs responsible for embryo and root or endosperm-preferential expression. In addition, the presence of leaf/shoot-preferential PRXs in rice suggests that they are required in that crop because those plants must tolerate a higher light intensity in their normal growth environment when compared with that of Arabidopsis. Downregulation of two PRXs in the dxr mutant causing an albino phenotype, implying that those genes have roles in processing ROS produced during photosynthesis. Network analysis of four PRXs allowed us to model regulatory pathways that explain the underlying protein interaction network. This will be a useful hypothetical model for further study.
