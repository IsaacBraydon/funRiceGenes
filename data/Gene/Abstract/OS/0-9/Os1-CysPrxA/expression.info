Os1-CysPrxA	 Within the second subgroup, expression of Os1-CysPrxA (LOC_Os7g44430) and AtOs1-CysPrx is conserved in seeds while Os1-CysPrxB (LOC_Os7g44440) shows a root-preferential pattern of expression |  Our GUS expression data from developing seeds and those that were germinating indicated that Os1-CysPrxB is involved in root development, as initiated from the embryo, while Os1-CysPrxA has roles in regulating endosperm development near the aleurone layer |  CONCLUSION: A global expression analysis of the PRX family in rice identified tandem duplicates, Os1-CysPrxA and Os1-CysPrxB, in the 1-CysPrx subgroup that are differentially expressed in developing seeds and germinating seeds
