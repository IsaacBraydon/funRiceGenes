The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is the important metabolism pathway in plant. In the present study, a cDNA encoding one of the key enzymes of PPP, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase( 6PGDH), was isolated from rice and designated as Os6PGDH. The Os6PGDH encoding protein is a cytosolic isoenzyme according to the absence of plastid transit peptide at the N-terminus. The full-length cDNA of 1751 bp encodes 480 amino acids and its putative protein sequence is 94%, 84% and 83% identical to maize, spinach and alfalfa 6PGDHs respectively. Comparison of the cloned mRNA sequence with that of the genomic sequence from the Rice Genome Project showed a simple genomic organization devoid of introns in the translated region of the gene. RT-PCR experiments revealed that Os6PGDH expression was high in inflorescence, low in root and embryos but almost absent in leaves. Furthermore, Os6PGDH was up-regulated in the shoots under salt stress. It is suggested that 6PGDH in plant may play an important role in cell division and salt response.
NA	Overexpression of a Cytosolic 6-Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase Gene Enhances the Resistance of Rice to Nilaparvata lugens	2020	Plants (Basel)	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology & Ministry of Agriculture Key Lab of Molecular Biology of Crop Pathogens and Insects, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) plays an important role in plant growth and development, and plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Yet, whether the PPP regulates plant defenses against herbivorous insects remains unclear. In this study, we cloned a rice cytosolic 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene, Os6PGDH1, which encodes the key enzyme catalyzing the third step in the reaction involving the oxidative phase of the PPP, and explored its role in rice defenses induced by brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens. Levels of Os6PGDH1 transcripts were detected in all five examined tissues, with the highest in outer leaf sheaths and lowest in inner leaf sheaths. Os6PGDH1 expression was strongly induced by mechanical wounding, infestation of gravid BPH females, and jasmonic acid (JA) treatment. Overexpressing Os6PGDH1 (oe6PGDH) decreased the height of rice plants and the mass of the aboveground part of plants, but slightly increased the length of plant roots. In addition, the overexpression of Os6PGDH1 enhanced levels of BPH-induced JA, jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), and H2O2, but decreased BPH-induced levels of ethylene. Bioassays revealed that gravid BPH females preferred to feed and lay eggs on wild-type (WT) plants over oe6PGDH plants; moreover, the hatching rate of BPH eggs raised on oe6PGDH plants and the fecundity of BPH females fed on these were significantly lower than the eggs and the females raised and fed on WT plants. Taken together, these results indicate that Os6PGDH1 plays a pivotal role not only in rice growth but also in the resistance of rice to BPH by modulating JA, ethylene, and H2O2 pathways.
