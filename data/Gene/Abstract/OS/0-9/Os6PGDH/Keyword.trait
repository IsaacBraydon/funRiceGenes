Os6PGDH|Os6PGDH1	inflorescence	Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress	RT-PCR experiments revealed that Os6PGDH expression was high in inflorescence, low in root and embryos but almost absent in leaves
Os6PGDH|Os6PGDH1	salt	Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress	Furthermore, Os6PGDH was up-regulated in the shoots under salt stress
Os6PGDH|Os6PGDH1	shoot	Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress	Furthermore, Os6PGDH was up-regulated in the shoots under salt stress
Os6PGDH|Os6PGDH1	root	Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress	RT-PCR experiments revealed that Os6PGDH expression was high in inflorescence, low in root and embryos but almost absent in leaves

Os6PGDH|Os6PGDH1	leaf	Overexpression of a Cytosolic 6-Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase Gene Enhances the Resistance of Rice to Nilaparvata lugens	 Levels of Os6PGDH1 transcripts were detected in all five examined tissues, with the highest in outer leaf sheaths and lowest in inner leaf sheaths
Os6PGDH|Os6PGDH1	growth	Overexpression of a Cytosolic 6-Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase Gene Enhances the Resistance of Rice to Nilaparvata lugens	 Taken together, these results indicate that Os6PGDH1 plays a pivotal role not only in rice growth but also in the resistance of rice to BPH by modulating JA, ethylene, and H2O2 pathways
Os6PGDH|Os6PGDH1	resistance	Overexpression of a Cytosolic 6-Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase Gene Enhances the Resistance of Rice to Nilaparvata lugens	 Taken together, these results indicate that Os6PGDH1 plays a pivotal role not only in rice growth but also in the resistance of rice to BPH by modulating JA, ethylene, and H2O2 pathways
Os6PGDH|Os6PGDH1	ethylene	Overexpression of a Cytosolic 6-Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase Gene Enhances the Resistance of Rice to Nilaparvata lugens	 In addition, the overexpression of Os6PGDH1 enhanced levels of BPH-induced JA, jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), and H2O2, but decreased BPH-induced levels of ethylene
Os6PGDH|Os6PGDH1	jasmonic	Overexpression of a Cytosolic 6-Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase Gene Enhances the Resistance of Rice to Nilaparvata lugens	 Os6PGDH1 expression was strongly induced by mechanical wounding, infestation of gravid BPH females, and jasmonic acid (JA) treatment
