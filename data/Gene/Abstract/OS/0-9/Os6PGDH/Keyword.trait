Os6PGDH	inflorescence	Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress	 RT-PCR experiments revealed that Os6PGDH expression was high in inflorescence, low in root and embryos but almost absent in leaves
Os6PGDH	salt	Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress	" Furthermore, Os6PGDH was up-regulated in the shoots under salt stress"
Os6PGDH	shoot	Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress	 Furthermore, Os6PGDH was up-regulated in the shoots under salt stress
