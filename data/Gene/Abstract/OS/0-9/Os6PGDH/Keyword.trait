Os6PGDH|Os6PGDH1	inflorescence	Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress	RT-PCR experiments revealed that Os6PGDH expression was high in inflorescence, low in root and embryos but almost absent in leaves
Os6PGDH|Os6PGDH1	salt	Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress	Furthermore, Os6PGDH was up-regulated in the shoots under salt stress
Os6PGDH|Os6PGDH1	shoot	Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress	Furthermore, Os6PGDH was up-regulated in the shoots under salt stress
