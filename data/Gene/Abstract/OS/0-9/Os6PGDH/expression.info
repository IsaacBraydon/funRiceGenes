Os6PGDH|Os6PGDH1	 Os6PGDH1 expression was strongly induced by mechanical wounding, infestation of gravid BPH females, and jasmonic acid (JA) treatment |  In addition, the overexpression of Os6PGDH1 enhanced levels of BPH-induced JA, jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), and H2O2, but decreased BPH-induced levels of ethylene	 In addition, the overexpression of Os6PGDH1 enhanced levels of BPH-induced JA, jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), and H2O2, but decreased BPH-induced levels of ethylene
