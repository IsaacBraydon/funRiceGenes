NA	Rice β-Glucosidase Os12BGlu38 is Required for Synthesis of Intine Cell Wall and Pollen Fertility.	2021	J Exp Bot	Graduate School of Biotechnology and Crop Biotech Institute, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Korea.	Glycoside hydrolase family1 β-glucosidases play a variety of roles in plants, but their in planta functions are largely unknown in rice (Oryza sativa). In this study, the biological function of Os12BGlu38, a rice β-glucosidase, expressed in bicellular to mature pollen, was examined. Genotype analysis of progeny of self-fertilized heterozygous Os12BGlu38 T-DNA mutant, os12bglu38-1, found no homozygotes and a 1:1 ratio of wild type (WT) to heterozygotes. Reciprocal cross analysis demonstrated that Os12BGlu38 deficiency cannot be inherited through the male gamete. In cytological analysis, the mature mutant pollen appeared shrunken and empty. Histochemical staining and transmission electron microscopy showed that mutant pollen lacked intine cell wall, which was rescued by introduction of WT Os12BGlu38 genomic DNA. Metabolite profiling analysis revealed that cutin monomers and waxes, the components of the pollen exine layer, were increased in anthers carrying pollen of os12bglu38-1 compared with WT and complemented lines. Os12BGlu38 fused with green fluorescent protein was localized to the plasma membrane (PM) in rice and tobacco. Recombinant Os12BGlu38 exhibited β-glucosidase activity on the universal substrate p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucoside and some oligosaccharides and glycosides. These findings provide evidence that function of a PM-associated β-glucosidase is necessary for proper intine development.
