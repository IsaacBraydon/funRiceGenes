NA	Seven zinc-finger transcription factors are novel regulators of the stress responsive gene OsDREB1B.	2012	J Exp Bot	Instituto de Tecnologia Química e Biológica, Universidade Nova de Lisboa and Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnológica, Oeiras, Portugal.	Plants have evolved several mechanisms in order to cope with adverse environmental conditions. The transcription factors (TFs) belonging to the DREB1/CBF subfamily have been described as major regulators of the plant responses to different abiotic stresses. This study focused on the rice gene OsDREB1B, initially described as highly and specifically induced by cold. However, here it is shown that OsDREB1B is not only induced by low temperatures, but also by drought and mechanical stress. In order to identify novel TFs that bind to its promoter, a yeast one-hybrid system was used to screen a cold-induced cDNA expression library. Thereby seven novel Zn-finger TFs were identified that bind to the promoter of OsDREB1B. Among them, there were four Zn-finger homeodomain (ZF-HD) and three C(2)H(2)-type Zn-finger TFs. Gene expression studies showed that these TFs are differentially regulated at transcriptional level by different abiotic stress conditions, which is illustrative of the crosstalk between stress signalling pathways. Protein-protein interaction studies revealed the formation of homo- and heterodimers among the ZF-HD TFs identified, but not for the C(2)H(2)-type. Using a transactivation assay in Arabidopsis protoplasts, all the TFs identified repressed the expression of the reporter gene, driven by the promoter of OsDREB1B. This assay also showed that the dimerization observed between the ZF-HD TFs may play a role on their transactivation activity. The results here presented suggest a prominent role of Zn-finger TFs in the regulation of OsDREB1B.
NA	Homeobox transcription factor OsZHD2 promotes root meristem activity in rice by inducing ethylene biosynthesis.	2020	J Exp Bot.	 Crop Biotech Institute and Graduate School of Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Korea.	Root meristem activity is the most critical process influencing root development. Although several regulatory factors that regulate meristem activity have been identified in rice, studies on the enhancement of meristem activity in roots are limited. We identified a T-DNA activation tagging line of a zinc-finger homeobox gene, OsZHD2, which has longer seminal and lateral roots due to increased meristem activity. The phenotypes were confirmed in the transgenic plants overexpressing OsZHD2. In addition, the overexpressing plants enhanced grain yield under low nutrient and paddy field conditions. OsZHD2 was preferentially expressed in shoot apical meristem and root tips. Transcriptome analyses and qRT-PCR experiments on roots from the activation tagging line and wild type (WT) showed that genes for ethylene biosynthesis were up-regulated in the activation line. Ethylene levels were higher in the activation lines compared to the WT. ChIP assay results suggested that OsZHD2 induces ethylene biosynthesis by controlling ACS5 directly. Treatment with ACC, an ethylene precursor, induced the expression of DR5 reporter at the root tip and stele, whereas an ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor, AVG, treatment decreased that expression in both WT and OsZHD2 overexpression line. These observations suggest that OsZHD2 enhances root meristem activity by influencing ethylene biosynthesis and, in turn, auxin.
