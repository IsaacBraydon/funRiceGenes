NA	The rice resistance protein pair RGA4/RGA5 recognizes the Magnaporthe oryzae effectors AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 by direct binding.	2013	Plant Cell	INRA, UMR 385 Biologie et Génétique des Interactions Plante-Parasite, F-34398 Montpellier, France.	Resistance (R) proteins recognize pathogen avirulence (Avr) proteins by direct or indirect binding and are multidomain proteins generally carrying a nucleotide binding (NB) and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. Two NB-LRR protein-coding genes from rice (Oryza sativa), RGA4 and RGA5, were found to be required for the recognition of the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR1-CO39. RGA4 and RGA5 also mediate recognition of the unrelated M. oryzae effector AVR-Pia, indicating that the corresponding R proteins possess dual recognition specificity. For RGA5, two alternative transcripts, RGA5-A and RGA5-B, were identified. Genetic analysis showed that only RGA5-A confers resistance, while RGA5-B is inactive. Yeast two-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging experiments revealed direct binding of AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 to RGA5-A, providing evidence for the recognition of multiple Avr proteins by direct binding to a single R protein. Direct binding seems to be required for resistance as an inactive AVR-Pia allele did not bind RGA5-A. A small Avr interaction domain with homology to the Avr recognition domain in the rice R protein Pik-1 was identified in the C terminus of RGA5-A. This reveals a mode of Avr protein recognition through direct binding to a novel, non-LRR interaction domain.
NA	A multifaceted genomics approach allows the isolation of the rice Pia-blast resistance gene consisting of two adjacent NBS-LRR protein genes.	2011	Plant J	Iwate Biotechnology Research Center, Kitakami, Iwate 024-0003, Japan.	The Oryza sativa (rice) resistance gene Pia confers resistance to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae carrying the AVR-Pia avirulence gene. To clone Pia, we employed a multifaceted genomics approach. First, we selected 12 R-gene analog (RGA) genes encoding nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeats (NBS-LRRs) proteins from a region on chromosome 11 that shows linkage to Pia. By using seven rice accessions, we examined the association between Pia phenotypes and DNA polymorphisms in the 10 genes, which revealed three genes (Os11gRGA3-Os11gRGA5) exhibiting a perfect association with the Pia phenotypes. We also screened ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-treated mutant lines of the rice cultivar &#39;Sasanishiki&#39; harboring Pia, and isolated two mutants that lost the Pia phenotype. DNA sequencing of Os11gRGA3-Os11gRGA5 from the two mutant lines identified independent mutations of major effects in Os11gRGA4. The wild-type &#39;Sasanishiki&#39; allele of Os11gRGA4 (SasRGA4) complemented Pia function in both mutants, suggesting that SasRGA4 is necessary for Pia function. However, when the rice cultivar &#39;Himenomochi&#39; lacking Pia was transfected with SasRGA4, the Pia phenotype was not recovered. An additional complementation study revealed that the two NBS-LRR-type R genes, SasRGA4 and SasRGA5, that are located next to each other and oriented in the opposite direction are necessary for Pia function. A population genetics analysis of SasRGA4 and SasRGA5 suggests that the two genes are under long-term balancing selection.
