NA	Evolutionarily Distinct BAHD N-Acyltransferases Are Responsible for Natural Variation of Aromatic Amine Conjugates in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Phenolamides (PAs) are specialized (secondary) metabolites mainly synthesized by BAHD N-acyltransferases. Here, we report metabolic profiling coupled with association and linkage mapping of 11 PAs in rice (Oryza sativa). We identified 22 loci affecting PAs in leaves and 16 loci affecting PAs in seeds. We identified eight BAHD N-acyltransferases located on five chromosomes with diverse specificities, including four aromatic amine N-acyltransferases. We show that genetic variation in PAs is determined, at least in part, by allelic variation in the tissue specificity of expression of the BAHD genes responsible for their biosynthesis. Tryptamine hydroxycinnamoyl transferase 1/2 (Os-THT1/2) and tryptamine benzoyl transferase 1/2 (Os-TBT1/2) were found to be bifunctional tryptamine/tyramine N-acyltransferases. The specificity of Os-THT1 and Os-TBT1 for agmatine involved four tandem arginine residues, which have not been identified as specificity determinants for other plant BAHD transferases, illustrating the versatility of plant BAHD transferases in acquiring new acyl acceptor specificities. With phylogenetic analysis, we identified both divergent and convergent evolution of N-acyltransferases in plants, and we suggest that the BAHD family of tryptamine/tyramine N-acyltransferases evolved conservatively in monocots, especially in Gramineae. Our work demonstrates that omics-assisted gene-to-metabolite analysis provides a useful tool for bulk gene identification and crop genetic improvement.
NA	Function of hydroxycinnamoyl transferases for the biosynthesis of phenolamides in rice resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae.	2022	J Genet Genomics	College of Agronomy, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha 410128, China; State Key Laboratory for Biology of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests, Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100193, China.	Phenolamide (PA) metabolites play important roles in the interaction between plants and pathogens. The putrescine hydroxycinnamoyl transferase genes OsPHT3 and OsPHT4 positively regulate rice cell death and resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae. The bZIP transcription factor APIP5, a negative regulator of cell death and rice immunity, directly binds to the OsPHT4 promoter to regulate putrescine-derived PAs. Whether other hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HT) genes also participate in APIP5-mediated immunity remains unclear. Surprisingly, we found that genes encoding agmatine hydroxycinnamoyl transferases OsAHT1 and OsAHT2; tryptamine hydroxycinnamoyl transferases OsTBT1 and OsTBT2; and tyramine hydroxycinnamoyl transferases OsTHT1 and OsTHT2, responsible for the biosynthesis of polyamine-derived PAs were all up-regulated in APIP5-RNAi transgenic plants compared with segregated wild-type rice. Furthermore, both OsAHT1/2 and OsTBT1/2 were induced during M. oryzae infection, showing expression patterns similar to those previously reported for OsTHT1/2 and OsPHT3/4. Transgenic plants overexpressing either OsAHT2-GFP or OsTBT1-GFP showed enhanced resistance against M. oryzae and accumulated more PA metabolites and lignin compared with wild-type plants. Interestingly, as demonstrated for OsPHT4, APIP5 directly bound to the promoters of OsAHT1/2, OsTBT1/2, and OsTHT1/2, repressing their transcription. Together, these results indicate that the HT genes are common targets of APIP5 and that PAs play critical roles in rice immunity.
