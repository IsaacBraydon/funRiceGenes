NA	Conversion of carlactone to carlactonoic acid is a conserved function of MAX1 homologs in strigolactone biosynthesis.	2018	New Phytol	Center for Bioscience Research and Education, Utsunomiya University, Utsunomiya, 321-8505, Japan.	Strigolactones (SLs) are a class of plant hormones which regulate shoot branching and function as host recognition signals for symbionts and parasites in the rhizosphere. However, steps in SL biosynthesis after carlactone (CL) formation remain elusive. This study elucidated the common and diverse functions of MAX1 homologs which catalyze CL oxidation. We have reported previously that ArabidopsisMAX1 converts CL to carlactonoic acid (CLA), whereas a rice MAX1 homolog has been shown to catalyze the conversion of CL to 4-deoxyorobanchol (4DO). To determine which reaction is conserved in the plant kingdom, we investigated the enzymatic function of MAX1 homologs in Arabidopsis, rice, maize, tomato, poplar and Selaginella moellendorffii. The conversion of CL to CLA was found to be a common reaction catalyzed by MAX1 homologs, and MAX1s can be classified into three types: A1-type, converting CL to CLA; A2-type, converting CL to 4DO via CLA; and A3-type, converting CL to CLA and 4DO to orobanchol. CLA was detected in root exudates from poplar and Selaginella, but not ubiquitously in other plants examined in this study, suggesting its role as a species-specific signal in the rhizosphere. This study provides new insights into the roles of MAX1 in endogenous and rhizosphere signaling.
NA	A role for more axillary growth1 (MAX1) in evolutionary diversity in strigolactone signaling upstream of MAX2.	2013	Plant Physiol	Department of Biology, University of York, York YO10 5DD, United Kingdom.	Strigolactones (SLs) are carotenoid-derived phytohormones with diverse roles. They are secreted from roots as attractants for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and have a wide range of endogenous functions, such as regulation of root and shoot system architecture. To date, six genes associated with SL synthesis and signaling have been molecularly identified using the shoot-branching mutants more axillary growth (max) of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and dwarf (d) of rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we present a phylogenetic analysis of the MAX/D genes to clarify the relationships of each gene with its wider family and to allow the correlation of events in the evolution of the genes with the evolution of SL function. Our analysis suggests that the notion of a distinct SL pathway is inappropriate. Instead, there may be a diversity of SL-like compounds, the response to which requires a D14/D14-like protein. This ancestral system could have been refined toward distinct ligand-specific pathways channeled through MAX2, the most downstream known component of SL signaling. MAX2 is tightly conserved among land plants and is more diverged from its nearest sister clade than any other SL-related gene, suggesting a pivotal role in the evolution of SL signaling. By contrast, the evidence suggests much greater flexibility upstream of MAX2. The MAX1 gene is a particularly strong candidate for contributing to diversification of inputs upstream of MAX2. Our functional analysis of the MAX1 family demonstrates the early origin of its catalytic function and both redundancy and functional diversification associated with its duplication in angiosperm lineages.
NA	Fertilization controls tiller numbers via transcriptional regulation of a MAX1-like gene in rice cultivation.	2023	Nat Commun	Lab. of Plant Breeding &amp; Genetics, Department of Agricultural and Environmental Biology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.	Fertilization controls various aspects of cereal growth such as tiller number, leaf size, and panicle size. However, despite such benefits, global chemical fertilizer use must be reduced to achieve sustainable agriculture. Here, based on field transcriptome data from leaf samples collected during rice cultivation, we identify fertilizer responsive genes and focus on Os1900, a gene orthologous to Arabidopsis thaliana MAX1, which is involved in strigolactone biosynthesis. Elaborate genetic and biochemical analyses using CRISPR/Cas9 mutants reveal that Os1900 together with another MAX1-like gene, Os5100, play a critical role in controlling the conversion of carlactone into carlactonoic acid during strigolactone biosynthesis and tillering in rice. Detailed analyses of a series of Os1900 promoter deletion mutations suggest that fertilization controls tiller number in rice through transcriptional regulation of Os1900, and that a few promoter mutations alone can increase tiller numbers and grain yields even under minor-fertilizer conditions, whereas a single defective os1900 mutation does not increase tillers under normal fertilizer condition. Such Os1900 promoter mutations have potential uses in breeding programs for sustainable rice production.
NA	Disruption of the cytochrome CYP711A5 gene reveals MAX1 redundancy in rice strigolactone biosynthesis.	2023	J Plant Physiol	The BioActives Lab, Center for Desert Agriculture, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia.	Strigolactones (SLs) inhibit shoot branching/tillering and are secreted by plant roots as a signal to attract symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi in the rhizosphere, particularly under phosphate starvation. However, SLs are also hijacked by root parasitic weeds as inducer for the germination of their seeds. There are around 35 natural SLs divided, based on their structures, into canonical and non-canonical SLs. Cytochrome P450 enzymes of the 711 clade, such as MORE AXILLARY GROWTH1 (MAX1) in Arabidopsis, are a major driver of SL structural diversity. Monocots, such as rice, contain several MAX1 homologs that participate in SL biosynthesis. To investigate the function of OsMAX1-1900 in planta, we generated CRISPR/Cas9 mutants disrupted in the corresponding gene. Characterizing of the generated mutants at metabolite and phenotype level suggests that OsMAX1-1900 loss-of-function does neither affect the SL pattern nor rice architecture, indicating functional redundancy among rice MAX1 homologs.
