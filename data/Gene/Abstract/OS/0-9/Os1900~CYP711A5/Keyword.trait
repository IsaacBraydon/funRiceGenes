Os1900|CYP711A5	tillering	Fertilization controls tiller numbers via transcriptional regulation of a MAX1-like gene in rice cultivation.	 Elaborate genetic and biochemical analyses using CRISPR/Cas9 mutants reveal that Os1900 together with another MAX1-like gene, Os5100, play a critical role in controlling the conversion of carlactone into carlactonoic acid during strigolactone biosynthesis and tillering in rice
Os1900|CYP711A5	grain	Fertilization controls tiller numbers via transcriptional regulation of a MAX1-like gene in rice cultivation.	 Detailed analyses of a series of Os1900 promoter deletion mutations suggest that fertilization controls tiller number in rice through transcriptional regulation of Os1900, and that a few promoter mutations alone can increase tiller numbers and grain yields even under minor-fertilizer conditions, whereas a single defective os1900 mutation does not increase tillers under normal fertilizer condition
