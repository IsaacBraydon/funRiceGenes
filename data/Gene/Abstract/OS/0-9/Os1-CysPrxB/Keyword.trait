Os1-CysPrxB	root	Comparative Expression Analysis of Rice and Arabidopsis Peroxiredoxin Genes Suggests Conserved or Diversified Roles Between the Two Species and Leads to the Identification of Tandemly Duplicated Rice Peroxiredoxin Genes Differentially Expressed in Seeds.	 Our GUS expression data from developing seeds and those that were germinating indicated that Os1-CysPrxB is involved in root development, as initiated from the embryo, while Os1-CysPrxA has roles in regulating endosperm development near the aleurone layer
