Os_SMK1|Os_Smk1|SMK1	seed phenotype	Small kernel 1 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein required for mitochondrial nad7 transcript editing and seed development in maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa) 	This result indicates that the loss of Os_Smk1 function in rice causes a chalky and shrunken seed phenotype, similar to the small kernel phenotype in smk1 mutants in maize.
Os_SMK1|Os_Smk1|SMK1	seed development	Small kernel 1 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein required for mitochondrial nad7 transcript editing and seed development in maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa) 	The mutant phenotypic analysis indicates that Os_Smk1 is required for seed development in rice.
