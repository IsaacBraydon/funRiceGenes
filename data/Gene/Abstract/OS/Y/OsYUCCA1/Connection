DAO	OsYUCCA1|OsYUC1	A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice	Furthermore, exogenous application of IAA or overexpression of the auxin biosynthesis gene OsYUCCA1 phenocopies the dao mutants
OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7	OsYUCCA1|OsYUC1	Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMO(t) in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase	OsFMO(t) showed high amino acid sequence identity with FMO proteins from other plants, in particular with YUCCA from Arabidopsis, FLOOZY from Petunia, and OsYUCCA1 from rice
OsYUCCA1|OsYUC1	TDD1|OASB1	A rice tryptophan deficient dwarf mutant, tdd1, contains a reduced level of indole acetic acid and develops abnormal flowers and organless embryos	Trp feeding completely rescued the mutant phenotypes and moderate expression of OsYUCCA1, which encodes a key enzyme in Trp-dependent IAA biosynthesis, also rescued plant height and root length, indicating that the abnormal phenotypes of tdd1 are caused predominantly by Trp and IAA deficiency
OsARID3	OsYUCCA1|OsYUC1	OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot  meristem development in rice	Furthermore, our chromatin immunoprecipitation results demonstrate that OsARID3 binds directly to the KNOXI gene OSH71, the auxin biosynthetic genes OsYUC1 and OsYUC6, and the cytokinin biosynthetic genes OsIPT2 and OsIPT7.

OsYUCCA1|OsYUC1	WOX11	The YUCCA-Auxin-WOX11 Module Controls Crown Root Development in Rice.	 Furthermore, we show that WOX11 expression is induced in OsYUC1 overexpression lines, but is repressed in the taa1 mutants
OsNIT1	OsYUCCA1|OsYUC1	Calcium lignosulfonate improves proliferation of recalcitrant indica rice callus via modulation of auxin biosynthesis and enhancement of nutrient absorption	 Both, auxin related genes (OsNIT1, OsTAA1 and OsYUC1) and tryptophan biosynthesis proteins were upregulated in CaLS-treated calli which corroborated with increased of endogenous auxin content
