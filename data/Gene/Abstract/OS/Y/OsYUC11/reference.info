j.1399-3054.2012.01649.x.pdf	A large increase in IAA during development of rice grains correlates with the expression of tryptophan aminotransferase OsTAR1 and a grain-specific YUCCA	2012	Physiol Plant	Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of New England, Armidale, New South Wales, Australia.	The indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content of developing grains of Oryza sativa subsp. japonica was measured by combined liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry in multiple-reaction-monitoring mode. The increase from 50 ng g(-1) fresh weight to 2.9 microg g(-1) fresh weight from 1 to 14 days after pollination was much larger than that previously reported by enzyme-linked immunoassay methods. The largest increase in IAA content coincided with the start of the major starch deposition phase of grain-fill. The increase in IAA content was strongly correlated with the expression of putative IAA biosynthesis genes, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and OsTAR1, measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. These results confirm the importance of the tryptophan aminotransferase/YUCCA pathway in this system. All three genes were expressed in endosperm; expression of OsYUC11 appeared to be confined to endosperm tissue. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that OsYUC11 and AtYUC10 belong to a separate clade of YUCCAs, which do not have orthologues outside the Angiosperms. This clade may have evolved with a specific role in endosperm. Expression of tryptophan decarboxylase in developing rice grains did not correlate with IAA levels, indicating that tryptamine is unlikely to be important for IAA synthesis in this system. In light of these observations, we hypothesize that IAA production in developing rice grains is controlled via expression of OsTAR1, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and that IAA may be important during starch deposition in addition to its previously suggested role early in grain development.
NA	RGB1 Regulates Grain Development and Starch Accumulation Through Its Effect on OsYUC11-Mediated Auxin Biosynthesis in Rice Endosperm Cells 	2021	Front Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Molecular Design for Plant Cell Factory of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China.	RGB1, a subunit of heterotrimeric G protein, plays important roles in regulating grain size and weight of rice. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying controlling grain filling process by G protein are still largely unclear. In the present study, we show that RGB1 controls not only the grain size but also the grain filling process. Knock-down of RGB1 significantly delayed grain development and reduced starch accumulation and grain weight, which was closely related to the delayed and the lower expression of genes encoding sucrose metabolism and starch biosynthesis related enzymes during grain filling stage. Suppression of RGB1 expression also resulted in the lower auxin content in grains, which was correlated with the lower expression of OsNF-YB1 and OsYUC11 during grain filling stage. Further biochemical evidence showed that OsYUC11 expression was under control of OsNF-YB1 by its interaction with promoter of OsYUC11. Taken together, we propose that RGB1 controls rice grain development and grain filling process by changing auxin homeostasis in endosperm cells. OsNF-YB1, which acts as a key downstream effector of RGB1, interacts directly with the promoter of OsYUC11 and stimulates the OsYUC11 expression, thereby regulating auxin biosynthesis and starch accumulation and grain size. 
NA	OsYUC11-mediated auxin biosynthesis is essential for endosperm development of rice	2021	Plant Physiol	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology, College of Agriculture, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, China.	Auxin is a phytohormone essential for plant development. However, our understanding of auxin-regulated endosperm development remains limited. Here, we described rice YUCCA (YUC) flavin-containing monooxygenase encoding gene OsYUC11 as a key contributor to auxin biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm. Grain filling or storage product accumulation was halted by mutation of OsYUC11, but the deficiencies could be recovered by the exogenous application of auxin. A rice transcription factor (TF) yeast library was screened, and 41 TFs that potentially bind to the OsYUC11 promoter were identified, of which OsNF-YB1, a member of the nuclear factor Y family, is predominantly expressed in the endosperm. Both osyuc11 and osnf-yb1 mutants exhibited reduced seed size and increased chalkiness, accompanied by a reduction in indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis. OsNF-YB1 can bind the OsYUC11 promoter to induce gene expression in vivo. We also found that OsYUC11 was a dynamically imprinted gene that predominantly expressed the paternal allele in the endosperm up to 10 d after fertilization (DAF) but then became a non-imprinted gene at 15 DAF. A functional maternal allele of OsYUC11 was able to recover the paternal defects of this gene. Overall, the findings indicate that OsYUC11-mediated auxin biosynthesis is essential for endosperm development in rice.
