OsYUC11	OsYUC9	A large increase in IAA during development of rice grains correlates with the expression of tryptophan aminotransferase OsTAR1 and a grain-specific YUCCA	The increase in IAA content was strongly correlated with the expression of putative IAA biosynthesis genes, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and OsTAR1, measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
OsYUC11	OsYUC9	A large increase in IAA during development of rice grains correlates with the expression of tryptophan aminotransferase OsTAR1 and a grain-specific YUCCA	In light of these observations, we hypothesize that IAA production in developing rice grains is controlled via expression of OsTAR1, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and that IAA may be important during starch deposition in addition to its previously suggested role early in grain development

OsNF-YB1	OsYUC11	RGB1 Regulates Grain Development and Starch Accumulation Through Its Effect on OsYUC11-Mediated Auxin Biosynthesis in Rice Endosperm Cells	 Suppression of RGB1 expression also resulted in the lower auxin content in grains, which was correlated with the lower expression of OsNF-YB1 and OsYUC11 during grain filling stage
OsNF-YB1	OsYUC11	RGB1 Regulates Grain Development and Starch Accumulation Through Its Effect on OsYUC11-Mediated Auxin Biosynthesis in Rice Endosperm Cells	 Further biochemical evidence showed that OsYUC11 expression was under control of OsNF-YB1 by its interaction with promoter of OsYUC11
OsNF-YB1	OsYUC11	RGB1 Regulates Grain Development and Starch Accumulation Through Its Effect on OsYUC11-Mediated Auxin Biosynthesis in Rice Endosperm Cells	 OsNF-YB1, which acts as a key downstream effector of RGB1, interacts directly with the promoter of OsYUC11 and stimulates the OsYUC11 expression, thereby regulating auxin biosynthesis and starch accumulation and grain size
