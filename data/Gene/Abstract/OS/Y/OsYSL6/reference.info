1832.pdf	OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan.	Yellow Stripe-Like (YSL) proteins belong to the oligopeptide transporter family and have been implicated in metal transport and homeostasis in different plant species. Here, we functionally characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) YSL member, OsYSL6. Knockout of OsYSL6 resulted in decreased growth of both roots and shoots only in the high-manganese (Mn) condition. There was no difference in the concentration of total Mn and other essential metals between the wild-type rice and the knockout line, but the knockout line showed a higher Mn concentration in the leaf apoplastic solution and a lower Mn concentration in the symplastic solution than wild-type rice. OsYSL6 was constitutively expressed in both the shoots and roots, and the expression level was not affected by either deficiency or toxicity of various metals. Furthermore, the expression level increased with leaf age. Analysis with OsYSL6 promoter-green fluorescent protein transgenic rice revealed that OsYSL6 was expressed in all cells of both the roots and shoots. Heterogolous expression of OsYSL6 in yeast showed transport activity for the Mn-nicotianamine complex but not for the Mn-mugineic acid complex. Taken together, our results suggest that OsYSL6 is a Mn-nicotianamine transporter that is required for the detoxification of excess Mn in rice.
NA	Comparative transcriptome profile analysis of rice varieties with different tolerance to zinc deficiency	2020	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	CAAS-IRRI Joint Laboratory for Genomics-Assisted Germplasm Enhancement, Agricultural Genomics Institute in Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, China.	Zinc (Zn) is an indispensable element for rice growth. Zn deficiency results in brown blotches and streaks 2-3 weeks after transplanting, as well as stunting, reduced tillering, and low productivity of rice plants. These processes are controlled by different families of expressed genes. A comparative transcriptome profile analysis was conducted using the roots of two Zn deficiency tolerant varieties (UCP122 and KALIBORO26) and two sensitive varieties (IR26 and IR64) by merging data from untreated control (CK) and Zn deficiency treated samples. Results revealed a total of 4,688 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the normal Zn and deficient conditions, with 2,702 and 1,489 unique DEGs upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis identified transcription factors (TFs), such as WRKY, MYB, ERF, and bHLH which are important in the regulation of the Zn deficiency response. Furthermore, chitinases, jasmonic acid, and phenylpropanoid pathways were found to be important in the Zn deficiency response. The metal tolerance protein (MTP) genes also appeared to play an important role in conferring tolerance to Zn deficiency. A heavy metal-associated domain-containing protein 7 was associated with tolerance to Zn deficiency and negatively regulated downstream genes. Collectively, our findings provide valuable expression patterns and candidate genes for the study of molecular mechanisms underlying the response to Zn deficiency and for improvements in breeding for tolerance to Zn deficiency in rice.
