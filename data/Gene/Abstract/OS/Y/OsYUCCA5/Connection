HL6|OsGL6	OsYUCCA5	Hairy Leaf 6, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, interacts with OsWOX3B and regulates trichome formation in rice.	 Using yeast two-hybrid assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation tests, we determined that HL6 interacts with OsWOX3B to regulate trichome formation and form a protein complex, enhancing the binding ability of HL6 with the auxin-related gene OsYUCCA5
