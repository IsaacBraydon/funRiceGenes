OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	OsYABBY6|OsYAB5	THERMOSENSITIVE BARREN PANICLE (TAP) is required for rice panicle and spikelet development at high ambient temperature.	 TAP directly promotes the expression of OsYABBY3 (OsYAB3), OsYAB4, and OsYAB5, which encode key transcriptional regulators in panicle and spikelet development
OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	OsYABBY6|OsYAB5	THERMOSENSITIVE BARREN PANICLE (TAP) is required for rice panicle and spikelet development at high ambient temperature.	 In addition, TAP physically interacts with OsYAB4 and OsYAB5 proteins; phenotypic analysis of osyab4 tap-1 and osyab5 tap-1 double mutants indicates that TAP-OsYAB4/OsYAB5 complexes act to maintain normal panicle and spikelet development
