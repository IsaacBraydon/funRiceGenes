Members of the YABBY gene family have a general role that promotes abaxial cell fate in a model eudicot, Arabidopsis thaliana. To understand the function of YABBY genes in monocots, we have isolated all YABBY genes in Oryza sativa (rice), and revealed the spatial and temporal expression pattern of one of these genes, OsYABBY1. In rice, eight YABBY genes constitute a small gene family and are classified into four groups according to sequence similarity, exon-intron structure, and organ-specific expression patterns. OsYABBY1 shows unique spatial expression patterns that have not previously been reported for other YABBY genes, so far. OsYABBY1 is expressed in putative precursor cells of both the mestome sheath in the large vascular bundle and the abaxial sclerenchyma in the leaves. In the flower, OsYABBY1 is specifically expressed in the palea and lemma from their inception, and is confined to several cell layers of these organs in the later developmental stages. The OsYABBY1-expressing domains are closely associated with cells that subsequently differentiate into sclerenchymatous cells. These findings suggest that the function of OsYABBY1 is involved in regulating the differentiation of a few specific cell types and is unrelated to polar regulation of lateral organ development.
NA	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	2017	New Phytol	Department of Biological Sciences, School of Science, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8654, Japan.	YABBY genes play important roles in the development of lateral organs such as leaves and floral organs in Angiosperms. However, the function of YABBY genes is poorly understood in monocots. We focused on three rice (Oryza sativa) YABBY genes, TONGARI-BOUSHI (TOB1, TOB2, TOB3), which are closely related to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL). To elucidate the function of these YABBY genes, we employed a reverse genetic approach. TOB genes were expressed in bract and lateral organ primordia, but not in meristems. RNAi knockdown of TOB2 or TOB3 in the tob1 mutant caused abnormal spikelet development. Furthermore, simultaneous knockdown of both TOB2 and TOB3 in tob1 affected not only spikelet, but also inflorescence development. In severe cases, the inflorescences comprised naked branches without spikelets. Analysis of inflorescence development at an early stage showed that the observed phenotypic defects were closely associated with a failure to initiate and maintain reproductive meristems. These results indicate that the TOB genes regulate the maintenance and fate of all reproductive meristems. It is likely that the function of FIL/TOB clade YABBY genes has been conserved between Arabidopsis and rice to maintain the proper function of meristems, even though these genes are expressed in lateral organ primordia.
