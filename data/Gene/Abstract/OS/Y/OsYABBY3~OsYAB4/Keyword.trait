OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	development	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	 RNAi knockdown of TOB2 or TOB3 in the tob1 mutant caused abnormal spikelet development
OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	development	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	 Furthermore, simultaneous knockdown of both TOB2 and TOB3 in tob1 affected not only spikelet, but also inflorescence development
OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	spikelet	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	 RNAi knockdown of TOB2 or TOB3 in the tob1 mutant caused abnormal spikelet development
OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	inflorescence	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	 Furthermore, simultaneous knockdown of both TOB2 and TOB3 in tob1 affected not only spikelet, but also inflorescence development
OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	spikelet development	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	 RNAi knockdown of TOB2 or TOB3 in the tob1 mutant caused abnormal spikelet development
OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	development	THERMOSENSITIVE BARREN PANICLE (TAP) is required for rice panicle and spikelet development at high ambient temperature.	 In addition, TAP physically interacts with OsYAB4 and OsYAB5 proteins; phenotypic analysis of osyab4 tap-1 and osyab5 tap-1 double mutants indicates that TAP-OsYAB4/OsYAB5 complexes act to maintain normal panicle and spikelet development
