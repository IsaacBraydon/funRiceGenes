OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	development	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	 RNAi knockdown of TOB2 or TOB3 in the tob1 mutant caused abnormal spikelet development
OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	development	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	 Furthermore, simultaneous knockdown of both TOB2 and TOB3 in tob1 affected not only spikelet, but also inflorescence development
OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	spikelet	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	 RNAi knockdown of TOB2 or TOB3 in the tob1 mutant caused abnormal spikelet development
OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	inflorescence	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	 Furthermore, simultaneous knockdown of both TOB2 and TOB3 in tob1 affected not only spikelet, but also inflorescence development
OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	spikelet development	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	 RNAi knockdown of TOB2 or TOB3 in the tob1 mutant caused abnormal spikelet development
