Graminaceous plants release ferric-chelating phytosiderophores that bind to iron. These ferric-phytosiderophore complexes are transported across the plasma membrane by a protein produced from Yellow Stripe 1 (YS1). Here, we report the characterization of OsYSL16, one of the YS1-like genes in rice. Real-time analysis revealed that this gene was constitutively expressed irrespective of metal status. Promoter fusions of OsYSL16 to beta-glucuronidase (GUS) showed that OsYSL16 was highly expressed in the vascular tissues of the root, leaf, and spikelet, and in leaf mesophyll cells. The OsYSL16-green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane. From a pool of rice T-DNA insertional lines, we identified two independent activation-tagging mutants in OsYSL16. On an Fe-deficient medium, those mutants retained relatively high chlorophyll concentrations compared with the wild-type (WT) controls, indicating that they are more tolerant to a lack of iron. The Fe concentration in shoots was also higher in the OsYSL16 activation lines than in the WT. During germination, the rate of Fe-utilization from the seeds was higher in the OsYSL16 activation lines than in the WT seeds. Our results suggest that the function of OsYSL16 in Fe-homeostasis is to enable distribution of iron within a plant.
11103_2012_Article_9930.pdf	OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron	2012	Plant Mol Biol	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Graminaceous plants acquire iron by secreting mugineic acid family phytosiderophores into the rhizosphere and taking up complexes of iron and phytosiderophores through YSL (yellow stripe 1-like) transporters. Rice OsYSL15 is a transporter of the iron(III)-2'-deoxymugineic acid complex. OsYSL16 has 85 % similarity to both OsYSL15 and the iron(II)-nicotianamine transporter OsYSL2. In the present study, we show that OsYSL16 functionally complemented a yeast mutant defective in iron uptake when grown on medium containing iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid, but not when grown on medium containing iron(II)-nicotianamine. OsYSL16-knockdown seedlings were smaller than wild-type seedlings when only iron(III)chloride was supplied as an iron source. The iron concentration in shoots of OsYSL16-knockdown plants was similar to that of the wild type; however, they showed more severe chlorosis than wild-type plants under iron-deficient conditions. Furthermore, OsYSL16-knockdown plants accumulated more iron in the vascular bundles of the leaves. Expression of the OsYSL16 promoter fused to the beta-glucuronidase gene showed that OsYSL16 is expressed in the root epidermis and vascular bundles of whole plants. The expression was typically observed around the xylem. In the vascular bundles of unelongated nodes, it was detected in the xylem of old leaves and the phloem of new leaves. Graminaceous plants translocate iron from the roots to old leaves mainly via the xylem and to new leaves mainly via the phloem. Our results suggest that OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid via the vascular bundles.
3767.pdf	YSL16 is a phloem-localized transporter of the copper-nicotianamine complex that is responsible for copper distribution in rice	2012	Plant Cell	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan.	Cu is an essential element for plant growth, but the molecular mechanisms of its distribution and redistribution within the plants are unknown. Here, we report that Yellow stripe-like16 (YSL16) is involved in Cu distribution and redistribution in rice (Oryza sativa). Rice YSL16 was expressed in the roots, leaves, and unelongated nodes at the vegetative growth stage and highly expressed in the upper nodes at the reproductive stage. YSL16 was expressed at the phloem of nodes and vascular tissues of leaves. Knockout of this gene resulted in a higher Cu concentration in the older leaves but a lower concentration in the younger leaves at the vegetative stage. At the reproductive stage, a higher Cu concentration was found in the flag leaf and husk, but less Cu was present in the brown rice, resulting in a significant reduction in fertility in the knockout line. Isotope labeling experiments with (65)Cu showed that the mutant lost the ability to transport Cu-nicotianamine from older to younger leaves and from the flag leaf to the panicle. Rice YSL16 transported the Cu-nicotianamine complex in yeast. Taken together, our results indicate that Os-YSL16 is a Cu-nicotianamine transporter that is required for delivering Cu to the developing young tissues and seeds through phloem transport.
NA	OsYSL16 is Required for Preferential Cu Distribution to Floral Organs in Rice.	2018	Plant Cell Physiol	College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Deficiency of copper (Cu) causes low fertility in many plant species, but the molecular mechanisms underlying distribution of Cu to the floral organs are poorly understood. Here, we found that a member of yellow-stripe like (YSL) family, YSL16 encoding the Cu-nicotianamine (Cu- NA) transporter, was highly expressed in the rachilla, with less expression in the palea and lemma of rice (Oryza sativa). GUS staining of transgenic rice carrying OsYSL16 promoter-GUS showed that OsYSL16 was mainly expressed in vascular bundles of rachilla as well as palea and lemma. Knockout of OsYSL16 resulted in decreased Cu distribution to the stamens, but increased distribution to the palea and lemma. A short-term (24<U+2009>h) 65Cu-labelling experiment confirmed increased Cu concentration of palea and lemma in the mutant. Furthermore, we found that redistribution of Cu from palea and lemma was impaired in osysl16 mutant after exposure to Cu-free solution. osysl16 mutant showed low pollen germination, but this was rescued by addition of Cu in the medium. Our results indicate that OsYSL16 expressed in the vascular bundles of rachilla is important for preferential distribution of Cu to the stamens, while OsYSL16 in vascular bundles of palea and lemma is involved in Cu redistribution under Cu-limited conditions in rice.
NA	Comparative transcriptome profile analysis of rice varieties with different tolerance to zinc deficiency	2020	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	CAAS-IRRI Joint Laboratory for Genomics-Assisted Germplasm Enhancement, Agricultural Genomics Institute in Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, China.	Zinc (Zn) is an indispensable element for rice growth. Zn deficiency results in brown blotches and streaks 2-3 weeks after transplanting, as well as stunting, reduced tillering, and low productivity of rice plants. These processes are controlled by different families of expressed genes. A comparative transcriptome profile analysis was conducted using the roots of two Zn deficiency tolerant varieties (UCP122 and KALIBORO26) and two sensitive varieties (IR26 and IR64) by merging data from untreated control (CK) and Zn deficiency treated samples. Results revealed a total of 4,688 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the normal Zn and deficient conditions, with 2,702 and 1,489 unique DEGs upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis identified transcription factors (TFs), such as WRKY, MYB, ERF, and bHLH which are important in the regulation of the Zn deficiency response. Furthermore, chitinases, jasmonic acid, and phenylpropanoid pathways were found to be important in the Zn deficiency response. The metal tolerance protein (MTP) genes also appeared to play an important role in conferring tolerance to Zn deficiency. A heavy metal-associated domain-containing protein 7 was associated with tolerance to Zn deficiency and negatively regulated downstream genes. Collectively, our findings provide valuable expression patterns and candidate genes for the study of molecular mechanisms underlying the response to Zn deficiency and for improvements in breeding for tolerance to Zn deficiency in rice.
