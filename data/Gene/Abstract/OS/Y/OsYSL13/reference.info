This study is to investigate rice OPT genes.
NA	OsYSL13 Is Involved in Iron Distribution in Rice.	2018	Int J Mol Sci	College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China. 2014216025@njau.edu.cn.	The uptake and transport of iron (Fe) in plants are both important for plant growth and human health. However, little is known about the mechanism of Fe transport in plants, especially for crops. In the present study, the function of yellow stripe-like 13 (YSL13) in rice was analyzed. OsYSL13 was highly expressed in leaves, especially in leaf blades, whereas its expression was induced by Fe deficiency both in roots and shoots. Furthermore, the expression level of OsYSL13 was higher in older leaves than that in younger leaves. OsYSL13 was located in the plasma membrane. Metal measurement revealed that Fe concentrations were lower in the youngest leaf and higher in the older leaves of the osysl13 mutant under both Fe sufficiency and deficiency conditions, compared with the wild type and two complementation lines. Moreover, the Fe concentrations in the brown rice and seeds of the osysl13 mutant were also reduced. Opposite results were found in OsYSL13 overexpression lines. These results suggest that OsYSL13 is involved in Fe distribution in rice.
