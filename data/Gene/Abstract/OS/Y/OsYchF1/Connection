OsGAP1	OsYchF1	An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein	 Using the OsYchF1-OsGAP1 pair from rice as the prototype, we provide evidence for the regulation of GTPase/ATPase activities and RNA binding capacity of a plant YchF (OsYchF1) by its regulatory protein (OsGAP1)| The effects of OsGAP1 on the subcellular localization/cycling and physiological functions of OsYchF1 are also discussed| The finding that OsYchF1 and OsGAP1 are involved in plant defense response might shed light on the functional roles of YchF homologues in plants
