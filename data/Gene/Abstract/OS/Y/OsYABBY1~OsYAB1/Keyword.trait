OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	floral	Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice	 Unlike the Arabidopsis YABBY genes, however, the OsYAB1 gene does not show polar expression pattern in the tissues of floral organs
OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	floral	Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice	 Our transgenic plants that ectopically expressed OsYAB1 were normal during the vegetative growth period, but then showed abnormalities in their floral structures
OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	flower	Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice	 RNA gel-blot analysis showed that the OsYAB1 gene is preferentially expressed in flowers
OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	vascular bundle	Molecular characterization the YABBY gene family in Oryza sativa and expression analysis of OsYABBY1	 OsYABBY1 is expressed in putative precursor cells of both the mestome sheath in the large vascular bundle and the abaxial sclerenchyma in the leaves
OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	lemma	Molecular characterization the YABBY gene family in Oryza sativa and expression analysis of OsYABBY1	 In the flower, OsYABBY1 is specifically expressed in the palea and lemma from their inception, and is confined to several cell layers of these organs in the later developmental stages
OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	sheath	Molecular characterization the YABBY gene family in Oryza sativa and expression analysis of OsYABBY1	 OsYABBY1 is expressed in putative precursor cells of both the mestome sheath in the large vascular bundle and the abaxial sclerenchyma in the leaves
OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	flower	Molecular characterization the YABBY gene family in Oryza sativa and expression analysis of OsYABBY1	 In the flower, OsYABBY1 is specifically expressed in the palea and lemma from their inception, and is confined to several cell layers of these organs in the later developmental stages
OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	growth	Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice	 Our transgenic plants that ectopically expressed OsYAB1 were normal during the vegetative growth period, but then showed abnormalities in their floral structures
OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	meristem	Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice	 These results suggest that OsYAB1 plays a major role in meristem development and maintenance of stamens and carpels, rather than in determining polarity
OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	vegetative	Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice	 Our transgenic plants that ectopically expressed OsYAB1 were normal during the vegetative growth period, but then showed abnormalities in their floral structures
OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	palea	Molecular characterization the YABBY gene family in Oryza sativa and expression analysis of OsYABBY1	 In the flower, OsYABBY1 is specifically expressed in the palea and lemma from their inception, and is confined to several cell layers of these organs in the later developmental stages
OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	stamen	Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice	 These results suggest that OsYAB1 plays a major role in meristem development and maintenance of stamens and carpels, rather than in determining polarity
OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	stamen	Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice	Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice
