Oshox4	OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses	 Interestingly, the expression of YAB1 that is involved in the negative feedback regulation of the GA biosynthesis was upregulated in the Oshox4 over-expressing plants
Oshox4	OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses	 One-hybrid assays showed that Oshox4 could interact with YAB1 promoter in yeast
d18|OsGA3ox2	OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	The rice YABBY1 gene is involved in the feedback regulation of gibberellin metabolism	 In this report, we show that a rice (Oryza sativa) YABBY1 (YAB1) gene had a similar expression pattern as key rice GA biosynthetic genes GA3ox2 and GA20ox2
d18|OsGA3ox2	OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	The rice YABBY1 gene is involved in the feedback regulation of gibberellin metabolism	 Cosuppression of YAB1 in transgenic plants induced expression of GA3ox2
d18|OsGA3ox2	OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	The rice YABBY1 gene is involved in the feedback regulation of gibberellin metabolism	 The repression of GA3ox2 could be obtained upon treatment by dexamethasone of transgenic plants expressing a YAB1-glucocorticoid receptor fusion
d18|OsGA3ox2	OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	The rice YABBY1 gene is involved in the feedback regulation of gibberellin metabolism	 Importantly, we show that YAB1 bound to a GA-responsive element within the GA3ox2 promoter
d18|OsGA3ox2	OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	The rice YABBY1 gene is involved in the feedback regulation of gibberellin metabolism	 Finally, either overexpression or cosuppression of YAB1 impaired GA-mediated repression of GA3ox2
OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	sd1|GA20ox2	The rice YABBY1 gene is involved in the feedback regulation of gibberellin metabolism	 In this report, we show that a rice (Oryza sativa) YABBY1 (YAB1) gene had a similar expression pattern as key rice GA biosynthetic genes GA3ox2 and GA20ox2
