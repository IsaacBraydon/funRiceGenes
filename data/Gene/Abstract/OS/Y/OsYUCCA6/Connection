OsARID3	OsYUCCA6|OsYUC6	OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot  meristem development in rice	Furthermore, our chromatin immunoprecipitation results demonstrate that OsARID3 binds directly to the KNOXI gene OSH71, the auxin biosynthetic genes OsYUC1 and OsYUC6, and the cytokinin biosynthetic genes OsIPT2 and OsIPT7.

BBM1|OsASGR-BBML1|OsBBM1	OsYUCCA6|OsYUC6	Somatic embryo initiation by rice BABY BOOM1 involves activation of zygote-expressed auxin biosynthesis genes	Together with OsBBM1-GR DEX-induction data, these results confirm that OsBBM1 directly regulates the expression of OsYUC6, 7 and 9 auxin biosynthesis genes.
