pp1431362.pdf	Auxin biosynthesis by the YUCCA genes in rice	2007	Plant Physiol	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University Chikusa, Nagoya Aichi, 464-8601, Japan.	Although indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the predominant auxin in plants, plays a critical role in various plant growth and developmental processes, its biosynthesis and regulation have not been clearly elucidated. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of IAA synthesis in rice (Oryza sativa), we identified seven YUCCA-like genes (named OsYUCCA1-7) in the rice genome. Plants overexpressing OsYUCCA1 exhibited increased IAA levels and characteristic auxin overproduction phenotypes, whereas plants expressing antisense OsYUCCA1 cDNA displayed defects that are similar to those of rice auxin-insensitive mutants. OsYUCCA1 was expressed in almost all of the organs tested, but its expression was restricted to discrete areas, including the tips of leaves, roots, and vascular tissues, where it overlapped with expression of a beta-glucuronidase reporter gene controlled by the auxin-responsive DR5 promoter. These observations are consistent with an important role for the rice enzyme OsYUCCA1 in IAA biosynthesis via the tryptophan-dependent pathway.
NA	Gibberellins modulate local auxin biosynthesis and polar auxin transport by negatively affecting flavonoid biosynthesis in the root tips of rice	2020	Plant Science	College of Life Sciences, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang, 464000, China.	As critical signalling molecules, both gibberellin (GA) and auxin play essential roles in regulating root elongation, and many studies have been shown that auxin influences GA biosynthesis and signalling. However, the mechanism by which GA affects auxin in root elongation is still unknown. In this study, root elongation and DR5-GUS activity were analyzed in rice seedlings. Paclobutrazol-induced short root phenotypes could be partially reversed by co-treatment with IAA, and the inhibition of root elongation caused by naphthylphthalamic acid could be partially reversed when plants were co-treated with GA. DR5-GUS activity was increased in the presence of GA and was reduced at the root tip of paclobutrazol-treated seedlings, indicating that GA could regulate local auxin biosynthesis and polar auxin transport (PAT) in rice root tips. Our RNA-seq analysis showed that GA was involved in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis. Flavonoid accumulation level in ks1 root tips was significantly increased and negatively correlated with GA content in GA- and PAC-treated seedlings. GA also rescued the decreased DR5-GUS activity induced by quercetin in rice root tips, confirming that flavonoids act as an intermediary in GA-mediated auxin biosynthesis and PAT. Based on RNA-seq and qPCR analyses, we determined that GA regulates local auxin biosynthesis and polar auxin transport by modulating the expression of OsYUCCA6 and PIN. Our findings provide valuable new insights into the interactions between GA and auxin in the root tips of rice.
