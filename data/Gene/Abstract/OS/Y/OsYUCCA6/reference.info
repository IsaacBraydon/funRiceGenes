pp1431362.pdf	Auxin biosynthesis by the YUCCA genes in rice	2007	Plant Physiol	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University Chikusa, Nagoya Aichi, 464-8601, Japan.	Although indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the predominant auxin in plants, plays a critical role in various plant growth and developmental processes, its biosynthesis and regulation have not been clearly elucidated. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of IAA synthesis in rice (Oryza sativa), we identified seven YUCCA-like genes (named OsYUCCA1-7) in the rice genome. Plants overexpressing OsYUCCA1 exhibited increased IAA levels and characteristic auxin overproduction phenotypes, whereas plants expressing antisense OsYUCCA1 cDNA displayed defects that are similar to those of rice auxin-insensitive mutants. OsYUCCA1 was expressed in almost all of the organs tested, but its expression was restricted to discrete areas, including the tips of leaves, roots, and vascular tissues, where it overlapped with expression of a beta-glucuronidase reporter gene controlled by the auxin-responsive DR5 promoter. These observations are consistent with an important role for the rice enzyme OsYUCCA1 in IAA biosynthesis via the tryptophan-dependent pathway.
NA	Gibberellins modulate local auxin biosynthesis and polar auxin transport by negatively affecting flavonoid biosynthesis in the root tips of rice	2020	Plant Science	College of Life Sciences, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang, 464000, China.	As critical signalling molecules, both gibberellin (GA) and auxin play essential roles in regulating root elongation, and many studies have been shown that auxin influences GA biosynthesis and signalling. However, the mechanism by which GA affects auxin in root elongation is still unknown. In this study, root elongation and DR5-GUS activity were analyzed in rice seedlings. Paclobutrazol-induced short root phenotypes could be partially reversed by co-treatment with IAA, and the inhibition of root elongation caused by naphthylphthalamic acid could be partially reversed when plants were co-treated with GA. DR5-GUS activity was increased in the presence of GA and was reduced at the root tip of paclobutrazol-treated seedlings, indicating that GA could regulate local auxin biosynthesis and polar auxin transport (PAT) in rice root tips. Our RNA-seq analysis showed that GA was involved in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis. Flavonoid accumulation level in ks1 root tips was significantly increased and negatively correlated with GA content in GA- and PAC-treated seedlings. GA also rescued the decreased DR5-GUS activity induced by quercetin in rice root tips, confirming that flavonoids act as an intermediary in GA-mediated auxin biosynthesis and PAT. Based on RNA-seq and qPCR analyses, we determined that GA regulates local auxin biosynthesis and polar auxin transport by modulating the expression of OsYUCCA6 and PIN. Our findings provide valuable new insights into the interactions between GA and auxin in the root tips of rice.
NA	The Amino Acid Transporter OsAAP4 Contributes to Rice Tillering and Grain Yield by Regulating Neutral Amino Acid Allocation through Two Splicing Variants	2021	Rice (N Y)	Key Laboratory of Plant Resource Conservation and Germplasm Innovation in Mountainous Region (Ministry of Education), College of Agricultural Sciences, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, China. zmfang@gzu.edu.cn.	Background: Amino acids, which are transported by amino acid transporters, are the major forms of organic nitrogen utilized by higher plants. Among the 19 Amino Acid Permease transporters (AAPs) in rice, only a small number of these genes have been reported to influence rice growth and development. However, whether other OsAAPs are responsible for rice growth and development is unclear.  Results: In this study, we demonstrate that OsAAP4 promoter sequences are divergent between Indica and Japonica, with higher expression in the former, which produces more tillers and higher grain yield than does Japonica. Overexpression of two different splicing variants of OsAAP4 in Japonica ZH11 significantly increased rice tillering and grain yield as result of enhancing the neutral amino acid concentrations of Val, Pro, Thr and Leu. OsAAP4 RNA interference (RNAi) and mutant lines displayed opposite trends compared with overexpresing (OE) lines. In addition, exogenous Val or Pro at 0.5 mM significantly promoted the bud outgrowth of lines overexpressing an OsAAP4a splicing variant compared with ZH11, and exogenous Val or Pro at 2.0 mM significantly enhanced the bud outgrowth of lines overexpressing splicing variant OsAAP4b compared with ZH11. Of note, the results of a protoplast amino acid-uptake assay showed that Val or Pro at different concentrations was specifically transported and accumulated in these overexpressing lines. Transcriptome analysis further demonstrated that OsAAP4 may affect nitrogen transport and metabolism, and auxin, cytokinin signaling in regulating rice tillering.  Conclusion: Our results suggested that OsAAP4 contributes to rice tiller and grain yield by regulating neutral amino acid allocation through two different splicing variants and that OsAAP4 might have potential applications in rice breeding.
