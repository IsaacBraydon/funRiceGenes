pp1431362.pdf	Auxin biosynthesis by the YUCCA genes in rice	2007	Plant Physiol	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University Chikusa, Nagoya Aichi, 464-8601, Japan.	Although indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the predominant auxin in plants, plays a critical role in various plant growth and developmental processes, its biosynthesis and regulation have not been clearly elucidated. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of IAA synthesis in rice (Oryza sativa), we identified seven YUCCA-like genes (named OsYUCCA1-7) in the rice genome. Plants overexpressing OsYUCCA1 exhibited increased IAA levels and characteristic auxin overproduction phenotypes, whereas plants expressing antisense OsYUCCA1 cDNA displayed defects that are similar to those of rice auxin-insensitive mutants. OsYUCCA1 was expressed in almost all of the organs tested, but its expression was restricted to discrete areas, including the tips of leaves, roots, and vascular tissues, where it overlapped with expression of a beta-glucuronidase reporter gene controlled by the auxin-responsive DR5 promoter. These observations are consistent with an important role for the rice enzyme OsYUCCA1 in IAA biosynthesis via the tryptophan-dependent pathway.
NA	Cadmium inhibits lateral root emergence in rice by disrupting OsPIN-mediated auxin distribution and the protective effect of OsHMA3	2020	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Cadmium (Cd) strongly inhibits root growth, especially the formation of lateral roots (LRs). The mechanism of Cd inhibition on LR formation in rice (Oryza sativa) remains unclear. In this study, we found that LR emergence in rice was inhibited significantly by 1 ¦ÌM Cd and almost completely arrested by 5 ¦ÌM Cd. Cadmium suppressed both the formation and subsequent development of the lateral root primordium (LRP). By using transgenic rice expressing the auxin response reporters DR5::GUS and DR5rev::VENUS, we found that Cd markedly reduced the auxin levels in the stele and LRP. Cadmium rapidly downregulated the expression of the auxin efflux transporter genes OsPIN1b, OsPIN1c and OsPIN9 in the stele and LPR. The emergence of LRs in a rice cultivar with a null allele of OsHMA3 (Heavy Metal ATPase 3) was more sensitive to Cd than cultivars with functional alleles. Overexpression of functional OsHMA3 in rice greatly alleviated the inhibitory effect of Cd, but the protective effect of OsHMA3 was abolished by the auxin polar transport inhibitor 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid. The results suggest that Cd inhibits LR development in rice by disrupting OsPIN-mediated auxin distribution to LPR and OsHMA3 protects against Cd toxicity by sequestering Cd into the vacuoles.
NA	RNA N(6)-methyladenosine modification promotes auxin biosynthesis required for male meiosis in rice.	2021	Dev Cell	Department of Biological Sciences and Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117543, Singapore; College of Horticulture and Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Phytohormones and Growth Development, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha 410128, China.	N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) RNA modification confers an essential layer of gene regulation in living organisms, including plants; yet, the underlying mechanisms of its deposition on specific target mRNAs involved in key plant developmental processes are so far unknown. Here, we show that a core component of the rice m(6)A methyltransferase complex, OsFIP37, is recruited by an RNA-binding protein, OsFIP37-associated protein 1 (OsFAP1), to mediate m(6)A RNA modification on an auxin biosynthesis gene, OsYUCCA3, during microsporogenesis. This stabilizes OsYUCCA3 mRNA and promotes local auxin biosynthesis in anthers during male meiosis, which is essential for meiotic division and subsequent pollen development in rice. Loss of function of OsFAP1 causes dissociation of OsFIP37 with OsYUCCA3 and the resulting abolished m(6)A deposition on OsYUCCA3. Our findings reveal that OsFAP1-dependent m(6)A deposition on OsYUCCA3 by OsFIP37 constitutes a hitherto unknown link between RNA modification and hormonal control of male meiosis in plant reproductive development.
