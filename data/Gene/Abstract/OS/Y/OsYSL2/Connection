OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059|OsPRI3	OsYSL2|CF1	Oryza sativa POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON DEFICIENCY RESPONSE 2 (OsPRI2) and OsPRI3 are involved in the maintenance of Fe homeostasis.	 Moreover, OsPRI2 and OsPRI3 directly induce expression of the metal-nicotianamine transporter, OsYSL2, by associating with the promoter in response to Fe deficiency
OsNRAMP5	OsYSL2|CF1	CF1 reduces grain-cadmium levels in rice (Oryza sativa).	 Further analysis showed that high expression levels of CF1 improve Fe nutrition in the shoots, subsequently inhibiting Cd uptake by systemically inhibiting expression of the main Cd uptake gene OsNramp5 in the roots
