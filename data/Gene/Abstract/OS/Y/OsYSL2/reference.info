J. Biol. Chem.-2008-Ogo-13407-17.pdf	A novel NAC transcription factor, IDEF2, that recognizes the iron deficiency-responsive element 2 regulates the genes involved in iron homeostasis in plants	2008	J Biol Chem	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, the University of Tokyo, 1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Iron is essential for most living organisms, and thus iron deficiency poses a major abiotic stress in crop production. Plants induce iron utilization systems under conditions of low iron availability, but the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation under iron deficiency remain largely unknown. We identified a novel transcription factor of rice and barley, IDEF2, which specifically binds to the iron deficiency-responsive cis-acting element 2 (IDE2) by yeast one-hybrid screening. IDEF2 belongs to an uncharacterized branch of the NAC transcription factor family and exhibits novel properties of sequence recognition. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay and cyclic amplification and selection of targets experiment revealed that IDEF2 predominantly recognized CA(A/C)G(T/C)(T/C/A)(T/C/A) within IDE2 as the core-binding site. IDEF2 transcripts are constitutively present in rice roots and leaves. Repression of the function of IDEF2 by the RNA interference (RNAi) technique and chimeric repressor gene-silencing technology (CRES-T) caused aberrant iron homeostasis in rice. Several genes up-regulated by iron deficiency, including the Fe(II)-nicotianamine transporter gene OsYSL2, were less induced by iron deficiency in the RNAi rice of IDEF2, suggesting that IDEF2 is involved in the regulation of these genes. Many genes with repressed expression in IDEF2 RNAi rice possessed the IDEF2-binding core sites in their promoters, and the flanking sequences were also highly homologous to IDE2. IDEF2 bound to OsYSL2 promoter region containing the binding core site, suggesting direct regulation of OsYSL2 expression. These results reveal novel cis-element/trans-factor interactions functionally associated with iron homeostasis.
j.1365-313X.2004.02146.x.pdf	OsYSL2 is a rice metal-nicotianamine transporter that is regulated by iron and expressed in the phloem	2004	Plant J	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	We identified 18 putative yellow stripe 1 (YS1)-like genes (OsYSLs) in the rice genome that exhibited 36-76% sequence similarity to maize iron(III)-phytosiderophore transporter YS1. Of particular interest was OsYSL2, the transcripts of which were not detected in the roots of either iron-sufficient or iron-deficient plants, but dramatic expression was induced in the leaves by iron deficiency. Based on the nucleotide sequence, OsYSL2 was predicted to encode a polypeptide of 674 amino acids containing 14 putative transmembrane domains. OsYSL2:green fluorescent protein (GFP) was localized in the plasma membrane of onion epidermal cells. Promoter:beta-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis revealed that OsYSL2 was expressed in companion cells in iron-sufficient roots. GUS activity was increased in companion cells, but no GUS staining was observed in epidermal or cortex cells, even in iron-deficient roots. In the leaves and leaf sheaths of iron-sufficient rice, GUS staining was observed in phloem cells of the vascular bundles. In iron-deficient leaves, the OsYSL2 promoter was active in all tissues with particularly strong GUS activity evident in companion cells. The phloem-specific expression of the OsYSL2 promoter suggests that OsYSL2 is involved in the phloem transport of iron. Strong OsYSL2 promoter activity was also detected in developing seeds. Electrophysiological measurements using Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that OsYSL2 transported iron(II)-nicotianamine (NA) and manganese(II)-NA, but did not transport iron(III)-phyosiderophore. These results suggest that OsYSL2 is a rice metal-NA transporter that is responsible for the phloem transport of iron and manganese, including the translocation of iron and manganese into the grain.
j.1365-313X.2009.04015.x.pdf	The rice transcription factor IDEF1 is essential for the early response to iron deficiency, and induces vegetative expression of late embryogenesis abundant genes	2009	Plant J	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Higher plants maintain iron homeostasis by regulating the expression of iron (Fe)-related genes in accordance with Fe availability. The transcription factor IDEF1 regulates the response to Fe deficiency in Oryza sativa (rice) by recognizing CATGC sequences within the Fe deficiency-responsive cis-acting element IDE1. To investigate the function of IDEF1 in detail, we analyzed the response to Fe deficiency in transgenic rice plants exhibiting induced or repressed IDEF1 expression. Fe-deficiency treatment in hydroponic culture revealed that IDEF1 knock-down plants are susceptible to early-stage Fe deficiency, in contrast to IDEF1-induced plants. Time-course expression analyses using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR revealed that the IDEF1 expression level was positively correlated with the level of induction of the Fe utilization-related genes OsIRO2, OsYSL15, OsIRT1, OsYSL2, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAS3 and OsDMAS1, just after the onset of Fe starvation. However, this overall transactivation mediated by IDEF1 became less evident in subsequent stages. Microarray and in-silico analyses revealed that genes positively regulated by IDEF1, especially at the early stage, exhibit over-representation of CATGC and IDE1-like elements within the proximal promoter regions. These results indicate the existence of early and subsequent responses to Fe deficiency, with the former requiring IDEF1 more specifically. Proximal regions of IDEF1-regulated gene promoters also showed enrichment of RY elements (CATGCA), which regulate gene expression during seed maturation. The expression of several genes encoding late embryogenesis abundant proteins, including Osem, was induced in Fe-deficient roots and/or leaves in an IDEF1-dependent manner, suggesting a possible function of seed maturation-related genes in Fe-deficient vegetative organs.
j.1365-313X.2010.04158.x.pdf	Rice metal-nicotianamine transporter, OsYSL2, is required for the long-distance transport of iron and manganese	2010	Plant J	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Rice (Oryza sativa) is indispensable in the diet of most of the world's population. Thus, it is an important target in which to alter iron (Fe) uptake and homeostasis, so as to increase Fe accumulation in the grain. We previously isolated OsYSL2, a functional iron [Fe(II)]- and manganese [Mn(II)]-nicotianamine complex transporter that is expressed in phloem cells and developing seeds. We produced RNAi (OsYSL2i) and overexpression lines (OXOsYSL2) of OsYSL2. At the vegetative stage in an OsYSL2i line, the Fe and Mn concentrations were decreased in the shoots, and the Fe concentration was increased in the roots. At the reproductive stage, positron-emitting tracer imaging system analysis revealed that Fe translocation to the shoots and seeds was suppressed in OsYSL2i. The Fe and Mn concentrations were decreased in the seeds of OsYSL2i, especially in the endosperm. Moreover, the Fe concentration in OXOsYSL2 was lower in the seeds and shoots, but higher in the roots, compared with the wild type. Furthermore, when OsYSL2 expression was driven by the sucrose transporter promoter, the Fe concentration in the polished rice was up to 4.4-fold higher compared with the wild type. These results indicate that the altered expression of OsYSL2 changes the localization of Fe, and that OsYSL2 is a critical Fe-nicotianamine transporter important for Fe translocation, especially in the shoots and endosperm.
Masuda-2012-Iron biofortificatio.pdf	Iron biofortification in rice by the introduction of multiple genes involved in iron nutrition	2012	Sci Rep	Global Agricultural Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	To address the problem of iron-deficiency anemia, one of the most prevalent human micronutrient deficiencies globally, iron-biofortified rice was produced using three transgenic approaches: by enhancing iron storage in grains via expression of the iron storage protein ferritin using endosperm-specific promoters, enhancing iron translocation through overproduction of the natural metal chelator nicotianamine, and enhancing iron flux into the endosperm by means of iron(II)-nicotianamine transporter OsYSL2 expression under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter and sucrose transporter promoter. Our results indicate that the iron concentration in greenhouse-grown T(2) polished seeds was sixfold higher and that in paddy field-grown T(3) polished seeds was 4.4-fold higher than that in non-transgenic seeds, with no defect in yield. Moreover, the transgenic seeds accumulated zinc up to 1.6-times in the field. Our results demonstrate that introduction of multiple iron homeostasis genes is more effective for iron biofortification than the single introduction of individual genes.
