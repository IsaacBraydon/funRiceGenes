OsYSL2|CF1	 Further analysis showed that high expression levels of CF1 improve Fe nutrition in the shoots, subsequently inhibiting Cd uptake by systemically inhibiting expression of the main Cd uptake gene OsNramp5 in the roots |  Compared with the CF1 allele from &#x27;02428&#x27; (CF1(02428) ), higher expression levels of CF1 from &#x27;TQ&#x27; (CF1(TQ) ) increased the Fe contents and decreased Cd levels in rice grains
