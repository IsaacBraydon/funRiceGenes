OsYABBY4|TOB2	sd1|GA20ox2	The rice YABBY4 gene regulates plant growth and development through modulating the gibberellin pathway.	We report on an important role for OsYABBY4 in negative control of the expression of a GA biosynthetic gene by binding to the promoter region of the gibberellin 20-oxidase 2 gene (GA20ox2), which is a direct target of SLR1 (the sole DELLA protein negatively controlling GA responses in rice)

We report on an important role for OsYABBY4 in negative control of the expression of a GA biosynthetic gene by binding to the promoter region of the gibberellin 20-oxidase 2 gene (GA20ox2), which is a direct target of SLR1 (the sole DELLA protein negatively controlling GA responses in rice)
OsYABBY4|TOB2	SLR1|OsGAI|OsSLR1	The rice YABBY4 gene regulates plant growth and development through modulating the gibberellin pathway.	OsYABBY4 also suppresses the expression level of SLR1 and interacts with SLR1 protein
OsYABBY4|TOB2	SLR1|OsGAI|OsSLR1	The rice YABBY4 gene regulates plant growth and development through modulating the gibberellin pathway.	These data together suggest that OsYABBY4 serves as a DNA-binding intermediate protein for SLR1 and is associated with the GA signaling pathway regulating gene expression during plant growth and development
OsYABBY4|TOB2	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	 We focused on three rice (Oryza sativa) YABBY genes, TONGARI-BOUSHI (TOB1, TOB2, TOB3), which are closely related to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL)
OsYABBY4|TOB2	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	 RNAi knockdown of TOB2 or TOB3 in the tob1 mutant caused abnormal spikelet development
OsYABBY4|TOB2	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	 Furthermore, simultaneous knockdown of both TOB2 and TOB3 in tob1 affected not only spikelet, but also inflorescence development
