Developmental gene families have diversified during land plant evolution. The primary role of YABBY gene family is promoting abaxial fate in model eudicot, Arabidopsis thaliana. However recent results suggest that roles of YABBY genes are not conserved in the angiosperms. In this paper, a rice YABBY gene was isolated, and its expression patterns were analyzed in detail. Sequence characterization and phylogenetic analyses showed the gene is OsYABBY4, which is group-classified into FIL/YAB3 subfamily. Beta-glucuronidase reporter assay and in situ analysis consistently revealed that OsYABBY4 was expressed in the meristems and developing vascular tissue of rice, predominantly in the phloem tissue, suggesting that the function of the rice gene is different from those of its counterparts in eudicots. OsYABBY4 may have been recruited to regulate the development of vasculature in rice. However, transgenic Arabidopsis plants ectopically expressing OsYABBY4 behaved very like those over-expressing FIL or YAB3 with abaxialized lateral organs, suggesting the OsYABBY4 protein domain is conserved with its Arabidopsis counterparts in sequences. Our results also indicate that the functional diversification of OsYABBY4 may be associated with the divergent spatial-temporal expression patterns, and YABBY family members may have preserved different expression regulatory systems and functions during the evolution of different kinds of species.
NA	The rice YABBY4 gene regulates plant growth and development through modulating the gibberellin pathway.	2016	J Exp Bot	University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yuquan Road 19, Shijingshan District, Beijing 100049, China Key Laboratory of South China Agricultural Plant Molecular Analysis and Genetic Improvement, and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Botany, South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510650, China.	YABBY genes encode seed plant-specific transcription factors that play pivotal roles in diverse aspects of leaf, shoot, and flower development. Members of the YABBY gene family are primarily expressed in lateral organs in a polar manner and function to specify abaxial cell fate in dicotyledons, but this polar expression is not conserved in monocotyledons. The function of YABBY genes is therefore not well understood in monocotyledons. Here we show that overexpression of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) YABBY4 gene (OsYABBY4) leads to a semi-dwarf phenotype, abnormal development in the uppermost internode, an increased number of floral organs, and insensitivity to gibberellin (GA) treatment. We report on an important role for OsYABBY4 in negative control of the expression of a GA biosynthetic gene by binding to the promoter region of the gibberellin 20-oxidase 2 gene (GA20ox2), which is a direct target of SLR1 (the sole DELLA protein negatively controlling GA responses in rice). OsYABBY4 also suppresses the expression level of SLR1 and interacts with SLR1 protein. The interaction inhibits GA-dependent degradation of SLR1 and therefore leads to GA insensitivity. These data together suggest that OsYABBY4 serves as a DNA-binding intermediate protein for SLR1 and is associated with the GA signaling pathway regulating gene expression during plant growth and development.
