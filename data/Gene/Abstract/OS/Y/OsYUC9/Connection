OsYUC11	OsYUC9	A large increase in IAA during development of rice grains correlates with the expression of tryptophan aminotransferase OsTAR1 and a grain-specific YUCCA	The increase in IAA content was strongly correlated with the expression of putative IAA biosynthesis genes, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and OsTAR1, measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
OsYUC11	OsYUC9	A large increase in IAA during development of rice grains correlates with the expression of tryptophan aminotransferase OsTAR1 and a grain-specific YUCCA	In light of these observations, we hypothesize that IAA production in developing rice grains is controlled via expression of OsTAR1, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and that IAA may be important during starch deposition in addition to its previously suggested role early in grain development
OsTAR1	OsYUC9	A large increase in IAA during development of rice grains correlates with the expression of tryptophan aminotransferase OsTAR1 and a grain-specific YUCCA	The increase in IAA content was strongly correlated with the expression of putative IAA biosynthesis genes, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and OsTAR1, measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction

BBM1|OsASGR-BBML1|OsBBM1	OsYUC9	Somatic embryo initiation by rice BABY BOOM1 involves activation of zygote-expressed auxin biosynthesis genes	Together with OsBBM1-GR DEX-induction data, these results confirm that OsBBM1 directly regulates the expression of OsYUC6, 7 and 9 auxin biosynthesis genes.
