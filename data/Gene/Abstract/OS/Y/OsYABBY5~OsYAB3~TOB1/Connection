NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene represses a YABBY gene expression required for rice leaf development	Here, we report the characterization of functional relationship between rice (Oryza sativa) YAB3 and WOX3 in rice leaf development
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene represses a YABBY gene expression required for rice leaf development	Rice YAB3 is closely related to maize (Zea mays) ZmYAB14 and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL), whereas rice WOX3 is highly conserved with maize narrow sheath1 (NS1) and NS2 and Arabidopsis PRESSED FLOWER (PRS)
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene represses a YABBY gene expression required for rice leaf development	Overexpression of WOX3 repressed YAB3 and showed a YAB3 RNAi phenotype
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene represses a YABBY gene expression required for rice leaf development	The expression of class I KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX (KNOX) genes was ectopically induced in leaves of YAB3 RNAi or WOX3 overexpression plants
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene represses a YABBY gene expression required for rice leaf development	Data from inducible WOX3 expression and DNA-protein interaction assays suggested that WOX3 acted as a transcriptional repressor of YAB3
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene represses a YABBY gene expression required for rice leaf development	These data reveal a regulatory network involving YAB3, WOX3, and KNOX genes required for rice leaf development
OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	Genome-wide targets regulated by the OsMADS1 transcription factor reveals its DNA recognition properties.	We show that the expression status of these nodal factors can be altered by inducing the OsMADS1-GR fusion protein and present a model for a regulatory cascade where the direct targets of OsMADS1, OsbHLH108/SPT, OsERF034 and OsHSF24, in turn control genes such as OsMADS32 and OsYABBY5
OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	 We focused on three rice (Oryza sativa) YABBY genes, TONGARI-BOUSHI (TOB1, TOB2, TOB3), which are closely related to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL)
OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	 RNAi knockdown of TOB2 or TOB3 in the tob1 mutant caused abnormal spikelet development
OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	 Furthermore, simultaneous knockdown of both TOB2 and TOB3 in tob1 affected not only spikelet, but also inflorescence development
OsYABBY4|TOB2	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	 We focused on three rice (Oryza sativa) YABBY genes, TONGARI-BOUSHI (TOB1, TOB2, TOB3), which are closely related to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL)
OsYABBY4|TOB2	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	 RNAi knockdown of TOB2 or TOB3 in the tob1 mutant caused abnormal spikelet development

OsYABBY3|OsYAB4|TOB3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	THERMOSENSITIVE BARREN PANICLE (TAP) is required for rice panicle and spikelet development at high ambient temperature.	 TAP directly promotes the expression of OsYABBY3 (OsYAB3), OsYAB4, and OsYAB5, which encode key transcriptional regulators in panicle and spikelet development
