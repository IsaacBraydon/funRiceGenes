Plant Cell-2012-Tanaka-80-95.pdf	The YABBY gene TONGARI-BOUSHI1 is involved in lateral organ development and maintenance of meristem organization in the rice spikelet	2012	Plant Cell	Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	The meristem initiates lateral organs in a regular manner, and proper communication between the meristem and the lateral organs ensures the normal development of plants. Here, we show that mutation of the rice (Oryza sativa) gene TONGARI-BOUSHI1 (TOB1) results in pleiotropic phenotypes in spikelets, such as the formation of a cone-shaped organ instead of the lemma or palea, the development of two florets in a spikelet, or premature termination of the floret meristem, in addition to reduced growth of the lemma or palea and elongation of the awn. These phenotypes seem to result from not only failure in growth of the lateral organs, but also defects in maintenance and organization of the meristem. For example, the cone-shaped organ develops as a ring-like primordium from an initial stage, suggesting that regulation of organ initiation in the meristem may be compromised. TOB1 encodes a YABBY protein, which is closely related to FILAMENTOUS FLOWER in Arabidopsis thaliana, and is expressed in the lateral organ primordia without any patterns of polarization. No TOB1 expression is detected in the meristem, so TOB1 may act non-cell autonomously to maintain proper meristem organization and is therefore likely to play an important role in rice spikelet development.
Plant Physiol.-2007-Dai-380-90.pdf	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene represses a YABBY gene expression required for rice leaf development	2007	Plant Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	YABBY and WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX (WOX) genes have been shown to play important roles in lateral organ formation and meristem function. Here, we report the characterization of functional relationship between rice (Oryza sativa) YAB3 and WOX3 in rice leaf development. Rice YAB3 is closely related to maize (Zea mays) ZmYAB14 and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL), whereas rice WOX3 is highly conserved with maize narrow sheath1 (NS1) and NS2 and Arabidopsis PRESSED FLOWER (PRS). In situ hybridization experiments revealed that the expression of both genes was excluded from the shoot apical meristem, but the transcripts were detected in leaf primordia, young leaves, and reproductive organs without any polar distribution. The function of the two genes was studied by both overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) in transgenic rice. YAB3 RNAi induced twisted and knotted leaves lacking specialized structures such as ligule and auricles, while no phenotypic change was observed in YAB3 overexpression plants, suggesting that rice YAB3 may be required for leaf cell growth and differentiation. Overexpression of WOX3 repressed YAB3 and showed a YAB3 RNAi phenotype. The expression of class I KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX (KNOX) genes was ectopically induced in leaves of YAB3 RNAi or WOX3 overexpression plants. Data from inducible WOX3 expression and DNA-protein interaction assays suggested that WOX3 acted as a transcriptional repressor of YAB3. These data reveal a regulatory network involving YAB3, WOX3, and KNOX genes required for rice leaf development.
