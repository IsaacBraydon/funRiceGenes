OsTH1	chloroplast	Vitamin B(1) THIAMIN REQUIRING1 synthase mediates the maintenance of chloroplast function by regulating sugar and fatty acid metabolism in rice.	 We also found that alternative splicing and translation allowed OsTH1 to be localized to both chloroplast and cytosol
OsTH1	growth	Vitamin B(1) THIAMIN REQUIRING1 synthase mediates the maintenance of chloroplast function by regulating sugar and fatty acid metabolism in rice.	 Our study revealed that OsTH1 was an essential enzyme in VB1 biosynthesis and played crucial roles in seedling growth and development by participating in fatty acid and sugar metabolism, providing new perspectives on VB1 function in rice
OsTH1	development	Vitamin B(1) THIAMIN REQUIRING1 synthase mediates the maintenance of chloroplast function by regulating sugar and fatty acid metabolism in rice.	 Our study revealed that OsTH1 was an essential enzyme in VB1 biosynthesis and played crucial roles in seedling growth and development by participating in fatty acid and sugar metabolism, providing new perspectives on VB1 function in rice
OsTH1	seedling	Vitamin B(1) THIAMIN REQUIRING1 synthase mediates the maintenance of chloroplast function by regulating sugar and fatty acid metabolism in rice.	 Our study revealed that OsTH1 was an essential enzyme in VB1 biosynthesis and played crucial roles in seedling growth and development by participating in fatty acid and sugar metabolism, providing new perspectives on VB1 function in rice
OsTH1	sugar	Vitamin B(1) THIAMIN REQUIRING1 synthase mediates the maintenance of chloroplast function by regulating sugar and fatty acid metabolism in rice.	 Our study revealed that OsTH1 was an essential enzyme in VB1 biosynthesis and played crucial roles in seedling growth and development by participating in fatty acid and sugar metabolism, providing new perspectives on VB1 function in rice
OsTH1	seedling growth	Vitamin B(1) THIAMIN REQUIRING1 synthase mediates the maintenance of chloroplast function by regulating sugar and fatty acid metabolism in rice.	 Our study revealed that OsTH1 was an essential enzyme in VB1 biosynthesis and played crucial roles in seedling growth and development by participating in fatty acid and sugar metabolism, providing new perspectives on VB1 function in rice
OsTH1	cytosol	Vitamin B(1) THIAMIN REQUIRING1 synthase mediates the maintenance of chloroplast function by regulating sugar and fatty acid metabolism in rice.	 We also found that alternative splicing and translation allowed OsTH1 to be localized to both chloroplast and cytosol
OsTH1	young panicles	Vitamin B(1) THIAMIN REQUIRING1 synthase mediates the maintenance of chloroplast function by regulating sugar and fatty acid metabolism in rice.	 OsTH1 encoded a phosphomethylpyrimidine kinase/thiamin-phosphate pyrophosphorylase, and was expressed in various tissues, especially in seedlings, leaves, and young panicles
