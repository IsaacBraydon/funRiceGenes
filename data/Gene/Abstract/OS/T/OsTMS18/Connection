OsMYB80|BM1|OsMS188	OsTMS18	Mutation of glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase leads to thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice and Arabidopsis.	 Further analysis showed that the tapetal transcription factor OsMS188 directly regulates OsTMS18 for pollen wall formation
OsTMS18	TMS5	Mutation of glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase leads to thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice and Arabidopsis.	 ostms18 sterility is more stable in summer than the TGMS line carrying the widely used locus tms5 in the ZH11 genetic background, suggesting its potential application for rice breeding
