OsTMS18	transcription factor	Mutation of glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase leads to thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice and Arabidopsis.	 Further analysis showed that the tapetal transcription factor OsMS188 directly regulates OsTMS18 for pollen wall formation
OsTMS18	temperature	Mutation of glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase leads to thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice and Arabidopsis.	 Cellular analysis revealed the pollen wall of ostms18 to be defective, leading to aborted pollen under high temperature
OsTMS18	development	Mutation of glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase leads to thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice and Arabidopsis.	 Under low temperature, the flawed pollen wall in ostms18 is sufficient to protect its microspore, allowing for development of functional pollen and restoring fertility
OsTMS18	fertility	Mutation of glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase leads to thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice and Arabidopsis.	 Under low temperature, the flawed pollen wall in ostms18 is sufficient to protect its microspore, allowing for development of functional pollen and restoring fertility
OsTMS18	pollen	Mutation of glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase leads to thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice and Arabidopsis.	 Cellular analysis revealed the pollen wall of ostms18 to be defective, leading to aborted pollen under high temperature

OsTMS18	sterility	Mutation of glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase leads to thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice and Arabidopsis.	 ostms18 sterility is more stable in summer than the TGMS line carrying the widely used locus tms5 in the ZH11 genetic background, suggesting its potential application for rice breeding
OsTMS18	sterility	Mutation of glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase leads to thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice and Arabidopsis.	 The ostms18 TGMS trait is caused by the point mutation from Gly to Ser in a glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductase; knockout of the oxidoreductase was previously reported to cause complete male sterility
