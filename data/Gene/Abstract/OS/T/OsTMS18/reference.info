NA	Mutation of glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase leads to thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice and Arabidopsis.	2022	Plant Biotechnol J	Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, China.	Thermosensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) lines serve as the major genetic resource for two-line hybrid breeding in rice. However, their unstable sterility under occasional low temperatures in summer highly limits their application. In this study, we identified a novel rice TGMS line, ostms18, of cultivar ZH11 (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica). ostms18 sterility is more stable in summer than the TGMS line carrying the widely used locus tms5 in the ZH11 genetic background, suggesting its potential application for rice breeding. The ostms18 TGMS trait is caused by the point mutation from Gly to Ser in a glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductase; knockout of the oxidoreductase was previously reported to cause complete male sterility. Cellular analysis revealed the pollen wall of ostms18 to be defective, leading to aborted pollen under high temperature. Further analysis showed that the tapetal transcription factor OsMS188 directly regulates OsTMS18 for pollen wall formation. Under low temperature, the flawed pollen wall in ostms18 is sufficient to protect its microspore, allowing for development of functional pollen and restoring fertility. We identified the orthologous gene in Arabidopsis. Although mutants for the gene were fertile under normal conditions (24°C), fertility was significantly reduced under high temperature (28°C), exhibiting a TGMS trait. A cellular mechanism integrated with genetic mutations and different plant species for fertility restoration of TGMS lines is proposed.
