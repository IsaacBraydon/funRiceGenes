OsTUB1	salt	OsTUB1 confers salt insensitivity by interacting with Kinesin13A to stabilize microtubules and ion transporters in rice.	OsTUB1 confers salt insensitivity by interacting with Kinesin13A to stabilize microtubules and ion transporters in rice.
OsTUB1	salt	OsTUB1 confers salt insensitivity by interacting with Kinesin13A to stabilize microtubules and ion transporters in rice.	 We found that OsTUB1 interacted with Kinesin13A protein, which was essential for OsTUB1-regulated MT organization under salt stress
OsTUB1	salt stress	OsTUB1 confers salt insensitivity by interacting with Kinesin13A to stabilize microtubules and ion transporters in rice.	 We found that OsTUB1 interacted with Kinesin13A protein, which was essential for OsTUB1-regulated MT organization under salt stress
OsTUB1	stress	OsTUB1 confers salt insensitivity by interacting with Kinesin13A to stabilize microtubules and ion transporters in rice.	 We found that OsTUB1 interacted with Kinesin13A protein, which was essential for OsTUB1-regulated MT organization under salt stress
