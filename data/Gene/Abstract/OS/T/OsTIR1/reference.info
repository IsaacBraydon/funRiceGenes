The microRNA miR393 has been shown to play a role in plant development and in the stress response by targeting mRNAs that code for the auxin receptors in Arabidopsis. In this study, we verified that two rice auxin receptor gene homologs (OsTIR1 and OsAFB2) could be targeted by OsmiR393 (Os for Oryza sativa). Two new phenotypes (increased tillers and early flowering) and two previously observed phenotypes (reduced tolerance to salt and drought and hyposensitivity to auxin) were observed in the OsmiR393-overexpressing rice plants. The OsmiR393-overexpressing rice demonstrated hyposensitivity to synthetic auxin-analog treatments. These data indicated that the phenotypes of OsmiR393-overexpressing rice may be caused through hyposensitivity to the auxin signal by reduced expression of two auxin receptor genes (OsTIR1 and OsAFB2). The expression of an auxin transporter (OsAUX1) and a tillering inhibitor (OsTB1) were downregulated by overexpression of OsmiR393, which suggested that a gene chain from OsmiR393 to rice tillering may be from OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 to OsAUX1, which affected the transportation of auxin, then to OsTB1, which finally controlled tillering. The positive phenotypes (increased tillers and early flowering) and negative phenotypes (reduced tolerance to salt and hyposensitivity to auxin) of OsmiR393-overexpressing rice present a dilemma for molecular breeding.
nph12499.pdf	Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa)	2014	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Phosphorus (P) is crucial nutrient element for crop growth and development. However, the network pathway regulating homeostasis of phosphate (Pi) in crops has many molecular breeding unknowns. Here, we report that an auxin response factor, OsARF12, functions in Pi homeostasis. Measurement of element content, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis and acid phosphatases (APases) activity assay showed that the osarf12 mutant and osarf12/25 double mutant with P-intoxicated phenotypes had higher P concentrations, up-regulation of the Pi transporter encoding genes and increased APase activity under Pi-sufficient/-deficient (+Pi/-Pi, 0.32/0 mM NaH2 PO4) conditions. Transcript analysis revealed that Pi-responsive genes--Phosphate starvation (OsIPS)1 and OsIPS2, SYG1/Pho81/XPR1(OsSPX1), Sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2 (OsSQD2), R2R3 MYB transcription factor (OsMYB2P-1) and Transport Inhibitor Response1 (OsTIR1)--were more abundant in the osarf12 and osarf12/25 mutants under +Pi/-Pi conditions. Knockout of OsARF12 also influenced the transcript abundances of the OsPHR2 gene and its downstream components, such as OsMiR399j, OsPHO2, OsMiR827, OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2. Results from -Pi/1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) treatments, and auxin reporter DR5::GUS staining suggest that root system alteration and Pi-induced auxin response were at least partially controlled by OsARF12. These findings enrich our understanding of the biological functions of OsARF12, which also acts in regulating Pi homeostasis.
nph4248.pdf	Distinctive expression patterns and roles of the miRNA393/TIR1 homolog module in regulating flag leaf inclination and primary and crown root growth in rice (Oryza sativa)	2012	New Phytol	Key Laboratory for Cell and Gene Engineering of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.	* MicroRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation of auxin signaling components plays a critical role in plant development. miRNA expression and functional diversity contribute to the complexity of regulatory networks of miRNA/target modules. * This study functionally characterizes two members of the rice (Oryza sativa) miR393 family and their target genes, OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 (AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX), the two closest homologs of Arabidopsis TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 (TIR1). * We found that the miR393 family members possess distinctive expression patterns, with miR393a expressed mainly in the crown and lateral root primordia, as well as the coleoptile tip, and miR393b expressed in the shoot apical meristem. Transgenic plants overexpressing miR393a/b displayed a severe phenotype with hallmarks of altered auxin signaling, mainly including enlarged flag leaf inclination and altered primary and crown root growth. Furthermore, OsAFB2- and OsTIR1-suppressed lines exhibited increased inclination of flag leaves at the booting stage, resembling miR393-overexpressing plants. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 interact with OsIAA1. * Expression diversification of miRNA393 implies the potential role of miRNA regulation during species evolution. The conserved mechanisms of the miR393/target module indicate the fundamental importance of the miR393-mediated regulation of auxin signal transduction in rice.
NA	Functional analysis of auxin receptor OsTIR1/OsAFB family members in rice grain yield, tillering, plant height, root system, germination, and auxinic herbicide resistance	2020	New Phytol	Institute of Genetics and Regenerative Biology, Key Laboratory for Cell and Gene Engineering of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Auxin regulates almost every aspect of plant growth and development and is perceived by the TIR1/AFB auxin co-receptor proteins differentially acting in concert with specific Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors. Little is known about the diverse functions of TIR1/AFB family members in species other than Arabidopsis. We created targeted OsTIR1 and OsAFB2-5 mutations in rice using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and functionally characterized the roles of these five members in plant growth and development and auxinic herbicide resistance. Our results demonstrated that functions of OsTIR1/AFB family members are partially redundant in grain yield, tillering, plant height, root system and germination. Ostir1, Osafb2 and Osafb4 mutants exhibited more severe phenotypes than Osafb3 and Osafb5. The Ostir1Osafb2 double mutant displays extremely severe defects in plant development. All five OsTIR1/AFB members interacted with OsIAA1 and OsIAA11 proteins in vivo. Root elongation assay showed that each Ostir1/afb2-5 mutant was resistant to 2,4-D treatment. Notably, only the Osafb4 mutants were strongly resistant to herbicide picloram, suggesting that OsAFB4 is a unique auxin receptor in rice. Our findings demonstrate similarities and specificities of auxin receptor TIR1/AFB proteins in rice, and could offer the opportunity to modify effective herbicide-resistant alleles in agronomically important crops.
NA	Auxin response factors (ARFs) differentially regulate rice antiviral immune response against rice dwarf virus	2021	PLoS Pathog	The State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.	There are 25 auxin response factors (ARFs) in the rice genome, which play critical roles in regulating myriad aspects of plant development, but their role (s) in host antiviral immune defense and the underneath mechanism remain largely unknown. By using the rice-rice dwarf virus (RDV) model system, here we report that auxin signaling enhances rice defense against RDV infection. In turn, RDV infection triggers increased auxin biosynthesis and accumulation in rice, and that treatment with exogenous auxin reduces OsIAA10 protein level, thereby unleashing a group of OsIAA10-interacting OsARFs to mediate downstream antiviral responses. Strikingly, our genetic data showed that loss-of-function mutants of osarf12 or osarf16 exhibit reduced resistance whereas osarf11 mutants display enhanced resistance to RDV. In turn, OsARF12 activates the down-stream OsWRKY13 expression through direct binding to its promoter, loss-of-function mutants of oswrky13 exhibit reduced resistance. These results demonstrated that OsARF 11, 12 and 16 differentially regulate rice antiviral defense. Together with our previous discovery that the viral P2 protein stabilizes OsIAA10 protein via thwarting its interaction with OsTIR1 to enhance viral infection and pathogenesis, our results reveal a novel auxin-IAA10-ARFs-mediated signaling mechanism employed by rice and RDV for defense and counter defense responses.
