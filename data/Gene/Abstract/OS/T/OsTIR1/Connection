OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	OsTIR1	OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 downregulation via OsmiR393 overexpression leads to more tillers, early flowering and less tolerance to salt and drought in rice	The expression of an auxin transporter (OsAUX1) and a tillering inhibitor (OsTB1) were downregulated by overexpression of OsmiR393, which suggested that a gene chain from OsmiR393 to rice tillering may be from OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 to OsAUX1, which affected the transportation of auxin, then to OsTB1, which finally controlled tillering
OsARF12	OsTIR1	Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa)	Transcript analysis revealed that Pi-responsive genes--Phosphate starvation (OsIPS)1 and OsIPS2, SYG1/Pho81/XPR1(OsSPX1), Sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2 (OsSQD2), R2R3 MYB transcription factor (OsMYB2P-1) and Transport Inhibitor Response1 (OsTIR1)--were more abundant in the osarf12 and osarf12/25 mutants under +Pi/-Pi conditions
OsSPX1	OsTIR1	Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa)	Transcript analysis revealed that Pi-responsive genes--Phosphate starvation (OsIPS)1 and OsIPS2, SYG1/Pho81/XPR1(OsSPX1), Sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2 (OsSQD2), R2R3 MYB transcription factor (OsMYB2P-1) and Transport Inhibitor Response1 (OsTIR1)--were more abundant in the osarf12 and osarf12/25 mutants under +Pi/-Pi conditions
OsAFB2	OsTIR1	Distinctive expression patterns and roles of the miRNA393/TIR1 homolog module in regulating flag leaf inclination and primary and crown root growth in rice (Oryza sativa)	* This study functionally characterizes two members of the rice (Oryza sativa) miR393 family and their target genes, OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 (AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX), the two closest homologs of Arabidopsis TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 (TIR1)
OsAFB2	OsTIR1	Distinctive expression patterns and roles of the miRNA393/TIR1 homolog module in regulating flag leaf inclination and primary and crown root growth in rice (Oryza sativa)	Furthermore, OsAFB2- and OsTIR1-suppressed lines exhibited increased inclination of flag leaves at the booting stage, resembling miR393-overexpressing plants
OsAFB2	OsTIR1	Distinctive expression patterns and roles of the miRNA393/TIR1 homolog module in regulating flag leaf inclination and primary and crown root growth in rice (Oryza sativa)	Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 interact with OsIAA1
OsIAA1	OsTIR1	Distinctive expression patterns and roles of the miRNA393/TIR1 homolog module in regulating flag leaf inclination and primary and crown root growth in rice (Oryza sativa)	Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 interact with OsIAA1
OsCYP2|OsCyp2-P|LRT2	OsTIR1	Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling	The lrt2 mutation reduces OsTIR1-OsIAA11 interaction and consequently causes the accumulation of a  higher level of OsIAA11 protein.
OsIAA10	OsTIR1	Rice Dwarf Virus P2 Protein Hijacks Auxin Signaling by Directly Targeting the Rice OsIAA10 Protein, Enhancing Viral Infection and Disease Development.	The RDV capsid protein P2 binds OsIAA10, blocking the interaction between OsIAA10 and OsTIR1 and inhibiting 26S proteasome-mediated OsIAA10 degradation
MiR390	OsTIR1	MiR393 and miR390 synergistically regulate lateral root growth in rice under different conditions.	 However, the risen expression level of miR390 induced by auxin didn't affect the expression of miR393 and its target OsTIR1 (Transport Inhibitor Response 1)
