OsThi9	tolerance	Plant Defensin-Dissimilar Thionin OsThi9 Alleviates Cadmium Toxicity in Rice Plants and Reduces Cadmium Accumulation in Rice Grains.	 OsThi9 was localized to the cell wall and was shown to bind Cd; these characters help to increase Cd tolerance
OsThi9	cell wall	Plant Defensin-Dissimilar Thionin OsThi9 Alleviates Cadmium Toxicity in Rice Plants and Reduces Cadmium Accumulation in Rice Grains.	 OsThi9 was localized to the cell wall and was shown to bind Cd; these characters help to increase Cd tolerance
OsThi9	cell wall	Plant Defensin-Dissimilar Thionin OsThi9 Alleviates Cadmium Toxicity in Rice Plants and Reduces Cadmium Accumulation in Rice Grains.	 In Cd-exposed rice plants, OsThi9 overexpression significantly increased cell wall Cd binding, decreasing upward Cd translocation and subsequent Cd accumulation in shoots and straw, while OsThi9 knockout had inverse effects
OsThi9	cadmium	Plant Defensin-Dissimilar Thionin OsThi9 Alleviates Cadmium Toxicity in Rice Plants and Reduces Cadmium Accumulation in Rice Grains.	Plant Defensin-Dissimilar Thionin OsThi9 Alleviates Cadmium Toxicity in Rice Plants and Reduces Cadmium Accumulation in Rice Grains.
OsThi9	cadmium	Plant Defensin-Dissimilar Thionin OsThi9 Alleviates Cadmium Toxicity in Rice Plants and Reduces Cadmium Accumulation in Rice Grains.	 Here, cadmium (Cd)-related functions and mechanisms of the defensin-dissimilar rice thionin OsThi9 were investigated
OsThi9	cadmium accumulation	Plant Defensin-Dissimilar Thionin OsThi9 Alleviates Cadmium Toxicity in Rice Plants and Reduces Cadmium Accumulation in Rice Grains.	Plant Defensin-Dissimilar Thionin OsThi9 Alleviates Cadmium Toxicity in Rice Plants and Reduces Cadmium Accumulation in Rice Grains.
