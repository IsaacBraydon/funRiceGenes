NA	Plant Defensin-Dissimilar Thionin OsThi9 Alleviates Cadmium Toxicity in Rice Plants and Reduces Cadmium Accumulation in Rice Grains.	2023	J Agric Food Chem	College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, People&#x27;s Republic of China.	Thionins are important antibacterial peptides in plants. However, the roles of plant thionins, especially the defensin-dissimilar thionins, in alleviating heavy-metal toxicity and accumulation remain unclear. Here, cadmium (Cd)-related functions and mechanisms of the defensin-dissimilar rice thionin OsThi9 were investigated. OsThi9 was significantly upregulated in response to Cd exposure. OsThi9 was localized to the cell wall and was shown to bind Cd; these characters help to increase Cd tolerance. In Cd-exposed rice plants, OsThi9 overexpression significantly increased cell wall Cd binding, decreasing upward Cd translocation and subsequent Cd accumulation in shoots and straw, while OsThi9 knockout had inverse effects. Importantly, in rice plants grown in Cd-contaminated soils, OsThi9 overexpression significantly reduced Cd accumulation in brown rice (decrease of â‰¥ 51.8%) without negatively impairing the crop yield and essential elements. Thus, OsThi9 plays an important role in the alleviation of Cd toxicity and accumulation and has significant potential for developing low-Cd rice.
