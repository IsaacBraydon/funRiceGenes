OSTF1	grain	OSTF1: A HD-GL2 Family Homeobox Gene is Developmentally Regulated During Early Embryogenesis in Rice	 In situ hybridization analysis on developing grains revealed that OSTF1 was strongly and uniformly expressed in the embryo at the globular stage and preferentially localized to the protoderm at 3â€<U+393C><U+3E33>6 d after pollination
OSTF1	transcription factor	OSTF1: A HD-GL2 Family Homeobox Gene is Developmentally Regulated During Early Embryogenesis in Rice	 In this study, a gene designated OSTF1 (Oryza sativa transcription factor 1) encoding a homeodomain protein in rice was isolated and characterized
