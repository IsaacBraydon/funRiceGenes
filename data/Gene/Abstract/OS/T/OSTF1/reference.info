In this study, a gene designated OSTF1 (Oryza sativa transcription factor 1) encoding a homeodomain protein in rice was isolated and characterized. The encoded OSTF1, although sharing only approximately 51% sequence identity with other HD-GL2 members, contains four characteristic motifs (an N-terminal acidic region, a homeodomain, a truncated leucine zipper, and a START domain). OSTF1 was detected as a single copy gene in rice. The transcripts were absent in young panicle or mature spikelet before anthesis, but appeared very early in the pollinated grain with a transient profile. In vegetative tissues examined, expression was only detectable in root. In situ hybridization analysis on developing grains revealed that OSTF1 was strongly and uniformly expressed in the embryo at the globular stage and preferentially localized to the protoderm at 3~6 d after pollination. Expression was also detectable in the integument and throughout the endosperm. Although OSTF1 is not closely related to the remaining HD-GL2 members in sequences, this gene exhibits an analogous epidermis-preferential expression pattern.
