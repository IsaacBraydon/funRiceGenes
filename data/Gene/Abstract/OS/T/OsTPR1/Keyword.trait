OsTPR1	immune response	Binding of the Magnaporthe oryzae chitinase MoChia1 by a rice tetratricopeptide repeat protein allows free chitin to trigger immune responses.	 OsTPR1 competitively binds MoChia1, thereby allowing the accumulation of free chitin and re-establishing the immune response
OsTPR1	reactive oxygen species	Binding of the Magnaporthe oryzae chitinase MoChia1 by a rice tetratricopeptide repeat protein allows free chitin to trigger immune responses.	 Overexpressing OsTPR1 in rice plants resulted in elevated levels of reactive oxygen species during M
