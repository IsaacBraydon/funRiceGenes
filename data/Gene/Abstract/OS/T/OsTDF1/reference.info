NA	The functional analysis of OsTDF1 reveals a conserved genetic pathway for tapetal development between rice and Arabidopsis	2015	Science Bulletin	College of Life and Environment Sciences, Development Center of Plant Germplasm ResourcesShanghai Normal UniversityShanghaiChina	During anther development, the tapetum provides materials and nutrients for pollen development. In Arabidopsis, several transcription factors have been identified to form a genetic pathway (DYT1每TDF1每AMS每MS188每MS1) for tapetal development and function. DEFECTIVE in TAPETAL DEVELOPMENT and FUNCTION1 (TDF1) is a member of the R2R3 MYB family and is essential for early tapetum development in Arabidopsis. Here, we characterized an ortholog of ArabidopsisTDF1 in rice, OsTDF1 (LOC_Os03g18480). OsTDF1 shares 69 % amino acid sequence identity with AtTDF1 in the putative MYB domain near the N-terminal region. RT-PCR and in situ hybridization show that OsTDF1 is specifically expressed in tapetal cells of rice anthers. The expression of OsTDF1 in Arabidopsistdf1 mutant restores its fertility, suggesting that this homolog can fulfill the normal function of TDF1 in Arabidopsis. The ostdf1 knockout mutant exhibits a male-sterile phenotype. Its tapetal cells exhibit a vacuolated and hypertrophic phenotype similar to that of Arabidopsistdf1 mutants. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assays revealed OsTDF1 acts as an essential regulator for tapetum programmed cell death. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that OsTDF1 acts downstream of UDT1 and upstream of TDR, EAT1, OsMYB103 and PTC1 in rice, suggesting that the genetic pathway for tapetum development is generally conserved between rice and Arabidopsis.
NA	OsMS188 Is a Key Regulator of Tapetum Development and Sporopollenin Synthesis in Rice	2021	Rice (N Y)	Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, 100 Guilin Road, Shanghai, 200234, China.	Background: During anther development, the tapetum provides essential nutrients and materials for pollen development. In rice, multiple transcription factors and enzymes essential for tapetum development and pollen wall formation have been cloned from male-sterile lines.  Results: In this study, we obtained several lines in which the MYB transcription factor OsMS188 was knocked out through the CRISPR-Cas9 approach. The osms188 lines exhibited a male-sterile phenotype with aberrant development and degeneration of tapetal cells, absence of the sexine layer and defective anther cuticles. CYP703A3, CYP704B2, OsPKS1, OsPKS2, DPW and ABCG15 are sporopollenin synthesis and transport-related genes in rice. Plants with mutations in these genes are male sterile, with a defective sexine layer and anther cuticle. Further biochemical assays demonstrated that OsMS188 binds directly to the promoters of these genes to regulate their expression. UDT1, OsTDF1, TDR, bHLH142 and EAT1 are upstream regulators of rice tapetum development. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and activation assays revealed that TDR directly regulates OsMS188 expression. Additionally, protein interaction assays indicated that TDR interacts with OsMS188 to regulate downstream gene expression.  Conclusion: Overall, OsMS188 is a key regulator of tapetum development and pollen wall formation. The gene regulatory network established in this work may facilitate future investigations of fertility regulation in rice and in other crop species.
