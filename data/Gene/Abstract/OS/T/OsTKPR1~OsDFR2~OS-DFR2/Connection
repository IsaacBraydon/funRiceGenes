OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	OsTKPR1|OsDFR2|OS-DFR2	Conserved metabolic steps for sporopollenin precursor formation in tobacco and rice	Similarly, recombinant rice OsPKS1 and OsTKPR1 were shown to function as downstream enzymes of NtACOS1
OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	OsTKPR1|OsDFR2|OS-DFR2	Conserved metabolic steps for sporopollenin precursor formation in tobacco and rice	Using fatty acids as starting substrates, sequential activities of heterologously expressed tobacco enzymes NtACOS1, NtPKS1 and NtTKPR1 resulted in the production of reduced tetraketide alpha-pyrones
OsTKPR1|OsDFR2|OS-DFR2	OsTKPR2	OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.	 We found that OsTKPR2 and OsTKPR1 share a similar expression pattern, and their coding proteins have a similar subcellular localization and enzyme activities towards reduced tetraketide α-pyrone and hydroxylated tetraketide α-pyrone
OsTKPR1|OsDFR2|OS-DFR2	OsTKPR2	OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.	 OsTKPR1 and OsTKPR2 were integrated into a metabolon including OsACOS12 and OsPKS2, which resulted in a significant increased enzymatic efficiency when both OsTKPR1 and OsTKPR2 were present, indicating the mutual dependence of OsTKPR2 and OsTKPR1 for their full biochemical activities
OsTKPR1|OsDFR2|OS-DFR2	OsTKPR2	OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.	 Furthermore, the cooperation and possible functional divergence between OsTKPR2 and OsTKPR1 is also discussed
