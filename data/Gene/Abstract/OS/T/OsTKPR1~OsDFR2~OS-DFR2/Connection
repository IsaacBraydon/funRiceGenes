OsPKS1|YY2	OsTKPR1|OsDFR2|OS-DFR2	Conserved metabolic steps for sporopollenin precursor formation in tobacco and rice	 Similarly, recombinant rice OsPKS1 and OsTKPR1 were shown to function as downstream enzymes of NtACOS1
OsPKS1|YY2	OsTKPR1|OsDFR2|OS-DFR2	Conserved metabolic steps for sporopollenin precursor formation in tobacco and rice	 Using fatty acids as starting substrates, sequential activities of heterologously expressed tobacco enzymes NtACOS1, NtPKS1 and NtTKPR1 resulted in the production of reduced tetraketide alpha-pyrones
