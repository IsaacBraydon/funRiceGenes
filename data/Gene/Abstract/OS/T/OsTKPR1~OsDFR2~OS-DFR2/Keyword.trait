OsTKPR1|OsDFR2|OS-DFR2	pollen	Ostkpr1 functions in anther cuticle development and pollen wall formation in rice.	Ostkpr1 functions in anther cuticle development and pollen wall formation in rice.
OsTKPR1|OsDFR2|OS-DFR2	pollen	Ostkpr1 functions in anther cuticle development and pollen wall formation in rice.	 Loss of function of OsTKPR1 delayed tapetum degradation, reduced the levels of anther cuticular lipids, and impaired Ubisch body and pollen exine formation, resulting in complete male sterility
OsTKPR1|OsDFR2|OS-DFR2	pollen	Ostkpr1 functions in anther cuticle development and pollen wall formation in rice.	 Localization studies suggest that OsTKPR1 accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum, while specific accumulation of OsTKPR1 mRNA in the anther tapetum and microspores is consistent with its function in anther and pollen wall development
OsTKPR1|OsDFR2|OS-DFR2	pollen	Ostkpr1 functions in anther cuticle development and pollen wall formation in rice.	Our results show that OsTKPR1 is indispensable for anther cuticle development and pollen wall formation in rice, providing new insights into the biochemical mechanisms of the conserved sporopollenin metabolon in flowering plants
