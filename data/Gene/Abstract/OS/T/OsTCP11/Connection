Ehd2|RID1	OsTCP11	Genome-wide binding analysis of transcription factor Rice Indeterminate 1 reveals a complex network controlling rice floral transition.	 Interestingly, CACGTG and GTGGGCCC, two previously uncharacterized indirect binding motifs, were enriched through the interactions of RID1 with the novel flowering-promoting proteins OsPIL12 and OsTCP11, respectively
