OsTTG1	transcription factor	RNA-seq reveals transcriptional differences in anthocyanin and vitamin biosynthetic pathways between black and white rice.	 Among 58 differentially expressed transcription factors, OsTTG1 was confirmed to be the one and only WD40 repeat protein regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in the pericarp
