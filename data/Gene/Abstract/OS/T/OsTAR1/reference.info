j.1399-3054.2012.01649.x.pdf	A large increase in IAA during development of rice grains correlates with the expression of tryptophan aminotransferase OsTAR1 and a grain-specific YUCCA	2012	Physiol Plant	Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of New England, Armidale, New South Wales, Australia.	The indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content of developing grains of Oryza sativa subsp. japonica was measured by combined liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry in multiple-reaction-monitoring mode. The increase from 50 ng g(-1) fresh weight to 2.9 microg g(-1) fresh weight from 1 to 14 days after pollination was much larger than that previously reported by enzyme-linked immunoassay methods. The largest increase in IAA content coincided with the start of the major starch deposition phase of grain-fill. The increase in IAA content was strongly correlated with the expression of putative IAA biosynthesis genes, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and OsTAR1, measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. These results confirm the importance of the tryptophan aminotransferase/YUCCA pathway in this system. All three genes were expressed in endosperm; expression of OsYUC11 appeared to be confined to endosperm tissue. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that OsYUC11 and AtYUC10 belong to a separate clade of YUCCAs, which do not have orthologues outside the Angiosperms. This clade may have evolved with a specific role in endosperm. Expression of tryptophan decarboxylase in developing rice grains did not correlate with IAA levels, indicating that tryptamine is unlikely to be important for IAA synthesis in this system. In light of these observations, we hypothesize that IAA production in developing rice grains is controlled via expression of OsTAR1, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and that IAA may be important during starch deposition in addition to its previously suggested role early in grain development.
NA	Biochemical and chemical biology study of rice OsTAR1 revealed that tryptophan aminotransferase is involved in auxin biosynthesis; identification of a potent OsTAR1 inhibitor, pyruvamine2031.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	Yokohama City University, Kihara Institute for Biological Research, Maiokacho 641-12, Totsuka, Yokohama, Kanagawa, 244-0813, Japan.	Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a major form of auxin, is biosynthesized from L-tryptophan via the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) pathway in Arabidopsis Tryptophan aminotransferases (TAA1/TARs) catalyze the first step from L-tryptophan to IPyA. In rice, the importance of TAA/TARs or YUC homologs in auxin biosynthesis has been suggested, but the enzymatic activities and involvement of the intermediate IPyA in auxin biosynthesis remain elusive. In this study, we obtained biochemical evidence that the rice tryptophan aminotransferase OsTAR1 converts L-tryptophan to IPyA, and has a Km of 82.02 ¦ÌM and Vmax of 10.92 ¦ÌM/min/mg, comparable to those in Arabidopsis Next, we screened for an effective inhibitor of OsTAR1 from our previously reported inhibitor library for TAA1/TARs, designated pyruvamine (PVM). Differing from previous observations in Arabidopsis, hydroxy-type PVMs, e.g., PVM2031 (previous name KOK2031), had stronger inhibitory effects in rice than the methoxy-type. PVM2031 inhibited recombinant OsTAR1 in vitro The Ki of PVM2031 was 276 nM. PVM2031 treatment of rice seedlings resulted in morphological changes in vivo, such as reduced lateral root density. Exogenous IAA rescued this growth inhibition, suggesting that the inhibitory effect is auxin-specific. Furthermore, rice roots showed reduced IAA levels concomitant with reduced levels of IPyA in the presence of the inhibitors, suggesting that the IPyA pathway is an auxin biosynthesis pathway in rice. Since PVM2031 showed stronger inhibitory effects on rice auxin biosynthesis than known tryptophan aminotransferase inhibitors, we propose that the hydroxy-type PVM2031 is an effective tool for biochemical analysis of the function of auxin biosynthesis in rice roots.
