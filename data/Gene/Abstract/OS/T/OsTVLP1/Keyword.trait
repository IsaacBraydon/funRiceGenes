OsTVLP1	disease	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of rice OsTVLP1, encoding a protein with similarity to TGF-β receptor interacting proteins and vacuolar assembly Vam6p/Vps39p proteins	 The expression of OsTVLP1 was induced by treatments with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical activator of plant disease resistance responses, and by infection of the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea
OsTVLP1	disease	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of rice OsTVLP1, encoding a protein with similarity to TGF-β receptor interacting proteins and vacuolar assembly Vam6p/Vps39p proteins	 Importantly, the expression of OsTVLP1 was activated specifically in disease resistance response induced by BTH and in an incompatible interaction between rice and the blast fungus
OsTVLP1	disease	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of rice OsTVLP1, encoding a protein with similarity to TGF-β receptor interacting proteins and vacuolar assembly Vam6p/Vps39p proteins	 Our observations suggest that OsTVLP1 may play a role in rice disease resistance response against pathogen infection
OsTVLP1	blast	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of rice OsTVLP1, encoding a protein with similarity to TGF-β receptor interacting proteins and vacuolar assembly Vam6p/Vps39p proteins	 The expression of OsTVLP1 was induced by treatments with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical activator of plant disease resistance responses, and by infection of the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea
OsTVLP1	blast	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of rice OsTVLP1, encoding a protein with similarity to TGF-β receptor interacting proteins and vacuolar assembly Vam6p/Vps39p proteins	 Importantly, the expression of OsTVLP1 was activated specifically in disease resistance response induced by BTH and in an incompatible interaction between rice and the blast fungus
OsTVLP1	disease resistance	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of rice OsTVLP1, encoding a protein with similarity to TGF-β receptor interacting proteins and vacuolar assembly Vam6p/Vps39p proteins	 The expression of OsTVLP1 was induced by treatments with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical activator of plant disease resistance responses, and by infection of the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea
