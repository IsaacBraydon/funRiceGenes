OsTVLP1 has an open reading frame of 2955 bp, which encodes a 984 amino acid protein, containing a citron homology (CNH) domain at its N-terminal and a clathrin heavy-chain repeat homology (CLH) domain at its C-terminal. The expression of OsTVLP1 was induced by treatments with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical activator of plant disease resistance responses, and by infection of the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea. Importantly, the expression of OsTVLP1 was activated specifically in disease resistance response induced by BTH and in an incompatible interaction between rice and the blast fungus. Our observations suggest that OsTVLP1 may play a role in rice disease resistance response against pathogen infection.
