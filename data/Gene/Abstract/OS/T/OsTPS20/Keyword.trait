OsTPS20	oxidative stress	Rice terpene synthase 20 (OsTPS20) plays an important role in producing terpene volatiles in response to abiotic stresses.	 Moreover, qRT-PCR revealed that the transcript levels of OsTPS20 were significantly induced in response to oxidative stress, thereby suggesting that OsTPS20 plays a major role in producing terpene volatiles during abiotic stress
