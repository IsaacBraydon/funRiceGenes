OsTPS19	OsTPS20	The Rice Terpene Synthase Gene OsTPS19 Functions as an (S)-Limonene Synthase in planta and its Overexpression Leads to Enhanced Resistance to the Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsTPS19 has a highly homologous paralog, OsTPS20, which likely resulted from a recent gene duplication event
OsTPS19	OsTPS20	The Rice Terpene Synthase Gene OsTPS19 Functions as an (S)-Limonene Synthase in planta and its Overexpression Leads to Enhanced Resistance to the Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	 We found that the variation in OsTPS19 and OsTPS20 enzyme activities was determined by a single amino acid in the active site cavity
OsTPS19	OsTPS20	The Rice Terpene Synthase Gene OsTPS19 Functions as an (S)-Limonene Synthase in planta and its Overexpression Leads to Enhanced Resistance to the Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	 This indicates functional divergence of OsTPS19 and OsTPS20
