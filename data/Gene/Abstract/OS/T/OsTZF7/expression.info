OsTZF7	 The expression of OsTZF7 was upregulated by abiotic stresses, including polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, NaCl, and abscisic acid (ABA) in rice |  Accordingly, the overexpression of OsTZF7 increased drought tolerance and enhanced sensitivity to exogenous ABA in rice, whereas the knockdown of OsTZF7 resulted in the opposite phenotype	 Accordingly, the overexpression of OsTZF7 increased drought tolerance and enhanced sensitivity to exogenous ABA in rice, whereas the knockdown of OsTZF7 resulted in the opposite phenotype
