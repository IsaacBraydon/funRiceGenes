Plant clock function relies on precise timing of gene expression through complex regulatory networks consisting of activators and repressors at the core of oscillators. Although TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1) has been recognized as a repressor involved in shaping oscillations and regulating clock-driven processes, its potential to directly activate gene expression remains unclear. In this study, we find that OsTOC1 primarily acts as a transcriptional repressor for core clock components, including OsLHY and OsGI. Here, we show that OsTOC1 possesses the ability to directly activate the expression of circadian target genes. Through binding to the promoters of OsTGAL3a/b, transient activation of OsTOC1 induces the expression of OsTGAL3a/b, indicating its role as an activator contributing to pathogen resistance. Moreover, TOC1 participates in regulating multiple yield-related traits in rice. These findings suggest that TOC1&#x27;s function as a transcriptional repressor is not inherent, providing flexibility to circadian regulations, particularly in outputs.
