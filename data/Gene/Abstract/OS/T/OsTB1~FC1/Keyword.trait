OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	culm	The OsTB1 gene negatively regulates lateral branching in rice	 We also demonstrated that a rice strain carrying a classical morphological marker mutation, fine culm 1 (fc1), contain the loss-of-function mutation of OsTB1 and exhibits enhanced lateral branching
OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	auxin	OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 downregulation via OsmiR393 overexpression leads to more tillers, early flowering and less tolerance to salt and drought in rice	 The expression of an auxin transporter (OsAUX1) and a tillering inhibitor (OsTB1) were downregulated by overexpression of OsmiR393, which suggested that a gene chain from OsmiR393 to rice tillering may be from OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 to OsAUX1, which affected the transportation of auxin, then to OsTB1, which finally controlled tillering
OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	branching	The OsTB1 gene negatively regulates lateral branching in rice	 We also demonstrated that a rice strain carrying a classical morphological marker mutation, fine culm 1 (fc1), contain the loss-of-function mutation of OsTB1 and exhibits enhanced lateral branching
OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	branching	FINE CULM1 (FC1) works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice	 We propose that FC1 acts as an integrator of multiple signaling pathways and is essential to the fine-tuning of shoot branching in rice
OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	cytokinin	FINE CULM1 (FC1) works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice	 On the other hand, the expression level of FC1 is negatively regulated by cytokinin treatment

OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	shoot	The OsTB1 gene negatively regulates lateral branching in rice	 Expression of OsTB1, as examined with a putative promoter-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fusion, was observed throughout the axillary bud, as well as the basal part of the shoot apical meristem, vascular tissues in the pith and the lamina joint

OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	branching	The OsTB1 gene negatively regulates lateral branching in rice	 The rice TB1 gene (OsTB1) was first identified based on its sequence similarity with maize TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1 (TB1), which is involved in lateral branching in maize| Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsTB1 exhibited markedly reduced lateral branching without the propagation of axillary buds being affected| We also demonstrated that a rice strain carrying a classical morphological marker mutation, fine culm 1 (fc1), contain the loss-of-function mutation of OsTB1 and exhibits enhanced lateral branching| Taking these data together, we concluded that OsTB1 functions as a negative regulator for lateral branching in rice, presumably through expression in axillary buds|The OsTB1 gene negatively regulates lateral branching in rice
