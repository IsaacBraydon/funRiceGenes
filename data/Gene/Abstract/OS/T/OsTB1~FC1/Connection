IAA6|OsIAA6	OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	OsIAA6, a member of the rice Aux/IAA gene family, is involved in drought tolerance and tiller outgrowth.	A knock-down mutant of OsIAA6 showed abnormal tiller outgrowth, apparently due to the regulation of the auxin transporter OsPIN1 and the rice tillering inhibitor OsTB1

OsMADS57	OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	OsMADS57 together with OsTB1 coordinates transcription of its target OsWRKY94 and D14 to switch its organogenesis to defense for cold adaptation in rice.	 Here, we demonstrate that interacting transcription factors OsMADS57 and OsTB1 directly target the defense gene OsWRKY94 and the organogenesis gene D14 to trade off the functions controlling/moderating rice tolerance to cold

Further, OsSHI1 represses the transcriptional activation activity of IPA1 by affecting its DNA binding activity towards the promoters of both OsTB1 and OsDEP1, resulting in increased tiller number and diminished panicle size
OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	OsVIL2	Chromatin Interacting Factor OsVIL2 Is Required for Outgrowth of Axillary Buds in Rice.	 Analysis of the expression patterns of the tiller-related genes revealed that expression of OsTB1, which is a negative regulator of bud outgrowth, was increased in osvil2 mutants
