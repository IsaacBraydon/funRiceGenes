OsAUX1	OsTB1|FC1	OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 downregulation via OsmiR393 overexpression leads to more tillers, early flowering and less tolerance to salt and drought in rice	 The expression of an auxin transporter (OsAUX1) and a tillering inhibitor (OsTB1) were downregulated by overexpression of OsmiR393, which suggested that a gene chain from OsmiR393 to rice tillering may be from OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 to OsAUX1, which affected the transportation of auxin, then to OsTB1, which finally controlled tillering

HTD2|D88|D14	OsTB1|FC1	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14	 Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice| Interaction of OsMADS57 with OsTB1 reduced OsMADS57 inhibition of D14 transcription| Therefore, OsMIR444a-regulated OsMADS57, together with OsTB1, target D14 to control tillering
