OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	 Our study of a locus involved in resistance to lodging demonstrated that saturation editing of the qSCSA3-1/OsTB1/SCM3 region led to loss-of-function, normal-like, and gain-of-function plant types, based on OsTB1 expression and stem cross-section area |  One gain-of-function allele recapitulated a previously described beneficial allele of OsTB1 carrying a TGTG insertion in the 5' region of OsTB1 and enhanced OsTB1 expression at the inflorescence formation stage
