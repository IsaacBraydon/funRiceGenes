R-loop structures (RNA:DNA hybrids) have important functions in many biological processes, including transcriptional regulation and genome instability among diverse organisms. DNA Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1), an essential manipulator of DNA topology during RNA transcription and DNA replication processes, can prevent R-loop accumulation by removing the positive and negative DNA supercoiling that is made by RNA polymerases during transcription. TOP1 is required for plant development, but little is known about its function in preventing co-transcriptional R-loops in different plant biological processes. Here we showed that knockdown of OsTOP1 strongly affects rice development, causing defects in root architecture and gravitropism which are the consequences of mis-regulation of auxin signaling and transporter genes. We found that R-loops are naturally formed at rice auxin-related gene loci, and over-accumulate when the OsTOP1 gene is knocked down or OsTOP1 protein activity is inhibited. OsTOP1 therefore sets the accurate expression levels of auxin-related genes by preventing the over-accumulation of inherent R-loops. Our data reveals R-loops as important factors in polar auxin transport and plant root development, and highlights that OsTOP1 functions as a key to link transcriptional R-loops and plant hormone signaling. This work extends our view on transcriptional regulation of plant hormone signaling.
