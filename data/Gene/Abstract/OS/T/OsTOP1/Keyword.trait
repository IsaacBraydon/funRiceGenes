OsTOP1	root	DNA Topoisomerase 1 prevents R-loop accumulation to modulate auxin-regulated root development in rice.	 Here we showed that knockdown of OsTOP1 strongly affects rice development, causing defects in root architecture and gravitropism which are the consequences of mis-regulation of auxin signaling and transporter genes
OsTOP1	root	DNA Topoisomerase 1 prevents R-loop accumulation to modulate auxin-regulated root development in rice.	 Our data reveals R-loops as important factors in polar auxin transport and plant root development, and highlights that OsTOP1 functions as a key to link transcriptional R-loops and plant hormone signaling
