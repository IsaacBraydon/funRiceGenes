zpq10720.pdf	Two type III effector genes of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae control the induction of the host genes OsTFIIAÂ 1 and OsTFX1 during bacterial blight of rice	2007	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences	Department of Plant Pathology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA.	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strain PXO99(A) induces the expression of the host gene Os8N3, which results in increased host susceptibility to bacterial blight of rice. Here, we show that PXO99(A) affects the expression of two additional genes in a type III secretion system-dependent manner, one encoding a bZIP transcription factor (OsTFX1) and the other the small subunit of the transcription factor IIA located on chromosome 1 (OsTFIIAgamma1). Induction of OsTFX1 and OsTFIIAgamma1 depended on the type III effector genes pthXo6 and pthXo7, respectively, both encoding two previously undescribed members of the transcription activator-like (TAL) effector family. pthXo7 is strain-specific and may reflect adaptation to the resistance mediated by xa5, an allele of OsTFIIAgamma5 encoding a second form of the TFIIA small subunit on chromosome 5 of rice. The loss of pthXo6 resulted in reduced pathogen virulence, and ectopic expression of OsTFX1 abrogated the requirement for pthXo6 for full virulence. X. oryzae pv. oryzae therefore modulates the expression of multiple host genes using multiple TAL effectors from a single strain, and evidence supports the hypothesis that expression of the associated host genes contributes to host susceptibility to disease.
NA	Early selection of bZIP73 facilitated adaptation of japonica rice to cold climates.	2018	Nat Commun	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Centre for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Cold stress is a major factor limiting production and geographic distribution of rice (Oryza sativa). Although the growth range of japonica subspecies has expanded northward compared to modern wild rice (O. rufipogon), the molecular basis of the adaptation remains unclear. Here we report bZIP73, a bZIP transcription factor-coding gene with only one functional polymorphism (+511<U+2009>G&gt;A) between the two subspecies japonica and indica, may have facilitated japonica adaptation to cold climates. We show the japonica version of bZIP73 (bZIP73Jap) interacts with bZIP71 and modulates ABA levels and ROS homeostasis. Evolutionary and population genetic analyses suggest bZIP73 has undergone balancing selection; the bZIP73Jap allele has firstly selected from standing variations in wild rice and likely facilitated cold climate adaptation during initial japonica domestication, while the indica allele bZIP73Ind was subsequently selected for reasons that remain unclear. Our findings reveal early selection of bZIP73Jap may have facilitated climate adaptation of primitive rice germplasms.
NA	The bZIP73 transcription factor controls rice cold tolerance at the reproductive stage.	2019	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Cold temperature during the reproductive stage often causes great yield loss of grain crops in subtropical and temperate regions. Previously we showed that the rice transcription factor bZIP73Jap plays an important role in cold adaptation at the seedling stage. Here we further demonstrate that bZIP73Jap also confers cold stress tolerance at the reproductive stage. bZIP73Jap was up-regulated under cold treatment and predominately expressed in panicles at the early binucleate and flowering stages. bZIP73Jap forms heterodimers with bZIP71, and co-expression of bZIP73Jap and bZIP71 transgenic lines significantly increased seed-setting rate and grain yield under natural cold stress conditions. bZIP73Jap :bZIP71 not only repressed ABA level in anthers, but also enhanced soluble sugar transport from anthers to pollens and improved pollen grain fertility, seed-setting rate, and grain yield. Interestingly, bZIP73Jap :bZIP71 also regulated the expression of qLTG3-1Nip , and qLTG3-1Nip overexpression lines greatly improved rice tolerance to cold stress during the reproductive stage. Therefore, our work establishes a framework for rice cold stress tolerance through the bZIP71-bZIP73Jap -qLTG3-1Nip -sugar transport pathway. Together with our previous work, our results provide a powerful tool for improving rice cold stress tolerance at both the seedling and the reproductive stages.
