OsNPR1|NH1	OsTrxh2	A bacterial F-box effector suppresses SAR immunity through mediating the proteasomal degradation of OsTrxh2 in rice	 Although OsTrxh2 positively regulates rice immunity by catalyzing the dissociation of OsNPR1 into monomers in rice, the XopI effector serves as an F-box adapter to form an OSK1-XopI-OsTrxh2 interaction complex, and further disrupts OsNPR1-mediated resistance through proteasomal degradation of OsTrxh2
