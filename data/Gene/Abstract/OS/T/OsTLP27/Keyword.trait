OsTLP27	leaf	Overexpression of OsTLP27 in rice improves chloroplast function and photochemical efficiency	 OsTLP27 transcripts accumulated specifically in green tissues such as the leaf blade and leaf sheath, and the levels of its transcripts followed a circadian rhythm
OsTLP27	chloroplast	Overexpression of OsTLP27 in rice improves chloroplast function and photochemical efficiency	 OsTLP27 was predicted to encode a thylakoid lumen protein of unknown function in chloroplast, and chloroplast targeting of OsTLP27 was confirmed by transient expression of a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein (GFP)| Overexpression of OsTLP27 also enhanced transcript levels of genes related to chloroplast function and caused changes in the grana size and number| These data suggested that OsTLP27 encodes a protein with a novel function in photosynthesis and chloroplast development in rice|Overexpression of OsTLP27 in rice improves chloroplast function and photochemical efficiency
OsTLP27	sheath	Overexpression of OsTLP27 in rice improves chloroplast function and photochemical efficiency	 OsTLP27 transcripts accumulated specifically in green tissues such as the leaf blade and leaf sheath, and the levels of its transcripts followed a circadian rhythm
OsTLP27	photosynthesis	Overexpression of OsTLP27 in rice improves chloroplast function and photochemical efficiency	 These data suggested that OsTLP27 encodes a protein with a novel function in photosynthesis and chloroplast development in rice
