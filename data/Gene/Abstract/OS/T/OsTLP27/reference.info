The thylakoid lumen proteins are highly associated with photosynthesis functionally. In this study, we characterized the OsTLP27 gene from rice (Oryza sativa), which encodes a 27-kDa of 257-amino acid with 53% homology to the AtTLP gene from Arabidopsis thaliana. OsTLP27 was predicted to encode a thylakoid lumen protein of unknown function in chloroplast, and chloroplast targeting of OsTLP27 was confirmed by transient expression of a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein (GFP). OsTLP27 transcripts accumulated specifically in green tissues such as the leaf blade and leaf sheath, and the levels of its transcripts followed a circadian rhythm. Constitutive expression of OsTLP27 under the control of CaMV 35S promoter resulted in increased pigment content and enhanced photochemical efficiency in terms of the values of maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) (F(v)/F(m)), effective quantum yield of PSII (PhiPSII), electron transport rate (ETR) and photochemical quenching (qP). Overexpression of OsTLP27 also enhanced transcript levels of genes related to chloroplast function and caused changes in the grana size and number. Further study showed that the structure and polypeptide composition of the photosynthetic apparatus were altered in transgenic lines overexpressing OsTLP27. These data suggested that OsTLP27 encodes a protein with a novel function in photosynthesis and chloroplast development in rice.
