NA	OsTGA2 confers disease resistance to rice against leaf blight by regulating expression levels of disease related genes via interaction with NH1.	2018	PLoS One	Gene Engineering Division, National Institute of Agricultural Sciences, RDA, Jeonju, Republic of Korea.	How plants defend themselves from microbial infection is one of the most critical issues for sustainable crop production. Some TGA transcription factors belonging to bZIP superfamily can regulate disease resistance through NPR1-mediated immunity mechanisms in Arabidopsis. Here, we examined biological roles of OsTGA2 (grouped into the same subclade as Arabidopsis TGAs) in bacterial leaf blight resistance. Transcriptional level of OsTGA2 was accumulated after treatment with salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, and Xathomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae (Xoo), a bacterium causing serious blight of rice. OsTGA2 formed homo- and hetero-dimer with OsTGA3 and OsTGA5 and interacted with rice NPR1 homologs 1 (NH1) in rice. Results of quadruple 9-mer protein-binding microarray analysis indicated that OsTGA2 could bind to TGACGT DNA sequence. Overexpression of OsTGA2 increased resistance of rice to bacterial leaf blight, although overexpression of OsTGA3 resulted in disease symptoms similar to wild type plant upon Xoo infection. Overexpression of OsTGA2 enhanced the expression of defense related genes containing TGA binding cis-element in the promoter such as AP2/EREBP 129, ERD1, and HOP1. These results suggest that OsTGA2 can directly regulate the expression of defense related genes and increase the resistance of rice against bacterial leaf blight disease.
NA	OsTGAL1 suppresses the resistance of rice to bacterial blight disease by regulating the expression of salicylic acid glucosyltransferase OsSGT1.	2022	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-Products, Ministry of Agriculture Key Laboratory for Plant Protection and Biotechnology, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Virology, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, China.	Many TGA transcription factors participate in immune responses in the SA-mediated signaling pathway in Arabidopsis. This study identified a transcription factor OsTGAL1, which is induced upon infection by Xoo. Overexpression of OsTGAL1 increased the susceptibility of rice to Xoo. Plants overexpressing OsTGAL1 could affect the expression of many SA signaling-related genes. OsTGAL1 was able to interact with the promoter of OsSGT1, which encodes a key enzyme for SA metabolism. The transcript of OsSGT1 was induced by Xoo and this responsive expression was further increased in plants overexpressing OsTGAL1. OsSGT1 knockout lines had enhanced resistance to Xoo, and knocking out OsSGT1 in plants overexpressing OsTGAL1 blocked the susceptibility caused by OsTGAL1. Altered expression levels of several OsPRs in all the transgenic plants demonstrated that SA-mediated signaling had been affected. Furthermore, we identified an oxidoreductase of CC-type glutaredoxin, OsGRX17, which interacted with OsTGAL1. OsGRX17 reduced the regulation of OsTGAL1 on OsSGT1, and this may be due to its redox modulation. Thus, our results demonstrate that OsTGAL1 negatively regulates resistance to Xoo by its effects on SA metabolism via the activation of OsSGT1, which provides valuable targets for plant breeders in developing new cultivars that are resistant to Xoo.
