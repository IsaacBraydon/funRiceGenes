OsTMN11	 Ectopic expression of OsTMN11 in an Mn-sensitive pmr1 mutant (PMR1 is a Golgi-resident Mn exporter) yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) restored the defective phenotype and transported excess Mn out of the cells	 OsTMN11 knockdown (by RNAi) compromised the growth of young rice, manifested as shorter plant height, reduced biomass, and chlorosis under excessive Mn and Cd conditions |  The mature RNAi plants contained less Mn but accumulated Cd in grains and rice straw, confirming that OsTMN11 plays a fundamental role in metal homeostasis associated with rice growth and development even under normal Mn supply conditions
