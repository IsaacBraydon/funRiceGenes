OsAsp1	OsTIF1	Auxin apical dominance governed by the OsAsp1-OsTIF1 complex determines distinctive rice caryopses development on different branches	 OsAsp1 negatively regulated the transcriptional inhibitor of auxin biosynthesis, OsTAA1 transcriptional inhibition factor 1 (OsTIF1), to preserve indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) apical dominance in CPBs and CSBs
OsAsp1	OsTIF1	Auxin apical dominance governed by the OsAsp1-OsTIF1 complex determines distinctive rice caryopses development on different branches	 IAA also facilitated OsTIF1 translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the nucleus by releasing the interaction of OsTIF1 with OsAsp1 to regulate caryopses IAA levels via a feedback loop
