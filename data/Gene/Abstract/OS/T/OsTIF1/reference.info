NA	Auxin apical dominance governed by the OsAsp1-OsTIF1 complex determines distinctive rice caryopses development on different branches	2020	PLoS Genet	Beijing Key Laboratory of Gene Resource and Molecular Development, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, China.	In rice (Oryza sativa), caryopses located on proximal secondary branches (CSBs) have smaller grain size and poorer grain filling than those located on apical primary branches (CPBs), greatly limiting grain yield. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for developmental differences between CPBs and CSBs remains elusive. In this transcriptome-wide expression study, we identified the gene Aspartic Protease 1 (OsAsp1), which reaches an earlier and higher transcriptional peak in CPBs than in CSBs after pollination. Disruption of OsAsp1 expression in the heterozygous T-DNA line asp1-1+/-eliminated developmental differences between CPBs and CSBs. OsAsp1 negatively regulated the transcriptional inhibitor of auxin biosynthesis, OsTAA1 transcriptional inhibition factor 1 (OsTIF1), to preserve indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) apical dominance in CPBs and CSBs. IAA also facilitated OsTIF1 translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the nucleus by releasing the interaction of OsTIF1 with OsAsp1 to regulate caryopses IAA levels via a feedback loop. IAA promoted transcription of OsAsp1 through MADS29 to maintain an OsAsp1 differential between CPBs and CSBs during pollination. Together, these findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the distributed auxin differential between CPBs and CSBs to regulate distinct caryopses development in different rice branches and potential targets for engineering yield improvement in crops.
