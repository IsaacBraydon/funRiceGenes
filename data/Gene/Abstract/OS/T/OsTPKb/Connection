OsTPKa	OsTPKb	Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles	The Oryza sativa genome encodes two TPK isoforms (TPKa and TPKb) that have very similar sequences and are ubiquitously expressed
OsTPKa	OsTPKb	Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles	In spite of high levels of similarity in sequence and transport properties, the cellular localization of TPKa and TPKb channels was different, with TPKa localization predominantly at the large LV and TPKb primarily in smaller PSV-type compartments
OsTPKa	OsTPKb	Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles	Trafficking of TPKa was sensitive to brefeldin A, while that of TPKb was not
OsTPKa	OsTPKb	Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles	The use of TPKa:TPKb chimeras showed that C-terminal domains are crucial for the differential targeting of TPKa and TPKb
OsTPKa	OsTPKb	Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles	Site-directed mutagenesis of C-terminal residues that were different between TPKa and TPKb identified three amino acids that are important in determining ultimate vacuolar destination
OsHAK1	OsTPKb	OsHAK1, a High-Affinity Potassium Transporter, Positively Regulates Responses to Drought Stress in Rice.	 Furthermore, qPCR analysis revealed that OsHAK1 act as a positive regulator of the expression of stress-responsive genes as well as of two well-known rice channel genes (OsTPKb and OsAKT1) involved in K homeostasis and stress responses in transgenic plants under dehydration
