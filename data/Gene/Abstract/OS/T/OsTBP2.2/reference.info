NA	Knockdown of a Novel Gene OsTBP2.2 Increases Sensitivity to Drought Stress in Rice.	2020	Genes (Basel).	 State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Drought stress is a major environmental stress, which adversely affects the biological and molecular processes of plants, thereby impairing their growth and development. In the present study, we found that the expression level of OsTBP2.2 which encodes for a nucleus-localized protein member belonging to transcription factor IID (TFIID) family, was significantly induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment. Therefore, knockdown mutants of OsTBP2.2 gene were generated to investigate the role of OsTBP2.2 in rice response to drought stress. Under the condition of drought stress, the photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, water use efficiency, and stomatal conductance were significantly reduced in ostbp2.2 lines compared with wild type, Dongjin (WT-DJ). Furthermore, the RNA-seq results showed that several main pathways involved in "MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway", "phenylpropanoid biosynthesis", "defense response" and "ADP (adenosine diphosphate) binding" were altered significantly in ostbp2.2. We also found that OsPIP2;6, OsPAO and OsRCCR1 genes were down-regulated in ostbp2.2 compared with WT-DJ, which may be one of the reasons that inhibit photosynthesis. Our findings suggest that OsTBP2.2 may play a key role in rice growth and the regulation of photosynthesis under drought stress and it may possess high potential usefulness in molecular breeding of drought-tolerant rice.
