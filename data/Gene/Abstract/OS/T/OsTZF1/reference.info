Tandem zinc finger proteins (TZFs) in plants are involved in gene regulation, developmental responses, and hormone-mediated environmental responses in Arabidopsis. However, little information about the functions of the TZF family in monocots has been reported. Here, we investigated a cytoplasmic TZF protein, OsTZF1, which is involved in photomorphogenesis and ABA responses in rice seedlings. The OsTZF1 gene was expressed at relatively high levels in leaves and shoots, although its transcripts were detected in various organs. Red light (R)- and far-red light (FR)-mediated repression of OsTZF1 gene expression was attributed to phytochrome B (phyB) and phytochrome C (phyC), respectively. In addition, OsTZF1 expression was regulated by salt, PEG, and ABA. Overexpression of OsTZF1 caused a long leaf sheath relative to wild type (WT) under R and FR, suggesting that OsTZF1 probably acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis in rice seedlings. Moreover, ABA-induced growth inhibition of rice seedlings was marked in the OsTZF1-overexpression lines compared with WT, suggesting the positive regulation of OsTZF1 to ABA responses. Genome-wide expression analysis further revealed that OsTZF1 also functions in other hormone or stress responses. Our findings supply new evidence on the functions of monocot TZF proteins in phytochrome-mediated light and hormone responses. KEY MESSAGE: OsTZF1 encodes a cytoplasm-localized tandem zinc finger protein and is regulated by both ABA and phytochrome-mediated light signaling. OsTZF1 functions in phytochrome-mediated light and ABA responses in rice.
Jan-2013-OsTZF1, a CCCH-tande.pdf	OsTZF1, a CCCH-tandem zinc finger protein, confers delayed senescence and stress tolerance in rice by regulating stress-related genes	2013	Plant Physiol	Biological Resources and Post-harvest Division, Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8686, Japan.	OsTZF1 is a member of the CCCH-type zinc finger gene family in rice (Oryza sativa). Expression of OsTZF1 was induced by drought, high-salt stress, and hydrogen peroxide. OsTZF1 gene expression was also induced by abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate, and salicylic acid. Histochemical activity of beta-glucuronidase in transgenic rice plants containing the promoter of OsTZF1 fused with beta-glucuronidase was observed in callus, coleoptile, young leaf, and panicle tissues. Upon stress, OsTZF1-green fluorescent protein localization was observed in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic foci. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsTZF1 driven by a maize (Zea mays) ubiquitin promoter (Ubi:OsTZF1-OX [for overexpression]) exhibited delayed seed germination, growth retardation at the seedling stage, and delayed leaf senescence. RNA interference (RNAi) knocked-down plants (OsTZF1-RNAi) showed early seed germination, enhanced seedling growth, and early leaf senescence compared with controls. Ubi:OsTZF1-OX plants showed improved tolerance to high-salt and drought stresses and vice versa for OsTZF1-RNAi plants. Microarray analysis revealed that genes related to stress, reactive oxygen species homeostasis, and metal homeostasis were regulated in the Ubi:OsTZF1-OX plants. RNA-binding assays indicated that OsTZF1 binds to U-rich regions in the 3' untranslated region of messenger RNAs, suggesting that OsTZF1 might be associated with RNA metabolism of stress-responsive genes. OsTZF1 may serve as a useful biotechnological tool for the improvement of stress tolerance in various plants through the control of RNA metabolism of stress-responsive genes.
