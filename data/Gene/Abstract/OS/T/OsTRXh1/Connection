OsMPK6|OsMPK4	OsTrx23|OsTRXh1	A cold-induced thioredoxin h of rice, OsTrx23, negatively regulates kinase activities of OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 in vitro	 Here, we report that a major and cold-induced thioredoxin h of rice, OsTrx23, has an inhibitory activity on stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 in vitro

OsTrx23|OsTRXh1	OsTrxh4	Two h-type thioredoxins interact with the PHO2ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme to fine-tune phosphate homeostasis.	 A yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) screen in Oryza sativa (Os, rice) using OsPHO2 as bait, revealed an interaction between OsPHO2 and two h-type thioredoxins, OsTrxh1 and OsTrxh4
LTN1|OsPHO2	OsTrx23|OsTRXh1	Two h-Type Thioredoxins Interact with the E2 Ubiquitin Conjugase PHO2 to Fine-Tune Phosphate Homeostasis in Rice.	 A yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen in rice (Oryza sativa; Os) using OsPHO2 as bait revealed an interaction between OsPHO2 and two h-type thioredoxins, OsTrxh1 and OsTrxh4
LTN1|OsPHO2	OsTrx23|OsTRXh1	Two h-Type Thioredoxins Interact with the E2 Ubiquitin Conjugase PHO2 to Fine-Tune Phosphate Homeostasis in Rice.	 Characterization of rice pho2 complemented lines, transformed with an endogenous genomic OsPHO2 or OsPHO2(C445S) (a constitutively reduced form) fragment, indicated that OsPHO2(C445S) restored Pi concentration in rice to statistically significant lower levels compared to native OsPHO2 Moreover, the suppression of OsTrxh1 (knockdown and knockout) resulted in slightly higher Pi concentration than that of wild-type Nipponbare in leaves
