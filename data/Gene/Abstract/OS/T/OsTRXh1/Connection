OsMPK6|OsMPK4	OsTrx23|OsTRXh1	A cold-induced thioredoxin h of rice, OsTrx23, negatively regulates kinase activities of OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 in vitro	 Here, we report that a major and cold-induced thioredoxin h of rice, OsTrx23, has an inhibitory activity on stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 in vitro
OsMPK6|OsMPK4	OsTrx23|OsTRXh1	A cold-induced thioredoxin h of rice, OsTrx23, negatively regulates kinase activities of OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 in vitro	A cold-induced thioredoxin h of rice, OsTrx23, negatively regulates kinase activities of OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 in vitro
OsTrx23|OsTRXh1	OsTrxh4	Two h-type thioredoxins interact with the PHO2ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme to fine-tune phosphate homeostasis.	 A yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) screen in Oryza sativa (Os, rice) using OsPHO2 as bait, revealed an interaction between OsPHO2 and two h-type thioredoxins, OsTrxh1 and OsTrxh4
