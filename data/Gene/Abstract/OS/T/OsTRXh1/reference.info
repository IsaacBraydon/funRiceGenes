Plant Physiol.-2011-Zhang-1884-99.pdf	An apoplastic h-type thioredoxin is involved in the stress response through regulation of the apoplastic reactive oxygen species in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang 050016, China.	Thioredoxins (Trxs) are a multigenic family of proteins in plants that play a critical role in redox balance regulation through thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. There are 10 members of the h-type Trxs in rice (Oryza sativa), and none of them has been clearly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that OsTRXh1, a subgroup I h-type Trx in rice, possesses reduction activity in vitro and complements the hydrogen peroxide sensitivity of Trx-deficient yeast mutants. OsTRXh1 is ubiquitously expressed in rice, and its expression is induced by salt and abscisic acid treatments. Intriguingly, OsTRXh1 is secreted into the extracellular space, and salt stress in the apoplast of rice induces its expression at the protein level. The knockdown of OsTRXh1 results in dwarf plants with fewer tillers, whereas the overexpression of OsTRXh1 leads to a salt-sensitive phenotype in rice. In addition, both the knockdown and overexpression of OsTRXh1 decrease abscisic acid sensitivity during seed germination and seedling growth. We also analyzed the levels of hydrogen peroxide produced in transgenic plants, and the results show that more hydrogen peroxide is produced in the extracellular space of OsTRXh1 knockdown plants than in wild-type plants, whereas the OsTRXh1 overexpression plants produce less hydrogen peroxide under salt stress. These results show that OsTRXh1 regulates the redox state of the apoplast and influences plant development and stress responses.
psb-7-440.pdf	OsTRXh1 regulates the redox state of the apoplast and influences stress responses in rice	2012	Plant Signal Behav	Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang, China.	The plant cell apoplast is the compartment beyond the cell plasmalemma, including the cell wall and intercellular space. Many environmental elements can trigger reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst at the plasma membrane which then alters the redox state of the apoplast. Recently, h-type thioredoxin (Trx), OsTRXh1, was identified to be involved in apoplastic redox state regulation in rice. OsTRXh1 is conserved redox-active Trx and can be secreted into the extracellular regions. Through transgenic rice plant, we found that OsTRXh1 regulated ROS accumulation in apoplast and influenced plant development and stress responses. This provides new insights into apoplastic redox state regulation pathway and expands our understanding of h-type Trxs function.
Xie-2009-A cold-induced thior.pdf	A cold-induced thioredoxin h of rice, OsTrx23, negatively regulates kinase activities of OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 in vitro	2009	FEBS Lett	National Agricultural Research Center for Hokkaido Region, National Agricultural and Food Research Organization, Sapporo, Japan.	Cytosolic thioredoxins are small conserved proteins that are involved in cellular redox regulation. Here, we report that a major and cold-induced thioredoxin h of rice, OsTrx23, has an inhibitory activity on stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 in vitro. This inhibition effects were redox-dependent and did not involve stable physical interaction. The data suggested a novel mechanism for redox regulation of MAPKs in plants.
