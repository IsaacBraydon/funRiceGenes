COM1/SAE2 is a highly conserved gene from yeast to higher eukaryotes. Its orthologs, known to cooperate with the MRX complex (Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2), are required for meiotic DNA double-strand break (DSB) ends resection and specific mitotic DSB repair events. Here, the rice (Oryza sativa, 2n = 2x = 24) COM1/SAE2 homolog was identified through positional cloning, termed OsCOM1. Four independent mutants of OsCOM1 were isolated and characterized. In Oscom1 mutants, synaptonemal complex (SC) formation, homologous pairing and recombination were severely inhibited, whereas aberrant non-homologous chromosome entanglements occurred constantly. Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal. Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants. These results provide direct evidence for the functions of OsCOM1 in promoting homologous synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis.

DNA topoisomerase 6 (TOP6) belongs to a novel family of type II DNA topoisomerases present, other than in archaebacteria, only in plants. Here we report the isolation of full-length cDNAs encoding putative TOP6 subunits A and B from rice (Oryza sativa ssp. indica), preserving all the structural domains conserved among archaebacterial TOP6 homologs and eukaryotic meiotic recombination factor SPO11. OsTOP6A1 was predominantly expressed in prepollinated flowers. The transcript abundance of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was also higher in prepollinated flowers and callus. The expression of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was differentially regulated by the plant hormones, auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the full-length OsTOP6B protein interacts with both OsTOP6A2 and OsTOP6A3, but not with OsTOP6A1. The nuclear localization of OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was established by the transient expression of their beta-glucuronidase fusion proteins in onion epidermal cells. Overexpression of OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B in transgenic Arabidopsis plants conferred reduced sensitivity to the stress hormone, abscisic acid, and tolerance to high salinity and dehydration. Moreover, the stress tolerance coincided with enhanced induction of many stress-responsive genes in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. In addition, microarray analysis revealed that a large number of genes are expressed differentially in transgenic plants. Taken together, our results demonstrate that TOP6 genes play a crucial role in stress adaptation of plants by altering gene expression.

Plant productivity is greatly influenced by various environmental stresses, such as high salinity and drought. Earlier, we reported the isolation of topoisomerase 6 homologs from rice and showed that over expression of OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B confers abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. In this study, we have assessed the function of nuclear-localized topoisomerase 6 subunit A homolog, OsTOP6A1, in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. The over expression of OsTOP6A1 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants driven by cauliflower mosaic virus-35S promoter resulted in pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed reduced sensitivity to stress hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), and tolerance to high salinity and dehydration at the seed germination; seedling and adult stages as reflected by the percentage of germination, fresh weight of seedlings and leaf senescence assay, respectively. Concomitantly, the expression of many stress-responsive genes was enhanced under various stress conditions in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Moreover, microarray analysis revealed that the expression of a large number of genes involved in various processes of plant growth and development and stress responses was altered in transgenic plants. Although AtSPO11-1, the homolog of OsTOP6A1 in Arabidopsis, has been implicated in meiotic recombination; the present study demonstrates possible additional role of OsTOP6A1 and provides an effective tool for engineering crop plants for tolerance to different environmental stresses.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs00412-010-0284-7.pdf	OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation in rice	2010	Chromosoma	Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology of Jiangsu Province/Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics of Ministry of Education, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, China.	Spo11 is a homolog of a subunit of archaebacterial topoisomerase, which catalyzes DNA double-strand breaks and initiates homologous chromosome recombination. In the present study, we silenced the SPO11-1 gene in rice (Oryza sativa) using RNAi. Rice plants with loss-of-function of OsSPO11-1 have no apparent growth defects during vegetative development, but homologous chromosome pairing and recombination are significantly obstructed. Telomeres can be assembled as bouquet during the zygotene stage of the OsSPO11-1-deficient plants, just as that in wild type. Although the two axial-associated proteins, REC8 and PAIR2, are loaded onto the chromosomes, the depletion of PAIR2 from the chromosomes is much later than in wild type. The central element of the synaptonemal complex (SC), ZEP1, does not load onto the chromosomes normally, implying that SC formation is disturbed severely. The crossover protein, MER3, isn't efficiently assembled onto chromosomes and the lack of bivalent suggests that crossovers are also affected in the absence of OsSPO11-1. Thus, OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosomes pairing and crossover formation during meiosis in rice.
