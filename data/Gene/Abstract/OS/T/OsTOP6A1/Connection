MER3|RCK	OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation in rice	The crossover protein, MER3, isn't efficiently assembled onto chromosomes and the lack of bivalent suggests that crossovers are also affected in the absence of OsSPO11-1
OsCOM1	OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants

OsRad21-4|OsREC8	OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	ZEP1|OsZEP	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	PAIR2	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	OsTOP6B	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants	Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the full-length OsTOP6B protein interacts with both OsTOP6A2 and OsTOP6A3, but not with OsTOP6A1
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	OsTOP6A3	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants	Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the full-length OsTOP6B protein interacts with both OsTOP6A2 and OsTOP6A3, but not with OsTOP6A1
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants	Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the full-length OsTOP6B protein interacts with both OsTOP6A2 and OsTOP6A3, but not with OsTOP6A1
OsMTOPVIB	OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	OsMTOPVIB is required for meiotic bipolar spindle assembly.	 We further revealed that the mono-orientation of sister kinetochores was prevalent in OsmtopVIB, whereas biorientation of sister kinetochores was frequently observed in Osspo11-1, pair2, and crc1 In addition, mutations of the cohesion subunit OsREC8 resulted in biorientation of sister kinetochores as well as bipolar spindles even in the background of OsmtopVIB Therefore, we propose that biorientation of the kinetochore is required for bipolar spindle assembly in the absence of homologous recombination
OsATM	OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	OsATM safeguards accurate repair of meiotic double-strand breaks in rice.	 Aberrant chromosome associations disappeared in Osspo11-1 Osatm-1 double mutants and more severe defects were observed in Osdmc1  Osatm, suggesting that OsATM functions downstream of OsSPO11-1-catalyzed double-strand break (DSB) formation and in parallel with OsDMC1-mediated homologous recombination
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	OsSUN1	The SUN domain proteins OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 play critical but partially redundant roles in meiosis	 When introducing a mutant allele of OsSPORULATION11 (OsSPO11)-1, which encodes a topoisomerase initiating homologous recombination, into the Ossun1 Ossun2 mutant, we observed a combined Osspo11-1- and Ossun1 Ossun2-like phenotype, demonstrating that OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 promote bouquet formation independent of OsSPO11-1, but regulate pairing and crossover formation downstream of OsSPO11-1
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	OsSUN2	The SUN domain proteins OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 play critical but partially redundant roles in meiosis	 When introducing a mutant allele of OsSPORULATION11 (OsSPO11)-1, which encodes a topoisomerase initiating homologous recombination, into the Ossun1 Ossun2 mutant, we observed a combined Osspo11-1- and Ossun1 Ossun2-like phenotype, demonstrating that OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 promote bouquet formation independent of OsSPO11-1, but regulate pairing and crossover formation downstream of OsSPO11-1
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis	 To clarify the roles of these SPO11 paralogs, we used CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to induce null mutants in OsSPO11-1, OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis	 Similar to Osspo11-1, biallelic mutations in OsSPO11-2 first exon led to complete panicle sterility, and consequently, none of these primary transformants produced seeds
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis	 Similar to Osspo11-1, the pollen mother cells of Osspo11-2 T1 progeny plants, showed an absence of bivalent formation at metaphase I, aberrant segregation of homologous chromosomes and formation of nonviable tetrads
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis	 Altogether, this study demonstrates that whereas OsSPO11-1 and OsSPO11-2 are the likely orthologs of Arabidopsis AtSPO11-1 and AtSPO11-2, the additional OsSPO11-4 gene has no major role in wild-type rice meiosis
