OsACOS12	OsTKPR2	OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.	 OsTKPR1 and OsTKPR2 were integrated into a metabolon including OsACOS12 and OsPKS2, which resulted in a significant increased enzymatic efficiency when both OsTKPR1 and OsTKPR2 were present, indicating the mutual dependence of OsTKPR2 and OsTKPR1 for their full biochemical activities
OsPKS2	OsTKPR2	OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.	 OsTKPR1 and OsTKPR2 were integrated into a metabolon including OsACOS12 and OsPKS2, which resulted in a significant increased enzymatic efficiency when both OsTKPR1 and OsTKPR2 were present, indicating the mutual dependence of OsTKPR2 and OsTKPR1 for their full biochemical activities
OsTKPR1|OsDFR2|OS-DFR2	OsTKPR2	OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.	 We found that OsTKPR2 and OsTKPR1 share a similar expression pattern, and their coding proteins have a similar subcellular localization and enzyme activities towards reduced tetraketide α-pyrone and hydroxylated tetraketide α-pyrone

OsTKPR1 and OsTKPR2 were integrated into a metabolon including OsACOS12 and OsPKS2, which resulted in a significant increased enzymatic efficiency when both OsTKPR1 and OsTKPR2 were present, indicating the mutual dependence of OsTKPR2 and OsTKPR1 for their full biochemical activities
OsTKPR1|OsDFR2|OS-DFR2	OsTKPR2	OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.	 Furthermore, the cooperation and possible functional divergence between OsTKPR2 and OsTKPR1 is also discussed
