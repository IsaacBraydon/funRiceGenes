OsTKPR2	development	OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.	 Thus, our results demonstrated that OsTKPR2 is required for anther and pollen development where an OsTKPR2-containing metabolon is functional during rice sporopollenin synthesis
OsTKPR2	fertility	OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.	 Three independent ostkpr2 mutant lines generated by CRISPR/Cas9 displayed reduced male fertility to various extents which were correlated with the severity of gene disruptions
OsTKPR2	pollen	OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.	 Thus, our results demonstrated that OsTKPR2 is required for anther and pollen development where an OsTKPR2-containing metabolon is functional during rice sporopollenin synthesis
OsTKPR2	anther	OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.	 Thus, our results demonstrated that OsTKPR2 is required for anther and pollen development where an OsTKPR2-containing metabolon is functional during rice sporopollenin synthesis
OsTKPR2	pollen development	OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.	 Thus, our results demonstrated that OsTKPR2 is required for anther and pollen development where an OsTKPR2-containing metabolon is functional during rice sporopollenin synthesis
