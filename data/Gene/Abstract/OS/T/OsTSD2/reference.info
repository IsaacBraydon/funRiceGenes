NA	Control of Leaf Senescence by a MeOH-Jasmonates Cascade That Is Epigenetically Regulated by OsSRT1 in Rice.	2016	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Although considerable progress has been made in identifying the genes regulating accumulation of hormones that are involved in leaf senescence, only a few studies have focused on natural variations in jasmonates content and much less on the underlying genetic basis. Moreover, the epigenetic regulations of JA-mediate leaf senescence remains largely unknown. In this study, we carried out metabolic profiling of a worldwide collection of rice accessions and demonstrated that there are substantial variations in jasmonates levels among these accessions. The subsequent metabolite-based genome-wide association study identified candidates for two major quantitative genes (QTGs), OsPME1 and OsTSD2, affecting the content of jasmonates. Subsequent investigation using a series of relevant mutants and transgenic lines revealed the role of the MeOH-jasmonates cascade in regulating leaf senescence. We provide further evidence that OsSRT1, one of the two Sir2 (silent information regulator 2) homologues in rice, negatively regulates leaf senescence by repressing the expression of the biosynthetic genes of this metabolic cascade and possibly through direct histone H3K9 deacetylation of OsPME1. Our study revealed that a MeOH-jasmonates cascade and its epigenetic regulation are factors that affect leaf senescence, and the results provide an in-depth account of senescence control in plants.
NA	Rice putative methyltransferase gene OsTSD2 is required for root development involving pectin modification.	2016	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Pectin synthesis and modification are vital for plant development, although the underlying mechanisms are still not well understood. Here, we report the functional characterization of the OsTSD2 gene, which encodes a putative methyltransferase in rice. All three independent T-DNA insertion lines of OsTSD2 displayed dwarf phenotypes and serial alterations in different zones of the root. These alterations included abnormal cellular adhesion and schizogenous aerenchyma formation in the meristematic zone, inhibited root elongation in the elongation zone, and higher lateral root density in the mature zone. Immunofluorescence (with LM19) and Ruthenium Red staining of the roots showed that unesterified homogalacturonan (HG) was increased in Ostsd2 mutants. Biochemical analysis of cell wall pectin polysaccharides revealed that both the monosaccharide composition and the uronic acid content were decreased in Ostsd2 mutants. Increased endogenous ABA content and opposite roles performed by ABA and IAA in regulating cellular adhesion in the Ostsd2 mutants suggested that OsTSD2 is required for root development in rice through a pathway involving pectin synthesis/modification. A hypothesis to explain the relationship among OsTSD2, pectin methylesterification, and root development is proposed, based on pectin's function in regional cell extension/division in a zone-dependent manner.
