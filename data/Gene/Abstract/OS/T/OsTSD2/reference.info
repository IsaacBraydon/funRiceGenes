NA	Control of Leaf Senescence by a MeOH-Jasmonates Cascade That Is Epigenetically Regulated by OsSRT1 in Rice.	2016	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Although considerable progress has been made in identifying the genes regulating accumulation of hormones that are involved in leaf senescence, only a few studies have focused on natural variations in jasmonates content and much less on the underlying genetic basis. Moreover, the epigenetic regulations of JA-mediate leaf senescence remains largely unknown. In this study, we carried out metabolic profiling of a worldwide collection of rice accessions and demonstrated that there are substantial variations in jasmonates levels among these accessions. The subsequent metabolite-based genome-wide association study identified candidates for two major quantitative genes (QTGs), OsPME1 and OsTSD2, affecting the content of jasmonates. Subsequent investigation using a series of relevant mutants and transgenic lines revealed the role of the MeOH-jasmonates cascade in regulating leaf senescence. We provide further evidence that OsSRT1, one of the two Sir2 (silent information regulator 2) homologues in rice, negatively regulates leaf senescence by repressing the expression of the biosynthetic genes of this metabolic cascade and possibly through direct histone H3K9 deacetylation of OsPME1. Our study revealed that a MeOH-jasmonates cascade and its epigenetic regulation are factors that affect leaf senescence, and the results provide an in-depth account of senescence control in plants.
