OsTSD2	root	Rice putative methyltransferase gene OsTSD2 is required for root development involving pectin modification.	Rice putative methyltransferase gene OsTSD2 is required for root development involving pectin modification.
OsTSD2	root	Rice putative methyltransferase gene OsTSD2 is required for root development involving pectin modification.	 All three independent T-DNA insertion lines of OsTSD2 displayed dwarf phenotypes and serial alterations in different zones of the root
OsTSD2	root	Rice putative methyltransferase gene OsTSD2 is required for root development involving pectin modification.	 Increased endogenous ABA content and opposite roles performed by ABA and IAA in regulating cellular adhesion in the Ostsd2 mutants suggested that OsTSD2 is required for root development in rice through a pathway involving pectin synthesis/modification
OsTSD2	development	Rice putative methyltransferase gene OsTSD2 is required for root development involving pectin modification.	Rice putative methyltransferase gene OsTSD2 is required for root development involving pectin modification.
