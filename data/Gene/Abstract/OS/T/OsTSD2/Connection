OsPME1	OsTSD2	Control of Leaf Senescence by a MeOH-Jasmonates Cascade That Is Epigenetically Regulated by OsSRT1 in Rice.	 The subsequent metabolite-based genome-wide association study identified candidates for two major quantitative genes (QTGs), OsPME1 and OsTSD2, affecting the content of jasmonates
