OsTTL	SAPK1|OsSAPK1	Identification of a key locus, qNL3.1, associated with seed germination under salt stress via a genome-wide association study in rice.	Two causal OsTTL and OsSAPK1 genes of the key locus qNL3
OsTTL	SAPK1|OsSAPK1	Identification of a key locus, qNL3.1, associated with seed germination under salt stress via a genome-wide association study in rice.	 Analysis of candidate genes showed that two genes, the similar to transthyretin-like protein OsTTL and the serine/threonine protein kinase OsSAPK1, were the causal genes of qNL3
OsTTL	SAPK1|OsSAPK1	Identification of a key locus, qNL3.1, associated with seed germination under salt stress via a genome-wide association study in rice.	 Germination tests indicated that both Osttl and Ossapk1 mutants significantly reduced seed germination under salt stress compared to the wild type
