OsTRXZ|WP2	cold stress	TSV, a putative plastidic oxidoreductase, protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress during development by interacting with plastidic thioredoxin Z.	 We demonstrated that TSV protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress by interacting with OsTrxZ
OsTRXZ|WP2	stress	TSV, a putative plastidic oxidoreductase, protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress during development by interacting with plastidic thioredoxin Z.	 We demonstrated that TSV protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress by interacting with OsTrxZ
OsTRXZ|WP2	temperature	White Panicle2 encoding thioredoxin z, regulates plastid RNA editing by interacting with Multiple Organellar RNA Editing Factors in rice	 wp2 and Ostrx z knockout lines show reduced editing efficiencies in many plastidial-encoded genes especially under high temperature conditions
