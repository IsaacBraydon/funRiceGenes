OsTRXZ	TCD5|CSV1|TSV	TSV, a putative plastidic oxidoreductase, protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress during development by interacting with plastidic thioredoxin Z	Strikingly, TSV interacted with OsTrxZ (a subunit of PEP in chloroplasts) and enhanced OsTrxZ stability under low temperatures.
OsTRXZ	WLP2|OsFLN1	White Leaf and Panicle 2, encoding a PEP-associated protein, is required for chloroplast biogenesis under heat stress in rice.	 Moreover, WLP2 and its paralog OsFLN2 can physically interact with thioredoxin OsTRXz to form a TRX-FLN regulatory module, which not only regulates transcription of the PEP-encoded genes but also maintains the redox balance in chloroplasts under heat stress
