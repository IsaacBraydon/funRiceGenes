Rice is vulnerable to cold stress. Seedlings are very sensitive to cold stress and this harms global rice production. The effects of cold on chloroplast development are well known, but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we isolated a temperature-sensitive virescent (tsv) mutant that is extremely sensitive to cold stress. It displayed defective chloroplasts, decreased chlorophyll and zero survivorship under cold stress. We isolated and identified TSV by map-based cloning and rescue experiments, combined with genetic, cytological and molecular biological analyses. We found that TSV, a putative plastidic oxidoreductase, is a new type of virescent protein. A mutation in tsv causes premature termination of the gene product. The activity of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) and the expression of genes participating in chlorophyll synthesis were severely reduced in the tsv mutant under cold stress, but not at normal temperatures. TSV expression was induced by low temperatures. Strikingly, TSV interacted with OsTrxZ (a subunit of PEP in chloroplasts) and enhanced OsTrxZ stability under low temperatures. We demonstrated that TSV protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress by interacting with OsTrxZ. These results provide novel insights into ways in which rice chloroplast development and chlorophyll synthesis are protected by TSV under cold stress.
NA	White Panicle2 encoding thioredoxin z, regulates plastid RNA editing by interacting with Multiple Organellar RNA Editing Factors in rice	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, P.R. China.	Thioredoxins (TRXs) occur in plant chloroplasts as complex disulphide oxidoreductases. Although many biological processes are regulated by thioredoxins, the regulatory mechanism of chloroplast TRXs are largely unknown. <U+2022> Here we report a rice white panicle2 mutant caused by a mutation in thioredoxin z gene, an ortholog of AtTRX z in Arabidopsis. white panicle2 (wp2) seedlings exhibited a high temperature sensitive albinic phenotype. <U+2022> We found that plastid multiple organellar RNA editing factors (MORFs) were the regulatory targets of thioredoxin z. We showed that OsTRX z protein physically interacts with OsMORFs in a redox-dependent manner and that the redox state of a conserved cysteine in the MORF box is essential for MORF-MORF interactions. wp2 and Ostrx z knockout lines show reduced editing efficiencies in many plastidial-encoded genes especially under high temperature conditions. An Arabidopsis trx z mutant also exhibited significantly reduced chloroplast RNA editing. <U+2022> Our combined results suggest that thioredoxin z regulate chloroplast RNA editing in plants by controlling the redox state of MORFs.
