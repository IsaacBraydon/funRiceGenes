OsTIP3;1	 ABA-inducible expression of OsTIP3;1, encoding a rice tonoplast intrinsic protein, was enhanced by sugar depletion |  Such a stimulatory increase in OsTIP3;1 expression under sugar-starvation is possibly not owing to changes in endogenous ABA content |  The transient expression assay indicated that the 5' flanking region of OsTIP3;1 delivered similar collaborative responsiveness to starvation and ABA, suggesting that this gene promoter could be a good molecular probe to examine the interaction between sugar and ABA signaling pathways |  ABI4 expression was also enhanced by sugars and repressed by ABA, suggesting that reduced ABI4 binding to CE1 in the absence of sugar and presence of ABA could increase ABA-induction of the OsTIP3;1 promoter activity
