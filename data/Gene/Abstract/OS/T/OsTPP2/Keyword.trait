OsTPP2	abiotic stress	Biochemical characterization of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases supports distinctive functions of these plant enzymes	 OsTPP2 expression is transiently induced in response to chilling and other abiotic stresses
OsTPP2	chilling	Biochemical characterization of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases supports distinctive functions of these plant enzymes	 OsTPP2 expression is transiently induced in response to chilling and other abiotic stresses
OsTPP2	vegetative	Biochemical characterization of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases supports distinctive functions of these plant enzymes	 Here we report that OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 are the two major trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase genes expressed in vegetative tissues of rice
