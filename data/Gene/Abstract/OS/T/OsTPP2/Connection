OsTPP1	OsTPP2	Biochemical characterization of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases supports distinctive functions of these plant enzymes	Here we report that OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 are the two major trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase genes expressed in vegetative tissues of rice
OsTPP1	OsTPP2	Biochemical characterization of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases supports distinctive functions of these plant enzymes	Similar to results obtained from our previous OsTPP1 study, complementation analysis of a yeast trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase mutant and activity measurement of the recombinant protein demonstrated that OsTPP2 encodes a functional trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enzyme
OsTPP1	OsTPP2	Biochemical characterization of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases supports distinctive functions of these plant enzymes	Enzymatic characterization of recombinant OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 revealed stringent substrate specificity for trehalose 6-phosphate and about 10 times lower K(m) values for trehalose 6-phosphate as compared with trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enzymes from microorganisms
OsTPP1	OsTPP2	Biochemical characterization of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases supports distinctive functions of these plant enzymes	OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 also clearly contrasted with microbial enzymes, in that they are generally unstable, almost completely losing activity when subjected to heat treatment at 50 degrees C for 4 min
