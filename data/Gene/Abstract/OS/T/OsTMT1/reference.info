In Arabidopsis, the compartmentation of sugars into vacuoles is known to be facilitated by sugar transporters. However, vacuolar sugar transporters have not been studied in detail in other plant species. To characterize the rice (Oryza sativa) tonoplast monosaccharide transporters, OsTMT1 and OsTMT2, we analysed their subcellular localization using green fluorescent protein (GFP) and expression patterns using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), performed histochemical beta-glucuronidase (GUS) assay and in situ hybridization analysis, and assessed sugar transport ability using isolated vacuoles. Expression of OsTMT-GFP fusion protein in rice and Arabidopsis revealed that the OsTMTs localize at the tonoplast. Analyses of OsTMT promoter-GUS transgenic rice indicated that OsTMT1 and OsTMT2 are highly expressed in bundle sheath cells, and in vascular parenchyma and companion cells in leaves, respectively. Both genes were found to be preferentially expressed in the vascular tissues of roots, the palea/lemma of spikelets, and in the main vascular tissues and nucellar projections on the dorsal side of the seed coats. Glucose uptake studies using vacuoles isolated from transgenic mutant Arabidopsis (tmt1-2-3) expressing OsTMT1 demonstrated that OsTMTs are capable of transporting glucose into vacuoles. Based on expression analysis and functional characterization, our present findings suggest that the OsTMTs play a role in vacuolar glucose storage in rice.
NA	OsRRM, an RNA-Binding Protein, Modulates Sugar Transport in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	2020	Front Plant Sci	Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Key Laboratory of Crop Genomics and Molecular Breeding of Jiangsu Province, Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology of Jiangsu Province, College of Agriculture, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.	Sugar allocation between vegetative and reproductive tissues is vital to plant development, and sugar transporters play fundamental roles in this process. Although several transcription factors have been identified that control their transcription levels, the way in which the expression of sugar transporter genes is controlled at the posttranscriptional level is unknown. In this study, we showed that OsRRM, an RNA-binding protein, modulates sugar allocation in tissues on the source-to-sink route. The OsRRM expression pattern partly resembles that of several sugar transporter and transcription factor genes that specifically affect sugar transporter gene expression. The messenger RNA levels of almost all of the sugar transporter genes are severely reduced in the osrrm mutant, and this alters sugar metabolism and sugar signaling, which further affects plant height, flowering time, seed size, and starch synthesis. We further showed that OsRRM binds directly to messenger RNAs encoded by sugar transporter genes and thus may stabilize their transcripts. Therefore, we have uncovered the physiological function of OsRRM, which sheds new light on sugar metabolism and sugar signaling.
NA	OsTST1, a key tonoplast sugar transporter from source to sink, plays essential roles in affecting yields and height of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2023	Planta	Photosynthesis Research Center, Key Laboratory of Photobiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 20 Nanxincun, Xiangshan, Beijing, 100093, China.	OsTST1 affects yield and development and mediates sugar transportation of plants from source to sink in rice, which influences the accumulation of intermediate metabolites from tricarboxylic acid cycle indirectly. Tonoplast sugar transporters (TSTs) are essential for vacuolar sugar accumulation in plants. Carbohydrate transport across tonoplasts maintains the metabolic balance in plant cells, and carbohydrate distribution is crucial to plant growth and productivity. Large plant vacuoles store high concentrations of sugars to meet plant requirements for energy and other biological processes. The abundance of sugar transporter affects crop biomass and reproductive growth. However, it remains unclear whether the rice (Oryza sativa L.) sugar transport protein OsTST1 affects yield and development. In this study, we found that OsTST1 knockout mutants generated via CRISPR/Cas9 exhibited slower development, smaller seeds, and lower yield than wild type (WT) rice plants. Notably, plants overexpressing OsTST1 showed the opposite effects. Changes in rice leaves at 14 days after germination (DAG) and at 10 days after flowering (DAF) suggested that OsTST1 affected the accumulation of intermediate metabolites from the glycolytic pathway and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The modification of the sugar transport between cytosol and vacuole mediated by OsTST1 induces deregulation of several genes including transcription factors (TFs). In summary, no matter the location of sucrose and sink is, these preliminary results revealed that OsTST1 was important for sugar transport from source to sink tissues, thus affecting plant growth and development.
