Symbol	Expression
OsTMF	 Cold stress increased the expression of OsTMF and accumulation of OsTMF in the nucleus, where OsTMF acts as a transcription activator and modulates the expression of genes involved in pectin degradation (OsBURP16), cellulose biosynthesis (OsCesA4 and OsCesA9), and cell wall structural maintenance (genes encoding proline-rich proteins and peroxidases) |  OsTMF directly activated the expression of OsBURP16, OsCesA4, and OsCesA9 through binding to the TATA cis-elements in their promoters
