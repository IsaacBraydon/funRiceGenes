Bc6|OsCesA9	OsTMF	OsTMF attenuates cold tolerance by affecting cell wall properties in rice.	 Cold stress increased the expression of OsTMF and accumulation of OsTMF in the nucleus, where OsTMF acts as a transcription activator and modulates the expression of genes involved in pectin degradation (OsBURP16), cellulose biosynthesis (OsCesA4 and OsCesA9), and cell wall structural maintenance (genes encoding proline-rich proteins and peroxidases)
Bc6|OsCesA9	OsTMF	OsTMF attenuates cold tolerance by affecting cell wall properties in rice.	 OsTMF directly activated the expression of OsBURP16, OsCesA4, and OsCesA9 through binding to the TATA cis-elements in their promoters
