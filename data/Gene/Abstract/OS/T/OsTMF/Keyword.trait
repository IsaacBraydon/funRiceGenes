OsTMF	tolerance	OsTMF attenuates cold tolerance by affecting cell wall properties in rice.	OsTMF attenuates cold tolerance by affecting cell wall properties in rice.
OsTMF	tolerance	OsTMF attenuates cold tolerance by affecting cell wall properties in rice.	 Under cold stress conditions, OsTMF negatively regulated pectin content and peroxidase activity, and positively regulated cellulose content, causing corresponding alterations to cell wall properties, all of which collectively contribute to the negative effect of OsTMF on cold tolerance

OsTMF	cold stress	OsTMF attenuates cold tolerance by affecting cell wall properties in rice.	 Cold stress increased the expression of OsTMF and accumulation of OsTMF in the nucleus, where OsTMF acts as a transcription activator and modulates the expression of genes involved in pectin degradation (OsBURP16), cellulose biosynthesis (OsCesA4 and OsCesA9), and cell wall structural maintenance (genes encoding proline-rich proteins and peroxidases)
