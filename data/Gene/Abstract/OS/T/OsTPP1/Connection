OsbZIP52|RISBZ5	OsTPP1	bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP52/RISBZ5: a potential negative regulator of cold and drought stress response in rice	 Real-time PCR analysis revealed that some abiotic stress-related genes, such as OsLEA3, OsTPP1, Rab25, gp1 precursor, beta-gal, LOC_Os05g11910 and LOC_Os05g39250, were down-regulated in OsbZIP52 overexpression lines
OsLEA3|OsLEA3-1	OsTPP1	bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP52/RISBZ5: a potential negative regulator of cold and drought stress response in rice	 Real-time PCR analysis revealed that some abiotic stress-related genes, such as OsLEA3, OsTPP1, Rab25, gp1 precursor, beta-gal, LOC_Os05g11910 and LOC_Os05g39250, were down-regulated in OsbZIP52 overexpression lines
OsTPP1	OsTPP2	Biochemical characterization of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases supports distinctive functions of these plant enzymes	 Here we report that OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 are the two major trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase genes expressed in vegetative tissues of rice
OsTPP1	OsTPP2	Biochemical characterization of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases supports distinctive functions of these plant enzymes	 Similar to results obtained from our previous OsTPP1 study, complementation analysis of a yeast trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase mutant and activity measurement of the recombinant protein demonstrated that OsTPP2 encodes a functional trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enzyme
OsTPP1	OsTPP2	Biochemical characterization of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases supports distinctive functions of these plant enzymes	 Enzymatic characterization of recombinant OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 revealed stringent substrate specificity for trehalose 6-phosphate and about 10 times lower K(m) values for trehalose 6-phosphate as compared with trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enzymes from microorganisms
OsTPP1	OsTPP2	Biochemical characterization of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases supports distinctive functions of these plant enzymes	 OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 also clearly contrasted with microbial enzymes, in that they are generally unstable, almost completely losing activity when subjected to heat treatment at 50 degrees C for 4 min
