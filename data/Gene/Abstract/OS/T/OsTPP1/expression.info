OsTPP1	 Under chilling stress, active OsMAPK3 phosphorylates OsbHLH002, leading to accumulation of phospho-OsbHLH002, which promotes OsTPP1 expression and increases trehalose content and resistance to chilling damage
OsTPP1	 <U+2022> Further analysis showed that transcription factor of OsGAMYB was an activator of OsTPP1, and expression of OsGAMYB was decreased by both the exogenous and endogenous ABA, subsequently reduced the expression of OsTPP1, which suggested a new signaling pathway required for seed germination in rice
