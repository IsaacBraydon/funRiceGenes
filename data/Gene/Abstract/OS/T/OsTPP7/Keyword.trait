OsTPP7|AG1	growth	A trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enhances anaerobic germination tolerance in rice.	OsTPP7 activity may increase sink strength in proliferating heterotrophic tissues by indicating low sugar availability through increased T6P turnover, thus enhancing starch mobilization to drive growth kinetics of the germinating embryo and elongating coleoptile, which consequently enhances anaerobic germination tolerance
OsTPP7|AG1	starch	A trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enhances anaerobic germination tolerance in rice.	OsTPP7 activity may increase sink strength in proliferating heterotrophic tissues by indicating low sugar availability through increased T6P turnover, thus enhancing starch mobilization to drive growth kinetics of the germinating embryo and elongating coleoptile, which consequently enhances anaerobic germination tolerance

OsTPP7 activity may increase sink strength in proliferating heterotrophic tissues by indicating low sugar availability through increased T6P turnover, thus enhancing starch mobilization to drive growth kinetics of the germinating embryo and elongating coleoptile, which consequently enhances anaerobic germination tolerance
OsTPP7|AG1	sugar	A trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enhances anaerobic germination tolerance in rice.

OsTPP7|AG1	sucrose	A trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enhances anaerobic germination tolerance in rice.	OsTPP7 is involved in trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) metabolism, central to an energy sensor that determines anabolism or catabolism depending on local sucrose availability(8,9)
