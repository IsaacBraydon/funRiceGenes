NA	A trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enhances anaerobic germination tolerance in rice.	2015	Nat Plants	International Rice Research Institute, DAPO Box 7777, Metro Manila, Philippines.	Global socioeconomic developments create strong incentives for farmers to shift from transplanted to direct-seeded rice (DSR) as a means of intensification and economization(1). Rice production must increase to ensure food security(2) and the bulk of this increase will have to be achieved through intensification of cultivation, because expansion of cultivated areas is reaching sustainable limits(3). Anaerobic germination tolerance, which enables uniform germination and seedling establishment under submergence(4), is a key trait for the development of tropical DSR varieties(5,6). Here, we identify a trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase gene, OsTPP7, as the genetic determinant in qAG-9-2, a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for anaerobic germination tolerance(7). OsTPP7 is involved in trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) metabolism, central to an energy sensor that determines anabolism or catabolism depending on local sucrose availability(8,9). OsTPP7 activity may increase sink strength in proliferating heterotrophic tissues by indicating low sugar availability through increased T6P turnover, thus enhancing starch mobilization to drive growth kinetics of the germinating embryo and elongating coleoptile, which consequently enhances anaerobic germination tolerance.
NA	Dissection of coleoptile elongation in japonica rice under submergence through integrated genome wide association mapping and transcriptional analyses.	2019	Plant Cell Environ	PlantLab, Institute of Life Sciences, Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, (Italy).	Rice is unique among cereals for its ability to germinate not only when submerged, but even under anoxic conditions. Rice germination under submergence or anoxia is characterized by a longer coleoptile and delay in radicle emergence. A panel of temperate and tropical japonica rice accessions showing a large variability in coleoptile length was used to investigate genetic factors involved in this developmental process. The ability of the Khao Hlan On rice landrace to vigorously germinate when submerged has been previously associated with the presence of the trehalose 6 phosphate phosphatase 7 (TPP7) gene. In this study, we found that, in the presence of TPP7, polymorphisms and transcriptional variations of the gene in coleoptile tissue were not related to differences in the final coleoptile length under submergence. In order to find new chromosomal regions associated with the different ability of rice to elongate the coleoptile under submergence, we used genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis on a panel of 273 japonica rice accessions. We discovered 11 significant marker-trait associations and identified candidate genes potentially involved in coleoptile length. Candidate gene expression analyses indicated that japonica rice genotypes possess complex genetic elements that control final coleoptile length under low oxygen.
NA	Flood resilience loci SUBMERGENCE 1 and ANAEROBIC GERMINATION 1 interact in seedlings established underwater	2020	Plant Direct	Department of Botany and Plant Sciences Center for Plant Cell Biology University of California Riverside Riverside CA USA.	Crops with resilience to multiple climatic stresses are essential for increased yield stability. Here, we evaluate the interaction between two loci associated with flooding survival in rice (Oryza sativa L.). ANAEROBIC GERMINATION 1 (AG1), encoding trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase 7 (TPP7), promotes mobilization of endosperm reserves to enhance the elongation of a hollow coleoptile in seeds that are seeded directly into shallow paddies. SUBMERGENCE 1 (SUB1), encoding the ethylene-responsive transcription factor SUB1A-1, confers tolerance to complete submergence by dampening carbohydrate catabolism, to enhance recovery upon desubmergence. Interactions between AG1/TPP7 and SUB1/SUB1A-1 were investigated under three flooding scenarios using four near-isogenic lines by surveying growth and survival. Pyramiding of the two loci does not negatively affect anaerobic germination or vegetative-stage submergence tolerance. However, the pyramided AG1 SUB1 genotype displays reduced survival when seeds are planted underwater and maintained under submergence for 16 d. To better understand the roles of TPP7 and SUB1A-1 and their interaction, temporal changes in carbohydrates and shoot transcriptomes were monitored in the four genotypes varying at the two loci at four developmental timeponts, from day 2 after seeding through day 14 of complete submergence. TPP7 enhances early coleoptile elongation, whereas SUB1A-1 promotes precocious photoautotrophy and then restricts underwater elongation. By contrast, pyramiding of the AG1 and SUB1 slows elongation growth, the transition to photoautotrophy, and survival. mRNA-sequencing highlights time-dependent and genotype-specific regulation of mRNAs associated with DNA repair, cell cycle, chromatin modification, plastid biogenesis, carbohydrate catabolism and transport, elongation growth, and other processes. These results suggest that interactions between AG1/TPP7 and SUB1/SUB1A-1 could impact seedling establishment if paddy depth is not effectively managed after direct seeding.
NA	Dynamic genome-wide association analysis and identification of candidate genes involved in anaerobic germination tolerance in rice	2021	Rice (N Y)	National Engineering Research Center of Plant Space Breeding, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Background: In Asian rice production, an increasing number of countries now choose the direct seeding mode because of rising costs, labour shortages and water shortages. The ability of rice seeds to undergo anaerobic germination (AG) plays an important role in the success of direct seeding.  Results: In this study, we used 2,123,725 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers based on resequencing to conduct a dynamic genome-wide association study (GWAS) of coleoptile length (CL) and coleoptile diameter (CD) in 209 natural rice populations. A total of 26 SNP loci were detected in these two phenotypes, of which 5 overlapped with previously reported loci (S1_ 39674301, S6_ 20797781, S7_ 18722403, S8_ 9946213, S11_ 19165397), and two sites were detected repeatedly at different time points (S3_ 24689629 and S5_ 27918754). We suggest that these 7 loci (-log10 (P) value > 7.3271) are the key sites that affect AG tolerance. To screen the candidate genes more effectively, we sequenced the transcriptome of the flooding-tolerant variety R151 in six key stages, including anaerobic (AN) and the oxygen conversion point (AN-A), and obtained high-quality differential expression profiles. Four reliable candidate genes were identified: Os01g0911700 (OsVP1), Os05g0560900 (OsGA2ox8), Os05g0562200 (OsDi19-1) and Os06g0548200. Then qRT-PCR and LC-MS/ MS targeting metabolite detection technology were used to further verify that the up-regulated expression of these four candidate genes was closely related to AG.  Conclusion: The four novel candidate genes were associated with gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) regulation and cell wall metabolism under oxygen-deficiency conditions and promoted coleoptile elongation while avoiding adverse effects, allowing the coleoptile to obtain oxygen, escape the low-oxygen environment and germinate rapidly. The results of this study improve our understanding of the genetic basis of AG in rice seeds, which is conducive to the selection of flooding-tolerant varieties suitable for direct seeding.
