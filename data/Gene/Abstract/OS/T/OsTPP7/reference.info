NA	A trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enhances anaerobic germination tolerance in rice.	2015	Nat Plants	International Rice Research Institute, DAPO Box 7777, Metro Manila, Philippines.	Global socioeconomic developments create strong incentives for farmers to shift from transplanted to direct-seeded rice (DSR) as a means of intensification and economization(1). Rice production must increase to ensure food security(2) and the bulk of this increase will have to be achieved through intensification of cultivation, because expansion of cultivated areas is reaching sustainable limits(3). Anaerobic germination tolerance, which enables uniform germination and seedling establishment under submergence(4), is a key trait for the development of tropical DSR varieties(5,6). Here, we identify a trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase gene, OsTPP7, as the genetic determinant in qAG-9-2, a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for anaerobic germination tolerance(7). OsTPP7 is involved in trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) metabolism, central to an energy sensor that determines anabolism or catabolism depending on local sucrose availability(8,9). OsTPP7 activity may increase sink strength in proliferating heterotrophic tissues by indicating low sugar availability through increased T6P turnover, thus enhancing starch mobilization to drive growth kinetics of the germinating embryo and elongating coleoptile, which consequently enhances anaerobic germination tolerance.
NA	Dissection of coleoptile elongation in japonica rice under submergence through integrated genome wide association mapping and transcriptional analyses.	2019	Plant Cell Environ	PlantLab, Institute of Life Sciences, Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, (Italy).	Rice is unique among cereals for its ability to germinate not only when submerged, but even under anoxic conditions. Rice germination under submergence or anoxia is characterized by a longer coleoptile and delay in radicle emergence. A panel of temperate and tropical japonica rice accessions showing a large variability in coleoptile length was used to investigate genetic factors involved in this developmental process. The ability of the Khao Hlan On rice landrace to vigorously germinate when submerged has been previously associated with the presence of the trehalose 6 phosphate phosphatase 7 (TPP7) gene. In this study, we found that, in the presence of TPP7, polymorphisms and transcriptional variations of the gene in coleoptile tissue were not related to differences in the final coleoptile length under submergence. In order to find new chromosomal regions associated with the different ability of rice to elongate the coleoptile under submergence, we used genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis on a panel of 273 japonica rice accessions. We discovered 11 significant marker-trait associations and identified candidate genes potentially involved in coleoptile length. Candidate gene expression analyses indicated that japonica rice genotypes possess complex genetic elements that control final coleoptile length under low oxygen.
