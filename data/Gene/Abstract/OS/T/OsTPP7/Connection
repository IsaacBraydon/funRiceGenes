OsTPP7|AG1	Sub1A	Flood resilience loci SUBMERGENCE 1 and ANAEROBIC GERMINATION 1 interact in seedlings established underwater	Flood resilience loci SUBMERGENCE 1 and ANAEROBIC GERMINATION 1 interact in seedlings established underwater
OsTPP7|AG1	Sub1A	Flood resilience loci SUBMERGENCE 1 and ANAEROBIC GERMINATION 1 interact in seedlings established underwater	To better understand the roles of TPP7 and SUB1A-1 and their interaction, temporal changes in carbohydrates and shoot transcriptomes were monitored in the four genotypes varying at the two loci at four developmental timeponts, from day 2 after seeding through day 14 of complete submergence.
OsTPP7|AG1	Sub1A	Flood resilience loci SUBMERGENCE 1 and ANAEROBIC GERMINATION 1 interact in seedlings established underwater	These results suggest that interactions between AG1/TPP7 and SUB1/SUB1A-1 could impact seedling establishment if paddy depth is not effectively managed after direct seeding.
HBP1|OsbHLH111|OsSGI1	OsTPP7|AG1	Sugar starvation activates the OsSnRK1a-OsbHLH111/OsSGI1-OsTPP7 module to mediate growth inhibition of rice.	 Subsequently, OsSnRK1a-dependent phosphorylation of OsSGI1 enhanced the direct binding to the E-box of trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase 7 (OsTPP7) promoter, thus rose the transcription inhibition on OsTPP7, then elevated trehalose 6-phosphate (Tre6P) content but decreased sucrose content
