OsTudor-SN	 Transcriptome analysis indicates that OsTudor-SN also functions in regulating gene expression of transcriptional factors and genes involved in developmental processes and stress responses as well as for storage proteins |  Normal protein body formation, grain weight, and expression of many genes were partially restored in EM1084 transgenic line complemented with wildtype OsTudor-SN gene |  Overall, our study showed that OsTudor-SN possesses multiple functional properties in rice storage protein expression and seed development and that the 4SN and Tsn modules have unique roles in these processes
