Previous studies have demonstrated that the major storage protein RNAs found in the rice endosperm are transported as particles via actomyosin to specific subdomains of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum. In this study, we examined the potential role of OsTudor-SN, a major cytoskeletal-associated RNA binding protein, in RNA transport and localization. OsTudor-SN molecules occur as high-molecular-weight forms, the integrity of which are sensitive to RNase. Immunoprecipitation followed by RT-PCR showed that OsTudor-SN binds prolamine and glutelin RNAs. Immunofluorescence studies using affinity-purified antibodies show that OsTudor-SNs exists as particles in the cytoplasm, and are distributed to both the protein body endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cisternal ER. Examination of OsTudor-SN particles in transgenic rice plants expressing GFP-tagged prolamine RNA transport particles showed co-localization of OsTudor-SN and GFP, suggesting a role in RNA transport. Consistent with this view, GFP-tagged OsTudor-SN is observed in living endosperm sections as moving particles, a property inhibited by microfilament inhibitors. Downregulation of OsTudor-SN by antisense and RNAi resulted in a decrease in steady state prolamine RNA and protein levels, and a reduction in the number of prolamine protein bodies. Collectively, these results show that OsTudor-SN is a component of the RNA transport particle, and may control storage protein biosynthesis by regulating one or more processes leading to the transport, localization and anchoring of their RNAs to the cortical ER.
NA	Multifunctional RNA binding protein OsTudor-SN in storage protein mRNA transport and localization.	2017	Plant Physiol	Washington State University CITY: Pullman STATE: WA POSTAL_CODE: 99163 United States Of America [US].	The multi-functional RNA binding protein (RBP) Tudor-SN plays multiple roles in transcription and post-transcriptional processes due to its modular domain structure consisting of four tandem staphylococcus nuclease (SN)-like domains (4SN) followed by a C-terminal Tudor domain containing partial SN sequences (Tsn). In plants, it confers stress tolerance, is a component of stress granules and P-bodies, and may participate in stabilizing and localizing RNAs to specific subdomains of the cortical-ER in developing rice endosperm. Here, we show that in addition to the intact rice OsTudor-SN protein, the 4SN and Tsn modules exist as independent polypeptides, which collectively may co-assemble to form a complex population of homoduplex and heteroduplex species. The 4SN and Tsn modules exhibit different roles in RNA binding and as a protein scaffold for stress-associated proteins and RNA binding proteins. Despite the distinct properties, mutations in both the 4SN and Tsn modules mis-localize storage protein mRNAs to the cortical ER. These results indicate that the two modular peptide regions of OsTudor-SN confer different cellular properties but cooperate in mRNA localization, a process linking its multiple functions in the nucleus and cytoplasm.
NA	The Role of RNA Binding Protein OsTudor-SN in Post-Transcriptional Regulation of Seed Storage Proteins and Endosperm Development.	2019	Plant Cell Physiol	Institute of Biological Chemistry Washington State University, Pullman, Washington.	Tudor-SN is involved in a myriad of transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes due to its modular structure consisting of 4 tandem SN domains (4SN module) and C-terminal Tsn module consisting of Tudor-partial SN domains. We had previously demonstrated that OsTudor-SN is a key player for transporting storage protein mRNAs to speciﬁc ER subdomains in developing rice endosperm. Here, we provide genetic evidence that this multi-functional RBP is required for storage protein expression, seed development and protein body formation. The rice EM1084 line, possessing a nonsynonymous mutation in the 4SN module (SN3 domain), exhibited a strong reduction in grain weight and storage protein accumulation, while a mutation in the Tudor domain (47M) or the loss of the Tsn module (43M) had much smaller effects. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis showed the presence of a new protein body type containing glutelin and prolamine inclusions in EM1084, while 43M and 47M exhibited structurally-modified prolamine and glutelin protein bodies. Transcriptome analysis indicates that OsTudor-SN also functions in regulating gene expression of transcriptional factors and genes involved in developmental processes and stress responses as well as for storage proteins. Normal protein body formation, grain weight, and expression of many genes were partially restored in EM1084 transgenic line complemented with wildtype OsTudor-SN gene. Overall, our study showed that OsTudor-SN possesses multiple functional properties in rice storage protein expression and seed development and that the 4SN and Tsn modules have unique roles in these processes.
