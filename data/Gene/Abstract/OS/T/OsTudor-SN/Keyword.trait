OsTudor-SN	endosperm	The cytoplasmic-localized, cytoskeletal-associated RNA binding protein OsTudor-SN: evidence for an essential role in storage protein RNA transport and localization	Consistent with this view, GFP-tagged OsTudor-SN is observed in living endosperm sections as moving particles, a property inhibited by microfilament inhibitors
OsTudor-SN	cytoplasm	Multifunctional RNA binding protein OsTudor-SN in storage protein mRNA transport and localization.	 These results indicate that the two modular peptide regions of OsTudor-SN confer different cellular properties but cooperate in mRNA localization, a process linking its multiple functions in the nucleus and cytoplasm
OsTudor-SN	nucleus	Multifunctional RNA binding protein OsTudor-SN in storage protein mRNA transport and localization.	 These results indicate that the two modular peptide regions of OsTudor-SN confer different cellular properties but cooperate in mRNA localization, a process linking its multiple functions in the nucleus and cytoplasm
OsTudor-SN	grain	The Role of RNA Binding Protein OsTudor-SN in Post-Transcriptional Regulation of Seed Storage Proteins and Endosperm Development.	 Normal protein body formation, grain weight, and expression of many genes were partially restored in EM1084 transgenic line complemented with wildtype OsTudor-SN gene
OsTudor-SN	development	The Role of RNA Binding Protein OsTudor-SN in Post-Transcriptional Regulation of Seed Storage Proteins and Endosperm Development.	 Overall, our study showed that OsTudor-SN possesses multiple functional properties in rice storage protein expression and seed development and that the 4SN and Tsn modules have unique roles in these processes
OsTudor-SN	seed	The Role of RNA Binding Protein OsTudor-SN in Post-Transcriptional Regulation of Seed Storage Proteins and Endosperm Development.	The Role of RNA Binding Protein OsTudor-SN in Post-Transcriptional Regulation of Seed Storage Proteins and Endosperm Development.
OsTudor-SN	seed	The Role of RNA Binding Protein OsTudor-SN in Post-Transcriptional Regulation of Seed Storage Proteins and Endosperm Development.

OsTudor-SN	stress	The Role of RNA Binding Protein OsTudor-SN in Post-Transcriptional Regulation of Seed Storage Proteins and Endosperm Development.	 Transcriptome analysis indicates that OsTudor-SN also functions in regulating gene expression of transcriptional factors and genes involved in developmental processes and stress responses as well as for storage proteins
OsTudor-SN	endosperm	The Role of RNA Binding Protein OsTudor-SN in Post-Transcriptional Regulation of Seed Storage Proteins and Endosperm Development.	The Role of RNA Binding Protein OsTudor-SN in Post-Transcriptional Regulation of Seed Storage Proteins and Endosperm Development.
OsTudor-SN	endosperm	The Role of RNA Binding Protein OsTudor-SN in Post-Transcriptional Regulation of Seed Storage Proteins and Endosperm Development.
