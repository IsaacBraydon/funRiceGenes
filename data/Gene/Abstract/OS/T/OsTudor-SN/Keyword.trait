OsTudor-SN	endosperm	The cytoplasmic-localized, cytoskeletal-associated RNA binding protein OsTudor-SN: evidence for an essential role in storage protein RNA transport and localization	Consistent with this view, GFP-tagged OsTudor-SN is observed in living endosperm sections as moving particles, a property inhibited by microfilament inhibitors
OsTudor-SN	cytoplasm	Multifunctional RNA binding protein OsTudor-SN in storage protein mRNA transport and localization.	 These results indicate that the two modular peptide regions of OsTudor-SN confer different cellular properties but cooperate in mRNA localization, a process linking its multiple functions in the nucleus and cytoplasm
OsTudor-SN	nucleus	Multifunctional RNA binding protein OsTudor-SN in storage protein mRNA transport and localization.	 These results indicate that the two modular peptide regions of OsTudor-SN confer different cellular properties but cooperate in mRNA localization, a process linking its multiple functions in the nucleus and cytoplasm
