R. China	The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors form a large gene family that is important in pathogen defense, light and stress signaling, etc. The Completed whole genome sequences of model plants Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa) constitute a valuable resource for genome-wide analysis and genomic comparative analysis, as they are representatives of the two major evolutionary lineages within the angiosperms: the monocotyledons and the dicotyledons. In this study, bioinformatics analysis identified 74, 89 and 88 bZIP genes respectively in Arabidopsis, rice and poplar. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of this gene family is presented, including the gene structure, phylogeny, chromosome distribution, conserved motifs. As a result, the plant bZIPs were organized into 10 subfamilies on basis of phylogenetic relationship. Gene duplication events during the family evolution history were also investigated. And it was further concluded that chromosomal/segmental duplication might have played a key role in gene expansion of bZIP gene family.
J. Biol. Chem.-2009-Okada-26510-8.pdf	OsTGAP1, a bZIP transcription factor, coordinately regulates the inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice	2009	J Biol Chem	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Production of major diterpenoid phytoalexins, momilactones and phytocassanes, is induced in rice upon recognition of pathogenic invasion as plant defense-related compounds. We recently showed that biosynthetic genes for momilactones are clustered on rice chromosome 4 and co-expressed after elicitation, mimicking pathogen attack. Because genes for most metabolic pathways in plants are not organized in gene clusters, examination of the mechanism(s) regulating the expression of such clustered genes is needed. Here, we report a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-inducible basic leucine zipper transcription factor, OsTGAP1, which is essential for momilactone biosynthesis and regulates the expression of the five genes in the cluster. The knock-out mutant for OsTGAP1 had almost no expression of the five clustered genes (OsCPS4, OsKSL4, CYP99A2, CYP99A3, and OsMAS) or production of momilactones upon elicitor treatment. Inductive expression of OsKSL7 for phytocassane biosynthesis was also largely affected in the ostgap1 mutant, although phytocassane accumulation still occurred. Conversely, OsTGAP1-overexpressing lines exhibited enhanced expression of the clustered genes and hyperaccumulation of momilactones in response to the elicitor. Furthermore, enhanced expression of OsKSL7 and hyperaccumulation of phytocassanes was also observed. We also found that OsTGAP1 overexpression can influence transcriptional up-regulation of OsDXS3 in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, eventually leading to inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins. These results indicate that OsTGAP1 functions as a key regulator of the coordinated transcription of genes involved in inductive diterpenoid phytoalexin production in rice and mainly exerts an essential role on expression of the clustered genes for momilactone biosynthesis.

The basic leucine (Leu) zipper (bZIP) proteins compose a family of transcriptional regulators present exclusively in eukaryotes. The bZIP proteins characteristically harbor a bZIP domain composed of two structural features: a DNA-binding basic region and the Leu zipper dimerization region. They have been shown to regulate diverse plant-specific phenomena, including seed maturation and germination, floral induction and development, and photomorphogenesis, and are also involved in stress and hormone signaling. We have identified 89 bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Their chromosomal distribution and sequence analyses suggest that the bZIP transcription factor family has evolved via gene duplication. The phylogenetic relationship among rice bZIP domains as well as with bZIP domains from other plant bZIP factors suggests that homologous bZIP domains exist in plants. Similar intron/exon structural patterns were observed in the basic and hinge regions of their bZIP domains. Detailed sequence analysis has been done to identify additional conserved motifs outside the bZIP domain and to predict their DNA-binding site specificity as well as dimerization properties, which has helped classify them into different groups and subfamilies, respectively. Expression of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes has been analyzed by full-length cDNA and expressed sequence tag-based expression profiling. This expression profiling was complemented by microarray analysis. The results indicate specific or coexpression patterns of rice bZIP transcription factors starting from floral transition to various stages of panicle and seed development. bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice also displayed differential expression patterns in rice seedlings in response to abiotic stress and light irradiation. An effort has been made to link the structure and expression pattern of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice to their function, based on the information obtained from our analyses and earlier known results. This information will be important for functional characterization of bZIP transcription factors in rice.
