NA	Regulatory Role of OsTDL1A-MSP1 Signaling in Specifying Anther Cell Identity in Rice.	2016	Plant Physiol	Shanghai Jiao Tong University CITY: Shanghai China [CN].	In flowering plants, sequential formation of anther cell types is a highly ordered process that is essential for successful meiosis and sexual reproduction. Differentiation of meristematic cells and cell-cell communication are proposed to coordinate anther development. Among the proposed mechanisms of cell fate specification are cell surface-localized leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) and their putative ligands. Here we present the genetic and biochemical evidence that a rice LRR-RLK, MSP1, interacts with its ligand OsTDL1A, specifying the cell identity of anther wall layers and microsporocytes. An in vitro assay indicates that the 21 amino-acid peptide of OsTDL1A has a physical interaction with the LRR domain of MSP1. ostdl1a msp1 double mutant showed the defect in lacking middle layers and tapetal cells, and having an increased number of microsporocytes similar to ostdl1a or msp1 single mutant, indicating the same pathway of OsTDL1A-MSP1 in regulating anther development. Genome-wide expression profiles showed the altered expression of genes encoding transcription factors, particularly basic helix-loop-helix and basic leucine zipper domain transcription factors in ostdl1a and msp1. Among these reduced expressed genes, one putatively encodes a TGA (TGACGTCA cis-element-binding protein) factor OsTGA10, and another one encodes a plant-specific CC-type glutaredoxin OsGrx_I1. OsTGA10 was shown to interact with OsGrx_I1, suggesting that OsTDL1A-MSP1 signaling specifies anther cell fate directly or indirectly affecting redox status. Collectively, these data point to a central role of the OsTDL1A-MSP1 signaling pathway in specifying somatic cell identity and suppressing over-proliferation of archesporial cells in rice.
NA	The basic leucine zipper transcription factor OsbZIP83 and the glutaredoxins OsGRX6 and OsGRX9 facilitate rice iron utilization under the control of OsHRZ ubiquitin ligases.	2022	Plant J	Research Institute for Bioresources and Biotechnology, Ishikawa Prefectural University, 1-308 Suematsu, Nonoichi, Ishikawa, 921-8836, Japan.	Under low iron availability, plants induce the expression of various genes for iron uptake and translocation. The rice (Oryza sativa) ubiquitin ligases OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 cause overall repression of these iron-related genes at the transcript level, but their protein-level regulation is unclear. We conducted a proteome analysis to identify key regulators whose abundance was regulated by OsHRZs at the protein level. In response to iron deficiency or OsHRZ knockdown, many genes showed differential regulation between the transcript and protein levels, including the TGA-type basic leucine zipper transcription factor OsbZIP83. We also identified two glutaredoxins, OsGRX6 and OsGRX9, as OsHRZ-interacting proteins in yeast and plant cells. OsGRX6 also interacted with OsbZIP83. Our in vitro degradation assay suggested that OsbZIP83, OsGRX6 and OsGRX9 proteins and OsHRZ-dependent degradation. Proteome analysis and our in vitro degradation assay also suggested that OsbZIP83 protein was preferentially degraded under iron-deficient conditions in rice roots. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsGRX9 and OsbZIP83 showed improved tolerance to iron deficiency. Expression of iron-related genes was affected in the OsGRX9 and OsGRX6 knockdown lines, suggesting disturbed iron utilization and signaling. OsbZIP83 overexpression lines showed enhanced expression of OsYSL2 and OsNAS3, which are involved in internal iron translocation, in addition to OsGRX9 and genes related to phytoalexin biosynthesis and the salicylic acid pathway. The results suggest that OsbZIP83, OsGRX6 and OsGRX9 facilitate iron utilization downstream of the OsHRZ pathway.
