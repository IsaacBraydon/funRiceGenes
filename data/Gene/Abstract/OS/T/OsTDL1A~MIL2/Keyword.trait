OsTDL1A|MIL2	anther	MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther	 We report here that the gene MICROSPORELESS2 (MIL2) regulates early anther cell differentiation in rice (Oryza sativa)
OsTDL1A|MIL2	anther	MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther	 The anthers of mil2 mutants were characterized using molecular markers and cytological examination
OsTDL1A|MIL2	anther	MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther	 However, mil2 anthers display phenotypes different from those of tpd1 mutants, with only two layers of anther wall cells formed
OsTDL1A|MIL2	anther	MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther	 Our results demonstrate that MIL2 is responsible for the differentiation of primary parietal cells into secondary parietal cells in rice anthers, and suggest that rice and Arabidopsis anthers might share similar regulators in anther patterning, but divergent mechanisms are employed in these processes
OsTDL1A|MIL2	anther	MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther	MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther
OsTDL1A|MIL2	microspore	MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther	 We report here that the gene MICROSPORELESS2 (MIL2) regulates early anther cell differentiation in rice (Oryza sativa)
OsTDL1A|MIL2	microspore	MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther	MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther
OsTDL1A|MIL2	meiosis	OsTDL1A binds to the LRR domain of rice receptor kinase MSP1, and is required to limit sporocyte numbers	 Both are co-expressed with MSP1 in anthers during meiosis, but only OsTDL1A and MSP1 are co-expressed in the ovule
OsTDL1A|MIL2	anther	OsTDL1A binds to the LRR domain of rice receptor kinase MSP1, and is required to limit sporocyte numbers	 Both are co-expressed with MSP1 in anthers during meiosis, but only OsTDL1A and MSP1 are co-expressed in the ovule
OsTDL1A|MIL2	anther	OsTDL1A binds to the LRR domain of rice receptor kinase MSP1, and is required to limit sporocyte numbers	 When driven by the maize Ubiquitin1 promoter, RNA interference against OsTDL1A phenocopies msp1 in the ovule but not in the anther
OsTDL1A|MIL2	tapetum	MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther	 MIL2 encodes the rice homolog of the Arabidopsis TAPETUM DETERMINANT1 (TPD1) protein
