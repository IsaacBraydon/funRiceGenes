OsTrx1|SDG723	flowering time	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	Here, we observed that suppression of Oryza sativa Trithorax1 (OsTrx1), an ortholog of ATX1, delayed flowering time in rice (Oryza sativa)
OsTrx1|SDG723	flowering time	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	Our results suggest that OsTrx1 plays an important role in regulating flowering time in rice by modulating chromatin structure
OsTrx1|SDG723	height	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1
OsTrx1|SDG723	grain number	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1
