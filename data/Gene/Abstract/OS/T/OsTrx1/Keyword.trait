OsTrx1|SDG723	flowering time	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	Here, we observed that suppression of Oryza sativa Trithorax1 (OsTrx1), an ortholog of ATX1, delayed flowering time in rice (Oryza sativa)
OsTrx1|SDG723	flowering time	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	Our results suggest that OsTrx1 plays an important role in regulating flowering time in rice by modulating chromatin structure
OsTrx1|SDG723	height	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1
OsTrx1|SDG723	grain number	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1

OsTrx1|SDG723	grain	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1
OsTrx1|SDG723	heading date	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1
OsTrx1|SDG723	heading date	OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.	OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.
OsTrx1|SDG723	heading date	OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.	 Together, our results (i) reveal that OsHUB2 represses the function of OsTrx1 and H3K4me3 levels at Ehd1 and (ii) suggest that OsHUB2-mediated H2B ubiquitination plays critical roles together with H3K4me3 in rice heading date regulation
