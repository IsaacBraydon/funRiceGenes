Ehd3	OsTrx1|SDG723	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	We demonstrated that the plant homeodomain motif of OsTrx1 binds to native histone H3 from the calf thymus and that OsTrx1 binds to Ehd3 through the region between the plant homeodomain and SET domains
Ghd7	OsTrx1|SDG723	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1
Ghd7	OsTrx1|SDG723	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	Because Trx group proteins form a complex with other proteins to modify the chromatin structure of target genes, we investigated whether OsTrx1 interacts with a previously identified protein that functions upstream of Ghd7
OsTrx1|SDG723	OsWDR5a|OsWDR5	The COMPASS-like complex promotes flowering and panicle branching in rice.	 Plants in which OsWDR5a or OsTrx1 expression was decreased by RNA interference produced fewer secondary branches and less grain, and exhibited a delayed heading date under long-day and short-day conditions, whereas loss of OsWDR5a function resulted in embryo lethality
OsTrx1|SDG723	SIP1|OsSUF4	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.
OsTrx1|SDG723	SIP1|OsSUF4	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.	 Here, we show that the rice TRITHORAX-like protein OsTrx1 is recruited to its target, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), by the C2H2 zinc finger protein SDG723/OsTrx1/OsSET33 Interaction Protein 1 (SIP1)
OsTrx1|SDG723	SIP1|OsSUF4	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.	 SIP1 binds to the promoter of Ehd1 and interacts with OsTrx1
OsTrx1|SDG723	SIP1|OsSUF4	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.	 Defects in OsTrx1 or SIP1 led to reduced H3K4me3 levels at Ehd1, thus reducing Ehd1 expression
OsTrx1|SDG723	SIP1|OsSUF4	SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.	 Together, our results show that the transcription factor SIP1 interacts with OxTrx1, allowing OsTrx1 to specifically target Ehd1, altering H3K4me3 levels, increasing Ehd1 expression and thereby promoting flowering
OsRLR4	OsTrx1|SDG723	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	 Moreover, OsRLR4 interacts with the TRITHORAX-like protein OsTrx1 to promote H3K4me3 deposition at the OsAUX1 promoter, thus altering its transcription level
Ehd1	OsTrx1|SDG723	OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.	 OsTrx1 were highly enriched at Ehd1, and H3K4me3 levels of Ehd1 were upregulated in oshub2-2
Ehd1	OsTrx1|SDG723	OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.	 Together, our results (i) reveal that OsHUB2 represses the function of OsTrx1 and H3K4me3 levels at Ehd1 and (ii) suggest that OsHUB2-mediated H2B ubiquitination plays critical roles together with H3K4me3 in rice heading date regulation
H2B	OsTrx1|SDG723	OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.	 Together, our results (i) reveal that OsHUB2 represses the function of OsTrx1 and H3K4me3 levels at Ehd1 and (ii) suggest that OsHUB2-mediated H2B ubiquitination plays critical roles together with H3K4me3 in rice heading date regulation
OsHUB2|FRRP1	OsTrx1|SDG723	OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.	OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.
OsHUB2|FRRP1	OsTrx1|SDG723	OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.	 OsHUB2 interacted with OsTrx1 and repressed the gene expression of OsTrx1
OsHUB2|FRRP1	OsTrx1|SDG723	OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.	 Together, our results (i) reveal that OsHUB2 represses the function of OsTrx1 and H3K4me3 levels at Ehd1 and (ii) suggest that OsHUB2-mediated H2B ubiquitination plays critical roles together with H3K4me3 in rice heading date regulation
ONAC083	OsTrx1|SDG723	The NAC transcription factor ONAC083 negatively regulates rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae by directly activating transcription of the RING-H2 gene OsRFPH2-6.	 ONAC083 activated the transcription of the genes OsRFPH2-6, OsTrx1, and OsPUP4 by directly binding to the ACGCAA element
