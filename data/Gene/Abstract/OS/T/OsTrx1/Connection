Ehd3	OsTrx1|SDG723	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	 We demonstrated that the plant homeodomain motif of OsTrx1 binds to native histone H3 from the calf thymus and that OsTrx1 binds to Ehd3 through the region between the plant homeodomain and SET domains
Ghd7	OsTrx1|SDG723	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	 However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1
Ghd7	OsTrx1|SDG723	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	 Because Trx group proteins form a complex with other proteins to modify the chromatin structure of target genes, we investigated whether OsTrx1 interacts with a previously identified protein that functions upstream of Ghd7
