Plant cells contain several thioredoxin isoforms that are characterized by subcellular localization and substrate specificity. Here, we describe the functional characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) thioredoxin m isoform (Ostrxm) using a reverse genetics technique. Ostrxm showed green tissue-specific and light-responsive mRNA expression. Ostrxm was localized in chloroplasts of rice mesophyll cells, and the recombinant protein showed dithiothreitol-dependent insulin beta-chain reduction activity in vitro. RNA interference (RNAi) of Ostrxm resulted in rice plants with developmental defects, including semidwarfism, pale-green leaves, abnormal chloroplast structure, and reduced carotenoid and chlorophyll content. Ostrxm RNAi plants showed remarkably decreased F(v)/F(m) values under high irradiance conditions (1,000 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) with delayed recovery. Two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis showed that the levels of several chloroplast proteins critical for photosynthesis and biogenesis were significantly decreased in Ostrxm RNAi plants. Furthermore, 2-Cys peroxiredoxin, a known target of thioredoxin, was present in oxidized forms, and hydrogen peroxide levels were increased in Ostrxm RNAi plants. The pleiotropic effects of Ostrxm RNAi suggest that Ostrxm plays an important role in the redox regulation of chloroplast target proteins involved in diverse physiological functions.
NA	Repressed OsMESL expression triggers reactive oxygen species mediated broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice	2021	Plant Biotechnol J	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, P. R. China.	A few reports have indicated that a single gene confer resistance to bacterial blight, sheath blight, and rice blast. In this study, we identified a novel disease resistance mutant gene, methyl esterase-like (osmesl) in rice. Mutant rice with T-DNA insertion displayed significant resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), sheath blight caused by Rhizoctonia solani and rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae. Additionally, CRISPR-Cas9 knockout mutants and RNAi lines displayed resistance to these pathogens. Complementary T-DNA mutants demonstrated a phenotype similar to the wild type (WT), thereby indicating that osmesl confers resistance to pathogens. Protein interaction experiments revealed that OsMESL affects reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation by interacting with thioredoxin OsTrxm in rice. Moreover, qRT-PCR results showed significantly reduced mRNA levels of multiple ROS scavenging-related genes in osmesl mutants. Nitroblue tetrazolium staining showed that the pathogens cause ROS accumulation, and quantitative detection revealed significantly increased levels of H2 O2 in the leaves of osmesl mutants and RNAi lines after infection. The abundance of JA, a hormone associated with disease resistance, was significantly more in osmesl mutants than in WT plants. Overall, these results suggested that osmesl enhances disease resistance to Xoo, R. solani and M. oryzae by modulating the ROS balance.
