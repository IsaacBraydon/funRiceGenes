OsTF1L	Overexpression of OsTF1L, a rice HD-Zip transcription factor, promotes lignin biosynthesis and stomatal closure that improves drought tolerance. |  Overexpression of the OsTF1L in rice significantly increased drought tolerance at the vegetative stages of growth and promoted both effective photosynthesis and a reduction in the water loss rate under drought conditions |  Genome-wide analysis of OsTF1L overexpression plants revealed up-regulation of drought-inducible, stomatal movement and lignin biosynthetic genes |  Overexpression of OsTF1L promoted accumulation of lignin in shoots, whereas the RNAi lines showed opposite patterns of lignin accumulation |  In addition, OsTF1L overexpression enhances stomatal closure under drought conditions resulted in drought tolerance	Overexpression of OsTF1L, a rice HD-Zip transcription factor, promotes lignin biosynthesis and stomatal closure that improves drought tolerance. |  Overexpression of the OsTF1L in rice significantly increased drought tolerance at the vegetative stages of growth and promoted both effective photosynthesis and a reduction in the water loss rate under drought conditions |  Genome-wide analysis of OsTF1L overexpression plants revealed up-regulation of drought-inducible, stomatal movement and lignin biosynthetic genes |  Overexpression of OsTF1L promoted accumulation of lignin in shoots, whereas the RNAi lines showed opposite patterns of lignin accumulation |  In addition, OsTF1L overexpression enhances stomatal closure under drought conditions resulted in drought tolerance	 Overexpression of OsTF1L promoted accumulation of lignin in shoots, whereas the RNAi lines showed opposite patterns of lignin accumulation
