OsTPKa	OsTPKb	Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles	The Oryza sativa genome encodes two TPK isoforms (TPKa and TPKb) that have very similar sequences and are ubiquitously expressed
OsTPKa	OsTPKb	Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles	In spite of high levels of similarity in sequence and transport properties, the cellular localization of TPKa and TPKb channels was different, with TPKa localization predominantly at the large LV and TPKb primarily in smaller PSV-type compartments
OsTPKa	OsTPKb	Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles	Trafficking of TPKa was sensitive to brefeldin A, while that of TPKb was not
OsTPKa	OsTPKb	Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles	The use of TPKa:TPKb chimeras showed that C-terminal domains are crucial for the differential targeting of TPKa and TPKb
OsTPKa	OsTPKb	Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles	Site-directed mutagenesis of C-terminal residues that were different between TPKa and TPKb identified three amino acids that are important in determining ultimate vacuolar destination
OsHAK_like	OsTPKa	Functional genomic analysis of K(+) related salt-responsive transporters in tolerant and sensitive genotypes of rice.	 These are OsTPKa or Vacuolar two-pore potassium channel and OsHAK_like or a hypothetical protein of the HAK family
OsHAK_like	OsTPKa	Functional genomic analysis of K(+) related salt-responsive transporters in tolerant and sensitive genotypes of rice.	 For further insight, OsTPKa and OsHAK_like were chosen for loss-of-function genomic analysis in Horkuch using the CRISPR/Cas9 tool
OsHAK_like	OsTPKa	Functional genomic analysis of K(+) related salt-responsive transporters in tolerant and sensitive genotypes of rice.	 RESULTS: The promoter sequences of the OsTPKa and OsHAK_like genes showed some significant differences in promoter sequences which may give a survival advantage to Horkuch under salt-stress
OsHAK_like	OsTPKa	Functional genomic analysis of K(+) related salt-responsive transporters in tolerant and sensitive genotypes of rice.	 DISCUSSION: The poor performance of the transgenic plants with the down-regulated genes OsTPKa and OsHAK_like under salt stress supports the assumption that OsTPKa and OsHAK_like play important roles in defending the rice landrace Horkuch against salt stress, minimizing salt injury, and maintaining plant growth
