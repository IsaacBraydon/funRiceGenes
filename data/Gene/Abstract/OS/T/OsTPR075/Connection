Hd3a	OsTPR075	The tetratricopeptide repeat protein OsTPR075 promotes heading by regulating florigen transport in rice.	 Furthermore, we show that the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein OsTPR075 interacts with both OsFTIP9 and OsFTIP1 and strengthens their respective interactions with Hd3a and the florigen RFT1
OsFTIP1	OsTPR075	The tetratricopeptide repeat protein OsTPR075 promotes heading by regulating florigen transport in rice.	 Furthermore, we show that the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein OsTPR075 interacts with both OsFTIP9 and OsFTIP1 and strengthens their respective interactions with Hd3a and the florigen RFT1

OsTPR075	SaM	The tetratricopeptide repeat protein OsTPR075 promotes heading by regulating florigen transport in rice.	 Our findings suggest that florigen transport in rice is mediated by different OsFTIPs under different photoperiods and that interactions between OsTPR075 and OsFTIPs are essential for mediating florigen movement from leaves to the SAM
