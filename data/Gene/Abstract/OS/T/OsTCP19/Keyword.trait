OsTCP19	root	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	Overexpression of OsTCP19 in Arabidopsis caused upregulation of IAA3, ABI3 and ABI4 and downregulation of LOX2, and led to developmental abnormalities like fewer lateral root formation
OsTCP19	abiotic stress	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.
OsTCP19	stress	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.
OsTCP19	stress	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	Thus, OsTCP19 appears to be an important node in cell signaling which crosslinks stress and developmental pathways
OsTCP19	lateral root	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	Overexpression of OsTCP19 in Arabidopsis caused upregulation of IAA3, ABI3 and ABI4 and downregulation of LOX2, and led to developmental abnormalities like fewer lateral root formation
OsTCP19	abscisic acid	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	Interactions of OsTCP19 with OsABI4 and OsULT1 further suggest its function in modulation of abscisic acid pathways and chromatin structure
OsTCP19	biotic stress	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.
OsTCP19	node	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	Thus, OsTCP19 appears to be an important node in cell signaling which crosslinks stress and developmental pathways
OsTCP19	nitrogen	Genomic basis of geographical adaptation to soil nitrogen in rice	 Using a panel of diverse rice germplasm collected from different ecogeographical regions, we performed a genome-wide association study on the tillering response to nitrogen-the trait that is most closely correlated with nitrogen-use efficiency in rice-and identified OsTCP19 as a modulator of this tillering response through its transcriptional response to nitrogen and its targeting to the tiller-promoting gene DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING (DLT)3,4
OsTCP19	nitrogen	Genomic basis of geographical adaptation to soil nitrogen in rice	 A 29-bp insertion and/or deletion in the OsTCP19 promoter confers a differential transcriptional response and variation in the tillering response to nitrogen among rice varieties
OsTCP19	nitrogen	Genomic basis of geographical adaptation to soil nitrogen in rice	 The allele of OsTCP19 associated with a high tillering response to nitrogen is prevalent in wild rice populations, but has largely been lost in modern cultivars: this loss correlates with increased local soil nitrogen content, which suggests that it might have contributed to geographical adaptation in rice
OsTCP19	tillering	Genomic basis of geographical adaptation to soil nitrogen in rice	 Using a panel of diverse rice germplasm collected from different ecogeographical regions, we performed a genome-wide association study on the tillering response to nitrogen-the trait that is most closely correlated with nitrogen-use efficiency in rice-and identified OsTCP19 as a modulator of this tillering response through its transcriptional response to nitrogen and its targeting to the tiller-promoting gene DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING (DLT)3,4
