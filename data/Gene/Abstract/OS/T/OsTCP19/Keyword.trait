OsTCP19	root	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	 Overexpression of OsTCP19 in Arabidopsis caused upregulation of IAA3, ABI3 and ABI4 and downregulation of LOX2, and led to developmental abnormalities like fewer lateral root formation
OsTCP19	abiotic stress	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.
OsTCP19	stress	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.
OsTCP19	stress	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	 Thus, OsTCP19 appears to be an important node in cell signaling which crosslinks stress and developmental pathways
OsTCP19	lateral root	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	 Overexpression of OsTCP19 in Arabidopsis caused upregulation of IAA3, ABI3 and ABI4 and downregulation of LOX2, and led to developmental abnormalities like fewer lateral root formation
OsTCP19	abscisic acid	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	 Interactions of OsTCP19 with OsABI4 and OsULT1 further suggest its function in modulation of abscisic acid pathways and chromatin structure
OsTCP19	biotic stress	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.
OsTCP19	node	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	 Thus, OsTCP19 appears to be an important node in cell signaling which crosslinks stress and developmental pathways
