OsTBP2	OsTFIIB	Rice TATA Binding Protein Interacts Functionally with Transcription Factor IIB and the RF2a bZIP Transcriptional Activator in an Enhanced Plant in Vitro Transcription System	 Recombinant rice TFIIB (OsTFIIB) stimulated the DNA binding and bending activities of OsTBP2 and synergistically enhanced OsTBP2-mediated transcription from the pal promoter and the promoter of Rice tungro bacilliform virus but not from the barley pr1 promoter
OsTBP2	OsTFIIB	Rice TATA Binding Protein Interacts Functionally with Transcription Factor IIB and the RF2a bZIP Transcriptional Activator in an Enhanced Plant in Vitro Transcription System	 We conclude that OsTBP2 undergoes promoter-specific functional interactions with both the basal transcription factor OsTFIIB and the accessory transcription factor RF2a
OsTBP2	RF2a|OsbZIP75	Rice TATA Binding Protein Interacts Functionally with Transcription Factor IIB and the RF2a bZIP Transcriptional Activator in an Enhanced Plant in Vitro Transcription System	 We also demonstrate a physical interaction between OsTBP2 and RF2a, a rice bZIP transcription factor that bound to the box II cis element of the promoter of Rice tungro bacilliform virus, resulting in enhanced transcription from the viral promoter
OsTBP2	RF2a|OsbZIP75	Rice TATA Binding Protein Interacts Functionally with Transcription Factor IIB and the RF2a bZIP Transcriptional Activator in an Enhanced Plant in Vitro Transcription System	 We conclude that OsTBP2 undergoes promoter-specific functional interactions with both the basal transcription factor OsTFIIB and the accessory transcription factor RF2a
