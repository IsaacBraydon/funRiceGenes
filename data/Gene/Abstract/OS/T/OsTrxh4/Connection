LTN1|OsPHO2	OsTrxh4	Two h-type thioredoxins interact with the PHO2ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme to fine-tune phosphate homeostasis.	A yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) screen in Oryza sativa (Os, rice) using OsPHO2 as bait, revealed an interaction between OsPHO2 and two h-type thioredoxins, OsTrxh1 and OsTrxh4
