OsTTLL12	growth	A rice tubulin tyrosine ligase-like 12 protein affects the dynamic and orientation of microtubules.	 Thus, the elevated tubulin detyrosination in consequence of OsTTLL12 overexpression affects structural and dynamic features of microtubules, followed by changes in the axiality of cell plate deposition and, consequently, plant growth
