OsTTLL12	 To get insight into the biological functions of these potential TTL homologs, we cloned the rice TTL-like 12 protein (OsTTLL12) and generated overexpression OsTTLL12-RFP lines in both rice and tobacco BY-2 cells |  We found, unexpectedly, that overexpression of this OsTTLL12-RFP increased the relative abundance of detyrosinated α-tubulin in both coleoptile and seminal root, correlated with more stable microtubules |  Thus, the elevated tubulin detyrosination in consequence of OsTTLL12 overexpression affects structural and dynamic features of microtubules, followed by changes in the axiality of cell plate deposition and, consequently, plant growth	 To get insight into the biological functions of these potential TTL homologs, we cloned the rice TTL-like 12 protein (OsTTLL12) and generated overexpression OsTTLL12-RFP lines in both rice and tobacco BY-2 cells |  We found, unexpectedly, that overexpression of this OsTTLL12-RFP increased the relative abundance of detyrosinated α-tubulin in both coleoptile and seminal root, correlated with more stable microtubules |  Thus, the elevated tubulin detyrosination in consequence of OsTTLL12 overexpression affects structural and dynamic features of microtubules, followed by changes in the axiality of cell plate deposition and, consequently, plant growth
