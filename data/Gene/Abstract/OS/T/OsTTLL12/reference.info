NA	A rice tubulin tyrosine ligase-like 12 protein affects the dynamic and orientation of microtubules.	2021	J Integr Plant Biol	Molecular Cell Biology, Botanical Institute, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, 76131, Germany.	The detyrosination/retyrosination cycle is the most common post-translational modification of α-tubulin. Removal of the conserved C-terminal tyrosine of α-tubulin by a still elusive tubulin tyrosine carboxypeptidase, and religation of this tyrosine by a tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL), are probably common to all eukaryotes. Interestingly, for plants, the only candidates qualifying as potential TTL homologs are the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like 12 proteins. To get insight into the biological functions of these potential TTL homologs, we cloned the rice TTL-like 12 protein (OsTTLL12) and generated overexpression OsTTLL12-RFP lines in both rice and tobacco BY-2 cells. We found, unexpectedly, that overexpression of this OsTTLL12-RFP increased the relative abundance of detyrosinated α-tubulin in both coleoptile and seminal root, correlated with more stable microtubules. This was independent of the respective orientation of cortical microtubule, and followed by correspondingly changing growth of coleoptiles and seminal roots. A perturbed organization of phragmoplast microtubules and disoriented cell walls were further characteristics of this phenotype. Thus, the elevated tubulin detyrosination in consequence of OsTTLL12 overexpression affects structural and dynamic features of microtubules, followed by changes in the axiality of cell plate deposition and, consequently, plant growth.
NA	A rice tubulin tyrosine ligase like 12 regulates phospholipase D activity and tubulin synthesis.	2021	Plant Sci	Molecular Cell Biology, Botanical Institute, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Fritz-Haber-Weg 4, 76131, Karlsruhe, Germany.	All plant α-tubulins encode a C-terminal tyrosine. An elusive tubulin tyrosine carboxypeptidase can cleave off, and a tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL) re-ligate this tyrosine. The biological function of this cycle remains unclear but may correlate with microtubule stability. To get insight into the functional context of this phenomenon, we used cold-induced elimination of microtubules as experimental model. In previous work, we had analysed a rice TTL-like 12 (OsTTLL12), the only potential candidate of plant TTL. To follow the effect of OsTTLL12 upon microtubule responses in vivo, we expressed OsTTLL12-RFP into tobacco BY-2 cells stably overexpressing NtTUA3-GFP. We found that overexpression of OsTTLL12-RFP made microtubules disappear faster in response to cold stress, accompanied with more rapid Ca(2+) influx, culminating in reduced cold tolerance. Treatment with different butanols indicated that α-tubulin detyrosination/tyrosination differently interacts with phospholipase D (PLD) dependent signalling. In fact, rice PLDα1 decorated microtubules and increased detyrosinated α-tubulin. Unexpectedly, overexpression of the two proteins (OsTTLL12-RFP, NtTUA3-GFP) mutually regulated the accumulation of their transcripts, leading us to a model, where tubulin detyrosination feeds back upon tubulin transcripts and defines a subset of microtubules for interaction with PLD dependent stress signalling.
