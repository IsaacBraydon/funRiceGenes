OsTPS8	salinity	OsTPS8 controls yield-related traits and confers salt stress tolerance in rice by enhancing suberin deposition.	 Overexpression of OsTPS8 was adequate to confer enhanced salinity tolerance without any yield penalty, suggesting its usefulness in rice genetic improvement
OsTPS8	salt	OsTPS8 controls yield-related traits and confers salt stress tolerance in rice by enhancing suberin deposition.	OsTPS8 controls yield-related traits and confers salt stress tolerance in rice by enhancing suberin deposition.
OsTPS8	salt	OsTPS8 controls yield-related traits and confers salt stress tolerance in rice by enhancing suberin deposition.	 The ostps8 mutant showed salt sensitivity, ABA sensitivity and altered agronomic traits compared to the wild-type (WT), which could be rescued upon complementation
OsTPS8	tolerance	OsTPS8 controls yield-related traits and confers salt stress tolerance in rice by enhancing suberin deposition.	OsTPS8 controls yield-related traits and confers salt stress tolerance in rice by enhancing suberin deposition.
