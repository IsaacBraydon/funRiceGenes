Pathogen/microbe- or plant-derived signaling molecules (PAMPs/MAMPs/DAMPs) or elicitors induce increases in the cytosolic concentration of free Ca(2+) followed by a series of defense responses including biosynthesis of antimicrobial secondary metabolites called phytoalexins; however, the molecular links and regulatory mechanisms of the phytoalexin biosynthesis remains largely unknown. A putative voltage-gated cation channel, OsTPC1 has been shown to play a critical role in hypersensitive cell death induced by a fungal xylanase protein (TvX) in suspension-cultured rice cells. Here we show that TvX induced a prolonged increase in cytosolic Ca(2+), mainly due to a Ca(2+) influx through the plasma membrane. Membrane fractionation by two-phase partitioning and immunoblot analyses revealed that OsTPC1 is localized predominantly at the plasma membrane. In retrotransposon-insertional Ostpc1 knock-out cell lines harboring a Ca(2+)-sensitive photoprotein, aequorin, TvX-induced Ca(2+) elevation was significantly impaired, which was restored by expression of OsTPC1. TvX-induced production of major diterpenoid phytoalexins and the expression of a series of diterpene cyclase genes involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis were also impaired in the Ostpc1 cells. Whole cell patch clamp analyses of OsTPC1 heterologously expressed in HEK293T cells showed its voltage-dependent Ca(2+)-permeability. These results suggest that OsTPC1 plays a crucial role in TvX-induced Ca(2+) influx as a plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channel consequently required for the regulation of phytoalexin biosynthesis in cultured rice cells.
Plant Cell Physiol-2004-Hashimoto-496-500.pdf	Functional analysis of a rice putative voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel, OsTPC1, expressed in yeast cells lacking its homologous gene CCH1	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Biotechnology and Life Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Koganei, Tokyo, 184-8588 Japan.	We isolated a cDNA (OsTPC1) from rice that was homologous to AtTPC1, a putative voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel (VDCC) gene of Arabidopsis thaliana. The hydropathy profile of its deduced amino acid sequence showed significant structural features of the alpha 1-subunit of animal VDCCs. Functional analysis using a heterologous yeast expression system showed that OsTPC1 facilitates Ca(2+) permeation. The K(m) value for Ca(2+) of OsTPC1, 47.5 micro M, was comparable to that of intrinsic CCH1, a candidate VDCC in yeast. Ca(2+) permeation by OsTPC1 was inhibited by verapamil, a VDCC blocker. These findings indicate for the first time that OsTPC1 is a putative VDCC in rice.
Plant Cell Physiol-2004-Kurusu-693-702.pdf	Identification of a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ -permeable channel (OsTPC1) involved in Ca2+ influx and regulation of growth and development in rice	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Applied Biological Science, Tokyo University of Science, 2641 Yamazaki, Noda, Chiba, 278-8510 Japan.	Cytosolic free Ca2+ serves as an important second messenger participating in signal transduction of various environmental stresses. However, molecular bases for the plasma membrane Ca2+ influx and its regulation remain largely unknown. We here identified a gene (OsTPC1) encoding a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ channel from rice, ubiquitously expressed in mature leaves, shoots and roots as well as in cultured cells. OsTPC1 rescued the Ca2+ uptake activity and growth rate of a yeast mutant cch1. To elucidate its physiological roles, we generated transgenic rice plants and cultured cells overexpressing OsTPC1 mRNA. Furthermore, a retrotransposon (Tos17) insertional knockout mutant of OsTPC1 was isolated. OsTPC1-overexpressing cells showed hypersensitivity to excess Ca2+ but higher growth rate under Ca2+ limitation, while growth of the OsTPC1-knockout cultured cells was less sensitive to extracellular free Ca2+ concentration, suggesting that OsTPC1 has Ca2+ transport activity across the plasma membrane. OsTPC1-overexpressing plants showed reduced growth and abnormal greening of roots. Growth of Ostpc1 seedlings was comparable to the control on agar plates, while significantly reduced in adult plants. These results suggest that OsTPC1 functions as a Ca2+ -permeable channel involved in the regulation of growth and development.
psb-7-1428.pdf	Intracellular localization and physiological function of a rice Ca(2)(+)-permeable channel OsTPC1	2012	Plant Signal Behav	Department of Applied Biological Science, Tokyo University of Science, 2641 Yamazaki, Noda, Chiba, Japan.	Two-pore channels (TPCs) are cation channels with a voltage-sensor domain conserved in plants and animals. Rice OsTPC1 is predominantly localized to the plasma membrane (PM), and assumed to play an important role as a Ca(2)(+)-permeable cation channel in the regulation of cytosolic Ca(2)(+) rise and innate immune responses including hypersensitive cell death and phytoalexin biosynthesis in cultured rice cells triggered by a fungal elicitor, xylanase from Trichoderma viride. In contrast, Arabidopsis AtTPC1 is localized to the vacuolar membrane (VM). To gain further insights into the intracellular localization of OsTPC1, we stably expressed OsTPC1-GFP in tobacco BY-2 cells. Confocal imaging and membrane fractionation revealed that, unlike in rice cells, the majority of OsTPC1-GFP fusion protein was targeted to the VM in tobacco BY-2 cells. Intracellular localization and functions of the plant TPC family is discussed.
