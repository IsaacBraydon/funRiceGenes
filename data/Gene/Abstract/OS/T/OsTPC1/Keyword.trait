OsTPC1	cell death	Intracellular localization and physiological function of a rice Ca(2)(+)-permeable channel OsTPC1	 Rice OsTPC1 is predominantly localized to the plasma membrane (PM), and assumed to play an important role as a Ca(2)(+)-permeable cation channel in the regulation of cytosolic Ca(2)(+) rise and innate immune responses including hypersensitive cell death and phytoalexin biosynthesis in cultured rice cells triggered by a fungal elicitor, xylanase from Trichoderma viride
OsTPC1	cell death	Regulation of a Proteinaceous Elicitor-induced Ca2+ Influx and Production of Phytoalexins by a Putative Voltage-gated Cation Channel, OsTPC1, in Cultured Rice Cells	 A putative voltage-gated cation channel, OsTPC1 has been shown to play a critical role in hypersensitive cell death induced by a fungal xylanase protein (TvX) in suspension-cultured rice cells
OsTPC1	growth	Identification of a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ -permeable channel (OsTPC1) involved in Ca2+ influx and regulation of growth and development in rice	 OsTPC1 rescued the Ca2+ uptake activity and growth rate of a yeast mutant cch1
OsTPC1	growth	Identification of a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ -permeable channel (OsTPC1) involved in Ca2+ influx and regulation of growth and development in rice	 OsTPC1-overexpressing cells showed hypersensitivity to excess Ca2+ but higher growth rate under Ca2+ limitation, while growth of the OsTPC1-knockout cultured cells was less sensitive to extracellular free Ca2+ concentration, suggesting that OsTPC1 has Ca2+ transport activity across the plasma membrane
OsTPC1	growth	Identification of a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ -permeable channel (OsTPC1) involved in Ca2+ influx and regulation of growth and development in rice	 OsTPC1-overexpressing plants showed reduced growth and abnormal greening of roots
OsTPC1	growth	Identification of a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ -permeable channel (OsTPC1) involved in Ca2+ influx and regulation of growth and development in rice	 Growth of Ostpc1 seedlings was comparable to the control on agar plates, while significantly reduced in adult plants
OsTPC1	growth	Identification of a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ -permeable channel (OsTPC1) involved in Ca2+ influx and regulation of growth and development in rice	 These results suggest that OsTPC1 functions as a Ca2+ -permeable channel involved in the regulation of growth and development
OsTPC1	growth	Identification of a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ -permeable channel (OsTPC1) involved in Ca2+ influx and regulation of growth and development in rice	Identification of a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ -permeable channel (OsTPC1) involved in Ca2+ influx and regulation of growth and development in rice
OsTPC1	shoot	Identification of a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ -permeable channel (OsTPC1) involved in Ca2+ influx and regulation of growth and development in rice	 We here identified a gene (OsTPC1) encoding a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ channel from rice, ubiquitously expressed in mature leaves, shoots and roots as well as in cultured cells
OsTPC1	seedling	Identification of a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ -permeable channel (OsTPC1) involved in Ca2+ influx and regulation of growth and development in rice	 Growth of Ostpc1 seedlings was comparable to the control on agar plates, while significantly reduced in adult plants
OsTPC1	root	Identification of a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ -permeable channel (OsTPC1) involved in Ca2+ influx and regulation of growth and development in rice	 We here identified a gene (OsTPC1) encoding a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ channel from rice, ubiquitously expressed in mature leaves, shoots and roots as well as in cultured cells
OsTPC1	root	Identification of a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ -permeable channel (OsTPC1) involved in Ca2+ influx and regulation of growth and development in rice	 OsTPC1-overexpressing plants showed reduced growth and abnormal greening of roots
