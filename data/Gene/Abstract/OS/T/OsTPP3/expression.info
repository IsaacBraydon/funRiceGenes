OsTPP3	 Consistent with the OsNCED3 gene, the overexpression of OsTPP3 enhanced salt tolerance while the knockout of OsTPP3 reduced the salt tolerance of the rice seedlings |  Overall, our results demonstrate that salt-increased ABA activated the expression of OsTPP3, which resulted in elevated Tre content and thus an improvement in the salt tolerance of rice seedlings	 Consistent with the OsNCED3 gene, the overexpression of OsTPP3 enhanced salt tolerance while the knockout of OsTPP3 reduced the salt tolerance of the rice seedlings
