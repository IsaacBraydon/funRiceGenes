OsTPP3	seedlings	Abscisic Acid Enhances Trehalose Content via OsTPP3 to Improve Salt Tolerance in Rice Seedlings.	 Consistent with the OsNCED3 gene, the overexpression of OsTPP3 enhanced salt tolerance while the knockout of OsTPP3 reduced the salt tolerance of the rice seedlings
OsTPP3	salt	Abscisic Acid Enhances Trehalose Content via OsTPP3 to Improve Salt Tolerance in Rice Seedlings.	Abscisic Acid Enhances Trehalose Content via OsTPP3 to Improve Salt Tolerance in Rice Seedlings.
OsTPP3	salt	Abscisic Acid Enhances Trehalose Content via OsTPP3 to Improve Salt Tolerance in Rice Seedlings.	 OsTPP3 was found to be induced by both the ABA and salt treatments
