NA	Abscisic Acid Enhances Trehalose Content via OsTPP3 to Improve Salt Tolerance in Rice Seedlings.	2023	Plants (Basel)	Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Rice Stress Biology, College of Agronomy, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha 410128, China.	Salt stress is one of the major environmental stresses that imposes constraints to plant growth and production. Abscisic acid (ABA) has been well-proven to function as a central integrator in plant under salt stress, and trehalose (Tre) has emerged as an excellent osmolyte to induce salt tolerance. However, the interacting mechanism between ABA and Tre in rice seedlings under salt stress is still obscure. Here, we found that the application of exogenous Tre significantly promoted the salt tolerance of rice seedlings by enhancing the activities of antioxidant enzymes. In addition, the expression of OsNCED3 was significantly induced by salt stress. The overexpression of the OsNCED3 gene enhanced the salt tolerance, while the knockout of OsNCED3 reduced the salt tolerance of the rice seedlings. Metabolite analysis revealed that the Tre content was increased in the OsNCED3-overexpressing seedlings and reduced in the nced3 mutant. The application of both ABA and Tre improved the salt tolerance of the nced3 mutant when compared with the WT seedling. OsTPP3 was found to be induced by both the ABA and salt treatments. Consistent with the OsNCED3 gene, the overexpression of OsTPP3 enhanced salt tolerance while the knockout of OsTPP3 reduced the salt tolerance of the rice seedlings. In addition, the Tre content was also higher in the OsTPP3-overexpressing seedling and lower in the tpp3 mutant seedling than the WT plant. The application of exogenous Tre also enhanced the salt tolerance of the tpp3 mutant plant. Overall, our results demonstrate that salt-increased ABA activated the expression of OsTPP3, which resulted in elevated Tre content and thus an improvement in the salt tolerance of rice seedlings.
