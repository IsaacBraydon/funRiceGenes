OsTHT2	 Surprisingly, we found that genes encoding agmatine hydroxycinnamoyl transferases OsAHT1 and OsAHT2; tryptamine hydroxycinnamoyl transferases OsTBT1 and OsTBT2; and tyramine hydroxycinnamoyl transferases OsTHT1 and OsTHT2, responsible for the biosynthesis of polyamine-derived PAs were all up-regulated in APIP5-RNAi transgenic plants compared with segregated wild-type rice
