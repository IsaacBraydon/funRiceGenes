OsTCTP	tolerance	OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.	Overexpression of OsTCTP potentiated the activities of several antioxidant enzymes, reduced the Hg-induced H2O2 levels, and promoted Hg tolerance in rice, whereas knockdown of OsTCTP produced opposite effects
OsTCTP	tolerance	OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.	Our results suggest that OsTCTP is capable of decreasing the Hg-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), therefore, reducing the damage of ROS and enhancing the tolerance of rice plants to Hg stress
OsTCTP	stress	OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.	Our results suggest that OsTCTP is capable of decreasing the Hg-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), therefore, reducing the damage of ROS and enhancing the tolerance of rice plants to Hg stress
OsTCTP	abscisic acid	OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.	OsTCTP was induced by mercuric chloride, cupric sulfate, abscisic acid, and hydrogen peroxide at the protein level in a time-dependent manner
OsTCTP	nucleus	OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.	OsTCTP was found to localize both the cytosol and the nucleus
OsTCTP	reactive oxygen species	OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.	Our results suggest that OsTCTP is capable of decreasing the Hg-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), therefore, reducing the damage of ROS and enhancing the tolerance of rice plants to Hg stress
