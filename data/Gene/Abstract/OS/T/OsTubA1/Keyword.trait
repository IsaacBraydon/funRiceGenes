OsTubA1	root	Tissue-preferential expression of a rice alpha-tubulin gene, OsTubA1, mediated by the first intron	 RNA gel-blot analysis demonstrated that OsTubA1 RNA was accumulated mainly at root tips, supporting that the gene is expressed preferentially in actively dividing tissues: root tips, young leaves, and flowers of the meiotic to mitotic pollen stage during rice growth and development.
