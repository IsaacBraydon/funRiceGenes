10.1007-BF03030578.pdf	Characterization of a drought-responsive gene, OsTPS1, identified by the T-DNA gene-trap system in rice	2005	Journal of Plant Biology	Department of Life Science, Sogang University, 121-742, Seoul, Korea	Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) is a key enzyme for trehalose biosynthesis. To understand the function of the TPS gene, we identified the T-DNA insertion in a TPS gene of rice. Line 1C-071-05 had T-DNA inserted at the second intron of OsTPS1. its deduced OsTPS1 protein shared 52% homology with Arabidopsis TPS. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of OsTPS1 showed that OsTPS1 is inducible by drought, salt, cold, and ABA. Leaves of OsTPS1 knockout (KO) plants were more sensitive to drought or cold stress than were the wild types. Furthermore, transgenic rice of UBI::CBF1 had high expression OsTPS1 mRNA, suggesting that OsTPS1 is regulated by the CBF/DREB transcription factor. Therefore, we propose that OsTPS1 plays an important role during the abiotic stress response.
Haowen2011.pdf	Overexpression of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene OsTPS1 enhances abiotic stress tolerance in rice	2011	Planta	Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering Drug and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, People's Republic of China.	Trehalose plays an important role in metabolic regulation and abiotic stress tolerance in a variety of organisms. In plants, its biosynthesis is catalyzed by two key enzymes: trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP). The genome of rice (Oryza sativa) contains 11 OsTPS genes, and only OsTPS1 shows TPS activity. To demonstrate the physiological function of OsTPS1, we introduced it into rice and found that OsTPS1 overexpression improved the tolerance of rice seedling to cold, high salinity and drought treatments without other significant phenotypic changes. In transgenic lines overexpressing OsTPS1, trehalose and proline concentrations were higher than in the wild type and some stress-related genes were up-regulated, including WSI18, RAB16C, HSP70, and ELIP. These results demonstrate that OsTPS1 may enhance the abiotic stress tolerance of plants by increasing the amount of trehalose and proline, and regulating the expression of stress-related genes. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of some Class II TPSs also enhanced plant tolerance of abiotic stress. This work will help to clarify the role of trehalose metabolism in abiotic stress response in higher plants.
PNAS-2010-Wilson-1006839107.pdf	An NADPH-dependent genetic switch regulates plant infection by the rice blast fungus	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	School of Biosciences, University of Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QD, United Kingdom.	To cause rice blast disease, the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae breaches the tough outer cuticle of the rice leaf by using specialized infection structures called appressoria. These cells allow the fungus to invade the host plant and proliferate rapidly within leaf tissue. Here, we show that a unique NADPH-dependent genetic switch regulates plant infection in response to the changing nutritional and redox conditions encountered by the pathogen. The biosynthetic enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (Tps1) integrates control of glucose-6-phosphate metabolism and nitrogen source utilization by regulating the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, the generation of NADPH, and the activity of nitrate reductase. We report that Tps1 directly binds to NADPH and, thereby, regulates a set of related transcriptional corepressors, comprising three proteins, Nmr1, Nmr2, and Nmr3, which can each bind NADP. Targeted deletion of any of the Nmr-encoding genes partially suppresses the nonpathogenic phenotype of a Deltatps1 mutant. Tps1-dependent Nmr corepressors control the expression of a set of virulence-associated genes that are derepressed during appressorium-mediated plant infection. When considered together, these results suggest that initiation of rice blast disease by M. oryzae requires a regulatory mechanism involving an NADPH sensor protein, Tps1, a set of NADP-dependent transcriptional corepressors, and the nonconsuming interconversion of NADPH and NADP acting as signal transducer.
Zang2011.pdf	Analysis of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) gene family suggests the formation of TPS complexes in rice	2011	Plant Mol Biol	Peking-Yale Joint Center for Plant Molecular Genetics and Agrobiotechnology, National Laboratory of Protein Engineering and Plant Genetic Engineering, College of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, People's Republic of China.	Trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P), an intermediate in the trehalose biosynthesis pathway, is emerging as an important regulator of plant metabolism and development. T6P levels are potentially modulated by a group of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) homologues. In this study, we have isolated 11 TPS genes encoding proteins with both TPS and TPP domains, from rice. Functional complement assays performed in yeast tps1 and tps2 mutants, revealed that only OsTPS1 encodes an active TPS enzyme and no OsTPS protein possesses TPP activity. By using a yeast two-hybrid analysis, a complicated interaction network occurred among OsTPS proteins, and the TPS domain might be essential for this interaction to occur. The interaction between OsTPS1 and OsTPS8 in vivo was confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Furthermore, our gel filtration assay showed that there may exist two forms of OsTPS1 (OsTPS1a and OsTPS1b) with different elution profiles in rice. OsTPS1b was particularly cofractionated with OsTPS5 and OsTPS8 in the 360 kDa complex, while OsTPS1a was predominantly incorporated into the complexes larger than 360 kDa. Collectively, these results suggest that OsTPS family members may form trehalose-6-phosphate synthase complexes and therefore potentially modify T6P levels to regulate plant development.
NA	Disease resistance conferred by components of essential chrysanthemum oil and the epigenetic regulation of OsTPS1.	2022	Sci China Life Sci	College of Tropical Crops, Hainan University, Haikou, 570228, China.	The sesquiterpene alpha-bisabolol is the predominant active ingredient in essential oils that are highly valued in the cosmetics industry due to its wound healing, anti-inflammatory, and skin-soothing properties. Alpha-bisabolol was thought to be restricted to Compositae plants. Here we reveal that alpha-bisabolol is also synthesized in rice, a non-Compositae plant, where it acts as a novel sesquiterpene phytoalexin. Overexpressing the gene responsible for the biosynthesis of alpha-bisabolol, OsTPS1, conferred bacterial blight resistance in rice. Phylogenomic analyses revealed that alpha-bisabolol-synthesizing enzymes in rice and Compositae evolved independently. Further experiments demonstrated that the natural variation in the disease resistance level was associated with differential transcription of OsTPS1 due to polymorphisms in its promoter. We demonstrated that OsTPS1 was regulated at the epigenetic level by JMJ705 through the methyl jasmonate pathway. These data reveal the cross-family accumulation and regulatory mechanisms of alpha-bisabolol production.
