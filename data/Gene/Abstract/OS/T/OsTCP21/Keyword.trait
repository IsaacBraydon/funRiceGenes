OsTCP21	transcription factor	Magnaporthe oryzae defeats rice defense by inducing miR319b and suppressing Jasmonic acid signaling.	 oryzae strain Guy11 specifically induced rice miR319 expression, and consequently suppressed its target gene, OsTCP21 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PCF), which encodes a transcription factor
OsTCP21	defense	Magnaporthe oryzae defeats rice defense by inducing miR319b and suppressing Jasmonic acid signaling.	 By using miR319b-OE and OsTCP21-Res (resistant to miR319-mediated silencing) transgenic rice, we found that OsTCP21 is a positive regulator of rice defense response against the blast disease
OsTCP21	defense response	Magnaporthe oryzae defeats rice defense by inducing miR319b and suppressing Jasmonic acid signaling.	 By using miR319b-OE and OsTCP21-Res (resistant to miR319-mediated silencing) transgenic rice, we found that OsTCP21 is a positive regulator of rice defense response against the blast disease
OsTCP21	disease	Magnaporthe oryzae defeats rice defense by inducing miR319b and suppressing Jasmonic acid signaling.	 By using miR319b-OE and OsTCP21-Res (resistant to miR319-mediated silencing) transgenic rice, we found that OsTCP21 is a positive regulator of rice defense response against the blast disease
