MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are pivotal modulators of plant development and host-virus interactions. However, there exist few examples related to a specific miRNA involved in viral infection or host susceptibility. In this study, we show that the Rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV) infection increases the accumulation of miR319 and inhibits the expression of miR319-regulated TCP (TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PCF) genes, especially TCP21, in host plants. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing miR319 or down-regulating TCP21 exhibited disease-like phenotypes, and showed significantly higher susceptibility to RRSV as comparison with the wild-type plants. In contrast, only mild disease symptoms were observed in RRSV-infected lines overexpressing TCP21. This was particularly pronounced in the transgenic plants overexpressing miR319-resistant TCP21. Both RRSV infection and overexpression of miR319 caused the decrease of endogenous jasmonic acid (JA) levels along with down-regulated expression of JA biosynthesis and signaling-related genes in rice. However, treating rice with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) alleviated disease symptoms caused by RRSV and also reduced virus accumulation. Taken together, our results suggest that the induction of miR319 by RRSV infection in rice suppresses JA-mediated defense to facilitate virus infection and symptom development.
