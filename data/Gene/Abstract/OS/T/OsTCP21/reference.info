NA	Suppression of Jasmonic Acid-mediated Defense by Viral-inducible MicroRNA319 Facilitates Virus Infection in Rice.	2016	Mol Plant	Fujian Province Key Laboratory of Plant Virology, Institute of Plant Virology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, Fujian 350002, China.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are pivotal modulators of plant development and host-virus interactions. However, there exist few examples related to a specific miRNA involved in viral infection or host susceptibility. In this study, we show that the Rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV) infection increases the accumulation of miR319 and inhibits the expression of miR319-regulated TCP (TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PCF) genes, especially TCP21, in host plants. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing miR319 or down-regulating TCP21 exhibited disease-like phenotypes, and showed significantly higher susceptibility to RRSV as comparison with the wild-type plants. In contrast, only mild disease symptoms were observed in RRSV-infected lines overexpressing TCP21. This was particularly pronounced in the transgenic plants overexpressing miR319-resistant TCP21. Both RRSV infection and overexpression of miR319 caused the decrease of endogenous jasmonic acid (JA) levels along with down-regulated expression of JA biosynthesis and signaling-related genes in rice. However, treating rice with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) alleviated disease symptoms caused by RRSV and also reduced virus accumulation. Taken together, our results suggest that the induction of miR319 by RRSV infection in rice suppresses JA-mediated defense to facilitate virus infection and symptom development.
NA	Magnaporthe oryzae defeats rice defense by inducing miR319b and suppressing Jasmonic acid signaling.	2018	Plant Physiol	College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Crop Diseases and Pests (Nanjing Agricultural University), Ministry of CITY: nanjing China [CN].	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in plant responses to pathogen infections. Rice is the major staple food worldwide, and the rice blast disease is the most important disease of rice. To explore the miRNA species participating in rice immunity against the rice blast disease, we compared small RNA expression between mock- and Magnaporthe oryzae-treated rice. We found that infection by M. oryzae strain Guy11 specifically induced rice miR319 expression, and consequently suppressed its target gene, OsTCP21 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PCF), which encodes a transcription factor. By using miR319b-OE and OsTCP21-Res (resistant to miR319-mediated silencing) transgenic rice, we found that OsTCP21 is a positive regulator of rice defense response against the blast disease. When rice was infected by Guy11, or in the miR319b-OE rice, multiple Jasmonic acid (JA) synthetic and signaling components were suppressed, indicating Guy11 suppresses the JA signaling through inducing miR319. In particular, we found that LIPOXYGENASE 2 (LOX2) and LOX5 were specifically suppressed by miR319 or by Guy11 infection. LOXs are the key enzymes of JA synthesis, which catalyzes the conversion of ¦Á-linoleic acid (LnA) to hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid (HPODE). LnA application rescued disease symptoms on the OsTCP21-Res but not wild-type rice, supporting our hypothesis that OsLOX2 and OsLOX5 were the key JA synthetic genes hijacked by Guy11. Taking this advantage, Guy11 can subvert the host immunity and facilitates pathogenicity. We propose that induced expression of OsLOX2/5 (e.g., miR319:: OsLOX2/5 transgenic rice) would be a potential resolution of the rice blast disease.
NA	In planta transcriptome analysis reveals tissue-specific expression of pathogenicity genes and microRNAs during rice-Magnaporthe interactions	2020	Genomics	Genomics Laboratory, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms (C-CAMP), National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bengaluru 560065, India; Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, College of Agriculture, V.

Analysis of in planta rice transcriptome in leaf and neck tissues revealed tissue-specific and infection-specific expression of rice and Magnaporthe oryzae genes in host and pathogen. The glycosyl hydrolase, isocitrate lyase, cupin domain containing protein, TF2, CMPG1, CHIT17 and OsCML14 genes were uniquely expressed in leaf infection. Genes like cytochrome P450, inhibitor I family protein, GSTU6, abscisic stress ripening, and cupin domain containing protein were up-regulated during neck infection. In our microRNA sequencing study, Osa-miR166n-3p was highly expressed in upon Magnaporthe leaf infection, whereas osa-miR1661-3p, osa-miR166n-3p and osa-miR159b were overexpressed in neck infection. Here we report several transcripts being targeted by up and down regulated microRNAs during infection. The putative genes expressed upon infection in leaf and neck could be used in understanding the dual-epidemics of blast disease.
