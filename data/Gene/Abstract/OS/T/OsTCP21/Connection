OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	OsTCP21	MiR319-targeted OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb regulate tillering and grain yield in rice	 Through targets prediction, we identified OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb as downstream targets of miR319
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	OsTCP21	MiR319-targeted OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb regulate tillering and grain yield in rice	 Moreover, OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb overexpression lines and STTM319 had increased tiller bud length and biomass, whereas both were decreased in OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb knockout lines and OE319a
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	OsTCP21	MiR319-targeted OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb regulate tillering and grain yield in rice	 These data suggest that miR319 regulates rice tiller bud development and tillering through targeting OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	OsTCP21	MiR319-targeted OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb regulate tillering and grain yield in rice	 Notably, the tiller number and grain yield increased in STTM319 and overexpression lines of OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb but decreased in OE319a and knockout lines of OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	OsTCP21	MiR319-targeted OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb regulate tillering and grain yield in rice	 Taken together, our findings indicate that miR319s negatively affect tiller number and grain yield by targeting OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb, revealing a novel function for miR319 in rice
