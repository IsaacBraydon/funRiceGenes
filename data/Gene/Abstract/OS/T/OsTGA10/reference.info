NA	Regulatory Role of OsTDL1A-MSP1 Signaling in Specifying Anther Cell Identity in Rice.	2016	Plant Physiol	Shanghai Jiao Tong University CITY: Shanghai China [CN].	In flowering plants, sequential formation of anther cell types is a highly ordered process that is essential for successful meiosis and sexual reproduction. Differentiation of meristematic cells and cell-cell communication are proposed to coordinate anther development. Among the proposed mechanisms of cell fate specification are cell surface-localized leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) and their putative ligands. Here we present the genetic and biochemical evidence that a rice LRR-RLK, MSP1, interacts with its ligand OsTDL1A, specifying the cell identity of anther wall layers and microsporocytes. An in vitro assay indicates that the 21 amino-acid peptide of OsTDL1A has a physical interaction with the LRR domain of MSP1. ostdl1a msp1 double mutant showed the defect in lacking middle layers and tapetal cells, and having an increased number of microsporocytes similar to ostdl1a or msp1 single mutant, indicating the same pathway of OsTDL1A-MSP1 in regulating anther development. Genome-wide expression profiles showed the altered expression of genes encoding transcription factors, particularly basic helix-loop-helix and basic leucine zipper domain transcription factors in ostdl1a and msp1. Among these reduced expressed genes, one putatively encodes a TGA (TGACGTCA cis-element-binding protein) factor OsTGA10, and another one encodes a plant-specific CC-type glutaredoxin OsGrx_I1. OsTGA10 was shown to interact with OsGrx_I1, suggesting that OsTDL1A-MSP1 signaling specifies anther cell fate directly or indirectly affecting redox status. Collectively, these data point to a central role of the OsTDL1A-MSP1 signaling pathway in specifying somatic cell identity and suppressing over-proliferation of archesporial cells in rice.
NA	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.	2017	Plant Physiol	College of Life Sciences, Peking University CITY: Beijing China [CN].	This study aimed at elucidating regulatory components behind floral organ identity determination and tissue development. It remains unclear how organ identity proteins facilitate development of organ primordia into tissues with a determined identity, even though it has long been accepted that floral organ identity is genetically determined by interaction of identity genes according to the ABC model. Using the ChIP-seq technique, we identified OsTGA10, encoding a bZIP transcription factor, as a target of the MADS box protein OsMADS8, which is annotated as an E-class organ identity protein. We characterized the function of OsTGA10 using genetic and molecular analyses. OsTGA10 was preferentially expressed during stamen development, and mutation of OsTGA10 resulted in male sterility. OsTGA10 was required for tapetum development, and functioned by interacting with known tapetum genes. In addition, in ostga10 stamens, the hallmark cell wall thickening of the endothecium was defective. Our findings suggest that OsTGA10 plays a mediator role between organ identity determination and tapetum development in rice stamen development, between tapetum development and microspore development, and between various regulatory components required for tapetum development. Furthermore, the defective endothecium in ostga10 implies that cell wall thickening of endothecium is dependent on tapetum development.
