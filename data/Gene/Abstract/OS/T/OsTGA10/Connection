OsMADS8|OsMADS24	OsTGA10	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.	 Using the ChIP-seq technique, we identified OsTGA10, encoding a bZIP transcription factor, as a target of the MADS box protein OsMADS8, which is annotated as an E-class organ identity protein
