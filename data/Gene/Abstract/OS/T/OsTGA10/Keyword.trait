OsTGA10	anther	Regulatory Role of OsTDL1A-MSP1 Signaling in Specifying Anther Cell Identity in Rice.	OsTGA10 was shown to interact with OsGrx_I1, suggesting that OsTDL1A-MSP1 signaling specifies anther cell fate directly or indirectly affecting redox status
OsTGA10	transcription factor	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.
OsTGA10	sterility	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.	 OsTGA10 was preferentially expressed during stamen development, and mutation of OsTGA10 resulted in male sterility
OsTGA10	development	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.	 Our findings suggest that OsTGA10 plays a mediator role between organ identity determination and tapetum development in rice stamen development, between tapetum development and microspore development, and between various regulatory components required for tapetum development
OsTGA10	development	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.	 Furthermore, the defective endothecium in ostga10 implies that cell wall thickening of endothecium is dependent on tapetum development
OsTGA10	stamen	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.	 OsTGA10 was preferentially expressed during stamen development, and mutation of OsTGA10 resulted in male sterility
OsTGA10	stamen	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.	 Our findings suggest that OsTGA10 plays a mediator role between organ identity determination and tapetum development in rice stamen development, between tapetum development and microspore development, and between various regulatory components required for tapetum development
OsTGA10	cell wall	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.	 In addition, in ostga10 stamens, the hallmark cell wall thickening of the endothecium was defective
OsTGA10	cell wall	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.	 Furthermore, the defective endothecium in ostga10 implies that cell wall thickening of endothecium is dependent on tapetum development
OsTGA10	tapetum	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.
OsTGA10	tapetum	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.	 OsTGA10 was required for tapetum development, and functioned by interacting with known tapetum genes
OsTGA10	tapetum	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.	 Our findings suggest that OsTGA10 plays a mediator role between organ identity determination and tapetum development in rice stamen development, between tapetum development and microspore development, and between various regulatory components required for tapetum development
OsTGA10	tapetum	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.	 Furthermore, the defective endothecium in ostga10 implies that cell wall thickening of endothecium is dependent on tapetum development
OsTGA10	microspore	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.	 Our findings suggest that OsTGA10 plays a mediator role between organ identity determination and tapetum development in rice stamen development, between tapetum development and microspore development, and between various regulatory components required for tapetum development
OsTGA10	male sterility	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.	 OsTGA10 was preferentially expressed during stamen development, and mutation of OsTGA10 resulted in male sterility
OsTGA10	organ identity	Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.	 Our findings suggest that OsTGA10 plays a mediator role between organ identity determination and tapetum development in rice stamen development, between tapetum development and microspore development, and between various regulatory components required for tapetum development
