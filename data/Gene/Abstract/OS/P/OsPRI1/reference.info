NA	POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 (OsPRI1) positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.	2017	Plant Physiol	School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China CITY: Hefei China [CN].	OsHRZ1 is a potential iron-binding sensor. However, it is unclear how OsHRZ1 transmits signals. In this study, we reveal that OsPRI1 interacts with OsHRZ1. A loss-of-function mutation to OsPRI1 increased the sensitivity of plants to Fe-deficient conditions and downregulated the expression of Fe-deficiency-responsive genes. Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assay results suggested that OsPRI1 binds to the OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 promoters. In vitro ubiquitination experiments indicated that OsPRI1 is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1. Cell-free degradation assays revealed that the stability of OsPRI1 decreased in wild type roots, but increased in the hrz1-2 mutant, suggesting OsHRZ1 is responsible for the instability of OsPRI1. The hrz1-2 seedlings were insensitive to Fe-deficient conditions. When the pri1-1 mutation was introduced into hrz1-2 mutants, the pri1hrz1 double mutant was more sensitive to Fe deficiency than the hrz1-2 mutant. Additionally, the expression levels of Fe-deficiency-responsive genes were lower in the hrz1pri1 double mutant than in the hrz1-2 mutant. Collectively, these results imply that OsPRI1, which is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1, mediates rice responses to Fe-deficiency by positively regulating OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 expression as part of the OsHRZ1-OsPRI1-OsIRO2/3 signal transduction cascade.
NA	A key gene bHLH115 in iron homeostasis: comprehensive bioinformatics analyses in Arabidopsis, tomato, rice, and maize.	2019	Biometals	Department of Crop and Animal Production, Cilimli Vocational School, Duzce University, Cilimli, Duzce, Turkey.	bHLH115 transcription factor (TF) is a positive regulator of the Fe-deficiency and plays essential roles in the stress-related regulation network. In this study, orthologous bHLH115 genes in Arabidopsis, tomato, rice, and maize were analyzed using in silico methods. All bHLH115 proteins contained PF00010 (HLH: Helix-loop-helix DNA-binding domain) domain structure and<U+00A0>their sub-cellular localizations were predicted as nucleus. The bHLH115 orthologues in monocots and dicots clearly diverged from each other. The expression analyses revealed that orthologous genes of bHLH115 in queried species were highly expressed in seed parts, leaf, stem, and flower parts. The bHLH115 genes were co-expressed with genes in plant defense system, and with<U+00A0>genes involving in<U+00A0>biotic and abiotic stress responses. In terms of protein structures, OsbHLH115 and ZmbHLH115, and AtbHLH115 and SlbHLH115 had the highest protein structure similarities. In addition, bHLH115 proteins have bZIP, bHLH and MYB transcription factor binding sites strengthens their engagement in various metabolic ways. Molecular docking analyses showed the different binding sites based on plant species, suggesting functional flexibilities of bHLH115 gene.
