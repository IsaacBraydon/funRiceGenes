OsPI1	phosphate	Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status	 A novel gene was isolated by cDNA microarray analysis and designated as OsPI1 (Oryza sativaPhosphate-limitation Inducible Gene 1)| The OsPI1 gene was rapidly induced by phosphate starvation in both shoots and roots| When phosphate was supplied to phosphate-deficient plants, the OsPI1 transcripts rapidly disappeared| The OsPI1 gene shows the same characteristics as the TPSI1/Mt4 family (the phosphate starvation inducible novel gene family)| It is suggested that OsPI1 acts as riboregulator, that is, it binds with other molecules under phosphate starvation and regulates their function
OsPI1	phosphorus	Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status	Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status
OsPI1	shoot	Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status	 The OsPI1 gene was rapidly induced by phosphate starvation in both shoots and roots
OsPI1	root	Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status	 The OsPI1 gene was rapidly induced by phosphate starvation in both shoots and roots|Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status
