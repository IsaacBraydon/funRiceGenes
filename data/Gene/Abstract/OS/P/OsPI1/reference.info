Plants have developed several strategies for coping with phosphorus (P) deficiency. However, the details of the regulation of gene expression of adaptations to low P are still unclear. Using a cDNA microarray, transcriptomic analyses were carried out of the rice genes regulated by P deficiency and P re-supply to P-deficient plants. The OsPI1 gene, which was isolated as the most significant up-regulated gene under -P conditions, was also the most significant down-regulated gene following P re-supply. Many starch metabolism-related genes, as well as several genes for P(i)-liberating enzymes, were up-regulated by -P treatment, suggesting a homeostatic contribution to the P(i) concentration in leaf tissues. mRNAs for glucanases were also induced by P re-supply: these are suspected to play a role in loosening the cell wall compounds. Most of the genes up-regulated by -P treatment were down-regulated by P re-supply, suggesting that their responses were specific to -P conditions. Conversely, the number of genes up-regulated by P re-supply was also larger following P re-supply than in the -P condition. It is proposed that the genes up-regulated by P re-supply play an important role in P acquisition by P-deficient plants.
j.1469-8137.2003.00748.x.pdf	Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status	2003	New Phytologist	Graduate School of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, N9W9, Kita-ku, Sapporo, 060â€<U+393C><U+3E33>8589, Japan;	Plants have developed several methods of adapting to conditions of low phosphorus (P). However, details of the regulation of the gene expression system that responds to P status of plants is unknown. Here, a phosphorus limitation inducible novel gene was isolated and characterized to provide further information of plant adaptation to low P. Rice plants (Oryza sativa) were grown hydroponically with or without P. A novel gene was isolated by cDNA microarray analysis and designated as OsPI1 (Oryza sativaPhosphate-limitation Inducible Gene 1). mRNA accumulation was examined by Northern blot and quantitative real time PCR. The OsPI1 gene was rapidly induced by phosphate starvation in both shoots and roots. When phosphate was supplied to phosphate-deficient plants, the OsPI1 transcripts rapidly disappeared. OsPI1 cDNA consisted of 375 bp and contained several small open reading frames (ORFs). The OsPI1 gene shows the same characteristics as the TPSI1/Mt4 family (the phosphate starvation inducible novel gene family). It is suggested that OsPI1 acts as riboregulator, that is, it binds with other molecules under phosphate starvation and regulates their function.
