OsPht1;3|OsPT3	OsPIE1	A phosphate-starvation induced RING-type E3 ligase maintains phosphate homeostasis partially through OsSPX2 in rice.	 Under Pi-sufficient condition, overexpression of OsPIE1 upregulated the expression of OsPT2, OsPT3, OsPT10 and OsPAP21b, resulting in Pi accumulation and acid phosphatases (APases) induction in roots
OsPHR2	OsPht1;3|OsPT3	OsPHT1;3 Mediates Uptake, Translocation and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes.	 OsPHT1;3 was directly regulated by OsPHR2 and, in response to Pi starvation, showed enhanced expression in young leaf blades and shoot basal regions and even more so in roots and old leaf blades
OsPHT1	OsPht1;3|OsPT3	OsPHT1;3 Mediates Uptake, Translocation and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes.	 However, unlike that reported for other known OsPHT1 members which facilitate Pi uptake at relatively higher Pi levels, mutation of OsPHT1;3 impaired Pi uptake and root-to-shoot Pi translocation only when external Pi concentration was below 5 ¦ÌM
OsPHT1	OsPht1;3|OsPT3	OsPHT1;3 Mediates Uptake, Translocation and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes.	 Furthermore, overexpression and mutation of OsPHT1;3 led to reciprocal alteration in the expression of OsPHT1;2 and several other OsPHT1 genes
OsPht1;2|OsPT2	OsPht1;3|OsPT3	OsPHT1;3 Mediates Uptake, Translocation and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes.	 Furthermore, overexpression and mutation of OsPHT1;3 led to reciprocal alteration in the expression of OsPHT1;2 and several other OsPHT1 genes
OsPht1;2|OsPT2	OsPht1;3|OsPT3	OsPHT1;3 Mediates Uptake, Translocation and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes.	 Yeast-two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and co-immunoprecipitation assays all demonstrated a physical interaction between OsPHT1;3 and OsPHT1;2
