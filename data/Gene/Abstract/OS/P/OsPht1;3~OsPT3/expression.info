OsPht1;3|OsPT3	 OsPHT1;3 was directly regulated by OsPHR2 and, in response to Pi starvation, showed enhanced expression in young leaf blades and shoot basal regions and even more so in roots and old leaf blades |  Overexpression of OsPHT1;3 led to increased Pi concentration both in roots and shoots |  Moreover, in basal nodes, the expression of OsPHT1;3 was restricted to the phloem of regular vascular bundles and enlarged vascular bundles |  Furthermore, overexpression and mutation of OsPHT1;3 led to reciprocal alteration in the expression of OsPHT1;2 and several other OsPHT1 genes	 Overexpression of OsPHT1;3 led to increased Pi concentration both in roots and shoots |  Furthermore, overexpression and mutation of OsPHT1;3 led to reciprocal alteration in the expression of OsPHT1;2 and several other OsPHT1 genes
