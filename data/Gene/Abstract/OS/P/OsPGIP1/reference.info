NA	Functional analysis of OsPGIP1 in rice sheath blight resistance.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Centre of Plant Gene Research, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.	As one of the most devastating diseases of rice, sheath blight causes severe rice yield loss. However, little progress has been made in rice breeding for sheath blight resistance. It has been reported that polygalacturonase inhibiting proteins can inhibit the degradation of the plant cell wall by polygalacturonases from pathogens. Here, we prokaryotically expressed and purified OsPGIP1 protein, which was verified by Western blot analysis. Activity assay confirmed the inhibitory activity of OsPGIP1 against the PGase from Rhizoctonia solani. In addition, the location of OsPGIP1 was determined by subcellular localization. Subsequently, we overexpressed OsPGIP1 in Zhonghua 11 (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica), and applied PCR and Southern blot analysis to identify the positive T0 transgenic plants with single-copy insertions. Germination assay of the seeds from T1 transgenic plants was carried out to select homozygous OsPGIP1 transgenic lines, and the expression levels of OsPGIP1 in these lines were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Field testing of R. solani inoculation showed that the sheath blight resistance of the transgenic rice was significantly improved. Furthermore, the levels of sheath blight resistance were in accordance with the expression levels of OsPGIP1 in the transgenic lines. Our results reveal the functions of OsPGIP1 and its resistance mechanism to rice sheath blight, which will facilitate rice breeding for sheath blight resistance.
NA	Characterization of expressed Pgip genes in rice and wheat reveals similar extent of sequence variation to dicot PGIPs and identifies an active PGIP lacking an entire LRR repeat.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Dipartimento di Agrobiologia e Agrochimica, Universit√† della Tuscia, Via San Camillo de Lellis, s.n.c., 01100 Viterbo, Italy.	Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins involved in plant defence. A number of PGIPs have been characterized from dicot species, whereas only a few data are available from monocots. Database searches and genome-specific cloning strategies allowed the identification of four rice (Oryza sativa L.) and two wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Pgip genes. The rice Pgip genes (Ospgip1, Ospgip2, Ospgip3 and Ospgip4) are distributed over a 30 kbp region of the short arm of chromosome 5, whereas the wheat Pgip genes, Tapgip1 and Tapgip2, are localized on the short arm of chromosome 7B and 7D, respectively. Deduced amino acid sequences show the typical LRR modular organization and a conserved distribution of the eight cysteines at the N- and C-terminal regions. Sequence comparison suggests that monocot and dicot PGIPs form two separate clusters sharing about 40% identity and shows that this value is close to the extent of variability observed within each cluster. Gene-specific RT-PCR and biochemical analyses demonstrate that both Ospgips and Tapgips are expressed in the whole plant or in a tissue-specific manner, and that OsPGIP1, lacking an entire LRR repeat, is an active inhibitor of fungal polygalacturonases. This last finding can contribute to define the molecular features of PG-PGIP interactions and highlights that the genetic events that can generate variability at the Pgip locus are not only limited to substitutions or small insertions/deletions, as so far reported, but can also involve variation in the number of LRRs.
NA	Overexpression of OsPGIP1 Enhances Rice Resistance to Sheath Blight.	2015	Plant Dis	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology/Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics of the Ministry of Education, Yangzhou University; and Horticulture and Plant Protection College, Yangzhou University.	Rice sheath blight (SB), caused by necrotrophic pathogen Rhizoctonia solani, is one of the most destructive rice diseases, and no major resistance genes are available. Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIP) are extracellular leucine-rich repeat proteins and play important roles in plant defense against different pathogenic fungi by counteracting secreted fungal polygalacturonases (PG). However, the role of PGIP in conferring resistance to rice SB remains to be thoroughly investigated. Here, we showed that OsPGIP1 is capable of inhibiting PG derived from R. solani. Our real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction results indicated that resistant rice 'YSBR1' and 'Jasmine 85' express significantly higher levels of OsPGIP1 than susceptible 'Lemont'. Our results also show that OsPGIP1 is most highly expressed at the late tillering stage in the sheath of YSBR1, coinciding with the critical stage of SB development in field. More importantly, the OsPGIP1 level is highly elevated by inoculation with R. solani in resistant cultivars but not in susceptible Lemont. Overexpression of OsPGIP1 significantly increased rice resistance to SB and inhibited tissue degradation caused by R. solani-secreted PG. Furthermore, OsPGIP1 overexpression did not affect rice agronomic traits or yield components. Together, our results not only demonstrate the important role of OsPGIP1 in combatting the rice SB disease but also provide a new avenue to the improvement of rice SB resistance by manipulating an endogenous gene.
NA	OsPGIP1-Mediated Resistance to Bacterial Leaf Streak in Rice is Beyond Responsive to the Polygalacturonase of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola.	2019	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory of Crop Biology, College of Plant Protection, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, 271018, Shandong, China.	Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) have been shown to recognize fungal polygalacturonases (PGs), which initiate innate immunity in various plant species. Notably, the connection between rice OsPGIPs and PGs in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc), which causes bacterial leaf streak (BLS), remains unclear. Here, we show that OsPGIP1 was strongly induced after inoculating rice with the Xoc strain RS105. Furthermore, OsPGIP1-overexpressing (OV) and RNA interference (RNAi) rice lines increased and decreased, respectively, the resistance of rice to RS105, indicating that OsPGIP1 contributes to BLS resistance. Subsequently, we generated the unique PG mutant RS105¶§pg, the virulence of which is attenuated compared to that of RS105. Surprisingly, the lesion lengths caused by RS105¶§pg were similar to those caused by RS105 in the OV lines compared with wild-type ZH11 with reduced Xoc susceptibility. However, the lesion lengths caused by RS105¶§pg were still significantly shorter in the OV lines than in ZH11, implying that OsPGIP1-mediated BLS resistance could respond to other virulence factors in addition to PGs. To explore the OsPGIP1-mediated resistance, RNA-seq analysis were performed and showed that many plant cell wall-associated genes and several MYB transcription factor genes were specifically expressed or more highly induced in the OV lines compared to ZH11 postinoculation with RS105. Consistent with the expression of the differentially expressed genes, the OV plants accumulated a higher content of jasmonic acid (JA) than ZH11 postinoculation with RS105, suggesting that the OsPGIP1-mediated resistance to BLS is mainly dependent on the plant cell wall-associated immunity and the JA signaling pathway.
