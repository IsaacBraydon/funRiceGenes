OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR4	Phosphate starvation induced OsPHR4 mediates Pi-signaling and homeostasis in rice.	The expression of OsPHR4 is positively regulated by OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3
OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR4	Phosphate starvation induced OsPHR4 mediates Pi-signaling and homeostasis in rice.	The nuclear located OsPHR4 can respectively interact with other three PHR1 subfamily members to regulate downstream Pi-starvation induced genes
OsPHR2	OsPHR4	Phosphate starvation induced OsPHR4 mediates Pi-signaling and homeostasis in rice.	The expression of OsPHR4 is positively regulated by OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3
