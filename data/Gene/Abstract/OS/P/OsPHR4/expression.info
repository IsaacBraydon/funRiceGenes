OsPHR4	 The expression of OsPHR4 is positively regulated by OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3 |  Consistent with the positive role of PHR4 in regulating Pi-starvation signaling, the OsPHR4 overexpressors display higher Pi accumulation in the shoot and elevated expression of Pi-starvation induced genes under Pi-sufficient condition	 Besides, moderate growth retardation and repression of the Pi-starvation signaling in the OsPHR4 RNA interfering (RNAi) transgenic lines can be observed under Pi-deficient condition
