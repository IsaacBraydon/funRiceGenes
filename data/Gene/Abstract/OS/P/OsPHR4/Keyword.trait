OsPHR4	growth	Phosphate starvation induced OsPHR4 mediates Pi-signaling and homeostasis in rice.	In this study, we found that OsPHR4 is a Pi-starvation induced gene and mainly expresses in vascular tissues through all growth and development periods
OsPHR4	growth	Phosphate starvation induced OsPHR4 mediates Pi-signaling and homeostasis in rice.	Besides, moderate growth retardation and repression of the Pi-starvation signaling in the OsPHR4 RNA interfering (RNAi) transgenic lines can be observed under Pi-deficient condition
OsPHR4	shoot	Phosphate starvation induced OsPHR4 mediates Pi-signaling and homeostasis in rice.	Consistent with the positive role of PHR4 in regulating Pi-starvation signaling, the OsPHR4 overexpressors display higher Pi accumulation in the shoot and elevated expression of Pi-starvation induced genes under Pi-sufficient condition
OsPHR4	development	Phosphate starvation induced OsPHR4 mediates Pi-signaling and homeostasis in rice.	In this study, we found that OsPHR4 is a Pi-starvation induced gene and mainly expresses in vascular tissues through all growth and development periods
OsPHR4	homeostasis	Phosphate starvation induced OsPHR4 mediates Pi-signaling and homeostasis in rice.	Phosphate starvation induced OsPHR4 mediates Pi-signaling and homeostasis in rice.
OsPHR4	Pi	Phosphate starvation induced OsPHR4 mediates Pi-signaling and homeostasis in rice.	Consistent with the positive role of PHR4 in regulating Pi-starvation signaling, the OsPHR4 overexpressors display higher Pi accumulation in the shoot and elevated expression of Pi-starvation induced genes under Pi-sufficient condition
OsPHR4	phosphate	Phosphate starvation induced OsPHR4 mediates Pi-signaling and homeostasis in rice.	Phosphate starvation induced OsPHR4 mediates Pi-signaling and homeostasis in rice.
