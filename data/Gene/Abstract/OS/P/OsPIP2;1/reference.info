NA	Ubiquitin ligase OsRINGzf1 regulates drought resistance by controlling the turnover of OsPIP2;1.	2022	Plant Biotechnol J	College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	Water is crucial for plant growth and survival. The transcellular water movement is facilitated by aquaporins (AQPs) that rapidly and reversibly modify water permeability. The abundance of AQPs is regulated by its synthesis, redistribution and degradation. However, the molecular mechanism of proteasomal degradation of AQPs remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a novel E3 ligase, OsRINGzf1, mediated the degradation of AQPs in rice. OsRINGzf1 is the candidate gene from a drought-related quantitative trait locus (QTL) on the long arm of chromosome 4 in rice (Oryza sativa) and encodes a Really Interesting New Gene (RING) zinc finger protein 1. OsRINGzf1 possesses the E3 ligase activity, ubiquitinates and mediates OsPIP2;1 degradation, thus reducing its protein abundance. The content of OsPIP2;1 protein was decreased in OsRINGzf1 overexpression (OE) plants. The degradation of OsPIP2;1 was inhibited by MG132. The OsRINGzf1 OE plants, with higher leaf-related water content (LRWC) and lower leaf water loss rate (LWLR), exhibited enhanced drought resistance, whereas the RNAi and knockout plants of OsRINGzf1 were more sensitive to drought. Together, our data demonstrate that OsRINGzf1 positively regulates drought resistance through promoting the degradation of OsPIP2;1 to enhance water retention capacity in rice.
