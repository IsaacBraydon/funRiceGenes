OsPAO5	seedlings	Targeted Mutagenesis of POLYAMINE OXIDASE 5 that Negatively Regulates Mesocotyl Elongation Enables the Generation of Direct-seeding Rice with Improved Grain Yield	 Here, we established that OsPAO5 expression in rice seedlings is increased in the presence of light, and inhibited by darkness
OsPAO5	grain	Targeted Mutagenesis of POLYAMINE OXIDASE 5 that Negatively Regulates Mesocotyl Elongation Enables the Generation of Direct-seeding Rice with Improved Grain Yield	 Intriguingly, knocking out of OsPAO5 can remarkably increase the grain weight, grain numbers and yield potential
OsPAO5	domestication	Targeted Mutagenesis of POLYAMINE OXIDASE 5 that Negatively Regulates Mesocotyl Elongation Enables the Generation of Direct-seeding Rice with Improved Grain Yield	 Nucleotide polymorphism analysis revealed that an SNP variation (PAO5-578G/A) in the 578 bp upstream of OsPAO5 start codon alters its expression, which is further selected during rice mesocotyl domestication
OsPAO5	grain number	Targeted Mutagenesis of POLYAMINE OXIDASE 5 that Negatively Regulates Mesocotyl Elongation Enables the Generation of Direct-seeding Rice with Improved Grain Yield	 Intriguingly, knocking out of OsPAO5 can remarkably increase the grain weight, grain numbers and yield potential
OsPAO5	yield	Targeted Mutagenesis of POLYAMINE OXIDASE 5 that Negatively Regulates Mesocotyl Elongation Enables the Generation of Direct-seeding Rice with Improved Grain Yield	 Intriguingly, knocking out of OsPAO5 can remarkably increase the grain weight, grain numbers and yield potential
OsPAO5	grain weight	Targeted Mutagenesis of POLYAMINE OXIDASE 5 that Negatively Regulates Mesocotyl Elongation Enables the Generation of Direct-seeding Rice with Improved Grain Yield	 Intriguingly, knocking out of OsPAO5 can remarkably increase the grain weight, grain numbers and yield potential
