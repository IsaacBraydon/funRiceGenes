Under conditions of labor or resource scarcity, direct seeding, rather than transplantation, is a preferred mode of rice (Oryza sativa. L) cultivation. This approach requires varieties that exhibit uniform seedling emergence. Mesocotyl elongation (ME), the main driver of rice seedling rapid emergence from soil, is enhanced by darkness and inhibited by light. Plant polyamine oxidases (PAOs) oxidate polyamines (PAs) and release H2O2. Here, we established that OsPAO5 expression in rice seedlings is increased in the presence of light, and inhibited by darkness. To determine its role in ME, we created OsPAO5 mutants using CRISPR/Cas9. Compared with the wild type, pao5 mutants had longer mesocotyls, released less H2O2, and synthesized more ethylene. The mutant seedlings emerged at a higher and more uniform rate, indicating potential use in direct seeding. Nucleotide polymorphism analysis revealed that an SNP variation (PAO5-578G/A) in the 578 bp upstream of OsPAO5 start codon alters its expression, which is further selected during rice mesocotyl domestication. The PAO5-578G genotype consisting with long mesocotyl mainly exists in wild rice, most Aus and some Geng (Japonica) accessions. Intriguingly, knocking out of OsPAO5 can remarkably increase the grain weight, grain numbers and yield potential. In summary, we developed a novel strategy to obtain elite rice with higher emergence vigor and yield potential, which can be conveniently and widely used to breed varieties of direct-seeding rice.
