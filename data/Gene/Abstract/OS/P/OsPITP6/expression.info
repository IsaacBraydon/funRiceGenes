OsPITP6	 By contrast, overexpression of AtPITP7 and OsPITP6 enhanced Pi uptake and plant growth, especially under limited Pi supply |  Importantly, overexpression of OsPITP6 increased tiller number and grain yield in rice |  Targeted metabolome analysis of glycerolipids in leaves and chloroplasts revealed that inactivation of OsPITP6 alters phospholipid contents, independent of Pi availability, diminishing the reduction in phospholipid content and increase in glycolipid content induced by Pi deficiency; meanwhile, overexpression of OsPITP6 enhanced Pi deficiency induced metabolic alterations	 By contrast, overexpression of AtPITP7 and OsPITP6 enhanced Pi uptake and plant growth, especially under limited Pi supply |  Importantly, overexpression of OsPITP6 increased tiller number and grain yield in rice |  Targeted metabolome analysis of glycerolipids in leaves and chloroplasts revealed that inactivation of OsPITP6 alters phospholipid contents, independent of Pi availability, diminishing the reduction in phospholipid content and increase in glycolipid content induced by Pi deficiency; meanwhile, overexpression of OsPITP6 enhanced Pi deficiency induced metabolic alterations
