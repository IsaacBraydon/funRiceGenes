OsPITP6	growth	Chloroplastic Sec14-like proteins modulate growth and phosphate deficiency responses in Arabidopsis and rice.	 Together with transcriptome analysis of ospitp6 rice plants and phenotypic analysis of grafted Arabidopsis chimeras, these results suggest that chloroplastic Sec14-like proteins play an essential role in growth modulations in response to changes in Pi availability, although their function is critical for plant growth under any Pi condition
OsPITP6	growth	Chloroplastic Sec14-like proteins modulate growth and phosphate deficiency responses in Arabidopsis and rice.
