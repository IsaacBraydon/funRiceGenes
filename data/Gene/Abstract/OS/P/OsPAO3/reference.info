Soil salinity inhibits seed germination and reduces seedling survival rate, resulting in significant yield reductions in crops. Here, we report the identification of a polyamine oxidase, OsPAO3, conferring salt tolerance at the germination stage in rice (Oryza sativa L.), through map-based cloning approach. OsPAO3 is up-regulated under salt stress at the germination stage and highly expressed in various organs. Overexpression of OsPAO3 increases activity of polyamine oxidases, enhancing the polyamine content in seed coleoptiles. Increased polyamine may lead to the enhance of the activity of ROS-scavenging enzymes to eliminate over-accumulated H(2)O(2) and to reduce Na(+) content in seed coleoptiles to maintain ion homeostasis and weaken Na(+) damage. These changes resulted in stronger salt tolerance at the germination stage in rice. Our findings not only provide a unique gene for breeding new salt-tolerant rice cultivars but also help to elucidate the mechanism of salt tolerance in rice.
