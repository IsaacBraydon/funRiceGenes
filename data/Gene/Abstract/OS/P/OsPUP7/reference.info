jipb12101.pdf	Characterization of a purine permease family gene OsPUP7 involved in growth and development control in rice	2013	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	In this study, PUP-type cytokinin transporter genes were identified in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The Oryza sativa purine permease (OsPUP) family has 12 members that show similar predicted protein sequences with AtPUPs. To reveal the functions of OsPUP genes, we searched the T-DNA mutant library of rice and found one mutant for the member OsPUP7. The T-DNA insertion caused a new transcript that encodes a protein with 26 amino acids different from the native OsPUP7 at the C-terminus. The mutant showed multiple phenotypic changes including increased plant height, big seeds, and delayed flowering. The mutant also showed increased sensitivity to drought and salt stresses and treatments with kinetin and abscisic acid. OsPUP7 is expressed mainly in the vascular bundle, pistil, and stamens. The measurement of cytokinins (CKs) showed that CK content in the mutant spikelets accumulated higher than that in the wild type. Moreover, uptake experiment in the yeast fcy2 mutant suggested that OsPUP7 has the ability to transport caffeine, a CK derivative. Our results indicate that the PUP transport system also exists in rice, and OsPUP7 has an important role in the transport of CK, thus affecting developmental process and stress responses.
NA	Endoplasmic Reticulum-Localized PURINE PERMEASE1 Regulates Plant Height and Grain Weight by Modulating Cytokinin Distribution in Rice	2020	Front Plant Sci	Southern Regional Collaborative Innovation Center for Grain and Oil Crops in China, College of Agriculture, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, China.	Cytokinins (CKs) are a class of phytohormones playing essential roles in various biological processes. However, the mechanisms underlying CK transport as well as its function in plant growth and development are far from being fully elucidated. Here, we characterize the function of PURINE PERMEASE1 (OsPUP1) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). OsPUP1 was predominantly expressed in the root, particularly in vascular cells, and CK treatment can induce its expression. Subcellular localization analysis showed that OsPUP1 was predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Overexpression of OsPUP1 resulted in growth defect of various aerial tissues, including decreased leaf length, plant height, grain weight, panicle length, and grain number. Hormone profiling revealed that the CK content was decreased in the shoot of OsPUP1-overexpressing seedling, but increased in the root, compared with the wild type. The CK content in the panicle was also decreased. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis using several CK type-A response regulators (OsRRs) as the marker genes suggested that the CK response in the shoot of OsPUP1-overexpressing seedling is decreased compared to the wild type when CKs are applied to the root. Genetic analysis revealed that BG3/OsPUP4, a putative plasma membrane-localized CK transporter, overcomes the function of OsPUP1. We hypothesize that OsPUP1 might be involved in importing CKs into ER to unload CKs from the vascular tissues by cell-to-cell transport.
