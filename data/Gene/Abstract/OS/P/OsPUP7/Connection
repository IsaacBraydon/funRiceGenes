OsPIL15	OsPUP7	The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, OsPIL15 regulates grain size via directly targeting a purine permease gene OsPUP7 in rice.	 Further<U+00A0>studies<U+00A0>indicated that OsPIL15 binds to N1-box (CACGCG) motifs of the purine permease gene OsPUP7 promoter
OsPIL15	OsPUP7	The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, OsPIL15 regulates grain size via directly targeting a purine permease gene OsPUP7 in rice.	 Overall, our results demonstrate a possible pathway whereby OsPIL15 directly targets OsPUP7, affecting CTK transport and thereby influencing cell division and subsequent grain size
