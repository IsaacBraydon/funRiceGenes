OspTAC2	chloroplast	OspTAC2 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and regulates rice chloroplast development.	OspTAC2 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and regulates rice chloroplast development.
OspTAC2	chloroplast	OspTAC2 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and regulates rice chloroplast development.	 Sequence and transcription analyses showed that OspTAC2 encodes a putative chloroplast protein consisting of 10 pentratricopeptide repeat (PPR) domains and a C-terminal small MutS-related (SMR) domain
OspTAC2	chloroplast	OspTAC2 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and regulates rice chloroplast development.	 Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the chloroplast of the osptac2 mutant lacks an organized thylakoid membrane
OspTAC2	chloroplast	OspTAC2 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and regulates rice chloroplast development.	 These results suggest that OspTAC2 plays a critical role in chloroplast development and indicate that the molecular function of the OspTAC2 gene is conserved in rice and Arabidopsis
OspTAC2	development	OspTAC2 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and regulates rice chloroplast development.	 These results suggest that OspTAC2 plays a critical role in chloroplast development and indicate that the molecular function of the OspTAC2 gene is conserved in rice and Arabidopsis
OspTAC2	chloroplast development	OspTAC2 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and regulates rice chloroplast development.	OspTAC2 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and regulates rice chloroplast development.
OspTAC2	chloroplast development	OspTAC2 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and regulates rice chloroplast development.	 These results suggest that OspTAC2 plays a critical role in chloroplast development and indicate that the molecular function of the OspTAC2 gene is conserved in rice and Arabidopsis
