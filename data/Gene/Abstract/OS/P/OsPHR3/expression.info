OsPHR3	 Deficiencies of different variants of N exerted attenuating effects on the relative expression levels of OsPHR3 in a tissue-specific manner |  During vegetative growth phase, compared with the wild-type, OsPHR3 mutants showed significant variations in the adventitious root development, influx rates of 15N-NO3- and 15N-NH4+, concentrations of total N, NO3- and NH4+ in different tissues, and the relative expression levels of OsNRT1
