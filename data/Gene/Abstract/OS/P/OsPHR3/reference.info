NA	Integrative comparison of the role of the PHR1 subfamily in phosphate signaling and homeostasis in rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	Zhejiang University College of Life Sciences CITY: Hangzhou STATE: Zhejiang China [CN].	Phosphorus (P), an essential macronutrient for all living cells, is indispensable for agricultural production. While Arabidopsis thaliana PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 (PHR1) and its orthologs in other species have been shown to function in transcriptional regulation of phosphate (Pi) signaling and Pi homeostasis, an integrative comparison of PHR1-related proteins in rice has not previously been reported. Here, we identified functional redundancy among three PHR1 orthologs in rice, OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3, using phylogenetic and mutation analysis. OsPHR3, in conjunction with OsPHR1 and OsPHR2, function in transcriptional activation of most Pi starvation-induced (PSI) genes. Loss-of-function mutations in any one of these transcription factors (TFs) impaired root hair growth (primarily root hair elongation). However, these three TFs showed differences in DNA binding affinities and mRNA expression patterns in different tissues and growth stages, and transcriptomic analysis revealed differential effects on PSI gene expression of single mutants of the three TFs, indicating some degree of functional diversification. Overexpression of genes encoding any of these TFs resulted in partial constitutive activation of Pi starvation response and led to Pi accumulation in the shoot. Furthermore, unlike OsPHR2-overexpressing lines, which exhibited growth retardation under normal or Pi-deficient conditions, OsPHR3-overexpressing plants exhibited significant tolerance to low Pi stress but normal growth rates under normal Pi conditions, suggesting that OsPHR3 would be useful for molecular breeding to improve Pi uptake/use efficiency under phosphate-deficient conditions. We propose that OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3 form a network and play diverse roles in regulating Pi signaling and homeostasis in rice.
NA	OsPHR3 affects the traits governing nitrogen homeostasis in rice.	2018	BMC Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Phosphate (Pi) and Nitrogen (N) are essential macronutrients required for plant growth and development. In Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), the transcription factor PHR1 acts as a Pi central regulator. PHL1 is a homolog of PHR1 and also plays a role in maintaining Pi homeostasis. In rice (Oryza sativa), OsPHR1-4 are the orthologs of PHR1 and have been implicated in regulating sensing and signaling cascades governing Pi homeostasis.Here the role of OsPHR3 was examined in regulating the homeostasis of N under different Pi regimes. Deficiencies of different variants of N exerted attenuating effects on the relative expression levels of OsPHR3 in a tissue-specific manner. For the functional characterization of OsPHR3, its Tos17 insertion homozygous mutants i.e., osphr3-1, osphr3-2, and osphr3-3 were compared with the wild-type for various morphophysiological and molecular traits during vegetative (hydroponics with different regimes of N variants) and reproductive (pot soil) growth phases. During vegetative growth phase, compared with the wild-type, OsPHR3 mutants showed significant variations in the adventitious root development, influx rates of 15N-NO3- and 15N-NH4+, concentrations of total N, NO3- and NH4+ in different tissues, and the relative expression levels of OsNRT1.1a, OsNRT2.4, OsAMT1;1, OsNia1 and OsNia2. The effects of the mutation in OsPHR3 was also explicit on the seed-set and grain yield during growth in a pot soil. Although Pi deficiency affected total N and NO3- concentration, the lateral root development and the relative expression levels of some of the NO3- and NH4+ transporter genes, its availability did not exert any notable regulatory influences on the traits governing N homeostasis.OsPHR3 plays a pivotal role in regulating the homeostasis of N independent of Pi availability.
