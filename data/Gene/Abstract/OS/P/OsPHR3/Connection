OsPHR3	OsPHR4	Phosphate starvation induced OsPHR4 mediates Pi-signaling and homeostasis in rice.	The expression of OsPHR4 is positively regulated by OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3
NRT1|OsNRT1|OsNRT1.1	OsPHR3	OsPHR3 affects the traits governing nitrogen homeostasis in rice.	 During vegetative growth phase, compared with the wild-type, OsPHR3 mutants showed significant variations in the adventitious root development, influx rates of 15N-NO3- and 15N-NH4+, concentrations of total N, NO3- and NH4+ in different tissues, and the relative expression levels of OsNRT1
