OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR3	Integrative comparison of the role of the PHR1 subfamily in phosphate signaling and homeostasis in rice.	Here, we identified functional redundancy among three PHR1 orthologs in rice, OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3, using phylogenetic and mutation analysis
OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR3	Integrative comparison of the role of the PHR1 subfamily in phosphate signaling and homeostasis in rice.	OsPHR3, in conjunction with OsPHR1 and OsPHR2, function in transcriptional activation of most Pi starvation-induced (PSI) genes
OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR3	Integrative comparison of the role of the PHR1 subfamily in phosphate signaling and homeostasis in rice.	We propose that OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3 form a network and play diverse roles in regulating Pi signaling and homeostasis in rice
