OsNek3	OsPLIM2b	Cytoplasmic male sterility-related protein kinase, OsNek3, is regulated downstream of mitochondrial protein phosphatase 2C, DCW11	OsNek3 was shown to interact with a LIM domain-containing protein, OsPLIM2b, whose expression was strongly specific in mature pollen, suggesting that OsNek3 might play a role in pollen germination
OsPLIM2a	OsPLIM2b	Rice LIM protein OsPLIM2a is involved in rice seed and tiller development	OsPLIM2 genes (OsPLIM2a, OsPLIM2b, and OsPLIM2c) expressed in reproductive organs including anthers, but not in other tissues
