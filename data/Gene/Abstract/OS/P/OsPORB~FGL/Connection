OsPORA	OsPORB|FGL	The rice faded green leaf locus encodes protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase B and is essential for chlorophyll synthesis under high light conditions	 OsPORA expression is repressed by light and OsPORB expression is regulated in a circadian rhythm in short-day conditions
OsPORA	OsPORB|FGL	The rice faded green leaf locus encodes protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase B and is essential for chlorophyll synthesis under high light conditions	 OsPORA was expressed at high levels in developing leaves and decreased dramatically in fully mature leaves, whereas OsPORB expression was relatively constant throughout leaf development, similar to expression patterns of AtPORA and AtPORB in Arabidopsis
OsPORA	OsPORB|FGL	The rice faded green leaf locus encodes protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase B and is essential for chlorophyll synthesis under high light conditions	 Our results demonstrate that OsPORB is essential for maintaining light-dependent Chl synthesis throughout leaf development, especially under HL conditions, whereas OsPORA mainly functions in the early stages of leaf development
OsPORB|FGL	YLC1|OsV5A	Differential Regulation of Protochlorophyllide Oxidoreductase Abundances by VIRESCENT 5A (OsV5A) and VIRESCENT 5B (OsV5B) in Rice Seedlings.	 OsV5A and OsV5B interact with two rice PORs (OsPORA and OsPORB) inside chloroplasts and they stabilize OsPORB in vitro under oxidative stress
