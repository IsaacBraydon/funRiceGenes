OsPORA	OsPORB|FGL	The rice faded green leaf locus encodes protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase B and is essential for chlorophyll synthesis under high light conditions	OsPORA expression is repressed by light and OsPORB expression is regulated in a circadian rhythm in short-day conditions
OsPORA	OsPORB|FGL	The rice faded green leaf locus encodes protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase B and is essential for chlorophyll synthesis under high light conditions	OsPORA was expressed at high levels in developing leaves and decreased dramatically in fully mature leaves, whereas OsPORB expression was relatively constant throughout leaf development, similar to expression patterns of AtPORA and AtPORB in Arabidopsis
OsPORA	OsPORB|FGL	The rice faded green leaf locus encodes protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase B and is essential for chlorophyll synthesis under high light conditions	Our results demonstrate that OsPORB is essential for maintaining light-dependent Chl synthesis throughout leaf development, especially under HL conditions, whereas OsPORA mainly functions in the early stages of leaf development
OsPORB|FGL	YLC1|OsV5A	Differential Regulation of Protochlorophyllide Oxidoreductase Abundances by VIRESCENT 5A (OsV5A) and VIRESCENT 5B (OsV5B) in Rice Seedlings.	OsV5A and OsV5B interact with two rice PORs (OsPORA and OsPORB) inside chloroplasts and they stabilize OsPORB in vitro under oxidative stress
OsPORB|FGL	OsV5B	Differential Regulation of Protochlorophyllide Oxidoreductase Abundances by VIRESCENT 5A (OsV5A) and VIRESCENT 5B (OsV5B) in Rice Seedlings.	OsV5A and OsV5B interact with two rice PORs (OsPORA and OsPORB) inside chloroplasts and they stabilize OsPORB in vitro under oxidative stress
OsPORA	OsPORB|FGL	Two NADPH: Protochlorophyllide Oxidoreductase (POR) Isoforms Play Distinct Roles in Environmental Adaptation in Rice.	Rice has two POR isoforms, OsPORA and OsPORB
OsPORA	OsPORB|FGL	Two NADPH: Protochlorophyllide Oxidoreductase (POR) Isoforms Play Distinct Roles in Environmental Adaptation in Rice.	OsPORA is expressed in the dark during early leaf development; OsPORB is expressed throughout leaf development regardless of light conditions
OsPORA	OsPORB|FGL	Two NADPH: Protochlorophyllide Oxidoreductase (POR) Isoforms Play Distinct Roles in Environmental Adaptation in Rice.	To investigate whether the function of OsPORA can complement that of OsPORB, we constitutively overexpressed OsPORA in fgl mutant
OsPORA	OsPORB|FGL	Two NADPH: Protochlorophyllide Oxidoreductase (POR) Isoforms Play Distinct Roles in Environmental Adaptation in Rice.	The physiological function of OsPORB in response to constant light or during reproductive growth cannot be completely replaced by constitutive activity of OsPORA, although the biochemical functions of OsPORA and OsPORB are redundant
OsGGPPS1	OsPORB|FGL	A recruiting protein of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase controls metabolic flux toward chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice.	 OsGRP determines OsGGPPS1 suborganellar localization and directs it to a large protein complex in thylakoid membranes, consisting of geranylgeranyl reductase (OsGGR), light-harvesting-like protein 3 (OsLIL3), protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (OsPORB), and chlorophyll synthase (OsCHLG)
