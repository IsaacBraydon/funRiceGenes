OsPIN1c	 Cadmium rapidly downregulated the expression of the auxin efflux transporter genes OsPIN1b, OsPIN1c and OsPIN9 in the stele and LPR
OsPIN1c	 In this study, we investigated the expression and function of OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d in the japonica rice variety (Nipponbare) using gene knockout and high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis
