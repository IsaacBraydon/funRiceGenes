OsPDR18	growth	An ABCG-type transporter intensifies ametryn catabolism by Phase III reaction mechanism in rice.	 Transgenic rice overexpressing OsPDR18 (OE) conferred rice resistance and detoxification to AME by increasing chlorophyll contents, improving growth phenotypes, and reducing AME accumulation in plants
OsPDR18	growth	An ABCG-type transporter intensifies ametryn catabolism by Phase III reaction mechanism in rice.	 Mutation of OsPDR18 by CRISPR/Cas9 protocol led to the compromised growth and enhanced AME accumulation in rice
OsPDR18	resistance	An ABCG-type transporter intensifies ametryn catabolism by Phase III reaction mechanism in rice.	 Transgenic rice overexpressing OsPDR18 (OE) conferred rice resistance and detoxification to AME by increasing chlorophyll contents, improving growth phenotypes, and reducing AME accumulation in plants
OsPDR18	plasma membrane	An ABCG-type transporter intensifies ametryn catabolism by Phase III reaction mechanism in rice.	 OsPDR18 was localized to the plasma membrane and strongly induced under AME exposure
OsPDR18	chlorophyll	An ABCG-type transporter intensifies ametryn catabolism by Phase III reaction mechanism in rice.	 Transgenic rice overexpressing OsPDR18 (OE) conferred rice resistance and detoxification to AME by increasing chlorophyll contents, improving growth phenotypes, and reducing AME accumulation in plants
OsPDR18	detoxification	An ABCG-type transporter intensifies ametryn catabolism by Phase III reaction mechanism in rice.	 Transgenic rice overexpressing OsPDR18 (OE) conferred rice resistance and detoxification to AME by increasing chlorophyll contents, improving growth phenotypes, and reducing AME accumulation in plants
OsPDR18	detoxification	An ABCG-type transporter intensifies ametryn catabolism by Phase III reaction mechanism in rice.	 These data unveil a AME catabolic mechanism by which OsPDR18 contributes to the AME detoxification and degradation in rice crops
OsPDR18	chlorophyll content	An ABCG-type transporter intensifies ametryn catabolism by Phase III reaction mechanism in rice.	 Transgenic rice overexpressing OsPDR18 (OE) conferred rice resistance and detoxification to AME by increasing chlorophyll contents, improving growth phenotypes, and reducing AME accumulation in plants
