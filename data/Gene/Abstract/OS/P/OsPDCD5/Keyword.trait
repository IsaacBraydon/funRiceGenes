OsPDCD5	pollen	Down-regulation of the OsPDCD5 gene induced photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice	Here we report that decreased expression of OsPDCD5 caused by antisense technology could induce pollen sterility in photoperiod-sensitive rice
OsPDCD5	flower	Overexpression of the OsPDCD5 gene induces programmed cell death in rice	Constitutive expression of OsPDCD5 from the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter induced programmed cell death (PCD) in transgenic rice
OsPDCD5	sterility	Down-regulation of the OsPDCD5 gene induced photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice	Here we report that decreased expression of OsPDCD5 caused by antisense technology could induce pollen sterility in photoperiod-sensitive rice
OsPDCD5	sterility	Down-regulation of the OsPDCD5 gene induced photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice	Down-regulation of the OsPDCD5 gene induced photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice
OsPDCD5	fertility	Down-regulation of the OsPDCD5 gene induced photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice	In F1 hybrids made from transgenic plants with antisense-OsPDCD5 and japonica rice varieties, lower transcript inhibition could restore fertility, under certain photoperiod and temperatures
