NA	Overexpression of OsPGIP2 confers Sclerotinia sclerotiorum resistance in Brassica napus through increased activation of defense mechanisms.	2018	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural university, Wuhan, Hubei, China.	Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR), caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, is the most serious disease affecting the yield of the agriculturally and economically important crop, Brassica napus L. (rapeseed). In this study, Oryza sativa polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein 2 (OsPGIP2) effectively enhanced rapeseed immunity against S. sclerotiorum infection. Leaf extracts of B. napus plants overexpressing OsPGIP2 showed enhanced S. sclerotiorum resistance by delaying pathogen infection. The constitutive expression of OsPGIP2 in rapeseed plants provided a rapid and potentiated defense response, including the production of reactive oxygen species, interaction with S. sclerotiorum polygalacturonases (SsPG3 and SsPG6), and affected defense genes expression. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the pathogen induced many differentially expressed genes associated with pathogen recognition, redox homeostasis, mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling cascades, hormone signaling pathways, pathogen/defense related genes, and cell wall related genes. The overexpression of OsPGIP2 also led to constitutively increased cell wall cellulose and hemicellulose content in stems without compromising seed quality. Given that OsPGIP2 overexpression is known to confer S. sclerotiorum resistance in seedling and adult rapeseed, the results reported here demonstrate that OsPGIP2 plays a major role in rapeseed defense mechanisms. Our findings indicate that OsPGIP2 can improve disease resistance to S. sclerotiorum in rapeseed.
NA	Amino acid substitutions in a polygalacturonase inhibiting protein (OsPGIP2) increases sheath blight resistance in rice.	2019	Rice (N Y)	Horticulture and Plant Protection College, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, China. xjchen@yzu.edu.cn.	An economic strategy to control plant disease is to improve plant defense to pathogens by deploying resistance genes. Plant polygalacturonase inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) have a vital role in plant defense against phytopathogenic fungi by inhibiting fungal polygalacturonase (PG) activity. We previously reported that rice PGIP1 (OsPGIP1) inhibits PG activity in Rhizoctonia solani, the causal agent of rice sheath blight (SB), and is involved in regulating resistance to SB.Here, we report that OsPGIP2, the protein ortholog of OsPGIP1, does not possess PGIP activity; however, a few amino acid substitutions in a derivative of OsPGIP2, of which we provide support for L233F being the causative mutation, appear to impart OsPGIP2 with PG inhibition capability. Furthermore, the overexpression of mutated OsPGIP2L233F in rice significantly increased the resistance of transgenic lines and decreased SB disease rating scores. OsPGIP2L233F transgenic lines displayed an increased ability to reduce the tissue degradation caused by R. solani PGs as compared to control plants. Rice plants overexpressing OsPGIP2L233F showed no difference in agronomic traits and grain yield as compared to controls, thus demonstrating its potential use in rice breeding programs.In summary, our results provide a new target gene for breeding SB resistance through genome-editing or natural allele mining.
