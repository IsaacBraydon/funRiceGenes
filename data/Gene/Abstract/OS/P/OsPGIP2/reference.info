NA	Overexpression of OsPGIP2 confers Sclerotinia sclerotiorum resistance in Brassica napus through increased activation of defense mechanisms.	2018	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural university, Wuhan, Hubei, China.	Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR), caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, is the most serious disease affecting the yield of the agriculturally and economically important crop, Brassica napus L. (rapeseed). In this study, Oryza sativa polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein 2 (OsPGIP2) effectively enhanced rapeseed immunity against S. sclerotiorum infection. Leaf extracts of B. napus plants overexpressing OsPGIP2 showed enhanced S. sclerotiorum resistance by delaying pathogen infection. The constitutive expression of OsPGIP2 in rapeseed plants provided a rapid and potentiated defense response, including the production of reactive oxygen species, interaction with S. sclerotiorum polygalacturonases (SsPG3 and SsPG6), and affected defense genes expression. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the pathogen induced many differentially expressed genes associated with pathogen recognition, redox homeostasis, mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling cascades, hormone signaling pathways, pathogen/defense related genes, and cell wall related genes. The overexpression of OsPGIP2 also led to constitutively increased cell wall cellulose and hemicellulose content in stems without compromising seed quality. Given that OsPGIP2 overexpression is known to confer S. sclerotiorum resistance in seedling and adult rapeseed, the results reported here demonstrate that OsPGIP2 plays a major role in rapeseed defense mechanisms. Our findings indicate that OsPGIP2 can improve disease resistance to S. sclerotiorum in rapeseed.
