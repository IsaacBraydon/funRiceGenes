OsPGIP2	Overexpression of OsPGIP2 confers Sclerotinia sclerotiorum resistance in Brassica napus through increased activation of defense mechanisms. |  The constitutive expression of OsPGIP2 in rapeseed plants provided a rapid and potentiated defense response, including the production of reactive oxygen species, interaction with S |  The overexpression of OsPGIP2 also led to constitutively increased cell wall cellulose and hemicellulose content in stems without compromising seed quality |  Given that OsPGIP2 overexpression is known to confer S	Overexpression of OsPGIP2 confers Sclerotinia sclerotiorum resistance in Brassica napus through increased activation of defense mechanisms. |  The overexpression of OsPGIP2 also led to constitutively increased cell wall cellulose and hemicellulose content in stems without compromising seed quality |  Given that OsPGIP2 overexpression is known to confer S
