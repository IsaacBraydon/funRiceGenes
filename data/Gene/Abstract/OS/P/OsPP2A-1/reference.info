We found that okadaic acid, microcystin-LR, and calyculin A, which are known to specifically inhibit Ser/Thr phosphatases 1 and 2A, strongly inhibit the expression of the Osamy-c and may be involved in the germination of rice seeds. The protein phosphatase enzyme activity assays showed that there is no obvious effect of GA3 on total PP1/PP2A activities. To further understand the possible role of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A in the GA-dependent expression of Osamy-c, we isolated cDNA clones encoding protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A from a rice aleurone cDNA library. These were designated OsPP1c and OsPP2Ac, respectively. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of OsPP1c and OsPP2Ac with the catalytic subunits of PP1 or PP2A of rabbit skeletal muscle, Arabidopsis thaliana, maize and Brassica napus showed that the catalytic subunit sequences of PP1 or PP2A among these organisms are highly conserved (73% to 90% similarity). Genomic Southern blot analysis indicated that there are only one or two copies of OsPP1c genes and more than two copies of OsPP2Ac genes in the rice genome. Northern blot analysis showed that OsPP1c and OsPP2Ac genes are expressed in several organs of rice, including seed, shoot and root. We also showed by using 3â€‘ù<U+3E32> gene-specific probes of OsPP1c and OsPP2Ac cDNA, that the expression of neither gene is regulated by GA. Taken together, our results suggest that protein phosphatases PP1 or PP2A are involved in the GA-dependent expression of the rice Osamy-c gene, though the PP1 or/and PP2A enzymatic activities as well as mRNA levels do not increase upon GA3 treatment.
