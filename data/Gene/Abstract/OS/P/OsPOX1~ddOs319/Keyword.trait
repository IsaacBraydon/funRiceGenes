OsPOX1|ddOs319	cold stress	"Cold-Responsive Regulation of a Flower-Preferential Class III Peroxidase Gene, OsPOX1, in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)"	" Interestingly, at the later vacuolated pollen stage, the GUS activity was highly induced by cold stress, suggesting that OsPOX1 is a flower-preferential cold-responsive gene in rice"
OsPOX1|ddOs319	flower	Cold-Responsive Regulation of a Flower-Preferential Class III Peroxidase Gene, OsPOX1, in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	A full-length cDNA corresponding to ddOs319, previously isolated as a cold-responsive gene in the flowers by mRNA differential display (Plant Cell Rep 26:1097-1110, 2007), was obtained from the cold-treated flowers by reverse transcription and nested PCR
OsPOX1|ddOs319	shoot	Cold-Responsive Regulation of a Flower-Preferential Class III Peroxidase Gene, OsPOX1, in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Transgenic rice plants expressing P OsPOX1 -GUS showed minimal GUS activity in both shoots and roots at the vegetative stage
OsPOX1|ddOs319	pollen	Cold-Responsive Regulation of a Flower-Preferential Class III Peroxidase Gene, OsPOX1, in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Interestingly, at the later vacuolated pollen stage, the GUS activity was highly induced by cold stress, suggesting that OsPOX1 is a flower-preferential cold-responsive gene in rice
