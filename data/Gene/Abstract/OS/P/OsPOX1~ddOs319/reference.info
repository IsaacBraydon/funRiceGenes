During their reproductive stage, rice crops often are exposed to cold stress, which leads to sterility and reduced yields. To understand the cold response mechanism at that stage, we used an mRNA differential display method to isolate cold-responsive genes from pre-anthesis flowers. Approximately 5,000 transcripts were identified here, of which 123 were found to be displayed differentially between the control (30 degrees C) and cold-treated (12 degrees C) flowers. Among them, 26 were analyzed by northern analysis; 8 of those clones were confirmed as cold-responsive. OsLti6b, encoding a hydrophobic protein homologous to Arabidopsis RCI2, was analyzed in detail. RNA blot analysis revealed that its transcript is increased by cold, salt, drought, or ABA treatments. In situ hybridization indicated that this transcript is highly accumulated in the ovaries and stamens of cold-treated flowers, particularly in the anther walls and vascular tissues of the filaments. Over-expression of OsLti6b increased cold tolerance as revealed by seedling wilting rates and ion leakages of mature leaves, demonstrating that the extent of the tolerance correlates well with its expression level.

The cDNA encodes a putative class III peroxidase of 335 amino acids with 77~98% identity with rice peroxidases and named OsPOX1. To understand the regulation of OsPOX1 expression, a 1.8 kb promoter region of OsPOX1 was isolated and fused to Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. Transgenic rice plants expressing P OsPOX1 -GUS showed minimal GUS activity in both shoots and roots at the vegetative stage. In the flowers at early young microspore stage, GUS activity was detected in the veins and anthers. Interestingly, at the later vacuolated pollen stage, the GUS activity was highly induced by cold stress, suggesting that OsPOX1 is a flower-preferential cold-responsive gene in rice.
