Plants have evolved adaptive regulatory mechanisms to maintain phosphate (Pi) homeostasis by improving phosphorus uptake, translocation, remobilization and efficiency of use. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of the OsPHR2-mediated phosphate-signaling pathway in rice. OsPHR2 positively regulates the low-affinity Pi transporter OsPT2 through physical interaction and reciprocal regulation of OsPHO2 in roots. OsPT2 is responsible for most of the OsPHR2-mediated accumulation of excess Pi in shoots. OsSPX1 acts as a repressor in the OsPHR2-mediated phosphate-signaling pathway. Some mutants screened from ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized M2 population of OsPHR2 overexpression transgenic line removed the growth inhibition, indicating that some unknown factors are crucial for Pi utilization or plant growth under the regulation of OsPHR2.
169.pdf	OsMYB2P-1, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, is involved in the regulation of phosphate-starvation responses and root architecture in rice	2012	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, People's Republic of China.	An R2R3 MYB transcription factor, OsMYB2P-1, was identified from microarray data by monitoring the expression profile of rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) seedlings exposed to phosphate (Pi)-deficient medium. Expression of OsMYB2P-1 was induced by Pi starvation. OsMYB2P-1 was localized in the nuclei and exhibited transcriptional activation activity. Overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice enhanced tolerance to Pi starvation, while suppression of OsMYB2P-1 by RNA interference in rice rendered the transgenic rice more sensitive to Pi deficiency. Furthermore, primary roots of OsMYB2P-1-overexpressing plants were shorter than those in wild-type plants under Pi-sufficient conditions, while primary roots and adventitious roots of OsMYB2P-1-overexpressing plants were longer than those of wild-type plants under Pi-deficient conditions. These results suggest that OsMYB2P-1 may also be associated with the regulation of root system architecture. Overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 led to greater expression of Pi-responsive genes such as Oryza sativa UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase, OsIPS1, OsPAP10, OsmiR399a, and OsmiR399j. In contrast, overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 suppressed the expression of OsPHO2 under both Pi-sufficient and Pi-deficient conditions. Moreover, expression of OsPT2, which encodes a low-affinity Pi transporter, was up-regulated in OsMYB2P-1-overexpressing plants under Pi-sufficient conditions, whereas expression of the high-affinity Pi transporters OsPT6, OsPT8, and OsPT10 was up-regulated by overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 under Pi-deficient conditions, suggesting that OsMYB2P-1 may act as a Pi-dependent regulator in controlling the expression of Pi transporters. These findings demonstrate that OsMYB2P-1 is a novel R2R3 MYB transcriptional factor associated with Pi starvation signaling in rice.
9fcfd50a105b36339e.pdf	OsSPX1 suppresses the function of OsPHR2 in the regulation of expression of OsPT2 and phosphate homeostasis in shoots of rice	2010	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in plants is required for plant growth and development, and is achieved by the coordination of Pi acquisition, translocation from roots to shoots, and remobilization within plants. Previous reports have demonstrated that over-expression of OsPHR2 (the homolog of AtPHR1) and knockdown of OsSPX1 result in accumulation of excessive shoot Pi in rice. Here we report that OsPHR2 positively regulates the low-affinity Pi transporter gene OsPT2 by physical interaction and upstream regulation of OsPHO2 in roots. OsPT2 is responsible for most of the OsPHR2-mediated accumulation of excess shoot Pi. OsSPX1 suppresses the regulation on expression of OsPT2 by OsPHR2 and the accumulation of excess shoot Pi, but it does not suppress induction of OsPT2 or the accumulation of excessive shoot Pi in the Ospho2 mutant. Our data also show that OsSPX1 is a negative regulator of OsPHR2 and is involved in the feedback of Pi-signaling network in roots that is defined by OsPHR2 and OsPHO2. This finding provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism of Pi uptake, translocation, allocation and homeostasis in plants.
Chen-2011-OsPHF1 regulates the.pdf	OsPHF1 regulates the plasma membrane localization of low- and high-affinity inorganic phosphate transporters and determines inorganic phosphate uptake and translocation in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, People's Republic of China.	PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 (PHF1) is known to regulate the plasma membrane localization of PHT1;1, a high-affinity inorganic phosphate (Pi) transporter in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). OsPHF1, a rice (Oryza sativa) gene homologous to AtPHF1, was isolated and found to regulate the localization of both low- and high-affinity Pi transporters to the plasma membrane. Three OsPHF1 allelic mutants carrying one-point mutations at the fifth WD-repeat motif and two at the transmembrane helix, respectively, showed arsenate resistance and severely reduced Pi accumulation. The data indicate that mutation of OsPHF1 results in the endoplasmic reticulum retention of the low-affinity Pi transporter OsPT2 and high-affinity Pi transporter OsPT8. Mutation of OsPHF1 also reduced Pi accumulation in plants exhibiting excessive shoot Pi accumulation due to the overexpression of OsPHR2. However, the transcript level of OsPHF1 itself is not controlled by OsPHR2. Overexpression of OsPHF1 increased Pi accumulation in both roots and shoots in a solution culture with Pi-supplied condition. These results indicate that the role of OsPHF1 is unique in the localization of both low- and high-affinity Pi transporters on the plasma membrane in rice and determines Pi uptake and translocation in rice. The similar function of PHF1 required to facilitate PHT1 transit through the endoplasmic reticulum between Arabidopsis and rice provides an example of expectations from what one would deduce from sequence comparisons to extend knowledge from Arabidopsis to crops.
j.1365-313X.2008.03726.x.pdf	Two rice phosphate transporters, OsPht1;2 and OsPht1;6, have different functions and kinetic properties in uptake and translocation	2009	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Plant phosphate (Pi) transporters mediate the uptake and translocation of this nutrient within plants. A total of 13 sequences in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome can be identified as belonging to the Pi transporter (Pht1) family. Here, we report on the expression patterns, biological properties and the physiological roles of two members of the family: OsPht1;2 (OsPT2) and OsPht1;6 (OsPT6). Expression of both genes increased significantly under Pi deprivation in roots and shoots. By using transgenic rice plants expressing the GUS reporter gene, driven by their promoters, we detected that OsPT2 was localized exclusively in the stele of primary and lateral roots, whereas OsPT6 was expressed in both epidermal and cortical cells of the younger primary and lateral roots. OsPT6, but not OsPT2, was able to complement a yeast Pi uptake mutant in the high-affinity concentration range. Xenopus oocytes injected with OsPT2 mRNA showed increased Pi accumulation and a Pi-elicited depolarization of the cell membrane electrical potential, when supplied with mM external concentrations. Both results show that OsPT2 mediated the uptake of Pi in oocytes. In transgenic rice, the knock-down of either OsPT2 or OsPT6 expression by RNA interference significantly decreased both the uptake and the long-distance transport of Pi from roots to shoots. Taken together, these data suggest OsPT6 plays a broad role in Pi uptake and translocation throughout the plant, whereas OsPT2 is a low-affinity Pi transporter, and functions in translocation of the stored Pi in the plant.
j.1365-313X.2008.03734.x.pdf	Involvement of OsSPX1 in phosphate homeostasis in rice	2009	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Arabidopsis thaliana SPX (SYG/PHO81/XPR1) domain genes have recently been shown to be involved in the phosphate (Pi) signaling pathway. We show here that a rice (Oryza sativa) SPX gene, OsSPX1, is specifically induced by Pi starvation in roots. Suppression of OsSPX1 by RNA interference resulted in severe signs of toxicity caused by the over-accumulation of Pi, similar to that found in OsPHR2 (phosphate starvation response transcription factor 2) overexpressors and pho2 (phosphate-responsive mutant 2). Quantitative RT-PCR showed that expression of OsSPX1 was strongly induced in OsPHR2 overexpression and pho2 mutant plants, indicating that OsSPX1 occurs downstream of OsPHR2 and PHO2. The expression of 10 genes associated with the phosphate-starvation signal pathways was analyzed. Expression of OsPT2 (phosphate transporter 2) and OsPT8 was significantly induced in OsSPX1-RNAi (OsSPX1-Ri) plants, suggesting that over-accumulation of Pi in OsSPX1-Ri plants results from an increase in Pi transport. In contrast, overexpression of OsSPX1 suppressed the induction of expression by Pi starvation of all 10 phosphate starvation-induced genes tested: IPS1 (induced by phosphate starvation 1), IPS2, OsPAP10 (purple acid phosphatase 10), OsSQD2 (sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2), miR399d and miR399j (microRNA 399), OsPT2, OsPT3, OsPT6 and OsPT8. This suggests that OsSPX1 acts via a negative feedback loop to optimize growth under phosphate-limited conditions.
nph12596.pdf	OsPT2, a phosphate transporter, is involved in the active uptake of selenite in rice	2014	New Phytol	Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, 471003, China.	* Selenite is a predominant form of selenium (Se) available to plants, especially in anaerobic soils, but the molecular mechanism of selenite uptake by plants is not well understood. * ltn1, a rice mutant previously shown to have increased phosphate (Pi) uptake, was found to exhibit higher selenite uptake than the wild-type in both concentration- and time-dependent selenite uptake assays. Respiratory inhibitors significantly inhibited selenite uptake in the wildtype and the ltn1 mutant, indicating that selenite uptake was coupled with H(+) and energy-dependent. Selenite uptake was greatly enhanced under Pi-starvation conditions, suggesting that Pi transporters are involved in selenite uptake. * OsPT2, the most abundantly expressed Pi transporter in the roots, is also significantly up-regulated in ltn1 and dramatically induced by Pi starvation. OsPT2-overexpressing and knockdown plants displayed significantly increased and decreased rates of selenite uptake, respectively, suggesting that OsPT2 plays a crucial role in selenite uptake. Se content in rice grains also increased significantly in OsPT2-overexpressing plants. * These data strongly demonstrate that selenite and Pi share similar uptake mechanisms and that OsPT2 is involved in selenite uptake, which provides a potential strategy for breeding Se-enriched rice varieties.
PNAS-2002-Paszkowski-13324-9.pdf	Rice phosphate transporters include an evolutionarily divergent gene specifically activated in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis	2002	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Torrey Mesa Research Institute, San Diego, CA 92121, USA. uta.paszkowski@syngenta.com	Using a genome-wide approach, we asked how many transporter genes contribute to symbiotic phosphate uptake and analyzed their evolutionary conservation. Considering the sequenced rice genome at hand, only the Oryza sativa phosphate transporter (OsPT) gene OsPT11 was specifically induced during the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. This induction was confined to the root system and was tightly correlated with the degree of root colonization by Glomus intraradices. OsPT11 activation was independent of the nutritional status of the plant and phosphate availability in the rhizosphere. Moreover, infection of roots with the fungal pathogens Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium moniliforme did not activate OsPT11, corroborating the high signal specificity for OsPT11 activation in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. OsPT11 expression complemented a defect in phosphate uptake in a yeast strain mutated in its high-affinity P(i) transporter (pho84), thereby confirming its function. Recently, a phosphate transporter gene in potato was shown to be induced during arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Assessment of the phylogenetic relationship of the rice and potato protein revealed that the rice is nonorthologous to the potato protein. Further, there are no structural commonalities in the promoter regions. Thus, although cytological and physiological features of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis seem to be conserved, the molecular components may differ significantly between distantly related plant species.
NA	Differential effects of nitrogen forms on cell wall phosphorus remobilization in rice (Oryza sativa) are mediated by nitric oxide, pectin content and the expression of the phosphate transporter OsPT2	2016	Plant Physiology	Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences CITY: NanJing China 	NH4+ is a major source of inorganic nitrogen for rice, and NH4+ is known to stimulate the uptake of phosphorus (P). However, it is unclear whether NH4+ can also stimulate P remobilization when rice is grown under P-deficient conditions. In this study, we use two rice cultivars 'Nipponbare' (Nip) and 'Kasalath' (Kas) that differ in their cell wall P reutilization, to demonstrate that NH4+ positively regulates the pectin content and activity of pectin methylesterase in root cell walls under -P conditions, thereby remobilizing more P from the cell wall and increasing soluble P in roots and shoots. Interestingly, our results show that more nitric oxide (NO) was produced in the rice root when NH4+ was applied as the sole nitrogen source compared with the NO3-. The effect of NO on the reutilization of P from the cell walls was further demonstrated through the application of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4, 4, 5, 5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (c-PTIO). What's more, the phosphate transporter gene OsPT2 is upregulated under NH4+ supplementation and is therefore involved in the stimulated P remobilization. In conclusion, our data provide novel insight into the regulatory mechanism by which NH4+ stimulates Pi reutilization in cell walls of rice.
