Symbol	Expression
OsPht1;2|OsPT2	Differential effects of nitrogen forms on cell wall phosphorus remobilization in rice (Oryza sativa) are mediated by nitric oxide, pectin content and the expression of the phosphate transporter OsPT2
OsPht1;2|OsPT2	Over-expression of OsPT2 under a rice root specific promoter Os03g01700. |  Constitutive over-expression of OsPT2 may have negative effects on the growth of rice seedlings under high Pi condition |  To determine the actual effect of root-specific expression of OsPT2, a construction consisting of Os03g01700 promoter and OsPT2 CDS was used to transform rice
OsPht1;2|OsPT2	 High Zn supply triggered P starvation signal in root, thereafter increased the activities of both root-endogenous and -secreted acid phosphatase to release more Pi, and induced the expression OsPT2 and OsPT8 to uptake more P for plant growth
