OsFOR1|PGIP	OsPGIP4	The polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein 4 (OsPGIP4), a potential component of the qBlsr5a locus, confers resistance to bacterial leaf streak in rice.	 Our results not only provide the first report that rice PGIP could enhance resistant against a bacterial pathogen but also indicate that OsPGIP4 is a potential component of the qBlsr5a locus for bacterial leaf streak in rice
