Griffiths-2003-The evolution of CON.pdf	The evolution of CONSTANS-like gene families in barley, rice, and Arabidopsis	2003	Plant Physiol	John Innes Centre, Norwich Research Park, Colney, United Kingdom.	The CO (CONSTANS) gene of Arabidopsis has an important role in the regulation of flowering by photoperiod. CO is part of a gene family with 17 members that are subdivided into three classes, termed Group I to III here. All members of the family have a CCT (CO, CO-like, TOC1) domain near the carboxy terminus. Group I genes, which include CO, have two zinc finger B-boxes near the amino terminus. Group II genes have one B-box, and Group III genes have one B-box and a second diverged zinc finger. Analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) genomic sequence identified 16 genes (OsA-OsP) that were also divided into these three groups, showing that their evolution predates monocot/dicot divergence. Eight Group I genes (HvCO1-HvCO8) were isolated from barley (Hordeum vulgare), of which two (HvCO1 and HvCO2) were highly CO like. HvCO3 and its rice counterpart (OsB) had one B-box that was distantly related to Group II genes and was probably derived by internal deletion of a two B-box Group I gene. Sequence homology and comparative mapping showed that HvCO1 was the counterpart of OsA (Hd1), a major determinant of photoperiod sensitivity in rice. Major genes determining photoperiod response have been mapped in barley and wheat (Triticum aestivum), but none corresponded to CO-like genes. Thus, selection for variation in photoperiod response has affected different genes in rice and temperate cereals. The peptides of HvCO1, HvCO2 (barley), and Hd1 (rice) show significant structural differences from CO, particularly amino acid changes that are predicted to abolish B-box2 function, suggesting an evolutionary trend toward a one-B-box structure in the most CO-like cereal genes.
Huang-2012-The rice B-box zinc.pdf	The rice B-box zinc finger gene family: genomic identification, characterization, expression profiling and diurnal analysis	2012	PLoS One	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	BACKGROUND: The B-box (BBX) -containing proteins are a class of zinc finger proteins that contain one or two B-box domains and play important roles in plant growth and development. The Arabidopsis BBX gene family has recently been re-identified and renamed. However, there has not been a genome-wide survey of the rice BBX (OsBBX) gene family until now. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we identified 30 rice BBX genes through a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. Each gene was assigned a uniform nomenclature. We described the chromosome localizations, gene structures, protein domains, phylogenetic relationship, whole life-cycle expression profile and diurnal expression patterns of the OsBBX family members. Based on the phylogeny and domain constitution, the OsBBX gene family was classified into five subfamilies. The gene duplication analysis revealed that only chromosomal segmental duplication contributed to the expansion of the OsBBX gene family. The expression profile of the OsBBX genes was analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays throughout the entire life-cycle of rice cultivar Zhenshan 97 (ZS97). In addition, microarray analysis was performed to obtain the expression patterns of these genes under light/dark conditions and after three phytohormone treatments. This analysis revealed that the expression patterns of the OsBBX genes could be classified into eight groups. Eight genes were regulated under the light/dark treatments, and eleven genes showed differential expression under at least one phytohormone treatment. Moreover, we verified the diurnal expression of the OsBBX genes using the data obtained from the Diurnal Project and qPCR analysis, and the results indicated that many of these genes had a diurnal expression pattern. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The combination of the genome-wide identification and the expression and diurnal analysis of the OsBBX gene family should facilitate additional functional studies of the OsBBX genes.

To understand the functions of rice homologues of the Arabidopsis flowering-time gene CONSTANS (CO) and salt-tolerance gene STO, we performed a similarity search of the single-run sequence data of cDNA clones accumulated by the Rice Genome Research Program, and isolated seven rice cDNA clones (S3574, C60910, S12569, R2931, R1479, R1577, and E10707) coding for proteins containing one of two zinc-finger-like motifs. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences between these cDNAs and the CO gene revealed significant similarities (46%-61%) in the region of zinc-finger motifs. A domain having a high content of basic amino acids at the C-terminus of the CO protein was found in the corresponding region of proteins predicted by from cDNAs S3574, C60910, and S12569. Two amino acid sequences, "CCADEAAL" and "FCV(L)EDRA," which were present inside each zinc-finger in the Arabidposis regulatory protein STO, were also found in each of the two zinc-finger regions of proteins predicted from cDNAs R2931, R1479, R1577, and E10707. Using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) linkage analysis, we determined the chromosomal location of the seven cDNA clones. The position of R2931 on the RFLP linkage map was closely linked to Hd-3, one of the putative quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling heading date in rice.
