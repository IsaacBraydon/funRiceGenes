OsPHS1	development	OsPHS1 is required for both male and female gamete development in rice.	OsPHS1 is required for both male and female gamete development in rice.
OsPHS1	nucleus	OsPHS1 is required for both male and female gamete development in rice.	 Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that the OsPHS1 protein is situated in the nucleus and cytoplasm
OsPHS1	cytoplasm	OsPHS1 is required for both male and female gamete development in rice.	 Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that the OsPHS1 protein is situated in the nucleus and cytoplasm
OsPHS1	meiosis	OsPHS1 is required for both male and female gamete development in rice.	 Expression pattern analysis indicated that OsPHS1 expression levels were mainly expressed in panicles at the beginning of meiosis
OsPHS1	homologous chromosome pairing	OsPHS1 is required for both male and female gamete development in rice.	 Taken together, our results suggest an important role for OsPHS1 in homologous chromosome pairing in both male and female gametogenesis in rice
