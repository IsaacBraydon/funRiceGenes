OsPDT1	pollen	Oryza sativa PECTIN DEFECTIVE TAPETUM1 affects anther development through a pectin-mediated signaling pathway in rice.	 The ospdt1 mutant exhibited premature programmed cell death (PCD) of the tapetum and disordered pollen walls, resulting in aborted pollen grains
OsPDT1	anther	Oryza sativa PECTIN DEFECTIVE TAPETUM1 affects anther development through a pectin-mediated signaling pathway in rice.	 Pectin distribution in the anther sac was comparable between the mutant and the wild-type, suggesting that the structural pectin was not dramatically affected in ospdt1
OsPDT1	sterility	Oryza sativa PECTIN DEFECTIVE TAPETUM1 affects anther development through a pectin-mediated signaling pathway in rice.	 These results suggest that the mutation of OsPDT1 does not dramatically affect structural pectin but affects components of the pectin-mediated signaling pathway, such as OsiWAK1, and causes male sterility
OsPDT1	cell death	Oryza sativa PECTIN DEFECTIVE TAPETUM1 affects anther development through a pectin-mediated signaling pathway in rice.	 The ospdt1 mutant exhibited premature programmed cell death (PCD) of the tapetum and disordered pollen walls, resulting in aborted pollen grains
OsPDT1	tapetum	Oryza sativa PECTIN DEFECTIVE TAPETUM1 affects anther development through a pectin-mediated signaling pathway in rice.	 The ospdt1 mutant exhibited premature programmed cell death (PCD) of the tapetum and disordered pollen walls, resulting in aborted pollen grains
OsPDT1	tapetal	Oryza sativa PECTIN DEFECTIVE TAPETUM1 affects anther development through a pectin-mediated signaling pathway in rice.	 OsiWAK1 RNA interference lines exhibited earlier tapetal PCD, similar to ospdt1
OsPDT1	male sterility	Oryza sativa PECTIN DEFECTIVE TAPETUM1 affects anther development through a pectin-mediated signaling pathway in rice.	 These results suggest that the mutation of OsPDT1 does not dramatically affect structural pectin but affects components of the pectin-mediated signaling pathway, such as OsiWAK1, and causes male sterility
OsPDT1	pollen wall	Oryza sativa PECTIN DEFECTIVE TAPETUM1 affects anther development through a pectin-mediated signaling pathway in rice.	 The ospdt1 mutant exhibited premature programmed cell death (PCD) of the tapetum and disordered pollen walls, resulting in aborted pollen grains
OsPDT1	programmed cell death	Oryza sativa PECTIN DEFECTIVE TAPETUM1 affects anther development through a pectin-mediated signaling pathway in rice.	 The ospdt1 mutant exhibited premature programmed cell death (PCD) of the tapetum and disordered pollen walls, resulting in aborted pollen grains
