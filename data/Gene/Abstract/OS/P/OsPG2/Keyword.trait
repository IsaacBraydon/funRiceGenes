OsPG2	biotic stress	Structural Alteration of Rice Pectin Affects Cell Wall Mechanical Strength and Pathogenicity of the Rice Blast Fungus Under Weak Light Conditions.	 Under normal light conditions, overexpression of OsPG2 decreased the pectin content, but did not affect cell adhesion and sensitivity to biotic stresses
OsPG2	cell wall	Structural Alteration of Rice Pectin Affects Cell Wall Mechanical Strength and Pathogenicity of the Rice Blast Fungus Under Weak Light Conditions.	 Overexpression of OsPG2 in rice under weak light conditions increased the activity of PG, which increased the degradation of pectin in the cell wall, thereby reducing adhesion
