Symbol	Expression	Overexpression
OsPG2	 Overexpression of OsPG2 in rice under weak light conditions increased the activity of PG, which increased the degradation of pectin in the cell wall, thereby reducing adhesion |  However, the expression levels of disease resistance genes in non-infected leaves of OsPG2-FOX were more than twice as high as those of the WT and the intensity of disease symptoms was reduced, compared with the WT |  Under normal light conditions, overexpression of OsPG2 decreased the pectin content, but did not affect cell adhesion and sensitivity to biotic stresses	 Overexpression of OsPG2 in rice under weak light conditions increased the activity of PG, which increased the degradation of pectin in the cell wall, thereby reducing adhesion |  Under normal light conditions, overexpression of OsPG2 decreased the pectin content, but did not affect cell adhesion and sensitivity to biotic stresses
