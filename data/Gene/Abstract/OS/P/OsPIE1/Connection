OsPAP21b	OsPIE1	A phosphate-starvation induced RING-type E3 ligase maintains phosphate homeostasis partially through OsSPX2 in rice.	 Under Pi-sufficient condition, overexpression of OsPIE1 upregulated the expression of OsPT2, OsPT3, OsPT10 and OsPAP21b, resulting in Pi accumulation and acid phosphatases (APases) induction in roots

OsPIE1	OsSPX2	A phosphate-starvation induced RING-type E3 ligase maintains phosphate homeostasis partially through OsSPX2 in rice.	 OsSPX2 was strongly suppressed in OsPIE1 overexpressors
OsPIE1	OsSPX2	A phosphate-starvation induced RING-type E3 ligase maintains phosphate homeostasis partially through OsSPX2 in rice.	 Further comparative transcriptome analysis, tissue expression patterns and genetic interaction analysis indicated that the enhancing of Pi accumulation and APase activities upon overexpression of OsPIE1 was (at least in part) caused by repression of OsSPX2
