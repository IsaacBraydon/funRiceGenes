OsPIE1	 Using GUS staining and GFP detection, we analyzed tissue expression patterns of OsPIE1 and the subcellular localization of its encoded protein |  Under Pi-sufficient condition, overexpression of OsPIE1 upregulated the expression of OsPT2, OsPT3, OsPT10 and OsPAP21b, resulting in Pi accumulation and acid phosphatases (APases) induction in roots |  Further comparative transcriptome analysis, tissue expression patterns and genetic interaction analysis indicated that the enhancing of Pi accumulation and APase activities upon overexpression of OsPIE1 was (at least in part) caused by repression of OsSPX2	 Under Pi-sufficient condition, overexpression of OsPIE1 upregulated the expression of OsPT2, OsPT3, OsPT10 and OsPAP21b, resulting in Pi accumulation and acid phosphatases (APases) induction in roots |  Further comparative transcriptome analysis, tissue expression patterns and genetic interaction analysis indicated that the enhancing of Pi accumulation and APase activities upon overexpression of OsPIE1 was (at least in part) caused by repression of OsSPX2
