Symbol	Expression	Overexpression
OsPAP10c	 OsPAP10c overexpression increased acid phosphatase (APase) activity by more than 10-fold in the culture media and almost fivefold in both roots and leaves under Pi -sufficient and Pi -deficient conditions	 OsPAP10c overexpression increased acid phosphatase (APase) activity by more than 10-fold in the culture media and almost fivefold in both roots and leaves under Pi -sufficient and Pi -deficient conditions
OsPAP10c	 Two constructs were used to generate the OsPAP10c overexpression plants, by driving the OsPAP10c coding sequence with ubiquitin promoter (UP) or the OsPAP10c-native promoter (NP), respectively |  Compared with the UP transgenic plants, lower OsPAP10c expression level and APase activity were observed in the NP transgenic plants	 Two constructs were used to generate the OsPAP10c overexpression plants, by driving the OsPAP10c coding sequence with ubiquitin promoter (UP) or the OsPAP10c-native promoter (NP), respectively
