OsPAP10c	Pi	OsPAP10c, a novel secreted acid phosphatase in rice, plays an important role in the utilization of external organic phosphorus.	Both the transcript and protein levels of OsPAP10c are strongly induced by Pi starvation
OsPAP10c	Pi	OsPAP10c, a novel secreted acid phosphatase in rice, plays an important role in the utilization of external organic phosphorus.	OsPAP10c overexpression increased acid phosphatase (APase) activity by more than 10-fold in the culture media and almost fivefold in both roots and leaves under Pi -sufficient and Pi -deficient conditions

OsPAP10c	Ubiquitin	Purple acid phosphatase 10c (OsPAP10c) encodes a major acid phosphatase and regulates the plant growth under phosphate deficient condition in rice.	 Two constructs were used to generate the OsPAP10c overexpression plants, by driving the OsPAP10c coding sequence with ubiquitin promoter (UP) or the OsPAP10c-native promoter (NP), respectively
