NA	OsPAP10c, a novel secreted acid phosphatase in rice, plays an important role in the utilization of external organic phosphorus.	2016	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Under phosphate (Pi ) starvation, plants increase the secretion of purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) into the rhizosphere to scavenge organic phosphorus (P) for plant use. To date, only a few members of the PAP family have been characterized in crops. In this study, we identified a novel secreted PAP in rice, OsPAP10c, and investigated its role in the utilization of external organic P. OsPAP10c belongs to a monocotyledon-specific subclass of Ia group PAPs and is specifically expressed in the epidermis/exodermis cell layers of roots. Both the transcript and protein levels of OsPAP10c are strongly induced by Pi starvation. OsPAP10c overexpression increased acid phosphatase (APase) activity by more than 10-fold in the culture media and almost fivefold in both roots and leaves under Pi -sufficient and Pi -deficient conditions. This increase in APase activity further improved the plant utilization efficiency of external organic P. Moreover, several APase isoforms corresponding to OsPAP10c were identified using in-gel activity assays. Under field conditions with three different Pi supply levels, OsPAP10c-overexpressing plants had significantly higher tiller numbers and shorter plant heights. This study indicates that OsPAP10c encodes a novel secreted APase that plays an important role in the utilization of external organic P in rice.
NA	Purple acid phosphatase 10c (OsPAP10c) encodes a major acid phosphatase and regulates the plant growth under phosphate deficient condition in rice.	2020	J Exp Bot	Microelement Research Center, College of Resources &amp; Environment, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, P. R. China.	Although constitutive overexpression of a particular acid phosphatase (APase) could increase extracellular Po utilization, negative effects were frequently observed in the transgenic plants under Pi sufficient condition. In this study, the purple acid phosphatase 10c (OsPAP10c) was identified to be a novel major APase that exhibited both root surface associated and secreted APase activities in rice. Two constructs were used to generate the OsPAP10c overexpression plants, by driving the OsPAP10c coding sequence with ubiquitin promoter (UP) or the OsPAP10c-native promoter (NP), respectively. Compared with the UP transgenic plants, lower OsPAP10c expression level and APase activity were observed in the NP transgenic plants. However, the UP and NP plants showed a similar extracellular ATP degradation ability and promoted root growth. Moreover, the growth performance and yield of the NP transgenic plants were better than the WT and UP transgenic plants in both the hydroponic and field experiments irrespective of the Pi supply level. Therefore, overexpression of APase by its native promoter is a potential way to improve the crop production, which could avoid the increased APase activity in untargeted tissues and its inhibition to the growth of transgenic plants.
