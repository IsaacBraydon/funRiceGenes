OsPHY2	temperature	Molecular characterization and functional analysis of OsPHY2, a phytase gene classified in histidine acid phosphatase type in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Prokaryotic expressed OsPHY2 has a strong function on degradation of phytate, with optimal temperature of 47Â°C and optimal pH of 3
OsPHY2	growth	Molecular characterization and functional analysis of OsPHY2, a phytase gene classified in histidine acid phosphatase type in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Under the guidance of patatin signal peptide (PSP) of potato, the OsPHY2 expressed in tobacco could be secreted by the rhizosphere and hydrolyze the phytate into Pi, leading to a significantly more inorganic phosphate (Pi) accumulated and growth improved in plants under the condition using phytate as the sole phosphorus source
OsPHY2	seed	Molecular characterization and functional analysis of OsPHY2, a phytase gene classified in histidine acid phosphatase type in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 During the seed germination, the transcripts of OsPHY2 were much more detected in the germinated seeds than in the primary roots and the leaves
OsPHY2	seed	Molecular characterization and functional analysis of OsPHY2, a phytase gene classified in histidine acid phosphatase type in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Therefore, as one HAP type of the phytase genes, OsPHY2 plays a critical role on the degradation of the phytins during the seed germination and has a potential application on the generation of elite crop germplasms with high use of efficiency of phytate and a large quantity of organic phosphate compounds in the arable land
