NA	The polyketide synthase OsPKS2 is essential for pollen exine and Ubisch body patterning in rice.	2017	J Integr Plant Biol	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic &amp; Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University-University of Adelaide Joint Centre for Agriculture and Health, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.	Lipid and phenolic metabolism are important for pollen exine formation. In Arabidopsis, polyketide synthases (PKSs) are essential for both sporopollenin biosynthesis and exine formation. Here, we characterized the role of a polyketide synthase (OsPKS2) in male reproduction of rice (Oryza sativa). Recombinant OsPKS2 catalyzed the condensation of fatty acyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA to generate triketide and tetraketide Î±-pyrones, the main components of pollen exine. Indeed, the ospks2 mutant had defective exine patterning and was male sterile. However, the mutant showed no significant reduction in sporopollenin accumulation. Compared with the WT (wilde type), ospks2 displayed unconfined and amorphous tectum and nexine layers in the exine, and less organized Ubisch bodies. Like the pksb/lap5 mutant of the Arabidopsis ortholog, ospks2 showed broad alterations in the profiles of anther-related phenolic compounds. However, unlike pksb/lap5, in which most detected phenolics were substantially decreased, ospks2 accumulated higher levels of phenolics. Based on these results and our observation that OsPKS2 is unable to fully restore the exine defects in the pksb/lap5, we propose that PKS proteins have functionally diversified during evolution. Collectively, our results suggest that PKSs represent a conserved and diversified biochemical pathway for anther and pollen development in higher plants.
NA	OsPKS2 is required for rice male fertility by participating in pollen wall formation.	2018	Plant Cell Rep	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, 611130, China.	OsPKS2, the rice orthologous<U+00A0>gene of Arabidopsis PKSB/LAP5, encodes a polyketide synthase that is involved in pollen wall formation in rice. In flowering plants, the pollen wall protects male gametes from various environmental stresses and pathogen attacks, as well as promotes pollen germination. The biosynthesis of sporopollenin in tapetal cell is critical for pollen wall formation. Recently, progress has been made in understanding sporopollenin metabolism during pollen wall development in Arabidopsis. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism that underlies the sporopollenin synthesis in pollen wall formation in rice (Oryza sativa). In this study, we identified that a point mutation in OsPKS2, a plant-specific type III polyketide synthase gene, caused male sterility in rice by affecting the normal progress of pollen wall formation. Two other allelic mutants of OsPKS2 were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and are also completely male sterile. This result thus further confirmed that OsPKS2 controls rice male fertility. We also showed that OsPKS2 is an orthologous gene of Arabidopsis PKSB/LAP5 and has a tapetum-specific expression pattern. In addition, its product localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum. Results suggested that OsPKS2 is critical for pollen wall formation, and plays a conserved but differentiated role in sporopollenin biosynthesis from Arabidopsis.
