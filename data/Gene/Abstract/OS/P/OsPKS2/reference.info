NA	The polyketide synthase OsPKS2 is essential for pollen exine and Ubisch body patterning in rice.	2017	J Integr Plant Biol	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic &amp; Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University-University of Adelaide Joint Centre for Agriculture and Health, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.	Lipid and phenolic metabolism are important for pollen exine formation. In Arabidopsis, polyketide synthases (PKSs) are essential for both sporopollenin biosynthesis and exine formation. Here, we characterized the role of a polyketide synthase (OsPKS2) in male reproduction of rice (Oryza sativa). Recombinant OsPKS2 catalyzed the condensation of fatty acyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA to generate triketide and tetraketide Î±-pyrones, the main components of pollen exine. Indeed, the ospks2 mutant had defective exine patterning and was male sterile. However, the mutant showed no significant reduction in sporopollenin accumulation. Compared with the WT (wilde type), ospks2 displayed unconfined and amorphous tectum and nexine layers in the exine, and less organized Ubisch bodies. Like the pksb/lap5 mutant of the Arabidopsis ortholog, ospks2 showed broad alterations in the profiles of anther-related phenolic compounds. However, unlike pksb/lap5, in which most detected phenolics were substantially decreased, ospks2 accumulated higher levels of phenolics. Based on these results and our observation that OsPKS2 is unable to fully restore the exine defects in the pksb/lap5, we propose that PKS proteins have functionally diversified during evolution. Collectively, our results suggest that PKSs represent a conserved and diversified biochemical pathway for anther and pollen development in higher plants.
NA	OsPKS2 is required for rice male fertility by participating in pollen wall formation.	2018	Plant Cell Rep	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, 611130, China.	OsPKS2, the rice orthologous<U+00A0>gene of Arabidopsis PKSB/LAP5, encodes a polyketide synthase that is involved in pollen wall formation in rice. In flowering plants, the pollen wall protects male gametes from various environmental stresses and pathogen attacks, as well as promotes pollen germination. The biosynthesis of sporopollenin in tapetal cell is critical for pollen wall formation. Recently, progress has been made in understanding sporopollenin metabolism during pollen wall development in Arabidopsis. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism that underlies the sporopollenin synthesis in pollen wall formation in rice (Oryza sativa). In this study, we identified that a point mutation in OsPKS2, a plant-specific type III polyketide synthase gene, caused male sterility in rice by affecting the normal progress of pollen wall formation. Two other allelic mutants of OsPKS2 were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and are also completely male sterile. This result thus further confirmed that OsPKS2 controls rice male fertility. We also showed that OsPKS2 is an orthologous gene of Arabidopsis PKSB/LAP5 and has a tapetum-specific expression pattern. In addition, its product localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum. Results suggested that OsPKS2 is critical for pollen wall formation, and plays a conserved but differentiated role in sporopollenin biosynthesis from Arabidopsis.
NA	OsMS188 Is a Key Regulator of Tapetum Development and Sporopollenin Synthesis in Rice	2021	Rice (N Y)	Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, 100 Guilin Road, Shanghai, 200234, China.	Background: During anther development, the tapetum provides essential nutrients and materials for pollen development. In rice, multiple transcription factors and enzymes essential for tapetum development and pollen wall formation have been cloned from male-sterile lines.  Results: In this study, we obtained several lines in which the MYB transcription factor OsMS188 was knocked out through the CRISPR-Cas9 approach. The osms188 lines exhibited a male-sterile phenotype with aberrant development and degeneration of tapetal cells, absence of the sexine layer and defective anther cuticles. CYP703A3, CYP704B2, OsPKS1, OsPKS2, DPW and ABCG15 are sporopollenin synthesis and transport-related genes in rice. Plants with mutations in these genes are male sterile, with a defective sexine layer and anther cuticle. Further biochemical assays demonstrated that OsMS188 binds directly to the promoters of these genes to regulate their expression. UDT1, OsTDF1, TDR, bHLH142 and EAT1 are upstream regulators of rice tapetum development. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and activation assays revealed that TDR directly regulates OsMS188 expression. Additionally, protein interaction assays indicated that TDR interacts with OsMS188 to regulate downstream gene expression.  Conclusion: Overall, OsMS188 is a key regulator of tapetum development and pollen wall formation. The gene regulatory network established in this work may facilitate future investigations of fertility regulation in rice and in other crop species.
NA	Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in OsROS1a Causes Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2022	Int J Mol Sci	Hainan Institute, Zhejiang University, Sanya 572025, China.	For crop seed production, the development of anthers and male fertility are the main agronomic traits and key biological processes for flowering plants. Active DNA demethylation regulates many plant developmental processes and is ensured by 5-meC DNA glycosylase enzymes. To find out the role of OsROS1a, OsROS1a gene editing mutants were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The osros1a mutants had shrink spikelets, smaller anthers and pollen grains, and were not stained by iodine staining showing a significant reduction in total soluble sugar and starch contents as compared to wildtype (WT), which caused complete male sterility. Similarly, the expression of genes involved in pollen and anther development was decreased in osros1a mutants as compared to WT. Furthermore, bisulfite sequencing showed that the CG and CHG methylation of the OsPKS2 gene promoter was significantly increased in the osros1a mutant, which caused a reduced expression of OsPKS2 in osros1a mutants. DNA methylation of the TDR gene promoter was similar between WT and osros1a mutants, indicating that the DNA methylation effect by OsROS1a was gene specific. The expression of OsROS1a in the mutants was not changed, but it produced a frame-shift mutation to truncate the Pem-CXXC and RRMF domains. Combined with previous studies, our findings suggested that the RRMF domain in OsROS1a is the functional domain and loss of RRMF for OsROS1a causes sterility in rice.
