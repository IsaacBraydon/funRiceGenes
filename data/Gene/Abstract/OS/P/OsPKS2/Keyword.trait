OsPKS2	pollen	The polyketide synthase OsPKS2 is essential for pollen exine and Ubisch body patterning in rice.	The polyketide synthase OsPKS2 is essential for pollen exine and Ubisch body patterning in rice.
OsPKS2	pollen	The polyketide synthase OsPKS2 is essential for pollen exine and Ubisch body patterning in rice.	 Recombinant OsPKS2 catalyzed the condensation of fatty acyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA to generate triketide and tetraketide Î±-pyrones, the main components of pollen exine
OsPKS2	sterile	The polyketide synthase OsPKS2 is essential for pollen exine and Ubisch body patterning in rice.	 Indeed, the ospks2 mutant had defective exine patterning and was male sterile
