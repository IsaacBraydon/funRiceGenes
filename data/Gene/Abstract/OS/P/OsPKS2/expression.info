OsPKS2	 We also showed that OsPKS2 is an orthologous gene of Arabidopsis PKSB/LAP5 and has a tapetum-specific expression pattern
OsPKS2	 Furthermore, bisulfite sequencing showed that the CG and CHG methylation of the OsPKS2 gene promoter was significantly increased in the osros1a mutant, which caused a reduced expression of OsPKS2 in osros1a mutants
