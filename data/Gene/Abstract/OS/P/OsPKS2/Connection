OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	OsPKS2	OsMS188 Is a Key Regulator of Tapetum Development and Sporopollenin Synthesis in Rice	 CYP703A3, CYP704B2, OsPKS1, OsPKS2, DPW and ABCG15 are sporopollenin synthesis and transport-related genes in rice
DPW	OsPKS2	OsMS188 Is a Key Regulator of Tapetum Development and Sporopollenin Synthesis in Rice	 CYP703A3, CYP704B2, OsPKS1, OsPKS2, DPW and ABCG15 are sporopollenin synthesis and transport-related genes in rice
OsPKS2	STS1	SWOLLEN TAPETUM AND STERILITY 1 Is Required for Tapetum Degeneration and Pollen Wall Formation in Rice.	 Moreover, STS1 interacts with Polyketide Synthase 2 (OsPKS2) and Acyl-CoA Synthetase 12 (OsACOS12), two enzymes crucial in lipidic sporopollenin biosynthesis in pollen wall formation, suggesting a potentially lipidic metabolon for sporopollenin biosynthesis in rice
