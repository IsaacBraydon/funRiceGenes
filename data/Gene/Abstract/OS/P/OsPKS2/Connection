CYP703A3	OsPKS2	OsMS188 Is a Key Regulator of Tapetum Development and Sporopollenin Synthesis in Rice	 CYP703A3, CYP704B2, OsPKS1, OsPKS2, DPW and ABCG15 are sporopollenin synthesis and transport-related genes in rice
CYP704B2	OsPKS2	OsMS188 Is a Key Regulator of Tapetum Development and Sporopollenin Synthesis in Rice	 CYP703A3, CYP704B2, OsPKS1, OsPKS2, DPW and ABCG15 are sporopollenin synthesis and transport-related genes in rice
OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	OsPKS2	OsMS188 Is a Key Regulator of Tapetum Development and Sporopollenin Synthesis in Rice	 CYP703A3, CYP704B2, OsPKS1, OsPKS2, DPW and ABCG15 are sporopollenin synthesis and transport-related genes in rice
DPW	OsPKS2	OsMS188 Is a Key Regulator of Tapetum Development and Sporopollenin Synthesis in Rice	 CYP703A3, CYP704B2, OsPKS1, OsPKS2, DPW and ABCG15 are sporopollenin synthesis and transport-related genes in rice
OsPKS2	STS1	SWOLLEN TAPETUM AND STERILITY 1 Is Required for Tapetum Degeneration and Pollen Wall Formation in Rice.	 Moreover, STS1 interacts with Polyketide Synthase 2 (OsPKS2) and Acyl-CoA Synthetase 12 (OsACOS12), two enzymes crucial in lipidic sporopollenin biosynthesis in pollen wall formation, suggesting a potentially lipidic metabolon for sporopollenin biosynthesis in rice
AMD1	OsPKS2	Grass-specific ABERRANT MICROSPORE DEVELOPMENT 1 is required for maintaining pollen fertility in rice.	 Further biochemical assays indicate that AMD1 directly activates the transcription of DEFECTIVE POLLEN WALL (DPW) and POLYKETIDE SYNTHASE2 (OsPKS2), which are both implicated in sporopollenin biosynthesis during exine formation
