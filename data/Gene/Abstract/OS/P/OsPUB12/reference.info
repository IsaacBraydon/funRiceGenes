NA	The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.	2018	Cell Host Microbe	State Key Laboratory for Biology of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests, Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100193, China; Department of Plant Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.	Programmed cell death (PCD) plays critical roles in plant immunity but must be regulated to prevent excessive damage. The E3 ubiquitin ligase SPL11 negatively regulates PCD and immunity in plants. We show that SPL11 cell-death suppressor 2 (SDS2), an S-domain receptor-like kinase, positively regulates PCD and immunity in rice by engaging and regulating SPL11 and related kinases controlling defense responses. An sds2 mutant shows reduced immune responses and enhanced susceptibility to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Conversely, SDS2 over-expression induces constitutive PCD accompanied by elevated immune responses and enhanced resistance to M.<U+00A0>oryzae. SDS2 interacts with and phosphorylates SPL11, which in turn ubiquitinates SDS2, leading to its degradation. In addition, SDS2 interacts with related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases, OsRLCK118/176, that positively regulate immunity by phosphorylating the NADPH oxidase OsRbohB to stimulate ROS production. Thus, a plasma membrane-resident protein complex consisting of SDS2, SPL11, and OsRLCK118/176 controls PCD and immunity in rice.
