Triterpenes are one of the largest classes of plant metabolites and have important functions. A diverse array of triterpenoid skeletons are synthesized via the isoprenoid pathway by enzymatic cyclization of 2,3-oxidosqualene. The genomes of the lower plants Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and moss (Physcomitrella patens) contain just one oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) gene (for sterol biosynthesis), whereas the genomes of higher plants contain nine to 16 OSC genes. Here we carry out functional analysis of rice OSCs and rigorous phylogenetic analysis of 96 OSCs from higher plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor and Brachypodium distachyon. The functional analysis identified an amino acid sequence for isoarborinol synthase (OsIAS) (encoded by Os11g35710/OsOSC11) in rice. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that expansion of OSC members in higher plants has occurred mainly through tandem duplication followed by positive selection and diversifying evolution, and consolidated the previous suggestion that dicot triterpene synthases have been derived from an ancestral lanosterol synthase instead of directly from their cycloartenol synthases. The phylogenetic trees are consistent with the reaction mechanisms of the protosteryl and dammarenyl cations which parent a wide variety of triterpene skeletal types, allowing us to predict the functions of the uncharacterized OSCs.
NA	Identification of key amino acid residues determining product specificity of 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase in Oryza species.	2018	New Phytol	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China.	Triterpene synthases, also known as 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs), synthesize diverse triterpene skeletons that form the basis of an array of functionally divergent steroids and triterpenoids. Tetracyclic and pentacyclic triterpene skeletons are synthesized via protosteryl and dammarenyl cations, respectively. The mechanism of conversion between two scaffolds is not well understood. Here, we report a promiscuous OSC from rice (Oryza sativa) (OsOS) that synthesizes a novel pentacyclic triterpene orysatinol as its main product. The OsOS gene is widely distributed in indica subspecies of cultivated rice and in wild rice accessions. Previously, we have characterized a different OSC, OsPS, a tetracyclic parkeol synthase found in japonica subspecies. Phylogenetic and protein structural analyses identified three key amino acid residues (#732, #365, #124) amongst 46 polymorphic sites that determine functional conversion between OsPS and OsOS, specifically, the chair-semi(chair)-chair and chair-boat-chair interconversions. The different orientation of a fourth amino acid residue Y257 was shown to be important for functional conversion The discovery of orysatinol unlocks a new path to triterpene diversity in nature. Our findings also reveal mechanistic insights into the cyclization of oxidosqualene into tetra- and pentacyclic skeletons, and provide a new strategy to identify key residues determining OSC specificity.
