OsPOLP1	 pi 	Biochemical properties of a plastidial DNA polymerase of rice	Here, we propose to rename the plant PolI homologs as DNA polymerase pi (POLP), and investigate the biochemical properties of full-length OsPOLP1
OsPOLP1	phosphate	Biochemical properties of a plastidial DNA polymerase of rice	In addition, OsPOLP1 efficiently catalyzed strand displacement on nicked DNA with a 5'-deoxyribose phosphate, suggesting that this enzyme might be involved in a repair pathway similar to long-patch base excision repair
