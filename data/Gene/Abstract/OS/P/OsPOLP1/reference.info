gkf239.pdf	A novel DNA polymerase homologous to Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I from a higher plant, rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2002	Nucleic Acids Res	Department of Applied Biological Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, 2641 Yamazaki, Noda, Chiba 278-8510, Japan	A novel DNA polymerase, designated as OsPolI-like, has been identified from the higher plant, rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare). The OsPolI-like cDNA was 3765 bp in length, and the open reading frame encoded a predicted product of 977 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 100 kDa. The OsPolI-like gene has been mapped to chromosome 8 and contains 12 exons and 11 introns. The encoded protein showed a high degree of sequence and structural homology to Escherichia coli pol I protein, but differed from DNA polymerase γ and θ. The DNA polymerase domain of OsPolI-like showed DNA polymerase activity. Subcellular fractionation analysis suggested that the protein is localized in the plastid. Northern and western blotting, and in situ hybridization analyses demonstrated preferential expression of OsPolI-like in meristematic tissues such as shoot apical meristem, root apical meristem, leaf primordia and the marginal meristem. Interestingly, no expression was detected in mature leaves, although they have a high chloroplast content. These properties indicated that OsPolI-like is a novel plant DNA polymerase. The function of OsPolI-like is discussed in relation to plastid maturation.
J Cell Biol-2001-Vitha-111-20.pdf	FtsZ Ring Formation at the Chloroplast Division Site in Plants	2001	The Journal of Cell Biology	Department of Plant Biology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824	Among the events that accompanied the evolution of chloroplasts from their endosymbiotic ancestors was the host cell recruitment of the prokaryotic cell division protein FtsZ to function in chloroplast division. FtsZ, a structural homologue of tubulin, mediates cell division in bacteria by assembling into a ring at the midcell division site. In higher plants, two nuclear-encoded forms of FtsZ, FtsZ1 and FtsZ2, play essential and functionally distinct roles in chloroplast division, but whether this involves ring formation at the division site has not been determined previously. Using immunofluorescence microscopy and expression of green fluorescent protein fusion proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana, we demonstrate here that FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 localize to coaligned rings at the chloroplast midpoint. Antibodies specific for recognition of FtsZ1 or FtsZ2 proteins in Arabidopsis also recognize related polypeptides and detect midplastid rings in pea and tobacco, suggesting that midplastid ring formation by FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 is universal among flowering plants. Perturbation in the level of either protein in transgenic plants is accompanied by plastid division defects and assembly of FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 into filaments and filament networks not observed in wild-type, suggesting that previously described FtsZ-containing cytoskeletal-like networks in chloroplasts may be artifacts of FtsZ overexpression.

Despite their important cellular roles, relatively little is known about the mechanism of plastidial DNA replication and repair. Recently, we identified a novel DNA polymerase in Oryza Sativa L. (OsPOLP1, formerly termed OsPolI-like) that is homologous to prokaryotic DNA polymerase Is (PolIs), and suggested that this polymerase might be involved in plastidial DNA replication and repair. Here, we propose to rename the plant PolI homologs as DNA polymerase pi (POLP), and investigate the biochemical properties of full-length OsPOLP1. The purified OsPOLP1 elongated both DNA and RNA primer hybridized to a DNA template, and possessed a 3' exonuclease activity. Moreover, OsPOLP1 displayed high processivity and fidelity, indicating that this polymerase has the biochemical characteristics appropriate for DNA replication. We found that POLPs have two extra sequences in the polymerase domain that are absent in prokaryotic PolIs. Deletion of either insert from OsPOLP1 caused a decrease in DNA synthetic activity, processivity, and DNA binding activity. In addition, OsPOLP1 efficiently catalyzed strand displacement on nicked DNA with a 5'-deoxyribose phosphate, suggesting that this enzyme might be involved in a repair pathway similar to long-patch base excision repair. These results provide insights into the possible role of POLPs in plastidial DNA replication and repair.
