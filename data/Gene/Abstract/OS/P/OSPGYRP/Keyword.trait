OSPGYRP	stress	and tyrosine-rich protein) gene, which is involved in vesicle trafficking, enhanced cold tolerance in E. coli.	 The expression of the OSPGYRP gene was induced by cold, salt, and osmotic stress
OSPGYRP	stress	and tyrosine-rich protein) gene, which is involved in vesicle trafficking, enhanced cold tolerance in E. coli.	 These results show that OsPGYRP is a novel protein involved in vesicle trafficking and plays an important role in plant adaptation to stress
OSPGYRP	osmotic stress	and tyrosine-rich protein) gene, which is involved in vesicle trafficking, enhanced cold tolerance in E. coli.	 The expression of the OSPGYRP gene was induced by cold, salt, and osmotic stress
