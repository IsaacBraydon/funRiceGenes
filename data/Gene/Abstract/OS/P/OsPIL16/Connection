APG|OsPIL16	OsPIL11	Characterization of a Set of Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like bHLH Proteins inOryza sativa	In this study, we identified and characterized a set of highly homologous members (designated OsPIL11 to OsPIL16) in the model monocotyledon rice (Oryza sativa)
APG|OsPIL16	PGL2|OsBUL1|OsbHLH173	An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG	PGL2 interacts with a typical bHLH protein APG, a negative regulator of rice grain length and weight, in vitro and in vivo
APG|OsPIL16	PGL2|OsBUL1|OsbHLH173	An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG	These findings suggest that PGL2 and PGL1 redundantly suppress the function of APG by forming heterodimers to positively regulate the rice grain length, while the pathway through which BU1, the closest homolog of PGL2, controls grain length is independent of APG
APG|OsPIL16	PGL1	An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG	Previously, we have shown that an antagonistic pair of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 1 (PGL1) and ANTAGONIST OF PGL1 (APG), is involved in controlling rice grain length
APG|OsPIL16	PGL1	An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG	These findings suggest that PGL2 and PGL1 redundantly suppress the function of APG by forming heterodimers to positively regulate the rice grain length, while the pathway through which BU1, the closest homolog of PGL2, controls grain length is independent of APG
APG|OsPIL16	PGL1	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	We identified the interaction partner of PGL1 and named it ANTAGONIST OF PGL1 (APG)
APG|OsPIL16	PGL1	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	PGL1 and APG interacted in vivo and localized in the nucleus
APG|OsPIL16	PGL1	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	As expected, silencing of APG produced the same phenotype as overexpression of PGL1, suggesting antagonistic roles for the two genes
APG|OsPIL16	PGL1	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants
APG|OsPIL16	PGL1	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	PGL1-APG represents a new grain length and weight-controlling pathway in which APG is a negative regulator whose function is inhibited by PGL1
APG|OsPIL16	SRS3|OsKINESIN-13A	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants
APG|OsPIL16	GS3	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants
APG|OsPIL16	OsDREB1B	Phytochrome B Negatively Affects Cold Tolerance by Regulating OsDREB1 Gene Expression through Phytochrome Interacting Factor-Like Protein OsPIL16 in Rice.	Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR assay revealed that OsPIL16 can bind to the N-box region of OsDREB1B promoter
APG|OsPIL16	PHYB|OsphyB	Phytochrome B Negatively Affects Cold Tolerance by Regulating OsDREB1 Gene Expression through Phytochrome Interacting Factor-Like Protein OsPIL16 in Rice.	Expression pattern analyses revealed that OsPIL16 transcripts were induced by cold stress and was significantly higher in the phyB mutant than in the WT
APG|OsPIL16	PHYB|OsphyB	Phytochrome B Negatively Affects Cold Tolerance by Regulating OsDREB1 Gene Expression through Phytochrome Interacting Factor-Like Protein OsPIL16 in Rice.	Moreover, yeast two-hybrid assay showed that OsPIL16 can bind to rice PHYB
APG|OsPIL16	PHYB|OsphyB	Phytochrome B Negatively Affects Cold Tolerance by Regulating OsDREB1 Gene Expression through Phytochrome Interacting Factor-Like Protein OsPIL16 in Rice.	Based on these results, we propose that phyB deficiency positively regulates OsDREB1 expression through OsPIL16 to enhance cell membrane integrity and to reduce the malondialdehyde concentration, resulting in the improved cold tolerance of the phyB mutants
APG|OsPIL16	FH5|RMD|BUI1	The rice actin-binding protein RMD regulates light-dependent shoot gravitropism.	 RMD gene expression is diurnally controlled and directly repressed by the phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein OsPIL16
APG|OsPIL16	FH5|RMD|BUI1	The rice actin-binding protein RMD regulates light-dependent shoot gravitropism.	 Consequently, over-expression of OsPIL16 led to gravisensing and actin patterning defects that phenocopied the rmd mutant
