OsPE	seed	Development of multiple embryos in polyembryonic insertional mutant OsPE of rice	A T-DNA insertional mutant OsPE of rice gives twin and triplet seedlings in up to 20 % of the seeds| Confocal laser scanning microscopic (CLSM) analysis of the developing seeds of OsPE showed multiple embryo development in up to 60 % of the ovules| Key message Multiple seedlings in the OsPE mutant are due to sequential proliferation and cleavage of the zygotic embryos
OsPE	shoot	The polyembryo gene (OsPE) in rice	 RT-PCR showed the expression of OsPE gene in Basmati 370 shoots
OsPE	seed	The polyembryo gene (OsPE) in rice	, multiple embryos in the seeds in the knockout mutant OsPE whereas its wild-type allele strictly controls single embryo per seed
OsPE	seedling	Development of multiple embryos in polyembryonic insertional mutant OsPE of rice	A T-DNA insertional mutant OsPE of rice gives twin and triplet seedlings in up to 20 % of the seeds| Key message Multiple seedlings in the OsPE mutant are due to sequential proliferation and cleavage of the zygotic embryos
