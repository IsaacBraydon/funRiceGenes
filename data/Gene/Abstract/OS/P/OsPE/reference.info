T-DNA insertional mutagenesis is one of the most important approaches for gene discovery and cloning. A fertile polyembryo mutant generated by T-DNA/Ds insertion in Oryza sativa, cv. Basmati 370 showed twin or triple seedlings at a frequency of 15-20%. T-DNA insertion was confirmed by 950 bp hpt gene amplification in the promoter region of the candidate gene. The annotated protein corresponding to the OsPE candidate gene has been reported as a hypothetical protein in O. sativa. OsPE gene lacked functional homologs in other species. No OsPE paralog was found in rice. No conserved domains were found in the protein coded by OsPE. RT-PCR showed the expression of OsPE gene in Basmati 370 shoots. Full-length OsPE gene was cloned in Basmati 370. The combined use of Southern blot, genome walking, TAIL-PCR, RT-PCR techniques, and bioinformatics led to the identification of a candidate gene controlling the multiple embryos in rice. There is gain of function, i.e., multiple embryos in the seeds in the knockout mutant OsPE whereas its wild-type allele strictly controls single embryo per seed. The seeds with multiple embryos are distributed at random in the rice mutant panicle. The origin of multiple embryos, whether apomictic, zygotic or both is under investigation.
jhiijo.pdf	Development of multiple embryos in polyembryonic insertional mutant OsPE of rice	2012	Plant Cell Rep	Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, 247 667, Uttaranchal, India. priyaincal@gmail.com	A T-DNA insertional mutant OsPE of rice gives twin and triplet seedlings in up to 20 % of the seeds. Detailed cytological and histological analysis of OsPE indicated normal male and female gametogenesis in the OsPE mutant. Confocal laser scanning microscopic (CLSM) analysis of the developing seeds of OsPE showed multiple embryo development in up to 60 % of the ovules. The multiple embryos, mostly twins and triplets, and rarely quadruplets, developed through sequential cleavage from a single zygotic embryo in each ovule. The reduced number of multiple seedlings compared with multiple embryos observed in CLSM study may be attributed to their inability to develop further due to competition in a single embryo sac. Key message Multiple seedlings in the OsPE mutant are due to sequential proliferation and cleavage of the zygotic embryos. The nucellar tissue was not involved in multiple embryo development.
