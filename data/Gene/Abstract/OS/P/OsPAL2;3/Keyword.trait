OsPAL2;3	transcription factor	OsMYB57 transcriptionally regulates OsMAPK11 to interact with OsPAL2;3 and modulate rice allelopathy.	 The transcriptional ability of OsPAL2;3 was higher in the allelopathic rice PI312777 than in the non-allelopathic rice Lemont, and OsPAL2;3 was negatively regulated by Whirly transcription factors
OsPAL2;3	Kinase	OsMYB57 transcriptionally regulates OsMAPK11 to interact with OsPAL2;3 and modulate rice allelopathy.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation incorporated with HiSeq demonstrated that OsMYB57 transcriptionally regulated a mitogen-activated protein kinase (OsMAPK11); in addition, OsMAPK11 interacted with OsPAL2;3
