NA	Identification of alternatively spliced transcripts of rice phytochelatin synthase 2 gene OsPCS2 involved in mitigation of cadmium and arsenic stresses.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, 721302, India.	The OsPCS2 exhibits root- and shoot-specific differential ratios of alternatively spliced transcripts in indica rice under Cd stress, and plays role in Cd and As stress tolerance and accumulation. Enzymatic activity of phytochelatin synthase (PCS) in plant produces phytochelatins, which help in sequestration of heavy metal(loid)s inside the cell vacuole to alleviate toxicity. Here we report that among the two PCS genes-OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 in indica rice (Oryza sativa) cultivar, the OsPCS2 produces an alternatively spliced OsPCS2b transcript that bears the unusual premature termination codon besides the canonically spliced OsPCS2a transcript. Root- and shoot-specific differential ratios of alternatively spliced OsPCS2a and OsPCS2b transcript expressions were observed under cadmium stress. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells transformed with OsPCS2a exhibited increased cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) tolerance and accumulation, unlike the OsPCS2b transformed yeast cells. An intron-containing hairpin RNA-mediated gene silencing was carried out in endosperm-specific manner for efficient down-regulation of OsPCS genes in rice grains. Analysis of the transgenic rice lines grown under metal(loid) stress revealed almost complete absence of both OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 transcripts in the developing seeds coupled with the significant reduction in the content of Cd (~51%) and As (~35%) in grains compared with the non-transgenic plant. Taken together, the findings indicate towards a crucial role played by the tissue-specific alternative splicing and relative abundance of the OsPCS2 gene during heavy metal(loid) stress mitigation in rice plant.
NA	Domain exchange between Oryza sativa phytochelatin synthases reveals a region that determines responsiveness to arsenic and heavy metals.	2020	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, 305-8604, Japan.	Phytochelatin synthases (PCSs) are activated by toxic metals/metalloids such as cadmium and arsenic and synthesize phytochelatins for detoxification of toxic elements. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) has two PCSs (OsPCS1 and OsPCS2), and we previously revealed that OsPCS1 has a higher responsiveness to arsenic than to cadmium, while OsPCS2 has a higher responsiveness to cadmium than to arsenic. Moreover, we found that the specific responsiveness of OsPCS1 to arsenic at rice nodes is a key factor in reducing arsenic in rice grains. However, the molecular characteristics of two PCSs in rice that contribute to the responsiveness to arsenic or heavy metals, including Cd, remain unclear. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the C-terminal region in PCSs determines the responsiveness to arsenic or cadmium. We constructed chimeric proteins between OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 and performed an in<U+00A0>vitro phytochelatin synthesis assay. A chimeric protein in which the 183<U+00A0>C-terminal amino acids of OsPCS2 were replaced with the 185<U+00A0>C-terminal amino acids of OsPCS1 showed higher responsiveness to arsenite than to cadmium, similar to OsPCS1. Contrary to expectations, mutations of cysteine residues that are unique to OsPCS1 or OsPCS2 had little influence on the responsiveness, although cysteine residues are reported to be representative of sites that interact with metals/metalloids. These results would enable the development of a breeding technology for reducing arsenic in rice grains by improving the arsenic-dependent activation of PCSs.
