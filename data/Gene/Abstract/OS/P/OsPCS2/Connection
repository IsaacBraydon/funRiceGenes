OsPCS1	OsPCS2	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	 The levels of As in grains and node I were similar between the two mutants, suggesting that OsABCC1 preferentially cooperates with OsPCS1 to sequester As, although rice has another phytochelatin synthase, OsPCS2
OsPCS1	OsPCS2	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	 In vitro phytochelatin synthesis assay indicated that OsPCS1 was more sensitive to activation by As than by cadmium, whereas OsPCS2 was more weakly activated by As than by cadmium
