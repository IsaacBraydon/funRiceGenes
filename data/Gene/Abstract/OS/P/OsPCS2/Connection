OsPCS1	OsPCS2	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	 The levels of As in grains and node I were similar between the two mutants, suggesting that OsABCC1 preferentially cooperates with OsPCS1 to sequester As, although rice has another phytochelatin synthase, OsPCS2
OsPCS1	OsPCS2	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	 In vitro phytochelatin synthesis assay indicated that OsPCS1 was more sensitive to activation by As than by cadmium, whereas OsPCS2 was more weakly activated by As than by cadmium
OsPCS1	OsPCS2	Phytochelatin synthase has contrasting effects on cadmium and arsenic accumulation in rice grains.	 First, we isolated four different transcript variants of OsPCS1 as well as one from OsPCS2
OsPCS1	OsPCS2	Phytochelatin synthase has contrasting effects on cadmium and arsenic accumulation in rice grains.	 Quantitative RT-PCR of each OsPCS transcript in rice seedlings suggested that expression of OsPCS1full, the longest OsPCS1 variant, was most abundant, followed by OsPCS2
OsPCS1	OsPCS2	Domain exchange between Oryza sativa phytochelatin synthases reveals a region that determines responsiveness to arsenic and heavy metals.	) has two PCSs (OsPCS1 and OsPCS2), and we previously revealed that OsPCS1 has a higher responsiveness to arsenic than to cadmium, while OsPCS2 has a higher responsiveness to cadmium than to arsenic
OsPCS1	OsPCS2	Domain exchange between Oryza sativa phytochelatin synthases reveals a region that determines responsiveness to arsenic and heavy metals.	 We constructed chimeric proteins between OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 and performed an in<U+00A0>vitro phytochelatin synthesis assay
OsPCS1	OsPCS2	Domain exchange between Oryza sativa phytochelatin synthases reveals a region that determines responsiveness to arsenic and heavy metals.	 A chimeric protein in which the 183<U+00A0>C-terminal amino acids of OsPCS2 were replaced with the 185<U+00A0>C-terminal amino acids of OsPCS1 showed higher responsiveness to arsenite than to cadmium, similar to OsPCS1
OsPCS1	OsPCS2	Domain exchange between Oryza sativa phytochelatin synthases reveals a region that determines responsiveness to arsenic and heavy metals.	 Contrary to expectations, mutations of cysteine residues that are unique to OsPCS1 or OsPCS2 had little influence on the responsiveness, although cysteine residues are reported to be representative of sites that interact with metals/metalloids
