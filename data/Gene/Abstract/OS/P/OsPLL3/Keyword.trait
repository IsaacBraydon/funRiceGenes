Symbol	Keyword	Title	Evidence
OsPLL3	development	Genome-wide identification of the pectate lyase-like (PLL) gene family and functional analysis of two PLL genes in rice.	 Moreover, knockdown of OsPLL3 and OsPLL4 by artificial microRNA (amiRNA) disrupted normal pollen development and resulted in partial male sterility
OsPLL3	pollen	Genome-wide identification of the pectate lyase-like (PLL) gene family and functional analysis of two PLL genes in rice.	 Moreover, knockdown of OsPLL3 and OsPLL4 by artificial microRNA (amiRNA) disrupted normal pollen development and resulted in partial male sterility
OsPLL3	sterility	Genome-wide identification of the pectate lyase-like (PLL) gene family and functional analysis of two PLL genes in rice.	 Moreover, knockdown of OsPLL3 and OsPLL4 by artificial microRNA (amiRNA) disrupted normal pollen development and resulted in partial male sterility
