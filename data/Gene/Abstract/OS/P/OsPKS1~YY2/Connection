OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	YY1|OsLTPc2|LTPL45	Isolation and characterization of two cDNA clones for mRNAs that are abundantly expressed in immature anthers of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Two cDNAs (YY1 and YY2), representing genes that are specifically expressed in anthers at the uninucleate microspore stage, were isolated and characterized
OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	YY1|OsLTPc2|LTPL45	Isolation and characterization of two cDNA clones for mRNAs that are abundantly expressed in immature anthers of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	The genes correspond to YY1 and YY2 cDNAs were shown to exist as single copies in the rice genome
OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	OsTKPR1|OsDFR2|OS-DFR2	Conserved metabolic steps for sporopollenin precursor formation in tobacco and rice	Similarly, recombinant rice OsPKS1 and OsTKPR1 were shown to function as downstream enzymes of NtACOS1
OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	OsTKPR1|OsDFR2|OS-DFR2	Conserved metabolic steps for sporopollenin precursor formation in tobacco and rice	Using fatty acids as starting substrates, sequential activities of heterologously expressed tobacco enzymes NtACOS1, NtPKS1 and NtTKPR1 resulted in the production of reduced tetraketide alpha-pyrones
