OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	tapetal	Isolation and characterization of two cDNA clones for mRNAs that are abundantly expressed in immature anthers of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Expression of YY2 mRNA was confined to the tapetal cells
OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	microspore	Isolation and characterization of two cDNA clones for mRNAs that are abundantly expressed in immature anthers of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Two cDNAs (YY1 and YY2), representing genes that are specifically expressed in anthers at the uninucleate microspore stage, were isolated and characterized
OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	anther	Isolation and characterization of two cDNA clones for mRNAs that are abundantly expressed in immature anthers of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Two cDNAs (YY1 and YY2), representing genes that are specifically expressed in anthers at the uninucleate microspore stage, were isolated and characterized
OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	pollen	OsLAP6/OsPKS1, an orthologue of Arabidopsis PKSA/LAP6, is critical for proper pollen exine formation.	We identified a rice mutant oslap6 with complete male sterile phenotype caused by defects in pollen exine formation
OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	sterile	OsLAP6/OsPKS1, an orthologue of Arabidopsis PKSA/LAP6, is critical for proper pollen exine formation.	We identified a rice mutant oslap6 with complete male sterile phenotype caused by defects in pollen exine formation
OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	pollen exine formation	OsLAP6/OsPKS1, an orthologue of Arabidopsis PKSA/LAP6, is critical for proper pollen exine formation.	We identified a rice mutant oslap6 with complete male sterile phenotype caused by defects in pollen exine formation
OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	pollen	OsPKS1 is required for sexine layer formation, which shows functional conservation between rice and Arabidopsis.	 Cytological observations revealed that abnormal bacula deposition and ubisch body structures for sexine formation led to pollen rupture in ospks1
OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	anther	OsPKS1 is required for sexine layer formation, which shows functional conservation between rice and Arabidopsis.	 The expression analysis showed that the OsPKS1 was highly expressed in tapetal cells and anther locules from stage 9 to stage 11 during anther development in rice
OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	development	OsPKS1 is required for sexine layer formation, which shows functional conservation between rice and Arabidopsis.	 The expression analysis showed that the OsPKS1 was highly expressed in tapetal cells and anther locules from stage 9 to stage 11 during anther development in rice
OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	sterile	OsPKS1 is required for sexine layer formation, which shows functional conservation between rice and Arabidopsis.	 The OsPKS1 knockout mutants obtained by Crispr-Cas9-mediated editing exhibited a complete male sterile phenotype
OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	tapetal	OsPKS1 is required for sexine layer formation, which shows functional conservation between rice and Arabidopsis.	 The expression analysis showed that the OsPKS1 was highly expressed in tapetal cells and anther locules from stage 9 to stage 11 during anther development in rice
