Hihara-1996-Isolation and charac.pdf	Isolation and characterization of two cDNA clones for mRNAs that are abundantly expressed in immature anthers of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	1996	Plant Mol Biol	Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo, Yayoi 1-1-1, 113, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan	The relationship between the length of anthers and the stage of development of microspores was examined in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Hayayuki). Anthers of ‚âêı<U+3E34>2 mm and 2.1‚Ä<U+393C><U+3E33>2.2 mm in length and those ready to dehiscence were determined to be at the uninucleate, binucleate and trinucleate microspore stage, respectively. Two cDNAs (YY1 and YY2), representing genes that are specifically expressed in anthers at the uninucleate microspore stage, were isolated and characterized. YY1 cDNA encoded an open reading frame of 95 amino acids. Eight cysteine residues with the potential to form disulfide bridges were present in the amino acid sequence. There was a hydrophobic region at the N-terminus of the putative protein, suggesting that the YY1 protein might be secreted. This cysteine motif and the hydrophobic N-terminus are conserved among products of several anther-specific genes or cDNAs isolated from various plant species. These proteins are thought to form a superfamily of proteins that are confined to anthers. The YY1 transcript was localized in the tapetal cells and the peripheral cells of the vascular bundle. YY2 cDNA encoded an open reading frame of 389 amino acids and the deduced amino acid sequence exhibited substantial homology to that of chalcone synthase. Expression of YY2 mRNA was confined to the tapetal cells. The genes correspond to YY1 and YY2 cDNAs were shown to exist as single copies in the rice genome.
Mol. Plant-2008-Zhang-599-610.pdf	Tapetum degeneration retardation is critical for aliphatic metabolism and gene regulation during rice pollen development	2008	Mol Plant	Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, China.	As a complex wall system in flowering plants, the pollen outer wall mainly contains aliphatic sporopollenin; however, the mechanism for synthesizing these lipidic precursors during pollen development remains less well understood. Here, we report on the function of the rice tapetum-expressing TDR (Tapetum Degeneration Retardation) gene in aliphatic metabolism and its regulatory role during rice pollen development. The observations of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses suggested that pollen wall formation was significantly altered in the tdr mutant. The contents of aliphatic compositions of anther were greatly changed in the tdr mutant revealed by GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) testing, particularly less accumulated in fatty acids, primary alcohols, alkanes and alkenes, and an abnormal increase in secondary alcohols with carbon lengths from C29 to C35 in tdr. Microarray data revealed that a group of genes putatively involved in lipid transport and metabolism were significantly altered in the tdr mutant, indicating the critical role of TDR in the formation of the pollen wall. Also, a wide range of genes (236 in total-154 up-regulated and 82 down-regulated) exhibited statistically significant expressional differences between wild-type and tdr. In addition to its function in promoting tapetum PCD, TDR possibly plays crucial regulatory roles in several basic biological processes during rice pollen development.
Wang-2013-Conserved metabolic.pdf	Conserved metabolic steps for sporopollenin precursor formation in tobacco and rice	2013	Physiol Plant	School of Biological Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.	The development of pollen wall with proper sporopollenin deposition is essential for pollen viability and male fertility in flowering plants. Sporopollenin is a complex biopolymer synthesized from fatty acid and phenolic derivatives. Recent investigations in Arabidopsis have identified a number of anther-specific genes involved in the production of fatty-acyl monomers potentially required for exine formation. The existence of ancient biochemical pathways for sporopollenin biosynthesis has been widely proposed but experimental evidence from plant species other than Arabidopsis is not extensively available. Here, we investigated the metabolic steps catalyzed by the anther-specific acyl-CoA synthetase (ACOS), polyketide synthase (PKS) and tetraketide alpha-pyrone reductase (TKPR). Using fatty acids as starting substrates, sequential activities of heterologously expressed tobacco enzymes NtACOS1, NtPKS1 and NtTKPR1 resulted in the production of reduced tetraketide alpha-pyrones. Transgenic RNA interference lines were then generated for the different tobacco genes which were demonstrated to be indispensable for normal pollen development and male fertility. Similarly, recombinant rice OsPKS1 and OsTKPR1 were shown to function as downstream enzymes of NtACOS1. In addition, insertion mutant lines for these rice genes displayed different levels of impaired pollen and seed formation. Taken together, reduced tetraketide alpha-pyrones appear to represent common sporopollenin fatty-acyl precursors essential for male fertility in taxonomically distinct plant species.
NA	OsLAP6/OsPKS1, an orthologue of Arabidopsis PKSA/LAP6, is critical for proper pollen exine formation.	2017	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, 611130, China.	Male fertility is crucial for rice yield, and the improvement of rice yield requires hybrid production that depends on male sterile lines. Although recent studies have revealed several important genes in male reproductive development, our understanding of the mechanisms of rice pollen development remains unclear.We identified a rice mutant oslap6 with complete male sterile phenotype caused by defects in pollen exine formation. By using the MutMap method, we found that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation located in the second exon of OsLAP6/OsPKS1 was responsible for the mutant phenotype. OsLAP6/OsPKS1 is an orthologous gene of Arabidopsis PKSA/LAP6, which functions in sporopollenin metabolism. Several other loss-of-function mutants of OsLAP6/OsPKS1 generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing tool also exhibited the same phenotype of male sterility. Our cellular analysis suggested that OsLAP6/OsPKS1 might regulate pollen exine formation by affecting bacula elongation. Expression examination indicated that OsLAP6/OsPKS1 is specifically expressed in tapetum, and its product is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Protein sequence analysis indicated that OsLAP6/OsPKS1 is conserved in land plants.OsLAP6/OsPKS1 is a critical molecular switch for rice male fertility by participating in a conserved sporopollenin precursor biosynthetic pathway in land plants. Manipulation of OsLAP6/OsPKS1 has potential for application in hybrid rice breeding.
NA	OsPKS1 is required for sexine layer formation, which shows functional conservation between rice and Arabidopsis.	2018	Plant Sci	College of Life and Environment Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, 100 Guilin Road, Shanghai, 200234, China.	The sporopollenin precursors, as a general constituent of sexine, are synthesized in the tapetum and deposited on the pollen surface after transportation and processing. The polyketide synthase condenses the acyl-CoA into a hydroxyalkyl ¶¡-pyrone, which is predicted to be a component of the sporopollenin precursors. In this study, we found that the rice POLYKETIDE SYNTHASE 1 (OsPKS1) was the orthologue of Arabidopsis POLYKETIDE SYNTHASE A/LESS ADHESIVE POLLEN 6 (PKSA/LAP6) through sequence alignment. The OsPKS1 knockout mutants obtained by Crispr-Cas9-mediated editing exhibited a complete male sterile phenotype. Cytological observations revealed that abnormal bacula deposition and ubisch body structures for sexine formation led to pollen rupture in ospks1. The expression analysis showed that the OsPKS1 was highly expressed in tapetal cells and anther locules from stage 9 to stage 11 during anther development in rice. Subcellular localization demonstrated that the OsPKS1 protein was preferentially localized to the ER. The genomic sequence of OsPKS1 driven by the PKSA/LAP6 promoter restored the sexine pattern of Arabidopsis pksa/lap6. These results indicated that OsPKS1 is required for sexine layer formation in rice and functionally conserved in the sporopollenin synthesis pathway.
