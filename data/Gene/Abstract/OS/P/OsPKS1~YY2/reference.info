Hihara-1996-Isolation and charac.pdf	Isolation and characterization of two cDNA clones for mRNAs that are abundantly expressed in immature anthers of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	1996	Plant Mol Biol	Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo, Yayoi 1-1-1, 113, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan	The relationship between the length of anthers and the stage of development of microspores was examined in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Hayayuki). Anthers of ‚âêı<U+3E34>2 mm and 2.1‚Ä<U+393C><U+3E33>2.2 mm in length and those ready to dehiscence were determined to be at the uninucleate, binucleate and trinucleate microspore stage, respectively. Two cDNAs (YY1 and YY2), representing genes that are specifically expressed in anthers at the uninucleate microspore stage, were isolated and characterized. YY1 cDNA encoded an open reading frame of 95 amino acids. Eight cysteine residues with the potential to form disulfide bridges were present in the amino acid sequence. There was a hydrophobic region at the N-terminus of the putative protein, suggesting that the YY1 protein might be secreted. This cysteine motif and the hydrophobic N-terminus are conserved among products of several anther-specific genes or cDNAs isolated from various plant species. These proteins are thought to form a superfamily of proteins that are confined to anthers. The YY1 transcript was localized in the tapetal cells and the peripheral cells of the vascular bundle. YY2 cDNA encoded an open reading frame of 389 amino acids and the deduced amino acid sequence exhibited substantial homology to that of chalcone synthase. Expression of YY2 mRNA was confined to the tapetal cells. The genes correspond to YY1 and YY2 cDNAs were shown to exist as single copies in the rice genome.
Mol. Plant-2008-Zhang-599-610.pdf	Tapetum degeneration retardation is critical for aliphatic metabolism and gene regulation during rice pollen development	2008	Mol Plant	Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, China.	As a complex wall system in flowering plants, the pollen outer wall mainly contains aliphatic sporopollenin; however, the mechanism for synthesizing these lipidic precursors during pollen development remains less well understood. Here, we report on the function of the rice tapetum-expressing TDR (Tapetum Degeneration Retardation) gene in aliphatic metabolism and its regulatory role during rice pollen development. The observations of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses suggested that pollen wall formation was significantly altered in the tdr mutant. The contents of aliphatic compositions of anther were greatly changed in the tdr mutant revealed by GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) testing, particularly less accumulated in fatty acids, primary alcohols, alkanes and alkenes, and an abnormal increase in secondary alcohols with carbon lengths from C29 to C35 in tdr. Microarray data revealed that a group of genes putatively involved in lipid transport and metabolism were significantly altered in the tdr mutant, indicating the critical role of TDR in the formation of the pollen wall. Also, a wide range of genes (236 in total-154 up-regulated and 82 down-regulated) exhibited statistically significant expressional differences between wild-type and tdr. In addition to its function in promoting tapetum PCD, TDR possibly plays crucial regulatory roles in several basic biological processes during rice pollen development.
Wang-2013-Conserved metabolic.pdf	Conserved metabolic steps for sporopollenin precursor formation in tobacco and rice	2013	Physiol Plant	School of Biological Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.	The development of pollen wall with proper sporopollenin deposition is essential for pollen viability and male fertility in flowering plants. Sporopollenin is a complex biopolymer synthesized from fatty acid and phenolic derivatives. Recent investigations in Arabidopsis have identified a number of anther-specific genes involved in the production of fatty-acyl monomers potentially required for exine formation. The existence of ancient biochemical pathways for sporopollenin biosynthesis has been widely proposed but experimental evidence from plant species other than Arabidopsis is not extensively available. Here, we investigated the metabolic steps catalyzed by the anther-specific acyl-CoA synthetase (ACOS), polyketide synthase (PKS) and tetraketide alpha-pyrone reductase (TKPR). Using fatty acids as starting substrates, sequential activities of heterologously expressed tobacco enzymes NtACOS1, NtPKS1 and NtTKPR1 resulted in the production of reduced tetraketide alpha-pyrones. Transgenic RNA interference lines were then generated for the different tobacco genes which were demonstrated to be indispensable for normal pollen development and male fertility. Similarly, recombinant rice OsPKS1 and OsTKPR1 were shown to function as downstream enzymes of NtACOS1. In addition, insertion mutant lines for these rice genes displayed different levels of impaired pollen and seed formation. Taken together, reduced tetraketide alpha-pyrones appear to represent common sporopollenin fatty-acyl precursors essential for male fertility in taxonomically distinct plant species.
