OsPHR2	 AtPHR1 in Arabidopsis and OsPHR2 in rice are central regulators of Pi signaling, which regulates the expression of phosphate starvation-induced (PSI) genes by binding to the P1BS elements in the promoter of PSI genes
OsPHR2	 Molecular analyses and infection studies using OsPHR2-Ov1 and phr2 mutants further demonstrated that OsPHR2 enhances antibacterial resistance via transcriptional regulation of OsMYC2 expression, indicating a positive role of OsPHR2-OsMYC2 crosstalk in modulating the OsMYC2 signaling and Xoo infection
OsPHR2	Transgenic expression of rice OsPHR2 increases phosphorus uptake and yield in wheat. |  From the jointing to filling stage, OsPHR2 was mainly expressed in the roots, followed by the leaves, with a low expression level in detected the tassels and stems |  Analysis of the root characteristics showed that the transgenic expression of OsPHR2 increased the maximum root length, total root length, root-to-shoot ratio, and root volume under the conditions of P deficiency or low P |  Thus, the transgenic expression of OsPHR2 could increase P uptake and yield in wheat, but the effect was more prominent under low P conditions
