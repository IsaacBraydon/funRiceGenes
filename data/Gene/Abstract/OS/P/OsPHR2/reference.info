Plants have evolved adaptive regulatory mechanisms to maintain phosphate (Pi) homeostasis by improving phosphorus uptake, translocation, remobilization and efficiency of use. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of the OsPHR2-mediated phosphate-signaling pathway in rice. OsPHR2 positively regulates the low-affinity Pi transporter OsPT2 through physical interaction and reciprocal regulation of OsPHO2 in roots. OsPT2 is responsible for most of the OsPHR2-mediated accumulation of excess Pi in shoots. OsSPX1 acts as a repressor in the OsPHR2-mediated phosphate-signaling pathway. Some mutants screened from ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized M2 population of OsPHR2 overexpression transgenic line removed the growth inhibition, indicating that some unknown factors are crucial for Pi utilization or plant growth under the regulation of OsPHR2.
79956712.pdf	Overexpression of OsPAP10a, a root-associated acid phosphatase, increased extracellular organic phosphorus utilization in rice	2012	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Phosphorus (P) deficiency is a major limitation for plant growth and development. Among the wide set of responses to cope with low soil P, plants increase their level of intracellular and secreted acid phosphatases (APases), which helps to catalyze inorganic phosphate (Pi) hydrolysis from organo-phosphates. In this study we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) purple acid phosphatase 10a (OsPAP10a). OsPAP10a belongs to group Ia of purple acid phosphatases (PAPs), and clusters with the principal secreted PAPs in a variety of plant species including Arabidopsis. The transcript abundance of OsPAP10a is specifically induced by Pi deficiency and is controlled by OsPHR2, the central transcription factor controlling Pi homeostasis. In gel activity assays of root and shoot protein extracts, it was revealed that OsPAP10a is a major acid phosphatase isoform induced by Pi starvation. Constitutive overexpression of OsPAP10a results in a significant increase of phosphatase activity in both shoot and root protein extracts. In vivo root 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (BCIP) assays and activity measurements on external media showed that OsPAP10a is a root-associated APase. Furthermore, overexpression of OsPAP10a significantly improved ATP hydrolysis and utilization compared with wild type plants. These results indicate that OsPAP10a can potentially be used for crop breeding to improve the efficiency of P use.
9fcfd50a105b36339e.pdf	OsSPX1 suppresses the function of OsPHR2 in the regulation of expression of OsPT2 and phosphate homeostasis in shoots of rice	2010	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in plants is required for plant growth and development, and is achieved by the coordination of Pi acquisition, translocation from roots to shoots, and remobilization within plants. Previous reports have demonstrated that over-expression of OsPHR2 (the homolog of AtPHR1) and knockdown of OsSPX1 result in accumulation of excessive shoot Pi in rice. Here we report that OsPHR2 positively regulates the low-affinity Pi transporter gene OsPT2 by physical interaction and upstream regulation of OsPHO2 in roots. OsPT2 is responsible for most of the OsPHR2-mediated accumulation of excess shoot Pi. OsSPX1 suppresses the regulation on expression of OsPT2 by OsPHR2 and the accumulation of excess shoot Pi, but it does not suppress induction of OsPT2 or the accumulation of excessive shoot Pi in the Ospho2 mutant. Our data also show that OsSPX1 is a negative regulator of OsPHR2 and is involved in the feedback of Pi-signaling network in roots that is defined by OsPHR2 and OsPHO2. This finding provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism of Pi uptake, translocation, allocation and homeostasis in plants.
Chen-2011-OsPHF1 regulates the.pdf	OsPHF1 regulates the plasma membrane localization of low- and high-affinity inorganic phosphate transporters and determines inorganic phosphate uptake and translocation in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, People's Republic of China.	PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 (PHF1) is known to regulate the plasma membrane localization of PHT1;1, a high-affinity inorganic phosphate (Pi) transporter in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). OsPHF1, a rice (Oryza sativa) gene homologous to AtPHF1, was isolated and found to regulate the localization of both low- and high-affinity Pi transporters to the plasma membrane. Three OsPHF1 allelic mutants carrying one-point mutations at the fifth WD-repeat motif and two at the transmembrane helix, respectively, showed arsenate resistance and severely reduced Pi accumulation. The data indicate that mutation of OsPHF1 results in the endoplasmic reticulum retention of the low-affinity Pi transporter OsPT2 and high-affinity Pi transporter OsPT8. Mutation of OsPHF1 also reduced Pi accumulation in plants exhibiting excessive shoot Pi accumulation due to the overexpression of OsPHR2. However, the transcript level of OsPHF1 itself is not controlled by OsPHR2. Overexpression of OsPHF1 increased Pi accumulation in both roots and shoots in a solution culture with Pi-supplied condition. These results indicate that the role of OsPHF1 is unique in the localization of both low- and high-affinity Pi transporters on the plasma membrane in rice and determines Pi uptake and translocation in rice. The similar function of PHF1 required to facilitate PHT1 transit through the endoplasmic reticulum between Arabidopsis and rice provides an example of expectations from what one would deduce from sequence comparisons to extend knowledge from Arabidopsis to crops.
j.1365-313X.2008.03734.x.pdf	Involvement of OsSPX1 in phosphate homeostasis in rice	2009	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Arabidopsis thaliana SPX (SYG/PHO81/XPR1) domain genes have recently been shown to be involved in the phosphate (Pi) signaling pathway. We show here that a rice (Oryza sativa) SPX gene, OsSPX1, is specifically induced by Pi starvation in roots. Suppression of OsSPX1 by RNA interference resulted in severe signs of toxicity caused by the over-accumulation of Pi, similar to that found in OsPHR2 (phosphate starvation response transcription factor 2) overexpressors and pho2 (phosphate-responsive mutant 2). Quantitative RT-PCR showed that expression of OsSPX1 was strongly induced in OsPHR2 overexpression and pho2 mutant plants, indicating that OsSPX1 occurs downstream of OsPHR2 and PHO2. The expression of 10 genes associated with the phosphate-starvation signal pathways was analyzed. Expression of OsPT2 (phosphate transporter 2) and OsPT8 was significantly induced in OsSPX1-RNAi (OsSPX1-Ri) plants, suggesting that over-accumulation of Pi in OsSPX1-Ri plants results from an increase in Pi transport. In contrast, overexpression of OsSPX1 suppressed the induction of expression by Pi starvation of all 10 phosphate starvation-induced genes tested: IPS1 (induced by phosphate starvation 1), IPS2, OsPAP10 (purple acid phosphatase 10), OsSQD2 (sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2), miR399d and miR399j (microRNA 399), OsPT2, OsPT3, OsPT6 and OsPT8. This suggests that OsSPX1 acts via a negative feedback loop to optimize growth under phosphate-limited conditions.
pce12001.pdf	OsARF16, a transcription factor, is required for auxin and phosphate starvation response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2013	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Plant responses to auxin and phosphate (Pi) starvation are closely linked. However, the underlying mechanisms connecting auxin to phosphate starvation (-Pi) responses are largely unclear. Here, we show that OsARF16, an auxin response factor, functions in both auxin and -Pi responses in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The knockout of OsARF16 led to primary roots (PR), lateral roots (LR) and root hair losing sensitivity to auxin and -Pi response. OsARF16 expression and OsARF16::GUS staining in PR and LR of rice Nipponbare (NIP) were induced by indole acetic acid and -Pi treatments. In -Pi conditions, the shoot biomass of osarf16 was slightly reduced, and neither root growth nor iron content was induced, indicating that the knockout of OsARF16 led to loss of response to Pi deficiency in rice. Six phosphate starvation-induced genes (PSIs) were less induced by -Pi in osarf16 and these trends were similar to a knockdown mutant of OsPHR2 or AtPHR1, which was a key regulator under -Pi. These data first reveal the biological function of OsARF16, provide novel evidence of a linkage between auxin and -Pi responses and facilitate the development of new strategies for the efficient utilization of Pi in rice.
Plant Physiol.-2008-Zhou-1673-86.pdf	OsPHR2 is involved in phosphate-starvation signaling and excessive phosphate accumulation in shoots of plants	2008	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Previous research has demonstrated that AtPHR1 plays a central role in phosphate (Pi)-starvation signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this work, two OsPHR genes from rice (Oryza sativa) were isolated and designated as OsPHR1 and OsPHR2 based on amino acid sequence homology to AtPHR1. Their functions in Pi signaling in rice were investigated using transgenic plants. Our results showed that both OsPHR1 and OsPHR2 are involved in Pi-starvation signaling pathway by regulation of the expression of Pi-starvation-induced genes, whereas only OsPHR2 overexpression results in the excessive accumulation of Pi in shoots under Pi-sufficient conditions. Under Pi-sufficient conditions, overexpression of OsPHR2 mimics Pi-starvation stress in rice with enhanced root elongation and proliferated root hair growth, suggesting the involvement of OsPHR2 in Pi-dependent root architecture alteration by both systematic and local pathways. In OsPHR2-overexpression plants, some Pi transporters were up-regulated under Pi-sufficient conditions, which correlates with the strongly increased content of Pi. The mechanism behind the OsPHR2 regulated Pi accumulation will provide useful approaches to develop smart plants with high Pi efficiency.
Plant Physiol.-2011-Wu-498-508.pdf	Investigating the contribution of the phosphate transport pathway to arsenic accumulation in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Arsenic (As) accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa) may pose a significant health risk to consumers. Plants take up different As species using various pathways. Here, we investigated the contribution of the phosphate (Pi) transport pathway to As accumulation in rice grown hydroponically or under flooded soil conditions. In hydroponic experiments, a rice mutant defective in OsPHF1 (for phosphate transporter traffic facilitator1) lost much of the ability to take up Pi and arsenate and to transport them from roots to shoots, whereas transgenic rice overexpressing either the Pi transporter OsPht1;8 (OsPT8) or the transcription factor OsPHR2 (for phosphate starvation response2) had enhanced abilities of Pi and arsenate uptake and translocation. OsPT8 was found to have a high affinity for both Pi and arsenate, and its overexpression increased the maximum influx by 3- to 5-fold. In arsenate-treated plants, both arsenate and arsenite were detected in the xylem sap, with the proportion of the latter increasing with the exposure time. Under the flooded soil conditions, the phf1 mutant took up less Pi whereas the overexpression lines took up more Pi. But there were no similar effects on As accumulation and distribution. Rice grain contained predominantly dimethylarsinic acid and arsenite, with arsenate being a minor species. These results suggest that the Pi transport pathway contributed little to As uptake and transport to grain in rice plants grown in flooded soil. Transgenic approaches to enhance Pi acquisition from paddy soil through the overexpression of Pi transporters may not increase As accumulation in rice grain.
psb0309_0674.pdf	Role of OsPHR2 on phosphorus homeostasis and root hairs development in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2008	Plant Signal Behav	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry; College of Life Science; Zhejiang University; Hangzhou, P. R. China.	AtPHR1 plays a central role in Pi-starvation signaling in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Two PHR genes were isolated from rice and designated as OsPHR1 and OsPHR2 based on amino acid sequence homology to AtPHR1. Transgenic plants with overexpression and repression of OsPHR1 and OsPHR2, respectively, were used for investigation of roles of the genes in Pi-signaling pathway and Pi homeostasis under Pi-sufficient and deficient conditions. The results showed that both of the genes are involved in the Pi-signaling pathway, while overexpression of OsPHR2 mimics Pi-starvation stress with enhanced root elongation and proliferated root hairs, and results in the excessive accumulation of Pi in shoots under Pi-sufficient conditions. OsPHR2 regulated proliferation of root hair growth and root elongation suggests that OsPHR2 is involved in both systematic and local Pi-signaling pathways.
NA	Rice SPX1 and SPX2 inhibit phosphate starvation responses through interacting with PHR2 in a phosphate-dependent manner	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China	In plants, sensing the levels of external and internal nutrients is essential for reprogramming the transcriptome and adapting to the fluctuating environment. Phosphate (Pi) is a key plant nutrient, and a large proportion of Pi starvation-responsive genes are under the control of PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE REGULATOR 1 (PHR1) in Arabidopsis (AtPHR1) and its homologs, such as Oryza sativa (Os)PHR2 in rice. AtPHR1 and OsPHR2 expression is not very responsive to Pi starvation, raising the question as to how plants sense changes in cellular Pi levels to activate the central regulator. SPX [named after SYG1 (suppressor of yeast gpa1), Pho81 (CDK inhibitor in yeast PHO pathway), and XPR1 (xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor)] proteins that harbor only the SPX domain are reported to be involved in the negative regulation of Pi starvation responses. Here, we show that the nuclear localized SPX proteins SPX1 and SPX2 are Pi-dependent inhibitors of the activity of OsPHR2 in rice. Indeed, SPX1 and SPX2 proteins interact with PHR2 through their SPX domain, inhibiting its binding to P1BS (the PHR1-binding sequence: GNATATNC). In vivo data, as well as results from in vitro experiments using purified SPX1, SPX2, and OsPHR2 proteins, showed that SPX1 and SPX2 inhibition of OsPHR2 activity is Pi-dependent. These data provide evidence to support the involvement of SPX1 and SPX2 in the Pi-sensing mechanism in plants.
NA	SPX proteins regulate Pi homeostasis and signaling in different subcellular level.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	a State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University , Hangzhou 310058 , China.	To cope with low phosphate (Pi) availability, plants have to adjust its gene expression profile to facilitate Pi acquisition and remobilization. Sensing the levels of Pi is essential for reprogramming the gene expression profile to adapt to the fluctuating Pi environment. AtPHR1 in Arabidopsis and OsPHR2 in rice are central regulators of Pi signaling, which regulates the expression of phosphate starvation-induced (PSI) genes by binding to the P1BS elements in the promoter of PSI genes. However, how the Pi level affects the central regulator to regulate the PSI genes have puzzled us for a decade. Recent progress in SPX proteins indicated that the SPX proteins play important role in regulating the activity of central regulator AtPHR1/OsPHR2 in a Pi dependent manner at different subcellular levels.
NA	Modulation of nitrate-induced phosphate response by the MYB transcription factor RLI1/HINGE1 in the nucleus	2020	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, the Innovative Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China.	The coordinated utilization of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) is vital for plants to maintain nutrient balance and achieve optimal growth. Previously, we revealed a mechanism by which nitrate induces genes for phosphate utilization; this mechanism depends on NRT1.1B-facilitated degradation of cytoplasmic SPX4, which in turn promotes cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of PHR2, the central transcription factor of phosphate signaling, and triggers the nitrate-induced phosphate response (NIPR) and N-P coordinated utilization in rice. In this study, we unveiled a fine-tuning mechanism of NIPR in the nucleus regulated by Highly Induced by Nitrate Gene 1 (HINGE1, also known as RLI1), a MYB-transcription factor closely related to PHR2. RLI1/HINGE1, which is transcriptionally activated by PHR2 under nitrate induction, can directly activate the expression of phosphate starvation-induced genes. More importantly, RLI1/HINGE1 competes with PHR2 for binding to its repressor proteins in the nucleus (SPX proteins), and consequently releases PHR2 to further enhance phosphate response. Therefore, RLI1/HINGE1 amplifies the phosphate response in the nucleus downstream of the cytoplasmic SPX4-PHR2 cascade, thereby enabling fine-tuning of N-P balance when nitrate supply is sufficient.
NA	Phosphate-Starvation-Inducible S-Like RNase Genes in Rice Are Involved in Phosphate Source Recycling by RNA Decay	2020	Front Plant Sci	Graduate School of Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, South Korea.	The fine-tuning of inorganic phosphate (Pi) for enhanced use efficiency has long been a challenging subject in agriculture, particularly in regard to rice as a major crop plant. Among ribonucleases (RNases), the RNase T2 family is broadly distributed across kingdoms, but little has been known on its substrate specificity compared to RNase A and RNase T1 families. Class I and class II of the RNase T2 family are defined as the S-like RNase (RNS) family and have showed the connection to Pi recycling in Arabidopsis. In this study, we first carried out a phylogenetic analysis of eight rice and five Arabidopsis RNS genes and identified mono-specific class I and dicot-specific class I RNS genes, suggesting the possibility of functional diversity between class I RNS family members in monocot and dicot species through evolution. We then compared the in silico expression patterns of all RNS genes in rice and Arabidopsis under normal and Pi-deficient conditions and further confirmed the expression patterns of rice RNS genes via qRT-PCR analysis. Subsequently, we found that most of the OsRNS genes were differentially regulated under Pi-deficient treatment. Association of Pi recycling by RNase activity in rice was confirmed by measuring total RNA concentration and ribonuclease activity of shoot and root samples under Pi-sufficient or Pi-deficient treatment during 21 days. The total RNA concentrations were decreased by < 60% in shoots and < 80% in roots under Pi starvation, respectively, while ribonuclease activity increased correspondingly. We further elucidate the signaling pathway of Pi starvation through upregulation of the OsRNS genes. The 2-kb promoter region of all OsRNS genes with inducible expression patterns under Pi deficiency contains a high frequency of P1BS cis-acting regulatory element (CRE) known as the OsPHR2 binding site, suggesting that the OsRNS family is likely to be controlled by OsPHR2. Finally, the dynamic transcriptional regulation of OsRNS genes by overexpression of OsPHR2, ospho2 mutant, and overexpression of OsPT1 lines involved in Pi signaling pathway suggests the molecular basis of OsRNS family in Pi recycling via RNA decay under Pi starvation.
NA	OsPHR2 modulates phosphate starvation-induced OsMYC2 signaling and resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae 	2021	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products, Institute of Virology and Biotechnology, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, China.	Phosphate (Pi) and MYC2-mediated jasmonate (JA) pathway play critical roles in plant growth and development. In particular, crosstalk between JA and Pi starvation signaling has been reported to mediate insect herbivory resistance in dicot plants. However, its roles and mechanism in monocot-bacterial defense systems remain obscure. Here, we report that Pi starvation in rice activates the OsMYC2 signaling and enhances resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) infection. The direct regulation of OsPHR2 on the OsMYC2 promoter was confirmed by yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift, dual-luciferase, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Molecular analyses and infection studies using OsPHR2-Ov1 and phr2 mutants further demonstrated that OsPHR2 enhances antibacterial resistance via transcriptional regulation of OsMYC2 expression, indicating a positive role of OsPHR2-OsMYC2 crosstalk in modulating the OsMYC2 signaling and Xoo infection. Genetic analysis and infection assays using myc2 mutants revealed that Pi starvation-induced OsMYC2 signaling activation and consequent Xoo resistance depends on the regulation of OsMYC2. Together, these results reveal a clear interlink between Pi starvation- and OsMYC2- signaling in monocot plants, and provide new insight into how plants balance growth and defense by integrating nutrient deficiency and phytohormone signaling.

NA	A reciprocal inhibitory interplay between phosphate and iron signaling in rice.	2021	Mol Plant	Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilizer, Ministry of Agriculture, Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Phosphorous (P) and iron (Fe) are two essential nutrients for plant growth and development and are highly abundant elements in the earth&#39;s crust but often display low availability to plants. Due to the ability to form insoluble complexes, the antagonistic interaction between P and Fe nutrition in plants has been noticed for decades. However, the underlying molecular mechanism modulating the signaling and homeostasis between them is still obscure. Here, we show that the possible iron sensors HRZs, iron deficiency induced E3 ligases, could interact with the central regulator for phosphate (Pi) signaling, PHR2, and prompt its ubiquitination at lysine residues K(319) and K(328), leading to its degradation in rice. Consistent with it, the hrzs mutants displayed a high Pi accumulation phenotype. We further demonstrated that iron deficiency could attenuate Pi starvation signaling by inducing the expression of HRZs, which in turn could trigger PHR2 protein degradation. We also found that PHRs could negatively regulate HRZs transcription to modulate iron deficiency responses. Therefore, PHR2 and HRZs form a reciprocal inhibition module to coordinate Pi and iron signaling and homeostasis in rice. Thus, our results uncover a molecular link between Pi and iron master regulators that enable adaptation to Pi and iron availability in plants.
NA	Transgenic expression of rice OsPHR2 increases phosphorus uptake and yield in wheat.	2022	Protoplasma	Key Laboratory of Wheat Germplasm Resources Innovation and Improvement in Henan Province, Key Laboratory for Wheat Biology of Henan Province, Institute of Crop Molecular Breeding, Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450002, People&#39;s Republic of China.	Oryza sativa PHOSPHATE RESPONSE2 (OsPHR2) can promote the uptake and use of phosphorus (P) in rice. We introduced OsPHR2 into the winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) variety &quot;Zhengmai0856.&quot; OsPHR2 was integrated into the wheat genome with two copy numbers and could be correctly transcribed and expressed. OsPHR2 was mainly expressed in the leaves at the seedling stage. From the jointing to filling stage, OsPHR2 was mainly expressed in the roots, followed by the leaves, with a low expression level in detected the tassels and stems. The transgenic lines exhibited higher P accumulation at each growth stage and increased P uptake intensity in comparison to the wild type under low P and high P conditions. Analysis of the root characteristics showed that the transgenic expression of OsPHR2 increased the maximum root length, total root length, root-to-shoot ratio, and root volume under the conditions of P deficiency or low P. A field experiment showed that the transgenic lines had a higher grain yield than the wild type under low P and high P conditions. The yield of the transgenic lines increased by 6.29% and 3.73% on average compared with the wild type under low P and high P conditions, respectively. Thus, the transgenic expression of OsPHR2 could increase P uptake and yield in wheat, but the effect was more prominent under low P conditions.
