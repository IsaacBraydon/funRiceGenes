BACKGROUND: The C2 domain is a Ca(2+)/phospholipid-binding motif found in many proteins involved in signal transduction or membrane trafficking. OsERG3 is a homolog of OsERG1, a gene encoding a small C2-domain protein in rice. METHODS: OsERG3 Ca(2+)-binding and phospholipid-binding assays were carried out using (3)H-labeled phospholipid liposomes and a (45)Ca(2+) overlay assay, respectively. Cytosolic expression of OsERG3 was investigated by Western blot analysis and the OsERG3::smGFP transient expression assay. RESULTS: OsERG3 transcript levels were greatly enhanced by treatment with a fungal elicitor and Ca(2+)-ionophore. OsERG3 protein proved unable to interact with phospholipids regardless of the presence or absence of Ca(2+) ions. Nonetheless, OsERG3 displayed calcium-binding activity in an in vitro(45)Ca(2+)-binding assay, a property not observed with OsERG1. The cytosolic location of OsERG3 was not altered by the presence of fungal elicitor or Ca(2+)-ionophore. CONCLUSIONS: OsERG3 encodes a small C2-domain protein consisting of a single C2 domain. OsERG3 binds Ca(2+) ions but not phospholipids. OsERG3 is a cytosolic soluble protein. The OsERG3 gene may play a role in signaling pathway involving Ca(2+) ions. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The data demonstrate that OsERG3 is an unusual small C2-domain protein containing a Ca(2+)-binding module but lacking phospholipid-binding properties.
Plant Cell Physiol-2002-Asano-668-74.pdf	Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a Common Origin, have Different Protein Characteristics but Both Genes are Predominantly Expressed in Rice Phloem Tissues	2002	Plant and Cell Physiology	Genetic Diversity Department, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602 Japan	The genes for two types of rice phloem protein (RPP16 and RPP17) were isolated and characterized. Conservation of five exon sizes as well as splicing positions between the two genes suggest that either RPP16 or RPP17 is a resultant of gene duplication. By protein blot analysis, RPP16 and RPP17 proteins were specifically detected in soluble and insoluble fractions of a crude extract of rice plants, respectively, suggesting that these proteins play different roles in individual cells. The expression of Rpp16 and Rpp17 was monitored by the Î²-glucuronidase (gusA) reporter-gene method. Rpp16-gusA and Rpp17-gusA were expressed preferentially in the phloem tissues from different parts of the plant, but almost no GUS staining was observed in the rest of the tissues. In roots of both constructs, interestingly, stronger GUS-accumulation was detected in younger vascular tissues than in aged vascular tissues. In situ hybridization also showed that Rpp17 was more strongly expressed in vascular tissues of tiller buds. These results suggest that transcript of these genes was more abundant in young tissues. The presence of two copies of the gene in higher plants, from a common origin, which have different protein characteristics, indicates that evolutionary diversification might have occurred in the gene function.
yangwq.pdf	A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice	2008	Mol Plant	National Centre for Plant Gene Research, Beijing 100190, China.	Pollen fertility is a crucial factor for successful pollination and essential for seed formation. Recent studies have suggested that a diverse range of internal and external factors, signaling components and their related pathways are likely involved in pollen fertility. Here, we report a single C2-domain containing protein, OsPBP1, initially identified through cDNA microarray analysis. OsPBP1 is a single copy gene and preferentially expressed in pistil and pollen but down-regulated by pollination. OsPBP1 had a calcium concentration-dependent phospholipid-binding activity and was localized mainly in cytoplasm and nucleus, but translocated onto the plasma membrane in response to an intracellular Ca(2+) increase. Pollen grains of antisense OsPBP1 transgenic lines were largely nonviable, germinated poorly in vitro and of low fertility. OsPBP1 protein was localized in a region peripheral to pollen wall and vesicles of elongating pollen tube, and its repressed expression reduced substantially this association and led to alteration of microfilament polymerization during pollen germination. Taken together, these results indicate that OsPBP1 is a novel functional C2-domain phospholipids-binding protein that is required for pollen fertility likely by regulating Ca(2+) and phospholipid signaling pathways.
