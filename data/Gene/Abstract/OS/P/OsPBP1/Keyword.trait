Rpp16|OsPBP1	pollen	A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice	 OsPBP1 is a single copy gene and preferentially expressed in pistil and pollen but down-regulated by pollination| Pollen grains of antisense OsPBP1 transgenic lines were largely nonviable, germinated poorly in vitro and of low fertility| OsPBP1 protein was localized in a region peripheral to pollen wall and vesicles of elongating pollen tube, and its repressed expression reduced substantially this association and led to alteration of microfilament polymerization during pollen germination| Taken together, these results indicate that OsPBP1 is a novel functional C2-domain phospholipids-binding protein that is required for pollen fertility likely by regulating Ca(2+) and phospholipid signaling pathways|A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice
