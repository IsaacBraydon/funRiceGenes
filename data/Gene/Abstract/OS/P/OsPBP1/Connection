Rpp16|OsPBP1	Rpp17	Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a Common Origin, have Different Protein Characteristics but Both Genes are Predominantly Expressed in Rice Phloem Tissues	The genes for two types of rice phloem protein (RPP16 and RPP17) were isolated and characterized| Conservation of five exon sizes as well as splicing positions between the two genes suggest that either RPP16 or RPP17 is a resultant of gene duplication| By protein blot analysis, RPP16 and RPP17 proteins were specifically detected in soluble and insoluble fractions of a crude extract of rice plants, respectively, suggesting that these proteins play different roles in individual cells| The expression of Rpp16 and Rpp17 was monitored by the Î²-glucuronidase (gusA) reporter-gene method| Rpp16-gusA and Rpp17-gusA were expressed preferentially in the phloem tissues from different parts of the plant, but almost no GUS staining was observed in the rest of the tissues|Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a Common Origin, have Different Protein Characteristics but Both Genes are Predominantly Expressed in Rice Phloem Tissues
