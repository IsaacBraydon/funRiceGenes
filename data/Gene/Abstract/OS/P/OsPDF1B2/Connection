OsPDF1A	OsPDF1B2	Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts.	 Rice contains three copies (OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B and OsPDF1B2) of the PDF genes
OsPDF1A	OsPDF1B2	Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts.	 Unlike OsPDF1A and OsPDF1B, OsPDF1B2 is apparently non-functional, with several deleterious substitutions and deletions
