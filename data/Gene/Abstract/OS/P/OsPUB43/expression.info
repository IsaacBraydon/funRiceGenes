OsPUB43	 Phenotypes of large grain are observed in ospub43 mutants, whereas overexpression of OsPUB43 results in short grains |  Furthermore, the transient transcriptional activity assay shows that OsBZR1 can activate the expression of OsPUB43 |  Collectively, our results indicate that OsPUB43 negatively controls the gain size by modulating the expression of BR-responsive genes as well as MADS-box genes that are required for lemma/palea specification, suggesting that OsPUB43 has a potential valuable application in the enlargement of grain size in rice	 Phenotypes of large grain are observed in ospub43 mutants, whereas overexpression of OsPUB43 results in short grains
