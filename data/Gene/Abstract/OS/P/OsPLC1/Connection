GF14b|OsGF14b	OsPLC1	A 14-3-3 protein positively regulates rice salt tolerance by stabilizing phospholipase C1.	 Here, we identified a 14-3-3 protein, OsGF14b, as an interaction partner of OsPLC1
GF14b|OsGF14b	OsPLC1	A 14-3-3 protein positively regulates rice salt tolerance by stabilizing phospholipase C1.	 Similar to OsPLC1, OsGF14b also positively regulates rice salt tolerance, and their interaction can be promoted by NaCl stress
GF14b|OsGF14b	OsPLC1	A 14-3-3 protein positively regulates rice salt tolerance by stabilizing phospholipase C1.	 OsGF14b also positively regulated the hydrolysis activity of OsPLC1, and is essential to NaCl-induced activation of rice PI-PLCs
GF14b|OsGF14b	OsPLC1	A 14-3-3 protein positively regulates rice salt tolerance by stabilizing phospholipase C1.	 We further discovered that OsPLC1 was degraded via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and OsGF14b could inhibit the ubiquitination of OsPLC1 to protect OsPLC1 from degradation
GF14b|OsGF14b	OsPLC1	A 14-3-3 protein positively regulates rice salt tolerance by stabilizing phospholipase C1.	 Under salt stress, the OsPLC1 protein level in osgf14b was lower than the corresponding value of WT, whereas overexpression of OsGF14b results in a significant increase of OsPLC1 stability
GF14b|OsGF14b	OsPLC1	A 14-3-3 protein positively regulates rice salt tolerance by stabilizing phospholipase C1.	 Taken together, we propose that OsGF14b can interact with OsPLC1 and promote its activity and stability, thereby improving rice salt tolerance
