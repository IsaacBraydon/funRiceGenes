OsPLC1	Preferential expression of OsPLC1 is detected at the heading stage of rice, OsPLC1 overexpression results in early flowering, increased-grain size and yield; however, opposing phenotypes produced in the osplc1 mutants |  Here, we report that OsPLC1 expression could be detectable in various tissues throughout the developmental stages of rice, and the highest expression level of OsPLC1 was detected at the heading stage |  OsPLC1 overexpression (OE) produced rice plants with early flowering, whereas OsPLC1 loss-of-function led to delay in flowering |  The expression levels of subset genes, which are involved in the control of flowering time in rice, were altered in the plants of OE and osplc1 |  The increase in the grain size and the grain yield of OE lines were associated with the improvement of cell length and expression levels of a set of genes related to cell expansion, contrarily, the decrease in osplc1 mutant grain size and yield were linked to declined cell length and expression levels of related genes	Preferential expression of OsPLC1 is detected at the heading stage of rice, OsPLC1 overexpression results in early flowering, increased-grain size and yield; however, opposing phenotypes produced in the osplc1 mutants |  OsPLC1 overexpression (OE) produced rice plants with early flowering, whereas OsPLC1 loss-of-function led to delay in flowering
