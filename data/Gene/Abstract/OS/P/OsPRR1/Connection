Hd1	OsPRR1	An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15	Flowering genes downstream of OsPRR1 such as OsGI and Hd1 were down regulated in the A654 mutant
Hd1	OsPRR1	An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15	Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and Hd1 by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 and thus induce late flowering

OsPIL15	OsPRR1	An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15	In addition, OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 colocalize with OsPRR1, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis APRR1 gene that controls photoperiodic flowering response through clock function

OsPIL11	OsPRR1	Characterization of a Set of Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like bHLH Proteins inOryza sativa	Some of them (OsPIL11, OsPIL12, and OsPIL13) showed the ability to interact with the putative OsPRR1 (PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 1) clock component, as far as the results of yeast two-hybrid assays were concerned

Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	OsPRR1	OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering	Our results suggest OsELF3-1 can affect rice circadian systems via positive regulation of OsLHY expression and negative regulation of OsPRR1, OsPRR37, OsPRR73 and OsPRR95 expression
OsLHY	OsPRR1	The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution	However, this glutamate is critical for the control of the OsPRR1 gene (a rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis TOC1/PRR1 gene) by OsLHY for regulation of the circadian clock
