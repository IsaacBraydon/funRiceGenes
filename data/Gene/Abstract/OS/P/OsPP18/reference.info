NA	A SNAC1-regulated protein phosphatase gene OsPP18 modulates drought and oxidative stress tolerance through ABA-independent reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice	2014	Plant Physiol	Huazhong Agricultural University	Plants respond to abiotic stresses through a complexity of signaling pathways, and the dephosphorylation mediated by protein phosphatase is an important event in this process. We identified a rice protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) gene, OsPP18, as a STRESS-RESPOSIVE NAC1 (SNAC1)-regulated downstream gene. The ospp18 mutant was more sensitive than wild-type plants to drought stress at both the seedling and panicle development stages. Rice plants with OsPP18-suppresed via artificial microRNA were also hypersensitive to drought stress. Microarray analysis of the mutant revealed that genes encoding reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes were down-regulated in the ospp18 mutant, and the mutant exhibited reduced activities of ROS-scavenging enzymes and increased sensitivity to oxidative stresses. Over-expression of OsPP18 in rice led to enhanced osmotic and oxidative stress tolerance. The expression of OsPP18 was induced by drought stress, but not induced by abscisic acid. Although OsPP18 is a typical PP2C with enzymatic activity, it did not interact with SnRK2 protein kinases which function in ABA signaling. Meanwhile, the expression of ABA-responsive genes was not affected in the ospp18 mutant, and the ABA sensitivity of the ospp18 mutant and OsPP18-over-expressing plants was not altered either. Together, these findings suggest that OsPP18 is a novel PP2C gene which is regulated by SNAC1 and confers drought and oxidative stress resistance by regulating ROS homeostasis through ABA-independent pathways.
