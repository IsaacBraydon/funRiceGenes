OsPP18	The expression of OsPP18 was induced by drought stress, but not induced by abscisic acid.	Over-expression of OsPP18 in rice led to enhanced osmotic and oxidative stress tolerance. 	The ospp18 mutant was more sensitive than wild-type plants to drought stress at both the seedling and panicle development stages. Rice plants with OsPP18-suppresed via artificial microRNA were also hypersensitive to drought stress.
