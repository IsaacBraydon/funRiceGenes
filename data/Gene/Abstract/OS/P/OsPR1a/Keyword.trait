OsPR1a	 sa 	A novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) acidic PR1 gene highly responsive to cut, phytohormones, and protein phosphatase inhibitors	 SA and abscisic acid blocked JA-induced OsPR1a transcript
OsPR1a	jasmonic acid	A novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) acidic PR1 gene highly responsive to cut, phytohormones, and protein phosphatase inhibitors	A novel rice acidic pathogenesis-related (PR) class 1 cDNA (OsPR1a) was isolated from jasmonic acid (JA)-treated rice seedling leaf
OsPR1a	jasmonic	A novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) acidic PR1 gene highly responsive to cut, phytohormones, and protein phosphatase inhibitors	A novel rice acidic pathogenesis-related (PR) class 1 cDNA (OsPR1a) was isolated from jasmonic acid (JA)-treated rice seedling leaf
OsPR1a	phytohormone	A novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) acidic PR1 gene highly responsive to cut, phytohormones, and protein phosphatase inhibitors	 The OsPR1a gene was found to be cut-inducible, whereas the phytohormones JA, salicylic acid (SA), 3-indoleacetic acid, gibberellin, and ethylene (using ethylene generator ethephon, ET) enhanced accumulation of OsPR1a transcript, as well as the protein phosphatase inhibitors cantharidin (CN) and endothall (EN)
OsPR1a	phytohormone	A novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) acidic PR1 gene highly responsive to cut, phytohormones, and protein phosphatase inhibitors	 This is the first report on cloning of a rice acidic PR1 gene (OsPR1a), which is regulated by phytohormones, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation event(s), and light
OsPR1a	 pi 	A novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) acidic PR1 gene highly responsive to cut, phytohormones, and protein phosphatase inhibitors	 The OsPR1a cDNA is 830 bp long and contains an open reading frame of 507 nucleotides encoding 168 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 17,560 and pI of 4
OsPR1a	ethylene	A novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) acidic PR1 gene highly responsive to cut, phytohormones, and protein phosphatase inhibitors	 The OsPR1a gene was found to be cut-inducible, whereas the phytohormones JA, salicylic acid (SA), 3-indoleacetic acid, gibberellin, and ethylene (using ethylene generator ethephon, ET) enhanced accumulation of OsPR1a transcript, as well as the protein phosphatase inhibitors cantharidin (CN) and endothall (EN)
OsPR1a	salicylic acid	A novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) acidic PR1 gene highly responsive to cut, phytohormones, and protein phosphatase inhibitors	 The OsPR1a gene was found to be cut-inducible, whereas the phytohormones JA, salicylic acid (SA), 3-indoleacetic acid, gibberellin, and ethylene (using ethylene generator ethephon, ET) enhanced accumulation of OsPR1a transcript, as well as the protein phosphatase inhibitors cantharidin (CN) and endothall (EN)
OsPR1a	gibberellin	A novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) acidic PR1 gene highly responsive to cut, phytohormones, and protein phosphatase inhibitors	 The OsPR1a gene was found to be cut-inducible, whereas the phytohormones JA, salicylic acid (SA), 3-indoleacetic acid, gibberellin, and ethylene (using ethylene generator ethephon, ET) enhanced accumulation of OsPR1a transcript, as well as the protein phosphatase inhibitors cantharidin (CN) and endothall (EN)
OsPR1a	seedling	A novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) acidic PR1 gene highly responsive to cut, phytohormones, and protein phosphatase inhibitors	A novel rice acidic pathogenesis-related (PR) class 1 cDNA (OsPR1a) was isolated from jasmonic acid (JA)-treated rice seedling leaf
