The OsPR1a cDNA is 830 bp long and contains an open reading frame of 507 nucleotides encoding 168 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 17,560 and pI of 4.4. The deduced amino acid sequence of OsPR1a has a high level of identity with acidic and basic PR1 proteins from plants. Southern analysis revealed that OsPR1a is a member of a multigene family. The OsPR1a gene was found to be cut-inducible, whereas the phytohormones JA, salicylic acid (SA), 3-indoleacetic acid, gibberellin, and ethylene (using ethylene generator ethephon, ET) enhanced accumulation of OsPR1a transcript, as well as the protein phosphatase inhibitors cantharidin (CN) and endothall (EN). Induced expression of OsPR1a gene by JA, CN or EN, and ET was light/dark- and dose-dependent and was almost completely inhibited by cycloheximide. Dark downregulated CN-, EN-, and ET-induced OsPR1a gene expression, whereas it was further enhanced with JA. SA and abscisic acid blocked JA-induced OsPR1a transcript. Simultaneous application of staurosporine (ST) enhances CH- or EN-induced OsPR1a transcript, but not with JA. This is the first report on cloning of a rice acidic PR1 gene (OsPR1a), which is regulated by phytohormones, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation event(s), and light.

To better understand the function of OsBIERF3 in disease resistance response and abiotic tolerance, we overexpressed the OsBIERF3 gene in tobacco by Agrobacterium-mediated leaf disc transformation with a construct containing the OsBIERF3 ORF under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Disease resistance assays showed that the transgenic tobacco plants enhanced disease resistance against infection by tomato mosaic virus and the bacterial wild fire pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci. Elevated level of defense-related PR-1a gene expression was also detected in the transgenic tobacco plants. Moreover, the OsBIERF3-overexpressing transgenic tobacco plants also showed increased tolerance to salt stress. Our results suggest that OsBIERF3 may play important roles in disease resistance response and salt tolerance.

Plant basal resistance is activated by virulent pathogens in susceptible host plants. OsNPR1/NH1, a rice homolog of NPR1 that is the key regulator of systemic acquired resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana, was shown to be involved in the resistance of rice to bacterial blight disease caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced blast resistance. However, the role of OsNPR1/NH1 in rice basal resistance to blast fungus M. oryzae remains uncertain. In this study, the OsNPR1 gene was isolated and identified from rice cultivar Gui99. Transgenic Gui99 rice plants harbouring OsNPR1-RNAi were generated, and the OsNPR1-RNAi plants were significantly more susceptible to M. oryzae infection. Northern hybridization analysis showed that the expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, such as PR-1a, PBZ1, CHI, GLU, and PAL, was significantly suppressed in the OsNPR1-RNAi plants. Consistently, overexpression of OsNPR1 in rice cultivars Gui99 and TP309 conferred significantly enhanced resistance to M. oryzae and increased expression of the above-mentioned PR genes. These results revealed that OsNPR1 is involved in rice basal resistance to the blast pathogen M. oryzae, thus providing new insights into the role of OsNPR1 in rice disease resistance.

Bacterial leaf streak (BLS) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) is an important disease of rice, which is responsible for the economic losses worldwide. Functional investigation of differentially expressed protein genes (DEPGs) from rice (Oryza sativa L.) upon Xoc infection provides insight into the molecular mechanism of rice-Xoc interactions. Here, we show that one of DEPGs designated NRRB plays a role in rice-Xoc interactions. NRRB, a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase gene was preferentially expressed in leaf blades and leaf sheaths where the pathogen colonized. Its transcription was depressed by two defense-signal compounds salicylic acid and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic-acid, but was activated by wounding and abscisic acid. Additionally, a plenty of cis-elements associated with stress responses were discovered in the promoter region of NRRB. These data suggest that NRRB is involved in stress responses. More importantly, the NRRB-suppressing rice plants exhibited enhanced resistance against BLS, with the markedly shorter average lesion length than that of the wild type. Furthermore, transcription of some salicylic acid synthesis-related and pathogenesis-related genes including PAD4, PR1a and WRKY13 in transgenic plants was activated, implying that enhanced resistance to BLS might be mediated by the activation of the SA signaling pathway. In conclusion, NRRB gene is involved in various stress responses and regulating resistance to BLS, therefore it might be one of useful genes for rice improvement in future.
j.1365-313X.2010.04306.x.pdf	Opposite functions of a rice mitogen-activated protein kinase during the process of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae	2010	Plant J	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	The pathogen-induced plant defense signaling network consists of multiple components, although only some of them are characterized. Most of the known components function either as activators or repressors in host-pathogen interactions. Here we report that a mitogen-activated protein kinase, OsMPK6, functions both as an activator and a repressor in rice resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal organism of bacterial blight disease. Activation of OsMPK6 resulted in the formation of lesion mimics and local resistance to Xoo, accompanied by the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), and the induced expression of SA- and JA-signaling genes. Nuclear localization of OsMPK6 was essential for local resistance, suggesting that modulating the expression of defense-responsive genes through transcription regulators may be the primary mechanism of OsMPK6-mediated local resistance. The knock-out of OsMPK6 resulted in enhanced Xoo resistance, increased accumulation of SA and enhanced resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzicola, the causal organism of bacterial streak disease, in systemic tissues. Xoo infection induced the expression of PR1a, the marker gene of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), in systemic health tissues of OsMPK6-knock-out plants. These results suggest that OsMPK6 negatively regulates SAR. Thus OsMPK6 is a two-faced player in the rice-Xoo interaction.
MPMI-19-1127.pdf	Inducible overexpression of a rice allene oxide synthase gene increases the endogenous jasmonic acid level, PR gene expression, and host resistance to fungal infection	2006	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Department of Plant Pathology and Program in Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville 72071, USA.	Many studies in dicotyledonous plants have shown that jasmonates, including jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate, are important signal molecules involved in induced resistance to pathogen infection and insect herbivory. However, very little genetic and molecular evidence is available to demonstrate their role in host defense response of rice and other economically important monocot plants. In this study, we have shown that exogenous application of JA was able to activate defense gene expression and local induced resistance in rice seedlings against the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea). Furthermore, we have characterized a pathogen-inducible rice OsAOS2 gene (which encodes allene oxide synthase, a key enzyme in the JA biosynthetic pathway) and examined the role of endogenous JA in rice defense response through transgenic manipulation of the JA biosynthesis. Sequence analysis indicated that OsAOS2 contains four common domains of the cytochrome P450 enzyme, but does not have the signal peptide for chloroplast targeting. The basal level of OsAOS2 expression is very low in leaves but relatively high in the sheath, culm, and flower of rice plants. Interestingly, the expression of OsAOS2 in rice leaves can be induced significantly upon M. grisea infection. Transgenic rice lines carrying the OsAOS2 transgene under the control of a strong, pathogen-inducible PBZ1 promoter accumulated abundant OsAOS2 transcripts and higher levels of JA, especially after the pathogen infection. These transgenic lines also exhibited enhanced activation of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes such as PR1a, PR3, and PR5 and increased resistance to M. grisea infection. Our results suggest that JA plays a significant role in PR gene induction and blast resistance in rice plants.

NAC (NAM/ATAF/CUC) transcription factors have important functions in regulating plant growth, development, and abiotic and biotic stress responses. Here, we characterized two rice pathogen-responsive NAC transcription factors, ONAC122 and ONAC131. We determined that these proteins localized to the nucleus when expressed ectopically and had transcriptional activation activities. ONAC122 and ONAC131 expression was induced after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of rice blast disease, and the M. grisea-induced expression of both genes was faster and higher in the incompatible interaction compared with the compatible interaction during early stages of infection. ONAC122 and ONAC131 were also induced by treatment with salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate or 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (a precursor of ethylene). Silencing ONAC122 or ONAC131 expression using a newly modified Brome mosaic virus (BMV)-based silencing vector resulted in an enhanced susceptibility to M. grisea. Furthermore, expression levels of several other defense- and signaling-related genes (i.e. OsLOX, OsPR1a, OsWRKY45 and OsNH1) were down-regulated in plants silenced for ONAC122 or ONAC131 expression via the BMV-based silencing system. Our results suggest that both ONAC122 and ONAC131 have important roles in rice disease resistance responses through the regulated expression of other defense- and signaling-related genes.
NA	WRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades in rice are involved in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance 	2020	J Exp Bot	  National Institute of Agricultural Science, Rural Development Administration, Jeonju, Korea.	WRKY proteins play essential roles as negative or positive regulators of pathogen defense. This study explored the roles of different OsWRKY proteins in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) infection in rice. Assays of disease in OsWRKY10KD and OsWRKY88KD lines following infection with an incompatible Xoo race, which induced Xa1-mediated resistance in wild-type plants, showed that OsWRKY10 and OsWRKY88 were positive regulators of Xa1-mediated resistance. OsWRKY10 also acted as a positive regulator in basal defense by directly or indirectly activating transcription of defense-related genes. OsWRKY10 activated the OsPR1a promoter by binding to specific WRKY binding sites. Two transcriptional regulatory cascades of OsWRKY10 were identified in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance. In the first transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of OsWRKY10 whereas OsWRKY51 acted upstream. OsWRKY10 activated OsPR1a in two distinct ways: by binding to its promoter and, at the same time, by indirect activation through OsWRKY47. In the second transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of OsWRKY10, and OsWRKY88 acted upstream. These OsWRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades played important roles in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance to enable the mounting of a rapid immune response against pathogens.
