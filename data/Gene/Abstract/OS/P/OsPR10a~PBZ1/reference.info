Midoh, M. Iwata, Cloning and characterization of a probenazole-inducible gene for an intracellular pathogenesis-related protein in rice, Plant Cell Physiol. 37 (1996) 9â€<U+393C><U+3E33>18), and remains uncharacterized till date. We provide first evidence for the induction of OsPR10 by the global signaling molecule, jasmonic acid (JA), and two protein phosphatase (PP) 2A inhibitors, cantharidin (CN) and endothall (EN). These inductions were light- and time-dependent, and also specific to the dose of applied JA, CN and EN. OsPR10 was not responsive to cut, and was expressed mainly in leaves and leaf sheaths, but not in roots. Furthermore, OsPR10 induction was blocked completely by cycloheximide, indicating requirement of de novo protein synthesis in its induction. Two signal transducers, salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA) induced OsPR10, and a cytokinin, kinetin (KN) also strongly up-regulated its expression, under light. Simultaneously applied staurosporine, a serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitor, strongly enhanced the JA inducible OsPR10 expression. The inducible nature of OsPR10 was affected significantly by a combination of applied JA, with varying concentrations of SA, ABA and KN. Induction of OsPR10 was followed by the appearance of necrotic lesions/coalescing necrotic regions clearly visible at 48 h under light, with CN and EN, but not with JA at a similar time period. Finally, using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we identified a new member of the OsPR10 protein family, the OsPR10-3 protein. This represents the first systematic report in rice demonstrating that the inducible OsPR10 expression is light dependent, and may be regulated via a kinase-signaling cascade.
10.1007-s10658-011-9801-7.pdf	Involvement of OsNPR1/NH1 in rice basal resistance to blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae	2011	European Journal of Plant Pathology	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Microbial and Plant Genetic Engineering, and College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, 100 Daxue Road, Nanning, Guangxi, 530004, China	Rice blast disease, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is a major threat to worldwide rice production. Plant basal resistance is activated by virulent pathogens in susceptible host plants. OsNPR1/NH1, a rice homolog of NPR1 that is the key regulator of systemic acquired resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana, was shown to be involved in the resistance of rice to bacterial blight disease caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced blast resistance. However, the role of OsNPR1/NH1 in rice basal resistance to blast fungus M. oryzae remains uncertain. In this study, the OsNPR1 gene was isolated and identified from rice cultivar Gui99. Transgenic Gui99 rice plants harbouring OsNPR1-RNAi were generated, and the OsNPR1-RNAi plants were significantly more susceptible to M. oryzae infection. Northern hybridization analysis showed that the expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, such as PR-1a, PBZ1, CHI, GLU, and PAL, was significantly suppressed in the OsNPR1-RNAi plants. Consistently, overexpression of OsNPR1 in rice cultivars Gui99 and TP309 conferred significantly enhanced resistance to M. oryzae and increased expression of the above-mentioned PR genes. These results revealed that OsNPR1 is involved in rice basal resistance to the blast pathogen M. oryzae, thus providing new insights into the role of OsNPR1 in rice disease resistance.
425_2007_Article_687.pdf	Identification of an OsPR10a promoter region responsive to salicylic acid	2008	Planta	National Institute of Agricultural Biotechnology, Rural Development Administration, Suwon, South Korea.	Orysa sativa pathogenesis-related protein 10a (OsPR10a) was induced by pathogens, salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethephon, abscisic acid (ABA), and NaCl. We tried to analyze the OsPR10a promoter to investigate the transcriptional regulation of OsPR10a by SA. We demonstrated the inducibility of OsPR10a promoter by SA using transgenic Arabidopsis carrying OsPR10a:GFP as well as by transient expression assays in rice. To further identify the promoter region responsible for its induction by SA, four different deletions of the OsPR10a promoter were made, and their activities were measured by transient assays. The construct containing 687-bp OsPR10a promoter from its start codon exhibited a six-fold increase of induction compared to the control in response to SA. Mutation in the W-box like element 1 (WLE 1) between 687 and 637-bp from TGACA to TGAAA completely abolished induction of the OsPR10a promoter by SA, indicating that the WLE 1 between -687 and -637 of OsPR10a promoter is important in SA-mediated OsPR10a expression. We show for the first time that the W-box like element plays a role in SA mediated PR gene expression.
65_205.pdf	Characterization of PBZ1, a Probenazole-inducible Gene, in Suspension-Cultured Rice Cells	2014	Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry	RIKEN (The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research) 	Probenazole (PBZ) induces non-race specific resistance in rice plants against rice blast fungus and PBZ1 was identified as a PBZ-inducible gene from rice. The induction of PBZ1 expression in suspension-cultured rice cells was investigated. Northern blot analysis indicated that PBZ1 was induced by PBZ in a dosedependent manner. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed a dose and time-dependent accumulation of PBZ1 protein. Both mRNA and protein analysis showed that PBZ1 was not induced by salicylic acid or an active metabolite, 1,2-benzisothiazole-1,1-dioxide.
cr2007104a.pdf	Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants	2008	Cell Res	State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, Department of Plant Pathology, China Agricultural University, Yuanmingyuan West Road 2, Beijing 100094, China.	WRKY transcription factors have many regulatory roles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, we isolated a rice WRKY gene (OsWRKY31) that is induced by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and auxin. This gene encodes a polypeptide of 211 amino-acid residues and belongs to a subgroup of the rice WRKY gene family that probably originated after the divergence of monocot and dicot plants. OsWRKY31 was found to be localized to the nucleus of onion epidermis cells to transiently express OsWRKY31-eGFP fusion protein. Analysis of OsWRKY31 and its mutants fused with a Gal4 DNA-binding domain indicated that OsWRKY31 has transactivation activity in yeast. Overexpression of the OsWRKY31 gene was found to enhance resistance against infection with M. grisea, and the transgenic lines exhibited reduced lateral root formation and elongation compared with wild-type and RNAi plants. The lines with overexpression showed constitutive expression of many defense-related genes, such as PBZ1 and OsSci2, as well as early auxin-response genes, such as OsIAA4 and OsCrl1 genes. Furthermore, the plants with overexpression were less sensitive to exogenously supplied IBA, NAA and 2,4-D at high concentrations, suggesting that overexpression of the OsWRKY31 gene might alter the auxin response or transport. These results also suggest that OsWRKY31 might be a common component in the signal transduction pathways of the auxin response and the defense response in rice.
j.1365-3040.2005.01441.x.pdf	gid1, a gibberellin-insensitive dwarf mutant, shows altered regulation of probenazole-inducible protein (PBZ1) in response to cold stress and pathogen attack	2006	Plant, Cell and Environment	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba 305-8602, Japan.	A recessive gibberellin (GA)-insensitive dwarf mutant of rice, gibberellin-insensitive dwarf1 (gid1), has been identified, which shows a severe dwarf phenotype and contains high concentrations of endogenous GA. To elucidate the function of gid1, proteins regulated downstream of gid1 were analysed using a proteomic approach. Proteins extracted from suspension-cultured cells of gid1 and its wild type were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). Of a total of 962 proteins identified from the suspension-cultured cells, 16 were increased and 14 were decreased in gid1 compared with its wild type. Among the proteins hyper-accumulated in gid1 were osmotin, triosephosphate isomerase, probenazole inducible protein (PBZ1) and pathogenesis-related protein 10. Of these four genes, only the expression of PBZ1 was increased by exogenous GA3 application. Expression of this gene was also enhanced in shoots of the wild type by cold stress or by rice blast fungus infection. Under normal growth conditions, there was more PBZ1 protein in gid1 than in the wild type. In addition, gid1 showed increased tolerance to cold stress and resistance to blast fungus infection. The entcopalyl diphosphate synthase (OsCPS) genes, which encode enzymes at the branch point between GA and phytoalexin biosynthesis, were expressed differentially in gid1 relative to the wild type. Specifically, OsCPS1, which encodes an enzyme in the GA biosynthesis pathway, was down-regulated and OsCPS2 and OsCPS4, which encode enzymes in phytoalexin biosynthesis, were up-regulated in gid1. These results suggest that the expression of PBZ1 is regulated by GA signalling and stress stimuli, and that gid1 is involved in tolerance to cold stress and resistance to blast fungus.
MPMI-06-12-0152-R.pdf	Cytokinins act synergistically with salicylic acid to activate defense gene expression in rice	2013	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Japan. cjjiang@affrc.go.jp	Hormone crosstalk is pivotal in plant-pathogen interactions. Here, we report on the accumulation of cytokinins (CK) in rice seedlings after infection of blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and its potential significance in rice-M. oryzae interaction. Blast infection to rice seedlings increased levels of N(6)-(Delta(2)-isopentenyl) adenine (iP), iP riboside (iPR), and iPR 5'-phosphates (iPRP) in leaf blades. Consistent with this, CK signaling was activated around the infection sites, as shown by histochemical staining for beta-glucuronidase activity driven by a CK-responsive OsRR6 promoter. Diverse CK species were also detected in the hyphae (mycelium), conidia, and culture filtrates of blast fungus, indicating that M. oryzae is capable of production as well as hyphal secretion of CK. Co-treatment of leaf blades with CK and salicylic acid (SA), but not with either one alone, markedly induced pathogenesis-related genes OsPR1b and probenazole-induced protein 1 (PBZ1). These effects were diminished by RNAi-knockdown of OsNPR1 or WRKY45, the key regulators of the SA signaling pathway in rice, indicating that the effects of CK depend on these two regulators. Taken together, our data imply a coevolutionary rice-M. oryzae interaction, wherein M. oryzae probably elevates rice CK levels for its own benefits such as nutrient translocation. Rice plants, on the other hand, sense it as an infection signal and activate defense reactions through the synergistic action with SA.
MPMI-19-1127.pdf	Inducible overexpression of a rice allene oxide synthase gene increases the endogenous jasmonic acid level, PR gene expression, and host resistance to fungal infection	2006	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Department of Plant Pathology and Program in Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville 72071, USA.	Many studies in dicotyledonous plants have shown that jasmonates, including jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate, are important signal molecules involved in induced resistance to pathogen infection and insect herbivory. However, very little genetic and molecular evidence is available to demonstrate their role in host defense response of rice and other economically important monocot plants. In this study, we have shown that exogenous application of JA was able to activate defense gene expression and local induced resistance in rice seedlings against the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea). Furthermore, we have characterized a pathogen-inducible rice OsAOS2 gene (which encodes allene oxide synthase, a key enzyme in the JA biosynthetic pathway) and examined the role of endogenous JA in rice defense response through transgenic manipulation of the JA biosynthesis. Sequence analysis indicated that OsAOS2 contains four common domains of the cytochrome P450 enzyme, but does not have the signal peptide for chloroplast targeting. The basal level of OsAOS2 expression is very low in leaves but relatively high in the sheath, culm, and flower of rice plants. Interestingly, the expression of OsAOS2 in rice leaves can be induced significantly upon M. grisea infection. Transgenic rice lines carrying the OsAOS2 transgene under the control of a strong, pathogen-inducible PBZ1 promoter accumulated abundant OsAOS2 transcripts and higher levels of JA, especially after the pathogen infection. These transgenic lines also exhibited enhanced activation of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes such as PR1a, PR3, and PR5 and increased resistance to M. grisea infection. Our results suggest that JA plays a significant role in PR gene induction and blast resistance in rice plants.
out (3).pdf	Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1	2003	Plant Mol Biol	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba 305-8602, Japan. ynishi@nias.affrc.go.jp	The Gns1 gene of rice (Oryza sativa L. japonica) encodes 1,3;1,4-beta glucanase (EC 3.2.1.73), which hydrolyzes 1,3;1,4-beta-glucosidic linkages on 1,3;1,4-beta-glucan, an important component of cell walls in the Poaceae family. RNA and protein gel blot analyses demonstrated that blast disease or dark treatment induced the expression of the Gns1 gene. To assess the function of the Gns1 gene in disease resistance, we characterized transgenic rice plants constitutively expressing the Gns1 gene. The introduced Gns1 gene was driven by the CaMV 35S promoter and its products were found in the apoplast and accumulated in up to 0.1% of total soluble protein in leaves. Although transgenic plants showed stunted growth and impaired root formation, fertility, germination, and coleoptile elongation appeared unaffected compared to non-transgenic control plants, indicating that Gns1 does not play a crucial role in rice germination and coleoptile elongation. When transgenic plants were inoculated with virulent blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea), they developed many resistant-type lesions on the inoculated leaf accompanying earlier activation of defense-related genes PR-1 and PBZ1 than in control plants. Transgenic plants spontaneously produced brown specks, similar in appearance to those reported for an initiation type of disease-lesion-mimic mutants, on the third and fourth leaves and occasionally on older leaves without inoculation of pathogens. Expression of the two defense-related genes was drastically increased after the emergence of the lesion-mimic phenotype.
Plant Cell Physiol-2004-Hashimoto-550-9.pdf	A novel rice PR10 protein, RSOsPR10, specifically induced in roots by biotic and abiotic stresses, possibly via the jasmonic acid signaling pathway	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Biological Sciences, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Minami-Osawa, Hachioji-shi, Tokyo, 192-0397 Japan.	Plant roots have important roles not only in absorption of water and nutrients, but also in stress tolerance such as desiccation, salt, and low temperature. We have investigated stress-response proteins from rice roots using 2-dimensional polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and found a rice protein, RO-292, which was induced specifically in roots when 2-week-old rice seedlings were subjected to salt and drought stress. The full-length RO-292 cDNA was cloned, and was determined to encode a protein of 160 amino acid residues (16.9 kDa, pI 4.74). The deduced amino acid sequence showed high similarity to known rice PR10 proteins, OsPR10a/PBZ1 and OsPR10b. RO-292 mRNA accumulated rapidly upon drought, NaCl, jasmonic acid and probenazole, but not by exposure to low temperature or by abscisic acid and salicylic acid. The RO-292 gene was also up-regulated by infection with rice blast fungus. Interestingly, induction was observed almost exclusively in roots, thus we named the gene RSOsPR10 (root specific rice PR10). The present results indicate that RSOsPR10 is a novel rice PR10 protein, which is rapidly induced in roots by salt, drought stresses and blast fungus infection possibly through activation of the jasmonic acid signaling pathway, but not the abscisic acid and salicylic acid signaling pathway.
Plant Cell Physiol-2013-Dang-2058-70.pdf	Gene editing a constitutively active OsRac1 by homologous recombination-based gene targeting induces immune responses in rice	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma, 630-0192 Japan.	OsRac1 is a member of the plant small GTPase Rac/Rop family and plays a key role in rice immunity. The constitutively active (CA) G19V mutation of OsRac1 was previously shown to induce reactive oxygen species production, phytoalexin synthesis and defense gene activation, leading to resistance to rice blast infection. To study further the effect of the G19V mutation in disease resistance, we introduced a single base substitution by gene targeting and removed the selectable marker using Cre-loxP site-specific recombination. The CA-OsRac1 gene generated by gene targeting was termed CA-gOsRac1. The G19V mutation was transferred from a targeting vector to the OsRac1 locus and stably transmitted to the next generation. In the leaf blade of homozygous CA-gOsRac1 plants, mutant transcript levels were much lower than in those of wild-type plants. In contrast, mutant transcripts in roots, leaf sheaths and panicles were more abundant than those in leaf blades. However, upon chitin treatment, the expression of defense-related genes PAL1 and PBZ1 in the cell culture was greater in the mutants compared with wild-type plants. Furthermore, induction of hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death was observed in the leaf sheaths of mutant plants infected with a compatible race of rice blast fungus. In the CA-gOsRac1 plants, a number of genes previously shown to be induced by Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) infection were induced in the leaf sheath without pathogen infection. These results suggest that gene targeting will provide mutations useful for gene function studies and crop improvement.
art%3A10.1186%2F1939-8433-5-35.pdf	OsRap2.6 transcription factor contributes to rice innate immunity through its interaction with Receptor for Activated Kinase-C 1 (RACK1)	2012	Rice (N Y)	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma, Nara 630-0192, Japan.	BACKGROUND: The rice small GTPase OsRac1 is a molecular switch in rice innate immunity. The Receptor for Activated Kinase C-1 (RACK1) interacts with OsRac1 to suppress the growth of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. RACK1 has two homologs in rice, RACK1A and RACK1B. Overexpressing RACK1A enhances resistance to the rice blast fungus. However, RACK1A downstream signals are largely unknown. RESULTS: Here, we report the identification of OsRap2.6, a transcription factor that interacts with RACK1A. We found a 94% similarity between the OsRap2.6 AP2 domain and Arabidopsis Rap2.6 (AtRap2.6). Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays in rice protoplasts using tagged OsRap2.6 and RACK1A with the C-terminal and N-terminal fragments of Venus (Vc/Vn) indicated that OsRap2.6 and RACK1A interacted and localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Moreover, OsRap2.6 and OsMAPK3/6 interacted in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Expression of defense genes PAL1 and PBZ1 as well as OsRap2.6 was induced after chitin treatment. Disease resistance analysis using OsRap2.6 RNAi and overexpressing (Ox) plants infected with the rice blast fungus indicated that OsRap2.6 RNAi plants were highly susceptible, whereas OsRap2.6 Ox plants had an increased resistance to the compatible blast fungus. CONCLUSIONS: OsRap2.6 contributes to rice innate immunity through its interaction with RACK1A in compatible interactions.
