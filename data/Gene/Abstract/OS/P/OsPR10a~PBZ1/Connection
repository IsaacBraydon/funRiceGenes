GID1|OsGID1	OsPR10a|PBZ1	gid1, a gibberellin-insensitive dwarf mutant, shows altered regulation of probenazole-inducible protein (PBZ1) in response to cold stress and pathogen attack	 Under normal growth conditions, there was more PBZ1 protein in gid1 than in the wild type
GID1|OsGID1	OsPR10a|PBZ1	gid1, a gibberellin-insensitive dwarf mutant, shows altered regulation of probenazole-inducible protein (PBZ1) in response to cold stress and pathogen attack	 These results suggest that the expression of PBZ1 is regulated by GA signalling and stress stimuli, and that gid1 is involved in tolerance to cold stress and resistance to blast fungus
GID1|OsGID1	OsPR10a|PBZ1	gid1, a gibberellin-insensitive dwarf mutant, shows altered regulation of probenazole-inducible protein (PBZ1) in response to cold stress and pathogen attack	gid1, a gibberellin-insensitive dwarf mutant, shows altered regulation of probenazole-inducible protein (PBZ1) in response to cold stress and pathogen attack
OsPR10a|PBZ1	OsPR1b	Cytokinins act synergistically with salicylic acid to activate defense gene expression in rice	 Co-treatment of leaf blades with CK and salicylic acid (SA), but not with either one alone, markedly induced pathogenesis-related genes OsPR1b and probenazole-induced protein 1 (PBZ1)
OsAOS2	OsPR10a|PBZ1	Inducible overexpression of a rice allene oxide synthase gene increases the endogenous jasmonic acid level, PR gene expression, and host resistance to fungal infection	 Transgenic rice lines carrying the OsAOS2 transgene under the control of a strong, pathogen-inducible PBZ1 promoter accumulated abundant OsAOS2 transcripts and higher levels of JA, especially after the pathogen infection
OsPR10a|PBZ1	OsPR10b|OsPBZc	A novel rice PR10 protein, RSOsPR10, specifically induced in roots by biotic and abiotic stresses, possibly via the jasmonic acid signaling pathway	 The deduced amino acid sequence showed high similarity to known rice PR10 proteins, OsPR10a/PBZ1 and OsPR10b
OsPR10a|PBZ1	OsWRKY6	Molecular characterization of Oryza sativa WRKY6, which binds to W-box-like element 1 of the Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related (PR) 10a promoter and confers reduced susceptibility to pathogens.	 The salicylic acid (SA)-inducible Oryza sativa WRKY6 (OsWRKY6) was identified as a positive regulator of Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related 10a (OsPR10a) by transient expression assays
OsPR10a|PBZ1	OsWRKY6	Molecular characterization of Oryza sativa WRKY6, which binds to W-box-like element 1 of the Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related (PR) 10a promoter and confers reduced susceptibility to pathogens.	 Several pathogenesis-related (PR) genes were constitutively activated, including OsPR10a, and transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plants overexpressing (ox) OsWRKY6 exhibited enhanced disease resistance to pathogens
OsPR10a|PBZ1	OsWAK25	Overexpression of Rice Wall-Associated Kinase 25 (OsWAK25) Alters Resistance to Bacterial and Fungal Pathogens.	 We generated OsWAK25 overexpression lines and show that these lines exhibit a lesion mimic phenotype and enhanced expression of rice NH1 (NPR1 homolog 1), OsPAL2, PBZ1 and PR10
OsPR10a|PBZ1	OsWRKY51	OsWRKY51, a rice transcription factor, functions as a positive regulator in defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	 OsWRKY51 bound to the W-box and WLE1 elements of the OsPR10a promoter
OsPR10a|PBZ1	OsWRKY51	OsWRKY51, a rice transcription factor, functions as a positive regulator in defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	 Based on these results, we suggest that OsWRKY51 is a positive transcriptional regulator of defense signaling and has direct DNA binding ability to the promoter of OsPR10a, although it is reported to be a negative regulator in GA signaling
