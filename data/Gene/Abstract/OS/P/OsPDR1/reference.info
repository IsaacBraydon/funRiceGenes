Jasmonates (JAs) are important regulators of plant growth, development, and defense. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters participate in disease resistance by transporting JAs or antimicrobial secondary metabolites in dicotyledons. Here, we functionally characterized a JAs-inducible rice gene (OsPDR1) that encodes a member of the pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) subfamily of ABC transporters. By affecting JAs biosynthesis, overexpression of OsPDR1 resulted in constitutive activation of defense-related genes and enhanced resistance to bacterial blight, whereas its mutation decreased pathogen resistance. In addition, overexpression and mutation of OsPDR1 resulted in decreased and increased plant growth at seedling stage, respectively, but eventually led to decreased grain yield. OsPDR1 encodes three splice isoforms, of which OsPDR1.2 and OsPDR1.3 contain a conserved glutamate residue in the "ENI-motif" of the first nucleotide-binding domain, while OsPDR1.1 does not. The three OsPDR1 transcripts are developmentally controlled and differentially regulated by JAs and pathogen infection. The OsPDR1.2- and OsPDR1.3-overexpressing plants exhibited higher JAs content and stronger growth inhibition and disease resistance than OsPDR1.1-overexpressing plants. These results indicated that alternative splicing affects the function of OsPDR1 gene in regulation of growth, development and disease resistance.
