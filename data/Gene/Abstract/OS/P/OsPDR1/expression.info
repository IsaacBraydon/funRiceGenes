OsPDR1|OsABCG45	 By affecting JAs biosynthesis, overexpression of OsPDR1 resulted in constitutive activation of defense-related genes and enhanced resistance to bacterial blight, whereas its mutation decreased pathogen resistance |  In addition, overexpression and mutation of OsPDR1 resulted in decreased and increased plant growth at seedling stage, respectively, but eventually led to decreased grain yield	 By affecting JAs biosynthesis, overexpression of OsPDR1 resulted in constitutive activation of defense-related genes and enhanced resistance to bacterial blight, whereas its mutation decreased pathogen resistance |  In addition, overexpression and mutation of OsPDR1 resulted in decreased and increased plant growth at seedling stage, respectively, but eventually led to decreased grain yield
