OsPIN9	 Compared with wild-type plants, ospin9 mutants had fewer tillers, and OsPIN9 overexpression increased the tiller number |  Heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes and yeast demonstrated that OsPIN9 is a functional auxin efflux transporter	 Compared with wild-type plants, ospin9 mutants had fewer tillers, and OsPIN9 overexpression increased the tiller number
OsPIN9	Overexpression of OsPIN9 Impairs Chilling Tolerance via Disturbing ROS Homeostasis in Rice. |  Here, we report that overexpression of OsPIN9 leads to altered plant architecture and chilling tolerance in rice |  The expression profile analysis indicated that OsPIN9 was gradually suppressed by chilling stress	Overexpression of OsPIN9 Impairs Chilling Tolerance via Disturbing ROS Homeostasis in Rice. |  Here, we report that overexpression of OsPIN9 leads to altered plant architecture and chilling tolerance in rice
