OsPIN9	auxin	OsPIN9, an auxin efflux carrier, is required for the regulation of rice tiller bud outgrowth by ammonium	 Heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes and yeast demonstrated that OsPIN9 is a functional auxin efflux transporter
OsPIN9	tiller	OsPIN9, an auxin efflux carrier, is required for the regulation of rice tiller bud outgrowth by ammonium	 Compared with wild-type plants, ospin9 mutants had fewer tillers, and OsPIN9 overexpression increased the tiller number
OsPIN9	tiller	OsPIN9, an auxin efflux carrier, is required for the regulation of rice tiller bud outgrowth by ammonium	 Additionally, OsPIN9 was mainly expressed in vascular tissue of the junction and tiller buds, and encoded a membrane-localised protein
OsPIN9	transporter	OsPIN9, an auxin efflux carrier, is required for the regulation of rice tiller bud outgrowth by ammonium	 Heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes and yeast demonstrated that OsPIN9 is a functional auxin efflux transporter
OsPIN9	tiller number	OsPIN9, an auxin efflux carrier, is required for the regulation of rice tiller bud outgrowth by ammonium	 Compared with wild-type plants, ospin9 mutants had fewer tillers, and OsPIN9 overexpression increased the tiller number
OsPIN9	auxin	Cadmium inhibits lateral root emergence in rice by disrupting OsPIN-mediated auxin distribution and the protective effect of OsHMA3	 Cadmium rapidly downregulated the expression of the auxin efflux transporter genes OsPIN1b, OsPIN1c and OsPIN9 in the stele and LPR
OsPIN9	transporter	Cadmium inhibits lateral root emergence in rice by disrupting OsPIN-mediated auxin distribution and the protective effect of OsHMA3	 Cadmium rapidly downregulated the expression of the auxin efflux transporter genes OsPIN1b, OsPIN1c and OsPIN9 in the stele and LPR
OsPIN9	cadmium	Cadmium inhibits lateral root emergence in rice by disrupting OsPIN-mediated auxin distribution and the protective effect of OsHMA3	 Cadmium rapidly downregulated the expression of the auxin efflux transporter genes OsPIN1b, OsPIN1c and OsPIN9 in the stele and LPR
