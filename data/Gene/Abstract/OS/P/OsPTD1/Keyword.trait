OsPTD1	meiosis	OsSHOC1 and OsPTD1 are essential for crossover formation during rice meiosis.	 Our results suggest that OsSHOC1 and OsPTD1 are essential for rice fertilization and CO formation, possibly by stabilizing the recombinant intermediates during meiosis
OsPTD1	fertility	OsSHOC1 and OsPTD1 are essential for crossover formation during rice meiosis.	 Further investigations showed that OsSHOC1 physically interacted with OsPTD1 and that the latter was also required for normal CO formation and plant fertility
OsPTD1	meiotic	OsSHOC1 and OsPTD1 are essential for crossover formation during rice meiosis.	 In this study, we report the isolation of a meiotic gene, OsSHOC1, and the identification of its partner, OsPTD1
OsPTD1	crossover	OsSHOC1 and OsPTD1 are essential for crossover formation during rice meiosis.	OsSHOC1 and OsPTD1 are essential for crossover formation during rice meiosis.
OsPTD1	growth	Use of RNAi With OsMYB76R as a Reporter for Candidate Genes Can Efficiently Create and Verify Gametophytic Male Sterility in Rice.	 Then, the ascorbic acid oxidase gene OsPTD1 was downregulated using RNAi, driven by its own promoter that resulted in abnormal pollen tube growth
OsPTD1	pollen	Use of RNAi With OsMYB76R as a Reporter for Candidate Genes Can Efficiently Create and Verify Gametophytic Male Sterility in Rice.	 Then, the ascorbic acid oxidase gene OsPTD1 was downregulated using RNAi, driven by its own promoter that resulted in abnormal pollen tube growth
