OsPLL4	development	Genome-wide identification of the pectate lyase-like (PLL) gene family and functional analysis of two PLL genes in rice.	 Notably, OsPLL1, OsPLL3, OsPLL4 and OsPLL12 exhibit strong and preferential expression in panicles suggesting that the potential roles of these genes are crucial during rice panicle development
OsPLL4	development	Genome-wide identification of the pectate lyase-like (PLL) gene family and functional analysis of two PLL genes in rice.	 Moreover, knockdown of OsPLL3 and OsPLL4 by artificial microRNA (amiRNA) disrupted normal pollen development and resulted in partial male sterility
OsPLL4	pollen	Genome-wide identification of the pectate lyase-like (PLL) gene family and functional analysis of two PLL genes in rice.	 Moreover, knockdown of OsPLL3 and OsPLL4 by artificial microRNA (amiRNA) disrupted normal pollen development and resulted in partial male sterility
OsPLL4	panicle	Genome-wide identification of the pectate lyase-like (PLL) gene family and functional analysis of two PLL genes in rice.
