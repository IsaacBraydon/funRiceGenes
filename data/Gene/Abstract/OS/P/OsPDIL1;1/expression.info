OsPDIL1;1	 Expression analysis of transgenic rice and identification of cleavage sites showed that OsPDIL1;1 mRNA is a target of osa-miR5144-3p |  Expression of osa-miR5144-3p and OsPDIL1;1 were shown to be inversely regulated in developing organs and under abiotic stress |  The transgenic rice down-expression of osa-miR5144-3p or overexpression of OsPDIL1;1 showed increased total protein-disulfide bond content, compared to the wild type |  This indicates that protein-disulfide bond formation is enhanced by down-regulation of osa-miR5144-3p or overexpression of OsPDIL1;1	 The transgenic rice down-expression of osa-miR5144-3p or overexpression of OsPDIL1;1 showed increased total protein-disulfide bond content, compared to the wild type |  This indicates that protein-disulfide bond formation is enhanced by down-regulation of osa-miR5144-3p or overexpression of OsPDIL1;1
