NA	Formation of Protein Disulfide Bonds Catalyzed by OsPDIL1;1 is Mediated by microRNA5144-3p in Rice.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	Key Laboratory of South China Agricultural Plant Molecular Analysis and Genetic Improvement &amp; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Botany, South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510650, China.	Correct folding of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum is important for their stability and function under stress. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDIs) OsPDIL1;1 is a key protein-folding catalyst in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, microRNA5144 (osa-miR5144-3p) is reported to mediate the formation of protein disulfide bonds via targeting OsPDIL1;1 mRNA in rice seeds and seedlings during development and under conditions of abiotic stress, respectively. Expression analysis of transgenic rice and identification of cleavage sites showed that OsPDIL1;1 mRNA is a target of osa-miR5144-3p. Expression of osa-miR5144-3p and OsPDIL1;1 were shown to be inversely regulated in developing organs and under abiotic stress. The transgenic rice down-expression of osa-miR5144-3p or overexpression of OsPDIL1;1 showed increased total protein-disulfide bond content, compared to the wild type. This indicates that protein-disulfide bond formation is enhanced by down-regulation of osa-miR5144-3p or overexpression of OsPDIL1;1. These transgenic rice plants also displayed strong resistance to salinity and mercury stress, in comparison to the wild type. In contrast, the transgenic rice plants overexpressing osa-miR5144-3p or down-expressing OsPDIL1;1 resulted in a lower protein-disulfide bond content; they were susceptible to abiotic stress and produced abnormal grains with small and loosely packed starch granules. These results indicate that protein-disulfide bond formation catalyzed by OsPDIL1;1 is modulated by osa-miR5144-3p in rice during development and is involved in resistance to abiotic stress.
NA	Genetic Background Negates Improvements in Rice Flour Characteristics and Food Processing Properties Caused by a Mutant Allele of the PDIL1-1 Seed Storage Protein Gene.	2022	Rice (N Y)	National Agricultural and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, 305-8518, Japan. horikiyo@affrc.go.jp.	Phenotypic differences among breeding lines that introduce the same superior gene allele can be a barrier to effective development of cultivars with desirable traits in some crop species. For example, a deficient mutation of the Protein Disulfide Isomerase Like 1-1 (PDIL1-1) gene can cause accumulation of glutelin seed storage protein precursors in rice endosperm, and improves rice flour characteristics and food processing properties. However, the gene must be expressed to be useful. A deficient mutant allele of PDIL1-1 was introduced into two rice cultivars with different genetic backgrounds (Koshihikari and Oonari). The grain components, agronomic traits, and rice flour and food processing properties of the resulting lines were evaluated. The two breeding lines had similar seed storage protein accumulation, amylose content, and low-molecular-weight metabolites. However, only the Koshihikari breeding line had high flour quality and was highly suitable for rice bread, noodles, and sponge cake, evidence of the formation of high-molecular-weight protein complexes in the endosperm. Transcriptome analysis revealed that mRNA levels of fourteen PDI, Ero1, and BiP genes were increased in the Koshihikari breeding line, whereas this change was not observed in the Oonari breeding line. We elucidated part of the molecular basis of the phenotypic differences between two breeding lines possessing the same mutant allele in different genetic backgrounds. The results suggest that certain genetic backgrounds can negate the beneficial effect of the PDIL1-1 mutant allele. Better understanding of the molecular basis for such interactions may accelerate future breeding of novel rice cultivars to meet the strong demand for gluten-free foods.
