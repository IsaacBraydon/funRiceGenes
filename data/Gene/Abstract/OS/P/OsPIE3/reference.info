NA	E3 ubiquitin ligase OsPIE3 destabilises the B-lectin receptor-like kinase PID2 to control blast disease resistance in rice.	2022	New Phytol	Collaborative Innovation Center of Henan Grain Crops, Key Laboratory of Henan Rice Biology, Center for Crop Genome Engineering, College of Agronomy, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 450046, China.	Previous studies have reported that PID2, which encodes a B-lectin receptor-like kinase, is a key gene in the resistance of rice to Magnaporthe oryzae strain ZB15. However, the PID2-mediated downstream signalling events remain largely unknown. The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase OsPIE3 (PID2-interacting E3) was isolated and confirmed to play key roles in PID2-mediated rice blast resistance. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that the armadillo repeat region of OsPIE3 is required for its interaction with PID2. Further investigation demonstrated that OsPIE3 can modify the subcellular localisation of PID2, thus promoting its nuclear recruitment from the plasma membrane for protein degradation in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Site-directed mutagenesis of a conserved cysteine site (C230S) within the U-box domain of OsPIE3 reduces PID2 translocation and ubiquitination. Genetic analysis suggested that OsPIE3 loss-of-function mutants exhibited enhanced resistance to M. oryzae isolate ZB15, whereas mutants with overexpressed OsPIE3 exhibited reduced resistance. Furthermore, the OsPIE3/PID2-double mutant displayed a similar blast phenotype to that of the PID2 single mutant, suggesting that OsPIE3 is a negative regulator and functions along with PID2 in blast disease resistance. Our findings confirm that the E3 ubiquitin ligase OsPIE3 is necessary for PID2-mediated rice blast disease resistance regulation.
NA	Rice OsPUB16 modulates the &#x27;SAPK9-OsMADS23-OsAOC&#x27; pathway to reduce plant water-deficit tolerance by repressing ABA and JA biosynthesis.	2022	PLoS Genet	Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Bioengineering College, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China.	Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis plays crucial roles in plant responses to environmental stress. However, the mechanism by which E3 ubiquitin ligases modulate plant stress response still needs to be elucidated. In this study, we found that rice PLANT U-BOX PROTEIN 16 (OsPUB16), a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase, negatively regulates rice drought response. Loss-of-function mutants of OsPUB16 generated through CRISPR/Cas9 system exhibited the markedly enhanced water-deficit tolerance, while OsPUB16 overexpression lines were hypersensitive to water deficit stress. Moreover, OsPUB16 negatively regulated ABA and JA response, and ospub16 mutants produced more endogenous ABA and JA than wild type when exposed to water deficit. Mechanistic investigations revealed that OsPUB16 mediated the ubiquitination and degradation of OsMADS23, which is the substrate of OSMOTIC STRESS/ABA-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 9 (SAPK9) and increases rice drought tolerance by promoting ABA biosynthesis. Further, the ChIP-qPCR analysis and transient transactivation activity assays demonstrated that OsMADS23 activated the expression of JA-biosynthetic gene OsAOC by binding to its promoter. Interestingly, SAPK9-mediated phosphorylation on OsMADS23 reduced its ubiquitination level by interfering with the OsPUB16-OsMADS23 interaction, which thus enhanced OsMADS23 stability and promoted OsAOC expression. Collectively, our findings establish that OsPUB16 reduces plant water-deficit tolerance by modulating the &#x27;SAPK9-OsMADS23-OsAOC&#x27; pathway to repress ABA and JA biosynthesis.
