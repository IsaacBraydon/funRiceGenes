OsPIE3|OsPUB16	 Loss-of-function mutants of OsPUB16 generated through CRISPR/Cas9 system exhibited the markedly enhanced water-deficit tolerance, while OsPUB16 overexpression lines were hypersensitive to water deficit stress |  Interestingly, SAPK9-mediated phosphorylation on OsMADS23 reduced its ubiquitination level by interfering with the OsPUB16-OsMADS23 interaction, which thus enhanced OsMADS23 stability and promoted OsAOC expression	 Loss-of-function mutants of OsPUB16 generated through CRISPR/Cas9 system exhibited the markedly enhanced water-deficit tolerance, while OsPUB16 overexpression lines were hypersensitive to water deficit stress
