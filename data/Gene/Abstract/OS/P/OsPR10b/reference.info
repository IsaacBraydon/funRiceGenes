Plant Cell Physiol-2004-Hashimoto-550-9.pdf	A novel rice PR10 protein, RSOsPR10, specifically induced in roots by biotic and abiotic stresses, possibly via the jasmonic acid signaling pathway	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Biological Sciences, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Minami-Osawa, Hachioji-shi, Tokyo, 192-0397 Japan.	Plant roots have important roles not only in absorption of water and nutrients, but also in stress tolerance such as desiccation, salt, and low temperature. We have investigated stress-response proteins from rice roots using 2-dimensional polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and found a rice protein, RO-292, which was induced specifically in roots when 2-week-old rice seedlings were subjected to salt and drought stress. The full-length RO-292 cDNA was cloned, and was determined to encode a protein of 160 amino acid residues (16.9 kDa, pI 4.74). The deduced amino acid sequence showed high similarity to known rice PR10 proteins, OsPR10a/PBZ1 and OsPR10b. RO-292 mRNA accumulated rapidly upon drought, NaCl, jasmonic acid and probenazole, but not by exposure to low temperature or by abscisic acid and salicylic acid. The RO-292 gene was also up-regulated by infection with rice blast fungus. Interestingly, induction was observed almost exclusively in roots, thus we named the gene RSOsPR10 (root specific rice PR10). The present results indicate that RSOsPR10 is a novel rice PR10 protein, which is rapidly induced in roots by salt, drought stresses and blast fungus infection possibly through activation of the jasmonic acid signaling pathway, but not the abscisic acid and salicylic acid signaling pathway.
NA	Identification of a small set of genes commonly regulated in rice roots in response to beneficial rhizobacteria	2020	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	Ecologie Microbienne, CNRS UMR-5557, INRAe UMR-1418, VetAgroSup, Universit¨¦ de Lyon, Universit¨¦ Lyon1, 16 rue Dubois, 69622 Villeurbanne, France.	Rhizosphere bacteria, whether phytopathogenic or phytobeneficial, are thought to be perceived by the plant as a threat. Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR), such as many strains of the Azospirillum genus known as the main phytostimulator of cereals, cooperate with host plants and favorably affect their growth and health. An earlier study of rice root transcriptome, undertaken with two rice cultivars and two Azospirillum strains, revealed a strain-dependent response during the rice-Azospirillum association and showed that only a few genes, including some implicated in plant defense, were commonly regulated in all tested conditions. Here, a set of genes was selected from previous studies and their expression was monitored by qRT-PCR in rice roots inoculated with ten PGPR strains isolated from various plants and belonging to various genera (Azospirillum, Herbaspirillum, Paraburkholderia). A common expression pattern was highlighted for four genes that are proposed to be markers of the rice-PGPR interaction: two genes involved in diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis (OsDXS3 and OsDTC2) and one coding for an uncharacterized protein (Os02g0582900) were significantly induced by PGPR whereas one defense-related gene encoding a pathogenesis-related protein (PR1b, Os01g0382000) was significantly repressed. Interestingly, exposure to a rice bacterial pathogen also triggered the expression of OsDXS3 while the expression of Os02g0582900 and PR1b was down-regulated, suggesting that these genes might play a key role in rice-bacteria interactions. Integration of these results with previous data led us to propose that the jasmonic acid signaling pathway might be triggered in rice roots upon inoculation with PGPR.
NA	A histone deacetylase inhibitor enhances rice immunity by derepressing the expression of defense-related genes.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Hubei Engineering Research Center for Specialty Flowers Biological Breeding/College of Bioengineering, Jingchu University of Technology, Jingmen, China.	Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACis) have been widely used in plants to investigate the role of histone acetylation, particularly the function of HDACs, in the regulation of development and stress response. However, how histone acetylation is involved in rice (Oryza sativa L.) disease resistance has hardly been studied. In this paper, four HDACis including Sodium butyrate (NaBT), Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid (SAHA), LBH-589 and Trichostatin A (TSA) were used to treat rice seedlings at different concentrations before inoculation of Magnaporthe oryzae. We found that only 10mM NaBT treatment can significantly enhanced rice blast resistance. However, treatment of the four HDACis all increased global histone acetylation but at different sites, suggesting that the inhibition selectivity of these HDACis is different. Notably, the global H3K9ac level was dramatically elevated after both NaBT and LBH589 treatment although LBH589 could not enhance rice blast resistance. This indicates that the HDACs they inhibit target different genes. In accordance with the phenotype, transcriptomic analysis showed that many defense-related genes were up-regulated by NaBT treatment. Up-regulation of the four genes bsr-d1, PR10B, OsNAC4, OsKS4 were confirmed by RT-qPCR. ChIP-qPCR results revealed that H3K9ac level on these genes was increased after NaBT treatment, suggesting that these defense-related genes were repressed by HDACs. In addition, by promoter motif analysis of the genes that induced by both NaBT treatment and rice blast infection, we found that the motifs bound by ERF and AHL transcription factors (TFs) were the most abundant, which demonstrates that ERF and AHL proteins may act as the candidate TFs that recruit HDACs to defense-related genes to repress their expression when plants are not infected by rice blast.
