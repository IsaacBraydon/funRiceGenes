OsA8	OsLPT1|OsPht1;6|OsPT6	Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice	 Knockout of OsA8 affected the expression of several OsA genes and the high affinity phosphate transporter, OsPT6, and resulted in a higher P concentration in the roots and a lower amount of P in the shoots
OsLPT1|OsPht1;6|OsPT6	OsPht1;2|OsPT2	Two rice phosphate transporters, OsPht1;2 and OsPht1;6, have different functions and kinetic properties in uptake and translocation	 Here, we report on the expression patterns, biological properties and the physiological roles of two members of the family: OsPht1;2 (OsPT2) and OsPht1;6 (OsPT6)|Two rice phosphate transporters, OsPht1;2 and OsPht1;6, have different functions and kinetic properties in uptake and translocation| By using transgenic rice plants expressing the GUS reporter gene, driven by their promoters, we detected that OsPT2 was localized exclusively in the stele of primary and lateral roots, whereas OsPT6 was expressed in both epidermal and cortical cells of the younger primary and lateral roots| OsPT6, but not OsPT2, was able to complement a yeast Pi uptake mutant in the high-affinity concentration range| In transgenic rice, the knock-down of either OsPT2 or OsPT6 expression by RNA interference significantly decreased both the uptake and the long-distance transport of Pi from roots to shoots| Taken together, these data suggest OsPT6 plays a broad role in Pi uptake and translocation throughout the plant, whereas OsPT2 is a low-affinity Pi transporter, and functions in translocation of the stored Pi in the plant
