OsPIPK1	leaf	OsPIPK1, a rice phosphatidylinositol monophosphate kinase, regulates rice heading by modifying the expression of floral induction genes	 oral development in antisense plants, as well as leaf emergence measurement indicating delayed leaf development under OsPIPK1 deficiency, a common phenotype observed with earlier flowering
OsPIPK1	leaf development	OsPIPK1, a rice phosphatidylinositol monophosphate kinase, regulates rice heading by modifying the expression of floral induction genes	 oral development in antisense plants, as well as leaf emergence measurement indicating delayed leaf development under OsPIPK1 deficiency, a common phenotype observed with earlier flowering
OsPIPK1	flower	OsPIPK1, a rice phosphatidylinositol monophosphate kinase, regulates rice heading by modifying the expression of floral induction genes	 RT-PCR analysis indicated that OsPIPK1 was expressed almost constitutively in roots, shoots, stems, leaves and flowers, and upregulated following treatment with plant hormones or application of various stresses
OsPIPK1	flower	OsPIPK1, a rice phosphatidylinositol monophosphate kinase, regulates rice heading by modifying the expression of floral induction genes	 oral development in antisense plants, as well as leaf emergence measurement indicating delayed leaf development under OsPIPK1 deficiency, a common phenotype observed with earlier flowering
OsPIPK1	flower	OsPIPK1, a rice phosphatidylinositol monophosphate kinase, regulates rice heading by modifying the expression of floral induction genes	 RT-PCR analysis and cDNA chip technology were used to examine transcripts of various genes in the transgenic plants and the results showed altered transcriptions of several flowering-time or - identity related genes, suggesting that OsPIPK1 is involved in rice heading through regulation of
