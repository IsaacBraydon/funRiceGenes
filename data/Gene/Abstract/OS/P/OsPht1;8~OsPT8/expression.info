OsPht1;8|OsPT8	 In this study, we knocked down expression of a phosphate transporter gene OsPht1;8 (OsPT8) selectively in shoot and/or in seed endosperm by RNA-interference using RISBZ1 and GluB-1 promoter (designate these transgenic lines as SSRi and EnSRi), respectively, to characterize the role of OsPT8 in P redistribution of rice
