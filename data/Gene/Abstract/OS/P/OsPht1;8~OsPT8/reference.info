169.pdf	OsMYB2P-1, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, is involved in the regulation of phosphate-starvation responses and root architecture in rice	2012	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, People's Republic of China.	An R2R3 MYB transcription factor, OsMYB2P-1, was identified from microarray data by monitoring the expression profile of rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) seedlings exposed to phosphate (Pi)-deficient medium. Expression of OsMYB2P-1 was induced by Pi starvation. OsMYB2P-1 was localized in the nuclei and exhibited transcriptional activation activity. Overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice enhanced tolerance to Pi starvation, while suppression of OsMYB2P-1 by RNA interference in rice rendered the transgenic rice more sensitive to Pi deficiency. Furthermore, primary roots of OsMYB2P-1-overexpressing plants were shorter than those in wild-type plants under Pi-sufficient conditions, while primary roots and adventitious roots of OsMYB2P-1-overexpressing plants were longer than those of wild-type plants under Pi-deficient conditions. These results suggest that OsMYB2P-1 may also be associated with the regulation of root system architecture. Overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 led to greater expression of Pi-responsive genes such as Oryza sativa UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase, OsIPS1, OsPAP10, OsmiR399a, and OsmiR399j. In contrast, overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 suppressed the expression of OsPHO2 under both Pi-sufficient and Pi-deficient conditions. Moreover, expression of OsPT2, which encodes a low-affinity Pi transporter, was up-regulated in OsMYB2P-1-overexpressing plants under Pi-sufficient conditions, whereas expression of the high-affinity Pi transporters OsPT6, OsPT8, and OsPT10 was up-regulated by overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 under Pi-deficient conditions, suggesting that OsMYB2P-1 may act as a Pi-dependent regulator in controlling the expression of Pi transporters. These findings demonstrate that OsMYB2P-1 is a novel R2R3 MYB transcriptional factor associated with Pi starvation signaling in rice.
Chen-2011-OsPHF1 regulates the.pdf	OsPHF1 regulates the plasma membrane localization of low- and high-affinity inorganic phosphate transporters and determines inorganic phosphate uptake and translocation in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, People's Republic of China.	PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 (PHF1) is known to regulate the plasma membrane localization of PHT1;1, a high-affinity inorganic phosphate (Pi) transporter in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). OsPHF1, a rice (Oryza sativa) gene homologous to AtPHF1, was isolated and found to regulate the localization of both low- and high-affinity Pi transporters to the plasma membrane. Three OsPHF1 allelic mutants carrying one-point mutations at the fifth WD-repeat motif and two at the transmembrane helix, respectively, showed arsenate resistance and severely reduced Pi accumulation. The data indicate that mutation of OsPHF1 results in the endoplasmic reticulum retention of the low-affinity Pi transporter OsPT2 and high-affinity Pi transporter OsPT8. Mutation of OsPHF1 also reduced Pi accumulation in plants exhibiting excessive shoot Pi accumulation due to the overexpression of OsPHR2. However, the transcript level of OsPHF1 itself is not controlled by OsPHR2. Overexpression of OsPHF1 increased Pi accumulation in both roots and shoots in a solution culture with Pi-supplied condition. These results indicate that the role of OsPHF1 is unique in the localization of both low- and high-affinity Pi transporters on the plasma membrane in rice and determines Pi uptake and translocation in rice. The similar function of PHF1 required to facilitate PHT1 transit through the endoplasmic reticulum between Arabidopsis and rice provides an example of expectations from what one would deduce from sequence comparisons to extend knowledge from Arabidopsis to crops.
j.1365-313X.2008.03734.x.pdf	Involvement of OsSPX1 in phosphate homeostasis in rice	2009	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Arabidopsis thaliana SPX (SYG/PHO81/XPR1) domain genes have recently been shown to be involved in the phosphate (Pi) signaling pathway. We show here that a rice (Oryza sativa) SPX gene, OsSPX1, is specifically induced by Pi starvation in roots. Suppression of OsSPX1 by RNA interference resulted in severe signs of toxicity caused by the over-accumulation of Pi, similar to that found in OsPHR2 (phosphate starvation response transcription factor 2) overexpressors and pho2 (phosphate-responsive mutant 2). Quantitative RT-PCR showed that expression of OsSPX1 was strongly induced in OsPHR2 overexpression and pho2 mutant plants, indicating that OsSPX1 occurs downstream of OsPHR2 and PHO2. The expression of 10 genes associated with the phosphate-starvation signal pathways was analyzed. Expression of OsPT2 (phosphate transporter 2) and OsPT8 was significantly induced in OsSPX1-RNAi (OsSPX1-Ri) plants, suggesting that over-accumulation of Pi in OsSPX1-Ri plants results from an increase in Pi transport. In contrast, overexpression of OsSPX1 suppressed the induction of expression by Pi starvation of all 10 phosphate starvation-induced genes tested: IPS1 (induced by phosphate starvation 1), IPS2, OsPAP10 (purple acid phosphatase 10), OsSQD2 (sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2), miR399d and miR399j (microRNA 399), OsPT2, OsPT3, OsPT6 and OsPT8. This suggests that OsSPX1 acts via a negative feedback loop to optimize growth under phosphate-limited conditions.
Plant Physiol.-2011-Jia-1164-75.pdf	The phosphate transporter gene OsPht1;8 is involved in phosphate homeostasis in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Plant phosphate transporters (PTs) are active in the uptake of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from the soil and its translocation within the plant. Here, we report on the biological properties and physiological roles of OsPht1;8 (OsPT8), one of the PTs belonging to the Pht1 family in rice (Oryza sativa). Expression of a beta-glucuronidase and green fluorescent protein reporter gene driven by the OsPT8 promoter showed that OsPT8 is expressed in various tissue organs from roots to seeds independent of Pi supply. OsPT8 was able to complement a yeast Pi-uptake mutant and increase Pi accumulation of Xenopus laevis oocytes when supplied with micromolar (33)Pi concentrations at their external solution, indicating that it has a high affinity for Pi transport. Overexpression of OsPT8 resulted in excessive Pi in both roots and shoots and Pi toxic symptoms under the high-Pi supply condition. In contrast, knockdown of OsPT8 by RNA interference decreased Pi uptake and plant growth under both high- and low-Pi conditions. Moreover, OsPT8 suppression resulted in an increase of phosphorus content in the panicle axis and in a decrease of phosphorus content in unfilled grain hulls, accompanied by lower seed-setting rate. Altogether, our data suggest that OsPT8 is involved in Pi homeostasis in rice and is critical for plant growth and development.
Plant Physiol.-2011-Wu-498-508.pdf	Investigating the contribution of the phosphate transport pathway to arsenic accumulation in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Arsenic (As) accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa) may pose a significant health risk to consumers. Plants take up different As species using various pathways. Here, we investigated the contribution of the phosphate (Pi) transport pathway to As accumulation in rice grown hydroponically or under flooded soil conditions. In hydroponic experiments, a rice mutant defective in OsPHF1 (for phosphate transporter traffic facilitator1) lost much of the ability to take up Pi and arsenate and to transport them from roots to shoots, whereas transgenic rice overexpressing either the Pi transporter OsPht1;8 (OsPT8) or the transcription factor OsPHR2 (for phosphate starvation response2) had enhanced abilities of Pi and arsenate uptake and translocation. OsPT8 was found to have a high affinity for both Pi and arsenate, and its overexpression increased the maximum influx by 3- to 5-fold. In arsenate-treated plants, both arsenate and arsenite were detected in the xylem sap, with the proportion of the latter increasing with the exposure time. Under the flooded soil conditions, the phf1 mutant took up less Pi whereas the overexpression lines took up more Pi. But there were no similar effects on As accumulation and distribution. Rice grain contained predominantly dimethylarsinic acid and arsenite, with arsenate being a minor species. These results suggest that the Pi transport pathway contributed little to As uptake and transport to grain in rice plants grown in flooded soil. Transgenic approaches to enhance Pi acquisition from paddy soil through the overexpression of Pi transporters may not increase As accumulation in rice grain.
PNAS-2002-Paszkowski-13324-9.pdf	Rice phosphate transporters include an evolutionarily divergent gene specifically activated in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis	2002	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Torrey Mesa Research Institute, San Diego, CA 92121, USA. uta.paszkowski@syngenta.com	Using a genome-wide approach, we asked how many transporter genes contribute to symbiotic phosphate uptake and analyzed their evolutionary conservation. Considering the sequenced rice genome at hand, only the Oryza sativa phosphate transporter (OsPT) gene OsPT11 was specifically induced during the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. This induction was confined to the root system and was tightly correlated with the degree of root colonization by Glomus intraradices. OsPT11 activation was independent of the nutritional status of the plant and phosphate availability in the rhizosphere. Moreover, infection of roots with the fungal pathogens Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium moniliforme did not activate OsPT11, corroborating the high signal specificity for OsPT11 activation in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. OsPT11 expression complemented a defect in phosphate uptake in a yeast strain mutated in its high-affinity P(i) transporter (pho84), thereby confirming its function. Recently, a phosphate transporter gene in potato was shown to be induced during arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Assessment of the phylogenetic relationship of the rice and potato protein revealed that the rice is nonorthologous to the potato protein. Further, there are no structural commonalities in the promoter regions. Thus, although cytological and physiological features of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis seem to be conserved, the molecular components may differ significantly between distantly related plant species.
NA	Phosphate transporter OsPht1;8 in rice plays an important role in phosphorus redistribution from source to sink organs and allocation between embryo and endosperm of seeds.	2014	Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Tobacco Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Qingdao 266101, China.	Phosphorus (P) redistribution from source to sink organs within plant is required for optimizing growth and development under P deficient condition. In this study, we knocked down expression of a phosphate transporter gene OsPht1;8 (OsPT8) selectively in shoot and/or in seed endosperm by RNA-interference using RISBZ1 and GluB-1 promoter (designate these transgenic lines as SSRi and EnSRi), respectively, to characterize the role of OsPT8 in P redistribution of rice. In comparison to wild type (WT) and EnSRi lines, SSRi lines under P deficient condition accumulated more P in old blades and less P in young blades, corresponding to attenuated and enriched transcripts of P-responsive genes in old and young blades, respectively. The ratio of total P in young blades to that in old blades decreased from 2.6 for WT to 0.9-1.2 for SSRi lines. During the grain-filling stage, relative to WT, SSRi lines showed the substantial decrease of total P content in both endosperm and embryo, while EnSRi lines showed 40-50% decrease of total P content in embryo but similar P content in endosperm. Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsPT8 plays a critical role in redistribution of P from source to sink organs and P homeostasis in seeds of rice.
NA	The role of OsPT8 in arsenate uptake and varietal difference in arsenate tolerance in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Arsenic (As) contamination in paddy soil can cause phytotoxicity and elevated As accumulation in rice grain. Rice varieties vary in As uptake and tolerance, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, the aus variety Kasalath was found to be more tolerant to arsenate [As(V)] than the japonica variety Nipponbare, but the two varieties showed similar arsenite [As(III)] tolerance. Nipponbare took up more phosphate (Pi) and As(V) than Kasalath. The expression of genes for Pi transporters or Pi homeostasis regulation was quantified. Nipponbare showed 2- to 3-fold higher expression of the Pi transporter genes OsPT2 and OsPT8 than Kasalath. Two ospt8 mutants were isolated from the Kasalath background and compared with an ospt8 mutant in the Nipponbare background. Mutation in OsPT8 in both backgrounds decreased As(V) uptake by 33-57%, increased As(V) tolerance assayed by root elongation by &gt;100-fold, and abolished the varietal differences in As(V) uptake and tolerance. The results show that OsPT8 plays a key role in As(V) uptake and that As(V) uptake mediated by OsPT8 exerts a profound toxic effect on root elongation. The results also suggest that differential OsPT8 expression explains the varietal differences in As(V) uptake and tolerance between Kasalath and Nipponbare.
NA	OsPht1;8, a phosphate transporter, is involved in auxin and phosphate starvation response in rice.	2017	J Exp Bot	National Tobacco Cultivation and Physiology and Biochemistry Research Centre, College of Tobacco Science, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450002, China.	The responses of plants to auxin and phosphate (Pi) starvation are closely linked. However, the underlying mechanisms connecting the Pi starvation (-Pi) responses to auxin are largely unclear. Here, we show that OsPht1;8 (OsPT8), a phosphate transporter, functions in both the auxin and -Pi responses in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). The overexpression of OsPT8 (OsPT8-Oe) led to the loss of sensitivity to auxin and -Pi in adventitious roots, lateral roots, and root hairs in rice. The expression levels of OsPT8 and pOsPT8::GUS staining in roots, root-shoot junctions and leaves of rice were induced by IAA treatments. The number of young lateral roots in the OsPT8-Oe transgenic rice, which had higher auxin concentrations, was distinctly more than that in the wild-type, possibly as a result of increased expression of auxin-related genes under normal Pi condition. Moreover, tobacco overexpressing OsPT8 had a similar root phenotype to OsPT8-Oe rice. These data reveal a novel biological function of OsPT8 in the cross-talk between Pi and auxin signaling, and provide new evidence for the linkage between auxin and -Pi responses.
NA	The Rice Phosphate Transporter Protein OsPT8 Regulates Disease Resistance and Plant Growth.	2019	Sci Rep	Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Biology and Control of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests and College of Plant Protection, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, Hunan, 410128, P. R. China.	The absorption of nutrients and disease resistance are two indispensable physiological processes in plants; however, it is still largely unknown whether there is cross-talk between their molecular signaling pathways. In this study, we identified the rice OsPT8 protein, which is a member of the phosphate transporters (PTs) Pht1 family and also plays a role in rice disease resistance. The transcriptional level of OsPT8 is suppressed after infection with rice pathogens and treatment with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Overexpression of OsPT8 suppresses rice disease resistance against the pathogens Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Accordingly, the transcription level of resistance related genes, such as PAL and PBZ1, is inhibited in plants overexpressing OsPT8 (OsPT8-OX) after inoculation with these pathogens. In OsPT8-OX plants, PAMPs-triggered immunity (PTI) response genes, such as OsRac1 and SGT1, are suppressed during treatment with PAMPs chitin or flg22. Moreover, the typical response of PTI is suppressed after chitin or flg22 treatment. We also identified OsPT8 as an interactor of a rice mitogen-activated protein kinase BWMK1, which is a regulator of disease resistance. Under low phosphate (Pi) conditions, the OsPT8-OX plants display better agronomic traits than the control plants. However, the differences in development between OsPT8-OX and the control plants are reduced upon the increase of Pi concentration. These results demonstrate that OsPT8 regulates the transduction of Pi signaling for development and negatively regulates rice immunity.
NA	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE95 Regulates Phosphate Homeostasis by Affecting Phosphate Transporter Trafficking in Rice[OPEN]	2021	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Phosphate (Pi) uptake in plants depends on plasma membrane (PM)-localized phosphate transporters (PTs). OsCK2 phosphorylates PTs and inhibits their trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the PM in rice (Oryza sativa), but how PTs are dephosphorylated is unknown. We demonstrate that the protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C) protein phosphatase OsPP95 interacts with OsPT2 and OsPT8 and dephosphorylates OsPT8 at Ser-517. Rice plants overexpressing OsPP95 reduced OsPT8 phosphorylation and promoted OsPT2 and OsPT8 trafficking from the ER to the PM, resulting in Pi accumulation. Under Pi-sufficient conditions, Pi levels were lower in young leaves and higher in old leaves in ospp95 mutants than in those of the wild type, even though the overall shoot Pi levels were the same in the mutant and the wild type. In the wild type, OsPP95 accumulated under Pi starvation but was rapidly degraded under Pi-sufficient conditions. We show that OsPHO2 interacts with and induces the degradation of OsPP95. We conclude that OsPP95, a protein phosphatase negatively regulated by OsPHO2, positively regulates Pi homeostasis and remobilization by dephosphorylating PTs and affecting their trafficking to the PM, a reversible process required for adaptation to variable Pi conditions.
NA	High level of zinc triggers phosphorus starvation by inhibiting root-to-shoot translocation and preferential distribution of phosphorus in rice plants	2021	Environ Pollut	Microelement Research Center, College of Resources and Environment, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Since the urbanization and industrialization are wildly spread in recent decades, the concentration of Zn in soil has increased in various regions. Although the interactions between P and Zn has long been recognized, the effect of high level of Zn on P uptake, translocation and distribution in rice and its molecular mechanism are not fully understood. In this study, we conducted both hydroponic culture and field trial with different combined applications of P and Zn to analyze the rice growth and yield, the uptake, translocation and distribution of P and Zn, as well as the P- and Zn-related gene expression levels. Our results showed that high level of Zn decreased the rice biomass and yield production, and inhibited the root-to-shoot translocation and distribution of P into new leaves by down-regulating P transporter genes OsPT2 and OsPT8 in shoot, which was controlled by OsPHR2-OsmiR399-OsPHO2 module. High Zn supply triggered P starvation signal in root, thereafter increased the activities of both root-endogenous and -secreted acid phosphatase to release more Pi, and induced the expression OsPT2 and OsPT8 to uptake more P for plant growth. On the other hand, high level of P significantly decreased the Zn concentrations in both root and shoot, and the root uptake ability of Zn through altering the expression levels of OsZIPs, which were further confirmed by the P high-accumulated mutant osnla1-2 and OsPHR2-OE transgenic plant. Taken together, we revealed the physiological and molecular mechanisms of P-Zn interactions, and proposed a working model of the cross-talk between P and Zn in rice plants. Our results also indicated that appropriate application of P fertilizer is an effective strategy to reduce rice uptake of excessive Zn when grown in Zn-contaminated soil.
