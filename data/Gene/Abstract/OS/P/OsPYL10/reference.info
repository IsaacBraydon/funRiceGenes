NA	Overexpression of ABA Receptor PYL10 Gene Confers Drought and Cold Tolerance to Indica Rice.	2019	Front Plant Sci	Division of Plant Physiology, ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, India.	Abscisic acid (ABA) plays versatile functions in regulating plant development and tolerance to various biotic and abiotic stresses. Towards elucidating the functions of one of the ABA receptors (ABARs) in rice, OsPYL10 was cloned from drought tolerant rice cv. Nagina 22 and was overexpressed under stress inducible RD29A promoter in a mega rice variety MTU1010 by using Agrobacterium mediated genetic transformation. Four single copy transgenic lines selected based on Southern blot analysis were used for physiological and molecular analysis. PYL10 receptor appears to regulate its ligand ABA accumulation as PYL10 overexpressing transgenics accumulated 2-3.3-fold higher levels of ABA than that of WT in flag leaf at anthesis under non-stress conditions. The enhanced accumulation of ABA was associated with enhanced expression of genes for ABA biosynthesis viz., ZEP1, NCED1, NCED2, NCED3, and NCED4 in transgenics than in WT plants. At seedling stage, PYL10 transgenics showed significantly higher survival rate under cold stress as compared with WT plants. qRT-PCR analysis showed that expression levels of cold responsive genes viz., DREB1F, MYB3R2, TPP1, COR410, DEHYDRIN, and LEA3 were significantly higher in PYL10 overexpressing transgenic lines as compared to WT plants under cold stress. PYL10 transgenic and WT plants grown in the same pot were subjected to -80 kPa drought stress and recovery treatments at vegetative and reproductive stages. At vegetative stage drought stress, three overexpressing lines showed significantly higher grain yield (40-58%) and at reproductive stage drought stress one of these overexpression lines showed two-fold higher grain yield than that of WT plants. Excised leaf water loss analysis showed that PYL10 transgenic lost about 20% less water than WT plants. At reproductive stage, OsPYL10 transgenic maintained higher RWC, membrane stability index, chlorophyll content, and accumulated lower amount of MDA and H2O2 as compared with WT plants. qRT-PCR analysis showed that expression levels of RAB16, Dehydrin, LEA3, and ABA45 were higher in PYL10 transgenics as compared with WT plants under drought stress. Thus, overall results showed that OsPYL10 overexpression has potential to improve both drought and cold stress tolerance of indica rice.
NA	OsABT Is Involved in Abscisic Acid Signaling Pathway and Salt Tolerance of Roots at the Rice Seedling Stage.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou 311121, China.	Rice is a staple cereal crop worldwide, and increasing its yields is vital to ensuring global food security. Salinity is a major factor that affects rice yield. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate salt tolerance mechanisms in rice. Proteins containing WD40 repeats play important roles in eukaryotic development and environmental adaptation. Here, we showed that overexpression of OsABT, a gene encoding a WD40-repeat protein, enhanced salt tolerance in rice seedlings by regulating root activity, relative conductivity, malondialdehyde and H(2)O(2) content, and O(2)(â€¢-) production rate. Root ion concentrations indicated that OsABT overexpression lines could maintain lower Na(+) and higher K(+)/Na(+) ratios and upregulated expression of salt-related genes OsSOS1 and OsHAK5 compared with the wild-type (WT) Nipponbare plants. Furthermore, Overexpression of OsABT decreased the abscisic acid (ABA) content, while downregulating the ABA synthesis genes OsNCED3 and OsNCED4 and upregulating the ABA catabolic gene OsABA8ox2. The yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses showed that OsABT interacted with the ABA receptor proteins OsPYL4, OsPYL10, and PP2C phosphatase OsABIL2. A transcriptome analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes between OsABT overexpression lines and WT plants were enriched in plant hormone signal transduction, including ABA signaling pathway under salt stress. Thus, OsABT can improve the salt tolerance in rice seedling roots by inhibiting reactive oxygen species accumulation, thereby regulating the intracellular Na(+)/K(+) balance, ABA content, and ABA signaling pathway.
