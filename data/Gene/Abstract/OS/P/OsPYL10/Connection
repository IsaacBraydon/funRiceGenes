GORI|OsABT	OsPYL10	OsABT Is Involved in Abscisic Acid Signaling Pathway and Salt Tolerance of Roots at the Rice Seedling Stage.	 The yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses showed that OsABT interacted with the ABA receptor proteins OsPYL4, OsPYL10, and PP2C phosphatase OsABIL2
