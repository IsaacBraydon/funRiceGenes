LTN1|OsPHO2|OsRLS1	OsPP95	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE95 Regulates Phosphate Homeostasis by Affecting Phosphate Transporter Trafficking in Rice[OPEN]	 We show that OsPHO2 interacts with and induces the degradation of OsPP95
LTN1|OsPHO2|OsRLS1	OsPP95	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE95 Regulates Phosphate Homeostasis by Affecting Phosphate Transporter Trafficking in Rice[OPEN]	 We conclude that OsPP95, a protein phosphatase negatively regulated by OsPHO2, positively regulates Pi homeostasis and remobilization by dephosphorylating PTs and affecting their trafficking to the PM, a reversible process required for adaptation to variable Pi conditions
OsPht1;2|OsPT2	OsPP95	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE95 Regulates Phosphate Homeostasis by Affecting Phosphate Transporter Trafficking in Rice[OPEN]	 We demonstrate that the protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C) protein phosphatase OsPP95 interacts with OsPT2 and OsPT8 and dephosphorylates OsPT8 at Ser-517
OsPht1;2|OsPT2	OsPP95	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE95 Regulates Phosphate Homeostasis by Affecting Phosphate Transporter Trafficking in Rice[OPEN]	 Rice plants overexpressing OsPP95 reduced OsPT8 phosphorylation and promoted OsPT2 and OsPT8 trafficking from the ER to the PM, resulting in Pi accumulation
OsPht1;8|OsPT8	OsPP95	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE95 Regulates Phosphate Homeostasis by Affecting Phosphate Transporter Trafficking in Rice[OPEN]	 We demonstrate that the protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C) protein phosphatase OsPP95 interacts with OsPT2 and OsPT8 and dephosphorylates OsPT8 at Ser-517
OsPht1;8|OsPT8	OsPP95	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE95 Regulates Phosphate Homeostasis by Affecting Phosphate Transporter Trafficking in Rice[OPEN]	 Rice plants overexpressing OsPP95 reduced OsPT8 phosphorylation and promoted OsPT2 and OsPT8 trafficking from the ER to the PM, resulting in Pi accumulation
OsPP95	XB15|PP2C	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE95 Regulates Phosphate Homeostasis by Affecting Phosphate Transporter Trafficking in Rice[OPEN]	 We demonstrate that the protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C) protein phosphatase OsPP95 interacts with OsPT2 and OsPT8 and dephosphorylates OsPT8 at Ser-517
