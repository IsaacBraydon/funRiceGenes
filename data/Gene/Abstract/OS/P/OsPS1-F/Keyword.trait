OsPS1-F	growth	The OsPS1-F gene regulates growth and development in rice by modulating photosynthetic electron transport rate.	The OsPS1-F gene regulates growth and development in rice by modulating photosynthetic electron transport rate.
OsPS1-F	growth	The OsPS1-F gene regulates growth and development in rice by modulating photosynthetic electron transport rate.	 Our results illustrate that OsPS1-F plays an important role in regulating proper growth and development of rice plants
OsPS1-F	development	The OsPS1-F gene regulates growth and development in rice by modulating photosynthetic electron transport rate.	The OsPS1-F gene regulates growth and development in rice by modulating photosynthetic electron transport rate.
OsPS1-F	development	The OsPS1-F gene regulates growth and development in rice by modulating photosynthetic electron transport rate.	 Our results illustrate that OsPS1-F plays an important role in regulating proper growth and development of rice plants
OsPS1-F	grain	The OsPS1-F gene regulates growth and development in rice by modulating photosynthetic electron transport rate.	Ds insertion in rice OsPS1-F gene results in semi-dwarf plants with reduced tiller number and grain yield, while genetic complementation with OsPS1-F rescued the mutant phenotype
OsPS1-F	tiller	The OsPS1-F gene regulates growth and development in rice by modulating photosynthetic electron transport rate.	Ds insertion in rice OsPS1-F gene results in semi-dwarf plants with reduced tiller number and grain yield, while genetic complementation with OsPS1-F rescued the mutant phenotype
OsPS1-F	grain yield	The OsPS1-F gene regulates growth and development in rice by modulating photosynthetic electron transport rate.	Ds insertion in rice OsPS1-F gene results in semi-dwarf plants with reduced tiller number and grain yield, while genetic complementation with OsPS1-F rescued the mutant phenotype
OsPS1-F	tiller number	The OsPS1-F gene regulates growth and development in rice by modulating photosynthetic electron transport rate.	Ds insertion in rice OsPS1-F gene results in semi-dwarf plants with reduced tiller number and grain yield, while genetic complementation with OsPS1-F rescued the mutant phenotype
OsPS1-F	photosystem	The OsPS1-F gene regulates growth and development in rice by modulating photosynthetic electron transport rate.	 Here, we report the characterization of OsPS1-F (encoding Oryza sativa PHOTOSYSTEM 1-F subunit) using a single copy Ds insertion rice mutant line
