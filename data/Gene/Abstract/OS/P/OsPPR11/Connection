OsCAF2	OsPPR11	OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.	OsPPR11 belongs to the P-type PPR protein family and can interact with OsCAF2 to regulate Group II intron splicing and affect chloroplast development in rice
OsCAF2	OsPPR11	OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.	 The OsPPR11 is required for ndhA, and ycf3-1 introns splicing and interact with CRM family protein OsCAF2, suggesting that these two proteins may form splicing complexes to regulate group II introns splicing
OsCAF2	OsPPR11	OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.	 Further analysis revealed that OsCAF2 interacts with OsPPR11 through the N-terminus
