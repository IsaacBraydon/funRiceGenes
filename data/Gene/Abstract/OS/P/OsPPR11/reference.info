NA	OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.	2022	Plant Cell Rep	State Key Lab of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, People&#x27;s Republic of China.	OsPPR11 belongs to the P-type PPR protein family and can interact with OsCAF2 to regulate Group II intron splicing and affect chloroplast development in rice. Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins participate in chloroplasts or mitochondria group II introns splicing in plants. The PPR protein family contains 491 members in rice, but most of their functions are unknown. In this study, we identified a nuclear gene encoding the P-type PPR protein OsPPR11 in chloroplasts. The qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that OsPPR11 was expressed in all plant tissues, but leaves had the highest expression. The osppr11 mutants had yellowing leaves and a lethal phenotype that inhibited chloroplast development and photosynthesis-related gene expressionÂ and reduced photosynthesis-related protein accumulation in seedlings. Moreover, photosynthetic complex accumulation decreased significantly in osppr11 mutants. The OsPPR11 is required for ndhA, and ycf3-1 introns splicing and interact with CRM family protein OsCAF2, suggesting that these two proteins may form splicing complexes to regulate group II introns splicing. Further analysis revealed that OsCAF2 interacts with OsPPR11 through the N-terminus. These results indicate that OsPPR11 is essential for chloroplast development and function by affecting group II intron splicing in rice.
