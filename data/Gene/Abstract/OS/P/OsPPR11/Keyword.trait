OsPPR11	seedlings	OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.	 The osppr11 mutants had yellowing leaves and a lethal phenotype that inhibited chloroplast development and photosynthesis-related gene expression and reduced photosynthesis-related protein accumulation in seedlings
OsPPR11	chloroplast	OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.	OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.
OsPPR11	chloroplast	OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.	OsPPR11 belongs to the P-type PPR protein family and can interact with OsCAF2 to regulate Group II intron splicing and affect chloroplast development in rice
OsPPR11	chloroplast	OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.
