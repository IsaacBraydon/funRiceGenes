The plant U-box (PUB) protein functions as an E3 ligase to poly-ubiquitinate a target protein for its degradation or post-translational modification. Here, we report functional roles for OsPUB15, which encodes a cytosolic U-box protein in the class-II PUB family. Self-ubiquitination assays showed that bacterially expressed MBP-OsPUB15 protein has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. A T-DNA insertional mutation in OsPUB15 caused severe growth retardation and a seedling-lethal phenotype. Mutant seeds did not produce primary roots, and their shoot development was significantly delayed. Transgenic plants expressing the OsPUB15 antisense transcript phenocopied these mutant characters. The abnormal phenotypes were partially rescued by two antioxidants, catechin and ascorbic acid. Germinating seeds in the dark also recovered the rootless defect. Levels of H2O2 and oxidized proteins were higher in the knock-out mutant compared with the wild type. OsPUB15 transcript levels were increased upon H2O2, salt and drought stresses; plants overexpressing the gene grew better than the wild type under high salinity. These results indicate that PUB15 is a regulator that reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress and cell death.
NA	The E3 ligase OsPUB15 interacts with the receptor-like kinase PID2 and regulates plant cell death and innate immunity.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	Fail	Rice blast disease is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide. We previously cloned the rice blast resistance gene Pid2, which encodes a transmembrane receptor-like kinase containing an extracellular B-lectin domain and an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain. However, little is known about Pid2-mediated signaling.Here we report the functional characterization of the U-box/ARM repeat protein OsPUB15 as one of the PID2-binding proteins. We found that OsPUB15 physically interacted with the kinase domain of PID2 (PID2K) in vitro and in vivo and the ARM repeat domain of OsPUB15 was essential for the interaction. In vitro biochemical assays indicated that PID2K possessed kinase activity and was able to phosphorylate OsPUB15. We also found that the phosphorylated form of OsPUB15 possessed E3 ligase activity. Expression pattern analyses revealed that OsPUB15 was constitutively expressed and its encoded protein OsPUB15 was localized in cytosol. Transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsPUB15 at early stage displayed cell death lesions spontaneously in association with a constitutive activation of plant basal defense responses, including excessive accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, up-regulated expression of pathogenesis-related genes and enhanced resistance to blast strains. We also observed that, along with plant growth, the cell death lesions kept spreading over the whole seedlings quickly resulting in a seedling lethal phenotype.These results reveal that the E3 ligase OsPUB15 interacts directly with the receptor-like kinase PID2 and regulates plant cell death and blast disease resistance.
