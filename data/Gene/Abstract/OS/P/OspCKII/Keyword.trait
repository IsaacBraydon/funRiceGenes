OspCKII	phosphate	Identification and characterization of chloroplast casein kinase II from Oryza sativa (rice).	OspCKII activity shows the characteristic features of casein kinase II, such as the utilization of GTP as phosphate donor, inhibition by low concentrations of heparin and poly-lysine, and utilization of the canonical pCKII motif E-S-E-G-E in the model substrate RNP29
OspCKII	Kinase	Identification and characterization of chloroplast casein kinase II from Oryza sativa (rice).	Transient expression of GFP fused to the 184 N-terminal amino acids of the OspCKII sequence in rice confirmed the chloroplastic localization of the kinase
