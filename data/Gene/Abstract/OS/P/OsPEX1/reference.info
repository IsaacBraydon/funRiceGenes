NA	Rice OsPEX1, an extensin-like protein, affects lignin biosynthesis and plant growth.	2019	Plant Mol Biol	Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Grassland Science, College of Forestry and Landscape Architecture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Rice leucine-rich repeat extensin-like protein OsPEX1 mediates the intersection of lignin deposition and plant growth. Lignin, a major structural component of secondary cell wall, is essential for normal plant growth and development. However, the molecular and genetic regulation of lignin biosynthesis is not fully understood in rice. Here we report the identification and characterization of a rice semi-dominant dwarf mutant (pex1) with stiff culm. Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that the pex1 phenotype was caused by ectopic expression of a leucine-rich repeat extension-like gene, OsPEX1. Interestingly, the pex1 mutant showed significantly higher lignin content and increased expression levels of lignin-related genes compared with wild type plants. Conversely, OsPEX1-suppresssed transgenics displayed low lignin content and reduced transcriptional abundance of genes associated with lignin biosynthesis, indicating that the OsPEX1 mediates lignin biosynthesis and/or deposition in rice. When OsPEX1 was ectopically expressed in rice cultivars with tall stature that lacks the allele of semi-dwarf 1, well-known green revolution gene, the resulting transgenic plants displayed reduced height and enhanced lodging resistance. Our study uncovers a causative effect between the expression of OsPEX1 and lignin deposition. Lastly, we demonstrated that modulating OsPEX1 expression could provide a tool for improving rice lodging resistance.
NA	Effect of extensin-like OsPEX1 on pollen fertility in rice	2021	Yi Chuan	College of Forestry and Landscape Architecture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.	LRXs (leucine-rich repeat extensins) are chimeric cell wall proteins containing an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and a C-terminal extensin domain. Increasing evidences suggest that LRXs family genes play important roles in pollen germination and pollen tube growth in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the functions of rice (Oryza sativa L.) LRX genes in pollen development remain poorly understood. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the rice LRX gene family consist of eight members, namely OsPEX3, OsLRX3 and OsLRX5 located on chromosome 1, OsLRX1, OsLRX3, OsLRX2,OsPEX1 and OsPEX2 located on chromosome 2, 5, 6, 11 and 12, respectively. The OsPEX1 gene is preferentially expressed in rice anther, suggesting that it may be involved in the regulation of pollen development. Next, we further investigated the role of the OsPEX1 gene in rice by knockdown of its expression using an RNAi approach. The OsPEX1 RNAi transgenic lines showed a significant decrease in seed setting rate (10%~30%) due to pollen sterility. Further quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that the OsPEX1 gene was significantly down-regulated in the RNAi transgenic lines. The results indicate that the OsPEX1plays an important role in the regulation of rice pollen development. Further studies on this gene could provide insights on the molecular and genetic mechanisms in this developmental process. 
NA	OsPEX1, an extensin-like protein, negatively regulates root growth in a gibberellin-mediated manner in rice.	2023	Plant Mol Biol	College of Forestry and Landscape Architecture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) are required for plant growth and development through affecting cell growth and cell wall formation. LRX gene family can be classified into two categories: predominantly vegetative-expressed LRX and reproductive-expressed PEX. In contrast to the tissue specificity of Arabidopsis PEX genes in reproductive organs, rice OsPEX1 is also highly expressed in roots in addition to reproductive tissue. However, whether and how OsPEX1 affects root growth is unclear. Here, we found that overexpression of OsPEX1 retarded root growth by reducing cell elongation likely caused by an increase of lignin deposition, whereas knockdown of OsPEX1 had an opposite effect on root growth, indicating that OsPEX1 negatively regulated root growth in rice. Further investigation uncovered the existence of a feedback loop between OsPEX1 expression level and GA biosynthesis for proper root growth. This was supported by the facts that exogenous GA(3) application downregulated transcript levels of OsPEX1 and lignin-related genes and rescued the root developmental defects of the OsPEX1 overexpression mutant, whereas OsPEX1 overexpression reduced GA level and the expression of GA biosynthesis genes. Moreover, OsPEX1 and GA showed antagonistic action on the lignin biosynthesis in root. OsPEX1 overexpression upregulated transcript levels of lignin-related genes, whereas exogenous GA(3) application downregulated their expression. Taken together, this study reveals a possible molecular pathway of OsPEX1mediated regulation of root growth through coordinate modulation of lignin deposition via a negative feedback regulation between OsPEX1 expression and GA biosynthesis.
