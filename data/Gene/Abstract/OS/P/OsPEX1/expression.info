OsPEX1	 Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that the pex1 phenotype was caused by ectopic expression of a leucine-rich repeat extension-like gene, OsPEX1 |  Our study uncovers a causative effect between the expression of OsPEX1 and lignin deposition |  Lastly, we demonstrated that modulating OsPEX1 expression could provide a tool for improving rice lodging resistance
