NA	PINOID is required for formation of the stigma and style in rice.	2019	Plant Physiol	Huazhong Agricultural University CITY: Wuhan China [CN].	The stigma is the entry point for sexual reproduction in plants, but the mechanisms underlying stigma development are largely unknown. Here, we disrupted putative auxin biosynthetic and signaling genes to evaluate their roles in rice (Oryza sativa) development. Disruption of the rice PINOID (OsPID) gene completely eliminated the development of stigmas, and overexpression of OsPID led to over-proliferation of stigmas, suggesting that OsPID is a key determinant for stigma development. Interestingly, ospid mutants did not display defects in flower initiation, nor did they develop any pin-like inflorescences, a characteristic phenotype observed in pid mutants in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and maize (Zea mays). We constructed double mutants of OsPID and its closest homolog, OsPIDb, yet the double mutants still did not develop any pin-like inflorescences, indicating that either ospid is compensated by additional homologous genes or OsPID has different functions in rice compared to PID in other organisms. We then knocked out one of the NAKED PINS IN YUC MUTANTS 1 (NPY) genes, which cause the formation of pin-like inflorescences in Arabidopsis when compromised, in the ospid background. The ospid osnyp2 double mutants developed pin-like inflorescences, which were phenotypically similar to pid mutants in Arabidopsis and maize, demonstrating that the roles of OsPID in inflorescence development are likely masked by redundant partners. This work identified a key determinant for stigma development in rice and revealed a complex picture of the PID gene in rice development. Furthermore, the stigma-less ospid mutants are potentially useful in producing hybrid rice.
