OsPID|OsPINOID	OsPIDb	PINOID is required for formation of the stigma and style in rice.	 We constructed double mutants of OsPID and its closest homolog, OsPIDb, yet the double mutants still did not develop any pin-like inflorescences, indicating that either ospid is compensated by additional homologous genes or OsPID has different functions in rice compared to PID in other organisms
