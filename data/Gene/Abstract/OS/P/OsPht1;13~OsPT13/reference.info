4236.pdf	Nonredundant regulation of rice arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by two members of the phosphate transporter1 gene family	2012	Plant Cell	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Lausane, CH-1015 Lausane, Switzerland.	Pi acquisition of crops via arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is becoming increasingly important due to limited high-grade rock Pi reserves and a demand for environmentally sustainable agriculture. Here, we show that 70% of the overall Pi acquired by rice (Oryza sativa) is delivered via the symbiotic route. To better understand this pathway, we combined genetic, molecular, and physiological approaches to determine the specific functions of two symbiosis-specific members of the PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1 (PHT1) gene family from rice, ORYsa;PHT1;11 (PT11) and ORYsa;PHT1;13 (PT13). The PT11 lineage of proteins from mono- and dicotyledons is most closely related to homologs from the ancient moss, indicating an early evolutionary origin. By contrast, PT13 arose in the Poaceae, suggesting that grasses acquired a particular strategy for the acquisition of symbiotic Pi. Surprisingly, mutations in either PT11 or PT13 affected the development of the symbiosis, demonstrating that both genes are important for AM symbiosis. For symbiotic Pi uptake, however, only PT11 is necessary and sufficient. Consequently, our results demonstrate that mycorrhizal rice depends on the AM symbiosis to satisfy its Pi demands, which is mediated by a single functional Pi transporter, PT11.

Considering the sequenced rice genome at hand, only the Oryza sativa phosphate transporter (OsPT) gene OsPT11 was specifically induced during the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. This induction was confined to the root system and was tightly correlated with the degree of root colonization by Glomus intraradices. OsPT11 activation was independent of the nutritional status of the plant and phosphate availability in the rhizosphere. Moreover, infection of roots with the fungal pathogens Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium moniliforme did not activate OsPT11, corroborating the high signal specificity for OsPT11 activation in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. OsPT11 expression complemented a defect in phosphate uptake in a yeast strain mutated in its high-affinity P(i) transporter (pho84), thereby confirming its function. Recently, a phosphate transporter gene in potato was shown to be induced during arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Assessment of the phylogenetic relationship of the rice and potato protein revealed that the rice is nonorthologous to the potato protein. Further, there are no structural commonalities in the promoter regions. Thus, although cytological and physiological features of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis seem to be conserved, the molecular components may differ significantly between distantly related plant species.
NA	Trait variations and expression profiling of OsPHT1 gene family at the early growth-stages under phosphorus-limited conditions	2021	Sci Rep	Crop Improvement Division, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)-National Rice Research Institute (NRRI), Cuttack, Odisha, 753006, India. anandanau@yahoo.com.	To better understand the early response of genotypes to limited-phosphorus (P) conditions and the role of the phosphate transporter OsPHT1 gene family in the presence of PSTOL1, it is essential to characterize the level of tolerance in rice under limited-P conditions. In the present experiment, six rice genotypes were studied in three-way interactions [genotype (G) ¡Á phosphorus (P) ¡Á duration (D)] by comparing them at two instances (14 d and 28 d) under seven different concentrations of P (0.5<U+2012>10.0 ppm) in a hydroponic system. Trait differences and interactions of these traits were clearly distinguished among the various P rates. However, aboveground trait expression registered increased growth from 6.0 to 10.0 ppm of P. The major root-attributed traits in 0.5 ppm of P are significantly increased vis-¨¤-vis 10 ppm of P. Analysis of variance displayed a significant difference between the genotypes for PSTOL1 and PHT1 expression. In low P, maximum root length with a shoot and root dry weight was observed in a new indigenous accession, IC459373, with higher expression of PSTOL1 than in Dular and IR64-Pup1 in 0.5 ppm of P at 14 d. Among the 13 PHT1 genes, OsPT1, OsPT2, OsPT6, and OsPT13 showed significant upregulation in IC459373, Dular, and IR64-Pup1. These results indicated that studying the expression levels of the PSTOL1 and PHT1 gene family at the early growth stages would be helpful in identifying superior donors to improve low-P tolerance and P-use efficiency in rice breeding programs.
