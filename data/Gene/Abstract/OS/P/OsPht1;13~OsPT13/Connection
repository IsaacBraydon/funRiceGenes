OsPht1;11|OsPT11	OsPht1;13|OsPT13	Nonredundant regulation of rice arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by two members of the phosphate transporter1 gene family	To better understand this pathway, we combined genetic, molecular, and physiological approaches to determine the specific functions of two symbiosis-specific members of the PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1 (PHT1) gene family from rice, ORYsa;PHT1;11 (PT11) and ORYsa;PHT1;13 (PT13)
OsPht1;11|OsPT11	OsPht1;13|OsPT13	Nonredundant regulation of rice arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by two members of the phosphate transporter1 gene family	Surprisingly, mutations in either PT11 or PT13 affected the development of the symbiosis, demonstrating that both genes are important for AM symbiosis

OsPht1;13|OsPT13	OsPht1;2|OsPT2	Trait variations and expression profiling of OsPHT1 gene family at the early growth-stages under phosphorus-limited conditions	 Among the 13 PHT1 genes, OsPT1, OsPT2, OsPT6, and OsPT13 showed significant upregulation in IC459373, Dular, and IR64-Pup1
