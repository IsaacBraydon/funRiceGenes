OsATH1	OsPrx30	The Class III Peroxidase gene OsPrx30, Transcriptionally Modulated by the AT-hook Protein OsATH1, Mediates Rice Bacterial Blight-induced ROS Accumulation	The Class III Peroxidase gene OsPrx30, Transcriptionally Modulated by the AT-hook Protein OsATH1, Mediates Rice Bacterial Blight-induced ROS Accumulation
OsATH1	OsPrx30	The Class III Peroxidase gene OsPrx30, Transcriptionally Modulated by the AT-hook Protein OsATH1, Mediates Rice Bacterial Blight-induced ROS Accumulation	Finally, we demonstrated that depletion of OsATH1 increased histone H3 acetylation at the AT-rich region of the OsPrx30 promoter.
