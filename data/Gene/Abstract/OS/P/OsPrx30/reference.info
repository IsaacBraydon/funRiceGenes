Class III peroxidases (CIII Prxs) play critical roles in plant immunity by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the functions of CIII Prxs in rice (Oryza sativa L.) immunity are largely unexplored. Here, we report a Prx precursor, OsPrx30, that is responsive to the bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). OsPrx30 was primarily expressed in rice roots, leaves, and stems, and its protein product was mainly localized at the endoplasmic reticulum. Overexpression of OsPrx30 enhanced the plant's susceptibility to Xoo by maintaining a high level of peroxidase (POD) activity and reducing the content of H2 O2 , while depletion of OsPrx30 had the opposite effects. Furthermore, we identified an AT-hook transcription factor, OsATH1, that specifically bound to the OsPrx30 promoter. As observed in plants overexpressing OsPrx30, depletion of OsATH1 enhanced susceptibility to Xoo. Finally, we demonstrated that depletion of OsATH1 increased histone H3 acetylation at the AT-rich region of the OsPrx30 promoter. Taken together, these results reveal a mechanism underlying the POD-induced natural resistance to bacterial diseases and suggest a model for transcription regulation of Prx genes in rice.
