OsPrx30	transcription factor	The Class III Peroxidase gene OsPrx30, Transcriptionally Modulated by the AT-hook Protein OsATH1, Mediates Rice Bacterial Blight-induced ROS Accumulation	 Furthermore, we identified an AT-hook transcription factor, OsATH1, that specifically bound to the OsPrx30 promoter
OsPrx30	 xoo 	The Class III Peroxidase gene OsPrx30, Transcriptionally Modulated by the AT-hook Protein OsATH1, Mediates Rice Bacterial Blight-induced ROS Accumulation	 Overexpression of OsPrx30 enhanced the plant's susceptibility to Xoo by maintaining a high level of peroxidase (POD) activity and reducing the content of H2 O2 , while depletion of OsPrx30 had the opposite effects
