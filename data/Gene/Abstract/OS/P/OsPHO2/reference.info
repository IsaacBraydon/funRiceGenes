Previous research using forward genetics approaches demonstrated that OsPHO2 regulates multiple phosphate-starvation responses in rice. In this work, we finely characterized two independent OsPHO2 knockout rice mutants under inorganic phosphate (Pi)-sufficient conditions. The ospho2 mutants exhibited defects in growth and reproductive development in the whole growing period. The cells in the elongation zone of ospho2 seedling roots were much shorter than those of the wild type. The phosphorus concentration in the blades of ospho2 mutants was 5.8-fold higher than those of wild-type plants, whereas it was only slightly higher in the sheaths, culms, spikelets, and seeds. Furthermore, Pi levels in the ospho2 mutants were highest in the oldest leaf and lowest in the youngest leaf, whereas there was no significant difference in the corresponding leaves of wild-type plants. These results suggest that ospho2 mutant phenotype results from a partial defect in Pi translocation and remobilization in the shoot of rice. This study thus provides evidence that OsPHO2, which functions at the downstream of OsPHF1, modulates Pi utilization by regulating the expression of Pht1 transporters in rice.

Plants have evolved adaptive regulatory mechanisms to maintain phosphate (Pi) homeostasis by improving phosphorus uptake, translocation, remobilization and efficiency of use. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of the OsPHR2-mediated phosphate-signaling pathway in rice. OsPHR2 positively regulates the low-affinity Pi transporter OsPT2 through physical interaction and reciprocal regulation of OsPHO2 in roots. OsPT2 is responsible for most of the OsPHR2-mediated accumulation of excess Pi in shoots. OsSPX1 acts as a repressor in the OsPHR2-mediated phosphate-signaling pathway. Some mutants screened from ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized M2 population of OsPHR2 overexpression transgenic line removed the growth inhibition, indicating that some unknown factors are crucial for Pi utilization or plant growth under the regulation of OsPHR2.
9fcfd50a105b36339e.pdf	OsSPX1 suppresses the function of OsPHR2 in the regulation of expression of OsPT2 and phosphate homeostasis in shoots of rice	2010	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in plants is required for plant growth and development, and is achieved by the coordination of Pi acquisition, translocation from roots to shoots, and remobilization within plants. Previous reports have demonstrated that over-expression of OsPHR2 (the homolog of AtPHR1) and knockdown of OsSPX1 result in accumulation of excessive shoot Pi in rice. Here we report that OsPHR2 positively regulates the low-affinity Pi transporter gene OsPT2 by physical interaction and upstream regulation of OsPHO2 in roots. OsPT2 is responsible for most of the OsPHR2-mediated accumulation of excess shoot Pi. OsSPX1 suppresses the regulation on expression of OsPT2 by OsPHR2 and the accumulation of excess shoot Pi, but it does not suppress induction of OsPT2 or the accumulation of excessive shoot Pi in the Ospho2 mutant. Our data also show that OsSPX1 is a negative regulator of OsPHR2 and is involved in the feedback of Pi-signaling network in roots that is defined by OsPHR2 and OsPHO2. This finding provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism of Pi uptake, translocation, allocation and homeostasis in plants.
j.1365-313X.2008.03734.x.pdf	Involvement of OsSPX1 in phosphate homeostasis in rice	2009	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Arabidopsis thaliana SPX (SYG/PHO81/XPR1) domain genes have recently been shown to be involved in the phosphate (Pi) signaling pathway. We show here that a rice (Oryza sativa) SPX gene, OsSPX1, is specifically induced by Pi starvation in roots. Suppression of OsSPX1 by RNA interference resulted in severe signs of toxicity caused by the over-accumulation of Pi, similar to that found in OsPHR2 (phosphate starvation response transcription factor 2) overexpressors and pho2 (phosphate-responsive mutant 2). Quantitative RT-PCR showed that expression of OsSPX1 was strongly induced in OsPHR2 overexpression and pho2 mutant plants, indicating that OsSPX1 occurs downstream of OsPHR2 and PHO2. The expression of 10 genes associated with the phosphate-starvation signal pathways was analyzed. Expression of OsPT2 (phosphate transporter 2) and OsPT8 was significantly induced in OsSPX1-RNAi (OsSPX1-Ri) plants, suggesting that over-accumulation of Pi in OsSPX1-Ri plants results from an increase in Pi transport. In contrast, overexpression of OsSPX1 suppressed the induction of expression by Pi starvation of all 10 phosphate starvation-induced genes tested: IPS1 (induced by phosphate starvation 1), IPS2, OsPAP10 (purple acid phosphatase 10), OsSQD2 (sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2), miR399d and miR399j (microRNA 399), OsPT2, OsPT3, OsPT6 and OsPT8. This suggests that OsSPX1 acts via a negative feedback loop to optimize growth under phosphate-limited conditions.
j.1744-7909.2009.00834.x.pdf	Regulation of OsSPX1 and OsSPX3 on expression of OsSPX domain genes and Pi-starvation signaling in rice	2009	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	The rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome contains at least six genes exclusively with an SPX (SYG1/PHO81/XPR1) domain at the N-terminal, designated as OsSPX1-6. Here we report the diverse expression patterns of the OsSPX genes in different tissues and their responses to Pi-starvation. Among them, five genes, OsSPX1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 are responsive to Pi-starvation in shoots and/or in roots. The subcellular localization analysis indicates that OsSPX1 and OsSPX2 is exclusively located in nucleus, OsSPX3 in the cytoplasm, and OsSPX4 is a membrane localization protein. OsSPX1 regulates OsSPX2, 3 and 5 at the transcription level and is positively involved in the responses of the genes to Pi-starvation. Overexpression of OsSPX3 downregulates OsSPX5 in shoots under Pi-sufficiency. OsSPX3 negatively regulates the PSI (Pi-starvation induced) gene, OsIPS1 and is involved in the responses of miR399 and OsPHO2 to Pi-starvation. Our results suggest that OsSPX1 may be a regulator involved in the transcriptions of OsSPX2, 3 and 5. OsSPX3 plays a role in OsIPS1/miR399 mediated long distance regulation on OsPHO2. Our results also indicate that OsSPX3 is involved in plant tolerance to Pi-starvation stress.
journal.pone.0081849.pdf	Down-regulation of OsSPX1 causes high sensitivity to cold and oxidative stresses in rice seedlings	2013	PLoS One	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.	Rice SPX domain gene, OsSPX1, plays an important role in the phosphate (Pi) signaling network. Our previous work showed that constitutive overexpression of OsSPX1 in tobacco and Arabidopsis plants improved cold tolerance while also decreasing total leaf Pi. In the present study, we generated rice antisense and sense transgenic lines of OsSPX1 and found that down-regulation of OsSPX1 caused high sensitivity to cold and oxidative stresses in rice seedlings. Compared to wild-type and OsSPX1-sense transgenic lines, more hydrogen peroxide accumulated in seedling leaves of OsSPX1-antisense transgenic lines for controls, cold and methyl viologen (MV) treatments. Glutathione as a ROS scavenger could protect the antisense transgenic lines from cold and MV stress. Rice whole genome GeneChip analysis showed that some oxidative-stress marker genes (e.g. glutathione S-transferase and P450s) and Pi-signaling pathway related genes (e.g. OsPHO2) were significantly down-regulated by the antisense of OsSPX1. The microarray results were validated by real-time RT-PCR. Our study indicated that OsSPX1 may be involved in cross-talks between oxidative stress, cold stress and phosphate homeostasis in rice seedling leaves.
nph12499.pdf	Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa)	2014	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Phosphorus (P) is crucial nutrient element for crop growth and development. However, the network pathway regulating homeostasis of phosphate (Pi) in crops has many molecular breeding unknowns. Here, we report that an auxin response factor, OsARF12, functions in Pi homeostasis. Measurement of element content, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis and acid phosphatases (APases) activity assay showed that the osarf12 mutant and osarf12/25 double mutant with P-intoxicated phenotypes had higher P concentrations, up-regulation of the Pi transporter encoding genes and increased APase activity under Pi-sufficient/-deficient (+Pi/-Pi, 0.32/0 mM NaH2 PO4) conditions. Transcript analysis revealed that Pi-responsive genes--Phosphate starvation (OsIPS)1 and OsIPS2, SYG1/Pho81/XPR1(OsSPX1), Sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2 (OsSQD2), R2R3 MYB transcription factor (OsMYB2P-1) and Transport Inhibitor Response1 (OsTIR1)--were more abundant in the osarf12 and osarf12/25 mutants under +Pi/-Pi conditions. Knockout of OsARF12 also influenced the transcript abundances of the OsPHR2 gene and its downstream components, such as OsMiR399j, OsPHO2, OsMiR827, OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2. Results from -Pi/1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) treatments, and auxin reporter DR5::GUS staining suggest that root system alteration and Pi-induced auxin response were at least partially controlled by OsARF12. These findings enrich our understanding of the biological functions of OsARF12, which also acts in regulating Pi homeostasis.
Plant Physiol.-2011-Hu-1101-15.pdf	LEAF TIP NECROSIS1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of multiple phosphate starvation responses in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Although phosphate (Pi) starvation signaling is well studied in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), it is still largely unknown in rice (Oryza sativa). In this work, a rice leaf tip necrosis1 (ltn1) mutant was identified and characterized. Map-based cloning identified LTN1 as LOC_Os05g48390, the putative ortholog of Arabidopsis PHO2, which plays important roles in Pi starvation signaling. Analysis of transgenic plants harboring a LTN1 promoter::beta-glucuronidase construct revealed that LTN1 was preferentially expressed in vascular tissues. The ltn1 mutant exhibited increased Pi uptake and translocation, which led to Pi overaccumulation in shoots. In association with enhanced Pi uptake and transport, some Pi transporters were up-regulated in the ltn1 mutant in the presence of sufficient Pi. Furthermore, the elongation of primary and adventitious roots was enhanced in the ltn1 mutant under Pi starvation, suggesting that LTN1 is involved in Pi-dependent root architecture alteration. Under Pi-sufficient conditions, typical Pi starvation responses such as stimulation of phosphatase and RNase activities, lipid composition alteration, nitrogen assimilation repression, and increased metal uptake were also activated in ltn1. Moreover, analysis of OsmiR399-overexpressing plants showed that LTN1 was down-regulated by OsmiR399. Our results strongly indicate that LTN1 is a crucial Pi starvation signaling component downstream of miR399 involved in the regulation of multiple Pi starvation responses in rice.
Plant Physiol.-2012-Sun-1571-81.pdf	A constitutive expressed phosphate transporter, OsPht1;1, modulates phosphate uptake and translocation in phosphate-replete rice	2012	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	A number of phosphate (Pi) starvation- or mycorrhiza-regulated Pi transporters belonging to the Pht1 family have been functionally characterized in several plant species, whereas functions of the Pi transporters that are not regulated by changes in Pi supply are lacking. In this study, we show that rice (Oryza sativa) Pht1;1 (OsPT1), one of the 13 Pht1 Pi transporters in rice, was expressed abundantly and constitutively in various cell types of both roots and shoots. OsPT1 was able to complement the proton-coupled Pi transporter activities in a yeast mutant defective in Pi uptake. Transgenic plants of OsPT1 overexpression lines and RNA interference knockdown lines contained significantly higher and lower phosphorus concentrations, respectively, compared with the wild-type control in Pi-sufficient shoots. These responses of the transgenic plants to Pi supply were further confirmed by the changes in depolarization of root cell membrane potential, root hair occurrence, (33)P uptake rate and transportation, as well as phosphorus accumulation in young leaves at Pi-sufficient levels. Furthermore, OsPT1 expression was strongly enhanced by the mutation of Phosphate Overaccumulator2 (OsPHO2) but not by Phosphate Starvation Response2, indicating that OsPT1 is involved in the OsPHO2-regulated Pi pathway. These results indicate that OsPT1 is a key member of the Pht1 family involved in Pi uptake and translocation in rice under Pi-replete conditions.
NA	Molecular interaction between PHO2 and GI in rice.	2017	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, P. R. China.	Plants are often confronted to nutrient limiting conditions, such as inorganic phosphate (Pi) deficiency, resulting in a reduction in growth and yield. PHO2, encoding a ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme, is a central component of the Pi-starvation response signaling pathway. A yeast-two-hybrid screen using Oryza sativa (rice) PHO2 as bait, revealed an interaction between OsPHO2 and OsGIGANTEA, a key regulator of flowering time, which was confirmed using bimolecular flourescenec complementation (BiFC). Characterization of rice Osgi and Ospho2 mutants revealed that they displayed several similar phenotypic features supporting a physiological role for this interaction. Reduced growth, leaf tip necrosis, delayed flowering and over-accumulation of Pi in leaves compared to wild-type were shared features of Osgi and Ospho2 plants. Pi analysis of individual leaves demonstrated that Osgi, similar to Ospho2 mutants, were impaired in Pi remobilization from old to young leaves, albeit to a lesser extent. Transcriptome analyses revealed more than 55% of the genes differentially expressed in Osgi plants overlapped with the set of differentially expressed genes in Ospho2 plants. The interaction between OsPHO2 and OsGI links high-level regulators of Pi homeostasis and development in rice.
NA	Knocking Out the Gene RLS1 Induces Hypersensitivity to Oxidative Stress and Premature Leaf Senescence in Rice.	2018	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China. chenguang0066@126.com.	Improving a plant's level of tolerance to oxidative stress can frequently also enhance its tolerance to several other abiotic stresses. Here, a screen of a japonica type rice T-DNA insertion mutant library identified a highly oxidative stress-sensitive mutant. The line exhibited premature leaf senescence, starting at the three-leaf stage, and the symptoms were particularly severe from the five-leaf stage onwards. The leaves progressively lost chlorophyll, suffered protein degradation and were compromised with respect to their photosynthetic activity; their leaf mesophyll and bulliform cells became shrunken, and several senescence-associated genes (SAGs), senescence-associated transcription factor genes (SATFs) and autophagy-related genes (ATGs) were progressively up-regulated. The product of the gene inactivated by the mutation, identified via positional cloning, was putatively a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The gene was denoted here as RLS1 (reactive oxygen species-sensitive leaf senescence1). The phenotype of plants in which RLS1 was knocked down using RNA interference was comparable to that of the rls1 mutant. A comparative analysis of the knock-out line and the wild type leaves showed that the former accumulated more hydrogen peroxide and more malondialdehyde, expressed a heightened level of superoxide dismutase activity and a decreased level of catalase activity, and exhibited an altered transcriptional profile with respect to several SAGs, SATFs and ATGs, and that these effects were magnified when the plants were exposed to oxidative stress. The product of RLS1 is presumed to be a critical component of the rice oxidative stress response and is involved in ROS (reactive oxygen species)-mediated leaf senescence.
NA	Phosphate-Starvation-Inducible S-Like RNase Genes in Rice Are Involved in Phosphate Source Recycling by RNA Decay	2020	Front Plant Sci	Graduate School of Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, South Korea.	The fine-tuning of inorganic phosphate (Pi) for enhanced use efficiency has long been a challenging subject in agriculture, particularly in regard to rice as a major crop plant. Among ribonucleases (RNases), the RNase T2 family is broadly distributed across kingdoms, but little has been known on its substrate specificity compared to RNase A and RNase T1 families. Class I and class II of the RNase T2 family are defined as the S-like RNase (RNS) family and have showed the connection to Pi recycling in Arabidopsis. In this study, we first carried out a phylogenetic analysis of eight rice and five Arabidopsis RNS genes and identified mono-specific class I and dicot-specific class I RNS genes, suggesting the possibility of functional diversity between class I RNS family members in monocot and dicot species through evolution. We then compared the in silico expression patterns of all RNS genes in rice and Arabidopsis under normal and Pi-deficient conditions and further confirmed the expression patterns of rice RNS genes via qRT-PCR analysis. Subsequently, we found that most of the OsRNS genes were differentially regulated under Pi-deficient treatment. Association of Pi recycling by RNase activity in rice was confirmed by measuring total RNA concentration and ribonuclease activity of shoot and root samples under Pi-sufficient or Pi-deficient treatment during 21 days. The total RNA concentrations were decreased by < 60% in shoots and < 80% in roots under Pi starvation, respectively, while ribonuclease activity increased correspondingly. We further elucidate the signaling pathway of Pi starvation through upregulation of the OsRNS genes. The 2-kb promoter region of all OsRNS genes with inducible expression patterns under Pi deficiency contains a high frequency of P1BS cis-acting regulatory element (CRE) known as the OsPHR2 binding site, suggesting that the OsRNS family is likely to be controlled by OsPHR2. Finally, the dynamic transcriptional regulation of OsRNS genes by overexpression of OsPHR2, ospho2 mutant, and overexpression of OsPT1 lines involved in Pi signaling pathway suggests the molecular basis of OsRNS family in Pi recycling via RNA decay under Pi starvation.
