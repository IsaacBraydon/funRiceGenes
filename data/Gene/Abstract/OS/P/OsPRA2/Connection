D61|OsBRI1	OsPRA2	A Small G Protein as a Novel Component of the Rice Brassinosteroid Signal Transduction.	More importantly, OsPRA2 was found to co-localize with and directly bind to rice BR receptor BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1 (OsBRI1) on the plasma membrane
D61|OsBRI1	OsPRA2	A Small G Protein as a Novel Component of the Rice Brassinosteroid Signal Transduction.	Together, these results revealed a possible working mechanism of OsPRA2 as a novel negative regulator on OsBRI1 and OsBZR1 in the BR signaling pathway in rice, and further extended the knowledge about the regulatory mechanism of rice BR signaling
OsBZR1	OsPRA2	A Small G Protein as a Novel Component of the Rice Brassinosteroid Signal Transduction.	Mechanistic study uncovered that OsPRA2 inhibited the dephosphorylation of, and thus inactivated the transcription factor BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (OsBZR1)
OsBZR1	OsPRA2	A Small G Protein as a Novel Component of the Rice Brassinosteroid Signal Transduction.	Together, these results revealed a possible working mechanism of OsPRA2 as a novel negative regulator on OsBRI1 and OsBZR1 in the BR signaling pathway in rice, and further extended the knowledge about the regulatory mechanism of rice BR signaling
