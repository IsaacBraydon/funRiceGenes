Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of steroid hormones that are essential for plant growth and development. The BR signal transduction pathway in the dicot model plant Arabidopsis is well established, but the components connecting the BR signaling steps in rice have not been fully explored. For example, how the BR signaling is fine-tuned in rice, especially at the BR receptor level, is largely unknown. Here, we show that OsPRA2, a rice small G protein, plays a repressive role in the BR signaling pathway. Lamina inclination, coleoptile elongation, and root inhibition assays indicated that rice plants with suppressed expression of OsPRA2 were more sensitive to exogenously applied brassinolide than wild-type plants. Conversely, rice overexpressing OsPRA2 was less sensitive to exogenous brassinolide. Mechanistic study uncovered that OsPRA2 inhibited the dephosphorylation of, and thus inactivated the transcription factor BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (OsBZR1). More importantly, OsPRA2 was found to co-localize with and directly bind to rice BR receptor BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1 (OsBRI1) on the plasma membrane. In vitro assays further indicated that OsPRA2 inhibit its autophosphorylation. This OsPRA2-OsBRI1 interaction led to the dissociation of OsBRI1 from its co-receptor OsBAK1, and abolished OsBRI1-mediated phosphorylation of OsBAK1. Together, these results revealed a possible working mechanism of OsPRA2 as a novel negative regulator on OsBRI1 and OsBZR1 in the BR signaling pathway in rice, and further extended the knowledge about the regulatory mechanism of rice BR signaling.

Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a kind of plant hormones that regulate many important agronomic traits. Although the framework of the BR signaling pathway has been outlined, detailed working mechanisms at several steps of this pathway, especially at the BR receptor level, need to be further elucidated. Recently we have reported that a rice small G protein, OsPRA2, bound to the BR receptor OsBRI1 at the plasma membrane (PM) and inhibited its kinase activity and its interaction with the co-receptor OsBAK1, leading to a lower sensitivity to BR treatment and dephosphorylation of OsBZR1. In this follow-up study, we identified an OsPRA2-interacting protein through yeast 2 hybrid system, which is annotated as a C2-domain containing GTPase activating protein (OsGAP1). Overexpression of OsGAP1 in Arabidopsis resulted in a phenotype mimic to BR-deficiency, implying that the GTPase activity of OsPRA2 is also involved in regulating BR signaling. In addition, we observed that, besides colocalizing at the PM, OsPRA2 was also colocalized with OsBRI1 in small granules near PM, suggesting that the function of OsPRA2 in vesicle traffic may contribute to the regulation of OsBRI1.
