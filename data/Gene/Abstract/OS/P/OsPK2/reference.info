NA	OsPK2 encodes a plastidic pyruvate kinase involved in rice endosperm starch synthesis, compound granule formation and grain filling.	2018	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, China.	Starch is the main form of energy storage in higher plants. Although several enzymes and regulators of starch biosynthesis have been defined, the complete molecular machinery remains largely unknown. Screening for irregularities in endosperm formation in rice represents valuable prospect for studying starch synthesis pathway. Here, we identified a novel rice white-core endosperm and defective grain filling mutant, ospk2, which displays significantly lower grain weight, decreased starch content and alteration of starch physicochemical properties when compared to wild-type grains. The normal starch compound granules were drastically reduced and more single granules filled the endosperm cells of ospk2. Meanwhile, the germination rate of ospk2 seeds after one year storage was observably reduced compared to wild-type. Map-based cloning of OsPK2 indicated that it encodes a pyruvate kinase (PK, ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotranferase, EC 2.7.1.40), which catalyzes an irreversible step of glycolysis. OsPK2 has a constitutive expression in rice and its protein localizes in chloroplasts. Enzyme assay showed that the protein product from expressed OsPK2 and the crude protein extracted from tissues of wild-type exhibits strong PK activity however the mutant presented reduced protein activity. OsPK2 (PKp¦Á1) and three other putative rice plastidic isozymes, PKp¦Á2, PKp¦Â1 and PKp¦Â2 can interact to form heteromer. Moreover, the mutation leads to multiple metabolic disorders. Altogether, these results denote new insights into the role of OsPK2 in plant seed development, especially in starch synthesis, compound granules formation and grain filling, which would be useful for genetic improvement of high yield and rice grain quality.

NA	OsPKp¦Á1 encodes a plastidic pyruvate kinase that affects starch biosynthesis in the rice endosperm.	2018	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Pyruvate kinase (PK) is a key enzyme in glycolysis and carbon metabolism. Here, we isolated a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, w59, with a white-core floury endosperm. Map-based cloning of w59 identified a mutation in OsPKp¦Á1, which encodes a plastidic isoform of PK (PKp). OsPKp¦Á1 localizes to the amyloplast stroma in the developing endosperm, and the mutation of OsPKp¦Á1 in w59 decreases the plastidic PK activity, resulting in dramatic changes to the lipid biosynthesis in seeds. The w59 grains were also characterized by a marked decrease in starch content. Consistent with a decrease in number and size of the w59 amyloplasts, large empty spaces were observed in the central region of the w59 endosperm, at the early grain-filling stage. Moreover, a phylogenetic analysis revealed four potential rice isoforms of OsPKp. We validated the in vitro PK activity of these OsPKps through reconstituting active PKp complexes derived from inactive individual OsPKps, revealing the heteromeric structure of rice PKps, which was further confirmed using a protein-protein interaction analysis. These findings suggest a functional connection between lipid and starch synthesis in rice endosperm amyloplasts.
