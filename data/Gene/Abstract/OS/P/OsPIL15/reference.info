In plants, flowering as a crucial developmental event is highly regulated by both genetic programs and environmental signals. Genetic analysis of flowering time mutants is instrumental in dissecting the regulatory pathways of flowering induction. In this study, we isolated the OsLF gene by its association with the T-DNA insertion in the rice late flowering mutant named A654. The OsLF gene encodes an atypical HLH protein composed of 419 amino acids (aa). Overexpression of the OsLF gene in wild type rice recapitulated the late flowering phenotype of A654, indicating that the OsLF gene negatively regulates flowering. Flowering genes downstream of OsPRR1 such as OsGI and Hd1 were down regulated in the A654 mutant. Yeast two hybrid and colocalization assays revealed that OsLF interacts strongly with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 that are potentially involved in light signaling. In addition, OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 colocalize with OsPRR1, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis APRR1 gene that controls photoperiodic flowering response through clock function. Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and Hd1 by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 and thus induce late flowering.
71_1183.pdf	Characterization of a Set of Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like bHLH Proteins inOryza sativa	2014	Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry	Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, School of Agriculture, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan.	The model dicotyledon Arabidopsis thaliana has a characteristic small sub-family of phytochrome-interacting bHLH (basic Helix-Loop-Helix) factors, which are collectively designated the PIL (or PIF) (PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR-LIKE) family proteins. In this study, we identified and characterized a set of highly homologous members (designated OsPIL11 to OsPIL16) in the model monocotyledon rice (Oryza sativa). Some of them (OsPIL11, OsPIL12, and OsPIL13) showed the ability to interact with the putative OsPRR1 (PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 1) clock component, as far as the results of yeast two-hybrid assays were concerned. It was found that the expression of OsPIL13 is under the control of circadian rhythms (clock), while the expression of OsPIL15 is negatively regulated by light upon the onset to light exposure of etiolated seedlings. When the rice genes (OsPIL11 to OsPIL15) were over-expressed in A. thaliana, the resulting transgenic seedlings displayed anomalous morphologies with very long hypocotyls during early photomorphogenesis. These results suggest the view that the identified OsPILs are functional counterparts (or orthologs) of AtPILs, which are known to play important roles in red light-mediated (phyA and/or phyB-dependent) signal transduction pathways at immediate positions downstream of the photoreceptor in A. thaliana.

Phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs) regulate an array of developmental responses ranging from seed germination to vegetational architecture in Arabidopsis. However, information regarding the functions of the PIF family in monocots has not been widely reported. Here, we investigate the roles of OsPIL15, a member of the rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) PIF family, in regulating seedling growth. OsPIL15 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix factor localized in the nucleus. OsPIL15-OX seedlings exhibit an exaggerated shorter aboveground part and undeveloped root system relative to wild-type seedlings, suggesting that OsPIL15 represses seedling growth in the dark. Microarray analysis combined with gene ontology analysis revealed that OsPIL15 represses a set of genes involved in auxin pathways and cell wall organization or biogenesis. Given the important roles of the auxin pathway and cell wall properties in controlling plant growth, we speculate that OsPIL15 represses seedling growth likely by regulating the auxin pathway and suppressing cell wall organization in etiolated rice seedlings. Additionally, exposure to red light or far-red light relieved growth retardation and promoted seedling elongation in the OsPIL15-OX lines, despite higher levels of OsPIL15 transcripts under red light and far-red light than in the dark. These results suggest that light regulation of OsPIL15 expression is probably involved in photomorphogenesis in rice.
NA	The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, OsPIL15 regulates grain size via directly targeting a purine permease gene OsPUP7 in rice.	2019	Plant Biotechnol J	Henan Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Henan Grain Crops, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 450002, China.	As members of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor families, phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs) regulate an array of developmental responses ranging from seed germination to plant growth. However, little is known about their roles in modulating grain development. Here we firstly analyzed the expression pattern of rice OsPIL genes in grains and found that OsPIL15 may play an important role in grain development. We then generated knock-out (KO) OsPIL15 lines in rice using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, the silencing expression of OsPIL15 led to increased numbers of cells, which thus enhanced grain size and weight. Moreover, overexpression and suppression of OsPIL15 in the rice endosperm resulted in brown rice showing grain sizes and weights that were decreased and increased, respectively. Further<U+00A0>studies<U+00A0>indicated that OsPIL15 binds to N1-box (CACGCG) motifs of the purine permease gene OsPUP7 promoter. Measurement of isopentenyl adenosine, a bioactive form of cytokinin (CTK), revealed increased contents in the OsPIL15-KO spikelets compared with the wild-type. Overall, our results demonstrate a possible pathway whereby OsPIL15 directly targets OsPUP7, affecting CTK transport and thereby influencing cell division and subsequent grain size. These findings provide a valuable insight into the molecular functions of OsPIL15 in rice grains, highlighting a useful genetic improvement leading to increased rice yield.

NA	Phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein OsPIL15 integrates light and gravitropism to regulate tiller angle in rice.	2019	Planta	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Rice phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein OsPIL15 regulates tiller angle through light and gravity signals in rice. Tiller angle of cereal crops is a key agronomic trait that contributes to grain production. An understanding of how tiller angle is controlled is helpful for achieving ideal plant architecture to improve grain yield. Phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs) are known to regulate seed germination, seedling skotomorphogenesis, shade avoidance, and flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we report that OsPIL15 is, indeed, a rice PIF that negatively regulates tiller angle. Dominant-negative OsPIL15 plants displayed a larger tiller angle, which was associated with reduced shoot gravitropism. Phytochrome B (phyB) is the main photoreceptor perceiving the low red:far-red ratio of shade light. Compared with wild-type rice plants, loss-of-function phyB plants and OsPIL15-overexpressing plants showed smaller tiller angles and enhanced shoot gravitropism. In addition, more OsPIL15 protein accumulated in phyB plants than in wild-type plants. Light regulates the level of the OsPIL15 protein negatively, depending on phyB partially. We propose that OsPIL15 integrates light and gravity signals to regulate tiller angle in rice.
NA	Red-light receptor phytochrome B inhibits BZR1-NAC028-CAD8B signaling to negatively regulate rice resistance to sheath blight.	2022	Plant Cell Environ	Department of Plant Pathology, College of Plant Protection, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China.	Phytochrome (Phy)-regulated light signalling plays important roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses. However, its function in rice defence against sheath blight disease (ShB) remains unclear. Here, we found that PhyB mutation or shade treatment promoted rice resistance to ShB, while resistance was reduced by PhyB overexpression. Further analysis showed that PhyB interacts with phytochrome-interacting factor-like 15 (PIL15), brassinazole resistant 1 (BZR1), and vascular plant one-zinc-finger 2 (VOZ2). Plants overexpressing PIL15 were more susceptible to ShB in contrast to bzr1-D-overexpressing plants compared with the wild-type, suggesting that PhyB may inhibit BZR1 to negatively regulate rice resistance to ShB. Although BZR1 is known to regulate brassinosteroid (BR) signalling, the observation that BR signalling negatively regulated resistance to ShB indicated an independent role for BZR1 in controlling rice resistance. It was also found that the BZR1 ligand NAC028 positively regulated resistance to ShB. RNA sequencing showed that cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 8B (CAD8B), involved in and NAC028-overexpressing plants compared with the wild-type. Yeast-one hybrid, ChIP, and transactivation assays demonstrated that BZR1 and NAC028 activate CAD8B directly. Taken together, the analyses demonstrated that PhyB-mediated light signalling inhibits the BZR1-NAC028-CAD8B pathway to regulate rice resistance to ShB.
NA	Regulation of OsPIL15 on rice quality.	2022	Mol Breed	Zhengzhou, China Henan Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Henan Grain Crops, Henan Agricultural University. GRID: grid.108266.b. ISNI: 0000 0004 1803 0494	The phytochrome-interacting factor-like gene OsPIL15 negatively regulates grain size and 1000-grain weight, but its regulatory effect on rice quality traits is unknown. Here, knock-down, knock-out, and over-expression of OsPIL15 transgenic rice lines were used to investigate the effects of OsPIL15 on rice yield and quality traits. The results showed that knock-down or knock-out of OsPIL15 increased grain length and width, chalkiness, amylose content, glutenin and globulin content, and total protein content but reduced amylopectin content, total starch content, prolamin and albumin content, and gel consistency. Over-expression of OsPIL15 showed the opposite results, except for the reduction of prolamin content. Although OsPIL15 changed the grain size and weight, it had no effect on grain length/width ratio, brown rice rate, and milled rice rate. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes between transgenic lines and wild type showed that OsPIL15 mainly regulated genes related to ribosome, metabolic pathways, and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Gene expression analysis showed that RNAi transgenic lines decreased OsCIN2 and OsSUS1 expression and increased OsGBSSI, OsSSI, OsAPGL2, and OsAPGL3 expression level, while over-expression of OsPIL15 increased OsCIN2, OsSUS1, OsSUS6, and OsSSI and decreased OsSSIIa, OsSSIIc, and OsAPGL2 expression level. These results revealed that OsPIL15 plays an important role in rice grain development. In addition to grain shape, OsPIL15 also regulates chalkiness, starch content, protein content, and gel consistency.
