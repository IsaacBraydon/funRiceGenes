OsLF	OsPIL15	An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15	Yeast two hybrid and colocalization assays revealed that OsLF interacts strongly with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 that are potentially involved in light signaling
OsLF	OsPIL15	An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15	Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and Hd1 by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 and thus induce late flowering
