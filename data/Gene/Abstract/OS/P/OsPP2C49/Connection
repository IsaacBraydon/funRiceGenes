OsbZIP23	OsPP2C49	Feedback regulation of ABA signaling and biosynthesis by a bZIP transcription factor targets drought resistance related genes.	SAPK2 also interacted with OsPP2C49, an ABI1 homolog, which deactivated the SAPK2 to inhibit the transcriptional activation activity of OsbZIP23
OsbZIP23	OsPP2C49	Feedback regulation of ABA signaling and biosynthesis by a bZIP transcription factor targets drought resistance related genes.	Among these targets, we found that OsbZIP23 could positively regulate OsPP2C49, and overexpression of OsPP2C49 in rice resulted in significantly decreased sensitivity of the ABA response and rapid dehydration
