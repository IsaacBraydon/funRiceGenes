OsPDK1	root	Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice	 OsPDK1 was expressed in leaf blade and leaf sheath but not in callus and root, while OsPDK2 was expressed constitutively in all tissues examined
OsPDK1	growth	Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice	 These results suggest that gibberellin modulates the activity of mtPDC by regulating OsPDK1 expression and subsequently controlling plant growth and development
OsPDK1	leaf	Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice	 OsPDK1 was expressed in leaf blade and leaf sheath but not in callus and root, while OsPDK2 was expressed constitutively in all tissues examined
OsPDK1	leaf	Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice	 Maximum expression of OsPDK1 in leaf sheath was detected by Northern blot analysis when seedlings were treated with 5 microM GA3 for 24 h
OsPDK1	leaf	Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice	 The beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, driven by a 2,067 bp OsPDK1 promoter region fragment, was mainly expressed in the aleurone layer of germinating seed and leaf sheath
