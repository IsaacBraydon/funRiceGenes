OsPGL1	chloroplast	A Rice Dual-localized Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein is involved in Organellar RNA Editing together with OsMORFs.	 The loss of function of OsPGL1 resulted in defects in both chloroplast RNA editing of ndhD-878 and mitochondrial RNA editing of ccmFc-543, both of which could be restored via complementary validation
OsPGL1	chloroplast	A Rice Dual-localized Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein is involved in Organellar RNA Editing together with OsMORFs.	 Despite synonymous editing of ccmFc-543, the loss of editing of ndhD-878 caused a failed conversion of serine to leucine, leading to chloroplast dysfunction and defects in the photosynthetic complex; the results of additional experiments demonstrated that OsPGL1 directly binds to both transcripts
OsPGL1	R protein	A Rice Dual-localized Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein is involved in Organellar RNA Editing together with OsMORFs.	 Here, we identified a rice dual-localized PPR protein, OsPGL1
OsPGL1	chloroplast	PALE-GREEN LEAF 1, a rice cpSRP54 protein, is essential for the assembly of the PSI-LHCI supercomplex.	 Map-based cloning of this gene revealed that OsPGL1 encodes a chloroplast targeted protein homologous to the 54-kDa subunit of the signal recognition particle (cpSRP54)
