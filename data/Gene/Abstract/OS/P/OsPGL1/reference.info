NA	A Rice Dual-localized Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein is involved in Organellar RNA Editing together with OsMORFs.	2018	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice; Engineering Research Center for Plant Biotechnology and Germplasm Utilization of Ministry of Education; College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.	In flowering plants, various RNA editing events occur in the mitochondria and chloroplasts as part of post-transcriptional processes. Although several PPRs and MORFs have been identified as RNA editing factors, the underlying mechanism of PPRs and the cooperation among these proteins are still obscure. Here, we identified a rice dual-localized PPR protein, OsPGL1. The loss of function of OsPGL1 resulted in defects in both chloroplast RNA editing of ndhD-878 and mitochondrial RNA editing of ccmFc-543, both of which could be restored via complementary validation. Despite synonymous editing of ccmFc-543, the loss of editing of ndhD-878 caused a failed conversion of serine to leucine, leading to chloroplast dysfunction and defects in the photosynthetic complex; the results of additional experiments demonstrated that OsPGL1 directly binds to both transcripts. Interactions between three OsMORFs (OsMORF2/8/9) and OsPGL1 both in vitro and in vivo were confirmed, implying that OsPGL1 functions in RNA editing via an editosome. These findings also suggested that OsMORFs assist with and contribute to a flexible PPR-RNA recognition model during RNA editing. These results indicate that, in cooperation with PPRs, OsPGL1 is required for RNA editing. In addition, these results provide new insight into the relationship between RNA editing and plant development.
NA	PALE-GREEN LEAF 1, a rice cpSRP54 protein, is essential for the assembly of the PSI-LHCI supercomplex.	2022	Plant Direct	Saskatoon Research and Development Centre Agriculture and Agri-food Canada Saskatoon SK Canada.	Although photosynthetic multiprotein complexes have received major attention, our knowledge about the assembly of these proteins into functional complexes in plants is still limited. In the present study, we have identified a chlorophyll-deficient mutant, pale-green leaf 1 (pgl1), in rice that displays abnormally developed chloroplasts. Map-based cloning of this gene revealed that OsPGL1 encodes a chloroplast targeted protein homologous to the 54-kDa subunit of the signal recognition particle (cpSRP54). Immunoblot analysis revealed that the accumulation of the PSI core proteins PsaA and PsaB, subunits from the ATP synthase, cytochrome, and light-harvesting complex (LHC) is dramatically reduced in pgl1. Blue native gel analysis of thylakoid membrane proteins showed the existence of an extra band in the pgl1 mutant, which located between the dimeric PSII/PSI-LHCI and the monomeric PSII. Immunodetection after 2D separation indicated that the extra band consists of the proteins from the PSI core complex. Measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence at 77â€‰K further confirmed that PSI, rather than PSII, was primarily impaired in the pgl1 mutant. These results suggest that OsPGL1 might act as a molecular chaperone that is required for the efficient assembly and specific integration of the peripheral LHCI proteins into the PSI core complex in rice.
