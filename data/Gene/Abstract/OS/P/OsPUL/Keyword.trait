OsPUL	starch	Characterization of expression of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type debranching enzyme during seed development and germination in rice	 The expression of the OsPUL gene was maintained at a significant level during the entire grain filling period and in the late stage of seed germination, which coincided with its involvement in starch anabolism and catabolism
OsPUL	grain filling	Characterization of expression of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type debranching enzyme during seed development and germination in rice	 The expression of the OsPUL gene was maintained at a significant level during the entire grain filling period and in the late stage of seed germination, which coincided with its involvement in starch anabolism and catabolism
OsPUL	seed development	Characterization of expression of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type debranching enzyme during seed development and germination in rice	 The OsPUL gene maintained a relatively high expression level during the entire period of seed development, and peaked in the middle and late stages|Characterization of expression of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type debranching enzyme during seed development and germination in rice
OsPUL	branching	Characterization of expression of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type debranching enzyme during seed development and germination in rice	Characterization of expression of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type debranching enzyme during seed development and germination in rice
OsPUL	endosperm	Characterization of expression of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type debranching enzyme during seed development and germination in rice	 In addition, the 1177-bp OsPUL promoter sequence was cloned, and some endosperm-specific motifs such as the GCN4 and AACA motifs were observed to exist in this region| The data from both histochemical and fluorometric analyses showed that the OsPUL promoter was capable of driving the target gene to have a high level of endosperm-specific expression
OsPUL	seed germination	Characterization of expression of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type debranching enzyme during seed development and germination in rice	 Furthermore, the seed germination experiment showed that the OsPUL promoter actively functions in the late stage of seed germination| The expression of the OsPUL gene was maintained at a significant level during the entire grain filling period and in the late stage of seed germination, which coincided with its involvement in starch anabolism and catabolism
OsPUL	seed	Characterization of expression of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type debranching enzyme during seed development and germination in rice	 In the present study, we performed a quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) analysis of the expression pattern of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type DBE in different tissues as well as in seeds at different developmental stages| The OsPUL gene maintained a relatively high expression level during the entire period of seed development, and peaked in the middle and late stages| Furthermore, the seed germination experiment showed that the OsPUL promoter actively functions in the late stage of seed germination| The expression of the OsPUL gene was maintained at a significant level during the entire grain filling period and in the late stage of seed germination, which coincided with its involvement in starch anabolism and catabolism|Characterization of expression of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type debranching enzyme during seed development and germination in rice
OsPUL	grain	Characterization of expression of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type debranching enzyme during seed development and germination in rice	 The expression of the OsPUL gene was maintained at a significant level during the entire grain filling period and in the late stage of seed germination, which coincided with its involvement in starch anabolism and catabolism
