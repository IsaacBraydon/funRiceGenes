OsPK5	growth	Identification of OsPK5 involved in rice glycolytic metabolism and GA/ABA balance for improving seed germination via genome-wide association study.	 The disruption of OsPK5 function resulted in slow germination and seedling growth during seed germination, blocked glycolytic metabolism, caused glucose accumulation, decreased energy levels, and affected the GA/ABA balance
OsPK5	Kinase	Identification of OsPK5 involved in rice glycolytic metabolism and GA/ABA balance for improving seed germination via genome-wide association study.	 Natural variation in OsPK5 function altered the activity of pyruvate kinase
OsPK5	kinase	Identification of OsPK5 involved in rice glycolytic metabolism and GA/ABA balance for improving seed germination via genome-wide association study.	 Natural variation in OsPK5 function altered the activity of pyruvate kinase
OsPK5	seedling	Identification of OsPK5 involved in rice glycolytic metabolism and GA/ABA balance for improving seed germination via genome-wide association study.	 The disruption of OsPK5 function resulted in slow germination and seedling growth during seed germination, blocked glycolytic metabolism, caused glucose accumulation, decreased energy levels, and affected the GA/ABA balance
