Considering the sequenced rice genome at hand, only the Oryza sativa phosphate transporter (OsPT) gene OsPT11 was specifically induced during the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. This induction was confined to the root system and was tightly correlated with the degree of root colonization by Glomus intraradices. OsPT11 activation was independent of the nutritional status of the plant and phosphate availability in the rhizosphere. Moreover, infection of roots with the fungal pathogens Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium moniliforme did not activate OsPT11, corroborating the high signal specificity for OsPT11 activation in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. OsPT11 expression complemented a defect in phosphate uptake in a yeast strain mutated in its high-affinity P(i) transporter (pho84), thereby confirming its function. Recently, a phosphate transporter gene in potato was shown to be induced during arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Assessment of the phylogenetic relationship of the rice and potato protein revealed that the rice is nonorthologous to the potato protein. Further, there are no structural commonalities in the promoter regions. Thus, although cytological and physiological features of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis seem to be conserved, the molecular components may differ significantly between distantly related plant species.
NA	The Rice Phosphate Transporter OsPHT1;7 Plays a Dual Role in Phosphorus Redistribution and Anther Development.	2022	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is the predominant form of phosphorus (P) readily accessible to plants, and Phosphate Transporter 1 (PHT1) genes are the major contributors to root Pi uptake. However, the mechanisms underlying the transport and recycling of Pi within plants, which are vital for optimizing P use efficiency, remain elusive. Here, we characterized a functionally unknown rice (Oryza sativa) PHT1 member barely expressed in roots, OsPHT1;7. Yeast complementation and Xenopus laevis oocyte assay demonstrated that OsPHT1;7 could mediate Pi transport. Reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and histochemical analyses showed that OsPHT1;7 was preferentially expressed in source leaves and nodes. A further fine-localization analysis by immunostaining showed that OsPHT1;7 expression was restricted in the vascular bundle sheath and phloem of source leaves and enlarged-vascular bundles of nodes. In accordance with this expression pattern, mutation of OsPHT1;7 led to increased and decreased P distribution in source (old leaves) and sink organs (new leaves/panicles), respectively, indicating that OsPHT1;7 is involved in P redistribution. Furthermore, OsPHT1;7 showed an overwhelmingly higher transcript abundance in anthers than other PHT1 members, and ospht1;7 mutants were impaired in P accumulation in anthers but not in pistils or husks. Moreover, the germination of pollen grains was significantly inhibited upon OsPHT1;7 mutation, leading to aâ€<U+383C><U+3E39>&gt;â€<U+383C><U+3E39>80% decrease in seed-setting rate and grain yield. Taken together, our results provide evidence that OsPHT1;7 is a crucial Pi transporter for Pi transport and recycling within rice plants, stimulating both the vegetative and reproductive growth.
