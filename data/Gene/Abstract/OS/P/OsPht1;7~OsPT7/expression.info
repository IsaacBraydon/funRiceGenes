OsPht1;7|OsPT7	 A further fine-localization analysis by immunostaining showed that OsPHT1;7 expression was restricted in the vascular bundle sheath and phloem of source leaves and enlarged-vascular bundles of nodes |  In accordance with this expression pattern, mutation of OsPHT1;7 led to increased and decreased P distribution in source (old leaves) and sink organs (new leaves/panicles), respectively, indicating that OsPHT1;7 is involved in P redistribution
