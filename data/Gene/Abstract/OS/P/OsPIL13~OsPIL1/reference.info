In plants, flowering as a crucial developmental event is highly regulated by both genetic programs and environmental signals. Genetic analysis of flowering time mutants is instrumental in dissecting the regulatory pathways of flowering induction. In this study, we isolated the OsLF gene by its association with the T-DNA insertion in the rice late flowering mutant named A654. The OsLF gene encodes an atypical HLH protein composed of 419 amino acids (aa). Overexpression of the OsLF gene in wild type rice recapitulated the late flowering phenotype of A654, indicating that the OsLF gene negatively regulates flowering. Flowering genes downstream of OsPRR1 such as OsGI and Hd1 were down regulated in the A654 mutant. Yeast two hybrid and colocalization assays revealed that OsLF interacts strongly with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 that are potentially involved in light signaling. In addition, OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 colocalize with OsPRR1, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis APRR1 gene that controls photoperiodic flowering response through clock function. Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and Hd1 by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 and thus induce late flowering.
71_1183.pdf	Characterization of a Set of Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like bHLH Proteins inOryza sativa	2014	Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry	Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, School of Agriculture, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan.	The model dicotyledon Arabidopsis thaliana has a characteristic small sub-family of phytochrome-interacting bHLH (basic Helix-Loop-Helix) factors, which are collectively designated the PIL (or PIF) (PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR-LIKE) family proteins. In this study, we identified and characterized a set of highly homologous members (designated OsPIL11 to OsPIL16) in the model monocotyledon rice (Oryza sativa). Some of them (OsPIL11, OsPIL12, and OsPIL13) showed the ability to interact with the putative OsPRR1 (PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 1) clock component, as far as the results of yeast two-hybrid assays were concerned. It was found that the expression of OsPIL13 is under the control of circadian rhythms (clock), while the expression of OsPIL15 is negatively regulated by light upon the onset to light exposure of etiolated seedlings. When the rice genes (OsPIL11 to OsPIL15) were over-expressed in A. thaliana, the resulting transgenic seedlings displayed anomalous morphologies with very long hypocotyls during early photomorphogenesis. These results suggest the view that the identified OsPILs are functional counterparts (or orthologs) of AtPILs, which are known to play important roles in red light-mediated (phyA and/or phyB-dependent) signal transduction pathways at immediate positions downstream of the photoreceptor in A. thaliana.

The mechanisms for plant growth restriction during stress conditions remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein, OsPIL1/OsPIL13, acts as a key regulator of reduced internode elongation in rice under drought conditions. The level of OsPIL1 mRNA in rice seedlings grown under nonstressed conditions with light/dark cycles oscillated in a circadian manner with peaks in the middle of the light period. Under drought stress conditions, OsPIL1 expression was inhibited during the light period. We found that OsPIL1 was highly expressed in the node portions of the stem using promoter-glucuronidase analysis. Overexpression of OsPIL1 in transgenic rice plants promoted internode elongation. In contrast, transgenic rice plants with a chimeric repressor resulted in short internode sections. Alteration of internode cell size was observed in OsPIL1 transgenic plants, indicating that differences in cell size cause the change in internode length. Oligoarray analysis revealed OsPIL1 downstream genes, which were enriched for cell wall-related genes responsible for cell elongation. These data suggest that OsPIL1 functions as a key regulatory factor of reduced plant height via cell wall-related genes in response to drought stress. This regulatory system may be important for morphological stress adaptation in rice under drought conditions.
NA	Double overexpression of DREB and PIF transcription factors improves drought stress tolerance and cell elongation in transgenic plants.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan.	Although a variety of transgenic plants that are tolerant to drought stress have been generated, many of these plants show growth retardation. To improve drought tolerance and plant growth, we applied a gene-stacking approach using two transcription factor genes: DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING 1A (DREB1A) and rice PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR-LIKE 1 (OsPIL1). The overexpression of DREB1A has been reported to improve drought stress tolerance in various crops, although it also causes a severe dwarf phenotype. OsPIL1 is a rice homologue of Arabidopsis PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4), and it enhances cell elongation by activating cell wall-related gene expression. We found that the OsPIL1 protein was more stable than PIF4 under light conditions in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Transactivation analyses revealed that DREB1A and OsPIL1 did not negatively affect each other's transcriptional activities. The transgenic plants overexpressing both OsPIL1 and DREB1A showed improved drought stress tolerance similar to that of DREB1A overexpressors. Furthermore, double overexpressors showed enhanced hypocotyl elongation and floral induction compared with the DREB1A overexpressors. Metabolome analyses indicated that compatible solutes, such as sugars and amino acids, accumulated in the double overexpressors, which was similar to the observations of the DREB1A overexpressors. Transcriptome analyses showed increased expression of abiotic stress-inducible DREB1A downstream genes and cell elongation-related OsPIL1 downstream genes in the double overexpressors, which suggests that these two transcription factors function independently in the transgenic plants despite the trade-offs required to balance plant growth and stress tolerance. Our study provides a basis for plant genetic engineering designed to overcome growth retardation in drought-tolerant transgenic plants. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
NA	Roles of rice PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR-LIKE1 (OsPIL1) in leaf senescence.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	a Department of Plant Science, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University , Seoul 08826 , Republic of Korea.	Rice (Oryza sativa) Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like1 (OsPIL1), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, plays an important role in the elongation of internode cells. Recently, we found that OsPIL1 participates in chlorophyll biosynthesis by directly upregulating several genes encoding components of the photosystem apparatus. Here, we show that OsPIL1 negatively regulates leaf senescence in rice. During dark-induced senescence (DIS), ospil1 mutants senesced earlier than wild type; this is opposite to mutants of Arabidopsis PIF4 and PIF5, the closest homologs of OsPIL1. Microarray analysis revealed that during DIS, a number of senescence-associated genes were upregulated and OsGLKs, negative regulators of leaf senescence, were strongly repressed in ospil1 mutants. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsPIL1 showed an early senescing phenotype during DIS. In addition, OsPIL1 expressed in Arabidopsis upregulates the transcription of ORESARA1, a major senescence-inducing NAC transcription factor and one of the downstream genes of Arabidopsis PIF4, by directly binding the promoter region. These results indicate that OsPIL1 and Arabidopsis PIF4 have similar functions, but their downstream regulatory cascades have opposite effects.
NA	Rice Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like1 (OsPIL1) is involved in the promotion of chlorophyll biosynthesis through feed-forward regulatory loops.	2017	J Exp Bot	Department of Plant Science, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, and Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea.	In phototrophic plants, the highly conserved and tightly regulated process of chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis comprises multi-step reactions involving more than 15 enzymes. Since the efficiency of Chl biosynthesis strongly affects plant productivity, understanding the underlying regulatory mechanisms in crop plants can be useful for strategies to increase grain and biomass yields. Here, we show that rice (Oryza sativa) Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like1 (OsPIL1), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, promotes Chl biosynthesis. The T-DNA insertion knockdown ospil1 mutant showed a pale-green phenotype when grown in a natural paddy field. Transcriptome analysis revealed that several genes responsible for Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis were significantly down-regulated in ospil1 leaves. Using promoter binding and transactivation assays, we found that OsPIL1 binds to the promoters of two Chl biosynthetic genes, OsPORB and OsCAO1, and promotes their transcription. In addition, OsPIL1 directly up-regulates the expression of two transcription factor genes, GOLDEN2-LIKE1 (OsGLK1) and OsGLK2. OsGLK1 and OsGLK2 both bind to the promoters of OsPORB and OsCAO1, as well as some of genes encoding the light-harvesting complex of photosystems, probably promoting their transcription. Thus, OsPIL1 is involved in the promotion of Chl biosynthesis by up-regulating the transcription of OsPORB and OsCAO1 via trifurcate feed-forward regulatory loops involving two OsGLKs.
