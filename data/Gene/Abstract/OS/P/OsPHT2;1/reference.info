Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient required for plant development and production. The mechanisms regulating phosphate (Pi) uptake are well established, but the function of chloroplast Pi homeostasis are poorly understood in rice. PHT2;1 is one of the transporters/translocators mediating Pi import into chloroplasts. In this study, to gain insight into the role of OsPHT2;1-mediated stroma Pi, we analyzed OsPHT2;1 function in Pi utilization and photoprotection. Our results showed that OsPHT2;1 was induced by Pi starvation and light exposure. Cell-based assays showed that OsPHT2;1 localized to the chloroplast envelope and functioned as a low-affinity Pi transporter. The ospht2;1 had reduced Pi accumulation, plant growth and photosynthetic rates. Metabolite profiling revealed that 52.6% of the decreased metabolites in ospht2;1 plants were flavonoids, which was further confirmed by 40% lower content of total flavonoids compared to wild type. As a consequence, ospht2;1 plants were more sensitive to UV-B irradiation. Moreover, the content of phenylalanine, the precursor of flavonoids, was also reduced, and largely associated with the repressed expression of ADT1/MTR1. Furthermore, the ospht2;1 showed decreased grain yields at relatively high levels of UV-B irradiance. In summary, OsPHT2;1 functions as a chloroplast-localized low-affinity Pi transporter that mediates UV tolerance and rice yields in different latitudes.
