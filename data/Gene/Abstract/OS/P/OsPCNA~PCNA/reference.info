Kimura-2001-Characterization of.pdf	Characterization of plant proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1), and their distribution in mitotic and meiotic cell cycles	2002	The Plant Journal	Department of Applied Biological Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Tokyo 	The biochemical and cell cycle-dependent properties of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (OsPCNA) and flap endonuclease-1 (OsFEN-1) were characterized from rice (Oryza sativa). OsPCNA was physically associated with OsFEN-1 and increased the flap-endonuclease activity of OsFEN-1 by 2.5-fold. Northern and Western blotting analysis revealed that OsPCNA and OsFEN-1 were present in meristematic tissues such as cultured cells, shoot apical meristem and root apical meristem. No expression was detected in the mature leaves, although they were exposed to UV. Both of these proteins were localized in the nuclei of the interphase cells including G1, S and G2, and in the nuclear region at telophase. The distribution patterns of plant PCNA and FEN-1 in meiotic cell progression were investigated using microsporocytes of lily (Lilium longiflorum cv. Hinomoto). During the leptotene to pachytene stages, PCNA and FEN-1 were localized in the nuclear region. The florescence gradually disappeared from diplotene to metaphase I. Interestingly, signals for PCNA formed 10â€<U+393C><U+3E33>20 intense spots at leptotene. The number of spots decreased to 1â€<U+393C><U+3E33>5 at zygotene and finally to 1 at pachytene. The roles of OsPCNA and OsFEN-1 in mitotic and meiotic cell cycles are discussed.
Suzuka-1989-Gene for proliferati.pdf	Gene for proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (DNA polymerase 6 auxiliary protein) is present in both mammalian and higher plant genomes	1989	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Molecular Biology, National Institute of Agrobiological Resources, Tsukuba Science City, Japan.	Proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; also called cyclin) was originally described in proliferating mammalian cells as a nuclear protein with an apparent Mr of 33,000-36,000 and recently was found to be a DNA polymerase delta auxiliary protein. To elucidate whether PCNA/cyclin is a universal protein necessary for proliferation of eukaryotes, a search was conducted for PCNA/cyclin homologues in higher plants. In Southern blot-hybridization analysis, a rat PCNA/cyclin cDNA probe hybridized with homologous sequences in genomic DNAs from rice, soybean, and tobacco. A PCNA/cyclin-related molecular clone (pCJ-1) was isolated from rice DNA and was partially sequenced. The pCJ-1 probe hybridized with a 1.2-kilobase transcript in RNA from rice root tips and shoots. Immunoblot analysis of the soluble extract of soybean root tips with monospecific anti-PCNA/cyclin identified an immunoreactive protein with an apparent Mr of 34,000. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of an immunoreactive PCNA/cyclin protein in the nuclei of cells in the meristem of soybean root tips. The highly homologous nature of the gene for PCNA/cyclin throughout the animal and plant kingdoms suggests that the product of the gene plays an essential role in DNA replication in eukaryotes.
Yang-2012-The OsGEN-L protein.pdf	The OsGEN-L protein from Oryza sativa possesses Holliday junction resolvase activity as well as 5'-flap endonuclease activity	2012	J Biochem	Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Bioresource and Bioenvironmental Sciences, Kyushu University, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan.	OsGEN-L has a 5'-flap endonuclease activity and plays an essential role in rice microspore development. The Class 4 RAD2/XPG family nucleases, including OsGEN-L, were recently found to have resolving activity for the Holliday junction (HJ), the intermediate of DNA strand recombination. In this study, we performed a detailed characterization of OsGEN-L, as a structure-specific endonuclease. Highly purified OsGEN-L was prepared as the full-length protein for in vitro endonuclease assays using various structured DNAs, and the 5'-flap endonuclease activity, which is stimulated in a PCNA-dependent manner, was demonstrated. In addition, the in vitro HJ resolving activity of OsGEN-L represents the first such activity originating from plant cells. OsGEN-L cleaved HJ at symmetrically related sites of the branch point. However, the two branched strands seemed to be cleaved individually, and not cooperatively, by each OsGEN-L monomer protein. The substrate specificity suggests that OsGEN-L functions in multiple processes of DNA metabolism in rice cells.
NA	Interactional similarities and differences in the protein complex of PCNA and DNA replication factor C between rice and Arabidopsis.	2019	BMC Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.	BACKGROUND: Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a conserved trimeric ring complex, is loaded onto replication fork through a hetero-pentameric AAA+ ATPase complex termed replication factor C (RFC) to maintain genome stability. Although architectures of PCNA-RFC complex in yeast have been revealed, the functions of PCNA and protein-protein interactions of PCNA-RFC complex in higher plants are not very clear. Here, essential regions mediating interactions between PCNA and RFC subunits in Arabidopsis and rice were investigated via yeast-two-hybrid method and bimolecular fluorescence complementation techniques. RESULTS: We observed that OsPCNA could interact with all OsRFC subunits, while protein-protein interactions only exist between Arabidopsis RFC2/3/4/5 and AtPCNA1/2. The truncated analyses indicated that the C-terminal of Arabidopsis RFC2/3/4/5 and rice RFC1/2 is essential for binding PCNA while the region of rice RFC3/4/5 mediating interaction with PCNA and N-terminal of Arabidopsis and rice PCNA contribute equally to PCNA-PCNA interaction, and the interdomain connecting loop (IDCL) domain and C-terminal of PCNAs are indispensable for interacting RFC subunits. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that Arabidopsis and rice PCNAs are highly conserved in sequence, structure and pattern of interacting with other PCNA monomer. Nevertheless, there are also significant differences between the Arabidopsis and rice RFC subunits in binding PCNA. Taken together, our results could be helpful for revealing the biological functions of plant RFC-PCNA complex.
NA	Chromatin-remodeling factor CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box interacts with OsPCNA in Rice.	2022	BMC Plant Biol	College of Life Sciences, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang, China. zhangyushun@htu.edu.cn.	BACKGROUND: Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is one of the key factors for the DNA replication process and DNA damage repair. Most proteins interacting with PCNA have a common binding motif: PCNA interacting protein box (PIP box). However, some proteins with non-canonical PIP-box have also been reported to be the key factors that interacted with PCNA. RESULTS: Here we discovered the C terminal of a chromatin-remodeling factor CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box was essential for interacting with OsPCNA in rice. Both OsPCNA and CHR721 were localized in the nuclei and function in response to DNA damages. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results and previous work, we proposed a working model that CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box interacted with OsPCNA and both of them probably participate in the DNA damage repair process.
