OsPARP3	OsPCNA|PCNA	Linear Energy Transfer-Dependent Change in Rice Gene Expression Profile after Heavy-Ion Beam Irradiation.	 Of the LET-dependent up-regulated genes, OsPARP3 and OsPCNA were identified, which are involved in DNA repair pathways
CHR721	OsPCNA|PCNA	Chromatin-remodeling factor CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box interacts with OsPCNA in Rice.	Chromatin-remodeling factor CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box interacts with OsPCNA in Rice.
CHR721	OsPCNA|PCNA	Chromatin-remodeling factor CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box interacts with OsPCNA in Rice.	 RESULTS: Here we discovered the C terminal of a chromatin-remodeling factor CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box was essential for interacting with OsPCNA in rice
CHR721	OsPCNA|PCNA	Chromatin-remodeling factor CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box interacts with OsPCNA in Rice.	 Both OsPCNA and CHR721 were localized in the nuclei and function in response to DNA damages
CHR721	OsPCNA|PCNA	Chromatin-remodeling factor CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box interacts with OsPCNA in Rice.	 CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results and previous work, we proposed a working model that CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box interacted with OsPCNA and both of them probably participate in the DNA damage repair process
