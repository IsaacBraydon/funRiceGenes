OsPEX11	seedlings	OsPEX11, a Peroxisomal Biogenesis Factor 11, Contributes to Salt Stress Tolerance in Oryza sativa.	 Phenotypic analysis of OsPEX11 overexpression seedlings demonstrated that they had better tolerance to salt stress than wild type (WT) and OsPEX11-RNAi seedlings
OsPEX11	defense	OsPEX11, a Peroxisomal Biogenesis Factor 11, Contributes to Salt Stress Tolerance in Oryza sativa.	 These results provide experimental evidence that OsPEX11 is an important gene implicated in Na(+) and K(+) regulation, and plays a critical role in salt stress tolerance by modulating the expression of cation transporters and antioxidant defense
OsPEX11	salinity	OsPEX11, a Peroxisomal Biogenesis Factor 11, Contributes to Salt Stress Tolerance in Oryza sativa.
