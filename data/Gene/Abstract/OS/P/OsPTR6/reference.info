NA	Over-expression of OsPTR6 in rice increased plant growth at different nitrogen supplies but decreased nitrogen use efficiency at high ammonium supply.	2014	Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, PR China.

In this study, OsPTR6, a PTR/NRT1 transporter, was over-expressed in the Nipponbare rice cultivar by Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation using the ubiquitin (Ubi) promoter. Three single-copy T2 generation transgenic lines, named OE1, OE5 and OE6, were produced and subjected to hydroponic growth experiments in different nitrogen treatments. The results showed the plant height and biomass of the over-expression lines were increased, and plant N accumulation and glutamine synthetase (GS) activities were enhanced at 5.0mmol/L NH4(+) and 2.5mmol/L NH4NO3. The expression of OsATM1 genes in over-expression lines showed that the OsPTR6 over expression increased OsAMT1.1, OsATM1.2 and OsAMT1.3 expression at 0.2 and 5.0mmol/L NH4(+) and 2.5mmol/L NH4NO3. However, nitrogen utilisation efficiency (NUE) was decreased at 5.0mmol/LNH4(+). These data suggest that over-expression of the OsPTR6 gene could increase rice growth through increasing ammonium transporter expression and glutamine synthetase activity (GSA), but decreases nitrogen use efficiency under conditions of high ammonium supply.
NA	The Rice Peptide Transporter OsNPF7.3 Is Induced by Organic Nitrogen, and Contributes to Nitrogen Allocation and Grain Yield.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Center of Applied Biotechnology, Wuhan Institute of BioengineeringWuhan, China.	Nitrogen use efficiency is important for the development of sustainable agriculture. Plants have different transporters to facilitate nitrogen uptake and internal distribution. This study demonstrates that the peptide transporter OsNPF7.3 enhances nitrogen allocation and increases grain yield in rice. OsNPF7.3 is a member of the nitrate transporter 1/peptide transporter family (NPF) and is localized in the vacuolar membrane. Its expression is higher in the lateral roots and stems. Its transcripts concentrate in the vascular bundle and significantly regulated by organic nitrogen sources. The RNAi lines of OsNPF7.3 affect plant growth and cause amino acids to accumulate in leaf sheaths and decrease in the leaf blades. At later stages of reproductive growth, nitrogen degradation accelerates in the leaves of plants over-expressing OsNPF7.3 and the nitrogen is translocated to grains. The tiller numbers, panicles per plant, filled grain numbers per panicle, and grain nitrogen content of the OsNPF7.3 over-expressing plant were more than that of wide type. The elevated gene expression in OsNPF7.3 could enhance nitrogen utilization efficiency in rice paddy.
