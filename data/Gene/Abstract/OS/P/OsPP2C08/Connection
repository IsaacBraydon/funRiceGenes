OsPP2C08	SAPK2|OsSAPK2	Stress-induced F-Box protein-coding gene OsFBX257 modulates drought stress adaptations and ABA responses in rice.	 We show that OsFBX257 can bind the kinases OsCDPK1 and OsSAPK2, and that its phosphorylation can be reversed by phosphatase OsPP2C08
OsPP2C08	OsPP2C51	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C08, a Negative Regulator of Abscisic Acid Signaling, Promotes Internode Elongation in Rice.	 Among the nine OsPP2CAs, OsPP2C08 had the highest amino acid sequence similarity with OsPP2C51, which positively regulates GA signaling in rice seed germination
OsPP2C08	OsPP2C51	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C08, a Negative Regulator of Abscisic Acid Signaling, Promotes Internode Elongation in Rice.	 However, OsPP2C08 was expressed in different tissues (internodes, sheaths, and flowers) compared to OsPP2C51, which was specifically expressed in seeds, and showed much stronger induction under abiotic stress than OsPP2C51
