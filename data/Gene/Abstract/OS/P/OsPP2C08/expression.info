OsPP2C08	 Indeed, the expression levels of GA biosynthetic genes including gibberellin 20-oxidase (OsGA20ox4) and Ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (OsKAO) were increased in OsPP2C08-OX lines, and we observed that GIBBERELLIN 2-OXIDASE 4 (OsGA2ox4), encoding an oxidase that catalyzes the 2-beta-hydroxylation of several biologically active GAs, was repressed in the OsPP2C08-OX lines based on a transcriptome deep sequencing and RT-qPCR analysis
