OsPP2C08	phosphatase	Stress-induced F-Box protein-coding gene OsFBX257 modulates drought stress adaptations and ABA responses in rice.	 We show that OsFBX257 can bind the kinases OsCDPK1 and OsSAPK2, and that its phosphorylation can be reversed by phosphatase OsPP2C08
OsPP2C08	stress	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C08, a Negative Regulator of Abscisic Acid Signaling, Promotes Internode Elongation in Rice.	 However, OsPP2C08 was expressed in different tissues (internodes, sheaths, and flowers) compared to OsPP2C51, which was specifically expressed in seeds, and showed much stronger induction under abiotic stress than OsPP2C51
OsPP2C08	seed	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C08, a Negative Regulator of Abscisic Acid Signaling, Promotes Internode Elongation in Rice.	 Among the nine OsPP2CAs, OsPP2C08 had the highest amino acid sequence similarity with OsPP2C51, which positively regulates GA signaling in rice seed germination
OsPP2C08	seed germination	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C08, a Negative Regulator of Abscisic Acid Signaling, Promotes Internode Elongation in Rice.	 Among the nine OsPP2CAs, OsPP2C08 had the highest amino acid sequence similarity with OsPP2C51, which positively regulates GA signaling in rice seed germination

OsPP2C08	ABA	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C08, a Negative Regulator of Abscisic Acid Signaling, Promotes Internode Elongation in Rice.	 Transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsPP2C08 (OsPP2C08-OX) had a typical ABA-insensitive phenotype in a post-germination assay, indicating that OsPP2C08, as with other OsPP2CAs, negatively regulates ABA signaling
OsPP2C08	ABA	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C08, a Negative Regulator of Abscisic Acid Signaling, Promotes Internode Elongation in Rice.	 Taken together, our results reveal that OsPP2C08 negatively regulates ABA signaling and positively regulates GA signaling in rice
