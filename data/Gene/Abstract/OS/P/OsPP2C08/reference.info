NA	Stress-induced F-Box protein-coding gene OsFBX257 modulates drought stress adaptations and ABA responses in rice.	2022	Plant Cell Environ	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics &amp; Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, India.	F-box (FB) proteins that form part of SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF) type of E3 ubiquitin ligases are important components of plant growth and development. Here we characterized OsFBX257, a rice FB protein-coding gene that is differentially expressed under drought conditions and other abiotic stresses. Population genomics analysis suggest that OsFBX257 shows high allelic diversity in aus accessions and has been under positive selection in some japonica, aromatic and indica cultivars. Interestingly, allelic variation at OsFBX257 in aus cultivar Nagina22 is associated with an alternatively spliced transcript. Conserved among land plants, OsFBX257 is a component of the SCF complex, can form homomers and interact molecularly with the 14-3-3 rice proteins GF14b and GF14c. OsFBX257 is co-expressed in a network involving protein kinases and phosphatases. We show that OsFBX257 can bind the kinases OsCDPK1 and OsSAPK2, and that its phosphorylation can be reversed by phosphatase OsPP2C08. OsFBX257 expression level modulates root architecture and drought stress tolerance in rice. OsFBX257 knockdown (OsFBX257(KD) ) lines show reduced total root length and depth, crown root number, panicle size and survival under stress. In contrast, its overexpression (OsFBX257(OE) ) increases root depth, leaf and grain length, number of panicles, and grain yield in rice. OsFBX257 is a promising breeding target for alleviating drought stress-induced damage in rice.
NA	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C08, a Negative Regulator of Abscisic Acid Signaling, Promotes Internode Elongation in Rice.	2023	Int J Mol Sci	Metabolic Engineering Division, National Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Rural Development Administration, Jeonju 54874, Republic of Korea.	Clade A protein phosphatase 2Cs (PP2CAs) negatively regulate abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. Here, we investigated the functions of OsPP2CAs and their crosstalk with ABA and gibberellic acid (GA) signaling pathways in rice (Oryza sativa). Among the nine OsPP2CAs, OsPP2C08 had the highest amino acid sequence similarity with OsPP2C51, which positively regulates GA signaling in rice seed germination. However, OsPP2C08 was expressed in different tissues (internodes, sheaths, and flowers) compared to OsPP2C51, which was specifically expressed in seeds, and showed much stronger induction under abiotic stress than OsPP2C51. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsPP2C08 (OsPP2C08-OX) had a typical ABA-insensitive phenotype in a post-germination assay, indicating that OsPP2C08, as with other OsPP2CAs, negatively regulates ABA signaling. Furthermore, OsPP2C08-OX lines had longer stems than wild-type (WT) plants due to longer internodes, especially between the second and third nodes. Internode cells were also longer in OsPP2C08-OX lines than in the WT. As GA positively regulates plant growth, these results suggest that OsPP2C08 might positively regulate GA biosynthesis. Indeed, the expression levels of GA biosynthetic genes including gibberellin 20-oxidase (OsGA20ox4) and Ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (OsKAO) were increased in OsPP2C08-OX lines, and we observed that GIBBERELLIN 2-OXIDASE 4 (OsGA2ox4), encoding an oxidase that catalyzes the 2-beta-hydroxylation of several biologically active GAs, was repressed in the OsPP2C08-OX lines based on a transcriptome deep sequencing and RT-qPCR analysis. Furthermore, we compared the accumulation of SLENDER RICE 1 (SLR1), a DELLA protein involved in GA signaling, in OsPP2C08-OX and WT plants, and observed lower levels of SLR1 in the OsPP2C08-OX lines than in the WT. Taken together, our results reveal that OsPP2C08 negatively regulates ABA signaling and positively regulates GA signaling in rice. Our study provides valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between GA and ABA signaling in rice.
