OsDIS1	OsPUB67	A U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase OsPUB67 is positively involved in drought tolerance in rice.	OsPUB67, a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase, may interact with two drought tolerance negative regulators (OsRZFP34 and OsDIS1) and improve drought tolerance by enhancing the reactive oxygen scavenging ability and stomatal closure
OsDIS1	OsPUB67	A U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase OsPUB67 is positively involved in drought tolerance in rice.	 Further evidence showed that several E3 ubiquitin ligases interacted with OsPUB67, especially OsRZFP34 and OsDIS1, which are negative regulators of drought tolerance
