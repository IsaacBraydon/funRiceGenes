OsDIS1	OsPUB67	A U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase OsPUB67 is positively involved in drought tolerance in rice.	OsPUB67, a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase, may interact with two drought tolerance negative regulators (OsRZFP34 and OsDIS1) and improve drought tolerance by enhancing the reactive oxygen scavenging ability and stomatal closure
OsDIS1	OsPUB67	A U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase OsPUB67 is positively involved in drought tolerance in rice.	 Further evidence showed that several E3 ubiquitin ligases interacted with OsPUB67, especially OsRZFP34 and OsDIS1, which are negative regulators of drought tolerance

OsPUB67	OsPUB7	Knockout Mutants of OsPUB7 Generated Using CRISPR/Cas9 Revealed Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Rice.	 Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that the expression of the genes (OsPUB23, OsPUB24, OsPUB66, and OsPUB67) known to be involved in stress increased in PUB7-GE and this, by forming a 1-node network with OsPUB66 and OsPUB7, acted as a negative regulator of drought and salinity stress
