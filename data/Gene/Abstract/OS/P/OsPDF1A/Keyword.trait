OsPDF1A	chloroplast	Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts	Transient expression of PDF-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in the protoplasts demonstrates that, unlike OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B is localized in both the chloroplasts and the mitochondria
OsPDF1A	mitochondria	Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts	Transient expression of PDF-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in the protoplasts demonstrates that, unlike OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B is localized in both the chloroplasts and the mitochondria
OsPDF1A	root	Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts	OsPDF1A is more strongly expressed in the roots, while OsPDF1B is expressed at higher levels in mature leaves
