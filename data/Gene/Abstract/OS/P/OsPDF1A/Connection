OsPDF1A	OsPDF1B	Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts	 Rice contains three copies (OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B and OsPDF1B2) of the PDF genes
OsPDF1A	OsPDF1B	Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts	 Unlike OsPDF1A and OsPDF1B, OsPDF1B2 is apparently non-functional, with several deleterious substitutions and deletions
OsPDF1A	OsPDF1B	Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts	 OsPDF1A is more strongly expressed in the roots, while OsPDF1B is expressed at higher levels in mature leaves
OsPDF1A	OsPDF1B	Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts	 Transient expression of PDF-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in the protoplasts demonstrates that, unlike OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B is localized in both the chloroplasts and the mitochondria
OsPDF1A	OsPDF1B2	Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts.	 Rice contains three copies (OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B and OsPDF1B2) of the PDF genes
OsPDF1A	OsPDF1B2	Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts.	 Unlike OsPDF1A and OsPDF1B, OsPDF1B2 is apparently non-functional, with several deleterious substitutions and deletions
