OsMYB4P	OsPht1;4|OsPT4	Overexpression of OsMYB4P, an R2R3-type MYB transcriptional activator, increases phosphate acquisition in rice	Overexpression of OsMYB4P led to greater expression of Pi transporter-family proteins OsPT1, OsPT2, OsPT4, OsPT7, and OsPT8 in shoots, and to decreased or unchanged expression of these proteins in roots, with the exception of OsPT8.
OsPht1;1|OsPT1	OsPht1;4|OsPT4	OsPT4 Contributes to Arsenate Uptake and Transport in Rice.	 We determined the mRNA amounts of OsPTs in rice seedlings, and expressions of OsPT1, OsPT4, and OsPT8 were up-regulated under As(V) conditions
OsPht1;4|OsPT4	OsPht1;8|OsPT8	OsPT4 Contributes to Arsenate Uptake and Transport in Rice.	 We determined the mRNA amounts of OsPTs in rice seedlings, and expressions of OsPT1, OsPT4, and OsPT8 were up-regulated under As(V) conditions
LTN1|OsPHO2|OsRLS1	OsPht1;4|OsPT4	Distribution of phenanthrene in the ospho2 reveals the involvement of phosphate on phenanthrene translocation and accumulation in rice.	 In +Phe WT, the relative expression level of OsPHO2 in the shoots was significantly lower, while those of Pi transporters (PTs) OsPT4 and OsPT8 were significantly higher in the roots compared with -Phe
