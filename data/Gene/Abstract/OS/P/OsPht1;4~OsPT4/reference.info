Considering the sequenced rice genome at hand, only the Oryza sativa phosphate transporter (OsPT) gene OsPT11 was specifically induced during the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. This induction was confined to the root system and was tightly correlated with the degree of root colonization by Glomus intraradices. OsPT11 activation was independent of the nutritional status of the plant and phosphate availability in the rhizosphere. Moreover, infection of roots with the fungal pathogens Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium moniliforme did not activate OsPT11, corroborating the high signal specificity for OsPT11 activation in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. OsPT11 expression complemented a defect in phosphate uptake in a yeast strain mutated in its high-affinity P(i) transporter (pho84), thereby confirming its function. Recently, a phosphate transporter gene in potato was shown to be induced during arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Assessment of the phylogenetic relationship of the rice and potato protein revealed that the rice is nonorthologous to the potato protein. Further, there are no structural commonalities in the promoter regions. Thus, although cytological and physiological features of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis seem to be conserved, the molecular components may differ significantly between distantly related plant species.
NA	Involvement of OsPht1;4 in phosphate acquisition, and mobilization facilitates embryo development in rice.	2015	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, 210095, China.	Phosphate (Pi) transporters mediate acquisition, and transportation of Pi within plants. Here, we investigated the functions of OsPht1;4 (OsPT4), one of the thirteen members of the Pht1 family in rice. qRT-PCR analysis revealed strong expression of OsPT4 in roots and embryos, and OsPT4 promoter analysis using reporter genes confirmed these findings. Analysis using rice protoplasts showed that OsPT4 was localized to plasma membrane. OsPT4 complemented yeast mutant defective in Pi uptake, and also facilitated elevated accumulation of Pi in Xenopus oocytes. Further, OsPT4-genetically modified (GM) rice lines were generated by knockout/down, and overexpression of OsPT4. Pi concentrations in roots, and shoots were significantly lower, and higher in knockout/down, and overexpressing plants, respectively, compared to wild-type under different Pi regimes. (33) Pi uptake translocation assays corroborated altered acquisition, and mobilization of Pi in OsPT4-GM plants. The effects of altered expression levels of OsPT4 in GM plants were also evident on concentration of Pi, and size of embryo, and several attributes related to seed development. Overall, our results suggest that OsPT4 encodes a plasma membrane-localized Pi transporter facilitating acquisition, and mobilization of Pi, and also plays an important role in development of embryo in rice.

NA	The Phosphate Transporter Gene OsPht1;4 Is Involved in Phosphate Homeostasis in Rice.	2015	PLoS One	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, P.R. China.	A total of 13 phosphate transporters in rice (Oryza sative) have been identified as belonging to the Pht1 family, which mediates inorganic phosphate (Pi) uptake and transport. We report the biological property and physiological role of OsPht1;4 (OsPT4). Overexpressing OsPT4 resulted in significant higher Pi accumulation in roots, straw and brown rice, and suppression of OsPT4 caused decreased Pi concentration in straw and brown rice. Expression of the Î²-glucuronidase reporter gene driven by the OsPT4 promoter showed that OsPT4 is expressed in roots, leaves, ligules, stamens, and caryopses under sufficient Pi conditions, consistent with the expression profile showing that OsPT4 has high expression in roots and flag leaves. The transcript level of OsPT4 increased significantly both in shoots and roots with a long time Pi starvation. OsPT4 encoded a plasma membrane-localized protein and was able to complement the function of the Pi transporter gene PHO84 in yeast. We concluded that OsPT4 is a functional Pi-influx transporter involved in Pi absorption in rice that might play a role in Pi translocation. This study will enrich our understanding about the physiological function of rice Pht1 family genes.
