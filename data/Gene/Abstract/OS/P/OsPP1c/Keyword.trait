OsPP1c	seed	Molecular characterization of catalytic-subunit cDNA sequences encoding protein phosphatases 1 and 2A and study of their roles in the gibberellin-dependent Osamy-cexpression in rice	Northern blot analysis showed that OsPP1c and OsPP2Ac genes are expressed in several organs of rice, including seed, shoot and root
