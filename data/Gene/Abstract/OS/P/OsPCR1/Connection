OsPCR1|OsFWL5	OsZIP1	Zinc induced regulation of PCR1 gene for cadmium stress resistance in rice roots.	 Treating the plant with Zn along with Cd distinctly reduced Cd concentration in roots while increasing its own accumulation due to modulation in expression of Zinc-Regulated Transporter (ZRT)-/IRT-Like Protein (OsZIP1) and Plant Cadmium Resistance1 (OsPCR1)
OsPCR1|OsFWL5	OsZIP1	Zinc induced regulation of PCR1 gene for cadmium stress resistance in rice roots.	 Collectively, results point mediated cross-tolerance against Cd stress via by modulating uptake of Cd and Zn and expression of OsZIP1 and OsPCR1, and ROS homeostasis due to fine tuning of ascorbate-glutathione cycle which finally lessened oxidative stress in rice roots
