NA	Rice PCR1 influences grain weight and Zn accumulation in grains.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	POSTECH-UZH Cooperative Laboratory, Department of Integrative Bioscience and Biotechnology, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, 790-784, Korea.	Proteins containing a placenta-specific 8 domain (PLAC8) function as major organ size regulators in Solanum lycopersicum and Zea may, and putative metal ion transporters in Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Brassica juncea. However, it is unknown how PLAC8 domain-containing proteins fulfill such diverse roles. Here, we found that plant cadmium resistance 1 (PCR1) influences both zinc (Zn) accumulation and grain weight in rice. OsPCR1-knockout and -knockdown lines produced lighter grains than the wild type, while OsPCR1-overexpression lines produced heavier grains. Furthermore, the grains of OsPCR1-knockdown lines exhibited substantially higher Zn and lower cadmium (Cd) concentrations than the control, as did yeast heterologously expressing OsPCR1. Through sequence analysis, we showed that the amino acid sequence of japonica-type PCR1 was distinct from that of indica-type and wild rice accessions. This difference was correlated with distinct Zn-related phenotypes. Japonica-type PCR1 had a shorter N-terminus than did PCR1 in the other rice types, and yeast heterologously expressing japonica-type PCR1 was more sensitive to Zn than was yeast expressing indica-type PCR1. Furthermore, japonica-type grains accumulated less Zn than did indica-type grains. Our study suggests that rice PCR1 maintains metal ion homeostasis and grain weight and might have been selected for during domestication.
NA	Overexpression a &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene OsFWL5 improves rice resistance.	2019	Rice (N Y)	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Rice (Oryza sativa) feeds half of the world's population. Rice grain yield and quality which are constrained by diseases and mineral nutritions have important human healthy impacts. Plant &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; (FWL) genes play key roles in modulating plant fruit weight, organ size and iron distribution. Previous work has uncovered that the grains of OsFWL5-oeverexpressing rice accumulated more beneficial element zinc (Zn) and less toxic element cadmium (Cd) content. However, whether FWL genes play roles in rice resistance remains unknown.Here, we validated that one of rice FWL genes OsFWL5 plays a positive role in defense to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Overexpresion of OsFWL5 promotes H2O2 accumulation and cell death. The OsFWL5-overexpresing plants show activated flg22-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and increased resistance to Xoo, indicating that OsFWL5 functions to increase pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity in rice. The activated defense response is associated with increased the expression of genes involved in jasmonic acid (JA)-related signaling. Furthermore, Cd can induce rice resistance to Xoo, and OsFWL5 is required for Cd-induced rice defense response.Putting our finds and previous work together, OsFWL5 could be a candiate gene for breeders to genetically improve rice resistance and grain quality.
NA	Zinc induced regulation of PCR1 gene for cadmium stress resistance in rice roots.	2023	Plant Sci	Crop Nanobiology and Molecular Biology Lab, Amity Institute of Organic Agriculture (AIOA), Amity University, Noida, Sector 125, Noida, Uttar Pradesh.	In this study, the interaction between zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) was investigated in rice roots to evaluate how Zn can protect the plants from Cd stress. Rice seedlings were treated with Cd (100μM) and Zn (100μM) in different combinations (Cd alone, Zn alone, Zn+ Cd, Zn+ Cd+ L-NAME, Zn+ Cd+ L-NAME+ SNP). Rice roots treated with only Zn also displayed similar toxic effects, however when combined with Cd exhibited improved growth. Treating the plant with Zn along with Cd distinctly reduced Cd concentration in roots while increasing its own accumulation due to modulation in expression of Zinc-Regulated Transporter (ZRT)-/IRT-Like Protein (OsZIP1) and Plant Cadmium Resistance1 (OsPCR1). Cd reduced plant biomass, cell viability, pigments, photosynthesis and causing oxidative stress due to inhibition in ascorbate-glutathione cycle. L-NAME (NG-nitro L-arginine methyl ester), prominently suppressed the beneficial impacts of Zn against Cd stress, whereas the presence of a NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), significantly reversed this effect of L-NAME. Collectively, results point mediated cross-tolerance against Cd stress via by modulating uptake of Cd and Zn and expression of OsZIP1 and OsPCR1, and ROS homeostasis due to fine tuning of ascorbate-glutathione cycle which finally lessened oxidative stress in rice roots. The results of this study can be utilized to develop new varieties of rice through genetic modifications which will be of great significance for maintaining crop productivity in Cd-contaminated areas throughout the world.
