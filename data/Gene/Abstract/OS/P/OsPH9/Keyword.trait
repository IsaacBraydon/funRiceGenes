OsPH9	height	BSA-Seq and Fine Linkage Mapping for the Identification of a Novel Locus (qPH9) for Mature Plant Height in Rice (Oryza sativa).	 Subsequent haplotype and sequence analyses indicated that OsPH9 was the most probable candidate gene for plant height at this locus, and functional analysis of osph9 CRISPR/Cas9-generated OsPH9 knockout mutants supported this conclusion
OsPH9	height	BSA-Seq and Fine Linkage Mapping for the Identification of a Novel Locus (qPH9) for Mature Plant Height in Rice (Oryza sativa).	 CONCLUSION: OsPH9 was identified as a novel regulatory gene associated with plant height in rice, along with a height-reducing allele in &#x27;Dongfu-114&#x27; rice, thereby representing an important molecular target for rice improvement
