NA	BSA-Seq and Fine Linkage Mapping for the Identification of a Novel Locus (qPH9) for Mature Plant Height in Rice (Oryza sativa).	2022	Rice (N Y)	Key Laboratory of Germplasm Enhancement, Physiology and Ecology of Food Crops in Cold Region, Ministry of Education, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin, 150030, China.	BACKGROUND: Plant height is a key factor in the determination of rice yield since excessive height can easily cause lodging and reduce yield. Therefore, the identification and analysis of plant height-related genes to elucidate their physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms have significant implications for rice breeding and production. RESULTS: High-throughput quantitative trait locus (QTL) sequencing analysis of a 638-individual F2:3 mapping population resulted in the identification of a novel height-related QTL (qPH9), which was mapped to a 2.02-Mb region of Chromosome 9. Local QTL mapping, which was conducted using 13 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based Kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers for the qPH9 region, and traditional linkage analysis, facilitated the localization of qPH9 to a 126-kb region that contained 15 genes. Subsequent haplotype and sequence analyses indicated that OsPH9 was the most probable candidate gene for plant height at this locus, and functional analysis of osph9 CRISPR/Cas9-generated OsPH9 knockout mutants supported this conclusion. CONCLUSION: OsPH9 was identified as a novel regulatory gene associated with plant height in rice, along with a height-reducing allele in &#x27;Dongfu-114&#x27; rice, thereby representing an important molecular target for rice improvement. The findings of the present study are expected to spur the investigation of genetic mechanisms underlying rice plant height and further the improvement of rice plant height through marker-assisted selection.
