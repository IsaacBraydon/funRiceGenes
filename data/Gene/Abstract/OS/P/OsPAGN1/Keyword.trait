OsPAGN1	growth	A New RING Finger Protein, PLANT ARCHITECTURE and GRAIN NUMBER 1, Affects Plant Architecture and Grain Yield in Rice.	 Therefore, our findings have clarified the OsPAGN1 functions related to rice growth and grain development
OsPAGN1	development	A New RING Finger Protein, PLANT ARCHITECTURE and GRAIN NUMBER 1, Affects Plant Architecture and Grain Yield in Rice.	 Therefore, our findings have clarified the OsPAGN1 functions related to rice growth and grain development
OsPAGN1	grain	A New RING Finger Protein, PLANT ARCHITECTURE and GRAIN NUMBER 1, Affects Plant Architecture and Grain Yield in Rice.	 Therefore, our findings have clarified the OsPAGN1 functions related to rice growth and grain development
OsPAGN1	panicle	A New RING Finger Protein, PLANT ARCHITECTURE and GRAIN NUMBER 1, Affects Plant Architecture and Grain Yield in Rice.	 We demonstrated that OsPAGN1 can interact directly with OsCNR10 (CELL NUMBER REGULATOR10), which negatively regulates the number of rice grains per panicle
OsPAGN1	grains per panicle	A New RING Finger Protein, PLANT ARCHITECTURE and GRAIN NUMBER 1, Affects Plant Architecture and Grain Yield in Rice.	 We demonstrated that OsPAGN1 can interact directly with OsCNR10 (CELL NUMBER REGULATOR10), which negatively regulates the number of rice grains per panicle
OsPAGN1	yield	A New RING Finger Protein, PLANT ARCHITECTURE and GRAIN NUMBER 1, Affects Plant Architecture and Grain Yield in Rice.	 Thus, OsPAGN1 may be useful for the genetic improvement of plant architecture and yield
OsPAGN1	architecture	A New RING Finger Protein, PLANT ARCHITECTURE and GRAIN NUMBER 1, Affects Plant Architecture and Grain Yield in Rice.	 Thus, OsPAGN1 may be useful for the genetic improvement of plant architecture and yield
OsPAGN1	plant architecture	A New RING Finger Protein, PLANT ARCHITECTURE and GRAIN NUMBER 1, Affects Plant Architecture and Grain Yield in Rice.	 Thus, OsPAGN1 may be useful for the genetic improvement of plant architecture and yield
