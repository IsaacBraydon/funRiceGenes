OsPHO1;1	xylem	Node-localized transporters of phosphorus essential for seed development in rice.	 OsPHO1;1 was mainly localized at the phloem region of diffuse vascular bundles of node I, while OsPHO1;2 was expressed in the xylem parenchyma cells of the enlarged vascular bundles
OsPHO1;1	xylem	Node-localized transporters of phosphorus essential for seed development in rice.	 Taken together, OsPHO1;2 expressed in node I is responsible for unloading of P from the xylem of enlarged vascular bundles, while OsPHO1;1 is involved in reloading P into phloem of diffuse vascular bundles for subsequent allocation of P to the seeds
OsPHO1;1	vascular bundle	Node-localized transporters of phosphorus essential for seed development in rice.	 OsPHO1;1 was mainly localized at the phloem region of diffuse vascular bundles of node I, while OsPHO1;2 was expressed in the xylem parenchyma cells of the enlarged vascular bundles
