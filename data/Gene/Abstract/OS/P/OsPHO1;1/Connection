OsPHO1;1	OsPHO1;2	Node-localized transporters of phosphorus essential for seed development in rice.	 Here, we found that two members (OsPHO1;1 and OsPHO1;2) belonging to PHO1 gene family, are involved in the distribution of P to the seeds in rice
OsPHO1;1	OsPHO1;2	Node-localized transporters of phosphorus essential for seed development in rice.	 Both OsPHO1;1 and OsPHO1;2 were localized to the plasma membrane and showed influx transport activities for inorganic phosphate
OsPHO1;1	OsPHO1;2	Node-localized transporters of phosphorus essential for seed development in rice.	 At the reproductive stage, both OsPHO1;1 and OsPHO1;2 showed higher expression in the node I, the uppermost node connecting to panicle
OsPHO1;1	OsPHO1;2	Node-localized transporters of phosphorus essential for seed development in rice.	 OsPHO1;1 was mainly localized at the phloem region of diffuse vascular bundles of node I, while OsPHO1;2 was expressed in the xylem parenchyma cells of the enlarged vascular bundles
OsPHO1;1	OsPHO1;2	Node-localized transporters of phosphorus essential for seed development in rice.	 In addition, they were also expressed in the ovular vascular trace, the outer layer of the inner integument (OsPHO1;1) and the nucellar epidermis (OsPHO1;2) of caryopsis
OsPHO1;1	OsPHO1;2	Node-localized transporters of phosphorus essential for seed development in rice.	 Knockout of OsPHO1;2 as well as OsPHO1;1 with less extent decreased the distribution of P to the seed, resulting in decreased seed size and delayed germination
OsPHO1;1	OsPHO1;2	Node-localized transporters of phosphorus essential for seed development in rice.	 Taken together, OsPHO1;2 expressed in node I is responsible for unloading of P from the xylem of enlarged vascular bundles, while OsPHO1;1 is involved in reloading P into phloem of diffuse vascular bundles for subsequent allocation of P to the seeds
OsPHO1;1	OsPHO1;2	Node-localized transporters of phosphorus essential for seed development in rice.	 Furthermore, OsPHO1;1 and OsPHO1;2 expressed in the caryopsis are important for delivering of P from the maternal tissues to the filial tissues for seed development
