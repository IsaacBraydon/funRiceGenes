NA	The Involvement of OsPHO1;1 in the Regulation of Iron Transport Through Integration of Phosphate and Zinc Deficiency Signaling.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Biochimie et Physiologie Mol√©culaire des Plantes Research Unit, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique - Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique - Montpellier UniversityMontpellier, France; Agronomy Division, Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Chiang Mai UniversityChiang Mai, Thailand.	Plants survival depends on their ability to cope with multiple nutrient stresses that often occur simultaneously, such as the limited availability of essential elements inorganic phosphate (Pi), zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe). Previous research has provided information on the genes involved in efforts by plants to maintain homeostasis when a single nutrient (Pi, Zn, or Fe) is depleted. Recent findings on nutritional stress suggest that plant growth capacity is influenced by a complex tripartite interaction between Pi, Zn, and Fe homeostasis. However, despite its importance, how plants integrate multiple nutritional stimuli into complex developmental programs, and which genes are involved in this tripartite (Pi ZnFe) interaction is still not clear. The aim of this study was to examine the physiological and molecular responses of rice (Oriza sativa L.) to a combination of Pi, Zn, and/or Fe deficiency stress conditions. Results showed that Fe deficiency had the most drastic single-nutrient effect on biomass, while the Zn deficiency-effect depended on the presence of Pi in the medium. Interestingly, the observed negative effect of Fe starvation was alleviated by concomitant Pi or PiZn depletion. Members of the OsPHO1 family showed a differential transcriptional regulation in response PiZnFe combinatory stress conditions. Particularly, the transcripts of the OsPHO1;1 sense and its natural antisense cis-NatPHO1;1 showed the highest accumulation under PiZn deficiency. In this condition, the Ospho1;1 mutants showed over-accumulation of Fe in roots compared to wild type plants. These data reveal coordination between pathways involved in Fe transport and PiZn signaling in rice which involves the OsPHO1; 1, and support the hypothesis of a genetic basis for Pi, Zn, and Fe signaling interactions in plants.
NA	Node-localized transporters of phosphorus essential for seed development in rice.	2020	Plant Cell Physiol.	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Chuo 2-20-1, Kurashiki, Japan.	About 60-85% of total phosphorus (P) in cereal crops is finally allocated to the seeds, which is required for seed development, germination, and early growth. However, little is known on the molecular mechanisms underlying P allocation to the seeds. Here, we found that two members (OsPHO1;1 and OsPHO1;2) belonging to PHO1 gene family, are involved in the distribution of P to the seeds in rice. Both OsPHO1;1 and OsPHO1;2 were localized to the plasma membrane and showed influx transport activities for inorganic phosphate. At the reproductive stage, both OsPHO1;1 and OsPHO1;2 showed higher expression in the node I, the uppermost node connecting to panicle. OsPHO1;1 was mainly localized at the phloem region of diffuse vascular bundles of node I, while OsPHO1;2 was expressed in the xylem parenchyma cells of the enlarged vascular bundles. In addition, they were also expressed in the ovular vascular trace, the outer layer of the inner integument (OsPHO1;1) and the nucellar epidermis (OsPHO1;2) of caryopsis. Knockout of OsPHO1;2 as well as OsPHO1;1 with less extent decreased the distribution of P to the seed, resulting in decreased seed size and delayed germination. Taken together, OsPHO1;2 expressed in node I is responsible for unloading of P from the xylem of enlarged vascular bundles, while OsPHO1;1 is involved in reloading P into phloem of diffuse vascular bundles for subsequent allocation of P to the seeds. Furthermore, OsPHO1;1 and OsPHO1;2 expressed in the caryopsis are important for delivering of P from the maternal tissues to the filial tissues for seed development.
