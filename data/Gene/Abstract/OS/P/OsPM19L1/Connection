OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	OsPM19L1|OsPM1	Characterization of OsPM19L1 encoding an AWPM-19-like family protein that is dramatically induced by osmotic stress in rice.	Moreover, under stress conditions, OsPM19L1 expression was enhanced in an ABI5-Like1 (ABL1) deficiency rice mutant, abl1, suggesting that ABL1 negatively regulates OsPM19L1 gene expression
OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	OsPM19L1|OsPM1	The AWPM-19 Family Protein OsPM1 Mediates Abscisic Acid Influx and Drought Response in Rice.	 Further investigation revealed that OsPM1 expression is regulated by the AREB/ABF family transcription factor OsbZIP46
OsDREB1F|RCBF2	OsPM19L1|OsPM1	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	 Quantitative real time RT-PCR suggested that seven genes may be regulated by OsNAC45 including OsCYP89G1, OsDREB1F, OsEREBP2, OsERF104, OsPM1, OsSAMDC2, and OsSIK1
OsEREBP2|ERF99	OsPM19L1|OsPM1	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	 Quantitative real time RT-PCR suggested that seven genes may be regulated by OsNAC45 including OsCYP89G1, OsDREB1F, OsEREBP2, OsERF104, OsPM1, OsSAMDC2, and OsSIK1
OsLEA3|OsLEA3-1	OsPM19L1|OsPM1	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	 Previous reports have demonstrated that overexpression of OsNAC45 enhances salt and drought tolerance in rice, and that OsNAC45 may regulate the expression of two specific genes, OsPM1 and OsLEA3-1
OsPM19L1|OsPM1	OsSIK1|OsERL	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	 Quantitative real time RT-PCR suggested that seven genes may be regulated by OsNAC45 including OsCYP89G1, OsDREB1F, OsEREBP2, OsERF104, OsPM1, OsSAMDC2, and OsSIK1
ONAC045|OsNAC45	OsPM19L1|OsPM1	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	 Previous reports have demonstrated that overexpression of OsNAC45 enhances salt and drought tolerance in rice, and that OsNAC45 may regulate the expression of two specific genes, OsPM1 and OsLEA3-1
