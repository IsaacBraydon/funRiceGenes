OsPM19L1	 Tissue-specific gene expression analysis revealed that OsPM19L1 was highly expressed in the leaf sheath of rice |  Interestingly, expression of OsPM19L1 was high at the early stage of panicle development and decreased thereafter |  Moreover, under stress conditions, OsPM19L1 expression was enhanced in an ABI5-Like1 (ABL1) deficiency rice mutant, abl1, suggesting that ABL1 negatively regulates OsPM19L1 gene expression
