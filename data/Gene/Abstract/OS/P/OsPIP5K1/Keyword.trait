OsPIP5K1	growth	DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.	DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.
OsPIP5K1	growth	DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.	 Overall, our data suggest that nuclear localized OsPIP5K1 acts with DWT1 and/or DWL2 to coordinate the uniform growth of rice shoots, likely through nuclear phosphoinositide signals, which provides insights into the regulation of rice uniformity via a largely unexplored plant nuclear signaling pathway
OsPIP5K1	shoot	DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.	 Mutation of OsPIP5K1 compounds the dwarf dwt1 phenotype but abolishes the main shoot dominance
OsPIP5K1	dwarf	DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.	 Mutation of OsPIP5K1 compounds the dwarf dwt1 phenotype but abolishes the main shoot dominance
