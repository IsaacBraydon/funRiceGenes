Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc), which causes rice bacterial leaf streak, invades leaves mainly through stomata, which are often closed as a plant immune response against pathogen invasion. How Xoc overcomes stomatal immunity is unclear. Here, we show that the effector protein AvrRxo1, an ATP-dependent protease, enhances Xoc virulence and inhibits stomatal immunity by targeting and degrading rice OsPDX1 (pyridoxal phosphate synthase), thereby reducing vitamin B6 (VB6) levels in rice. VB6 is required for the activity of aldehyde oxidase, which catalyzes the last step of abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, and ABA positively regulates rice stomatal immunity against Xoc. Thus, we provide evidence supporting a model in which a major bacterial pathogen inhibits plant stomatal immunity by directly targeting VB6 biosynthesis and consequently inhibiting the biosynthesis of ABA in guard cells to open stomata. Moreover, AvrRxo1-mediated VB6 targeting also explains the poor nutritional quality, including low VB6 levels, of Xoc-infected rice grains.
