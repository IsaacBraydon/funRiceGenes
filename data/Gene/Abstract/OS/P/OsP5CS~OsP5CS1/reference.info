In both rice lines, salt-stress induced OsP5CS1 gene expression, suggesting that proline accumulation occurs via OsP5CS1 gene expression during salt stress. An increase in the endogenous ABA level was required for the induction of OsP5CS1 gene expression by salt stress. Under salt stress, topical ABA application-induced OsP5CS1 gene expression only in the salt-resistant line but up-regulated OsP5CR gene expression in both rice lines, suggesting that the increased proline accumulation and salt resistance induced by topical ABA application may result from the up-regulation of OsP5CR and not, directly at least, from OsP5CS1. Moreover, exogenous ABA application up-regulates OsCam1-1 (the salt-stress-responsive calmodulin) gene expression, and calmodulin was shown to play a role in the signal transduction cascade in proline accumulation during salt stress. These data suggest the role of the calmodulin signaling cascade and the induction of OsP5CR gene expression in proline accumulation by exogenous ABA application.
1-s2.0-S0168945203003017-main.pdf	Proline accumulation and Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase gene properties in three rice cultivars differing in salinity and drought tolerance	2003	Plant Science	Laboratory of Plant Genetics, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Campus Etterbeek, Gebouw E Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium	Three indica rice cultivars (Oryza sativa) differing in their tolerance to salt and drought stress in field conditions in Vietnam were analyzed at the molecular and biochemical levels with the goal to reveal the basis for their differential behavior and in particular their ability to accumulate proline. An in vitro growth test showed that after a 7-day period of stress, the fresh weight of plantlet roots appears to be a relevant parameter for differentiating drought and salt tolerance of the concerned cultivars. Sodium level was lower in the salt tolerant cultivar than in the other rice cultivars. Proline accumulation in roots of tolerant cultivars starts earlier after the initiation of the stress treatment than that of the osmotic stress sensitive cultivar and also reaches a higher level. Proline accumulation was not related to proteolysis and so could be the result from induction of proline biosynthesis by osmotic stress. However, neither the sequence of amino acids involved in the proline feedback inhibition of the key regulatory enzyme Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS; EC not assigned), nor the expression of the p5cs genes were modified in the tolerant cultivars. These observations suggest that proline accumulation in roots is a possible indicator of the osmotic tolerance in these rice cultivars. However, other mechanisms than those related to a change in P5CS regulation are responsible for the increased proline content.
1-s2.0-S0168945213002628-main.pdf	Overexpression of the receptor-like protein kinase genes AtRPK1 and OsRPK1 reduces the salt tolerance of Arabidopsis thaliana	2014	Plant Sci	College of Life Science, Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang 050024, PR China.	AtRPK1 (AT1G69270) is a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase (LRR-RLK) gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. The rice gene Os07g0602700 (OsRPK1) is the homolog of AtRPK1. AtRPK1 and OsRPK1 were overexpressed and the expression of AtRPK1 was inhibited by RNAi in A. thaliana. The functional results showed that the degrees of salt tolerance of the 35S:RPK1 A. thaliana plants were significantly lower than that of the control plants. The AtRPK1-RNAi A. thaliana plants exhibited higher salt tolerance than the wild-type plants (Col). The subcellular localisation results showed that the RPK1 proteins were mainly distributed on the cell membrane and that the overexpressed AtRPK1 proteins exhibited a significantly clustered distribution. The physiological analyses revealed that the overexpression of the RPK1 genes increased the membrane permeability in the transgenic A. thaliana plants. In response to salt stress, these plants exhibited an increased Na(+) flux into the cell, which caused greater damage to the cell. The real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that the expression of the P5CS1 gene was inhibited and the SOS signalling pathway was blocked in the 35S:AtRPK1 A. thaliana plants. These effects at least partially contribute to the salt-sensitive phenotype of the 35S:RPK1 plants.
10.1007-s00425-007-0548-5.pdf	Overexpression of OsCOIN, a putative cold inducible zinc finger protein, increased tolerance to chilling, salt and drought, and enhanced proline level in rice	2007	Planta	Key Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Environmental Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing 100093, China.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) plant is sensitive to chilling, particularly at early stages of seedling development. Here a novel cold-inducible gene, designated OsCOIN (Oryza sativa cold-inducible), was isolated and characterized. Results showed that OsCOIN protein, a RING finger protein, was localized in both nuclear and cytoplasm membrane. OsCOIN is expressed in all rice organs and strongly induced by low temperature, ABA, salt and drought. Over-expression of OsCOIN in transgenic rice lines significantly enhanced their tolerance to cold, salt and drought, accompanied by an up-regulation of OsP5CS expression and an increase of cellular proline level.
erq120.pdf	Functional analysis of a novel Cys2/His2-type zinc finger protein involved in salt tolerance in rice	2010	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	The Cys2/His2-type zinc finger proteins have been implicated in different cellular processes involved in plant development and stress responses. Through microarray analysis, a salt-responsive zinc finger protein gene ZFP179 was identified and subsequently cloned from rice seedlings. ZFP179 encodes a 17.95 kDa protein with two C2H2-type zinc finger motifs having transcriptional activation activity. The real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that ZFP179 was highly expressed in immature spikes, and markedly induced in the seedlings by NaCl, PEG 6000, and ABA treatments. Overexpression of ZFP179 in rice increased salt tolerance and the transgenic seedlings showed hypersensitivity to exogenous ABA. The increased levels of free proline and soluble sugars were observed in transgenic plants compared to wild-type plants under salt stress. The ZFP179 transgenic rice exhibited significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging ability, and expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including OsDREB2A, OsP5CS OsProT, and OsLea3 under salt stress. Our studies suggest that ZFP179 plays a crucial role in the plant response to salt stress, and is useful in developing transgenic crops with enhanced tolerance to salt stress.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs00299-013-1532-0.pdf	Overexpression of a new stress-repressive gene OsDSR2 encoding a protein with a DUF966 domain increases salt and simulated drought stress sensitivities and reduces ABA sensitivity in rice	2014	Plant Cell Rep	Xiamen Key Laboratory for Plant Genetics, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, China.	Domain of Unknown Function 966 (DUF966) gene family was found in the protein family database, which consisted of seven genes in rice. The proteins encoded by these genes contained one or two highly conserved DUF966 domains. The available data of public microarray databases implied that these genes might play crucial roles in plant response to abiotic stresses. In this study, a member of the DUF966 gene family, DUF966-stress repressive gene 2 in Oryza sativa (OsDSR2, Loc_Os01g62200), was cloned and its role in rice responding to salt and simulated drought stresses was functionally characterized. OsDSR2 was expressed mainly in nodes of stems and leaf blades from rice. Expression profile analysis of adversity showed that OsDSR2 had different transcriptional responses to salt, drought, cold, heat and oxidative (H2O2) stresses, as well as abscisic acid (ABA), methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, gibberellin acid and auxin treatments. Transient expression demonstrated that OsDSR2 was localized in the membrane and nucleus. Overexpression of OsDSR2 could increase salt and simulated drought (polyethyleneglycol)-stress sensitivities in rice by downregulating the expression of ABA- and stress-responsive genes including OsNCED4, SNAC1, OsbZIP23, P5CS, Oslea3 and rab16C. Furthermore, OsDSR2-overexpressing plants showed reduced ABA sensitivity during the post-germination stage. These results suggested that OsDSR2 negatively regulated rice response to salt and simulated drought stresses as well as ABA signaling, which provided some useful data for understanding the functional roles of DUF966 family genes in abiotic stress responses in plants.
art%3A10.1023%2FA%3A1005702408601.pdf	Characterization of the gene for delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase and correlation between the expression of the gene and salt tolerance in Oryza sativa L.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	Advanced Research Laboratory, Hitachi Ltd., Hatoyama, Saitama, Japan.	A cDNA for delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) synthetase (cOsP5CS), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of proline, was isolated and characterized from a cDNA library prepared from 14-day-old seedlings of Oryza sativa cv. Akibare. The deduced amino acid sequence of the P5CS protein (OsP5CS) from O. sativa exhibited 74.2% and 75.5% homology to that of the P5CS from Arabidopsis thaliana and Vigna aconitifolia, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that the gene for P5CS (OsP5CS) was induced by high salt, dehydration, treatment of ABA and cold treatment, while it was not induced by heat treatment. Simultaneously, accumulation of proline was observed as a result of high salt treatment in O. sativa. Moreover, the levels of expression of OsP5CS mRNA and content of proline under salt stress condition were compared between a salt-tolerant cultivar, Dee-gee-woo-gen (DGWG) and a salt-sensitive breeding line, IR28. It was observed that the expression of the P5CS gene and the accumulation of proline in DGWG steadily increased, whereas those in IR28 increased slightly.
