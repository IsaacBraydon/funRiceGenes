OsPCS1	stress	Identification of alternatively spliced transcripts of rice phytochelatin synthase 2 gene OsPCS2 involved in mitigation of cadmium and arsenic stresses.	 Analysis of the transgenic rice lines grown under metal(loid) stress revealed almost complete absence of both OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 transcripts in the developing seeds coupled with the significant reduction in the content of Cd (~51%) and As (~35%) in grains compared with the non-transgenic plant
OsPCS1	map-based cloning	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	 Map-based cloning identified the responsible genes as OsABCC1 in has1 and OsPCS1 in has2
OsPCS1	cadmium	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	 In vitro phytochelatin synthesis assay indicated that OsPCS1 was more sensitive to activation by As than by cadmium, whereas OsPCS2 was more weakly activated by As than by cadmium
OsPCS1	node	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	 The levels of As in grains and node I were similar between the two mutants, suggesting that OsABCC1 preferentially cooperates with OsPCS1 to sequester As, although rice has another phytochelatin synthase, OsPCS2
OsPCS1	seedlings	Phytochelatin synthase has contrasting effects on cadmium and arsenic accumulation in rice grains.	 Quantitative RT-PCR of each OsPCS transcript in rice seedlings suggested that expression of OsPCS1full, the longest OsPCS1 variant, was most abundant, followed by OsPCS2
OsPCS1	tolerance	Phytochelatin synthase has contrasting effects on cadmium and arsenic accumulation in rice grains.	 To address physiological functions in toxic element tolerance and accumulation, two independent OsPCS1 mutant rice lines (a T-DNA and a Tos17 insertion line) were identified
OsPCS1	tolerance	Phytochelatin synthase has contrasting effects on cadmium and arsenic accumulation in rice grains.	 The OsPCS1 mutants exhibited increased sensitivity to As(III) and Cd in hydroponic experiments, showing the importance of OsPCS1-dependent PC synthesis for rice As(III) and Cd tolerance
OsPCS1	cadmium	Phytochelatin synthase has contrasting effects on cadmium and arsenic accumulation in rice grains.	 Using rice as a cereal model, we examined physiological roles of OsPCS1 in the distribution and detoxification of arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd), two toxic elements associated with major food safety concerns
OsPCS1	cadmium	Domain exchange between Oryza sativa phytochelatin synthases reveals a region that determines responsiveness to arsenic and heavy metals.	) has two PCSs (OsPCS1 and OsPCS2), and we previously revealed that OsPCS1 has a higher responsiveness to arsenic than to cadmium, while OsPCS2 has a higher responsiveness to cadmium than to arsenic
OsPCS1	arsenite	Domain exchange between Oryza sativa phytochelatin synthases reveals a region that determines responsiveness to arsenic and heavy metals.	 A chimeric protein in which the 183<U+00A0>C-terminal amino acids of OsPCS2 were replaced with the 185<U+00A0>C-terminal amino acids of OsPCS1 showed higher responsiveness to arsenite than to cadmium, similar to OsPCS1
