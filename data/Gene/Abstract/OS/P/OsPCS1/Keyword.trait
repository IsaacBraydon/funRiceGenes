OsPCS1	stress	Identification of alternatively spliced transcripts of rice phytochelatin synthase 2 gene OsPCS2 involved in mitigation of cadmium and arsenic stresses.	 Analysis of the transgenic rice lines grown under metal(loid) stress revealed almost complete absence of both OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 transcripts in the developing seeds coupled with the significant reduction in the content of Cd (~51%) and As (~35%) in grains compared with the non-transgenic plant
OsPCS1	map-based cloning	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	 Map-based cloning identified the responsible genes as OsABCC1 in has1 and OsPCS1 in has2
OsPCS1	cadmium	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	 In vitro phytochelatin synthesis assay indicated that OsPCS1 was more sensitive to activation by As than by cadmium, whereas OsPCS2 was more weakly activated by As than by cadmium
OsPCS1	node	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	 The levels of As in grains and node I were similar between the two mutants, suggesting that OsABCC1 preferentially cooperates with OsPCS1 to sequester As, although rice has another phytochelatin synthase, OsPCS2
