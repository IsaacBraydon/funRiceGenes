NA	Identification of alternatively spliced transcripts of rice phytochelatin synthase 2 gene OsPCS2 involved in mitigation of cadmium and arsenic stresses.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, 721302, India.	The OsPCS2 exhibits root- and shoot-specific differential ratios of alternatively spliced transcripts in indica rice under Cd stress, and plays role in Cd and As stress tolerance and accumulation. Enzymatic activity of phytochelatin synthase (PCS) in plant produces phytochelatins, which help in sequestration of heavy metal(loid)s inside the cell vacuole to alleviate toxicity. Here we report that among the two PCS genes-OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 in indica rice (Oryza sativa) cultivar, the OsPCS2 produces an alternatively spliced OsPCS2b transcript that bears the unusual premature termination codon besides the canonically spliced OsPCS2a transcript. Root- and shoot-specific differential ratios of alternatively spliced OsPCS2a and OsPCS2b transcript expressions were observed under cadmium stress. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells transformed with OsPCS2a exhibited increased cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) tolerance and accumulation, unlike the OsPCS2b transformed yeast cells. An intron-containing hairpin RNA-mediated gene silencing was carried out in endosperm-specific manner for efficient down-regulation of OsPCS genes in rice grains. Analysis of the transgenic rice lines grown under metal(loid) stress revealed almost complete absence of both OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 transcripts in the developing seeds coupled with the significant reduction in the content of Cd (~51%) and As (~35%) in grains compared with the non-transgenic plant. Taken together, the findings indicate towards a crucial role played by the tissue-specific alternative splicing and relative abundance of the OsPCS2 gene during heavy metal(loid) stress mitigation in rice plant.
NA	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	2017	Plant J	Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, 305-8604, Japan.	Reduction of the levels of arsenic (As) in rice grains is an important challenge for agriculture. A recent study reported that the OsABCC1 transporter prevents As accumulation in grains by sequestering As-phytochelatin complexes into vacuoles in the upper nodes. However, how phytochelatins are provided in response to As remains unclear. Here, we show that the phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing As levels in rice grains. Using a forward genetic approach, we isolated two rice mutants (has1 and has2) in which As levels were much higher in grains but significantly lower in node I in comparison with the wild type. Map-based cloning identified the responsible genes as OsABCC1 in has1 and OsPCS1 in has2. The levels of As in grains and node I were similar between the two mutants, suggesting that OsABCC1 preferentially cooperates with OsPCS1 to sequester As, although rice has another phytochelatin synthase, OsPCS2. In vitro phytochelatin synthesis assay indicated that OsPCS1 was more sensitive to activation by As than by cadmium, whereas OsPCS2 was more weakly activated by As than by cadmium. Transgenic plants highly expressing OsPCS1 showed significantly lower As levels in grains than wild-type plants did. Our results provide new knowledge of the relative contribution of rice PCS paralogs to As sequestration and suggests a good candidate tool to reduce As levels in rice grains.
