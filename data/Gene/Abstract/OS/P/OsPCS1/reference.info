NA	Identification of alternatively spliced transcripts of rice phytochelatin synthase 2 gene OsPCS2 involved in mitigation of cadmium and arsenic stresses.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, 721302, India.	The OsPCS2 exhibits root- and shoot-specific differential ratios of alternatively spliced transcripts in indica rice under Cd stress, and plays role in Cd and As stress tolerance and accumulation. Enzymatic activity of phytochelatin synthase (PCS) in plant produces phytochelatins, which help in sequestration of heavy metal(loid)s inside the cell vacuole to alleviate toxicity. Here we report that among the two PCS genes-OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 in indica rice (Oryza sativa) cultivar, the OsPCS2 produces an alternatively spliced OsPCS2b transcript that bears the unusual premature termination codon besides the canonically spliced OsPCS2a transcript. Root- and shoot-specific differential ratios of alternatively spliced OsPCS2a and OsPCS2b transcript expressions were observed under cadmium stress. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells transformed with OsPCS2a exhibited increased cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) tolerance and accumulation, unlike the OsPCS2b transformed yeast cells. An intron-containing hairpin RNA-mediated gene silencing was carried out in endosperm-specific manner for efficient down-regulation of OsPCS genes in rice grains. Analysis of the transgenic rice lines grown under metal(loid) stress revealed almost complete absence of both OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 transcripts in the developing seeds coupled with the significant reduction in the content of Cd (~51%) and As (~35%) in grains compared with the non-transgenic plant. Taken together, the findings indicate towards a crucial role played by the tissue-specific alternative splicing and relative abundance of the OsPCS2 gene during heavy metal(loid) stress mitigation in rice plant.
NA	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	2017	Plant J	Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, 305-8604, Japan.	Reduction of the levels of arsenic (As) in rice grains is an important challenge for agriculture. A recent study reported that the OsABCC1 transporter prevents As accumulation in grains by sequestering As-phytochelatin complexes into vacuoles in the upper nodes. However, how phytochelatins are provided in response to As remains unclear. Here, we show that the phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing As levels in rice grains. Using a forward genetic approach, we isolated two rice mutants (has1 and has2) in which As levels were much higher in grains but significantly lower in node I in comparison with the wild type. Map-based cloning identified the responsible genes as OsABCC1 in has1 and OsPCS1 in has2. The levels of As in grains and node I were similar between the two mutants, suggesting that OsABCC1 preferentially cooperates with OsPCS1 to sequester As, although rice has another phytochelatin synthase, OsPCS2. In vitro phytochelatin synthesis assay indicated that OsPCS1 was more sensitive to activation by As than by cadmium, whereas OsPCS2 was more weakly activated by As than by cadmium. Transgenic plants highly expressing OsPCS1 showed significantly lower As levels in grains than wild-type plants did. Our results provide new knowledge of the relative contribution of rice PCS paralogs to As sequestration and suggests a good candidate tool to reduce As levels in rice grains.

NA	Phytochelatin synthase has contrasting effects on cadmium and arsenic accumulation in rice grains.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Public Health, School of Pharmacy, Kitasato University, 5-9-1 Shirokane, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8641, Japan.	Phytochelatin (PC) synthesis has been well demonstrated as a major metal tolerance mechanism in Arabidopsis thaliana, whereas its contribution to long-distance element transport especially in monocots remains elusive. Using rice as a cereal model, we examined physiological roles of OsPCS1 in the distribution and detoxification of arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd), two toxic elements associated with major food safety concerns. First, we isolated four different transcript variants of OsPCS1 as well as one from OsPCS2. Quantitative RT-PCR of each OsPCS transcript in rice seedlings suggested that expression of OsPCS1full, the longest OsPCS1 variant, was most abundant, followed by OsPCS2. Heterologous expression of OsPCS variants in PCS deficient mutants of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and A. thaliana suggested that OsPCS1full possessed PCS activity in response to As(III) and Cd while the activity of other PCS variants was very low. To address physiological functions in toxic element tolerance and accumulation, two independent OsPCS1 mutant rice lines (a T-DNA and a Tos17 insertion line) were identified. The OsPCS1 mutants exhibited increased sensitivity to As(III) and Cd in hydroponic experiments, showing the importance of OsPCS1-dependent PC synthesis for rice As(III) and Cd tolerance. Elemental analyses of rice plants grown in soil with environmentally relevant As and Cd concentrations showed increased As accumulation and decreased Cd accumulation in grains of the T-DNA line. The Tos17 mutant also exhibited the reduced Cd accumulation phenotype. These contrasting effects on As and Cd distribution to grains suggest the existence of at least partially distinct PC-dependent pathways for As and Cd.
NA	Domain exchange between Oryza sativa phytochelatin synthases reveals a region that determines responsiveness to arsenic and heavy metals.	2020	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, 305-8604, Japan.	Phytochelatin synthases (PCSs) are activated by toxic metals/metalloids such as cadmium and arsenic and synthesize phytochelatins for detoxification of toxic elements. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) has two PCSs (OsPCS1 and OsPCS2), and we previously revealed that OsPCS1 has a higher responsiveness to arsenic than to cadmium, while OsPCS2 has a higher responsiveness to cadmium than to arsenic. Moreover, we found that the specific responsiveness of OsPCS1 to arsenic at rice nodes is a key factor in reducing arsenic in rice grains. However, the molecular characteristics of two PCSs in rice that contribute to the responsiveness to arsenic or heavy metals, including Cd, remain unclear. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the C-terminal region in PCSs determines the responsiveness to arsenic or cadmium. We constructed chimeric proteins between OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 and performed an in<U+00A0>vitro phytochelatin synthesis assay. A chimeric protein in which the 183<U+00A0>C-terminal amino acids of OsPCS2 were replaced with the 185<U+00A0>C-terminal amino acids of OsPCS1 showed higher responsiveness to arsenite than to cadmium, similar to OsPCS1. Contrary to expectations, mutations of cysteine residues that are unique to OsPCS1 or OsPCS2 had little influence on the responsiveness, although cysteine residues are reported to be representative of sites that interact with metals/metalloids. These results would enable the development of a breeding technology for reducing arsenic in rice grains by improving the arsenic-dependent activation of PCSs.
