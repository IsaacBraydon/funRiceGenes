OsABCC1|MRP1	OsPCS1	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	 Map-based cloning identified the responsible genes as OsABCC1 in has1 and OsPCS1 in has2
OsABCC1|MRP1	OsPCS1	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	 The levels of As in grains and node I were similar between the two mutants, suggesting that OsABCC1 preferentially cooperates with OsPCS1 to sequester As, although rice has another phytochelatin synthase, OsPCS2
OsPCS1	OsPCS2	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	 The levels of As in grains and node I were similar between the two mutants, suggesting that OsABCC1 preferentially cooperates with OsPCS1 to sequester As, although rice has another phytochelatin synthase, OsPCS2
OsPCS1	OsPCS2	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	 In vitro phytochelatin synthesis assay indicated that OsPCS1 was more sensitive to activation by As than by cadmium, whereas OsPCS2 was more weakly activated by As than by cadmium
OsPCS1	OsPCS2	Phytochelatin synthase has contrasting effects on cadmium and arsenic accumulation in rice grains.	 First, we isolated four different transcript variants of OsPCS1 as well as one from OsPCS2
OsPCS1	OsPCS2	Phytochelatin synthase has contrasting effects on cadmium and arsenic accumulation in rice grains.	 Quantitative RT-PCR of each OsPCS transcript in rice seedlings suggested that expression of OsPCS1full, the longest OsPCS1 variant, was most abundant, followed by OsPCS2
