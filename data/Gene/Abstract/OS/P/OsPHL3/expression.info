OsPHL3	Identification of a G2-like transcription factor, OsPHL3, functions as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by co-expression and reverse genetic analysis. | We predicted a G2-like family transcription factor, OsPHL3, by co-expression networks analysis with photoperiodic flowering pathway genes |  OsPHL3 was mainly expressed in the leaves and exhibited a circadian rhythmic expression pattern |  Further analysis indicated that OsPHL3 delayed flowering time by down-regulating the expression of Hd3a and RFT1 through promoting Hd1 under long-day conditions (LDs), or suppressing Ehd1/Hd1 under short-day conditions (SDs)
