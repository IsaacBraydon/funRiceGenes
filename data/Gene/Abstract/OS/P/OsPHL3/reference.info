NA	Identification of a G2-like transcription factor, OsPHL3, functions as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by co-expression and reverse genetic analysis.	2018	BMC Plant Biol	CAS Key Laboratory of Genome Sciences and Information, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, NO.1 Beichen West Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100101, China.	Flowering time is a key trait for regional adaption and seed production in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Forward and reverse genetic studies have characterized a number of flowering-time genes. However, co-expression analysis has not been used to identify the flowering-time genes.We predicted a G2-like family transcription factor, OsPHL3, by co-expression networks analysis with photoperiodic flowering pathway genes. OsPHL3 contains a MYB-CC domain, and was localized in the nucleus with transcriptional activation potential. OsPHL3 was mainly expressed in the leaves and exhibited a circadian rhythmic expression pattern. Rice lines overexpressing OsPHL3 showed a delayed flowering time in the genetic background of TP309 under both long-day (Beijing) and short-day (Hainan) conditions. By contrast, the knockout rice lines of OsPHL3 by CRISPR/Cas9 technology promoted flowering time regardless of genetic backgrounds (i.e. Nipponbare and TP309) or day length. Further analysis indicated that OsPHL3 delayed flowering time by down-regulating the expression of Hd3a and RFT1 through promoting Hd1 under long-day conditions (LDs), or suppressing Ehd1/Hd1 under short-day conditions (SDs).Our results suggested that co-expression analysis is a useful strategy for identifying novel flowering-time genes in rice.
