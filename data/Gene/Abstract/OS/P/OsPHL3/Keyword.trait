OsPHL3	nucleus	Identification of a G2-like transcription factor, OsPHL3, functions as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by co-expression and reverse genetic analysis.	 OsPHL3 contains a MYB-CC domain, and was localized in the nucleus with transcriptional activation potential
OsPHL3	flowering time	Identification of a G2-like transcription factor, OsPHL3, functions as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by co-expression and reverse genetic analysis.	 Rice lines overexpressing OsPHL3 showed a delayed flowering time in the genetic background of TP309 under both long-day (Beijing) and short-day (Hainan) conditions
OsPHL3	flowering time	Identification of a G2-like transcription factor, OsPHL3, functions as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by co-expression and reverse genetic analysis.	 By contrast, the knockout rice lines of OsPHL3 by CRISPR/Cas9 technology promoted flowering time regardless of genetic backgrounds (i
OsPHL3	flowering time	Identification of a G2-like transcription factor, OsPHL3, functions as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by co-expression and reverse genetic analysis.	 Further analysis indicated that OsPHL3 delayed flowering time by down-regulating the expression of Hd3a and RFT1 through promoting Hd1 under long-day conditions (LDs), or suppressing Ehd1/Hd1 under short-day conditions (SDs)
