NA	A substitution mutation in OsPELOTA confers bacterial blight resistance by activating the salicylic acid pathway.	2017	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology/Chinese National Center for Rice Improvement, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China.	We previously reported a spotted-leaf mutant pelota (originally termed HM47) in rice displaying arrested growth and enhanced resistance to multiple races of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Here, we report the map-based cloning of the causal gene OsPELOTA (originally termed splHM47 ). We identified a single base substitution from T to A at position 556 in the coding sequence of OsPELOTA, effectively mutating Phe to Ile at position 186 in the translated protein sequence. Both functional complementation and over-expression could rescue the spotted-leaf phenotype. OsPELOTA, a paralogue to eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1), shows high sequence similarity to Drosophila Pelota and also localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. OsPELOTA is constitutively expressed in roots, leaves, sheaths, stems, and panicles. Elevated levels of salicylic acid and decreased level of jasmonate were detected in the pelota mutant. RNA-seq analysis confirmed that genes responding to salicylic acid were upregulated in the mutant. Our results indicate that the rice PELOTA protein is involved in bacterial leaf blight resistance by activating the salicylic acid metabolic pathway.
NA	LML1, Encoding a Conserved Eukaryotic Release Factor 1 Protein, Regulates Cell Death and Pathogen Resistance by Forming a Conserved Complex with SPL33 in Rice.	2018	Plant Cell Physiol	Rice Research Institute of Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu Wenjiang, Sichuan, 611130, China.	Lesion mimic mutants are powerful tools for unveiling the molecular connections between cell death and pathogen resistance. Various proteins responsible for lesion mimics have been identified, however, the mechanism underlying lesion formation and pathogen resistance are still unknown. Here, we identify a lesion mimic mutant in rice, lesion mimic leaf 1 (lml1). The lml1 mutant exhibited abnormal cell death and resistance to both bacterial blight and rice blast. LML1 is expressed in all types of leaf cells, and encodes a novel eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Protein sequences of LML1 orthologs are conserved in yeast, animals and plants. LML1 can partially rescue the growth delay phenotype of the LML1 yeast ortholog mutant, dom34. Both lml1 and mutants of AtLML1 (the LML1 Arabidopsis ortholog) exhibited a growth delay phenotype as dom34. This indicates that LML1 and its orthologs are functionally conserved. LML1 forms a functional complex with a eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A)-like protein, SPL33/LMM5.1 whose mutant phenotype was similar to the lml1 phenotype. This complex was conserved between rice and yeast. Our work provides new insight in understanding the mechanism of cell death and pathogen resistance, also lays a good foundation for studying the fundamental molecular function of Pelota/DOM34 and its orthologs in plants.
NA	A Pelota-like gene regulates root development and defence responses in rice.	2018	Ann Bot	College of Science &amp; Technology, Ningbo University, Ningbo, PR China.	Pelota (Pelo) are evolutionarily conserved genes reported to be involved in ribosome rescue, cell cycle control and meiotic cell division. However, there is little known about their function in plants. The aim of this study was to elucidate the function of an ethylmethane sulphonate (EMS)-derived mutation of a Pelo-like gene in rice (named Ospelo).A dysfunctional mutant was used to characterize the function of OsPelo. Analyses of its expression and sub-cellular localization were performed. The whole-genome transcriptomic change in leaves of Ospelo was also investigated by RNA sequencing.The Ospelo mutant showed defects in root system development and spotted leaves at early seedling stages. Map-based cloning revealed that the mutation occurred in the putative Pelo gene. OsPelo was found to be expressed in various tissues throughout the plant, and the protein was located in mitochondria. Defence responses were induced in the Ospelo mutant, as shown by enhanced resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, coupled with upregulation of three pathogenesis-related marker genes. In addition, whole-genome transcriptome analysis showed that OsPelo was significantly associated with a number of biological processes, including translation, metabolism and biotic stress response. Detailed analysis showed that activation of a number of innate immunity-related genes might be responsible for the enhanced disease resistance in the Ospelo mutant.These results demonstrate that OsPelo positively regulates root development while its loss of function enhances pathogen resistance by pre-activation of defence responses in rice.
