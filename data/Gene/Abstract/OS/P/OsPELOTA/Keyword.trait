OsPELOTA|LML1|Ospelo	leaf	LML1, Encoding a Conserved Eukaryotic Release Factor 1 Protein, Regulates Cell Death and Pathogen Resistance by Forming a Conserved Complex with SPL33 in Rice.	 LML1 is expressed in all types of leaf cells, and encodes a novel eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
OsPELOTA|LML1|Ospelo	growth	LML1, Encoding a Conserved Eukaryotic Release Factor 1 Protein, Regulates Cell Death and Pathogen Resistance by Forming a Conserved Complex with SPL33 in Rice.	 LML1 can partially rescue the growth delay phenotype of the LML1 yeast ortholog mutant, dom34
OsPELOTA|LML1|Ospelo	growth	LML1, Encoding a Conserved Eukaryotic Release Factor 1 Protein, Regulates Cell Death and Pathogen Resistance by Forming a Conserved Complex with SPL33 in Rice.	 Both lml1 and mutants of AtLML1 (the LML1 Arabidopsis ortholog) exhibited a growth delay phenotype as dom34
OsPELOTA|LML1|Ospelo	resistance	LML1, Encoding a Conserved Eukaryotic Release Factor 1 Protein, Regulates Cell Death and Pathogen Resistance by Forming a Conserved Complex with SPL33 in Rice.	 The lml1 mutant exhibited abnormal cell death and resistance to both bacterial blight and rice blast
OsPELOTA|LML1|Ospelo	blast	LML1, Encoding a Conserved Eukaryotic Release Factor 1 Protein, Regulates Cell Death and Pathogen Resistance by Forming a Conserved Complex with SPL33 in Rice.	 The lml1 mutant exhibited abnormal cell death and resistance to both bacterial blight and rice blast
OsPELOTA|LML1|Ospelo	cell death	LML1, Encoding a Conserved Eukaryotic Release Factor 1 Protein, Regulates Cell Death and Pathogen Resistance by Forming a Conserved Complex with SPL33 in Rice.	 The lml1 mutant exhibited abnormal cell death and resistance to both bacterial blight and rice blast
OsPELOTA|LML1|Ospelo	blight	LML1, Encoding a Conserved Eukaryotic Release Factor 1 Protein, Regulates Cell Death and Pathogen Resistance by Forming a Conserved Complex with SPL33 in Rice.	 The lml1 mutant exhibited abnormal cell death and resistance to both bacterial blight and rice blast
OsPELOTA|LML1|Ospelo	bacterial blight	LML1, Encoding a Conserved Eukaryotic Release Factor 1 Protein, Regulates Cell Death and Pathogen Resistance by Forming a Conserved Complex with SPL33 in Rice.
