NA	The rice PALE1 homolog is involved in the biosynthesis of vitamin B1	2020	Plant Biotechnol J	Institute of Plant and Microbial Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.	The pale©\green to yellowish©\brown phenotype of the Ospale1 knockout mutant is reminiscent of the Arabidopsis thiamin©\deficient mutant pale1 (Hsieh et al., 2017). Still, there are at least two distinct aspects of OsPALE1. First, OsPALE1 is an essential gene in rice. The TDP levels in the Ospale1 leaves are approximately 40% of the WT (Figure 1d), and the mutant is lethal. Similarly, the TDP levels in the Arabidopsis pale1 mutant seedlings are also about 40% of the WT, but the mutant is not lethal (Mimura et al., 2016; Hsieh et al., 2017). These results suggest that rice may have a stricter demand for TDP to complete its life cycle. Second, Arabidopsis and rice may have distinct mechanisms to regulate the expression of vitamin B1 biosynthesis genes. The expression of vitamin B1 biosynthesis genes was up©\regulated in the Arabidopsis pale1 mutant (Hsieh et al., 2017). By contrast, a blockage in the conversion of TMP to thiamin results in down©\regulation of vitamin B1 biosynthesis genes in rice (Figure 1g). Further studies on vitamin B1 biosynthesis genes and their regulation in rice may have practical application in agriculture and nutrition in the future.
