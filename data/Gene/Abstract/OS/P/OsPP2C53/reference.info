NA	Two Clade A Phosphatase 2Cs Expressed in Guard Cells Physically Interact With Abscisic Acid Signaling Components to Induce Stomatal Closure in Rice.	2019	Rice (N Y)	Metabolic Engineering Division, Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, National Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Rural Development Administration, Jeonju, 54875, Republic of Korea.	The core ABA signaling components functioning in stomatal closure/opening, namely ABA receptors, phosphatases, SnRK2s and SLAC1, are well characterized in Arabidopsis, but their functions in guard cells of rice have not been extensively studied.In this study, we confirmed that OsSLAC1, the rice homolog of AtSLAC1, is specifically expressed in rice guard cells. Among the rice SAPKs, SAPK10 was specifically expressed in guard cells. In addition, SAPK10 phosphorylated OsSLAC1 in vitro and transgenic rice overexpressing SAPK10 or OsSLAC1 showed significantly less water loss than control. Thus, those might be major positive signaling components to close stomata in rice. We identified that only OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 among 9 OsPP2CAs might be related with stomatal closure/opening signaling based on guard cell specific expression and subcellular localization. Transgenic rice overexpressing OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 showed significantly higher water loss than control. We also characterized the interaction networks between OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53, SAPK10 and OsSLAC1 and found two interaction pathways among those signaling components: a hierarchical interaction pathway that consisted of OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53, SAPK10 and OsSLAC1; and a branched interaction pathway wherein OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 interacted directly with OsSLAC1.OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 is major negative regulators of ABA signaling regarding stomata closing in rice. Those can regulate the OsSLAC1 directly or indirectly thorough SAPK10.
NA	Abscisic acid regulates subcellular redistribution of OsABI-LIKE2, a negative regulator in ABA signaling, to control root architecture and drought resistance in Oryza Sativa.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	1, National Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China.	The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is a key stress signal in plants. Although the identification of ABA receptors led to significant progresses in understanding Arabidopsis ABA signaling pathway, there are still many mysteries for ABA signaling in monocots, such as in rice. Here, we report that a rice ortholog of AtABI1 and AtABI2, named as OsABI-LIKE2 (OsABIL2), plays a negative role in rice ABA signaling. Overexpression of OsABIL2 not only led to the ABA insensitivity, but also significantly altered plant developmental phenotypes, including stomata density and root architecture, which likely caused the hypersensitivity to drought stress. OsABIL2 interacts with OsPYL1, SAPK8 and SAPK10 both in vitro and in vivo, and the phosphatase activity of OsABIL2 was repressed by ABA-bound OsPYL1. However, unlike many other solely nucleus-localized clade A PP2Cs, the OsABIL2 is localized in both nucleus and cytosol. Furthermore, OsABIL2 interacts with and co-localized with OsPYL1 mainly in the cytosol, and ABA treatment regulates the nucleus-cytosol distribution of OsABIL2, suggesting a different mechanism for the activation of ABA signaling. Taken together, this study provides significant insights into rice ABA signaling and indicates the important role of OsABIL2 in regulating root development.
NA	Abscisic Acid Regulates Auxin Homeostasis in Rice Root Tips to Promote Root Hair Elongation.	2017	Front Plant Sci	National Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan UniversityShanghai, China.	Abscisic acid (ABA) plays an essential role in root hair elongation in plants, but the regulatory mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, we found that exogenous ABA can promote rice root hair elongation. Transgenic rice overexpressing SAPK10 (Stress/ABA-activated protein kinase 10) had longer root hairs; rice plants overexpressing OsABIL2 (OsABI-Like 2) had attenuated ABA signaling and shorter root hairs, suggesting that the effect of ABA on root hair elongation depends on the conserved PYR/PP2C/SnRK2 ABA signaling module. Treatment of the DR5-GUS and OsPIN-GUS lines with ABA and an auxin efflux inhibitor showed that ABA-induced root hair elongation depends on polar auxin transport. To examine the transcriptional response to ABA, we divided rice root tips into three regions: short root hair, long root hair and root tip zones; and conducted RNA-seq analysis with or without ABA treatment. Examination of genes involved in auxin transport, biosynthesis and metabolism indicated that ABA promotes auxin biosynthesis and polar auxin transport in the root tip, which may lead to auxin accumulation in the long root hair zone. Our findings shed light on how ABA regulates root hair elongation through crosstalk with auxin biosynthesis and transport to orchestrate plant development.
NA	Ectopic expression of mutated type 2C protein phosphatase OsABI-LIKE2 decreases abscisic acid sensitivity in Arabidopsis and rice.	2018	Sci Rep	Hokkaido Agricultural Research Center, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Toyohira, Sapporo, 062-8555, Japan.	Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone that is necessary for stress adaptation. Recent studies have reported that attenuated levels of ABA improved grain yield and seedling growth under low temperature in cereals. To improve plant growth under low temperature, we attempted to generate ABA-insensitive transgenic rice by expressing a clade A type 2C protein phosphatase (OsPP2C), OsABIL2, with or without the mutation equivalent to the Arabidopsis abi1-1 mutation. A yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that the interaction between OsABIL2 and a putative rice ABA receptor, OsPYL1, was ABA-dependent, and the interaction was lost with amino acid substitution from glycine to aspartic acid at the 183rd amino acid of the OsABIL2 protein, corresponding to abi1-1 mutation. The constitutive expression of OsABIL2 or OsABIL2G183D in Arabidopsis or rice decreased ABA sensitivity to differing degrees. Moreover, the transgenic rice expressing OsABIL2G183D exhibited improved seedling growth under low temperature, although the transgenic lines showed unfavorable traits, such as viviparous germination and elongated internodes. These results indicated that the introduction of abi1-1 type dominant mutation was also effective in OsABIL2 at decreasing ABA sensitivity in plants, and the attenuation of ABA sensitivity could be an alternative parameter to improve rice performance under low temperatures.
