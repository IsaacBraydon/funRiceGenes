OsPP2C53|OsABIL2	 We identified that only OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 among 9 OsPP2CAs might be related with stomatal closure/opening signaling based on guard cell specific expression and subcellular localization
OsPP2C53|OsABIL2	 Overexpression of OsABIL2 not only led to the ABA insensitivity, but also significantly altered plant developmental phenotypes, including stomata density and root architecture, which likely caused the hypersensitivity to drought stress	 Overexpression of OsABIL2 not only led to the ABA insensitivity, but also significantly altered plant developmental phenotypes, including stomata density and root architecture, which likely caused the hypersensitivity to drought stress
