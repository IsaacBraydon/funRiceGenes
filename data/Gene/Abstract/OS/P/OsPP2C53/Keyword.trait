OsPP2C53	 ABA 	Two Clade A Phosphatase 2Cs Expressed in Guard Cells Physically Interact With Abscisic Acid Signaling Components to Induce Stomatal Closure in Rice.	OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 is major negative regulators of ABA signaling regarding stomata closing in rice
OsPP2C53	stomatal	Two Clade A Phosphatase 2Cs Expressed in Guard Cells Physically Interact With Abscisic Acid Signaling Components to Induce Stomatal Closure in Rice.	 We identified that only OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 among 9 OsPP2CAs might be related with stomatal closure/opening signaling based on guard cell specific expression and subcellular localization
OsPP2C53	ABA	Two Clade A Phosphatase 2Cs Expressed in Guard Cells Physically Interact With Abscisic Acid Signaling Components to Induce Stomatal Closure in Rice.	OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 is major negative regulators of ABA signaling regarding stomata closing in rice
OsPP2C53	stomata	Two Clade A Phosphatase 2Cs Expressed in Guard Cells Physically Interact With Abscisic Acid Signaling Components to Induce Stomatal Closure in Rice.	OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 is major negative regulators of ABA signaling regarding stomata closing in rice
OsPP2C53	water loss	Two Clade A Phosphatase 2Cs Expressed in Guard Cells Physically Interact With Abscisic Acid Signaling Components to Induce Stomatal Closure in Rice.	 Transgenic rice overexpressing OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 showed significantly higher water loss than control
