NA	Overexpression of OsPUB41, a Rice E3 ubiquitin ligase induced by cell wall degrading enzymes, enhances immune responses in Rice and Arabidopsis.	2019	BMC Plant Biol	CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Uppal Road, Hyderabad, 500007, India.	Cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) induce plant immune responses and E3 ubiquitin ligases are known to play important roles in regulating plant defenses. Expression of the rice E3 ubiquitin ligase, OsPUB41, is enhanced upon treatment of leaves with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) secreted CWDEs such as Cellulase and Lipase/Esterase. However, it is not reported to have a role in elicitation of immune responses.Expression of the rice E3 ubiquitin ligase, OsPUB41, is induced when rice leaves are treated with either CWDEs, pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or pathogens. Overexpression of OsPUB41 leads to induction of callose deposition, enhanced tolerance to Xoo and Rhizoctonia solani infection in rice and Arabidopsis respectively. In rice, transient overexpression of OsPUB41 leads to enhanced expression of PR genes and SA as well as JA biosynthetic and response genes. However, in Arabidopsis, ectopic expression of OsPUB41 results in upregulation of only JA biosynthetic and response genes. Transient overexpression of either of the two biochemically inactive mutants (OsPUB41C40A and OsPUB41V51R) of OsPUB41 in rice and stable transgenics in Arabidopsis ectopically expressing OsPUB41C40A failed to elicit immune responses. This indicates that the E3 ligase activity of OsPUB41 protein is essential for induction of plant defense responses.The results presented here suggest that OsPUB41 is possibly involved in elicitation of CWDE triggered immune responses in rice.
