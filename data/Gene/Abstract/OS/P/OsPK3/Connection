OsPK1	OsPK3	Mitochondria-associated pyruvate kinase complexes regulate grain filling in rice.	 Subcellular localization analysis of OsPK3 revealed its association with mitochondria, and OsPK3 physically interacted and formed heterodimers in vivo with two other PK isozymes, OsPK1 and OsPK4
OsPK1	OsPK3	Mitochondria-associated pyruvate kinase complexes regulate grain filling in rice.	 Both OsPK1 and OsPK4 localized to the mitochondria and cytosol and were recruited to the mitochondria by OsPK3
OsPK1	OsPK3	Mitochondria-associated pyruvate kinase complexes regulate grain filling in rice.	 As observed for ospk3, disruption of OsPK1 caused pleiotropic defects, while OsPK4 loss of function led to severely chalky grains without other obvious defects
