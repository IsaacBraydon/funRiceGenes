OsPti1a, a functional ortholog of tomato SlPti1, negatively regulates both basal resistance and R-gene-mediated resistance in rice. To investigate the molecular function of OsPti1a in defense responses, we searched for components interacting with OsPti1a using a yeast two-hybrid system. One of the interacting proteins is a Ser/Thr kinase that directly phosphorylates OsPti1a in vitro. This protein belongs to the AGC kinase family and is highly similar to AtOxi1, which is induced in response to a wide range of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating stimuli in Arabidopsis. Thus, it was designated OsOxi1. OsOxi1 was transiently phosphorylated in response to ROS and chitin elicitor. Both OsOxi1-overexpressing transgenic lines and the ospti1a mutant were highly sensitive to ROS treatment, indicating that OsOxi1 and OsPti1a are involved in ROS-mediated signaling in opposing ways. OsOxi1 is specifically expressed at infection sites where ROS are produced after inoculation with a blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. Overexpression of OsOxi1 enhanced basal resistance to the blast fungus, indicating that OsOxi1 positively regulates disease resistance. OsOxi1 phosphorylates Thr-233 of OsPti1a and a point mutation of Thr-233 enhanced disease susceptibility to a bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), suggesting that the phosphorylation of OsPti1a by OsOxi1 is essential for basal resistance to Xoo. Taken together, our data suggest that OsOxi1 positively regulates defense responses through the phosphorylation of OsPti1a, causing the release from an OsPti1a-dependent inhibition of the responses.
Plant Cell Physiol-2010-Matsui-2082-91.pdf	Pdk1 Kinase Regulates Basal Disease Resistance Through the OsOxi1-OsPti1a Phosphorylation Cascade in Rice	2010	Plant and Cell Physiology	Division of Plant Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602 Japan.	The AGC kinase OsOxi1, which has been isolated as an interactor with OsPti1a, positively regulates basal disease resistance in rice. In eukaryotes, AGC kinase family proteins are regulated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (Pdk1). In Arabidopsis, AtPdk1 directly interacts with phosphatidic acid, which functions as a second messenger in both biotic and abiotic stress responses. However, the functions of Pdk1 are poorly understood in plants. We show here that OsPdk1 acts upstream of the OsOxi1-OsPti1a signal cascade in disease resistance in rice. OsPdk1 interacts with OsOxi1 and phosphorylates the Ser283 residue of OsOxi1 in vitro. To investigate whether OsPdk1 is involved in immunity that is triggered by microbial-associated molecular patterns, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of OsPdk1 in response to chitin elicitor. Like OsOxi1, OsPdk1 is rapidly phosphorylated in response to chitin elicitor, suggesting that OsPdk1 participates in signal transduction through pathogen recognition. The overexpression of OsPdk1 enhanced basal resistance against a blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, and a bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Taken together, these results suggest that OsPdk1 positively regulates basal disease resistance through the OsOxi1-OsPti1a phosphorylation cascade in rice.
Takahashi-2007-Rice Pti1a negativel.pdf	Rice Pti1a negatively regulates RAR1-dependent defense responses	2007	Plant Cell	Department of Molecular Genetics, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Pto encodes a protein kinase that confers resistance to bacterial speck disease. A second protein kinase, Pti1, physically interacts with Pto and is involved in Pto-mediated defense signaling. Pti1-related sequences are highly conserved among diverse plant species, including rice (Oryza sativa), but their functions are largely unknown. Here, we report the identification of a null mutant for the Pti1 homolog in rice and the functional characterization of Os Pti1a. The rice pti1a mutant was characterized by spontaneous necrotic lesions on leaves, which was accompanied by a series of defense responses and resistance against a compatible race of Magnaporthe grisea. Overexpression of Pti1a in rice reduced resistance against an incompatible race of the fungus recognized by a resistance (R) protein, Pish. Plants overexpressing Pti1a were also more susceptible to a compatible race of the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. These results suggest that Os Pti1a negatively regulates defense signaling for both R gene-mediated and basal resistance. We also demonstrated that repression of the rice RAR1 gene suppressed defense responses induced in the pti1a mutant, indicating that Pti1a negatively regulates RAR1-dependent defense responses. Expression of a tomato Pti1 cDNA in the rice pti1a mutant suppressed the mutant phenotypes. This contrasts strikingly with the previous finding that Sl Pti1 enhances Pto-mediated hypersensitive response (HR) induction when expressed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), suggesting that the molecular switch controlling HR downstream of pathogen recognition has evolved differently in rice and tomato.
