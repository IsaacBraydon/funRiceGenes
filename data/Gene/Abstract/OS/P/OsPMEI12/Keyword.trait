OsPMEI12	growth	CRISPR/Cas9 Mutant Rice Ospmei12 Involved in Growth, Cell Wall Development, and Response to Phytohormone and Heavy Metal Stress.	 Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to edit the OsPMEI12 (LOC_Os03G01020) and two mutant pmei12 lines were obtained to explore the functions of OsPMEI in plant growth and development, and under cadmium (Cd) stress
OsPMEI12	stress	CRISPR/Cas9 Mutant Rice Ospmei12 Involved in Growth, Cell Wall Development, and Response to Phytohormone and Heavy Metal Stress.	 Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to edit the OsPMEI12 (LOC_Os03G01020) and two mutant pmei12 lines were obtained to explore the functions of OsPMEI in plant growth and development, and under cadmium (Cd) stress
OsPMEI12	stress	CRISPR/Cas9 Mutant Rice Ospmei12 Involved in Growth, Cell Wall Development, and Response to Phytohormone and Heavy Metal Stress.	 These results indicated that OsPMEI12 was involved in the regulation of methyl esterification during growth, affected cell wall composition and agronomic traits, and might play an important role in responses to phytohormones and stress
OsPMEI12	plant growth	CRISPR/Cas9 Mutant Rice Ospmei12 Involved in Growth, Cell Wall Development, and Response to Phytohormone and Heavy Metal Stress.	 Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to edit the OsPMEI12 (LOC_Os03G01020) and two mutant pmei12 lines were obtained to explore the functions of OsPMEI in plant growth and development, and under cadmium (Cd) stress
