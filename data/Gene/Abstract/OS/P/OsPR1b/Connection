OsPR1b	OsWRKY71	OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response	Furthermore, two marker genes in defense signaling pathway, OsNPR1 and OsPR1b, were constitutively expressed in OsWRKY71-overexpressing transgenic plants
OsPR1b	OsWRKY71	OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response	These results suggest that OsWRKY71 might function as a transcriptional regulator upstream of OsNPR1 and OsPR1b in rice defense signaling pathways
OsNPR1|NH1	OsPR1b	OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response	Furthermore, two marker genes in defense signaling pathway, OsNPR1 and OsPR1b, were constitutively expressed in OsWRKY71-overexpressing transgenic plants
OsNPR1|NH1	OsPR1b	OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response	These results suggest that OsWRKY71 might function as a transcriptional regulator upstream of OsNPR1 and OsPR1b in rice defense signaling pathways
OsNPR1|NH1	OsPR1b	Functional analysis and expressional characterization of rice ankyrin repeat-containing protein, OsPIANK1, in basal defense against Magnaporthe oryzae attack	oryzae was accompanied by enhanced transcriptional expression of SA- and JA-dependent genes such as NH1, WKRY13, PAL, AOS2, PR1b, and PR5
OsPR10a|PBZ1	OsPR1b	Cytokinins act synergistically with salicylic acid to activate defense gene expression in rice	Co-treatment of leaf blades with CK and salicylic acid (SA), but not with either one alone, markedly induced pathogenesis-related genes OsPR1b and probenazole-induced protein 1 (PBZ1)
OsPR1b	OsWRKY4	Rice WRKY4 acts as a transcriptional activator mediating defense responses toward Rhizoctonia solani, the causing agent of rice sheath blight	Yeast one-hybrid assay and transient expression in tobacco cells reveal that OsWRKY4 specifically binds to the promoter regions of PR1b and PR5 which contain W-box (TTGAC[C/T]), or W-box like (TGAC[C/T]) cis-elements.
OsPBL1	OsPR1b	The rice serine/threonine protein kinase OsPBL1 (ORYZA SATIVA ARABIDOPSIS PBS1 -LIKE 1) is potentially involved in resistance to rice stripe disease	Furthermore, OsPBL1, OsPR1b, and OsPR2 transcripts were up-regulated to higher levels by SBPH treatment, which was specifically observed in RSV-resistant varieties
OsDTC2|OsKSL11	PR1b	Identification of a small set of genes commonly regulated in rice roots in response to beneficial rhizobacteria	 A common expression pattern was highlighted for four genes that are proposed to be markers of the rice-PGPR interaction: two genes involved in diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis (OsDXS3 and OsDTC2) and one coding for an uncharacterized protein (Os02g0582900) were significantly induced by PGPR whereas one defense-related gene encoding a pathogenesis-related protein (PR1b, Os01g0382000) was significantly repressed
OsDXS|OsDXS3	PR1b	Identification of a small set of genes commonly regulated in rice roots in response to beneficial rhizobacteria	 A common expression pattern was highlighted for four genes that are proposed to be markers of the rice-PGPR interaction: two genes involved in diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis (OsDXS3 and OsDTC2) and one coding for an uncharacterized protein (Os02g0582900) were significantly induced by PGPR whereas one defense-related gene encoding a pathogenesis-related protein (PR1b, Os01g0382000) was significantly repressed
OsDXS|OsDXS3	PR1b	Identification of a small set of genes commonly regulated in rice roots in response to beneficial rhizobacteria	 Interestingly, exposure to a rice bacterial pathogen also triggered the expression of OsDXS3 while the expression of Os02g0582900 and PR1b was down-regulated, suggesting that these genes might play a key role in rice-bacteria interactions
OsPR1b|PR1b	OsWRKY6	The OsWRKY6 transcriptional cascade functions in basal defense and Xa1-mediated defense of rice against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	The rice protein OsWRKY6 directly activates OsWRKY45 and OsWRKY47 expression, and also activates OsPR1a and OsPR1b through the two OsWRKYs, and this transcriptional module participates in Xa1-mediated defense against the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv
OsPR1b|PR1b	OsWRKY6	The OsWRKY6 transcriptional cascade functions in basal defense and Xa1-mediated defense of rice against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	 Furthermore, OsWRKY6 activated OsPR1a and OsPR1b via the OsWRKY45 and OsWRKY47
OsLTPL23	OsPR1b|PR1b	Rice lipid transfer protein, OsLTPL23, controls seed germination by regulating starch-sugar conversion and ABA homeostasis.	 Further investigations found that osltpl23 mutants displays weakened early seedling growth, with elevated gene expresssion of ABA catabolism genes and repressive transcription response of defence-related genes OsWRKY45, OsEiN3, OsPR1a, OsPR1b and OsNPR1
