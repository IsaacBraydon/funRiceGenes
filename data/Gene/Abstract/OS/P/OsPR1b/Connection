OsPR1b	OsWRKY71	OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response	Furthermore, two marker genes in defense signaling pathway, OsNPR1 and OsPR1b, were constitutively expressed in OsWRKY71-overexpressing transgenic plants
OsPR1b	OsWRKY71	OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response	These results suggest that OsWRKY71 might function as a transcriptional regulator upstream of OsNPR1 and OsPR1b in rice defense signaling pathways
OsNPR1|NH1	OsPR1b	OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response	Furthermore, two marker genes in defense signaling pathway, OsNPR1 and OsPR1b, were constitutively expressed in OsWRKY71-overexpressing transgenic plants
OsNPR1|NH1	OsPR1b	OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response	These results suggest that OsWRKY71 might function as a transcriptional regulator upstream of OsNPR1 and OsPR1b in rice defense signaling pathways
OsNPR1|NH1	OsPR1b	Functional analysis and expressional characterization of rice ankyrin repeat-containing protein, OsPIANK1, in basal defense against Magnaporthe oryzae attack	oryzae was accompanied by enhanced transcriptional expression of SA- and JA-dependent genes such as NH1, WKRY13, PAL, AOS2, PR1b, and PR5
OsPR10a|PBZ1	OsPR1b	Cytokinins act synergistically with salicylic acid to activate defense gene expression in rice	Co-treatment of leaf blades with CK and salicylic acid (SA), but not with either one alone, markedly induced pathogenesis-related genes OsPR1b and probenazole-induced protein 1 (PBZ1)
OsPR1b	OsWRKY4	Rice WRKY4 acts as a transcriptional activator mediating defense responses toward Rhizoctonia solani, the causing agent of rice sheath blight	Yeast one-hybrid assay and transient expression in tobacco cells reveal that OsWRKY4 specifically binds to the promoter regions of PR1b and PR5 which contain W-box (TTGAC[C/T]), or W-box like (TGAC[C/T]) cis-elements.
OsPBL1	OsPR1b	The rice serine/threonine protein kinase OsPBL1 (ORYZA SATIVA ARABIDOPSIS PBS1 -LIKE 1) is potentially involved in resistance to rice stripe disease	Furthermore, OsPBL1, OsPR1b, and OsPR2 transcripts were up-regulated to higher levels by SBPH treatment, which was specifically observed in RSV-resistant varieties
OsDTC2|OsKSL11	PR1b	Identification of a small set of genes commonly regulated in rice roots in response to beneficial rhizobacteria	 A common expression pattern was highlighted for four genes that are proposed to be markers of the rice-PGPR interaction: two genes involved in diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis (OsDXS3 and OsDTC2) and one coding for an uncharacterized protein (Os02g0582900) were significantly induced by PGPR whereas one defense-related gene encoding a pathogenesis-related protein (PR1b, Os01g0382000) was significantly repressed
OsDXS|OsDXS3	PR1b	Identification of a small set of genes commonly regulated in rice roots in response to beneficial rhizobacteria	 A common expression pattern was highlighted for four genes that are proposed to be markers of the rice-PGPR interaction: two genes involved in diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis (OsDXS3 and OsDTC2) and one coding for an uncharacterized protein (Os02g0582900) were significantly induced by PGPR whereas one defense-related gene encoding a pathogenesis-related protein (PR1b, Os01g0382000) was significantly repressed
OsDXS|OsDXS3	PR1b	Identification of a small set of genes commonly regulated in rice roots in response to beneficial rhizobacteria	 Interestingly, exposure to a rice bacterial pathogen also triggered the expression of OsDXS3 while the expression of Os02g0582900 and PR1b was down-regulated, suggesting that these genes might play a key role in rice-bacteria interactions
