Symbol	Expression
Ospdr9|OsABCG36	 OsABCG36 was expressed in both roots and shoots at a low level, but the expression in the roots rather than the shoots was greatly up-regulated by a short exposure to Cd |  Furthermore, a spatial expression analysis showed that Cd-induced expression of OsABCG36 was found in both the root tip and mature root region |  Transient expression of OsABCG36 in rice protoplast cells showed that it was localized to the plasma membrane |  Heterologous expression of OsABCG36 in yeast showed an efflux activity for Cd, but not for Zn
