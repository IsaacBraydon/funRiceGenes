Ospdr9|OsABCG36	ZN	The ABC transporter OsABCG36 is required for Cd tolerance in rice.	 Knockout of OsABCG36 resulted in increased Cd accumulation in root cell sap, and enhanced Cd sensitivity, but did not affect the tolerance to other metals including Al, Zn, Cu, and Pb
Ospdr9|OsABCG36	ZN	The ABC transporter OsABCG36 is required for Cd tolerance in rice.	 Heterologous expression of OsABCG36 in yeast showed an efflux activity for Cd, but not for Zn
