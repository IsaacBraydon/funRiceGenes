Little is known about the role of pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR)-type ATP-binding (ABC) proteins in plant responses to environmental stresses. We characterised ospdr9, which encodes a rice ABC protein with a reverse (ABC-TMS(6))(2) configuration. Polyethylene glycol and the heavy metals Cd (20 microM) and Zn (30 microM) rapidly and markedly induced ospdr9 in roots of rice seedlings. Hypoxic stress also induced ospdr9 in rice roots, salt stress induced ospdr9 at low levels but cold and heat shock had no effect. The plant growth regulator jasmonic acid, the auxin alpha-naphthalene acetic acid and the cytokinin 6-benzylaminopurine triggered ospdr9 expression. The antioxidants dithiothreitol and ascorbic acid rapidly and markedly induced ospdr9 in rice roots; the strong oxidant hydrogen peroxide also induced ospdr9 but at three times lower levels. The results suggested that redox changes may be involved in the abiotic stress response regulation of ospdr9 in rice roots.
NA	The ABC transporter OsABCG36 is required for Cd tolerance in rice.	2019	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, China.	Cadmium (Cd) is a highly toxic heavy metal in nature, which causes severe damage to plant growth. However, the molecular mechanisms for Cd detoxification are poorly understood. Here, we report that a G-type ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporter, OsABCG36, is involved in Cd tolerance in rice. OsABCG36 was expressed in both roots and shoots at a low level, but the expression in the roots rather than the shoots was greatly up-regulated by a short exposure to Cd. Furthermore, a spatial expression analysis showed that Cd-induced expression of OsABCG36 was found in both the root tip and mature root region. Transient expression of OsABCG36 in rice protoplast cells showed that it was localized to the plasma membrane. Immunostaining showed that OsABCG36 was localized in all root cells except the epidermal cells. Knockout of OsABCG36 resulted in increased Cd accumulation in root cell sap, and enhanced Cd sensitivity, but did not affect the tolerance to other metals including Al, Zn, Cu, and Pb. The concentration of Cd in the shoots was similar between the knockout lines and the wild-type rice. Heterologous expression of OsABCG36 in yeast showed an efflux activity for Cd, but not for Zn. Taken together, our results indicated that OsABCG36 is not involved in Cd accumulation in the shoots, but is required for Cd tolerance by exporting Cd or Cd conjugates from the root cells in rice.
