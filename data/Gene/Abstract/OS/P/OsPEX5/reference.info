j.1365-313X.2006.02797.x.pdf	Cloning of two splice variants of the rice PTS1 receptor, OsPex5pL and OsPex5pS, and their functional characterization using pex5-deficient yeast and Arabidopsis	2006	Plant J	Environmental Biotechnology National Core Research Center, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 660-701, Korea.	Using the rice PEX14 cDNA as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid assay, two splice variants of the type I peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1) receptor, OsPex5pL and OsPex5pS, were cloned from a pathogen-treated rice leaf cDNA library. The proteins were produced from a single gene by alternative splicing, which generated a full-length variant, OsPEX5L, and a variant that lacked exon 7, OsPEX5S. OsPex5pL contained 11 copies of the pentapeptide motif WXXXF/Y in its N-terminus, and seven tetratricopeptide repeats in its C-terminus. Expression of OsPEX5L and OsPEX5S predominantly occurred in leaf tissues, and was induced by various stresses, such as exposure to the pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, and treatment with fungal elicitor, methyl viologen, NaCl or hydrogen peroxide. The Arabidopsis T-DNA insertional pex5 mutant, Atpex5, which does not germinate in the absence of sucrose and was resistant to indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), was perfectly rescued by over-expression of OsPex5pL, but not by OsPex5pS. Using transient expression of OsPex5pL and OsPex5pS in the Atpex5 mutant, we show that OsPex5pL translocates both PTS1- and PTS2-containing proteins into the peroxisome by interacting with OsPex7p, whereas OsPex5pS is involved only in PTS1-dependent import in Arabidopsis.
NA	OsPEX5 regulates rice spikelet development through modulating jasmonic acid biosynthesis.	2019	New Phytol	National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement,, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center,, Nanjing Agricultural University,, Nanjing, 210095, China.	• Spikelet is the primary reproductive structure and a critical determinant of grain yield in rice. The molecular mechanisms regulating rice spikelet development still remain largely unclear. • Here, we report that mutations in OsPEX5, which encodes a peroxisomal targeting sequence 1 (PTS1) receptor protein, cause abnormal spikelet morphology. • We show that OsPEX5 can physically interact with OsOPR7, an enzyme involved in jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and is required for its import into peroxisome. Similar to Ospex5 mutant, knockout mutant of OsOPR7 generated via the CRISPR-Cas9 technology has reduced levels of endogenous JA and also displays an abnormal spikelet phenotype. Application of exogenous JA can partially rescue the abnormal spikelet phenotype of Ospex5 and Osopr7. Further, we show that OsMYC2 directly bind to the promoters of OsMADS1, OsMADS7 and OsMADS14 to activate their expression, and subsequently regulate spikelet development. • Our results suggest that OsPEX5 plays a critical role in regulating spikelet development through mediating peroxisomal import of OsOPR7, thus providing new insights into regulation of JA biosynthesis in plants and expanding our understanding of the biological role of JA in regulating rice reproduction.
