The 20S proteasome is constituted of 28 subunits arranged in four rings of seven subunits, and exists as a hollow cylinder. The two outer rings and the two inner rings are composed of seven different α and β type subunits, respectively, giving an α7β7β7α7 structure. We previously reported the primary structures of the 14 proteasomal subunit subfamilies in rice (Oryza sativa), representing the first set for all the subfamilies from monocot. In this study, a distinct cDNA sequence encoding the α1 subunit, OsPAA2, was identified. The amino acid sequence similarity between the two rice α1 subunits was as low as 59.6%, contrasting with those between paralogs of Arabidopsis proteasome subunit genes. The expression pattern of the OsPAA2 gene was different from that of another α1 gene, OsPAA1. These data suggest that OsPAA2 might play a distinct role from that of OsPAA1 in the 20S proteasome complex.
