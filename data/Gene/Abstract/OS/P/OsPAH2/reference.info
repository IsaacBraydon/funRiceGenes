NA	Genome editing of a rice CDP-DAG synthase confers multipathogen resistance.	2023	Nature	National Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	The discovery and application of genome editing introduced a new era of plant breeding by giving researchers efficient tools for the precise engineering of crop genomes(1). Here we demonstrate the power of genome editing for engineering broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice (Oryza sativa). We first isolated a lesion mimic mutant (LMM) from a mutagenized rice population. We then demonstrated that a 29-base-pair deletion in a gene we named RESISTANCE TO BLAST1 (RBL1) caused broad-spectrum disease resistance and showed that this mutation caused an approximately 20-fold reduction in yield. RBL1 encodes a cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol synthase that is required for phospholipid biosynthesis(2). Mutation of RBL1 results in reduced levels of phosphatidylinositol and its derivative phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)). In rice, PtdIns(4,5)P(2) is enriched in cellular structures that are specifically associated with effector secretion and fungal infection, suggesting that it has a role as a disease-susceptibility factor(3). By using targeted genome editing, we obtained an allele of RBL1, named RBL1(Î”12), which confers broad-spectrum disease resistance but does not decrease yield in a model rice variety, as assessed in small-scale field trials. Our study has demonstrated the benefits of editing an LMM gene, a strategy relevant to diverse LMM genes and crops.
