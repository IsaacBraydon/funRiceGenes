OsPUT1	OsPUT3	Altered expression of polyamine transporters reveals a role for spermidine in the timing of flowering and other developmental response pathways.	 thaliana and rice transporters AtPUT5 and OsPUT1 were localized to the ER, while the AtPUT2, AtPUT3, and OsPUT3 were localized to the chloroplast by transient expression in N
OsPUT1	OsPUT3	Altered expression of polyamine transporters reveals a role for spermidine in the timing of flowering and other developmental response pathways.	 A similar delay in flowering was also noted in transgenic lines with constitutive expression of either OsPUT1 or OsPUT3
