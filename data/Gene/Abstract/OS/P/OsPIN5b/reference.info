NA	OsPIN5b modulates rice plant architecture and yield by changing auxin homeostasis, transport and distribution.	2015	Plant J	Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, N1G 2W1, Canada.	Plant architecture attributes such as tillering, plant height and panicle size are important agronomic traits that determine rice productivity. Here, we report that altered auxin content, transport and distribution affects these traits and hence rice yield. Over-expression of the auxin efflux carrier-like gene OsPIN5b causes pleiotropic effects, mainly reducing plant height, leaf and tiller number, shoot and root biomass, seed setting rate, panicle length and yield parameters. Conversely, reduced expression of OsPIN5b results in higher tiller number, more vigorous root system, longer panicles and increased yield. We show that OsPIN5b is an ER-localized protein that participates in auxin homeostasis, transport and distribution in vivo. This work describes an example of an auxin-related gene where modulating its expression can simultaneously improve plant architecture and yield potential in rice and reveals an important effect of hormonal signaling on these traits.
