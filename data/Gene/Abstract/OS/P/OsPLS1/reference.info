NA	A single cytosine deletion in the OsPLS1 gene encoding vacuolar-type H+-ATPase subunit A1 leads to premature leaf senescence and seed dormancy in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	Department of Agronomy, Zijingang Campus, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, PR China.	Leaf senescence is a programmed developmental process orchestrated by many factors, but its molecular regulation is not yet fully understood. In this study, a novel Oryza sativa premature leaf senescence mutant (ospls1) was examined. Despite normal development in early seedlings, the ospls1 mutant leaves displayed lesion-mimics and early senescence, and a high transpiration rate after tillering. The mutant also showed seed dormancy attributable to physical (defect of micropyle structure) and physiological (abscisic acid sensitivity) factors. Using a map-based cloning approach, we determined that a cytosine deletion in the OsPLS1 gene encoding vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunit A1 (VHA-A1) underlies the phenotypic abnormalities in the ospls1 mutant. The OsPSL1/VHA-A1 transcript levels progressively declined with the age-dependent leaf senescence in both the ospls1 mutant and its wild type. The significant decrease in both OsPSL1/VHA-A1 gene expression and VHA enzyme activity in the ospls1 mutant strongly suggests a negative regulatory role for the normal OsPLS1/VHA-A1 gene in the onset of rice leaf senescence. The ospls1 mutant featured higher salicylic acid (SA) levels and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and activation of signal transduction by up-regulation of WRKY genes in leaves. Consistent with this, the ospls1 mutant exhibited hypersensitivity to exogenous SA and/or H2O2. Collectively, these results indicated that the OsPSL1/VAH-A1 mutation played a causal role in premature leaf senescence through a combination of ROS and SA signals. To conclude, OsPLS1 is implicated in leaf senescence and seed dormancy in rice.
NA	Physiological and Transcriptome Analyses of Early Leaf Senescence for ospls1 Mutant Rice (Oryza sativa L.) during the Grain-Filling Stage.	2019	Int J Mol Sci	College of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China. zhaoweili@fafu.edu.cn.	Early leaf senescence is an important agronomic trait that affects crop yield and quality. To understand the molecular mechanism of early leaf senescence, Oryza sativa premature leaf senescence 1 (ospls1) mutant rice with a deletion of OsVHA-A and its wild type were employed in this study. The genotype-dependent differences in photosynthetic indexes, senescence-related physiological parameters, and yield characters were investigated during the grain-filling stage. Moreover, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to determine the genotype differences in transcriptome during the grain-filling stage. Results showed that the ospls1 mutant underwent significant decreases in the maximal quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry (Fv/Fm), net photosynthesis rate (Pn), and soluble sugar and protein, followed by the decreases in OsVHA-A transcript and vacuolar H<U+207A>-ATPase activity. Finally, yield traits were severely suppressed in the ospls1 mutant. RNA-seq results showed that 4827 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in ospls1 mutant between 0 day and 14 days, and the pathways of biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, and photosynthesis were downregulated in the senescing leaves of ospls1 mutant during the grain-filling stage. In addition, 81 differentially expressed TFs were identified to be involved in leaf senescence. Eleven DEGs related to hormone signaling pathways were significantly enriched in auxin, cytokinins, brassinosteroids, and abscisic acid pathways, indicating that hormone signaling pathways participated in leaf senescence. Some antioxidative and carbohydrate metabolism-related genes were detected to be differentially expressed in the senescing leaves of ospls1 mutant, suggesting that these genes probably play response and regulatory roles in leaf senescence.
