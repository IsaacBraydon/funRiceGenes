OsPUB24	OsPUB7	Knockout Mutants of OsPUB7 Generated Using CRISPR/Cas9 Revealed Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Rice.	 Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that the expression of the genes (OsPUB23, OsPUB24, OsPUB66, and OsPUB67) known to be involved in stress increased in PUB7-GE and this, by forming a 1-node network with OsPUB66 and OsPUB7, acted as a negative regulator of drought and salinity stress
