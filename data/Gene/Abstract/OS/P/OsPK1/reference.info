Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes the final step of glycolysis. There are few reports on the role of PK in rice. Here, we identified a novel rice dwarf mutant, designated as ospk1, showing dwarfism, panicle enclosure, reduced seed set, and outgrowth of axillary buds from culm nodes. Sequence analyses of 5'-RACE indicated that a single T-DNA was inserted in the transcriptional regulatory region of OsPK1 in ospk1. Quantitative RT-PCR result showed that OsPK1 expression was decreased by approximately 90% in ospk1 compared with that in WT. Enzyme assay and transient expression in protoplasts indicated that OsPK1 encodes a cytosolic PK (PK(c)). Complementation with OsPK1 demonstrated that OsPK1 is responsible for the phenotype of ospk1. Quantitative RT-PCR and GUS staining analyses exhibited that OsPK1 was expressed mainly in leaf mesophyll cells, phloem companion cells in stems, and cortical parenchyma cells in roots. The transcriptions of four other putative enzymes involved in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway were altered in ospk1. The amount of pyruvate is decreased in ospk1. We propose that OsPK1 plays an important role through affecting the glycolytic pathway. The contents of glucose and fructose were markedly accumulated in flag leaf blade and panicle of ospk1. The sucrose level in panicle of ospk1 was decreased by approximately 84%. These findings indicated that both monosaccharide metabolism and sugar transport are altered due to the decreased expression of OsPK1. Together, these results provide new insights into the role of PK(c) in plant morphological development, especially plant height.
NA	Mitochondria-Associated Pyruvate Kinase Complexes Regulate Grain Filling in Rice 	2020	Plant Physiol	Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, Sichuan 611130, People's Republic of China.	Grain filling is a complex agronomic trait that directly determines grain weight and quality in rice (Oryza sativa). Nevertheless, key factors affecting grain filling remain poorly understood. Here, we identified a grain filling gene, OsPK3, encoding a pyruvate kinase (PK). The loss of function of OsPK3 caused reduced PK activity and Suc translocation defects from source to sink in rice, which led to compromised grain filling. OsPK3 was constitutively expressed but had relatively higher expression levels in leaf and developing caryopsis and specific expression signals in tissues involved in Suc transport and unloading, supporting its biological function in regulation of grain filling by affecting Suc translocation. Subcellular localization analysis of OsPK3 revealed its association with mitochondria, and OsPK3 physically interacted and formed heterodimers in vivo with two other PK isozymes, OsPK1 and OsPK4. Both OsPK1 and OsPK4 localized to the mitochondria and cytosol and were recruited to the mitochondria by OsPK3. Despite their high sequence similarity, OsPK1 and OsPK4 had distinct expression patterns. As observed for ospk3, disruption of OsPK1 caused pleiotropic defects, while OsPK4 loss of function led to severely chalky grains without other obvious defects. Collectively, we revealed that two mitochondria-associated pyruvate kinase complexes, OsPK3-OsPK1/OsPK4, are involved in regulation of grain filling by stage-specific fine-tuning of Suc translocation. 
NA	Gene Expression Dynamics in Rice Peduncles at the Heading Stage	2020	Front Genet	Grass Genetics and Informatics Group, School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.	Improving grain yield in the staple food crop rice has been long sought goal of plant biotechnology. One of the traits with significant impact on rice breeding programs is peduncle elongation at the time of heading failing which leads to significant reduction in grain yield due to incomplete panicle exsertion. To decipher transcriptional dynamics and molecular players underlying peduncle elongation, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of elongating and non-elongating peduncles in two Indian cultivars, Swarna and Pokkali, at the time of heading. Along with genes associated with cell division and cell wall biosynthesis, we observed significant enrichment of genes associated with auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis/signaling in the elongating peduncles before heading in both the genotypes. Similarly, genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and mobilization, abiotic stress response along with cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene biosynthesis/signaling were enriched in non-elongating peduncles post heading. Significant enrichment of genes belonging to key transcription factor families highlights their specialized roles in peduncle elongation and grain filling before and after heading, respectively. A comparison with anther/pollen development-related genes provided 76 candidates with overlapping roles in anther/pollen development and peduncle elongation. Some of these are important for carbohydrate remobilization to the developing grains. These can be engineered to combat with incomplete panicle exsertion in male sterile lines and manipulate carbohydrate dynamics in grasses. Overall, this study provides baseline information about potential target genes for engineering peduncle elongation with implications on plant height, biomass composition and grain yields in rice.
NA	SiMYB19 from Foxtail Millet (Setaria italica) Confers Transgenic Rice Tolerance to High Salt Stress in the Field.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	Key Laboratory of Sustainable Dryland Agriculture, College of Agriculture, Shanxi Agricultural University, Jinzhong 030801, China.	Salt stress is a major threat to crop quality and yield. Most experiments on salt stress-related genes have been conducted at the laboratory or greenhouse scale. Consequently, there is a lack of research demonstrating the merit of exploring these genes in field crops. Here, we found that the R2R3-MYB transcription factor SiMYB19 from foxtail millet is expressed mainly in the roots and is induced by various abiotic stressors such as salt, drought, low nitrogen, and abscisic acid. SiMYB19 is tentatively localized to the nucleus and activates transcription. It enhances salt tolerance in transgenic rice at the germination and seedling stages. SiMYB19 and salt pond-grown transgenic rice. SiMYB19 overexpression promotes abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation in transgenic rice and upregulates the ABA synthesis gene OsNCED3 and the ABA signal transduction pathway-related genes OsPK1 and OsABF2. Thus, SiMYB19 improves salt tolerance in transgenic rice by regulating ABA synthesis and signal transduction. Using rice heterologous expression analysis, the present study introduced a novel candidate gene for improving salt tolerance and increasing yield in crops grown in saline-alkali soil.
