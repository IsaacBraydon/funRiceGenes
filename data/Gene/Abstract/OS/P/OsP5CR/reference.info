In both rice lines, salt-stress induced OsP5CS1 gene expression, suggesting that proline accumulation occurs via OsP5CS1 gene expression during salt stress. An increase in the endogenous ABA level was required for the induction of OsP5CS1 gene expression by salt stress. Under salt stress, topical ABA application-induced OsP5CS1 gene expression only in the salt-resistant line but up-regulated OsP5CR gene expression in both rice lines, suggesting that the increased proline accumulation and salt resistance induced by topical ABA application may result from the up-regulation of OsP5CR and not, directly at least, from OsP5CS1. Moreover, exogenous ABA application up-regulates OsCam1-1 (the salt-stress-responsive calmodulin) gene expression, and calmodulin was shown to play a role in the signal transduction cascade in proline accumulation during salt stress. These data suggest the role of the calmodulin signaling cascade and the induction of OsP5CR gene expression in proline accumulation by exogenous ABA application.
