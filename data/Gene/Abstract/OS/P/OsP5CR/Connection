OsP5CR	OsP5CS|OsP5CS1	Exogenous ABA induces salt tolerance in indica rice (Oryza sativa L.): The role of OsP5CS1 and OsP5CR gene expression during salt stress	Under salt stress, topical ABA application-induced OsP5CS1 gene expression only in the salt-resistant line but up-regulated OsP5CR gene expression in both rice lines, suggesting that the increased proline accumulation and salt resistance induced by topical ABA application may result from the up-regulation of OsP5CR and not, directly at least, from OsP5CS1

OsMADS25	OsP5CR	Rice transcription factor OsMADS25 modulates root growth and confers salinity tolerance via the ABA-mediated regulatory pathway and ROS scavenging.	 Furthermore, OsMADS25 specifically activated the transcription of OsP5CR, a key component of proline biosynthesis, by binding to its promoter
