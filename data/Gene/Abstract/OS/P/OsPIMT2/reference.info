NA	Protein repair l -isoaspartyl methyltransferase 1 (PIMT1) in rice improves seed longevity by preserving embryo vigor and viability.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Rice Research Institute, Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.	Damaged proteins containing abnormal isoaspartyl (isoAsp) accumulate as seeds age and the abnormality is thought to undermine seed vigor. Protein-L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) is involved in isoAsp-containing protein repair. Two PIMT genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.), designated as OsPIMT1 and OsPIMT2, were isolated and investigated for their roles. The results indicated that OsPIMT2 was mainly present in green tissues, but OsPIMT1 largely accumulated in embryos. Confocal visualization of the transient expression of OsPIMTs showed that OsPIMT2 was localized in the chloroplast and nucleus, whereas OsPIMT1 was predominately found in the cytosol. Artificial aging results highlighted the sensitivity of the seeds of OsPIMT1 mutant line when subjected to accelerated aging. Overexpression of OsPIMT1 in transgenic seeds reduced the accumulation of isoAsp-containing protein in embryos, and increased embryo viability. The germination percentage of transgenic seeds overexpressing OsPIMT1 increased 9-15Â % compared to the WT seeds after 21-day of artificial aging, whereas seeds from the OsPIMT1 RNAi lines overaccumulated isoAsp in embryos and experienced rapid loss of seed germinability. Taken together, these data strongly indicated that OsPIMT1-related seed longevity improvement is probably due to the repair of detrimental isoAsp-containing proteins that over accumulate in embryos when subjected to accelerated aging.
NA	Rice PROTEIN l-ISOASPARTYL METHYLTRANSFERASE isoforms differentially accumulate during seed maturation to restrict deleterious isoAsp and reactive oxygen species accumulation and are implicated in seed vigor and longevity.	2016	New Phytol	National Institute of Plant Genome Research, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, Delhi, 110067, India.	PROTEIN l-ISOASPARTYL O-METHYLTRANSFERASE (PIMT) is a protein-repairing enzyme involved in seed vigor and longevity. However, the regulation of PIMT isoforms during seed development and the mechanism of PIMT-mediated improvement of seed vigor and longevity are largely unknown. In this study in rice (Oryza sativa), we demonstrate the dynamics and correlation of isoaspartyl (isoAsp)-repairing demands and PIMT activity, and their implications, during seed development, germination and aging, through biochemical, molecular and genetic studies. Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed that rice possesses various biochemically active and inactive PIMT isoforms. Transcript and western blot analyses clearly showed the seed development stage and tissue-specific accumulation of active isoforms. Immunolocalization studies revealed distinct isoform expression in embryo and aleurone layers. Further analyses of transgenic lines for each OsPIMT isoform revealed a clear role in the restriction of deleterious isoAsp and age-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation to improve seed vigor and longevity. Collectively, our data suggest that a PIMT-mediated, protein repair mechanism is initiated during seed development in rice, with each isoform playing a distinct, yet coordinated, role. Our results also raise the intriguing possibility that PIMT repairs antioxidative enzymes and proteins which restrict ROS accumulation, lipid peroxidation, etc. in seed, particularly during aging, thus contributing to seed vigor and longevity.
NA	ABI transcription factors and PROTEIN L-ISOASPARTYL METHYLTRANSFERASE module mediate seed desiccation tolerance and longevity in Oryza sativa.	2022	Development	MM203 Seed and Stress Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Plant Genome Research, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi 110067, India.	In contrast to desiccation-tolerant orthodox seeds, recalcitrant seeds are desiccation sensitive and are unable to survive for a prolonged time. Here, our analyses of Oryza species with contrasting seed desiccation tolerance reveals that PROTEIN L-ISOASPARTYL METHYLTRANSFERASE (PIMT), an enzyme that repairs abnormal isoaspartyl (isoAsp) residues in proteins, acts as a key player that governs seed desiccation tolerance to orthodox seeds but is ineffective in recalcitrant seeds. We observe that, unlike the orthodox seed of Oryza sativa, desiccation intolerance of the recalcitrant seeds of Oryza coarctata are linked to reduced PIMT activity and increased isoAsp accumulation due to the lack of coordinated action of ABA and ABI transcription factors to upregulate PIMT during maturation. We show that suppression of PIMT reduces, and its overexpression increases, seed desiccation tolerance and seed longevity in O. sativa. Our analyses further reveal that the ABI transcription factors undergo isoAsp formation that affect their functional competence; however, PIMT interacts with and repairs isoAsp residues and facilitates their functions. Our results thus illustrate a new insight into the mechanisms of acquisition of seed desiccation tolerance and longevity by ABI transcription factors and the PIMT module.
