OsPht1;10|OsPT10	OsPht1;9|OsPT9	Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice	We characterized the function of two rice phosphate (Pi) transporters: OsPHT1;9 (OsPT9) and OsPHT1;10 (OsPT10)
OsPht1;10|OsPT10	OsPht1;9|OsPT9	Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice	Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice
OsPht1;10|OsPT10	OsPht1;9|OsPT9	Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice	 OsPT9 and OsPT10 were expressed in the root epidermis, root hairs and lateral roots, with their expression being specifically induced by Pi starvation
OsPht1;10|OsPT10	OsPht1;9|OsPT9	Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice	 High-affinity Km values for Pi transport of OsPT9 and OsPT10 were determined by yeast experiments and two-electrode voltage clamp analysis of anion transport in Xenopus oocytes expressing OsPT9 and OsPT10
OsPht1;10|OsPT10	OsPht1;9|OsPT9	Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice	 Pi uptake and Pi concentrations in transgenic plants harbouring overexpressed OsPT9 and OsPT10 were determined by Pi concentration analysis and (33) P-labelled Pi uptake rate analysis
OsPht1;10|OsPT10	OsPht1;9|OsPT9	Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice	 Conversely, although no alterations in Pi concentration were found in OsPT9 or OsPT10 knockdown plants, a significant reduction in Pi concentration in both shoots and roots was observed in double-knockdown plants grown under both high- and low-Pi conditions
OsPht1;10|OsPT10	OsPht1;9|OsPT9	Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice	 Taken together, our results suggest that OsPT9 and OsPT10 redundantly function in Pi uptake
