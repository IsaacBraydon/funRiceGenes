OsPSKR1	resistance	Identification of the phytosulfokine receptor 1 (OsPSKR1) confers resistance to bacterial leaf streak in rice.	 OsPSKR1 overexpression (OE) lines had greater resistance to RS105 than the wild type
OsPSKR1	resistance	Identification of the phytosulfokine receptor 1 (OsPSKR1) confers resistance to bacterial leaf streak in rice.	 Overall, OsPSKR1 functions as a candidate PSK receptor and regulates resistance to Xoc by activating the expression of pathogenesis-related genes involved in the SA pathway in rice
OsPSKR1	 sa 	Identification of the phytosulfokine receptor 1 (OsPSKR1) confers resistance to bacterial leaf streak in rice.	 Overall, OsPSKR1 functions as a candidate PSK receptor and regulates resistance to Xoc by activating the expression of pathogenesis-related genes involved in the SA pathway in rice
OsPSKR1	SA	Identification of the phytosulfokine receptor 1 (OsPSKR1) confers resistance to bacterial leaf streak in rice.	 Overall, OsPSKR1 functions as a candidate PSK receptor and regulates resistance to Xoc by activating the expression of pathogenesis-related genes involved in the SA pathway in rice
