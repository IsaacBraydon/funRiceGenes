OsPUB3	grain	Control of Grain Weight and Size in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) by OsPUB3 Encoding a U-Box E3 Ubiquitin Ligase.	Control of Grain Weight and Size in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) by OsPUB3 Encoding a U-Box E3 Ubiquitin Ligase.
OsPUB3	grain	Control of Grain Weight and Size in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) by OsPUB3 Encoding a U-Box E3 Ubiquitin Ligase.	 Their differences on grain weight and size were significant in the background of non-functional gse5, but non-significant in the background of functional GSE5, indicating a genetic interaction between OsPUB3 and GSE5
OsPUB3	grain	Control of Grain Weight and Size in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) by OsPUB3 Encoding a U-Box E3 Ubiquitin Ligase.	 Cloning of OsPUB3 provides a new gene resource for investigating the regulation of grain weight and size
