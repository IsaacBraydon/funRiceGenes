NA	Homologous U-box E3 Ubiquitin Ligases OsPUB2 and OsPUB3 Are Involved in the Positive Regulation of Low Temperature Stress Response in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Front Plant Sci	Department of Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University Seoul, South Korea.	Rice U-box E3 Ub ligases (OsPUBs) are implicated in biotic stress responses. However, their cellular roles in response to abiotic stress are poorly understood. In this study, we performed functional analyses of two homologous OsPUB2 and OsPUB3 in response to cold stress (4Â°C). OsPUB2 was up-regulated by high salinity, drought, and cold, whereas OsPUB3 was constitutively expressed. A subcellular localization assay revealed that OsPUB2 and OsPUB3 were localized to the exocyst positive organelle (EXPO)-like punctate structures. OsPUB2 was also localized to the nuclei. OsPUB2 and OsPUB3 formed a hetero-dimeric complex as well as homo-dimers in yeast cells and in vitro. OsPUB2/OsPUB3 exhibited self-ubiquitination activities in vitro and were rapidly degraded in the cell-free extracts with apparent half-lives of 150-160 min. This rapid degradation of OsPUB2/OsPUB3 was delayed in the presence of the crude extracts of cold-treated seedlings (apparent half-lives of 200-280 min). Moreover, a hetero-dimeric form of OsPUB2/OsPUB3 was more stable than the homo-dimers. These results suggested that OsPUB2 and OsPUB3 function coordinately in response to cold stress. OsPUB2- and OsPUB3-overexpressing transgenic rice plants showed markedly better tolerance to cold stress than did the wild-type plants in terms of survival rates, chlorophyll content, ion leakage, and expression levels of cold stress-inducible marker genes. Taken together, these results suggested that the two homologous rice U-box E3 Ub ligases OsPUB2 and OsPUB3 are positive regulators of the response to cold stress.
NA	Control of Grain Weight and Size in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) by OsPUB3 Encoding a U-Box E3 Ubiquitin Ligase.	2022	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, China.	Grain weight and size, mostly determined by grain length, width and thickness, are crucial traits affecting grain quality and yield in rice. A quantitative trait locus controlling grain length and width in rice, qGS1-35.2, was previously fine-mapped in a 57.7-kb region on the long arm of chromosome 1. In this study, OsPUB3, a gene encoding a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase, was validated as the causal gene for qGS1-35.2. The effects were confirmed firstly by using CRISPR/Cas9-based mutagenesis and then through transgenic complementation of a Cas9-free knock-out (KO) mutant. Two homozygous KO lines were produced, each having a 1-bp insertion in OsPUB3 which caused frameshift mutation and premature termination. Compared with the recipient and a transgenic-negative control, both mutants showed significant decreases in grain weight and size. In transgenic complementation populations derived from four independent T(0) plants, grain weight of transgenic-positive plants was significantly higher than transgenic-negative plants, coming with increased grain length and a less significant decrease in grain width. Based on data documented in RiceVarMap V2.0, eight haplotypes were classified according to six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in the OsPUB3 coding region of 4695 rice accessions. Significant differences on grain size traits were detected between the three major haplotypes, Hap1, Hap2 and Hap3 that jointly occupy 98.6% of the accessions. Hap3 having the largest grain weight and grain length but intermediate grain width exhibits a potential for simultaneously improving grain yield and quality. In another set of 257 indica rice cultivars tested in our study, Hap1 and Hap2 remained to be the two largest groups. Their differences on grain weight and size were significant in the background of non-functional gse5, but non-significant in the background of functional GSE5, indicating a genetic interaction between OsPUB3 and GSE5. Cloning of OsPUB3 provides a new gene resource for investigating the regulation of grain weight and size.
NA	Control of Grain Shape and Size in Rice by Two Functional Alleles of OsPUB3 in Varied Genetic Background.	2022	Plants (Basel)	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology and Chinese National Center for Rice Improvement, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China.	Grain shape and size are key determinants of grain appearance quality and yield in rice. In our previous study, a grain shape QTL, qGS1-35.2, was fine-mapped using near-isogenic lines (NILs) derived from a cross between Zhenshan 97 (ZS97) and Milyang 46 (MY46). One annotated gene, OsPUB3, was found to be the most likely candidate gene. Here, knockout and overexpression experiments were performed to investigate the effects of OsPUB3 on grain shape and size. Four traits were tested, including grain length, grain width, grain weight, and the ratio of grain length to width. Knockout of OsPUB3 in NIL(ZS97), NIL(MY46), and another rice cultivar carrying the OsPUB3(MY46) allele all caused decreases in grain width and weight and increases in the ratio of grain length to width. Results also showed that the magnitude of the mutational effects varied depending on the target allele and the genetic background. Moreover, it was found that NIL(ZS97) and NIL(MY46) carried different functional alleles of OsPUB3, causing differences in grain shape rather than grain weight. In the overexpression experiment, significant differences between transgenic-positive and transgenic-negative plants were detected in all four traits. These results indicate that OsPUB3 regulates grain shape and size through a complex mechanism and is a good target for deciphering the regulatory network of grain shape. This gene could be used to improve grain appearance quality through molecular breeding as well.
