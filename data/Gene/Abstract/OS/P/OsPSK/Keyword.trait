OsPSK	seedling	Oryza sativa PSK gene encodes a precursor of phytosulfokine-alpha , a sulfated peptide growth factor found in plants	 Although PSK-α molecules have never been identified in any intact plant, reverse transcription–PCR analysis demonstrated that OsPSK is expressed in rice seedlings, indicating that PSK-α may be important for plant cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo
OsPSK	growth	Molecular cloning and characterization of OsPSK, a gene encoding a precursor for phytosulfokine-alpha, required for rice cell proliferation	We previously characterized an OsPSK cDNA encoding a precursor of phytosulfokine-alpha (PSK-alpha), a peptide plant growth factor
OsPSK	auxin	Molecular cloning and characterization of OsPSK, a gene encoding a precursor for phytosulfokine-alpha, required for rice cell proliferation	 Northern blot analyses suggest that the expression of OsPSK is reinforced by auxin and cytokinin
OsPSK	cytokinin	Molecular cloning and characterization of OsPSK, a gene encoding a precursor for phytosulfokine-alpha, required for rice cell proliferation	 Northern blot analyses suggest that the expression of OsPSK is reinforced by auxin and cytokinin
