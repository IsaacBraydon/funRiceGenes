79307538.pdf	A Rapid and Efficient System of Agrobacterium Infection-Mediated Transient Gene Expression in Rice Oc Cells and Its Application for Analysis of the Expression and Antisense Suppression of Preprophytosulfokine, a Precursor of Phytosulfokine-alpha, Encoded by OsPSK Gene	2000	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Bioactive Natural Product Chemistry, Graduate School of Bio-Agricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Japan.	A rapid and efficient system for Agrobacterium infection-mediated transient gene expression in rice has been developed. Using this system, transient expression of preprophytosulfokine, a precursor of phytosulfokine-a, encoded by OsPSK gene was analyzed. The results suggest that the Agrobacterium infection-mediated transient gene expression system is as efficient in rice Oc cells as in tobacco BY-2 cells and might be useful for rapid analysis not only of foreign gene expression, but also of antisense gene suppression.
njionjhio.pdf	Molecular cloning and characterization of OsPSK, a gene encoding a precursor for phytosulfokine-alpha, required for rice cell proliferation	2000	Plant Mol Biol	Laboratory of Bioactive Natural Product Chemistry, Graduate School of Bio-Agricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Japan. hyang@nagoya-u.ac.jp	We previously characterized an OsPSK cDNA encoding a precursor of phytosulfokine-alpha (PSK-alpha), a peptide plant growth factor. Southern blot analysis suggested that OsPSK is a single-copy gene in rice, which we have isolated and characterized. The OsPSK gene consists of one large intron and two exons. The 5-amino acid PSK-alpha sequence located close to the COOH-terminus of the precursor is encoded in the second exon. A putative TATA box was found at position -68 with respect to the transcription initiation site. Upstream of this sequence, several potential regulatory elements, including one CAAT-box, three CCAAT-boxes, one enhancer core-like sequence, and three E-boxes could be identified. By constructing plasmids with various lengths of the 5'-upstream regions of the OsPSK gene fused to the coding sequence for bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS), we demonstrated a region 1.9 kb upstream of the transcription initiation point, which contains most of the putative 5'-regulatory elements, to be sufficient for maximal-level GUS expression in transformed rice Oc cells. The promoter of the OsPSK gene gave significantly higher levels of GUS expression than the CaMV 35S promoter. These results suggest that the OsPSK promoter could be useful for the constitutive expression of a foreign gene at high levels in transformed rice culture cells. Northern blot analyses suggest that the expression of OsPSK is reinforced by auxin and cytokinin.
PNAS-1999-Yang-13560-5.pdf	Oryza sativa PSK gene encodes a precursor of phytosulfokine-alpha , a sulfated peptide growth factor found in plants	1999	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences	Laboratories of Bioactive Natural Product Chemistry and Biochemistry, Graduate School of Bio-Agricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan	Phytosulfokine-α [PSK-α, Tyr(SO3H)-Ile-Tyr(SO3H)-Thr-Gln], a sulfated mitogenic peptide found in plants, strongly promotes proliferation of plant cells in culture at very low concentrations. Oryza sativa PSK (OsPSK) cDNA encoding a PSK-α precursor has been isolated. The cDNA is 725 base pairs long, and the 89-aa product, preprophytosulfokine, has a 22-aa hydrophobic region that resembles a cleavable leader peptide at its NH2 terminus. The PSK-α sequence occurs only once within the precursor, close to the COOH terminus. [Ser4]PSK-α was secreted by transgenic rice Oc cells harboring a mutated OsPSK cDNA, suggesting proteolytic processing from the larger precursor, a feature commonly found in animal systems. Whereas PSK-α in conditioned medium with sense transgenic Oc cells was 1.6 times as concentrated as in the control case, antisense transgenic Oc cells produced less than 60% of the control level. Preprophytosulfokine mRNA was detected at an elevated constitutive level in rice Oc culture cells on RNA blot analysis. Although PSK-α molecules have never been identified in any intact plant, reverse transcription–PCR analysis demonstrated that OsPSK is expressed in rice seedlings, indicating that PSK-α may be important for plant cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. DNA blot analysis demonstrated that OsPSK homologs may occur in dicot as well as monocot plants.
