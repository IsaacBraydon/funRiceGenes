OsPIN2|LRA1	TAC1	Over-expression of OsPIN2 leads to increased tiller numbers, angle and shorter plant height through suppression of OsLAZY1	OsPIN2-over-expressing plants had suppressed the expression of a gravitropism-related gene OsLazy1 in the shoots, but unaltered expression of OsPIN1b and OsTAC1, which were reported as tiller angle controllers in rice
OsPIN2|LRA1	TAC1	Over-expression of OsPIN2 leads to increased tiller numbers, angle and shorter plant height through suppression of OsLAZY1	The data suggest that OsPIN2 has a distinct auxin-dependent regulation pathway together with OsPIN1b and OsTAC1 controlling rice shoot architecture
OsPIN2|LRA1	VLN2	VLN2 Regulates Plant Architecture by Affecting Microfilament Dynamics and Polar Auxin Transport in Rice	Together, our results demonstrate that VLN2 plays an important role in regulating plant architecture by modulating MF dynamics, recycling of PIN2, and polar auxin transport
EP3|LP	OsPIN2|LRA1	Overexpression of OsPIN2 Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice.	 In this study, phenotypic and genetic analyses were undertaken to explore the role of OsPIN2, an auxin efflux transporter, in regulating the growth and development of rice roots under normal nutrition condition (control) and low-phosphate condition (LP)
EP3|LP	OsPIN2|LRA1	Overexpression of OsPIN2 Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice.	 Higher expression of OsPIN2 was observed in rice plants under LP compared to the control
EP3|LP	OsPIN2|LRA1	Overexpression of OsPIN2 Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice.	 Compared to WT plants, overexpression of OsPIN2 had a shorter root length through decreased root cell elongation under control and LP
EP3|LP	OsPIN2|LRA1	Overexpression of OsPIN2 Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice.	 Surprisingly, overexpression of OsPIN2 might increase auxin distribution in epidermis of root, resulting in greater RH formation but less LR development in OE plants than in WT plants in the control condition but levels similar of these under LP
EP3|LP	OsPIN2|LRA1	Overexpression of OsPIN2 Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice.	 These results suggest that higher OsPIN2 expression regulates rice root growth and development maybe by changing auxin distribution in roots under LP condition
