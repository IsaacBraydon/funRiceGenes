OsPIN2	 In this study, it was found that the rice OsPIN2 overexpression line (OX1) had significantly reduced Al content in its cell wall and increased Al concentration in cell sap only in rice root tips relative to the wild-type (WT)	 In this study, it was found that the rice OsPIN2 overexpression line (OX1) had significantly reduced Al content in its cell wall and increased Al concentration in cell sap only in rice root tips relative to the wild-type (WT)
OsPIN2|LRA1	Overexpression of OsPIN2 Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice. |  Higher expression of OsPIN2 was observed in rice plants under LP compared to the control |  However, overexpression of OsPIN2 caused a loss of sensitivity in the root response to P deficiency |  Compared to WT plants, overexpression of OsPIN2 had a shorter root length through decreased root cell elongation under control and LP |  Surprisingly, overexpression of OsPIN2 might increase auxin distribution in epidermis of root, resulting in greater RH formation but less LR development in OE plants than in WT plants in the control condition but levels similar of these under LP |  These results suggest that higher OsPIN2 expression regulates rice root growth and development maybe by changing auxin distribution in roots under LP condition	Overexpression of OsPIN2 Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice. |  However, overexpression of OsPIN2 caused a loss of sensitivity in the root response to P deficiency |  Compared to WT plants, overexpression of OsPIN2 had a shorter root length through decreased root cell elongation under control and LP |  Surprisingly, overexpression of OsPIN2 might increase auxin distribution in epidermis of root, resulting in greater RH formation but less LR development in OE plants than in WT plants in the control condition but levels similar of these under LP
