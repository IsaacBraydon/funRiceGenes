OsPDC1	OsPDC2	Production and phenotypic analysis of rice transgenics with altered levels of pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase proteins	 Correlations noted in this study between the pattern of expression of the Pdc alpha-subunit and Ospdc2 transcript as well as between the Pdc beta-subunit and Ospdc1 transcript suggest the possibility that alpha-subunit is encoded by Ospdc2 and that beta-subunit is encoded by Ospdc1
OsPDC1	OsPDC2	Characterization of pyruvate decarboxylase genes from rice	 Rice pdc2 is also inducible by anoxia but to a much lesser extent than pdc1
