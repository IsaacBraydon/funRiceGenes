NA	Clock component OsPRR73 positively regulates rice salt tolerance by modulating OsHKT2;1-mediated sodium homeostasis	2020	EMBO J	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	The roles of clock components in salt stress tolerance remain incompletely characterized in rice. Here, we show that, among OsPRR (Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator) family members, OsPRR73 specifically confers salt tolerance in rice. Notably, the grain size and yield of osprr73 null mutants were significantly decreased in the presence of salt stress, with accumulated higher level of reactive oxygen species and sodium ions. RNA sequencing and biochemical assays identified OsHKT2;1, encoding a plasma membrane-localized Na+ transporter, as a transcriptional target of OsPRR73 in mediating salt tolerance. Correspondingly, null mutants of OsHKT2;1 displayed an increased tolerance to salt stress. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays further identified HDAC10 as nuclear interactor of OsPRR73 and co-repressor of OsHKT2;1. Consistently, H3K9ac histone marks at OsHKT2;1 promoter regions were significantly reduced in osprr73 mutant. Together, our findings reveal that salt-induced OsPRR73 expression confers salt tolerance by recruiting HDAC10 to transcriptionally repress OsHKT2;1, thus reducing cellular Na+ accumulation. This exemplifies a new molecular link between clock components and salt stress tolerance in rice.
NA	Two central circadian oscillators OsPRR59 and OsPRR95 modulate magnesium homeostasis and carbon fixation in rice.	2022	Mol Plant	Root Biology Center, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China.	Photosynthesis, which provides oxygen and energy for all living organisms, is circadian regulated. Photosynthesis-associated metabolism must tightly coordinate with the circadian clock to maximize the efficiency of the light-energy capture and carbon fixation. However, the molecular basis for the interplay of photosynthesis and the circadian clock is not fully understood, particularly in crop plants. Here, we report two central oscillator genes of circadian clock, OsPRR95 and OsPRR59 in rice, which function as transcriptional repressors to negatively regulate the rhythmic expression of OsMGT3 encoding a chloroplast-localized Mg(2+) transporter. OsMGT3-dependent rhythmic Mg fluctuations modulate carbon fixation and consequent sugar output in rice chloroplasts. Furthermore, sugar triggers the increase of superoxide, which may act as a feedback signal to positively regulate the expression of OsPRR95 and OsPRR59. Taken together, our results reveal a negative-feedback loop that strengthens the crosstalk between photosynthetic carbon fixation and the circadian clock, which may improve plan adaptation and performance in fluctuating environments.
NA	A regulatory loop establishes the link between the circadian clock and abscisic acid signaling in rice.	2022	Plant Physiol	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	There is a close regulatory relationship between the circadian clock and the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway in regulating many developmental processes and stress responses. However, the exact feedback regulation mechanism between them is still poorly understood. Here, we identified the rice (Oryza sativa) clock component PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 95 (OsPRR95) as a transcriptional regulator that accelerates seed germination and seedling growth by inhibiting ABA signaling. We also found that OsPRR95 binds to the ABA receptor gene REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTORS10 (OsRCAR10) DNA and inhibits its expression. Genetic analysis showed OsRCAR10 acts downstream of OsPRR95 in mediating ABA responses. In addition, the induction of OsPRR95 by ABA partly required a functional OsRCAR10, and the ABA responsive element (ABRE)-binding factor ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE5 (OsABI5) bound directly to the promoter of OsPRR95 and activated its expression, thus establishing a regulatory feedback loop between OsPRR95, OsRCAR10 and OsABI5. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the OsRCAR10-OsABI5-OsPRR95 feedback loop modulates ABA signaling to fine-tune seed germination and seedling growth, thus establishing the molecular link between ABA signaling and the circadian clock.
