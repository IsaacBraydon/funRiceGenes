OsPRR95	 Here, we report two central oscillator genes of circadian clock, OsPRR95 and OsPRR59 in rice, which function as transcriptional repressors to negatively regulate the rhythmic expression of OsMGT3 encoding a chloroplast-localized Mg(2+) transporter |  Furthermore, sugar triggers the increase of superoxide, which may act as a feedback signal to positively regulate the expression of OsPRR95 and OsPRR59
OsPRR95	 We also found that OsPRR95 binds to the ABA receptor gene REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTORS10 (OsRCAR10) DNA and inhibits its expression |  In addition, the induction of OsPRR95 by ABA partly required a functional OsRCAR10, and the ABA responsive element (ABRE)-binding factor ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE5 (OsABI5) bound directly to the promoter of OsPRR95 and activated its expression, thus establishing a regulatory feedback loop between OsPRR95, OsRCAR10 and OsABI5
