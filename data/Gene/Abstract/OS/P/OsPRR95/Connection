OsPRR95	SDG724|lvp1	Crosstalk between the Circadian Clock and Histone Methylation.	 Furthermore, we identified three candidate targets (OsGI, OsCCT38, and OsPRR95) of OsLHY and one candidate target (OsCRY1a) of SDG724 in the clock pathway

OsMGT3	OsPRR95	Two central circadian oscillators OsPRR59 and OsPRR95 modulate magnesium homeostasis and carbon fixation in rice.	 Here, we report two central oscillator genes of circadian clock, OsPRR95 and OsPRR59 in rice, which function as transcriptional repressors to negatively regulate the rhythmic expression of OsMGT3 encoding a chloroplast-localized Mg(2+) transporter

OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsPRR95	A regulatory loop establishes the link between the circadian clock and abscisic acid signaling in rice.	 In addition, the induction of OsPRR95 by ABA partly required a functional OsRCAR10, and the ABA responsive element (ABRE)-binding factor ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE5 (OsABI5) bound directly to the promoter of OsPRR95 and activated its expression, thus establishing a regulatory feedback loop between OsPRR95, OsRCAR10 and OsABI5
