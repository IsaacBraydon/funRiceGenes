OsPRR95	SDG724|lvp1	Crosstalk between the Circadian Clock and Histone Methylation.	 Furthermore, we identified three candidate targets (OsGI, OsCCT38, and OsPRR95) of OsLHY and one candidate target (OsCRY1a) of SDG724 in the clock pathway
OsLHY	OsPRR95	Crosstalk between the Circadian Clock and Histone Methylation.	 Furthermore, we identified three candidate targets (OsGI, OsCCT38, and OsPRR95) of OsLHY and one candidate target (OsCRY1a) of SDG724 in the clock pathway
OsMGT3	OsPRR95	Two central circadian oscillators OsPRR59 and OsPRR95 modulate magnesium homeostasis and carbon fixation in rice.	 Here, we report two central oscillator genes of circadian clock, OsPRR95 and OsPRR59 in rice, which function as transcriptional repressors to negatively regulate the rhythmic expression of OsMGT3 encoding a chloroplast-localized Mg(2+) transporter
