NA	An R2R3 MYB transcription factor confers brown planthopper resistance by regulating the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase pathway in rice.	2019	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, 210095 Nanjing, China.	Brown planthopper (BPH) is one of the most destructive insects affecting rice (Oryza sativa L.) production. Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is a key enzyme involved in plant defense against pathogens, but the role of PAL in insect resistance is still poorly understood. Here we show that expression of the majority of PALs in rice is significantly induced by BPH feeding. Knockdown of OsPALs significantly reduces BPH resistance, whereas overexpression of OsPAL8 in a susceptible rice cultivar significantly enhances its BPH resistance. We found that OsPALs mediate resistance to BPH by regulating the biosynthesis and accumulation of salicylic acid and lignin. Furthermore, we show that expression of OsPAL6 and OsPAL8 in response to BPH attack is directly up-regulated by OsMYB30, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the phenylpropanoid pathway plays an important role in BPH resistance response, and provide valuable targets for genetic improvement of BPH resistance in rice.
NA	Genetic Architecture and Key Genes Controlling the Diversity of Oil Composition in Rice Grain	2020	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Centre of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Rice grain oil is a valuable nutrient source. However, the genetic basis of oil biosynthesis in rice grains remains unclear. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study on oil composition and oil concentration in a diverse panel of 533 cultivated rice accessions. High variation for eleven oil-related traits was observed and oil composition was found to differentiate in rice grains among the subpopulations. We identified 46 loci that are significantly associated with grain oil concentration or composition, of which 16 were detected in three RIL populations. Twenty-six candidate genes encoding enzymes involved in oil metabolism were identified from these forty-six loci, of which four genes (OsPAL6, OsLIN6, OsMYR2 and OsFAE6) were found to contribute to natural variation in oil composition and show differentiation among the subpopulations. Interestingly, population genetic analyses revealed that specific haplotypes of OsPAL6 and OsLIN6 were selected in japonica rice. Based on these results, we propose a possible oil biosynthetic pathway in rice grains. Collectively, our study provides new insights into the genetic basis of oil biosynthesis in rice grains and would facilitate marker-based breeding of rice varieties with enhanced oil and grain quality.
