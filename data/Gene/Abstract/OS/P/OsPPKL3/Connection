GL3.1|qGL3-1|qGL3|OsPPKL1	OsPPKL3	Rare allele of OsPPKL1 associated with grain length causes extra-large grain and a significant yield increase in rice	 The rice genome has other two OsPPKL1 homologs, OsPPKL2 and OsPPKL3
GL3.1|qGL3-1|qGL3|OsPPKL1	OsPPKL3	Rare allele of OsPPKL1 associated with grain length causes extra-large grain and a significant yield increase in rice	 Transgenic studies showed that OsPPKL1 and OsPPKL3 function as negative regulators of grain length, whereas OsPPKL2 as a positive regulator
