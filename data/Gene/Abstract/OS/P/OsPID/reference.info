Morita-2007-Characterization of.pdf	Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Graduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Yayoi, Bunkyo, Tokyo, 113-0032, Japan.	PINOID, a serine threonine protein kinase in Arabidopsis, controls auxin distribution through a positive control of subcellular localization of PIN auxin efflux carriers. Compared with the rapid progress in understanding mechanisms of auxin action in dicot species, little is known about auxin action in monocot species. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of OsPID, the PINOID ortholog of rice. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the rice genome contains a single PID ortholog, OsPID. Constitutive overexpression of OsPID caused a variety of abnormalities, such as delay of adventitious root development, curled growth of shoots and agravitropism. Abnormalities observed in the plants that overexpress OsPID could be phenocopied by treatment with an inhibitor of active polar transport of auxin, indicating that OsPID could be involved in the control of polar auxin transport in rice. Analysis of OsPID mRNA distribution showed a complex pattern in shoot meristems, indicating that it probably plays a role in the pattern formation and organogenesis in the rice shoot.
NA	PINOID is required for formation of the stigma and style in rice.	2019	Plant Physiol	Huazhong Agricultural University CITY: Wuhan China [CN].	The stigma is the entry point for sexual reproduction in plants, but the mechanisms underlying stigma development are largely unknown. Here, we disrupted putative auxin biosynthetic and signaling genes to evaluate their roles in rice (Oryza sativa) development. Disruption of the rice PINOID (OsPID) gene completely eliminated the development of stigmas, and overexpression of OsPID led to over-proliferation of stigmas, suggesting that OsPID is a key determinant for stigma development. Interestingly, ospid mutants did not display defects in flower initiation, nor did they develop any pin-like inflorescences, a characteristic phenotype observed in pid mutants in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and maize (Zea mays). We constructed double mutants of OsPID and its closest homolog, OsPIDb, yet the double mutants still did not develop any pin-like inflorescences, indicating that either ospid is compensated by additional homologous genes or OsPID has different functions in rice compared to PID in other organisms. We then knocked out one of the NAKED PINS IN YUC MUTANTS 1 (NPY) genes, which cause the formation of pin-like inflorescences in Arabidopsis when compromised, in the ospid background. The ospid osnyp2 double mutants developed pin-like inflorescences, which were phenotypically similar to pid mutants in Arabidopsis and maize, demonstrating that the roles of OsPID in inflorescence development are likely masked by redundant partners. This work identified a key determinant for stigma development in rice and revealed a complex picture of the PID gene in rice development. Furthermore, the stigma-less ospid mutants are potentially useful in producing hybrid rice.
NA	OsPINOID Regulates Stigma and Ovule Initiation through Maintenance of the Floral Meristem by Auxin Signaling.	2019	Plant Physiol	Yangzhou University CITY: Yangzhou STATE: Jiangsu China [CN].	Stigma and ovule initiation is essential for sexual reproduction in flowering plants. However, the mechanism underlying the initiation of stigma and ovule primordia remains elusive. We identified a stigma-less mutant of rice (Oryza sativa) and revealed it was caused by the mutation in the PINOID (OsPID) gene. Unlike the pid mutant that shows typical pin-like inflorescences in maize (Zea mays) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the ospid mutant does not display any defects in inflorescence development and flower initiation. Moreover, the ospid mutant fails to develop normal ovules in most spikelets. The auxin activity in the young pistil of ospid was lower than that in the wild-type pistil. Furthermore, the expression of most auxin response factor (ARF) genes was down-regulated, and OsETTIN1, OsETTIN2 and OsMONOPTEROS lost their rearrangements of expression patterns during pistil and stamen primordia development in ospid. Moreover, the transcription of the floral meristem marker gene, OSH1, was down-regulated and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER4 (FON4), the putative ortholog of Arabidopsis CLAVATA3 (CLV3), was up-regulated in the pistil primordium of ospid. These results suggested that the meristem proliferation in the pistil primordium might be arrested prematurely in ospid. Based on these results, we propose that the OsPID-mediated auxin signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of rice stigma and ovule initiation by maintaining the floral meristem.
NA	PINOID regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin transport and interacts with MADS16 in rice.	2020	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	In rice (Oryza sativa L.), floral organ development is an important trait. Although a role for PINOID in regulating floral organ development was reported recently, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we isolated and characterized an abnormal floral organ mutant and mapped the causative gene through an improved MutMap method. Molecular study revealed that the observed phenotype is caused by a point mutation in OsPINOID (OsPID) gene; therefore, we named the mutation as ospid-4. Our data demonstrate that OsPID interacts with OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b to regulate polar auxin transport as shown previously. Additionally, OsPID also interacts with OsMADS16 to regulate transcription during floral organ development in rice. Together, we propose a model that OsPID regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin polar transport and interaction with OsMADS16 and/or LAX1 in rice. These results provide a novel insight into the role of OsPID in regulating floral organ development of rice, especially in stigma development, which would be useful for genetic improvement of high-yield breeding of rice.
