OsPID|OsPINOID	OsPIDb	PINOID is required for formation of the stigma and style in rice.	 We constructed double mutants of OsPID and its closest homolog, OsPIDb, yet the double mutants still did not develop any pin-like inflorescences, indicating that either ospid is compensated by additional homologous genes or OsPID has different functions in rice compared to PID in other organisms
FON2|FON4|TG1	OsPID|OsPINOID	OsPINOID Regulates Stigma and Ovule Initiation through Maintenance of the Floral Meristem by Auxin Signaling.	 Moreover, the transcription of the floral meristem marker gene, OSH1, was down-regulated and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER4 (FON4), the putative ortholog of Arabidopsis CLAVATA3 (CLV3), was up-regulated in the pistil primordium of ospid
OsETT2|OsETTIN2	OsPID|OsPINOID	OsPINOID Regulates Stigma and Ovule Initiation through Maintenance of the Floral Meristem by Auxin Signaling.	 Furthermore, the expression of most auxin response factor (ARF) genes was down-regulated, and OsETTIN1, OsETTIN2 and OsMONOPTEROS lost their rearrangements of expression patterns during pistil and stamen primordia development in ospid
OsETTIN1|OsARF15	OsPID|OsPINOID	OsPINOID Regulates Stigma and Ovule Initiation through Maintenance of the Floral Meristem by Auxin Signaling.	 Furthermore, the expression of most auxin response factor (ARF) genes was down-regulated, and OsETTIN1, OsETTIN2 and OsMONOPTEROS lost their rearrangements of expression patterns during pistil and stamen primordia development in ospid
OSH1|Oskn1	OsPID|OsPINOID	OsPINOID Regulates Stigma and Ovule Initiation through Maintenance of the Floral Meristem by Auxin Signaling.	 Moreover, the transcription of the floral meristem marker gene, OSH1, was down-regulated and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER4 (FON4), the putative ortholog of Arabidopsis CLAVATA3 (CLV3), was up-regulated in the pistil primordium of ospid
LAX1	OsPID|OsPINOID	PINOID regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin transport and interacts with MADS16 in rice.	 Together, we propose a model that OsPID regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin polar transport and interaction with OsMADS16 and/or LAX1 in rice
OsMADS16|SPW1	OsPID|OsPINOID	PINOID regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin transport and interacts with MADS16 in rice.	 Additionally, OsPID also interacts with OsMADS16 to regulate transcription during floral organ development in rice
OsMADS16|SPW1	OsPID|OsPINOID	PINOID regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin transport and interacts with MADS16 in rice.	 Together, we propose a model that OsPID regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin polar transport and interaction with OsMADS16 and/or LAX1 in rice
OsPID|OsPINOID	OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	PINOID regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin transport and interacts with MADS16 in rice.	 Our data demonstrate that OsPID interacts with OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b to regulate polar auxin transport as shown previously
OsPID|OsPINOID	OsPIN1a	PINOID regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin transport and interacts with MADS16 in rice.	 Our data demonstrate that OsPID interacts with OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b to regulate polar auxin transport as shown previously
OsPID|OsPINOID	OsPIN1c	Auxin Efflux Transporters OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d Function Redundantly in Regulating Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Panicle Development.	 Additionally, several critical regulators of reproductive development, such as OsPID, LAX1, OsMADS1, and OsSPL14/IPA1, were differentially expressed in ospin1c-1 ospin1d-1, supporting the hypothesis that OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d are involved in regulating panicle development
