OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR2	OsPHR2 is involved in phosphate-starvation signaling and excessive phosphate accumulation in shoots of plants	In this work, two OsPHR genes from rice (Oryza sativa) were isolated and designated as OsPHR1 and OsPHR2 based on amino acid sequence homology to AtPHR1
OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR2	OsPHR2 is involved in phosphate-starvation signaling and excessive phosphate accumulation in shoots of plants	Our results showed that both OsPHR1 and OsPHR2 are involved in Pi-starvation signaling pathway by regulation of the expression of Pi-starvation-induced genes, whereas only OsPHR2 overexpression results in the excessive accumulation of Pi in shoots under Pi-sufficient conditions
OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR2	Role of OsPHR2 on phosphorus homeostasis and root hairs development in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Two PHR genes were isolated from rice and designated as OsPHR1 and OsPHR2 based on amino acid sequence homology to AtPHR1
OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR2	Role of OsPHR2 on phosphorus homeostasis and root hairs development in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Transgenic plants with overexpression and repression of OsPHR1 and OsPHR2, respectively, were used for investigation of roles of the genes in Pi-signaling pathway and Pi homeostasis under Pi-sufficient and deficient conditions
OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR2	Genetic manipulation of a high-affinity PHR1 target cis-element to improve phosphorous uptake in Oryza sativa L.	In this work, we investigated the DNA binding affinity of the PHR1 ortholog OsPHR2 to its downstream target genes in Oryza sativa (rice)
OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR3	Integrative comparison of the role of the PHR1 subfamily in phosphate signaling and homeostasis in rice.	Here, we identified functional redundancy among three PHR1 orthologs in rice, OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3, using phylogenetic and mutation analysis
OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR3	Integrative comparison of the role of the PHR1 subfamily in phosphate signaling and homeostasis in rice.	OsPHR3, in conjunction with OsPHR1 and OsPHR2, function in transcriptional activation of most Pi starvation-induced (PSI) genes
OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR3	Integrative comparison of the role of the PHR1 subfamily in phosphate signaling and homeostasis in rice.	We propose that OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3 form a network and play diverse roles in regulating Pi signaling and homeostasis in rice
OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR4	Phosphate starvation induced OsPHR4 mediates Pi-signaling and homeostasis in rice.	The expression of OsPHR4 is positively regulated by OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3
OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR4	Phosphate starvation induced OsPHR4 mediates Pi-signaling and homeostasis in rice.	The nuclear located OsPHR4 can respectively interact with other three PHR1 subfamily members to regulate downstream Pi-starvation induced genes
OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR3	Overexpression of OsPHR3 improves growth traits and facilitates nitrogen use efficiency under low phosphate condition	), OsPHR3 is one of the four paralogs of PHR1, which acts as a central regulator of phosphate (Pi) homeostasis, as well being involved in N homeostasis
