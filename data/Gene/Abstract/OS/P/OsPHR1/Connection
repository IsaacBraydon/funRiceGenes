OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR2	OsPHR2 is involved in phosphate-starvation signaling and excessive phosphate accumulation in shoots of plants	 In this work, two OsPHR genes from rice (Oryza sativa) were isolated and designated as OsPHR1 and OsPHR2 based on amino acid sequence homology to AtPHR1| Our results showed that both OsPHR1 and OsPHR2 are involved in Pi-starvation signaling pathway by regulation of the expression of Pi-starvation-induced genes, whereas only OsPHR2 overexpression results in the excessive accumulation of Pi in shoots under Pi-sufficient conditions
OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR2	Role of OsPHR2 on phosphorus homeostasis and root hairs development in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Two PHR genes were isolated from rice and designated as OsPHR1 and OsPHR2 based on amino acid sequence homology to AtPHR1| Transgenic plants with overexpression and repression of OsPHR1 and OsPHR2, respectively, were used for investigation of roles of the genes in Pi-signaling pathway and Pi homeostasis under Pi-sufficient and deficient conditions
