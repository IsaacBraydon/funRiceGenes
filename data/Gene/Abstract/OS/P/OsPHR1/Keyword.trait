OsPHR1	homeostasis	Role of OsPHR2 on phosphorus homeostasis and root hairs development in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Transgenic plants with overexpression and repression of OsPHR1 and OsPHR2, respectively, were used for investigation of roles of the genes in Pi-signaling pathway and Pi homeostasis under Pi-sufficient and deficient conditions

OsPHR1	shoot	OsPHR2 is involved in phosphate-starvation signaling and excessive phosphate accumulation in shoots of plants	 Our results showed that both OsPHR1 and OsPHR2 are involved in Pi-starvation signaling pathway by regulation of the expression of Pi-starvation-induced genes, whereas only OsPHR2 overexpression results in the excessive accumulation of Pi in shoots under Pi-sufficient conditions
