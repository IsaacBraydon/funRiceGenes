OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b	RFL|APO2	Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.	 Further, we report reduced expression of auxin transporter genes OsPIN1 and OsPIN3 in the culm of RFL knockdown transgenic plants
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b	RFL|APO2	Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.	 These modified forms of RFL had only indirect effects on OsPIN1
