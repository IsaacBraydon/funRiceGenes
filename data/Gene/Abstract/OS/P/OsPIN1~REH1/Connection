OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.	Further, we report reduced expression of auxin transporter genes OsPIN1 and OsPIN3 in the culm of RFL knockdown transgenic plants
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.	These modified forms of RFL had only indirect effects on OsPIN1
IAA6|OsIAA6	OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	OsIAA6, a member of the rice Aux/IAA gene family, is involved in drought tolerance and tiller outgrowth.	A knock-down mutant of OsIAA6 showed abnormal tiller outgrowth, apparently due to the regulation of the auxin transporter OsPIN1 and the rice tillering inhibitor OsTB1
OsPID|OsPINOID	OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	PINOID regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin transport and interacts with MADS16 in rice.	 Our data demonstrate that OsPID interacts with OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b to regulate polar auxin transport as shown previously
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	OsPIN1c	Cadmium inhibits lateral root emergence in rice by disrupting OsPIN-mediated auxin distribution and the protective effect of OsHMA3	 Cadmium rapidly downregulated the expression of the auxin efflux transporter genes OsPIN1b, OsPIN1c and OsPIN9 in the stele and LPR
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	OsPIN9	Cadmium inhibits lateral root emergence in rice by disrupting OsPIN-mediated auxin distribution and the protective effect of OsHMA3	 Cadmium rapidly downregulated the expression of the auxin efflux transporter genes OsPIN1b, OsPIN1c and OsPIN9 in the stele and LPR
