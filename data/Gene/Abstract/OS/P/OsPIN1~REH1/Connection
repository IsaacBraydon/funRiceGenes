OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b	RFL|APO2	Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.	 Further, we report reduced expression of auxin transporter genes OsPIN1 and OsPIN3 in the culm of RFL knockdown transgenic plants
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b	RFL|APO2	Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.	 These modified forms of RFL had only indirect effects on OsPIN1
IAA6|OsIAA6	OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b	OsIAA6, a member of the rice Aux/IAA gene family, is involved in drought tolerance and tiller outgrowth.	 A knock-down mutant of OsIAA6 showed abnormal tiller outgrowth, apparently due to the regulation of the auxin transporter OsPIN1 and the rice tillering inhibitor OsTB1
