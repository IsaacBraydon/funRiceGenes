OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.	Further, we report reduced expression of auxin transporter genes OsPIN1 and OsPIN3 in the culm of RFL knockdown transgenic plants
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.	These modified forms of RFL had only indirect effects on OsPIN1
IAA6|OsIAA6	OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	OsIAA6, a member of the rice Aux/IAA gene family, is involved in drought tolerance and tiller outgrowth.	A knock-down mutant of OsIAA6 showed abnormal tiller outgrowth, apparently due to the regulation of the auxin transporter OsPIN1 and the rice tillering inhibitor OsTB1
OsPID|OsPINOID	OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	PINOID regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin transport and interacts with MADS16 in rice.	 Our data demonstrate that OsPID interacts with OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b to regulate polar auxin transport as shown previously
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	OsPIN1c	Cadmium inhibits lateral root emergence in rice by disrupting OsPIN-mediated auxin distribution and the protective effect of OsHMA3	 Cadmium rapidly downregulated the expression of the auxin efflux transporter genes OsPIN1b, OsPIN1c and OsPIN9 in the stele and LPR
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	OsPIN9	Cadmium inhibits lateral root emergence in rice by disrupting OsPIN-mediated auxin distribution and the protective effect of OsHMA3	 Cadmium rapidly downregulated the expression of the auxin efflux transporter genes OsPIN1b, OsPIN1c and OsPIN9 in the stele and LPR
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	PILS6b	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	PILS6b	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.	 Further analysis revealed that OsSPL14 directly binds to the promoter of PIN-FORMED 1b (OsPIN1b) and PIN-LIKE6b (PILS6b) to positively regulate their expression
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	PILS6b	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.	 OsPIN1b and PILS6b were highly expressed in axillary buds and proved to be involved in bud outgrowth
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	PILS6b	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.	 Loss of function of OsPIN1b or PILS6b increased the tiller number of rice
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	PILS6b	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.	 Taken together, our findings suggested that OsSPL14 can control axillary bud outgrowth and tiller number by activating the expression of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to fine-tune auxin transport in rice
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	TAP	Mutation of OsPIN1b by CRISPR/Cas9 Reveals a Role for Auxin Transport in Modulating Rice Architecture and Root Gravitropism.	 Moreover, ospin1b mutants displayed a curly root phenotype cultured with tap water regardless of lighting conditions, while nutrient solution culture could partially rescue the curly root phenotype in light and almost completely abolish this phenotype in darkness, indicating the involvement of the integration of light and nutrient signals in root gravitropism regulation
