BACKGROUND: Leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) represent the largest subfamily of putative RLKs in plants. Although several members in this subfamily have been identified, the studies about the relationships between LRR-RLKs and root development are still few. We previously identified a novel LRR-RLK in rice roots, and named it OsRPK1. METHODS: In this study, we first detected OsRPK1 kinase activity in vitro, and assessed its expression profile. We then investigated its biological function using transgenic rice plants over- and under-expressing OsRPK1. RESULTS: The OsRPK1 gene, which encodes a Ca(2+)-independent Ser/Thr kinase, was predominantly expressed in root tips, leaf blades, and undifferentiated suspension cells, and was markedly induced by treatment with auxin or ABA. Knockdown of OsRPK1 promoted the growth of transgenic rice plants, and increased plant height and tiller numbers. In contrast, over-expressing plants showed undeveloped adventitious roots, lateral roots, and a reduced root apical meristem. OsRPK1 over-expression also inhibited the expression of most auxin efflux carrier OsPIN genes, which was accompanied by changes in PAT and endogenous free IAA distribution in the leaves and roots. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicated that OsRPK1, a novel leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinase, affects the root system architecture by negatively regulating polar auxin transport in rice. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrated a common regulatory pathway of root system development in higher plants, which might be initiated by external stimuli via upstream receptor-like kinases and downstream carriers for polar auxin transport.
Plant Cell Physiol-2005-Xu-1674-81.pdf	A PIN1 family gene, OsPIN1, involved in auxin-dependent adventitious root emergence and tillering in rice	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, PR China.	Auxin transport affects a variety of important growth and developmental processes in plants, including the regulation of shoot and root branching. The asymmetrical localization of auxin influx and efflux carriers within the plasma membrane establishes the auxin gradient and facilitates its transport. REH1, a rice EIR1 (Arabidopsis ethylene insensitive root 1)-like gene, is a putative auxin efflux carrier. Phylogenetic analysis of 32 members of the PIN family, taken from across different species, showed that in terms of evolutionary relationship, OsPIN1 is closer to the PIN1 family than to the PIN2 family. It is, therefore, renamed as OsPIN1 in this study. OsPIN1 was expressed in the vascular tissues and root primordial in a manner similar to AtPIN1. Adventitious root emergence and development were significantly inhibited in the OsPIN1 RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants, which was similar to the phenotype of NPA (N-1-naphthylphalamic acid, an auxin-transport inhibitor)-treated wild-type plants. alpha-naphthylacetic acid (alpha-NAA) treatment was able to rescue the mutated phenotypes occurring in the RNAi plants. Overexpression or suppression of the OsPIN1 expression through a transgenic approach resulted in changes of tiller numbers and shoot/root ratio. Taken together, these data suggest that OsPIN1 plays an important role in auxin-dependent adventitious root emergence and tillering.
NA	OsPIN1b is Involved in Rice Seminal Root Elongation by Regulating Root Apical Meristem Activity in Response to Low Nitrogen and Phosphate.	2018	Sci Rep	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, and Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	The response of plant root development to nutrient deficiencies is critical for crop production. Auxin, nitric oxide (NO), and strigolactones (SLs) are important regulators of root growth under low-nitrogen and -phosphate (LN and LP) conditions. Polar auxin transport in plants, which is mainly dependent on auxin efflux protein PINs, creates local auxin maxima to form the basis for root initiation and elongation; however, the PIN genes that play an important role in LN- and LP-modulated root growth remain unclear. qRT-PCR analysis of OsPIN family genes showed that the expression of OsPIN1b is most abundant in root tip and is significantly downregulated by LN, LP, sodium nitroprusside (SNP, NO donor), and GR24 (analogue of SLs) treatments. Seminal roots in ospin1b mutants were shorter than those of the wild type; and the seminal root, [3H]IAA transport, and IAA concentration responses to LN, LP, SNP, and GR24 application were attenuated in ospin1b-1 mutants. pCYCB1;1::GUS expression was upregulated by LN, LP, SNP, and GR24 treatments in wild type, but not in the ospin1b-1 mutant, suggesting that OsPIN1b is involved in auxin transport and acts as a downstream mediator of NO and SLs to induce meristem activity in root tip in rice under LN and LP.
NA	Functional divergence of PIN1 paralogous genes in rice.	2019	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Auxin is an important phytohormone for plant growth and development, and PIN proteins are critical auxin efflux carriers. In Arabidopsis thaliana, PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) functions in inflorescence and root development. In rice (Oryza sativa L.), there are four PIN1 homologs (OsPIN1a - 1d), but their functions remain largely unexplored. Here, we created rice pin1a, pin1b, pin1c, pin1d, pin1a pin1b, and pin1c pin1d mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and used them to study the functions of the four OsPIN1 paralogs in rice. In wild-type rice, all four OsPIN1 genes were relatively highly expressed in the root compared to other tissues. Compared to the wild type, the OsPIN1 single mutants had no dramatic phenotypes, but the pin1a pin1b double mutant had shorter shoots and primary roots, fewer crown roots, reduced root gravitropic responsiveness, longer root hairs, and larger panicle branch angle. Furthermore, the pin1c pin1d double mutant showed no observable phenotype at the seedling stage, but showed naked, pin-shape inflorescences at flowering. These data suggest that OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b are involved in root, shoot and inflorescence development in rice, whereas OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d mainly function in panicle formation. Our study provides basic knowledge and materials for the study of auxin transport and signaling in rice.
NA	Cadmium inhibits lateral root emergence in rice by disrupting OsPIN-mediated auxin distribution and the protective effect of OsHMA3	2020	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Cadmium (Cd) strongly inhibits root growth, especially the formation of lateral roots (LRs). The mechanism of Cd inhibition on LR formation in rice (Oryza sativa) remains unclear. In this study, we found that LR emergence in rice was inhibited significantly by 1 ¦ÌM Cd and almost completely arrested by 5 ¦ÌM Cd. Cadmium suppressed both the formation and subsequent development of the lateral root primordium (LRP). By using transgenic rice expressing the auxin response reporters DR5::GUS and DR5rev::VENUS, we found that Cd markedly reduced the auxin levels in the stele and LRP. Cadmium rapidly downregulated the expression of the auxin efflux transporter genes OsPIN1b, OsPIN1c and OsPIN9 in the stele and LPR. The emergence of LRs in a rice cultivar with a null allele of OsHMA3 (Heavy Metal ATPase 3) was more sensitive to Cd than cultivars with functional alleles. Overexpression of functional OsHMA3 in rice greatly alleviated the inhibitory effect of Cd, but the protective effect of OsHMA3 was abolished by the auxin polar transport inhibitor 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid. The results suggest that Cd inhibits LR development in rice by disrupting OsPIN-mediated auxin distribution to LPR and OsHMA3 protects against Cd toxicity by sequestering Cd into the vacuoles.
NA	Mutation of OsPIN1b by CRISPR/Cas9 Reveals a Role for Auxin Transport in Modulating Rice Architecture and Root Gravitropism.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	College of Agriculture, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang 471000, China.	The distribution and content of auxin within plant tissues affect a variety of important growth and developmental processes. Polar auxin transport (PAT), mainly mediated by auxin influx and efflux transporters, plays a vital role in determining auxin maxima and gradients in plants. The auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED (PIN) family is one of the major protein families involved in PAT. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome possesses 12 OsPIN genes. However, the detailed functions of OsPIN genes involved in regulating the rice architecture and gravity response are less well understood. In the present study, OsPIN1b was disrupted by CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and its roles in modulating rice architecture and root gravitropism were investigated. Tissue-specific analysis showed that OsPIN1b was mainly expressed in roots, stems and sheaths at the seedling stage, and the transcript abundance was progressively decreased during the seedling stages. Expression of OsPIN1b could be quickly and greatly induced by NAA, indicating that OsPIN1b played a vital role in PAT. IAA homeostasis was disturbed in ospin1b mutants, as evidenced by the changed sensitivity of shoot and root to NAA and NPA treatment, respectively. Mutation of OsPIN1b resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes, including decreased growth of shoots and primary roots, reduced adventitious root number in rice seedlings, as well as shorter and narrower leaves, increased leaf angle, more tiller number and decreased plant height and panicle length at the late developmental stage. Moreover, ospin1b mutants displayed a curly root phenotype cultured with tap water regardless of lighting conditions, while nutrient solution culture could partially rescue the curly root phenotype in light and almost completely abolish this phenotype in darkness, indicating the involvement of the integration of light and nutrient signals in root gravitropism regulation. Additionally, amyloplast sedimentation was impaired in the peripheral tiers of the ospin1b root cap columella cell, while it was not the main contributor to the abnormal root gravitropism. These data suggest that OsPIN1b not only plays a vital role in regulating rice architecture but also functions in regulating root gravitropism by the integration of light and nutrient signals.
NA	Auxin Transporter OsPIN1b, a Novel Regulator of Leaf Inclination in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2023	Plants (Basel)	Key Laboratory of Herbage &amp; Endemic Crop Biology of Ministry of Education, Inner Mongolia Key Laboratory of Herbage &amp; Endemic Crop Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010030, China.	Leaf inclination is one of the most important components of the ideal architecture, which effects yield gain. Leaf inclination was shown that is mainly regulated by brassinosteroid (BR) and auxin signaling. Here, we reveal a novel regulator of leaf inclination, auxin transporter OsPIN1b. Two CRISPR-Cas9 homozygous mutants, ospin1b-1 and ospin1b-2, with smaller leaf inclination compared to the wild-type, Nipponbare (WT/NIP), while overexpression lines, OE-OsPIN1b-1 and OE-OsPIN1b-2 have opposite phenotype. Further cell biological observation showed that in the adaxial region, OE-OsPIN1b-1 has significant bulge compared to WT/NIP and ospin1b-1, indicating that the increase in the adaxial cell division results in the enlarging of the leaf inclination in OE-OsPIN1b-1. The OsPIN1b was localized on the plasma membrane, and the free IAA contents in the lamina joint of ospin1b mutants were significantly increased while they were decreased in OE-OsPIN1b lines, suggesting that OsPIN1b might action an auxin transporter such as AtPIN1 to alter IAA content and leaf inclination. Furthermore, the OsPIN1b expression was induced by exogenous epibrassinolide (24-eBL) and IAA, and ospin1b mutants are insensitive to BR or IAA treatment, indicating that the effecting leaf inclination is regulated by OsPIN1b. This study contributes a new gene resource for molecular design breeding of rice architecture.
