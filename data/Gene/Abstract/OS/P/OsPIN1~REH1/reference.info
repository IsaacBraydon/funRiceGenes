BACKGROUND: Leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) represent the largest subfamily of putative RLKs in plants. Although several members in this subfamily have been identified, the studies about the relationships between LRR-RLKs and root development are still few. We previously identified a novel LRR-RLK in rice roots, and named it OsRPK1. METHODS: In this study, we first detected OsRPK1 kinase activity in vitro, and assessed its expression profile. We then investigated its biological function using transgenic rice plants over- and under-expressing OsRPK1. RESULTS: The OsRPK1 gene, which encodes a Ca(2+)-independent Ser/Thr kinase, was predominantly expressed in root tips, leaf blades, and undifferentiated suspension cells, and was markedly induced by treatment with auxin or ABA. Knockdown of OsRPK1 promoted the growth of transgenic rice plants, and increased plant height and tiller numbers. In contrast, over-expressing plants showed undeveloped adventitious roots, lateral roots, and a reduced root apical meristem. OsRPK1 over-expression also inhibited the expression of most auxin efflux carrier OsPIN genes, which was accompanied by changes in PAT and endogenous free IAA distribution in the leaves and roots. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicated that OsRPK1, a novel leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinase, affects the root system architecture by negatively regulating polar auxin transport in rice. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrated a common regulatory pathway of root system development in higher plants, which might be initiated by external stimuli via upstream receptor-like kinases and downstream carriers for polar auxin transport.
Plant Cell Physiol-2005-Xu-1674-81.pdf	A PIN1 family gene, OsPIN1, involved in auxin-dependent adventitious root emergence and tillering in rice	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, PR China.	Auxin transport affects a variety of important growth and developmental processes in plants, including the regulation of shoot and root branching. The asymmetrical localization of auxin influx and efflux carriers within the plasma membrane establishes the auxin gradient and facilitates its transport. REH1, a rice EIR1 (Arabidopsis ethylene insensitive root 1)-like gene, is a putative auxin efflux carrier. Phylogenetic analysis of 32 members of the PIN family, taken from across different species, showed that in terms of evolutionary relationship, OsPIN1 is closer to the PIN1 family than to the PIN2 family. It is, therefore, renamed as OsPIN1 in this study. OsPIN1 was expressed in the vascular tissues and root primordial in a manner similar to AtPIN1. Adventitious root emergence and development were significantly inhibited in the OsPIN1 RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants, which was similar to the phenotype of NPA (N-1-naphthylphalamic acid, an auxin-transport inhibitor)-treated wild-type plants. alpha-naphthylacetic acid (alpha-NAA) treatment was able to rescue the mutated phenotypes occurring in the RNAi plants. Overexpression or suppression of the OsPIN1 expression through a transgenic approach resulted in changes of tiller numbers and shoot/root ratio. Taken together, these data suggest that OsPIN1 plays an important role in auxin-dependent adventitious root emergence and tillering.
NA	OsPIN1b is Involved in Rice Seminal Root Elongation by Regulating Root Apical Meristem Activity in Response to Low Nitrogen and Phosphate.	2018	Sci Rep	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, and Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	The response of plant root development to nutrient deficiencies is critical for crop production. Auxin, nitric oxide (NO), and strigolactones (SLs) are important regulators of root growth under low-nitrogen and -phosphate (LN and LP) conditions. Polar auxin transport in plants, which is mainly dependent on auxin efflux protein PINs, creates local auxin maxima to form the basis for root initiation and elongation; however, the PIN genes that play an important role in LN- and LP-modulated root growth remain unclear. qRT-PCR analysis of OsPIN family genes showed that the expression of OsPIN1b is most abundant in root tip and is significantly downregulated by LN, LP, sodium nitroprusside (SNP, NO donor), and GR24 (analogue of SLs) treatments. Seminal roots in ospin1b mutants were shorter than those of the wild type; and the seminal root, [3H]IAA transport, and IAA concentration responses to LN, LP, SNP, and GR24 application were attenuated in ospin1b-1 mutants. pCYCB1;1::GUS expression was upregulated by LN, LP, SNP, and GR24 treatments in wild type, but not in the ospin1b-1 mutant, suggesting that OsPIN1b is involved in auxin transport and acts as a downstream mediator of NO and SLs to induce meristem activity in root tip in rice under LN and LP.
