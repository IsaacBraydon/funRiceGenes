OsPNH1	leaf	OsPNH1regulates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem in rice	 Around the SAM, OsPNH1 was strongly expressed in developing leaf primordia, specifically in the presumptive vascular domains, developing vascular tissues, a few cell-layers of the adaxial region, and future bundle sheath extension cells| On the basis of these observations, we propose that OsPNH1 functions not only in SAM maintenance as previously thought, but also in leaf formation through vascular development|OsPNH1regulates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem in rice
