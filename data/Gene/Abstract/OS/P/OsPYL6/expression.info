OsPYL6	 Here we report functional validation of ABA receptor OsPYL6 by constitutive and stress inducible overexpression, and RNAi silencing in an indica rice cv |  Overexpression of OsPYL6 conferred ABA hypersensitivity during germination and promoted total root length |  Both overexpression and RNAi silencing of OsPYL6 resulted in enhanced accumulation of ABA in seedlings under non-stress, at least, in part through upregulation of different NCED genes |  Analysis of drought tolerance of OsPYL6 transgenics and WT plants showed that OsPYL6 overexpression enhanced the expression of stress responsive genes and dehydration tolerance |  These results showed that OsPYL6 is a key regulator of plant development and drought tolerance, and fine-tuning of its expression is critical for improving yield and stress tolerance in rice	 Here we report functional validation of ABA receptor OsPYL6 by constitutive and stress inducible overexpression, and RNAi silencing in an indica rice cv |  Overexpression of OsPYL6 conferred ABA hypersensitivity during germination and promoted total root length |  Both overexpression and RNAi silencing of OsPYL6 resulted in enhanced accumulation of ABA in seedlings under non-stress, at least, in part through upregulation of different NCED genes |  Analysis of drought tolerance of OsPYL6 transgenics and WT plants showed that OsPYL6 overexpression enhanced the expression of stress responsive genes and dehydration tolerance	 Here we report functional validation of ABA receptor OsPYL6 by constitutive and stress inducible overexpression, and RNAi silencing in an indica rice cv |  Both overexpression and RNAi silencing of OsPYL6 resulted in enhanced accumulation of ABA in seedlings under non-stress, at least, in part through upregulation of different NCED genes |  RNAi silencing of OsPYL6 also significantly reduced the grain yield under drought
