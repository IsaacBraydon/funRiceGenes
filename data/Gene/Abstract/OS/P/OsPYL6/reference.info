NA	ABA receptor OsPYL6 confers drought tolerance to indica rice through dehydration avoidance and tolerance mechanisms	2020	J Exp Bot	Division of Plant physiology, ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, India.	ABA is a key regulator of plant development and stress tolerance. Here we report functional validation of ABA receptor OsPYL6 by constitutive and stress inducible overexpression, and RNAi silencing in an indica rice cv. Pusa Sugandh 2. Overexpression of OsPYL6 conferred ABA hypersensitivity during germination and promoted total root length. Both overexpression and RNAi silencing of OsPYL6 resulted in enhanced accumulation of ABA in seedlings under non-stress, at least, in part through upregulation of different NCED genes. This suggests that PYL6 expression is crucial for ABA homeostasis. Analysis of drought tolerance of OsPYL6 transgenics and WT plants showed that OsPYL6 overexpression enhanced the expression of stress responsive genes and dehydration tolerance. PAtRD29A::PYL6 transgenics also exhibited about 25% lesser whole plant transpiration as compared with WT plants under drought confirming its role in activation of dehydration avoidance mechanisms. However, PYL6 overexpression significantly reduced grain yield under non-stress conditions due to reduction in height, biomass, panicle branching and spikelet fertility. RNAi silencing of OsPYL6 also significantly reduced the grain yield under drought. These results showed that OsPYL6 is a key regulator of plant development and drought tolerance, and fine-tuning of its expression is critical for improving yield and stress tolerance in rice.
