Symbol	Expression
OsPPR676	 Compared with other chloroplast-rich tissues, OsPPR676 was only weakly expressed in anther, but in the Mei and YM stages of pollen development, its expression was relatively strong in the tapetum
OsPPR676|OsATP4	 Expression of the edited rps8 isoform in transgenic osatp4 mutants complemented the cold-sensitive phenotype, indicating that a rps8 expression defect accounts for the cold sensitivity
