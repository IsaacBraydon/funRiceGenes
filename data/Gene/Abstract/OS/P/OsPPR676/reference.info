NA	A Plastid-Localized Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein is Required for Both Pollen Development and Plant Growth in Rice	2017	Sci Rep	Institute of Crop Science, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang  University, Hangzhou, 310058, P. R. China.	Several mitochondrial-targeted pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins involved in pollen development have been reported to be fertility restorer (Rf) proteins.  However, the roles of plastid-localized PPR proteins in plant male reproduction are poorly defined. Here, we described a plastid-localized PPR-SMR protein, OsPPR676, which is required for plant growth and pollen development in rice. In this study, OsPPR676 was confirmed to be an interacted protein with Osj10gBTF3, β-subunit of nascent polypeptide-associated complex (β-NAC), by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, indicating that both proteins are probably involved in the same regulatory pathway of pollen development. Compared with other chloroplast-rich tissues, OsPPR676 was only weakly expressed in anther, but in the Mei and YM stages of pollen development, its expression was relatively strong in the tapetum. Disruption of OsPPR676 resulted in growth retardation of plants and partial sterility of pollens. Phenotypic analysis of different osppr676 mutant lines implied that the SMR domain was not essential for the function of OsPPR676. We further demonstrated that OsPPR676 is essential for production of plastid atpB subunit, and then plays crucial roles in biosynthesis  of fatty acids, carbohydrates, and other organic matters via affecting activity of ATP synthase.
NA	The PPR-SMR protein ATP4 is required for editing the chloroplast rps8 mRNA in rice and maize	2020	Plant Physiol	Huazhong Agricultural University CITY: Wuhan STATE: Hubei POSTAL_CODE: 430070 China	Chloroplast gene expression involves the participation of hundreds of pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) RNA binding proteins, and proteins in the PLS subfamily typically specify sites of RNA editing, whereas those in the P-subfamily typically stabilize RNA, activate translation, or promote intron splicing. Several P-type PPR proteins include a small MutS-related (SMR) domain, but the biochemical contribution of the SMR domain remains enigmatic. Here, we describe a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, osatp4, lacking the ortholog of ATP4, a PPR-SMR protein in maize (Zea mays). osatp4 mutants were chlorotic and had a plastid-ribosome deficiency when grown in the cold. Like maize ATP4, OsATP4 was required for the accumulation of dicistronic rpl16-rpl14 transcripts. Surprisingly, OsATP4 was also required for the editing of a specific nucleotide in the ribosomal protein S8 transcripts, rps8, and this function was conserved in maize. By contrast, rps8 RNA was edited normally in maize PROTON gradient regulation3 mutant, pgr3, which also lack rpl16-rpl14 transcripts, indicating that the editing defect in atp4 mutants is not a secondary effect of altered rpl16-rpl14 RNA metabolism. Expression of the edited rps8 isoform in transgenic osatp4 mutants complemented the cold-sensitive phenotype, indicating that a rps8 expression defect accounts for the cold sensitivity. We suggest that ATP4 stimulates rps8 editing by facilitating access of a previously characterized PLS-type RNA editing factor to its cognate cis-element upstream of the edited nucleotide.
