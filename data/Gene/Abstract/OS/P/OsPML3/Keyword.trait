OsPML3	root	The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.	 OsPML3 was highly expressed in rapidly developing tissues such as young leaves, root caps, lateral root primordia, and young anthers
OsPML3	root	The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.	 At the vegetative stage, we observed necrotic root tips and lateral root primordia, and chlorotic young leaves in OsPML3 knockout lines under Mn-deficient conditions
OsPML3	growth	The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.	 Heterologous expression of OsPML3 restored the growth of Mn uptake-defective yeast strain Î”smf1 under Mn-limited conditions
OsPML3	fertility	The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.	 OsPML3 knockout lines grown in the paddy field had reduced pollen fertility
OsPML3	pollen	The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.	 OsPML3 knockout lines grown in the paddy field had reduced pollen fertility
OsPML3	vegetative	The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.	 At the vegetative stage, we observed necrotic root tips and lateral root primordia, and chlorotic young leaves in OsPML3 knockout lines under Mn-deficient conditions
OsPML3	homeostasis	The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.	The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.
OsPML3	homeostasis	The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.	 Collectively, our results indicate that OsPML3 maintains Mn homeostasis in the Golgi apparatus of the rapidly developing rice tissues, and regulates the deposition of cell wall polysaccharides and late-stage Golgi N-glycosylation, especially biosynthesis of the Lewis A structure
OsPML3	transporter	The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.	The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.
OsPML3	cell wall	The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.	 Additionally, knocking out OsPML3 reduced the deposition of cell wall polysaccharides and the content of Lea (Lewis A structure)-containing N-glycan in roots and young leaves
OsPML3	cell wall	The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.	 Collectively, our results indicate that OsPML3 maintains Mn homeostasis in the Golgi apparatus of the rapidly developing rice tissues, and regulates the deposition of cell wall polysaccharides and late-stage Golgi N-glycosylation, especially biosynthesis of the Lewis A structure
OsPML3	manganese	The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.	The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.
OsPML3	lateral root	The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.	 OsPML3 was highly expressed in rapidly developing tissues such as young leaves, root caps, lateral root primordia, and young anthers
OsPML3	lateral root	The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.	 At the vegetative stage, we observed necrotic root tips and lateral root primordia, and chlorotic young leaves in OsPML3 knockout lines under Mn-deficient conditions
OsPML3	Pollen Fertility	The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.	 OsPML3 knockout lines grown in the paddy field had reduced pollen fertility
