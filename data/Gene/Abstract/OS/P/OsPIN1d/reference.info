NA	Functional divergence of PIN1 paralogous genes in rice.	2019	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Auxin is an important phytohormone for plant growth and development, and PIN proteins are critical auxin efflux carriers. In Arabidopsis thaliana, PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) functions in inflorescence and root development. In rice (Oryza sativa L.), there are four PIN1 homologs (OsPIN1a - 1d), but their functions remain largely unexplored. Here, we created rice pin1a, pin1b, pin1c, pin1d, pin1a pin1b, and pin1c pin1d mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and used them to study the functions of the four OsPIN1 paralogs in rice. In wild-type rice, all four OsPIN1 genes were relatively highly expressed in the root compared to other tissues. Compared to the wild type, the OsPIN1 single mutants had no dramatic phenotypes, but the pin1a pin1b double mutant had shorter shoots and primary roots, fewer crown roots, reduced root gravitropic responsiveness, longer root hairs, and larger panicle branch angle. Furthermore, the pin1c pin1d double mutant showed no observable phenotype at the seedling stage, but showed naked, pin-shape inflorescences at flowering. These data suggest that OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b are involved in root, shoot and inflorescence development in rice, whereas OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d mainly function in panicle formation. Our study provides basic knowledge and materials for the study of auxin transport and signaling in rice.
NA	The Amino Acid Transporter OsAAP4 Contributes to Rice Tillering and Grain Yield by Regulating Neutral Amino Acid Allocation through Two Splicing Variants	2021	Rice (N Y)	Key Laboratory of Plant Resource Conservation and Germplasm Innovation in Mountainous Region (Ministry of Education), College of Agricultural Sciences, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, China. zmfang@gzu.edu.cn.	Background: Amino acids, which are transported by amino acid transporters, are the major forms of organic nitrogen utilized by higher plants. Among the 19 Amino Acid Permease transporters (AAPs) in rice, only a small number of these genes have been reported to influence rice growth and development. However, whether other OsAAPs are responsible for rice growth and development is unclear.  Results: In this study, we demonstrate that OsAAP4 promoter sequences are divergent between Indica and Japonica, with higher expression in the former, which produces more tillers and higher grain yield than does Japonica. Overexpression of two different splicing variants of OsAAP4 in Japonica ZH11 significantly increased rice tillering and grain yield as result of enhancing the neutral amino acid concentrations of Val, Pro, Thr and Leu. OsAAP4 RNA interference (RNAi) and mutant lines displayed opposite trends compared with overexpresing (OE) lines. In addition, exogenous Val or Pro at 0.5 mM significantly promoted the bud outgrowth of lines overexpressing an OsAAP4a splicing variant compared with ZH11, and exogenous Val or Pro at 2.0 mM significantly enhanced the bud outgrowth of lines overexpressing splicing variant OsAAP4b compared with ZH11. Of note, the results of a protoplast amino acid-uptake assay showed that Val or Pro at different concentrations was specifically transported and accumulated in these overexpressing lines. Transcriptome analysis further demonstrated that OsAAP4 may affect nitrogen transport and metabolism, and auxin, cytokinin signaling in regulating rice tillering.  Conclusion: Our results suggested that OsAAP4 contributes to rice tiller and grain yield by regulating neutral amino acid allocation through two different splicing variants and that OsAAP4 might have potential applications in rice breeding.
