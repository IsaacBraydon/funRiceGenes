OsPIN1c	OsPIN1d	Auxin Efflux Transporters OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d Function Redundantly in Regulating Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Panicle Development.	 In this study, we investigated the expression and function of OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d in the japonica rice variety (Nipponbare) using gene knockout and high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis
OsPIN1c	OsPIN1d	Auxin Efflux Transporters OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d Function Redundantly in Regulating Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Panicle Development.	 Results showed that OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d were mainly expressed in young panicles and exhibited a redundant function
OsPIN1c	OsPIN1d	Auxin Efflux Transporters OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d Function Redundantly in Regulating Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Panicle Development.	 Furthermore, OsPIN1c or OsPIN1d loss-of-function mutants presented a mild phenotype compared with the wild type
OsPIN1c	OsPIN1d	Auxin Efflux Transporters OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d Function Redundantly in Regulating Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Panicle Development.	 In addition to significantly decreased plant height and tiller number, panicle development was severely disrupted in double mutant lines of OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d
OsPIN1c	OsPIN1d	Auxin Efflux Transporters OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d Function Redundantly in Regulating Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Panicle Development.	 Additionally, several critical regulators of reproductive development, such as OsPID, LAX1, OsMADS1, and OsSPL14/IPA1, were differentially expressed in ospin1c-1 ospin1d-1, supporting the hypothesis that OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d are involved in regulating panicle development

Additionally, several critical regulators of reproductive development, such as OsPID, LAX1, OsMADS1, and OsSPL14/IPA1, were differentially expressed in ospin1c-1 ospin1d-1, supporting the hypothesis that OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d are involved in regulating panicle development
OsPID|OsPINOID	OsPIN1d	PINOID and PIN-FORMED Paralogous Genes Are Required for Leaf Morphogenesis in Rice.	 In this study, we found that PINOID (OsPID) and two Sister-of-PIN1s, termed PIN-FORMED1c (OsPIN1c) and OsPIN1d, are necessary for rice leaf development
