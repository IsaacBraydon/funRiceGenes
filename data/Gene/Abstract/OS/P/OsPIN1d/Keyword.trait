OsPIN1d	shoot	Functional divergence of PIN1 paralogous genes in rice.	 These data suggest that OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b are involved in root, shoot and inflorescence development in rice, whereas OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d mainly function in panicle formation
OsPIN1d	panicle	Functional divergence of PIN1 paralogous genes in rice.	 These data suggest that OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b are involved in root, shoot and inflorescence development in rice, whereas OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d mainly function in panicle formation
