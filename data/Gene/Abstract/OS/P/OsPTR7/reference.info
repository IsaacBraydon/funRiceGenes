NA	OsPTR7 (OsNPF8.1), a Putative Peptide Transporter in Rice, is Involved in Dimethylarsenate Accumulation in Rice Grain.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice (Oryza sativa) is a major dietary source of arsenic (As) for the population consuming rice as their staple food. Rice grain contains both inorganic As and methylated As species, especially dimethyarsinate (DMA). DMA is highly mobile in long-distance translocation in plants, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In the present study, we showed that OsPTR7 (OsNPF8.1), a putative peptide transporter in rice, was permeable to DMA in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Transient expression of the OsPTR7-green fluorescent protein (GFP) in tobacco protoplasts showed that OsPTR7 was localized in the cell plasma membrane. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that OsPTR7 was more highly expressed in the shoots than in the roots at the seedling stage. At the flowering and grain-filling stage, the OsPTR7 transcript was abundant in the leaves, node I and roots. Knockout or knockdown mutants of OsPTR7 had significantly decreased root to shoot translocation of DMA compared with wild-type plants and accumulated less As in the brown rice. In field-grown plants, DMA accounted for 35% of the total As in the brown rice of wild-type plants but was undetectable in the knockout mutant. Our study demonstrates that OsPTR7 is involved in the long-distance translocation of DMA and contributes to the accumulation of DMA in rice grain.
NA	Overexpression of OsERF83, a Vascular Tissue-Specific Transcription Factor Gene, Confers Drought Tolerance in Rice	2021	Int J Mol Sci	Crop Biotechnology Institute, GreenBio Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Pyeongchang 25354, Korea.	Abiotic stresses severely affect plant growth and productivity. To cope with abiotic stresses, plants have evolved tolerance mechanisms that are tightly regulated by reprogramming transcription factors (TFs). APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF) transcription factors are known to play an important role in various abiotic stresses. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms remains incomplete. In this study, we identified the role of OsERF83, a member of the AP2/ERF transcription factor family, in response to drought stress. OsERF83 is a transcription factor localized to the nucleus and induced in response to various abiotic stresses, such as drought and abscisic acid (ABA). Overexpression of OsERF83 in transgenic plants (OsERF83OX) significantly increased drought tolerance, with higher photochemical efficiency in rice. OsERF83OX was also associated with growth retardation, with reduced grain yields under normal growth conditions. OsERF83 is predominantly expressed in the vascular tissue of all organs. Transcriptome analysis revealed that OsERF83 regulates drought response genes, which are related to the transporter (OsNPF8.10, OsNPF8.17, OsLH1), lignin biosynthesis (OsLAC17, OsLAC10, CAD8D), terpenoid synthesis (OsTPS33, OsTPS14, OsTPS3), cytochrome P450 family (Oscyp71Z4, CYP76M10), and abiotic stress-related genes (OsSAP, OsLEA14, PCC13-62). OsERF83 also up-regulates biotic stress-associated genes, including PATHOGENESIS-RELATED PROTEIN (PR), WALL-ASSOCIATED KINASE (WAK), CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE PROTEIN E1 (CslE1), and LYSM RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (RLK) genes. Our results provide new insight into the multiple roles of OsERF83 in the cross-talk between abiotic and biotic stress signaling pathways.
