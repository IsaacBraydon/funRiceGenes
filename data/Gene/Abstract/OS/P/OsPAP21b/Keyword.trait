OsPAP21b	temperature	Improvement of Phosphate Acquisition and Utilization by a Secretory Purple Acid Phosphatase (OsPAP21b) in Rice.	Biochemically, OsPAP21b showed hydrolysis of several organophosphates at acidic pH and possessed sufficient thermostability befitting for high temperature rice ecosystems with acidic soils
OsPAP21b	Pi	Improvement of Phosphate Acquisition and Utilization by a Secretory Purple Acid Phosphatase (OsPAP21b) in Rice.	Interestingly, OsPAP21b was revealed to be a secretory PAP and encodes a distinguishable major APase (acid phosphatase) isoform under low Pi in roots
OsPAP21b	Pi	Improvement of Phosphate Acquisition and Utilization by a Secretory Purple Acid Phosphatase (OsPAP21b) in Rice.	In light of these evidences, present study strongly proposes OsPAP21b as a useful candidate for improving Pi acquisition and utilization in rice
