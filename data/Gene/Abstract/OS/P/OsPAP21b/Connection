OsPAP21b	OsPHR2	Improvement of Phosphate Acquisition and Utilization by a Secretory Purple Acid Phosphatase (OsPAP21b) in Rice.	OsPAP21b was found to be under the transcriptional control of OsPHR2 and strictly regulated by plant Pi-status at both transcript and protein levels
OsPAP21b	OsPIE1	A phosphate-starvation induced RING-type E3 ligase maintains phosphate homeostasis partially through OsSPX2 in rice.	 Under Pi-sufficient condition, overexpression of OsPIE1 upregulated the expression of OsPT2, OsPT3, OsPT10 and OsPAP21b, resulting in Pi accumulation and acid phosphatases (APases) induction in roots
