OsPIL12	OsPRR1|OsTOC1	Characterization of a Set of Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like bHLH Proteins inOryza sativa	Some of them (OsPIL11, OsPIL12, and OsPIL13) showed the ability to interact with the putative OsPRR1 (PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 1) clock component, as far as the results of yeast two-hybrid assays were concerned

OsPIL12	OsTCP11	Genome-wide binding analysis of transcription factor Rice Indeterminate 1 reveals a complex network controlling rice floral transition.	 Interestingly, CACGTG and GTGGGCCC, two previously uncharacterized indirect binding motifs, were enriched through the interactions of RID1 with the novel flowering-promoting proteins OsPIL12 and OsTCP11, respectively
