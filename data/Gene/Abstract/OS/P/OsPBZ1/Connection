OsNIN-like2|OsNLP2	OsPBZ1	The NIN-Like Protein OsNLP2 Negatively Regulates Ferroptotic Cell Death and Immune Responses to Magnaporthe oryzae in Rice.	 The loss-of-function of OsNLP2 triggered the expression of defense-related genes including OsPBZ1, OsPIP-3A, OsWRKY104, and OsRbohB in ΔOsnlp2 mutants
