OsPDF1B	root	Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts	OsPDF1A is more strongly expressed in the roots, while OsPDF1B is expressed at higher levels in mature leaves
OsPDF1B	chloroplast	Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts	Transient expression of PDF-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in the protoplasts demonstrates that, unlike OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B is localized in both the chloroplasts and the mitochondria
OsPDF1B	chloroplast	Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts	Based on these results, we conclude that OsPDF1B is essential for the development of chloroplast and perhaps mitochondria
OsPDF1B	mitochondria	Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts	Transient expression of PDF-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in the protoplasts demonstrates that, unlike OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B is localized in both the chloroplasts and the mitochondria
OsPDF1B	mitochondria	Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts	Based on these results, we conclude that OsPDF1B is essential for the development of chloroplast and perhaps mitochondria
