OsPAA1	OsPAA2	OsPAA2, a distinct α1 subunit gene for the 20S proteasome in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 The expression pattern of the OsPAA2 gene was different from that of another α1 gene, OsPAA1
OsPAA1	OsPAA2	OsPAA2, a distinct α1 subunit gene for the 20S proteasome in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 These data suggest that OsPAA2 might play a distinct role from that of OsPAA1 in the 20S proteasome complex
