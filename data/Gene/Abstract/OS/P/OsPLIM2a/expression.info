OsPLIM2a	 Analysis of both OsPLIM2a and OsPLIM2c promoter fused to GUS reporter revealed that both promoters directed strong and specific GUS expression in pollens |  Transient expression of OsPLIM2a-GFP and OsPLIM2c-GFP in tobacco leaves showed that OsPLIM2a and OsPLIM2c could bind to actin filaments, which is consistent with other plant LIM proteins with actin-binding property
