OsPYL|RCAR5	 In this study, we showed that overexpression of the rice ABA receptor OsPYL/RCAR3 reduces the growth retardation observed in plants exposed to osmotic stress |  By contrast, overexpression of the OsPYL/RCAR3-interacting protein OsPP2C09 rendered plant growth more sensitive to osmotic stress	 In this study, we showed that overexpression of the rice ABA receptor OsPYL/RCAR3 reduces the growth retardation observed in plants exposed to osmotic stress |  By contrast, overexpression of the OsPYL/RCAR3-interacting protein OsPP2C09 rendered plant growth more sensitive to osmotic stress
