00069401-file001.pdf	A rice orthologue of the ABA receptor, OsPYL/RCAR5, is a positive regulator of the ABA signal transduction pathway in seed germination and early seedling growth	2012	J Exp Bot	Department of Bio-crop development, National Academy of Agricultural Science, Rural Development Administration, Suwon, 441-707, Korea.	Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone that positively regulates seed dormancy and stress tolerance. PYL/RCARs were identified an intracellular ABA receptors regulating ABA-dependent gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, their function in monocot species has not been characterized yet. Herein, it is demonstrated that PYL/RCAR orthologues in Oryza sativa function as a positive regulator of the ABA signal transduction pathway. Transgenic rice plants expressing OsPYL/RCAR5, a PYL/RCAR orthologue of rice, were found to be hypersensitive to ABA during seed germination and early seedling growth. A rice ABA signalling unit composed of OsPYL/RCAR5, OsPP2C30, SAPK2, and OREB1 for ABA-dependent gene regulation was further identified, via interaction assays and a transient gene expression assay. Thus, a core signalling unit for ABA-responsive gene expression modulating seed germination and early seedling growth in rice has been unravelled. This study provides substantial contributions toward understanding the ABA signal transduction pathway in rice.
ert397.pdf	Overexpression of PYL5 in rice enhances drought tolerance, inhibits growth, and modulates gene expression	2014	J Exp Bot	Molecular Breeding Division, National Academy of Agricultural Science, RDA, Suwon 441-707, Republic of Korea.	Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone that plays important roles in the regulation of seed dormancy and adaptation to abiotic stresses. Previous work identified OsPYL/RCARs as functional ABA receptors regulating ABA-dependent gene expression in Oryza sativa. OsPYL/RCARs thus are considered to be good candidate genes for improvement of abiotic stress tolerance in crops. This work demonstrates that the cytosolic ABA receptor OsPYL/RCAR5 in O. sativa functions as a positive regulator of abiotic stress-responsive gene expression. The constitutive expression of OsPYL/RCAR5 in rice driven by the Zea mays ubiquitin promoter induced the expression of many stress-responsive genes even under normal growth conditions and resulted in improved drought and salt stress tolerance in rice. However, it slightly reduced plant height under paddy field conditions and severely reduced total seed yield. This suggests that, although exogenous expression of OsPYL/RCAR5 is able to improve abiotic stress tolerance in rice, fine regulation of its expression will be required to avoid deleterious effects on agricultural traits.
NA	OsPP2C09 Is a Bifunctional Regulator in Both ABA-Dependent and Independent Abiotic Stress Signaling Pathways	2021	Int J Mol Sci	Division of Metabolic Engineering, National Institute of Agricultural Sciences, RDA, Jeonju-si 54874, Korea.	Clade A Type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2CAs) negatively regulate abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and have diverse functions in plant development and in response to various stresses. In this study, we showed that overexpression of the rice ABA receptor OsPYL/RCAR3 reduces the growth retardation observed in plants exposed to osmotic stress. By contrast, overexpression of the OsPYL/RCAR3-interacting protein OsPP2C09 rendered plant growth more sensitive to osmotic stress. We tested whether OsPP2CAs activate an ABA-independent signaling cascade by transfecting rice protoplasts with luciferase reporters containing the drought-responsive element (DRE) or ABA-responsive element (ABRE). We observed that OsPP2CAs activated gene expression via the cis-acting drought-responsive element. In agreement with this observation, transcriptome analysis of plants overexpressing OsPP2C09 indicated that OsPP2C09 induces the expression of genes whose promoters contain DREs. Further analysis showed that OsPP2C09 interacts with DRE-binding (DREB) transcription factors and activates reporters containing DRE. We conclude that, through activating DRE-containing promoters, OsPP2C09 positively regulates the drought response regulon and activates an ABA-independent signaling pathway.
NA	Conserved Imprinted Genes between Intra-Subspecies and Inter-Subspecies Are Involved in Energy Metabolism and Seed Development in Rice	2020	Int J Mol Sci	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon in which a subset of genes express dependent on the origin of their parents. In plants, it is unclear whether imprinted genes are conserved between subspecies in rice. Here we identified imprinted genes from embryo and endosperm 5-7 days after pollination from three pairs of reciprocal hybrids, including inter-subspecies, japonica intra-subspecies, and indica intra-subspecies reciprocal hybrids. A total of 914 imprinted genes, including 546 in inter-subspecies hybrids, 211 in japonica intra-subspecies hybrids, and 286 in indica intra-subspecies hybrids. In general, the number of maternally expressed genes (MEGs) is more than paternally expressed genes (PEGs). Moreover, imprinted genes tend to be in mini clusters. The number of shared genes by R9N (reciprocal crosses between 9311 and Nipponbare) and R9Z (reciprocal crosses between 9311 and Zhenshan 97), R9N and RZN (reciprocal crosses between Zhonghua11 and Nipponbare), R9Z and RZN was 72, 46, and 16. These genes frequently involved in energy metabolism and seed development. Five imprinted genes (Os01g0151700, Os07g0103100, Os10g0340600, Os11g0679700, and Os12g0632800) are commonly detected in all three pairs of reciprocal hybrids and were validated by RT-PCR sequencing. Gene editing of two imprinted genes revealed that both genes conferred grain filling. Moreover, 15 and 27 imprinted genes with diverse functions in rice were shared with Arabidopsis and maize, respectively. This study provided valuable resources for identification of imprinting genes in rice or even in cereals.
