NA	Evolutionarily Distinct BAHD N-Acyltransferases Are Responsible for Natural Variation of Aromatic Amine Conjugates in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Phenolamides (PAs) are specialized (secondary) metabolites mainly synthesized by BAHD N-acyltransferases. Here, we report metabolic profiling coupled with association and linkage mapping of 11 PAs in rice (Oryza sativa). We identified 22 loci affecting PAs in leaves and 16 loci affecting PAs in seeds. We identified eight BAHD N-acyltransferases located on five chromosomes with diverse specificities, including four aromatic amine N-acyltransferases. We show that genetic variation in PAs is determined, at least in part, by allelic variation in the tissue specificity of expression of the BAHD genes responsible for their biosynthesis. Tryptamine hydroxycinnamoyl transferase 1/2 (Os-THT1/2) and tryptamine benzoyl transferase 1/2 (Os-TBT1/2) were found to be bifunctional tryptamine/tyramine N-acyltransferases. The specificity of Os-THT1 and Os-TBT1 for agmatine involved four tandem arginine residues, which have not been identified as specificity determinants for other plant BAHD transferases, illustrating the versatility of plant BAHD transferases in acquiring new acyl acceptor specificities. With phylogenetic analysis, we identified both divergent and convergent evolution of N-acyltransferases in plants, and we suggest that the BAHD family of tryptamine/tyramine N-acyltransferases evolved conservatively in monocots, especially in Gramineae. Our work demonstrates that omics-assisted gene-to-metabolite analysis provides a useful tool for bulk gene identification and crop genetic improvement.
NA	Trait variations and expression profiling of OsPHT1 gene family at the early growth-stages under phosphorus-limited conditions	2021	Sci Rep	Crop Improvement Division, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)-National Rice Research Institute (NRRI), Cuttack, Odisha, 753006, India. anandanau@yahoo.com.	To better understand the early response of genotypes to limited-phosphorus (P) conditions and the role of the phosphate transporter OsPHT1 gene family in the presence of PSTOL1, it is essential to characterize the level of tolerance in rice under limited-P conditions. In the present experiment, six rice genotypes were studied in three-way interactions [genotype (G) ¡Á phosphorus (P) ¡Á duration (D)] by comparing them at two instances (14 d and 28 d) under seven different concentrations of P (0.5<U+2012>10.0 ppm) in a hydroponic system. Trait differences and interactions of these traits were clearly distinguished among the various P rates. However, aboveground trait expression registered increased growth from 6.0 to 10.0 ppm of P. The major root-attributed traits in 0.5 ppm of P are significantly increased vis-¨¤-vis 10 ppm of P. Analysis of variance displayed a significant difference between the genotypes for PSTOL1 and PHT1 expression. In low P, maximum root length with a shoot and root dry weight was observed in a new indigenous accession, IC459373, with higher expression of PSTOL1 than in Dular and IR64-Pup1 in 0.5 ppm of P at 14 d. Among the 13 PHT1 genes, OsPT1, OsPT2, OsPT6, and OsPT13 showed significant upregulation in IC459373, Dular, and IR64-Pup1. These results indicated that studying the expression levels of the PSTOL1 and PHT1 gene family at the early growth stages would be helpful in identifying superior donors to improve low-P tolerance and P-use efficiency in rice breeding programs.
