OsPHT1	OsPht1;3|OsPT3	OsPHT1;3 Mediates Uptake, Translocation and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes.	 However, unlike that reported for other known OsPHT1 members which facilitate Pi uptake at relatively higher Pi levels, mutation of OsPHT1;3 impaired Pi uptake and root-to-shoot Pi translocation only when external Pi concentration was below 5 ¦ÌM
OsPHT1	OsPht1;3|OsPT3	OsPHT1;3 Mediates Uptake, Translocation and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes.	 Furthermore, overexpression and mutation of OsPHT1;3 led to reciprocal alteration in the expression of OsPHT1;2 and several other OsPHT1 genes
OsNLA1	OsPHT1	uORF and Phosphate-Regulated Expression of Rice OsNLA1 Controls Phosphate Transport and Reproduction.	 In this study, we provide evidence that OsNLA1 controls Pi acquisition by directing the degradation of several OsPHT1 Pi transporters (i
