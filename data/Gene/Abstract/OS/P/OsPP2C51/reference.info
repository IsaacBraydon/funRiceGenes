NA	The protein phosphatase 2C clade A protein OsPP2C51 positively regulates seed germination by directly inactivating OsbZIP10.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Gene Engineering Division, National Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Rural Development Administration, Jeonju, South Korea.	Protein phosphatase 2C clade A members are major signaling components in the ABA-dependent signaling cascade that regulates seed germination. To elucidate the role of PP2CA genes in germination of rice seed, we selected OsPP2C51, which shows highly specific expression in the embryo compared with other protein phosphatases based on microarray data. GUS histochemical assay confirmed that OsPP2C51 is expressed in the seed embryo and that this expression pattern is unique compared with those of other OsPP2CA genes. Data obtained from germination assays and alpha-amylase assays of OsPP2C51 knockout and overexpression lines suggest that OsPP2C51 positively regulates seed germination in rice. The expression of alpha-amylase synthesizing genes was high in OsPP2C51 overexpressing plants, suggesting that elevated levels of OsPP2C51 might enhance gene expression related to higher rates of seed germination. Analysis of protein interactions between ABA signaling components showed that OsPP2C51 interacts with OsPYL/RCAR5 in an ABA-dependent manner. Furthermore, interactions were observed between OsPP2C51 and SAPK2, and between OsPP2C51 and OsbZIP10 and we found out that OsPP2C51 can dephosphorylates OsbZIP10. These findings suggest the existence of a new branch in ABA signaling pathway consisting of OsPYL/RCAR-OsPP2C-bZIP apart from the previously reported OsPYL/RCAR-OsPP2C-SAPK-bZIP. Overall, our result suggests that OsPP2C51 is a positive regulator of seed germination by directly suppressing active phosphorylated OsbZIP10.
NA	A comprehensive transcriptome analysis of contrasting rice cultivars highlights the role of auxin and ABA responsive genes in heat stress response	2021	Genomics	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.	Sensing a change in ambient temperature is key to survival among all living organisms. Temperature fluctuations due to climate change are a matter of grave concern since it adversely affects growth and eventually the yield of crop plants, including two of the major cereals, i.e., rice and wheat. Thus, to understand the response of rice seedlings to elevated temperatures, we performed microarray-based transcriptome analysis of two contrasting rice cultivars, Annapurna (heat tolerant) and IR64 (heat susceptible), by subjecting their seedlings to 37 °„C and 42 °„C, sequentially. The transcriptome analyses revealed a set of uniquely regulated genes and related pathways in red rice cultivar Annapurna, particularly associated with auxin and ABA as a part of heat stress response in rice. The changes in expression of few auxin and ABA associated genes, such as OsIAA13, OsIAA20, ILL8, OsbZIP12, OsPP2C51, OsDi19-1 and OsHOX24, among others, were validated under high-temperature conditions using RT-qPCR. In particular, the expression of auxin-inducible SAUR genes was enhanced considerably at both elevated temperatures. Further, using genes that expressed inversely under heat vs. cold temperature conditions, we built a regulatory network between transcription factors (TF) such as HSFs, NAC, WRKYs, bHLHs or bZIPs and their target gene pairs and determined regulatory coordination in their expression under varying temperature conditions. Our work thus provides useful insights into temperature-responsive genes, particularly under elevated temperature conditions, and could serve as a resource of candidate genes associated with thermotolerance or downstream components of temperature sensors in rice.
