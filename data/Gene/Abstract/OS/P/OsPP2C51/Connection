OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsPP2C51	The protein phosphatase 2C clade A protein OsPP2C51 positively regulates seed germination by directly inactivating OsbZIP10.	The protein phosphatase 2C clade A protein OsPP2C51 positively regulates seed germination by directly inactivating OsbZIP10.
OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsPP2C51	The protein phosphatase 2C clade A protein OsPP2C51 positively regulates seed germination by directly inactivating OsbZIP10.	Furthermore, interactions were observed between OsPP2C51 and SAPK2, and between OsPP2C51 and OsbZIP10 and we found out that OsPP2C51 can dephosphorylates OsbZIP10
OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsPP2C51	The protein phosphatase 2C clade A protein OsPP2C51 positively regulates seed germination by directly inactivating OsbZIP10.	Overall, our result suggests that OsPP2C51 is a positive regulator of seed germination by directly suppressing active phosphorylated OsbZIP10
OsPP2C51	SAPK2|OsSAPK2	The protein phosphatase 2C clade A protein OsPP2C51 positively regulates seed germination by directly inactivating OsbZIP10.	Furthermore, interactions were observed between OsPP2C51 and SAPK2, and between OsPP2C51 and OsbZIP10 and we found out that OsPP2C51 can dephosphorylates OsbZIP10
OsIAA13|OsiIAA1	OsPP2C51	A comprehensive transcriptome analysis of contrasting rice cultivars highlights the role of auxin and ABA responsive genes in heat stress response	 The changes in expression of few auxin and ABA associated genes, such as OsIAA13, OsIAA20, ILL8, OsbZIP12, OsPP2C51, OsDi19-1 and OsHOX24, among others, were validated under high-temperature conditions using RT-qPCR
