OsPG3	architecture	Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies a Plant-Height-Associated Gene OsPG3 in a Population of Commercial Rice Varieties.	 Given that rice architecture is one of the most critical phenotypes in rice breeding, OsPG3 has potential in rice&#x27;s molecular design breeding toward an ideal plant height
OsPG3	breeding	Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies a Plant-Height-Associated Gene OsPG3 in a Population of Commercial Rice Varieties.	 Given that rice architecture is one of the most critical phenotypes in rice breeding, OsPG3 has potential in rice&#x27;s molecular design breeding toward an ideal plant height
OsPG3	cell wall	Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies a Plant-Height-Associated Gene OsPG3 in a Population of Commercial Rice Varieties.	 Our findings suggest that OsPG3 plays a vital role in controlling rice plant height by regulating cell wall biosynthesis
OsPG3	dwarf	Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies a Plant-Height-Associated Gene OsPG3 in a Population of Commercial Rice Varieties.	 The rice plant exhibits a super dwarf phenotype when the knockout of the OsPG3 gene occurs via CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology
OsPG3	height	Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies a Plant-Height-Associated Gene OsPG3 in a Population of Commercial Rice Varieties.	 Our findings suggest that OsPG3 plays a vital role in controlling rice plant height by regulating cell wall biosynthesis
OsPG3	height	Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies a Plant-Height-Associated Gene OsPG3 in a Population of Commercial Rice Varieties.	 Given that rice architecture is one of the most critical phenotypes in rice breeding, OsPG3 has potential in rice&#x27;s molecular design breeding toward an ideal plant height
OsPG3	plant height	Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies a Plant-Height-Associated Gene OsPG3 in a Population of Commercial Rice Varieties.	 Our findings suggest that OsPG3 plays a vital role in controlling rice plant height by regulating cell wall biosynthesis
OsPG3	plant height	Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies a Plant-Height-Associated Gene OsPG3 in a Population of Commercial Rice Varieties.	 Given that rice architecture is one of the most critical phenotypes in rice breeding, OsPG3 has potential in rice&#x27;s molecular design breeding toward an ideal plant height
OsPG3	phytohormone	Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies a Plant-Height-Associated Gene OsPG3 in a Population of Commercial Rice Varieties.	 RNA-Seq analysis indicated that OsPG3 modulates the expression of genes involved in phytohormone metabolism and cell-wall-biosynthesis pathways
