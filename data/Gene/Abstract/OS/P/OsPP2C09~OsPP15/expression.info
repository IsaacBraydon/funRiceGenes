OsPP2C09|OsPP15|OsPYL2	 By contrast, overexpression of the OsPYL/RCAR3-interacting protein OsPP2C09 rendered plant growth more sensitive to osmotic stress |  In agreement with this observation, transcriptome analysis of plants overexpressing OsPP2C09 indicated that OsPP2C09 induces the expression of genes whose promoters contain DREs	 By contrast, overexpression of the OsPYL/RCAR3-interacting protein OsPP2C09 rendered plant growth more sensitive to osmotic stress
