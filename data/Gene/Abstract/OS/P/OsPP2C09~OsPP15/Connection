OsPP2C09|OsPP15|OsPYL2	XB15|PP2C	OsPP2C09, a negative regulatory factor in abscisic acid signaling, plays an essential role in balancing plant growth and drought tolerance in rice.	 The OsPP2C09 protein interacted with the core components of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and showed PP2C phosphatase activity in vitro
