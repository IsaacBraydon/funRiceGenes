Pheophorbide a oxygenase (PAO) and red chlorophyll catabolite reductase (RCCR) catalyze key steps in chlorophyll degradation by opening the porphyrin macrocycle of pheophorbide a and forming the primary non-photoreactive fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite. These genes strongly participate in senescence and reportedly involved in plants' responses to physical wounding and pathogens. In this report, a single PAO gene (OsPAO) and two RCCR genes (OsRCCR1 and OsRCCR2) have been isolated from rice. Expression analysis by semi-quantitative PCR or quantitative real-time PCR showed that OsRCCR1 transcripts were much more abundant than OsRCCR2, and all of these genes were upregulated during senescence and following wound treatment. RNA interference knockdown of OsPAO led to pheophorbide a accumulation in leaves (especially dark-induced senescent leaves) and leaf death from regeneration stage onwards, even transgenic plants inviability after transplantation. While, knockdown of OsRCCR1 resulted in lesion-mimic spots generation in older leaves which died off early in the transgenic plants. These results suggest that OsPAO and OsRCCR1 play key roles in senescence and are involved in wound responses.
j.1365-313X.2007.03221.x.pdf	Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice	2007	Plant J	South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510650, China.	Chloroplasts undergo drastic morphological and physiological changes during senescence with a visible symptom of chlorophyll (Chl) degradation. A stay green mutant was identified and then isolated from the japonica rice (Oryza sativa) cv. Huazhiwu by gamma-ray irradiation. The stay green mutant was characterized by Chl retention, stable Chl-protein complexes, and stable thylakoid membrane structures, but lost its photosynthetic competence during senescence. The gene, designated Stay Green Rice (SGR), was cloned by a positional cloning strategy encoding an ancient protein containing a putative chloroplast transit peptide. SGR protein was found in both soluble and thylakoid membranes in rice. SGR, like the gene for pheophorbide a oxygenase (PaO), was constitutively expressed, but was upregulated by dark-induced senescence in rice leaves. Senescence-induced expression of SGR and PaO was enhanced by ABA, but inhibited by cytokinin. Overexpression of SGR reduced the number of lamellae in the grana thylakoids and reduced the Chl content of normally growing leaves. This indicates that upregulation of SGR increases Chl breakdown during senescence in rice. A small quantity of chlorophyllide a accumulated in sgr leaves, but this also accumulated in wild-type rice leaves during senescence. Some pheophorbide a was detected in sgr leaves in the dark. According to these observations, we propose that SGR may be involved in regulating or taking part in the activity of PaO, and then may influence Chl breakdown and degradation of pigment-protein complex.
