OsPAO	leaf	Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice	 RNA interference knockdown of OsPAO led to pheophorbide a accumulation in leaves (especially dark-induced senescent leaves) and leaf death from regeneration stage onwards, even transgenic plants inviability after transplantation
OsPAO	senescence	Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice	 These results suggest that OsPAO and OsRCCR1 play key roles in senescence and are involved in wound responses
