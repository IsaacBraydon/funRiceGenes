OsPIN1a	shoot	Functional divergence of PIN1 paralogous genes in rice.	 These data suggest that OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b are involved in root, shoot and inflorescence development in rice, whereas OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d mainly function in panicle formation
OsPIN1a	panicle	Functional divergence of PIN1 paralogous genes in rice.	 These data suggest that OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b are involved in root, shoot and inflorescence development in rice, whereas OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d mainly function in panicle formation
OsPIN1a	development	Functional divergence of PIN1 paralogous genes in rice.	 These data suggest that OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b are involved in root, shoot and inflorescence development in rice, whereas OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d mainly function in panicle formation
OsPIN1a	inflorescence	Functional divergence of PIN1 paralogous genes in rice.	 These data suggest that OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b are involved in root, shoot and inflorescence development in rice, whereas OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d mainly function in panicle formation
