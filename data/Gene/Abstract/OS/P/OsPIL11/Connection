OsPIL11	OsPRR1	Characterization of a Set of Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like bHLH Proteins inOryza sativa	 Some of them (OsPIL11, OsPIL12, and OsPIL13) showed the ability to interact with the putative OsPRR1 (PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 1) clock component, as far as the results of yeast two-hybrid assays were concerned
APG|OsPIL16	OsPIL11	Characterization of a Set of Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like bHLH Proteins inOryza sativa	 In this study, we identified and characterized a set of highly homologous members (designated OsPIL11 to OsPIL16) in the model monocotyledon rice (Oryza sativa)
