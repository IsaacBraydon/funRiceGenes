NA	Overexpression of a novel small auxin-up RNA gene, OsSAUR11, enhances rice deep rootedness.	2023	BMC Plant Biol	Shanghai Agrobiological Gene Center, Shanghai, 201106, China.	BACKGROUND: Deep rooting is an important factor affecting rice drought resistance. However, few genes have been identified to control this trait in rice. Previously, we identified several candidate genes by QTL mapping of the ratio of deep rooting and gene expression analysis in rice. RESULTS: In the present work, we cloned one of these candidate genes, OsSAUR11, which encodes a small auxin-up RNA (SAUR) protein. Overexpression of OsSAUR11 significantly enhanced the ratio of deep rooting of transgenic rice, but knockout of this gene did not significantly affect deep rooting. The expression of OsSAUR11 in rice root was induced by auxin and drought, and OsSAUR11-GFP was localized both in the plasma membrane and cell nucleus. Through an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and gene expression analysis in transgenic rice, we found that the transcription factor OsbZIP62 can bind to the promoter of OsSAUR11 and promote its expression. A luciferase complementary test showed that OsSAUR11 interacts with the protein phosphatase OsPP36. Additionally, expression of several auxin synthesis and transport genes (e.g., OsYUC5 and OsPIN2) were down-regulated in OsSAUR11-overexpressing rice plants. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a novel gene OsSAUR11 positively regulates deep rooting in rice, which provides an empirical basis for future improvement of rice root architecture and drought resistance.
