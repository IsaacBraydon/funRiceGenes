OsPP2C27	growth	Phosphatase OsPP2C27 directly dephosphorylates OsMAPK3 and OsbHLH002 to negatively regulate cold tolerance in rice	 These results indicate that cold-induced OsPP2C27 negatively regulates the OsMAPK3-OsbHLH002-OsTPP1 signalling pathway by directly dephosphorylating both phospho-OsMAPK3 and phospho-OsbHLH002, preventing the sustained activation of a positive pathway for cold stress and maintaining normal growth under chilling conditions
