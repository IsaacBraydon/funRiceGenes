OsMAPK33|OsMAPK3	OsPP2C27	Phosphatase OsPP2C27 directly dephosphorylates OsMAPK3 and OsbHLH002 to negatively regulate cold tolerance in rice	Phosphatase OsPP2C27 directly dephosphorylates OsMAPK3 and OsbHLH002 to negatively regulate cold tolerance in rice
OsMAPK33|OsMAPK3	OsPP2C27	Phosphatase OsPP2C27 directly dephosphorylates OsMAPK3 and OsbHLH002 to negatively regulate cold tolerance in rice	 We show that OsPP2C27 interacts physically with and dephosphorylates OsMAPK3 in vitro and in vivo
OsMAPK33|OsMAPK3	OsPP2C27	Phosphatase OsPP2C27 directly dephosphorylates OsMAPK3 and OsbHLH002 to negatively regulate cold tolerance in rice	 Interestingly, OsPP2C27 can also directly dephosphorylate OsbHLH002, the target of OsMAPK3
