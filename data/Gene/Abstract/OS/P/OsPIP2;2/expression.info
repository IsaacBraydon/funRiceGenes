OsPIP2;2	 After de novo expression in tobacco protoplasts, OsPIP2;2 exceeded OsPIP1;3, OsPIP2;1, and OsPIP2;4 to support H2O transport across the plasma membranes |  In rice protoplasts, H2O transport and drought-tolerant responses, which included expression of marker genes of drought tolerance pathway, were considerably enhanced by OsPIP2;2 overexpression but strongly inhibited by the gene silencing	 In rice protoplasts, H2O transport and drought-tolerant responses, which included expression of marker genes of drought tolerance pathway, were considerably enhanced by OsPIP2;2 overexpression but strongly inhibited by the gene silencing
