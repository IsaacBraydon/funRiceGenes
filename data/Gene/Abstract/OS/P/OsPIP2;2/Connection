OsPIP2;2	OsPIP2;4	Rice aquaporin OsPIP2;2 is a water-transporting facilitator in relevance to drought-tolerant responses	 In concomitant tests of all OsPIPs, four genes (OsPIP1;3, OsPIP2;1, OsPIP2;2, and OsPIP2;4) were induced to express in leaves of rice plants following a physiological drought stress, while OsPIP2;2 was expressed to the highest level
OsPIP2;2	OsPIP2;4	Rice aquaporin OsPIP2;2 is a water-transporting facilitator in relevance to drought-tolerant responses	 After de novo expression in tobacco protoplasts, OsPIP2;2 exceeded OsPIP1;3, OsPIP2;1, and OsPIP2;4 to support H2O transport across the plasma membranes
