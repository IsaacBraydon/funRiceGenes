OsPDR2	 Therefore, qRT-PCR was employed to determine the spatiotemporal effects and the availability of Pi on the expression of OsPDR2 |  OsPDR2 showed variable levels of relative expression pattern in vegetative and/or reproductive tissues analyzed at different stages of growth and development (5-17 weeks)	 Further, the reverse genetics approach was employed for determining the function of OsPDR2 by generating RNAi lines (Ri2, Ri9, and Ri18) |  The study revealed significant inhibitory effects of RNAi-mediated suppression of OsPDR2 on the development of root, male reproductive traits, and yield |  Moreover, 32P isotope labeling and split-root experiments under different Pi regime with RNAi lines revealed the function of OsPDR2 in regulating homeostasis of Pi
