However, the limited availability of Pi in soils affects the growth and development of plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), Phosphate Deficiency Response2 (AtPDR2), interacts genetically with Low Phosphate Root1 (AtLPR1) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a key role in the inhibition of primary root growth (PRG) during Pi deficiency. However, the role of OsPDR2, the homolog of AtPDR2, either in roots response to Pi deficiency and/or in growth and development has not been elucidated as yet. Therefore, qRT-PCR was employed to determine the spatiotemporal effects and the availability of Pi on the expression of OsPDR2. OsPDR2 showed variable levels of relative expression pattern in vegetative and/or reproductive tissues analyzed at different stages of growth and development (5-17 weeks). Transient expression analysis revealed its subcellular localization to the ER. Further, the reverse genetics approach was employed for determining the function of OsPDR2 by generating RNAi lines (Ri2, Ri9, and Ri18). The study revealed significant inhibitory effects of RNAi-mediated suppression of OsPDR2 on the development of root, male reproductive traits, and yield. Moreover, 32P isotope labeling and split-root experiments under different Pi regime with RNAi lines revealed the function of OsPDR2 in regulating homeostasis of Pi.
