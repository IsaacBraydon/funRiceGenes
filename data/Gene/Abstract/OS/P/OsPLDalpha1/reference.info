NA	Overexpression of a phospholipase (OsPLD¦Á1) for drought tolerance in upland rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2018	Protoplasma	Instituto de Ci¨ºncias Biol¨®gicas, Universidade Federal de Goi¨¢s, Goiania, Goi¨¢s, Brasil.	This work aimed to evaluate the drought tolerance of transformed plants of the cultivar BRSMG Curinga that overexpress the rice phospholipase D ¦Á1 (OsPLD¦Á1) gene. The productivity of independent transformation event plants of the OsPLD¦Á1 gene was evaluated in an experiment where 19<U+00A0>days of water deficit were applied at the reproductive stage, a very strict growing condition for upland rice. The non-genetically modified cultivar (NGM) under drought treatment reduced productivity by 89% compared with that under irrigated treatment, whereas transformed plants (PLD¦Á1_E2) reduced productivity by only 41%. After the drought treatment, the PLD¦Á1_E2 plants productivity was five times greater than that of the NGM plant. Moreover, no adverse effects on growth and development of the transgenic plants were observed. Seven days after the resumption of irrigation, PLD¦Á1_E2 plants had higher stomatal conductance, greater photosynthetic rate, and transpiration rate than did NGM plants, as well as a higher expression level of the OsPLD¦Á1 gene. A delay in the senescence process was observed in these PLD¦Á1_E2 plants, and this was determined for the recovery of photosynthesis, with greater expression of the Rubisco and lower expression of the SOD. This finding was suggestive of decreased oxidative stress, probably due to gas exchange by the partial closure of the stomata of these transformed plants, which prevented the formation of reactive oxygen species. OsPLD¦Á1 gene overexpression resulted in a reduction in production loss under severe water deficit and revealed a possibility for the development of upland rice cultivars that are more tolerant to extreme drought conditions.
NA	Novel cis-acting regulatory elements in wild Oryza species impart improved rice bran quality by lowering the expression of phospholipase D alpha1 enzyme (OsPLD¦Á1).	2019	Mol Biol Rep	School of Agricultural Biotechnology, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, Punjab, India.	Rice bran oil is good quality edible oil, rich in antioxidants and comprised typically of oleic-linoleic type fatty acids. However, presence of a highly lipolytic enzyme Phospholipase D alpha1 (OsPLD¦Á1) increases free fatty acid content in the oil which further leads to stale flavor and rancidity of the oil, making it unfit for human consumption. In this study, we compared the upstream regions of OsPLD¦Á1 orthologs across 34 accessions representing 5 wild Oryza species and 8 cultivars, to uncover sequence variations and identify cis-elements involved in differential transcription of orthologs. Alignment of the upstream sequences to the Nipponbare OsPLD¦Á1 reference sequence revealed the presence of 39 SNPs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all the selected cultivars and wild species accessions are closely related to the reference except for three accessions of O. rufipogon (IRGC89224, IRGC104425, and IRGC105902). Furthermore, using exon-specific qRT-PCR, OsPLD¦Á1 expression patterns in immature grains indicated significant differences in transcript abundance between the wild species accessions. In comparison to the control, lowest gene expression was observed in IRGC89224 accession (0.20-fold) followed by IRGC105902 (0.26-fold) and IRGC104425 (0.41-fold) accessions. In-silico analysis of the OsPLD¦Á1 promoter revealed that the copy number variations of CGCGBOXAT, GT1CONSENSUS, IBOXCORE, NODCON2GM, OSE2ROOTNODULE, SURECOREATSULTR11, and SORLIP1AT cis-elements play an important role in the transcriptional activities of orthologous genes. Owing to the presence of ARFAT and SEBF elements only in the IRGC89224 accession, which had the lowest gene expression as well, these putative upstream regulatory sequences have been identified as novel cis-elements which may act as repressors in regulating the OsPLD¦Á1 gene expression. The accessions identified with low OsPLD¦Á1 expressions could be further deployed as potential donors of ideal OsPLD¦Á1 allele for transfer of the desired trait into elite rice cultivars.
