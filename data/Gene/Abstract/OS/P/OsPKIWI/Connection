OsPKIWI|PKIWI502	OsUCL8	Rice UCL8, a plantacyanin gene targeted by miR408, regulates fertility by controlling pollen tube germination and growth.	 Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we revealed that OsUCL8 interacts with the protein OsPKIWI, a homolog of the Arabidopsis FNRL protein
OsPKIWI|PKIWI502	OsUCL8	Rice UCL8, a plantacyanin gene targeted by miR408, regulates fertility by controlling pollen tube germination and growth.	 We thus hypothesized that OsUCL8 might regulate the production of VB components by interacting with OsPKIWI
