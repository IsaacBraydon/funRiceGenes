NA	OsCML16 interacts with a novel CC-NBS-LRR protein OsPi304 in the Ca2+/Mg2+ dependent and independent manner in rice.	2018	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	MOA Key Laboratory of Crop Ecophysiology and Farming System in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China; College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	In plants, many target proteins of calmodulins (CaMs) have been identified in cellular metabolism and responses. However, calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs) and their target proteins have not been discovered in stress responses in rice. In this study, a novel CC-NBS-LRR protein was obtained in screening a cold stress rice seedlings yeast cDNA library with OsCML16 as bait. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and BiFC assays demonstrated that the full length, CC region in the N-terminus and LRR in the C-terminus of Pi304 protein could interact with OsCML16. More interestingly, OsCML16 bound to the 1-10 motif rather than 1-14 motif in the Ca2+ or Mg2+ dependent manner in<U+00A0>vitro. In addition, transcript levels of OsCML16 and OsPi304 were induced more markedly in Nipponbare than in 9311 under cold stress. Taken together, these data indicates that they are involved in the cold stress signaling and response in rice.
