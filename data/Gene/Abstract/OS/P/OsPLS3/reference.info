NA	A 22-bp deletion in OsPLS3 gene encoding a DUF266-containing protein is implicated in rice leaf senescence.	2018	Plant Mol Biol	Department of Agronomy, Zijingang Campus, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, People's Republic of China.	Key message The OsPLS3 locus was isolated by map-based cloning that encodes a DUF266-containing protein. OsPLS3 regulates the onset of leaf senescence in rice. Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are one of the most important enzyme groups required for the modification of plant secondary metabolites and play a crucial role in plant growth and development, however the biological functions of most GTs remain elusive. We reported here the identification and characterization of a novel Oryza sativa premature leaf senescence mutant (ospls3). Through map-based cloning strategy, we determined that 22-bp deletion in the OsPLS3 gene encoding a domain of unknown function 266 (DUF266)-containing protein, a member of GT14-like, underlies the premature leaf senescence phenotype in the ospls3 mutant. The OsPLS3 mRNA levels progressively declined with the age-dependent leaf senescence in wild-type rice, implying a negative role of OsPLS3 in regulating leaf senescence. Physiological analysis, and histochemical staining and transmission electron microscopy assays indicated that the ospls3 mutant accumulated higher levels of ethylene and reactive oxygen species than its wild type. Furthermore, the ospls3 mutant showed hypersensitivity to exogenous 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, H2O2 and high level of cytokinins. Our results indicated that the DUF266-containing gene OsPLS3 plays an important role in the onset of leaf senescence, in part through cytokinin and ethylene signaling in rice.
NA	Functional inactivation of OsGCNT induces enhanced disease resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in rice	2018	BMC Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Chinese National Center for Rice Improvement, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, China.	We showed that a single base substitution from A to G at position 836 in  the coding sequence of Oryza sativa beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (OsGCNT), effectively mutating Tyr to Cys at position 279 in the translated protein sequence, was responsible for the spotted-leaf phenotype as it could be rescued by functional complementation. Compared to the wild type IR64, the spotted-leaf mutant spl21 exhibited loss of chlorophyll, breakdown of chloroplasts, down-regulation of photosynthesis-related genes, and up-regulation  of senescence associated genes, which indicated that OsGCNT regulates premature leaf senescence. Moreover, the enhanced resistance to the bacterial leaf blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, up-regulation of pathogenesis-related genes and increased level of jasmonate which suggested that OsGCNT is a negative  regulator of defense response in rice. OsGCNT was expressed constitutively in the leaves, sheaths, stems, roots, and panicles, and OsGCNT-GFP was localized to the  Golgi apparatus. High throughput RNA sequencing analysis provided further evidence for the biological effects of loss of OsGCNT function on cell death, premature leaf senescence and enhanced disease resistance in rice. Thus, we demonstrated that the novel OsGCNT regulated rice innate immunity and immunity-associated leaf senescence probably by changing the jasmonate metabolic  pathway.
NA	Mutation in a putative glycosyltransferase-like gene causes programmed cell death and early leaf senescence in rice.	2019	Rice (N Y)	Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Grassland Science, College of Forestry and Landscape Architecture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Leaf senescence is a genetically regulated, highly complex and ordered process. Although it has been extensively studied, the mechanism of leaf senescence is not well understood. In this study, we isolated a rice mutant, designated as premature senescence leaf (psl), which exhibits early senescence and spontaneous lesion mimic phenotype after flowering. The psl mutant displays programmed cell death with elevated accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that the phenotypes were caused by a phenylalanine deletion in the OsPSL (LOC_Os12g42420) that encode a putative core 2/I branching beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase predicted to be involved in protein glycosylation modification. OsPSL mRNA levels increased as senescence progressed, with maximum accumulation of transcripts at late senescence stages in WT plants. Moreover, remarkedly down-regulated transcriptional levels of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferases (OGTs) genes were observed in psl mutant, supporting the occurrence of impaired O-glycosylation modification. Proteomic analysis showed that ethylene-related metabolic enzymes including S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) synthetase (SAMS) were significantly upregulated in the psl mutant compared with WT. Consistent with the proteomic results, ethylene concentration is higher in psl mutant than in wild-type plants, and transcript levels of ethylene synthesis and signal transduction genes were induced in psl mutant. The early leaf senescence of psl can be partially rescued by ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine treatment. These results highlight the importance of protein O-glycosylation in PCD and leaf senescence, and suggest a possible role of OsPSL in ethylene signaling.
