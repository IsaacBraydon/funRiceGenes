OsPEP1	 OsPEP1 overexpression lines similarly displayed short roots, although this phenotype was not rescued by exogenous PEP1	 OsPEP1 overexpression lines similarly displayed short roots, although this phenotype was not rescued by exogenous PEP1	 Notably, OsPEP1 RNA interference (RNAi) lines had short primary roots with small meristems and short cells in the root elongation zone; furthermore, the short root phenotype of OsPEP1 RNAi plants could be rescued by exogenous application of PEP1
