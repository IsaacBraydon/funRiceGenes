OsPEP1	root	Root-secreted peptide OsPEP1 regulates primary root elongation in rice 	Root-secreted peptide OsPEP1 regulates primary root elongation in rice 
OsPEP1	root	Root-secreted peptide OsPEP1 regulates primary root elongation in rice 	 OsPEP1 was expressed highly in root tissues, especially root cap cells and epidermal cells in the root maturation zone
OsPEP1	root	Root-secreted peptide OsPEP1 regulates primary root elongation in rice 	 Notably, OsPEP1 RNA interference (RNAi) lines had short primary roots with small meristems and short cells in the root elongation zone; furthermore, the short root phenotype of OsPEP1 RNAi plants could be rescued by exogenous application of PEP1
