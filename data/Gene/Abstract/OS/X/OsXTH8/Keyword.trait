OsXTH8	gibberellin	Characterization of a xyloglucan endotransglucosylase gene that is up-regulated by gibberellin in rice	 A novel rice (Oryza sativa) XTH-related gene, OsXTH8, was cloned and characterized after being identified by cDNA microarray analysis of gibberellin-induced changes in gene expression in rice seedlings| These results indicate that OsXTH8 is differentially expressed in rice leaf sheath in relation to gibberellin and potentially involved in cell elongation processes
OsXTH8	seedling	Characterization of a xyloglucan endotransglucosylase gene that is up-regulated by gibberellin in rice	 A novel rice (Oryza sativa) XTH-related gene, OsXTH8, was cloned and characterized after being identified by cDNA microarray analysis of gibberellin-induced changes in gene expression in rice seedlings
OsXTH8	leaf	Characterization of a xyloglucan endotransglucosylase gene that is up-regulated by gibberellin in rice	 OsXTH8 was preferentially expressed in rice leaf sheath in response to gibberellic acid| In situ hybridization and OsXTH8 promoter GUS fusion analysis revealed that OsXTH8 was highly expressed in vascular bundles of leaf sheath and young nodal roots where the cells are actively undergoing elongation and differentiation| These results indicate that OsXTH8 is differentially expressed in rice leaf sheath in relation to gibberellin and potentially involved in cell elongation processes

OsXTH8	root	Characterization of a xyloglucan endotransglucosylase gene that is up-regulated by gibberellin in rice	 In situ hybridization and OsXTH8 promoter GUS fusion analysis revealed that OsXTH8 was highly expressed in vascular bundles of leaf sheath and young nodal roots where the cells are actively undergoing elongation and differentiation
OsXTH8	vascular bundle	Characterization of a xyloglucan endotransglucosylase gene that is up-regulated by gibberellin in rice	 In situ hybridization and OsXTH8 promoter GUS fusion analysis revealed that OsXTH8 was highly expressed in vascular bundles of leaf sheath and young nodal roots where the cells are actively undergoing elongation and differentiation
OsXTH8	growth	Characterization of a xyloglucan endotransglucosylase gene that is up-regulated by gibberellin in rice	 Transgenic rice expressing an RNAi construct of OsXTH8 exhibited repressed growth
