Plant Cell Physiol-2007-Tokunaga-700-14.pdf	Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Graduate School of Biosphere Sciences, Hiroshima University, Kagamiyama, Higashi-Hiroshima, 739-8528 Japan.	Rice microarray analysis showed that a number of stress-related genes are induced by external addition of L-ascorbic acid (AsA). The gene designated as AK073843 which is homologous to class capital SHA, Cyrillic chitinase was found to exhibit the highest induction among these genes. However, its crucial residues within the chitinase active site are substituted with other residues, suggesting that the protein has no chitinase activity. The recombinant protein which is encoded by the AK073843 gene produced in Escherichia coli has xylanase inhibitor activity, indicating that the gene encodes a novel rice XIP-type xylanase inhibitor protein (OsXIP). The expression of OsXIP was enhanced not only by exogenous AsA treatment but also by various stresses such as citrate and sodium chloride treatments, and wounding; however, it was not influenced by increasing endogenous AsA content. External AsA treatment caused a significant increase in electrolyte leakage from rice root. These results suggested that OsXIP was induced by stress which is caused by external AsA treatment. Rice XIP-family genes, OsXIP, riceXIP and RIXI, showed differential organ-specific expression. Also, these genes were differentially induced by stress and stress-related phytohormones. The transcripts of OsXIP and riceXIP were undetectable under normal conditions, and were drastically induced by wounding and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment in the root. RIXI was constitutively expressed in the shoot but not induced by wounding and stress-related phytohormones. Thus, XIP-type xylanase inhibitors were suggested to be specialized in their function and involved in defense mechanisms in rice.
Plant Cell Physiol-2008-Tokunaga-1122-7.pdf	RNAi-mediated knockdown of the XIP-type endoxylanase inhibitor gene, OsXIP, has no effect on grain development and germination in rice	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	Graduate School of Biosphere Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-4-4, Kagamiyama, Higashi-Hiroshima, 739-8528 Japan.	OsXIP (Oryza sativa xylanase inhibitor protein) is a XIP-type xylanase inhibitor which was identified as a protein encoded by a wound stress-responsive gene in rice. Although the OsXIP gene was specifically expressed in mature grains under basal conditions, recombinant OsXIP had no effect on rice endogenous xylanases, and OsXIP-suppressed transgenic rice plants did not exhibit any change in grain development and germination, suggesting that rice development may be independent of OsXIP. Analysis using an OsXIP-specific antibody revealed that OsXIP is markedly accumulated in apoplast in rice root cells by wounding. These results reinforced the possibility that OsXIP is involved in plant defense mechanisms against phytopathogens.
NA	Experimental and in silico studies of competitive inhibition of family GH10 Aspergillus fumigatus xylanase A by Oryza sativa xylanase inhibitor protein.	2021	Int J Biol Macromol	Key Laboratory of Marine Food Quality and Hazard Controlling Technology of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou 310018, China.	The family GH10 Aspergillus fumigatus xylanase A (AfXylA10) gene, afxyla10 was cloned and recombinantly expressed in Pichia pastoris X33. The optimum temperature and pH of reAfXylA10 was 53 °C and 7.0, and Mn(2+) remarkably activated the catalytic activity. The recombinant Oryza sativa xylanase inhibitor protein, rePOsXIP significantly inhibited reAfXylA10 with inhibition constant (K(i)) of 177.94 nM via competitive inhibition and decreased the concentration of hydrolysate from beechwood xylan. Optimal inhibition of rePOsXIP on reAfXylA10 occurred at 45 °C for 40 min. The fluorescence of reAfXylA10 was statically quenched by rePOsXIP, indicating the formation of reAfXylA10-rePOsXIP complex during their interaction. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to obtain the detailed information on enzyme-inhibitor interaction. The binding free energy (ΔG) of AfXylA10-OsXIP complex was -30 ± 9 kcal/mol by MM-PBSA calculation, and the α-7 helix of OsXIP anchored in the catalytic cleft of AfXylA10 by competition with the xylan substrate. K239(OsXIP) stably interacted with the catalytic site E140(AfXylA10) through hydrogen bond and vdW interaction. Intermolecular hydrogen bonds T104(AfXylA10)/V99(AfXylA10)-Q5(OsXIP), R256(AfXylA10)-E235(OsXIP), D155(AfXylA10)-Y243(OsXIP) and D145(AfXylA10)-R194(OsXIP) on the upper of the TIM barrel were essential for strengthening the stability of complex. Therefore, these non-covalent interactions (NCI) played key role in the interaction between AfXylA10 and OsXIP.
