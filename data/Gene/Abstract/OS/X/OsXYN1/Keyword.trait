OsXYN1	growth	Membrane-associated xylanase-like protein OsXYN1 is required for normal cell wall deposition and plant development in rice.	 The findings that OsXyn1 is involved in plant cell wall deposition and regulates plant growth and development help shed light on the functions of the rice GH10 family
OsXYN1	development	Membrane-associated xylanase-like protein OsXYN1 is required for normal cell wall deposition and plant development in rice.	Membrane-associated xylanase-like protein OsXYN1 is required for normal cell wall deposition and plant development in rice.

OsXYN1	map-based cloning	Membrane-associated xylanase-like protein OsXYN1 is required for normal cell wall deposition and plant development in rice.	 Map-based cloning of the ss1 mutant identified the candidate gene as OsXyn1 (LOC_03g47010), which encodes a xylanase-like protein belonging to the glycoside hydrolase 10 (GH10) family
