NA	Membrane-associated xylanase-like protein OsXYN1 is required for normal cell wall deposition and plant development in rice.	2020	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, PR China.	The rice (Oryza sativa) genome encodes 37 putative ¦Â-1,4-xylanase proteins, but none of them have been characterized at the genetic level. In this work, we report the isolation of slim stem (ss) mutants with pleiotropic defects, including dwarfism, leaf tip necrosis, and withered and rolled leaves<U+00A0>under<U+00A0>blazing<U+00A0>sunlight. Map-based cloning of the ss1 mutant identified the candidate gene as OsXyn1 (LOC_03g47010), which encodes a xylanase-like protein belonging to the glycoside hydrolase 10 (GH10) family. OsXyn1 was found to be widely expressed, especially in young tissues. Subcellular localization analysis showed that OsXyn1 encodes a membrane-associated protein. Physiological analysis of ss1 and the allelic ss2 mutant revealed that water uptake was partially compromised in these mutants. Consistently, the plant cell wall of the mutants exhibited middle lamella abnormalities or deficiencies. Immunogold assays revealed an unconfined distribution of xylan in the mutant cell walls, which may have contributed to a slower rate of plant cell wall biosynthesis and delayed plant growth. Additionally, water deficiency caused ABA accumulation and triggered drought responses in the mutants. The findings that OsXyn1 is involved in plant cell wall deposition and regulates plant growth and development help shed light on the functions of the rice GH10 family.
