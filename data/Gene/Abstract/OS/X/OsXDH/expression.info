OsXDH	), an OsXDH over-expression transgenic line (OE9), and an OsXDH RNA interference line (Ri3) during different growth stages |  The expression patterns of the OsXDH gene confirmed that XDH was involved in the regulation of normal and abiotic stress-induced ageing processes in rice
OsXDH|OsSAC3	 Moreover, carbohydrate distribution was changed, leading to the accumulation of sucrose and starch in the leaves containing ossac3 on account of decreased expression of OsSWEET3a, OsSWEET6a and OsSWEET14 and oxidized inactivation of starch degradation enzymes in ossac3
