Os11N3|OsSWEET14	OsXDH|OsSAC3	Mutation of OsSAC3, Encoding the Xanthine Dehydrogenase, Caused Early Senescence in Rice.	 Moreover, carbohydrate distribution was changed, leading to the accumulation of sucrose and starch in the leaves containing ossac3 on account of decreased expression of OsSWEET3a, OsSWEET6a and OsSWEET14 and oxidized inactivation of starch degradation enzymes in ossac3
