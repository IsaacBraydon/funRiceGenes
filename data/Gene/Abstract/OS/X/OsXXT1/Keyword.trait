OsXXT1	root	Mutation in xyloglucan 6-xylosytransferase results in abnormal root hair development in Oryza sativa.	 Furthermore, expression of the full-length coding sequence of OsXXT1 could complement the root hair defect, and slow growth and XyG synthesis in the Arabidopsis xxt1 xxt2 double mutant
OsXXT1	root	Mutation in xyloglucan 6-xylosytransferase results in abnormal root hair development in Oryza sativa.	 Transgenic plants expressing the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter under the control of the OsXXT1 promoter displayed GUS expression in multiple tissues, most prominently in root epidermal cells
OsXXT1	growth	Mutation in xyloglucan 6-xylosytransferase results in abnormal root hair development in Oryza sativa.	 Furthermore, expression of the full-length coding sequence of OsXXT1 could complement the root hair defect, and slow growth and XyG synthesis in the Arabidopsis xxt1 xxt2 double mutant
OsXXT1	cell wall	Mutation in xyloglucan 6-xylosytransferase results in abnormal root hair development in Oryza sativa.	 These results demonstrate the importance of OsXXT1 in maintaining cell wall structure and tensile strength in rice, a typical grass species that contains relatively low XyG content in cell walls
OsXXT1	root hair	Mutation in xyloglucan 6-xylosytransferase results in abnormal root hair development in Oryza sativa.	 Furthermore, expression of the full-length coding sequence of OsXXT1 could complement the root hair defect, and slow growth and XyG synthesis in the Arabidopsis xxt1 xxt2 double mutant
OsXXT1	root epidermal cells	Mutation in xyloglucan 6-xylosytransferase results in abnormal root hair development in Oryza sativa.	 Transgenic plants expressing the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter under the control of the OsXXT1 promoter displayed GUS expression in multiple tissues, most prominently in root epidermal cells
