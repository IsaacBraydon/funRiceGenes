NA	The potassium transporter OsHAK21 functions in the maintenance of ion homeostasis and tolerance to salt stress in rice.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, People's Republic of China.	The intracellular potassium (K(+) ) homeostasis, which is crucial for plant survival in saline environments, is modulated by K(+) channels and transporters. Some members of the High-Affinity K(+) transporter (HAK) family are believed to function in the regulation of plant salt tolerance, but the physiological mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report a significant inducement of OsHAK21 expression by high salinity treatment, and provide genetic evidence of the involvement of OsHAK21 in rice salt tolerance. Disruption of OsHAK21 rendered plants sensitive to salt stress. Compared to the wild type, oshak21 accumulated less K(+) and considerably more Na(+) in both shoots and roots, and had a significantly lower K(+) net uptake rate but higher Na(+) uptake rate. Our analyses of subcellular localizations and expression patterns showed that OsHAK21 was localized in the plasma membrane, and expressed in xylem parenchyma and individual endodermal cells (putative passage cells). Further functional characterizations of OsHAK21 in K(+) uptake-deficient yeast and Arabidopsis revealed that OsHAK21 possesses K(+) transporter activity. These results demonstrate that OsHAK21 may mediate K(+) absorption by the plasma membrane, and play crucial roles in the maintenance of the Na(+) /K(+) homeostasis in rice under salt stress.
NA	A quantitative trait locus, qSE3, promotes seed germination and seedling establishment under salinity stress in rice.	2018	Plant J	The Laboratory of Seed Science and Technology, State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Modern Crop Production, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, PR China.	Seed germination is a complex trait determined by both quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and environmental factors and also their interactions. In this study, we mapped one major QTL qSE3 for seed germination and seedling establishment under salinity stress in rice. To understand the molecular basis of this QTL, we isolated qSE3 by map-based cloning and found that it encodes a K+ transporter gene, OsHAK21. The expression of qSE3 was significantly up-regulated by salinity stress in germinating seeds. Physiological analysis suggested that qSE3 significantly increased K+ and Na+ uptake in germinating seeds under salinity stress, resulting in increased abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and activated ABA signaling responses. Furthermore, qSE3 significantly decreased the H2 O2 level in germinating seeds under salinity stress. All of these seed physiological changes modulated by qSE3 might contribute to seed germination and seedling establishment under salinity stress. Based on analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphism data of rice accessions, we identified a HAP3 haplotype of qSE3 that was positively correlated with seed germination under salinity stress. This study provides important insights into the roles of qSE3 in seed germination and seedling establishment under salinity stress and facilitates the practical use of qSE3 in rice breeding.
