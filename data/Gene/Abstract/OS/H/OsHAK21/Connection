OsCYB5-2	OsHAK21|qSE3	An endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b (5) regulates high-affinity K(+) transport in response to salt stress in rice.	 In this study, we identified an endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b (5) (OsCYB5-2) that interacted with a high-affinity K(+) transporter (OsHAK21) at the plasma membrane
OsCYB5-2	OsHAK21|qSE3	An endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b (5) regulates high-affinity K(+) transport in response to salt stress in rice.	 The association of OsCYB5-2 with the OsHAK21 transporter caused an increase in transporter activity by enhancing the apparent affinity for K(+)-binding but not Na(+)-binding
OsCYB5-2	OsHAK21|qSE3	An endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b (5) regulates high-affinity K(+) transport in response to salt stress in rice.	 Heme binding to OsCYB5-2 was essential for the regulation of OsHAK21
OsHAK21|qSE3	OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8|OsHK1;5	Natural variations of chlorophyll fluorescence and ion transporter genes influenced the differential response of japonica rice germplasm with different salt tolerances.	 The expression characteristics of chlorophyll fluorescence genes (OsABCI7 and OsHCF222) and ion transporter protein genes (OsHKT1;5, OsHKT2;1, OsHAK21, OsAKT2, OsNHX1, and OsSOS1) were analyzed
