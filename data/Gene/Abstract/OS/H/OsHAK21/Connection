OsCYB5-2	OsHAK21|qSE3	An endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b (5) regulates high-affinity K(+) transport in response to salt stress in rice.	 In this study, we identified an endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b (5) (OsCYB5-2) that interacted with a high-affinity K(+) transporter (OsHAK21) at the plasma membrane
OsCYB5-2	OsHAK21|qSE3	An endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b (5) regulates high-affinity K(+) transport in response to salt stress in rice.	 The association of OsCYB5-2 with the OsHAK21 transporter caused an increase in transporter activity by enhancing the apparent affinity for K(+)-binding but not Na(+)-binding
OsCYB5-2	OsHAK21|qSE3	An endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b (5) regulates high-affinity K(+) transport in response to salt stress in rice.	 Heme binding to OsCYB5-2 was essential for the regulation of OsHAK21
OsHAK21|qSE3	OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8|OsHK1;5	Natural variations of chlorophyll fluorescence and ion transporter genes influenced the differential response of japonica rice germplasm with different salt tolerances.	 The expression characteristics of chlorophyll fluorescence genes (OsABCI7 and OsHCF222) and ion transporter protein genes (OsHKT1;5, OsHKT2;1, OsHAK21, OsAKT2, OsNHX1, and OsSOS1) were analyzed

OsAKT2	OsHAK21|qSE3	Natural variations of chlorophyll fluorescence and ion transporter genes influenced the differential response of japonica rice germplasm with different salt tolerances.	 The expression characteristics of chlorophyll fluorescence genes (OsABCI7 and OsHCF222) and ion transporter protein genes (OsHKT1;5, OsHKT2;1, OsHAK21, OsAKT2, OsNHX1, and OsSOS1) were analyzed
OsAKT2	OsHAK21|qSE3	Natural variations of chlorophyll fluorescence and ion transporter genes influenced the differential response of japonica rice germplasm with different salt tolerances.	 Haplotype analysis revealed four key variations associated with salt tolerance, including an SNP (+1605 bp) within OsABCI7 exon, an SSR (-1231 bp) within OsHAK21 promoter, an indel site at OsNHX1 promoter (-822 bp), and an SNP (-1866 bp) within OsAKT2 promoter
OsHAK21|qSE3	OsHCF222	Natural variations of chlorophyll fluorescence and ion transporter genes influenced the differential response of japonica rice germplasm with different salt tolerances.	 The expression characteristics of chlorophyll fluorescence genes (OsABCI7 and OsHCF222) and ion transporter protein genes (OsHKT1;5, OsHKT2;1, OsHAK21, OsAKT2, OsNHX1, and OsSOS1) were analyzed
OsHAK21|qSE3	OsNHA1|OsSOS1	Natural variations of chlorophyll fluorescence and ion transporter genes influenced the differential response of japonica rice germplasm with different salt tolerances.
