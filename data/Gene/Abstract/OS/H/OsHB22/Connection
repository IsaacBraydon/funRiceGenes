OsHB22	OsLEA3|OsLEA3-1	The OsFTIP6-OsHB22-OsMYBR57 module regulates drought response in rice.	 The OsFTIP6-mediated OsHB22 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and OsMYBR57-OsHB22 regulation of OsbZIP transcription ensure precise control of expression of OsLEA3 and Rab21, and thereby regulate the response to water deficiency in rice
