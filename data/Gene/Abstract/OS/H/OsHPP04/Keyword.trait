OsHPP04	resistance	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of the susceptibility gene OsHPP04 in rice confers enhanced resistance to rice root-knot nematode.	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of the susceptibility gene OsHPP04 in rice confers enhanced resistance to rice root-knot nematode.
OsHPP04	immunity	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of the susceptibility gene OsHPP04 in rice confers enhanced resistance to rice root-knot nematode.	 These findings suggest that OsHPP04 may be an S gene as a negative regulator of host immunity and genetic modification of S genes through the CRISPR/Cas9 technology can be used as a powerful tool to generate PPN resistant plant varieties
