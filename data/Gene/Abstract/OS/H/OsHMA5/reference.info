Plant Physiol.-2013-Deng-1353-62.pdf	A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice	2013	Plant Physiol	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan.	Heavy metal-transporting P-type ATPase (HMA) has been implicated in the transport of heavy metals in plants. Here, we report the function and role of an uncharacterized member of HMA, OsHMA5 in rice (Oryza sativa). Knockout of OsHMA5 resulted in a decreased copper (Cu) concentration in the shoots but an increased Cu concentration in the roots at the vegetative stage. At the reproductive stage, the concentration of Cu in the brown rice was significantly lower in the mutants than in the wild-type rice; however, there was no difference in the concentrations of iron, manganese, and zinc between two independent mutants and the wild type. The Cu concentration of xylem sap was lower in the mutants than in the wild-type rice. OsHMA5 was mainly expressed in the roots at the vegetative stage but also in nodes, peduncle, rachis, and husk at the reproductive stage. The expression was up-regulated by excess Cu but not by the deficiency of Cu and other metals, including zinc, iron, and manganese, at the vegetative stage. Analysis of the transgenic rice carrying the OsHMA5 promoter fused with green fluorescent protein revealed that it was localized at the root pericycle cells and xylem region of diffuse vascular bundles in node I, vascular tissues of peduncle, rachis, and husk. Furthermore, immunostaining with an antibody against OsHMA5 revealed that it was localized to the plasma membrane. Expression of OsHMA5 in a Cu transport-defective mutant yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain restored the growth. Taken together, OsHMA5 is involved in loading Cu to the xylem of the roots and other organs.
NA	The copper economy response is partially conserved in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2021	Plant Physiol Biochem	Programa de P¨®s-Gradua<U+00E7><U+00E3>o em Agrobiologia, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Santa Maria, Brazil.	Copper (Cu) is an essential element for plants, especially in photosynthesis, as it is required for plastocyanin function in electron transfer reactions at thylakoid membranes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, Cu deficiency leads to the Cu economy response, in which plants prioritize Cu usage by plastocyanin in detriment of non-essential cupric proteins. In rice (Oryza sativa), however, this response has not been characterized. Rice OsHMA5 is a Cu xylem-loading transporter involved in Cu translocation from roots to shoots, as suggested by the analysis of oshma5 mutant plants. Aiming to understand how rice plants respond to Cu deficiency and how decreased Cu translocation to shoots can affect this response, we characterized the physiological and molecular responses of WT and oshma5 plants under control and Cu deficiency treatments. We found evidence that shoots of oshma5 plants are more prone to Cu deficiency compared to shoots of WT plants, as demonstrated by decreased chlorophyll and Cu concentrations, and electron transport rate. Gene expression analysis revealed that Cu high-affinity transporters OsCOPT1 and OsCOPT5, along with a set of miRNAs and three Cu/Zn superoxide dismutases are responsive to Cu deficiency in both WT and oshma5 plants, suggesting their involvement in the Cu economy response. However, Fe superoxide dismutase was not up-regulated in rice, indicating a difference compared to the A. thaliana Cu economy model. Therefore, we provide evidence for a partially conserved Cu economy response in rice, in comparison to A. thaliana.
NA	The key micronutrient copper orchestrates broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice.	2022	Sci Adv	The State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China.	Copper is a critical regulator of plant growth and development. However, the mechanisms by which copper responds to virus invasion are unclear. We previously showed that SPL9-mediated transcriptional activation of miR528 adds a previously unidentified regulatory layer to the established ARGONAUTE (AGO18)-miR528-L-ascorbate oxidase (AO) antiviral defense. Here, we report that rice promotes copper accumulation in shoots by inducing copper transporter genes, including HMA5 and COPT, to counteract viral infection. Copper suppresses the transcriptional activation of miR528 by inhibiting the protein level of SPL9, thus alleviating miR528-mediated cleavage of AO transcripts to strengthen the antiviral response. Loss-of-function mutations in HMA5, COPT1, and COPT5 caused a significant reduction in copper accumulation and plant viral resistance because of the increased SPL9-mediated miR528 transcription. Gain in viral susceptibility was mitigated when SPL9 was mutated in the hma5 mutant background. Our study elucidates the molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks of copper homeostasis and the SPL9-miR528-AO antiviral pathway.
