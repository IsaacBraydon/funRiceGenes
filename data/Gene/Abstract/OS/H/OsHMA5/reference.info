Heavy metal-transporting P-type ATPase (HMA) has been implicated in the transport of heavy metals in plants. Here, we report the function and role of an uncharacterized member of HMA, OsHMA5 in rice (Oryza sativa). Knockout of OsHMA5 resulted in a decreased copper (Cu) concentration in the shoots but an increased Cu concentration in the roots at the vegetative stage. At the reproductive stage, the concentration of Cu in the brown rice was significantly lower in the mutants than in the wild-type rice; however, there was no difference in the concentrations of iron, manganese, and zinc between two independent mutants and the wild type. The Cu concentration of xylem sap was lower in the mutants than in the wild-type rice. OsHMA5 was mainly expressed in the roots at the vegetative stage but also in nodes, peduncle, rachis, and husk at the reproductive stage. The expression was up-regulated by excess Cu but not by the deficiency of Cu and other metals, including zinc, iron, and manganese, at the vegetative stage. Analysis of the transgenic rice carrying the OsHMA5 promoter fused with green fluorescent protein revealed that it was localized at the root pericycle cells and xylem region of diffuse vascular bundles in node I, vascular tissues of peduncle, rachis, and husk. Furthermore, immunostaining with an antibody against OsHMA5 revealed that it was localized to the plasma membrane. Expression of OsHMA5 in a Cu transport-defective mutant yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain restored the growth. Taken together, OsHMA5 is involved in loading Cu to the xylem of the roots and other organs.
