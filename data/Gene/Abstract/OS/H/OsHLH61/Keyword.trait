OsHLH61	salicylic acid	OsHLH61-OsbHLH96 influences rice defense to brown planthopper through regulating the pathogen-related genes.	 RNA-seq analysis revealed that some pathogen-related (PR) genes in the Salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway that mediate plant immunity were obviously down-regulated in the OsHLH61 RNAi plants
