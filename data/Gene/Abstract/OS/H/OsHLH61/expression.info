OsHLH61	 Furthermore, Methyl Jasmonic acid (Me-JA) and cis-12-oxo- phytodienoic acid (OPDA) induced expression of OsHLH61, while SA repressed it |  We knocked down expression of OsHLH61 by RNA interference (RNAi), the transgenic plants were susceptible to BPH infestation	 We knocked down expression of OsHLH61 by RNA interference (RNAi), the transgenic plants were susceptible to BPH infestation |  RNA-seq analysis revealed that some pathogen-related (PR) genes in the Salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway that mediate plant immunity were obviously down-regulated in the OsHLH61 RNAi plants
