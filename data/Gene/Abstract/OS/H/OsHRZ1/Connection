OsHRZ1	OsHRZ2	Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation	Here we report the identification of new iron regulators in rice, designated Oryza sativa Haemerythrin motif-containing Really Interesting New Gene (RING)- and Zinc-finger protein 1 (OsHRZ1) and OsHRZ2
OsHRZ1	OsHRZ2	Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation	OsHRZ1, OsHRZ2 and their Arabidopsis homologue BRUTUS bind iron and zinc, and possess ubiquitination activity
OsHRZ1	OsHRZ2	Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation	OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 are susceptible to degradation in roots irrespective of iron conditions
OsHRZ1	OsHRZ2	Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation	These results suggest that OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 are iron-binding sensors that negatively regulate iron acquisition under conditions of iron sufficiency
IDEF1	OsHRZ1	Jasmonate signaling is activated in the very early stages of iron deficiency responses in rice roots.	Many jasmonate-inducible genes were also negatively regulated by the ubiquitin ligases OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 and positively regulated by the transcription factor IDEF1
OsHRZ1	OsHRZ2	Jasmonate signaling is activated in the very early stages of iron deficiency responses in rice roots.	Many jasmonate-inducible genes were also negatively regulated by the ubiquitin ligases OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 and positively regulated by the transcription factor IDEF1
OsHRZ1	OsHRZ2	Copper and ectopic expression of the Arabidopsis transport protein COPT1 alter iron homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 C1 (OE) rice plants modify the expression of the putative iron-sensing factors OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 and enhance the expression of OsIRO2 under copper excess, which suggests a role of copper transport in iron signaling
