OsHRZ1	OsHRZ2	Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation	Here we report the identification of new iron regulators in rice, designated Oryza sativa Haemerythrin motif-containing Really Interesting New Gene (RING)- and Zinc-finger protein 1 (OsHRZ1) and OsHRZ2
OsHRZ1	OsHRZ2	Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation	OsHRZ1, OsHRZ2 and their Arabidopsis homologue BRUTUS bind iron and zinc, and possess ubiquitination activity
OsHRZ1	OsHRZ2	Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation	OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 are susceptible to degradation in roots irrespective of iron conditions
OsHRZ1	OsHRZ2	Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation	These results suggest that OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 are iron-binding sensors that negatively regulate iron acquisition under conditions of iron sufficiency
IDEF1	OsHRZ1	Jasmonate signaling is activated in the very early stages of iron deficiency responses in rice roots.	Many jasmonate-inducible genes were also negatively regulated by the ubiquitin ligases OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 and positively regulated by the transcription factor IDEF1
OsHRZ1	OsHRZ2	Jasmonate signaling is activated in the very early stages of iron deficiency responses in rice roots.	Many jasmonate-inducible genes were also negatively regulated by the ubiquitin ligases OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 and positively regulated by the transcription factor IDEF1
OsHRZ1	OsHRZ2	Copper and ectopic expression of the Arabidopsis transport protein COPT1 alter iron homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 C1 (OE) rice plants modify the expression of the putative iron-sensing factors OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 and enhance the expression of OsIRO2 under copper excess, which suggests a role of copper transport in iron signaling
OsHRZ1	OsIRO2	Copper and ectopic expression of the Arabidopsis transport protein COPT1 alter iron homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 C1 (OE) rice plants modify the expression of the putative iron-sensing factors OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 and enhance the expression of OsIRO2 under copper excess, which suggests a role of copper transport in iron signaling
OsHRZ1	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 (OsPRI1) positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.	 In this study, we reveal that OsPRI1 interacts with OsHRZ1
OsHRZ1	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 (OsPRI1) positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.	 In vitro ubiquitination experiments indicated that OsPRI1 is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1
OsHRZ1	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 (OsPRI1) positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.	 Cell-free degradation assays revealed that the stability of OsPRI1 decreased in wild type roots, but increased in the hrz1-2 mutant, suggesting OsHRZ1 is responsible for the instability of OsPRI1
OsHRZ1	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 (OsPRI1) positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.	 Collectively, these results imply that OsPRI1, which is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1, mediates rice responses to Fe-deficiency by positively regulating OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 expression as part of the OsHRZ1-OsPRI1-OsIRO2/3 signal transduction cascade
OsHRZ1	OsHRZ2	Rice HRZ ubiquitin ligases are crucial for response to excess iron.	 Two iron-binding ubiquitin ligases, OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2, negatively regulate such iron deficiency responses in rice (Oryza sativa)
OsHRZ1	OsHRZ2	Rice HRZ ubiquitin ligases are crucial for response to excess iron.	 Transgenic rice plants with repressed expression of OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 (HRZ knockdown lines) are tolerant to low iron availability and accumulate iron in shoots and seeds under both iron-sufficient and -deficient conditions without a growth penalty
OsHRZ1	OsHRZ2	Rice HRZ ubiquitin ligases are crucial for response to excess iron.	 Although the expression of OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 is transcriptionally upregulated under iron-deficient conditions, the physiological relevance of this induction is not known
OsbHLH058	OsHRZ1	OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 transcription factors positively regulate iron deficiency responses in rice.	 Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that OsbHLH058 interacts with OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 more strongly than OsbHLH060, whereas OsbHLH059 showed no interaction
OsbHLH058	OsHRZ1	OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 transcription factors positively regulate iron deficiency responses in rice.	 An in vitro ubiquitination assay detected no OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH060 ubiquitination by OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2
OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059	OsHRZ1	OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 transcription factors positively regulate iron deficiency responses in rice.	 Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that OsbHLH058 interacts with OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 more strongly than OsbHLH060, whereas OsbHLH059 showed no interaction
