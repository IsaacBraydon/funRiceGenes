OsHRZ1	zinc	Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation	 Here we report the identification of new iron regulators in rice, designated Oryza sativa Haemerythrin motif-containing Really Interesting New Gene (RING)- and Zinc-finger protein 1 (OsHRZ1) and OsHRZ2
OsHRZ1	zinc	Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation	 OsHRZ1, OsHRZ2 and their Arabidopsis homologue BRUTUS bind iron and zinc, and possess ubiquitination activity
OsHRZ1	iron	Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation	 Here we report the identification of new iron regulators in rice, designated Oryza sativa Haemerythrin motif-containing Really Interesting New Gene (RING)- and Zinc-finger protein 1 (OsHRZ1) and OsHRZ2
OsHRZ1	iron	Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation	 OsHRZ1, OsHRZ2 and their Arabidopsis homologue BRUTUS bind iron and zinc, and possess ubiquitination activity
OsHRZ1	iron	Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation	 OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 are susceptible to degradation in roots irrespective of iron conditions
OsHRZ1	iron	Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation	 These results suggest that OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 are iron-binding sensors that negatively regulate iron acquisition under conditions of iron sufficiency
OsHRZ1	root	Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation	 OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 are susceptible to degradation in roots irrespective of iron conditions
