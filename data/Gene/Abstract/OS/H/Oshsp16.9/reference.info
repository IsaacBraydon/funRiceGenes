10548530.pdf	Molecular characterization of Oryza sativa 16.9 kDa heat shock protein	1999	Biochem J	Department of Botany, National Taiwan University, Taipei, 106, Taiwan, R.O.C.	A rice class I low-molecular-mass heat shock protein (LMM HSP) Oshsp 16.9 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Oligomerized complexes of Oshsp16.9 were harvested and electron microscopic observations of purified complexes revealed globular structures of 10-20 nm in diameter (with majority of 15-18 nm) and calculated to comprise approx. 12 monomers per complex. In comparison, complexes from native rice class I LMM HSPs were observed as larger ellipsoid- or globular-like random aggregated hetero-oligomers. To characterize the biochemical functions of the hydrophobic N-terminal region of Oshsp16.9, a truncation in the N-terminal region was constructed and introduced into E. coli. Results showed that the N-terminal truncated Oshsp16.9 mutant was capable of forming complexes similar to the full-length Oshsp16.9; however, the deletion protein failed to confer in vitro protein thermostability under elevated temperatures. Protein assays from in vivo treatments at higher temperatures exhibited that non-specific interactions of E. coli cellular proteins only occurred with full-length Oshsp16.9 complexes but not with the mutant complex. In vitro immunoprecipitation of cellular proteins from E. coli overexpressing full-length Oshsp16.9 showed that interactions between plant LMM HSP and E. coli cellular proteins are temperature-dependent. Taken together, the hydrophobic N-terminal region of rice class I LMM HSP is critical in the ability of the protein to interact/bind with its potential substrates.
Plant Physiol.-2002-Yeh-661-8.pdf	Functional regions of rice heat shock protein, Oshsp16.9, required for conferring thermotolerance in Escherichia coli	2002	Plant Physiol	Department of Botany, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.	Rice (Oryza sativa) class I low-molecular mass (LMM) heat shock protein (HSP), Oshsp16.9, has been shown to be able to confer thermotolerance in Escherichia coli. To define the regions for this intriguing property, deletion mutants of this hsp have been constructed and overexpressed in E. coli XL1-blue cells after isopropyl beta-D-thioglactopyranoside induction. The deletion of amino acid residues 30 through 36 (PATSDND) in the N-terminal domain or 73 through 78 (EEGNVL) in the consensus II domain of Oshsp16.9 led to the loss of chaperone activities and also rendered the E. coli incapable of surviving at 47.5 degrees C. To further investigate the function of these two domains, we determined the light scattering changes of Oshsp16.9 mutant proteins at 320 nm under heat treatment either by themselves or in the presence of a thermosensitive enzyme, citrate synthase. It was observed that regions of amino acid residues 30 through 36 and 73 through 78 were responsible for stability of Oshsp16.9 and its interactions with other unfolded protein substrates, such as citrate synthase. Studies of two-point mutants of Oshsp16.9, GST-N74E73K and GST-N74E74K, indicate that amino acid residues 73 and 74 are an important part of the substrate-binding site of Oshsp16.9. Non-denaturing gel analysis of purified Oshsp16.9 revealed that oligomerization of Oshsp16.9 was necessary but not sufficient for its chaperone activity.
PNAS-1997-Yeh-10967-72.pdf	Expression of a gene encoding a 16.9-kDa heat-shock protein, Oshsp16.9, in Escherichia coli enhances thermotolerance	1997	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Botany, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.	A gene encoding the rice 16.9-kDa class I low-molecular-mass (LMM) heat-shock protein (HSP), Oshsp16.9, was introduced into Escherichia coli using the pGEX-2T expression vector to analyze the possible function of this LMM HSP under heat stress. It is known that E. coli does not normally produce class I LMM HSPs. We compared the survivability of E. coli XL1-Blue cells transformed with a recombinant plasmid containing a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Oshsp16.9 fusion protein (pGST-FL cells) with the control E. coli cells transformed with the pGEX-2T vector (pGST cells) under heat-shock (HS) after isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside induction. The pGST-FL cells demonstrated thermotolerance at 47.5 degrees C, a treatment that was lethal to the pGST cells. When the cell lysates from these two E. coli transformants were heated at 55 degrees C, the amount of protein denatured in the pGST-FL cells was 50% less than that of the pGST cells. Similar results as pGST-FL cells were obtained in pGST-N78 cells (cells produced a fusion protein with only the N-terminal 78 aa in the Oshsp16.9 portion) but not in pGST-C108 cells (cells produced a fusion protein with C-terminal 108 aa in the Oshsp16.9 portion). The acquired thermotolerant pGST-FL cells synthesized three types of HSPs, including the 76-, 73-, and 64-kDa proteins according to their abundance at a lethal temperature of 47.5 degrees C. This finding indicates that a plant class I LMM HSP, when effectively expressed in transformed prokaryotic cells that do not normally synthesize this class of LMM HSPs, may directly or indirectly increase thermotolerance.
