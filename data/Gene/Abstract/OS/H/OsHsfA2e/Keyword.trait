OsHsfA2e	temperature	Expression of rice heat stress transcription factor OsHsfA2e enhances tolerance to environmental stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis	Among 5 A2-type HSF genes encoded in the rice genome, four genes, including OsHsfA2e, are induced by high temperatures in rice seedlings
OsHsfA2e	breeding	Expression of rice heat stress transcription factor OsHsfA2e enhances tolerance to environmental stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis	These observations suggest that the OsHsfA2e may be useful in molecular breeding designed to improve the environmental stress tolerance of crops
OsHsfA2e	transcription factor	Expression of rice heat stress transcription factor OsHsfA2e enhances tolerance to environmental stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis	The rice cDNA inserted in R04333 encodes OsHsfA2e, a member of the heat stress transcription factors
OsHsfA2e	transcription factor	Expression of rice heat stress transcription factor OsHsfA2e enhances tolerance to environmental stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis	Expression of rice heat stress transcription factor OsHsfA2e enhances tolerance to environmental stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis
OsHsfA2e	seedling	Expression of rice heat stress transcription factor OsHsfA2e enhances tolerance to environmental stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis	Among 5 A2-type HSF genes encoded in the rice genome, four genes, including OsHsfA2e, are induced by high temperatures in rice seedlings
