Plant growth and crop yields are limited by high-temperature stresses. In this study, we attempted to isolate the rice genes responsible for high-temperature stress tolerance using a transformed Arabidopsis population expressing a full-length cDNA library of rice. From approximately 20,000 lines of transgenic Arabidopsis, we isolated a thermotolerant line, R04333, that could survive transient heat stress at the cotyledon stage. The rice cDNA inserted in R04333 encodes OsHsfA2e, a member of the heat stress transcription factors. The thermotolerant phenotype was observed in newly constructed transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing OsHsfA2e. Among 5 A2-type HSF genes encoded in the rice genome, four genes, including OsHsfA2e, are induced by high temperatures in rice seedlings. The OsHsfA2e protein was localized to the nuclear region and exhibited transcription activation activity in the C-terminal region. Microarray analysis demonstrated that under unstressed conditions transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing OsHsfA2e highly expressed certain stress-associated genes, including several classes of heat-shock proteins. The thermotolerant phenotype was observed not only in the cotyledons but also in rosette leaves, inflorescence stems and seeds. In addition, transgenic Arabidopsis exhibited tolerance to high-salinity stress. These observations suggest that the OsHsfA2e may be useful in molecular breeding designed to improve the environmental stress tolerance of crops.
JZUSB10-0291.pdf	Identification and expression analysis of OsHsfs in rice	2009	J Zhejiang Univ Sci B	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Heat stress transcription factors (Hsfs) are the central regulators of defense response to heat stress. We identified a total of 25 rice Hsf genes by genome-wide analysis of rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome, including the subspecies of O. japonica and O. indica. Proteins encoded by OsHsfs were divided into three classes according to their structures. Digital Northern analysis showed that OsHsfs were expressed constitutively. The expressions of these OsHsfs in response to heat stress and oxidative stress differed among the members of the gene family. Promoter analysis identified a number of stress-related cis-elements in the promoter regions of these OsHsfs. No significant correlation, however, was found between the heat-shock responses of genes and their cis-elements. Overall, our results provide a foundation for future research of OsHsfs function.
