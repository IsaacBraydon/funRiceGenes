OsHXK5	OsHXK6	Structure, expression, and functional analysis of the hexokinase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Sugars induced the expression of three OsHXKs, OsHXK2, OsHXK5, and OsHXK6, in excised leaves, while suppressing OsHXK7 expression in excised leaves and immature seeds
OsHXK5	OsHXK6	Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors	To investigate the functions of rice hexokinase isoforms, we characterized OsHXK5 and OsHXK6, which are evolutionarily related to AtHXK1
OsHXK5	OsHXK6	Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors	Transient expression analyses using GFP fusion constructs revealed that OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 are associated with mitochondria
OsHXK5	OsHXK6	Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors	Interestingly, the OsHXK5DeltamTP-GFP and OsHXK6DeltamTP-GFP fusion proteins, which lack N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptides, were present mainly in the nucleus with a small amount of the proteins seen in the cytosol
OsHXK5	OsHXK6	Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors	In addition, the OsHXK5NLS-GFP and OsHXK6NLS-GFP fusion proteins harboring nuclear localization signals were targeted predominantly in the nucleus, suggesting that these OsHXKs retain a dual-targeting ability to mitochondria and nuclei
OsHXK5	OsHXK6	Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors	Notably, the expression of OsHXK5, OsHXK6, or their mutant alleles complemented the Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2-1 mutant, thereby resulting in wild-type characteristics in seedling development, Glc-dependent gene expression, and plant growth
OsHXK5	OsHXK6	Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors	Furthermore, transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsHXK5 or OsHXK6 exhibited hypersensitive plant growth retardation and enhanced repression of the photosynthetic gene RbcS in response to Glc treatment
OsHXK5	OsHXK6	Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors	These results provide evidence that rice OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 can function as Glc sensors
OsHXK5	OsHXK6	Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors	Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors
OsHXK6	RF6	Pentatricopeptide-repeat family protein RF6 functions with hexokinase 6 to rescue rice cytoplasmic male sterility.	 RF6 is targeted to mitochondria, where it physically associates with hexokinase 6 (OsHXK6) and promotes the processing of the aberrant CMS-associated transcript atp6-orfH79 at nucleotide 1238, which ensures normal pollen development and restores fertility
OsHXK6	RF6	Pentatricopeptide-repeat family protein RF6 functions with hexokinase 6 to rescue rice cytoplasmic male sterility.	 Together these results reveal a novel mechanism for CMS restoration by which RF6 functions with OsHXK6 to restore HL-CMS fertility
