OsHAPL1	 Further studies showed that OsHAPL1 represses the expression of the florigen genes and FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1) and Hd3a through Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) |  We propose that OsHAPL1 functions as a transcriptional regulator and, together with DTH8, Hd1, the HAP complex, and general transcription factors, regulates the expression of target genes and then affects heading date by influencing the expression of Hd3a and RFT1 through Ehd1
