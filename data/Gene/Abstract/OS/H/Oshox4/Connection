Oshox4	OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses	 Interestingly, the expression of YAB1 that is involved in the negative feedback regulation of the GA biosynthesis was upregulated in the Oshox4 over-expressing plants| One-hybrid assays showed that Oshox4 could interact with YAB1 promoter in yeast
