Oshox4	leaf	Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses	 Oshox4 transcripts were detected in leaf and floral organ primordia but excluded from the shoot apical meristem and the protein was nuclear localized
Oshox4	gibberellin	Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses	Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses
Oshox4	shoot	Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses	 Oshox4 transcripts were detected in leaf and floral organ primordia but excluded from the shoot apical meristem and the protein was nuclear localized
Oshox4	floral	Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses	 Oshox4 transcripts were detected in leaf and floral organ primordia but excluded from the shoot apical meristem and the protein was nuclear localized
Oshox4	dwarf	Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses	 Over-expression of Oshox4 in rice induced a semi-dwarf phenotype that could not be complemented by applied GA3
Oshox4	meristem	Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses	 Oshox4 transcripts were detected in leaf and floral organ primordia but excluded from the shoot apical meristem and the protein was nuclear localized
Oshox4	 ga 	Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses	 Interestingly, the expression of YAB1 that is involved in the negative feedback regulation of the GA biosynthesis was upregulated in the Oshox4 over-expressing plants| These data together suggest that Oshox4 may be involved in the negative regulation of GA signalling and may play a role to fine tune GA responses in rice
Oshox4	shoot apical meristem	Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses	 Oshox4 transcripts were detected in leaf and floral organ primordia but excluded from the shoot apical meristem and the protein was nuclear localized
