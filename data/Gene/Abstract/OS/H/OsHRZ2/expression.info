Symbol	Expression
OsHRZ2	 C1 (OE) rice plants modify the expression of the putative iron-sensing factors OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 and enhance the expression of OsIRO2 under copper excess, which suggests a role of copper transport in iron signaling
OsHRZ2	 Transgenic rice plants with repressed expression of OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 (HRZ knockdown lines) are tolerant to low iron availability and accumulate iron in shoots and seeds under both iron-sufficient and -deficient conditions without a growth penalty |  Although the expression of OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 is transcriptionally upregulated under iron-deficient conditions, the physiological relevance of this induction is not known
