NA	OsHrd3 is necessary for maintaining the quality of endoplasmic reticulum-derived protein bodies in rice endosperm.	2015	J Exp Bot	Functional Transgenic Crops Research Unit, Genetically Modified Organism Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	Large amounts of seed storage proteins (SSPs) are produced in the maturing endosperm of rice seeds. Rice SSPs are synthesized as secretory proteins on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and are transported and deposited into protein complexes called protein bodies (PB-I and PB-II). Due to the high production of SSPs, unfolded SSPs may be generated during this process. However, it was previously unclear how such unfolded proteins are selected among synthesized products and removed from the ER to maintain protein quality in the endosperm. Since Hrd3/SEL1L recognizes unfolded proteins in yeast and mammalian protein quality control systems, the role of OsHrd3 in protein quality control in rice endosperm was investigated. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that OsHrd3 interacts with components of the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase complex such as OsOS-9 and OsHrd1 in rice protoplasts. Endosperm-specific suppression of OsHrd3 in transgenic rice reduced the levels of polyubiquitinated proteins and resulted in unfolded protein responses (UPRs) in the endosperm, suggesting that OsHrd3-mediated polyubiquitination plays an important role in ER quality control. It was found that a cysteine-rich 13kDa prolamin, RM1, was polyubiquitinated in wild-type (WT) seeds but not in OsHrd3 knockdown (KD) seeds. RM1 formed aberrant aggregates that were deposited abnormally in OsHrd3 KD seeds, resulting in deformed PB-I. Therefore, the quality of protein bodies is maintained by polyubiquitination of unfolded SSPs through the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase system in rice endosperm.
NA	MERISTEM ACTIVITYLESS (MAL) is involved in root development through maintenance of meristem size in rice	2020	Plant Mol Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Rice MERISTEM ACTIVITYLESS (MAL), a RING-H2 finger domain (RFD)-containing gene, regulates meristem cell viability after the initiation of root primordia mediated by cytokinin signaling. Genes in the RING-H2 finger domain (RFD) family play various roles during plant development and in biotic/abiotic stress responses. Rice gene MERISTEM ACTIVITYLESS (MAL), being contained in the RING-H2 finger domain (RFD), is characterized by a transmembrane domain at the N-terminal and a C3H2C3 zinc finger domain at the C-terminal. To elucidate the physiological and molecular functions of MAL, we generated MAL knockdown transgenic plants by RNA interference. MAL RNA-interfered (MRi) transgenic plants exhibited a phenotype with shorter crown root length and lower crown root number, accompanied by a lower cell division rate. The low division rate was observed in the root meristem exactly where MAL was expressed. Furthermore, transcriptome data revealed that cell wall macromolecule metabolism-related genes and redox-related genes were enriched in MAL RNAi lines. Most of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were induced by exogenous cytokinin. Hence, we conclude that MAL, as a novel regulatory factor, plays a major role in maintaining cell viability in the meristem after the initiation of root primordial formation, mediated by cytokinin signaling and reactive oxygen species (ROS).
