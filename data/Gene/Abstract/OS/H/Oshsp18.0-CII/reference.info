1-s2.0-S0168945206002160-main.pdf	Induction of a cDNA clone from rice encoding a class II small heat shock protein by heat stress, mechanical injury, and salicylic acid	2007	Plant Science	Department of Plant Pathology, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan	This is the first report of a full-length cDNA clone for a class II small heat shock protein (sHSP) isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L., cv. Tainong No. 67) etiolated seedlings heat shocked at 41 Â°C for 2 h. The coding sequence consists of 501 bp, and the clone encodes a protein of 18.0 kDa with a predicted pI value of 5.61. The obtained full-length cDNA clone, designated Oshsp18.0-CII, is almost identical to a putative class II sHSP gene located on rice (cv. Nipponbare) chromosome one and another putative class II sHSP rice gene. Oshsp18.0-CII was induced by mechanical injury and salicylic acid treatment, which is not common in this class of sHSP genes. Only one copy of class II sHSP genes is present in the rice genome, and western blot analysis with anti-PsHSP17.7 (a class II pea sHSP) also showed only one protein of âˆ‘ù<U+3E63>18 kDa in the 2D gel of heat-shocked rice proteins. Oshsp18.0-CII is GC-rich and contains a secondary structure in its RNA sequence.
NA	Differentially expressed seed aging responsive heat shock protein OsHSP18.2 implicates in seed vigor, longevity and improves germination and seedling establishment under abiotic stress.	2015	Front Plant Sci	National Institute of Plant Genome Research New Delhi, India.	Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are a diverse group of proteins and are highly abundant in plant species. Although majority of these sHSPs were shown to express specifically in seed, their potential function in seed physiology remains to be fully explored. Our proteomic analysis revealed that OsHSP18.2, a class II cytosolic HSP is an aging responsive protein as its abundance significantly increased after artificial aging in rice seeds. OsHSP18.2 transcript was found to markedly increase at the late maturation stage being highly abundant in dry seeds and sharply decreased after germination. Our biochemical study clearly demonstrated that OsHSP18.2 forms homooligomeric complex and is dodecameric in nature and functions as a molecular chaperone. OsHSP18.2 displayed chaperone activity as it was effective in preventing thermal inactivation of Citrate Synthase. Further, to analyze the function of this protein in seed physiology, seed specific Arabidopsis overexpression lines for OsHSP18.2 were generated. Our subsequent functional analysis clearly demonstrated that OsHSP18.2 has ability to improve seed vigor and longevity by reducing deleterious ROS accumulation in seeds. In addition, transformed Arabidopsis seeds also displayed better performance in germination and cotyledon emergence under adverse conditions. Collectively, our work demonstrates that OsHSP18.2 is an aging responsive protein which functions as a molecular chaperone and possibly protect and stabilize the cellular proteins from irreversible damage particularly during maturation drying, desiccation and aging in seeds by restricting ROS accumulation and thereby improves seed vigor, longevity and seedling establishment.
