OSHB4|OsHox32	Overexpression of OsHox32 Results in Pleiotropic Effects on Plant Type Architecture and Leaf Development in Rice. |  OsHox32 exhibited constitutive expression in different organs, with higher mRNA levels in the stem, leaf sheath, shoot apical meristems and young roots, suggesting a role in plant-type and leaf development |  mRNA level of six rice YABBY genes is up-regulated or down-regulated by OsHox32, suggesting that OsHox32 may regulate the architecture of plant type and leaf development by controlling the expression of YABBY genes in rice	Overexpression of OsHox32 Results in Pleiotropic Effects on Plant Type Architecture and Leaf Development in Rice.
