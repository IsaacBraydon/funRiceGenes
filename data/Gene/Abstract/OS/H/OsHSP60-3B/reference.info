Heat stress has a deleterious effect on male fertility in rice (Oryza sativa), but mechanisms to protect against heat stress in rice male gametophytes are poorly understood. Here, we have isolated and characterized a heat-sensitive male-sterile rice mutant, heat shock protein60-3bï¼ˆoshsp60-3b), that shows normal fertility at optimal temperatures but decreasing fertility as temperatures increase. High temperatures interfered with pollen starch granule formation and ROS scavenging in oshsp60-3b anthers, leading to cell death and pollen abortion. In line with the mutant phenotypes, OsHSP60-3B was rapidly upregulated in response to heat shock and its protein products were localized to the plastid. Critically, overexpression of OsHSP60-3B enhanced the heat tolerance of pollen in transgenic plants. We demonstrated that OsHSP60-3B interacted with FLOURY ENDOSPERM6(FLO6) in plastids, a key component involved in the starch granule formation in the rice pollen. Western-blot results showed that FLO6 level was substantially decreased in oshsp60-3b anthers at high temperature, indicating that OsHSP60-3B is required to stabilize FLO6 when temperatures exceed optimal conditions. We suggest that in response to high temperature, OsHSP60-3B interacts with FLO6 to regulate starch granule biogenesis in rice pollen and attenuates ROS levels in anthers to ensure normal male gametophyte development in rice.
