Heat stress transcription factors (Hsfs) are the central regulators of defense response to heat stress. We identified a total of 25 rice Hsf genes by genome-wide analysis of rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome, including the subspecies of O. japonica and O. indica. Proteins encoded by OsHsfs were divided into three classes according to their structures. Digital Northern analysis showed that OsHsfs were expressed constitutively. The expressions of these OsHsfs in response to heat stress and oxidative stress differed among the members of the gene family. Promoter analysis identified a number of stress-related cis-elements in the promoter regions of these OsHsfs. No significant correlation, however, was found between the heat-shock responses of genes and their cis-elements. Overall, our results provide a foundation for future research of OsHsfs function.

KEY MESSAGE: Expression of OsHsfB2b was strongly induced by heat, salt, ABA and PEG treatments. Drought and salt tolerances were significantly decreased by OsHsfB2b overexpression, but were enhanced by RNA interference. ABSTRACT: Plants have more than 20 heat shock factors (Hsfs) that were designated class A, B, and C. Many members of Class A Hsfs were characterized as activators of transcription, but the functional roles of class B and C Hsfs have not been fully recognized. OsHsfB2b is a member of class B Hsfs in rice (Oryza sativa). Expression of OsHsfB2b was strongly induced by heat, salt, abscisic acid (ABA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatments but was almost not affected by cold stress. Drought and salt tolerances were significantly decreased in OsHsfB2b-overexpressing transgenic rice, but were enhanced in the OsHsfB2b-RNAi transgenic rice. Under drought stress, the OsHsfB2b-overexpressing transgenic rice exhibited increased relative electrical conductivity (REC) and content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased proline content compared with the wild type, while the lower REC and MDA content and increased proline content were found in the OsHsfB2b-RNAi transgenic rice. These results suggest that OsHsfB2b functions as a negative regulator in response to drought and salt stresses in rice, with its existing B3 repression domain (BRD) that might be necessary for the repressive activity. The present study revealed the potential value of OsHsfB2b in genetic improvement of rice.
