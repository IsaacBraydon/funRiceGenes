NA	Down regulation of a heavy metal transporter gene influences several domestication traits and grain Fe-Zn content in rice.	2018	Plant Sci	Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, 500007, India. Electronic address: kapparasai@gmail.com.	Biofortification of rice (Oryza sativa L.) would alleviate iron and zinc deficiencies in the target populations. We identified two alleles 261 and 284 of a Gramineae-specific heavy metal transporter gene OsHMA7 by analyzing expression patterns and sequences of genes within QTLs for high Fe &amp; Zn, in Madhukar x Swarna recombinant inbred lines (RILs) with high (HL) or low (LL) grain Fe &amp; Zn. Overexpression of 261 allele increased grain Fe and Zn but most of the transgenic plants either did not survive or did not yield enough seeds and could not be further characterized. Knocking down expression of OsHMA7 by RNAi silencing of endogenous gene resulted in plants with altered domestication traits such as plant height, tiller number, panicle size and architecture, grain color, shape, size, grain shattering, heading date and increased sensitivity to Fe and Zn deficiency. However, overexpression of 284 allele resulted in transgenic lines with either high grain Fe &amp; Zn content (HL-ox) and tolerance to Fe and Zn deficiency or low grain Fe &amp; Zn content (LL-ox) and phenotype similar to RNAi-lines. OsHMA7 transcript levels were five-fold higher in the HL-ox plants whereas LL-ox and RNAi plants showed 2-3 fold reduced levels compared to Kitaake control. Spraying LL-ox and RNAi lines with Fe &amp; Zn at grain filling stage resulted in increased grain yield, significant increase in Fe &amp; Zn content and brown pericarp. Altered expression of OsHMA7 influenced transcript levels of iron-responsive genes indicating cellular Fe-Zn homeostasis and also several domestication-related genes in rice. Our study shows that a novel heavy metal transporter gene influences yield and grain Fe &amp; Zn content and has potential to improve rice production and biofortification.
NA	Comparative transcriptome profile analysis of rice varieties with different tolerance to zinc deficiency	2020	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	CAAS-IRRI Joint Laboratory for Genomics-Assisted Germplasm Enhancement, Agricultural Genomics Institute in Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, China.	Zinc (Zn) is an indispensable element for rice growth. Zn deficiency results in brown blotches and streaks 2-3 weeks after transplanting, as well as stunting, reduced tillering, and low productivity of rice plants. These processes are controlled by different families of expressed genes. A comparative transcriptome profile analysis was conducted using the roots of two Zn deficiency tolerant varieties (UCP122 and KALIBORO26) and two sensitive varieties (IR26 and IR64) by merging data from untreated control (CK) and Zn deficiency treated samples. Results revealed a total of 4,688 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the normal Zn and deficient conditions, with 2,702 and 1,489 unique DEGs upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis identified transcription factors (TFs), such as WRKY, MYB, ERF, and bHLH which are important in the regulation of the Zn deficiency response. Furthermore, chitinases, jasmonic acid, and phenylpropanoid pathways were found to be important in the Zn deficiency response. The metal tolerance protein (MTP) genes also appeared to play an important role in conferring tolerance to Zn deficiency. A heavy metal-associated domain-containing protein 7 was associated with tolerance to Zn deficiency and negatively regulated downstream genes. Collectively, our findings provide valuable expression patterns and candidate genes for the study of molecular mechanisms underlying the response to Zn deficiency and for improvements in breeding for tolerance to Zn deficiency in rice.
