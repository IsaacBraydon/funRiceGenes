OsHMA7	 We identified two alleles 261 and 284 of a Gramineae-specific heavy metal transporter gene OsHMA7 by analyzing expression patterns and sequences of genes within QTLs for high Fe &amp; Zn, in Madhukar x Swarna recombinant inbred lines (RILs) with high (HL) or low (LL) grain Fe &amp; Zn |  Knocking down expression of OsHMA7 by RNAi silencing of endogenous gene resulted in plants with altered domestication traits such as plant height, tiller number, panicle size and architecture, grain color, shape, size, grain shattering, heading date and increased sensitivity to Fe and Zn deficiency |  Altered expression of OsHMA7 influenced transcript levels of iron-responsive genes indicating cellular Fe-Zn homeostasis and also several domestication-related genes in rice	 Knocking down expression of OsHMA7 by RNAi silencing of endogenous gene resulted in plants with altered domestication traits such as plant height, tiller number, panicle size and architecture, grain color, shape, size, grain shattering, heading date and increased sensitivity to Fe and Zn deficiency |  OsHMA7 transcript levels were five-fold higher in the HL-ox plants whereas LL-ox and RNAi plants showed 2-3 fold reduced levels compared to Kitaake control
