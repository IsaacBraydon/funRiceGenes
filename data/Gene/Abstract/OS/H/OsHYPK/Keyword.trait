OsHYPK	resistance	OsHYPK-mediated protein N-terminal acetylation coordinates plant development and abiotic stress responses in rice.	 We found that loss of OsHYPK function leads to developmental defects in rice plant architecture but increased resistance to abiotic stresses, attributable to perturbation of the N-terminal acetylome and accelerated global protein turnover
OsHYPK	abiotic stress	OsHYPK-mediated protein N-terminal acetylation coordinates plant development and abiotic stress responses in rice.	 We found that loss of OsHYPK function leads to developmental defects in rice plant architecture but increased resistance to abiotic stresses, attributable to perturbation of the N-terminal acetylome and accelerated global protein turnover
OsHYPK	abiotic stress	OsHYPK-mediated protein N-terminal acetylation coordinates plant development and abiotic stress responses in rice.	 Furthermore, we demonstrated that OsHYPK is also a substrate of NatA and that N-terminal acetylation of OsHYPK promotes its own degradation, probably through the Ac/N-degron pathway, which could be induced by abiotic stresses
OsHYPK	biotic stress	OsHYPK-mediated protein N-terminal acetylation coordinates plant development and abiotic stress responses in rice.	 We found that loss of OsHYPK function leads to developmental defects in rice plant architecture but increased resistance to abiotic stresses, attributable to perturbation of the N-terminal acetylome and accelerated global protein turnover
