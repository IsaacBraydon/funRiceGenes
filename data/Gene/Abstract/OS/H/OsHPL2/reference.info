A pre-infestation of the white-backed planthopper (WBPH), Sogatella furcifera Horvath, conferred resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) under both laboratory and field conditions. The infestation of another planthopper species, the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens Stal, did not significantly reduce the incidence of bacterial blight symptoms. A large-scale screening using a rice DNA microarray and quantitative RT-PCR revealed that WBPH infestation caused the upregulation of more defence-related genes than did BPH infestation. Hydroperoxide lyase 2 (OsHPL2), an enzyme for producing C(6) volatiles, was upregulated by WBPH infestation, but not by BPH infestation. One C(6) volatile, (E)-2-hexenal, accumulated in rice after WBPH infestation, but not after BPH infestation. A direct application of (E)-2-hexenal to a liquid culture of Xoo inhibited the growth of the bacterium. Furthermore, a vapour treatment of rice plants with (E)-2-hexenal induced resistance to bacterial blight. OsHPL2-overexpressing transgenic rice plants exhibited increased resistance to bacterial blight. Based on these data, we conclude that OsHPL2 and its derived (E)-2-hexenal play some role in WBPH-induced resistance in rice.
Plant Cell Physiol-2004-Haga-119-28.pdf	Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Botanical Gardens, Research School of Science, Osaka City University, Kisaichi, Katano-shi, Osaka, 576-0004 Japan.	Allene oxide synthase (AOS) is a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA). We identified four AOS gene homologs, named OsAOS1-4, in the database of a japonica rice genome and cloned a full-length cDNA of OsAOS1. The analysis of deduced amino acid sequences indicated that only OsAOS1 has a chloroplast transit peptide among all the identified monocot AOSs including OsAOSs. We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots. The response in OsAOS1 transcripts occurred rapidly and transiently, while the response in OsAOS4 transcripts was slower and more sustainable; the maximal enhancement was greater in OsAOS1 transcripts than in OsAOS4 transcripts. The transcript of OsAOS1 was also up-regulated transiently in response to wounding, as reported for dicot AOSs. No wound-induced enhancement occurred, however, in OsAOS4 transcripts. Our results also indicated that OsAOS1, responding to both light and wounding, is the most highly expressed of all the OsAOSs in seedling shoots. By using phyA mutants of rice, it was demonstrated that the photoregulation of the AOS transcript level is mediated by phytochrome. It is suggested that this transcriptional photoregulation participates in the phytochrome-mediated inhibition of rice coleoptile growth.
pp1410121.pdf	Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis	2006	Plant Physiol	Section of Plant Biology, University of California, Davis, California 95616, USA.	HYDROPEROXIDE LYASE (HPL) genes encode enzymes that catalyze the cleavage of fatty acid hydroperoxides into aldehydes and oxoacids. There are three HPLs in rice (Oryza sativa), designated OsHPL1 through OsHPL3. To explore the possibility of differential functional activities among these genes, we have examined their expression patterns and biochemical properties of their encoded products. Transcript analysis indicates that these genes have distinct patterns and levels of expression. OsHPL1 is ubiquitously expressed, OsHPL2 is expressed in the leaves and leaf sheaths, whereas OsHPL3 is wound inducible and expressed exclusively in leaves. OsHPLs also differ in their substrate preference as determined by in vitro enzyme assays using 9-/13-hydroperoxy linolenic and 9-/13-hydroperoxy linoleic acids as substrates. OsHPL1 and OsHPL2 metabolize 9-/13-hydroperoxides, whereas OsHPL3 metabolizes 13-hydroperoxy linolenic acid exclusively. Sequence alignments of the HPL enzymes have identified signature residues potentially responsible for the substrate specificity/preference of these enzymes. All three OsHPLs are chloroplast localized as determined by chloroplast import assays and green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion studies. Aldehyde measurements in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants overexpressing individual OsHPL-GFP fusions indicate that all rice HPLs are functional in a heterologous system, and each of them generates a distinct signature of the metabolites. Interestingly, these aldehydes were only detectable in leaves, but not in roots, despite similar levels of OsHPL-GFP proteins in both tissues. Similarly, there were undetectable levels of aldehydes in rice roots, in spite of the presence of OsHPL1 transcripts. Together, these data suggest that additional tissue-specific mechanism(s) beyond transcript and HPL enzyme abundance, regulate the levels of HPL-derived metabolites.
NA	Cloning and functional identification of a Chilo suppressalis-inducible promoter of rice gene, OsHPL2.	2020	Pest Manag Sci	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Centre of Plant Gene Research, Wuhan, 430070, Hubei, China.	Promoter plays a key role in driving insect-resistant genes in breeding of transgenic plants. In the current transgenic breeding process of rice resistance to striped stem borer (Chilo suppressalis Walker, SSB), the constitutive promoter is used to drive insect-resistant gene. To reduce the burden of plant growth caused by constitutive promoters, isolation and identification of insect-inducible promoters are particularly significant. However, there are few promoters specifically induced by insect feeding.We found that the rice hydroperoxide lyase gene (OsHPL2) (LOC_Os02g12680) was up regulated after feeding by SSB. Subsequently, we cloned the promoter of OsHPL2 and analyzed its expression pattern using the ¦Â-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. Histochemical assays and quantitative analyses of GUS activity confirmed that PHPL2 :GUS was activated by SSB and did not respond to brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens St<U+00E5>l, BPH) infested, mechanical wounding, or phytohormone treatments. A series of 5' truncated assays were conducted and three positive regulatory regions (-1452 to -1213, -903 to -624, -376 to -176) which were induced by infestation of SSB were identified. The P2R123-min 35S and P2TR2-min 35S promoters linked with cry1C of transgenic plants showed the highest expressions of Cry1C protein and SSB larval mortalities.We identified a SSB-inducible promoter and three positive regions inside, and the transgenic rice plants with OsHPL2 promoter and its positive regions driving cry1C, exhibited expected larvicidal effect on SSB. Our study is the first report of a SSB-inducible promoter that could be used as a potential resource for breeding insect-resistant transgenic crops. This article is protected by copyright.
