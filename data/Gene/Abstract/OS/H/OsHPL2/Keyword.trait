OsAOS3|OsHPL2	leaf	Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis	 OsHPL1 is ubiquitously expressed, OsHPL2 is expressed in the leaves and leaf sheaths, whereas OsHPL3 is wound inducible and expressed exclusively in leaves

OsAOS3|OsHPL2	blight	Role of hydroperoxide lyase in white-backed planthopper (Sogatella furcifera Horvath)-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice, Oryza sativa L	 OsHPL2-overexpressing transgenic rice plants exhibited increased resistance to bacterial blight
