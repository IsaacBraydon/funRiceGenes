OsHAP3E|LEC1|OsLEC1	vegetative	Aberrant vegetative and reproductive development by overexpression and lethality by silencing of OsHAP3E in rice	The OsHAP3E-overexpressing plants showed various abnormal morphologies both in their vegetative and reproductive phases
OsHAP3E|LEC1|OsLEC1	vegetative	Aberrant vegetative and reproductive development by overexpression and lethality by silencing of OsHAP3E in rice	The OsHAP3E-overexpressing plants were dwarf with erected leaves and similar to brassinosteroid mutants in the vegetative phase
OsHAP3E|LEC1|OsLEC1	vegetative	Aberrant vegetative and reproductive development by overexpression and lethality by silencing of OsHAP3E in rice	Altogether, our loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses suggest that OsHAP3E plays important pleiotropic roles in vegetative and reproductive development or basic cellular processes in rice
