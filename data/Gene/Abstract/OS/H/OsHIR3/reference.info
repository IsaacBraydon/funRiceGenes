NA	Overexpression of Bax inhibitor-1 links plasma membrane microdomain proteins to stress.	2015	Plant Physiol	Saitama University 255 Shimo-Okubo, Sakura-ku CITY: Saitama POSTAL_CODE: 3388570 Japan [JP].	Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) is a cell death suppressor widely conserved in plants and animals. Overexpression of BI-1 enhances tolerance to stress-induced cell death in plant cells, although the molecular mechanism behind this enhancement is unclear. We recently found that Arabidopsis BI-1 is involved in metabolism of sphingolipids, such as synthesis of 2-hydroxy fatty acids (2-HFAs), suggesting the involvement of sphingolipids in the cell death regulatory mechanism downstream of BI-1. Here we show that BI-1 affects cell death-associated components localized in sphingolipid-enriched microdomains of the plasma membrane (PM) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) cells. The amount of 2-hydroxy fatty acid -containing glucosylceramide increased in the detergent-resistant membrane fraction (DRM, a biochemical counterpart of PM microdomains) obtained from BI-1 overexpressing rice cells. Comparative proteomics analysis showed quantitative changes of DRM proteins in BI-1 overexpressing cells. In particular, the protein abundance of FLOT (flotillin homolog) and HIR3 (hypersensitive-induced reaction protein 3) markedly decreased in DRM of BI-1 overexpressing cells. Loss-of-function analysis demonstrated that FLOT and HIR3 are required for cell death by oxidative stress and salicylic acid, suggesting that the decreased levels of these proteins directly contribute to the stress tolerant phenotypes in BI-1 overexpressing rice cells. These findings provide a novel biological implication of plant membrane microdomains in stress-induced cell death, which is negatively modulated by BI-1 overexpression via decreasing the abundance of a set of key proteins involved in cell death.
NA	The hypersensitive induced reaction 3 (HIR3) gene contributes to plant basal resistance via an EDS1 and salicylic acid-dependent pathway.	2019	Plant J	College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058China.	The hypersensitive induced reaction (HIR) gene family is associated with the hypersensitive response (HR) that is part of the plant defense system against bacterial and fungal pathogens. The involvement of HIR genes in response to viral pathogens has not so far been studied. We now report that the HIR3 genes of N. benthamiana and Oryza sativa were upregulated following rice stripe virus (RSV) infection. Silencing of HIR3s in N. benthamiana resulted in increased accumulation of RSV RNAs, while overexpression of HIR3s in N. benthamiana or rice reduced expression of RSV RNAs and decreased symptom severity, while also conferring resistance to Turnip mosaic virus, Potato virus X and the bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas syringae, and Xanthomonas oryzae. Silencing of HIR3s genes in N. benthamiana reduced the content of salicylic acid (SA), and was accompanied by down-regulated expression of genes in the SA pathway. Transient expression of the two HIR3 gene homologues from N. benthamiana or the rice HIR3 gene in N. benthamiana leaves caused cell death and accumulation of SA but did not do so in EDS1-silenced plants or those expressing NahG. The results indicate that HIR3 contributes to plant basal resistance via an EDS1 and salicylic acid dependent pathway. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
