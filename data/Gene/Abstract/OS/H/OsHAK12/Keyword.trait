OsHAK12	xylem	Rice Na(+)-Permeable Transporter OsHAK12 Mediates Shoots Na(+) Exclusion in Response to Salt Stress.	 The Oshak12 mutants showed sensitivity to salt toxicity and accumulated more Na(+) in the xylem sap, leading to excessive Na(+) in the shoots and less Na(+) in the roots
OsHAK12	xylem	Rice Na(+)-Permeable Transporter OsHAK12 Mediates Shoots Na(+) Exclusion in Response to Salt Stress.	 These findings indicate that OsHAK12 mediates Na(+) exclusion from shoot, possibly by retrieving Na(+) from xylem vessel thereby reducing Na(+) content in the shoots
OsHAK12	root	Rice Na(+)-Permeable Transporter OsHAK12 Mediates Shoots Na(+) Exclusion in Response to Salt Stress.	 In addition, OsHAK12 was strongly expressed in the root vascular tissues and induced by salt stress
OsHAK12	salt	Rice Na(+)-Permeable Transporter OsHAK12 Mediates Shoots Na(+) Exclusion in Response to Salt Stress.	Rice Na(+)-Permeable Transporter OsHAK12 Mediates Shoots Na(+) Exclusion in Response to Salt Stress.

OsHAK12	transporter	Rice Na(+)-Permeable Transporter OsHAK12 Mediates Shoots Na(+) Exclusion in Response to Salt Stress.	Rice Na(+)-Permeable Transporter OsHAK12 Mediates Shoots Na(+) Exclusion in Response to Salt Stress.
OsHAK12	transporter	Rice Na(+)-Permeable Transporter OsHAK12 Mediates Shoots Na(+) Exclusion in Response to Salt Stress.	 Unlike typical HAK family transporters that transport K(+), OsHAK12 is a Na(+)-permeable plasma membrane transporter
OsHAK12	plasma membrane	Rice Na(+)-Permeable Transporter OsHAK12 Mediates Shoots Na(+) Exclusion in Response to Salt Stress.	 Unlike typical HAK family transporters that transport K(+), OsHAK12 is a Na(+)-permeable plasma membrane transporter
