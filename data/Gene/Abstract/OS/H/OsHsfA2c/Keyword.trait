OsHSF6|OsHsfA2c	seed	Isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding two novel heat-shock factor OsHSF6 and OsHSF12 in Oryza sativa L	 The results of RT-PCR indicated OsHSF6 gene was expressed immediately after rice plants exposure to heat stress, and the transcription of OsHSF6 gene accumulated primarily in immature seeds, roots and leaves
OsHSF6|OsHsfA2c	transcription factor	Isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding two novel heat-shock factor OsHSF6 and OsHSF12 in Oryza sativa L	 Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that OsHSF6 was a class A heat shock factor (HSF) with all the conserved sequence elements characteristic of heat stress transcription factor, while OsHSF12 was a class B HSF with C-terminal domain (CTD) lacking of AHA motif
OsHSF6|OsHsfA2c	root	Isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding two novel heat-shock factor OsHSF6 and OsHSF12 in Oryza sativa L	 The results of RT-PCR indicated OsHSF6 gene was expressed immediately after rice plants exposure to heat stress, and the transcription of OsHSF6 gene accumulated primarily in immature seeds, roots and leaves
