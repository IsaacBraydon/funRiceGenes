OsHAK18	seedlings	Rice potassium transporter OsHAK18 mediates phloem K(+) loading and redistribution.	 Disruption of OsHAK18 rendered rice seedlings insensitive to low-K(+) (LK) stress
OsHAK18	xylem	Rice potassium transporter OsHAK18 mediates phloem K(+) loading and redistribution.	 Disruption of OsHAK18 does not affect root K(+) uptake and K(+) level in xylem sap, but it significantly decreases phloem K(+) concentration and inhibits root-to-shoot-to-root K(+) (Rb(+) ) translocation in split-root assay
OsHAK18	root	Rice potassium transporter OsHAK18 mediates phloem K(+) loading and redistribution.	 Disruption of OsHAK18 does not affect root K(+) uptake and K(+) level in xylem sap, but it significantly decreases phloem K(+) concentration and inhibits root-to-shoot-to-root K(+) (Rb(+) ) translocation in split-root assay
OsHAK18	shoot	Rice potassium transporter OsHAK18 mediates phloem K(+) loading and redistribution.	 These results reveal that OsHAK18 mediates phloem K(+) loading and redistribution, whose disruption is in favor of shoot K(+) retention under LK stress
OsHAK18	stress	Rice potassium transporter OsHAK18 mediates phloem K(+) loading and redistribution.	 Disruption of OsHAK18 rendered rice seedlings insensitive to low-K(+) (LK) stress
OsHAK18	stress	Rice potassium transporter OsHAK18 mediates phloem K(+) loading and redistribution.	 These results reveal that OsHAK18 mediates phloem K(+) loading and redistribution, whose disruption is in favor of shoot K(+) retention under LK stress
OsHAK18	potassium	Rice potassium transporter OsHAK18 mediates phloem K(+) loading and redistribution.	Rice potassium transporter OsHAK18 mediates phloem K(+) loading and redistribution.
OsHAK18	transporter	Rice potassium transporter OsHAK18 mediates phloem K(+) loading and redistribution.	Rice potassium transporter OsHAK18 mediates phloem K(+) loading and redistribution.
OsHAK18	phloem	Rice potassium transporter OsHAK18 mediates phloem K(+) loading and redistribution.	Rice potassium transporter OsHAK18 mediates phloem K(+) loading and redistribution.
OsHAK18	phloem	Rice potassium transporter OsHAK18 mediates phloem K(+) loading and redistribution.	 Disruption of OsHAK18 does not affect root K(+) uptake and K(+) level in xylem sap, but it significantly decreases phloem K(+) concentration and inhibits root-to-shoot-to-root K(+) (Rb(+) ) translocation in split-root assay
OsHAK18	phloem	Rice potassium transporter OsHAK18 mediates phloem K(+) loading and redistribution.	 These results reveal that OsHAK18 mediates phloem K(+) loading and redistribution, whose disruption is in favor of shoot K(+) retention under LK stress
