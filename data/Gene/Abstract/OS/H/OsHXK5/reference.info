Hexokinase (HXK) is a dual-function enzyme that both phosphorylates hexose to form hexose 6-phosphate and plays an important role in sugar sensing and signaling. To investigate the roles of hexokinases in rice growth and development, we analyzed rice sequence databases and isolated ten rice hexokinase cDNAs, OsHXK1 (Oryza sativa Hexokinase 1) through OsHXK10. With the exception of the single-exon gene OsHXK1, the OsHXKs all have a highly conserved genomic structure consisting of nine exons and eight introns. Gene expression profiling revealed that OsHXK2 through OsHXK9 are expressed ubiquitously in various organs, whereas OsHXK10 expression is pollen-specific. Sugars induced the expression of three OsHXKs, OsHXK2, OsHXK5, and OsHXK6, in excised leaves, while suppressing OsHXK7 expression in excised leaves and immature seeds. The hexokinase activity of the OsHXKs was confirmed by functional complementation of the hexokinase-deficient yeast strain YSH7.4-3C (hxk1, hxk2, glk1). OsHXK4 was able to complement this mutant only after the chloroplast-transit peptide was removed. The subcellular localization of OsHXK4 and OsHXK7, observed with green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion constructs, indicated that OsHXK4 is a plastid-stroma-targeted hexokinase while OsHXK7 localizes to the cytosol.
pp1490745.pdf	Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors	2009	Plant Physiol	Plant Metabolism Research Center and Graduate School of Biotechnology, Department of Horticultural Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 446-701, Korea.	The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) hexokinase 1 (AtHXK1) is recognized as an important glucose (Glc) sensor. However, the function of hexokinases as Glc sensors has not been clearly demonstrated in other plant species, including rice (Oryza sativa). To investigate the functions of rice hexokinase isoforms, we characterized OsHXK5 and OsHXK6, which are evolutionarily related to AtHXK1. Transient expression analyses using GFP fusion constructs revealed that OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 are associated with mitochondria. Interestingly, the OsHXK5DeltamTP-GFP and OsHXK6DeltamTP-GFP fusion proteins, which lack N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptides, were present mainly in the nucleus with a small amount of the proteins seen in the cytosol. In addition, the OsHXK5NLS-GFP and OsHXK6NLS-GFP fusion proteins harboring nuclear localization signals were targeted predominantly in the nucleus, suggesting that these OsHXKs retain a dual-targeting ability to mitochondria and nuclei. In transient expression assays using promoterluciferase fusion constructs, these two OsHXKs and their catalytically inactive alleles dramatically enhanced the Glc-dependent repression of the maize (Zea mays) Rubisco small subunit (RbcS) and rice alpha-amylase genes in mesophyll protoplasts of maize and rice. Notably, the expression of OsHXK5, OsHXK6, or their mutant alleles complemented the Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2-1 mutant, thereby resulting in wild-type characteristics in seedling development, Glc-dependent gene expression, and plant growth. Furthermore, transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsHXK5 or OsHXK6 exhibited hypersensitive plant growth retardation and enhanced repression of the photosynthetic gene RbcS in response to Glc treatment. These results provide evidence that rice OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 can function as Glc sensors.
NA	Deficiency of rice hexokinase HXK5 impairs synthesis and utilization of starch in pollen grains and causes male sterility.	2019	J Exp Bot	Graduate School of Biotechnology &amp; Crop Biotech Institute, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Korea.	There is little known about the function of rice hexokinases (HXKs) in planta. We characterized hxk5-1, a Tos17 mutant of OsHXK5 that is up-regulated in maturing pollen, a stage when starch accumulates. Progeny analysis of self-pollinated heterozygotes of hxk5-1 and reciprocal crosses between the wild-type and heterozygotes revealed that loss of HXK5 causes male sterility. Homozygous hxk5-1, produced via anther culture, and additional homozygous hxk5-2, hxk5-3 and hxk5-4 lines created by CRISPR/Cas9 confirmed the male-sterile phenotype. In vitro pollen germination ability and in vivo pollen tube growth rate were significantly reduced in the hxk5 mutant pollen. Biochemical analysis of anthers with the mutant pollen revealed significantly reduced hexokinase activity and starch content, although they were sufficient to produce some viable seed. However, the mutant pollen was unable to compete successfully against wild-type pollen. Expression of the catalytically inactive OsHXK5-G113D did not rescue the hxk5 male-sterile phenotype, indicating that its catalytic function was responsible for pollen fertility, rather than its role in sugar sensing and signaling. Our results demonstrate that OsHXK5 contributes to a large portion of the hexokinase activity necessary for the starch utilization pathway during pollen germination and tube growth, as well as for starch biosynthesis during pollen maturation.
