OsHXK5	seedling	Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors	Notably, the expression of OsHXK5, OsHXK6, or their mutant alleles complemented the Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2-1 mutant, thereby resulting in wild-type characteristics in seedling development, Glc-dependent gene expression, and plant growth
OsHXK5	growth	Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors	Notably, the expression of OsHXK5, OsHXK6, or their mutant alleles complemented the Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2-1 mutant, thereby resulting in wild-type characteristics in seedling development, Glc-dependent gene expression, and plant growth
OsHXK5	growth	Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors	Furthermore, transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsHXK5 or OsHXK6 exhibited hypersensitive plant growth retardation and enhanced repression of the photosynthetic gene RbcS in response to Glc treatment
OsHXK5	mitochondria	Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors	Transient expression analyses using GFP fusion constructs revealed that OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 are associated with mitochondria
OsHXK5	mitochondria	Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors	Interestingly, the OsHXK5DeltamTP-GFP and OsHXK6DeltamTP-GFP fusion proteins, which lack N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptides, were present mainly in the nucleus with a small amount of the proteins seen in the cytosol
OsHXK5	mitochondria	Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors	In addition, the OsHXK5NLS-GFP and OsHXK6NLS-GFP fusion proteins harboring nuclear localization signals were targeted predominantly in the nucleus, suggesting that these OsHXKs retain a dual-targeting ability to mitochondria and nuclei
OsHXK5	seed	Structure, expression, and functional analysis of the hexokinase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Sugars induced the expression of three OsHXKs, OsHXK2, OsHXK5, and OsHXK6, in excised leaves, while suppressing OsHXK7 expression in excised leaves and immature seeds
OsHXK5	pollen	Deficiency of rice hexokinase HXK5 impairs synthesis and utilization of starch in pollen grains and causes male sterility.	 Our results demonstrate that OsHXK5 contributes to a large portion of the hexokinase activity necessary for the starch utilization pathway during pollen germination and tube growth, as well as for starch biosynthesis during pollen maturation
OsHXK5	starch	Deficiency of rice hexokinase HXK5 impairs synthesis and utilization of starch in pollen grains and causes male sterility.	 We characterized hxk5-1, a Tos17 mutant of OsHXK5 that is up-regulated in maturing pollen, a stage when starch accumulates
OsHXK5	starch	Deficiency of rice hexokinase HXK5 impairs synthesis and utilization of starch in pollen grains and causes male sterility.	 Our results demonstrate that OsHXK5 contributes to a large portion of the hexokinase activity necessary for the starch utilization pathway during pollen germination and tube growth, as well as for starch biosynthesis during pollen maturation
OsHXK5	starch biosynthesis	Deficiency of rice hexokinase HXK5 impairs synthesis and utilization of starch in pollen grains and causes male sterility.	 Our results demonstrate that OsHXK5 contributes to a large portion of the hexokinase activity necessary for the starch utilization pathway during pollen germination and tube growth, as well as for starch biosynthesis during pollen maturation
