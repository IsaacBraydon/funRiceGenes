NA	Overexpression of Rice Histone H1 Gene Reduces Tolerance to Cold and Heat Stress.	2023	Plants (Basel)	Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.	and high-temperature stresses, are the main abiotic stresses affecting rice yield. Due to global climate change, the impact of temperature pressure on rice yield is gradually increasing, which is also a major concern for researchers. In this study, an H1 histone in Oryza sativa (OsHis1.1, LOC_Os04g18090) was cloned, and its role in rice&#x27;s response to temperature stresses was functionally characterized. The GUS staining analysis of OsHis1.1 promoter-GUS transgenic rice showed that OsHis1.1 was widely expressed in various rice tissues. Transient expression demonstrated that OsHis1.1 was localized in the nucleus. The overexpression of OsHis1.1 reduces the tolerance to temperature stress in rice by inhibiting the expression of genes that are responsive to heat and cold stress. Under stress conditions, the POD activity and chlorophyll and proline contents of OsHis1.1-overexpression rice lines were significantly lower than those of the wild type, while the malondialdehyde content was higher than that of the wild type. Compared with Nip, OsHis1.1-overexpression rice suffered more serious oxidative stress and cell damage under temperature stress. Furthermore, OsHis1.1-overexpression rice showed changes in agronomic traits.
