OsHI-XIP	growth	Overexpression of a Xylanase Inhibitor Gene, OsHI-XIP, Enhances Resistance in Rice to Herbivores	Moreover, overexpression of OsHI-XIP decreased the feeding and oviposion preferences of the rice brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, but did not influence the growth and development of rice plants
OsHI-XIP	resistance	Overexpression of a Xylanase Inhibitor Gene, OsHI-XIP, Enhances Resistance in Rice to Herbivores	The results suggest that the rice XIP-type xylanase inhibitor OsHI-XIP is involved in the resistance in rice to herbivores
OsHI-XIP	development	Overexpression of a Xylanase Inhibitor Gene, OsHI-XIP, Enhances Resistance in Rice to Herbivores	Moreover, overexpression of OsHI-XIP decreased the feeding and oviposion preferences of the rice brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, but did not influence the growth and development of rice plants
OsHI-XIP	brown planthopper	Overexpression of a Xylanase Inhibitor Gene, OsHI-XIP, Enhances Resistance in Rice to Herbivores	Moreover, overexpression of OsHI-XIP decreased the feeding and oviposion preferences of the rice brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, but did not influence the growth and development of rice plants
