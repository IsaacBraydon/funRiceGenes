OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8	OsNHA1|OsSOS1	Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 In addition, lower expression of OsHKT1;5 and OsSOS1 in old leaves may decrease frequency of retrieving Na+ from old leaf cells
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8	A conserved primary salt tolerance mechanism mediated by HKT transporters: a mechanism for sodium exclusion and maintenance of high K(+)/Na(+) ratio in leaves during salinity stress	 Here we present a review on vital physiological functions of HKT transporters including AtHKT1;1 and OsHKT1;5 in preventing shoot Na(+) over-accumulation by mediating Na(+) exclusion from xylem vessels in the presence of a large amount of Na(+) thereby protecting leaves from salinity stress
OsHKT1;4	OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8	A two-staged model of Na+ exclusion in rice explained by 3D modeling of HKT transporters and alternative splicing	 Amongst these transporters, the cereal HKT1;4 and HKT1;5 are responsible for Na(+) exclusion from photosynthetic tissues, a key mechanism for plant salinity tolerance
