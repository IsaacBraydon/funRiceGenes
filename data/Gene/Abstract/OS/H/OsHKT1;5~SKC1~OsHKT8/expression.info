OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8|OsHK1;5	Changes in Expression Level of OsHKT1;5 Alters Activity of Membrane Transporters Involved in K + and Ca 2+ Acquisition and Homeostasis in Salinized Rice Roots 
OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8|OsHK1;5	 Furthermore, expression analysis suggested that OsGrx_C7 acted as positive regulator of salt tolerance by reinforcing the expression of transporters (OsHKT2;1, OsHKT1;5 and OsSOS1) engaged in Na+ homeostasis in overexpressing plants
OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8|OsHK1;5	 Intriguingly, salt stress facilitates the nuclear relocation of OsDNAJ15 so that it can interact with OsBAG4, and OsDNAJ15 and OsBAG4 synergistically facilitate the DNA-binding activity of OsMYB106 to positively regulate the expression of OsHKT1;5
OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8|OsHK1;5	 The real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and transcriptome analysis revealed that OsWRKY54 regulated the expression of some essential genes related to salt tolerance, such as OsNHX4 and OsHKT1;5 |  Furthermore, OsWRKY54 was found to regulate OsHKT1;5 expression by directly binding to the W-box motif in its promoter
OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8|OsHK1;5	 The expression characteristics of chlorophyll fluorescence genes (OsABCI7 and OsHCF222) and ion transporter protein genes (OsHKT1;5, OsHKT2;1, OsHAK21, OsAKT2, OsNHX1, and OsSOS1) were analyzed
