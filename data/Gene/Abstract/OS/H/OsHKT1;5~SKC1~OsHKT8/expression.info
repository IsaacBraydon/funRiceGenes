OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8|OsHK1;5	Changes in Expression Level of OsHKT1;5 Alters Activity of Membrane Transporters Involved in K + and Ca 2+ Acquisition and Homeostasis in Salinized Rice Roots 
OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8|OsHK1;5	 Furthermore, expression analysis suggested that OsGrx_C7 acted as positive regulator of salt tolerance by reinforcing the expression of transporters (OsHKT2;1, OsHKT1;5 and OsSOS1) engaged in Na+ homeostasis in overexpressing plants
OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8|OsHK1;5	 Intriguingly, salt stress facilitates the nuclear relocation of OsDNAJ15 so that it can interact with OsBAG4, and OsDNAJ15 and OsBAG4 synergistically facilitate the DNA-binding activity of OsMYB106 to positively regulate the expression of OsHKT1;5
