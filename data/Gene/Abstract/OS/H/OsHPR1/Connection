OsHPR1	OsHPR2	Two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice	 In this study, we constructed overexpression of the OsHPR1 gene and RNA interference plants of OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 genes in rice (Oryza sativa L| These findings demonstrate that two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice|Two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice| Results from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot, and enzyme assays showed that HPR1 activity changed significantly in corresponding transgenic lines without any effect on HPR2 activity, which is the same for HPR2| Furthermore, HPR1 and HPR2 proteins were located to the peroxisome and cytosol, respectively, by transient expression experiment| Double mutant hpr1 x hpr2 was generated by crossing individual mutant of hpr1 and hpr2| The phenotype typical of photorespiration mutants was observed only where activity of both HPR1 and HPR2 were downregulated in the same line
