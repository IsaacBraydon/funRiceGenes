OsHAK2	OsHAK5	Rice sodium-insensitive potassium transporter, OsHAK5, confers increased salt tolerance in tobacco BY2 cells	Here, in search for Na(+)-insensitive K(+) transporter for this purpose, bacterial expression system was used to characterize two K(+) transporters, OsHAK2 and OsHAK5, isolated from rice (Oryza sativa cv
OsHAK2	OsHAK5	Rice sodium-insensitive potassium transporter, OsHAK5, confers increased salt tolerance in tobacco BY2 cells	Under the condition with a large amount of extracellular Na(+), we found that OsHAK5 functions as a Na(+)-insensitive K(+) transporter, while OsHAK2 is sensitive to extracellular Na(+) and exhibits higher Na(+) over K(+) transport activities
OsHAK5	OsSIDP366	OsSIDP366, a DUF1644 gene, positively regulates responses to drought and salt stresses in rice	Digital gene expression (DGE) profile analysis indicated that stress related genes such as SNAC1, OsHAK5 and PRs were up-regulated in OsSIDP366-overexpressing plants.
OsAKT1	OsHAK5	Calcium lignosulfonate improves proliferation of recalcitrant indica rice callus via modulation of auxin biosynthesis and enhancement of nutrient absorption	 Consistently, increased of potassium protein kinases genes (OsAKT1, OsHAK5, OsCBL, OsCIPK23 and OsCamk1) were also recorded
OsCIPK23	OsHAK5	Calcium lignosulfonate improves proliferation of recalcitrant indica rice callus via modulation of auxin biosynthesis and enhancement of nutrient absorption	 Consistently, increased of potassium protein kinases genes (OsAKT1, OsHAK5, OsCBL, OsCIPK23 and OsCamk1) were also recorded
