OsHAK5	 We determined its cellular and tissue localization and analyzed its functions in rice using both OsHAK5 knockout mutants and overexpression lines in three genetic backgrounds |  A Î²-glucuronidase reporter driven by the OsHAK5 native promoter indicated OsHAK5 expression in various tissue organs from root to seed, abundantly in root epidermis and stele, the vascular tissues, and mesophyll cells |  Net K influx rate in roots and K transport from roots to aerial parts were severely impaired by OsHAK5 knockout but increased by OsHAK5 overexpression in 0 |  Overexpression of OsHAK5 increased the K-sodium concentration ratio in the shoots and salt stress tolerance (shoot growth), while knockout of OsHAK5 decreased the K-sodium concentration ratio in the shoots, resulting in sensitivity to salt stress	 We determined its cellular and tissue localization and analyzed its functions in rice using both OsHAK5 knockout mutants and overexpression lines in three genetic backgrounds |  Net K influx rate in roots and K transport from roots to aerial parts were severely impaired by OsHAK5 knockout but increased by OsHAK5 overexpression in 0 |  Overexpression of OsHAK5 increased the K-sodium concentration ratio in the shoots and salt stress tolerance (shoot growth), while knockout of OsHAK5 decreased the K-sodium concentration ratio in the shoots, resulting in sensitivity to salt stress
OsHAK5	 Here, we show that inactivation of OsHAK5, a rice K+ transporter gene, decreased rootward and shootward PAT, tiller number, and the length of both lateral roots and root hairs, while OsHAK5 overexpression increased PAT, tiller number, and root hair length, irrespective of the K+ supply |  Inhibitors of ATP-binding-cassette type-B transporters, NPA and BUM, abolished the OsHAK5-overexpression effect on PAT	 Here, we show that inactivation of OsHAK5, a rice K+ transporter gene, decreased rootward and shootward PAT, tiller number, and the length of both lateral roots and root hairs, while OsHAK5 overexpression increased PAT, tiller number, and root hair length, irrespective of the K+ supply |  Inhibitors of ATP-binding-cassette type-B transporters, NPA and BUM, abolished the OsHAK5-overexpression effect on PAT
OsHAK5	Overexpression of OsHAK5 potassium transporter enhances virus resistance in rice (Oryza sativa). |  In contrast, overexpression of OsHAK5 enhanced resistance to RGSV infection |  Our analysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including H(2) O(2) and O(2-) , by DAB and NBT staining, respectively, indicated that RGSV infection as well as OsHAK5 overexpression increased ROS accumulation in rice leaves |  The accumulation of ROS is perhaps involved in the induction of host resistance against RGSV infection in OsHAK5 transgenic overexpression rice plants	Overexpression of OsHAK5 potassium transporter enhances virus resistance in rice (Oryza sativa). |  In contrast, overexpression of OsHAK5 enhanced resistance to RGSV infection |  Our analysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including H(2) O(2) and O(2-) , by DAB and NBT staining, respectively, indicated that RGSV infection as well as OsHAK5 overexpression increased ROS accumulation in rice leaves |  The accumulation of ROS is perhaps involved in the induction of host resistance against RGSV infection in OsHAK5 transgenic overexpression rice plants
