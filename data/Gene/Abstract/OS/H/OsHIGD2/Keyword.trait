OsHIGD2	leaf	A novel rice protein family of OsHIGDs may be involved in early signalling of hypoxia-promoted stem growth in deepwater rice.	 Transient expression of OsHIGD2 in leaf epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana provided evidence that the protein is localized to mitochondria
OsHIGD2	submergence	A novel rice protein family of OsHIGDs may be involved in early signalling of hypoxia-promoted stem growth in deepwater rice.	 Among the genes, OsHIGD2 showed the fastest and strongest induction by hypoxia as well as submergence
OsHIGD2	mitochondria	A novel rice protein family of OsHIGDs may be involved in early signalling of hypoxia-promoted stem growth in deepwater rice.	 Transient expression of OsHIGD2 in leaf epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana provided evidence that the protein is localized to mitochondria
