04.pdf	Cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding an 18.0-kDa class-I low-molecular-weight heat-shock protein from rice	1995	Gene	Department of Botany, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.	A novel cDNA clone, Oshp18.0 cDNA, encoding a rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Tainong 67) 18.0-kDa heat-shock protein (HSP), was isolated from a cDNA library of heat-shocked rice seedlings by use of the rice HSP cDNA, Oshsp17.3 cDNA, as a probe. The sequence showed that Oshsp18.0 cDNA contains a 749-bp insert encoding an ORF of 160 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 18.0 kDa and a pI of 7.3. Sequence comparison reveals that Oshsp18.0 cDNA is highly homologous to other low-molecular-weight (LMW) HSP cDNAs. Also, the results of hybrid-selected in vitro translation clearly establish that Oshsp18.0 cDNA is the rice 18.0-kDa LMW HSP-encoding cDNA clone. The recombinant Oshsp18.0 fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli was of the size predicted, and was recognized by the class-I rice 16.9-kDa HSP antiserum. The results suggest that Oshsp18.0 cDNA is an 18.0-kDa class-I LMW HSP- encoding cDNA clone from rice.
NA	A Class II small heat shock protein OsHsp18.0 plays positive roles in both biotic and abiotic defense responses in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	College of Chemistry and Life Sciences, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua, Zhejiang, 321004, China.	Bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is one of the most devastating diseases of rice. However, the molecular mechanism underpinning the Xoo resistance of rice is still not fully understood. Here, we report that a class II small heat shock protein gene, OsHsp18.0, whose expression was differentially induced between a resistant and a susceptible variety in response to Xoo infection, plays positive roles in both biotic and abiotic resistance. The molecular chaperone activity of OsHsp18.0 was confirmed by a bacterium-expressed glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Overexpression of OsHsp18.0 in a susceptible rice variety significantly enhanced its resistance to multiple Xoo strains, whereas silencing of OsHsp18.0 in a resistant variety drastically increased its susceptibility. The enhanced Xoo resistance in OsHsp18.0-overexpressing lines was positively correlated with the sensitized salicylic acid-dependent defense responses. In addition to disease resistance, the OsHsp18.0 overexpressing and silencing lines exhibited enhanced and reduced tolerance, respectively, to heat and salt treatments. The subcellular localization study revealed that the green fluorescent protein-OsHsp18.0 was enriched on the nuclear envelope, suggesting a potential role of OsHsp18.0 in the nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking. Together, our results reveal that the rice OsHsp18.0 is a positive regulator in both biotic and abiotic defense responses.
NA	OsMSR3, a Small Heat Shock Protein, Confers Enhanced Tolerance to Copper Stress in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2019	Int J Mol Sci	Key Laboratory of Agro-ecological Processes in Subtropical Region, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changsha 410125, China.	Copper is a mineral element essential for the normal growth and development of plants; however, excessive levels can severely affect plant growth and development. Oryza sativa L. multiple stress-responsive gene 3 (OsMSR3) is a small, low-molecular-weight heat shock protein (HSP) gene. A previous study has shown that OsMSR3 expression improves the tolerance of Arabidopsis to cadmium stress. However, the role of OsMSR3 in the Cu stress response of plants remains unclear, and, thus, this study aimed to elucidate this phenomenon in Arabidopsis thaliana, to further understand the role of small HSPs (sHSPs) in heavy metal resistance in plants. Under Cu stress, transgenic A. thaliana expressing OsMSR3 showed higher tolerance to Cu, longer roots, higher survival rates, biomass, and relative water content, and accumulated more Cu, abscisic acid (ABA), hydrogen peroxide, chlorophyll, carotenoid, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidase than wild-type plants did. Moreover, OsMSR3 expression in A. thaliana increased the expression of antioxidant-related and ABA-responsive genes. Collectively, our findings suggest that OsMSR3 played an important role in regulating Cu tolerance in plants and improved their tolerance to Cu stress through enhanced activation of antioxidative defense mechanisms and positive regulation of ABA-responsive gene expression.
