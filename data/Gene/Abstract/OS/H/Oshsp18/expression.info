OsHsp18.0-CI|Oshsp18.0|OsMSR3	 A previous study has shown that OsMSR3 expression improves the tolerance of Arabidopsis to cadmium stress |  Moreover, OsMSR3 expression in A |  Collectively, our findings suggest that OsMSR3 played an important role in regulating Cu tolerance in plants and improved their tolerance to Cu stress through enhanced activation of antioxidative defense mechanisms and positive regulation of ABA-responsive gene expression
