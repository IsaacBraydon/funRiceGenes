OsHsp18.0-CI|Oshsp18.0|OsMSR3	defense	A Class II small heat shock protein OsHsp18.0 plays positive roles in both biotic and abiotic defense responses in rice.	A Class II small heat shock protein OsHsp18.0 plays positive roles in both biotic and abiotic defense responses in rice.
OsHsp18.0-CI|Oshsp18.0|OsMSR3	defense response	A Class II small heat shock protein OsHsp18.0 plays positive roles in both biotic and abiotic defense responses in rice.	A Class II small heat shock protein OsHsp18.0 plays positive roles in both biotic and abiotic defense responses in rice.
OsHsp18.0-CI|Oshsp18.0|OsMSR3	resistance	OsMSR3, a Small Heat Shock Protein, Confers Enhanced Tolerance to Copper Stress in Arabidopsis thaliana.	 However, the role of OsMSR3 in the Cu stress response of plants remains unclear, and, thus, this study aimed to elucidate this phenomenon in Arabidopsis thaliana, to further understand the role of small HSPs (sHSPs) in heavy metal resistance in plants
OsHsp18.0-CI|Oshsp18.0|OsMSR3	defense	OsMSR3, a Small Heat Shock Protein, Confers Enhanced Tolerance to Copper Stress in Arabidopsis thaliana.	 Collectively, our findings suggest that OsMSR3 played an important role in regulating Cu tolerance in plants and improved their tolerance to Cu stress through enhanced activation of antioxidative defense mechanisms and positive regulation of ABA-responsive gene expression
OsHsp18.0-CI|Oshsp18.0|OsMSR3	tolerance	OsMSR3, a Small Heat Shock Protein, Confers Enhanced Tolerance to Copper Stress in Arabidopsis thaliana.	 A previous study has shown that OsMSR3 expression improves the tolerance of Arabidopsis to cadmium stress
OsHsp18.0-CI|Oshsp18.0|OsMSR3	tolerance	OsMSR3, a Small Heat Shock Protein, Confers Enhanced Tolerance to Copper Stress in Arabidopsis thaliana.	 thaliana expressing OsMSR3 showed higher tolerance to Cu, longer roots, higher survival rates, biomass, and relative water content, and accumulated more Cu, abscisic acid (ABA), hydrogen peroxide, chlorophyll, carotenoid, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidase than wild-type plants did
OsHsp18.0-CI|Oshsp18.0|OsMSR3	tolerance	OsMSR3, a Small Heat Shock Protein, Confers Enhanced Tolerance to Copper Stress in Arabidopsis thaliana.	 Collectively, our findings suggest that OsMSR3 played an important role in regulating Cu tolerance in plants and improved their tolerance to Cu stress through enhanced activation of antioxidative defense mechanisms and positive regulation of ABA-responsive gene expression
