Hsu-2013-Cobalt chloride-indu.pdf	Cobalt chloride-induced lateral root formation in rice: the role of heme oxygenase	2013	J Plant Physiol	Department of Agronomy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.	Lateral roots (LRs) perform the essential tasks of providing water, nutrients, and physical support to plants. Therefore, understanding the regulation of LR development is of agronomic importance. Recent findings suggest that heme oxygenase (HO) plays an important role in LR development. In this study, we examined the effect of cobalt chloride (CoCl2) on LR formation and HO expression in rice. Treatment with CoCl2 induced LR formation and HO activity. We further observed that CoCl2 could induce the expression of OsHO1 but not OsHO2. CoCl2-increased HO activity occurred before LR formation. Zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX, the specific inhibitor of HO) and hemoglobin (the carbon monoxide/nitric oxide scavenger) reduced LR formation, HO activity, and OsHO1 expression. Application of biliverdin, a product of HO-catalyzed reaction, to CoCl2-treated rice seedlings reversed the ZnPPIX-inhibited LR formation and ZnPPIX-decreased HO activity. CoCl2 had no effect on H2O2 content and nitric oxide production. Moreover, application of ascorbate, a H2O2 scavenger, failed to affect CoCl2-promoted LR formation and HO activity. It is concluded that HO is required for CoCl2-promoted LR formation in rice.
Hsu-2013-Methyl jasmonate-ind.pdf	Methyl jasmonate-induced lateral root formation in rice: the role of heme oxygenase and calcium	2013	J Plant Physiol	Department of Agronomy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.	Lateral roots (LRs) play important roles in increasing the absorptive capacity of roots as well as to anchor the plant in the soil. Therefore, understanding the regulation of LR development is of agronomic importance. In this study, we examined the effect of methyl jasmonate (MJ) on LR formation in rice. Treatment with MJ induced LR formation and heme oxygenase (HO) activity. As well, MJ could induce OsHO1 mRNA expression. Zinc protoporphyrin IX (the specific inhibitor of HO) and hemoglobin [the carbon monoxide/nitric oxide (NO) scavenger] reduced LR formation, HO activity and OsHO1 expression. LR formation and HO activity induced by MJ was reduced by the specific NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-oxide. The effects of Ca(2+) chelators, Ca(2+)-channel inhibitors, and calmodulin (CaM) antagonists on LR formation induced by MJ were also examined. All these inhibitors were effective in reducing the action of MJ. However, Ca(2+) chelators and Ca(2+) channel inhibitors induced HO activity when combining with MJ further. It is concluded that Ca(2+) may regulate MJ action mainly through CaM-dependent mechanism.
NA	Young Leaf Chlorosis 2 encodes the stroma-localized heme oxygenase 2 which is required for normal tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in rice	2014	Planta	State Key Laboratory Breeding Base for Zhejiang Sustainable Pest and Disease Control, Institute of Crops and Nuclear Technology Utilization, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, 310021, China.	Rice heme oxygenase 2 (OsHO2) mutants are chlorophyll deficient with distinct tetrapyrrole metabolite and transcript profiles, suggesting a potential regulatory role of the stromal-localized OsHO2 in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. In plants, heme oxygenases (HOs) are classified into the subfamilies HO1 and HO2. HO1 are highly conserved plastid enzymes required for synthesizing the chromophore in phytochromes which mediate a number of light-regulated responses. However, the physiological and biochemical functions of HO2, which are distantly related to HO1, are not well understood, especially in crop plants. From a population of (60)Co¦Ã-irradiated rice mutants, we identified the ylc2 (young leaf chlorosis 2) mutant which displays a chlorosis phenotype in seedlings with substantially reduced chlorophyll content. Normal leaf pigmentation is gradually restored in older plants while newly emerged leaves remain yellow. Transmission electron microscopy further revealed defective chloroplast structures in the ylc2 seedlings. Map-based cloning located the OsYLC2 gene on chromosome 3 and it encodes the OsHO2 protein. The gene identification was confirmed by complementation and T-DNA mutant analyses. Subcellular localization and chloroplast fractionation experiments indicated that OsHO2 resides in the stroma. However, recombinant enzyme assay demonstrated that OsHO2 is not a functional HO enzyme. Analysis of tetrapyrrole metabolites revealed the reduced levels of most chlorophyll and phytochromobilin precursors in the ylc2 mutant. On the other hand, elevated accumulation of 5-aminolevulinic acid and Mg-protoporphyrin IX was observed. These unique metabolite changes are accompanied by consistent changes in the expression levels of the corresponding tetrapyrrole biosynthesis genes. Taken together, our work suggests that OsHO2 has a potential regulatory role for tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in rice.
