Hd6|CK2	OsHBP1b|OsTGA5	Phosphorylation of OsTGA5 by casein kinase II compromises its suppression of defense-related gene transcription in rice.	 Importantly, we showed that the nucleus-localized casein kinase II (CK2) complex interacts with and phosphorylates OsTGA5 on Ser-32, which reduces the affinity of OsTGA5 for the JIOsPR10 promoter, thereby alleviating the repression of JIOsPR10 transcription and increasing rice resistance
