OsHBP1b	 qRT-PCR based expression studies for OsHBP1b in seedlings of contrasting genotypes of rice showed its differential regulation in response to salinity stress
OsHBP1b|OsTGA5	 In this study, we characterized the role of OsTGA5 as a negative regulator of rice resistance against blast fungus by transcriptionally repressing the expression of various defense-related genes
