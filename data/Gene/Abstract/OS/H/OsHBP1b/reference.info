NA	A nuclear-localized histone-gene binding protein from rice (OsHBP1b) functions in salinity and drought stress tolerance by maintaining chlorophyll content and improving the antioxidant machinery.	2014	J Plant Physiol	Stress Physiology and Molecular Biology Laboratory, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110067, India.	Plants have evolved a number of molecular strategies and regulatory mechanisms to cope with abiotic stresses. Among the various key factors/regulators, transcription factors (TFs) play critical role(s) towards regulating the gene expression patterns in response to stress conditions. Altering the expression of the key TFs can greatly influence plant stress tolerance. OsHBP1b (accession no. KM096571) is one such TF belonging to bZIP family, localized within the Saltol QTL, whose expression is induced upon salinity treatment in the rice seedlings. qRT-PCR based expression studies for OsHBP1b in seedlings of contrasting genotypes of rice showed its differential regulation in response to salinity stress. A GFP based in vivo study showed that the OsHBP1b protein is nuclear localized and possesses the trans-activation activity. As compared to the WT tobacco plants, the transgenic plants ectopically expressing OsHBP1b showed better survival and favourable osmotic parameters (such as germination and survival rate, membrane stability, K(+)/Na(+) ratio, lipid peroxidation, electrolyte leakage and proline contents) under salinity and drought stress. Under salinity conditions, the transgenic plants accumulated lower levels of reactive oxygen species as compared to the WT. It was also accompanied by higher activities of antioxidant enzymes (such as ascorbate peroxidase and superoxide dismutase), thereby demonstrating that transgenic plants are physiologically better adapted towards the oxidative damage. Taken together, our findings suggest that OsHBP1b contributes to abiotic stress tolerance through multiple physiological pathways and thus, may serve as a useful 'candidate gene' for improving multiple stress tolerance in crop plants.
NA	A unique bZIP transcription factor imparting multiple stress tolerance in Rice.	2019	Rice (N Y)	Stress Physiology and Molecular Biology Laboratory, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, 110067, India.	Rice productivity is adversely affected by environmental stresses. Transcription factors (TFs), as the regulators of gene expression, are the key players contributing to stress tolerance and crop yield. Histone gene binding protein-1b (OsHBP1b) is a TF localized within the Saltol QTL in rice. Recently, we have reported the characterization of OsHBP1b in relation to salinity and drought tolerance in a model system tobacco. In the present study, we over-express the full-length gene encoding OsHBP1b in the homologous system (rice) to assess its contribution towards multiple stress tolerance and grain yield.We provide evidence to show that transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsHBP1b exhibit better survival and favourable osmotic parameters under salinity stress than the wild type counterparts. These transgenic plants restricted reactive oxygen species accumulation by exhibiting high antioxidant enzyme activity (ascorbate peroxidase and superoxide dismutase), under salinity conditions. Additionally, these transgenic plants maintained the chlorophyll concentration, organellar structure, photosynthesis and expression of photosynthesis and stress-related genes even when subjected to salinity stress. Experiments conducted for other abiotic stresses such as drought and high temperature revealed improved tolerance in these transgenic plants with better root and shoot growth, better photosynthetic parameters, and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity, in comparison with WT. Further, the roots of transgenic lines showed large cortical cells and accumulated a good amount of callose, unlike the WT roots, thus enabling them to penetrate hard soil and prevent the entry of harmful ions in the cell.Collectively, our results show that rice HBP1b gene contributes to multiple abiotic stress tolerance through several molecular and physiological pathways and hence, may serve as an important gene for providing multiple stress tolerance and improving crop yield in rice.
NA	Phosphorylation of OsTGA5 by casein kinase II compromises its suppression of defense-related gene transcription in rice.	2022	Plant Cell	Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Genetics, Breeding and Multiple Utilization of Crops,Fujian University Key Laboratory for Plant-Microbe Interaction,Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, Fujian 350002, China.	Plants manage the high cost of immunity activation by suppressing the expression of defense genes during normal growth and rapidly switching them on upon pathogen invasion. TGAs are key transcription factors controlling the expression of defense genes. However, how TGAs function, especially in monocot plants like rice with continuously high levels of endogenous salicylic acid remains elusive. In this study, we characterized the role of OsTGA5 as a negative regulator of rice resistance against blast fungus by transcriptionally repressing the expression of various defense-related genes. Moreover, OsTGA5 repressed PTI responses and the accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid. Importantly, we showed that the nucleus-localized casein kinase II (CK2) complex interacts with and phosphorylates OsTGA5 on Ser-32, which reduces the affinity of OsTGA5 for the JIOsPR10 promoter, thereby alleviating the repression of JIOsPR10 transcription and increasing rice resistance. Furthermore, the in vivo phosphorylation of OsTGA5 Ser-32 was enhanced by blast fungus infection. The CK2 Î± subunit, depending on its kinase activity, positively regulated rice defense against blast fungus. Taken together, our results provide a mechanism for the role of OsTGA5 in negatively regulating the transcription of defense-related genes in rice and the repressive switch imposed by nuclear CK2-mediated phosphorylation during blast fungus invasion.
