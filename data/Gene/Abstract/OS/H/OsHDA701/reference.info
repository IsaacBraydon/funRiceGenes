NA	A secreted fungal effector suppresses rice immunity through host histone hypoacetylation.	2022	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Histone acetylation is a critical epigenetic modification that regulates plant immunity. Fungal pathogens secrete effectors that modulate host immunity and facilitate infection, but whether fungal pathogens have evolved effectors that directly target plant histone acetylation remains unknown. Here, we identified a secreted protein, UvSec117, from the rice false smut fungus, Ustilaginoidea virens, as a key effector that can target the rice histone deacetylase OsHDA701 and negatively regulates rice broad-spectrum resistance against rice pathogens. UvSec117 disrupts host immunity by recruiting OsHDA701 to the nucleus and enhancing OsHDA701-modulated deacetylation, thereby reducing histone H3K9 acetylation levels in rice plants and interfering with defense gene activation. Host-induced gene silencing of UvSec117 promotes rice resistance to U.â€‰virens, thus providing an alternative way for developing rice false smut-resistant plants. This is the first direct evidence demonstrating that a fungal effector targets a histone deacetylase to suppress plant immunity. Our data provided insight into a counter-defense mechanism in a plant pathogen that inactivates host defense responses at the epigenetic level.
