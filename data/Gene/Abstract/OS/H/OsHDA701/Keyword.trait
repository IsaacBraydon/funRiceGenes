OsHDA701	resistance	A secreted fungal effector suppresses rice immunity through host histone hypoacetylation.	 Here, we identified a secreted protein, UvSec117, from the rice false smut fungus, Ustilaginoidea virens, as a key effector that can target the rice histone deacetylase OsHDA701 and negatively regulates rice broad-spectrum resistance against rice pathogens
OsHDA701	defense	A secreted fungal effector suppresses rice immunity through host histone hypoacetylation.	 UvSec117 disrupts host immunity by recruiting OsHDA701 to the nucleus and enhancing OsHDA701-modulated deacetylation, thereby reducing histone H3K9 acetylation levels in rice plants and interfering with defense gene activation
OsHDA701	immunity	A secreted fungal effector suppresses rice immunity through host histone hypoacetylation.	 UvSec117 disrupts host immunity by recruiting OsHDA701 to the nucleus and enhancing OsHDA701-modulated deacetylation, thereby reducing histone H3K9 acetylation levels in rice plants and interfering with defense gene activation
OsHDA701	nucleus	A secreted fungal effector suppresses rice immunity through host histone hypoacetylation.	 UvSec117 disrupts host immunity by recruiting OsHDA701 to the nucleus and enhancing OsHDA701-modulated deacetylation, thereby reducing histone H3K9 acetylation levels in rice plants and interfering with defense gene activation
