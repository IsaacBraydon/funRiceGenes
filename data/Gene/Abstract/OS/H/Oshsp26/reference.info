A rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nakdong) cDNA clone, Oshsp26, encoding the chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein (smHSP) was isolated. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA and the result of screening of a cDNA library indicated that the Oshsp26 gene is encoded by a single gene in the rice genome. The Oshsp26 gene was expressed following heat stress: the transcript level was highest when rice leaves were treated at high temperatures for 2h at 42 degrees C, and the transcripts became detectable after 20min and reached a maximum level after 2h. It was also found that the Oshsp26 gene was expressed following oxidative stress even in the absence of heat stress. Treatment of rice plants with methyl viologen (MV) in the light and treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), either in the light or in the dark, both caused a significant accumulation of the transcripts and the protein. Since MV treatment in the light leads to the generation of H(2)O(2) inside the chloroplast, it is likely that H(2)O(2) by itself acts to induce the expression of the Oshsp26 gene. These results suggest that the chloroplast smHSP plays an important role in protecting the chloroplast against damage caused by oxidative stress as well as by heat stress.

We previously isolated and characterized a rice cDNA clone, Oshsp26, encoding a chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein that is expressed following oxidative or heat stress. In this study, we transferred this gene to tall fescue plants by an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system. The integration and expression of the transgene was confirmed by PCR, Southern, northern, and immunoblot analyzes. Compared to the control plants, the transgenic plants had significantly lower electrolyte leakage and accumulation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances when exposed to heat or methyl viologen. The photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) (Fv/Fm) in the transgenic tall fescue plants was higher than that in the control plants during heat stress (42 degrees C). These results suggest that the OsHSP26 protein plays an important role in the protection of PSII during heat and oxidative stress in vivo.
