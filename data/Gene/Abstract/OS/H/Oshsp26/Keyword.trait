Oshsp26	temperature	Expression of the chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein by oxidative stress in rice	" The Oshsp26 gene was expressed following heat stress: the transcript level was highest when rice leaves were treated at high temperatures for 2h at 42 degrees C, and the transcripts became detectable after 20min and reached a maximum level after 2h"
Oshsp26	chloroplast	Expression of the chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein by oxidative stress in rice	 Nakdong) cDNA clone, Oshsp26, encoding the chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein (smHSP) was isolated| Since MV treatment in the light leads to the generation of H(2)O(2) inside the chloroplast, it is likely that H(2)O(2) by itself acts to induce the expression of the Oshsp26 gene
Oshsp26	chloroplast	Overexpression of a chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein OsHSP26 confers enhanced tolerance against oxidative and heat stresses in tall fescue	 We previously isolated and characterized a rice cDNA clone, Oshsp26, encoding a chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein that is expressed following oxidative or heat stress|Overexpression of a chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein OsHSP26 confers enhanced tolerance against oxidative and heat stresses in tall fescue
Oshsp26	oxidative	Expression of the chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein by oxidative stress in rice	 It was also found that the Oshsp26 gene was expressed following oxidative stress even in the absence of heat stress
Oshsp26	oxidative	Overexpression of a chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein OsHSP26 confers enhanced tolerance against oxidative and heat stresses in tall fescue	" We previously isolated and characterized a rice cDNA clone, Oshsp26, encoding a chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein that is expressed following oxidative or heat stress| These results suggest that the OsHSP26 protein plays an important role in the protection of PSII during heat and oxidative stress in vivo|Overexpression of a chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein OsHSP26 confers enhanced tolerance against oxidative and heat stresses in tall fescue"
