J Hered-2013-Wei-287-94.pdf	A dominant major locus in chromosome 9 of rice (Oryza sativa L.) confers tolerance to 48 degrees C high temperature at seedling stage	2013	J Hered	Institute of Crop Science, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Yuhangtang Road 388, Hangzhou 310058, China.	In an earlier greenhouse screening, we identified a local indica cultivar HT54 tolerant to high temperature at both seedling and grain-filling stages. In this study, we develop an optimized procedure for fine assessment of this heat tolerance. The results indicated that HT54 seedlings could tolerate high temperature up to 48 degrees C for 79h. The genetic analysis of F(1) and F(2) offspring derived from the cross between HT54 and HT13, a heat-sensitive breeding line, reveals that the heat tolerance of HT54 was controlled by a dominant major locus, which has been designated as OsHTAS (Oryza sativa heat tolerance at seedling stage). This locus was mapped on rice chromosome 9 within an interval of 420kb between markers of InDel5 and RM7364. The determined candidate ZFP gene has been confirmed to be cosegregated with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) developed PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) marker RBsp1407 in its promoter region. Another heat tolerance-associated SNP was identified in the first intron of its 5'-untranslated region. The existence of these SNPs thereby indicated that the OsHTAS locus contains at least two alleles. We named the one from HT54 as OsHTAS ( a ) and the one from HT13 as OsHTAS ( b ). Further dynamic expression analysis demonstrated that OsHTAS ( a ) was actively responsive to 45 degrees C high temperature stress compared with the OsHTAS ( b ) allele.
NA	The RING Finger Ubiquitin E3 Ligase OsHTAS Enhances Heat Tolerance by Promoting H2O2-Induced Stomatal Closure in Rice	2015	Plant Physiol	Zhejiang University	Heat stress often results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which plays a vital role as a secondary messenger in the process of abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated stomatal closure. Here, we characterized the Oryza sativa HEAT TOLERANCE AT SEEDLING STAGE (OsHTAS) gene, which plays a positive role on heat tolerance at seedling stage. OsHTAS encodes an ubiquitin (Ub) ligase localized in nuclear and cytoplasm. The OsHTAS expression was detected in all tissues surveyed and peaked in leaf blade, in which the expression concentrated in mesophyll cells. OsHTAS was responsive to multiple stresses and strongly induced by exogenous ABA. In yeast two-hybrid assays, OsHTAS was found to interact with components of Ub/26S proteasome system and a rice ascorbate peroxidase isoform. OsHTAS modulated H2O2 accumulation of shoots thus altered the stomatal aperture status of rice leaves, and promoted ABA biosynthesis. The results suggested that the RING finger ubiquitin E3 ligase OsHTAS functions in leaf blade to enhancing basal thermotolerance through modulating ROS homeostasis to regulate stomatal aperture status involves in both ABA-dependent and DST-mediated pathways.
