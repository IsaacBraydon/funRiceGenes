OsHTAS	temperature	A dominant major locus in chromosome 9 of rice (Oryza sativa L.) confers tolerance to 48 degrees C high temperature at seedling stage	Further dynamic expression analysis demonstrated that OsHTAS ( a ) was actively responsive to 45 degrees C high temperature stress compared with the OsHTAS ( b ) allele
OsHTAS	seedling	A dominant major locus in chromosome 9 of rice (Oryza sativa L.) confers tolerance to 48 degrees C high temperature at seedling stage	The genetic analysis of F(1) and F(2) offspring derived from the cross between HT54 and HT13, a heat-sensitive breeding line, reveals that the heat tolerance of HT54 was controlled by a dominant major locus, which has been designated as OsHTAS (Oryza sativa heat tolerance at seedling stage)
OsHTAS	breeding	A dominant major locus in chromosome 9 of rice (Oryza sativa L.) confers tolerance to 48 degrees C high temperature at seedling stage	The genetic analysis of F(1) and F(2) offspring derived from the cross between HT54 and HT13, a heat-sensitive breeding line, reveals that the heat tolerance of HT54 was controlled by a dominant major locus, which has been designated as OsHTAS (Oryza sativa heat tolerance at seedling stage)
OsHTAS	heat tolerance	The RING Finger Ubiquitin E3 Ligase OsHTAS Enhances Heat Tolerance by Promoting H2O2-Induced Stomatal Closure in Rice	The RING Finger Ubiquitin E3 Ligase OsHTAS Enhances Heat Tolerance by Promoting H2O2-Induced Stomatal Closure in Rice
OsHTAS	stomatal	The RING Finger Ubiquitin E3 Ligase OsHTAS Enhances Heat Tolerance by Promoting H2O2-Induced Stomatal Closure in Rice	The RING Finger Ubiquitin E3 Ligase OsHTAS Enhances Heat Tolerance by Promoting H2O2-Induced Stomatal Closure in Rice
OsHTAS	stress	The RING Finger Ubiquitin E3 Ligase OsHTAS Enhances Heat Tolerance by Promoting H2O2-Induced Stomatal Closure in Rice	OsHTAS was responsive to multiple stresses and strongly induced by exogenous ABA
OsHTAS	ABA	The RING Finger Ubiquitin E3 Ligase OsHTAS Enhances Heat Tolerance by Promoting H2O2-Induced Stomatal Closure in Rice	OsHTAS was responsive to multiple stresses and strongly induced by exogenous ABA
OsHTAS	ABA biosynthesis	The RING Finger Ubiquitin E3 Ligase OsHTAS Enhances Heat Tolerance by Promoting H2O2-Induced Stomatal Closure in Rice	OsHTAS modulated H2O2 accumulation of shoots thus altered the stomatal aperture status of rice leaves, and promoted ABA biosynthesis
