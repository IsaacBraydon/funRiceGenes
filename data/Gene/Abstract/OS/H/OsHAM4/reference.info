NA	Rice osa-miR171c Mediates Phase Change from Vegetative to Reproductive Development and Shoot Apical Meristem Maintenance by Repressing Four OsHAM Transcription Factors.	2015	PLoS One	Key Laboratory of South China Agricultural Plant Molecular Analysis and Genetic Improvement &amp; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Botany, South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Phase change from vegetative to reproductive development is one of the critical developmental steps in plants, and it is regulated by both environmental and endogenous factors. The maintenance of shoot apical meristem (SAM) identity, miRNAs and flowering integrators are involved in this phase change process. Here, we report that the miRNA osa-miR171c targets four GRAS (GAI-RGA-SCR) plant-specific transcription factors (OsHAM1, OsHAM2, OsHAM3, and OsHAM4) to control the floral transition and maintenance of SAM indeterminacy in rice (Oryza sativa). We characterized a rice T-DNA insertion delayed heading (dh) mutant, where the expression of OsMIR171c gene is up-regulated. This mutant showed pleiotropic phenotypic defects, including especially prolonged vegetative phase, delayed heading date, and bigger shoot apex. Parallel expression analysis showed that osa-miR171c controlled the expression change of four OsHAMs in the shoot apex during floral transition, and responded to light. In the dh mutant, the expression of the juvenile-adult phase change negative regulator osa-miR156 was up-regulated, expression of the flowering integrators Hd3a and RFT1 was inhibited, and expression of FON4 negative regulators involved in the maintenance of SAM indeterminacy was also inhibited. From these data, we propose that the inhibition of osa-miR171c-mediated OsHAM transcription factors regulates the phase transition from vegetative to reproductive development by maintaining SAM indeterminacy and inhibiting flowering integrators.
NA	Rice microRNA171f/SCL6 module enhances drought tolerance by regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis genes.	2022	Plant Direct	Graduate School of International Agricultural Technology and Crop Biotechnology Institute/GreenBio Science and Technology Seoul National University Pyeongchang South Korea.	Plants have evolved sophisticated defense systems to enhance drought tolerance. These include the microRNA (miRNA) group of small noncoding RNAs that act as post-transcriptional regulators; however, details of the mechanisms by which they confer drought tolerance are not well understood. Here, we show that osa-MIR171f, a member of osa-MIR171 gene family, is mainly expressed in response to drought stress and regulates the transcript levels of SCARECROW-LIKE6-I (SCL6-I) and SCL6-II in rice (Oryza sativa). The SCL6 genes are known to be involved in shoot branching and flag leaf morphology. Osa-MIR171f-overexpressing (osa-MIR171f-OE) transgenic plants showed reduced drought symptoms compared with non-transgenic (NT) control plants under both field drought and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated dehydration stress conditions. Transcriptome analysis of osa-MIR171f-OE plants and osa-mir171f-knockout (K/O) lines generated by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9) revealed that osa-mature-miR171a-f (osa-miR171) regulates the expression of flavonoid biosynthesis genes, consequently leading to drought tolerance. This upregulation in the osa-MIR171f-OE plants, which did not occur in NT control plants, was observed under both normal and drought conditions. Our findings indicate that osa-miR171 plays a role in drought tolerance by regulating SCL6-I and SCL6-II transcript levels.
