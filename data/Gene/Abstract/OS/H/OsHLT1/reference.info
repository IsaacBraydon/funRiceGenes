NA	Efficient scavenging of reactive carbonyl species in chloroplasts is required for light acclimation and fitness of plants.	2023	New Phytol	Photosynthesis Research Center, Key Laboratory of Photobiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China.	Reactive carbonyl species (RCS) derived from lipid peroxides can act as critical damage or signaling mediators downstream of reactive oxygen species by modifying target proteins. However, their biological effects and underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown in plants. Here, we have uncovered the mechanism by which the RCS 4-hydroxy-(E)-2-nonenal (HNE) participates in photosystem II (PSII) repair cycle of chloroplasts, a crucial process for maintaining PSII activity under high and changing light conditions. High Light Sensitive 1 (HLT1) is a potential NADPH-dependent reductase in chloroplasts. Deficiency of HLT1 had no impact on the growth of Arabidopsis plants under normal light conditions but increased sensitivity to high light, which resulted from a defective PSII repair cycle. In hlt1 plants, the accumulation of HNE-modified D1 subunit of PSII was observed, which did not affect D1 degradation but hampered the dimerization of repaired PSII monomers and reassembly of PSII supercomplexes on grana stacks. HLT1 is conserved in all photosynthetic organisms and has functions in overall growth and plant fitness in both Arabidopsis and rice under naturally challenging field conditions. Our work provides the mechanistic basis underlying RCS scavenging in light acclimation and suggests a potential strategy to improve plant productivity by manipulating RCS signaling in chloroplasts.
