OsHMA4	OsNRAMP5	Univariate and Multivariate QTL Analyses Reveal Covariance Among Mineral Elements in the Rice Ionome	 The candidate genes underlying the QTL clusters with elemental QTLs, PC-QTLs and aPC-QTLs co-localized were identified, including OsHMA4 and OsNRAMP5
OsHIPP17	OsHMA4	OsHIPP17 is involved in regulating the tolerance of rice to copper stress.	 Meanwhile, knockout of OsHIPP17 decreased the expression levels of OsATX1, OsZIP1, OsCOPT5 or OsHMA5, and increased the expression levels of OsCOPT1 or OsHMA4
