OsHMA4	root	A heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA4 prevents copper accumulation in rice grain.	We provide evidence that OsHMA4 functions to sequester Cu into root vacuoles, limiting Cu accumulation in the grain
OsHMA4	grain	A heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA4 prevents copper accumulation in rice grain.	Here we identify OsHMA4 as the likely causal gene of a quantitative trait locus controlling Cu accumulation in rice grain
OsHMA4	grain	A heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA4 prevents copper accumulation in rice grain.	We provide evidence that OsHMA4 functions to sequester Cu into root vacuoles, limiting Cu accumulation in the grain
OsHMA4	grain	A heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA4 prevents copper accumulation in rice grain.	The difference in grain Cu accumulation is most likely attributed to a single amino acid substitution that leads to different OsHMA4 transport activity
OsHMA4	grain	A heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA4 prevents copper accumulation in rice grain.	Identification of natural allelic variation in OsHMA4 may facilitate the development of rice varieties with grain Cu concentrations tuned to both the concentration of Cu in the soil and dietary needs
OsHMA4	development	A heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA4 prevents copper accumulation in rice grain.	Identification of natural allelic variation in OsHMA4 may facilitate the development of rice varieties with grain Cu concentrations tuned to both the concentration of Cu in the soil and dietary needs
OsHMA4	ATPase	A heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA4 prevents copper accumulation in rice grain.	A heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA4 prevents copper accumulation in rice grain.
OsHMA4	copper	A heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA4 prevents copper accumulation in rice grain.	A heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA4 prevents copper accumulation in rice grain.
