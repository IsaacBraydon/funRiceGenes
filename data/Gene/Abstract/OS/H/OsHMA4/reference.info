NA	A heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA4 prevents copper accumulation in rice grain.	2016	Nat Commun	Institute of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, UK.	Rice is a major source of calories and mineral nutrients for over half the world's human population. However, little is known in rice about the genetic basis of variation in accumulation of copper (Cu), an essential but potentially toxic nutrient. Here we identify OsHMA4 as the likely causal gene of a quantitative trait locus controlling Cu accumulation in rice grain. We provide evidence that OsHMA4 functions to sequester Cu into root vacuoles, limiting Cu accumulation in the grain. The difference in grain Cu accumulation is most likely attributed to a single amino acid substitution that leads to different OsHMA4 transport activity. The allele associated with low grain Cu was found in 67 of the 1,367 rice accessions investigated. Identification of natural allelic variation in OsHMA4 may facilitate the development of rice varieties with grain Cu concentrations tuned to both the concentration of Cu in the soil and dietary needs.
NA	Univariate and Multivariate QTL Analyses Reveal Covariance Among Mineral Elements in the Rice Ionome	2021	Front Genet	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Rice provides more than one fifth of daily calories for half of the world's human population, and is a major dietary source of both essential mineral nutrients and toxic elements. Rice grains are generally poor in some essential nutrients but may contain unsafe levels of some toxic elements under certain conditions. Identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling the concentrations of mineral nutrients and toxic trace metals (the ionome) in rice will facilitate development of nutritionally improved rice varieties. However, QTL analyses have traditionally considered each element separately without considering their interrelatedness. In this study, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate QTL analyses to identify the genetic loci controlling the covariance among mineral elements in the rice ionome. We resequenced the whole genomes of a rice recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, and performed univariate and multivariate QTL analyses for the concentrations of 16 elements in grains, shoots and roots of the RIL population grown in different conditions. We identified a total of 167 unique elemental QTLs based on analyses of individual elemental concentrations as separate traits, 53 QTLs controlling covariance among elemental concentrations within a single environment/tissue (PC-QTLs), and 152 QTLs which determined covariation among elements across environments/tissues (aPC-QTLs). The candidate genes underlying the QTL clusters with elemental QTLs, PC-QTLs and aPC-QTLs co-localized were identified, including OsHMA4 and OsNRAMP5. The identification of both elemental QTLs and PC QTLs will facilitate the cloning of underlying causal genes and the dissection of the complex regulation of the ionome in rice.
