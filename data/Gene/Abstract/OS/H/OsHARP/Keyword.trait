OsHARP	leaf	and alanine-rich protein showing interaction with calreticulin in rice.	 Rice plants transformed with the OsHARP promoter-GUS construct showed GUS staining in the basal parts of leaf sheaths, and although GUS activity increased when treated with GA(3), it was not as high an increase as when mRNA was analyzed
OsHARP	leaf	and alanine-rich protein showing interaction with calreticulin in rice.	 To elucidate the role of OsHARP in leaf sheath elongation, antisense OsHARP transgenic rice lines were constructed
OsHARP	leaf	and alanine-rich protein showing interaction with calreticulin in rice.	 To examine whether OsHARP expression would affect other proteins, basal leaf sheaths from antisense OsHARP transgenic rice plants were analyzed using proteomic techniques
OsHARP	seedlings	and alanine-rich protein showing interaction with calreticulin in rice.	 The mRNA expression level of OsHARP was up-regulated in rice seedlings treated with gibberellin (GA), but not ABA and showed a similar pattern as OsCRT mRNA
OsHARP	sheath	and alanine-rich protein showing interaction with calreticulin in rice.	 To elucidate the role of OsHARP in leaf sheath elongation, antisense OsHARP transgenic rice lines were constructed
OsHARP	gibberellin	and alanine-rich protein showing interaction with calreticulin in rice.	 The mRNA expression level of OsHARP was up-regulated in rice seedlings treated with gibberellin (GA), but not ABA and showed a similar pattern as OsCRT mRNA
OsHARP	 ABA 	and alanine-rich protein showing interaction with calreticulin in rice.	 The mRNA expression level of OsHARP was up-regulated in rice seedlings treated with gibberellin (GA), but not ABA and showed a similar pattern as OsCRT mRNA
OsHARP	R protein	and alanine-rich protein showing interaction with calreticulin in rice.	 To examine whether OsHARP expression would affect other proteins, basal leaf sheaths from antisense OsHARP transgenic rice plants were analyzed using proteomic techniques
OsHARP	R protein	and alanine-rich protein showing interaction with calreticulin in rice.	 In antisense transgenic-rice OsHARP plants, OsCRT was down-regulated and the levels of 20 other proteins were changed compared to the pattern of the vector control
OsHARP	ABA	and alanine-rich protein showing interaction with calreticulin in rice.	 The mRNA expression level of OsHARP was up-regulated in rice seedlings treated with gibberellin (GA), but not ABA and showed a similar pattern as OsCRT mRNA
OsHARP	Gibberellin	and alanine-rich protein showing interaction with calreticulin in rice.	 The mRNA expression level of OsHARP was up-regulated in rice seedlings treated with gibberellin (GA), but not ABA and showed a similar pattern as OsCRT mRNA
