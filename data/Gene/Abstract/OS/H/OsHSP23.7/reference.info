Expression profiles of nine rice heat shock protein genes (OsHSPs) were analyzed by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The nine genes exhibited distinctive expression in different organs. Expression of nine OsHSP genes was affected differentially by abiotic stresses and abscisic acid (ABA). All nine OsHSP genes were induced strongly by heat shock treatment, whereas none of them were induced by cold. The transcripts of OsHSP80.2, OsHSP71.1 and OsHSP23.7 were increased during salt tress treatment. Expression of OsHSP80.2 and OsHSP24.1 genes were enhanced while treated with 10% PEG. Only OsHSP71.1 was induced by ABA while OsHSP24.1 was suppressed by ABA. These observations imply that the nine OsHSP genes may play different roles in plant development and abiotic stress responses.

Heat shock proteins (Hsps) play an important role in plant stress tolerance. We previously reported that expression of OsHsp17.0 and OsHsp23.7 could be enhanced by heat shock treatment and/or other abiotic stresses. In this paper, stress tolerance assays of transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsHsp17.0 and OsHsp23.7 have been carried out. Both OsHsp17.0-OE and OsHsp23.7-OE transgenic lines demonstrated higher germination ability compared to wild-type (WT) plants when subjected to mannitol and NaCl. Phenotypic analysis showed that transgenic rice lines displayed a higher tolerance to drought and salt stress compared to WT plants. In addition, transgenic rice lines showed significantly lower REC, lower MDA content and higher free proline content than WT under drought and salt stresses. These results suggest that OsHsp17.0 and OsHsp23.7 play an important role in rice acclimation to salt and drought stresses and are useful for engineering drought and salt tolerance rice.
