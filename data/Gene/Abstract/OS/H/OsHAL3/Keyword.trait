OsHAL3	growth	OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice	OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice
OsHAL3	cell division	OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice	Further investigation suggested that OsHAL3 promotes cell division by recruiting a ubiquitin system, rather than by its 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine (PPC) decarboxylase activity
OsHAL3	nucleus	OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.	OsHAL3 and Hd1 colocalized to the nucleus in vivo and interacted physically in the dark, but the interaction was inhibited by white or blue light
OsHAL3	salt	An α/β hydrolase family member negatively regulates salt tolerance but promotes flowering through three distinct functions in rice.	 Meanwhile, we demonstrated that STH1 forms a protein complex with D3 and a vital regulatory factor in salt tolerance, OsHAL3, to regulate the protein abundance of OsHAL3 via the 26S proteasome pathway
