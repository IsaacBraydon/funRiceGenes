Hd1	OsHAL3	OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.	OsHAL3 and Hd1 colocalized to the nucleus in vivo and interacted physically in the dark, but the interaction was inhibited by white or blue light
Hd1	OsHAL3	OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.	We conclude that OsHAL3, a novel light responsive protein, plays an essential role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice, which is probably mediated by forming a complex with Hd1
Hd3a	OsHAL3	OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.	Moreover, OsHAL3 directly bound to the promoter of Hd3a, especially before dawn
