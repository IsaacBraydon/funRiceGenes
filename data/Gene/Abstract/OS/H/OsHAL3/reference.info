ncb1892.pdf	OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice	2009	Nat Cell Biol	Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, China.	Plants show distinct morphologies in different light conditions through a process called photomorphogenesis. A predominant feature of photomorphogenesis is the reduced growth of seedlings under light conditions compared with darkness. For this adaptive event, the most well-known molecular mechanism involves photoreceptor-mediated inhibition of cell elongation. However, it is not known whether additional pathways exist. Here, we describe a newly discovered pathway of light-modulated plant growth mediated by the halotolerance protein HAL3, a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding protein involved in cell division. We found that light, especially blue light, suppresses growth of rice seedlings by reducing the activity of Oryza sativa (Os) HAL3. Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed that OsHAL3 is structurally inactivated by light through photo-oxidation and by direct interaction with photons. In addition, the transcriptional expression of OsHAL3 is synergistically regulated by different light conditions. Further investigation suggested that OsHAL3 promotes cell division by recruiting a ubiquitin system, rather than by its 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine (PPC) decarboxylase activity. Our results uncover a new mechanism for light-regulated plant growth, namely, light not only inhibits cell elongation but also suppresses cell division through HAL3 and E3 ubiquitin ligase. This study thus brings new insights into our understanding of plant photomorphogenesis.
art%3A10.1134%2FS000629790901009X.pdf	Role of OsHAL3 protein, a putative 4-phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase in rice	2009	Biochemistry (Moscow)	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100094, China.	In this study, we cloned the OsHAL3 gene from rice Oryza sativa. Alignment analysis revealed that OsHAL3 has a high sequence identity to Dfp protein in Escherichia coli and AtHAL3a protein in Arabidopsis thaliana, which have 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (PPC-DC) activity. OsHAL3 can complement mutation in the E. coli dfp gene encoding PPC-DC, so that the mutant strains with OsHAL3 can grow on rich media at 42 degrees C and on VB minimal media at 30 degrees C. Complementation tests with point mutations of OsHAL3 suggested that the conserved Cys176 residue of OsHAL3 is a key active-site residue. The mutant OsHAL3 G180A has a partly reduced activity. Related mRNA-level analysis showed that the OsHAL3 gene is induced by calcium pantothenate in rice.
NA	OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.	2015	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, CAS Centre for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences and Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 300 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, China.	In flowering plants, photoperiodic flowering is controlled by a complicated network. Light is one of the most important environmental stimuli that control the timing of the transition from the vegetative growth stage to the reproductive stage. Several photoreceptors, including PHYA, PHYB, CRY2, FKF1, have been identified to be related to flowering in Arabidopsis. Their homologs, OsPHYA, OsPHYB, OsPHYC and OsCRY2 have also been identified to be related to flowering in rice. Whether there are other light sensors that regulate flowering time is currently unknown. Here, we report the identification of a positive regulator of flowering in rice, OsHAL3. This flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding protein is thought to function as a blue-light sensor. OsHAL3 overexpression lines exhibited an early flowering phenotype, and diminished expression of OsHAL3 by RNA interference delayed flowering under an inductive photoperiod (short-day conditions). The change in flowering time was not accompanied by altered Hd1 expression but rather by altered transcript levels of Hd3a and MADS14. OsHAL3 and Hd1 colocalized to the nucleus in vivo and interacted physically in the dark, but the interaction was inhibited by white or blue light. Moreover, OsHAL3 directly bound to the promoter of Hd3a, especially before dawn. We conclude that OsHAL3, a novel light responsive protein, plays an essential role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice, which is probably mediated by forming a complex with Hd1. Our findings open up new perspectives on the photoperiodic flowering pathway.
NA	Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant. In addition to serving as a model plant for molecular genetic studies of monocots, rice is a staple crop for about half of the world population. Heading date is a critical agronomic trait, and many genes controlling heading date have been cloned during the last two decades. The mechanism of flowering in rice from recognition of day length by leaves to floral activation in the shoot apical meristem has been extensively studied. In this review, we summarize current progress on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice with emphasis on post-translational modifications of key regulators, including Heading Date 1 (Hd1), Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Grain Number, Plant Height, and Heading Date7 (Ghd7). The contribution of heading date genes to heterosis and the expansion of rice cultivation areas from low-latitude to high-latitude regions are also discussed. To overcome limitations of diverse genetic backgrounds used in heading date studies and to gain a clearer understanding of flowering in rice, we propose a systematic collection of genetic resources in a common genetic background. Strategies in breeding adapted cultivars by rational design are also discussed.
NA	An α/β hydrolase family member negatively regulates salt tolerance but promotes flowering through three distinct functions in rice.	2022	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, CAS Centre for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences and Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics &amp; Development, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China; Guangdong Laboratory for Lingnan Modern Agriculture, Guangzhou 510642, China; University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.	Ongoing soil salinization drastically threatens crop growth, development, and yield worldwide. It is therefore crucial that we improve salt tolerance in rice by exploiting natural genetic variation. However, many salt-responsive genes confer undesirable phenotypes and therefore cannot be effectively applied to practical agricultural production. In this study, we identified a quantitative trait locus for salt tolerance from the African rice species Oryza glaberrima and named it as Salt Tolerance and Heading Date 1 (STH1). We found that STH1 regulates fatty acid metabolic homeostasis, probably by catalyzing the hydrolytic degradation of fatty acids, which contributes to salt tolerance. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that STH1 forms a protein complex with D3 and a vital regulatory factor in salt tolerance, OsHAL3, to regulate the protein abundance of OsHAL3 via the 26S proteasome pathway. Furthermore, we revealed that STH1 also serves as a co-activator with the floral integrator gene Heading date 1 to balance the expression of the florigen gene Heading date 3a under different circumstances, thus coordinating the regulation of salt tolerance and heading date. Notably, the allele of STH1 associated with enhanced salt tolerance and high yield is found in some African rice accessions but barely in Asian cultivars. Introgression of the STH1(HP46) allele from African rice into modern rice cultivars is a desirable approach for boosting grain yield under salt stress. Collectively, our discoveries not only provide conceptual advances on the mechanisms of salt tolerance and synergetic regulation between salt tolerance and flowering time but also offer potential strategies to overcome the challenges resulted from increasingly serious soil salinization that many crops are facing.
