ncb1892.pdf	OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice	2009	Nat Cell Biol	Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, China.	Plants show distinct morphologies in different light conditions through a process called photomorphogenesis. A predominant feature of photomorphogenesis is the reduced growth of seedlings under light conditions compared with darkness. For this adaptive event, the most well-known molecular mechanism involves photoreceptor-mediated inhibition of cell elongation. However, it is not known whether additional pathways exist. Here, we describe a newly discovered pathway of light-modulated plant growth mediated by the halotolerance protein HAL3, a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding protein involved in cell division. We found that light, especially blue light, suppresses growth of rice seedlings by reducing the activity of Oryza sativa (Os) HAL3. Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed that OsHAL3 is structurally inactivated by light through photo-oxidation and by direct interaction with photons. In addition, the transcriptional expression of OsHAL3 is synergistically regulated by different light conditions. Further investigation suggested that OsHAL3 promotes cell division by recruiting a ubiquitin system, rather than by its 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine (PPC) decarboxylase activity. Our results uncover a new mechanism for light-regulated plant growth, namely, light not only inhibits cell elongation but also suppresses cell division through HAL3 and E3 ubiquitin ligase. This study thus brings new insights into our understanding of plant photomorphogenesis.

In this study, we cloned the OsHAL3 gene from rice Oryza sativa. Alignment analysis revealed that OsHAL3 has a high sequence identity to Dfp protein in Escherichia coli and AtHAL3a protein in Arabidopsis thaliana, which have 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (PPC-DC) activity. OsHAL3 can complement mutation in the E. coli dfp gene encoding PPC-DC, so that the mutant strains with OsHAL3 can grow on rich media at 42 degrees C and on VB minimal media at 30 degrees C. Complementation tests with point mutations of OsHAL3 suggested that the conserved Cys176 residue of OsHAL3 is a key active-site residue. The mutant OsHAL3 G180A has a partly reduced activity. Related mRNA-level analysis showed that the OsHAL3 gene is induced by calcium pantothenate in rice.
