Five rice homeobox (OSH) genes were overexpressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter or the rice actin gene promoter in transgenic rice plants. Almost all of the transgenic plants showed abnormal phenotypes, which could be classified into three types according to their severity. Plants with the most severe phenotype formed only green organs, with many shoot apices on their adaxial sides. Plants with an intermediate phenotype formed bladeless leaves with normally developed leaf sheaths. Plants with a mild phenotype formed normal leaf sheaths and blades, but lacked ligules and showed diffusion of the blade-sheath boundary. The leaf structure of this phenotype was similar to that of dominant maize mutants, such as Kn1, Rs1, Lg3, and Lg4. Based on these phenotypes, we suggest that ectopic expression of the rice OSH genes interferes with the development of leaf blades and maintains leaves in less differentiated states. These results are discussed in relation to the leaf maturation schedule hypothesis (M. Freeling et al., 1992, BioEssays 14, 227-236).
1069_ftp.pdf	KNOX homeobox genes are sufficient in maintaining cultured cells in an undifferentiated state in rice	2001	Genesis	Plant Genetics Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka-ken, Japan.	We produced transgenic rice calli, which constitutively express each of four KNOX family class 1 homeobox genes of rice, OSH1, OSH16, OSH15, and OSH71, and found that constitutive and ectopic expression of such genes inhibits normal regeneration from transformed calli, which showed continuous growth around their shoot-regenerating stages. Transgenic calli transferred onto regeneration medium began to display green spots, a sign of regeneration, but most of the transformants continued to propagate green spots at given stages. In the normal shoot-regeneration process of calli, expression of endogenous OSH1 was restricted in presumptive shoot-regenerating regions of calli and not observed in other areas. This restricted expression pattern should be required for further differentiation of the regenerating shoots. Thus our present results support the proposed function that KNOX family class 1 homeobox genes play a role in the formation and maintenance of the undetermined meristematic state of cells.
111651.pdf	Regional expression of the rice KN1-type homeobox gene family during embryo, shoot, and flower development	1999	Plant Cell	Nagoya University, BioScience Center, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	We report the isolation, sequence, and pattern of gene expression of members of the KNOTTED1 (KN1)-type class 1 homeobox gene family from rice. Phylogenetic analysis and mapping of the rice genome revealed that all of the rice homeobox genes that we have isolated have one or two direct homologs in maize. Of the homeobox genes that we tested, all exhibited expression in a restricted region of the embryo that defines the position at which the shoot apical meristem (SAM) would eventually develop, prior to visible organ formation. Several distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns were observed for the different genes in this region. After shoot formation, the expression patterns of these homeobox genes were variable in the region of the SAM. These results suggest that the rice KN1-type class 1 homeobox genes function cooperatively to establish the SAM before shoot formation and that after shoot formation, their functions differ.

OSH6 (Oryza sativa Homeobox6) is an ortholog of lg3 (Liguleless3) in maize. We generated a novel allele, termed OSH6-Ds, by inserting a defective Ds element into the third exon of OSH6, which resulted in a truncated OSH6 mRNA. The truncated mRNA was expressed ectopically in leaf tissues and encoded the N-terminal region of OSH6, which includes the KNOX1 and partial KNOX2 subdomains. This recessive mutant showed outgrowth of bracts or produced leaves at the basal node of the panicle. These phenotypes distinguished it from the OSH6 transgene whose ectopic expression led to a "blade to sheath transformation" phenotype at the midrib region of leaves, similar to that seen in dominant Lg3 mutants. Expression of a similar truncated OSH6 cDNA from the 35S promoter (35S::DeltaOSH6) confirmed that the ectopic expression of this product was responsible for the aberrant bract development. These data suggest that OSH6-Ds interferes with a developmental mechanism involved in bract differentiation, especially at the basal nodes of panicles.
