NA	Characterization of Rice Homeobox Genes, OsHOX22 and OsHOX24, and Over-expression of OsHOX24 in Transgenic Arabidopsis Suggest Their Role in Abiotic Stress Response.	2016	Front Plant Sci	National Institute of Plant Genome Research New Delhi, India.	Homeobox transcription factors are well known regulators of plant growth and development. In this study, we carried out functional analysis of two candidate stress-responsive HD-ZIP I class homeobox genes from rice, OsHOX22, and OsHOX24. These genes were highly up-regulated under various abiotic stress conditions at different stages of rice development, including seedling, mature and reproductive stages. The transcript levels of these genes were enhanced significantly in the presence of plant hormones, including abscisic acid (ABA), auxin, salicylic acid, and gibberellic acid. The recombinant full-length and truncated homeobox proteins were found to be localized in the nucleus. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay established the binding of these homeobox proteins with specific DNA sequences, AH1 (CAAT(A/T)ATTG) and AH2 (CAAT(C/G)ATTG). Transactivation assays in yeast revealed the transcriptional activation potential of full-length OsHOX22 and OsHOX24 proteins. Homo- and hetero-dimerization capabilities of these proteins have also been demonstrated. Further, we identified putative novel interacting proteins of OsHOX22 and OsHOX24 via yeast-two hybrid analysis. Over-expression of OsHOX24 imparted higher sensitivity to stress hormone, ABA, and abiotic stresses in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants as revealed by various physiological and phenotypic assays. Microarray analysis revealed differential expression of several stress-responsive genes in transgenic lines as compared to wild-type. Many of these genes were found to be involved in transcriptional regulation and various metabolic pathways. Altogether, our results suggest the possible role of OsHOX22/OsHOX24 homeobox proteins as negative regulators in abiotic stress responses.
NA	Over-Expression of OsHOX24 Confers Enhanced Susceptibility to Abiotic Stresses in Transgenic Rice via Modulating Stress-Responsive Gene Expression.	2017	Front Plant Sci	National Institute of Plant Genome ResearchNew Delhi, India.	Homeobox transcription factors play critical roles in plant development and abiotic stress responses. In the present study, we raised rice transgenics over-expressing stress-responsive OsHOX24 gene (rice homeodomain-leucine zipper I sub-family member) and analyzed their response to various abiotic stresses at different stages of development. At the seed germination stage, rice transgenics over-expressing OsHOX24 exhibited enhanced sensitivity to abiotic stress conditions and abscisic acid as compared to wild-type (WT). OsHOX24 over-expression rice seedlings showed reduced root and shoot growth under salinity and desiccation stress (DS) conditions. Various physiological and phenotypic assays confirmed higher susceptibility of rice transgenics toward abiotic stresses as compared to WT at mature and reproductive stages of rice development too. Global gene expression profiling revealed differential regulation of several genes in the transgenic plants under control and DS conditions. Many of these differentially expressed genes were found to be involved in transcriptional regulatory activities, besides carbohydrate, nucleic acid and lipid metabolic processes and response to abiotic stress and hormones. Taken together, our findings highlighted the role of OsHOX24 in regulation of abiotic stress responses via modulating the expression of stress-responsive genes in rice.
NA	Genome-wide discovery of OsHOX24-binding sites and regulation of desiccation stress response in rice	2020	Plant Mol Biol	School of Computational & Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, 110067, India.	OsHOX24 mediates regulation of desiccation stress response via complex regulatory network as indicated by its binding to several target genes including transcription factors in rice. HD-ZIP I subfamily of homeobox transcription factors (TFs) are involved in abiotic stress responses and plant development. Previously, we demonstrated the role of OsHOX24, a member of HD-ZIP I subfamily, in abiotic stress responses. In this study, we identified downstream targets of OsHOX24 under control and desiccation stress conditions via chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) approach in wild-type and OsHOX24 over-expression transgenic in rice. OsHOX24-binding sites in each sample and differential binding sites between the samples were detected at various genomic locations, including genic and intergenic regions. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that OsHOX24 direct target genes were involved in several biological processes, including plant development, ABA-mediated signalling pathway, ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, ion transport, abiotic and biotic stress responses besides transcriptional and translational regulation. The enrichment of several cis-regulatory motifs representing binding sites of other TFs, such as ABFs, ERF1, MYB1, LTREs and SORLIP2, suggested the involvement of OsHOX24 in a complex regulatory network. These findings indicate that OsHOX24-mediated desiccation stress regulation involves modulation of a plethora of target genes, which participate in diverse pathways in rice.
NA	A comprehensive transcriptome analysis of contrasting rice cultivars highlights the role of auxin and ABA responsive genes in heat stress response	2021	Genomics	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.	Sensing a change in ambient temperature is key to survival among all living organisms. Temperature fluctuations due to climate change are a matter of grave concern since it adversely affects growth and eventually the yield of crop plants, including two of the major cereals, i.e., rice and wheat. Thus, to understand the response of rice seedlings to elevated temperatures, we performed microarray-based transcriptome analysis of two contrasting rice cultivars, Annapurna (heat tolerant) and IR64 (heat susceptible), by subjecting their seedlings to 37 °„C and 42 °„C, sequentially. The transcriptome analyses revealed a set of uniquely regulated genes and related pathways in red rice cultivar Annapurna, particularly associated with auxin and ABA as a part of heat stress response in rice. The changes in expression of few auxin and ABA associated genes, such as OsIAA13, OsIAA20, ILL8, OsbZIP12, OsPP2C51, OsDi19-1 and OsHOX24, among others, were validated under high-temperature conditions using RT-qPCR. In particular, the expression of auxin-inducible SAUR genes was enhanced considerably at both elevated temperatures. Further, using genes that expressed inversely under heat vs. cold temperature conditions, we built a regulatory network between transcription factors (TF) such as HSFs, NAC, WRKYs, bHLHs or bZIPs and their target gene pairs and determined regulatory coordination in their expression under varying temperature conditions. Our work thus provides useful insights into temperature-responsive genes, particularly under elevated temperature conditions, and could serve as a resource of candidate genes associated with thermotolerance or downstream components of temperature sensors in rice.
