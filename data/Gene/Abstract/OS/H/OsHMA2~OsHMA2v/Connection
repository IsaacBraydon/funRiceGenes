OsHMA2|OsHMA2v	OsNRAMP5	Silicon reduces cadmium accumulation by suppressing expression of transporter genes involved in cadmium uptake and translocation in rice.	 The expression level of OsNramp5 and OsHMA2 was down-regulated by Si in the WTs, but not in the mutants
OsHMA2|OsHMA2v	qCdT7|OsHMA3	Effective reduction of cadmium accumulation in rice grain by expressing OsHMA3 under the control of OsHMA2 promoter.	Effective reduction of cadmium accumulation in rice grain by expressing OsHMA3 under the control of OsHMA2 promoter.
OsHMA2|OsHMA2v	qCdT7|OsHMA3	Effective reduction of cadmium accumulation in rice grain by expressing OsHMA3 under the control of OsHMA2 promoter.	 The aim of this study is to manipulate both expression and tissue localization of OsHMA3, a tonoplast-localized Cd transporter in the roots by expressing it under the control of OsHMA2 promoter, which shows high expression in different organs including roots, nodes and shoots
OsHMA2|OsHMA2v	qCdT7|OsHMA3	Effective reduction of cadmium accumulation in rice grain by expressing OsHMA3 under the control of OsHMA2 promoter.	 These results indicate that expression of OsHMA3 under the control of OsHMA2 promoter can effectively reduce Cd accumulation in rice grain through sequestering more Cd into the vacuoles of various tissues
OsHMA2|OsHMA2v	OsLCT1	Co-expression of multiple heavy metal transporters changes the translocation, accumulation, and potential oxidative stress of Cd and Zn in rice (Oryza sativa).	The OsHMA2, OsLCT1 and OsZIP3 transporters were all involved in zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) transport
