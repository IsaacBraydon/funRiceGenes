OsHMA2|OsHMA2v	 The expression level of OsNramp5 and OsHMA2 was down-regulated by Si in the WTs, but not in the mutants
OsHMA2|OsHMA2v	 The aim of this study is to manipulate both expression and tissue localization of OsHMA3, a tonoplast-localized Cd transporter in the roots by expressing it under the control of OsHMA2 promoter, which shows high expression in different organs including roots, nodes and shoots |  These results indicate that expression of OsHMA3 under the control of OsHMA2 promoter can effectively reduce Cd accumulation in rice grain through sequestering more Cd into the vacuoles of various tissues
OsHMA2|OsHMA2v	 Furthermore, the expression of the Cd transporter genes, OsHMA2, OsHMA3 and OsLCT1 were curtailed in NPs-treated rice plants under normal and drought stress conditions
