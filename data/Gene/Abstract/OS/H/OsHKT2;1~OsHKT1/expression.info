OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	 Of these, the sodium transporter gene OsHKT2;1 emerged as a key factor that impacts on KUE based on (i) the correlation between shoot Na+ and KUE, and (ii) higher levels of HKT2;1 expression in high KUE lines
OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	Expression levels of the Na+/K+ transporter OsHKT2;1 and vacuolar Na+/H+ exchanger OsNHX1, Na enrichment, maintaining the photosynthetic abilities and growth performances of indica rice seedlings under salt stress. |  Pokkali (15<U+00A0>min after salt stress) due to the higher expression of OsHKT2;1 gene (by 2
OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	 Together, our findings reveal that salt-induced OsPRR73 expression confers salt tolerance by recruiting HDAC10 to transcriptionally repress OsHKT2;1, thus reducing cellular Na+ accumulation
