However, little is known how HXKs regulate growth and development in planta. In rice, there are 10 members of the HXK gene family. One of them, OsHXK10, is preferentially expressed in stamen. This study aims to determine the in vivo role of OsHXK10. The promoter of OsHXK10 was found to drive the expression of β-glucuronidase (GUS) specifically in the anther wall and mature and germinating pollens as well as in palea of rice flower. Interestingly, similar promoter expression pattern was also found in Arabidopsis. Analyses of plants transformed with OsHXK10–green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion construct suggest that OsHXK10 is localized in the cytoplasm. Suppression of OsHXK10 expression in rice by using RNAi approach showed that the anthers of some flowers in the RNAi lines were unable to dehisce, probably due to inhibition in cell wall thickening of the anthers. The non-dehiscent anther flower (ndaF) failed to shed pollens. Real-time RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analysis revealed that OsHXK10 mRNA level was significantly reduced in the ndaF, particularly in their anther walls, as compared to that of the normal flower. Pollens collected from the RNAi lines appeared to be morphologically normal with similar level of cell wall polysaccharides and starch deposition, as compared with that of the wild-type. However, their germination capacity was markedly decreased. By seed maturity, the proportion of empty seed was significantly increased in the OsHXK10 RNAi lines than that of the wild-type. The results demonstrate that OsHXK10 plays an essential role in anther dehiscence, pollen germination and hence grain filling in rice.

Hexokinase (HXK) is a dual-function enzyme that both phosphorylates hexose to form hexose 6-phosphate and plays an important role in sugar sensing and signaling. To investigate the roles of hexokinases in rice growth and development, we analyzed rice sequence databases and isolated ten rice hexokinase cDNAs, OsHXK1 (Oryza sativa Hexokinase 1) through OsHXK10. With the exception of the single-exon gene OsHXK1, the OsHXKs all have a highly conserved genomic structure consisting of nine exons and eight introns. Gene expression profiling revealed that OsHXK2 through OsHXK9 are expressed ubiquitously in various organs, whereas OsHXK10 expression is pollen-specific. Sugars induced the expression of three OsHXKs, OsHXK2, OsHXK5, and OsHXK6, in excised leaves, while suppressing OsHXK7 expression in excised leaves and immature seeds. The hexokinase activity of the OsHXKs was confirmed by functional complementation of the hexokinase-deficient yeast strain YSH7.4-3C (hxk1, hxk2, glk1). OsHXK4 was able to complement this mutant only after the chloroplast-transit peptide was removed. The subcellular localization of OsHXK4 and OsHXK7, observed with green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion constructs, indicated that OsHXK4 is a plastid-stroma-targeted hexokinase while OsHXK7 localizes to the cytosol.
