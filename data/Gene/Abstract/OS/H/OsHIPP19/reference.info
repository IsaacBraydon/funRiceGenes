NA	Multiple variants of the fungal effector AVR-Pik bind the HMA domain of the rice protein OsHIPP19, providing a foundation to engineer plant defence	2021	J Biol Chem	Department of Biological Chemistry, John Innes Centre, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, NR4 7UH, UK.	Microbial plant pathogens secrete effector proteins which manipulate the host to promote infection. Effectors can be recognised by plant intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors, initiating an immune response. The AVR-Pik effector from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is recognised by a pair of rice NLR receptors, Pik-1 and Pik-2. Pik-1 contains a non-canonical integrated heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain, which directly binds AVR-Pik to activate plant defences. The host targets of AVR-Pik are also HMA domain-containing proteins, namely heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant proteins (HIPPs) and heavy metal-associated plant proteins (HPPs). Here, we demonstrate that one of these targets interacts with a wider set of AVR-Pik variants compared to the Pik-1 HMA domains. We define the biochemical and structural basis of the interaction between AVR-Pik and OsHIPP19, and compare the interaction to that formed with the HMA domain of Pik-1. Using analytical gel filtration and surface plasmon resonance, we show that multiple AVR-Pik variants, including the stealthy variants AVR-PikC and AVR-PikF which do not interact with any characterised Pik-1 alleles, bind to OsHIPP19 with nanomolar affinity. The crystal structure of OsHIPP19 in complex with AVR-PikF reveals differences at the interface that underpin high-affinity binding of OsHIPP19-HMA to a wider set of AVR-Pik variants than achieved by the integrated HMA domain of Pik-1. Our results provide a foundation for engineering the HMA domain of Pik-1 to extend binding to currently unrecognised AVR-Pik variants and expand disease resistance in rice to divergent pathogen strains.
NA	Effector target-guided engineering of an integrated domain expands the disease resistance profile of a rice NLR immune receptor.	2023	Elife	Department of Biological Chemistry, John Innes Centre, Norwich, United Kingdom.	A subset of plant intracellular NLR immune receptors detect effector proteins, secreted by phytopathogens to promote infection, through unconventional integrated domains which resemble the effector&#x27;s host targets. Direct binding of effectors to these integrated domains activates plant defenses. The rice NLR receptor Pik-1 binds the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR-Pik through an integrated heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain. However, the stealthy alleles AVR-PikC and AVR-PikF avoid interaction with Pik-HMA and evade host defenses. Here, we exploited knowledge of the biochemical interactions between AVR-Pik and its host target, OsHIPP19, to engineer novel Pik-1 variants that respond to AVR-PikC/F. First, we exchanged the HMA domain of Pikp-1 for OsHIPP19-HMA, demonstrating that effector targets can be incorporated into NLR receptors to provide novel recognition profiles. Second, we used the structure of OsHIPP19-HMA to guide the mutagenesis of Pikp-HMA to expand its recognition profile. We demonstrate that the extended recognition profiles of engineered Pikp-1 variants correlate with effector binding in planta and in vitro, and with the gain of new contacts across the effector/HMA interface. Crucially, transgenic rice producing the engineered Pikp-1 variants was resistant to blast fungus isolates carrying AVR-PikC or AVR-PikF. These results demonstrate that effector target-guided engineering of NLR receptors can provide new-to-nature disease resistance in crops.
