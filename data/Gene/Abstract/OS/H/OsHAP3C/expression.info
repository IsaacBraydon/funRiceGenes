OsHAP3C|OsNF-YB4	Overexpression of OsNF-YB4 leads to flowering early, improving photosynthesis and better grain yield in hybrid rice. |  In this study, flowering early was observed in the hybrid rice with overexpression of OsNF-YB4 |  All these results demonstrate that overexpression of OsNF-YB4 in the hybrid rice activates flowering early and improves photosynthesis resulting in better grain yield with shorter growth period	Overexpression of OsNF-YB4 leads to flowering early, improving photosynthesis and better grain yield in hybrid rice. |  In this study, flowering early was observed in the hybrid rice with overexpression of OsNF-YB4 |  All these results demonstrate that overexpression of OsNF-YB4 in the hybrid rice activates flowering early and improves photosynthesis resulting in better grain yield with shorter growth period
