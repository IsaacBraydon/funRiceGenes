A HAP complex, which consists of three subunits, namely HAP2 (also called NF-YA or CBF-B), HAP3 (NF-YB/CBF-A) and HAP5 (NF-YC/CBF-C), binds to CCAAT sequences in a promoter to control the expression of target genes. We identified 10 HAP2 genes, 11 HAP3 genes and 7 HAP5 genes in the rice genome. All the three HAP family genes encode a protein with a conserved domain in each family and various non-conserved regions in both length and amino acid sequence. These genes showed various expression patterns depending on genes, and various combinations of overlapped expression of the HAP2, HAP3 and HAP5 genes were observed. Furthermore, protein interaction analyses showed interaction of OsHAP3A, a ubiquitously expressed HAP3 subunit of rice, with specific members of HAP5. These results indicate that the formation of specific complex with various HAP subunits combinations can be achieved by both tissue specific expression of three subunit genes and specific interaction of three subunit proteins. This may suggest that the HAP complexes may control various aspects of rice growth and development through tissue specific expression and complex formation of three subunit members.
j.1365-313X.2003.01897.x.pdf	OsHAP3 genes regulate chloroplast biogenesis in rice	2003	The Plant Journal	Plant Genetics Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, 1111 Yata, Mishima, Shizuoka-ken 411-8540, Japan.	We have isolated three genes that potentially encode a HAP3/nuclear factor-YB (NF-YB)/CCAAT binding factor-A (CBF-A) subunit of a CCAAT-box binding complex in rice (Oryza sativa), and named them OsHAP3A, OsHAP3B and OsHAP3C. These genes were expressed in various organs including leaves. In the transgenic rice plants with antisense or RNAi construct of OsHAP3A, reduced expression of not only OsHAP3A but also OsHAP3B and OsHAP3C was observed. These plants had pale green leaves, in which the amount of chlorophyll was reduced and chloroplasts were degenerated. Lamella was not well developed and accumulation of starch was not detected. The degenerated chloroplast formation was accompanied by reduced expression of nuclear-encoded photosynthesis genes such as RBCS and CAB, while expression of chloroplast-encoded genes was not affected or rather increased. These results suggest that one or more OsHAP3 genes regulate the expression of nuclear-encoded chloroplast-targeted genes and normal development of chloroplasts.
NA	Overexpression of OsNF-YB4 leads to flowering early, improving photosynthesis and better grain yield in hybrid rice.	2023	Plant Sci	Institute of Biotechnology and Nuclear Technology, Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 106 Shizishan Road, Chengdu 610061, Sichuan, China.	For cereal crops, such as rice, the grain yield mainly comes from the accumulation of carbohydrates in the seed, which depends ultimately on photosynthesis during the growth period. To create early ripen variety, higher efficiency of photosynthesis is thus necessary to get higher grain yield with shorter growth period. In this study, flowering early was observed in the hybrid rice with overexpression of OsNF-YB4. Along with the flowering early, the hybrid rice also was shorter in plant height with less of leaves and internodes, but no changes of panicle length and leaf emergence. The grain yield was kept or even increased in the hybrid rice with shorter growth period. Transcription analysis revealed that Ghd7-Ehd1-Hd3a/RFT1 was activated early to promote the flowering transition in the overexpression hybrids. RNA-Seq study further showed that carbohydrate-related pathways were significantly altered in addition to circadian pathway. Notably, up-regulation of three pathways related to plant photosynthesis was observed, as well. Increased carbon assimilation with alteration of chlorophyll contents was subsequently detected in the following physiological experiments. All these results demonstrate that overexpression of OsNF-YB4 in the hybrid rice activates flowering early and improves photosynthesis resulting in better grain yield with shorter growth period.
