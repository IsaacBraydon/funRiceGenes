OsHOS1	The rice E3 ubiquitin ligase OsHOS1 modulates the expression of OsRMC, a gene involved in root mechano-sensing, through the interaction with two ERF transcription factors. |  The straight root phenotype of the RNAi::OsHOS1 plants was correlated with a higher expression of OsRMC (rice ROOT MEANDER CURLING), which encodes a receptor-like kinase characterized as a negative regulator of rice root curling mediated by JA |  Using the yeast two-hybrid system and BiFC assays we showed that OsHOS1 interacts with two ERF transcription factors (TFs), OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2, known to regulate OsRMC gene expression	 The morphological analysis of the roots in transgenic RNAi::OsHOS1 (RNA interference) and wild type (WT) plants, exposed to a mechanical barrier, revealed that the OsHOS1 silencing plants keep a straight root in contrast to WT that exhibit root curling |  The straight root phenotype of the RNAi::OsHOS1 plants was correlated with a higher expression of OsRMC (rice ROOT MEANDER CURLING), which encodes a receptor-like kinase characterized as a negative regulator of rice root curling mediated by JA
