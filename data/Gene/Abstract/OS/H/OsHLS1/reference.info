NA	OsHLS1 regulates plant height and development by controlling active gibberellin accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2022	Plant Sci	Key laboratory of Plant Resource Conservation and Germplasm Innovation in Mountainous Region (Ministry of Education), College of Life Sciences/Institute of Agro-bioengineering, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, Guizhou Province, China.	In this study, we identified a gene related to plant height, leaf, and premature senescence in rice, and named it OsHLS1. Through bioinformatics analysis, it was found that this gene belongs to a new gene family-HLS family, and this gene family exists widely in higher plants. Expression of OsHLS1 was significantly brought about by gibberellin (GA). Subcellular localization showed that OsHLS1 was located in the nucleus. oshls1-3 displayed a GA-deficient phenotype, with dwarf plants. In addition, oshls1-3 also showed premature senescence, shorter and narrower leaves, and pollen abortion. Exogenous GA(3) can restore the plant height of oshls1-3. Histomorphological analysis showed that the gene affected the progress of internode cells in the first and third nodes under the rice panicle. Through the verification of the homologous gene AT4G25690 in Arabidopsis, it was found that the mutant at4g25690 lines also showed plant dwarfing, premature senescence, and shortening and narrowing of leaves and pollen abortion. OsHLS1 affected the expression levels of genes involved in the GA metabolic pathway and affected the content of active GA, thereby regulating plant height development in rice. In conclusion, we suggest that OsHLS1 regulates plant height and development by controlling the accumulation of active gibberellins in rice.
