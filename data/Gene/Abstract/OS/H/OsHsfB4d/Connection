OsHsfB4d	OsHsp18.0-CI|Oshsp18.0|OsMSR3	OsHsfB4d Binds the Promoter and Regulates the Expression of OsHsp18.0-CI to Resistant Against Xanthomonas Oryzae.	OsHsfB4d Binds the Promoter and Regulates the Expression of OsHsp18.0-CI to Resistant Against Xanthomonas Oryzae.
OsHsfB4b	OsHsfB4d	OsHsfB4b Confers Enhanced Drought Tolerance in Transgenic Arabidopsis and Rice.	 Both OsHsfB4b and OsHsfB4d showed strong responses to the stress treatment
OsHsfB4b	OsHsfB4d	OsHsfB4b Confers Enhanced Drought Tolerance in Transgenic Arabidopsis and Rice.	 The results of subcellular localization showed that the OsHsfB4b protein was in the nucleus whereas the OsHsfB4d protein was located in both the nucleus and cytoplasm
OsHsfB4b	OsHsfB4d	OsHsfB4b Confers Enhanced Drought Tolerance in Transgenic Arabidopsis and Rice.	 This study provides a basis for understanding the function and evolutionary history of the OsHsf gene family, enriching our knowledge of understanding the biological functions of OsHsfB4b and OsHsfB4d genes involved in the stress response in rice, and also reveals the potential value of OsHsfB4b in rice environmental adaptation improvement
