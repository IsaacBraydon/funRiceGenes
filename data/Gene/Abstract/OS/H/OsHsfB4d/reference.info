NA	OsHsfB4d Binds the Promoter and Regulates the Expression of OsHsp18.0-CI to Resistant Against Xanthomonas Oryzae.	2020	Rice	State Key Laboratory of Crop Biology, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai' an, 271018, Shandong, PR China.	BACKGROUND: Bacterial leaf streak (BLS) and bacterial blight (BB) are two major prevalent and devastating rice bacterial diseases caused by the Gram-negative bacteria of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), respectively. Previously, we identified a defence-related (DR) gene encoding a small heat shock protein, OsHsp18.0-CI, that positively regulates BLS and BB resistance in rice.  RESULTS: To reveal the regulatory mechanism of the OsHsp18.0-CI response to Xoc and Xoo, we characterized the class B heat shock factor (Hsf), OsHsfB4d, through transcriptional analysis and a transgenic study. OsHsfB4d is upregulated post inoculation by either the Xoc strain RS105 or Xoo strain PXO99a in Zhonghua 11 (wild type, ZH11) as well as in OsHsp18.0-CI overexpressing rice plants. Transient expression of OsHsfB4d can activate the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and luciferase (Luc) via the OsHsp18.0-CI promoter. Rice plants overexpressing OsHsfB4d exhibited enhanced resistance to RS105 and PXO99a as well as increased expression of OsHsp18.0-CI and pathogenesis-related genes. Furthermore, we found that OsHsfB4d directly binds to a DNA fragment carrying the only perfect heat shock element (HSE) in the promoter of OsHsp18.0-CI.  CONCLUSION: Overall, we reveal that OsHsfB4d, a class B Hsf, acts as a positive regulator of OsHsp18.0-CI to mediate BLS and BB resistance in rice.
NA	OsHsfB4b Confers Enhanced Drought Tolerance in Transgenic Arabidopsis and Rice.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	College of Life Sciences, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang 641004, China.	Heat shock factors (Hsfs) play pivotal roles in plant stress responses and confer stress tolerance. However, the functions of several Hsfs in rice (Oryza sativa L.) are not yet known. In this study, genome-wide analysis of the Hsf gene family in rice was performed. A total of 25 OsHsf genes were identified, which could be clearly clustered into three major groups, A, B, and C, based on the characteristics of the sequences. Bioinformatics analysis showed that tandem duplication and fragment replication were two important driving forces in the process of evolution and expansion of the OsHsf family genes. Both OsHsfB4b and OsHsfB4d showed strong responses to the stress treatment. The results of subcellular localization showed that the OsHsfB4b protein was in the nucleus whereas the OsHsfB4d protein was located in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Over-expression of the OsHsfB4b gene in Arabidopsis and rice can increase the resistance to drought stress. This study provides a basis for understanding the function and evolutionary history of the OsHsf gene family, enriching our knowledge of understanding the biological functions of OsHsfB4b and OsHsfB4d genes involved in the stress response in rice, and also reveals the potential value of OsHsfB4b in rice environmental adaptation improvement.
