NA	OsHsfB4d Binds the Promoter and Regulates the Expression of OsHsp18.0-CI to Resistant Against Xanthomonas Oryzae.	2020	Rice	State Key Laboratory of Crop Biology, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai' an, 271018, Shandong, PR China.	BACKGROUND: Bacterial leaf streak (BLS) and bacterial blight (BB) are two major prevalent and devastating rice bacterial diseases caused by the Gram-negative bacteria of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), respectively. Previously, we identified a defence-related (DR) gene encoding a small heat shock protein, OsHsp18.0-CI, that positively regulates BLS and BB resistance in rice.  RESULTS: To reveal the regulatory mechanism of the OsHsp18.0-CI response to Xoc and Xoo, we characterized the class B heat shock factor (Hsf), OsHsfB4d, through transcriptional analysis and a transgenic study. OsHsfB4d is upregulated post inoculation by either the Xoc strain RS105 or Xoo strain PXO99a in Zhonghua 11 (wild type, ZH11) as well as in OsHsp18.0-CI overexpressing rice plants. Transient expression of OsHsfB4d can activate the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and luciferase (Luc) via the OsHsp18.0-CI promoter. Rice plants overexpressing OsHsfB4d exhibited enhanced resistance to RS105 and PXO99a as well as increased expression of OsHsp18.0-CI and pathogenesis-related genes. Furthermore, we found that OsHsfB4d directly binds to a DNA fragment carrying the only perfect heat shock element (HSE) in the promoter of OsHsp18.0-CI.  CONCLUSION: Overall, we reveal that OsHsfB4d, a class B Hsf, acts as a positive regulator of OsHsp18.0-CI to mediate BLS and BB resistance in rice.
