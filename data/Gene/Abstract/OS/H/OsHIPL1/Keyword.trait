OsHIPL1	seed	OsHIPL1, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.	 RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that the ABA-related genes were involved in the OsHIPL1 regulation of seed vigour in rice
OsHIPL1	seed	OsHIPL1, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.	 These results indicate that the regulation of seed vigour of OsHIPL1 may be through modulating endogenous ABA levels and altering OsABIs expression during seed germination in rice
OsHIPL1	seed	OsHIPL1, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.	 Meanwhile, we found that OsHIPL1 interacted with the aquaporin OsPIP1;1, then affected water uptake to promote rice seed germination
OsHIPL1	seed	OsHIPL1, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.	 Based on analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphism data of rice accessions, we identified a Hap1 haplotype of OsHIPL1 that was positively correlated with seed germination
OsHIPL1	seed	OsHIPL1, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.	 Our findings showed novel insights into the molecular mechanism of OsHIPL1 on seed vigour
OsHIPL1	seed germination	OsHIPL1, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.	 These results indicate that the regulation of seed vigour of OsHIPL1 may be through modulating endogenous ABA levels and altering OsABIs expression during seed germination in rice

OsHIPL1	ABA	OsHIPL1, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.	 The higher levels of endogenous ABA were measured in germinating seeds of OsHIPL1 mutants and NIL-qsv3 line compared to IR26 plants, with two up-regulated ABA biosynthesis genes (OsZEP and OsNCED4) and one down-regulated ABA catabolism gene OsABA8ox3

OsHIPL1	nucleus	OsHIPL1, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.	 OsHIPL1 was mainly localized in the plasma membrane and nucleus
OsHIPL1	abscisic acid	OsHIPL1, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.	 The expression of abscisic acid-insensitive 3 (OsABI3), OsABI4 and OsABI5 was significantly up-regulated in germinating seeds of OsHIPL1 mutants and NIL-qsv3 line compared to IR26 plants
