The cultivation of rice varieties with high seed vigour is vital for the direct seeding of rice, and the molecular basis of regulation of seed vigour remains elusive. Here, we cloned a new gene OsHIPL1, which encodes hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein as a causal gene of the major QTL qSV3 for rice seed vigour. OsHIPL1 was mainly localized in the plasma membrane and nucleus. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that the ABA-related genes were involved in the OsHIPL1 regulation of seed vigour in rice. The higher levels of endogenous ABA were measured in germinating seeds of OsHIPL1 mutants and NIL-qsv3 line compared to IR26 plants, with two up-regulated ABA biosynthesis genes (OsZEP and OsNCED4) and one down-regulated ABA catabolism gene OsABA8ox3. The expression of abscisic acid-insensitive 3 (OsABI3), OsABI4 and OsABI5 was significantly up-regulated in germinating seeds of OsHIPL1 mutants and NIL-qsv3 line compared to IR26 plants. These results indicate that the regulation of seed vigour of OsHIPL1 may be through modulating endogenous ABA levels and altering OsABIs expression during seed germination in rice. Meanwhile, we found that OsHIPL1 interacted with the aquaporin OsPIP1;1, then affected water uptake to promote rice seed germination. Based on analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphism data of rice accessions, we identified a Hap1 haplotype of OsHIPL1 that was positively correlated with seed germination. Our findings showed novel insights into the molecular mechanism of OsHIPL1 on seed vigour.
