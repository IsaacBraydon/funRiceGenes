OsHIPL1	 The expression of abscisic acid-insensitive 3 (OsABI3), OsABI4 and OsABI5 was significantly up-regulated in germinating seeds of OsHIPL1 mutants and NIL-qsv3 line compared to IR26 plants |  These results indicate that the regulation of seed vigour of OsHIPL1 may be through modulating endogenous ABA levels and altering OsABIs expression during seed germination in rice
