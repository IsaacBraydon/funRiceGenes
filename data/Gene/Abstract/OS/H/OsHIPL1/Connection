OsABA8ox3	OsHIPL1	OsHIPL1, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.	 The higher levels of endogenous ABA were measured in germinating seeds of OsHIPL1 mutants and NIL-qsv3 line compared to IR26 plants, with two up-regulated ABA biosynthesis genes (OsZEP and OsNCED4) and one down-regulated ABA catabolism gene OsABA8ox3
OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsHIPL1	OsHIPL1, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.	 The expression of abscisic acid-insensitive 3 (OsABI3), OsABI4 and OsABI5 was significantly up-regulated in germinating seeds of OsHIPL1 mutants and NIL-qsv3 line compared to IR26 plants
OsABI4	OsHIPL1	OsHIPL1, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.	 The expression of abscisic acid-insensitive 3 (OsABI3), OsABI4 and OsABI5 was significantly up-regulated in germinating seeds of OsHIPL1 mutants and NIL-qsv3 line compared to IR26 plants
OsHIPL1	OsNCED4	OsHIPL1, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.	 The higher levels of endogenous ABA were measured in germinating seeds of OsHIPL1 mutants and NIL-qsv3 line compared to IR26 plants, with two up-regulated ABA biosynthesis genes (OsZEP and OsNCED4) and one down-regulated ABA catabolism gene OsABA8ox3
OsHIPL1	OsPIP1;1|RWC1	OsHIPL1, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.	 Meanwhile, we found that OsHIPL1 interacted with the aquaporin OsPIP1;1, then affected water uptake to promote rice seed germination
