OsHIPP16	 Expression of OsHIPP16 in the yeast mutant strain ycf1 sensitive to Cd conferred cellular tolerance |  These results suggest that adequate expression of OsHIPP16 would profoundly contribute to Cd detoxification by regulating Cd accumulation in rice, suggesting that both OE and oshipp16 mutant plants have great potentials for restricting Cd acquisition in the rice crop and phytoremediation of Cd-contaminated wetland soils
