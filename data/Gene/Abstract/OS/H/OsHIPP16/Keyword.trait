OsHIPP16	leaf	A metal chaperone OsHIPP16 detoxifies cadmium by repressing its accumulation in rice crops.	 Histochemical analysis with pHIPP16::GUS reveals that OsHIPP16 is primarily expressed in root and leaf vascular tissues
OsHIPP16	root	A metal chaperone OsHIPP16 detoxifies cadmium by repressing its accumulation in rice crops.	 Histochemical analysis with pHIPP16::GUS reveals that OsHIPP16 is primarily expressed in root and leaf vascular tissues
OsHIPP16	growth	A metal chaperone OsHIPP16 detoxifies cadmium by repressing its accumulation in rice crops.	 Transgenic rice overexpressing OsHIPP16 (OE) improved rice growth with increased plant height, biomass, and chlorophyll content but with a lower degree of oxidative injury and Cd accumulation, whereas knocking out OsHIPP16 by CRISPR-Cas9 compromised the growth and physiological response
OsHIPP16	stress	A metal chaperone OsHIPP16 detoxifies cadmium by repressing its accumulation in rice crops.	 OsHIPP16 was strongly induced by Cd stress
OsHIPP16	tolerance	A metal chaperone OsHIPP16 detoxifies cadmium by repressing its accumulation in rice crops.	 Expression of OsHIPP16 in the yeast mutant strain ycf1 sensitive to Cd conferred cellular tolerance
OsHIPP16	oxidative	A metal chaperone OsHIPP16 detoxifies cadmium by repressing its accumulation in rice crops.	 Transgenic rice overexpressing OsHIPP16 (OE) improved rice growth with increased plant height, biomass, and chlorophyll content but with a lower degree of oxidative injury and Cd accumulation, whereas knocking out OsHIPP16 by CRISPR-Cas9 compromised the growth and physiological response
OsHIPP16	plant height	A metal chaperone OsHIPP16 detoxifies cadmium by repressing its accumulation in rice crops.	 Transgenic rice overexpressing OsHIPP16 (OE) improved rice growth with increased plant height, biomass, and chlorophyll content but with a lower degree of oxidative injury and Cd accumulation, whereas knocking out OsHIPP16 by CRISPR-Cas9 compromised the growth and physiological response
OsHIPP16	cadmium	A metal chaperone OsHIPP16 detoxifies cadmium by repressing its accumulation in rice crops.	A metal chaperone OsHIPP16 detoxifies cadmium by repressing its accumulation in rice crops.
OsHIPP16	chlorophyll	A metal chaperone OsHIPP16 detoxifies cadmium by repressing its accumulation in rice crops.	 Transgenic rice overexpressing OsHIPP16 (OE) improved rice growth with increased plant height, biomass, and chlorophyll content but with a lower degree of oxidative injury and Cd accumulation, whereas knocking out OsHIPP16 by CRISPR-Cas9 compromised the growth and physiological response
OsHIPP16	detoxification	A metal chaperone OsHIPP16 detoxifies cadmium by repressing its accumulation in rice crops.	 These results suggest that adequate expression of OsHIPP16 would profoundly contribute to Cd detoxification by regulating Cd accumulation in rice, suggesting that both OE and oshipp16 mutant plants have great potentials for restricting Cd acquisition in the rice crop and phytoremediation of Cd-contaminated wetland soils
OsHIPP16	chlorophyll content	A metal chaperone OsHIPP16 detoxifies cadmium by repressing its accumulation in rice crops.	 Transgenic rice overexpressing OsHIPP16 (OE) improved rice growth with increased plant height, biomass, and chlorophyll content but with a lower degree of oxidative injury and Cd accumulation, whereas knocking out OsHIPP16 by CRISPR-Cas9 compromised the growth and physiological response
