OsAOS1	OsHI-LOX|OsLOX9	OsMPK3 positively regulates the JA signaling pathway and plant resistance to a chewing herbivore in rice	Silencing OsMPK3 (ir-mpk3) reduced the expression of the gene by 50-70 %, decreased elicited levels of JA and diminished the expression of a lipoxygenase gene OsHI-LOX and an allene oxide synthase gene OsAOS1
OsACS2	OsHI-LOX|OsLOX9	The chloroplast-localized phospholipases D alpha4 and alpha5 regulate herbivore-induced direct and indirect defenses in rice	Antisense expression of OsPLDalpha4 and -alpha5 (as-pld), which resulted in a 50% reduction of the expression of the two genes, reduced elicited levels of linolenic acid, JA, green leaf volatiles, and ethylene and attenuated the SSB-induced expression of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (OsMPK3), a lipoxygenase (OsHI-LOX), a hydroperoxide lyase (OsHPL3), as well as a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (OsACS2)
OsHI-LOX|OsLOX9	OsHPL3	The chloroplast-localized phospholipases D alpha4 and alpha5 regulate herbivore-induced direct and indirect defenses in rice	Antisense expression of OsPLDalpha4 and -alpha5 (as-pld), which resulted in a 50% reduction of the expression of the two genes, reduced elicited levels of linolenic acid, JA, green leaf volatiles, and ethylene and attenuated the SSB-induced expression of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (OsMPK3), a lipoxygenase (OsHI-LOX), a hydroperoxide lyase (OsHPL3), as well as a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (OsACS2)
OsACS2	OsHI-LOX|OsLOX9	OsNPR1 negatively regulates herbivore-induced JA and ethylene signaling and plant resistance to a chewing herbivore in rice	The antisense expression of OsNPR1 (as-npr1), which reduced the expression of the gene by 50%, increased elicited levels of JA and ethylene (ET) as well as of expression of a lipoxygenase gene OsHI-LOX and an ACC synthase gene OsACS2
OsHI-LOX|OsLOX9	OsNPR1|NH1	OsNPR1 negatively regulates herbivore-induced JA and ethylene signaling and plant resistance to a chewing herbivore in rice	The antisense expression of OsNPR1 (as-npr1), which reduced the expression of the gene by 50%, increased elicited levels of JA and ethylene (ET) as well as of expression of a lipoxygenase gene OsHI-LOX and an ACC synthase gene OsACS2
OsEIL1|MHZ6	OsHI-LOX|OsLOX9	Novel crosstalk between ethylene- and jasmonic acid-pathway responses to a piercing-sucking insect in rice.	 An RNA-seq analysis revealed that a JA biosynthetic pathway-related gene, OsLOX9, was down-regulated significantly in the oseil1 mutant
OsEIL1|MHZ6	OsHI-LOX|OsLOX9	Novel crosstalk between ethylene- and jasmonic acid-pathway responses to a piercing-sucking insect in rice.	 Biochemical analyses including yeast one-hybrid, Dual-LUC (Dual luciferase) and EMSA (Electrophoretic mobility shift assay) confirmed the direct regulation of OsLOX9 by OsEIL1
OsEIL1|MHZ6	OsHI-LOX|OsLOX9	Novel crosstalk between ethylene- and jasmonic acid-pathway responses to a piercing-sucking insect in rice.	 The synergistic mechanism was realized by transcriptional regulation of OsEIL1 on OsLOX9
