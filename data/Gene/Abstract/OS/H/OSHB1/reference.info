PNAS-2007-Nagasaki-14867-71.pdf	The small interfering RNA production pathway is required for shoot meristem initiation in rice	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	The shoot apical meristem (SAM) is a group of stem cells that are responsible for plant development. Mutations in rice SHOOTLESS2 (SHL2), SHL4/SHOOT ORGANIZATION2 (SHO2), and SHO1 cause complete deletion or abnormal formation of the SAM. In this study we showed that defects in SAM formation in shl mutants are associated with the loss of expression of the homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIPIII) family genes. Rice SHL2, SHL4/SHO2, and SHO1 encoded orthologues of Arabidopsis RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6, ARGONAUTE (AGO) 7, and DICER-like 4, respectively, whose mutations affect leaf development through the trans-acting siRNA (ta-siRNA) pathway. This suggested that the ta-siRNA pathway regulates the critical step of SAM formation during rice embryogenesis. The gain-of-function experiment by the ectopic expression of SHL4 resulted in reduced accumulation of an microRNA, miR166, and partial adaxialization of leaves, supporting a role for the ta-siRNA pathway in the maintenance of leaf polarity as previously reported in maize. Analysis of the spatiotemporal expression patterns of HD-ZIPIII and miR166 in wild-type and shl mutant embryos suggested that the loss of HD-ZIPIII expression in the SAM region of the developing embryo is the result of ectopic expression of miR166. Our analysis of shl mutants demonstrated that HD-ZIPIII expression regulated by miR166 is sensitive to the ta-siRNA pathway during SAM formation in rice embryogenesis.
pp1471960.pdf	Developmental role and auxin responsiveness of Class III homeodomain leucine zipper gene family members in rice	2008	Plant Physiol	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Members of the Class III homeodomain leucine zipper (Class III HD-Zip) gene family are central regulators of crucial aspects of plant development. To better understand the roles of five Class III HD-Zip genes in rice (Oryza sativa) development, we investigated their expression patterns, ectopic expression phenotypes, and auxin responsiveness. Four genes, OSHB1 to OSHB4, were expressed in a localized domain of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), the adaxial cells of leaf primordia, the leaf margins, and the xylem tissue of vascular bundles. In contrast, expression of OSHB5 was observed only in phloem tissue. Plants ectopically expressing microRNA166-resistant versions of the OSHB3 gene exhibited severe defects, including the ectopic production of leaf margins, shoots, and radialized leaves. The treatment of seedlings with auxin quickly induced ectopic OSHB3 expression in the entire region of the SAM, but not in other tissues. Furthermore, this ectopic expression of OSHB3 was correlated with leaf initiation defects. Our findings suggest that rice Class III HD-Zip genes have conserved functions with their homologs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), but have also acquired specific developmental roles in grasses or monocots. In addition, some Class III HD-Zip genes may regulate the leaf initiation process in the SAM in an auxin-dependent manner.
NA	LATERAL FLORET 1 induced the three-florets spikelet in rice.	2017	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Rice Research Institute, Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.	The spikelet is a unique inflorescence structure in grass. The molecular mechanisms behind the development and evolution of the spikelet are far from clear. In this study, a dominant rice mutant, lateral florets 1 (lf1), was characterized. In the lf1 spikelet, lateral floral meristems were promoted unexpectedly and could generally blossom into relatively normal florets. LF1 encoded a class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP III) protein, and the site of mutation in lf1 was located in a putative miRNA165/166 target sequence. Ectopic expression of both LF1 and the meristem maintenance gene OSH1 was detected in the axil of the sterile lemma primordia of the lf1 spikelet. Furthermore, the promoter of OSH1 could be bound directly by LF1 protein. Collectively, these results indicate that the mutation of LF1 induces ectopic expression of OSH1, which results in the initiation of lateral meristems to generate lateral florets in the axil of the sterile lemma. This study thus offers strong evidence in support of the &quot;three-florets spikelet&quot; hypothesis in rice.
