OSHB1|LF1	OSHB4|OsHox32	Developmental role and auxin responsiveness of Class III homeodomain leucine zipper gene family members in rice	Four genes, OSHB1 to OSHB4, were expressed in a localized domain of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), the adaxial cells of leaf primordia, the leaf margins, and the xylem tissue of vascular bundles
OSH1|Oskn1	OSHB1|LF1	LATERAL FLORET 1 induced the three-florets spikelet in rice.	 Ectopic expression of both LF1 and the meristem maintenance gene OSH1 was detected in the axil of the sterile lemma primordia of the lf1 spikelet
OSH1|Oskn1	OSHB1|LF1	LATERAL FLORET 1 induced the three-florets spikelet in rice.	 Furthermore, the promoter of OSH1 could be bound directly by LF1 protein
OSH1|Oskn1	OSHB1|LF1	LATERAL FLORET 1 induced the three-florets spikelet in rice.	 Collectively, these results indicate that the mutation of LF1 induces ectopic expression of OSH1, which results in the initiation of lateral meristems to generate lateral florets in the axil of the sterile lemma
