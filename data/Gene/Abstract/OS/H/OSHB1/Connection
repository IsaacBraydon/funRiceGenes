OSHB1|LF1	OSHB4|OsHox32	Developmental role and auxin responsiveness of Class III homeodomain leucine zipper gene family members in rice	Four genes, OSHB1 to OSHB4, were expressed in a localized domain of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), the adaxial cells of leaf primordia, the leaf margins, and the xylem tissue of vascular bundles
OSH1|Oskn1	OSHB1|LF1	LATERAL FLORET 1 induced the three-florets spikelet in rice.	 Ectopic expression of both LF1 and the meristem maintenance gene OSH1 was detected in the axil of the sterile lemma primordia of the lf1 spikelet
OSH1|Oskn1	OSHB1|LF1	LATERAL FLORET 1 induced the three-florets spikelet in rice.	 Furthermore, the promoter of OSH1 could be bound directly by LF1 protein
OSH1|Oskn1	OSHB1|LF1	LATERAL FLORET 1 induced the three-florets spikelet in rice.	 Collectively, these results indicate that the mutation of LF1 induces ectopic expression of OSH1, which results in the initiation of lateral meristems to generate lateral florets in the axil of the sterile lemma
OsDRB2	OSHB1|LF1	DRB2 Modulates Leaf Rolling by Regulating Accumulation of MicroRNAs Related to Leaf Development in Rice.	 qRT-PCR analysis of 29 related genes suggested that defects of the OsDRB2-miR166-OsHBs pathway could play an important role in formation of the rolled leaf phenotype of rl89, in which OsDRB2 mutation reduced miR166 accumulation, resulting in elevated expressions of the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper genes (such as OsHB1, 3 and 5) involved in leaf polarity and/or morphology development
