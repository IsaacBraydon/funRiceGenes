Development-2000-Scarpella-3655-69.pdf	A role for the rice homeobox gene Oshox1 in provascular cell fate commitment	2000	Development	Institute of Molecular Plant Sciences, Leiden University, Clusius Laboratory, PO Box 9505, The Netherlands.	The vascular tissues of plants form a network of interconnected cell files throughout the plant body. The transition from a genetically totipotent meristematic precursor to different stages of a committed procambial cell, and its subsequent differentiation into a mature vascular element, involves developmental events whose molecular nature is still mostly unknown. The rice protein Oshox1 is a member of the homeodomain leucine zipper family of transcription factors. Here we show that the strikingly precise onset of Oshox1 gene expression marks critical, early stages of provascular ontogenesis in which the developmental fate of procambial cells is specified but not yet stably determined. This suggests that the Oshox1 gene may be involved in the establishment of the conditions required to restrict the developmental potential of procambial cells. In support of this hypothesis, ectopic expression of Oshox1 in provascular cells that normally do not yet express this gene results in anticipation of procambial cell fate commitment, eventually culminating in premature vascular differentiation. Oshox1 represents the first example of a transcription factor whose function can be linked to specification events mediating provascular cell fate commitment.

This paper describes the characterization of Oshox1, a cDNA clone from rice encoding a member of the homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) class of putative transcription factors. Oshox1 maps to chromosome 10 and belongs to a family of related rice genes. Two-hybrid assays showed that Oshox1 protein can homodimerize, but can also form heterodimers with an Arabidopsis HD-Zip protein. This suggests that protein-protein interactions may also occur between different HD-Zip proteins in rice, which would provide enormous versatility for generating specific gene-control mechanisms. Oshox1 mRNA could be detected in various rice tissues at different developmental stages, with highest levels in embryos, shoots of seedlings, and leaves of mature plants. Transgenic expression of Oshox1 in Arabidopsis retarded growth and affected leaf size and shape, indicative of a role as developmental regulator. In vitro and in vivo DNA-binding studies revealed that Oshox1 interacts with the pseudopalindromic sequence CAAT(C/G)ATTG, confirming that the protein represents a transcription factor. Oshox1 was found to repress reporter gene activity in rice suspension cells, most likely by a mechanism of active transcriptional repression. Repression was strictly dependent on the presence of upstream Oshox1 binding sites in the reporter gene constructs and a function of the N-terminal region of Oshox1, preceding the homeodomain.
pp1102001349.pdf	The procambium specification gene Oshox1 promotes polar auxin transport capacity and reduces its sensitivity toward inhibition	2002	Plant Physiol	Institute of Molecular Plant Sciences, Leiden University, Clusius Laboratory, P.O. Box 9505, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands.	The auxin-inducible homeobox gene Oshox1 of rice (Oryza sativa) is a positive regulator of procambial cell fate commitment, and its overexpression reduces the sensitivity of polar auxin transport (PAT) to the PAT inhibitor 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA). Here, we show that wild-type rice leaves formed under conditions of PAT inhibition display vein hypertrophy, reduced distance between longitudinal veins, and increased distance between transverse veins, providing experimental evidence for a role of PAT in vascular patterning in a monocot species. Furthermore, we show that Oshox1 overexpression confers insensitivity to these PAT inhibitor-induced vascular-patterning defects. Finally, we show that in the absence of any overt phenotypical change, Oshox1 overexpression specifically reduces the affinity of the NPA-binding protein toward NPA and enhances PAT and its sensitivity toward auxin. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Oshox1 promotes fate commitment of procambial cells by increasing their auxin conductivity properties and stabilizing this state against modulations of PAT by an endogenous NPA-like molecule.
NA	OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 Redundantly Shape Rice Tiller Angle by Reducing HSFA2D Expression and Auxin Content	2020	Plant Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Tiller angle largely determines plant architecture, which in turn substantially influences crop production by affecting planting density. A recent study revealed that HEAT STRESS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR2D (HSFA2D) acts upstream of LAZY1 (LA1) to regulate tiller angle establishment in rice (Oryza sativa). However, the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of HSFA2D remain unknown. In this study, two class II homeodomain-Leu zipper genes, OsHOX1 and OsHOX28, were identified as positive regulators of tiller angle by affecting shoot gravitropism. OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 showed strong transcriptional suppressive activity in rice protoplasts and formed intricate self- and mutual-transcriptional negative feedback loops. Moreover, OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 bound to the pseudopalindromic sequence CAAT(C/G)ATTG within the promoter of HSFA2D, thus suppressing its expression. In contrast to HSFA2D and LA1, OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 attenuated lateral auxin transport, thus repressing the expression of WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 6 (WOX6) and WOX11 in the lower side of the shoot base of plants subjected to gravistimulation. Genetic analysis further confirmed that OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 act upstream of HSFA2D Additionally, both OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 inhibit the expression of multiple OsYUCCA genes and decrease auxin biosynthesis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 regulate the local distribution of auxin, and thus tiller angle establishment, through suppression of the HSFA2D-LA1 pathway and reduction of endogenous auxin content. Our finding increases the knowledge concerning fine tuning of tiller angles to optimize plant architecture in rice.
