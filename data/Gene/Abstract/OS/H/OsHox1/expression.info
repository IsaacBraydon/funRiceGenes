OsHox1	OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 Redundantly Shape Rice Tiller Angle by Reducing HSFA2D Expression and Auxin Content |  Moreover, OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 bound to the pseudopalindromic sequence CAAT(C/G)ATTG within the promoter of HSFA2D, thus suppressing its expression |  In contrast to HSFA2D and LA1, OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 attenuated lateral auxin transport, thus repressing the expression of WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 6 (WOX6) and WOX11 in the lower side of the shoot base of plants subjected to gravistimulation |  Genetic analysis further confirmed that OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 act upstream of HSFA2D Additionally, both OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 inhibit the expression of multiple OsYUCCA genes and decrease auxin biosynthesis
