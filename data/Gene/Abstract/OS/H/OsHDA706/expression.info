OsHDA706	 In this study, we revealed that the histone deacetylase OsHDA706 epigenetically regulates the expression of salt stress response genes in rice (Oryza sativa L |  OsHDA706 localizes to the nucleus and cytoplasm and OsHDA706 expression is significantly induced under salt stress |  We found that the expression of OsPP2C49 is induced in the oshda706 mutant under salt stress |  Taken together, our results indicate that OsHDA706, a histone H4 deacetylase, participates in the salt stress response by regulating the expression of OsPP2C49 via H4K5 and H4K8 deacetylation
