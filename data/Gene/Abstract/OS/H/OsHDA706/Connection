OsHDA706	OsPP2C49	Histone deacetylase OsHDA706 increases salt tolerance via H4K5/K8 deacetylation of OsPP2C49 in rice.	Histone deacetylase OsHDA706 increases salt tolerance via H4K5/K8 deacetylation of OsPP2C49 in rice.
OsHDA706	OsPP2C49	Histone deacetylase OsHDA706 increases salt tolerance via H4K5/K8 deacetylation of OsPP2C49 in rice.	 We found that the expression of OsPP2C49 is induced in the oshda706 mutant under salt stress
OsHDA706	OsPP2C49	Histone deacetylase OsHDA706 increases salt tolerance via H4K5/K8 deacetylation of OsPP2C49 in rice.	 Taken together, our results indicate that OsHDA706, a histone H4 deacetylase, participates in the salt stress response by regulating the expression of OsPP2C49 via H4K5 and H4K8 deacetylation
