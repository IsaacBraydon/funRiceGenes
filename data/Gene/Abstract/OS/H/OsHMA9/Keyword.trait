OsHMA9	cadmium	Rice P1B-type heavy-metal ATPase, OsHMA9, is a metal efflux protein	Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of seedlings showed that OsHMA9 expression was induced by a high concentration of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and cadmium
OsHMA9	zinc	Rice P1B-type heavy-metal ATPase, OsHMA9, is a metal efflux protein	Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of seedlings showed that OsHMA9 expression was induced by a high concentration of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and cadmium
OsHMA9	seedling	Rice P1B-type heavy-metal ATPase, OsHMA9, is a metal efflux protein	Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of seedlings showed that OsHMA9 expression was induced by a high concentration of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and cadmium
