Oshox14	 Trans-activation assays in yeast and rice protoplasts demonstrated that Oshox12 and Oshox14 can bind to a specific DNA sequence, AH1 (CAAT(A/T)ATTG), and activate reporter gene expression |  Overexpression of Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice resulted in reduced panicle length and a dwarf phenotype |  In addition, Oshox14 overexpression lines showed a deficiency in panicle exsertion	 Overexpression of Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice resulted in reduced panicle length and a dwarf phenotype |  In addition, Oshox14 overexpression lines showed a deficiency in panicle exsertion
