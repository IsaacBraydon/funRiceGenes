Oshox14	transcription factor	Functional analysis of the HD-Zip transcription factor genes Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice.	Functional analysis of the HD-Zip transcription factor genes Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice.
Oshox14	panicle	Functional analysis of the HD-Zip transcription factor genes Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice.	 Overexpression of Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice resulted in reduced panicle length and a dwarf phenotype
Oshox14	panicle	Functional analysis of the HD-Zip transcription factor genes Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice.	 In addition, Oshox14 overexpression lines showed a deficiency in panicle exsertion
Oshox14	panicle	Functional analysis of the HD-Zip transcription factor genes Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice.	 Our findings suggest that Oshox12 and Oshox14 may be involved in the regulation of panicle development
Oshox14	development	Functional analysis of the HD-Zip transcription factor genes Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice.	 Our findings suggest that Oshox12 and Oshox14 may be involved in the regulation of panicle development
Oshox14	dwarf	Functional analysis of the HD-Zip transcription factor genes Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice.	 Overexpression of Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice resulted in reduced panicle length and a dwarf phenotype
