Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis is essential for plants to manage responses under environmental stress. Plant immune activation requires the ER, but how ER homeostasis is associated with plant immune activation is largely unexplored. Here we find that transcription of an HVA22 family gene, OsHLP1 (HVA22-like protein 1), is induced by Magnaporthe oryzae infection. Overexpression of OsHLP1 significantly enhances blast disease resistance but impairs ER morphology in rice (Oryza sativa), resulting in enhanced sensitivity to ER stress. OsHLP1 interacts with the NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) transcription factor OsNTL6 at the ER. OsNTL6 localizes to the ER and is relocated to the nucleus after cleavage of the transmembrane domain. OsHLP1 suppresses OsNTL6 protein accumulation, whereas OsNTL6 counteracts OsHLP1 by alleviating sensitivity to ER stress and decreasing disease resistance in OsHLP1 overexpression plants. These findings unravel a mechanism whereby OsHLP1 promotes disease resistance by compromising ER homeostasis when plants are infected by pathogens.
