Symbol	Expression	Overexpression
OsHLP1	 Overexpression of OsHLP1 significantly enhances blast disease resistance but impairs ER morphology in rice (Oryza sativa), resulting in enhanced sensitivity to ER stress |  OsHLP1 suppresses OsNTL6 protein accumulation, whereas OsNTL6 counteracts OsHLP1 by alleviating sensitivity to ER stress and decreasing disease resistance in OsHLP1 overexpression plants	 Overexpression of OsHLP1 significantly enhances blast disease resistance but impairs ER morphology in rice (Oryza sativa), resulting in enhanced sensitivity to ER stress |  OsHLP1 suppresses OsNTL6 protein accumulation, whereas OsNTL6 counteracts OsHLP1 by alleviating sensitivity to ER stress and decreasing disease resistance in OsHLP1 overexpression plants
