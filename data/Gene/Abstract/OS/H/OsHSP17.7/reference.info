To try to determine the mechanisms of acquisition of tolerance to drought stress by heat shock, the rice small heat-shock protein gene, sHSP17.7, the product of which was shown to act as molecular chaperones in vitro and in vivo in our previous study, was overexpressed in the rice cultivar "Hoshinoyume". Western and Northern blot analyses showed higher expression levels of sHSP17.7 protein in three transgenic lines than in one transgenic line. Drought tolerance was assessed in these transgenic lines and wild-type plants by withholding water for 6 days for evaluation of the ability of plants to continue growth after water-stress treatments. Although no significant difference was found in water potential of seedlings between transgenic lines and wild-type plants at the end of drought treatments, only transgenic seedlings with higher expression levels of sHSP17.7 protein could regrow after rewatering. Similar results were observed in survival rates after treatments with 30% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3640 for 3 days. These results suggest that overproduction of sHSP17.7 could increase drought tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings.

UV-B resistance was enhanced in parallel with the period of heat treatment. sHSP17.7 was isolated from heated rice seedlings, and the influence of rice sHSP17.7 expression on the viability of E. coli under heat-shock conditions was assessed. After heating, the survival rate of sHSP17.7 cells was 2-fold higher than that of the control cells. The molecular chaperone activity of sHSP17.7 was investigated using catalase as a substrate. Recombinant sHSP17.7 had heat-stable chaperone properties that were capable of protecting stressed catalase from precipitation. sHSP17.7 was overexpressed in the rice cultivar 'Hoshinoyume', by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, under the control of a CaMV 35S promoter. Transgenic rice plants with increased levels of sHSP17.7 protein exhibited significantly increased thermotolerance compared to untransformed control plants. The level of increased thermotolerance was correlated with the level of increased sHSP17.7 protein in the transgenic plants. The transgenic rice plant with the highest constitutive expression of sHSP17.7 had significantly greater resistance to UV-B stress than untransformed control plants. Increase in the degree of resistance of transgenic plants to UV-B was accompanied by an increase in production of sHSP17.7 protein.
