BACKGROUND: It is well known that salt stress has different effects on old and young tissues. However, it remains largely unexplored whether old and young tissues have different regulatory mechanism during adaptation of plants to salt stress. The aim of this study was to investigate whether salt stress has different effects on the ion balance and nitrogen metabolism in the old and young leaves of rice, and to compare functions of both organs in rice salt tolerance. RESULTS: Rice protected young leaves from ion harm via the large accumulation of Na+ and Cl- in old leaves. The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 might contribute to accumulation of Na+ in old leaves under salt stress. In addition, lower expression of OsHKT1;5 and OsSOS1 in old leaves may decrease frequency of retrieving Na+ from old leaf cells. Under salt stress, old leaves showed higher concentration of NO3- content than young leaves. Up-regulation of OsNRT1;2, a gene coding nitrate transporter, might contribute to the accumulation of NO3- in the old leaves of salt stressed-rice. Salt stress clearly up-regulated the expression of OsGDH2 and OsGDH3 in old leaves, while strongly down-regulated expression of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves. CONCLUSIONS: The down-regulation of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves might be a harmful response to excesses of Na+ and Cl-. Under salt stress, rice might accumulate Na+ and Cl- to toxic levels in old leaves. This might influence photorespiration process, reduce NH4+ production from photorespiration, and immediately down-regulate the expression of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves of salt stressed rice. Excesses of Na+ and Cl- also might change the pathway of NH4+ assimilation in old leaves of salt stressed rice plants, weaken GOGAT/GS pathway and elevate GDH pathway.

Plants take up large amounts of K(+) from the soil solution and distribute it to the cells of all organs, where it fulfills important physiological functions. Transport of K(+) from the soil solution to its final destination is mediated by channels and transporters. To better understand K(+) movements in plants, we intended to characterize the function of the large KT-HAK-KUP family of transporters in rice (Oryza sativa cv Nipponbare). By searching in databases and cDNA cloning, we have identified 17 genes (OsHAK1-17) encoding transporters of this family and obtained evidence of the existence of other two genes. Phylogenetic analysis of the encoded transporters reveals a great diversity among them, and three distant transporters, OsHAK1, OsHAK7, and OsHAK10, were expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and bacterial mutants to determine their functions. The three transporters mediate K(+) influxes or effluxes, depending on the conditions of the experiment. A comparative kinetic analysis of HAK-mediated K(+) influx in yeast and in roots of K(+)-starved rice seedlings demonstrated the involvement of HAK transporters in root K(+) uptake. We discuss that all HAK transporters may mediate K(+) transport, but probably not only in the plasma membrane. Transient expression of the OsHAK10-green fluorescent protein fusion protein in living onion epidermal cells targeted this protein to the tonoplast.
NA	Rice OsHAK16 functions in potassium uptake and translocation in shoot, maintaining potassium homeostasis and salt tolerance.	2019	Planta	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	OsHAK16 mediates K uptake and root-to-shoot translocation in a broad range of external K concentrations, thereby contributing to the maintenance of K homeostasis and salt tolerance in the rice shoot. The HAK/KUP/KT transporters have been widely associated with potassium (K) transport across membranes in both microbes and plants. Here, we report the physiological function of OsHAK16, a member belonging to the HAK/KUP/KT family in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Transcriptional expression of OsHAK16 was up-regulated by K deficiency or salt stress. OsHAK16 is localized at the plasma membrane. OsHAK16 knockout (KO) dramatically reduced root K net uptake rate and growth at both 0.1 mM and 1 mM K supplies, while OsHAK16 overexpression (OX) increased total K uptake and growth only at 0.1 mM K level. OsHAK16-KO decreased the rate of rubidium (Rb) uptake and translocation compared to WT at both 0.2 mM and 1 mM Rb levels. OsHAK16 disruption decreased while its overexpression increased K concentration in root slightly but in shoot remarkably. The relative distribution of total K between shoot and root decreased by 30% in OsHAK16-KO lines and increased by 30% in its OX lines compared to WT. OsHAK16-KO diminished K uptake and K/Na ratio, while OsHAK16-OX improved K uptake and translocation from root to shoot, resulting in increased sensitivity and tolerance to salt stress, respectively. Expression of OsHAK16 enhanced the growth of high salt-sensitive yeast mutant by increasing its K but no Na content. Taking all these together, we conclude that OsHAK16 plays crucial roles in maintaining K homeostasis and salt tolerance in rice shoot.
