OsHAK16	 Transcriptional expression of OsHAK16 was up-regulated by K deficiency or salt stress | 1 mM and 1 mM K supplies, while OsHAK16 overexpression (OX) increased total K uptake and growth only at 0 |  OsHAK16 disruption decreased while its overexpression increased K concentration in root slightly but in shoot remarkably |  Expression of OsHAK16 enhanced the growth of high salt-sensitive yeast mutant by increasing its K but no Na content	1 mM and 1 mM K supplies, while OsHAK16 overexpression (OX) increased total K uptake and growth only at 0 |  OsHAK16 disruption decreased while its overexpression increased K concentration in root slightly but in shoot remarkably
