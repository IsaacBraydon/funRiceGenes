OsHAP5C	 DHD1 and OsHAP5C/D located in the nucleus and showed that rhythmic expression |  Both DHD1 and OsHAP5C/D affect heading date by regulating expression of Ehd1 |  We propose that DHD1 interacts with OsHAP5C/D to delay heading date by inhibiting expression of Ehd1
OsHAP5C	 The triple complex of Ghd8-OsHAP5C-Ghd7 directly bound to the promotor of Hd3a and downregulated the expression of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1, and finally resulted in a delayed heading
