NA	DELAYED HEADING DATE1 interacts with OsHAP5C/D, delays flowering time and enhances yield in rice.	2018	Plant Biotechnol J	National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, P. R. China.	Heading date is an important agronomic trait affecting crop yield. The GRAS protein family is a plant-specific super family extensively involved in plant growth and signal transduction. However, GRAS proteins are rarely reported have a role in regulating rice heading date. Here, we report a GRAS protein DHD1 (Delayed Heading Date1) delays heading and enhances yield in rice. Biochemical assays showed DHD1 physically interacts with OsHAP5C/D both in vitro and in vivo. DHD1 and OsHAP5C/D located in the nucleus and showed that rhythmic expression. Both DHD1 and OsHAP5C/D affect heading date by regulating expression of Ehd1. We propose that DHD1 interacts with OsHAP5C/D to delay heading date by inhibiting expression of Ehd1.

NA	The amino acid residue E96 orf Ghd8 is crucial for the formation of the flowering repression complex Ghd7-Ghd8-OsHAP5C in rice.	2022	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Hongshan Laboratory, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Ghd7 is an important gene involving in photoperiod flowering pathway in rice. A Ghd7 involved transcriptional regulatory network has been established, but its translational regulatory pathway is poorly understood. The mutant suppressor of overexpression of Ghd7 (sog7) was identified from an EMS induced mutagenesis in the background ZH11 overexpressing Ghd7. MutMap analysis revealed that SOG7 is allelic to Ghd8 and delayed flowering under long-day (LD) conditions. Biochemical assays showed that Ghd8 interacts with OsHAP5C and Ghd7 both in vivo and in vitro. Surprisingly, a point mutation E96K in α2 helix of Ghd8 HFD domain destroyed its ability interacting with Ghd7. The prediction of the structure shows that mutated amino acid is located in the interaction region of CCT/NF-YB/YC complexes, which alter the structure of α4 of Ghd8. This structural difference prevents the formation of complex NF-YB/YC. The triple complex of Ghd8-OsHAP5C-Ghd7 directly bound to the promotor of Hd3a and downregulated the expression of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1, and finally resulted in a delayed heading. These findings are helpful to deeply understand the Ghd7 involved photoperiod flowering pathway and promote the elucidation of rice heading. This article is protected by copyright.
