Ghd7	OsHAP5C	The amino acid residue E96 orf Ghd8 is crucial for the formation of the flowering repression complex Ghd7-Ghd8-OsHAP5C in rice.	 Biochemical assays showed that Ghd8 interacts with OsHAP5C and Ghd7 both in vivo and in vitro
OsGMT1	OsHAP5C	Overexpression of a GIPC glycosyltransferase gene, OsGMT1, suppresses plant immunity and delays heading time in rice.	 In addition, yeast two-hybrid screens using OsGMT1 as bait revealed that OsGMT1 may regulate heading time through the OsHAP5C signaling pathway
