NA	Histone H2B Monoubiquitination Mediated by OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 Is Involved in Anther Development by Regulating Tapetum Degradation Related Genes in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences;	Histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1) is an important regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic gene transcription and is essential for normal plant development. However, the function of H2Bub1 in reproductive development remains elusive. Here, we report OsHUB1 (Oryza sativa HISTONE MONO-UBIQUITINATION1) and OsHUB2, the homologues of Arabidopsis HUB1 and HUB2 proteins which function as E3 ligases in H2Bub1, are involved in late anther development in rice. oshub mutants exhibit abnormal tapetum development and aborted pollen in postmeiotic anthers. Knock-out of OsHUB1 or OsHUB2 results in the loss of H2Bub1, and a reduction in the levels of dimethylated lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me2). Anther transcriptome analysis revealed that several key tapetum degradation-related genes including OsC4, OsCP1 and UDT1 were down-regulated in the mutants. Further, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that H2Bub1 directly targets OsC4, OsCP1 and UDT1 genes and enrichment of H2Bub1 and H3K4me2 in the targets is consistent to some degree. Our studies suggest that histone H2B monoubiquitination, mediated by OsHUB1 and OsHUB2, is an important epigenetic modification that in concert with H3K4me2 modulates transcriptional regulation of anther development in rice.
NA	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	a Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Crop Germplasm Innovation and Utilization ; Hunan Agricultural University ; Changsha Hunan , China.	Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation is involved in various cellular processes including plant-microbe interactions and defense responses. Although there are many E3 ubiquitin ligases in rice, the functions of their targets in defense responses are unclear. We recently found that SPIN6 (SPL11-interacting Protein 6) is a Rho GTPase-activating protein and acts as the target of the E3 ligase SPL11, a negative regulator of plant cell death and innate immunity. Our results showed that that SPIN6 serves as a link between the SPL11-mediated ubiquitination pathway and the OsRac1-associated defense system. Here, we show that SPIN6 interacts with OsHUB1 and OsHUB2, the homologous proteins of Arabidopsis RING finger E3 ligases HUB1 and HUB2. OsHub1 and OsHub2 are down-regulated in the Spin6 RNAi plants and during the compatible interaction between rice and Magnaporthe oryzae. OsHub1 and OsHub2 are induced by hormone treatments. Like HUB1 and HUB2 in Arabidopsis, OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 in rice form homo- and hetero-dimers. Our results suggest that OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 may be associated with the SPIN6/OsRac1 pathway in rice immunity.
NA	Flowering-Related RING Protein 1 (FRRP1) Regulates Flowering Time and Yield Potential by Affecting Histone H2B Monoubiquitination in Rice (Oryza Sativa).	2016	PLoS One	State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.	Flowering time is a critical trait for crops cultivated under various temperature/photoperiod conditions around the world. To understand better the flowering time of rice, we used the vector pTCK303 to produce several lines of RNAi knockdown transgenic rice and investigated their flowering times and other agronomic traits. Among them, the heading date of FRRP1-RNAi knockdown transgenic rice was 23-26 days earlier than that of wild-type plants. FRRP1 is a novel rice gene that encodes a C3HC4-type Really Interesting Novel Gene (RING) finger domain protein. In addition to the early flowering time, FRRP1-RNAi knockdown transgenic rice caused changes on an array of agronomic traits, including plant height, panicle length and grain length. We analyzed the expression of some key genes associated with the flowering time and other agronomic traits in the FRRP1-RNAi knockdown lines and compared with that in wild-type lines. The expression of Hd3a increased significantly, which was the key factor in the early flowering time. Further experiments showed that the level of histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1) was noticeably reduced in the FRRP1-RNAi knockdown transgenic rice lines compared with wild-type plants and MBP-FRRP1-F1 was capable of self-ubiquitination. The results indicate that Flowering Related RING Protein 1 (FRRP1) is involved in histone H2B monoubiquitination and suggest that FRRP1 functions as an E3 ligase in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, FRRP1 probably regulates flowering time and yield potential in rice by affecting histone H2B monoubiquitination, which leads to changes in gene expression in multiple processes.
NA	OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.	2022	Plant J	Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Membraneless Organelles and Cellular Dynamics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, School of Life Sciences, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Anhui, 230027, China.	Heading date is one of the most pivotal agronomic traits for rice (Oryza sativa) yield and adaptation. Little is known about the crosstalk between histone ubiquitination and histone methylation in rice heading date regulation. Here, we reported HISTONE MONOUBIQUITINATION 1 (OsHUB1) and OsHUB2 are involved in heading date regulation via the Hd1 and Ehd1 pathway. Loss of OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 function resulted in early heading under long-day and short-day photoperiods. The expression of Hd3a, RFT1, and Ehd1 was induced and the transcript levels of Hd1, Ghd7, OsCCA1, OsGI, OsFKF1, and OsTOC1 were reduced under long-day conditions, whereas RFT1 and Ehd1 expression was induced in oshub2 mutants under short-day conditions. OsHUB2 interacted with OsTrx1 and repressed the gene expression of OsTrx1. OsHUB2 directly bound to Ehd1 to ubiquitinate H2B at Ehd1, and H2B ubiquitination levels were reduced in oshub2-2 and oshub2-3 mutants. OsTrx1 were highly enriched at Ehd1, and H3K4me3 levels of Ehd1 were upregulated in oshub2-2. Mutations of OsTrx1 in the oshub2-2 background rescued the early-heading phenotype of oshub2-2. The increases in Ehd1 H3K4me3 levels and transcript levels in oshub2-2 mutants were attenuated in oshub2-2 ostrx1-2 double mutants. Together, our results (i) reveal that OsHUB2 represses the function of OsTrx1 and H3K4me3 levels at Ehd1 and (ii) suggest that OsHUB2-mediated H2B ubiquitination plays critical roles together with H3K4me3 in rice heading date regulation.
