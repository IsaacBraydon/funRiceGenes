NA	Histone H2B Monoubiquitination Mediated by OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 Is Involved in Anther Development by Regulating Tapetum Degradation Related Genes in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences;	Histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1) is an important regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic gene transcription and is essential for normal plant development. However, the function of H2Bub1 in reproductive development remains elusive. Here, we report OsHUB1 (Oryza sativa HISTONE MONO-UBIQUITINATION1) and OsHUB2, the homologues of Arabidopsis HUB1 and HUB2 proteins which function as E3 ligases in H2Bub1, are involved in late anther development in rice. oshub mutants exhibit abnormal tapetum development and aborted pollen in postmeiotic anthers. Knock-out of OsHUB1 or OsHUB2 results in the loss of H2Bub1, and a reduction in the levels of dimethylated lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me2). Anther transcriptome analysis revealed that several key tapetum degradation-related genes including OsC4, OsCP1 and UDT1 were down-regulated in the mutants. Further, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that H2Bub1 directly targets OsC4, OsCP1 and UDT1 genes and enrichment of H2Bub1 and H3K4me2 in the targets is consistent to some degree. Our studies suggest that histone H2B monoubiquitination, mediated by OsHUB1 and OsHUB2, is an important epigenetic modification that in concert with H3K4me2 modulates transcriptional regulation of anther development in rice.
NA	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	a Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Crop Germplasm Innovation and Utilization ; Hunan Agricultural University ; Changsha Hunan , China.	Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation is involved in various cellular processes including plant-microbe interactions and defense responses. Although there are many E3 ubiquitin ligases in rice, the functions of their targets in defense responses are unclear. We recently found that SPIN6 (SPL11-interacting Protein 6) is a Rho GTPase-activating protein and acts as the target of the E3 ligase SPL11, a negative regulator of plant cell death and innate immunity. Our results showed that that SPIN6 serves as a link between the SPL11-mediated ubiquitination pathway and the OsRac1-associated defense system. Here, we show that SPIN6 interacts with OsHUB1 and OsHUB2, the homologous proteins of Arabidopsis RING finger E3 ligases HUB1 and HUB2. OsHub1 and OsHub2 are down-regulated in the Spin6 RNAi plants and during the compatible interaction between rice and Magnaporthe oryzae. OsHub1 and OsHub2 are induced by hormone treatments. Like HUB1 and HUB2 in Arabidopsis, OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 in rice form homo- and hetero-dimers. Our results suggest that OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 may be associated with the SPIN6/OsRac1 pathway in rice immunity.
