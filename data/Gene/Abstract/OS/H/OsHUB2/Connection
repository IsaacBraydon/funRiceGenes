OsHUB1|MIP1	OsHUB2	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.
OsHUB1|MIP1	OsHUB2	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	 Here, we show that SPIN6 interacts with OsHUB1 and OsHUB2, the homologous proteins of Arabidopsis RING finger E3 ligases HUB1 and HUB2
OsHUB1|MIP1	OsHUB2	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	 OsHub1 and OsHub2 are down-regulated in the Spin6 RNAi plants and during the compatible interaction between rice and Magnaporthe oryzae
OsHUB1|MIP1	OsHUB2	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	 OsHub1 and OsHub2 are induced by hormone treatments
OsHUB1|MIP1	OsHUB2	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	 Like HUB1 and HUB2 in Arabidopsis, OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 in rice form homo- and hetero-dimers
OsHUB1|MIP1	OsHUB2	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	 Our results suggest that OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 may be associated with the SPIN6/OsRac1 pathway in rice immunity
OsHUB2	SPIN6	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.
OsHUB2	SPIN6	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	 Here, we show that SPIN6 interacts with OsHUB1 and OsHUB2, the homologous proteins of Arabidopsis RING finger E3 ligases HUB1 and HUB2
