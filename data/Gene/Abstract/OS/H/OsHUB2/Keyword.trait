OsHUB2|FRRP1	magnaporthe oryzae	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	OsHub1 and OsHub2 are down-regulated in the Spin6 RNAi plants and during the compatible interaction between rice and Magnaporthe oryzae
OsHUB2|FRRP1	immunity	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	Our results suggest that OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 may be associated with the SPIN6/OsRac1 pathway in rice immunity
OsHUB2|FRRP1	yield	Flowering-Related RING Protein 1 (FRRP1) Regulates Flowering Time and Yield Potential by Affecting Histone H2B Monoubiquitination in Rice (Oryza Sativa).	In conclusion, FRRP1 probably regulates flowering time and yield potential in rice by affecting histone H2B monoubiquitination, which leads to changes in gene expression in multiple processes
