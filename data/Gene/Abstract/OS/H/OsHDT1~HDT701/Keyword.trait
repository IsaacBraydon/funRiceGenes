OsHDT1|HDT701	flowering time	Altered levels of histone deacetylase OsHDT1 affect differential gene expression patterns in hybrid rice	 These data demonstrate that nonadditive gene expression was involved in flowering time control in the hybrid rice and that OsHDT1 level was important for nonadditive or differential expression of many genes including the flowering time genes, suggesting that OsHDT1 may be involved in epigenetic control of parental genome interaction for differential gene expression
OsHDT1|HDT701	defense	"HDT701, a histone H4 deacetylase, negatively regulates plant innate immunity by modulating histone H4 acetylation of defense-related genes in rice"	" By contrast, silencing of HDT701 in transgenic rice causes elevated levels of histone H4 acetylation and elevated transcription of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and defense-related genes, increased generation of reactive oxygen species after pathogen-associated molecular pattern elicitor treatment, as well as enhanced resistance to both M| We also found that HDT701 can bind to defense-related genes to regulate their expression| Taken together, these results demonstrate that HDT701 negatively regulates innate immunity by modulating the levels of histone H4 acetylation of PRR and defense-related genes in rice|HDT701, a histone H4 deacetylase, negatively regulates plant innate immunity by modulating histone H4 acetylation of defense-related genes in rice"
OsHDT1|HDT701	growth	Altered levels of histone deacetylase OsHDT1 affect differential gene expression patterns in hybrid rice	 Increased OsHDT1 expression did not affect plant growth in the parent but led to early flowering in the hybrid
OsHDT1|HDT701	flower	Altered levels of histone deacetylase OsHDT1 affect differential gene expression patterns in hybrid rice	 Increased OsHDT1 expression did not affect plant growth in the parent but led to early flowering in the hybrid| Over-expression of OsHDT1 repressed the nonadditive expression of the key flowering repressors in the hybrid (i| These data demonstrate that nonadditive gene expression was involved in flowering time control in the hybrid rice and that OsHDT1 level was important for nonadditive or differential expression of many genes including the flowering time genes, suggesting that OsHDT1 may be involved in epigenetic control of parental genome interaction for differential gene expression
OsHDT1|HDT701	magnaporthe oryzae	HDT701, a histone H4 deacetylase, negatively regulates plant innate immunity by modulating histone H4 acetylation of defense-related genes in rice	 Transcription of HDT701 is increased in the compatible reaction and decreased in the incompatible reaction after infection by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae
