OsHDT1|HDT701	Expression and functional analysis of the plant-specific histone deacetylase HDT701 in rice. |  In this work, we examined the subcellular localization, expression pattern and function of HDT701, a member of the plant-specific HD2-type histone deacetylase in rice |  Overexpression of HDT701 in rice decreases ABA, salt and osmotic stress resistance during seed germination |  Delayed seed germination of HDT701 overexpression lines is associated with decreased histone H4 acetylation and down-regulated expression of GA biosynthetic genes |  Moreover, overexpression of HDT701 in rice enhances salt and osmotic stress resistance during the seedling stage	 Overexpression of HDT701 in rice decreases ABA, salt and osmotic stress resistance during seed germination |  Delayed seed germination of HDT701 overexpression lines is associated with decreased histone H4 acetylation and down-regulated expression of GA biosynthetic genes |  Moreover, overexpression of HDT701 in rice enhances salt and osmotic stress resistance during the seedling stage
OsHDT1|HDT701	Histone Deacetylase 701 (HDT701) Induces Flowering in Rice by Modulating Expression of OsIDS1. |  Overexpression of Histone<U+00A0>Deacetylase 701 (HDT701) accelerates flowering in hybrid rice |  Expression levels of florigens Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and Rice Flowering Locus<U+00A0>T1 (RFT1), and their immediate upstream floral activator Early<U+00A0>heading date 1 (Ehd1), were significantly decreased in the<U+00A0>hdt701 mutants, indicating that HDT701 functions upstream of Ehd1 in controlling flowering time	 Overexpression of Histone<U+00A0>Deacetylase 701 (HDT701) accelerates flowering in hybrid rice
