Ehd1	OsHDT1|HDT701	Histone Deacetylase 701 (HDT701) Induces Flowering in Rice by Modulating Expression of OsIDS1.	 Expression levels of florigens Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and Rice Flowering Locus<U+00A0>T1 (RFT1), and their immediate upstream floral activator Early<U+00A0>heading date 1 (Ehd1), were significantly decreased in the<U+00A0>hdt701 mutants, indicating that HDT701 functions upstream of Ehd1 in controlling flowering time

Expression levels of florigens Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and Rice Flowering Locus<U+00A0>T1 (RFT1), and their immediate upstream floral activator Early<U+00A0>heading date 1 (Ehd1), were significantly decreased in the<U+00A0>hdt701 mutants, indicating that HDT701 functions upstream of Ehd1 in controlling flowering time
OsHDT1|HDT701	OsIDS1	Histone Deacetylase 701 (HDT701) Induces Flowering in Rice by Modulating Expression of OsIDS1.	Histone Deacetylase 701 (HDT701) Induces Flowering in Rice by Modulating Expression of OsIDS1.
OsHDT1|HDT701	OsIDS1	Histone Deacetylase 701 (HDT701) Induces Flowering in Rice by Modulating Expression of OsIDS1.	 Chromatinimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that HDT701 directly binds to the promoter region of OsIDS1
OsHDT1|HDT701	OsIDS1	Histone Deacetylase 701 (HDT701) Induces Flowering in Rice by Modulating Expression of OsIDS1.	 These results suggest that HDT701 induces flowering by suppressing OsIDS1
