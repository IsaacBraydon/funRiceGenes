OsHSFA2d|OsHSF7|HTG3	OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	A MITE variation-associated heat-inducible isoform of a heat-shock factor confers heat tolerance through regulation of JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN genes in rice	Two heat-responsive JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) genes were confirmed to be directly upregulated by HTG3a, and one of them, OsJAZ9, positively regulates HT.
OsbZIP14	OsHSFA2d|OsHSF7|HTG3	Integrated ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq Data Analysis to Reveal OsbZIP14 Function in Rice in Response to Heat Stress.	 This study identified three TF genes, including OsbZIP14, OsMYB2, and OsHSF7, by integrating transcriptomic and epigenetic sequencing data analysis of rice in response to heat stress
