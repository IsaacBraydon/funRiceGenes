Three novel Class A genes that encode heat shock transcription factor (HSF) were cloned from Oryza Sativa L using a yeast hybrid method. The OsHSF7 gene was found to be rapidly expressed in high levels in response to temperature, which indicates that it may be involved in heat stress reception and response. Over-expression of OsHSF7 in transgenic Arabidopsis could not induced over the expression of most target heat stress-inducible genes of HSFs; however, the transcription of some HSF target genes was more abundant in transgenic plants following two hours of heat stress treatment. In addition, those transgenic plants also had a higher basal thermotolerance, but not acquired thermotolerance. Collectively, the results of this study indicate that OsHSF7 might play an important role in the response to high temperature. Specifically, these findings indicate that OsHSF7 may be useful in the production of transgenic monocots that can over-express protective genes such as HSPs in response to heat stress, which will enable such plants to tolerate high temperatures.

NA	An alternatively spliced heat shock transcription factor, OsHSFA2dI, functions in the heat stress-induced unfolded protein response in rice.	2014	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Engineering Research Center for Plant Biotechnology and Germplasm Utilization, Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.	As sessile organisms, plants have evolved a wide range of defence pathways to cope with environmental stress such as heat shock. However, the molecular mechanism of these defence pathways remains unclear in rice. In this study, we found that OsHSFA2d, a heat shock transcriptional factor, encodes two main splice variant proteins, OsHSFA2dI and OsHSFA2dII in rice. Under normal conditions, OsHSFA2dII is the dominant but transcriptionally inactive spliced form. However, when the plant suffers heat stress, OsHSFA2d is alternatively spliced into a transcriptionally active form, OsHSFA2dI, which participates in the heat stress response (HSR). Further study found that this alternative splicing was induced by heat shock rather than photoperiod. We found that OsHSFA2dI is localised to the nucleus, whereas OsHSFA2dII is localised to the nucleus and cytoplasm. Moreover, expression of the unfolded protein response (UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE) sensors, OsIRE1, OsbZIP39/OsbZIP60 and the UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE marker OsBiP1, was up-regulated. Interestingly, OsbZIP50 was also alternatively spliced under heat stress, indicating that UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE signalling pathways were activated by heat stress to re-establish cellular protein homeostasis. We further demonstrated that OsHSFA2dI participated in the unfolded protein response by regulating expression of OsBiP1. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
NA	A Core Regulatory Pathway Controlling Rice Tiller Angle Mediated by the LAZY1-dependent Asymmetric Distribution of Auxin.	2018	Plant Cell	Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology,Chinese Academy of Sciences CITY: Beijing POSTAL_CODE: 100101 China [CN].	Tiller angle in cereals is a key shoot architecture trait that strongly influences grain yield. Studies in rice (Oryza sativa L.) have implicated shoot gravitropism in the regulation of tiller angle. However, the functional link between shoot gravitropism and tiller angle is unknown. Here, we conducted a large-scale transcriptome analysis of rice shoots in response to gravistimulation and identified two new nodes of a shoot gravitropism regulatory gene network that also controls rice tiller angle. We demonstrate that HEAT STRESS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2D (HSFA2D) is an upstream positive regulator of the LAZY1-mediated asymmetric auxin distribution pathway. We also show that two functionally redundant transcription factor genes, WUSCHEL RELATED HOMEOBOX6 (WOX6) and WOX11, are expressed asymmetrically in response to auxin to connect gravitropism responses with the control of rice tiller angle. These findings define upstream and downstream genetic components that link shoot gravitropism, asymmetric auxin distribution, and rice tiller angle. The results highlight the power of the high-temporal-resolution RNA-seq dataset, and its use to explore further genetic components controlling tiller angle. Collectively these approaches will identify genes to improve grain yields by facilitating the optimization of plant architecture.
