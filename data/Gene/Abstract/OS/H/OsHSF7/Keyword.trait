OsHSFA2d|OsHSF7|HTG3	transcription factor	OsHSF7 gene in rice, Oryza sativa L., encodes a transcription factor that functions as a high temperature receptive and responsive factor	OsHSF7 gene in rice, Oryza sativa L., encodes a transcription factor that functions as a high temperature receptive and responsive factor
OsHSFA2d|OsHSF7|HTG3	temperature	OsHSF7 gene in rice, Oryza sativa L., encodes a transcription factor that functions as a high temperature receptive and responsive factor	The OsHSF7 gene was found to be rapidly expressed in high levels in response to temperature, which indicates that it may be involved in heat stress reception and response
OsHSFA2d|OsHSF7|HTG3	temperature	OsHSF7 gene in rice, Oryza sativa L., encodes a transcription factor that functions as a high temperature receptive and responsive factor	Collectively, the results of this study indicate that OsHSF7 might play an important role in the response to high temperature
OsHSFA2d|OsHSF7|HTG3	temperature	OsHSF7 gene in rice, Oryza sativa L., encodes a transcription factor that functions as a high temperature receptive and responsive factor	Specifically, these findings indicate that OsHSF7 may be useful in the production of transgenic monocots that can over-express protective genes such as HSPs in response to heat stress, which will enable such plants to tolerate high temperatures
OsHSFA2d|OsHSF7|HTG3	temperature	OsHSF7 gene in rice, Oryza sativa L., encodes a transcription factor that functions as a high temperature receptive and responsive factor	OsHSF7 gene in rice, Oryza sativa L., encodes a transcription factor that functions as a high temperature receptive and responsive factor
OsHSFA2d|OsHSF7|HTG3	stress	An alternatively spliced heat shock transcription factor, OsHSFA2dI, functions in the heat stress-induced unfolded protein response in rice.	However, when the plant suffers heat stress, OsHSFA2d is alternatively spliced into a transcriptionally active form, OsHSFA2dI, which participates in the heat stress response (HSR)
OsHSFA2d|OsHSF7|HTG3	tolerance	A MITE variation-associated heat-inducible isoform of a heat-shock factor confers heat tolerance through regulation of JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN genes in rice.	 A miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) in the promoter of a candidate gene, HTG3 (heat-tolerance gene on chromosome 3), was found to be significantly associated with heat-induced expression of HTG3 and heat tolerance (HT)
