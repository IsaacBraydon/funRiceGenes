Osh69	salicylic acid	A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence	 The expression level of Osh69 is not only up-regulated during natural leaf senescence but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones (methyl jasmonic acid, salicylic acid), and stresses (H2O2 and wounding)
Osh69	senescence	A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence	 The expression level of Osh69 is not only up-regulated during natural leaf senescence but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones (methyl jasmonic acid, salicylic acid), and stresses (H2O2 and wounding)| These findings strongly suggest an important role for Osh69 in the degradation of chloroplast galactolipids during leaf senescence
Osh69	chloroplast	A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence	 Immunoelectron microscopic analysis demonstrates that Osh69 is specifically localized in the chloroplasts of senescing leaves| These findings strongly suggest an important role for Osh69 in the degradation of chloroplast galactolipids during leaf senescence
Osh69	jasmonic	A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence	 The expression level of Osh69 is not only up-regulated during natural leaf senescence but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones (methyl jasmonic acid, salicylic acid), and stresses (H2O2 and wounding)
Osh69	leaf	A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence	 The expression level of Osh69 is not only up-regulated during natural leaf senescence but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones (methyl jasmonic acid, salicylic acid), and stresses (H2O2 and wounding)| These findings strongly suggest an important role for Osh69 in the degradation of chloroplast galactolipids during leaf senescence
