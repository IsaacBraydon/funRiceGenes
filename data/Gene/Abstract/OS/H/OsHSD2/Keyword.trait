OsHSD2	grain	OsHSD2 interaction with and phosphorylation by OsCPK21 is essential for lipid metabolism during rice caryopsis development.	 Furthermore, oscpk21 and oshsd2 mutants were generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, and we found that the lipid profiles were drastically changed in both oscpk21 and oshsd2, implying that OsHSD2 phosphorylated by OsCPK21 regulates lipid abundance in caryopsis development, thereby providing a potential target for the genetic improvement of rice grain quality in future lipid-related breeding and biotechnology applications
