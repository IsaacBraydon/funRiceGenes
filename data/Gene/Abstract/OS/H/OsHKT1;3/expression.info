OsHKT1;3	 Here it is demonstrated at the cellular level that rice cornichon OsCNIH1 interacts with OsHKT1;3 and, in yeast cells, enables the expression of the sodium transporter to the Golgi apparatus
OsHKT1;3	 Expression levels of OsHKT1;3_FL, and some variants, increased after 24 h of salt stress |  Two electrode voltage clamp experiments in a heterologous expression system using Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that oocytes expressing OsHKT1;3_FL and all of its variants exhibited smaller Na(+) currents
