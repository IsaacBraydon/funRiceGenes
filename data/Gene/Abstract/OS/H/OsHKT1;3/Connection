OsCNIH1	OsHKT1;3	Identification of rice cornichon as a possible cargo receptor for the Golgi-localized sodium transporter OsHKT1;3.	Here it is demonstrated at the cellular level that rice cornichon OsCNIH1 interacts with OsHKT1;3 and, in yeast cells, enables the expression of the sodium transporter to the Golgi apparatus
OsCNIH1	OsHKT1;3	Identification of rice cornichon as a possible cargo receptor for the Golgi-localized sodium transporter OsHKT1;3.	In the yeast cornichon mutant erv14, OsHKT1;3 is mistargeted, preventing the toxic effects of sodium transport in the cell observed in wild-type cells or in the erv14 mutant that co-expressed OsHKT1;3 with either OsCNIH1 or Erv14p
OsHKT1;3	OsJRL	OsJRL, a rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin gene, enhances Escherichia coli viability under high-salinity stress and improves salinity tolerance of rice.	Overexpression of OsJRL in rice also enhanced salinity tolerance and increased the expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including three LEA (late embryogenesis abundant proteins) genes (OsLEA19a, OsLEA23 and OsLEA24), three Na(+) transporter genes (OsHKT1;3, OsHKT1;4 and OsHKT1;5) and two DREB genes (OsDREB1A and OsDREB2B)
OsbHLH035	OsHKT1;3	The transcription factor OsbHLH035 mediates seed germination and enables seedling recovery from salt stress through ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways, respectively.	 Additionally, the expression of the sodium transporters OsHKT1;3 and 1;5 is reduced in Osbhlh035 aerial and terrestrial tissues, respectively
