OsHAD3	Overexpression of OsHAD3, a Member of HAD Superfamily, Decreases Drought Tolerance of Rice. |  Under drought stress, overexpression of OsHAD3 increases the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde than wild type |  OsHAD3-overexpression lines decreased but antisense-expression lines increased the roots length under drought stress and the transcription levels of many well-known stress-related genes were also changed in plants with different genotypes |  Furthermore, overexpression of OsHAD3 also decreases the oxidative tolerance |  Our results suggest that overexpression of OsHAD3 could decrease the drought tolerance of rice and provide a new strategy for improving drought tolerance in rice	Overexpression of OsHAD3, a Member of HAD Superfamily, Decreases Drought Tolerance of Rice. |  Under drought stress, overexpression of OsHAD3 increases the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde than wild type |  OsHAD3-overexpression lines decreased but antisense-expression lines increased the roots length under drought stress and the transcription levels of many well-known stress-related genes were also changed in plants with different genotypes |  Furthermore, overexpression of OsHAD3 also decreases the oxidative tolerance |  Our results suggest that overexpression of OsHAD3 could decrease the drought tolerance of rice and provide a new strategy for improving drought tolerance in rice
