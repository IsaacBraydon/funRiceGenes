NA	Overexpression of OsHAD3, a Member of HAD Superfamily, Decreases Drought Tolerance of Rice.	2023	Rice (N Y)	Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, 611130, People&#x27;s Republic of China.	Haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase (HAD) superfamily have been shown to get involved in plant growth and abiotic stress response. Although the various functions and regulatory mechanism of HAD superfamily have been well demonstrated, we know little about the function of this family in conferring abiotic stress tolerance to rice. Here, we report OsHAD3, a HAD superfamily member, could affect drought tolerance of rice. Under drought stress, overexpression of OsHAD3 increases the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde than wild type. OsHAD3-overexpression lines decreased but antisense-expression lines increased the roots length under drought stress and the transcription levels of many well-known stress-related genes were also changed in plants with different genotypes. Furthermore, overexpression of OsHAD3 also decreases the oxidative tolerance. Our results suggest that overexpression of OsHAD3 could decrease the drought tolerance of rice and provide a new strategy for improving drought tolerance in rice.
