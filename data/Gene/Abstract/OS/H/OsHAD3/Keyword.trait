OsHAD3	drought	Overexpression of OsHAD3, a Member of HAD Superfamily, Decreases Drought Tolerance of Rice.	 Under drought stress, overexpression of OsHAD3 increases the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde than wild type
OsHAD3	drought	Overexpression of OsHAD3, a Member of HAD Superfamily, Decreases Drought Tolerance of Rice.	 Our results suggest that overexpression of OsHAD3 could decrease the drought tolerance of rice and provide a new strategy for improving drought tolerance in rice
OsHAD3	drought stress	Overexpression of OsHAD3, a Member of HAD Superfamily, Decreases Drought Tolerance of Rice.	 Under drought stress, overexpression of OsHAD3 increases the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde than wild type
OsHAD3	tolerance	Overexpression of OsHAD3, a Member of HAD Superfamily, Decreases Drought Tolerance of Rice.	 Furthermore, overexpression of OsHAD3 also decreases the oxidative tolerance
