OsHAK8	transporter	Rice Potassium Transporter OsHAK8 Mediates K + Uptake and Translocation in Response to Low K + Stress	 As the OsHAK8 gene was broadly expressed in different cell types in the roots and its protein was targeted to the plasma membrane, we propose that OsHAK8 serves as a major transporter for both uptake and root-to-shoot translocation in rice plants
