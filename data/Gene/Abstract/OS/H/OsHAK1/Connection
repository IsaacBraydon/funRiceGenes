OsAKT1	OsHAK1	OsHAK1, a High-Affinity Potassium Transporter, Positively Regulates Responses to Drought Stress in Rice.	 Furthermore, qPCR analysis revealed that OsHAK1 act as a positive regulator of the expression of stress-responsive genes as well as of two well-known rice channel genes (OsTPKb and OsAKT1) involved in K homeostasis and stress responses in transgenic plants under dehydration

OsHAK1	OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8|OsHK1;5	Variation in the Abundance of OsHAK1 Transcript Underlies the Differential Salinity Tolerance of an indica and a japonica Rice Cultivar.	 At the transcriptome level, the over-expression of OsHAK1 stimulated a number of stress-responsive genes as well as four genes known to be involved in Na+ homeostasis and the salinity response (OsHKT1;5, OsSOS1, OsLti6a and OsLti6b)

OsHAK1	OsSKOR	Silicon alleviates salt stress-induced potassium deficiency by promoting potassium uptake and translocation in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Moreover, Si up-regulated the expression of genes responsible for K uptake (OsAKT1 and OsHAK1) and xylem loading (OsSKOR) in WTs but not in mutants

OsHAK1	OsHAK26	Function of Rice HAK Transporters in Pollen Development and Fertility.	 Knockout of either OsHAK26 or plasma membrane located H+-K+ symporter gene OsHAK1 or OsHAK5 in both Nipponbare and Dongjin cultivars caused distorted anthers, reduced number and germination rate of pollen grains
OsHAK1	OsHAK26	Function of Rice HAK Transporters in Pollen Development and Fertility.	 Seed-setting rate assay by reciprocal cross-pollination between the mutants of oshak26, oshak1, oshak5 and their wild types confirmed that each HAK transporter is foremost for pollen viability, seed-setting and grain yield
OsHAK1	OsHAK26	Function of Rice HAK Transporters in Pollen Development and Fertility.	 Intriguingly, the pollens of oshak26 showed much thinner wall and were more vulnerable to desiccation than those of oshak1 or oshak5
OsHAK1	OsHAK26	Function of Rice HAK Transporters in Pollen Development and Fertility.	 The results suggest that the role of OsHAK26 in maintaining pollen development and fertility may relate to its proper cargo sorting for construction of pollen walls, while the role of OsHAK1 and OsHAK5 in maintaining seed production likely relates to their transcellular K+ transport activity
