OsHAK1	 Here, we report the expression patterns and physiological roles of OsHAK1, a member belonging to KT/KUP/HAK gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L) |  Expression of OsHAK1 is up-regulated by K deficiency or salt stress in various tissues, particularly in the root and shoot apical meristem, the epidermises and steles of root, and vascular bundles of shoot |  Over-expression of OsHAK1 in rice increased K uptake and K/Na ratio
OsHAK1	 At the transcriptome level, the over-expression of OsHAK1 stimulated a number of stress-responsive genes as well as four genes known to be involved in Na+ homeostasis and the salinity response (OsHKT1;5, OsSOS1, OsLti6a and OsLti6b) |  The level of expression of OsHAK1 was correlated with Na+/K+ homeostasis, which implies that the gene should be explored a target for molecular approaches to the improvement of salinity tolerance in rice
