NA	Rice potassium transporter OsHAK1 is essential for maintaining potassium mediated growth and functions in salt tolerance over low and high potassium concentration ranges.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Lower-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, P.R. China.	Potassium (K) absorption and translocation in plants rely on multiple K transporters for adapting varied K supply and saline conditions. Here, we report the expression patterns and physiological roles of OsHAK1, a member belonging to KT/KUP/HAK gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L). Expression of OsHAK1 is up-regulated by K deficiency or salt stress in various tissues, particularly in the root and shoot apical meristem, the epidermises and steles of root, and vascular bundles of shoot. Both oshak1 knockout mutants in comparison to their respective Dongjin or Manan wild types showed dramatically reduction in K concentration and stunted root and shoot growth. Knockout of OsHAK1 reduced the K absorption rate of unit root surface area by 50-55% and 30%, and total K uptake by 80% and 65% at 0.05-0.1mM and 1mM K supply level, respectively. The root net high affinity K uptake of oshak1 mutants was sensitive to salt stress, but not to ammonium supply. Over-expression of OsHAK1 in rice increased K uptake and K/Na ratio. The positive relationship between K concentration and shoot biomass in the mutants suggests that OsHAK1 plays an essential role in K-mediated rice growth and salt tolerance over low and high K concentration ranges.
NA	Production of low-Cs(+) rice plants by inactivation of the K(+) transporter OsHAK1 with the CRISPR-Cas system.	2017	Plant J	Biochimie et Physiologie MolÃ©culaire des Plantes, Institut de Biologie IntÃ©grative des Plantes, UMR 5004 CNRS/ 386 INRA/Montpellier SupAgro/UniversitÃ© Montpellier, 34060, Montpellier Cedex 2, France.	Occurrence of radiocesium in food has raised sharp health concerns after nuclear accidents. Despite being present at low concentrations in contaminated soils (below Î¼M), cesium (Cs(+) ) can be taken up by crops and transported to their edible parts. Such a plant capacity to take up Cs(+) from low concentrations has notably affected the production of rice (Oryza sativa L.) in Japan after the nuclear accident at Fukushima in 2011. Several strategies have been put into practice to reduce Cs(+) content in this crop species, such as contaminated soil removal or adaptation of agricultural practices, including dedicated fertilizer management, with limited impact or pernicious side effects. On the other hand, development of biotechnological approaches aiming at reducing Cs(+) accumulation in rice remained challenging. Here, we show that inactivation of the Cs(+) -permeable K(+) transporter OsHAK1 with the CRISPR-Cas system dramatically reduced Cs(+) uptake by rice plants. Cs(+) uptake in rice roots and in transformed yeast cells expressing OsHAK1 displayed very similar kinetics parameters. In rice, Cs(+) uptake is dependent on two functional properties of OsHAK1: (i) a poor capacity of this system to discriminate between Cs(+) and K(+) , and (ii) a high capacity to transport Cs(+) from very low external concentrations, which is likely to involve an active transport mechanism. In an experiment with a Fukushima soil highly contaminated with (137) Cs(+) , plants lacking OsHAK1 function displayed strikingly reduced levels of (137) Cs(+) in roots and shoots. These results open stimulating perspectives to smartly produce safe food in regions contaminated by nuclear accidents. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
NA	Cesium Uptake by Rice Roots Largely Depends Upon a Single Gene, HAK1, Which Encodes a Potassium Transporter.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Biological Production, Faculty of Bio-resource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University, Kaidobata-Nishi 241-438, Shimoshinjo Nakano, Akita 010-0915, Japan.	Incidents at the Fukushima and Chernobyl nuclear power stations have resulted in widespread environmental contamination by radioactive nuclides. Among them, 137cesium has a 30 year half-life, and its persistence in soil raises serious food security issues. It is therefore important to prevent plants, especially crop plants, from absorbing radiocesium. In Arabidopsis thaliana, cesium ions are transported into root cells by several different potassium transporters such as high-affinity K+ transporter 5 (AtHAK5). Therefore, the cesium uptake pathway is thought to be highly redundant, making it difficult to develop plants with low cesium uptake. Here, we isolated rice mutants with low cesium uptake and reveal that the Oryza sativa potassium transporter OsHAK1, which is expressed on the surfaces of roots, is the main route of cesium influx into rice plants, especially in low potassium conditions. During hydroponic cultivation with low to normal potassium concentrations (0-206 ÂµM: the normal potassium level in soil), cesium influx in OsHAK1-knockout lines was no greater than one-eighth that in the wild type. In field experiments, knockout lines of O. sativa HAK1 (OsHAK1) showed dramatically reduced cesium concentrations in grains and shoots, but their potassium uptake was not greatly affected and their grain yields were similar to that of the wild type. Our results demonstrate that, in rice roots, potassium transport systems other than OsHAK1 make little or no contribution to cesium uptake. These results show that low cesium uptake rice lines can be developed for cultivation in radiocesium-contaminated areas.
NA	OsHAK1, a High-Affinity Potassium Transporter, Positively Regulates Responses to Drought Stress in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	State Key Lab for Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, China.	Drought is one of the environmental factors that severely restrict plant distribution and crop production. Recently, we reported that the high-affinity potassium transporter OsHAK1 plays important roles in K acquisition and translocation in rice over low and high K concentration ranges, however, knowledge on the regulatory roles of OsHAK1 in osmotic/drought stress is limited. Here, transcript levels of OsHAK1 were found transiently elevated by water deficit in roots and shoots, consistent with the enhanced GUS activity in transgenic plants under stress. Under drought conditions, OsHAK1 knockout mutants (KO) presented lower tolerance to the stress and displayed stunted growth at both the vegetative and reproductive stages. Phenotypic analysis of OsHAK1 overexpression seedlings (Ox) demonstrated that they present better tolerance to drought stress than wild-type (WT). Compared to WT seedlings, OsHAK1 overexpressors had lower level of lipid peroxidation, higher activities of antioxidant enzymes (POX and CAT) and higher proline accumulation. Furthermore, qPCR analysis revealed that OsHAK1 act as a positive regulator of the expression of stress-responsive genes as well as of two well-known rice channel genes (OsTPKb and OsAKT1) involved in K homeostasis and stress responses in transgenic plants under dehydration. Most important, OsHAK1-Ox plants displayed enhanced drought tolerance at the reproductive stage, resulting in 35% more grain yield than WT under drought conditions, and without exhibiting significant differences under normal growth conditions. Consequently, OsHAK1 can be considered to be used in molecular breeding for improvement of drought tolerance in rice.
NA	Variation in the Abundance of OsHAK1 Transcript Underlies the Differential Salinity Tolerance of an indica and a japonica Rice Cultivar.	2018	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, China.	Salinity imposes a major constraint over the productivity of rice. A set of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs), derived from a cross between the japonica type cultivar (cv.) Nipponbare (salinity sensitive) and the indica type cv. 9311 (moderately tolerant), was scored using a hydroponics system for their salinity tolerance at the seedling stage. Two of the CSSLs, which share a ¡«1.2 Mbp stretch of chromosome 4 derived from cv. Nipponbare, were as sensitive to the stress as cv. Nipponbare itself. Fine mapping based on an F2 population bred from a backcross between one of these CSSLs and cv. 9311 narrowed this region to 95 Kbp, within which only one gene (OsHAK1) exhibited a differential (lower) transcript abundance in cv. Nipponbare and the two CSSLs compared to in cv. 9311. The gene was up-regulated by exposure to salinity stress both in the root and the shoot, while a knockout mutant proved to be more salinity sensitive than its wild type with respect to its growth at both the vegetative and reproductive stages. Seedlings over-expressing OsHAK1 were more tolerant than wild type, displaying a superior photosynthetic rate, a higher leaf chlorophyll content, an enhanced accumulation of proline and a reduced level of lipid peroxidation. At the transcriptome level, the over-expression of OsHAK1 stimulated a number of stress-responsive genes as well as four genes known to be involved in Na+ homeostasis and the salinity response (OsHKT1;5, OsSOS1, OsLti6a and OsLti6b). When the stress was applied at booting through to maturity, the OsHAK1 over-expressors out-yielded wild type by 25%, and no negative pleiotropic effects were expressed in plants gown under non-saline conditions. The level of expression of OsHAK1 was correlated with Na+/K+ homeostasis, which implies that the gene should be explored a target for molecular approaches to the improvement of salinity tolerance in rice.
NA	OsHAK1 controls the vegetative growth and panicle fertility of rice by its effect on potassium-mediated sugar metabolism.	2018	Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, PR China; State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Lower-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, PR China. Electronic address: chenguang0066@126.com.	Plant growth and reproduction are both energy-requiring processes; the necessary energy is supplied by the products of photosynthesis. Both the vegetative growth and reproductive success of rice are compromised by the absence of a functional copy of the gene OsHAK1. Here, a comparison between wild type rice and OsHAK1 knockout mutants not only confirmed the known detrimental effect of the absence of OsHAK1 on root growth, pollen viability and fertility, but also showed that sucrose phosphate synthase activity was lowered, and the sucrose content of the leaves was markedly increased, due to a partial block on the up-loading of sucrose into the phloem. The impaired allocation of sugar to the roots and spikelets caused by the knocking out of OsHAK1 was accompanied by a down-regulation in the leaf sheaths and panicle axes of genes encoding sucrose transporters (SUT genes), which are active in the phloem, as well as in the roots and spikelets of those encoding monosaccharide transporters (MST genes), which transport hexose sugars across the plant plasma membrane. The activity of sucrose synthase, acid invertase and neutral invertase in the roots of mutant plants assayed at the tillering stage, and in their spikelets, assayed during grain-filling, was significantly lower than in the equivalent organs of wild type plants. As a result, the supply of total soluble sugar, glucose and fructose to sink organs was reduced, consistent with the effect of the mutation on root growth and panicle fertility. Compared to wild type plants, the mutants accumulated less potassium (K) throughout the plant. The conclusion was that the failure to fully supply the demand of the mutant's sink organs for assimilate was responsible for its compromised phenotype, and that the deficiency in K uptake induced by the loss of OsHAK1 functionality was responsible for the disruption of sugar metabolism.
NA	The Potassium Transporter OsHAK5 Alters Rice Architecture via ATP-Dependent Transmembrane Auxin Fluxes	2020	Plant Commun	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Lower-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Plant HAK/KUP/KT family members function as plasma membrane (PM) H+/K+ symporters and may modulate chemiosmotically-driven polar auxin transport (PAT). Here, we show that inactivation of OsHAK5, a rice K+ transporter gene, decreased rootward and shootward PAT, tiller number, and the length of both lateral roots and root hairs, while OsHAK5 overexpression increased PAT, tiller number, and root hair length, irrespective of the K+ supply. Inhibitors of ATP-binding-cassette type-B transporters, NPA and BUM, abolished the OsHAK5-overexpression effect on PAT. The mechanistic basis of these changes included the OsHAK5-mediated decrease of transmembrane potential (depolarization), increase of extracellular pH, and increase of PM-ATPase activity. These findings highlight the dual roles of OsHAK5 in altering cellular chemiosmotic gradients (generated continuously by PM H+-ATPase) and regulating ATP-dependent auxin transport. Both functions may underlie the prominent effect of OsHAK5 on rice architecture, which may be exploited in the future to increase crop yield via genetic manipulations.
NA	Silicon alleviates salt stress-induced potassium deficiency by promoting potassium uptake and translocation in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2021	J Plant Physiol	Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Environment Remediation and Ecological Health, College of Environmental & Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Under salt stress, plants suffer from potassium (K) deficiency caused by excess salts in growth substrate. Silicon (Si) can promote K status in many plant species under salt stress, however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we assessed the effects of Si on K homeostasis in rice under salt stress and investigated the mechanisms behind using two low-Si rice mutants (lsi1 and lsi2) and their wild types (WTs). After five days' treatment with Si, plant growth was improved and salt stress-induced K deficiency was alleviated in WTs but not in mutants. Simultaneously, Si significantly enhanced K accumulation content, K uptake index and shoot K distribution rate in WTs but not in mutants. Besides, Si enhanced K concentration in xylem sap in WTs but not in mutants. Scanning ion-selected electrode technique (SIET) analysis showed net K influx rate was raised by Si addition under salt stress in WTs but not in mutants. Moreover, Si up-regulated the expression of genes responsible for K uptake (OsAKT1 and OsHAK1) and xylem loading (OsSKOR) in WTs but not in mutants. Overall, our results strongly indicate that Si can improve K uptake and translocation by up-regulating the expression of relevant genes, thereby promoting K status and alleviating salt stress in rice.
NA	Function of Rice HAK Transporters in Pollen Development and Fertility.	2022	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Plant HAK/KUP/KT transporters have been predicted as membrane H+-K+ symporters in facilitating K+ uptake and distribution, while their role in seed production remains to be elucidated. In this study, we report that OsHAK26 is preferentially expressed in anthers and seed husks and located in Golgi apparatus. Knockout of either OsHAK26 or plasma membrane located H+-K+ symporter gene OsHAK1 or OsHAK5 in both Nipponbare and Dongjin cultivars caused distorted anthers, reduced number and germination rate of pollen grains. Seed-setting rate assay by reciprocal cross-pollination between the mutants of oshak26, oshak1, oshak5 and their wild types confirmed that each HAK transporter is foremost for pollen viability, seed-setting and grain yield. Intriguingly, the pollens of oshak26 showed much thinner wall and were more vulnerable to desiccation than those of oshak1 or oshak5. In vitro assay revealed that the pollen germination rate of oshak5 was dramatically affected by external K+ concentration. The results suggest that the role of OsHAK26 in maintaining pollen development and fertility may relate to its proper cargo sorting for construction of pollen walls, while the role of OsHAK1 and OsHAK5 in maintaining seed production likely relates to their transcellular K+ transport activity.
