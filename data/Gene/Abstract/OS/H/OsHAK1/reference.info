China.	Potassium (K) absorption and translocation in plants rely on multiple K transporters for adapting varied K supply and saline conditions. Here, we report the expression patterns and physiological roles of OsHAK1, a member belonging to KT/KUP/HAK gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L). Expression of OsHAK1 is up-regulated by K deficiency or salt stress in various tissues, particularly in the root and shoot apical meristem, the epidermises and steles of root, and vascular bundles of shoot. Both oshak1 knockout mutants in comparison to their respective Dongjin or Manan wild types showed dramatically reduction in K concentration and stunted root and shoot growth. Knockout of OsHAK1 reduced the K absorption rate of unit root surface area by 50-55% and 30%, and total K uptake by 80% and 65% at 0.05-0.1mM and 1mM K supply level, respectively. The root net high affinity K uptake of oshak1 mutants was sensitive to salt stress, but not to ammonium supply. Over-expression of OsHAK1 in rice increased K uptake and K/Na ratio. The positive relationship between K concentration and shoot biomass in the mutants suggests that OsHAK1 plays an essential role in K-mediated rice growth and salt tolerance over low and high K concentration ranges.
