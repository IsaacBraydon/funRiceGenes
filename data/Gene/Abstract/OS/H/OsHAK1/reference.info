NA	Rice potassium transporter OsHAK1 is essential for maintaining potassium mediated growth and functions in salt tolerance over low and high potassium concentration ranges.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Lower-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, P.R. China.	Potassium (K) absorption and translocation in plants rely on multiple K transporters for adapting varied K supply and saline conditions. Here, we report the expression patterns and physiological roles of OsHAK1, a member belonging to KT/KUP/HAK gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L). Expression of OsHAK1 is up-regulated by K deficiency or salt stress in various tissues, particularly in the root and shoot apical meristem, the epidermises and steles of root, and vascular bundles of shoot. Both oshak1 knockout mutants in comparison to their respective Dongjin or Manan wild types showed dramatically reduction in K concentration and stunted root and shoot growth. Knockout of OsHAK1 reduced the K absorption rate of unit root surface area by 50-55% and 30%, and total K uptake by 80% and 65% at 0.05-0.1mM and 1mM K supply level, respectively. The root net high affinity K uptake of oshak1 mutants was sensitive to salt stress, but not to ammonium supply. Over-expression of OsHAK1 in rice increased K uptake and K/Na ratio. The positive relationship between K concentration and shoot biomass in the mutants suggests that OsHAK1 plays an essential role in K-mediated rice growth and salt tolerance over low and high K concentration ranges.
NA	Production of low-Cs(+) rice plants by inactivation of the K(+) transporter OsHAK1 with the CRISPR-Cas system.	2017	Plant J	Biochimie et Physiologie Moléculaire des Plantes, Institut de Biologie Intégrative des Plantes, UMR 5004 CNRS/ 386 INRA/Montpellier SupAgro/Université Montpellier, 34060, Montpellier Cedex 2, France.	Occurrence of radiocesium in food has raised sharp health concerns after nuclear accidents. Despite being present at low concentrations in contaminated soils (below μM), cesium (Cs(+) ) can be taken up by crops and transported to their edible parts. Such a plant capacity to take up Cs(+) from low concentrations has notably affected the production of rice (Oryza sativa L.) in Japan after the nuclear accident at Fukushima in 2011. Several strategies have been put into practice to reduce Cs(+) content in this crop species, such as contaminated soil removal or adaptation of agricultural practices, including dedicated fertilizer management, with limited impact or pernicious side effects. On the other hand, development of biotechnological approaches aiming at reducing Cs(+) accumulation in rice remained challenging. Here, we show that inactivation of the Cs(+) -permeable K(+) transporter OsHAK1 with the CRISPR-Cas system dramatically reduced Cs(+) uptake by rice plants. Cs(+) uptake in rice roots and in transformed yeast cells expressing OsHAK1 displayed very similar kinetics parameters. In rice, Cs(+) uptake is dependent on two functional properties of OsHAK1: (i) a poor capacity of this system to discriminate between Cs(+) and K(+) , and (ii) a high capacity to transport Cs(+) from very low external concentrations, which is likely to involve an active transport mechanism. In an experiment with a Fukushima soil highly contaminated with (137) Cs(+) , plants lacking OsHAK1 function displayed strikingly reduced levels of (137) Cs(+) in roots and shoots. These results open stimulating perspectives to smartly produce safe food in regions contaminated by nuclear accidents. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
NA	Cesium Uptake by Rice Roots Largely Depends Upon a Single Gene, HAK1, Which Encodes a Potassium Transporter.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Biological Production, Faculty of Bio-resource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University, Kaidobata-Nishi 241-438, Shimoshinjo Nakano, Akita 010-0915, Japan.	Incidents at the Fukushima and Chernobyl nuclear power stations have resulted in widespread environmental contamination by radioactive nuclides. Among them, 137cesium has a 30 year half-life, and its persistence in soil raises serious food security issues. It is therefore important to prevent plants, especially crop plants, from absorbing radiocesium. In Arabidopsis thaliana, cesium ions are transported into root cells by several different potassium transporters such as high-affinity K+ transporter 5 (AtHAK5). Therefore, the cesium uptake pathway is thought to be highly redundant, making it difficult to develop plants with low cesium uptake. Here, we isolated rice mutants with low cesium uptake and reveal that the Oryza sativa potassium transporter OsHAK1, which is expressed on the surfaces of roots, is the main route of cesium influx into rice plants, especially in low potassium conditions. During hydroponic cultivation with low to normal potassium concentrations (0-206 µM: the normal potassium level in soil), cesium influx in OsHAK1-knockout lines was no greater than one-eighth that in the wild type. In field experiments, knockout lines of O. sativa HAK1 (OsHAK1) showed dramatically reduced cesium concentrations in grains and shoots, but their potassium uptake was not greatly affected and their grain yields were similar to that of the wild type. Our results demonstrate that, in rice roots, potassium transport systems other than OsHAK1 make little or no contribution to cesium uptake. These results show that low cesium uptake rice lines can be developed for cultivation in radiocesium-contaminated areas.
NA	OsHAK1, a High-Affinity Potassium Transporter, Positively Regulates Responses to Drought Stress in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	State Key Lab for Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, China.	Drought is one of the environmental factors that severely restrict plant distribution and crop production. Recently, we reported that the high-affinity potassium transporter OsHAK1 plays important roles in K acquisition and translocation in rice over low and high K concentration ranges, however, knowledge on the regulatory roles of OsHAK1 in osmotic/drought stress is limited. Here, transcript levels of OsHAK1 were found transiently elevated by water deficit in roots and shoots, consistent with the enhanced GUS activity in transgenic plants under stress. Under drought conditions, OsHAK1 knockout mutants (KO) presented lower tolerance to the stress and displayed stunted growth at both the vegetative and reproductive stages. Phenotypic analysis of OsHAK1 overexpression seedlings (Ox) demonstrated that they present better tolerance to drought stress than wild-type (WT). Compared to WT seedlings, OsHAK1 overexpressors had lower level of lipid peroxidation, higher activities of antioxidant enzymes (POX and CAT) and higher proline accumulation. Furthermore, qPCR analysis revealed that OsHAK1 act as a positive regulator of the expression of stress-responsive genes as well as of two well-known rice channel genes (OsTPKb and OsAKT1) involved in K homeostasis and stress responses in transgenic plants under dehydration. Most important, OsHAK1-Ox plants displayed enhanced drought tolerance at the reproductive stage, resulting in 35% more grain yield than WT under drought conditions, and without exhibiting significant differences under normal growth conditions. Consequently, OsHAK1 can be considered to be used in molecular breeding for improvement of drought tolerance in rice.
