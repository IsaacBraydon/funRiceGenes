NA	Rice potassium transporter OsHAK1 is essential for maintaining potassium mediated growth and functions in salt tolerance over low and high potassium concentration ranges.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Lower-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, P.R. China.	Potassium (K) absorption and translocation in plants rely on multiple K transporters for adapting varied K supply and saline conditions. Here, we report the expression patterns and physiological roles of OsHAK1, a member belonging to KT/KUP/HAK gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L). Expression of OsHAK1 is up-regulated by K deficiency or salt stress in various tissues, particularly in the root and shoot apical meristem, the epidermises and steles of root, and vascular bundles of shoot. Both oshak1 knockout mutants in comparison to their respective Dongjin or Manan wild types showed dramatically reduction in K concentration and stunted root and shoot growth. Knockout of OsHAK1 reduced the K absorption rate of unit root surface area by 50-55% and 30%, and total K uptake by 80% and 65% at 0.05-0.1mM and 1mM K supply level, respectively. The root net high affinity K uptake of oshak1 mutants was sensitive to salt stress, but not to ammonium supply. Over-expression of OsHAK1 in rice increased K uptake and K/Na ratio. The positive relationship between K concentration and shoot biomass in the mutants suggests that OsHAK1 plays an essential role in K-mediated rice growth and salt tolerance over low and high K concentration ranges.
NA	Production of low-Cs(+) rice plants by inactivation of the K(+) transporter OsHAK1 with the CRISPR-Cas system.	2017	Plant J	Biochimie et Physiologie Moléculaire des Plantes, Institut de Biologie Intégrative des Plantes, UMR 5004 CNRS/ 386 INRA/Montpellier SupAgro/Université Montpellier, 34060, Montpellier Cedex 2, France.	Occurrence of radiocesium in food has raised sharp health concerns after nuclear accidents. Despite being present at low concentrations in contaminated soils (below μM), cesium (Cs(+) ) can be taken up by crops and transported to their edible parts. Such a plant capacity to take up Cs(+) from low concentrations has notably affected the production of rice (Oryza sativa L.) in Japan after the nuclear accident at Fukushima in 2011. Several strategies have been put into practice to reduce Cs(+) content in this crop species, such as contaminated soil removal or adaptation of agricultural practices, including dedicated fertilizer management, with limited impact or pernicious side effects. On the other hand, development of biotechnological approaches aiming at reducing Cs(+) accumulation in rice remained challenging. Here, we show that inactivation of the Cs(+) -permeable K(+) transporter OsHAK1 with the CRISPR-Cas system dramatically reduced Cs(+) uptake by rice plants. Cs(+) uptake in rice roots and in transformed yeast cells expressing OsHAK1 displayed very similar kinetics parameters. In rice, Cs(+) uptake is dependent on two functional properties of OsHAK1: (i) a poor capacity of this system to discriminate between Cs(+) and K(+) , and (ii) a high capacity to transport Cs(+) from very low external concentrations, which is likely to involve an active transport mechanism. In an experiment with a Fukushima soil highly contaminated with (137) Cs(+) , plants lacking OsHAK1 function displayed strikingly reduced levels of (137) Cs(+) in roots and shoots. These results open stimulating perspectives to smartly produce safe food in regions contaminated by nuclear accidents. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
