OsHKT1;4	OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8|OsHK1;5	A two-staged model of Na+ exclusion in rice explained by 3D modeling of HKT transporters and alternative splicing	Amongst these transporters, the cereal HKT1;4 and HKT1;5 are responsible for Na(+) exclusion from photosynthetic tissues, a key mechanism for plant salinity tolerance
OsHKT1;4	OsJRL	OsJRL, a rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin gene, enhances Escherichia coli viability under high-salinity stress and improves salinity tolerance of rice.	Overexpression of OsJRL in rice also enhanced salinity tolerance and increased the expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including three LEA (late embryogenesis abundant proteins) genes (OsLEA19a, OsLEA23 and OsLEA24), three Na(+) transporter genes (OsHKT1;3, OsHKT1;4 and OsHKT1;5) and two DREB genes (OsDREB1A and OsDREB2B)
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsHKT1;4	Constitutive Contribution by the Rice OsHKT1;4 Na + Transporter to Xylem Sap Desalinization and Low Na + Accumulation in Young Leaves Under Low as High External Na + Conditions	 Three rice HKT genes, OsHKT1;1, OsHKT1;4 and OsHKT1;5, are known to contribute to salt tolerance by reducing Na+ accumulation in shoots upon salt stress
