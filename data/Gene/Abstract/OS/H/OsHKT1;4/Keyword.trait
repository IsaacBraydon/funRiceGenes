OsHKT1;4	sheath	A two-staged model of Na+ exclusion in rice explained by 3D modeling of HKT transporters and alternative splicing	 For OsHKT1;4, alternative splicing of transcript and the anatomical complexity of the sheath needed to be taken into account| Thus, Na(+) accumulation in a specific leaf blade seems to be regulated by abundance of a correctly spliced OsHKT1;4 transcript in a corresponding sheath
