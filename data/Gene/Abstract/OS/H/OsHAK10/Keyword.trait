OsHAK10	salt	Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	" The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 might contribute to accumulation of Na+ in old leaves under salt stress"
OsHAK10	transporter	Inventory and functional characterization of the HAK potassium transporters of rice	 Phylogenetic analysis of the encoded transporters reveals a great diversity among them, and three distant transporters, OsHAK1, OsHAK7, and OsHAK10, were expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and bacterial mutants to determine their functions
