NA	Role of rice cytosolic hexokinase OsHXK7 in sugar signaling and metabolism.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	Crop Biotech Institute &amp; Graduate School of Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 446-701, Korea.	We characterized the function of the rice cytosolic hexokinase OsHXK7 (Oryza sativa Hexokinase7), which is highly upregulated when seeds germinate under O2 -deficient conditions. According to transient expression assays that used the promoter:luciferase fusion construct, OsHXK7 enhanced the glucose (Glc)-dependent repression of a rice Î±-amylase gene (RAmy3D) in the mesophyll protoplasts of maize, but its catalytically inactive mutant alleles did not. Consistently, the expression of OsHXK7, but not its catalytically inactive alleles, complemented the Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2-1 (gin2-1) mutant, thereby resulting in the wild type characteristics of Glc-dependent repression, seedling development, and plant growth. Interestingly, OsHXK7-mediated Glc-dependent repression was abolished in the O2 -deficient mesophyll protoplasts of maize. This result provides compelling evidence that OsHXK7 functions in sugar signaling via a glycolysis-dependent manner under normal conditions, but its signaling role is suppressed when O2 is deficient. The germination of two null OsHXK7 mutants, oshxk7-1 and oshxk7-2, was affected by O2 deficiency, but overexpression enhanced germination in rice. This result suggests the distinct role that OsHXK7 plays in sugar metabolism and efficient germination by enforcing glycolysis-mediated fermentation in O2 -deficient rice.
NA	Conformational Characteristics of Rice Hexokinase OsHXK7 as a Moonlighting Protein involved in Sugar Signalling and Metabolism.	2017	Protein J	Beijing Key Laboratory of Gene Resource and Molecular Development, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China.	Hexokinase (HXK) as a moonlighting protein involves in glucose metabolism and signalling to regulate growth and development in plants. Therefore, the clarification for the structural properties of OsHXK7 (Oryza sativa Hexokinase 7) is essential to understand its role mechanism associated with the Glc signalling and metabolism. In this study, the structural characteristics of OsHXK7 (Oryza sativa Hexokinase 7) were identified. In the fluorescence spectrum, the Trp peak representing OsHXK7 binding to D-glucose (D-Glc) and 2-deoxyglucose (2-dG) showed an obvious blue shift. The distinct change in the secondary structure of OsHXK7 after binding to Glc was also detected in circular dichroism spectra. Using superimposed modelling, OsHXK7 showed a Glc-induced structural change, in which the 76th glycine, 148th serine and 256th tryptophan were contained within the pocket region. It was further shown by site-directed mutagenesis that the 76th glycine and the 256th tryptophan, but not the 148th serine, are the pivotal sites of OsHXK7 that maintain its catalytic activity and intrinsic blue shift fluorescence. These results suggest that OsHXK7 binding to Glc leads to a conformational change, that is likely essential for the function of OsHXK7 in Glc signalling and metabolism during plant growth and development.
