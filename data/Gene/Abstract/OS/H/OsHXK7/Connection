alphaAmy3|OsAmy3D|RAmy3D|OsRAM3D	OsHXK7	Role of rice cytosolic hexokinase OsHXK7 in sugar signaling and metabolism.	According to transient expression assays that used the promoter:luciferase fusion construct, OsHXK7 enhanced the glucose (Glc)-dependent repression of a rice Î±-amylase gene (RAmy3D) in the mesophyll protoplasts of maize, but its catalytically inactive mutant alleles did not
