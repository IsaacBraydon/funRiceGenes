OsHXK7	sugar	Role of rice cytosolic hexokinase OsHXK7 in sugar signaling and metabolism.	Role of rice cytosolic hexokinase OsHXK7 in sugar signaling and metabolism.
OsHXK7	sugar	Role of rice cytosolic hexokinase OsHXK7 in sugar signaling and metabolism.	 This result provides compelling evidence that OsHXK7 functions in sugar signaling via a glycolysis-dependent manner under normal conditions, but its signaling role is suppressed when O2 is deficient
OsHXK7	sugar	Role of rice cytosolic hexokinase OsHXK7 in sugar signaling and metabolism.	 This result suggests the distinct role that OsHXK7 plays in sugar metabolism and efficient germination by enforcing glycolysis-mediated fermentation in O2 -deficient rice
