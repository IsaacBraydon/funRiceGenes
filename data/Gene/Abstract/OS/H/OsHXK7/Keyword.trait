OsHXK7	sugar	Role of rice cytosolic hexokinase OsHXK7 in sugar signaling and metabolism.	Role of rice cytosolic hexokinase OsHXK7 in sugar signaling and metabolism.
OsHXK7	sugar	Role of rice cytosolic hexokinase OsHXK7 in sugar signaling and metabolism.	This result provides compelling evidence that OsHXK7 functions in sugar signaling via a glycolysis-dependent manner under normal conditions, but its signaling role is suppressed when O2 is deficient
OsHXK7	sugar	Role of rice cytosolic hexokinase OsHXK7 in sugar signaling and metabolism.	This result suggests the distinct role that OsHXK7 plays in sugar metabolism and efficient germination by enforcing glycolysis-mediated fermentation in O2 -deficient rice
OsHXK7	growth	Conformational Characteristics of Rice Hexokinase OsHXK7 as a Moonlighting Protein involved in Sugar Signalling and Metabolism.	 These results suggest that OsHXK7 binding to Glc leads to a conformational change, that is likely essential for the function of OsHXK7 in Glc signalling and metabolism during plant growth and development
OsHXK7	development	Conformational Characteristics of Rice Hexokinase OsHXK7 as a Moonlighting Protein involved in Sugar Signalling and Metabolism.	 These results suggest that OsHXK7 binding to Glc leads to a conformational change, that is likely essential for the function of OsHXK7 in Glc signalling and metabolism during plant growth and development
OsHXK7	sugar	Conformational Characteristics of Rice Hexokinase OsHXK7 as a Moonlighting Protein involved in Sugar Signalling and Metabolism.	Conformational Characteristics of Rice Hexokinase OsHXK7 as a Moonlighting Protein involved in Sugar Signalling and Metabolism.
OsHXK7	plant growth	Conformational Characteristics of Rice Hexokinase OsHXK7 as a Moonlighting Protein involved in Sugar Signalling and Metabolism.	 These results suggest that OsHXK7 binding to Glc leads to a conformational change, that is likely essential for the function of OsHXK7 in Glc signalling and metabolism during plant growth and development
