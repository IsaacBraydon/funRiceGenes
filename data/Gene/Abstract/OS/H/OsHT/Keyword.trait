OsHT|OsLHT1	transporter	OsHT, a rice gene encoding for a plasma-membrane localized histidine transporter	Using a degenerative probe designed according to the most conservative region of a known Lys- and His-specific amino acid transporter (LHT1) from Arabidopsis, we isolated a full-length cDNA named OsHT (histidine transporter of Oryza sativa L
OsHT|OsLHT1	transporter	OsHT, a rice gene encoding for a plasma-membrane localized histidine transporter	Multiple sequence alignments showed that OsHT shares a high degree of sequence conservation at the deduced amino acid level with the Arabidopsis LHT1 and six putative lysine and histidine transporters
OsHT|OsLHT1	transporter	OsHT, a rice gene encoding for a plasma-membrane localized histidine transporter	Functional complementation experiments demonstrated that OsHT was able to work as a histidine transporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that OsHT is a gene that encodes for a histidine transporter from rice
OsHT|OsLHT1	transporter	OsHT, a rice gene encoding for a plasma-membrane localized histidine transporter	OsHT, a rice gene encoding for a plasma-membrane localized histidine transporter
OsHT|OsLHT1	leaf	Disruption of an amino acid transporter LHT1 leads to growth inhibition and low yields in rice.	 QRT-PCR analysis indicated that OsLHT1 was expressed in various rice organs, including root, stem, flag leaf, flag leaf sheath and young panicle
OsHT|OsLHT1	root	Disruption of an amino acid transporter LHT1 leads to growth inhibition and low yields in rice.	 Two oslht1 mutants were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology, and the loss-of-function of OsLHT1 inhibited rice root and shoot growth, thereby markedly reducing grain yields
OsHT|OsLHT1	growth	Disruption of an amino acid transporter LHT1 leads to growth inhibition and low yields in rice.	 The aims of this study are to analyze the substrate selectivity of OsLHT1 and influence of its disruption on rice growth and fecundity
OsHT|OsLHT1	growth	Disruption of an amino acid transporter LHT1 leads to growth inhibition and low yields in rice.	Our results indicated that OsLHT1 is an amino acid transporter with wide substrate specificity and with preference for neutral and acidic amino acids, and disruption of OsLHT1 function markedly inhibited rice growth and fecundity
OsHT|OsLHT1	shoot	Disruption of an amino acid transporter LHT1 leads to growth inhibition and low yields in rice.	 Two oslht1 mutants were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology, and the loss-of-function of OsLHT1 inhibited rice root and shoot growth, thereby markedly reducing grain yields
OsHT|OsLHT1	panicle	Disruption of an amino acid transporter LHT1 leads to growth inhibition and low yields in rice.	 QRT-PCR analysis indicated that OsLHT1 was expressed in various rice organs, including root, stem, flag leaf, flag leaf sheath and young panicle
OsHT|OsLHT1	grain	Disruption of an amino acid transporter LHT1 leads to growth inhibition and low yields in rice.	 Two oslht1 mutants were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology, and the loss-of-function of OsLHT1 inhibited rice root and shoot growth, thereby markedly reducing grain yields
OsHT|OsLHT1	sheath	Disruption of an amino acid transporter LHT1 leads to growth inhibition and low yields in rice.	 QRT-PCR analysis indicated that OsLHT1 was expressed in various rice organs, including root, stem, flag leaf, flag leaf sheath and young panicle
OsHT|OsLHT1	grain yield	Disruption of an amino acid transporter LHT1 leads to growth inhibition and low yields in rice.	 Two oslht1 mutants were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology, and the loss-of-function of OsLHT1 inhibited rice root and shoot growth, thereby markedly reducing grain yields
OsHT|OsLHT1	transporter	Disruption of an amino acid transporter LHT1 leads to growth inhibition and low yields in rice.	 OsLHT1 (Lysine/Histidine transporter) has been previously reported as a histidine transporter in yeast, but its substrate profile and function in planta are unclear
OsHT|OsLHT1	transporter	Disruption of an amino acid transporter LHT1 leads to growth inhibition and low yields in rice.	 Transient expression in rice protoplast suggested OsLHT1 was localized to the plasma membrane, which is consistent with its function as an amino acid transporter
OsHT|OsLHT1	transporter	Disruption of an amino acid transporter LHT1 leads to growth inhibition and low yields in rice.	Our results indicated that OsLHT1 is an amino acid transporter with wide substrate specificity and with preference for neutral and acidic amino acids, and disruption of OsLHT1 function markedly inhibited rice growth and fecundity
OsHT|OsLHT1	plasma membrane	Disruption of an amino acid transporter LHT1 leads to growth inhibition and low yields in rice.	 Transient expression in rice protoplast suggested OsLHT1 was localized to the plasma membrane, which is consistent with its function as an amino acid transporter
OsHT|OsLHT1	amino acid transporter	Disruption of an amino acid transporter LHT1 leads to growth inhibition and low yields in rice.	 Transient expression in rice protoplast suggested OsLHT1 was localized to the plasma membrane, which is consistent with its function as an amino acid transporter
OsHT|OsLHT1	amino acid transporter	Disruption of an amino acid transporter LHT1 leads to growth inhibition and low yields in rice.	Our results indicated that OsLHT1 is an amino acid transporter with wide substrate specificity and with preference for neutral and acidic amino acids, and disruption of OsLHT1 function markedly inhibited rice growth and fecundity
