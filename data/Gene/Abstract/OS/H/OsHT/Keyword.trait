OsHT|OsLHT1	transporter	OsHT, a rice gene encoding for a plasma-membrane localized histidine transporter	Using a degenerative probe designed according to the most conservative region of a known Lys- and His-specific amino acid transporter (LHT1) from Arabidopsis, we isolated a full-length cDNA named OsHT (histidine transporter of Oryza sativa L
OsHT|OsLHT1	transporter	OsHT, a rice gene encoding for a plasma-membrane localized histidine transporter	Multiple sequence alignments showed that OsHT shares a high degree of sequence conservation at the deduced amino acid level with the Arabidopsis LHT1 and six putative lysine and histidine transporters
OsHT|OsLHT1	transporter	OsHT, a rice gene encoding for a plasma-membrane localized histidine transporter	Functional complementation experiments demonstrated that OsHT was able to work as a histidine transporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that OsHT is a gene that encodes for a histidine transporter from rice
OsHT|OsLHT1	transporter	OsHT, a rice gene encoding for a plasma-membrane localized histidine transporter	OsHT, a rice gene encoding for a plasma-membrane localized histidine transporter
