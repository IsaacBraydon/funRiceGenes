The cDNA is 1.3 kb in length and the open reading frame encodes for a 441 amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 49 kDa. Multiple sequence alignments showed that OsHT shares a high degree of sequence conservation at the deduced amino acid level with the Arabidopsis LHT1 and six putative lysine and histidine transporters. Computational analysis indicated that OsHT is an integral membrane protein with 11 putative transmembrane helices. This was confirmed by the transient expression assay because the OsHT-GFP fusion protein was, indeed, localized mainly in the plasma membrane of onion epidermal cells. Functional complementation experiments demonstrated that OsHT was able to work as a histidine transporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that OsHT is a gene that encodes for a histidine transporter from rice. This is the first time that an LHT-type amino acid transporter gene has been cloned from higher plants other than Arabidopsis.
NA	Disruption of an amino acid transporter LHT1 leads to growth inhibition and low yields in rice.	2019	BMC Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530005, China.	Research on plant amino acid transporters was mainly performed in Arabidopsis, while our understanding of them is generally scant in rice. OsLHT1 (Lysine/Histidine transporter) has been previously reported as a histidine transporter in yeast, but its substrate profile and function in planta are unclear. The aims of this study are to analyze the substrate selectivity of OsLHT1 and influence of its disruption on rice growth and fecundity.Substrate selectivity of OsLHT1 was analyzed in Xenopus oocytes using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. The results showed that OsLHT1 could transport a broad spectrum of amino acids, including basic, neutral and acidic amino acids, and exhibited a preference for neutral and acidic amino acids. Two oslht1 mutants were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology, and the loss-of-function of OsLHT1 inhibited rice root and shoot growth, thereby markedly reducing grain yields. QRT-PCR analysis indicated that OsLHT1 was expressed in various rice organs, including root, stem, flag leaf, flag leaf sheath and young panicle. Transient expression in rice protoplast suggested OsLHT1 was localized to the plasma membrane, which is consistent with its function as an amino acid transporter.Our results indicated that OsLHT1 is an amino acid transporter with wide substrate specificity and with preference for neutral and acidic amino acids, and disruption of OsLHT1 function markedly inhibited rice growth and fecundity.
NA	Oryza sativa Lysine-Histidine-type Transporter 1 functions in root uptake and root-to-shoot allocation of amino acids in rice.	2020	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Lower-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	In agricultural soils, amino acids can represent vital nitrogen (N) sources for crop growth and yield. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying amino acid uptake and allocation are poorly understood in crop plants. This study shows that rice (Oryza sativa L.) roots can acquire aspartate at soil concentration, and that japonica subspecies take up this acidic amino acid 1.5-fold more efficiently than indica subspecies. Genetic association analyses with 68 representative japonica or indica germplasms identified rice Lysine-Histidine-type Transporter 1 (OsLHT1) as a candidate gene associated with the aspartate uptake trait. When expressed in yeast, OsLHT1 supported cell growth on a broad spectrum of amino acids and effectively transported aspartate, asparagine and glutamate. OsLHT1 is localized throughout the rice root, including root hairs, epidermis, cortex and stele, and to the leaf vasculature. Knockout of OsLHT1 in japonica resulted in reduced root uptake of amino acids. Furthermore, in 15 N-amino acid-fed mutants versus wild-type, a higher percentage of 15 N remained in roots instead of being allocated to the shoot. 15 N-ammonium uptake and subsequently the delivery of root synthesized amino acids to Oslht1 shoots were also significantly decreased, which was accompanied by reduced shoot growth. These results together provide evidence that OsLHT1 functions in both root uptake and root to shoot allocation of a broad spectrum of amino acids in rice.
NA	Rice OsLHT1 Functions in Leaf-to-Panicle Nitrogen Allocation for Grain Yield and Quality	2020	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Lower-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Proper allocation of nitrogen (N) from source leaves to grains is essential step for high crop grain yield and N use efficiency. In rice (Oryza sativa) grown in flooding paddy field, amino acids are the major N compounds for N distribution and re-allocation. We have recently identified that Lysine-Histidine-type Transporter 1 (OsLHT1) is the major transporter for root uptake and root-to-shoot allocation of amino acids in rice. In this study, we planted knockout mutant lines of OsLHT1 together wild-type (WT) in paddy field for evaluating OsLHT1 function in N redistribution and grain production. OsLHT1 is expressed in vascular bundles of leaves, rachis, and flowering organs. Oslht1 plants showed lower panicle length and seed setting rate, especially lower grain number per panicle and total grain weight. The concentrations of both total N and free amino acids in the flag leaf were similar at anthesis between Oslht1 lines and WT while significantly higher in the mutants than WT at maturation. The Oslht1 seeds contained higher proteins and most of the essential free amino acids, similar total starch but less amylose with lower paste viscosity than WT seeds. The mutant seeds showed lower germination rate than WT. Knockout of OsLHT1 decreased N uptake efficiency and physiological utilization efficiency (kg-grains/kg-N) by about 55% and 72%, respectively. Taken together, we conclude that OsLHT1 plays critical role in the translocation of amino acids from vegetative to reproductive organs for grain yield and quality of nutrition and functionality.
NA	Nitrogen Mediates Flowering Time and Nitrogen Use Efficiency via Floral Regulators in Rice	2020	Curr Biol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	High nitrogen (N) fertilization for maximizing crop yield commonly leads to postponed flowering time (heading date in rice) and ripening, thus affecting resources use efficiency and followed planting time. We found that N-mediated heading date-1 (Nhd1) can directly activate florigen gene OsHd3a in rice. Inactivation of either Nhd1 or OsHd3a results in delay and insensitivity to N supply of flowering time. Knockout of Nhd1 increases N uptake and utilization efficiency at low-to-moderate N level under both short- and long-day field conditions. Increasing glutamine, the product of N assimilation, can upregulate expression of Nhd1, which in turn downregulates OsFd-GOGAT expression and OsFd-GOGAT activity, displaying a Nhd1-controlled negative feedback regulatory pathway of N assimilation. Moreover, N fertilization effect on rice flowering time shows genetically controlled diversity, and single-nucleotide polymorphism in Nhd1 promoter may relate to different responses of flowering time to N application. Nhd1 thus balances flowering time and N use efficiency in addition to photoperiod in rice.
NA	The Amino Acid Transporter OsAAP4 Contributes to Rice Tillering and Grain Yield by Regulating Neutral Amino Acid Allocation through Two Splicing Variants	2021	Rice (N Y)	Key Laboratory of Plant Resource Conservation and Germplasm Innovation in Mountainous Region (Ministry of Education), College of Agricultural Sciences, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, China. zmfang@gzu.edu.cn.	Background: Amino acids, which are transported by amino acid transporters, are the major forms of organic nitrogen utilized by higher plants. Among the 19 Amino Acid Permease transporters (AAPs) in rice, only a small number of these genes have been reported to influence rice growth and development. However, whether other OsAAPs are responsible for rice growth and development is unclear.  Results: In this study, we demonstrate that OsAAP4 promoter sequences are divergent between Indica and Japonica, with higher expression in the former, which produces more tillers and higher grain yield than does Japonica. Overexpression of two different splicing variants of OsAAP4 in Japonica ZH11 significantly increased rice tillering and grain yield as result of enhancing the neutral amino acid concentrations of Val, Pro, Thr and Leu. OsAAP4 RNA interference (RNAi) and mutant lines displayed opposite trends compared with overexpresing (OE) lines. In addition, exogenous Val or Pro at 0.5 mM significantly promoted the bud outgrowth of lines overexpressing an OsAAP4a splicing variant compared with ZH11, and exogenous Val or Pro at 2.0 mM significantly enhanced the bud outgrowth of lines overexpressing splicing variant OsAAP4b compared with ZH11. Of note, the results of a protoplast amino acid-uptake assay showed that Val or Pro at different concentrations was specifically transported and accumulated in these overexpressing lines. Transcriptome analysis further demonstrated that OsAAP4 may affect nitrogen transport and metabolism, and auxin, cytokinin signaling in regulating rice tillering.  Conclusion: Our results suggested that OsAAP4 contributes to rice tiller and grain yield by regulating neutral amino acid allocation through two different splicing variants and that OsAAP4 might have potential applications in rice breeding.
NA	Overexpression of OsERF83, a Vascular Tissue-Specific Transcription Factor Gene, Confers Drought Tolerance in Rice	2021	Int J Mol Sci	Crop Biotechnology Institute, GreenBio Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Pyeongchang 25354, Korea.	Abiotic stresses severely affect plant growth and productivity. To cope with abiotic stresses, plants have evolved tolerance mechanisms that are tightly regulated by reprogramming transcription factors (TFs). APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF) transcription factors are known to play an important role in various abiotic stresses. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms remains incomplete. In this study, we identified the role of OsERF83, a member of the AP2/ERF transcription factor family, in response to drought stress. OsERF83 is a transcription factor localized to the nucleus and induced in response to various abiotic stresses, such as drought and abscisic acid (ABA). Overexpression of OsERF83 in transgenic plants (OsERF83OX) significantly increased drought tolerance, with higher photochemical efficiency in rice. OsERF83OX was also associated with growth retardation, with reduced grain yields under normal growth conditions. OsERF83 is predominantly expressed in the vascular tissue of all organs. Transcriptome analysis revealed that OsERF83 regulates drought response genes, which are related to the transporter (OsNPF8.10, OsNPF8.17, OsLH1), lignin biosynthesis (OsLAC17, OsLAC10, CAD8D), terpenoid synthesis (OsTPS33, OsTPS14, OsTPS3), cytochrome P450 family (Oscyp71Z4, CYP76M10), and abiotic stress-related genes (OsSAP, OsLEA14, PCC13-62). OsERF83 also up-regulates biotic stress-associated genes, including PATHOGENESIS-RELATED PROTEIN (PR), WALL-ASSOCIATED KINASE (WAK), CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE PROTEIN E1 (CslE1), and LYSM RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (RLK) genes. Our results provide new insight into the multiple roles of OsERF83 in the cross-talk between abiotic and biotic stress signaling pathways.
NA	Knockout of amino acid transporter gene OsLHT1 accelerates leaf senescence and enhances resistance to rice blast fungus.	2023	J Exp Bot	College of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, China.	Plant amino acid transporters (AATs) regulate not only long-distance transport and reallocation of nitrogen (N) from source to sink organs, but also amount of amino acids in leaves hijacked by invaded pathogens. However, the function of AATs in plant defense responses to pathogen infection remains unknown. In this study, we found that rice amino acid transporter gene OsLHT1 was expressed in leaves and up-regulated by maturing, N starvation and inoculation of blast fungus and N supply-dependent premature senescence of leaves at vegetative growth stage. In comparison to wild type, Oslht1 mutant lines showed sustained rusty red spots on fully mature leaf blades irrespective of N supply levels. Notably, no relationship between the severity of leaf rusty red spots and concentration of total N or amino acids was found in Oslht1 mutants at different developmental stages. Disruption of OsLHT1 altered transport and metabolism of amino acids and and salicylic acid-related defense genes and production of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid, accumulation of reactive oxygen species. OsLHT1 inactivation dramatically prevented the leaf invasion of M. oryzae, the hemi-biotrophic ascomycete fungus. Overall, these results establish a module connecting the activity of amino acid transporter with leaf metabolism and defense to rice blast fungus.
