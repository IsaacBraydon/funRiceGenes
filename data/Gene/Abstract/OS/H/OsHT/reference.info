The cDNA is 1.3 kb in length and the open reading frame encodes for a 441 amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 49 kDa. Multiple sequence alignments showed that OsHT shares a high degree of sequence conservation at the deduced amino acid level with the Arabidopsis LHT1 and six putative lysine and histidine transporters. Computational analysis indicated that OsHT is an integral membrane protein with 11 putative transmembrane helices. This was confirmed by the transient expression assay because the OsHT-GFP fusion protein was, indeed, localized mainly in the plasma membrane of onion epidermal cells. Functional complementation experiments demonstrated that OsHT was able to work as a histidine transporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that OsHT is a gene that encodes for a histidine transporter from rice. This is the first time that an LHT-type amino acid transporter gene has been cloned from higher plants other than Arabidopsis.
NA	Disruption of an amino acid transporter LHT1 leads to growth inhibition and low yields in rice.	2019	BMC Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530005, China.	Research on plant amino acid transporters was mainly performed in Arabidopsis, while our understanding of them is generally scant in rice. OsLHT1 (Lysine/Histidine transporter) has been previously reported as a histidine transporter in yeast, but its substrate profile and function in planta are unclear. The aims of this study are to analyze the substrate selectivity of OsLHT1 and influence of its disruption on rice growth and fecundity.Substrate selectivity of OsLHT1 was analyzed in Xenopus oocytes using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. The results showed that OsLHT1 could transport a broad spectrum of amino acids, including basic, neutral and acidic amino acids, and exhibited a preference for neutral and acidic amino acids. Two oslht1 mutants were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology, and the loss-of-function of OsLHT1 inhibited rice root and shoot growth, thereby markedly reducing grain yields. QRT-PCR analysis indicated that OsLHT1 was expressed in various rice organs, including root, stem, flag leaf, flag leaf sheath and young panicle. Transient expression in rice protoplast suggested OsLHT1 was localized to the plasma membrane, which is consistent with its function as an amino acid transporter.Our results indicated that OsLHT1 is an amino acid transporter with wide substrate specificity and with preference for neutral and acidic amino acids, and disruption of OsLHT1 function markedly inhibited rice growth and fecundity.
NA	Oryza sativa Lysine-Histidine-type Transporter 1 functions in root uptake and root-to-shoot allocation of amino acids in rice.	2020	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Lower-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	In agricultural soils, amino acids can represent vital nitrogen (N) sources for crop growth and yield. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying amino acid uptake and allocation are poorly understood in crop plants. This study shows that rice (Oryza sativa L.) roots can acquire aspartate at soil concentration, and that japonica subspecies take up this acidic amino acid 1.5-fold more efficiently than indica subspecies. Genetic association analyses with 68 representative japonica or indica germplasms identified rice Lysine-Histidine-type Transporter 1 (OsLHT1) as a candidate gene associated with the aspartate uptake trait. When expressed in yeast, OsLHT1 supported cell growth on a broad spectrum of amino acids and effectively transported aspartate, asparagine and glutamate. OsLHT1 is localized throughout the rice root, including root hairs, epidermis, cortex and stele, and to the leaf vasculature. Knockout of OsLHT1 in japonica resulted in reduced root uptake of amino acids. Furthermore, in 15 N-amino acid-fed mutants versus wild-type, a higher percentage of 15 N remained in roots instead of being allocated to the shoot. 15 N-ammonium uptake and subsequently the delivery of root synthesized amino acids to Oslht1 shoots were also significantly decreased, which was accompanied by reduced shoot growth. These results together provide evidence that OsLHT1 functions in both root uptake and root to shoot allocation of a broad spectrum of amino acids in rice.
