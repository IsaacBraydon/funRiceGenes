OsHIPP17	growth	Metallochaperone protein OsHIPP17 regulates the absorption and translocation of cadmium in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Nevertheless, the overexpression of OsHIPP17 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in compromised growth under Cd stress
OsHIPP17	resistance	Metallochaperone protein OsHIPP17 regulates the absorption and translocation of cadmium in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 All above results implied that OsHIPP17 may affect Cd resistance by regulating the absorption and translocation of Cd in rice
OsHIPP17	stress	Metallochaperone protein OsHIPP17 regulates the absorption and translocation of cadmium in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Nevertheless, the overexpression of OsHIPP17 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in compromised growth under Cd stress
OsHIPP17	tolerance	Metallochaperone protein OsHIPP17 regulates the absorption and translocation of cadmium in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 In this study, a novel HIPP member OsHIPP17 was functionally characterized, which was involved in the tolerance of yeast and plants to cadmium (Cd)
OsHIPP17	tolerance	Metallochaperone protein OsHIPP17 regulates the absorption and translocation of cadmium in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Further analysis of their functions revealed that OsHIPP24 or OsLOL3 may be involved in the regulation of Cd tolerance by OsHIPP17 in rice
OsHIPP17	cadmium	Metallochaperone protein OsHIPP17 regulates the absorption and translocation of cadmium in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	Metallochaperone protein OsHIPP17 regulates the absorption and translocation of cadmium in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
OsHIPP17	cadmium	Metallochaperone protein OsHIPP17 regulates the absorption and translocation of cadmium in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 In this study, a novel HIPP member OsHIPP17 was functionally characterized, which was involved in the tolerance of yeast and plants to cadmium (Cd)
