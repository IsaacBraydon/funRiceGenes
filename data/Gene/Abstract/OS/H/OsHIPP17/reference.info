NA	Metallochaperone protein OsHIPP17 regulates the absorption and translocation of cadmium in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2023	Int J Biol Macromol	College of Ecology and Environment, Chengdu University of Technology, Sichuan 610059, China.	Heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant proteins (HIPPs) play vital roles in regulating heavy metal responding activities in plants. Yet only a handful of studies have characterized the functions of HIPPs. In this study, a novel HIPP member OsHIPP17 was functionally characterized, which was involved in the tolerance of yeast and plants to cadmium (Cd). The Cd accumulation in yeast cells was increased due to the overexpression of OsHIPP17. Nevertheless, the overexpression of OsHIPP17 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in compromised growth under Cd stress. Meanwhile, the mutation of OsHIPP17 resulted in 38.9-40.9 % increase of Cd concentration in rice roots as well as 14.3-20.0 % decrease of Cd translocation factor. Further investigation of the genes responsible for Cd absorption and transporter indicated that the expression levels of these genes were also perturbed. In addition, two OsHIPP17-interacting proteins, OsHIPP24 and OsLOL3 were identified in a yeast two hybrid assay. Further analysis of their functions revealed that OsHIPP24 or OsLOL3 may be involved in the regulation of Cd tolerance by OsHIPP17 in rice. All above results implied that OsHIPP17 may affect Cd resistance by regulating the absorption and translocation of Cd in rice.
