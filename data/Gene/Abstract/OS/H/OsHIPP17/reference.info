NA	Metallochaperone protein OsHIPP17 regulates the absorption and translocation of cadmium in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2023	Int J Biol Macromol	College of Ecology and Environment, Chengdu University of Technology, Sichuan 610059, China.	Heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant proteins (HIPPs) play vital roles in regulating heavy metal responding activities in plants. Yet only a handful of studies have characterized the functions of HIPPs. In this study, a novel HIPP member OsHIPP17 was functionally characterized, which was involved in the tolerance of yeast and plants to cadmium (Cd). The Cd accumulation in yeast cells was increased due to the overexpression of OsHIPP17. Nevertheless, the overexpression of OsHIPP17 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in compromised growth under Cd stress. Meanwhile, the mutation of OsHIPP17 resulted in 38.9-40.9 % increase of Cd concentration in rice roots as well as 14.3-20.0 % decrease of Cd translocation factor. Further investigation of the genes responsible for Cd absorption and transporter indicated that the expression levels of these genes were also perturbed. In addition, two OsHIPP17-interacting proteins, OsHIPP24 and OsLOL3 were identified in a yeast two hybrid assay. Further analysis of their functions revealed that OsHIPP24 or OsLOL3 may be involved in the regulation of Cd tolerance by OsHIPP17 in rice. All above results implied that OsHIPP17 may affect Cd resistance by regulating the absorption and translocation of Cd in rice.
NA	OsHIPP17 is involved in regulating the tolerance of rice to copper stress.	2023	Front Plant Sci	College of Ecology and Environment, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.	INTRODUCTION: Heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant proteins (HIPPs) play vital roles in metal absorption, transport and accumulation in plants. However, so far, only several plant HIPPs have been functionally analyzed. In this study, a novel HIPP member OsHIPP17, which was involved in the tolerance to copper (Cu) was functionally characterized. METHODS: In this study, qRT-PCR, Yeast transgenic technology, Plant transgenic technology, ICP-MS and so on were used for research. RESULTS: OsHIPP17 protein was targeted to the nucleus. The Cu concentration reached 0.45 mg/g dry weight due to the overexpression of OsHIPP17 in yeast cells. Meanwhile, the overexpression of OsHIPP17 resulted in the compromised growth of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) under Cu stress. The root length of 24.36% under 25 mM Cu stress. The roots of Oshipp17 rice mutant showed increased Cu concentration by 7.25%-23.32%. Meanwhile, knockout of OsHIPP17 decreased the expression levels of OsATX1, OsZIP1, OsCOPT5 or OsHMA5, and increased the expression levels of OsCOPT1 or OsHMA4. Antioxidant enzyme activity was also reduced in rice due to the knockout of OsHIPP17. Moreover, the expression levels of cytokinin-related genes in plants under Cu stress were also affected by overexpression or knockout of OsHIPP17. DISCUSSION: These results implied that OsHIPP17 might play a role in plant Cu toxic response by affecting the expression of Cu transport genes or cytokinin-related genes. Simultaneously, our work may shed light on the underlying mechanism of how heavy metals affect the plant growth and provide a novel rice genetic source for phytoremediation of heavy metal-contaminated soil.
