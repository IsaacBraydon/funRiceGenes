OsHIPP17	 The Cd accumulation in yeast cells was increased due to the overexpression of OsHIPP17 |  Nevertheless, the overexpression of OsHIPP17 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in compromised growth under Cd stress	 The Cd accumulation in yeast cells was increased due to the overexpression of OsHIPP17 |  Nevertheless, the overexpression of OsHIPP17 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in compromised growth under Cd stress
OsHIPP17	45 mg/g dry weight due to the overexpression of OsHIPP17 in yeast cells |  Meanwhile, the overexpression of OsHIPP17 resulted in the compromised growth of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) under Cu stress |  Meanwhile, knockout of OsHIPP17 decreased the expression levels of OsATX1, OsZIP1, OsCOPT5 or OsHMA5, and increased the expression levels of OsCOPT1 or OsHMA4 |  Moreover, the expression levels of cytokinin-related genes in plants under Cu stress were also affected by overexpression or knockout of OsHIPP17 |  DISCUSSION: These results implied that OsHIPP17 might play a role in plant Cu toxic response by affecting the expression of Cu transport genes or cytokinin-related genes	45 mg/g dry weight due to the overexpression of OsHIPP17 in yeast cells |  Meanwhile, the overexpression of OsHIPP17 resulted in the compromised growth of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) under Cu stress |  Moreover, the expression levels of cytokinin-related genes in plants under Cu stress were also affected by overexpression or knockout of OsHIPP17
