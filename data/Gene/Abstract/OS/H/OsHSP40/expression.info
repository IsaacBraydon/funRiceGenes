LM7|OsHSP40|NAL11	 A promising rare allele of NAL11 (NAL11(-923del-1552) ) positively selected in Aus cultivars was identified; this allele exhibited increased expression and generated relatively few tillers, thick stems, and large panicles, components of the ideal plant architecture (IPA) |  Biochemical analyses show that IPA1 directly binds to elements in the missing fragment of the NAL11(-923del-1552) promoter and negatively regulates NAL11 expression
