LM7|OsHSP40|NAL11	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	The DnaJ domain-containing heat-shock protein NAL11 determines plant architecture by mediating gibberellin homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa).	 Biochemical analyses show that IPA1 directly binds to elements in the missing fragment of the NAL11(-923del-1552) promoter and negatively regulates NAL11 expression
LM7|OsHSP40|NAL11	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	The DnaJ domain-containing heat-shock protein NAL11 determines plant architecture by mediating gibberellin homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa).	 Genetic analyses support the hypothesis that NAL11 acts downstream of IPA1 to regulate IPA by modulating GA homeostasis, and NAL11 may be an essential complement for IPA1
