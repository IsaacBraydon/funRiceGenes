OsHSP40	leaf	Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice.	Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice.
OsHSP40	leaf	Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice.	 Disruption of this gene in Oshsp40 mutants significantly reduced the leaf size compared with that of WT in rice
OsHSP40	leaf	Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice.	 Microscopic examination showed that OsHSP40 modulated leaf size via regulating the veins formation and cell size/cell number
OsHSP40	leaf	Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice.	 Therefore, the natural variation of OsHSP40 contributing to leaf size might be useful for rice breeding
OsHSP40	breeding	Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice.	 Therefore, the natural variation of OsHSP40 contributing to leaf size might be useful for rice breeding
OsHSP40	small leaves	Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice.	 Nucleotide diversity analysis indicated that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation of C to T in the coding region of OsHSP40 may cause small leaves among rice accessions
