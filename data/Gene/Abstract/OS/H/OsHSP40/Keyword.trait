LM7|OsHSP40	leaf	Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice.	Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice.
LM7|OsHSP40	leaf	Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice.	 Disruption of this gene in Oshsp40 mutants significantly reduced the leaf size compared with that of WT in rice
LM7|OsHSP40	leaf	Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice.	 Microscopic examination showed that OsHSP40 modulated leaf size via regulating the veins formation and cell size/cell number
LM7|OsHSP40	leaf	Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice.	 Therefore, the natural variation of OsHSP40 contributing to leaf size might be useful for rice breeding
LM7|OsHSP40	breeding	Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice.	 Therefore, the natural variation of OsHSP40 contributing to leaf size might be useful for rice breeding
LM7|OsHSP40	small leaves	Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice.	 Nucleotide diversity analysis indicated that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation of C to T in the coding region of OsHSP40 may cause small leaves among rice accessions
LM7|OsHSP40	leaf size	Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice	Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice
