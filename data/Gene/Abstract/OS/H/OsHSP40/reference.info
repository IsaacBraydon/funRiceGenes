NA	Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	Institute of Cereal Crop, Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Zhengzhou 450002, China.	Leaf size is an important agronomic trait directly affecting yield in rice, and thus understanding the genes determining leaf size is important in breeding. In this study, one Leaf Mutant 7 (lm7) with small leaf size was isolated using ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS) mutagenesis from the japonica Zhenggeng 1925. MutMap by whole genome resequencing of phenotypic bulks revealed that LM7 is likely located in the 133 kb region on chromosome 7 using F(2) population from a cross between lm7 and wild-type (WT) Zhenggeng 1925. The candidate gene encoding heat shock protein OsHSP40 for LM7 was functionally validated. Disruption of this gene in Oshsp40 mutants significantly reduced the leaf size compared with that of WT in rice. Microscopic examination showed that OsHSP40 modulated leaf size via regulating the veins formation and cell size/cell number. Nucleotide diversity analysis indicated that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation of C to T in the coding region of OsHSP40 may cause small leaves among rice accessions. Therefore, the natural variation of OsHSP40 contributing to leaf size might be useful for rice breeding.
