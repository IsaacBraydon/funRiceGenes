NA	Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	Institute of Cereal Crop, Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Zhengzhou 450002, China.	Leaf size is an important agronomic trait directly affecting yield in rice, and thus understanding the genes determining leaf size is important in breeding. In this study, one Leaf Mutant 7 (lm7) with small leaf size was isolated using ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS) mutagenesis from the japonica Zhenggeng 1925. MutMap by whole genome resequencing of phenotypic bulks revealed that LM7 is likely located in the 133 kb region on chromosome 7 using F(2) population from a cross between lm7 and wild-type (WT) Zhenggeng 1925. The candidate gene encoding heat shock protein OsHSP40 for LM7 was functionally validated. Disruption of this gene in Oshsp40 mutants significantly reduced the leaf size compared with that of WT in rice. Microscopic examination showed that OsHSP40 modulated leaf size via regulating the veins formation and cell size/cell number. Nucleotide diversity analysis indicated that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation of C to T in the coding region of OsHSP40 may cause small leaves among rice accessions. Therefore, the natural variation of OsHSP40 contributing to leaf size might be useful for rice breeding.
NA	The DnaJ domain-containing heat-shock protein NAL11 determines plant architecture by mediating gibberellin homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa).	2023	New Phytol	National Engineering Research Center of Plant Space Breeding, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1) is a key regulator of plant architecture. However, knowledge of downstream genes applicable for improving rice plant architecture is very limited. We identified the plant architecture regulatory gene NARROW LEAF 11 (NAL11), which encodes a heat-shock protein (HSP) containing a DnaJ domain. A promising rare allele of NAL11 (NAL11(-923del-1552) ) positively selected in Aus cultivars was identified; this allele exhibited increased expression and generated relatively few tillers, thick stems, and large panicles, components of the ideal plant architecture (IPA). NAL11 is involved in regulating the cell cycle and cell proliferation. NAL11 loss-of-function mutants present impaired chloroplast development and gibberellin (GA) defects. Biochemical analyses show that IPA1 directly binds to elements in the missing fragment of the NAL11(-923del-1552) promoter and negatively regulates NAL11 expression. Genetic analyses support the hypothesis that NAL11 acts downstream of IPA1 to regulate IPA by modulating GA homeostasis, and NAL11 may be an essential complement for IPA1. Our work revealed that avoidance of the inhibition of NAL11(-923del-1552) caused by IPA1 represents a positive strategy for rescuing GA defects accompanied by the upregulation of IPA1 in breeding high-yield rice.
