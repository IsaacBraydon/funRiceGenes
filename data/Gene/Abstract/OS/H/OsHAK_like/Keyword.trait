OsHAK_like	growth	Functional genomic analysis of K(+) related salt-responsive transporters in tolerant and sensitive genotypes of rice.	 DISCUSSION: The poor performance of the transgenic plants with the down-regulated genes OsTPKa and OsHAK_like under salt stress supports the assumption that OsTPKa and OsHAK_like play important roles in defending the rice landrace Horkuch against salt stress, minimizing salt injury, and maintaining plant growth
OsHAK_like	stress	Functional genomic analysis of K(+) related salt-responsive transporters in tolerant and sensitive genotypes of rice.	 DISCUSSION: The poor performance of the transgenic plants with the down-regulated genes OsTPKa and OsHAK_like under salt stress supports the assumption that OsTPKa and OsHAK_like play important roles in defending the rice landrace Horkuch against salt stress, minimizing salt injury, and maintaining plant growth
