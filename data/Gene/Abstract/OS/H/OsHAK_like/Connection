OsHAK_like	OsTPKa	Functional genomic analysis of K(+) related salt-responsive transporters in tolerant and sensitive genotypes of rice.	 These are OsTPKa or Vacuolar two-pore potassium channel and OsHAK_like or a hypothetical protein of the HAK family
OsHAK_like	OsTPKa	Functional genomic analysis of K(+) related salt-responsive transporters in tolerant and sensitive genotypes of rice.	 For further insight, OsTPKa and OsHAK_like were chosen for loss-of-function genomic analysis in Horkuch using the CRISPR/Cas9 tool
OsHAK_like	OsTPKa	Functional genomic analysis of K(+) related salt-responsive transporters in tolerant and sensitive genotypes of rice.	 RESULTS: The promoter sequences of the OsTPKa and OsHAK_like genes showed some significant differences in promoter sequences which may give a survival advantage to Horkuch under salt-stress
OsHAK_like	OsTPKa	Functional genomic analysis of K(+) related salt-responsive transporters in tolerant and sensitive genotypes of rice.	 DISCUSSION: The poor performance of the transgenic plants with the down-regulated genes OsTPKa and OsHAK_like under salt stress supports the assumption that OsTPKa and OsHAK_like play important roles in defending the rice landrace Horkuch against salt stress, minimizing salt injury, and maintaining plant growth
