OsHGGT|HGGT|SGD1|RTD1	seed	Metabolic redesign of vitamin E biosynthesis in plants for tocotrienol production and increased antioxidant content	cDNAs encoding homogentisic acid geranylgeranyl transferase (HGGT), which catalyzes the committed step of tocotrienol biosynthesis, were isolated from barley, wheat and rice seeds
OsHGGT|HGGT|SGD1|RTD1	seed	Metabolic redesign of vitamin E biosynthesis in plants for tocotrienol production and increased antioxidant content	Overexpression of the barley HGGT in corn seeds resulted in an increase in tocotrienol and tocopherol content of as much as six-fold
OsHGGT|HGGT|SGD1|RTD1	development	SGD1, a key enzyme in tocopherol biosynthesis, is essential for plant development and cold tolerance in rice.	 Our results indicate that SGD1 is essential for plant development and cold tolerance in rice
OsHGGT|HGGT|SGD1|RTD1	map-based cloning	SGD1, a key enzyme in tocopherol biosynthesis, is essential for plant development and cold tolerance in rice.	 A map-based cloning strategy and subsequent complementation test showed that SGD1 encodes homogentisate phytyltransferase (HPT), a key enzyme in tocopherol biosynthesis
OsHGGT|HGGT|SGD1|RTD1	tolerance	SGD1, a key enzyme in tocopherol biosynthesis, is essential for plant development and cold tolerance in rice.	 Our results indicate that SGD1 is essential for plant development and cold tolerance in rice
OsHGGT|HGGT|SGD1|RTD1	cold tolerance	SGD1, a key enzyme in tocopherol biosynthesis, is essential for plant development and cold tolerance in rice.	 Our results indicate that SGD1 is essential for plant development and cold tolerance in rice
OsHGGT|HGGT|SGD1|RTD1	plant development	SGD1, a key enzyme in tocopherol biosynthesis, is essential for plant development and cold tolerance in rice.	 Our results indicate that SGD1 is essential for plant development and cold tolerance in rice
