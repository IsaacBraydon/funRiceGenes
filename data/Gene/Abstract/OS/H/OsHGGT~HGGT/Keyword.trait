OsHGGT|HGGT	seed	Metabolic redesign of vitamin E biosynthesis in plants for tocotrienol production and increased antioxidant content	 cDNAs encoding homogentisic acid geranylgeranyl transferase (HGGT), which catalyzes the committed step of tocotrienol biosynthesis, were isolated from barley, wheat and rice seeds
OsHGGT|HGGT	seed	Metabolic redesign of vitamin E biosynthesis in plants for tocotrienol production and increased antioxidant content	 Overexpression of the barley HGGT in corn seeds resulted in an increase in tocotrienol and tocopherol content of as much as six-fold
