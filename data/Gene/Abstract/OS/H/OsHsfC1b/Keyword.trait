OsHsfC1b	homeostasis	Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica	Impaired function of OsHsfC1b in the hsfc1b mutant and the amiRNA lines led to decreased salt and osmotic stress tolerance, increased sensitivity to ABA, and temporal misregulation of salt-responsive genes involved in signalling and ion homeostasis
OsHsfC1b	salt stress	Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica	 METHODOLOGY: We analysed the expression of OsHsfC1b in the rice japonica cultivars Dongjin and Nipponbare exposed to salt stress as well as after mannitol, abscisic acid (ABA) and H(2)O(2) treatment
OsHsfC1b	salt stress	Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica	CONCLUSIONS: OsHsfC1b plays a role in ABA-mediated salt stress tolerance in rice
OsHsfC1b	transcription factor	Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica	Here we characterized the function of the OsHsfC1b (Os01g53220) transcription factor from rice
OsHsfC1b	transcription factor	Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica	Transient expression of OsHsfC1b fused to GFP in protoplasts revealed nuclear localization of the transcription factor
OsHsfC1b	transcription factor	Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica	Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica
OsHsfC1b	 ABA 	Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica	For functional characterization of OsHsfC1b, we analysed the physiological response of a T-DNA insertion line (hsfc1b) and two artificial micro-RNA (amiRNA) knock-down lines to salt, mannitol and ABA treatment
OsHsfC1b	growth	Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica	Furthermore, OsHsfC1b is involved in the response to osmotic stress and is required for plant growth under non-stress conditions
OsHsfC1b	salt	Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica	 METHODOLOGY: We analysed the expression of OsHsfC1b in the rice japonica cultivars Dongjin and Nipponbare exposed to salt stress as well as after mannitol, abscisic acid (ABA) and H(2)O(2) treatment
OsHsfC1b	salt	Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica	For functional characterization of OsHsfC1b, we analysed the physiological response of a T-DNA insertion line (hsfc1b) and two artificial micro-RNA (amiRNA) knock-down lines to salt, mannitol and ABA treatment
OsHsfC1b	salt	Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica	PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Expression of OsHsfC1b was induced by salt, mannitol and ABA, but not by H(2)O(2)
OsHsfC1b	salt	Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica	Impaired function of OsHsfC1b in the hsfc1b mutant and the amiRNA lines led to decreased salt and osmotic stress tolerance, increased sensitivity to ABA, and temporal misregulation of salt-responsive genes involved in signalling and ion homeostasis
