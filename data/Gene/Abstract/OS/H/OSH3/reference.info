111651.pdf	Regional expression of the rice KN1-type homeobox gene family during embryo, shoot, and flower development	1999	Plant Cell	Nagoya University, BioScience Center, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	We report the isolation, sequence, and pattern of gene expression of members of the KNOTTED1 (KN1)-type class 1 homeobox gene family from rice. Phylogenetic analysis and mapping of the rice genome revealed that all of the rice homeobox genes that we have isolated have one or two direct homologs in maize. Of the homeobox genes that we tested, all exhibited expression in a restricted region of the embryo that defines the position at which the shoot apical meristem (SAM) would eventually develop, prior to visible organ formation. Several distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns were observed for the different genes in this region. After shoot formation, the expression patterns of these homeobox genes were variable in the region of the SAM. These results suggest that the rice KN1-type class 1 homeobox genes function cooperatively to establish the SAM before shoot formation and that after shoot formation, their functions differ.
76_381.pdf	Mutations that cause amino acid substitutions at the invariant positions in homeodomain of OSH3 KNOX protein suggest artificial selection during rice domestication	2001	Genes Genet Syst	University of California, Berkeley, USDA/ARS-Plant Gene Expression Center	KNOX homeodomain (HD) proteins encoded by KNOTTED1-like homeobox genes (KNOX genes) are considered to work as important regulators for plant developmental and morphogenetic events. We found that OSH3, one of the KNOX genes isolated from a cultivar of Oryza sativa (Nipponbare), encodes a novel HD, which has two amino acid substitutions at invariant positions. Sequence analysis of OSH3 from various domesticated and wild species of rice has revealed that these substitutions are distributed only in Japonica and Javanica type of O. sativa, two groups of domesticated rice in Asia. Surprisingly, nucleotide sequences in the first intron are almost conserved in the rice strains that have the substitutions at the invariant amino acids. Overexpression studies revealed that these invariant amino acids are critical for the function of OSH3 in vivo. The facts that these substitutions occurred specifically at the functionally important amino acids and the sequences are conserved in intron where neutral mutations accumulate suggest the substitutions at the invariant positions of OSH3 have been fixed by artificial selections during domestication. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that OSH3 is responsible for one of the traits that are selectively introduced during the domestication of most of Japonica and a part of Javanica type of rice.
Plant Cell Physiol-2002-Sato-44-51.pdf	A Loss-of-Function Mutation in the Rice KNOX Type Homeobox Gene, OSH3	2002	Plant and Cell Physiology	BioScience Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya, 464-8601 Japan	KNOX homeodomain (HD) proteins encoded by KNOTTED1-like homeobox genes (KNOX genes) are thought to work as switches for cells to change from an indeterminate to a determinate state, although their direct functions are not clear. In the process of isolating KNOX genes from rice, we found that one gene, named OSH3, has two amino acid substitutions in three of the invariant amino acid residues in the HD of KNOX proteins. These amino acid substitutions are not universal in rice: two of the cultivars from the Indica variety of rice do not carry those substitutions but two of the cultivars from Japonica variety do. We tested the effect of these amino acid substitutions on their ability to form dimers and to induce abnormal morophologies when overexpressed in transgenic plants. We found that OSH3 without those substitutions can form dimers and can induce an abnormal phenotype in overexpression studies, and that OSH3 with those amino acid substitutions is defective in both. Based on these observations, we concluded that OSH3 from two of the cultivars from the Japonica variety could have lost its original function, or could have acquired a novel function by modifying the action of HD, or both.
