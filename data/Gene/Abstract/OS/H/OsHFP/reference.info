Proteins containing hemopexin fold domain are suggested to have diverse functions in various living organisms. In order to investigate the structure and function of this type of protein in rice plant (Oryza sativa), the gene encoding a hemopexin fold protein (OsHFP) was cloned, analyzed in silico and characterized. Molecular modeling revealed that the OsHFP is closely related to other hemopexin fold proteins, but is unique with a cylindrical central tunnel as well as extended N- and C-terminal domains. The recombinant OsHFP was found to bind hemin, the oxidized form of heme in vitro. The expression of the single copy OsHFP gene was detected in rice flower buds. Heterologous expression of OsHFP in green leaf tissues resulted in chlorophyll degradation; however, stable expression of OsHFP was observed in transgenic hairy roots, a non-green tissue. The possible role of OsHFP in regulating programmed cell death in anther green tissues of rice is proposed.
