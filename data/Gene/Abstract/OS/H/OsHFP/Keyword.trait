OsHFP	cell death	A structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice plays role in chlorophyll degradation	The possible role of OsHFP in regulating programmed cell death in anther green tissues of rice is proposed
OsHFP	root	A structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice plays role in chlorophyll degradation	Heterologous expression of OsHFP in green leaf tissues resulted in chlorophyll degradation; however, stable expression of OsHFP was observed in transgenic hairy roots, a non-green tissue
OsHFP	leaf	A structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice plays role in chlorophyll degradation	Heterologous expression of OsHFP in green leaf tissues resulted in chlorophyll degradation; however, stable expression of OsHFP was observed in transgenic hairy roots, a non-green tissue
OsHFP	flower	A structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice plays role in chlorophyll degradation	The expression of the single copy OsHFP gene was detected in rice flower buds
OsHFP	anther	A structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice plays role in chlorophyll degradation	The possible role of OsHFP in regulating programmed cell death in anther green tissues of rice is proposed
