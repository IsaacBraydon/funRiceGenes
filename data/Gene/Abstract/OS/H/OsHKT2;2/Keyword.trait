OsHKT2;2	potassium	Differential sodium and potassium transport selectivities of the rice OsHKT2;1 and OsHKT2;2 transporters in plant cells	Differential sodium and potassium transport selectivities of the rice OsHKT2;1 and OsHKT2;2 transporters in plant cells
OsHKT2;2	transporter	Differential sodium and potassium transport selectivities of the rice OsHKT2;1 and OsHKT2;2 transporters in plant cells	 Therefore, here we analyze two highly homologous rice (Oryza sativa) HKT transporters in plant cells, OsHKT2;1 and OsHKT2;2, that show differential K(+) permeabilities in heterologous systems|Differential sodium and potassium transport selectivities of the rice OsHKT2;1 and OsHKT2;2 transporters in plant cells
OsHKT2;2	salt tolerance	"HKT2;2/1, a K(+)-permeable transporter identified in a salt-tolerant rice cultivar through surveys of natural genetic polymorphism"	 Our results suggest that No-OsHKT2;2/1 can contribute to Nona Bokra salt tolerance by enabling root K(+) uptake under saline conditions
OsHKT2;2	salt	"HKT2;2/1, a K(+)-permeable transporter identified in a salt-tolerant rice cultivar through surveys of natural genetic polymorphism"	" Our study, however, also identified a new HKT isoform, No-OsHKT2;2/1 in Nona Bokra, a highly salt-tolerant cultivar| Its 5' region corresponds to that of OsHKT2;2, whose full-length sequence is not present in Nipponbare but has been identified in Pokkali, a salt-tolerant rice cultivar| Our results suggest that No-OsHKT2;2/1 can contribute to Nona Bokra salt tolerance by enabling root K(+) uptake under saline conditions"
OsHKT2;2	root	HKT2;2/1, a K(+)-permeable transporter identified in a salt-tolerant rice cultivar through surveys of natural genetic polymorphism	 No-OsHKT2;2/1 is essentially expressed in roots and displays a significant level of expression at high Na(+) concentrations, in contrast to OsHKT2;1| Our results suggest that No-OsHKT2;2/1 can contribute to Nona Bokra salt tolerance by enabling root K(+) uptake under saline conditions
