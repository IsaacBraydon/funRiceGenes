OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	OsHKT2;2	HKT2;2/1, a K(+)-permeable transporter identified in a salt-tolerant rice cultivar through surveys of natural genetic polymorphism	No-OsHKT2;2/1 is essentially expressed in roots and displays a significant level of expression at high Na(+) concentrations, in contrast to OsHKT2;1
OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	OsHKT2;2	HKT2;2/1, a K(+)-permeable transporter identified in a salt-tolerant rice cultivar through surveys of natural genetic polymorphism	Expressed in Xenopus oocytes or in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, No-OsHKT2;2/1 exhibited a strong permeability to Na(+) and K(+), even at high external Na(+) concentrations, like OsHKT2;2, and in contrast to OsHKT2;1
OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	OsHKT2;2	Differential sodium and potassium transport selectivities of the rice OsHKT2;1 and OsHKT2;2 transporters in plant cells	Therefore, here we analyze two highly homologous rice (Oryza sativa) HKT transporters in plant cells, OsHKT2;1 and OsHKT2;2, that show differential K(+) permeabilities in heterologous systems
