OsHIRP1	drought	Oryza sativa heat-induced RING finger protein 1 (OsHIRP1) positively regulates plant response to heat stress.	 Transcription of the OsHIRP1 was upregulated in response to heat and drought treatment
OsHIRP1	stress	Oryza sativa heat-induced RING finger protein 1 (OsHIRP1) positively regulates plant response to heat stress.	OsHIRP1 is an E3 ligase that acts as a positive regulator in the plant response to heat stress, thus providing important information relating to adaptation and regulation under heat stress in plant
OsHIRP1	nucleus	Oryza sativa heat-induced RING finger protein 1 (OsHIRP1) positively regulates plant response to heat stress.	 Two interacting partners, OsARK4 and OsHRK1, were identified via yeast-two-hybrid screening, which were mainly targeted to the nucleus (OsARK4) and cytosol (OsHRK1), and their interactions with OsHIRP1 were confirmed by biomolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC)
