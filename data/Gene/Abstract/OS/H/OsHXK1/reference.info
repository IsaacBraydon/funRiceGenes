NA	OsAGO2 controls ROS production and the initiation of tapetal PCD by epigenetically regulating OsHXK1 expression in rice anthers.	2019	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, South China Agricultural University, 510642 Guangzhou, China.	Proteins of the ARGONAUTE (AGO) family function in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Although the rice (Oryza sativa) genome encodes 19 predicted AGO proteins, few of their functions have thus far been characterized. Here, we show that the AGO protein OsAGO2 regulates anther development in rice. OsAGO2 was highly expressed in anthers. Knockdown of OsAGO2 led to the overaccumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and abnormal anther development, causing premature initiation of tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) and pollen abortion. The expression level of Hexokinase 1 (OsHXK1) increased significantly, and the methylation levels of its promoter decreased, in plants with knocked-down OsAGO2 expression. Overexpression of OsHXK1 also resulted in the overaccumulation of ROS, premature initiation of PCD, and pollen abortion. Moreover, knockdown of OsHXK1 restored pollen fertility in OsAGO2 knockdown plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that OsAGO2 binds directly to the OsHXK1 promoter region, suggesting that OsHXK1 is a target gene of OsAGO2. These results indicate that OsHXK1 controls the appropriate production of ROS and the proper timing of tapetal PCD and is directly regulated by OsAGO2 through epigenetic regulation.
NA	Improving the Rice Photosynthetic Efficiency and Yield by Editing OsHXK1 via CRISPR/Cas9 System	2021	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important food crop species in China. Cultivating high-yielding rice varieties that have a high photosynthetic efficiency is an important goal of rice breeding in China. In recent years, due to the continual innovation of molecular breeding methods, many excellent genes have been applied in rice breeding, which is highly important for increasing rice yields. In this paper, the hexokinase gene OsHXK1 was knocked out via the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing method in the indica rice varieties Huanghuazhan, Meixiangzhan, and Wushansimiao, and OsHXK1-CRISPR/Cas9 lines were obtained. According to the results of a phenotypic analysis and agronomic trait statistics, the OsHXK1-CRISPR/Cas9 plants presented increased light saturation points, stomatal conductance, light tolerance, photosynthetic products, and rice yields. Moreover, transcriptome analysis showed that the expression of photosynthesis-related genes significantly increased. Taken together, our results revealed that knocking out OsHXK1 via the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing method could effectively lead to the cultivation of high-photosynthetic efficiency and high-yielding rice varieties. They also revealed the important roles of OsHXK1 in the regulation of rice yield and photosynthesis.
