OsHAK26	development	Function of Rice HAK Transporters in Pollen Development and Fertility.	 The results suggest that the role of OsHAK26 in maintaining pollen development and fertility may relate to its proper cargo sorting for construction of pollen walls, while the role of OsHAK1 and OsHAK5 in maintaining seed production likely relates to their transcellular K+ transport activity
OsHAK26	fertility	Function of Rice HAK Transporters in Pollen Development and Fertility.	 The results suggest that the role of OsHAK26 in maintaining pollen development and fertility may relate to its proper cargo sorting for construction of pollen walls, while the role of OsHAK1 and OsHAK5 in maintaining seed production likely relates to their transcellular K+ transport activity
OsHAK26	pollen	Function of Rice HAK Transporters in Pollen Development and Fertility.	 Knockout of either OsHAK26 or plasma membrane located H+-K+ symporter gene OsHAK1 or OsHAK5 in both Nipponbare and Dongjin cultivars caused distorted anthers, reduced number and germination rate of pollen grains
OsHAK26	pollen	Function of Rice HAK Transporters in Pollen Development and Fertility.	 The results suggest that the role of OsHAK26 in maintaining pollen development and fertility may relate to its proper cargo sorting for construction of pollen walls, while the role of OsHAK1 and OsHAK5 in maintaining seed production likely relates to their transcellular K+ transport activity
OsHAK26	seed	Function of Rice HAK Transporters in Pollen Development and Fertility.	 In this study, we report that OsHAK26 is preferentially expressed in anthers and seed husks and located in Golgi apparatus
OsHAK26	seed	Function of Rice HAK Transporters in Pollen Development and Fertility.	 The results suggest that the role of OsHAK26 in maintaining pollen development and fertility may relate to its proper cargo sorting for construction of pollen walls, while the role of OsHAK1 and OsHAK5 in maintaining seed production likely relates to their transcellular K+ transport activity
OsHAK26	plasma membrane	Function of Rice HAK Transporters in Pollen Development and Fertility.	 Knockout of either OsHAK26 or plasma membrane located H+-K+ symporter gene OsHAK1 or OsHAK5 in both Nipponbare and Dongjin cultivars caused distorted anthers, reduced number and germination rate of pollen grains
