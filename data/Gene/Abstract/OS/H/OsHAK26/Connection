OsHAK1	OsHAK26	Function of Rice HAK Transporters in Pollen Development and Fertility.	 Knockout of either OsHAK26 or plasma membrane located H+-K+ symporter gene OsHAK1 or OsHAK5 in both Nipponbare and Dongjin cultivars caused distorted anthers, reduced number and germination rate of pollen grains
OsHAK1	OsHAK26	Function of Rice HAK Transporters in Pollen Development and Fertility.	 Seed-setting rate assay by reciprocal cross-pollination between the mutants of oshak26, oshak1, oshak5 and their wild types confirmed that each HAK transporter is foremost for pollen viability, seed-setting and grain yield
OsHAK1	OsHAK26	Function of Rice HAK Transporters in Pollen Development and Fertility.	 Intriguingly, the pollens of oshak26 showed much thinner wall and were more vulnerable to desiccation than those of oshak1 or oshak5
OsHAK1	OsHAK26	Function of Rice HAK Transporters in Pollen Development and Fertility.	 The results suggest that the role of OsHAK26 in maintaining pollen development and fertility may relate to its proper cargo sorting for construction of pollen walls, while the role of OsHAK1 and OsHAK5 in maintaining seed production likely relates to their transcellular K+ transport activity
