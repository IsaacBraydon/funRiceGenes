OSH71|Oskn2	vegetative	Characterization of the KNOX class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 identified in a collection of cDNA libraries covering the early stages of rice embryogenesis	Whereas Oskn3 transformants showed the most pronounced phenotypic effects during vegetative development, Oskn2 transformants showed relatively mild alterations in the vegetative phase but a more severely affected flower morphology
OSH71|Oskn2	panicle	Developmental regulation and downstream effects of the knox class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 from rice	Ectopic expression of Oskn2 or Oskn3 induced similar defects in panicle branching
OSH71|Oskn2	flower	Characterization of the KNOX class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 identified in a collection of cDNA libraries covering the early stages of rice embryogenesis	Whereas Oskn3 transformants showed the most pronounced phenotypic effects during vegetative development, Oskn2 transformants showed relatively mild alterations in the vegetative phase but a more severely affected flower morphology
OSH71|Oskn2	shoot	KNOX homeobox genes are sufficient in maintaining cultured cells in an undifferentiated state in rice	We produced transgenic rice calli, which constitutively express each of four KNOX family class 1 homeobox genes of rice, OSH1, OSH16, OSH15, and OSH71, and found that constitutive and ectopic expression of such genes inhibits normal regeneration from transformed calli, which showed continuous growth around their shoot-regenerating stages
OSH71|Oskn2	branching	Developmental regulation and downstream effects of the knox class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 from rice	Ectopic expression of Oskn2 or Oskn3 induced similar defects in panicle branching
OSH71|Oskn2	growth	KNOX homeobox genes are sufficient in maintaining cultured cells in an undifferentiated state in rice	We produced transgenic rice calli, which constitutively express each of four KNOX family class 1 homeobox genes of rice, OSH1, OSH16, OSH15, and OSH71, and found that constitutive and ectopic expression of such genes inhibits normal regeneration from transformed calli, which showed continuous growth around their shoot-regenerating stages
