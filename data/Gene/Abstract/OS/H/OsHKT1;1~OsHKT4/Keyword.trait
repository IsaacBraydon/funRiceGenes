OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	salt stress	Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	" The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 might contribute to accumulation of Na+ in old leaves under salt stress"
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	transporter	Sodium transport and HKT transporters: the rice model	 Yeast expressions of OsHKT1 and OsHKT4 proved that they are Na+ transporters of high and low affinity, respectively, which are sensitive to K+ and Ba2+
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	root	Sodium transport and HKT transporters: the rice model	 In roots, the expressions were much lower than in shoots, except for OsHKT4 and OsHKT1 in K+-starved plants
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	shoot	Sodium transport and HKT transporters: the rice model	 In roots, the expressions were much lower than in shoots, except for OsHKT4 and OsHKT1 in K+-starved plants
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	salt	Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	" The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 might contribute to accumulation of Na+ in old leaves under salt stress"
