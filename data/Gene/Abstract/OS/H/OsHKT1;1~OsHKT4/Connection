OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsROC1|OsMYBc	The transcription factor OsMYBc and an E3 ligase regulate expression of a K+ transporter during salt stress.	 A member of the High-Affinity K+ Transporter (HKT) family in rice (Oryza sativa), OsHKT1;1, is a vital regulator of Na+ exclusion from shoots and is bound by a MYB transcription factor (OsMYBc)
