OsHAK10	OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 might contribute to accumulation of Na+ in old leaves under salt stress
OsHAK16	OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 might contribute to accumulation of Na+ in old leaves under salt stress
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8	A conserved primary salt tolerance mechanism mediated by HKT transporters: a mechanism for sodium exclusion and maintenance of high K(+)/Na(+) ratio in leaves during salinity stress	 Here we present a review on vital physiological functions of HKT transporters including AtHKT1;1 and OsHKT1;5 in preventing shoot Na(+) over-accumulation by mediating Na(+) exclusion from xylem vessels in the presence of a large amount of Na(+) thereby protecting leaves from salinity stress
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	Sodium transport and HKT transporters: the rice model	 Yeast expressions of OsHKT1 and OsHKT4 proved that they are Na+ transporters of high and low affinity, respectively, which are sensitive to K+ and Ba2+
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	Sodium transport and HKT transporters: the rice model	 In roots, the expressions were much lower than in shoots, except for OsHKT4 and OsHKT1 in K+-starved plants
