OsHAK10	OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 might contribute to accumulation of Na+ in old leaves under salt stress
OsHAK16	OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 might contribute to accumulation of Na+ in old leaves under salt stress
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8|OsHK1;5	A conserved primary salt tolerance mechanism mediated by HKT transporters: a mechanism for sodium exclusion and maintenance of high K(+)/Na(+) ratio in leaves during salinity stress	Here we present a review on vital physiological functions of HKT transporters including AtHKT1;1 and OsHKT1;5 in preventing shoot Na(+) over-accumulation by mediating Na(+) exclusion from xylem vessels in the presence of a large amount of Na(+) thereby protecting leaves from salinity stress
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	Sodium transport and HKT transporters: the rice model	Yeast expressions of OsHKT1 and OsHKT4 proved that they are Na+ transporters of high and low affinity, respectively, which are sensitive to K+ and Ba2+
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	Sodium transport and HKT transporters: the rice model	In roots, the expressions were much lower than in shoots, except for OsHKT4 and OsHKT1 in K+-starved plants
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsROC1|OsMYBc	The Rice High-Affinity Potassium Transporter1;1 Is Involved in Salt Tolerance and Regulated by an MYB-Type Transcription Factor.	Using a yeast one-hybrid approach, a novel MYB coiled-coil type transcription factor, OsMYBc, was found to bind to the OsHKT1;1 promoter
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsROC1|OsMYBc	The Rice High-Affinity Potassium Transporter1;1 Is Involved in Salt Tolerance and Regulated by an MYB-Type Transcription Factor.	In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation and in vitro electrophoresis mobility shift assays demonstrated that OsMYBc binds to AAANATNC(C/T) fragments within the OsHKT1;1 promoter
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsROC1|OsMYBc	The Rice High-Affinity Potassium Transporter1;1 Is Involved in Salt Tolerance and Regulated by an MYB-Type Transcription Factor.	Knockout of OsMYBc resulted in a reduction in NaCl-induced expression of OsHKT1;1 and salt sensitivity
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsROC1|OsMYBc	The Rice High-Affinity Potassium Transporter1;1 Is Involved in Salt Tolerance and Regulated by an MYB-Type Transcription Factor.	Taken together, these results suggest that OsHKT1;1 has a role in controlling Na(+) concentration and preventing sodium toxicity in leaf blades and is regulated by the OsMYBc transcription factor
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsHKT1;4	Constitutive Contribution by the Rice OsHKT1;4 Na + Transporter to Xylem Sap Desalinization and Low Na + Accumulation in Young Leaves Under Low as High External Na + Conditions	 Three rice HKT genes, OsHKT1;1, OsHKT1;4 and OsHKT1;5, are known to contribute to salt tolerance by reducing Na+ accumulation in shoots upon salt stress
