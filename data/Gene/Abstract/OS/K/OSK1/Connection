OsCOI1b	OSK1	A bacterial kinase phosphorylates OSK1 to suppress stomatal immunity in rice.	 Intriguingly, OSK1 phosphorylation at Ser(53) by XopC2 exclusively increases the binding affinity of OSK1 to the jasmonate receptor OsCOI1b, and specifically enhances the ubiquitination and degradation of JAZ transcription repressors and plant disease susceptibility through inhibiting stomatal immunity
