Using rice genome information and in vitro assay with recombinant enzymes, we identified genes (OsKS4 and OsKS10) encoding the type-A diterpene cyclases 9β-pimara-7,15-diene synthase and ent-sandaracopimaradiene synthase which are involved in the biosynthesis of momilactones A, B and oryzalexins A–F respectively. Transcript levels of these two genes increased remarkably after ultraviolet (UV) treatment, which is consistent with elevated production of phytoalexins by UV. These two genes might prove powerful tools for understanding plant defense mechanisms in rice.
J. Biol. Chem.-2009-Okada-26510-8.pdf	OsTGAP1, a bZIP transcription factor, coordinately regulates the inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice	2009	J Biol Chem	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Production of major diterpenoid phytoalexins, momilactones and phytocassanes, is induced in rice upon recognition of pathogenic invasion as plant defense-related compounds. We recently showed that biosynthetic genes for momilactones are clustered on rice chromosome 4 and co-expressed after elicitation, mimicking pathogen attack. Because genes for most metabolic pathways in plants are not organized in gene clusters, examination of the mechanism(s) regulating the expression of such clustered genes is needed. Here, we report a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-inducible basic leucine zipper transcription factor, OsTGAP1, which is essential for momilactone biosynthesis and regulates the expression of the five genes in the cluster. The knock-out mutant for OsTGAP1 had almost no expression of the five clustered genes (OsCPS4, OsKSL4, CYP99A2, CYP99A3, and OsMAS) or production of momilactones upon elicitor treatment. Inductive expression of OsKSL7 for phytocassane biosynthesis was also largely affected in the ostgap1 mutant, although phytocassane accumulation still occurred. Conversely, OsTGAP1-overexpressing lines exhibited enhanced expression of the clustered genes and hyperaccumulation of momilactones in response to the elicitor. Furthermore, enhanced expression of OsKSL7 and hyperaccumulation of phytocassanes was also observed. We also found that OsTGAP1 overexpression can influence transcriptional up-regulation of OsDXS3 in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, eventually leading to inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins. These results indicate that OsTGAP1 functions as a key regulator of the coordinated transcription of genes involved in inductive diterpenoid phytoalexin production in rice and mainly exerts an essential role on expression of the clustered genes for momilactone biosynthesis.
nihms339762.pdf	Genetic evidence for natural product-mediated plant-plant allelopathy in rice (Oryza sativa)	2012	New Phytol	Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics, & Molecular Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011, USA.	* There is controversy as to whether specific natural products play a role in directly mediating antagonistic plant-plant interactions - that is, allelopathy. If proved to exist, such phenomena would hold considerable promise for agronomic improvement of staple food crops such as rice (Oryza sativa). * However, while substantiated by the presence of phytotoxic compounds at potentially relevant concentrations, demonstrating a direct role for specific natural products in allelopathy has been difficult because of the chemical complexity of root and plant litter exudates. This complexity can be bypassed via selective genetic manipulation to ablate production of putative allelopathic compounds, but such an approach previously has not been applied. * The rice diterpenoid momilactones provide an example of natural products for which correlative biochemical evidence has been obtained for a role in allelopathy. Here, we apply reverse genetics, using knock-outs of the relevant diterpene synthases (copalyl diphosphate synthase 4 (OsCPS4) and kaurene synthase-like 4 (OsKSL4)), to demonstrate that rice momilactones are involved in allelopathy, including suppressing growth of the widespread rice paddy weed, barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli). * Thus, our results not only provide novel genetic evidence for natural product-mediated allelopathy, but also furnish a molecular target for breeding and metabolic engineering of this important crop plant.
Plant Physiol.-2004-Wilderman-2098-105.pdf	Identification of syn-pimara-7,15-diene synthase reveals functional clustering of terpene synthases involved in rice phytoalexin/allelochemical biosynthesis	2004	Plant Physiol	Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Molecular Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011, USA.	Rice (Oryza sativa) produces momilactone diterpenoids as both phytoalexins and allelochemicals. Accordingly, the committed step in biosynthesis of these natural products is catalyzed by the class I terpene synthase that converts syn-copalyl diphosphate to the corresponding polycyclic hydrocarbon intermediate syn-pimara-7,15-diene. Here, a functional genomics approach was utilized to identify a syn-copalyl diphosphate specific 9beta-pimara-7,15-diene synthase (OsDTS2). To our knowledge, this is the first identified terpene synthase with this particular substrate stereoselectivity and, by comparison with the previously described and closely related ent-copalyl diphosphate specific cassa-12,15-diene synthase (OsDTC1), provides a model system for investigating the enzymatic determinants underlying the observed difference in substrate specificity. Further, OsDTS2 mRNA in leaves is up-regulated by conditions that stimulate phytoalexin biosynthesis but is constitutively expressed in roots, where momilactones are constantly synthesized as allelochemicals. Therefore, transcription of OsDTS2 seems to be an important regulatory point for controlling production of these defensive compounds. Finally, the gene identified here as OsDTS2 has previously been mapped at 14.3 cM on chromosome 4. The class II terpene synthase producing syn-copalyl diphosphate from the universal diterpenoid precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate was also mapped to this same region. These genes catalyze sequential cyclization steps in momilactone biosynthesis and seem to have been evolutionarily coupled by physical linkage and resulting cosegregation. Further, the observed correlation between physical proximity and common metabolic function indicates that other such class I and class II terpene synthase gene clusters may similarly catalyze consecutive reactions in shared biosynthetic pathways.
NA	A histone deacetylase inhibitor enhances rice immunity by derepressing the expression of defense-related genes.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Hubei Engineering Research Center for Specialty Flowers Biological Breeding/College of Bioengineering, Jingchu University of Technology, Jingmen, China.	Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACis) have been widely used in plants to investigate the role of histone acetylation, particularly the function of HDACs, in the regulation of development and stress response. However, how histone acetylation is involved in rice (Oryza sativa L.) disease resistance has hardly been studied. In this paper, four HDACis including Sodium butyrate (NaBT), Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid (SAHA), LBH-589 and Trichostatin A (TSA) were used to treat rice seedlings at different concentrations before inoculation of Magnaporthe oryzae. We found that only 10mM NaBT treatment can significantly enhanced rice blast resistance. However, treatment of the four HDACis all increased global histone acetylation but at different sites, suggesting that the inhibition selectivity of these HDACis is different. Notably, the global H3K9ac level was dramatically elevated after both NaBT and LBH589 treatment although LBH589 could not enhance rice blast resistance. This indicates that the HDACs they inhibit target different genes. In accordance with the phenotype, transcriptomic analysis showed that many defense-related genes were up-regulated by NaBT treatment. Up-regulation of the four genes bsr-d1, PR10B, OsNAC4, OsKS4 were confirmed by RT-qPCR. ChIP-qPCR results revealed that H3K9ac level on these genes was increased after NaBT treatment, suggesting that these defense-related genes were repressed by HDACs. In addition, by promoter motif analysis of the genes that induced by both NaBT treatment and rice blast infection, we found that the motifs bound by ERF and AHL transcription factors (TFs) were the most abundant, which demonstrates that ERF and AHL proteins may act as the candidate TFs that recruit HDACs to defense-related genes to repress their expression when plants are not infected by rice blast.
