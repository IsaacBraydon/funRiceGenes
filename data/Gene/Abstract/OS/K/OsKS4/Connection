OsCPS4|OsCyc1	OsDTS2|OsKSL4|OsKS4	Genetic evidence for natural product-mediated plant-plant allelopathy in rice (Oryza sativa)	Here, we apply reverse genetics, using knock-outs of the relevant diterpene synthases (copalyl diphosphate synthase 4 (OsCPS4) and kaurene synthase-like 4 (OsKSL4)), to demonstrate that rice momilactones are involved in allelopathy, including suppressing growth of the widespread rice paddy weed, barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli)
