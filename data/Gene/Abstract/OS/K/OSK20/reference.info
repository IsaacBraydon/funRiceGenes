NA	The F-box protein SHORT PRIMARY ROOT modulates primary root meristem activity by targeting SEUSS-LIKE protein for degradation in rice.	2023	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Hubei Hongshan Laboratory, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Root meristem activity is essential for root morphogenesis and adaptation, but the molecular mechanism regulating root meristem activity is not fully understood. Here, we identify an F-box family E3 ubiquitin ligase named SHORT PRIMARY ROOT (SHPR) that regulates primary root (PR) meristem activity and cell proliferation in rice. SHPR loss-of-function mutations impair PR elongation in rice. SHPR is involved in the formation of an SCF complex with the Oryza sativa SKP1-like protein OSK1/20. We show that SHPR interacts with Oryza sativa SEUSS-LIKE (OsSLK) in the nucleus and is required for OsSLK polyubiquitination and degradation by the ubiquitin 26S-proteasome system (UPS). Transgenic plants overexpressing OsSLK display a shorter PR phenotype, which is similar to the SHPR loss-of-function mutants. Genetic analysis suggests that SHPR promotes PR elongation in an OsSLK-dependent manner. Collectively, our study establishes SHPR as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets OsSLK for degradation, and uncovers a protein ubiquitination pathway as a mechanism for modulating root meristem activity in rice.
