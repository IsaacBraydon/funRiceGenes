OsKASI	root	OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	The involvement of OsKASI in FA synthesis is found to play a critical role in root development of rice
OsKASI	root	OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Our results demonstrate that involvement of OsKASI in FA synthesis is required for root development in rice
OsKASI	map-based cloning	OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Map-based cloning revealed that the mutation occurred in a putative 3-oxoacyl-synthase, an ortholog of β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I (KASI) in Arabidopsis, thus designated as OsKASI
OsKASI	fertility	OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 In addition, OsKASI deficiency resulted in reduced fertility and a remarkable change in fatty acid (FA) composition and contents in roots and seeds
OsKASI	development	OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	The involvement of OsKASI in FA synthesis is found to play a critical role in root development of rice
OsKASI	development	OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Our results demonstrate that involvement of OsKASI in FA synthesis is required for root development in rice

OsKASI	root development	OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Our results demonstrate that involvement of OsKASI in FA synthesis is required for root development in rice
OsKASI	R protein	OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Map-based cloning revealed that the mutation occurred in a putative 3-oxoacyl-synthase, an ortholog of β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I (KASI) in Arabidopsis, thus designated as OsKASI
