Interaction and cross-talk between microtubules and actin microfilaments are important for the cell axis and polarity during plant cell growth and development, but little is known about the molecular components of this interaction. Plant kinesins with a calponin-homology domain (KCHs) were recently identified and associated with a putative role in microtubule-microfilament cross-linking. KCHs belong to a distinct branch of the minus end-directed kinesin subfamily and so far have only been identified in land plants including the mosses. Here we report the identification of a new KCH from rice (Oryza sativa), OsKCH1, and show that OsKCH1 is associated with cortical microtubules and actin microfilaments in vivo. Furthermore, OsKCH1 is shown to bind to micro-tubules and actin microfilaments in vitro in a domain-dependent way. Additionally, this unique type of kinesin is shown to oligomerize both in vivo and in vitro. These findings are discussed with respect to a general role for KCHs as linkers between actin filaments and microtubules in both cell elongation and division.
NA	The non-processive rice kinesin-14 OsKCH1 transports actin filaments along microtubules with two distinct velocities.	2015	Nat Plants	Molecular Plant Physiology, Biocentre Klein Flottbek, University of Hamburg, 22609 Hamburg, Germany.	Microtubules and actin filaments function coordinately in many cellular processes(1-3). Although much of this coordination is mediated by proteins that statically bridge the two cytoskeletal networks(4-6), kinesin-14 motors with an actin binding calponin homology domain (KCHs) have been discovered as putatively dynamic crosslinkers in plants(7,8). OsKCH1, a KCH from rice, interacts with both microtubules and actin filaments in vivo and in vitro(9). However, it has remained unclear whether this interaction is dynamic or if actin binding reduces or even abolishes the motor's motility on microtubules(10,11). Here, we directly show in vitro that OsKCH1 is a non-processive, minus-end-directed motor that transports actin filaments along microtubules. Interestingly, we observe two distinct transport velocities dependent on the relative orientation of the actin filaments with respect to the microtubules. In addition, torsional compliance measurements on individual molecules reveal low flexibility in OsKCH1. We suggest that the orientation-dependent transport velocities emerge from OsKCH1's low torsional compliance combined with an inherently oriented binding to the actin filament. Together, our results imply a central role of OsKCH1 in the polar orientation of actin filaments along microtubules, and thus a contribution to the organization of the cytoskeletal architecture.
