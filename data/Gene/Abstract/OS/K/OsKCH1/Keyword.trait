OsKCH1	architecture	The non-processive rice kinesin-14 OsKCH1 transports actin filaments along microtubules with two distinct velocities.	 Together, our results imply a central role of OsKCH1 in the polar orientation of actin filaments along microtubules, and thus a contribution to the organization of the cytoskeletal architecture
