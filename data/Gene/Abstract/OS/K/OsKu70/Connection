OsKu70	OsKu80|Ku80	Suppression of OsKu80 results in defects in developmental growth and increased telomere length in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	OsKu80 forms a heterodimer with OsKu70 in yeast and plant cells, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid, inÂ vivo co-immunoprecipitation, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays
