D35|OsKOS3|OsKO2	OsKOS1|OsKOL4|CYP701A8	CYP701A8: a rice ent-kaurene oxidase paralog diverted to more specialized diterpenoid metabolism	In particular, under conditions where OsKO2 catalyzes the expected conversion of ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenoic acid required for GA biosynthesis, OsKOL4 instead efficiently reacts with ent-sandaracopimaradiene and ent-cassadiene to produce the corresponding C3alpha-hydroxylated diterpenoids
D35|OsKOS3|OsKO2	OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsNAC2 encoding a NAC transcription factor affects plant height through mediating the gibberellic acid pathway in rice.	Dual-luciferase reporter analyses, yeast one-hybrid assays and ChIP-qPCR suggested that OsNAC2 directly interacted with the promoter of OsEATB and OsKO2
D35|OsKOS3|OsKO2	OsbZIP48	OsbZIP48, a HY5 transcription factor ortholog, exerts pleiotropic effects in light-regulated development.	 Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that OsbZIP48 directly binds to the OsKO2 promoter
D35|OsKOS3|OsKO2	OsbHLH073	OsbHLH073 Negatively Regulates Internode Elongation and Plant Height by Modulating GA Homeostasis in Rice.	 We report that OsbHLH073 participates in regulating plant height, internode elongation, and panicle exsertion by regulating GA biosynthesis associated with the OsKO1 and OsKO2 genes
D35|OsKOS3|OsKO2	OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsNAC2 Is Involved in Multiple Hormonal Pathways to Mediate Germination of Rice Seeds and Establishment of Seedling	 We also found that OsNAC2 regulates downstream targets in a time-dependent manner by binding to the promoter of OsKO2 in the seedling period but not in the germination stage
