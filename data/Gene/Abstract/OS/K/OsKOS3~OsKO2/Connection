D35|OsKOS3|OsKO2	OsKOS1|OsKOL4|CYP701A8	CYP701A8: a rice ent-kaurene oxidase paralog diverted to more specialized diterpenoid metabolism	In particular, under conditions where OsKO2 catalyzes the expected conversion of ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenoic acid required for GA biosynthesis, OsKOL4 instead efficiently reacts with ent-sandaracopimaradiene and ent-cassadiene to produce the corresponding C3alpha-hydroxylated diterpenoids
D35|OsKOS3|OsKO2	OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsNAC2 encoding a NAC transcription factor affects plant height through mediating the gibberellic acid pathway in rice.	Dual-luciferase reporter analyses, yeast one-hybrid assays and ChIP-qPCR suggested that OsNAC2 directly interacted with the promoter of OsEATB and OsKO2
D35|OsKOS3|OsKO2	OsbZIP48	OsbZIP48, a HY5 transcription factor ortholog, exerts pleiotropic effects in light-regulated development.	 Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that OsbZIP48 directly binds to the OsKO2 promoter
