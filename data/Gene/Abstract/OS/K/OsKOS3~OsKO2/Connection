D35|OsKOS3|OsKO2	OsKOS1|OsKOL4|CYP701A8	A rice semi-dwarf gene, Tan-Ginbozu (D35), encodes the gibberellin biosynthesis enzyme, ent-kaurene oxidase	 Introduction of OsKOL4 into d35Tan-Ginbozu did not rescue its dwarf phenotype, indicating that OsKOL4 is not involved in GA biosynthesis
D35|OsKOS3|OsKO2	OsKOS1|OsKOL4|CYP701A8	CYP701A8: a rice ent-kaurene oxidase paralog diverted to more specialized diterpenoid metabolism	 In particular, under conditions where OsKO2 catalyzes the expected conversion of ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenoic acid required for GA biosynthesis, OsKOL4 instead efficiently reacts with ent-sandaracopimaradiene and ent-cassadiene to produce the corresponding C3alpha-hydroxylated diterpenoids
D35|OsKOS3|OsKO2	OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2	OsNAC2 encoding a NAC transcription factor affects plant height through mediating the gibberellic acid pathway in rice.	 Dual-luciferase reporter analyses, yeast one-hybrid assays and ChIP-qPCR suggested that OsNAC2 directly interacted with the promoter of OsEATB and OsKO2
