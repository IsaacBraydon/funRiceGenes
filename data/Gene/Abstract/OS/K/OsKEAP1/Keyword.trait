OsKEAP1	seedlings	Identification, Characterization, and Mutational Analysis of a Probable KEAP1 Ortholog in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	 The downregulation of OsKEAP1 increased the levels of H2O2, malondialdehyde, and proline while significantly decreasing the expression of two catalase genes in seedlings grown under normal and salt-stressed conditions
OsKEAP1	growth	Identification, Characterization, and Mutational Analysis of a Probable KEAP1 Ortholog in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	 The oskeap1 mutations greatly impaired plant growth and development, resulting in significant declines in a majority of agronomic and yield-related traits, i
OsKEAP1	development	Identification, Characterization, and Mutational Analysis of a Probable KEAP1 Ortholog in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	 In silico analysis showed that OsKEAP1 has a Kelch-repeat domain which is identical to those of animals and a plant-specific development and cell death (DCD) domain in place of the broad-complex, tramtrack, bric-a-brac (BTB) domain found in animals
OsKEAP1	cell death	Identification, Characterization, and Mutational Analysis of a Probable KEAP1 Ortholog in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	 In silico analysis showed that OsKEAP1 has a Kelch-repeat domain which is identical to those of animals and a plant-specific development and cell death (DCD) domain in place of the broad-complex, tramtrack, bric-a-brac (BTB) domain found in animals
OsKEAP1	cytoplasm	Identification, Characterization, and Mutational Analysis of a Probable KEAP1 Ortholog in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	 OsKEAP1 was proven to be localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus, in contrast to the exclusive cytoplasm localization of animal KEAP1
OsKEAP1	plant growth	Identification, Characterization, and Mutational Analysis of a Probable KEAP1 Ortholog in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	 The oskeap1 mutations greatly impaired plant growth and development, resulting in significant declines in a majority of agronomic and yield-related traits, i
