OsKAT1	OsKAT2	A Dominant Negative OsKAT2 Mutant Delays Light-Induced Stomatal Opening and Improves Drought Tolerance without Yield Penalty in Rice.	 Rice contains three inward rectifying shaker-like potassium channel proteins, OsKAT1, OsKAT2, and OsKAT3
OsAIR2	OsKAT1	Molecular characterization of rice arsenic-induced RING Finger E3 ligase 2 (OsAIR2) and its heterogeneous overexpression in Arabidopsis thalaiana.	 Moreover, in vitro pull-down assay verified the physical interaction between OsAIR2 and OsKAT1
OsAIR2	OsKAT1	Molecular characterization of rice arsenic-induced RING Finger E3 ligase 2 (OsAIR2) and its heterogeneous overexpression in Arabidopsis thalaiana.	 Interestingly, in vitro ubiquitination assay and in vivo proteasomal degradation assay revealed that OsAIR2 ubiquitinates OsKAT1 and promotes the degradation of OsKAT1 via the 26S proteasome degradation pathway
OsAKT1	OsKAT1	Genome-Wide Analysis of Potassium Channel Genes in Rice: Expression of the OsAKT and OsKAT Genes under Salt Stress	 Among the studied K+ channel proteins, OsKAT1 and OsAKT1 were identified as proteins with high potential N-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites, and LEU, VAL, SER, PRO, HIS, GLY, LYS, TYR, CYC, and ARG amino acids were predicted as the binding residues in the ligand-binding sites of K+ channel proteins
