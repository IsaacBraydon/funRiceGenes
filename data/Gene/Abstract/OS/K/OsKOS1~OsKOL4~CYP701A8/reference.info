10.1023-B-PLAN.0000038261.21060.47.pdf	A rice semi-dwarf gene, Tan-Ginbozu (D35), encodes the gibberellin biosynthesis enzyme, ent-kaurene oxidase	2004	Plant Mol Biol	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi 464-8601, Japan.	A rice (Oryza sativa L.) semi-dwarf cultivar, Tan-Ginbozu (d35Tan-Ginbozu), contributed to the increase in crop productivity in Japan in the 1950s. Previous studies suggested that the semi-dwarf stature of d35Tan-Ginbozu is caused by a defective early step of gibberellin biosynthesis, which is catalyzed by ent-kaurene oxidase (KO). To study the molecular characteristics of d35Tan-Ginbozu, we isolated 5 KO-like (KOL) genes from the rice genome, which encoded proteins highly homologous to Arabidopsis and pumpkin KOs. The genes (OsKOL1 to 5) were arranged as tandem repeats in the same direction within a 120 kb sequence. Expression analysis revealed that OsKOL2 and OsKOL4 were actively transcribed in various organs, while OsKOL1 and OsKOL5 were expressed only at low levels; OsKOL3 may be a pseudogene. Sequence analysis and complementation experiments demonstrated that OsKOL2 corresponds to D35. Homozygote with null alleles of D35 showed a severe dwarf phenotype; therefore, d35Tan-Ginbozu is a weak allele of D35. Introduction of OsKOL4 into d35Tan-Ginbozu did not rescue its dwarf phenotype, indicating that OsKOL4 is not involved in GA biosynthesis. OsKOL4 and OsKOL5 are likely to take part in phytoalexin biosynthesis, because their expression was promoted by UV irradiation and/or elicitor treatment. Comparing d35Tan-Ginbozu with other high yielding cultivars, we discuss strategies to produce culm architectures suitable for high crop yield by decreasing GA levels.
Plant Physiol.-2005-Zhu-1935-45.pdf	The rice dwarf virus P2 protein interacts with ent-kaurene oxidases in vivo, leading to reduced biosynthesis of gibberellins and rice dwarf symptoms	2005	Plant Physiol	Peking-Yale Joint Center for Plant Molecular Genetics and Agrobiotechnology, National Laboratory of Protein Engineering and Plant Genetic Engineering, College of Life Science, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China.	The mechanisms of viral diseases are a major focus of biology. Despite intensive investigations, how a plant virus interacts with host factors to cause diseases remains poorly understood. The Rice dwarf virus (RDV), a member of the genus Phytoreovirus, causes dwarfed growth phenotypes in infected rice (Oryza sativa) plants. The outer capsid protein P2 is essential during RDV infection of insects and thus influences transmission of RDV by the insect vector. However, its role during RDV infection within the rice host is unknown. By yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays, we report that P2 of RDV interacts with ent-kaurene oxidases, which play a key role in the biosynthesis of plant growth hormones gibberellins, in infected plants. Furthermore, the expression of ent-kaurene oxidases was reduced in the infected plants. The level of endogenous GA1 (a major active gibberellin in rice vegetative tissues) in the RDV-infected plants was lower than that in healthy plants. Exogenous application of GA3 to RDV-infected rice plants restored the normal growth phenotypes. These results provide evidence that the P2 protein of RDV interferes with the function of a cellular factor, through direct physical interactions, that is important for the biosynthesis of a growth hormone leading to symptom expression. In addition, the interaction between P2 and rice ent-kaurene oxidase-like proteins may decrease phytoalexin biosynthesis and make plants more competent for virus replication. Moreover, P2 may provide a novel tool to investigate the regulation of GA metabolism for plant growth and development.
Plant Physiol.-2012-Wang-1418-25.pdf	CYP701A8: a rice ent-kaurene oxidase paralog diverted to more specialized diterpenoid metabolism	2012	Plant Physiol	Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Molecular Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa 50011, USA.	All higher plants contain an ent-kaurene oxidase (KO), as such a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 701 family member is required for gibberellin (GA) phytohormone biosynthesis. While gene expansion and functional diversification of GA-biosynthesis-derived diterpene synthases into more specialized metabolism has been demonstrated, no functionally divergent KO/CYP701 homologs have been previously identified. Rice (Oryza sativa) contains five CYP701A subfamily members in its genome, despite the fact that only one (OsKO2/CYP701A6) is required for GA biosynthesis. Here we demonstrate that one of the other rice CYP701A subfamily members, OsKOL4/CYP701A8, does not catalyze the prototypical conversion of the ent-kaurene C4alpha-methyl to a carboxylic acid, but instead carries out hydroxylation at the nearby C3alpha position in a number of related diterpenes. In particular, under conditions where OsKO2 catalyzes the expected conversion of ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenoic acid required for GA biosynthesis, OsKOL4 instead efficiently reacts with ent-sandaracopimaradiene and ent-cassadiene to produce the corresponding C3alpha-hydroxylated diterpenoids. These compounds are expected intermediates in biosynthesis of the oryzalexin and phytocassane families of rice antifungal phytoalexins, respectively, and can be detected in rice plants under the appropriate conditions. Thus, it appears that OsKOL4 plays a role in the more specialized diterpenoid metabolism of rice, and our results provide evidence for divergence of a KO/CYP701 family member from GA biosynthesis. This further expands the range of enzymes recruited from the ancestral GA primary pathway to the more complex and specialized labdane-related diterpenoid metabolic network found in rice.
NA	Optimization of recombinant expression enables discovery of novel cytochrome P450 activity in rice diterpenoid biosynthesis.	2015	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Molecular Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, 50011, USA.	The oxygenation reactions catalyzed by cytochromes P450 (CYPs) play critical roles in plant natural products biosynthesis. At the same time, CYPs are one of most challenging enzymes to functionally characterize due to the difficulty of recombinantly expressing these membrane-associated monooxygenases. In the course of investigating rice diterpenoid biosynthesis, we have developed a synthetic biology approach for functional expression of relevant CYPs in Escherichia coli. In certain cases, activity was observed for only one of two closely related paralogs although it seems clear that related reactions are required for production of the known diterpenoids. Here, we report that optimization of the recombinant expression system enabled characterization of not only these previously recalcitrant CYPs, but also discovery of additional activity relevant to rice diterpenoid biosynthesis. Of particular interest, CYP701A8 was found to catalyze 3β-hydroxylation of syn-pimaradiene, which is presumably relevant to momilactone biosynthesis, while CYP71Z6 &amp; 7 were found to catalyze multiple reactions, with CYP71Z6 catalyzing the production of 2α,3α-dihydroxy-ent-isokaurene via 2α-hydroxy-ent-isokaurene, and CYP71Z7 catalyzing the production of 3α-hydroxy-ent-cassadien-2-one via 2α-hydroxy-ent-cassadiene and ent-cassadien-2-one, which may be relevant to oryzadione and phytocassane biosynthesis, respectively.
NA	Assessment of efficacy of mutagenesis of gamma-irradiation in plant height and days to maturity through expression analysis in rice	2021	PLoS One	Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Agricultural College and Research Institute, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Killikulam, Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu, India.	Introduction of semi-dwarfism and early maturity in rice cultivars is important to achieve improved plant architecture, lodging resistance and high yield. Gamma rays induced mutations are routinely used to achieve these traits. We report the development of a semi-dwarf, early maturing and high-yielding mutant of rice cultivar 'Improved White Ponni', a popular cosmopolitan variety in south India preferred for its superior grain quality traits. Through gamma rays induced mutagenesis, several mutants were developed and subjected to selection up to six generations (M6) until the superior mutants were stabilized. In the M6 generation, significant reduction in days to flowering (up to 11.81% reduction) and plant height (up to 40% reduction) combined with an increase in single plant yield (up to 45.73% increase) was observed in the mutant population. The cooking quality traits viz., linear elongation ratio, breadthwise expansion ratio, gel consistency and gelatinization temperature of the mutants were similar to the parent variety Improved White Ponni. The genetic characterization with SSR markers showed variability between the semi-dwarf-early mutants and the Improved White Ponni. Gibberellin responsiveness study and quantitative real-time PCR showed a faulty gibberellin pathway and epistatic control between the genes such as OsKOL4 and OsBRD2 causing semi-dwarfism in a mutant. These mutants have potential as new rice varieties and can be used as new sources of semi-dwarfism and earliness for improving high grain quality rice varieties.
NA	Uncovering the Novel QTLs and Candidate Genes of Salt Tolerance in Rice with Linkage Mapping, RTM-GWAS, and RNA-seq.	2021	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.	Salinity is a major abiotic stress that limits plant growth and crop productivity. Indica rice and japonica rice show significant differences in tolerance to abiotic stress, and it is considered a feasible method to breed progeny with stronger tolerance to abiotic stress by crossing indica and japonica rice. We herein developed a high-generation recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from Luohui 9 (indica) X RPY geng (japonica). Based on the high-density bin map of this RILs population, salt tolerance QTLs controlling final survival rates were analyzed by linkage mapping and RTM-GWAS methods. A total of seven QTLs were identified on chromosome 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8. qST-3.1, qST-5.1, qST-6.1, and qST-6.2 were novel salt tolerance QTLs in this study and their function were functionally verified by comparative analysis of parental genotype RILs. The gene aggregation result of these four new QTLs emphasized that the combination of the four QTL synergistic genotypes can significantly improve the salt stress tolerance of rice. By comparing the transcriptomes of the root tissues of the parents&#39; seedlings, at 3 days and 7 days after salt treatment, we then achieved fine mapping of QTLs based on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identification and DEGs annotations, namely, LOC_Os06g01250 in qST-6.1, LOC_Os06g37300 in qST-6.2, LOC_Os05g14880 in qST-5.1. The homologous genes of these candidate genes were involved in abiotic stress tolerance in different plants. These results indicated that LOC_Os05g14880, LOC_Os06g01250, and LOC_Os06g37300 were the candidate genes of qST-5.1, qST-6.1, and qST-6.2. Our finding provided novel salt tolerance-related QTLs, candidate genes, and several RILs with better tolerance, which will facilitate breeding for improved salt tolerance of rice varieties and promote the exploration tolerance mechanisms of rice salt stress.
