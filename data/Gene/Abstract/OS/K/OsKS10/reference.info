68_2001.pdf	Diterpene Cyclases Responsible for the Biosynthesis of Phytoalexins, Momilactones A, B, and Oryzalexins A–F in Rice	2014	Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry	Department of Bioresource Engineering, Yamagata University	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) produces diterpene phytoalexins, such as momilactones, oryzalexins, and phytocassanes. Using rice genome information and in vitro assay with recombinant enzymes, we identified genes (OsKS4 and OsKS10) encoding the type-A diterpene cyclases 9β-pimara-7,15-diene synthase and ent-sandaracopimaradiene synthase which are involved in the biosynthesis of momilactones A, B and oryzalexins A–F respectively. Transcript levels of these two genes increased remarkably after ultraviolet (UV) treatment, which is consistent with elevated production of phytoalexins by UV. These two genes might prove powerful tools for understanding plant defense mechanisms in rice.
