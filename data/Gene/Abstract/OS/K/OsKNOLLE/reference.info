Wang-2011-[Heterologous expres.pdf	Heterologous expression of a rice syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE gene (<I>OsKNOLLE</I>) in yeast and its functional analysis in the role of abiotic stress	2011	Hereditas (Beijing)	College of Life Sciences, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China.	Syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE, a multifunctional protein family belonging to the SNARE superfamily, plays an important role in many physiological processes in plants. In order to understand the function of the syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE (OsKNOLLE) in rice (Oryza sativa), the CDS sequence of OsKNOLLE gene isolated from a japonica rice cultivar "Zhonghua 11" was fused into an expression vector pYX212 and transformed into the S. cerevisiae strain BY4741 by lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol method. The transformants with OsKNOLLE showed better survival abilities than the transformants with the empty vectors based on their phenotypes in responses to different abiotic stresses such as salt, Cu2+, H2O2, Cd2+, and Hg2+. These data suggests that OsKNOLLE plays a crucial role in re-sponses to abiotic stresses. This experimental system sets up a method for studying functions of the OsKNOLLE gene in the future and clarifies the relationship between OsKNOLLE and abiotic stresses.
