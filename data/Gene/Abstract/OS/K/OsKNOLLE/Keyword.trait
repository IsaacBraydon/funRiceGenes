OsKNOLLE	abiotic stress	Heterologous expression of a rice syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE gene (<I>OsKNOLLE</I>) in yeast and its functional analysis in the role of abiotic stress	The transformants with OsKNOLLE showed better survival abilities than the transformants with the empty vectors based on their phenotypes in responses to different abiotic stresses such as salt, Cu2+, H2O2, Cd2+, and Hg2+
OsKNOLLE	abiotic stress	Heterologous expression of a rice syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE gene (<I>OsKNOLLE</I>) in yeast and its functional analysis in the role of abiotic stress	These data suggests that OsKNOLLE plays a crucial role in re-sponses to abiotic stresses
OsKNOLLE	abiotic stress	Heterologous expression of a rice syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE gene (<I>OsKNOLLE</I>) in yeast and its functional analysis in the role of abiotic stress	This experimental system sets up a method for studying functions of the OsKNOLLE gene in the future and clarifies the relationship between OsKNOLLE and abiotic stresses
OsKNOLLE	abiotic stress	Heterologous expression of a rice syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE gene (<I>OsKNOLLE</I>) in yeast and its functional analysis in the role of abiotic stress	Heterologous expression of a rice syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE gene (<I>OsKNOLLE</I>) in yeast and its functional analysis in the role of abiotic stress
OsKNOLLE	salt	Heterologous expression of a rice syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE gene (<I>OsKNOLLE</I>) in yeast and its functional analysis in the role of abiotic stress	The transformants with OsKNOLLE showed better survival abilities than the transformants with the empty vectors based on their phenotypes in responses to different abiotic stresses such as salt, Cu2+, H2O2, Cd2+, and Hg2+
