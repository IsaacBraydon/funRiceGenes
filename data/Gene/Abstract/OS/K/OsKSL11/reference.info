We have cloned a novel diterpene synthase (OsKSL11) from rice that produces stemod-13(17)-ene from syn-copalyl diphosphate. Notably, this gene sequence was not predicted from the extensive sequence information available for rice, nor, despite extensive phytochemical investigations, has this diterpene or any derived natural product previously been reported in rice plants. OsKSL11 represents the first identified stemodene synthase, which catalyzes the committed step in biosynthesis of the stemodane family of diterpenoid natural products, some of which possess antiviral activity. In addition, OsKSL11 is highly homologous to the mechanistically similar stemarene synthase recently identified from rice, making this pair of diterpene cyclases an excellent model system for investigating the enzymatic determinants for differential product outcome. The unexpected nature of this cyclase and its product parallels recent observations of previously unrecognized natural products metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting that many, if not all, plant species will prove to have extensive biosynthetic capacity.
1-s2.0-S0014579304008452-main.pdf	Stemar-13-ene synthase, a diterpene cyclase involved in the biosynthesis of the phytoalexin oryzalexin S in rice	2004	FEBS Lett	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	In suspension-cultured rice cells, diterpenoid phytoalexins are produced in response to exogenously applied elicitors. We isolated a cDNA encoding a diterpene cyclase, OsDTC2, from suspension-cultured rice cells treated with a chitin elicitor. The OsDTC2 cDNA was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase, and the recombinant OsDTC2 was indicated to function as stemar-13-ene synthase that converted syn-copalyl diphosphate to stemar-13-ene, a putative diterpene hydrocarbon precursor of the phytoalexin oryzalexin S. The level of OsDTC2 mRNA in suspension-cultured rice cells began to increase 3 h after addition of the elicitor and reached the maximum after 8 h. The expression of OsDTC2 was also induced in UV-irradiated rice leaves. In addition, we indicated that stemar-13-ene accumulated in the chitin-elicited suspension-cultured rice cells and the UV-irradiated rice leaves.
1-s2.0-S0167478107001340-main.pdf	Promoter analysis of the rice stemar-13-ene synthase gene OsDTC2, which is involved in the biosynthesis of the phytoalexin oryzalexin S	2007	Biochim Biophys Acta	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	A rice diterpene cyclase, OsDTC2, functions as a stemar-13-ene synthase that converts syn-copalyl diphosphate into stemar-13-ene, a putative diterpene hydrocarbon precursor of the phytoalexin oryzalexin S. The transcriptional expression of OsDTC2 is induced by treatment of suspension-cultured rice cells with a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of the elicitor signaling pathway that leads to OsDTC2 expression, we carried out deletion and mutation analysis of the region -1939 bp upstream of the transcription start site of OsDTC2 in rice cells using dual luciferase assays. The region between -1709 and -1450 bp was found to contain six W-box motifs, which are putative recognition sites for WRKY transcription factors, as cis elements involved in elicitor-responsiveness and/or basic promoter activity of OsDTC2.
