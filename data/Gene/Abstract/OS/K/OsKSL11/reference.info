1-s2.0-S000398610500384X-main.pdf	An unexpected diterpene cyclase from rice: functional identification of a stemodene synthase	2006	Arch Biochem Biophys	Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Molecular Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011, USA.	We have cloned a novel diterpene synthase (OsKSL11) from rice that produces stemod-13(17)-ene from syn-copalyl diphosphate. Notably, this gene sequence was not predicted from the extensive sequence information available for rice, nor, despite extensive phytochemical investigations, has this diterpene or any derived natural product previously been reported in rice plants. OsKSL11 represents the first identified stemodene synthase, which catalyzes the committed step in biosynthesis of the stemodane family of diterpenoid natural products, some of which possess antiviral activity. In addition, OsKSL11 is highly homologous to the mechanistically similar stemarene synthase recently identified from rice, making this pair of diterpene cyclases an excellent model system for investigating the enzymatic determinants for differential product outcome. The unexpected nature of this cyclase and its product parallels recent observations of previously unrecognized natural products metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting that many, if not all, plant species will prove to have extensive biosynthetic capacity.
1-s2.0-S0014579304008452-main.pdf	Stemar-13-ene synthase, a diterpene cyclase involved in the biosynthesis of the phytoalexin oryzalexin S in rice	2004	FEBS Lett	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	In suspension-cultured rice cells, diterpenoid phytoalexins are produced in response to exogenously applied elicitors. We isolated a cDNA encoding a diterpene cyclase, OsDTC2, from suspension-cultured rice cells treated with a chitin elicitor. The OsDTC2 cDNA was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase, and the recombinant OsDTC2 was indicated to function as stemar-13-ene synthase that converted syn-copalyl diphosphate to stemar-13-ene, a putative diterpene hydrocarbon precursor of the phytoalexin oryzalexin S. The level of OsDTC2 mRNA in suspension-cultured rice cells began to increase 3 h after addition of the elicitor and reached the maximum after 8 h. The expression of OsDTC2 was also induced in UV-irradiated rice leaves. In addition, we indicated that stemar-13-ene accumulated in the chitin-elicited suspension-cultured rice cells and the UV-irradiated rice leaves.
1-s2.0-S0167478107001340-main.pdf	Promoter analysis of the rice stemar-13-ene synthase gene OsDTC2, which is involved in the biosynthesis of the phytoalexin oryzalexin S	2007	Biochim Biophys Acta	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	A rice diterpene cyclase, OsDTC2, functions as a stemar-13-ene synthase that converts syn-copalyl diphosphate into stemar-13-ene, a putative diterpene hydrocarbon precursor of the phytoalexin oryzalexin S. The transcriptional expression of OsDTC2 is induced by treatment of suspension-cultured rice cells with a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of the elicitor signaling pathway that leads to OsDTC2 expression, we carried out deletion and mutation analysis of the region -1939 bp upstream of the transcription start site of OsDTC2 in rice cells using dual luciferase assays. The region between -1709 and -1450 bp was found to contain six W-box motifs, which are putative recognition sites for WRKY transcription factors, as cis elements involved in elicitor-responsiveness and/or basic promoter activity of OsDTC2.
NA	Identification of a small set of genes commonly regulated in rice roots in response to beneficial rhizobacteria	2020	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	Ecologie Microbienne, CNRS UMR-5557, INRAe UMR-1418, VetAgroSup, Universit¨¦ de Lyon, Universit¨¦ Lyon1, 16 rue Dubois, 69622 Villeurbanne, France.	Rhizosphere bacteria, whether phytopathogenic or phytobeneficial, are thought to be perceived by the plant as a threat. Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR), such as many strains of the Azospirillum genus known as the main phytostimulator of cereals, cooperate with host plants and favorably affect their growth and health. An earlier study of rice root transcriptome, undertaken with two rice cultivars and two Azospirillum strains, revealed a strain-dependent response during the rice-Azospirillum association and showed that only a few genes, including some implicated in plant defense, were commonly regulated in all tested conditions. Here, a set of genes was selected from previous studies and their expression was monitored by qRT-PCR in rice roots inoculated with ten PGPR strains isolated from various plants and belonging to various genera (Azospirillum, Herbaspirillum, Paraburkholderia). A common expression pattern was highlighted for four genes that are proposed to be markers of the rice-PGPR interaction: two genes involved in diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis (OsDXS3 and OsDTC2) and one coding for an uncharacterized protein (Os02g0582900) were significantly induced by PGPR whereas one defense-related gene encoding a pathogenesis-related protein (PR1b, Os01g0382000) was significantly repressed. Interestingly, exposure to a rice bacterial pathogen also triggered the expression of OsDXS3 while the expression of Os02g0582900 and PR1b was down-regulated, suggesting that these genes might play a key role in rice-bacteria interactions. Integration of these results with previous data led us to propose that the jasmonic acid signaling pathway might be triggered in rice roots upon inoculation with PGPR.
