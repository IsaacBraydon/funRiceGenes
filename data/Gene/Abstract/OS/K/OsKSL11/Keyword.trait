OsDTC2|OsKSL11	transcription factor	Promoter analysis of the rice stemar-13-ene synthase gene OsDTC2, which is involved in the biosynthesis of the phytoalexin oryzalexin S	 The region between -1709 and -1450 bp was found to contain six W-box motifs, which are putative recognition sites for WRKY transcription factors, as cis elements involved in elicitor-responsiveness and/or basic promoter activity of OsDTC2
