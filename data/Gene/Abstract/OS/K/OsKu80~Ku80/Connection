OsKu80|Ku80	OsLig4|Lig4	Suppression of Ku70/80 or Lig4 leads to decreased stable transformation and enhanced homologous recombination in rice	 Rice calli from OsKu70, OsKu80 and OsLig4 knockdown (KD) plants were infected with Agrobacterium harboring a sensitive emerald luciferase (LUC) reporter construct to evaluate stable expression and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) construct to monitor transient expression of T-DNA| In addition, suppression of OsKu70, OsKu80 and OsLig4 induced the expression of HR-related genes on treatment with DNA-damaging agents
OsKu70	OsKu80|Ku80	Suppression of OsKu80 results in defects in developmental growth and increased telomere length in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 OsKu80 forms a heterodimer with OsKu70 in yeast and plant cells, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid, inÂ vivo co-immunoprecipitation, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays
