OsKAT2	OsKAT3	Unique features of two potassium channels, OsKAT2 and OsKAT3, expressed in rice guard cells	Here we report the characterization of two inward rectifying shaker-like potassium channels, OsKAT2 and OsKAT3, expressed in guard cell of rice plants
OsKAT2	OsKAT3	Unique features of two potassium channels, OsKAT2 and OsKAT3, expressed in rice guard cells	While OsKAT2 showed typical potassium channel activity, like that of Arabidopsis KAT1, OsKAT3 did not despite high sequence similarity between the two channel proteins
