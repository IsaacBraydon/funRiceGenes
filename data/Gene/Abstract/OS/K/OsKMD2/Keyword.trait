OsKMD2	growth	The rice F-box protein KISS ME DEADLY2 functions as a negative regulator of cytokinin signalling.	 Ectopic overexpression of OsKMD2 in Arabidopsis results in decreased cytokinin sensitivity based on a hypocotyl growth response assay, the decrease in sensitivity correlating with a decrease in the levels of the transcriptional regulator AtARR12
