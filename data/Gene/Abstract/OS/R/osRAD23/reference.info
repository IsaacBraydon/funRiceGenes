In order to identify proteins that interact with plant transcriptional complexes, we performed a two-hybrid screen in yeast using a cDNA library from embryogenic rice suspension cultures and the plant transcriptional activator viviparous-1 (vp1) as 'bait'. In this screen, we detected an interaction between VP1 and a rice homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD23 gene (osRAD23). The RAD23 protein is associated with the general transcriptional machinery in yeast, and is believed to play a role in the processes of nucleotide excision repair in yeast and mammalian cells. This report is the first identification of a RAD23 homolog in plants. The osRAD23 amino acid sequence shares 50-60% similarity throughout its length with RAD23 sequences from yeast, mice, and man. osRAD23 contains a characteristic ubiquitin-like domain at its N-terminus, which is similar to other RAD23 genes. Analysis of the expressed sequence tag database identifies two different classes of RAD23 genes in both Arabidopsis and rice. Southern analysis of rice genomic DNA indicated the presence of at least two RAD23-like genes. A single transcript (1.5 kb) of osRAD23 was detected in total RNA from rice embryonic tissue, while three transcripts (1.8, 1.5 and 1.0 kb) were observed in total RNA from vegetative tissues of rice.
NA	Genome-wide discovery of natural variation in pre-mRNA splicing and prioritising causal alternative splicing to salt stress response in rice	2021	New Phytol	School of Biological Sciences, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE, 68588, USA.	Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step for the regulation of gene expression. In order to specifically capture splicing variants in plants for genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we developed a software tool to quantify and visualise Variations of Splicing in Population (VaSP). VaSP can quantify splicing variants from short-read RNA-seq datasets and discover genotype-specific splicing (GSS) events, which can be used to prioritise causal pre-mRNA splicing events in GWAS. We applied our method to an RNA-seq dataset with 328 samples from 82 genotypes from a rice diversity panel exposed to optimal and saline growing conditions. In total, 764 significant GSS events were identified in salt stress conditions. GSS events were used as markers for a GWAS with the shoot Na+ accumulation, which identified six GSS events in five genes significantly associated with the shoot Na+ content. Two of these genes, OsNUC1 and OsRAD23 emerged as top candidate genes with splice variants that exhibited significant divergence between the variants for shoot growth under salt stress conditions. VaSP is a versatile tool for alternative splicing analysis in plants and a powerful tool for prioritising candidate causal pre-mRNA splicing and corresponding genomic variations in GWAS.
