However, their importance in growth and development is not fully understood. Here, we report OsRAF (a Root Abundant Factor gene in Oryza sativa), a new member of the rice ERF group, expressed more abundantly in roots than in other organs of rice at the transcriptional level. Moreover, the expression could be up-regulated by ethylene or low temperature. Transient expression of OsRAF::GFP fusion in onion epidermis cells and its overexpression in Arabidopsis revealed that OsRAF was a nucleus localized protein. Down-regulation of OsRAFâ€™s expression by RNAi method failed to produce aberrance in transgenic rice, which suggests existence of functionally redundant gene(s).
NA	OsLG3 contributing to rice grain length and yield was mined by Ho-LAMap.	2017	BMC Biol	Key Laboratory of Crop Heterosis and Utilization, Ministry of Education/Beijing Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.	Most agronomic traits in rice are complex and polygenic. The identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for grain length is an important objective of rice genetic research and breeding programs.Herein, we identified 99 QTL for grain length by GWAS based on approximately 10 million single nucleotide polymorphisms from 504 cultivated rice accessions (Oryza sativa L.), 13 of which were validated by four linkage populations and 92 were new loci for grain length. We scanned the Ho (observed heterozygosity per locus) index of coupled-parents of crosses mapping the same QTL, based on linkage and association mapping, and identified two new genes for grain length. We named this approach as Ho-LAMap. A simulation study of six known genes showed that Ho-LAMap could mine genes rapidly across a wide range of experimental variables using deep-sequencing data. We used Ho-LAMap to clone a new gene, OsLG3, as a positive regulator of grain length, which could improve rice yield without influencing grain quality. Sequencing of the promoter region in 283 rice accessions from a wide geographic range identified four haplotypes that seem to be associated with grain length. Further analysis showed that OsLG3 alleles in the indica and japonica evolved independently from distinct ancestors and low nucleotide diversity of OsLG3 in indica indicated artificial selection. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OsLG3 might have much potential value for improvement of grain length in japonica breeding.The results demonstrated that Ho-LAMap is a potential approach for gene discovery and OsLG3 is a promising gene to be utilized in genomic assisted breeding for rice cultivar improvement.
NA	Natural Variation in OsLG3 Increases Drought Tolerance in Rice by Inducing ROS Scavenging.	2018	Plant Physiol	China Agricultural University CITY: Beijing China [CN].	Improving the performance of rice (Oryza sativa L.) under drought stress has the potential to significantly affect rice productivity. Here, we report that the ERF family transcription factor OsLG3 positively regulates drought tolerance in rice. In our previous work, we found that OsLG3 has a positive effect on rice grain length without affecting grain quality. In this study, we found that OsLG3 was more strongly expressed in upland rice than in lowland rice under drought-stress conditions. By performing candidate gene association analysis, we found that natural variation in the promoter of OsLG3 is associated with tolerance to osmotic stress in germinating rice seeds. Overexpression of OsLG3 significantly improved the tolerance of rice plants to simulated drought, whereas suppression of OsLG3 resulted in greater susceptibility. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the tolerant allele of OsLG3 may improve drought tolerance in cultivated japonica rice. Introgression lines and complementation transgenic lines containing the elite allele of OsLG3IRAT109 showed increased drought tolerance, demonstrating that natural variation in OsLG3 contributes to drought tolerance in rice. Further investigation suggested that OsLG3 plays a positive role in drought-stress tolerance in rice by inducing reactive oxygen species scavenging. Collectively, our findings reveal that natural variation in OsLG3 contributes to rice drought tolerance and that the elite allele of OsLG3 is a promising genetic resource for the development of drought-tolerant rice varieties.
