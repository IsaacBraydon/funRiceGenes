However, their importance in growth and development is not fully understood. Here, we report OsRAF (a Root Abundant Factor gene in Oryza sativa), a new member of the rice ERF group, expressed more abundantly in roots than in other organs of rice at the transcriptional level. Moreover, the expression could be up-regulated by ethylene or low temperature. Transient expression of OsRAF::GFP fusion in onion epidermis cells and its overexpression in Arabidopsis revealed that OsRAF was a nucleus localized protein. Down-regulation of OsRAFâ€™s expression by RNAi method failed to produce aberrance in transgenic rice, which suggests existence of functionally redundant gene(s).
