However, their importance in growth and development is not fully understood. Here, we report OsRAF (a Root Abundant Factor gene in Oryza sativa), a new member of the rice ERF group, expressed more abundantly in roots than in other organs of rice at the transcriptional level. Moreover, the expression could be up-regulated by ethylene or low temperature. Transient expression of OsRAF::GFP fusion in onion epidermis cells and its overexpression in Arabidopsis revealed that OsRAF was a nucleus localized protein. Down-regulation of OsRAFâ€™s expression by RNAi method failed to produce aberrance in transgenic rice, which suggests existence of functionally redundant gene(s).
NA	OsLG3 contributing to rice grain length and yield was mined by Ho-LAMap.	2017	BMC Biol	Key Laboratory of Crop Heterosis and Utilization, Ministry of Education/Beijing Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.	Most agronomic traits in rice are complex and polygenic. The identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for grain length is an important objective of rice genetic research and breeding programs.Herein, we identified 99 QTL for grain length by GWAS based on approximately 10 million single nucleotide polymorphisms from 504 cultivated rice accessions (Oryza sativa L.), 13 of which were validated by four linkage populations and 92 were new loci for grain length. We scanned the Ho (observed heterozygosity per locus) index of coupled-parents of crosses mapping the same QTL, based on linkage and association mapping, and identified two new genes for grain length. We named this approach as Ho-LAMap. A simulation study of six known genes showed that Ho-LAMap could mine genes rapidly across a wide range of experimental variables using deep-sequencing data. We used Ho-LAMap to clone a new gene, OsLG3, as a positive regulator of grain length, which could improve rice yield without influencing grain quality. Sequencing of the promoter region in 283 rice accessions from a wide geographic range identified four haplotypes that seem to be associated with grain length. Further analysis showed that OsLG3 alleles in the indica and japonica evolved independently from distinct ancestors and low nucleotide diversity of OsLG3 in indica indicated artificial selection. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OsLG3 might have much potential value for improvement of grain length in japonica breeding.The results demonstrated that Ho-LAMap is a potential approach for gene discovery and OsLG3 is a promising gene to be utilized in genomic assisted breeding for rice cultivar improvement.
