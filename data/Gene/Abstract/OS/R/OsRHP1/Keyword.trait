OsRHP1	leaf	Overexpressing a novel RING-H2 finger protein gene, OsRHP1, enhances drought and salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 In our work, OsRHP1 was expressed ubiquitously in various tissues, but its transcript is accumulated more in mature leaf
OsRHP1	drought	Overexpressing a novel RING-H2 finger protein gene, OsRHP1, enhances drought and salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Compared with wild-type (WT) rice plants, transgenic plants overexpressing OsRHP1 exhibited more tolerance to drought and salt stress
OsRHP1	drought	Overexpressing a novel RING-H2 finger protein gene, OsRHP1, enhances drought and salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 These results demonstrate that overexpression of OsRHP1 substantially enhances drought and salt tolerance through increased ABA level and enhanced ABA-mediated stress response
OsRHP1	salt	Overexpressing a novel RING-H2 finger protein gene, OsRHP1, enhances drought and salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Compared with wild-type (WT) rice plants, transgenic plants overexpressing OsRHP1 exhibited more tolerance to drought and salt stress
