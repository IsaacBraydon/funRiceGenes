We identified four histidine kinase (HK) genes of a cytokinin receptor family, two histidine-containing phosphotransmitter (HPt) genes, thirteen A-type response regulator (RR) genes and six B-type RR genes in the rice genome. The HK genes (OHK2, OHK3, OHK4 and OHK5 for Oryza sativa HK), the HPt genes (OHP1 and OHP2 for O. sativa HPt) and the B-type RR genes (ORR1, ORR2, ORR3, ORR4 and ORR6 for O. sativa RR) except one (ORR5) showed expression in various organs. ORR5 was expressed in callus and flower. Three A-type RR genes (OsRR4, OsRR9 and OsRR10 for O. sativa RR) showed cytokinin-induced expression, and three (OsRR8, OsRR12 and OsRR13) showed expression in flower. We also identified two other genes named OHK1 and CHARK (CHASE domain Receptor-like serine/threonine Kinase). OHK1 encodes an HK similar to Arabidopsis CKI1, which is involved in female gametophyte development. CHARK encodes a protein with an extracellular cytokinin-perceiving CHASE domain and a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain which are connected with a single transmembrane domain. The presence of all four gene families and CHARK in the rice genome suggests that a cytokinin signal is transduced by the phosphotransfer mechanism as is the case in Arabidopsis, and that rice may have an additional novel signalling pathway involving serine/threonine phosphorylation.

The aim of this study was to characterize type-A response regulator genes from rice, and to investigate their expression in various organs as well as in response to different hormones, including cytokinin, and environmental stimuli. RESULTS: By analysis of the whole genome sequence of rice, we have identified ten genes encoding type-A response regulators based upon their high sequence identity within the receiver domain. The exon-intron organization, intron-phasing as well as chromosomal location of all the RT-PCR amplified rice (Oryza sativa) response regulator (OsRR) genes have been analyzed. The transcripts of OsRR genes could be detected by real-time PCR in all organs of the light- and dark-grown rice seedlings/plants, although there were quantitative differences. The steady-state transcript levels of most of the OsRR genes increased rapidly (within 15 min) on exogenous cytokinin application even in the presence of cycloheximide. Moreover, the expression of the OsRR6 gene was enhanced in rice seedlings exposed to salinity, dehydration and low temperature stress. CONCLUSION: Ten type-A response regulator genes identified in rice, the model monocot plant, show overlapping/differential expression patterns in various organs and in response to light. The induction of OsRR genes by cytokinin even in the absence of de novo protein synthesis qualifies them to be primary cytokinin response genes. The induction of OsRR6 in response to different environmental stimuli indicates its role in cross-talk between abiotic stress and cytokinin signaling. These results provide a foundation for further investigations on specific as well as overlapping cellular functions of type-A response regulators in rice.
Hirose-2007-Overexpression of a.pdf	Overexpression of a type-A response regulator alters rice morphology and cytokinin metabolism	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	RIKEN Plant Science Center, 1-7-22, Suehiro, Tsurumi, Yokohama, 230-0045, Japan.	Genome-wide analyses of rice (Oryza sativa L.) cytokinin (CK)-responsive genes using the Affymetrix GeneChip(R) rice genome array were conducted to define the spectrum of genes subject to regulation by CK in monocotyledonous plants. Application of trans-zeatin modulated the expression of a wide variety of genes including those involved in hormone signaling and metabolism, transcriptional regulation, macronutrient transport and protein synthesis. To understand further the function of CK in rice plants, we examined the effects of in planta manipulation of a putative CK signaling factor on morphology, CK metabolism and expression of CK-responsive genes. Overexpression of the CK-inducible type-A response regulator OsRR6 abolished shoot regeneration, suggesting that OsRR6 acts as a negative regulator of CK signaling. Transgenic lines overexpressing OsRR6 (OsRR6-ox) had dwarf phenotypes with poorly developed root systems and panicles. Increased content of trans-zeatin-type CKs in OsRR6-ox lines indicates that homeostatic control of CK levels is regulated by OsRR6 signaling. Expression of genes encoding CK oxidase/dehydrogenase decreased in OsRR6-ox plants, possibly accounting for elevated CK levels in transgenic lines. Expression of a number of stress response genes was also altered in OsRR6-ox plants.
MPMI-06-12-0152-R.pdf	Cytokinins act synergistically with salicylic acid to activate defense gene expression in rice	2013	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Japan. cjjiang@affrc.go.jp	Hormone crosstalk is pivotal in plant-pathogen interactions. Here, we report on the accumulation of cytokinins (CK) in rice seedlings after infection of blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and its potential significance in rice-M. oryzae interaction. Blast infection to rice seedlings increased levels of N(6)-(Delta(2)-isopentenyl) adenine (iP), iP riboside (iPR), and iPR 5'-phosphates (iPRP) in leaf blades. Consistent with this, CK signaling was activated around the infection sites, as shown by histochemical staining for beta-glucuronidase activity driven by a CK-responsive OsRR6 promoter. Diverse CK species were also detected in the hyphae (mycelium), conidia, and culture filtrates of blast fungus, indicating that M. oryzae is capable of production as well as hyphal secretion of CK. Co-treatment of leaf blades with CK and salicylic acid (SA), but not with either one alone, markedly induced pathogenesis-related genes OsPR1b and probenazole-induced protein 1 (PBZ1). These effects were diminished by RNAi-knockdown of OsNPR1 or WRKY45, the key regulators of the SA signaling pathway in rice, indicating that the effects of CK depend on these two regulators. Taken together, our data imply a coevolutionary rice-M. oryzae interaction, wherein M. oryzae probably elevates rice CK levels for its own benefits such as nutrient translocation. Rice plants, on the other hand, sense it as an infection signal and activate defense reactions through the synergistic action with SA.
NA	OsRR6, a type-A response regulator in rice, mediates cytokinin, light and stress responses when over-expressed in Arabidopsis	2021	Plant Physiol Biochem .	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics & Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, 110021, India.	Plants have evolved a complex network of components that sense and respond to diverse signals. In the present study, we have characterized OsRR6, a type-A response regulator, which is part of the two-component sensor-regulator machinery in rice. The expression of OsRR6 is induced by exogenous cytokinin and various abiotic stress treatments, including drought, cold and salinity stress. Organ-specific expression analysis revealed that its expression is high in anther and low in shoot apical meristem. The Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing OsRR6 (OsRR6OX) exhibited reduced cytokinin sensitivity, adventitious root formation and enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in seeds. OsRR6OX plants were more tolerant to drought and salinity conditions when compared to wild-type. The hypocotyl growth in OsRR6OX seedlings was significantly inhibited under red, far-red and blue-light conditions and also a decline in transcript levels of OsRR6 was observed in rice under the above monochromatic as well as white light treatments. Transcriptome profiling revealed that the genes associated with defense responses and anthocyanin metabolism are up-regulated in OsRR6OX seedlings. Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that the genes associated with phenylpropanoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis are enriched among differentially expressed genes in OsRR6OX seedlings of Arabidopsis, which is in conformity with reanalysis of the transcriptome data performed in rice transgenics for OsRR6. Further, genes like DREB1A/CBF3, COR15A, KIN1, ERD10 and RD29A are significantly upregulated in OsRR6OX seedlings when subjected to ABA and abiotic stress treatments. Thus, a negative regulator of cytokinin signaling, OsRR6, plays a positive role in imparting abiotic stress tolerance.
