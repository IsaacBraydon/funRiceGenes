OsRR6	salinity	Molecular characterization and differential expression of cytokinin-responsive type-A response regulators in rice (Oryza sativa)	Moreover, the expression of the OsRR6 gene was enhanced in rice seedlings exposed to salinity, dehydration and low temperature stress
OsRR6	root	Overexpression of a type-A response regulator alters rice morphology and cytokinin metabolism	Transgenic lines overexpressing OsRR6 (OsRR6-ox) had dwarf phenotypes with poorly developed root systems and panicles
OsRR6	seedling	Molecular characterization and differential expression of cytokinin-responsive type-A response regulators in rice (Oryza sativa)	Moreover, the expression of the OsRR6 gene was enhanced in rice seedlings exposed to salinity, dehydration and low temperature stress
OsRR6	dwarf	Overexpression of a type-A response regulator alters rice morphology and cytokinin metabolism	Transgenic lines overexpressing OsRR6 (OsRR6-ox) had dwarf phenotypes with poorly developed root systems and panicles
OsRR6	cytokinin	Molecular characterization and differential expression of cytokinin-responsive type-A response regulators in rice (Oryza sativa)	The induction of OsRR6 in response to different environmental stimuli indicates its role in cross-talk between abiotic stress and cytokinin signaling
OsRR6	abiotic stress	Molecular characterization and differential expression of cytokinin-responsive type-A response regulators in rice (Oryza sativa)	The induction of OsRR6 in response to different environmental stimuli indicates its role in cross-talk between abiotic stress and cytokinin signaling
OsRR6	temperature	Molecular characterization and differential expression of cytokinin-responsive type-A response regulators in rice (Oryza sativa)	Moreover, the expression of the OsRR6 gene was enhanced in rice seedlings exposed to salinity, dehydration and low temperature stress
OsRR6	shoot	Overexpression of a type-A response regulator alters rice morphology and cytokinin metabolism	Overexpression of the CK-inducible type-A response regulator OsRR6 abolished shoot regeneration, suggesting that OsRR6 acts as a negative regulator of CK signaling
OsRR6	panicle	Overexpression of a type-A response regulator alters rice morphology and cytokinin metabolism	Transgenic lines overexpressing OsRR6 (OsRR6-ox) had dwarf phenotypes with poorly developed root systems and panicles
