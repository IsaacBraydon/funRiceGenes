OsRad21-4|OsREC8	PAIR2	OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation in rice	 Although the two axial-associated proteins, REC8 and PAIR2, are loaded onto the chromosomes, the depletion of PAIR2 from the chromosomes is much later than in wild type
OsAM1	OsRad21-4|OsREC8	OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice	 Very faint OsREC8 foci persisted in the Osam1 mutant, indicating that OsAM1 is not required for the initial meiotic recruitment of OsREC8
OsRad21-4|OsREC8	PAIR2	MER3 is required for normal meiotic crossover formation, but not for presynaptic alignment in rice	 In addition, MER3 does not colocalize with PAIR2 at the beginning of prophase I, but locates on one end of PAIR2 fragments at later stages, whereas MER3 foci merely locate on one end of REC8 fragments when signals start to be seen in early prophase I| The normal loading of PAIR2 and REC8 in mer3 implies that their loading is independent of MER3

MER3|RCK	OsRad21-4|OsREC8	OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis	 Finally, we found that the centromeric localization of OsSGO1 depends on OsAM1, not other meiotic proteins such as OsREC8, PAIR2, OsMER3, or ZEP1
