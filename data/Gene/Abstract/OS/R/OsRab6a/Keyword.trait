OsRab6a	root	A Small GTPase, OsRab6a, Is Involved in the Regulation of Iron Homeostasis in Rice	 These results may suggest that OsRab6a plays an important role in the regulation of Fe acquisition in rice plants by modulating physiological processes involved in Fe acquisition and root system architecture in response to Fe-deficient medium
OsRab6a	seedling	A Small GTPase, OsRab6a, Is Involved in the Regulation of Iron Homeostasis in Rice	 However, overexpression of OsRab6a conferred rice plants greater tolerance to Fe deficiency than RNAi and wild-type plants, as evidenced by higher seedling height, greater biomass, chlorophyll contents and Fe concentrations in shoots, roots and grains in the overexpression lines
OsRab6a	tolerance	A Small GTPase, OsRab6a, Is Involved in the Regulation of Iron Homeostasis in Rice	 However, overexpression of OsRab6a conferred rice plants greater tolerance to Fe deficiency than RNAi and wild-type plants, as evidenced by higher seedling height, greater biomass, chlorophyll contents and Fe concentrations in shoots, roots and grains in the overexpression lines
OsRab6a	architecture	A Small GTPase, OsRab6a, Is Involved in the Regulation of Iron Homeostasis in Rice	 These results may suggest that OsRab6a plays an important role in the regulation of Fe acquisition in rice plants by modulating physiological processes involved in Fe acquisition and root system architecture in response to Fe-deficient medium
OsRab6a	cytoplasm	A Small GTPase, OsRab6a, Is Involved in the Regulation of Iron Homeostasis in Rice	 OsRab6a shared conserved functional domains with other known members of Rab subfamily and localized ubiquitously in the cytoplasm and nuclear
OsRab6a	root system architecture	A Small GTPase, OsRab6a, Is Involved in the Regulation of Iron Homeostasis in Rice	 These results may suggest that OsRab6a plays an important role in the regulation of Fe acquisition in rice plants by modulating physiological processes involved in Fe acquisition and root system architecture in response to Fe-deficient medium
