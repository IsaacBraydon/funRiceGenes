OsRab6a	 Here, we identified a gene encoding a small GTPase, OsRab6a, in rice and characterized its role in Fe acquisition by generating transgenic rice plants with overexpression and knockdown of OsRab6a |  The expression of OsRab6a was rapidly and transiently up-regulated by Fe deficiency |  No differences in growth and development among the OsRab6a-overexpression, OsRab6a-RNAi and wild-type plants were detected when grown in Fe-sufficient medium |  However, overexpression of OsRab6a conferred rice plants greater tolerance to Fe deficiency than RNAi and wild-type plants, as evidenced by higher seedling height, greater biomass, chlorophyll contents and Fe concentrations in shoots, roots and grains in the overexpression lines |  Exposure to Fe-deficient medium led to up-regulation of OsIRO2, OsIRT1, OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 in both wild-type and the transgenic rice plants, with the magnitude of up-regulation positively correlated with the expression levels of OsRab6a	 Here, we identified a gene encoding a small GTPase, OsRab6a, in rice and characterized its role in Fe acquisition by generating transgenic rice plants with overexpression and knockdown of OsRab6a |  No differences in growth and development among the OsRab6a-overexpression, OsRab6a-RNAi and wild-type plants were detected when grown in Fe-sufficient medium |  However, overexpression of OsRab6a conferred rice plants greater tolerance to Fe deficiency than RNAi and wild-type plants, as evidenced by higher seedling height, greater biomass, chlorophyll contents and Fe concentrations in shoots, roots and grains in the overexpression lines	 No differences in growth and development among the OsRab6a-overexpression, OsRab6a-RNAi and wild-type plants were detected when grown in Fe-sufficient medium |  However, overexpression of OsRab6a conferred rice plants greater tolerance to Fe deficiency than RNAi and wild-type plants, as evidenced by higher seedling height, greater biomass, chlorophyll contents and Fe concentrations in shoots, roots and grains in the overexpression lines
