OsRab6a	 Here, we identified a gene encoding a small GTPase, OsRab6a, in rice and characterized its role in Fe acquisition by generating transgenic rice plants with overexpression and knockdown of OsRab6a |  The expression of OsRab6a was rapidly and transiently up-regulated by Fe deficiency |  No differences in growth and development among the OsRab6a-overexpression, OsRab6a-RNAi and wild-type plants were detected when grown in Fe-sufficient medium |  However, overexpression of OsRab6a conferred rice plants greater tolerance to Fe deficiency than RNAi and wild-type plants, as evidenced by higher seedling height, greater biomass, chlorophyll contents and Fe concentrations in shoots, roots and grains in the overexpression lines |  Exposure to Fe-deficient medium led to up-regulation of OsIRO2, OsIRT1, OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 in both wild-type and the transgenic rice plants, with the magnitude of up-regulation positively correlated with the expression levels of OsRab6a	 Here, we identified a gene encoding a small GTPase, OsRab6a, in rice and characterized its role in Fe acquisition by generating transgenic rice plants with overexpression and knockdown of OsRab6a |  No differences in growth and development among the OsRab6a-overexpression, OsRab6a-RNAi and wild-type plants were detected when grown in Fe-sufficient medium |  However, overexpression of OsRab6a conferred rice plants greater tolerance to Fe deficiency than RNAi and wild-type plants, as evidenced by higher seedling height, greater biomass, chlorophyll contents and Fe concentrations in shoots, roots and grains in the overexpression lines	 No differences in growth and development among the OsRab6a-overexpression, OsRab6a-RNAi and wild-type plants were detected when grown in Fe-sufficient medium |  However, overexpression of OsRab6a conferred rice plants greater tolerance to Fe deficiency than RNAi and wild-type plants, as evidenced by higher seedling height, greater biomass, chlorophyll contents and Fe concentrations in shoots, roots and grains in the overexpression lines
OsRab6a	 When growing in elevated [CO2] conditions, growth and grain yield of wild-type and OsRab6a-overexpression rice plants were enhanced, with the OsRab6a-overexpression rice plants exhibiting higher growth and yield than their wild-type counterparts |  Photosynthetic rates of both WT and OsRab6a-overexpressing plants were stimulated by elevated [CO2], with the magnitude of increase being higher in OsRab6a overexpression |  The genes associated with Fe acquisition Fe in OsRab6a-overexpressing lines exhibited greater expression than those in WT and OsRab6a-RNAi plants under elevated [CO2]	 When growing in elevated [CO2] conditions, growth and grain yield of wild-type and OsRab6a-overexpression rice plants were enhanced, with the OsRab6a-overexpression rice plants exhibiting higher growth and yield than their wild-type counterparts |  Photosynthetic rates of both WT and OsRab6a-overexpressing plants were stimulated by elevated [CO2], with the magnitude of increase being higher in OsRab6a overexpression	 Here, we report that the OsRab6a gene encoding a small GTPase is involved in the regulation of rice growth, seed yield and iron (Fe) accumulation in response to elevated [CO2] using wild-type and transgenic rice plants of OsRab6a-overexpressing and OsRab6a-RNAi |  In contrast, there were no effects of elevated [CO2] on growth and grain yield of OsRab6a-RNAi plants |  The genes associated with Fe acquisition Fe in OsRab6a-overexpressing lines exhibited greater expression than those in WT and OsRab6a-RNAi plants under elevated [CO2]
