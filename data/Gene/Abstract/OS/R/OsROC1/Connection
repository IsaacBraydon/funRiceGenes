OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsROC1|OsMYBc	The Rice High-Affinity Potassium Transporter1;1 Is Involved in Salt Tolerance and Regulated by an MYB-Type Transcription Factor.	Using a yeast one-hybrid approach, a novel MYB coiled-coil type transcription factor, OsMYBc, was found to bind to the OsHKT1;1 promoter
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsROC1|OsMYBc	The Rice High-Affinity Potassium Transporter1;1 Is Involved in Salt Tolerance and Regulated by an MYB-Type Transcription Factor.	In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation and in vitro electrophoresis mobility shift assays demonstrated that OsMYBc binds to AAANATNC(C/T) fragments within the OsHKT1;1 promoter
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsROC1|OsMYBc	The Rice High-Affinity Potassium Transporter1;1 Is Involved in Salt Tolerance and Regulated by an MYB-Type Transcription Factor.	Knockout of OsMYBc resulted in a reduction in NaCl-induced expression of OsHKT1;1 and salt sensitivity
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsROC1|OsMYBc	The Rice High-Affinity Potassium Transporter1;1 Is Involved in Salt Tolerance and Regulated by an MYB-Type Transcription Factor.	Taken together, these results suggest that OsHKT1;1 has a role in controlling Na(+) concentration and preventing sodium toxicity in leaf blades and is regulated by the OsMYBc transcription factor
OsROC1|OsMYBc	SDEL1|OsMSRFP	The transcription factor OsMYBc and an E3 ligase regulate expression of a K+ transporter during salt stress.	 A yeast two-hybrid screen using the OsMYBc N terminus as bait identified a rice MYBc stress-related RING finger protein (OsMSRFP)
OsROC1|OsMYBc	SDEL1|OsMSRFP	The transcription factor OsMYBc and an E3 ligase regulate expression of a K+ transporter during salt stress.	 OsMSRFP is an active E3 ligase that ubiquitinated OsMYBc in vitro and mediated 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of OsMYBc under semi-in vitro and in vivo conditions
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsROC1|OsMYBc	The transcription factor OsMYBc and an E3 ligase regulate expression of a K+ transporter during salt stress.	 A member of the High-Affinity K+ Transporter (HKT) family in rice (Oryza sativa), OsHKT1;1, is a vital regulator of Na+ exclusion from shoots and is bound by a MYB transcription factor (OsMYBc)
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsROC1|OsMYBc	The transcription factor OsMYBc and an E3 ligase regulate expression of a K+ transporter during salt stress.	 Here, we generated transgenic rice lines in the oshkt1;1 mutant background for genetic complementation using genomic OsHKT1;1 containing a native (Com) or mutated (mCom) promoter that cannot be bound by OsMYBc
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsROC1|OsMYBc	The transcription factor OsMYBc and an E3 ligase regulate expression of a K+ transporter during salt stress.	 These findings uncover a regulatory mechanism of salt response that fine-tunes OsHKT1;1 transcription by ubiquitination of OsMYBc
