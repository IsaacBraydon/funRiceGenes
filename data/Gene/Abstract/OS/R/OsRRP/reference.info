Electronic address: xiaofeijuner@126.com.	S-like ribonucleases (S-like RNases) are homologous to S-ribonucleases (S-RNases), but are not involved in self-incompatibility. In dicotyledonous plants, S-like RNases play an important role in phosphate recycling during senescence and are induced by inorganic phosphate-starvation and in response to defense and mechanical wounding. However, little information about the functions of the S-like RNase in monocots has been reported. Here, we investigated the expression patterns and roles of an S-like RNase gene, OsRNS4, in abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated responses and phytochrome-mediated light responses as well as salinity tolerance in rice. The OsRNS4 gene was expressed at relatively high levels in leaves although its transcripts were detected in various organs. OsRNS4 expression was regulated by salt, PEG and ABA. The seedlings overexpressing OsRNS4 had longer coleoptiles and first leaves than wild-type seedlings under red light (R) and far-red light (FR), suggesting negative regulation of OsRNS4 in photomorphogenesis in rice seedlings. Moreover, ABA-induced growth inhibition of rice seedlings was significantly increased in the OsRNS4-overexpression (OsRNS4-OX) lines compared with that in WT, suggesting that OsRNS4 probably acts as a positive regulator in ABA responses in rice seedlings. In addition, our results demonstrate that OsRNS4-OX lines have enhanced tolerance to high salinity compared to WT. Our findings supply new evidence on the functions of monocot S-like RNase in regulating photosensitivity and abiotic stress responses.
8.pdf	Cloning and characterization of an RNase-related protein gene preferentially expressed in rice stems	2006	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol and Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.	RNase-related proteins (RRPs) are S- and S-like RNase homologs lacking the active site required for RNase activity. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of the rice (Oryza sativa) RRP gene (OsRRP). A single copy of OsRRP occurs in the rice genome. OsRRP contains three introns and an open reading frame encoding 252 amino acids, with the replacement of two histidines involved in the active site of RNase by lysine and tyrosine respectively. OsRRP is preferentially expressed in stems of wild-type rice and is significantly down-regulated in an increased tillering dwarf mutant ext37.
