OsRab7|OsRab7B3	leaf	Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice	 In transgenic rice overexpressing OsRab7B3, the senescence-related genes were upregulated and leaf senescence was significantly enhanced under dark conditions| Hence it is suggested that OsRab7B3 act as a stress-inducible gene that plays an important role in the leaf senescence process|Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice
OsRab7|OsRab7B3	 ABA 	Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice	 Expression of sGFP under the control of the OsRab7B3 promoter increased in leaves when ABA and NaCl were applied or when kept in dark
OsRab7|OsRab7B3	senescence	Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice	 One of the OsRab genes, OsRab7B3, closely associated with senescence in expression pattern, was chosen for functional analysis| In transgenic rice overexpressing OsRab7B3, the senescence-related genes were upregulated and leaf senescence was significantly enhanced under dark conditions| Hence it is suggested that OsRab7B3 act as a stress-inducible gene that plays an important role in the leaf senescence process|Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice
