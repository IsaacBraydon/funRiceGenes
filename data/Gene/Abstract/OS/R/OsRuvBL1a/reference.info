NA	OsRuvBL1a DNA helicase boost salinity and drought tolerance in transgenic indica rice raised by in planta transformation.	2023	Plant Sci	International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi 110067, India.	RuvBL, is a member of SF6 superfamily of helicases and is conserved among the various model systems. Recently, rice (Oryza sativa L.) homolog of RuvBL has been biochemically characterized for its ATPase and DNA helicase activities; however its involvement in stress has not been studied so far. Present investigation reports the detailed functional characterization of OsRuvBL under abiotic stresses through genetic engineering. An efficient Agrobacterium-mediated in planta transformation protocol was developed in indica rice to generate the transgenic lines and study was focused on optimization of factors to achieve maximum transformation efficiency. Overexpressing OsRuvBL1a transgenic lines showed enhanced tolerance under in vivo salinity stress as compared to WT plants. The physiological and biochemical analysis of the OsRuvBL1a transgenic lines showed better performance under salinity and drought stresses. Several stress responsive interacting partners of OsRuvBL1a were identified using Y2H system revealed to its role in stress tolerance. Functional mechanism for boosting stress tolerance by OsRuvBL1a has been proposed in this study. This integration of OsRuvBL1a gene in rice genome using in planta transformation method helped to achieve the abiotic stress resilient smart crop. This study is the first direct evidence to show the novel function of RuvBL in boosting abiotic stress tolerance in plants.
