Magnesium (Mg) homeostasis is critical for maintaining many biological processes, but little information is available to comprehend the molecular mechanisms regulating Mg concentration in rice (Oryza sativa). To make up for the lack of information, we aimed to identify mutants defective in Mg homeostasis through a forward genetic approach. As a result of the screening of 2,825 M2 seedlings mutated by ion-beam irradiation, we found a rice mutant that showed reduced Mg content in leaves and slightly increased Mg content in roots. Radiotracer 28Mg experiments showed that this mutant, named low-magnesium content 1 (LMGC1), has decreased Mg2+ influx in the root and Mg2+ translocation from root to shoot. Consequently, LMGC1 is sensitive to the low Mg condition and prone to develop chlorosis in the young mature leaf. The MutMap method identified a 7.4-kbp deletion in the LMGC1 genome leading to a loss of two genes. Genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9 further revealed that one of the two lost genes, a gene belonging to the RanBP2-type zinc-finger family that we named RanBP2-TYPE ZINC FINGER1 (OsRZF1), was the causal gene of the low Mg phenotype. OsRZF1 is a nuclear protein and may have a fundamental role in maintaining Mg homeostasis in rice plants.
