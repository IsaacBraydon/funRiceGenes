BACKGROUND: The rice small GTPase OsRac1 is a molecular switch in rice innate immunity. The Receptor for Activated Kinase C-1 (RACK1) interacts with OsRac1 to suppress the growth of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. RACK1 has two homologs in rice, RACK1A and RACK1B. Overexpressing RACK1A enhances resistance to the rice blast fungus. However, RACK1A downstream signals are largely unknown. RESULTS: Here, we report the identification of OsRap2.6, a transcription factor that interacts with RACK1A. We found a 94% similarity between the OsRap2.6 AP2 domain and Arabidopsis Rap2.6 (AtRap2.6). Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays in rice protoplasts using tagged OsRap2.6 and RACK1A with the C-terminal and N-terminal fragments of Venus (Vc/Vn) indicated that OsRap2.6 and RACK1A interacted and localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Moreover, OsRap2.6 and OsMAPK3/6 interacted in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Expression of defense genes PAL1 and PBZ1 as well as OsRap2.6 was induced after chitin treatment. Disease resistance analysis using OsRap2.6 RNAi and overexpressing (Ox) plants infected with the rice blast fungus indicated that OsRap2.6 RNAi plants were highly susceptible, whereas OsRap2.6 Ox plants had an increased resistance to the compatible blast fungus. CONCLUSIONS: OsRap2.6 contributes to rice innate immunity through its interaction with RACK1A in compatible interactions.
NA	OsERF101, an ERF family transcription factor, regulates drought stress response in reproductive tissues.	2018	Plant Mol Biol	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, 2005 Songhu Road, Shanghai, 200438, China.	An ERF transcription factor OsERF101 is predominantly expressed in rice reproductive tissues and plays an important role in improving rice seed setting rate under drought stress. Drought reduces grain yield due to the cumulative damage effects to plant vegetative and reproductive developmental processes. However, the genes involved in these processes are still not completely understood. In this study, we identified a gene named OsERF101 as an important positive regulator in the adaptive responses to dehydration stress during the reproductive and vegetative stages. This gene encodes a member of APETALA2/Ethylene-Responsive Element Binding Protein (AP2/EREBP) family. OsERF101 was predominantly expressed in flowers, particularly in the tapetum and microspores under normal growth conditions. It was induced by drought, PEG6000 and abscisic acid (ABA) in leaves. During the vegetative stage, OsERF101-overexpression plants were more resistant to osmotic stress caused by PEG6000 compared to the control plants. They also had higher survival and seed setting rates than wild type when subjected to reproductive-stage drought stress. Further physiological analysis revealed that the pollen fertility was improved in the overexpression lines, while the knockout mutant and RNAi lines showed reduced pollen fertility and compromised drought tolerance during the reproductive stage. The increased proline content and peroxidase activity in OsERF101-overexpression plants might contribute to the improved drought-tolerance of plants. In addition, OsERF101-overexpression plants displayed ABA susceptible phenotype, in which the expression levels of ABA-responsive genes RD22, LEA3, and PODs were up-regulated. Taken together, our results indicate that OsERF101 is a gene that regulates dehydration responses during the vegetative and reproductive stages.
