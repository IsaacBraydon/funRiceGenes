BACKGROUND: The rice small GTPase OsRac1 is a molecular switch in rice innate immunity. The Receptor for Activated Kinase C-1 (RACK1) interacts with OsRac1 to suppress the growth of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. RACK1 has two homologs in rice, RACK1A and RACK1B. Overexpressing RACK1A enhances resistance to the rice blast fungus. However, RACK1A downstream signals are largely unknown. RESULTS: Here, we report the identification of OsRap2.6, a transcription factor that interacts with RACK1A. We found a 94% similarity between the OsRap2.6 AP2 domain and Arabidopsis Rap2.6 (AtRap2.6). Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays in rice protoplasts using tagged OsRap2.6 and RACK1A with the C-terminal and N-terminal fragments of Venus (Vc/Vn) indicated that OsRap2.6 and RACK1A interacted and localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Moreover, OsRap2.6 and OsMAPK3/6 interacted in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Expression of defense genes PAL1 and PBZ1 as well as OsRap2.6 was induced after chitin treatment. Disease resistance analysis using OsRap2.6 RNAi and overexpressing (Ox) plants infected with the rice blast fungus indicated that OsRap2.6 RNAi plants were highly susceptible, whereas OsRap2.6 Ox plants had an increased resistance to the compatible blast fungus. CONCLUSIONS: OsRap2.6 contributes to rice innate immunity through its interaction with RACK1A in compatible interactions.
NA	OsERF101, an ERF family transcription factor, regulates drought stress response in reproductive tissues.	2018	Plant Mol Biol	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, 2005 Songhu Road, Shanghai, 200438, China.	An ERF transcription factor OsERF101 is predominantly expressed in rice reproductive tissues and plays an important role in improving rice seed setting rate under drought stress. Drought reduces grain yield due to the cumulative damage effects to plant vegetative and reproductive developmental processes. However, the genes involved in these processes are still not completely understood. In this study, we identified a gene named OsERF101 as an important positive regulator in the adaptive responses to dehydration stress during the reproductive and vegetative stages. This gene encodes a member of APETALA2/Ethylene-Responsive Element Binding Protein (AP2/EREBP) family. OsERF101 was predominantly expressed in flowers, particularly in the tapetum and microspores under normal growth conditions. It was induced by drought, PEG6000 and abscisic acid (ABA) in leaves. During the vegetative stage, OsERF101-overexpression plants were more resistant to osmotic stress caused by PEG6000 compared to the control plants. They also had higher survival and seed setting rates than wild type when subjected to reproductive-stage drought stress. Further physiological analysis revealed that the pollen fertility was improved in the overexpression lines, while the knockout mutant and RNAi lines showed reduced pollen fertility and compromised drought tolerance during the reproductive stage. The increased proline content and peroxidase activity in OsERF101-overexpression plants might contribute to the improved drought-tolerance of plants. In addition, OsERF101-overexpression plants displayed ABA susceptible phenotype, in which the expression levels of ABA-responsive genes RD22, LEA3, and PODs were up-regulated. Taken together, our results indicate that OsERF101 is a gene that regulates dehydration responses during the vegetative and reproductive stages.
NA	Rice ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 101 Promotes Leaf Senescence Through Jasmonic Acid-Mediated Regulation of OsNAP and OsMYC2	2020	Front Plant Sci	Department of Plant Science, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.	Leaf senescence is the final stage of leaf development and an important step that relocates nutrients for grain filling in cereal crops. Senescence occurs in an age-dependent manner and under unfavorable environmental conditions such as deep shade, water deficit, and high salinity stresses. Although many transcription factors that modulate leaf senescence have been identified, the mechanisms that regulate leaf senescence in response to environmental conditions remain elusive. Here, we show that rice (Oryza sativa) ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 101 (OsERF101) promotes the onset and progression of leaf senescence. OsERF101 encodes a predicted transcription factor and OsERF101 transcript levels rapidly increased in rice leaves during dark-induced senescence (DIS), indicating that OsERF101 is a senescence-associated transcription factor. Compared with wild type, the oserf101 T-DNA knockout mutant showed delayed leaf yellowing and higher chlorophyll contents during DIS and natural senescence. Consistent with its delayed-yellowing phenotype, the oserf101 mutant exhibited downregulation of genes involved in chlorophyll degradation, including rice NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2 (OsNAP), STAY-GREEN (SGR), NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 (NYC1), and NYC3 during DIS. After methyl jasmonate treatment to induce rapid leaf de-greening, the oserf101 leaves retained more chlorophyll compared with wild type, indicating that OsERF101 is involved in promoting jasmonic acid (JA)-induced leaf senescence. Consistent with the involvement of JA, the expression of the JA signaling genes OsMYC2/JA INSENSITIVE 1 (OsJAI1) and CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1a (OsCOI1a), was downregulated in the oserf101 leaves during DIS. Transient transactivation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that OsERF101 directly binds to the promoter regions of OsNAP and OsMYC2, which activate genes involved in chlorophyll degradation and JA signaling-mediated leaf senescence. These results demonstrate that OsERF101 promotes the onset and progression of leaf senescence through a JA-mediated signaling pathway.
NA	A Pathogen-Inducible Rice NAC Transcription Factor ONAC096 Contributes to Immunity Against Magnaprothe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae by Direct Binding to the Promoters of OsRap2.6, OsWRKY62, and OsPAL1.	2021	Front Plant Sci	National Key Laboratory for Rice Biology, Institute of Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	The rice NAC transcriptional factor family harbors 151 members, and some of them play important roles in rice immunity. Here, we report the function and molecular mechanism of a pathogen-inducible NAC transcription factor, ONAC096, in rice immunity against Magnaprothe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Expression of ONAC096 was induced by M. oryzae and by abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate. ONAC096 had the DNA binding ability to NAC recognition sequence and was found to be a nucleus-localized transcriptional activator whose activity depended on its C-terminal. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of ONAC096 attenuated rice immunity and flg22-induced reactive oxygen species burst and expression of PTI marker genes OsWRKY45 and OsPAL4; by contrast, overexpression of ONAC096 enhanced rice immunity or flg22-induced PTI. RNA-seq transcriptomic profiling and qRT-PCR analysis identified a small set of defense and signaling genes that are putatively regulated by ONAC096, and further biochemical analysis validated that ONAC096 could directly bind to the promoters of OsRap2.6, OsWRKY62, and OsPAL1, three known defense and signaling genes that regulate rice immunity. ONAC096 interacts with ONAC066, which is a positive regulator of rice immunity. These results demonstrate that ONAC096 positively contributes to rice immunity against M. oryzae and X. oryzae pv. oryzae through direct binding to the promoters of downstream target genes including OsRap2.6, OsWRKY62, and OsPAL1.
NA	The rice OsERF101 transcription factor regulates the NLR Xa1-mediated immunity induced by perception of TAL effectors.	2022	New Phytol	Department of Advanced Bioscience, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kindai University, Nakamachi, Nara, 631-8505, Japan.	Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) initiate immune responses by recognizing pathogen effectors. The rice gene Xa1 encodes an NLR with an N-terminal BED domain, and recognizes transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors of Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo). Our goal here was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms controlling the induction of immunity by Xa1. We used yeast two-hybrid assays to screen for host factors that interact with Xa1 and identified the AP2/ERF-type transcription factor OsERF101/OsRAP2.6. Molecular complementation assays were used to confirm the interactions among Xa1, OsERF101 and two TAL effectors. We created OsERF101-overexpressing and knockout mutant lines in rice and identified genes differentially regulated in these lines, many of which are predicted to be involved in the regulation of response to stimulus. Xa1 interacts in the nucleus with the TAL effectors and OsERF101 via the BED domain. Unexpectedly, both the overexpression and the knockout lines of OsERF101 displayed Xa1-dependent, enhanced resistance to an incompatible Xoo strain. or downregulated in the overexpression and knockout lines. Our results indicate that OsERF101 regulates the recognition of TAL effectors by Xa1, and functions as a positive regulator of Xa1-mediated immunity. Furthermore, an additional Xa1-mediated immune pathway is negatively regulated by OsERF101.
