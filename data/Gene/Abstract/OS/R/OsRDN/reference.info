NA	ROOT DETERMINED NODULATION1 is required for M. truncatula CLE12, but not CLE13 peptide signaling through the SUNN receptor kinase.	2017	Plant Physiol	Colorado State University CITY: Fort Collins STATE: CO United States Of America [US].	The combinatorial interaction of a receptor kinase and a modified CLE peptide is involved in several developmental processes in plants, including Autoregulation of Nodulation (AON), which allows legumes to limit the number of root nodules formed based on available nitrogen and previous rhizobial colonization. Evidence supports modification of CLE peptides by enzymes of the hydroxyproline O-arabinosyltransferase (HPAT/RDN) family. Here we show by grafting and genetic analysis that in the AON pathway, RDN1, functioning in the root, acts upstream of the receptor kinase SUNN, functioning in the shoot. As expected for a glycosyltransferase, we found that RDN1 and RDN2 proteins are localized to the Golgi, as was shown previously for AtHPAT1. Using composite plants with transgenic hairy roots, we show that RDN1 and RDN2 orthologs from dicots as well as a related RDN gene from rice can rescue the phenotype of rdn1-2 when expressed constitutively, but the less related MtRDN3 cannot. The timing of the induction of MtCLE12 and MtCLE13 peptide genes (negative regulators of AON) in nodulating roots is not altered by mutation of RDN1 or SUNN, although expression levels are higher. Plants with transgenic roots constitutively expressing MtCLE12 require both RDN1 and SUNN to prevent nodule formation, while plants constitutively expressing MtCLE13 require only SUNN, suggesting the two CLEs have different requirements for function. Combined with previous work, the data support a model in which RDN1 arabinosylates MtCLE12, and this modification is necessary for transport and/or reception of the AON signal by the SUNN kinase.
