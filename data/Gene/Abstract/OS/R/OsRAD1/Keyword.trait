OsRAD1	meiosis	The endonuclease homolog OsRAD1 promotes accurate meiotic double-strand break repair by suppressing non-homologous end joining.	In addition, OsRAD1 interacts directly with OsHUS1 and OsRAD9, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB repair during rice meiosis
OsRAD1	meiotic	The endonuclease homolog OsRAD1 promotes accurate meiotic double-strand break repair by suppressing non-homologous end joining.	The endonuclease homolog OsRAD1 promotes accurate meiotic double-strand break repair by suppressing non-homologous end joining.
OsRAD1	meiotic	The endonuclease homolog OsRAD1 promotes accurate meiotic double-strand break repair by suppressing non-homologous end joining.	Here, we characterized a RAD1 homolog in rice (Oryza sativa) and obtained evidence that OsRAD1 is important for meiotic DSB repair
