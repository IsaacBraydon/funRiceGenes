NA	The endonuclease homolog OsRAD1 promotes accurate meiotic double-strand break repair by suppressing non-homologous end joining.	2016	Plant Physiol	Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology,Chinese Academy of Sciences CITY: Beijing STATE: Be China [CN].	During meiosis, programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generated to initiate homologous recombination (HR), which is crucial for faithful chromosome segregation. In yeast, RAD1 acts together with RAD9 and HUS1 to facilitate meiotic recombination via cell cycle checkpoint control. However, little is known about the meiotic functions of these proteins in higher eukaryotes. Here, we characterized a RAD1 homolog in rice (Oryza sativa) and obtained evidence that OsRAD1 is important for meiotic DSB repair. Loss of OsRAD1 led to abnormal chromosome association and fragmentation upon completion of homologous pairing and synapsis. These aberrant chromosome associations were independent of OsDMC1. We found that classical non-homologous end joining mediated by Ku70 accounted for most of ectopic associations in Osrad1. In addition, OsRAD1 interacts directly with OsHUS1 and OsRAD9, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB repair during rice meiosis. Together, these findings suggest that the 9-1-1 complex facilitates accurate meiotic recombination by suppressing non-homologous end joining during meiosis in rice.
