OsHUS1	OsRAD1	The endonuclease homolog OsRAD1 promotes accurate meiotic double-strand break repair by suppressing non-homologous end joining.	In addition, OsRAD1 interacts directly with OsHUS1 and OsRAD9, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB repair during rice meiosis
OsRAD1	OsRAD17	OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.	 OsRAD17 interacts with OsRAD1 and the meiotic phenotype of Osrad1 Osrad17 is indistinguishable from the two single mutants which have similar phenotypes, manifesting they could act in the same pathway
OsRAD1	OsRAD17	OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.	 Similar phenotypes were observed in the Osmsh5 Osrad17 and Osmer3 Osrad1 double mutants, suggesting the cooperation between the checkpoint proteins and ZMM proteins in assuring accurate HR in rice
