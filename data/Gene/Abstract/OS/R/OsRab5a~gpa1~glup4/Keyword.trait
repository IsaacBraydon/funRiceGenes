OsRab5a|gpa1|glup4	endosperm	OsRab5a regulates endomembrane organization and storage protein trafficking in rice endosperm cells	We conclude that OsRab5a plays an essential role in trafficking of storage protein to PBII, possibly as part of its function in organizing the endomembrane system in developing endosperm cells of rice
OsRab5a|gpa1|glup4	endosperm	OsRab5a regulates endomembrane organization and storage protein trafficking in rice endosperm cells	OsRab5a regulates endomembrane organization and storage protein trafficking in rice endosperm cells
OsRab5a|gpa1|glup4	endosperm	The small GTPase Rab5a is essential for intracellular transport of proglutelin from the Golgi apparatus to the protein storage vacuole and endosomal membrane organization in developing rice endosperm	These results indicate that the formation of the paramural bodies in glup4 endosperm was due to a significant disruption of endocytosis and membrane vesicular transport by Rab5a loss of function
OsRab5a|gpa1|glup4	endosperm	OsRab5a regulates endomembrane organization and storage protein trafficking in rice endosperm cells	Here, we report the isolation of a rice mutant, gpa1, that accumulates 57 kDa pro-glutelins in seeds and whose endosperm has a floury appearance
OsRab5a|gpa1|glup4	endosperm	OsRab5a regulates endomembrane organization and storage protein trafficking in rice endosperm cells	Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the gpa1 endosperm cells have an enlarged ER lumen and a smaller protein body II (PBII), and accumulated three types of newly generated subcellular structures
OsRab5a|gpa1|glup4	endosperm	OsRab5a regulates endomembrane organization and storage protein trafficking in rice endosperm cells	Moreover, a proportion of glutelins in the gpa1 endosperm cells were not delivered to PBII, and instead were mis-targeted to two of the newly generated structures or secreted
OsRab5a|gpa1|glup4	seed	OsRab5a regulates endomembrane organization and storage protein trafficking in rice endosperm cells	Here, we report the isolation of a rice mutant, gpa1, that accumulates 57 kDa pro-glutelins in seeds and whose endosperm has a floury appearance
