Rice glutelins are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as precursors (pro-glutelins), and are transported to protein storage vacuoles, where they are processed into mature proteins. The molecular basis of this process is largely unknown. Here, we report the isolation of a rice mutant, gpa1, that accumulates 57 kDa pro-glutelins in seeds and whose endosperm has a floury appearance. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the gpa1 endosperm cells have an enlarged ER lumen and a smaller protein body II (PBII), and accumulated three types of newly generated subcellular structures. Moreover, a proportion of glutelins in the gpa1 endosperm cells were not delivered to PBII, and instead were mis-targeted to two of the newly generated structures or secreted. The gene corresponding to the gpa1 mutation was found to be OsRab5a, which encodes a small GTPase. In Arabidopsis protoplasts, OsRab5a protein was found to co-localize predominantly with AtVSR2, a molecular marker for the pre-vacuolar compartments (PVC). We conclude that OsRab5a plays an essential role in trafficking of storage protein to PBII, possibly as part of its function in organizing the endomembrane system in developing endosperm cells of rice.
60_568.pdf	Gene-gene interactions between mutants that accumulate abnormally high amounts of proglutelin in rice seed	2010	Breeding Science	Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University	We had previously identified eight mutants, esp2 and g(G)lups1 to 7, which accumulated abnormally high amounts of proglutelin, the major storage protein in rice seeds. Analysis of their seed proteins by SDS-PAGE, their levels of the luminal chaperone BiP and gene-gene interactions indicated that these mutants fell into four classes. The most epistatic class consisted of esp2, which encodes a defective protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). A second class consisting of Glup1, glup2 and glup7 was hypostatic to esp2, and showed abnormally high levels of BiP, suggesting that maturation and export of proglutelins from the ER are inhibited in this class of mutants. The third class containing glup4, Glup5 and glup6 mutations was hypostatic to esp2, Glup1, glup2 and glup7. Since the glup4 allele encodes the small GTPase Rab5a, which participates in the trafficking of proglutelin from Golgi apparatus to the protein storage vacuole (PSV), this third class of mutants is likely affected in this process. Lastly, glup3, which encodes a vacuolar processing enzyme, which proteolytically processes proglutelin into acidic and basic subunits within the PSV, was hypostatic to the other mutants. Overall, these gene relationships are consistent with the sequential intracellular transport and processing of proglutelin and provide novel insights on the trafficking of proglutelin to the PSV.
Plant Physiol.-2011-Fukuda-632-44.pdf	The small GTPase Rab5a is essential for intracellular transport of proglutelin from the Golgi apparatus to the protein storage vacuole and endosomal membrane organization in developing rice endosperm	2011	Plant Physiol	Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan.	Rice (Oryza sativa) glutelins are synthesized on the endoplasmic reticulum as larger precursors, which are then transported via the Golgi to the protein storage vacuole (PSV), where they are processed into acidic and basic subunits. Three independent glutelin precursor mutant4 (glup4) rice lines, which accumulated elevated levels of proglutelin over the wild type, were identified as loss-of-function mutants of Rab5a, the small GTPase involved in vesicular membrane transport. In addition to the plasma membrane, Rab5a colocalizes with glutelins on the Golgi apparatus, Golgi-derived dense vesicles, and the PSV, suggesting that Rab5a participates in the transport of the proglutelin from the Golgi to the PSV. This spatial distribution pattern was dramatically altered in the glup4 mutants. Numerous smaller protein bodies containing glutelin and alpha-globulin were evident, and the proteins were secreted extracellularly. Moreover, all three independent glup4 allelic lines displayed the novel appearance of a large dilated, structurally complex paramural body containing proglutelins, alpha-globulins, membrane biomarkers for the Golgi apparatus, prevacuolar compartment, PSV, and the endoplasmic reticulum luminal chaperones BiP and protein disulfide isomerase as well as beta-glucan. These results indicate that the formation of the paramural bodies in glup4 endosperm was due to a significant disruption of endocytosis and membrane vesicular transport by Rab5a loss of function. Overall, Rab5a is required not only for the intracellular transport of proglutelins from the Golgi to the PSV in rice endosperm but also in the maintenance of the general structural organization of the endomembrane system in developing rice seeds.
