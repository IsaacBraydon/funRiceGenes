Kim-2010-Zinc finger-containi.pdf	Zinc finger-containing glycine-rich RNA-binding protein in Oryza sativa has an RNA chaperone activity under cold stress conditions	2010	Plant Cell Environ	Department of Plant Biotechnology and Agricultural Plant Stress Research Center, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Chonnam National University, 300 Yongbong-dong, Buk-gu, Gwangju 500-757, Korea.	The rice (Oryza sativa) genome harbours three genes encoding CysCysHisCys (CCHC)-type zinc finger-containing glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins, designated OsRZ proteins, but their importance and physiological functions remain largely unknown. Here, the stress-responsive expression patterns of OsRZs were assessed, and the biological and cellular functions of OsRZs were evaluated under low temperature conditions. The expression levels of the three OsRZs were up-regulated by cold stress, whereas drought or high salt stress did not significantly alter its transcript level. OsRZ2 complemented the cold sensitivity of BX04 Escherichia coli cells under low temperatures, and had DNA-melting activity and transcription anti-termination activity, thereby indicating that OsRZ2 possesses an RNA chaperone activity. By contrast, neither OsRZ1 nor OsRZ3 harboured these activities. Ectopic expression of OsRZ2, but not OsRZ3, in cold-sensitive Arabidopsis grp7 knockout plants rescued the grp7 plants from cold and freezing damage, and OsRZ2 complemented the defect in mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in grp7 mutant during cold stress. The present findings support the emerging idea that the regulation of mRNA export is one of the adaptive processes in plants under stress conditions, and RNA chaperone functions as a regulator in mRNA export under cold stress conditions.
Xu-2013-Structural features.pdf	Structural features important for the RNA chaperone activity of zinc finger-containing glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins from wheat (Triticum avestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa)	2013	Phytochemistry	Department of Plant Biotechnology and Kumho Life Science Laboratory, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 500-757, Republic of Korea.	Despite the increase in understanding of RNA chaperone activity of zinc finger-containing glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins (RZs) during the cold adaptation process, the structural features relevant to the RNA chaperone activity of RZs still largely remain to be established. To investigate the structural determinants important for the RNA chaperone activity of RZs, domain-swapping and deletion analyses was carried out to assess the contribution of the N-terminal zinc finger RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domain and the C-terminal glycine-rich region of wheat (Triticum avestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa) RZs to RNA chaperone activity. Although the amino acid sequence similarity among wheat TaRZ2, wheat TaRZ3, and rice OsRZ1 was high, only TaRZ2 had RNA chaperone activity as evidenced by complementation ability in cold-sensitive Escherichia coli mutant cell under cold stress and in vivo and in vitro nucleic acid-melting activity. Domain-swapping and deletion analysis demonstrated that the overall folding of RZs governed by the N-terminal RRM domain and the C-terminal glycine-rich region, as well as the size of the disordered C-terminal glycine-rich region, are crucial for the RNA chaperone activity of RZs. Collectively, these results indicate that a specific modular arrangement of RRM domain and the disordered C-terminal region determines the RNA chaperone activity of RZs in cells.
