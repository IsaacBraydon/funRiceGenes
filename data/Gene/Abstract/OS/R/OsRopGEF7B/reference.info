RAC/ROP GTPase are versatile signaling molecules controlling diverse biological processes including cell polarity establishment, cell growth, morphogenesis, hormone responses and many other cellular processes in plants. The activities of ROPs are positively regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Evidence suggests that RopGEFs regulate polar auxin transport and polar growth in pollen tube in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the biological functions of rice RopGEFs during plant development remain largely unknown.We investigated a member of the OsRopGEF family, namely OsRopGEF7B. OsRopGEF7Bpro:GUS analysis indicates that OsRopGEF7B is expressed in various tissues, especially in the floral meristem and floral organ primordia. Knock-out and -down of OsRopGEF7B by T-DNA insertion and RNA interference, respectively, predominantly caused an increase in the number of floral organs in the inner whorls (stamen and ovary), as well as abnormal paleae/lemmas and ectopic growth of lodicules, resulting in decline of rice seed setting. Bimolecular fluorescence complement (BiFC) assays as well as yeast two-hybrid assays indicate that OsRopGEF7B interacts with OsRACs.OsRopGEF7B plays roles in floral organ development in rice, affecting rice seed setting rate. Manipulation of OsRopGEF7B has potential for application in genetically modified crops.
