OsRopGEF7B	growth	Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor 7B (RopGEF7B) is involved in floral organ development in Oryza sativa.	 Knock-out and -down of OsRopGEF7B by T-DNA insertion and RNA interference, respectively, predominantly caused an increase in the number of floral organs in the inner whorls (stamen and ovary), as well as abnormal paleae/lemmas and ectopic growth of lodicules, resulting in decline of rice seed setting
OsRopGEF7B	development	Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor 7B (RopGEF7B) is involved in floral organ development in Oryza sativa.	OsRopGEF7B plays roles in floral organ development in rice, affecting rice seed setting rate
