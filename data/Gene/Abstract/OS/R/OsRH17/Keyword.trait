OsRH17	pollen	A rice DEAD-box RNA helicase protein, OsRH17, suppresses 16S ribosomal RNA maturation in Escherichia coli.	 OsRH17 was specifically expressed in pollen and differentiated callus and upregulated by application of the plant hormones naphthyl acetic acid (NAA) and abscisic acid (ABA)
OsRH17	biotic stress	A rice DEAD-box RNA helicase protein, OsRH17, suppresses 16S ribosomal RNA maturation in Escherichia coli.	 No visible phenotype was observed in transgenic yeast and rice (overexpressing OsRH17, N-427, and C-167, as well as OsRH17 knockdown), and even in some abiotic and biotic stresses, which could be due to the redundancy in rice under normal conditions
OsRH17	abscisic acid	A rice DEAD-box RNA helicase protein, OsRH17, suppresses 16S ribosomal RNA maturation in Escherichia coli.	 OsRH17 was specifically expressed in pollen and differentiated callus and upregulated by application of the plant hormones naphthyl acetic acid (NAA) and abscisic acid (ABA)
