NA	Suppression of OsRAD51D results in defects in reproductive development in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2014	Plant J	Department of Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, 120-749, Korea.	The cellular roles of RAD51 paralogs in somatic and reproductive growth have been extensively described in a wide range of animal systems and, to a lesser extent, in Arabidopsis, a dicot model plant. Here, the OsRAD51D gene was identified and characterized in rice (Oryza sativa L.), a monocot model crop. In the rice genome, three alternative OsRAD51D mRNA splicing variants, OsRAD51D.1, OsRAD51D.2, and OsRAD51D.3, were predicted. Yeast two-hybrid studies, however, showed that only OsRAD51D.1 interacted with OsRAD51B and OsRAD51C paralogs, suggesting that OsRAD51D.1 is a functional OsRAD51D protein in rice. Loss-of-function osrad51d mutant rice plants displayed normal vegetative growth. However, the mutant plants were defective in reproductive growth, resulting in sterile flowers. Homozygous osrad51d mutant flowers exhibited impaired development of lemma and palea and contained unusual numbers of stamens and stigmas. During early meiosis, osrad51d pollen mother cells (PMCs) failed to form normal homologous chromosome pairings. In subsequent meiotic progression, mutant PMCs represented fragmented chromosomes. The osrad51d pollen cells contained numerous abnormal micro-nuclei that resulted in malfunctioning pollen. The abnormalities of heterozygous mutant and T2 Ubi:RNAi-OsRAD51D RNAi-knock-down transgenic plants were intermediate between those of wild type and homozygous mutant plants. The osrad51d and Ubi:RNAi-OsRAD51D plants contained longer telomeres compared with wild type plants, indicating that OsRAD51D is a negative factor for telomere lengthening. Overall, these results suggest that OsRAD51D plays a critical role in reproductive growth in rice. This essential function of OsRAD51D is distinct from Arabidopsis, in which AtRAD51D is not an essential factor for meiosis or reproductive development.
NA	OsRAD51D promotes homologous pairing and recombination by preventing non-homologous interactions in rice meiosis.	2020	New Phytol	State Key Lab of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100101, Beijing, China.	Homologous recombination (HR) is carefully orchestrated to maintain genome integrity. RAD51D has been previously shown to be essential for double-strand break (DSB) repair in mammalian somatic cells. However, the function of RAD51D during meiosis is largely unknown. Here, through detailed analyses of Osrad51d single and double mutants, we pinpoint the specific function of OsRAD51D in coordinating homologous pairing and recombination by preventing non-homologous interactions during meiosis. OsRAD51D is associated with telomeres in both meiocytes and somatic cells. Loss of OsRAD51D leads to significant induction of non-homologous pairing and chromosome entanglements, suggesting its role in suppressing non-homologous interactions. The failed localization of OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 in Osrad51d, together with the genetic analysis of Osrad51d Osdmc1a Osdmc1b, indicates that OsRAD51D acts at a very early stage of HR. Observations from the Osrad51d pair1 and Osrad51d ku70 double mutants further demonstrate that non-homologous interactions require DSB formation, but do not depend on the KU70-mediated repair pathway. Moreover, the interplay between OsRAD51D and OsRAD51C indicates both conservation and divergence of their functions in meiosis. Altogether, this work reveals that OsRAD51D plays an essential role in the inhibition of non-homologous connections, thus guaranteeing faithful pairing and recombination during meiosis.

NA	RAD51C-RAD51D interplays with MSH5 and regulates crossover maturation in rice meiosis.	2023	New Phytol	Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Regulation Biology of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China.	Meiotic crossovers ensure accurate chromosome segregation and increase genetic diversity. RAD51C and RAD51D play an early role in facilitating RAD51 during homologous recombination. However, their later function in meiosis is largely unknown in plants. Here, through targeted disruption of RAD51C and RAD51D, we generated three new mutants and revealed their later meiotic role in crossover maturation. The rad51c-3 and rad51d-4 mutants showed a mixture of bivalents and univalents and no chromosomal entanglements, whereas rad51d-5 exhibited an intermediate phenotype with reduced chromosomal entanglements and increased bivalent formation compared with knockout alleles. Comparisons of RAD51 loadings and chromosomal entanglements in these single mutants, rad51c-3 rad51d-4, rad51c-3 dmc1a dmc1b, and rad51d-4 dmc1a dmc1b suggest that the retained level of RAD51 in mutants is required for uncovering their function in crossover formation. Reductions in chiasma frequency and later HEI10 foci in these mutants support that crossover maturation requires RAD51C and RAD51D. Moreover, interaction between RAD51D and MSH5 indicates that RAD51 paralogs may cooperate with MSH5 to ensure accurate Holliday junction processing into crossover products. This finding of the role of RAD51 paralogs in crossover control may be conserved from mammals to plants and advances our current understanding of these proteins.
