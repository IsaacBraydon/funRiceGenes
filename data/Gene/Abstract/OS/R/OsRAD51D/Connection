The failed localization of OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 in Osrad51d, together with the genetic analysis of Osrad51d Osdmc1a Osdmc1b, indicates that OsRAD51D acts at a very early stage of HR

OsRAD51D	PAIR1	OsRAD51D promotes homologous pairing and recombination by preventing non-homologous interactions in rice meiosis.	 Observations from the Osrad51d pair1 and Osrad51d ku70 double mutants further demonstrate that non-homologous interactions require DSB formation, but do not depend on the KU70-mediated repair pathway
