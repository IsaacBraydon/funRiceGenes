OsRBGD3	Heterologous expression of rice RNA-binding glycine-rich (RBG) gene OsRBGD3 in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana confers cold stress tolerance. |  OsRBGD3 exhibited cold, drought and salt stress inductive expression in a drought tolerant N22 rice cultivar as compared with susceptible variety IR64 |  Constitutive overexpression of the OsRBGD3 in transgenic Arabidopsis conferred tolerance to cold stress |  OsRBGD3 overexpression also attributed to significant root development and early flowering in transgenics	 Constitutive overexpression of the OsRBGD3 in transgenic Arabidopsis conferred tolerance to cold stress |  OsRBGD3 overexpression also attributed to significant root development and early flowering in transgenics
