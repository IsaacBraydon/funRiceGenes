OsRPT4	cell cycle	Rice ROOT ARCHITECTURE ASSOCIATED1 binds the proteasome subunit RPT4 and is degraded in a D-box and proteasome-dependent manner.	Since yeast two-hybrid results indicated that OsRAA1 interacts with OsRPT4, which is a known cell cycle regulator, we investigated the cell cycle in transgenic roots to unveil the mechanism of OsRAA1 regulation in root growth.
