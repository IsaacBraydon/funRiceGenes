OsPAO	OsRCCR1	Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice	 In this report, a single PAO gene (OsPAO) and two RCCR genes (OsRCCR1 and OsRCCR2) have been isolated from rice
OsPAO	OsRCCR1	Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice	 These results suggest that OsPAO and OsRCCR1 play key roles in senescence and are involved in wound responses
