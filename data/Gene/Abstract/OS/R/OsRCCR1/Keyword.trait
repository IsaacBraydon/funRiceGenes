OsRCCR1	senescence	Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice	 Expression analysis by semi-quantitative PCR or quantitative real-time PCR showed that OsRCCR1 transcripts were much more abundant than OsRCCR2, and all of these genes were upregulated during senescence and following wound treatment
OsRCCR1	senescence	Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice	 These results suggest that OsPAO and OsRCCR1 play key roles in senescence and are involved in wound responses
