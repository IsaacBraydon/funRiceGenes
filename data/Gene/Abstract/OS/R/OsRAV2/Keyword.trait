OsRAV2	salt	Identification of a regulatory element responsible for salt induction of rice OsRAV2 through ex situ and in situ promoter analysis.	Identification of a regulatory element responsible for salt induction of rice OsRAV2 through ex situ and in situ promoter analysis.
OsRAV2	salt	Identification of a regulatory element responsible for salt induction of rice OsRAV2 through ex situ and in situ promoter analysis.	 Transgenic analysis indicated that P OsRAV2 is induced by salt stress but not osmotic stress or ABA treatment
OsRAV2	salt	Identification of a regulatory element responsible for salt induction of rice OsRAV2 through ex situ and in situ promoter analysis.	 Serial 5' deletions and site-specific mutations in P OsRAV2 revealed that a GT-1 element located at position -664 relative to the putative translation start site is essential for the salt induction of P OsRAV2 
OsRAV2	salt	Identification of a regulatory element responsible for salt induction of rice OsRAV2 through ex situ and in situ promoter analysis.	 The regulatory function of the GT-1 element in the salt induction of OsRAV2 was verified in situ in plants with targeted mutations generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) system
OsRAV2	salt	Identification of a regulatory element responsible for salt induction of rice OsRAV2 through ex situ and in situ promoter analysis.	 Taken together, our results indicate that the GT-1 element directly controls the salt response of OsRAV2
OsRAV2	 ABA 	Identification of a regulatory element responsible for salt induction of rice OsRAV2 through ex situ and in situ promoter analysis.	 Further expression profile analyses indicated that OsRAV2 is transcriptionally regulated by salt, but not KCl, osmotic stress, cold or ABA (abscisic acid) treatment
OsRAV2	 ABA 	Identification of a regulatory element responsible for salt induction of rice OsRAV2 through ex situ and in situ promoter analysis.	 Transgenic analysis indicated that P OsRAV2 is induced by salt stress but not osmotic stress or ABA treatment
OsRAV2	salt stress	Identification of a regulatory element responsible for salt induction of rice OsRAV2 through ex situ and in situ promoter analysis.	 Transgenic analysis indicated that P OsRAV2 is induced by salt stress but not osmotic stress or ABA treatment
OsRAV2	stress	Identification of a regulatory element responsible for salt induction of rice OsRAV2 through ex situ and in situ promoter analysis.	 To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of the stress response at the transcriptional level, we isolated and characterized the promoter region of OsRAV2 (P OsRAV2 )
OsRAV2	stress	Identification of a regulatory element responsible for salt induction of rice OsRAV2 through ex situ and in situ promoter analysis.	 Transgenic analysis indicated that P OsRAV2 is induced by salt stress but not osmotic stress or ABA treatment
OsRAV2	ABA	Identification of a regulatory element responsible for salt induction of rice OsRAV2 through ex situ and in situ promoter analysis.	 Further expression profile analyses indicated that OsRAV2 is transcriptionally regulated by salt, but not KCl, osmotic stress, cold or ABA (abscisic acid) treatment
OsRAV2	ABA	Identification of a regulatory element responsible for salt induction of rice OsRAV2 through ex situ and in situ promoter analysis.	 Transgenic analysis indicated that P OsRAV2 is induced by salt stress but not osmotic stress or ABA treatment
OsRAV2	abscisic acid	Identification of a regulatory element responsible for salt induction of rice OsRAV2 through ex situ and in situ promoter analysis.	 Further expression profile analyses indicated that OsRAV2 is transcriptionally regulated by salt, but not KCl, osmotic stress, cold or ABA (abscisic acid) treatment
OsRAV2	stress response	Identification of a regulatory element responsible for salt induction of rice OsRAV2 through ex situ and in situ promoter analysis.
