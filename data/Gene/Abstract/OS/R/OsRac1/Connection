Hsp90|rHsp90	OsRac1	The Hop/Sti1-Hsp90 chaperone complex facilitates the maturation and transport of a PAMP receptor in rice innate immunity	 Further, Hop/Sti1 and Hsp90 are present at the PM in a complex (designated the "defensome") with OsRac1, a plant-specific Rho-type GTPase
OsRac1	OsRopGEF10|BGL	The rice bright green leaf (bgl) locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces	 In yeast two-hybrid assays, OsRopGEF10 interacts with OsRac1, one of seven OsRac proteins; consistent with this, both proteins are localized in the plasma membrane| These results suggest that OsRopGEF10 activates OsRac1 to turn on the molecular signaling pathway for SP development
OsRac1	OsSWAP70A	SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice	 OsSWAP70A interacted with rice Rho GTPase OsRac1, an important signaling factor for immune responses| The DH domain of OsSWAP70A exhibited the GEF-catalytic activity toward OsRac1 as found in animal Rho GEFs, indicating that plants have the functional DH domains| Transient expression of OsSWAP70A enhanced OsRac1-mediated production of reactive oxygen species in planta
OsRac1	OsRACK1A	Proteome analysis of detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) associated with OsRac1-mediated innate immunity in rice	 To examine the possible association of DRMs and OsRac1-mediated innate immunity, we used rice suspension-cultured cells transformed with myc-tagged wild-type (WT) OsRac1 and found that OsRac1 and RACK1A, an effector of OsRac1, shifted to the DRMs after chitin elicitor treatment
OsRac1	OsRACK1A	RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex	 Rice contains two RACK1 genes, RACK1A and RACK1B, and the RACK1A protein interacts with the GTP form of Rac1| Rac1 positively regulates RACK1A at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels| These results suggest that RACK1A functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with multiple proteins in the Rac1 immune complex
OsRac1	RACK1B|OsWD40-122	RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex	 Rice contains two RACK1 genes, RACK1A and RACK1B, and the RACK1A protein interacts with the GTP form of Rac1
OsCCR1	OsRac1	Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in lignin biosynthesis, is an effector of small GTPase Rac in defense signaling in rice	 We have identified an effector of OsRac1, namely rice (Oryza sativa) cinnamoyl-CoA reductase 1 (OsCCR1), an enzyme involved in lignin biosynthesis| In in vitro interaction and two-hybrid experiments, OsRac1 was shown to bind OsCCR1 in a GTP-dependent manner| Moreover, the interaction of OsCCR1 with OsRac1 led to the enzymatic activation of OsCCR1 in vitro| Thus, it is likely that OsRac1 controls lignin synthesis through regulation of both NADPH oxidase and OsCCR1 activities during defense responses in rice
OsMT2b	OsRac1	Down-regulation of metallothionein, a reactive oxygen scavenger, by the small GTPase OsRac1 in rice	 We found that the expression of a metallothionein gene (OsMT2b) was synergically down-regulated by OsRac1 and rice (Oryza sativa) blast-derived elicitors| Taken together, these results showed that OsMT2b is an ROS scavenger and its expression is down-regulated by OsRac1, thus potentiating ROS, which function as signals in resistance response
D1|RGA1	OsRac1	The heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit acts upstream of the small GTPase Rac in disease resistance of rice	 Expression of the constitutively active OsRac1, a small GTPase Rac of rice, in d1 mutants restored SE-dependent defense signaling and resistance to rice blast
Hsp90|rHsp90	OsRac1	RAR1 and HSP90 form a complex with Rac/Rop GTPase and function in innate-immune responses in rice	 In this study, we examined the functional relationships between Os Rac1, RAR1, and HSP90| Coimmunoprecipitation experiments with rice cell culture extracts indicate that Rac1 forms a complex with RAR1, HSP90, and HSP70 in vivo| Studies with Os RAR1-RNAi and treatment with geldanamycin, an HSP90-specific inhibitor, showed that RAR1 and HSP90 are essential for the Rac1-mediated enhancement of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immune responses in rice cell cultures| Furthermore, the function of HSP90, but not RAR1, may be essential for their association with the Rac1 complex| Together, our results indicate that Rac1, RAR1, HSP90, and HSP70 form one or more protein complexes in rice cells and suggest that these proteins play important roles in innate immunity in rice
OsRac1	OsRAR1	RAR1 and HSP90 form a complex with Rac/Rop GTPase and function in innate-immune responses in rice	 In this study, we examined the functional relationships between Os Rac1, RAR1, and HSP90| Constitutively active Os Rac1 complemented the loss of resistance, suggesting that Os Rac1 and RAR1 are functionally linked| Coimmunoprecipitation experiments with rice cell culture extracts indicate that Rac1 forms a complex with RAR1, HSP90, and HSP70 in vivo| Studies with Os RAR1-RNAi and treatment with geldanamycin, an HSP90-specific inhibitor, showed that RAR1 and HSP90 are essential for the Rac1-mediated enhancement of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immune responses in rice cell cultures| Furthermore, the function of HSP90, but not RAR1, may be essential for their association with the Rac1 complex| Os Rac1 also regulates RAR1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels| Together, our results indicate that Rac1, RAR1, HSP90, and HSP70 form one or more protein complexes in rice cells and suggest that these proteins play important roles in innate immunity in rice
