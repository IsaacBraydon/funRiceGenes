OsRZFP34	leaf	Expression of a gene encoding a rice RING zinc-finger protein, OsRZFP34, enhances stomata opening.	Analysis of water loss and leaf temperature under stress conditions revealed a higher evaporation rate and cooling effect in OsRZFP34-overexpressing Arabidopsis and rice than the wild type, atrzfp34 and osrzfp34
OsRZFP34	leaf	Expression of a gene encoding a rice RING zinc-finger protein, OsRZFP34, enhances stomata opening.	Thus, stomata opening, enhanced leaf cooling, and ABA insensitivity was conserved with OsRZFP34 expression
OsRZFP34	temperature	Expression of a gene encoding a rice RING zinc-finger protein, OsRZFP34, enhances stomata opening.	Analysis of water loss and leaf temperature under stress conditions revealed a higher evaporation rate and cooling effect in OsRZFP34-overexpressing Arabidopsis and rice than the wild type, atrzfp34 and osrzfp34
OsRZFP34	 ABA 	Expression of a gene encoding a rice RING zinc-finger protein, OsRZFP34, enhances stomata opening.	As compared with the wild type, rice and Arabidopsis with OsRZFP34 overexpression showed increased relative stomata opening even with ABA treatment
OsRZFP34	 ABA 	Expression of a gene encoding a rice RING zinc-finger protein, OsRZFP34, enhances stomata opening.	Thus, stomata opening, enhanced leaf cooling, and ABA insensitivity was conserved with OsRZFP34 expression
OsRZFP34	stress	Expression of a gene encoding a rice RING zinc-finger protein, OsRZFP34, enhances stomata opening.	Analysis of water loss and leaf temperature under stress conditions revealed a higher evaporation rate and cooling effect in OsRZFP34-overexpressing Arabidopsis and rice than the wild type, atrzfp34 and osrzfp34
OsRZFP34	stomatal	Expression of a gene encoding a rice RING zinc-finger protein, OsRZFP34, enhances stomata opening.	Transcription profiling of transgenic rice overexpressing OsRZFP34 revealed many genes involved in OsRZFP34-mediated stomatal movement
OsRZFP34	stomata	Expression of a gene encoding a rice RING zinc-finger protein, OsRZFP34, enhances stomata opening.	As compared with the wild type, rice and Arabidopsis with OsRZFP34 overexpression showed increased relative stomata opening even with ABA treatment
OsRZFP34	stomata	Expression of a gene encoding a rice RING zinc-finger protein, OsRZFP34, enhances stomata opening.	Furthermore, loss-of-function mutation of OsRZFP34 and AtRZFP34 (At5g22920), an OsRZFP34 homolog in Arabidopsis, decreased relative stomata aperture under nonstress control conditions
OsRZFP34	stomata	Expression of a gene encoding a rice RING zinc-finger protein, OsRZFP34, enhances stomata opening.	Thus, stomata opening, enhanced leaf cooling, and ABA insensitivity was conserved with OsRZFP34 expression
OsRZFP34	stomata	Expression of a gene encoding a rice RING zinc-finger protein, OsRZFP34, enhances stomata opening.	We suggest that OsRZFP34 may modulate these genes to control stomata opening
OsRZFP34	water loss	Expression of a gene encoding a rice RING zinc-finger protein, OsRZFP34, enhances stomata opening.	Analysis of water loss and leaf temperature under stress conditions revealed a higher evaporation rate and cooling effect in OsRZFP34-overexpressing Arabidopsis and rice than the wild type, atrzfp34 and osrzfp34
