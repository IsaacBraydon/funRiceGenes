Osr40c1	drought	Rice lectin protein Osr40c1 imparts drought tolerance by modulating OsSAM2, OsSAP8 and chromatin-associated proteins	Rice lectin protein Osr40c1 imparts drought tolerance by modulating OsSAM2, OsSAP8 and chromatin-associated proteins
Osr40c1	drought	Rice lectin protein Osr40c1 imparts drought tolerance by modulating OsSAM2, OsSAP8 and chromatin-associated proteins	 In this study, it has been depicted that expression of Osr40c1 gene correlates with the drought tolerance potential of various rice cultivars
Osr40c1	drought	Rice lectin protein Osr40c1 imparts drought tolerance by modulating OsSAM2, OsSAP8 and chromatin-associated proteins	 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing Osr40c1 were significantly more tolerant to drought stress over the wild-type plants
Osr40c1	drought	Rice lectin protein Osr40c1 imparts drought tolerance by modulating OsSAM2, OsSAP8 and chromatin-associated proteins	 Silencing of each of these protein partners led to drought sensitivity in the otherwise tolerant Osr40c1 expressing transgenic tobacco lines indicating that these partners were crucial for the Osr40c1-mediated drought tolerance in planta
