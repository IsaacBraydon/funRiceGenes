Osr40c1	 In this study, it has been depicted that expression of Osr40c1 gene correlates with the drought tolerance potential of various rice cultivars |  Furthermore, ectopic expression of the Osr40c1 gene in tobacco yielded a similar result |  Together, the present investigation delineated the novel role of Osr40c1 protein in imparting drought tolerance by regulating OsMNB1B, OsSAM2, and OsH4 proteins, which presumably enables OsSAP8 to induce downstream gene expression
