Osr40c1	OsSAM2	Rice lectin protein Osr40c1 imparts drought tolerance by modulating OsSAM2, OsSAP8 and chromatin-associated proteins	 Together, the present investigation delineated the novel role of Osr40c1 protein in imparting drought tolerance by regulating OsMNB1B, OsSAM2, and OsH4 proteins, which presumably enables OsSAP8 to induce downstream gene expression
