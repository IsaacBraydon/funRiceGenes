Replication protein A (RPA), which is comprised of three subunits, is an important factor involved in DNA replication, repair, and transcription. We isolated and characterized 70 and 32 kDa subunits of RPA from rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) termed OsRPA70a and OsRPA32. OsRPA70a shows a low level of homology with OsRPA1 which was isolated from deepwater rice (Oryza sativa cv. Pin Gaew 56), previously. We also succeeded to isolate OsRPA70b which is homologue to OsRPA1 from Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare. OsRPA70a shows only 33.8% sequence identity with OsRPA70b, indicating that two different types of 70 kDa RPA subunits are present in Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare. These subunits showed differences in their expression patterns among tissues. The transcripts of OsRPA70a and OsRPA32 were expressed strongly in proliferating tissues such as root tips and young leaves that contain root apical meristem and marginal meristem, respectively, and weakly in the mature leaves which have no proliferating tissues. On the other hand, OsRPA70b was expressed mostly in the proliferating tissues. The roles of these molecules in plant DNA replication and DNA repair are discussed.

Replication protein A (RPA) is a protein complex composed of three subunits known as RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14. Generally, only one version of each of the three RPA genes is present in animals and yeast (with the exception of the human RPA32 ortholog). In rice (Oryza sativa L.), however, two paralogs of RPA70 have been reported. We screened the rice genome for RPA subunit genes, and identified three OsRPA70 (OsRPA70a, OsRPA70b and OsRPA70c), three OsRPA32 (OsRPA32-1, OsRPA32-2 and OsRPA32-3), and one OsRPA14. Through two-hybrid assays and pull down analyses, we showed that OsRPA70a interacted preferentially with OsRPA32-2, OsRPA70b with OsRPA32-1, and OsRPA70c with OsRPA32-3. OsRPA14 interacted with all OsRPA32 paralogs. Thus, rice has three types of RPA complex: OsRPA70a-OsRPA32-2-OsRPA14 (type A), OsRPA70b-OsRPA32-1-OsRPA14 (type B), and OsRPA70c-OsRPA32-3-OsRPA14 (type C). Subcellular localization analysis suggested that the type-A RPA complex is required for chloroplast DNA metabolism, whereas types B and C function in nuclear DNA metabolism.
