OsMY1	OsRacD|OsRac5	Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L	By yeast two-hybrid assay, it is confirmed that OsMY1 binds both the wild type (WT) and constitutively active (CA) OsRac5, but does not interact with dominantly negative OsRac5
OsMY1	OsRacD|OsRac5	Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L	In addition, the interactions between OsMY1 and WT-OsRac5 or CA-OsRac5 in vivo are demonstrated by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay
OsMY1	OsRacD|OsRac5	Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L	Using PCR-mediated sequence deletion and point mutation of OsMY1, the interaction between OsMY1 and OsRac5 was identified to be mediated by the coiled-coil domain in OsMY1, and their binding was quantified by O-nitro-phenyl-Î²-D-galactopyranoside assay
OsMY1	OsRacD|OsRac5	Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L	Real-time PCR shows that OsMY1 and OsRac5 are coordinately expressed in rice leaves and panicles with similar expression patterns
OsMY1	OsRacD|OsRac5	Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L	Our results suggest that OsMY1 is an important target of OsRac5 and that these two genes are involved in the same biological processes in rice growth and development
