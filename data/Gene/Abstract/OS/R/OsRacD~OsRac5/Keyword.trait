OsRacD|OsRac5	sterility	Isolation of osRACD gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice	 Evidence from RT-PCR study indicates that osRACD gene is related to photoperiod fertility conversion of photoperiod sensitive genic male sterility (PSGMS) rice
OsRacD|OsRac5	fertility	Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L	OsRac5 belongs to the rice Rho of plants family, and acts as the molecular switch in the signal pathway which is pivotally involved in the rice fertility control
OsRacD|OsRac5	growth	Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L	 Our results suggest that OsMY1 is an important target of OsRac5 and that these two genes are involved in the same biological processes in rice growth and development
OsRacD|OsRac5	panicle	Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L	 Real-time PCR shows that OsMY1 and OsRac5 are coordinately expressed in rice leaves and panicles with similar expression patterns
OsRacD|OsRac5	fertility	Structural analysis and identification of cis-elements of rice osRACD gene	The osRACD gene correlated with fertility transformation in the photoperiod sensitive genic male sterile rice (PGMR), Nongken 58S, encoded a rice (Oryza sativa L
OsRacD|OsRac5	sterile	Structural analysis and identification of cis-elements of rice osRACD gene	The osRACD gene correlated with fertility transformation in the photoperiod sensitive genic male sterile rice (PGMR), Nongken 58S, encoded a rice (Oryza sativa L
OsRacD|OsRac5	panicle	Isolation of osRACD gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice	 By screening cDNA library of the rice Nongken 58N panicle using the newly obtained fragment RDP-8 as probe, we further found the full-length cDNA of osRACD gene that encodes a rice small GTP-binding protein
OsRacD|OsRac5	fertility	Isolation of osRACD gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice	 Evidence from RT-PCR study indicates that osRACD gene is related to photoperiod fertility conversion of photoperiod sensitive genic male sterility (PSGMS) rice
