Acta Biochim Biophys Sin-2004-Xu-191-8.pdf	Structural analysis and identification of cis-elements of rice osRACD gene	2004	Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)	Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China.	The osRACD gene correlated with fertility transformation in the photoperiod sensitive genic male sterile rice (PGMR), Nongken 58S, encoded a rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) small GTPase belonging to the Rac/Rho family. Inverse PCR was performed to amplify a fragment about 1.4 kb in 5' upstream region of the osRACD promoter. Deletion mutation and gel mobility shift assay characterized two fragments (-799 to -686 nt, and -686 to -431 nt) in the osRACD promoter that could be involved in its transcriptional regulation. When these two deletion fragments were used as probe respectively, a retarded band appeared in the nuclear extracts of fertile 58S rice under short day (58S-SD). Whereas no retarded band was shown in the nuclear extracts of sterile 58S rice under long day (58S-LD). Competition assay indicated that the factors in the retarded bands binding to these two fragments were the same trans-acting factor (termed rice factor, RF). The binding affinity of RF was affected by phosphorylation and was higher in SD-growth rice than that of LD-growth rice.
Isolation of osRACD gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice.pdf	Isolation of osRACD gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice	2002	Chinese Science Bulletin	Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Dev Biol, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China	Using an improved version of mRNA differential display technology, we have obtained a differentially displayed fragment RDP-8. Homologous comparison indicated that the fragment RDP-8 has high homology with the gene encoding maize small GTP-binding protein. By screening cDNA library of the rice Nongken 58N panicle using the newly obtained fragment RDP-8 as probe, we further found the full-length cDNA of osRACD gene that encodes a rice small GTP-binding protein. As compared with maize RACD gene, the osRACD of rice shows remarkable homology in both nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence, 88% and 97% respectively. Evidence from RT-PCR study indicates that osRACD gene is related to photoperiod fertility conversion of photoperiod sensitive genic male sterility (PSGMS) rice.
s11033-014-3032-x.pdf	Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L	2014	Mol Biol Rep	College of Life Science, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang, 453007, China.	OsRac5 belongs to the rice Rho of plants family, and acts as the molecular switch in the signal pathway which is pivotally involved in the rice fertility control. One of its putative partners, OsMY1, was isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening from rice panicle cDNA library. Bioinformatics analysis shows that OsMY1 contains a coiled-coil domain which generally appeared in the partners of Rho GTPases. By yeast two-hybrid assay, it is confirmed that OsMY1 binds both the wild type (WT) and constitutively active (CA) OsRac5, but does not interact with dominantly negative OsRac5. In addition, the interactions between OsMY1 and WT-OsRac5 or CA-OsRac5 in vivo are demonstrated by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. Using PCR-mediated sequence deletion and point mutation of OsMY1, the interaction between OsMY1 and OsRac5 was identified to be mediated by the coiled-coil domain in OsMY1, and their binding was quantified by O-nitro-phenyl-Î²-D-galactopyranoside assay. Real-time PCR shows that OsMY1 and OsRac5 are coordinately expressed in rice leaves and panicles with similar expression patterns. Our results suggest that OsMY1 is an important target of OsRac5 and that these two genes are involved in the same biological processes in rice growth and development.
