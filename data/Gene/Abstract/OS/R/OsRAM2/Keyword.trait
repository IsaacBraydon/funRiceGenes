OsRAM2	mycorrhizal symbiosis	OsRAM2 function in lipid biosynthesis is required for arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice 	OsRAM2 function in lipid biosynthesis is required for arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice 
OsRAM2	symbiosis	OsRAM2 function in lipid biosynthesis is required for arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice 	OsRAM2 function in lipid biosynthesis is required for arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice 
OsRAM2	symbiosis	OsRAM2 function in lipid biosynthesis is required for arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice 	 Examining their expression patterns during symbiosis revealed that only OsRAM2 was strongly upregulated upon AMF inoculation
OsRAM2	magnaporthe oryzae	Colonization of mutualistic mycorrhizal and parasitic blast fungi requires OsRAM2-regulated fatty acid biosynthesis in rice.	 truncatula RAM2, and found that plants defective in OsRAM2 were unable to be colonized by AM fungi and showed impaired colonization by Magnaporthe oryzae
OsRAM2	fatty acid biosynthesis	Colonization of mutualistic mycorrhizal and parasitic blast fungi requires OsRAM2-regulated fatty acid biosynthesis in rice.	 Collectively, our data show that the function and regulation of OsRAM2 is conserved in monocot and dicot plants and reveals that, similar to mutualistic fungi, pathogenic fungi have recruited RAM2-mediated fatty acid biosynthesis to facilitate invasion
