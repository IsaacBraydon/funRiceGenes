Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) is a mutualistic symbiosis formed between most land plants and Glomeromycotina fungi. During the symbiosis, plants provide organic carbon to fungi in exchange for mineral nutrients. Previous legume studies showed that the Required for Arbuscular Mycorrhization2 (RAM2) gene is necessary for transferring lipids from plants to AM fungi (AMF) and is also likely to play a 'signaling' role at the root surface. To further explore RAM2 functions in other plant lineages, in this study, two rice (Oryza sativa) genes, OsRAM2 and OsRAM2L, were identified as orthologs of legume RAM2. Examining their expression patterns during symbiosis revealed that only OsRAM2 was strongly upregulated upon AMF inoculation. CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis was then performed to obtain three Osram2 mutant lines (-1, -2, and -3). After inoculation by AMF Rhizophagus irregularis or Funneliformis mosseae, all the mutant lines showed extremely low colonization rates and the rarely observed arbuscules were all defective, thus supporting a conserved 'nutritional' role of RAM2 between monocot and dicot lineages. As for the 'signaling' role, although the hyphopodia numbers formed by both AMF on Osram2 mutants were indeed reduced, their morphology showed no abnormality, with fungal hyphae invading roots successfully. Promoter activities further indicated OsRAM2 was not expressed in epidermal cells below hyphopodia or outer cortical cells enclosing fungal hyphae, but expressed exclusively in cortical cells containing arbuscules. It therefore suggested an indirect role of RAM2 rather than a direct involvement in determining the symbiosis signals at the root surface.
NA	Colonization of mutualistic mycorrhizal and parasitic blast fungi requires OsRAM2-regulated fatty acid biosynthesis in rice.	2021	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, 56690, Shanghai, China; etwang@sibs.ac.cn.	Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form a mutual association with the majority of land plants, including most angiosperms of the dicotyledon and monocotyledon lineages. The symbiosis is based upon bidirectional nutrient exchange between the host and symbiont that occurs between inner cortical cells of the root and branched AM hyphae called arbuscules that develop within these cells. Lipid transport and its regulation during the symbiosis have been intensively investigated in dicotyledon plants, especially legumes. Here, we characterize OsRAM2 and OsRAM2L, homologs of M. truncatula RAM2, and found that plants defective in OsRAM2 were unable to be colonized by AM fungi and showed impaired colonization by Magnaporthe oryzae. The induction of OsRAM2 and OsRAM2L is dependent on OsRAM1 and the CSSP pathway genes CCaMK and CYCLOPS, while overexpression of OsRAM1 results in increased expression of OsRAM2 and OsRAM2L. Collectively, our data show that the function and regulation of OsRAM2 is conserved in monocot and dicot plants and reveals that, similar to mutualistic fungi, pathogenic fungi have recruited RAM2-mediated fatty acid biosynthesis to facilitate invasion.
