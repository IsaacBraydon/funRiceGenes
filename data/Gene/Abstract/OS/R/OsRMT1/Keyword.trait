OsRMT1	salt	Molecular dissection of a rice microtubule-associated RING finger protein and its potential role in salt tolerance in Arabidopsis.	By contrast, OsRMT1 is predominantly found in the nucleus and microtubules and its degradation is inhibited under salt stress
OsRMT1	salt	Molecular dissection of a rice microtubule-associated RING finger protein and its potential role in salt tolerance in Arabidopsis.	Overexpression of OsRMT1 in Arabidopsis resulted in increased tolerance to salt stress
OsRMT1	salt	Molecular dissection of a rice microtubule-associated RING finger protein and its potential role in salt tolerance in Arabidopsis.	Our findings suggest that the abundance of microtubule-associated OsRMT1 is strictly regulated, and OsRMT1 may play a relevant role in salt stress response by modulating levels of its target proteins
