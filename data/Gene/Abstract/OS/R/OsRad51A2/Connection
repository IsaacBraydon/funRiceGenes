OsRad51|OsRad51A1	OsRad51A2	OsRAD51 Plays a Vital Role in Promoting Homologous Recombination in Rice Meiosis.	 Osrad51 (Osrad51a1 Osrad51a2) mutant plants show normal vegetative growth but exhibit complete sterility, indicating that OsRAD51A1 and OsRAD51A2 are functionally redundant in rice fertility
OsRad51|OsRad51A1	OsRad51A2	OsRAD51 Plays a Vital Role in Promoting Homologous Recombination in Rice Meiosis.	 Moreover, the Osrad51 Osdmc1 (Osrad51a1 Osrad51a2 Osdmc1a Osdmc1b) quadruple mutant PMCs exhibited similar defective phenotypes as Osrad51 in homologous pairing, synapsis, and DSB repair
