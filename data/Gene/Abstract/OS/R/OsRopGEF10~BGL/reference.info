Development of specialized epidermal cells and structures plays a key role in plant tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. In the paddy field, the bright green leaf (bgl) mutants of rice (Oryza sativa) exhibit a luminous green color that is clearly distinguishable from the normal green of wild-type plants. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy revealed that small cuticular papillae (or small papillae; SP), nipple-like structures, are absent on the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces of bgl mutants, leading to more direct reflection and less diffusion of green light. Map-based cloning revealed that the bgl locus encodes OsRopGEF10, one of eleven OsRopGEFs in rice. RopGEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rop) activate Rop/Rac GTPases, acting as molecular switches in eukaryotic signal transduction by replacing the bound GDP (inactive form) with GTP (active form) in response to external or internal cues. In agreement with the timing of SP initiation on the leaf epidermis, OsRopGEF10 is most strongly expressed in newly developing leaves before emergence from the leaf sheath. In yeast two-hybrid assays, OsRopGEF10 interacts with OsRac1, one of seven OsRac proteins; consistent with this, both proteins are localized in the plasma membrane. These results suggest that OsRopGEF10 activates OsRac1 to turn on the molecular signaling pathway for SP development. Together, our findings provide new insights into the molecular genetic mechanism of SP formation during early leaf morphogenesis.
NA	The RAC/ROP GTPase Activator OsRopGEF10 functions in crown root development by regulating cytokinin signaling in rice.	2022	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.	RAC/ROP GTPases are major molecular switches that control diverse signaling cascades for plant growth, development, and defense. Here we discovered a signaling node that connects RAC/ROPs to cytokinins. Rice (Oryza sativa) plants develop a fibrous root system mainly composed of crown roots. Cytokinin signaling via a phosphorelay system is critical for crown root development. We show that OsRopGEF10, which activates RAC/ROPs, acts upstream of the cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling phosphotransfer proteins AHPs of the cytokinin signaling pathway to promote crown root development. Mutations of OsRopGEF10 induced hypersensitivity to cytokinin, whereas overexpressing this gene reduced the cytokinin response. Loss of OsRopGEF10 function reduced the expression of the response regulator gene OsRR6, a repressor of cytokinin signaling, and impaired crown root development. Mutations in OsAHP1/2 led to increased crown root production and rescued the crown root defect of Osropgef10. Furthermore, auxin activates the ROP GTPase OsRAC3, which attenuates cytokinin signaling for crown root initiation. Molecular interactions between OsRopGEF10, OsRAC3 and OsAHP1/2 implicate a mechanism whereby OsRopGEF10-activated OsRAC3 recruits OsAHP1/2 to the cortical cytoplasm, sequestering them from their phosphorelay function in the nucleus. Together, our findings uncover the OsRopGEF10-OsRAC3-OsAHP1/2 signaling module, establish a link between RAC/ROPs and cytokinin, and reveal molecular crosstalk between auxin and cytokinin during crown root development.
