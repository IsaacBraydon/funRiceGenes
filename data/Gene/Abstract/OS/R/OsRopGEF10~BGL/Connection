OsRac1	OsRopGEF10|BGL	The rice bright green leaf (bgl) locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces	 In yeast two-hybrid assays, OsRopGEF10 interacts with OsRac1, one of seven OsRac proteins; consistent with this, both proteins are localized in the plasma membrane| These results suggest that OsRopGEF10 activates OsRac1 to turn on the molecular signaling pathway for SP development
