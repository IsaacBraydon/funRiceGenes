OsRpl6-1	OsRpl6-2	Transfer of rice mitochondrial ribosomal protein L6 gene to the nucleus: acquisition of the 5&#39;-untranslated region via a transposable element.	 We found that each of the two rice rpl6 genes (OsRpl6-1 and OsRpl6-2) has an intron in an identical position within the 5&#39;-untranslated region (UTR), which suggests a duplication of the rpl6 gene after its transfer to the nucleus
OsRpl6-1	OsRpl6-2	Transfer of rice mitochondrial ribosomal protein L6 gene to the nucleus: acquisition of the 5&#39;-untranslated region via a transposable element.	 Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that OsRpl6-2 expresses considerably fewer transcripts than OsRpl6-1
