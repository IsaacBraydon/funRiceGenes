Crosstalk among phytohormones is crucial for balancing plant growth and adjustment to various environments. Abscisic acid (ABA) and brassinosteroids (BRs) exhibit antagonistic interactions during many plant development processes, but little is known about the molecular mechanism mediating those interactions. Here, we identified a rice (Oryza sativa) remorin gene, OsREM4.1, whose expression is upregulated by ABA through the transcriptional activator OsbZIP23. OsREM4.1, in return, negatively regulates BR signaling output. We discovered that OsREM4.1 interacts with OsSERK1 to inhibit its interaction with rice BR receptor OsBRI1. Moreover, OsBRI1 could phosphorylate OsREM4.1 to reduce the binding affinity of OsREM4.1 to OsSERK1. These results demonstrate that OsREM4.1 is transcriptionally regulated by ABA and functions as an OsBRI1 substrate and OsSERK1-interacting protein to inhibit the formation and subsequent activation of the OsBRI1-OsSERK1 receptor complex. Our findings provide insight into the mechanism by which the antagonistic interactions between ABA and BRs are coordinated in rice.
