OsRBAP1	spikelet	The MSI1 member OsRBAP1 gene, identiﬁed by a modiﬁed MutMap method, is required for rice height and spikelet fertility.	The MSI1 member OsRBAP1 gene, identiﬁed by a modiﬁed MutMap method, is required for rice height and spikelet fertility.
OsRBAP1	spikelet	The MSI1 member OsRBAP1 gene, identiﬁed by a modiﬁed MutMap method, is required for rice height and spikelet fertility.	 Altogether, our results suggest that OsRBAP1 plays an important role in the regulation of rice height and spikelet fertility
OsRBAP1	fertility	The MSI1 member OsRBAP1 gene, identiﬁed by a modiﬁed MutMap method, is required for rice height and spikelet fertility.	 The CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to switch off OsRBAP1 in PTWT to obtain the knockout mutant osrbap1, which exhibited a severe reduction in height and fertility
OsRBAP1	fertility	The MSI1 member OsRBAP1 gene, identiﬁed by a modiﬁed MutMap method, is required for rice height and spikelet fertility.	 Altogether, our results suggest that OsRBAP1 plays an important role in the regulation of rice height and spikelet fertility
OsRBAP1	map-based cloning	The MSI1 member OsRBAP1 gene, identiﬁed by a modiﬁed MutMap method, is required for rice height and spikelet fertility.	 MutMap-based cloning revealed the occurrence of a single amino acid substitution in the LOC_Os01g51300 gene, belonging to the MSI1 (multicopy suppressor of IRA1) member OsRBAP1
OsRBAP1	height	The MSI1 member OsRBAP1 gene, identiﬁed by a modiﬁed MutMap method, is required for rice height and spikelet fertility.	The MSI1 member OsRBAP1 gene, identiﬁed by a modiﬁed MutMap method, is required for rice height and spikelet fertility.
OsRBAP1	height	The MSI1 member OsRBAP1 gene, identiﬁed by a modiﬁed MutMap method, is required for rice height and spikelet fertility.	 The CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to switch off OsRBAP1 in PTWT to obtain the knockout mutant osrbap1, which exhibited a severe reduction in height and fertility
OsRBAP1	height	The MSI1 member OsRBAP1 gene, identiﬁed by a modiﬁed MutMap method, is required for rice height and spikelet fertility.	 Altogether, our results suggest that OsRBAP1 plays an important role in the regulation of rice height and spikelet fertility
