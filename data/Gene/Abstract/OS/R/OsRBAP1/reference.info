To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying plant height regulation, we isolated and characterized a stably inherited semi-dwarf mutant bgsd-2 from the ethane methyl sulfonate (EMS) mutant progeny of &#x27;Ping Tang Wild-type (PTWT)&#x27;, a rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) landrace in Guizhou. Transcriptome sequencing and qRT-PCR analyses showed that a number of cellulose and lignin-related genes involved in cell wall biogenesis were substantially downregulated in bgsd-2. MutMap-based cloning revealed the occurrence of a single amino acid substitution in the LOC_Os01g51300 gene, belonging to the MSI1 (multicopy suppressor of IRA1) member OsRBAP1. The bgsd-2 mutation occurred in the 3rd exon of OsRBAP1, resulting in a nonsense mutation of a codon shift from glycine (G) to glutamic acid (E) at residue 65. Protein localization analysis uncovered that the OsRBAP1 gene encodes a nuclear-localized protein and that the mutation in bgsd-2 may affect the stability of the OsRBAP1 protein. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to switch off OsRBAP1 in PTWT to obtain the knockout mutant osrbap1, which exhibited a severe reduction in height and fertility. Cytological observations suggest that the dwarfism of osrabp1 may be caused by reduced cell size and numbers, and that male sterility may be due to abnormal microspore development. Transcriptome analysis revealed that OsRBAP1 defects can repress the expression of numerous essential genes, which regulate multiple developmental processes in plants. Altogether, our results suggest that OsRBAP1 plays an important role in the regulation of rice height and spikelet fertility.
