OsRpoTm	OsRpoTp	Characterization of a rice nuclear-encoded plastid RNA polymerase gene OsRpoTp	We isolated and characterized two rice genes, OsRpoTp and OsRpoTm, that encode putative phage-type RNA polymerases
OsRpoTp	OsSIG2A	The virescent-2 mutation inhibits translation of plastid transcripts for the plastid genetic system at an early stage of chloroplast differentiation	Accumulation of transcripts of nuclear-encoded photosynthetic genes, such as cab and rbcS, was strongly suppressed in the mutant at later stages of chloroplast differentiation, whereas transcripts of genes for the plastid transcription apparatus, such as OsRpoTp and OsSIG2A, accumulated to abnormally high levels at these stages
