Symbol	Keyword	Title	Evidence
OsRCI2-5	resistance	Cloning and characterization of the drought-resistance OsRCI2-5 gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	After polyethylene glycol-6000 and drought treatment, we found that the OsRCI2-5 gene improved the drought resistance of Nipponbare
OsRCI2-5	flower	Cloning and characterization of the drought-resistance OsRCI2-5 gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	Gene expression profiling showed that the OsRCI2-5 gene was expressed in the rice leaves, stems, and flower organs
OsRCI2-5	drought	Cloning and characterization of the drought-resistance OsRCI2-5 gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	After polyethylene glycol-6000 and drought treatment, we found that the OsRCI2-5 gene improved the drought resistance of Nipponbare
