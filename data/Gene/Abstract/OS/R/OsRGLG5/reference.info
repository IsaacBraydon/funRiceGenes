Rice blast, caused by M. oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases of rice. During infection, M. oryzae secretes effectors to facilitate blast development. Among these effectors, the avirulence factor AvrPi9 is recognized by Pi9, which is a broad-spectrum blast resistance protein that triggers Pi9-mediated resistance in rice. However, little is known about the interaction between AvrPi9 and Pi9 and how AvrPi9 exerts virulence to promote infection. In this study, we found that ectopic expression of AvrPi9 in the Pi9-lacking cultivar TP309 suppressed basal resistance against M. oryzae. Furthermore, we identified an AvrPi9-interacting protein in rice, which we named OsRGLG5 encoding a functional RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. During infection, AvrPi9 was ubiquitinated and degraded by OsRGLG5. Meanwhile, AvrPi9 affected the stability of OsRGLG5. Further infection assays revealed that OsRGLG5 is a positive regulator of basal resistance against M. oryzae, but it is not essential for Pi9-mediated blast resistance in rice. In conclusion, our results revealed that OsRGLG5 is targeted by the M. oryzae effector AvrPi9 and positively regulates basal resistance against rice blast.
