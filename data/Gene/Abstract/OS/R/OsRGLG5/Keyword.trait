OsRGLG5	Ubiquitin	The E3 ubiquitin ligase OsRGLG5 targeted by the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AvrPi9 confers basal resistance against rice blast.	The E3 ubiquitin ligase OsRGLG5 targeted by the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AvrPi9 confers basal resistance against rice blast.
OsRGLG5	Ubiquitin	The E3 ubiquitin ligase OsRGLG5 targeted by the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AvrPi9 confers basal resistance against rice blast.	 Furthermore, we identified an AvrPi9-interacting protein in rice, which we named OsRGLG5 encoding a functional RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase
OsRGLG5	Al resistance	The E3 ubiquitin ligase OsRGLG5 targeted by the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AvrPi9 confers basal resistance against rice blast.	The E3 ubiquitin ligase OsRGLG5 targeted by the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AvrPi9 confers basal resistance against rice blast.
