OsCKX4	OsRR3	CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE4 Integrates Cytokinin and Auxin Signaling to Control Rice Crown Root Formation.	Furthermore, one-hybrid assays revealed that OsCKX4 is a direct binding target of both the auxin response factor OsARF25 and the cytokinin response regulators OsRR2 and OsRR3
OsRR3	OsRR4	Biochemical and molecular characterisation of exogenous cytokinin application on grain filling in rice.	 Expression studies of type-A response regulator (RR) component of cytokinin signaling indicated possible role of OsRR3, OsRR4 and OsRR6 as repressors of CKX expression, much needed for an increased accumulation of CK in cells
OsRR3	OsRR6	Biochemical and molecular characterisation of exogenous cytokinin application on grain filling in rice.	 Expression studies of type-A response regulator (RR) component of cytokinin signaling indicated possible role of OsRR3, OsRR4 and OsRR6 as repressors of CKX expression, much needed for an increased accumulation of CK in cells
OsDOF11	OsRR3	OsDOF11 Promotes Crown Root Formation via Cytokinin in Oryza Sativa.	 The expression level of WUSCHEL-related homeobox (OsWOX11), A-type response regulator 2 (OsRR2), OsRR3, and OsCKX4 were decreased in osdof11-1, as well as in OsDOF11 RNA interference 9 mutants (RNAi-9 lines)
