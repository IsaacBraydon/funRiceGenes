533.full.pdf	Availability of Rubisco small subunit up-regulates the transcript levels of large subunit for stoichiometric assembly of its holoenzyme in rice	2012	Plant Physiol	Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Sendai 981-8555, Japan. ysuzuki@biochem.tohoku.ac.jp	Rubisco is composed of eight small subunits coded for by the nuclear RBCS multigene family and eight large subunits coded for by the rbcL gene in the plastome. For synthesis of the Rubisco holoenzyme, both genes need to be expressed coordinately. To investigate this molecular mechanism, the protein synthesis of two subunits of Rubisco was characterized in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plants with overexpression or antisense suppression of the RBCS gene. Total RBCS and rbcL messenger RNA (mRNA) levels and RBCS and RbcL synthesis simultaneously increased in RBCS-sense plants, although the increase in total RBCS mRNA level was greater. In RBCS-antisense plants, the levels of these mRNAs and the synthesis of the corresponding proteins declined to a similar extent. The amount of RBCS synthesized was tightly correlated with rbcL mRNA level among genotypes but not associated with changes in mRNA levels of other major chloroplast-encoded photosynthetic genes. The level of rbcL mRNA, in turn, was tightly correlated with the amount of RbcL synthesized, the molar ratio of RBCS synthesis to RbcL synthesis being identical irrespective of genotype. Polysome loading of rbcL mRNA was not changed. These results demonstrate that the availability of RBCS protein up-regulates the gene expression of rbcL primarily at the transcript level in a quantitative manner for stoichiometric assembly of Rubisco holoenzyme.
70331124.pdf	Effect of individual suppression of RBCS multigene family on Rubisco contents in rice leaves	2012	Plant Cell Environ	Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, 1-1 Tsutsumidori-Amamiyamachi, Sendai, Japan.	In higher plants, a small subunit of Rubisco is encoded for by an RBCS multigene family in the nuclear genome. However, it is unknown how each multigene member contributes to the accumulation of Rubisco holoenzyme. Here, four RBCS genes that are highly expressed in leaf blaedes of rice (Oryza sativa L.) were individually suppressed by RNAi, and the effects on leaf Rubisco content were examined at seedling, vegetative and reproductive stages. Rubisco contents in each transgenic line declined irrespective of growth stage, and the ratios of Rubisco-N to total N were 66-96% of wild-type levels. The mRNA levels of the suppressed RBCS genes declined significantly, whereas those of the unsuppressed ones did not change drastically. These results indicate that four RBCS genes all contribute to accumulation of Rubisco holoenzyme irrespective of growth stage and that suppression of one RBCS gene is not fully compensated by other RBCS genes. Additionally, the mRNA levels of the large subunit of Rubisco showed a change similar to that of total RBCS mRNA level irrespective of genotype and growth stage. These results suggest that gene expression of RBCS and RBCL is regulated in a coordinated manner at the transcript level in rice.

Rubisco content in the transformant was significantly greater in the uppermost, fully expanded leaves but decreased to levels similar to those in wild-type plants in the lower leaves. The mRNA levels of total RBCS and rbcL in these leaves were much less than those in the expanding leaves, where Rubisco synthesis is active, suggesting commensurately low level of synthesis. Although the activation state of Rubisco was lower in the uppermost, fully expanded leaves of the transformant, it recovered to its full level in the lower leaves. As a result, the photosynthetic rate did not differ in leaves at the same position between the transformant and the wild type. Similarly, whole plant biomass did not differ between these genotypes. Thus, we conclude that although the overexpression of RBCS led to an enhancement of Rubisco protein content in the uppermost, fully expanded leaves, it does not result in increased photosynthetic rates or plant biomass, because of an apparent down-regulation in its activation state.

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants with substantially increased Rubisco content were obtained by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with the rice rbcS sense gene under the control of the rice rbcS promoter. The primary transformants were screened for the ratio of Rubisco to leaf-N content, and the transformants with >120% wild-type levels of Rubisco were selected. In the progeny of the selected lines of the transformants, the mRNA levels of one member of the rbcS gene family were increased from 3.9- to 6.2-fold, whereas those of other members of the rbcS gene family were unchanged. The total levels of rbcS mRNA were increased from 2.1- to 2.8-fold. The levels of rbcL mRNA were increased from 1.2- to 1.9-fold. Rubisco protein content was significantly increased by 30% on a leaf area basis. The ratio of Rubisco-N to leaf-N was also increased by 10-20%, irrespective of N treatment. The specific activity of Rubisco per unit of enzyme protein was not different. However, light-saturated photosynthesis was not enhanced even when the rate was measured at low [CO2] where Rubisco becomes limiting for photosynthesis. Some lines showed lower photosynthesis at high [CO2] (>60 Pa). We conclude that introduction of additional sense rbcS leads to overexpression of rbcS and that this overexpression slightly up-regulates the gene expression of rbcL at the transcript level and enhances the amount of Rubisco holoenzyme. However, overproduction of Rubisco protein does not improve photosynthesis.
NA	Targeted knockdown of ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase in rice mesophyll cells	2021	J Plant Physiol	C4Rice Centre, International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Los Ba<U+00F1>os, Philippines.	We generated antisense constructs targeting two of the five Rubisco small subunit genes (OsRBCS2 and 4) which account for between 30-40 % of the RBCS transcript abundance in leaf blades. The constructs were driven by a maize phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) promoter known to have enriched expression in mesophyll cells (MCs). In the resulting lines leaf, Rubisco protein content was reduced by between 30-50 % and CO2 assimilation rate was limited under photorespiratory and non-photorespiratory conditions. A relationship between Rubisco protein content and CO2 assimilation rate was found. This was associated with a significant reduction in dry biomass accumulation and grain yield of between 37-70%. In addition to serving as a resource for reducing Rubisco accumulation in a cell-preferential manner, these lines allow us to characterize gene function and isoform specific suppression on photosynthesis and growth. Our results suggest that the knockdown of multiple genes is required to completely reduce Rubisco accumulation in MCs.
