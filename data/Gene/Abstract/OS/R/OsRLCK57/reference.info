NA	Four receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases regulate development and immunity in rice.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Key Laboratory of Major Crop Diseases &amp; Collaborative Innovation Center for Hybrid Rice in Yangtze River Basin, Sichuan Agricultural University at Wenjiang, Chengdu, Sichuan, 611130, China.	Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) represent a large family of proteins in plants. However, few RLCKs have been well-characterized. Here, we report the functional characterization of four rice RLCKs-OsRLCK57, OsRLCK107, OsRLCK118, and OsRLCK176 from subfamily VII. These OsRLCKs interact with the rice brassinosteroid receptor, OsBRI1 in yeast cell, but not the XA21 immune receptor. Transgenic lines silenced for each of these genes have enlarged leaf angles and are hypersensitive to brassinolide treatment compared to wild type rice. Transgenic plants silenced for OsRLCK57 had significantly fewer tillers and reduced panicle secondary branching, and lines silenced for OsRLCK107 and OsRLCK118 produce fewer seeds. Silencing of these genes decreased Xa21 gene expression and compromised XA21-mediated immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Our study demonstrates that these OsRLCKs negatively regulate BR signaling, while positively regulate immune responses by contributing to the expression of the immune receptor XA21.

NA	OsRLCK 57, OsRLCK107 and OsRLCK118 Positively Regulate Chitin- and PGN-Induced Immunity in Rice.	2017	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol and Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 510275, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.	The receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, OsRLCK176 has been reported to participate in both chitin- and PGN-induced immunity in rice. Here, we further researched the function of the homologous proteins, OsRLCK57, OsRLCK107 and OsRLCK118, in chitin- and PGN immunity in rice.Silencing of OsRLCK57,OsRLCK107 and OsRLCK118 suppressed chitin- and PGN-induced immunity responses, including reactive oxygen species generation, defense gene expression. Furthermore, OsRLCK107 could interact with OsCERK1 in a MAMP induced way, which suggested a possible physiological relevance of OsRLCKs107 to OsCERK1 pathway.OsRLCK57, OsRLCK107 and OsRLCK118, positively regulate chitin- and PGN- induced responses in rice, similar to that observed in OsRLCK176.
