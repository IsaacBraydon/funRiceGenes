NA	Dual Activities of Plant cGMP-Dependent Protein Kinase and its Roles in Gibberellin Signaling and Salt Stress.	2019	Plant Cell	Huazhong Agricultural University CITY: Wuhan STATE: Hubei China [CN].	Guanosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) is an important regulator in eukaryotes and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) plays a key role in perceiving cellular cGMP in diverse physiological processes in animals. However, the molecular identity, property, and function of PKG in plants remain elusive. This study has identified PKG from plants and characterized its role in mediating gibberellin (GA) response in rice. PKGs from plants are structurally unique with an additional type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C) domain. Rice PKG possesses both protein kinase and phosphatase activities, and cGMP stimulates its kinase activity but inhibits its phosphatase activity. One of PKG's targets is GAMYB, a transcription factor in GA signaling, and the dual activities of PKG catalyze the reversible phosphorylation of GAMYB at Serine6, and modulate the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of GAMYB in response to GA. Loss of PKG impeded the nuclear-localization of GAMYB and abolished GAMYB function in GA response, leading to defects in GA-induced seed germination, internode elongation, and pollen viability. In addition to GAMYB, the results indicate that PKG has broader effects with multiple potential targets in particular involved in salt stress response.
