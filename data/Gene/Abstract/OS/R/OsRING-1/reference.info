A novel blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger protein gene OsRING-1 was cloned from rice by cDNA library screening. OsRING-1 is 1670 bp in length and encodes a 46.6 kDa basic protein with two transmembrane (TM) domains, a basic domain (BD), a conserved domain (CD), a RING finger domain and a serine rich (S-rich) domain. By database search, OsRING-1 was mapped on chromosome 2 and clustered together with other six zinc finger genes. The promoter sequence analysis of OsRING-1 gene revealed that some ABA, GA, ethylene, wound, drought, heat stress and pathogen infection responsive elements were found within the OsRING-1 promoter region. Northern analysis showed that OsRING-1 was induced in different degree by pathogen infections, SA, ABA, JA and ethephon (ET) treatments. Tissue expression analysis showed that OsRING-1 was constitutively strongly expressed in roots, but faintly in stems, leaves and sheaths. Taken together, OsRING-1, as a novel C3H2C3-type zinc finger protein involved in many stress responses in rice might plays a role as a transcription regulator in plant stress response signal transduction pathways.
NA	OsATL38 mediates mono-ubiquitination of the 14-3-3 protein OsGF14d and negatively regulates the cold stress response in rice	2021	J Exp Bot	Department of Systems Biology and Division of Life Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.	One of the major regulatory pathways that permits plants to convert an external stimulus into an internal cellular response within a short period of time is the ubiquitination pathway. In this study, OsATL38 was identified as a low temperature-induced gene that encodes a rice homolog of Arabidopsis T¨®xicos en Levadura RING-type E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase, which was predominantly localized to the plasma membrane. OsATL38-overexpressing transgenic rice plants exhibited decreased tolerance to cold stress as compared to wild-type rice plants. In contrast, RNAi-mediated OsATL38 knockdown transgenic progeny exhibited markedly increased tolerance to cold stress relative to that of wild-type plants, which indicated a negative role of OsATL38 in response to cold stress. Yeast two-hybrid, in vitro pull-down, and co-IP assays revealed that OsATL38 physically interacted with OsGF14d, a rice 14-3-3 protein. An in vivo target ubiquitination assay indicated that OsGF14d was mono-ubiquitinated by OsATL38. The osgf14d knockout mutant plants were more sensitive to cold stress than wild-type rice plants, indicating that OsGF14d is a positive factor in the response to cold stress. These results suggested that the RING E3 Ub ligase OsATL38 negatively regulates the cold stress response in rice via mono-ubiquitination of OsGF14d 14-3-3 protein.
