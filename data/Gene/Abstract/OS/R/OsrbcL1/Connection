OsrbcL1	OsRBCS1	Rice RING E3 ligase may negatively regulate gamma-ray response to mediate the degradation of photosynthesis-related proteins.	In this study, our findings regarding the regulation of GA irradiation-induced OsGIRP1 in relation to the levels of photosynthesis-related proteins such as OsrbcL1 and OsrbcS1 and hypersensitive responses of overexpressing plants to GR irradiation provide insight into the molecular functions of OsGIRP1 as a negative regulator in response to the stress of radiation
OsrbcL1	OsRBCS1	Rice RING E3 ligase may negatively regulate gamma-ray response to mediate the degradation of photosynthesis-related proteins.	 Protein degradation in cell extracts showed that OsGIRP1 mediates proteolysis of 2 substrates, OsrbcS1 and OsrbcL1, via the 26S proteasome degradation pathway
