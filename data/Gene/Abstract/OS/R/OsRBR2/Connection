OsRBR1	OsRBR2	RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED genes specifically control inner floral organ morphogenesis and pollen development in rice.	 We characterized the functions of OsRBR1 and OsRBR2 in plant growth and development in rice using both for-ward and reverse genetics methods
OsRBR1	OsRBR2	RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED genes specifically control inner floral organ morphogenesis and pollen development in rice.	 Similar to the protein interaction between AtRBR and AtMSI1 that is essential for floral de-velopment in Arabidopsis, OsMSI1 was identified as an interaction partner of OsRBR1 and OsRBR2
OsRBR1	OsRBR2	RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED genes specifically control inner floral organ morphogenesis and pollen development in rice.	 These results suggest that OsRBR1 and OsRBR2 function with OsMSI1 in reproductive development in rice
