NA	OsHyPRP06/R3L1 regulates root system development and salt tolerance via apoplastic ROS homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2021	Plant Cell Environ	College of Plant Protection, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou450002, Henan, China.	Plant root morphology is constantly reshaped in response to triggers from the soil environment. Such modifications in root system architecture involve changes in the abundance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the apoplast and in cell wall (CW) composition. The hybrid proline-rich proteins (HyPRPs) gene family in higher plants is considered to be important in the regulation of CW structure. However, the functions of HyPRPs remain to be characterised. We therefore analysed the functions of OsR3L1 (Os04g0554500) in rice. qRT-PCR and GUS staining revealed that OsR3L1 is expressed in roots. While the r3l1 mutants had a defective root system with fewer adventitious roots (ARs) and lateral roots (LRs) than the wild type, lines overexpressing OsR3L1 (R3L1-OE) showed. more extensive LR formation but with a shorter root length. The expression of OsR3L1 was initiated by the OsMADS25 transcription factor. Moreover, the abundance of OsR3L1 transcripts was increased by NaCl. The R3L1-OE-3 line exhibited enhanced salt tolerance, whereas the r3l1-2 mutant showed greater salt sensitivity. The addition of H2 O2 increased the levels of OsR3L1 transcripts. Data are presented indicating that OsR3L1 modulates H2 O2 accumulation in the apoplast. We conclude that OsR3L1 regulates salt tolerance through regulation peroxidases and apoplastic H2 O2 metabolism. OsR3L1 (Os04g0554500), the root-specific expression HyPRP protein, regulates root system development and salt tolerance through regulation peroxidases and apoplastic H2 O2 metabolism.
