OsR3L1	transcription factor	OsHyPRP06/R3L1 regulates root system development and salt tolerance via apoplastic ROS homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 The expression of OsR3L1 was initiated by the OsMADS25 transcription factor
OsR3L1	root	OsHyPRP06/R3L1 regulates root system development and salt tolerance via apoplastic ROS homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 While the r3l1 mutants had a defective root system with fewer adventitious roots (ARs) and lateral roots (LRs) than the wild type, lines overexpressing OsR3L1 (R3L1-OE) showed
OsR3L1	root	OsHyPRP06/R3L1 regulates root system development and salt tolerance via apoplastic ROS homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 OsR3L1 (Os04g0554500), the root-specific expression HyPRP protein, regulates root system development and salt tolerance through regulation peroxidases and apoplastic H2 O2 metabolism
OsR3L1	development	OsHyPRP06/R3L1 regulates root system development and salt tolerance via apoplastic ROS homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 OsR3L1 (Os04g0554500), the root-specific expression HyPRP protein, regulates root system development and salt tolerance through regulation peroxidases and apoplastic H2 O2 metabolism
OsR3L1	salt	OsHyPRP06/R3L1 regulates root system development and salt tolerance via apoplastic ROS homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 We conclude that OsR3L1 regulates salt tolerance through regulation peroxidases and apoplastic H2 O2 metabolism
