OsRR2	cytokinin	The auxin responsive AP2/ERF transcription factor CROWN ROOTLESS5 is involved in crown root initiation in rice through the induction of OsRR1, a type-A response regulator of cytokinin signaling	 In addition, ProACT:CRL5/WT showed a cytokinin-resistant phenotype for crown root initiation, and also up-regulated the expression of two negative regulators of cytokinin signaling, OsRR1 and OsRR2, which were downregulated in crl5
