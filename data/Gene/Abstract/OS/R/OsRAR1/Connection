OsRAR1	OsSGT1	OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact and function in rice basal disease resistance	 Here, we show that the rice orthologs OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact in vivo and in yeast| Overexpression of OsRar1 and OsSGT1 in rice significantly increased basal resistance to a virulent bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv| oryzae PXO99 but not to another virulent strain DY89031, suggesting race-specific-like basal resistance conferred by OsRar1 and OsSGT1| OsRar1-OE and OsSGT1-OE plants also enhanced resistance to all four virulent blast fungal Magnaporthe oryzae races| These results collectively suggest that OsRar1 and OsSGT1 might be differentially required for rice basal disease resistance|OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact and function in rice basal disease resistance|The RAR1 and SGT1 proteins function synergistically or antagonistically in plant innate immune responses| They displayed conserved roles in Arabidopsis disease resistance through ectopic expression in the Arabidopsis rar1 and sgt1 mutants
OsRACK1A	OsRAR1	RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex	 RACK1A was shown to interact with the N terminus of NADPH oxidase, RAR1, and SGT1, key regulators of plant disease resistance
OsRac1	OsRAR1	RAR1 and HSP90 form a complex with Rac/Rop GTPase and function in innate-immune responses in rice	 In this study, we examined the functional relationships between Os Rac1, RAR1, and HSP90| Constitutively active Os Rac1 complemented the loss of resistance, suggesting that Os Rac1 and RAR1 are functionally linked| Coimmunoprecipitation experiments with rice cell culture extracts indicate that Rac1 forms a complex with RAR1, HSP90, and HSP70 in vivo| Studies with Os RAR1-RNAi and treatment with geldanamycin, an HSP90-specific inhibitor, showed that RAR1 and HSP90 are essential for the Rac1-mediated enhancement of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immune responses in rice cell cultures| Furthermore, the function of HSP90, but not RAR1, may be essential for their association with the Rac1 complex| Os Rac1 also regulates RAR1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels| Together, our results indicate that Rac1, RAR1, HSP90, and HSP70 form one or more protein complexes in rice cells and suggest that these proteins play important roles in innate immunity in rice
Hsp90|rHsp90	OsRAR1	RAR1 and HSP90 form a complex with Rac/Rop GTPase and function in innate-immune responses in rice	 RAR1 (for required for Mla12 resistance) and HSP90 (a heat shock protein 90 kD) are important components of R gene-mediated disease resistance, and their function is conserved in several plant species| In this study, we examined the functional relationships between Os Rac1, RAR1, and HSP90| Coimmunoprecipitation experiments with rice cell culture extracts indicate that Rac1 forms a complex with RAR1, HSP90, and HSP70 in vivo| Studies with Os RAR1-RNAi and treatment with geldanamycin, an HSP90-specific inhibitor, showed that RAR1 and HSP90 are essential for the Rac1-mediated enhancement of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immune responses in rice cell cultures| Furthermore, the function of HSP90, but not RAR1, may be essential for their association with the Rac1 complex| Together, our results indicate that Rac1, RAR1, HSP90, and HSP70 form one or more protein complexes in rice cells and suggest that these proteins play important roles in innate immunity in rice|RAR1 and HSP90 form a complex with Rac/Rop GTPase and function in innate-immune responses in rice
