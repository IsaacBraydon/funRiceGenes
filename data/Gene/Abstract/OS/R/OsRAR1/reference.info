MPMI-21-3-0294.pdf	OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact and function in rice basal disease resistance	2008	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Institute of Plant Physiology & Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shangai, China.	The RAR1 and SGT1 proteins function synergistically or antagonistically in plant innate immune responses. Here, we show that the rice orthologs OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact in vivo and in yeast. They displayed conserved roles in Arabidopsis disease resistance through ectopic expression in the Arabidopsis rar1 and sgt1 mutants. Overexpression of OsRar1 and OsSGT1 in rice significantly increased basal resistance to a virulent bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99 but not to another virulent strain DY89031, suggesting race-specific-like basal resistance conferred by OsRar1 and OsSGT1. OsRar1-OE and OsSGT1-OE plants also enhanced resistance to all four virulent blast fungal Magnaporthe oryzae races. Overexpression of the OsSGT1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion most likely caused a dominant negative phenotype which led to race-specific-like basal resistance. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsSGT1-GFP show enhanced resistance to DY89031 but decreased resistance to PXO99, implying that OsSGT1 might be the target of a component required for DY89031 virulence or OsSGT1-GFP might stabilize weak resistance proteins against DY89031. Consistent with the hypothesis of the dominant negative regulation, we observed the reduced sensitivity to auxin of OsSGT1-GFP plants compared with the wild-type ones, and the curling-root phenotype in OsSGT1-OE plants. These results collectively suggest that OsRar1 and OsSGT1 might be differentially required for rice basal disease resistance. Our current study also provides new insight into the roles of OsSGT1 in basal disease resistance.
Plant Cell-2008-Nakashima-2265-79.pdf	RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex	2008	Plant Cell	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma 630-0192, Japan.	A small GTPase, Rac1, plays a key role in rice (Oryza sativa) innate immunity as part of a complex of regulatory proteins. Here, we used affinity column chromatography to identify rice RACK1 (for Receptor for Activated C-Kinase 1) as an interactor with Rac1. RACK1 functions in various mammalian signaling pathways and is involved in hormone signaling and development in plants. Rice contains two RACK1 genes, RACK1A and RACK1B, and the RACK1A protein interacts with the GTP form of Rac1. Rac1 positively regulates RACK1A at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. RACK1A transcription was also induced by a fungal elicitor and by abscisic acid, jasmonate, and auxin. Analysis of transgenic rice plants and cell cultures indicates that RACK1A plays a role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and in resistance against rice blast infection. Overexpression of RACK1A enhances ROS production in rice seedlings. RACK1A was shown to interact with the N terminus of NADPH oxidase, RAR1, and SGT1, key regulators of plant disease resistance. These results suggest that RACK1A functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with multiple proteins in the Rac1 immune complex.

A rice (Oryza sativa) Rac/Rop GTPase, Os Rac1, is involved in innate immunity, but its molecular function is largely unknown. RAR1 (for required for Mla12 resistance) and HSP90 (a heat shock protein 90 kD) are important components of R gene-mediated disease resistance, and their function is conserved in several plant species. HSP90 has also recently been shown to be important in mammalian innate immunity. However, their functions at the molecular level are not well understood. In this study, we examined the functional relationships between Os Rac1, RAR1, and HSP90. Os RAR1-RNA interference (RNAi) rice plants had impaired basal resistance to a compatible race of the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and the virulent bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae. Constitutively active Os Rac1 complemented the loss of resistance, suggesting that Os Rac1 and RAR1 are functionally linked. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments with rice cell culture extracts indicate that Rac1 forms a complex with RAR1, HSP90, and HSP70 in vivo. Studies with Os RAR1-RNAi and treatment with geldanamycin, an HSP90-specific inhibitor, showed that RAR1 and HSP90 are essential for the Rac1-mediated enhancement of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immune responses in rice cell cultures. Furthermore, the function of HSP90, but not RAR1, may be essential for their association with the Rac1 complex. Os Rac1 also regulates RAR1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Together, our results indicate that Rac1, RAR1, HSP90, and HSP70 form one or more protein complexes in rice cells and suggest that these proteins play important roles in innate immunity in rice.

The required for Mla12 resistance (RAR1) protein is essential for the plant immune response. In rice, a model monocot species, the function of Oryza sativa RAR1 (OsRAR1) has been little explored. In our current study, we characterized the response of a rice osrar1 T-DNA insertion mutant to infection by Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. osrar1 mutants displayed reduced resistance compared with wild type rice when inoculated with the normally virulent M. oryzae isolate PO6-6, indicating that OsRAR1 is required for an immune response to this pathogen. We also investigated the function of OsRAR1 in the resistance mechanism mediated by the immune receptor genes Pib and Pi5 that encode nucleotide binding-leucine rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins. We inoculated progeny from Pib/osrar1 and Pi5/osrar1 heterozygous plants with the avirulent M. oryzae isolates, race 007 and PO6-6, respectively. We found that only Pib-mediated resistance was compromised by the osrar1 mutation and that the introduction of the OsRAR1 cDNA into Pib/osrar1 rescued Pib-mediated resistance. These results indicate that OsRAR1 is required for Pib-mediated resistance but not Pi5-mediated resistance to M. oryzae.
