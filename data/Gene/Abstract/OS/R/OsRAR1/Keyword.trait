OsRAR1	blight	OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact and function in rice basal disease resistance	 Overexpression of OsRar1 and OsSGT1 in rice significantly increased basal resistance to a virulent bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv
OsRAR1	disease	Differential requirement of Oryza sativa RAR1 in immune receptor-mediated resistance of rice to Magnaporthe oryzae	 In our current study, we characterized the response of a rice osrar1 T-DNA insertion mutant to infection by Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease
