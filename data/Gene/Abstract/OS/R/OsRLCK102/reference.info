NA	The Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase OsRLCK102 Regulates XA21-Mediated Immunity and Plant Development in Rice	2015	Plant Molecular Biology Reporter	Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University at Wenjiang, Chengdu, Sichuan, 611130, China	Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) belong to a large subgroup of kinases that play pivotal roles in plant development and in protecting plants from various stresses. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of rice OsRLCK102, from the OsRLCK VII subgroup. Silencing of OsRLCK102 compromised receptor kinase XA21-mediated resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) but did not affect plant basal resistance to Xoo or Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae). Plants with silenced OsRLCK102 exhibit architecture alterations, including reduced plant height, enlarged angle of the lamina joint, decreased rates of seed setting and enhanced sensitivity to hormone brassinolide (BR). Collectively, our study reveals that OsRLCK102 positively regulates XA21-mediated immunity and negatively regulates rice development through BR signaling in rice.
