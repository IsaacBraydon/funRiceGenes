OsRAD17	pollen	OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.	 In Osrad17 pollen mother cells (PMCs), associations between non-homologous chromosomes and chromosome fragmentation were constantly observed
OsRAD17	meiotic	OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.	OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.
OsRAD17	meiotic	OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.	 OsRAD17 interacts with OsRAD1 and the meiotic phenotype of Osrad1 Osrad17 is indistinguishable from the two single mutants which have similar phenotypes, manifesting they could act in the same pathway
