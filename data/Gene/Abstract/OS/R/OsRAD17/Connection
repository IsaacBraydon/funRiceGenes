OsMSH5	OsRAD17	OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.	 Similar phenotypes were observed in the Osmsh5 Osrad17 and Osmer3 Osrad1 double mutants, suggesting the cooperation between the checkpoint proteins and ZMM proteins in assuring accurate HR in rice
OsRAD1	OsRAD17	OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.	 OsRAD17 interacts with OsRAD1 and the meiotic phenotype of Osrad1 Osrad17 is indistinguishable from the two single mutants which have similar phenotypes, manifesting they could act in the same pathway
OsRAD1	OsRAD17	OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.	 Similar phenotypes were observed in the Osmsh5 Osrad17 and Osmer3 Osrad1 double mutants, suggesting the cooperation between the checkpoint proteins and ZMM proteins in assuring accurate HR in rice
OsRAD17	OsZIP4	OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.	OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.
OsRAD17	OsZIP4	OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.	 We found that homologous pairing and synapsis, which was roughly unaffected in Oszip4 and Osrad17 single mutant, was severely disturbed in the Oszip4 Osrad17 double mutant
