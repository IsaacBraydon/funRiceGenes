OsRINGzf1	leaf	Ubiquitin ligase OsRINGzf1 regulates drought resistance by controlling the turnover of OsPIP2;1.	 The OsRINGzf1 OE plants, with higher leaf-related water content (LRWC) and lower leaf water loss rate (LWLR), exhibited enhanced drought resistance, whereas the RNAi and knockout plants of OsRINGzf1 were more sensitive to drought
OsRINGzf1	resistance	Ubiquitin ligase OsRINGzf1 regulates drought resistance by controlling the turnover of OsPIP2;1.	Ubiquitin ligase OsRINGzf1 regulates drought resistance by controlling the turnover of OsPIP2;1.
OsRINGzf1	resistance	Ubiquitin ligase OsRINGzf1 regulates drought resistance by controlling the turnover of OsPIP2;1.	 Together, our data demonstrate that OsRINGzf1 positively regulates drought resistance through promoting the degradation of OsPIP2;1 to enhance water retention capacity in rice
