The rice genome contains at least seven expressed Rop small GTPase genes. Of these Rops, OsRac1 is the only characterized gene that has been implicated in disease resistance as a positive regulator. To our interest in finding a negative ROP regulator of disease resistance in rice, we applied a "phylogeny of function" approach to rice Rops, and identified OsRacB based on its close genetic orthologous relationship with the barley HvRacB gene, a known negative regulator of disease resistance. To determine the function of OsRacB, we isolated the OsRacB cDNA and conducted gene expression and transgenic studies. OsRacB, a single copy gene in the genome of rice, shared 98% identity with HvRacB at the amino acid level. Its mRNA was strongly expressed in leaf sheath (LS) and in panicles, but was very weakly expressed in young and mature leaves. The basal mRNA level of OsRacB in LS of two-week-old seedlings was strongly down-regulated upon wounding by cut and treatment with jasmonic acid. A dramatic down-regulation in the OsRacB transcripts was also found in plants inoculated with the blast pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea. Interestingly, transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsRacB showed increased symptom development in response to rice blast pathogens. Additionally, fluorescence microscopy of green fluorescent protein (GFP):OsRacB-transformed onion cells and Arabidopsis protoplasts revealed OsRacB association with plasma membrane (PM), suggesting that PM localization is required for proper function of OsRacB. Based on these results, we suggest that OsRacB functions as a potential regulator for a basal disease resistance pathway in rice.
Acta Biochim Biophys Sin-2006-Luo-393-402.pdf	Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling	2006	Acta Biochimica et Biophysica Sinica	Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China.	As the sole ubiquitous signal small guanosine triphosphate-binding protein in plants, Rop gene plays an important role in plant growth and development. In this study, we focus on the relationship between the novel rice Rop gene OsRacB and plant salt tolerance. Results show that OsRacB transcription is highly accumulated in roots after treatment with salinity, but only slightly accumulated in stems and leaves under the same treatment. Promoter analysis showed that OsRacB promoter is induced by salinity and exogenous salicylic acid, not abscisic acid. To elucidate its physiological function, we generated OsRacB sense and antisense transgenic tobacco and rice. Under proper salinity treatment, sense transgenic plants grew much better than the control. This suggests that overexpression of OsRacB in tobacco and rice can improve plant salt tolerance. But under the same treatment, no difference could be observed between OsRacB antisense plants and the control. The results indicated that OsRacB is only an accessory factor in plant salt tolerance.
NA	A small Rho GTPase OsRacB is required for pollen germination in rice.	2021	Dev Growth Differ	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic and Developmental Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China.	Plant Rho small GTPases (Rop/Rac) are versatile molecular switches regulating many plant developmental processes. Particularly, their important functions in regulating pollen development have been demonstrated in Arabidopsis. Not until recently, a group of conserved Rop/Rac activators RopGEFs were reported to regulate rice (Oryza sativa) pollen tube germination, indicating that rice and Arabidopsis may have a conserved Rop/Rac mediated signaling pathway in regulating pollen tube growth. However, the Rop/Rac activated by the rice pollen specific RopGEFs remains to be identified. Here we demonstrated a Rop/Rac gene, OsRacB, co-expressed with the mature pollen expressed OsRopGEF2/3/6/8. The knockout mutants were normal in anther and pollen development but defective in the pollen grain germination, suggesting a specific and non-redundant role of OsRacB in the mature pollen. We further demonstrated that OsRacB is directly activated by the pollen specific expressing OsRopGEFs in vitro. Together with the previous study, we establish a RopGEF-Rop/Rac regulon which plays essential roles in rice pollen grain germination. Our data encourage further identification of the upstream and downstream players of RopGEF-Rop/Rac signaling in pollen germination and have agricultural implications for breeding robust seed yielding cultivars.
