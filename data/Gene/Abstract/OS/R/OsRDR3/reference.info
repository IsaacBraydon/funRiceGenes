NA	Essential role of ¦Ã-clade RNA-dependent RNA polymerases in rice development and yield-related traits is linked to their atypical polymerase activities regulating specific genomic regions	2021	New Phytol	National Centre for Biological Sciences, GKVK Campus, Bangalore, 560065, India.	RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDR) generate double-stranded (ds)RNA triggers for RNA silencing across eukaryotes. Among the three clades, ¦Á- and ¦Â-clade members are key components of RNA silencing and mediators of stress responses across eukaryotes. However, ¦Ã-clade members are unusual in that they are represented in phylogenetically distant plants and fungi, and their functions are unknown. Using genetic, bioinformatic and biochemical methods, we show that ¦Ã-clade RDRs from Oryza sativa L. are involved in plant development as well as regulation of expression of coding and non-coding RNAs. Overexpression of ¦Ã-clade RDRs in transgenic rice and tobacco plants resulted in robust growth phenotype, whereas their silencing in rice displayed strong inhibition of growth. Small (s)RNA and RNA-seq analysis of OsRDR3 mis-expression lines suggested that it is specifically involved in the regulation of repeat-rich regions in the genome. Biochemical analysis confirmed that OsRDR3 has robust polymerase activities on both single stranded (ss)RNA and ssDNA templates similar to the activities reported for ¦Á-clade RDRs such as AtRDR6. Our results provide the first evidence of the importance of ¦Ã-clade RDRs in plant development, their atypical biochemical activities, and their contribution to the regulation of gene expression.
