OsRRM	growth	OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm	 Ectopic expression of OsRRM in transgenic plants led to abnormalities, such as short stature, retarded growth and low fructification rates
OsRRM	endosperm	OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm	 The OsRRM promoter directed GUS expression specifically in rice endosperm, analogous to the GUS expression pattern observed in 107#
OsRRM	endosperm	OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm	 Western blot analysis confirmed that the OsRRM protein was specifically expressed in rice endosperm
OsRRM	endosperm	OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm	 Our data, in conjunction with the reported function of Spen genes, implicated OsRRM in the regulation of cell development in rice endosperm
OsRRM	endosperm	OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm	OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm
