NA	Evaluation of the role of the LysM receptor-like kinase, OsNFR5/OsRLK2 for AM symbiosis in rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Life Sciences, School of Agriculture, Meiji University, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 214-8571 Japan.	In legume-specific rhizobial symbiosis, host plants perceive rhizobial signal molecules, Nod factors, by a couple of LysM receptor like kinases, NFR1/LYK3 and NFR5/NFP, and activate symbiotic responses through the downstream signaling components required also for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis. Recently, rice NFR1/LYK3 ortholog, OsCERK1, was shown to play crucial roles for AM symbiosis. On the other hand, the roles of NFR5/NFP ortholog in rice have not been elucidated, while it has been shown that NFR5/NFP orthologs, Parasponia PaNFR5 and tomato SlRLK10, engage in AM symbiosis. OsCERK1 also triggers immune responses in combination with a receptor partner, OsCEBiP, against fungal or bacterial infection, thus regulating opposite responses against symbiotic and pathogenic microbes. However, it has not been elucidated how OsCERK1 switches these opposite functions. Here, we analyzed the function of rice NFR5/NFP ortholog, OsNFR5/OsRLK2, as a possible candidate of the OsCERK1 partner for symbiotic signaling.Inoculation of AM fungi induced the expression of OsNFR5 in the rice root and the chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular domain of LjNFR5 and the intracellular domain of OsNFR5 complemented Ljnfr5 mutant for rhizobial symbiosis, indicating that the intracellular kinase domain of OsNFR5 could activate symbiotic signaling in L japonicus Although these data suggested the possible involvement of OsNFR5 in AM symbiosis, osnfr5 knockout mutants were colonized by AM fungi similar to the wild-type rice. These observations suggested several possibilities including the presence of functionally redundant genes other than OsNFR5 or involvement of novel ligands, which do not require OsNFR5 for recognition.
