70331124.pdf	Effect of individual suppression of RBCS multigene family on Rubisco contents in rice leaves	2012	Plant Cell Environ	Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, 1-1 Tsutsumidori-Amamiyamachi, Sendai, Japan.	In higher plants, a small subunit of Rubisco is encoded for by an RBCS multigene family in the nuclear genome. However, it is unknown how each multigene member contributes to the accumulation of Rubisco holoenzyme. Here, four RBCS genes that are highly expressed in leaf blaedes of rice (Oryza sativa L.) were individually suppressed by RNAi, and the effects on leaf Rubisco content were examined at seedling, vegetative and reproductive stages. Rubisco contents in each transgenic line declined irrespective of growth stage, and the ratios of Rubisco-N to total N were 66-96% of wild-type levels. The mRNA levels of the suppressed RBCS genes declined significantly, whereas those of the unsuppressed ones did not change drastically. These results indicate that four RBCS genes all contribute to accumulation of Rubisco holoenzyme irrespective of growth stage and that suppression of one RBCS gene is not fully compensated by other RBCS genes. Additionally, the mRNA levels of the large subunit of Rubisco showed a change similar to that of total RBCS mRNA level irrespective of genotype and growth stage. These results suggest that gene expression of RBCS and RBCL is regulated in a coordinated manner at the transcript level in rice.
Plant Cell Physiol-2007-Suzuki-626-37.pdf	Increased Rubisco content in transgenic rice transformed with the 'sense' rbcS gene	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Applied Plant Science, Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, 1-1 Tsutsumidori-Amamiyamachi, Sendai 981-8555, Japan.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants with substantially increased Rubisco content were obtained by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with the rice rbcS sense gene under the control of the rice rbcS promoter. The primary transformants were screened for the ratio of Rubisco to leaf-N content, and the transformants with >120% wild-type levels of Rubisco were selected. In the progeny of the selected lines of the transformants, the mRNA levels of one member of the rbcS gene family were increased from 3.9- to 6.2-fold, whereas those of other members of the rbcS gene family were unchanged. The total levels of rbcS mRNA were increased from 2.1- to 2.8-fold. The levels of rbcL mRNA were increased from 1.2- to 1.9-fold. Rubisco protein content was significantly increased by 30% on a leaf area basis. The ratio of Rubisco-N to leaf-N was also increased by 10-20%, irrespective of N treatment. The specific activity of Rubisco per unit of enzyme protein was not different. However, light-saturated photosynthesis was not enhanced even when the rate was measured at low [CO2] where Rubisco becomes limiting for photosynthesis. Some lines showed lower photosynthesis at high [CO2] (>60 Pa). We conclude that introduction of additional sense rbcS leads to overexpression of rbcS and that this overexpression slightly up-regulates the gene expression of rbcL at the transcript level and enhances the amount of Rubisco holoenzyme. However, overproduction of Rubisco protein does not improve photosynthesis.
NA	Identification and expression analysis of non-photosynthetic Rubisco small subunit, OsRbcS1-like genes in plants	2016	Plant Gene	Laboratory of Tropical Crop Science, Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Kobe University, Kobe 657-8501, Japan	Rubisco is the key enzyme of photosynthetic CO2 fixation, whereas a Rubisco small subunit homolog (OsRbcS1) in rice, was exclusively expressed in non-photosynthetic organs. In this study, OsRbcS1-like genes were identified in several plant species including foxtail millet (SiRbcS1), tomato (SlRbcS1), Lotus japonicus (LjRbcS1), grape (VvRbcS1A, VvRbcS1B) and Selaginella moellendorffii (SmRbcS1A, SmRbcS1B). RT-PCR analysis revealed that SiRbcS1 was expressed in seeds of foxtail millet. In tomato, SlRbcS1 was expressed in the stamen, pistil and green fruit. In L. japonicus, LjRbcS1 was expressed in the root, nodule and seed. In grape, both VvRbcS1A and VvRbcS1B were expressed in mature leaves and the green berry. In S. moellendorffii, SmRbcS1A and SmRbcS1B displayed similar expression patterns and were expressed in the rhizome and root. Although these OsRbcS1-like genes were expressed in photosynthetic organs in S. moellendorffii, its expression levels were higher in non-photosynthetic organs than in photosynthetic organs. These results suggest that OsRbcS1-like RbcS functions in metabolic pathways other than photosynthetic CO2 fixation in various organs.
