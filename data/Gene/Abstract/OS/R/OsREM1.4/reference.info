NA	Rice Stripe Virus Interferes with S-acylation of Remorin and Induces its Autophagic Degradation to Facilitate Virus Infection.	2017	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Institute of Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Remorins are plant-specific membrane-associated proteins, and were proposed to play crucial roles in plant-pathogen interactions. However, little is known about pathogens' counter-response to remorin-mediated regulation. Here, we find the remorin protein (NbREM1) is down-regulated early in Rice stripe virus (RSV) infection by quantitative whole-proteome analysis. We demonstrate that the turnover of NbREM1 is regulated by the S-acylation modification and can enter the autophagy pathway for degradation. We further show that RSV can interfere with the S-acylation of NbREM1, that is required for negatively regulates RSV infection by restricting virus cell-to-cell trafficking. The interference of NbREM1 S-acylation affects the targeting of NbREM1 to the plasma membrane microdomain, and the resulting accumulation of non-targeted NbREM1 is subjected to the autophagic degradation, causing down-regulation of NbREM1. In addition, we find the RSV-encoded NSvc4 protein alone can interfere with NbREM1 S-acylation through binding with the C-terminal domain of NbREM1. Moreover, we reveal a same counter-response of NSvc4 to the homologous remorin (OsREM1.4) from Oryza sativa, the original host of RSV, indicating down-regulating remorin protein level by interfering its S-acylation is a common strategy that RSV has adopted to overcome remorin mediated inhibition of virus movement.
