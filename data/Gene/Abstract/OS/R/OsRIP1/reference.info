NA	Involvement of OsRIP1, a ribosome-inactivating protein from rice, in plant defense against Nilaparvata lugens.	2019	Phytochemistry	Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Coupure links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; Department of Plants and Crops, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Coupure links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.	Rice is the most important staple food in the world, but rice production is challenged by several biotic stress factors like viruses, bacteria, fungi and pest insects. One of the most notorious pest insects is Nilaparvata lugens, commonly known as the brown planthopper, which feeds on rice phloem sap and can cause serious damage to rice fields. In order to protect themselves, plants express a wide array of defense proteins such as ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs). This study shows that the expression of 'OsRIP1' is highly induced in rice plants infested with N. lugens, with transcript levels more than 100-fold upregulated in infested plants compared to non-infested plants. Furthermore, recombinant OsRIP1 was toxic for brown planthoppers when administered through liquid artificial diet. OsRIP1 inactivated insect ribosomes in vitro, suggesting that its toxicity relates to the enzymatic activity of OsRIP1. Over-expression of OsRIP1 in transgenic rice plants did not affect the performance of insects reared on these plants, most likely due to insufficient concentrations of OsRIP1 in the phloem. The data obtained in this research indicate that OsRIP1 can play a role in plant defense against herbivorous insects.
NA	Effect of RIP Overexpression on Abiotic Stress Tolerance and Development of Rice	2021	Int J Mol Sci	Laboratory of Biochemistry and Glycobiology, Department of Biotechnology, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.	Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) are a class of cytotoxic enzymes that can inhibit protein translation by depurinating rRNA. Most plant RIPs are synthesized with a leader sequence that sequesters the proteins to a cell compartment away from the host ribosomes. However, several rice RIPs lack these signal peptides suggesting they reside in the cytosol in close proximity to the plant ribosomes. This paper aims to elucidate the physiological function of two nucleocytoplasmic RIPs from rice, in particular, the type 1 RIP referred to as OsRIP1 and a presumed type 3 RIP called nuRIP. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing these RIPs were constructed and studied for developmental effects resulting from this overexpression under greenhouse conditions. In addition, the performance of transgenic seedlings in response to drought, salt, abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate treatment was investigated. Results suggest that both RIPs can affect methyl jasmonate mediated stress responses.
