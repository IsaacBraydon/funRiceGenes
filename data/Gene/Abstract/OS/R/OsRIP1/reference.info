NA	Involvement of OsRIP1, a ribosome-inactivating protein from rice, in plant defense against Nilaparvata lugens.	2019	Phytochemistry	Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Coupure links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; Department of Plants and Crops, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Coupure links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.	Rice is the most important staple food in the world, but rice production is challenged by several biotic stress factors like viruses, bacteria, fungi and pest insects. One of the most notorious pest insects is Nilaparvata lugens, commonly known as the brown planthopper, which feeds on rice phloem sap and can cause serious damage to rice fields. In order to protect themselves, plants express a wide array of defense proteins such as ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs). This study shows that the expression of 'OsRIP1' is highly induced in rice plants infested with N. lugens, with transcript levels more than 100-fold upregulated in infested plants compared to non-infested plants. Furthermore, recombinant OsRIP1 was toxic for brown planthoppers when administered through liquid artificial diet. OsRIP1 inactivated insect ribosomes in vitro, suggesting that its toxicity relates to the enzymatic activity of OsRIP1. Over-expression of OsRIP1 in transgenic rice plants did not affect the performance of insects reared on these plants, most likely due to insufficient concentrations of OsRIP1 in the phloem. The data obtained in this research indicate that OsRIP1 can play a role in plant defense against herbivorous insects.
NA	Effect of RIP Overexpression on Abiotic Stress Tolerance and Development of Rice	2021	Int J Mol Sci	Laboratory of Biochemistry and Glycobiology, Department of Biotechnology, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.	Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) are a class of cytotoxic enzymes that can inhibit protein translation by depurinating rRNA. Most plant RIPs are synthesized with a leader sequence that sequesters the proteins to a cell compartment away from the host ribosomes. However, several rice RIPs lack these signal peptides suggesting they reside in the cytosol in close proximity to the plant ribosomes. This paper aims to elucidate the physiological function of two nucleocytoplasmic RIPs from rice, in particular, the type 1 RIP referred to as OsRIP1 and a presumed type 3 RIP called nuRIP. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing these RIPs were constructed and studied for developmental effects resulting from this overexpression under greenhouse conditions. In addition, the performance of transgenic seedlings in response to drought, salt, abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate treatment was investigated. Results suggest that both RIPs can affect methyl jasmonate mediated stress responses.
NA	The type-1 ribosome inactivating protein OsRIP1 triggers caspase-independent apoptotic-like death in HeLa cells.	2021	Food Chem Toxicol	Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Coupure links 653, B-9000, Ghent, Belgium.	Ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) are capable of removing a specific adenine from 28S ribosomal RNA, thus inhibiting protein biosynthesis in an irreversible manner. In this study, recombinant OsRIP1, a type 1 RIP from rice (Oryza sativa L.), was investigated for its anti-proliferative properties. Human cervical cancer HeLa cells were incubated in the presence of OsRIP1 for 24-72â€¯h OsRIP1 treatment yielded an anti-proliferation response of the HeLa cells and resulted in apoptotic-like blebbing of the plasma membrane without causing DNA fragmentation. OsRIP1 labeled with FITC accumulated at the cell surface. Pull-down assays identified ASPP1 (Apoptosis-Stimulating Protein of p53 1) and IFITM3 (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3) as potential interaction partners for OsRIP1. Transcript levels for several critical genes related to different signaling pathways were quantified by RT-qPCR. OsRIP1 provoked HeLa cells to undergo caspase-independent cell death, associated with a significant transcriptional upregulation of the apoptotic gene PUMA, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and the autophagy-related marker LC3. No changes in caspase activities were observed. Together, these data suggest that apoptotic-like events were involved in OsRIP1-driven caspase-independent cell death that might trigger the IRF1 signaling pathway and LC3-mediated autophagy.
NA	Differential effects of the recombinant type 1 ribosome-inactivating protein, OsRIP1, on growth of PSB-D and BY-2 cells.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.	Plant suspension cells were treated with recombinant OsRIP1, a type 1 ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) from rice (Oryza sativa L.). OsRIP1 triggered cell death in tobacco BY-2 cells but not in Arabidopsis PSB-D cells. Phenotypic changes in BY-2 cells exposed to OsRIP1, included loss of growth capacity, loss of integrity of the plasma membrane and vacuolar collapse. These effects were also accompanied by RNA degradation and DNA fragmentation. Targeting of exogenous OsRIP1 to plant vacuoles and OsRIP1-induced accumulation of transcripts for vacuolar processing enzymes (VPEs) indicated that OsRIP1 provoked plant cell death in tobacco BY-2 cells through the activation of VPEs and subsequent vacuolar disruption, which was probably independent of its N-glycosylase activity on cytosolic ribosomes. Necrosis with limited production of H(2)O(2) was observed after infiltration of high concentrations of OsRIP1 in epidermal cells of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Samsun NN plants. Our study provides the first evidence that OsRIP1 exerts differential effects on the growth of PSB-D and BY-2 cells. The vacuole-dependent cell death pathway is associated with the lethal effect of the exogenously applied OsRIP1 on BY-2 cells.
