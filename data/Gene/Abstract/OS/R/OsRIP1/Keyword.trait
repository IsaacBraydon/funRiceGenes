OsRIP1|OsjRIP1.1	defense	Involvement of OsRIP1, a ribosome-inactivating protein from rice, in plant defense against Nilaparvata lugens.	 The data obtained in this research indicate that OsRIP1 can play a role in plant defense against herbivorous insects
OsRIP1|OsjRIP1.1	insect	Involvement of OsRIP1, a ribosome-inactivating protein from rice, in plant defense against Nilaparvata lugens.	 OsRIP1 inactivated insect ribosomes in vitro, suggesting that its toxicity relates to the enzymatic activity of OsRIP1
OsRIP1|OsjRIP1.1	brown planthopper	Involvement of OsRIP1, a ribosome-inactivating protein from rice, in plant defense against Nilaparvata lugens.	 Furthermore, recombinant OsRIP1 was toxic for brown planthoppers when administered through liquid artificial diet
OsRIP1|OsjRIP1.1	phloem	Involvement of OsRIP1, a ribosome-inactivating protein from rice, in plant defense against Nilaparvata lugens.	 Over-expression of OsRIP1 in transgenic rice plants did not affect the performance of insects reared on these plants, most likely due to insufficient concentrations of OsRIP1 in the phloem
OsRIP1|OsjRIP1.1	cell death	The type-1 ribosome inactivating protein OsRIP1 triggers caspase-independent apoptotic-like death in HeLa cells.	 OsRIP1 provoked HeLa cells to undergo caspase-independent cell death, associated with a significant transcriptional upregulation of the apoptotic gene PUMA, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and the autophagy-related marker LC3
OsRIP1|OsjRIP1.1	plasma membrane	The type-1 ribosome inactivating protein OsRIP1 triggers caspase-independent apoptotic-like death in HeLa cells.	 Human cervical cancer HeLa cells were incubated in the presence of OsRIP1 for 24-72â€¯h OsRIP1 treatment yielded an anti-proliferation response of the HeLa cells and resulted in apoptotic-like blebbing of the plasma membrane without causing DNA fragmentation
OsRIP1|OsjRIP1.1	growth	Differential effects of the recombinant type 1 ribosome-inactivating protein, OsRIP1, on growth of PSB-D and BY-2 cells.	 Our study provides the first evidence that OsRIP1 exerts differential effects on the growth of PSB-D and BY-2 cells
OsRIP1|OsjRIP1.1	cell death	Differential effects of the recombinant type 1 ribosome-inactivating protein, OsRIP1, on growth of PSB-D and BY-2 cells.	 OsRIP1 triggered cell death in tobacco BY-2 cells but not in Arabidopsis PSB-D cells
OsRIP1|OsjRIP1.1	cell death	Differential effects of the recombinant type 1 ribosome-inactivating protein, OsRIP1, on growth of PSB-D and BY-2 cells.	 Targeting of exogenous OsRIP1 to plant vacuoles and OsRIP1-induced accumulation of transcripts for vacuolar processing enzymes (VPEs) indicated that OsRIP1 provoked plant cell death in tobacco BY-2 cells through the activation of VPEs and subsequent vacuolar disruption, which was probably independent of its N-glycosylase activity on cytosolic ribosomes
OsRIP1|OsjRIP1.1	cell death	Differential effects of the recombinant type 1 ribosome-inactivating protein, OsRIP1, on growth of PSB-D and BY-2 cells.	 The vacuole-dependent cell death pathway is associated with the lethal effect of the exogenously applied OsRIP1 on BY-2 cells
