OsRIP1	defense	Involvement of OsRIP1, a ribosome-inactivating protein from rice, in plant defense against Nilaparvata lugens.	 The data obtained in this research indicate that OsRIP1 can play a role in plant defense against herbivorous insects
OsRIP1	insect	Involvement of OsRIP1, a ribosome-inactivating protein from rice, in plant defense against Nilaparvata lugens.	 OsRIP1 inactivated insect ribosomes in vitro, suggesting that its toxicity relates to the enzymatic activity of OsRIP1
OsRIP1	brown planthopper	Involvement of OsRIP1, a ribosome-inactivating protein from rice, in plant defense against Nilaparvata lugens.	 Furthermore, recombinant OsRIP1 was toxic for brown planthoppers when administered through liquid artificial diet
OsRIP1	phloem	Involvement of OsRIP1, a ribosome-inactivating protein from rice, in plant defense against Nilaparvata lugens.	 Over-expression of OsRIP1 in transgenic rice plants did not affect the performance of insects reared on these plants, most likely due to insufficient concentrations of OsRIP1 in the phloem
