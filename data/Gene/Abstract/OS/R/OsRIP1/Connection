OsbZIP01|OsRE1	OsRIP1|OsjRIP1.1	OsRE1 interacts with OsRIP1 to regulate rice heading date by finely modulating Ehd1 expression	OsRE1 interacts with OsRIP1 to regulate rice heading date by finely modulating Ehd1 expression
OsbZIP01|OsRE1	OsRIP1|OsjRIP1.1	OsRE1 interacts with OsRIP1 to regulate rice heading date by finely modulating Ehd1 expression	 Our genetic data showed that OsRE1 and OsRIP1 may function upstream of Ehd1 in regulating heading date
OsbZIP01|OsRE1	OsRIP1|OsjRIP1.1	OsRE1 interacts with OsRIP1 to regulate rice heading date by finely modulating Ehd1 expression	 Together, our results suggest that OsRE1 functions cooperatively with OsRIP1 to regulate heading date through finely modulating the expression of Ehd1
OsbZIP01|OsRE1	OsRIP1|OsjRIP1.1	OsRE1 interacts with OsRIP1 to regulate rice heading date by finely modulating Ehd1 expression	 In addition, OsRE1 and OsRIP1 are two minor heading date regulators, which are more desirable for fine-tuning heading date to improve rice regional adaptability
nuRIP|OsjRIP11.2	OsRIP1|OsjRIP1.1	Effect of RIP Overexpression on Abiotic Stress Tolerance and Development of Rice	 This paper aims to elucidate the physiological function of two nucleocytoplasmic RIPs from rice, in particular, the type 1 RIP referred to as OsRIP1 and a presumed type 3 RIP called nuRIP
