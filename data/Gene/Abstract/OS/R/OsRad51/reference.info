The protein was over expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified. Purified OsRad51 could bind single and double stranded DNA, however it showed higher affinity for single stranded DNA. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) studies of OsRad51-DNA complexes showed that this protein formed ring like structures and bound DNA forming filaments. OsRad51 protein promoted renaturation of complementary single strands in to duplex DNA molecules and also showed ATPase activity, which was stimulated by single strand DNA. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays revealed that OsRad51 promoted homology dependent renaturation as well as strand exchange reactions. Renaturation activity was ATP dependent; however strand exchange activity was ATP independent. This is the first report on in vitro characterization of Rad51 protein from crop plants.
NA	Rice OsBRCA2 Is Required for DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Meiotic Cells	2020	Front Plant Sci .	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University-University of Adelaide Joint Centre for Agriculture and Health, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.	The mammalian BREAST CANCER 2 (BRCA2) gene is a tumor suppressor that plays a crucial role in DNA repair and homologous recombination (HR). Here, we report the identification and characterization of OsBRCA2, the rice orthologue of human BRCA2. Osbrca2 mutant plants exhibit normal vegetative growth but experience complete male and female sterility as a consequence of severe meiotic defects. Pairing, synapsis and recombination are impaired in osbrca2 male meiocytes, leading to chromosome entanglements and fragmentation. In the absence of OsBRCA2, localization to the meiotic chromosome axes of the strand-invasion proteins OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 is severely reduced and in vitro OsBRCA2 directly interacts with OsRAD51 and OsDMC1. These results indicate that OsBRCA2 is essential for facilitating the loading of OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 onto resected ends of programmed double-strand breaks (DSB) during meiosis to promote single-end invasions of homologous chromosomes and accurate recombination. In addition, treatment of osbrca2-1 seedlings with mitomycin C (MMC) led to hypersensitivity. As MMC is a genotoxic agent that creates DNA lesions in the somatic cells that can only be repaired by HR, these results suggest that OsBRCA2 has a conserved role in DSB repair and HR in rice.
NA	OsRAD51 Plays a Vital Role in Promoting Homologous Recombination in Rice Meiosis.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	College of Life Science, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China.	Meiotic recombination plays a pivotal role in achieving accurate chromosomal segregation and increasing genetic diversity. In the homologous recombination pathway, the detailed mechanisms of how OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 work in rice meiosis remain to be explored. Here, we obtained different types of mutants for Osrad51a1, Osrad51a2, Osdmc1a, and Osdmc1b through CRISPR/Cas9. Both Osrad51a1 and Osrad51a2 exhibited normal vegetative growth and fertility. Osrad51 (Osrad51a1 Osrad51a2) mutant plants show normal vegetative growth but exhibit complete sterility, indicating that OsRAD51A1 and OsRAD51A2 are functionally redundant in rice fertility. In contrast to the wild type, Osrad51 chromosomes are not paired perfectly at pachytene and synaptonemal complex (SC) formation is deficient. Moreover, univalents and multivalent associations were observed at metaphase I, chromosome fragments presented at anaphase I, and crossover formation is basically suppressed in Osrad51 pollen mother cells (PMCs). OsRAD51 foci emerge at leptotene and disappear from late pachytene and chromosome localization of OsRAD51 depends on the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs). Most OsRAD51 foci can co-localize with OsDMC1 signals. OsRAD51 is essential for the loading of OsDMC1 onto chromosomes, and vice versa. In addition, both OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 can interact with OsFIGL1 and OsBRCA2, two important components in rice meiosis. Moreover, the Osrad51 Osdmc1 (Osrad51a1 Osrad51a2 Osdmc1a Osdmc1b) quadruple mutant PMCs exhibited similar defective phenotypes as Osrad51 in homologous pairing, synapsis, and DSB repair. Taken together, our results suggest that the recombinases DMC1 and RAD51 may functionally depend on each other and play important roles in meiotic recombination during meiosis in rice.
NA	Natural variation of codon repeats in COLD11 endows rice with chilling resilience.	2023	Sci Adv	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	Abnormal temperature caused by global climate change threatens the rice production. Defense signaling network for chilling has been uncovered in plants. However, less is known about repairing DNA damage produced from overwhelmed defense and its evolution during domestication. Here, we genetically identified a major QTL, COLD11, using the data-merging genome-wide association study based on an algorithm combining polarized data from two subspecies, indica and japonica, into one system. Rice loss-of-function mutations of COLD11 caused reduced chilling tolerance. Genome evolution analysis of representative rice germplasms suggested that numbers of GCG sequence repeats in the first exon of COLD11 were subjected to strong domestication selection during the northern expansion of rice planting. The repeat numbers affected the biochemical activity of DNA repair protein COLD11/RAD51A1 in renovating DNA damage under chilling stress. Our findings highlight a potential way to finely manipulate key genes in rice genome and effectively improve chilling tolerance through molecular designing.
