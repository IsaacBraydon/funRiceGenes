OsNAPL6	OsRad51|OsRad51A1	A NAP-family histone chaperone acts in abiotic stress response and adaptation.	For instance, we show that OsNAPL6 is recruited to OsRad51 promoter activating its expression, leading to a more efficient DNA repair and abrogation of programmed cell death under salinity and genotoxic stress conditions
OsRad51|OsRad51A1	OsRAD51D	OsRAD51D promotes homologous pairing and recombination by preventing non-homologous interactions in rice meiosis.	 The failed localization of OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 in Osrad51d, together with the genetic analysis of Osrad51d Osdmc1a Osdmc1b, indicates that OsRAD51D acts at a very early stage of HR
