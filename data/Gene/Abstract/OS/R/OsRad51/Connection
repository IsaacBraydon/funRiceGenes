OsNAPL6	OsRad51|OsRad51A1	A NAP-family histone chaperone acts in abiotic stress response and adaptation.	For instance, we show that OsNAPL6 is recruited to OsRad51 promoter activating its expression, leading to a more efficient DNA repair and abrogation of programmed cell death under salinity and genotoxic stress conditions
