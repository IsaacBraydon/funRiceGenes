OsRZ1	cold stress	Structural features important for the RNA chaperone activity of zinc finger-containing glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins from wheat (Triticum avestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa)	 Although the amino acid sequence similarity among wheat TaRZ2, wheat TaRZ3, and rice OsRZ1 was high, only TaRZ2 had RNA chaperone activity as evidenced by complementation ability in cold-sensitive Escherichia coli mutant cell under cold stress and in vivo and in vitro nucleic acid-melting activity
