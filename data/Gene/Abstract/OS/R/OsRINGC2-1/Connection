OsRINGC2-1	OsRINGC2-2	Molecular characterization and concerted evolution of two genes encoding RING-C2 type proteins in rice	 We isolated two rice genes harboring the RING-C2 domain on the distal parts of rice chromosomes 11 and 12, termed OsRINGC2-1 and OsRINGC2-2, respectively
OsRINGC2-1	OsRINGC2-2	Molecular characterization and concerted evolution of two genes encoding RING-C2 type proteins in rice	 A comparison of sequence divergences between 10 duplicate pairs on the distal parts of rice chromosomes 11 and 12 and randomly selected duplicate pairs suggested that OsRINGC2-1 and OsRINGC2-2 have evolved in concert via gene conversion
OsRINGC2-1	OsRINGC2-2	Molecular characterization and concerted evolution of two genes encoding RING-C2 type proteins in rice	 Subcellular localizations were strikingly different; OsRINGC2-1 was found only in the cytoplasm with many punctate complexes, whereas OsRINGC2-2 was observed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm
OsRINGC2-1	OsRINGC2-2	Molecular characterization and concerted evolution of two genes encoding RING-C2 type proteins in rice	 These results shed light on the molecular functions of OsRINGC2-1 and OsRINGC2-2 and provide insight into their molecular evolution
