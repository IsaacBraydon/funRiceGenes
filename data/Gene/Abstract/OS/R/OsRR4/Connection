OsRR3	OsRR4	Biochemical and molecular characterisation of exogenous cytokinin application on grain filling in rice.	 Expression studies of type-A response regulator (RR) component of cytokinin signaling indicated possible role of OsRR3, OsRR4 and OsRR6 as repressors of CKX expression, much needed for an increased accumulation of CK in cells
