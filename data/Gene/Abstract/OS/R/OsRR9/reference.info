We identified four histidine kinase (HK) genes of a cytokinin receptor family, two histidine-containing phosphotransmitter (HPt) genes, thirteen A-type response regulator (RR) genes and six B-type RR genes in the rice genome. The HK genes (OHK2, OHK3, OHK4 and OHK5 for Oryza sativa HK), the HPt genes (OHP1 and OHP2 for O. sativa HPt) and the B-type RR genes (ORR1, ORR2, ORR3, ORR4 and ORR6 for O. sativa RR) except one (ORR5) showed expression in various organs. ORR5 was expressed in callus and flower. Three A-type RR genes (OsRR4, OsRR9 and OsRR10 for O. sativa RR) showed cytokinin-induced expression, and three (OsRR8, OsRR12 and OsRR13) showed expression in flower. We also identified two other genes named OHK1 and CHARK (CHASE domain Receptor-like serine/threonine Kinase). OHK1 encodes an HK similar to Arabidopsis CKI1, which is involved in female gametophyte development. CHARK encodes a protein with an extracellular cytokinin-perceiving CHASE domain and a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain which are connected with a single transmembrane domain. The presence of all four gene families and CHARK in the rice genome suggests that a cytokinin signal is transduced by the phosphotransfer mechanism as is the case in Arabidopsis, and that rice may have an additional novel signalling pathway involving serine/threonine phosphorylation.

The aim of this study was to characterize type-A response regulator genes from rice, and to investigate their expression in various organs as well as in response to different hormones, including cytokinin, and environmental stimuli. RESULTS: By analysis of the whole genome sequence of rice, we have identified ten genes encoding type-A response regulators based upon their high sequence identity within the receiver domain. The exon-intron organization, intron-phasing as well as chromosomal location of all the RT-PCR amplified rice (Oryza sativa) response regulator (OsRR) genes have been analyzed. The transcripts of OsRR genes could be detected by real-time PCR in all organs of the light- and dark-grown rice seedlings/plants, although there were quantitative differences. The steady-state transcript levels of most of the OsRR genes increased rapidly (within 15 min) on exogenous cytokinin application even in the presence of cycloheximide. Moreover, the expression of the OsRR6 gene was enhanced in rice seedlings exposed to salinity, dehydration and low temperature stress. CONCLUSION: Ten type-A response regulator genes identified in rice, the model monocot plant, show overlapping/differential expression patterns in various organs and in response to light. The induction of OsRR genes by cytokinin even in the absence of de novo protein synthesis qualifies them to be primary cytokinin response genes. The induction of OsRR6 in response to different environmental stimuli indicates its role in cross-talk between abiotic stress and cytokinin signaling. These results provide a foundation for further investigations on specific as well as overlapping cellular functions of type-A response regulators in rice.
NA	Response Regulator 9 and 10 Negatively Regulate Salinity Tolerance in Rice.	2019	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Agronomy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.	Cytokinins are involved in many plant growth and development processes, which also has been shown to function in abiotic stress response. Cytokinin signaling is similar to prokaryotic two-component pathways and includes the transcriptional up-regulation of type-A response regulators (RRs) by cytokinin, which in turn act to inhibit cytokinin responses to provide a negative feedback loop. Cytokinin signaling is composed of several gene families and only a handful full of genes have been studied. Here, we demonstrated the function of two highly identical rice type-A response regulators, OsRR9 and OsRR10, which are both induced by cytokinin and repressed by salinity stress in rice. Loss-of-function osrr9/osrr10 mutants have higher salinity tolerance than wild-type rice seedlings. The transcriptomic analysis uncovered several ion transporters genes which were up-regulated in response to salt in the osrr9/osrr10 mutants relative to the wild-type seedlings. These include high-affinity potassium transporters, such as OsHKT1;1, OsHKT1;3, and OsHKT2;1, which play an important role in sodium and potassium homeostasis. In addition, disruption of OsRR9 and OsRR10 also affects the expression of multiple genes related to photosynthesis, transcription activity, and phytohormone signaling. Together, these results suggest that OsRR9 and OsRR10 function as negative regulators in rice salinity tolerance.
NA	Identification of a small set of genes commonly regulated in rice roots in response to beneficial rhizobacteria	2020	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	Ecologie Microbienne, CNRS UMR-5557, INRAe UMR-1418, VetAgroSup, Universit¨¦ de Lyon, Universit¨¦ Lyon1, 16 rue Dubois, 69622 Villeurbanne, France.	Rhizosphere bacteria, whether phytopathogenic or phytobeneficial, are thought to be perceived by the plant as a threat. Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR), such as many strains of the Azospirillum genus known as the main phytostimulator of cereals, cooperate with host plants and favorably affect their growth and health. An earlier study of rice root transcriptome, undertaken with two rice cultivars and two Azospirillum strains, revealed a strain-dependent response during the rice-Azospirillum association and showed that only a few genes, including some implicated in plant defense, were commonly regulated in all tested conditions. Here, a set of genes was selected from previous studies and their expression was monitored by qRT-PCR in rice roots inoculated with ten PGPR strains isolated from various plants and belonging to various genera (Azospirillum, Herbaspirillum, Paraburkholderia). A common expression pattern was highlighted for four genes that are proposed to be markers of the rice-PGPR interaction: two genes involved in diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis (OsDXS3 and OsDTC2) and one coding for an uncharacterized protein (Os02g0582900) were significantly induced by PGPR whereas one defense-related gene encoding a pathogenesis-related protein (PR1b, Os01g0382000) was significantly repressed. Interestingly, exposure to a rice bacterial pathogen also triggered the expression of OsDXS3 while the expression of Os02g0582900 and PR1b was down-regulated, suggesting that these genes might play a key role in rice-bacteria interactions. Integration of these results with previous data led us to propose that the jasmonic acid signaling pathway might be triggered in rice roots upon inoculation with PGPR.
