OsRR9	salinity	Response Regulator 9 and 10 Negatively Regulate Salinity Tolerance in Rice.	 Here, we demonstrated the function of two highly identical rice type-A response regulators, OsRR9 and OsRR10, which are both induced by cytokinin and repressed by salinity stress in rice
OsRR9	salinity	Response Regulator 9 and 10 Negatively Regulate Salinity Tolerance in Rice.	 Together, these results suggest that OsRR9 and OsRR10 function as negative regulators in rice salinity tolerance
OsRR9	tolerance	Response Regulator 9 and 10 Negatively Regulate Salinity Tolerance in Rice.	 Together, these results suggest that OsRR9 and OsRR10 function as negative regulators in rice salinity tolerance
OsRR9	cytokinin	Response Regulator 9 and 10 Negatively Regulate Salinity Tolerance in Rice.	 Here, we demonstrated the function of two highly identical rice type-A response regulators, OsRR9 and OsRR10, which are both induced by cytokinin and repressed by salinity stress in rice
OsRR9	stress	Response Regulator 9 and 10 Negatively Regulate Salinity Tolerance in Rice.	 Here, we demonstrated the function of two highly identical rice type-A response regulators, OsRR9 and OsRR10, which are both induced by cytokinin and repressed by salinity stress in rice
OsRR9	salinity stress	Response Regulator 9 and 10 Negatively Regulate Salinity Tolerance in Rice.	 Here, we demonstrated the function of two highly identical rice type-A response regulators, OsRR9 and OsRR10, which are both induced by cytokinin and repressed by salinity stress in rice
OsRR9	phytohormone	Response Regulator 9 and 10 Negatively Regulate Salinity Tolerance in Rice.	 In addition, disruption of OsRR9 and OsRR10 also affects the expression of multiple genes related to photosynthesis, transcription activity, and phytohormone signaling
