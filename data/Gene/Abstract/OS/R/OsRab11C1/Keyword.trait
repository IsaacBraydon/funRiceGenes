OsRab11C1	seedling	Association Mapping and Functional Analysis of Rice Cold Tolerance QTLs at the Bud Burst Stage.	 Overexpression of OsRab11C1 significantly reduced CTB, while gene knockout elevated CTB as well as cold tolerance at the seedling stage, suggesting that OsRab11C1 negatively regulates rice cold tolerance
OsRab11C1	tolerance	Association Mapping and Functional Analysis of Rice Cold Tolerance QTLs at the Bud Burst Stage.	 Overexpression of OsRab11C1 significantly reduced CTB, while gene knockout elevated CTB as well as cold tolerance at the seedling stage, suggesting that OsRab11C1 negatively regulates rice cold tolerance
OsRab11C1	tolerance	Association Mapping and Functional Analysis of Rice Cold Tolerance QTLs at the Bud Burst Stage.	 Molecular analysis revealed that OsRab11C1 modulates cold tolerance by suppressing the abscisic acid signalling pathway and proline biosynthesis
OsRab11C1	tolerance	Association Mapping and Functional Analysis of Rice Cold Tolerance QTLs at the Bud Burst Stage.	 Using RDP II and GWAS, we identified four qCTBs that are involved in CTB and determined the function of the candidate gene OsRab11C1 in cold tolerance
OsRab11C1	tolerance	Association Mapping and Functional Analysis of Rice Cold Tolerance QTLs at the Bud Burst Stage.	 Our results demonstrate that OsRab11C1 is a negative regulator of cold tolerance and knocking out of the gene by genome-editing may provide enhanced cold tolerance in rice
