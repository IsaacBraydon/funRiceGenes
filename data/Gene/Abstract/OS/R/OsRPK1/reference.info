AtRPK1 (AT1G69270) is a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase (LRR-RLK) gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. The rice gene Os07g0602700 (OsRPK1) is the homolog of AtRPK1. AtRPK1 and OsRPK1 were overexpressed and the expression of AtRPK1 was inhibited by RNAi in A. thaliana. The functional results showed that the degrees of salt tolerance of the 35S:RPK1 A. thaliana plants were significantly lower than that of the control plants. The AtRPK1-RNAi A. thaliana plants exhibited higher salt tolerance than the wild-type plants (Col). The subcellular localisation results showed that the RPK1 proteins were mainly distributed on the cell membrane and that the overexpressed AtRPK1 proteins exhibited a significantly clustered distribution. The physiological analyses revealed that the overexpression of the RPK1 genes increased the membrane permeability in the transgenic A. thaliana plants. In response to salt stress, these plants exhibited an increased Na(+) flux into the cell, which caused greater damage to the cell. The real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that the expression of the P5CS1 gene was inhibited and the SOS signalling pathway was blocked in the 35S:AtRPK1 A. thaliana plants. These effects at least partially contribute to the salt-sensitive phenotype of the 35S:RPK1 plants.

BACKGROUND: Leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) represent the largest subfamily of putative RLKs in plants. Although several members in this subfamily have been identified, the studies about the relationships between LRR-RLKs and root development are still few. We previously identified a novel LRR-RLK in rice roots, and named it OsRPK1. METHODS: In this study, we first detected OsRPK1 kinase activity in vitro, and assessed its expression profile. We then investigated its biological function using transgenic rice plants over- and under-expressing OsRPK1. RESULTS: The OsRPK1 gene, which encodes a Ca(2+)-independent Ser/Thr kinase, was predominantly expressed in root tips, leaf blades, and undifferentiated suspension cells, and was markedly induced by treatment with auxin or ABA. Knockdown of OsRPK1 promoted the growth of transgenic rice plants, and increased plant height and tiller numbers. In contrast, over-expressing plants showed undeveloped adventitious roots, lateral roots, and a reduced root apical meristem. OsRPK1 over-expression also inhibited the expression of most auxin efflux carrier OsPIN genes, which was accompanied by changes in PAT and endogenous free IAA distribution in the leaves and roots. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicated that OsRPK1, a novel leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinase, affects the root system architecture by negatively regulating polar auxin transport in rice. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrated a common regulatory pathway of root system development in higher plants, which might be initiated by external stimuli via upstream receptor-like kinases and downstream carriers for polar auxin transport.
3100_ftp.pdf	New changes in the plasma-membrane-associated proteome of rice roots under salt stress	2009	Proteomics	Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Life Science, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PR China.	To gain a better understanding of salt stress responses in plants, we used a proteomic approach to investigate changes in rice (Oryza sativa) root plasma-membrane-associated proteins following treatment with 150 mmol/L NaCl. With or without a 48 h salt treatment, plasma membrane fractions from root tip cells of a salt-sensitive rice cultivar, Wuyunjing 8, were purified by PEG aqueous two-phase partitioning, and plasma-membrane-associated proteins were separated by IEF/SDS-PAGE using an optimized rehydration buffer. Comparative analysis of three independent biological replicates revealed that the expressions of 18 proteins changed by more than 1.5-fold in response to salt stress. Of these proteins, nine were up-regulated and nine were down-regulated. MS analysis indicated that most of these membrane-associated proteins are involved in important physiological processes such as membrane stabilization, ion homeostasis, and signal transduction. In addition, a new leucine-rich-repeat type receptor-like protein kinase, OsRPK1, was identified as a salt-responding protein. Immuno-blots indicated that OsRPK1 is also induced by cold, drought, and abscisic acid. Using immuno-histochemical techniques, we determined that the expression of OsRPK1 was localized in the plasma membrane of cortex cells in roots. The results suggest that different rice cultivars might have different salt stress response mechanisms.
