OsRPA1a	meiosis	Replication protein A (RPA1a) is required for meiotic and somatic DNA repair but is dispensable for DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice	 Compared with wild type, the osrpa1a mutant showed no visible defects in mitosis and chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis
OsRPA1a	sterile	Replication protein A (RPA1a) is required for meiotic and somatic DNA repair but is dispensable for DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice	 The osrpa1a mutants had a normal phenotype during vegetative growth but were sterile at the reproductive stage
OsRPA1a	growth	Replication protein A (RPA1a) is required for meiotic and somatic DNA repair but is dispensable for DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice	 The osrpa1a mutants had a normal phenotype during vegetative growth but were sterile at the reproductive stage
OsRPA1a	vegetative	Replication protein A (RPA1a) is required for meiotic and somatic DNA repair but is dispensable for DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice	 The osrpa1a mutants had a normal phenotype during vegetative growth but were sterile at the reproductive stage
OsRPA1a	mitosis	Replication protein A (RPA1a) is required for meiotic and somatic DNA repair but is dispensable for DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice	 Compared with wild type, the osrpa1a mutant showed no visible defects in mitosis and chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis
OsRPA1a	reproductive	Replication protein A (RPA1a) is required for meiotic and somatic DNA repair but is dispensable for DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice	 The osrpa1a mutants had a normal phenotype during vegetative growth but were sterile at the reproductive stage
