Plant Physiol.-2009-Chang-2162-73.pdf	Replication protein A (RPA1a) is required for meiotic and somatic DNA repair but is dispensable for DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice	2009	Plant Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Replication protein A (RPA), a highly conserved single-stranded DNA-binding protein in eukaryotes, is a stable complex comprising three subunits termed RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3. RPA is required for multiple processes in DNA metabolism such as replication, repair, and homologous recombination in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and human. Most eukaryotic organisms, including fungi, insects, and vertebrates, have only a single RPA gene that encodes each RPA subunit. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa), however, possess multiple copies of an RPA gene. Rice has three paralogs each of RPA1 and RPA2, and one for RPA3. Previous studies have established their biochemical interactions in vitro and in vivo, but little is known about their exact function in rice. We examined the function of OsRPA1a in rice using a T-DNA insertional mutant. The osrpa1a mutants had a normal phenotype during vegetative growth but were sterile at the reproductive stage. Cytological examination confirmed that no embryo sac formed in female meiocytes and that abnormal chromosomal fragmentation occurred in male meiocytes after anaphase I. Compared with wild type, the osrpa1a mutant showed no visible defects in mitosis and chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis. In addition, the osrpa1a mutant was hypersensitive to ultraviolet-C irradiation and the DNA-damaging agents mitomycin C and methyl methanesulfonate. Thus, our data suggest that OsRPA1a plays an essential role in DNA repair but may not participate in, or at least is dispensable for, DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice.
NA	CHR721, interacting with OsRPA1a, is essential for both male and female reproductive development in rice 	2020	Plant Mol Biol	National Centre for Plant Gene Research, State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 1 West Beichen Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100101, People's Republic of China.	CHR721 functions as a chromatin remodeler and interacts with a known single-stranded binding protein, OsRPA1a, to regulate both male and female reproductive development in rice. Reproductive development and fertility are important for seed production in rice. Here, we identified a sterile rice mutant, chr721, that exhibited defects in both male and female reproductive development. Approximately 5% of the observed defects in chr721, such as asynchronous dyad division, occurred during anaphase II of meiosis. During the mitotic stage, approximately 80% of uninucleate microspores failed to develop into tricellular pollen, leading to abnormal development. In addition, defects in megaspore development were detected after functional megaspore formation. CHR721, which encodes a nuclear protein belonging to the SNF2 subfamily SMARCAL1, was identified by map-based cloning. CHR721 was expressed in various tissues, especially in spikelets. CHR721 was found to interact with replication protein A (OsRPA1a), which is involved in DNA repair. The expressions of genes involved in DNA repair and cell-cycle checkpoints were consistently upregulated in chr721. Although numerous genes involved in male and female development have been identified, the mode of participation of chromatin-remodeling factors in reproductive development is still not well understood. Our results suggest that CHR721, a novel gene cloned from rice, plays a vital role in both male and female reproductive development.
