OsRLR4	root	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.
OsRLR4	root	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	 Here, the two loss-of-function T-DNA insertion mutants of root length regulator 4 (OsRLR4), osrlr4-1 and osrlr4-2 with longer PR, and three OsRLR4 overexpression lines, OE-OsRLR4-1/-2/-3 with shorter PR compared to the wild type, Hwayoung (WT/HY), were identified
OsRLR4	root	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	 OsRLR4 controls PR development by regulating auxin accumulation in the PR tip and thus the root apical meristem activity
OsRLR4	development	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.
OsRLR4	development	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	 OsRLR4 controls PR development by regulating auxin accumulation in the PR tip and thus the root apical meristem activity
OsRLR4	auxin	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	 OsRLR4 controls PR development by regulating auxin accumulation in the PR tip and thus the root apical meristem activity
OsRLR4	auxin	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	 A series of biochemical and genetic analyses demonstrated that OsRLR4 functions directly upstream of the auxin transporter OsAUX1
OsRLR4	domestication	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	 Phylogenetic analysis of OsRLR4 from wild and cultivated rice indicated that it is under selective sweeps, suggesting its potential role in domestication
OsRLR4	root development	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.
OsRLR4	meristem	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	 OsRLR4 controls PR development by regulating auxin accumulation in the PR tip and thus the root apical meristem activity
OsRLR4	transporter	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	 A series of biochemical and genetic analyses demonstrated that OsRLR4 functions directly upstream of the auxin transporter OsAUX1
OsRLR4	auxin transport	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	 A series of biochemical and genetic analyses demonstrated that OsRLR4 functions directly upstream of the auxin transporter OsAUX1
OsRLR4	root apical meristem	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	 OsRLR4 controls PR development by regulating auxin accumulation in the PR tip and thus the root apical meristem activity
OsRLR4	primary root	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.
OsRLR4	root length	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	 Here, the two loss-of-function T-DNA insertion mutants of root length regulator 4 (OsRLR4), osrlr4-1 and osrlr4-2 with longer PR, and three OsRLR4 overexpression lines, OE-OsRLR4-1/-2/-3 with shorter PR compared to the wild type, Hwayoung (WT/HY), were identified
