OsAUX1	OsRLR4	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.
OsAUX1	OsRLR4	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	 A series of biochemical and genetic analyses demonstrated that OsRLR4 functions directly upstream of the auxin transporter OsAUX1
OsAUX1	OsRLR4	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	 Moreover, OsRLR4 interacts with the TRITHORAX-like protein OsTrx1 to promote H3K4me3 deposition at the OsAUX1 promoter, thus altering its transcription level
OsRLR4	OsTrx1|SDG723	OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.	 Moreover, OsRLR4 interacts with the TRITHORAX-like protein OsTrx1 to promote H3K4me3 deposition at the OsAUX1 promoter, thus altering its transcription level
