OsRLR4	 Here, the two loss-of-function T-DNA insertion mutants of root length regulator 4 (OsRLR4), osrlr4-1 and osrlr4-2 with longer PR, and three OsRLR4 overexpression lines, OE-OsRLR4-1/-2/-3 with shorter PR compared to the wild type, Hwayoung (WT/HY), were identified	 Here, the two loss-of-function T-DNA insertion mutants of root length regulator 4 (OsRLR4), osrlr4-1 and osrlr4-2 with longer PR, and three OsRLR4 overexpression lines, OE-OsRLR4-1/-2/-3 with shorter PR compared to the wild type, Hwayoung (WT/HY), were identified
