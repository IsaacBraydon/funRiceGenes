Root architecture is one of the most important agronomic traits that determines rice crop yield. The primary root (PR) absorbs mineral nutrients and provides mechanical support; however, the molecular mechanisms of PR elongation remain unclear in rice. Here, the two loss-of-function T-DNA insertion mutants of root length regulator 4 (OsRLR4), osrlr4-1 and osrlr4-2 with longer PR, and three OsRLR4 overexpression lines, OE-OsRLR4-1/-2/-3 with shorter PR compared to the wild type, Hwayoung (WT/HY), were identified. OsRLR4 is one of five members of the PRAF subfamily of the regulator chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1) family. Phylogenetic analysis of OsRLR4 from wild and cultivated rice indicated that it is under selective sweeps, suggesting its potential role in domestication. OsRLR4 controls PR development by regulating auxin accumulation in the PR tip and thus the root apical meristem activity. A series of biochemical and genetic analyses demonstrated that OsRLR4 functions directly upstream of the auxin transporter OsAUX1. Moreover, OsRLR4 interacts with the TRITHORAX-like protein OsTrx1 to promote H3K4me3 deposition at the OsAUX1 promoter, thus altering its transcription level. This work provides insight into the cooperation of auxin and epigenetic modifications in regulating root architecture and provides a genetic resource for plant architecture breeding.
