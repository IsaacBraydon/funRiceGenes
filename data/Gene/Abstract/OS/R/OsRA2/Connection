LAX1|BOS1	OsRA2	OsRAMOSA2 Shapes Panicle Architecture through Regulating Pedicel Length.	 Genetic analysis revealed that OsRA2 may control panicle architecture using the same pathway as that of the axillary meristem gene LAX1 (LAX PANICLE1)
OsRA2	RCN2	OsRAMOSA2 Shapes Panicle Architecture through Regulating Pedicel Length.	 Moreover, OsRA2 acted downstream of RCN2 in regulating pedicel and branch lengths, but upstream of RCN2 for control of the number of secondary branches, indicating that branch number and length development in the panicle were respectively regulated using parallel pathway
