measured 4 d after the treatment (Zhang and Wen, 2010). Rice          structures of AtRTH, OsRTH1 (Os01g0711600), and seedlings were grown in an environmentally controlled phytotron       OsRTH3 (Os03G0799500) are similar to that of RTE1. OsRTH2 (Os05g0539800) are structurally distinct from             (Fig. 2F).
