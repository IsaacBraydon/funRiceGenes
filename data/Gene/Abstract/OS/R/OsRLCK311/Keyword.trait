OsRLCK311	seedlings	A Cytoplasmic Receptor-like Kinase Contributes to Salinity Tolerance.	 Overexpression of OsRLCK311 full-length protein (RLCK311FL) and the C-terminus of OsRLCK311 (ΔN) in Arabidopsis confirmed its role in salinity tolerance, both in seedlings and mature plants
OsRLCK311	growth	A Cytoplasmic Receptor-like Kinase Contributes to Salinity Tolerance.	 We suggest that the rice OsRLCK311 play a role in regulating the plant growth response under saline conditions via the regulation of the stomata response to stress
OsRLCK311	salinity	A Cytoplasmic Receptor-like Kinase Contributes to Salinity Tolerance.	 Overexpression of OsRLCK311 full-length protein (RLCK311FL) and the C-terminus of OsRLCK311 (ΔN) in Arabidopsis confirmed its role in salinity tolerance, both in seedlings and mature plants
OsRLCK311	stress	A Cytoplasmic Receptor-like Kinase Contributes to Salinity Tolerance.	 We suggest that the rice OsRLCK311 play a role in regulating the plant growth response under saline conditions via the regulation of the stomata response to stress
OsRLCK311	plant growth	A Cytoplasmic Receptor-like Kinase Contributes to Salinity Tolerance.	 We suggest that the rice OsRLCK311 play a role in regulating the plant growth response under saline conditions via the regulation of the stomata response to stress
OsRLCK311	plasma membrane	A Cytoplasmic Receptor-like Kinase Contributes to Salinity Tolerance.	 Protein interaction assays indicated that OsRLCK311 and ΔN interacted in-vivo with the plasma membrane AQP AtPIP2;1
OsRLCK311	stomata	A Cytoplasmic Receptor-like Kinase Contributes to Salinity Tolerance.	 We suggest that the rice OsRLCK311 play a role in regulating the plant growth response under saline conditions via the regulation of the stomata response to stress
