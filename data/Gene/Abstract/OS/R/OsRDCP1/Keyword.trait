OsRDCP1|OsREIW1	drought	Overexpression of OsRDCP1, a rice RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, increased tolerance to drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Among these paralogs, OsRDCP1 was induced by drought stress, whereas the other OsRDCP members were constitutively expressed, with OsRDCP4 transcripts expressed at the highest level in rice seedlings
OsRDCP1|OsREIW1	drought	Overexpression of OsRDCP1, a rice RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, increased tolerance to drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Phenotypic analysis showed that wild-type plants and the homozygous osrdcp1 G2 mutant line displayed similar phenotypes under normal growth conditions and in response to drought stress
OsRDCP1|OsREIW1	drought	Overexpression of OsRDCP1, a rice RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, increased tolerance to drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Overexpression of OsRDCP1, a rice RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, increased tolerance to drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
OsRDCP1|OsREIW1	growth	Overexpression of OsRDCP1, a rice RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, increased tolerance to drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Phenotypic analysis showed that wild-type plants and the homozygous osrdcp1 G2 mutant line displayed similar phenotypes under normal growth conditions and in response to drought stress
OsRDCP1|OsREIW1	seedling	Overexpression of OsRDCP1, a rice RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, increased tolerance to drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Among these paralogs, OsRDCP1 was induced by drought stress, whereas the other OsRDCP members were constitutively expressed, with OsRDCP4 transcripts expressed at the highest level in rice seedlings
