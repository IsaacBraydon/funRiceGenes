CaRma1H1 was previously identified as a hot pepper drought-induced RING E3 Ub ligase. We have identified five putative proteins that display a significant sequence identity with CaRma1H1 in the rice genome database (http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/RiceGE). These five rice paralogs possess a single RING motif in their N-terminal regions, consistent with the notion that RING proteins are encoded by a multi-gene family. Therefore, these proteins were named OsRDCPs (Oryza sativa RING domain-containing proteins). Among these paralogs, OsRDCP1 was induced by drought stress, whereas the other OsRDCP members were constitutively expressed, with OsRDCP4 transcripts expressed at the highest level in rice seedlings. osrdcp1 loss-of-function knockout mutant and OsRDCP1-overexpressing transgenic rice plants were developed. Phenotypic analysis showed that wild-type plants and the homozygous osrdcp1 G2 mutant line displayed similar phenotypes under normal growth conditions and in response to drought stress. This may be due to complementation by other OsRDCP paralogs. In contrast, 35S:OsRDCP1 T2 transgenic rice plants exhibited improved tolerance to severe water deficits. Although the physiological function of OsRDCP1 remains unclear, there are several possible mechanisms for its involvement in a subset of physiological responses to counteract dehydration stress in rice plants.
NA	Phosphorylation and ubiquitination of OsWRKY31 are integral to OsMKK10-2-mediated defense responses in rice.	2023	Plant Cell	Key Laboratory of Pest Monitoring and Green Management, MOA; Joint Laboratory for International Cooperation in Crop Molecular Breeding; Department of Plant Pathology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK) cascades play vital roles in plant innate immunity, growth, and development. Here, we report that the rice (Oryza sativa) transcription factor gene OsWRKY31 is a key component in an MPK signaling pathway involved in plant disease resistance in rice. We found that the activation of OsMKK10-2 enhances resistance against the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae and suppresses growth through an increase in jasmonic acid and salicylic acid accumulation, and a decrease of indole-3-acetic acid levels. Knockout of OsWRKY31 compromises the defense responses mediated by OsMKK10-2. OsMKK10-2 and OsWRKY31 physically interact, and OsWRKY31 is phosphorylated by OsMPK3, OsMPK4, and OsMPK6. Phosphomimetic OsWRKY31 has elevated DNA-binding activity and confers enhanced resistance to M. oryzae. In addition, OsWRKY31 stability is regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitination via RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligases interacting with WRKY 1 (OsREIW1). Taken together, our findings indicate that modification of OsWRKY31 by phosphorylation and ubiquitination functions in the OsMKK10-2-mediated defense signaling pathway.
