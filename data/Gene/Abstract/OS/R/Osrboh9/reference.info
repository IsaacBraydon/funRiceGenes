Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) has been reported to be important in normal plant growth and stress responses. In this study, it was verified that PI3K played a vital role in rice seed germination through regulating NADPH oxidase activity. Suppression of PI3K activity by inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 could abate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, which resulted in disturbance to the seed germination. And then, the signal cascades that PI3K promoted the ROS liberation was also evaluated. Diphenylene iodonium (DPI), an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, suppressed most of ROS generation in rice seed germination, which suggested that NADPH oxidase was the main source of ROS in this process. Pharmacological experiment and RT-PCR demonstrated that PI3K promoted the expression of Os rboh9. Moreover, functional analysis by native PAGE and the measurement of the 2, 3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazo-lium-5- carboxanilide (XTT) formazan concentration both showed that PI3K promoted the activity of NADPH oxidase. Furthermore, the western blot analysis of OsRac-1 demonstrated that the translocation of Rac-1 from cytoplasm to plasma membrane, which was known as a key factor in the assembly of NADPH oxidase, was suppressed by treatment with PI3K inhibitors, resulting in the decreased activity of NADPH oxidase. Taken together, these data favored the novel conclusion that PI3K regulated NADPH oxidase activity through modulating the recruitment of Rac-1 to plasma membrane and accelerated the process of rice seed germination.
NA	An NADPH Oxidase RBOH Functions in Rice Roots during Lysigenous Aerenchyma Formation under Oxygen-Deficient Conditions.	2017	Plant Cell	Nagoya University CITY: Nagoya Japan [JP].	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the NADPH oxidase RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG (RBOH) trigger signal transduction in diverse biological processes in plants. However, the functions of RBOH homologues in rice (Oryza sativa) and other gramineous plants are poorly understood. Ethylene induces the formation of lysigenous aerenchyma, which consists of internal gas spaces created by programmed cell death of cortical cells, in roots of gramineous plants under oxygen-deficient conditions. Here, we report that, in rice, one RBOH isoform (RBOHH) has a role in ethylene-induced aerenchyma formation in roots. Induction of RBOHH expression under oxygen-deficient conditions was greater in cortical cells than in cells of other root tissues. In addition, genes encoding group I calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK5 and CDPK13) were strongly expressed in root cortical cells. Co-expression of RBOHH with CDPK5 or CDPK13 induced ROS production in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Inhibitors of RBOH activity or cytosolic calcium influx suppressed ethylene-induced aerenchyma formation. Moreover, knockout of RBOHH by CRISPR/Cas9 reduced ROS accumulation and inducible aerenchyma formation in rice roots. These results suggest that RBOHH-mediated ROS production, which is stimulated by CDPK5 and/or CDPK13, is essential for ethylene-induced aerenchyma formation in rice roots under oxygen-deficient conditions.
