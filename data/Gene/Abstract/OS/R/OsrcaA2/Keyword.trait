OsrcaA1|OsrcaA2	 ga 	Involvement of a Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase component downstream to the gibberellin-binding phosphoprotein, RuBisCO activase, in rice	 Kinase activities of these proteins were significantly reduced in the presence of uniconazole, a potent GA biosynthesis inhibitor, but one of them was strongly promoted by GA(3) treatment in transgenic plants carrying a smaller subunit of RuBisCO activase (OsrcaA1) compared to the larger subunit OsrcaA2
