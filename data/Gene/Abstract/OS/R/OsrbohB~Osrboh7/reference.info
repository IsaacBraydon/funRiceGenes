J Biochem-2012-Takahashi-37-43.pdf	Reactive oxygen species production and activation mechanism of the rice NADPH oxidase OsRbohB	2012	J Biochem	Department of Applied Biological Science, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, 278-8510 Chiba, Japan.	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by plant NADPH oxidases (NOXes) are important in plant innate immunity. The Oryza sativa respiratory burst oxidase homologue B (OsRbohB) gene encodes a NOX the regulatory mechanisms of which are largely unknown. Here, we used a heterologous expression system to demonstrate that OsRbohB shows ROS-producing activity. Treatment with ionomycin, a Ca(2+) ionophore, and calyculin A, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, activated ROS-producing activity; it was thus OsRbohB activated by both Ca(2+) and protein phosphorylation. Mutation analyses revealed that not only the first EF-hand motif but also the upstream amino-terminal region were necessary for Ca(2+)-dependent activation, while these regions are not required for phosphorylation-induced ROS production.
pone.0033817.pdf	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity	2012	PLoS One	MOE Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science and Institute of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China.	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) has been reported to be important in normal plant growth and stress responses. In this study, it was verified that PI3K played a vital role in rice seed germination through regulating NADPH oxidase activity. Suppression of PI3K activity by inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 could abate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, which resulted in disturbance to the seed germination. And then, the signal cascades that PI3K promoted the ROS liberation was also evaluated. Diphenylene iodonium (DPI), an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, suppressed most of ROS generation in rice seed germination, which suggested that NADPH oxidase was the main source of ROS in this process. Pharmacological experiment and RT-PCR demonstrated that PI3K promoted the expression of Os rboh9. Moreover, functional analysis by native PAGE and the measurement of the 2, 3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazo-lium-5- carboxanilide (XTT) formazan concentration both showed that PI3K promoted the activity of NADPH oxidase. Furthermore, the western blot analysis of OsRac-1 demonstrated that the translocation of Rac-1 from cytoplasm to plasma membrane, which was known as a key factor in the assembly of NADPH oxidase, was suppressed by treatment with PI3K inhibitors, resulting in the decreased activity of NADPH oxidase. Taken together, these data favored the novel conclusion that PI3K regulated NADPH oxidase activity through modulating the recruitment of Rac-1 to plasma membrane and accelerated the process of rice seed germination.
NA	OsRbohB-mediated ROS production plays a crucial role in drought stress tolerance of rice	2020	Plant Cell Rep	State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology in Arid Area/College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, 712100, Shanxi, China.	We found that a rice NADPH oxidase gene OsRbohB contributes drought tolerance and its functions are involved in the interaction of the OsRbohB-mediated ROS production and ABA signaling. The plasma membrane NADPH oxidases, also known as respiratory burst oxidase homologs, are the key producers of ROS under both normal and stress conditions in plants. However, their functions in rice development and stress tolerance are still under investigation. Here, we found that a rice NADPH oxidase gene OsRbohB, also named OsNOX1, is expressed in all tissues examined throughout the development stages with higher transcripts in leaves. The transcriptional expression of OsRbohB is also strongly stimulated by dehydration, salt and several phytohormonal treatments. Compared with wide-type and the OsRbohB-overexpressing transgenic plants, osrbohB, a Tos17 insertion knockout mutant of OsRbohB, shows lower ROS production, abscisic acid (ABA) content and transcripts of a series of stress-related genes. The osrbohB mutant also exhibits lower seed germination rate, organ size and thousand seed weight, but higher stomatal aperture and sensitivity to drought. Moreover, a number of genes involved in plant development, stress response, transcriptional regulation, and particularly ABA signaling are differentially expressed in osrbohB plants under both normal growth and drought conditions. All these results suggest the roles of OsRbohB in drought tolerance of rice, which probably performed through the interaction of the OsRbohB-mediated ROS production and ABA signaling.
