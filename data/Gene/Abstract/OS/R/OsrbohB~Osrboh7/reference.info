J Biochem-2012-Takahashi-37-43.pdf	Reactive oxygen species production and activation mechanism of the rice NADPH oxidase OsRbohB	2012	J Biochem	Department of Applied Biological Science, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, 278-8510 Chiba, Japan.	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by plant NADPH oxidases (NOXes) are important in plant innate immunity. The Oryza sativa respiratory burst oxidase homologue B (OsRbohB) gene encodes a NOX the regulatory mechanisms of which are largely unknown. Here, we used a heterologous expression system to demonstrate that OsRbohB shows ROS-producing activity. Treatment with ionomycin, a Ca(2+) ionophore, and calyculin A, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, activated ROS-producing activity; it was thus OsRbohB activated by both Ca(2+) and protein phosphorylation. Mutation analyses revealed that not only the first EF-hand motif but also the upstream amino-terminal region were necessary for Ca(2+)-dependent activation, while these regions are not required for phosphorylation-induced ROS production.
pone.0033817.pdf	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity	2012	PLoS One	MOE Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science and Institute of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China.	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) has been reported to be important in normal plant growth and stress responses. In this study, it was verified that PI3K played a vital role in rice seed germination through regulating NADPH oxidase activity. Suppression of PI3K activity by inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 could abate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, which resulted in disturbance to the seed germination. And then, the signal cascades that PI3K promoted the ROS liberation was also evaluated. Diphenylene iodonium (DPI), an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, suppressed most of ROS generation in rice seed germination, which suggested that NADPH oxidase was the main source of ROS in this process. Pharmacological experiment and RT-PCR demonstrated that PI3K promoted the expression of Os rboh9. Moreover, functional analysis by native PAGE and the measurement of the 2, 3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazo-lium-5- carboxanilide (XTT) formazan concentration both showed that PI3K promoted the activity of NADPH oxidase. Furthermore, the western blot analysis of OsRac-1 demonstrated that the translocation of Rac-1 from cytoplasm to plasma membrane, which was known as a key factor in the assembly of NADPH oxidase, was suppressed by treatment with PI3K inhibitors, resulting in the decreased activity of NADPH oxidase. Taken together, these data favored the novel conclusion that PI3K regulated NADPH oxidase activity through modulating the recruitment of Rac-1 to plasma membrane and accelerated the process of rice seed germination.
NA	OsRbohB-mediated ROS production plays a crucial role in drought stress tolerance of rice	2020	Plant Cell Rep	State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology in Arid Area/College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, 712100, Shanxi, China.	We found that a rice NADPH oxidase gene OsRbohB contributes drought tolerance and its functions are involved in the interaction of the OsRbohB-mediated ROS production and ABA signaling. The plasma membrane NADPH oxidases, also known as respiratory burst oxidase homologs, are the key producers of ROS under both normal and stress conditions in plants. However, their functions in rice development and stress tolerance are still under investigation. Here, we found that a rice NADPH oxidase gene OsRbohB, also named OsNOX1, is expressed in all tissues examined throughout the development stages with higher transcripts in leaves. The transcriptional expression of OsRbohB is also strongly stimulated by dehydration, salt and several phytohormonal treatments. Compared with wide-type and the OsRbohB-overexpressing transgenic plants, osrbohB, a Tos17 insertion knockout mutant of OsRbohB, shows lower ROS production, abscisic acid (ABA) content and transcripts of a series of stress-related genes. The osrbohB mutant also exhibits lower seed germination rate, organ size and thousand seed weight, but higher stomatal aperture and sensitivity to drought. Moreover, a number of genes involved in plant development, stress response, transcriptional regulation, and particularly ABA signaling are differentially expressed in osrbohB plants under both normal growth and drought conditions. All these results suggest the roles of OsRbohB in drought tolerance of rice, which probably performed through the interaction of the OsRbohB-mediated ROS production and ABA signaling.
NA	Overproduction of OsRACK1A, an effector-targeted scaffold protein promoting OsRBOHB-mediated ROS production, confers rice floral resistance to false smut disease without yield penalty.	2022	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China; Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.	Grain formation is fundamental for crop yield but is vulnerable to abiotic and biotic stresses. Rice grain production is threatened by the false smut fungus Ustilaginoidea virens, which specifically infects rice floral organs, disrupting fertilization and seed formation. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of the U. virens-rice interaction and the genetic basis of floral resistance. Here, we report that U. virens secretes a cytoplasmic effector, UvCBP1, to facilitate infection of rice flowers. Mechanistically, UvCBP1 interacts with the rice scaffold protein OsRACK1A and competes its interaction with the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase OsRBOHB, leading to inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Although the analysis of natural variation revealed no OsRACK1A variants that could avoid being targeted by UvCBP1, expression levels of OsRACK1A are correlated with field resistance against U. virens in rice germplasm. Overproduction of OsRACK1A restores the OsRACK1A-OsRBOHB association and promotes OsRBOHB phosphorylation to enhance ROS production, conferring rice floral resistance to U. virens without yield penalty. Taken together, our findings reveal a new pathogenic mechanism mediated by an essential effector from a flower-specific pathogen and provide a valuable genetic resource for balancing disease resistance and crop yield.
NA	Rice iron storage protein ferritin 2 (OsFER2) positively regulates ferroptotic cell death and defense responses against Magnaporthe oryzae.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Division of Integrative Bioscience and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea.	Ferritin is a ubiquitous iron storage protein that regulates iron homeostasis and oxidative stress in plants. Iron plays an important role in ferroptotic cell death response of rice (Oryza sativa) to Magnaporthe oryzae infection. Here, we and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent ferroptotic cell death and defense response against the avirulent M. oryzae INA168. The full-length ferritin OsFER2 and its transit peptide were localized to the chloroplast, the most Fe-rich organelle for photosynthesis. This suggests that the transit peptide acts as a signal peptide for the rice ferritin OsFER2 to move into chloroplasts. OsFER2 expression is involved in rice resistance to M. oryzae infection. OsFER2 knock-out in wild-type rice HY did not induce ROS and ferric ion (Fe(3+)) accumulation, lipid peroxidation and hypersensitive response (HR) cell death, and also downregulated the defense-related genes OsPAL1, OsPR1-b, OsRbohB, OsNADP-ME2-3, OsMEK2 and OsMPK1, and vacuolar membrane transporter OsVIT2 expression. OsFER2 complementation in ΔOsfer2 knock-out mutants restored ROS and iron accumulation and HR cell death phenotypes during infection. The iron chelator deferoxamine, the lipid-ROS scavenger ferrostatin-1, the actin microfilament polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin E and the redox inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium suppressed ROS and iron accumulation and HR cell death in rice leaf sheaths. However, the small-molecule inducer erastin did not trigger iron-dependent ROS accumulation and HR cell death induction in ΔOsfer2 mutants. These combined results suggest and ROS-dependent ferroptotic cell death and defense response in rice-M. oryzae interactions.
