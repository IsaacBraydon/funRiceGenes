OsrbohB|Osrboh7	SDS2	The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.	 In addition, SDS2 interacts with related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases, OsRLCK118/176, that positively regulate immunity by phosphorylating the NADPH oxidase OsRbohB to stimulate ROS production
OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsrbohB|Osrboh7	Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase OsMEK2 and OsMPK1 Signaling Is Required for Ferroptotic Cell Death in Rice- Magnaporthe oryzae Interactions	 oryzae infection in ¦¤Osmek2 knock-out plants did not trigger iron and ROS accumulation and lipid peroxidation, and also downregulated OsMPK1, OsWRKY90, OsRbohB, and OsPR-1b expression
OsNIN-like2|OsNLP2	OsrbohB|Osrboh7	The NIN-Like Protein OsNLP2 Negatively Regulates Ferroptotic Cell Death and Immune Responses to Magnaporthe oryzae in Rice.	 The loss-of-function of OsNLP2 triggered the expression of defense-related genes including OsPBZ1, OsPIP-3A, OsWRKY104, and OsRbohB in Î”Osnlp2 mutants
