OsrbohB|Osrboh7	SDS2	The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.	 In addition, SDS2 interacts with related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases, OsRLCK118/176, that positively regulate immunity by phosphorylating the NADPH oxidase OsRbohB to stimulate ROS production
OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	OsrbohB|Osrboh7	Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase OsMEK2 and OsMPK1 Signaling Is Required for Ferroptotic Cell Death in Rice- Magnaporthe oryzae Interactions	 oryzae infection in ¦¤Osmek2 knock-out plants did not trigger iron and ROS accumulation and lipid peroxidation, and also downregulated OsMPK1, OsWRKY90, OsRbohB, and OsPR-1b expression
OsNIN-like2|OsNLP2	OsrbohB|Osrboh7	The NIN-Like Protein OsNLP2 Negatively Regulates Ferroptotic Cell Death and Immune Responses to Magnaporthe oryzae in Rice.	 The loss-of-function of OsNLP2 triggered the expression of defense-related genes including OsPBZ1, OsPIP-3A, OsWRKY104, and OsRbohB in Î”Osnlp2 mutants
OsPBZ1	OsrbohB|Osrboh7	The NIN-Like Protein OsNLP2 Negatively Regulates Ferroptotic Cell Death and Immune Responses to Magnaporthe oryzae in Rice.	 The loss-of-function of OsNLP2 triggered the expression of defense-related genes including OsPBZ1, OsPIP-3A, OsWRKY104, and OsRbohB in Î”Osnlp2 mutants
OsRACK1A	OsrbohB|Osrboh7	Overproduction of OsRACK1A, an effector-targeted scaffold protein promoting OsRBOHB-mediated ROS production, confers rice floral resistance to false smut disease without yield penalty.	 Mechanistically, UvCBP1 interacts with the rice scaffold protein OsRACK1A and competes its interaction with the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase OsRBOHB, leading to inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
OsRACK1A	OsrbohB|Osrboh7	Overproduction of OsRACK1A, an effector-targeted scaffold protein promoting OsRBOHB-mediated ROS production, confers rice floral resistance to false smut disease without yield penalty.	 Overproduction of OsRACK1A restores the OsRACK1A-OsRBOHB association and promotes OsRBOHB phosphorylation to enhance ROS production, conferring rice floral resistance to U
OsFER2	OsrbohB|Osrboh7	Rice iron storage protein ferritin 2 (OsFER2) positively regulates ferroptotic cell death and defense responses against Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsFER2 knock-out in wild-type rice HY did not induce ROS and ferric ion (Fe(3+)) accumulation, lipid peroxidation and hypersensitive response (HR) cell death, and also downregulated the defense-related genes OsPAL1, OsPR1-b, OsRbohB, OsNADP-ME2-3, OsMEK2 and OsMPK1, and vacuolar membrane transporter OsVIT2 expression
