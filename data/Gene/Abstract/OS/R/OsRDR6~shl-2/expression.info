OsRDR6|shl-2	 We found previously that rice RDR6 (OsRDR6) functioned in the defense against Rice stripe virus (RSV), and Rice Dwarf Phytoreovirus (RDV) infection resulted in down-regulation of expression of RDR6 |  Our result showed that down-regulation of OsRDR6 through the antisense (OsRDR6AS) strategy increased rice susceptibility to RDV infection while over-expression of OsRDR6 had no effect on RDV infection
OsRDR6|shl-2	 Therefore, we speculate that the alteration in expression of small RNAs in Osrdr6 mutants leads to the defects in DSB formation during meiosis, which might not be directly dependent on RNA-directed DNA methylation
