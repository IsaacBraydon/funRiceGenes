OsRDR6|shl-2	spikelet	Rice RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 acts in small RNA biogenesis and spikelet development	 We isolated a rice osrdr6-1 mutant, which was temperature sensitive and showed spikelet defects
OsRDR6|shl-2	disease	RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 of rice (Oryza sativa) plays role in host defense against negative-strand RNA virus, Rice stripe virus	 In three independent transgenic lines (OsRDR6AS line A, B and C) in which OsRDR6 transcription levels were reduced by 70-80% through antisense silencing, the infection and disease symptoms of RSV were shown to be significantly enhanced
OsRDR6|shl-2	insect	RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 of rice (Oryza sativa) plays role in host defense against negative-strand RNA virus, Rice stripe virus	 The hypersusceptibilities of the OsRDR6AS plants were attributed not to enhanced insect infestation but to enhanced virus infection
OsRDR6|shl-2	temperature	Rice RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 acts in small RNA biogenesis and spikelet development	" We isolated a rice osrdr6-1 mutant, which was temperature sensitive and showed spikelet defects"
OsRDR6|shl-2	 ABA 	Phytohormone abscisic acid control RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 gene expression and post-transcriptional gene silencing in rice cells	 We propose that ABA modulates PTGS through the transcriptional control of the OsRDR6 gene
OsRDR6|shl-2	defense	OsRDR6 plays role in host defense against double-stranded RNA virus, Rice Dwarf Phytoreovirus.	OsRDR6 plays role in host defense against double-stranded RNA virus, Rice Dwarf Phytoreovirus.
OsRDR6|shl-2	dwarf	OsRDR6 plays role in host defense against double-stranded RNA virus, Rice Dwarf Phytoreovirus.	OsRDR6 plays role in host defense against double-stranded RNA virus, Rice Dwarf Phytoreovirus.
