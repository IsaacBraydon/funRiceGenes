OsCERK1	OsRacGEF2	New insights into the dimerization of small GTPase Rac/ROP guanine nucleotide exchange factors in rice.	 OsRacGEF2 does not bind directly to the receptor-like kinase (RLK) OsCERK1, but forms a complex with OsCERK1 through OsRacGEF1 at the ER
OsRacGEF1	OsRacGEF2	New insights into the dimerization of small GTPase Rac/ROP guanine nucleotide exchange factors in rice.	 Here, we show that rice OsRacGEF1 forms homodimers, and heterodimers with OsRacGEF2, at the plasma membrane (PM) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
