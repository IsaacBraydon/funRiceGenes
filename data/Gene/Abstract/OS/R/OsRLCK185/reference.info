Kawano-2013-Early signaling netw.pdf	Early signaling network in rice PRR-mediated and R-mediated immunity	2013	Curr Opin Plant Biol	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma, Nara 630-0101, Japan.	Recent studies on plant immunity and pathogen infection have revealed sophisticated forms of plant-pathogen interaction. Considerable progress has been made recently in our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying chitin signaling in rice. The identification and characterization of two direct substrates, OsRacGEF1 and OsRLCK185, as components in the chitin receptor complex of OsCERK1 have revealed how pattern recognition receptors transduce pathogen signals to downstream molecules in rice. In this review, we highlight these and other recent studies that have contributed to our current understanding of the signaling network in rice immunity, especially with regard to pattern recognition receptors, disease resistance (R) proteins, and their downstream targets.
Yamaguchi-2013-A receptor-like cyto.pdf	A receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase targeted by a plant pathogen effector is directly phosphorylated by the chitin receptor and mediates rice immunity	2013	Cell Host Microbe	Department of Advanced Bioscience, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kinki University, 3327-204 Nakamachi, Nara 631-8505, Japan.	CERK1 is a lysine motif-containing plant pattern recognition receptor for chitin and peptidoglycan. Chitin recognition by OsCERK1 triggers rapid engagement of a rice MAP kinase cascade, which leads to defense response activation. How the MAP kinase cascades are engaged downstream of OsCERK1 remains obscure. Searching for host proteins that interact with Xoo1488, an effector of the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae, we identified the rice receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, OsRLCK185. Silencing OsRLCK185 suppressed peptidoglycan- and chitin-induced immune responses, including MAP kinase activation and defense-gene expression. In response to chitin, OsRLCK185 associates with, and is directly phosphorylated by, OsCERK1 at the plasma membrane. Xoo1488 inhibits peptidoglycan- and chitin-induced immunity and pathogen resistance. Additionally, OsCERK1-mediated phosphorylation of OsRLCK185 is suppressed by Xoo1488, resulting in the inhibition of chitin-induced MAP kinase activation. These data support a role for OsRLCK185 as an essential immediate downstream signaling partner of OsCERK1 in mediating chitin- and peptidoglycan-induced plant immunity.
NA	OsCERK1-mediated chitin perception and immune signaling requires Receptor-like Cytoplasmic Kinase 185 to activate a MAPK cascade in rice.	2017	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China.	Conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as chitin, are perceived by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) located at the host cell surface and trigger rapid activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, which is required for plant resistance to pathogens. However, the direct link from PAMP perception to MAPK activation in plants is elusive. Here, we found that the PRR-associated receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase Oryza sativa RLCK185 transmits immune signaling from the PAMP receptor OsCERK1 to a MAPK signaling cascade through interaction with a MAPK kinase kinase, OsMAPKKK¦Å, which is the initial kinase of the MAPK cascade. OsRLCK185 interacts with and phosphorylates the C-terminal regulatory domain of OsMAPKKK¦Å. Coexpression of phosphomimetic OsRLCK185 and OsMAPKKK¦Å activates MAPK3/6 phosphorylation in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. OsMAPKKK¦Å interacts with and phosphorylates OsMKK4, a key MAPK kinase that transduces the chitin signal. OsMAPKKK¦Å overexpression increases chitin-induced MAPK3/6 activation. OsMAPKKK¦Å knockdown compromises chitin-induced MAPK3/6 activation and resistance to rice blast fungus. These findings suggest a phospho-signaling pathway from cell surface chitin perception to intracellular activation of a MAPK cascade in rice.
