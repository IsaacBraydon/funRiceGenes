OsRacGEF1	OsRLCK185	Crosstalk of Signaling Mechanisms Involved in Host Defense and Symbiosis Against Microorganisms in Rice.	In chitin signaling in rice, two direct substrates of OsCERK1, Rac/ROP GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor OsRacGEF1 and receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK185, have been identified as components of the OsCERK1 complex and are rapidly phosphorylated by OsCERK1 in response to chitin
OsCERK1	OsRLCK185	OsCERK1-mediated chitin perception and immune signaling requires Receptor-like Cytoplasmic Kinase 185 to activate a MAPK cascade in rice	OsCERK1-mediated chitin perception and immune signaling requires Receptor-like Cytoplasmic Kinase 185 to activate a MAPK cascade in rice
OsDRE2	OsRLCK185	OsDRE2 contributes to chitin-triggered response through its interaction with OsRLCK185.	OsDRE2 contributes to chitin-triggered response through its interaction with OsRLCK185.
OsCNGC9	OsRLCK185	A cyclic nucleotide-gated channel mediates cytoplasmic calcium elevation and disease resistance in rice.	 We further show that a PTI-related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK185 physically interacts with and phosphorylates OsCNGC9 to activate its channel activity
