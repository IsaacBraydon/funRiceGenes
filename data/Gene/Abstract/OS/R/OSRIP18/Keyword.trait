OSRIP18	salt tolerance	Over-expression of OSRIP18 increases drought and salt tolerance in transgenic rice plants	Over-expression of OSRIP18 increases drought and salt tolerance in transgenic rice plants
OSRIP18	abiotic stress	Over-expression of OSRIP18 increases drought and salt tolerance in transgenic rice plants	 Our data suggested that the increased tolerance to these abiotic stresses in transgenic plants might be due to up-regulation of some stress-dependent/independent genes and OSRIP18 may be potentially useful in further improving plant tolerance to various abiotic stresses by over-expression
OSRIP18	drought	Over-expression of OSRIP18 increases drought and salt tolerance in transgenic rice plants	Over-expression of OSRIP18 increases drought and salt tolerance in transgenic rice plants
OSRIP18	salt	Over-expression of OSRIP18 increases drought and salt tolerance in transgenic rice plants	Over-expression of OSRIP18 increases drought and salt tolerance in transgenic rice plants
