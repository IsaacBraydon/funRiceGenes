OsCERK1	OsRLCK176|BML	OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity	Furthermore, the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176 functions downstream of OsCERK1 in the PGN and chitin signaling pathways, suggesting that these MAMPs share overlapping intracellular signaling components.
OsRLCK107	OsRLCK176|BML	Four receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases regulate development and immunity in rice.	Here, we report the functional characterization of four rice RLCKs-OsRLCK57, OsRLCK107, OsRLCK118, and OsRLCK176 from subfamily VII
OsRLCK118	OsRLCK176|BML	Four receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases regulate development and immunity in rice.	Here, we report the functional characterization of four rice RLCKs-OsRLCK57, OsRLCK107, OsRLCK118, and OsRLCK176 from subfamily VII
OsRLCK176|BML	OsRLCK57	OsRLCK 57, OsRLCK107 and OsRLCK118 Positively Regulate Chitin- and PGN-Induced Immunity in Rice.	OsRLCK57, OsRLCK107 and OsRLCK118, positively regulate chitin- and PGN- induced responses in rice, similar to that observed in OsRLCK176
OsCPK4	OsRLCK176|BML	The kinase OsCPK4 regulates a buffering mechanism that fine-tunes innate immunity.	 OsCPK4 was further identified to interact with a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176
OsCPK4	OsRLCK176|BML	The kinase OsCPK4 regulates a buffering mechanism that fine-tunes innate immunity.	 OsRLCK176 accumulation is negatively regulated by OsCPK4
OsCPK4	OsRLCK176|BML	The kinase OsCPK4 regulates a buffering mechanism that fine-tunes innate immunity.	 Interestingly, the kinase-dead OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation more strongly than the wild-type protein
OsCPK4	OsRLCK176|BML	The kinase OsCPK4 regulates a buffering mechanism that fine-tunes innate immunity.	 OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 mutually phosphorylate each other and form a feedback loop
OsCPK4	OsRLCK176|BML	The kinase OsCPK4 regulates a buffering mechanism that fine-tunes innate immunity.	 Moreover, the kinase activity and phosphorylation of OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 contribute to the stability of OsRLCK176
OsCPK4	OsRLCK176|BML	The kinase OsCPK4 regulates a buffering mechanism that fine-tunes innate immunity.	 These findings indicate that the kinase-inactive OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation and restricts plant defenses; whereas the activation of OsCPK4-OsRLCK176 phosphorylation circuit invalidates the OsRLCK176 degradation machinery and thus enhancing plant immunity
