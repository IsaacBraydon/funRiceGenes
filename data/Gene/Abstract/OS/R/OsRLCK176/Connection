NFR1|LYK3|OsCERK1	OsRLCK176	OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity	Furthermore, the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176 functions downstream of OsCERK1 in the PGN and chitin signaling pathways, suggesting that these MAMPs share overlapping intracellular signaling components.
