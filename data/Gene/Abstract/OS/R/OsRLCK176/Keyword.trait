OsRLCK176|BML	peptidoglycan and chitin signaling	OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity	Here, we demonstrate that the rice LysM receptor-like kinase OsCERK1, a key component of the chitin elicitor signaling pathway, also plays an important role in PGN-triggered immunity in rice.
