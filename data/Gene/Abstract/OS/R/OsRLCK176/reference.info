NA	OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity	2014	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol and Guangdong Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 510275, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.	Microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP)-triggered immunity plays critical roles in the basal resistance defense response in plants. Chitin and peptidoglycan (PGN) are major molecular patterns for fungi and bacteria, respectively. Two rice (Oryza sativa) lysin motif-containing proteins, OsLYP4 and OsLYP6, function as receptors that sense bacterial PGN and fungal chitin. These membrane receptors, which lack intracellular kinase domains, likely contain another component for transmembrane immune signal transduction. Here, we demonstrate that the rice LysM receptor-like kinase OsCERK1, a key component of the chitin elicitor signaling pathway, also plays an important role in PGN-triggered immunity in rice. Silencing of OsCERK1 suppressed PGN-induced (and chitin-induced) immunity responses, including reactive oxygen species generation, defense gene expression, and callose deposition, indicating that OsCERK1 is essential for both PGN and chitin signaling initiated by OsLYP4 and OsLYP6. OsLYP4 associated with OsLYP6 and the rice chitin receptor CEBiP in the absence of PGN or chitin, and treatment with PGN or chitin led to their disassociation in vivo. OsCERK1 associated with OsLYP4 or OsLYP6 when induced by PGN but it associated with OsLYP4, OsLYP6, or CEBiP under chitin treatment, suggesting the presence of different patterns of ligand-induced heterooligomeric receptor complexes. Furthermore, the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176 functions downstream of OsCERK1 in the PGN and chitin signaling pathways, suggesting that these MAMPs share overlapping intracellular signaling components. Therefore, OsCERK1 plays dual roles in PGN and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity and as an adaptor involved in signal transduction at the plasma membrane in conjunction with OsLYP4 and OsLYP6.
NA	Four receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases regulate development and immunity in rice.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Key Laboratory of Major Crop Diseases &amp; Collaborative Innovation Center for Hybrid Rice in Yangtze River Basin, Sichuan Agricultural University at Wenjiang, Chengdu, Sichuan, 611130, China.	Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) represent a large family of proteins in plants. However, few RLCKs have been well-characterized. Here, we report the functional characterization of four rice RLCKs-OsRLCK57, OsRLCK107, OsRLCK118, and OsRLCK176 from subfamily VII. These OsRLCKs interact with the rice brassinosteroid receptor, OsBRI1 in yeast cell, but not the XA21 immune receptor. Transgenic lines silenced for each of these genes have enlarged leaf angles and are hypersensitive to brassinolide treatment compared to wild type rice. Transgenic plants silenced for OsRLCK57 had significantly fewer tillers and reduced panicle secondary branching, and lines silenced for OsRLCK107 and OsRLCK118 produce fewer seeds. Silencing of these genes decreased Xa21 gene expression and compromised XA21-mediated immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Our study demonstrates that these OsRLCKs negatively regulate BR signaling, while positively regulate immune responses by contributing to the expression of the immune receptor XA21.

NA	The Brown Midrib Leaf (bml) Mutation in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Causes Premature Leaf Senescence and the Induction of Defense Responses.	2018	Genes (Basel)	Department of Agronomy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China. 11516090@zju.edu.cn.	Isolating and characterizing mutants with altered senescence phenotypes is one of the ways to understand the molecular basis of leaf aging. Using ethyl methane sulfonate mutagenesis, a new rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, brown midrib leaf (bml), was isolated from the indica cultivar 'Zhenong34'. The bml mutants had brown midribs in their leaves and initiated senescence prematurely, at the onset of heading. The mutants had abnormal cells with degraded chloroplasts and contained less chlorophyll compared to the wild type (WT). The bml mutant showed excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and malondialdehyde, upregulation of senescence-induced STAY-GREEN genes and senescence-related transcription factors, and down regulation of photosynthesis-related genes. The levels of abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) were increased in bml with the upregulation of some ABA and JA biosynthetic genes. In pathogen response, bml demonstrated higher resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and upregulation of four pathogenesis-related genes compared to the WT. A genetic study confirmed that the bml trait was caused by a single recessive nuclear gene (BML). A map-based cloning using insertion/deletion markers confirmed that BML was located in the 57.32kb interval between the L5IS7 and L5IS11 markers on the short arm of chromosome 5. A sequence analysis of the candidate region identified a 1 bp substitution (G to A) in the 5'-UTR (+98) of bml. BML is a candidate gene associated with leaf senescence, ROS regulation, and disease response, also involved in hormone signaling in rice. Therefore, this gene might be useful in marker-assisted backcrossing/gene editing to improve rice cultivars.
