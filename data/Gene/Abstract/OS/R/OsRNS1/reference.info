INTRODUCTION: Root development is a fundamental process that supports plant survival and crop productivity. One of the essential factors to consider when developing biotechnology crops is the selection of a promoter that can optimize the spatial-temporal expression of introduced genes. However, there are insufficient cases of suitable promoters in crop plants, including rice. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to verify the usefulness of a new rice root-preferred promoter to optimize the function of a target gene with root-preferred expression in rice. METHODS: osrns1 mutant had defects in root development based on T-DNA insertional mutant screening and CRISPR technology. To optimize the function of OsRNS1, we generated OsRNS1-overexpression plants under two different promoters: a whole-plant expression promoter and a novel root-preferred expression promoter. Root growth, yield-related agronomic traits, RNA-seq, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation were analyzed for comparison. RESULTS: OsRNS1 was found to be involved in root development through T-DNA insertional mutant analysis and gene editing mutant analysis. To understand the gain of function of OsRNS1, pUbi1::OsRNS1 was generated for the whole-plant expression, and both root growth defects and overall growth defects were found. To overcome this problem, a root-preferential overexpression line using Os1-CysPrxB promoter (Per) was generated and showed an increase in root length, plant height, and grain yield compared to wild-type (WT). RNA-seq analysis revealed that the response to oxidative stress-related genes was significantly up-regulated in both overexpression lines but was more obvious in pPer::OsRNS1. Furthermore, ROS levels in the roots were drastically decreased in pPer::OsRNS1 but were increased in the osrns1 mutants compared to WT. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that the use of a root-preferred promoter effectively optimizes the function of OsRNS1 and is a useful strategy for improving root-related agronomic traits as well as ROS regulation.
