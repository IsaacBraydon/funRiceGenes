OsRNS1	root	Tissue-specific enhancement of OsRNS1 with root-preferred expression is required for the increase of crop yield.	 METHODS: osrns1 mutant had defects in root development based on T-DNA insertional mutant screening and CRISPR technology
OsRNS1	root	Tissue-specific enhancement of OsRNS1 with root-preferred expression is required for the increase of crop yield.	 RESULTS: OsRNS1 was found to be involved in root development through T-DNA insertional mutant analysis and gene editing mutant analysis
