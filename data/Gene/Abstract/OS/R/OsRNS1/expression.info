OsRNS1	Tissue-specific enhancement of OsRNS1 with root-preferred expression is required for the increase of crop yield. |  To optimize the function of OsRNS1, we generated OsRNS1-overexpression plants under two different promoters: a whole-plant expression promoter and a novel root-preferred expression promoter |  To understand the gain of function of OsRNS1, pUbi1::OsRNS1 was generated for the whole-plant expression, and both root growth defects and overall growth defects were found |  RNA-seq analysis revealed that the response to oxidative stress-related genes was significantly up-regulated in both overexpression lines but was more obvious in pPer::OsRNS1	 To optimize the function of OsRNS1, we generated OsRNS1-overexpression plants under two different promoters: a whole-plant expression promoter and a novel root-preferred expression promoter |  RNA-seq analysis revealed that the response to oxidative stress-related genes was significantly up-regulated in both overexpression lines but was more obvious in pPer::OsRNS1
