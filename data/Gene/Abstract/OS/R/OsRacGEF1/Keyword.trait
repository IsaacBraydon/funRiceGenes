OsRacGEF1	resistance	An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.	 Activated OsRacGEF1 is required for chitin-driven immune responses and resistance to rice blast fungus infection
OsRacGEF1	blast	An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.	 Activated OsRacGEF1 is required for chitin-driven immune responses and resistance to rice blast fungus infection

OsRacGEF1	plasma membrane	New insights into the dimerization of small GTPase Rac/ROP guanine nucleotide exchange factors in rice.	 Here, we show that rice OsRacGEF1 forms homodimers, and heterodimers with OsRacGEF2, at the plasma membrane (PM) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
OsRacGEF1	Kinase	New insights into the dimerization of small GTPase Rac/ROP guanine nucleotide exchange factors in rice.	 OsRacGEF2 does not bind directly to the receptor-like kinase (RLK) OsCERK1, but forms a complex with OsCERK1 through OsRacGEF1 at the ER
