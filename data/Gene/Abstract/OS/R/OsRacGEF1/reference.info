NA	An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.	2013	Cell Host Microbe	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5Â Takayama, Ikoma, Nara 630-0192, Japan.	OsCEBiP, a chitin-binding protein, and OsCERK1, a receptor-like kinase, are plasma membrane (PM) proteins that form a receptor complex essential for fungal chitin-driven immune responses in rice. The signaling events immediately following chitin perception are unclear. Investigating the spatiotemporal regulation of the rice small GTPase OsRac1, we find that chitin induces rapid activation of OsRac1 at the PM. Searching for OsRac1 interactors, we identified OsRacGEF1 as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for OsRac1. OsRacGEF1 interacts with OsCERK1 and is activated when its C-terminal S549 is phosphorylated by the cytoplasmic domain of OsCERK1 in response to chitin. Activated OsRacGEF1 is required for chitin-driven immune responses and resistance to rice blast fungus infection. Further, a protein complex including OsCERK1 and OsRacGEF1 is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the PM. Collectively, our results suggest that OsCEBiP, OsCERK1, OsRacGEF1, and OsRac1 function as key components of a &quot;defensome&quot; critically engaged early during chitin-induced immunity.
NA	New insights into the dimerization of small GTPase Rac/ROP guanine nucleotide exchange factors in rice.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	a Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics; Graduate School of Biological Sciences; Nara Institute of Science and Technology ; Ikoma , Japan.	Molecular links between receptor-kinases and Rac/ROP family small GTPases mediated by activator guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) govern diverse biological processes. However, it is unclear how the Rac/ROP GTPases orchestrate such a wide variety of activities. Here, we show that rice OsRacGEF1 forms homodimers, and heterodimers with OsRacGEF2, at the plasma membrane (PM) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). OsRacGEF2 does not bind directly to the receptor-like kinase (RLK) OsCERK1, but forms a complex with OsCERK1 through OsRacGEF1 at the ER. This complex is transported from ER to the PM and there associates with OsRac1, resulting in the formation of a stable immune complex. Such RLK-GEF heterodimer complexes may explain the diversity of Rac/ROP family GTPase signalings.
NA	Crosstalk of Signaling Mechanisms Involved in Host Defense and Symbiosis Against Microorganisms in Rice.	2016	Curr Genomics	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara,Japan;; Present address: Cell and Developmental Biology, John Innes Centre, Norwich,United Kingdom;	Rice is one of the most important food crops, feeding about half population in the world. Rice pathogens cause enormous damage to rice production worldwide. In plant immunity research, considerable progress has recently been made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP)-triggered immunity. Using genome sequencing and molecular techniques, a number of new MAMPs and their receptors have been identified in the past two decades. Notably, the mechanisms for chitin perception via the lysine motif (LysM) domain-containing receptor OsCERK1, as well as the mechanisms for bacterial MAMP (e.g. flg22, elf18) perception via the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain-containing receptors FLS2 and EFR, have been clarified in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively. In chitin signaling in rice, two direct substrates of OsCERK1, Rac/ROP GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor OsRacGEF1 and receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK185, have been identified as components of the OsCERK1 complex and are rapidly phosphorylated by OsCERK1 in response to chitin. Interestingly, OsCERK1 also participates in symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in rice and plays a role in the recognition of short-chitin molecules (CO4/5), which are symbiotic signatures included in AMF germinated spore exudates and induced by synthetic strigolactone. Thus, OsCERK1 contributes to both immunity and symbiotic responses. In this review, we describe recent studies on pathways involved in rice immunity and symbiotic signaling triggered by interactions with microorganisms. In addition, we describe recent advances in genetic engineering by using plant immune receptors and symbiotic microorganisms to enhance disease resistance of rice.
