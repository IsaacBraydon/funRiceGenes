OsCEBiP, a chitin-binding protein, and OsCERK1, a receptor-like kinase, are plasma membrane (PM) proteins that form a receptor complex essential for fungal chitin-driven immune responses in rice. The signaling events immediately following chitin perception are unclear. Investigating the spatiotemporal regulation of the rice small GTPase OsRac1, we find that chitin induces rapid activation of OsRac1 at the PM. Searching for OsRac1 interactors, we identified OsRacGEF1 as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for OsRac1. OsRacGEF1 interacts with OsCERK1 and is activated when its C-terminal S549 is phosphorylated by the cytoplasmic domain of OsCERK1 in response to chitin. Activated OsRacGEF1 is required for chitin-driven immune responses and resistance to rice blast fungus infection. Further, a protein complex including OsCERK1 and OsRacGEF1 is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the PM. Collectively, our results suggest that OsCEBiP, OsCERK1, OsRacGEF1, and OsRac1 function as key components of a &quot;defensome&quot; critically engaged early during chitin-induced immunity.
