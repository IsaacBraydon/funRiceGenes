NA	An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.	2013	Cell Host Microbe	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5Â Takayama, Ikoma, Nara 630-0192, Japan.	OsCEBiP, a chitin-binding protein, and OsCERK1, a receptor-like kinase, are plasma membrane (PM) proteins that form a receptor complex essential for fungal chitin-driven immune responses in rice. The signaling events immediately following chitin perception are unclear. Investigating the spatiotemporal regulation of the rice small GTPase OsRac1, we find that chitin induces rapid activation of OsRac1 at the PM. Searching for OsRac1 interactors, we identified OsRacGEF1 as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for OsRac1. OsRacGEF1 interacts with OsCERK1 and is activated when its C-terminal S549 is phosphorylated by the cytoplasmic domain of OsCERK1 in response to chitin. Activated OsRacGEF1 is required for chitin-driven immune responses and resistance to rice blast fungus infection. Further, a protein complex including OsCERK1 and OsRacGEF1 is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the PM. Collectively, our results suggest that OsCEBiP, OsCERK1, OsRacGEF1, and OsRac1 function as key components of a &quot;defensome&quot; critically engaged early during chitin-induced immunity.
NA	New insights into the dimerization of small GTPase Rac/ROP guanine nucleotide exchange factors in rice.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	a Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics; Graduate School of Biological Sciences; Nara Institute of Science and Technology ; Ikoma , Japan.	Molecular links between receptor-kinases and Rac/ROP family small GTPases mediated by activator guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) govern diverse biological processes. However, it is unclear how the Rac/ROP GTPases orchestrate such a wide variety of activities. Here, we show that rice OsRacGEF1 forms homodimers, and heterodimers with OsRacGEF2, at the plasma membrane (PM) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). OsRacGEF2 does not bind directly to the receptor-like kinase (RLK) OsCERK1, but forms a complex with OsCERK1 through OsRacGEF1 at the ER. This complex is transported from ER to the PM and there associates with OsRac1, resulting in the formation of a stable immune complex. Such RLK-GEF heterodimer complexes may explain the diversity of Rac/ROP family GTPase signalings.
