CEBiP|OsCEBiP	OsRacGEF1	An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.	Collectively, our results suggest that OsCEBiP, OsCERK1, OsRacGEF1, and OsRac1 function as key components of a &quot;defensome&quot; critically engaged early during chitin-induced immunity
OsCERK1	OsRacGEF1	An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.	OsRacGEF1 interacts with OsCERK1 and is activated when its C-terminal S549 is phosphorylated by the cytoplasmic domain of OsCERK1 in response to chitin
OsCERK1	OsRacGEF1	An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.	Further, a protein complex including OsCERK1 and OsRacGEF1 is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the PM

OsCERK1	OsRacGEF1	New insights into the dimerization of small GTPase Rac/ROP guanine nucleotide exchange factors in rice.	OsRacGEF2 does not bind directly to the receptor-like kinase (RLK) OsCERK1, but forms a complex with OsCERK1 through OsRacGEF1 at the ER
OsRacGEF1	OsRacGEF2	New insights into the dimerization of small GTPase Rac/ROP guanine nucleotide exchange factors in rice.	Here, we show that rice OsRacGEF1 forms homodimers, and heterodimers with OsRacGEF2, at the plasma membrane (PM) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)

OsCERK1	OsRacGEF1	Crosstalk of Signaling Mechanisms Involved in Host Defense and Symbiosis Against Microorganisms in Rice.	In chitin signaling in rice, two direct substrates of OsCERK1, Rac/ROP GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor OsRacGEF1 and receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK185, have been identified as components of the OsCERK1 complex and are rapidly phosphorylated by OsCERK1 in response to chitin

OsCBM1	OsRacGEF1|OsRopGEF7B	Rice Carbohydrate-Binding Malectin-Like Protein, OsCBM1, Contributes to Drought-Stress Tolerance by Participating in NADPH Oxidase-Mediated ROS Production.	 Meanwhile, OsCBM1 can also physically interacts with OsRacGEF1, a specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rop/Rac GTPase OsRac1, and transient coexpression of OsCBM1 with OaRacGEF1 significantly enhanced ROS production
OsCBM1	OsRacGEF1|OsRopGEF7B	Rice Carbohydrate-Binding Malectin-Like Protein, OsCBM1, Contributes to Drought-Stress Tolerance by Participating in NADPH Oxidase-Mediated ROS Production.	 All these results suggest that OsCBM1 participates in NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production by interacting with OsRbohA and OsRacGEF1, contributing to drought stress tolerance of rice
