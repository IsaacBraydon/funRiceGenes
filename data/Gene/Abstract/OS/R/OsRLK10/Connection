OsCERK1	OsRLK10	OsCERK2/OsRLK10, a homolog of OsCERK1, has a potential role for chitin-triggered immunity and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	 Concerning the reason for this characteristic phenotype of oscerk1, we speculated that OsRLK10, which is a putative paralog of OsCERK1, may have a redundant function in AM symbiosis
