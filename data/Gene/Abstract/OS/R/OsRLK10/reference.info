NA	OsCERK2/OsRLK10, a homolog of OsCERK1, has a potential role for chitin-triggered immunity and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	2021	Plant Biotechnol (Tokyo)	Department of Life Sciences, School of Agriculture, Meiji University, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 214-8571, Japan.	In rice, the lysin motif (LysM) receptor-like kinase OsCERK1, originally identified as the essential molecule for chitin-triggered immunity, plays a key role in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis. As we previously reported, although AM colonization was largely repressed at 2 weeks after inoculation (WAI), arbuscules were observed at 5 WAI in oscerk1 mutant. Conversely, most mutant plants that defect the common symbiosis signaling pathway exhibited no arbuscule formation. Concerning the reason for this characteristic phenotype of oscerk1, we speculated that OsRLK10, which is a putative paralog of OsCERK1, may have a redundant function in AM symbiosis. The protein sequences of these two genes are highly conserved and it is estimated that the gene duplication occurred 150 million years ago. Here we demonstrated that OsCERK2/OsRLK10 induced AM colonization and chitin-triggered reactive oxygen species production in oscerk1 knockout mutant as similar to OsCERK1. The oscerk2 mutant showed a slight but significant reduction of AM colonization at 5 WAI, indicating the contribution of OsCERK2 for AM symbiosis. However, the oscerk2;oscerk1 double-knockout mutant produced arbuscules at 5 WAI as similar to the oscerk1 mutant, indicating that the redundancy of OsCERK1 and OsCERK2 did not explain the mycorrhizal colonization in oscerk1 at 5 WAI. These results indicated that OsCERK2 has a potential to regulate both chitin-triggered immunity and AM symbiosis and at least partially contributes to AM symbiosis in rice though the contribution of OsCERK2 appears to be weaker than that of OsCERK1.
