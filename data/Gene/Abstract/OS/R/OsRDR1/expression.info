OsRDR1	 Here, we show that a monocot-specific miRNA, miR444, is a key factor to relay the antiviral signaling from virus infection to OsRDR1 expression |  Expression of miR444 is enhanced by infection of Rice stripe virus (RSV) and overexpression of miR444 improves rice resistance against RSV infection accompanied by upregulation of OsRDR1 expression |  We further show that three miR444 targets, the MIKCC-type MADS-box proteins OsMADS23, OsMADS27a and OsMADS57, form homodimers and heterodimers between them to repress the expression of OsRDR1 by directly binding to the CArG motifs of its promoter |  We also show that overexpression of miR444-resistant OsMADS57 reduced OsRDR1 expression and rice resistance against RSV infection and knockout of OsRDR1 reduced rice resistance against RSV infection	 Expression of miR444 is enhanced by infection of Rice stripe virus (RSV) and overexpression of miR444 improves rice resistance against RSV infection accompanied by upregulation of OsRDR1 expression |  We also show that overexpression of miR444-resistant OsMADS57 reduced OsRDR1 expression and rice resistance against RSV infection and knockout of OsRDR1 reduced rice resistance against RSV infection
