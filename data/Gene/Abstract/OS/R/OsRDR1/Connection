OsRDR1	OsRecQ1	Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice	 However, these RNAs were completely abolished in OsRecQ1 (RecQ DNA helicase homologue) and OsRDR1 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase homologue) mutant lines where either gene was disrupted by the insertion of rice retrotransposon Tos17 after the same treatment
OsRDR1	OsRecQ1	Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice	 Together, these results strongly suggest that both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 play a pivotal role in the aRNA and qiRNA biogenesis required for the DDR and repair pathway in rice, and it may be a novel mechanism of regulation to the DDR through the production of qiRNA in plants

OsMADS57	OsRDR1	A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.	 We further show that three miR444 targets, the MIKCC-type MADS-box proteins OsMADS23, OsMADS27a and OsMADS57, form homodimers and heterodimers between them to repress the expression of OsRDR1 by directly binding to the CArG motifs of its promoter
OsMADS57	OsRDR1	A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.	 Consequently, increased level of miR444 diminishes the repressive roles of OsMADS23, OsMADS27a and OsMADS57 on OsRDR1 transcription thus to activate OsRDR1-dependent antiviral RNA silencing pathway
OsMADS57	OsRDR1	A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.	 We also show that overexpression of miR444-resistant OsMADS57 reduced OsRDR1 expression and rice resistance against RSV infection and knockout of OsRDR1 reduced rice resistance against RSV infection
