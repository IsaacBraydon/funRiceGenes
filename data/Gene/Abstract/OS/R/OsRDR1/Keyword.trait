OsRDR1	resistance	A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.	Expression of miR444 is enhanced by infection of Rice stripe virus (RSV) and overexpression of miR444 improves rice resistance against RSV infection accompanied by upregulation of OsRDR1 expression
OsRDR1	resistance	A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.	We also show that overexpression of miR444-resistant OsMADS57 reduced OsRDR1 expression and rice resistance against RSV infection and knockout of OsRDR1 reduced rice resistance against RSV infection
OsRDR1	rice stripe virus	A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.	Expression of miR444 is enhanced by infection of Rice stripe virus (RSV) and overexpression of miR444 improves rice resistance against RSV infection accompanied by upregulation of OsRDR1 expression
