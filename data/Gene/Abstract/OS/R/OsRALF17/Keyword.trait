OsRALF17	growth	Rice pollen-specific OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 are essential for pollen tube growth.	 Exogenously applied OsRALF17 or OsRALF19 peptide inhibited pollen tube germination and elongation at high concentrations but enhanced tube elongation at low concentrations, indicating growth regulation
OsRALF17	pollen	Rice pollen-specific OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 are essential for pollen tube growth.	Rice pollen-specific OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 are essential for pollen tube growth.
OsRALF17	pollen	Rice pollen-specific OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 are essential for pollen tube growth.	 Among the 41 RALF members in rice, OsRALF17 was specifically expressed at the highest level in pollen and pollen tubes
OsRALF17	pollen	Rice pollen-specific OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 are essential for pollen tube growth.	 Exogenously applied OsRALF17 or OsRALF19 peptide inhibited pollen tube germination and elongation at high concentrations but enhanced tube elongation at low concentrations, indicating growth regulation
OsRALF17	pollen	Rice pollen-specific OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 are essential for pollen tube growth.	 Double mutants of OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 (ralf17/19) exhibited almost full male sterility with defects in pollen hydration, germination, and tube elongation, which was partially recovered by exogenous treatment with OsRALF17 peptide
OsRALF17	pollen	Rice pollen-specific OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 are essential for pollen tube growth.	 This study revealed that two partially functionally redundant OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 bind to OsMTD2 and transmit reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals for pollen tube germination and integrity maintenance in rice
OsRALF17	sterility	Rice pollen-specific OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 are essential for pollen tube growth.	 Double mutants of OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 (ralf17/19) exhibited almost full male sterility with defects in pollen hydration, germination, and tube elongation, which was partially recovered by exogenous treatment with OsRALF17 peptide
OsRALF17	male sterility	Rice pollen-specific OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 are essential for pollen tube growth.	 Double mutants of OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 (ralf17/19) exhibited almost full male sterility with defects in pollen hydration, germination, and tube elongation, which was partially recovered by exogenous treatment with OsRALF17 peptide
OsRALF17	reactive oxygen species	Rice pollen-specific OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 are essential for pollen tube growth.	 This study revealed that two partially functionally redundant OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 bind to OsMTD2 and transmit reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals for pollen tube germination and integrity maintenance in rice
OsRALF17	pollen hydration	Rice pollen-specific OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 are essential for pollen tube growth.	 Double mutants of OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 (ralf17/19) exhibited almost full male sterility with defects in pollen hydration, germination, and tube elongation, which was partially recovered by exogenous treatment with OsRALF17 peptide
