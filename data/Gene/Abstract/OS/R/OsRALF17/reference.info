Pollen tube growth is essential for successful double fertilization, which is critical for grain yield in crop plants. Rapid alkalinization factors (RALFs) function as ligands for signal transduction during fertilization. However, functional studies on RALF in monocot plants are lacking. Herein, we functionally characterized two pollen-specific RALFs in rice (Oryza sativa) using multiple CRISPR/Cas9-induced loss-of-function mutants, peptide treatment, expression analyses, and tag reporter lines. Among the 41 RALF members in rice, OsRALF17 was specifically expressed at the highest level in pollen and pollen tubes. Exogenously applied OsRALF17 or OsRALF19 peptide inhibited pollen tube germination and elongation at high concentrations but enhanced tube elongation at low concentrations, indicating growth regulation. Double mutants of OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 (ralf17/19) exhibited almost full male sterility with defects in pollen hydration, germination, and tube elongation, which was partially recovered by exogenous treatment with OsRALF17 peptide. This study revealed that two partially functionally redundant OsRALF17 and OsRALF19 bind to OsMTD2 and transmit reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals for pollen tube germination and integrity maintenance in rice. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed their common downstream genes, in osmtd2 and ralf17/19. This study provides new insights into the role of RALF, expanding our knowledge of the biological role of RALF in regulating rice fertilization. This article is protected by copyright.
