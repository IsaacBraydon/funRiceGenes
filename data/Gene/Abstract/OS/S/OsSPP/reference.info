Signal peptide peptidase (SPP) is a multi-transmembrane aspartic proteinase involved in regulated intramembrane proteolysis, which is implicated in fundamental life processes such as immunological response, cell signaling, tissue differentiation, and embryogenesis. In this study, we identified two rice SPPs: OsSPP1 and OsSPP2. Green fluorescent protein-fused OsSPP1 and OsSPP2 were localized to the ER in cultured plant cells. In situ hybridization showed that OsSPPs were strongly expressed in vegetative shoot apex, young panicle, developing panicle, and the early developing florets. Undifferentiated cells, which have the potential to differentiate into all of the aerial parts of the plant are presented in the shoot apex. OsSPPs are located in both the undifferentiated cells, and the early differentiated cells at the shoot apex. These results suggest that rice SPPs have an important function in differentiation and development at the shoot apex. The expression of the shoot apex and ER localization is equal to dicot Arabidopsis thaliana, and will have common crucial roles in plant.
PNAS-2000-Lunn-12914-9.pdf	Purification, molecular cloning, and sequence analysis of sucrose-6F-phosphate phosphohydrolase from plants	2000	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization Plant Industry, GPO Box 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia. john.lunn@pi.csiro.au	Sucrose-6(F)-phosphate phosphohydrolase (SPP; EC ) catalyzes the final step in the pathway of sucrose biosynthesis and is the only enzyme of photosynthetic carbon assimilation for which the gene has not been identified. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity from rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaves and partially sequenced. The rice leaf enzyme is a dimer with a native molecular mass of 100 kDa and a subunit molecular mass of 50 kDa. The enzyme is highly specific for sucrose 6(F)-phosphate with a K(m) of 65 microM and a specific activity of 1250 micromol min(-1) mg(-1) protein. The activity is dependent on Mg(2+) with a remarkably low K(a) of 8-9 microM and is weakly inhibited by sucrose. Three peptides from cleavage of the purified rice SPP with endoproteinase Lys-C showed similarity to the deduced amino acid sequences of three predicted open reading frames (ORF) in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome and one in the genome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, as well as cDNA clones from Arabidopsis, maize, and other species in the GenBank database of expressed sequence tags. The putative maize SPP cDNA clone contained an ORF encoding a 420-amino acid polypeptide. Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli showed that this cDNA clone encoded a functional SPP enzyme. The 260-amino acid N-terminal catalytic domain of the maize SPP is homologous to the C-terminal region of sucrose-phosphate synthase. A PSI-BLAST search of the GenBank database indicated that the maize SPP is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase hydrolase/phosphatase superfamily.
