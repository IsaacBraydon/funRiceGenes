OsSPP	shoot	Signal peptide peptidases are expressed in the shoot apex of rice, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum	 In situ hybridization showed that OsSPPs were strongly expressed in vegetative shoot apex, young panicle, developing panicle, and the early developing florets
OsSPP	shoot	Signal peptide peptidases are expressed in the shoot apex of rice, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum	 OsSPPs are located in both the undifferentiated cells, and the early differentiated cells at the shoot apex
OsSPP	panicle	Signal peptide peptidases are expressed in the shoot apex of rice, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum	 In situ hybridization showed that OsSPPs were strongly expressed in vegetative shoot apex, young panicle, developing panicle, and the early developing florets
OsSPP	vegetative	Signal peptide peptidases are expressed in the shoot apex of rice, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum	 In situ hybridization showed that OsSPPs were strongly expressed in vegetative shoot apex, young panicle, developing panicle, and the early developing florets
