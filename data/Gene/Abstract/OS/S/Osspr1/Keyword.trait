Osspr1	root	Is Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) the underlying factor for inhibited root growth in Osspr1?	In this addendum, we proposed a possible hypothesis that OsSPR1 maintained the mitochondria function to restrict H2O2 production in root apex for normal root development
Osspr1	root	Is Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) the underlying factor for inhibited root growth in Osspr1?	Is Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) the underlying factor for inhibited root growth in Osspr1?
Osspr1	root	OsARF12, a transcription activator on auxin response gene, regulates root elongation and affects iron accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa)	The knockout of OsARF12 also altered the abundance of mitochondrial iron-regulated (OsMIR), iron (Fe)-regulated transporter1 (OsIRT1) and short postembryonic root1 (OsSPR1) in roots of rice, and resulted in lower Fe content
Osspr1	root	Identification of a novel mitochondrial protein, short postembryonic roots 1 (SPR1), involved in root development and iron homeostasis in Oryza sativa	* A rice mutant, Oryza sativa short postembryonic roots 1 (Osspr1), has been characterized
Osspr1	root	Identification of a novel mitochondrial protein, short postembryonic roots 1 (SPR1), involved in root development and iron homeostasis in Oryza sativa	* Osspr1 mutants exhibited decreased root cell elongation
Osspr1	root	Identification of a novel mitochondrial protein, short postembryonic roots 1 (SPR1), involved in root development and iron homeostasis in Oryza sativa	Complementation of the mutant confirmed that OsSPR1 is involved in post-embryonic root elongation and iron homeostasis in rice
Osspr1	growth	Is Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) the underlying factor for inhibited root growth in Osspr1?	Is Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) the underlying factor for inhibited root growth in Osspr1?
Osspr1	iron	Identification of a novel mitochondrial protein, short postembryonic roots 1 (SPR1), involved in root development and iron homeostasis in Oryza sativa	Complementation of the mutant confirmed that OsSPR1 is involved in post-embryonic root elongation and iron homeostasis in rice
