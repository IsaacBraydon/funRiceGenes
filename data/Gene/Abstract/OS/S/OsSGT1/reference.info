1-s2.0-S0006291X03026287-main.pdf	Characterization of Rad6 from a higher plant, rice (Oryza sativa L.) and its interaction with Sgt1, a subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex	2004	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Department of Applied Biological Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Science University of Tokyo, 2641 Yamazaki, Noda-shi, 278-8510 Chiba-ken, Japan.	We report here the existence of interactions between a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Rad6, from rice, Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare (OsRad6), and Sgt1 (OsSgt1), a novel subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. Rad6 is not only related to post-replicational repair but also to the proteasome system, while Sgt1 has a function in kinetochore assembly. The relationship between the two is unexpected, but of great interest. The open reading frames of OsRad6 and OsSgt1 encode predicted products of 152 and 367 amino acid residues, respectively, with molecular weights of 17.3 and 40.9kDa. Two-hybrid and pull-down analyses indicated that OsRad6 binds to OsSgt1, and transcripts of both OsRad6 and OsSgt1 were found to be strongly expressed only in the proliferating tissues such as the shoot apical meristem, suggesting that their expression is cell cycle-dependent. The amount of the Rad6 mRNA in cultured cells increased rapidly after division was halted, and mRNA levels of Rad6 and Sgt1 were induced by UV- and DNA-damaging agents such as MMS or H(2)O(2). The Rad6 pathway for repair or the proteasome system may thus require Sgt1 as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme.
j.1365-313X.2008.03697.x.pdf	Contribution of salicylic acid glucosyltransferase, OsSGT1, to chemically induced disease resistance in rice plants	2009	Plant J	Agricultural & Veterinary Research Laboratories, Meiji Seika Kaisha Ltd, Yokohama 222-8567, Japan. kenji_umemura@meiji.co.jp	Systemic acquired resistance (SAR), a natural disease response in plants, can be induced chemically. Salicylic acid (SA) acts as a key endogenous signaling molecule that mediates SAR in dicotyledonous plants. However, the role of SA in monocotyledonous plants has yet to be elucidated. In this study, the mode of action of the agrochemical protectant chemical probenazole was assessed by microarray-based determination of gene expression. Cloning and characterization of the most highly activated probenazole-responsive gene revealed that it encodes UDP-glucose:SA glucosyltransferase (OsSGT1), which catalyzes the conversion of free SA into SA O-beta-glucoside (SAG). We found that SAG accumulated in rice leaf tissue following treatment with probenazole or 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid. A putative OsSGT1 gene from the rice cultivar Akitakomachi was cloned and the gene product expressed in Escherichia coli was characterized, and the results suggested that probenazole-responsive OsSGT1 is involved in the production of SAG. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated silencing of the OsSGT1 gene significantly reduced the probenazole-dependent development of resistance against blast disease, further supporting the suggestion that OsSGT1 is a key mediator of development of chemically induced disease resistance. The OsSGT1 gene may contribute to the SA signaling mechanism by inducing up-regulation of SAG in rice plants.
MPMI-21-3-0294.pdf	OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact and function in rice basal disease resistance	2008	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Institute of Plant Physiology & Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shangai, China.	The RAR1 and SGT1 proteins function synergistically or antagonistically in plant innate immune responses. Here, we show that the rice orthologs OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact in vivo and in yeast. They displayed conserved roles in Arabidopsis disease resistance through ectopic expression in the Arabidopsis rar1 and sgt1 mutants. Overexpression of OsRar1 and OsSGT1 in rice significantly increased basal resistance to a virulent bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99 but not to another virulent strain DY89031, suggesting race-specific-like basal resistance conferred by OsRar1 and OsSGT1. OsRar1-OE and OsSGT1-OE plants also enhanced resistance to all four virulent blast fungal Magnaporthe oryzae races. Overexpression of the OsSGT1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion most likely caused a dominant negative phenotype which led to race-specific-like basal resistance. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsSGT1-GFP show enhanced resistance to DY89031 but decreased resistance to PXO99, implying that OsSGT1 might be the target of a component required for DY89031 virulence or OsSGT1-GFP might stabilize weak resistance proteins against DY89031. Consistent with the hypothesis of the dominant negative regulation, we observed the reduced sensitivity to auxin of OsSGT1-GFP plants compared with the wild-type ones, and the curling-root phenotype in OsSGT1-OE plants. These results collectively suggest that OsRar1 and OsSGT1 might be differentially required for rice basal disease resistance. Our current study also provides new insight into the roles of OsSGT1 in basal disease resistance.
Plant Physiol.-2006-Fujiwara-734-45.pdf	Proteomics of Rac GTPase signaling reveals its predominant role in elicitor-induced defense response of cultured rice cells	2006	Plant Physiol	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma 630-0101, Japan.	We have previously shown that a human small GTPase Rac homolog, OsRac1, from rice (Oryza sativa) induces cascades of defense responses in rice plants and cultured cells. Sphingolipid elicitors (SEs) have been similarly shown to activate defense responses in rice. Therefore, to systematically analyze proteins whose expression levels are altered by OsRac1 and/or SE treatment, we performed a differential display analysis of proteins by the use of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. A total of 271 proteins whose expression levels were altered by constitutively active (CA)-OsRac1 or SE were identified. Interestingly, of 100 proteins that were up-regulated by a SE, 87 were also induced by CA-OsRac1, suggesting that OsRac1 plays a pivotal role in defense responses induced by SE in cultured rice cells. In addition, CA-OsRac1 induces the expression of 119 proteins. Many proteins, such as pathogenesis-related proteins, SGT1, and prohibitin, which are known to be involved in the defense response, were found among these proteins. Proteins involved in redox regulation, chaperones such as heat shock proteins, BiP, and chaperonin 60, proteases and protease inhibitors, cytoskeletal proteins, subunits of proteasomes, and enzymes involved in the phenylpropanoid and ethylene biosynthesis pathways were found to be induced by CA-OsRac1 or SE. Results of our proteomic analysis revealed that OsRac1 is able to induce many proteins in various signaling and metabolic pathways and plays a predominant role in the defense response in cultured rice cells.
