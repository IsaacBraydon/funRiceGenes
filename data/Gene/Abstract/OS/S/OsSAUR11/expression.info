OsSAUR11	Overexpression of a novel small auxin-up RNA gene, OsSAUR11, enhances rice deep rootedness. |  Overexpression of OsSAUR11 significantly enhanced the ratio of deep rooting of transgenic rice, but knockout of this gene did not significantly affect deep rooting |  The expression of OsSAUR11 in rice root was induced by auxin and drought, and OsSAUR11-GFP was localized both in the plasma membrane and cell nucleus |  Through an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and gene expression analysis in transgenic rice, we found that the transcription factor OsbZIP62 can bind to the promoter of OsSAUR11 and promote its expression	Overexpression of a novel small auxin-up RNA gene, OsSAUR11, enhances rice deep rootedness. |  Overexpression of OsSAUR11 significantly enhanced the ratio of deep rooting of transgenic rice, but knockout of this gene did not significantly affect deep rooting
