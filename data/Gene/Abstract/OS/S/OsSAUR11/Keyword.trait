OsSAUR11	transcription factor	Overexpression of a novel small auxin-up RNA gene, OsSAUR11, enhances rice deep rootedness.	 Through an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and gene expression analysis in transgenic rice, we found that the transcription factor OsbZIP62 can bind to the promoter of OsSAUR11 and promote its expression
OsSAUR11	root	Overexpression of a novel small auxin-up RNA gene, OsSAUR11, enhances rice deep rootedness.	 The expression of OsSAUR11 in rice root was induced by auxin and drought, and OsSAUR11-GFP was localized both in the plasma membrane and cell nucleus
OsSAUR11	root	Overexpression of a novel small auxin-up RNA gene, OsSAUR11, enhances rice deep rootedness.	 CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a novel gene OsSAUR11 positively regulates deep rooting in rice, which provides an empirical basis for future improvement of rice root architecture and drought resistance
OsSAUR11	auxin	Overexpression of a novel small auxin-up RNA gene, OsSAUR11, enhances rice deep rootedness.	 The expression of OsSAUR11 in rice root was induced by auxin and drought, and OsSAUR11-GFP was localized both in the plasma membrane and cell nucleus
OsSAUR11	resistance	Overexpression of a novel small auxin-up RNA gene, OsSAUR11, enhances rice deep rootedness.	 CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a novel gene OsSAUR11 positively regulates deep rooting in rice, which provides an empirical basis for future improvement of rice root architecture and drought resistance
OsSAUR11	drought	Overexpression of a novel small auxin-up RNA gene, OsSAUR11, enhances rice deep rootedness.
