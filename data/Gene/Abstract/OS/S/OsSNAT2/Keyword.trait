OsSNAT2	temperature	Cloning and characterization of the serotonin N-acetyltransferase-2 gene (SNAT2) in rice (Oryza sativa).	The Km and Vmax values of the purified recombinant OsSNAT2 were 371 μm and 4,700 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein, respectively; the enzyme's optimal activity temperature was 45°C
OsSNAT2	cytoplasm	Cloning and characterization of the serotonin N-acetyltransferase-2 gene (SNAT2) in rice (Oryza sativa).	Confocal microscopy showed that the OsSNAT2 protein was localized to both the cytoplasm and chloroplasts
OsSNAT2	melatonin	Cloning and characterization of the serotonin N-acetyltransferase-2 gene (SNAT2) in rice (Oryza sativa).	The OsSNAT1 and OsSNAT2 transcripts were similarly suppressed in rice leaves during the melatonin induction after cadmium treatment
OsSNAT2	cadmium	Cloning and characterization of the serotonin N-acetyltransferase-2 gene (SNAT2) in rice (Oryza sativa).	The OsSNAT1 and OsSNAT2 transcripts were similarly suppressed in rice leaves during the melatonin induction after cadmium treatment
