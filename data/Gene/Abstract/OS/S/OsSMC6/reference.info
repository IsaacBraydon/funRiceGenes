NA	The SMC5/6 complex subunit MMS21 regulates stem cell proliferation in rice.	2023	Plant Cell Rep	College of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	SMC5/6 complex subunit OsMMS21 is involved in cell cycle and hormone signaling and required for stem cell proliferation during shoot and root development in rice. The structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC)5/6 complex is required for nucleolar integrity and DNA metabolism. Moreover, METHYL METHANESULFONATE SENSITIVITY GENE 21 (MMS21), a SUMO E3 ligase that is part of the SMC5/6 complex, is essential for the root stem cell niche and cell cycle transition in Arabidopsis. However, its specific role in rice remains unclear. Here, OsSMC5 and OsSMC6 single heterozygous mutants were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to elucidate the function of SMC5/6 subunits, including OsSMC5, OsSMC6, and OsMMS21, in cell proliferation in rice. ossmc5/ + and ossmc6/ + heterozygous single mutants did not yield homozygous mutants in their progeny, indicating that OsSMC5 and OsSMC6 both play necessary roles during embryo formation. Loss of OsMMS21 caused severe defects in both the shoot and roots in rice. Transcriptome analysis showed a significant decrease in the expression of genes involved in auxin signaling in the roots of osmms21 mutants. Moreover, the expression levels of the cycB2-1 and MCM genes, which are involved the cell cycle, were significantly lower in the shoots of the mutants, indicating that OsMMS21 was involved in both hormone signaling pathways and the cell cycle. Overall, these findings indicate that the SUMO E3 ligase OsMMS21 is required for both shoot and root stem cell niches, improving the understanding of the function of the SMC5/6 complex in rice.
