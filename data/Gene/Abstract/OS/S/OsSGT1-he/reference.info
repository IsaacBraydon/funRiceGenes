1-s2.0-S0006291X03026287-main.pdf	Characterization of Rad6 from a higher plant, rice (Oryza sativa L.) and its interaction with Sgt1, a subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex	2004	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Department of Applied Biological Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Science University of Tokyo, 2641 Yamazaki, Noda-shi, 278-8510 Chiba-ken, Japan.	We report here the existence of interactions between a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Rad6, from rice, Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare (OsRad6), and Sgt1 (OsSgt1), a novel subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. Rad6 is not only related to post-replicational repair but also to the proteasome system, while Sgt1 has a function in kinetochore assembly. The relationship between the two is unexpected, but of great interest. The open reading frames of OsRad6 and OsSgt1 encode predicted products of 152 and 367 amino acid residues, respectively, with molecular weights of 17.3 and 40.9kDa. Two-hybrid and pull-down analyses indicated that OsRad6 binds to OsSgt1, and transcripts of both OsRad6 and OsSgt1 were found to be strongly expressed only in the proliferating tissues such as the shoot apical meristem, suggesting that their expression is cell cycle-dependent. The amount of the Rad6 mRNA in cultured cells increased rapidly after division was halted, and mRNA levels of Rad6 and Sgt1 were induced by UV- and DNA-damaging agents such as MMS or H(2)O(2). The Rad6 pathway for repair or the proteasome system may thus require Sgt1 as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme.
MPMI-21-3-0294.pdf	OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact and function in rice basal disease resistance	2008	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Institute of Plant Physiology & Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shangai, China.	The RAR1 and SGT1 proteins function synergistically or antagonistically in plant innate immune responses. Here, we show that the rice orthologs OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact in vivo and in yeast. They displayed conserved roles in Arabidopsis disease resistance through ectopic expression in the Arabidopsis rar1 and sgt1 mutants. Overexpression of OsRar1 and OsSGT1 in rice significantly increased basal resistance to a virulent bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99 but not to another virulent strain DY89031, suggesting race-specific-like basal resistance conferred by OsRar1 and OsSGT1. OsRar1-OE and OsSGT1-OE plants also enhanced resistance to all four virulent blast fungal Magnaporthe oryzae races. Overexpression of the OsSGT1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion most likely caused a dominant negative phenotype which led to race-specific-like basal resistance. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsSGT1-GFP show enhanced resistance to DY89031 but decreased resistance to PXO99, implying that OsSGT1 might be the target of a component required for DY89031 virulence or OsSGT1-GFP might stabilize weak resistance proteins against DY89031. Consistent with the hypothesis of the dominant negative regulation, we observed the reduced sensitivity to auxin of OsSGT1-GFP plants compared with the wild-type ones, and the curling-root phenotype in OsSGT1-OE plants. These results collectively suggest that OsRar1 and OsSGT1 might be differentially required for rice basal disease resistance. Our current study also provides new insight into the roles of OsSGT1 in basal disease resistance.
