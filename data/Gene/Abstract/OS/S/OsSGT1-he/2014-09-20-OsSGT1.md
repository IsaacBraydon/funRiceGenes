## Connection
1. __OsRad6__, __OsSGT1__, [Characterization of Rad6 from a higher plant, rice (Oryza sativa L.) and its interaction with Sgt1, a subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of Rad6 from a higher plant, rice (Oryza sativa L.) and its interaction with Sgt1, a subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex%5BTitle%5D)),  Nipponbare (OsRad6), and Sgt1 (OsSgt1), a novel subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, The open reading frames of OsRad6 and OsSgt1 encode predicted products of 152 and 367 amino acid residues, respectively, with molecular weights of 17, Two-hybrid and pull-down analyses indicated that OsRad6 binds to OsSgt1, and transcripts of both OsRad6 and OsSgt1 were found to be strongly expressed only in the proliferating tissues such as the shoot apical meristem, suggesting that their expression is cell cycle-dependent, Rad6 is not only related to post-replicational repair but also to the proteasome system, while Sgt1 has a function in kinetochore assembly, The amount of the Rad6 mRNA in cultured cells increased rapidly after division was halted, and mRNA levels of Rad6 and Sgt1 were induced by UV- and DNA-damaging agents such as MMS or H(2)O(2), The Rad6 pathway for repair or the proteasome system may thus require Sgt1 as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme,Characterization of Rad6 from a higher plant, rice (Oryza sativa L.) and its interaction with Sgt1, a subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex
2. __OsRAR1__, __OsSGT1__, [OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact and function in rice basal disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact and function in rice basal disease resistance%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we show that the rice orthologs OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact in vivo and in yeast, Overexpression of OsRar1 and OsSGT1 in rice significantly increased basal resistance to a virulent bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv, oryzae PXO99 but not to another virulent strain DY89031, suggesting race-specific-like basal resistance conferred by OsRar1 and OsSGT1, OsRar1-OE and OsSGT1-OE plants also enhanced resistance to all four virulent blast fungal Magnaporthe oryzae races, These results collectively suggest that OsRar1 and OsSGT1 might be differentially required for rice basal disease resistance,OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact and function in rice basal disease resistance,The RAR1 and SGT1 proteins function synergistically or antagonistically in plant innate immune responses, They displayed conserved roles in Arabidopsis disease resistance through ectopic expression in the Arabidopsis rar1 and sgt1 mutants
