OsSPX-MFS3|OsPSS3	OsSYP21	Phosphate-dependent regulation of vacuolar trafficking of OsSPX-MFSs is critical for maintaining intracellular phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 A yeast two-hybrid screen identified that two SNARE proteins, OsSYP21 and OsSYP22, interact with the MFS domain of OsSPX-MFS3
OsSPX-MFS3|OsPSS3	OsSYP21	Phosphate-dependent regulation of vacuolar trafficking of OsSPX-MFSs is critical for maintaining intracellular phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 Further genetic and cytological analyses indicate that OsSYP21 and OsSYP22 facilitate trafficking of OsSPX-MFS3 from PVCs to the tonoplast
