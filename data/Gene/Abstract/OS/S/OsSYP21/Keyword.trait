OsSYP21	Pi	Phosphate-dependent regulation of vacuolar trafficking of OsSPX-MFSs is critical for maintaining intracellular phosphate homeostasis in rice	These data indicated that the SPX domains of OsSPX-MFSs sense cellular Pi (InsP) levels and, under Pi-depleted conditions, inhibit the interaction between OsSPX-MFSs and OsSYP21/22 and subsequent trafficking of OsSPX-MFSs from PVCs to the tonoplast.
