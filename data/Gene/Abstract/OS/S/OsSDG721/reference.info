NA	SET DOMAIN GROUP 721 protein functions in saline-alkaline stress tolerance in the model rice variety Kitaake	2021	Plant Biotechnol J	Key Laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of the Ministry of Education (MOE), Northeast Normal University, Changchun, P. R. China.	To isolate the genetic locus responsible for saline-alkaline stress tolerance, we developed a high-throughput activation tagging-based T-DNA insertion mutagenesis method using the model rice (Oryza sativa L.) variety Kitaake. One of the activation-tagged insertion lines, activation tagging 7 (AC7), showed increased tolerance to saline-alkaline stress. This phenotype resulted from the overexpression of a gene that encodes a SET DOMAIN GROUP 721 protein with H3K4 methyltransferase activity. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsSDG721 showed saline-alkaline stress-tolerant phenotypes, along with increased leaf angle, advanced heading and ripening dates. By contrast, ossdg721 loss-of-function mutants showed increased sensitivity to saline-alkaline stress characterized by decreased survival rates and reduction in plant height, grain size, grain weight and leaf angle. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of wild-type Kitaake and ossdg721 mutants indicated that OsSDG721 positively regulates the expression level of HIGH-AFFINITY POTASSIUM (K+ ) TRANSPORTER1;5 (OsHKT1;5), which encodes a Na+ -selective transporter that maintains K+ /Na+ homeostasis under salt stress. Furthermore, we showed that OsSDG721 binds to and deposits the H3K4me3 mark in the promoter and coding region of OsHKT1;5, thereby upregulating OsHKT1;5 expression under saline-alkaline stress. Overall, by generating Kitaake activation-tagging pools, we established that the H3K4 methyltransferase OsSDG721 enhances saline-alkaline stress tolerance in rice.
NA	SDG721 and SDG705 are required for rice growth.	2018	J Integr Plant Biol	National Engineering Laboratory of Crop Stress Resistance/ Key Laboratory of Crop Biology of Anhui Province, School of Life Sciences, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei 230036, China.	H3K4me3 plays important roles in development, transcription, and environmental responses. Here, we report that SDG721 (SET-domain group protein 721) and SDG705 are involved in regulating rice development. SDG721 and SDG705 encode TRITHORAX-like proteins, which appear to modulate H3K4 methylation levels. Loss of SDG721 and SDG705 function resulted in GA-deficient phenotypes, including semi-dwarfism, reduced cell length, and reduced panicle branching. The transcripts levels and H3K4me3 levels of GA biosynthesis genes and GA signaling pathway genes were downregulated in the sdg721 sdg705 plants. Together, these results suggest that SDG721 and SDG705 regulate H3K4 methylation, which is crucial for plant development in rice.
