OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8	OsSDG721	SET DOMAIN GROUP 721 protein functions in saline-alkaline stress tolerance in the model rice variety Kitaake	 RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of wild-type Kitaake and ossdg721 mutants indicated that OsSDG721 positively regulates the expression level of HIGH-AFFINITY POTASSIUM (K+ ) TRANSPORTER1;5 (OsHKT1;5), which encodes a Na+ -selective transporter that maintains K+ /Na+ homeostasis under salt stress
OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8	OsSDG721	SET DOMAIN GROUP 721 protein functions in saline-alkaline stress tolerance in the model rice variety Kitaake	 Furthermore, we showed that OsSDG721 binds to and deposits the H3K4me3 mark in the promoter and coding region of OsHKT1;5, thereby upregulating OsHKT1;5 expression under saline-alkaline stress
