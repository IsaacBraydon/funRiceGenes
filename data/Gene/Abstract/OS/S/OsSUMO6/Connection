OsSUMO1	OsSUMO6	Characterization of novel SUMO family genes in the rice genome.	 SUMOylation using a bacterial expression system revealed that the rice HSF7 homolog was modified by the six rice SUMOs, and further suggested that OsSUMO1, OsSUMO3, OsSUMO4 and OsSUMO6 are involved in its multiple SUMOylation
OsSUMO4	OsSUMO6	Characterization of novel SUMO family genes in the rice genome.	) SUMO genes, OsSUMO4, OsSUMO5 and OsSUMO6, in addition to the known SUMO genes OsSUMO1-OsSUMO3
OsSUMO4	OsSUMO6	Characterization of novel SUMO family genes in the rice genome.	 Among the amino acid sequences of rice SUMO proteins, consensus motifs (ΨKXE/D) of the SUMO acceptor site were found in OsSUMO3, OsSUMO4, OsSUMO5 and OsSUMO6
