OsSEC24	tolerance	OsSEC24, a functional SEC24-like protein in rice, improves tolerance to iron deficiency and high pH by enhancing H(+) secretion mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase.	To explore how OsSEC24 confers tolerance to iron deficiency, we utilized transgenic tobacco, rice and rice protoplasts
OsSEC24	iron	OsSEC24, a functional SEC24-like protein in rice, improves tolerance to iron deficiency and high pH by enhancing H(+) secretion mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase.	To explore how OsSEC24 confers tolerance to iron deficiency, we utilized transgenic tobacco, rice and rice protoplasts
OsSEC24	iron	OsSEC24, a functional SEC24-like protein in rice, improves tolerance to iron deficiency and high pH by enhancing H(+) secretion mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase.	H(+) flux measurements using Non-invasive Micro-test Technology (NMT) indicated that the transgenic OsSEC24 tobacco and rice enhanced H(+) efflux under iron deficiency
OsSEC24	iron	OsSEC24, a functional SEC24-like protein in rice, improves tolerance to iron deficiency and high pH by enhancing H(+) secretion mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase.	Together, OsSEC24 vesicles, along with PM-H(+)-ATPases stimulate roots formation under iron deficiency by enhancing rhizosphere acidification
OsSEC24	plasma membrane	OsSEC24, a functional SEC24-like protein in rice, improves tolerance to iron deficiency and high pH by enhancing H(+) secretion mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase.	Conversely, the application of plasma membrane PM-H(+)-ATPase inhibitor vanadate elucidated that H(+) secretion increased by OsSEC24 was mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase
