DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	OsSPL18	OsSPL18 controls grain weight and grain number in rice.	 Quantitative expression analysis showed that DEP1, a major grain number regulator, was significantly down-regulated in OsSPL18 KO lines
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	OsSPL18	OsSPL18 controls grain weight and grain number in rice.	 Both yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase (LUC) assays showed that OsSPL18 could bind to the DEP1 promoter, suggesting that OsSPL18 regulates panicle development by positively regulating the expression of DEP1
OsSPL18	qGW8|OsSPL16|GW8	MiR529a controls plant height, tiller number, panicle architecture and grain size by regulating SPL target genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 And panicle architecture and grain size were controlled by miR529a through altering the expression of all five target genes OsSPL2, OsSPL7, OsSPL14, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	OsSPL18	MiR529a controls plant height, tiller number, panicle architecture and grain size by regulating SPL target genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 And panicle architecture and grain size were controlled by miR529a through altering the expression of all five target genes OsSPL2, OsSPL7, OsSPL14, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18
OsSPL18	OsSPL7	MiR529a controls plant height, tiller number, panicle architecture and grain size by regulating SPL target genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 And panicle architecture and grain size were controlled by miR529a through altering the expression of all five target genes OsSPL2, OsSPL7, OsSPL14, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18
HOS59	OsSPL18	KNOX II transcription factor HOS59 functions in regulating rice grain size.	 Meanwhile, our IP-MS datasets showed that HOS59 was closely associated with BELL family proteins, some grain size regulators (OsSPL13, OsSPL16, OsSPL18, SLG, etc
HOS59	OsSPL18	KNOX II transcription factor HOS59 functions in regulating rice grain size.	 The qRT-PCR results showed that mutation of the HOS59 gene led to upregulation of some grain size-related genes such as OsSPL13, OsSPL18, and PGL2
