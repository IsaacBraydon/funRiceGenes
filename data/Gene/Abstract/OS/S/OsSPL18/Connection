DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	OsSPL18	OsSPL18 controls grain weight and grain number in rice.	 Quantitative expression analysis showed that DEP1, a major grain number regulator, was significantly down-regulated in OsSPL18 KO lines
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	OsSPL18	OsSPL18 controls grain weight and grain number in rice.	 Both yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase (LUC) assays showed that OsSPL18 could bind to the DEP1 promoter, suggesting that OsSPL18 regulates panicle development by positively regulating the expression of DEP1
