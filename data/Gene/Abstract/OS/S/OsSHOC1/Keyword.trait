OsSHOC1	meiosis	OsSHOC1 and OsPTD1 are essential for crossover formation during rice meiosis.	 Our results suggest that OsSHOC1 and OsPTD1 are essential for rice fertilization and CO formation, possibly by stabilizing the recombinant intermediates during meiosis
OsSHOC1	sterile	OsSHOC1 and OsPTD1 are essential for crossover formation during rice meiosis.	 Osshoc1 was sterile both in male and female gametophytes, and it showed a striking reduction in the number of meiotic COs, indicating that OsSHOC1 was required for normal CO formation
OsSHOC1	fertility	OsSHOC1 and OsPTD1 are essential for crossover formation during rice meiosis.	 Further investigations showed that OsSHOC1 physically interacted with OsPTD1 and that the latter was also required for normal CO formation and plant fertility
OsSHOC1	meiotic	OsSHOC1 and OsPTD1 are essential for crossover formation during rice meiosis.	 Osshoc1 was sterile both in male and female gametophytes, and it showed a striking reduction in the number of meiotic COs, indicating that OsSHOC1 was required for normal CO formation
OsSHOC1	crossover	OsSHOC1 and OsPTD1 are essential for crossover formation during rice meiosis.	OsSHOC1 and OsPTD1 are essential for crossover formation during rice meiosis.
