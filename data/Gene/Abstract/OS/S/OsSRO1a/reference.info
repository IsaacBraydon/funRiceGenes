NA	OsSRO1a Interacts with RNA Binding Domain-Containing Protein (OsRBD1) and Functions in Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Yeast.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Plant Molecular Biology Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology New Delhi, India.	SRO1 is an important regulator of stress and hormonal response in plants and functions by interacting with transcription factors and several other proteins involved in abiotic stress response. In the present study, we report OsRBD1, an RNA binding domain 1- containing protein as a novel interacting partner of OsSRO1a from rice. The interaction of OsSRO1a with OsRBD1 was shown in yeast as well as in planta. Domain-domain interaction study revealed that C-terminal RST domain of OsSRO1a interacts with the N-terminal RRM1 domain of OsRBD1 protein. Both the proteins were found to co-localize in nucleus. Transcript profiling under different stress conditions revealed co-regulation of OsSRO1a and OsRBD1 expression under some abiotic stress conditions. Further, co-transformation of both OsSRO1a and OsRBD1 in yeast conferred enhanced tolerance toward salinity, osmotic, and methylglyoxal treatments. Our study suggests that the interaction of OsSRO1a with OsRBD1 confers enhanced stress tolerance in yeast and may play an important role under abiotic stress responses in plants.
NA	TWI1 regulates cell-to-cell movement of OSH15 to control leaf cell fate.	2018	New Phytol	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, China.	Cell pattern formation in plant leaves has attracted much attention from both plant biologists and breeders. However, in rice, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we describe the isolation and functional characterization of TWISTED-LEAF1 (TWI1), a critical gene involved in the development of the mestome sheath, vascular bundle sheath, interveinal mesophyll and sclerenchyma in rice leaves. Mutant twi1 plants have twisted leaves which might be caused by the compromised development and disordered patterning of bundle sheath, sclerenchyma and interveinal mesophyll cells. Expression of TWI1 can functionally rescue these mutant phenotypes. TWI1 encodes a transcription factor binding protein that interacts with OSH15, a class I KNOTTED1-like homeobox (KNOX) transcription factor. The cell-to-cell trafficking of OSH15 is restricted through its interaction with TWI1. Knockout or knockdown of OSH15 in twi1 rescues the twisted leaf phenotype. These studies reveal a key factor controlling cell pattern formation in rice leaves.
