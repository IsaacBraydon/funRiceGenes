NA	OsSRO1a Interacts with RNA Binding Domain-Containing Protein (OsRBD1) and Functions in Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Yeast.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Plant Molecular Biology Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology New Delhi, India.	SRO1 is an important regulator of stress and hormonal response in plants and functions by interacting with transcription factors and several other proteins involved in abiotic stress response. In the present study, we report OsRBD1, an RNA binding domain 1- containing protein as a novel interacting partner of OsSRO1a from rice. The interaction of OsSRO1a with OsRBD1 was shown in yeast as well as in planta. Domain-domain interaction study revealed that C-terminal RST domain of OsSRO1a interacts with the N-terminal RRM1 domain of OsRBD1 protein. Both the proteins were found to co-localize in nucleus. Transcript profiling under different stress conditions revealed co-regulation of OsSRO1a and OsRBD1 expression under some abiotic stress conditions. Further, co-transformation of both OsSRO1a and OsRBD1 in yeast conferred enhanced tolerance toward salinity, osmotic, and methylglyoxal treatments. Our study suggests that the interaction of OsSRO1a with OsRBD1 confers enhanced stress tolerance in yeast and may play an important role under abiotic stress responses in plants.
NA	TWI1 regulates cell-to-cell movement of OSH15 to control leaf cell fate.	2018	New Phytol	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, China.	Cell pattern formation in plant leaves has attracted much attention from both plant biologists and breeders. However, in rice, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we describe the isolation and functional characterization of TWISTED-LEAF1 (TWI1), a critical gene involved in the development of the mestome sheath, vascular bundle sheath, interveinal mesophyll and sclerenchyma in rice leaves. Mutant twi1 plants have twisted leaves which might be caused by the compromised development and disordered patterning of bundle sheath, sclerenchyma and interveinal mesophyll cells. Expression of TWI1 can functionally rescue these mutant phenotypes. TWI1 encodes a transcription factor binding protein that interacts with OSH15, a class I KNOTTED1-like homeobox (KNOX) transcription factor. The cell-to-cell trafficking of OSH15 is restricted through its interaction with TWI1. Knockout or knockdown of OSH15 in twi1 rescues the twisted leaf phenotype. These studies reveal a key factor controlling cell pattern formation in rice leaves.
NA	The overexpression of OsSRO1a, which encodes an OsNINJA1- and OsMYC2-interacting protein, negatively affects OsMYC2-mediated jasmonate signaling in rice.	2020	Plant Cell Rep	Faculty of Agriculture, Plant Genome and Resource Research Center, Kagawa University, Miki, Kagawa, 761-0795, Japan.	OsNINJA1-interacting protein, OsSRO1a, acts as a mediator that suppresses OsMYC2 activity in response to JA. Jasmonic acid (JA) is an important plant hormone for the stable growth and development of higher plants. The rice gene NOVEL INTERACTOR OF JAZ1 (OsNINJA1) interacts with Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins and is a repressor of JA signaling. In this study, we identified several OsNINJA1-interacting proteins in rice from a yeast two-hybrid screen. Among the newly identified genes, we focused on SIMILAR TO RCD ONE1a (OsSRO1a) and investigated its role in JA signaling. Full-length OsSRO1a interacted with OsNINJA1 in plant cells but not in yeast cells. OsSRO1a also interacted with OsMYC2, a positive transcription factor in JA signaling, in both plant and yeast cells. The expression of OsSRO1a was upregulated at a late phase after JA treatment. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsSRO1a exhibited JA-insensitive phenotypes. In wild-type plants, JA induces resistance against rice bacterial blight, but this phenotype was suppressed in the OsSRO1a-overexpressing plants. Furthermore, the degradation of chlorophyll under dark-induced senescence conditions and the JA-induced upregulation of OsMYC2-responsive genes were suppressed in the OsSRO1a-overexpressing plants. These results suggest that OsSRO1a is a negative regulator of the OsMYC2-mediated JA signaling pathway in rice.
