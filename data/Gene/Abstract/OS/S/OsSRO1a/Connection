D6|OSH15|Oskn3	OsSRO1a|TWI1	TWI1 regulates cell-to-cell movement of OSH15 to control leaf cell fate.	TWI1 regulates cell-to-cell movement of OSH15 to control leaf cell fate.
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	OsSRO1a|TWI1	TWI1 regulates cell-to-cell movement of OSH15 to control leaf cell fate.	 TWI1 encodes a transcription factor binding protein that interacts with OSH15, a class I KNOTTED1-like homeobox (KNOX) transcription factor
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	OsSRO1a|TWI1	TWI1 regulates cell-to-cell movement of OSH15 to control leaf cell fate.	 The cell-to-cell trafficking of OSH15 is restricted through its interaction with TWI1
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	OsSRO1a|TWI1	TWI1 regulates cell-to-cell movement of OSH15 to control leaf cell fate.	 Knockout or knockdown of OSH15 in twi1 rescues the twisted leaf phenotype
OsMYC2	OsSRO1a|TWI1	The overexpression of OsSRO1a, which encodes an OsNINJA1- and OsMYC2-interacting protein, negatively affects OsMYC2-mediated jasmonate signaling in rice.	OsNINJA1-interacting protein, OsSRO1a, acts as a mediator that suppresses OsMYC2 activity in response to JA
OsMYC2	OsSRO1a|TWI1	The overexpression of OsSRO1a, which encodes an OsNINJA1- and OsMYC2-interacting protein, negatively affects OsMYC2-mediated jasmonate signaling in rice.	 OsSRO1a also interacted with OsMYC2, a positive transcription factor in JA signaling, in both plant and yeast cells
OsNINJA1	OsSRO1a|TWI1	The overexpression of OsSRO1a, which encodes an OsNINJA1- and OsMYC2-interacting protein, negatively affects OsMYC2-mediated jasmonate signaling in rice.	 Full-length OsSRO1a interacted with OsNINJA1 in plant cells but not in yeast cells
