D6|OSH15|Oskn3	OsSRO1a|TWI1	TWI1 regulates cell-to-cell movement of OSH15 to control leaf cell fate.	TWI1 regulates cell-to-cell movement of OSH15 to control leaf cell fate.
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	OsSRO1a|TWI1	TWI1 regulates cell-to-cell movement of OSH15 to control leaf cell fate.	 TWI1 encodes a transcription factor binding protein that interacts with OSH15, a class I KNOTTED1-like homeobox (KNOX) transcription factor
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	OsSRO1a|TWI1	TWI1 regulates cell-to-cell movement of OSH15 to control leaf cell fate.	 The cell-to-cell trafficking of OSH15 is restricted through its interaction with TWI1
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	OsSRO1a|TWI1	TWI1 regulates cell-to-cell movement of OSH15 to control leaf cell fate.	 Knockout or knockdown of OSH15 in twi1 rescues the twisted leaf phenotype
