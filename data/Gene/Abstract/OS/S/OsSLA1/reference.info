Leaf angle is an important trait in plants. Here, we demonstrate that the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase OsSLA1 plays an important role in leaf angle regulation in rice (Oryza sativa). OsSLA1 mutant plants exhibited a small leaf angle phenotype due to changes of adaxial cells in the lamina joint. GUS staining revealed that OsSLA1 was highly expressed in adaxial cells of the lamina joint. The OsSLA1 mutant plants were insensitive to exogenous epibrassinolide (eBL) and showed upregulated expression of DWARF and CPD, but downregulated expression of BU1, BUL1, and ILI1, indicating that brassinosteroid (BR) signal transduction was blocked. Fluorescence microscopy showed that OsSLA1 was localized to the plasma membrane and nearby periplasmic vesicles. Further study showed that OsSLA1 interacts with OsBRI1 and OsBAK1 via its intracellular domain and promotes the interaction between OsBRI1 and OsBAK1. In addition, phosphorylation experiments revealed that OsSLA1 does not possess kinase activity, but that it can be phosphorylated by OsBRI1 inâ€‰vitro. Knockout of OsSLA1 in the context of d61 caused exacerbation of the mutant phenotype. These results demonstrate that OsSLA1 regulates leaf angle formation via positive regulation of BR signaling by enhancing the interaction of OsBRI1 with OsBAK1.
