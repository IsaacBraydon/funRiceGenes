BU1|OsbHLH174	OsSLA1	OsSLA1 functions in leaf angle regulation by enhancing the interaction between OsBRI1 and OsBAK1 in rice.	 The OsSLA1 mutant plants were insensitive to exogenous epibrassinolide (eBL) and showed upregulated expression of DWARF and CPD, but downregulated expression of BU1, BUL1, and ILI1, indicating that brassinosteroid (BR) signal transduction was blocked
CPD|OsCPDP|qUVR-10	OsSLA1	OsSLA1 functions in leaf angle regulation by enhancing the interaction between OsBRI1 and OsBAK1 in rice.	 The OsSLA1 mutant plants were insensitive to exogenous epibrassinolide (eBL) and showed upregulated expression of DWARF and CPD, but downregulated expression of BU1, BUL1, and ILI1, indicating that brassinosteroid (BR) signal transduction was blocked
D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	OsSLA1	OsSLA1 functions in leaf angle regulation by enhancing the interaction between OsBRI1 and OsBAK1 in rice.	 Knockout of OsSLA1 in the context of d61 caused exacerbation of the mutant phenotype
D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	OsSLA1	OsSLA1 functions in leaf angle regulation by enhancing the interaction between OsBRI1 and OsBAK1 in rice.	OsSLA1 functions in leaf angle regulation by enhancing the interaction between OsBRI1 and OsBAK1 in rice.
D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	OsSLA1	OsSLA1 functions in leaf angle regulation by enhancing the interaction between OsBRI1 and OsBAK1 in rice.	 Further study showed that OsSLA1 interacts with OsBRI1 and OsBAK1 via its intracellular domain and promotes the interaction between OsBRI1 and OsBAK1
D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	OsSLA1	OsSLA1 functions in leaf angle regulation by enhancing the interaction between OsBRI1 and OsBAK1 in rice.	 In addition, phosphorylation experiments revealed that OsSLA1 does not possess kinase activity, but that it can be phosphorylated by OsBRI1 inâ€‰vitro
D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	OsSLA1	OsSLA1 functions in leaf angle regulation by enhancing the interaction between OsBRI1 and OsBAK1 in rice.	 These results demonstrate that OsSLA1 regulates leaf angle formation via positive regulation of BR signaling by enhancing the interaction of OsBRI1 with OsBAK1
ILI1	OsSLA1	OsSLA1 functions in leaf angle regulation by enhancing the interaction between OsBRI1 and OsBAK1 in rice.	 The OsSLA1 mutant plants were insensitive to exogenous epibrassinolide (eBL) and showed upregulated expression of DWARF and CPD, but downregulated expression of BU1, BUL1, and ILI1, indicating that brassinosteroid (BR) signal transduction was blocked
OsBISERK1|OsSERK1|OsBAK1|TBP1	OsSLA1	OsSLA1 functions in leaf angle regulation by enhancing the interaction between OsBRI1 and OsBAK1 in rice.	OsSLA1 functions in leaf angle regulation by enhancing the interaction between OsBRI1 and OsBAK1 in rice.
OsBISERK1|OsSERK1|OsBAK1|TBP1	OsSLA1	OsSLA1 functions in leaf angle regulation by enhancing the interaction between OsBRI1 and OsBAK1 in rice.	 Further study showed that OsSLA1 interacts with OsBRI1 and OsBAK1 via its intracellular domain and promotes the interaction between OsBRI1 and OsBAK1
