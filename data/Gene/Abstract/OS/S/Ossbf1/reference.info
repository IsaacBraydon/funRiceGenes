J. Exp. Bot.-2002-Rzewuski-1991-3.pdf	The novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene OsSbf1 encodes a putative member of the Na+/bile acid symporter family	2002	J Exp Bot	Institut f√ºr Allgemeine Botanik, Universit√§t Hamburg, Ohnhorststrasse 18, D‚Ä<U+393C><U+3E30>22609 Hamburg, Germany	PCR‚Äêbased differential screening was used to identify ethylene‚Äêinduced genes in deep‚Äêwater rice (Oryza sativa L.). One of the isolated cDNAs represented a novel protein, OsSBF1, with high homology to mammalian Na+/bile acid transporters and to sodium‚Äêdependent transporters from bacteria. One highly homologous protein and three less conserved homologues were identified in Arabidopsis thaliana indicating that Sbf proteins exist in monocot and dicot plant species. Expression of OsSbf1 in deep‚Äêwater rice was shown to be elevated by growth‚Äêinducing treatments. Since bile acids have not been found in plants to date a possible function of SBF proteins may be in the transport of structurally related sulphonated brassinosteroids.
