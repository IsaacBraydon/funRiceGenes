Ossbf1	transporter	The novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene OsSbf1 encodes a putative member of the Na+/bile acid symporter family	 One of the isolated cDNAs represented a novel protein, OsSBF1, with high homology to mammalian Na+/bile acid transporters and to sodium‐dependent transporters from bacteria
Ossbf1	growth	The novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene OsSbf1 encodes a putative member of the Na+/bile acid symporter family	 Expression of OsSbf1 in deep‐water rice was shown to be elevated by growth‐inducing treatments
