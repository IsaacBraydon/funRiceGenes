OsSPX-MFS1|OsPSS1	OsSPX-MFS3|OsPSS3	Functional characterization of the rice SPX-MFS family reveals a key role of OsSPX-MFS1 in controlling phosphate homeostasis in leaves	* Transcript analyses revealed that members of the SPX-MFS family were mainly expressed in the shoots, with OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS3 being suppressed by Pi deficiency, while OsSPX-MFS2 was induced
OsSPX-MFS1|OsPSS1	OsSPX-MFS3|OsPSS3	OsSPX-MFS3, a vacuolar phosphate efflux transporter, is involved in maintaining Pi homeostasis in rice.	OsSPX-MFS1, OsSPX-MFS2 and OsSPX-MFS3 all localized on the tonoplast of rice protoplasts, even in the absence of the SPX domain
OsSPX-MFS2	OsSPX-MFS3|OsPSS3	OsSPX-MFS3, a vacuolar phosphate efflux transporter, is involved in maintaining Pi homeostasis in rice.	OsSPX-MFS1, OsSPX-MFS2 and OsSPX-MFS3 all localized on the tonoplast of rice protoplasts, even in the absence of the SPX domain
OsSPX-MFS3|OsPSS3	OsSYP22	Phosphate-dependent regulation of vacuolar trafficking of OsSPX-MFSs is critical for maintaining intracellular phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 A yeast two-hybrid screen identified that two SNARE proteins, OsSYP21 and OsSYP22, interact with the MFS domain of OsSPX-MFS3
OsSPX-MFS3|OsPSS3	OsSYP22	Phosphate-dependent regulation of vacuolar trafficking of OsSPX-MFSs is critical for maintaining intracellular phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 Further genetic and cytological analyses indicate that OsSYP21 and OsSYP22 facilitate trafficking of OsSPX-MFS3 from PVCs to the tonoplast
OsSPX-MFS3|OsPSS3	OsSYP22	Phosphate-dependent regulation of vacuolar trafficking of OsSPX-MFSs is critical for maintaining intracellular phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 Although a homozygous frameshift mutation in OsSYP22 appeared to be lethal, tonoplast localization of OsSPX-MFS3 was significantly inhibited in transgenic plants expressing a negative-dominant form of OsSYP22 (OsSYP22-ND), resulting in reduced vacuolar Pi concentrations in OsSYP22-ND plants
OsSPX-MFS3|OsPSS3	OsSYP22	Phosphate-dependent regulation of vacuolar trafficking of OsSPX-MFSs is critical for maintaining intracellular phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 Under Pi-depleted conditions, the interaction between OsSYP22 and OsSPX-MFS3 was disrupted, and this process depended on the presence of the SPX domain
OsSPX-MFS3|OsPSS3	OsSYP21	Phosphate-dependent regulation of vacuolar trafficking of OsSPX-MFSs is critical for maintaining intracellular phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 A yeast two-hybrid screen identified that two SNARE proteins, OsSYP21 and OsSYP22, interact with the MFS domain of OsSPX-MFS3
OsSPX-MFS3|OsPSS3	OsSYP21	Phosphate-dependent regulation of vacuolar trafficking of OsSPX-MFSs is critical for maintaining intracellular phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 Further genetic and cytological analyses indicate that OsSYP21 and OsSYP22 facilitate trafficking of OsSPX-MFS3 from PVCs to the tonoplast
