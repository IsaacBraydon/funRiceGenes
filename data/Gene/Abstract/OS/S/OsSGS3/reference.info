A rice cDNA library was screened by a galactosidase 4 (Gal4)-based yeast two-hybrid system with Rice stripe virus (RSV) p2 as bait. The results revealed that RSV p2 interacted with a rice protein exhibiting a high degree of identity with Arabidopsis thaliana suppressor of gene silencing 3 (AtSGS3). The interaction was confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. SGS3 has been shown to be involved in sense transgene-induced RNA silencing and in the biogenesis of trans-acting small interfering RNAs (ta-siRNAs), possibly functioning as a cofactor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6). Given the intimate relationships between virus and RNA silencing, further experiments were conducted to show that p2 was a silencing suppressor. In addition, p2 enhanced the accumulation and pathogenicity of Potato virus X in Nicotiana benthamiana. Five genes that have been demonstrated to be targets of TAS3-derived ta-siRNAs were up-regulated in RSV-infected rice. The implications of these findings are discussed.
NA	The OsSGS3-tasiRNA-OsARF3 module orchestrates abiotic-biotic stress response trade-off in rice.	2023	Nat Commun	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 200032, Shanghai, China.	Recurrent heat stress and pathogen invasion seriously threaten crop production, and abiotic stress often antagonizes biotic stress response against pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms of trade-offs between thermotolerance and defense remain obscure. Here, we identify a rice thermo-sensitive mutant that displays a defect in floret development under high temperature with a mutation in SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3a (OsSGS3a). OsSGS3a interacts with its homolog OsSGS3b and modulates the biogenesis of trans-acting small interfering RNA (tasiRNA) targeting AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORS (ARFs). We find that OsSGS3a/b positively, while OsARF3a/b and OsARF3la/lb negatively modulate thermotolerance. Moreover, OsSGS3a negatively, while OsARF3a/b and OsARF3la/lb positively regulate disease resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae). Taken together, our study uncovers a previously unknown trade-off mechanism that regulates distinct immunity and thermotolerance through the OsSGS3-tasiRNA-OsARF3 module, highlighting the regulation of abiotic-biotic stress response trade-off in plants.
