OsSar1a	seed	Small GTPase Sar1 is crucial for proglutelin and alpha-globulin export from the endoplasmic reticulum in rice endosperm	 However, simultaneous knockdown of OsSar1a/b/c resulted in floury and shrunken seeds, with an increased level of glutelin precursor and decreased level of the mature alpha- and beta-subunit
OsSar1a	endosperm	Small GTPase Sar1 is crucial for proglutelin and alpha-globulin export from the endoplasmic reticulum in rice endosperm	 To reveal the route by which glutelin and alpha-globulin exit the ER, four putative Sar1 genes (OsSar1a/b/c/d) were cloned from rice, and transgenic rice were generated with Sar1 overexpressed or suppressed by RNA interference (RNAi) specifically in the endosperm under the control of the rice glutelin promoter
OsSar1a	endosperm	Small GTPase Sar1 is crucial for proglutelin and alpha-globulin export from the endoplasmic reticulum in rice endosperm	 OsSar1abc RNAi endosperm generated numerous, spherical, novel protein bodies with highly electron-dense matrixes containing both glutelin and alpha-globulin
OsSar1a	endosperm	Small GTPase Sar1 is crucial for proglutelin and alpha-globulin export from the endoplasmic reticulum in rice endosperm	 These results indicated that OsSar1a/b/c play a crucial role in storage proteins exiting from the ER, with functional redundancy in rice endosperm, and glutelin and alpha-globulin transported together from the ER to the Golgi apparatus by a pathway mediated by coat protein complex II
