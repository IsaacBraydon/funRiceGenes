A novel endonuclease, a new member of the RAD2 nuclease family, has been identified from the higher plant, rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare), and designated as OsSEND-1. The open reading frame of the OsSEND-1 cDNA encoded a predicted product of 641 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 69.9 kDa. The encoded protein showed a relatively high degree of sequence homology with the RAD2 nuclease family proteins, especially RAD2 nuclease, but it differed markedly from FEN-1, XPG or HEX1/EXO1. The N- and I-domains in the family were highly conserved in the OsSEND-1 sequence. The protein was much smaller than XPG, but larger than HEX1/EXO1 and FEN-1. The genome sequence was composed of 14 exons, and was localized at the almost terminal region of the short arm of chromosome 8. Northern blotting and in situ hybridization analyses demonstrated preferential expression of OsSEND-1 mRNA in proliferating tissues such as meristem. The mRNA level of OsSEND-1 was induced by UV and DNA-damaging agent such as MMS or H2O2, indicating that OsSEND-1 has some roles in the repair of many types of damaged DNA. The recombinant peptide showed endonuclease activity.
