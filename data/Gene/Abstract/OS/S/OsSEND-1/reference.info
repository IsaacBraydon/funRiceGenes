A novel endonuclease, a new member of the RAD2 nuclease family, has been identified from the higher plant, rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare), and designated as OsSEND-1. The open reading frame of the OsSEND-1 cDNA encoded a predicted product of 641 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 69.9 kDa. The encoded protein showed a relatively high degree of sequence homology with the RAD2 nuclease family proteins, especially RAD2 nuclease, but it differed markedly from FEN-1, XPG or HEX1/EXO1. The N- and I-domains in the family were highly conserved in the OsSEND-1 sequence. The protein was much smaller than XPG, but larger than HEX1/EXO1 and FEN-1. The genome sequence was composed of 14 exons, and was localized at the almost terminal region of the short arm of chromosome 8. Northern blotting and in situ hybridization analyses demonstrated preferential expression of OsSEND-1 mRNA in proliferating tissues such as meristem. The mRNA level of OsSEND-1 was induced by UV and DNA-damaging agent such as MMS or H2O2, indicating that OsSEND-1 has some roles in the repair of many types of damaged DNA. The recombinant peptide showed endonuclease activity.
NA	Resolvase OsGEN1 Mediates DNA Repair by Homologous Recombination.	2017	Plant Physiol	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic and Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University-University of Adelaide Joint Centre for Agriculture and Health, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 20040, China (C.W., Y.H., D.Z., W.L.).	Yen1/GEN1 are canonical Holliday junction resolvases that belong to the RAD2/XPG family. In eukaryotes, such as budding yeast, mice, worms, and humans, Yen1/GEN1 work together with Mus81-Mms4/MUS81-EME1 and Slx1-Slx4/SLX1-SLX4 in DNA repair by homologous recombination to maintain genome stability. In plants, the biological function of Yen1/GEN1 remains largely unclear. In this study, we characterized the loss of function mutants of OsGEN1 and OsSEND1, a pair of paralogs of Yen1/GEN1 in rice (Oryza sativa). We first investigated the role of OsGEN1 during meiosis and found a reduction in chiasma frequency by âˆ¼6% in osgen1 mutants, compared to the wild type, suggesting a possible involvement of OsGEN1 in the formation of crossovers. Postmeiosis, OsGEN1 foci were detected in wild-type microspore nuclei, but not in the osgen1 mutant concomitant with an increase in double-strand breaks. Persistent double-strand breaks led to programmed cell death of the male gametes and complete male sterility. In contrast, depletion of OsSEND1 had no effects on plant development and did not enhance osgen1 defects. Our results indicate that OsGEN1 is essential for homologous recombinational DNA repair at two stages of microsporogenesis in rice.
