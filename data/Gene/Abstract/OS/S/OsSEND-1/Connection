OsGEN-L|OsGEN1	OsSEND-1|OsSEND1	Resolvase OsGEN1 Mediates DNA Repair by Homologous Recombination.	 In this study, we characterized the loss of function mutants of OsGEN1 and OsSEND1, a pair of paralogs of Yen1/GEN1 in rice (Oryza sativa)
OsGEN-L|OsGEN1	OsSEND-1|OsSEND1	Resolvase OsGEN1 Mediates DNA Repair by Homologous Recombination.	 In contrast, depletion of OsSEND1 had no effects on plant development and did not enhance osgen1 defects
