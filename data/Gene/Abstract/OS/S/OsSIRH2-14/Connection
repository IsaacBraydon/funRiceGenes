Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) RING H2-type E3 ligase, OsSIRH2-14 (previously named OsRFPH2-14), which plays a positive role in salinity tolerance by regulating salt-related proteins including an HKT-type Na+ transporter (OsHKT2;1)

In vitro pull-down assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays revealed that OsSIRH2-14 interacts with salt-related proteins, including OsHKT2;1

OsSIRH2-14 E3 ligase regulates OsHKT2;1 via the 26S proteasome system under high NaCl concentrations but not under normal conditions
