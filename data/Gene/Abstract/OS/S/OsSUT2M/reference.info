The sugar transporters identified as being specific to the seed development may play a crucial role for flowering and grain development. The rice sucrose transporterOsSUT1 and the monosaccharide transportersOsMST1-3 have been previously characterized. To investigate sugar transport processes during flowering and in developing grains of rice, we newly isolated two genomic clonesOsSUT2(Oryzasativasucrosetransporter 2) andOsMST5(Oryzasativamonosaccharidetransporter 5) and their corresponding cDNAs.OsSUT2 andOsMST5are encoded by open reading frames of 1485 and 1557 bp encoding 495 and 519amino acids, respectively. The putative amino acid sequence ofOsSUT2showed 63.0 and 62.4 percnt; identity to that ofOsSUT1and barley transporterHvSUT1, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed thatOsSUT2andOsMST5mRNA accumulates in panicles before pollination.In situ hybridization analysis showed thatOsSUT2transcript is specific to the developing pollen. These data presented suggest that bothOsSUT2andOsMST5 play a role during the development at the early stage of the seed development. On the other handOsSUT1 was expressed at the early stage of the grain development, suggesting a different physiological role compared to Os SUT2.
109-ossut2.pdf	Impaired function of the tonoplast-localized sucrose transporter in rice, OsSUT2, limits the transport of vacuolar reserve sucrose and affects plant growth	2011	Plant Physiol	Graduate School of Biotechnology and Plant Metabolism Research Center, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 446-701, Korea.	Physiological functions of sucrose (Suc) transporters (SUTs) localized to the tonoplast in higher plants are poorly understood. We here report the isolation and characterization of a mutation in the rice (Oryza sativa) OsSUT2 gene. Expression of OsSUT2-green fluorescent protein in rice revealed that OsSUT2 localizes to the tonoplast. Analysis of the OsSUT2 promoter::beta-glucuronidase transgenic rice indicated that this gene is highly expressed in leaf mesophyll cells, emerging lateral roots, pedicels of fertilized spikelets, and cross cell layers of seed coats. Results of Suc transport assays in yeast were consistent with a H(+)-Suc symport mechanism, suggesting that OsSUT2 functions in Suc uptake from the vacuole. The ossut2 mutant exhibited a growth retardation phenotype with a significant reduction in tiller number, plant height, 1,000-grain weight, and root dry weight compared with the controls, the wild type, and complemented transgenic lines. Analysis of primary carbon metabolites revealed that ossut2 accumulated more Suc, glucose, and fructose in the leaves than the controls. Further sugar export analysis of detached leaves indicated that ossut2 had a significantly decreased sugar export ability compared with the controls. These results suggest that OsSUT2 is involved in Suc transport across the tonoplast from the vacuole lumen to the cytosol in rice, playing an essential role in sugar export from the source leaves to sink organs.
109.pdf	The rice pentatricopeptide repeat protein RF5 restores fertility in Hong-Lian cytoplasmic male-sterile lines via a complex with the glycine-rich protein GRP162	2012	Plant Cell	Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Plant Developmental Biology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China.	The cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) phenotype in plants can be reversed by the action of nuclear-encoded fertility restorer (Rf) genes. The molecular mechanism involved in Rf gene-mediated processing of CMS-associated transcripts is unclear, as are the identities of other proteins that may be involved in the CMS-Rf interaction. In this study, we cloned the restorer gene Rf5 for Hong-Lian CMS in rice and studied its fertility restoration mechanism with respect to the processing of the CMS-associated transcript atp6-orfH79. RF5, a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein, was unable to bind to this CMS-associated transcript; however, a partner protein of RF5 (GRP162, a Gly-rich protein encoding 162 amino acids) was identified to bind to atp6-orfH79. GRP162 was found to physically interact with RF5 and to bind to atp6-orfH79 via an RNA recognition motif. Furthermore, we found that RF5 and GRP162 are both components of a restoration of fertility complex (RFC) that is 400 to 500 kD in size and can cleave CMS-associated transcripts in vitro. Evidence that a PPR protein interacts directly with a Gly-rich protein to form a subunit of the RFC provides a new perspective on the molecular mechanisms underlying fertility restoration.
j.1744-7909.2007.00596.x.pdf	Cloning and expression analysis of rice sucrose transporter genes OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z	2008	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Two sucrose transporter (SUT) cDNAs, OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z, were isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sequencing results indicate they are 1,531 bp and 1,635 bp in length including complete open reading frame 1,506 bp and 1,608 bp, which encode 502 amino acids and 536 amino acids, respectively. The TopPred program suggested that both sucrose transporter proteins, OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z, consist of potentially 12 transmembrane domains. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out to investigate the gene expression patterns of OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z. In vegetative organs, transcripts of OsSUT2M were higher in source leaf blades than in other organs at the same development stage, whereas transcripts of OsSUT5Z were less traceable in all organs investigated. In reproductive organs, both transcripts of these two genes were high in panicles from the booting stage to 7 days after flowering (DAF) and then sharply declined. The potential physiology functions of these two sucrose transporters are discussed.
Plant Cell Physiol-2003-Aoki-223-32.pdf	The sucrose transporter gene family in rice	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	CSIRO Plant Industry, Canberra, ACT, 2601 Australia.	In this paper we report the identification, cloning and expression analysis of four putative sucrose transporter (SUT) genes from rice, designated OsSUT2, 3, 4 and 5. Three of the four genes were identified through extensive searches of the recently published draft sequence of the rice genome. Along with the previously reported OsSUT1 we propose that these five genes comprise the rice SUT gene family. Complementary DNA clones were isolated for the four newly identified genes. The deduced proteins of all five SUT genes were predicted to contain 12 membrane-spanning helices and a domain highly conserved throughout all known plant SUTs, suggesting the four additional OsSUT genes encode functional SUTs. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis was performed in order to investigate the expression pattern of each member of the SUT family in rice. A differing but overlapping expression pattern was observed for each member of the SUT family at different stages through plant development. These results, together with the structural variations apparent from the deduced protein sequences, suggest that the five SUTs possess diverse roles in both sink and source tissues. We also discuss the classification and evolution of the rice SUT gene family, using a comparison of the gene structures and deduced amino acid sequences with other known plant SUT genes.
