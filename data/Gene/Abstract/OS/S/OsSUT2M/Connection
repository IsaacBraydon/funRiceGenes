OsMST5	OsSUT2|OsSUT2M	Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice	 To investigate sugar transport processes during flowering and in developing grains of rice, we newly isolated two genomic clonesOsSUT2(Oryzasativasucrosetransporter 2) andOsMST5(Oryzasativamonosaccharidetransporter 5) and their corresponding cDNAs|OsSUT2 andOsMST5are encoded by open reading frames of 1485 and 1557 bp encoding 495 and 519amino acids, respectively| Northern blot analysis revealed thatOsSUT2andOsMST5mRNA accumulates in panicles before pollination| These data presented suggest that bothOsSUT2andOsMST5 play a role during the development at the early stage of the seed development
OsSUT1	OsSUT2|OsSUT2M	Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice	 On the other handOsSUT1 was expressed at the early stage of the grain development, suggesting a different physiological role compared to Os SUT2
OsSUT2|OsSUT2M	OsSUT5|OsSUT5Z	Cloning and expression analysis of rice sucrose transporter genes OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z	Two sucrose transporter (SUT) cDNAs, OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z, were isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L| The TopPred program suggested that both sucrose transporter proteins, OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z, consist of potentially 12 transmembrane domains| Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out to investigate the gene expression patterns of OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z| In vegetative organs, transcripts of OsSUT2M were higher in source leaf blades than in other organs at the same development stage, whereas transcripts of OsSUT5Z were less traceable in all organs investigated|Cloning and expression analysis of rice sucrose transporter genes OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z
