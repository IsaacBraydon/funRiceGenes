Chromatin remodeling ATPases OsSYD and OsBRM are involved in shoot establishment, and both affect OSH gene transcription. OsSYD protein interacts with RFL, but OsBRM does not. In plants, SPLAYED (SYD) and BRAHMA (BRM) encode chromatin remodeling ATPases that use the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to restructure nucleosomes and render certain genomic regions available to transcription factors. However, the function of SYD and BRM on rice growth and development is unknown. Here, we constructed ossyd and osbrm mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and analyzed the effects of mutations on rice embryo development. We discovered that the ossyd and osbrm mutants exhibited severe defects during embryonic development, whereas endosperm development was normal. These results indicated that the development of the embryo and endosperm is independent of each and osbrm-null mutants did not germinate due to and osbrm-null mutants, and they indeed had distinct differentiation defects in shoot establishment, acquired during embryogenesis. To verify the function of OsSYD and OsBRM in embryogenesis, we measured the transcript levels of marker genes at different stages. Compared with wild type, the expression levels of multiple OSH genes were significantly reduced in the mutants, which was consistent with the defective shoot establishment phenotypes. The interaction between SYD and RICE FLORICAULA/LFY (RFL) was revealed using a yeast two-hybrid screening system, suggesting that the interaction between the LFY homolog and chromatin remodeling ATPases is ubiquitous in plants. Collectively, our findings provide the basis for elucidating the function of OsSYD and OsBRM during embryo development in rice.
