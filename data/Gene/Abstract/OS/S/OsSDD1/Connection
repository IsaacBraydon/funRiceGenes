OsSDD1	REL2|OsDLT10|RSD1	RSD1 Is Essential for Stomatal Patterning and Files in Rice.	 It was found that the deletion of RSD1 would lead to the disorder of gene expression regarding stomatal development, especially the expression of stomatal density and distribution 1 (OsSDD1)
OsSDD1	REL2|OsDLT10|RSD1	RSD1 Is Essential for Stomatal Patterning and Files in Rice.	 Through the construction of OsSDD1 deletion mutants by CRISPR-Cas9, we found that, similar to rsd1 mutants, the ossdd1 mutants have clustered stomata and extra small cells adjacent to the stomata
OsSDD1	REL2|OsDLT10|RSD1	RSD1 Is Essential for Stomatal Patterning and Files in Rice.	 OsSDD1 and RSD1 are both required for inhibiting ectopic asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) and clustered stomata
OsSDD1	REL2|OsDLT10|RSD1	RSD1 Is Essential for Stomatal Patterning and Files in Rice.	 This study characterized the functions of RSD1 and OsSDD1 in rice stomatal development
