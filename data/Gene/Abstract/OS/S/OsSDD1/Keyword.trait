OsSDD1	development	RSD1 Is Essential for Stomatal Patterning and Files in Rice.	 This study characterized the functions of RSD1 and OsSDD1 in rice stomatal development
OsSDD1	cell division	RSD1 Is Essential for Stomatal Patterning and Files in Rice.	 OsSDD1 and RSD1 are both required for inhibiting ectopic asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) and clustered stomata
OsSDD1	stomatal	RSD1 Is Essential for Stomatal Patterning and Files in Rice.	 This study characterized the functions of RSD1 and OsSDD1 in rice stomatal development
OsSDD1	stomata	RSD1 Is Essential for Stomatal Patterning and Files in Rice.	 Through the construction of OsSDD1 deletion mutants by CRISPR-Cas9, we found that, similar to rsd1 mutants, the ossdd1 mutants have clustered stomata and extra small cells adjacent to the stomata
OsSDD1	stomata	RSD1 Is Essential for Stomatal Patterning and Files in Rice.	 OsSDD1 and RSD1 are both required for inhibiting ectopic asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) and clustered stomata
OsSDD1	stomatal development	RSD1 Is Essential for Stomatal Patterning and Files in Rice.	 This study characterized the functions of RSD1 and OsSDD1 in rice stomatal development
