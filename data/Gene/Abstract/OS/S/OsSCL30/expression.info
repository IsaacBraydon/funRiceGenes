OsSCL30	OsSCL30 overexpression reduces the tolerance of rice seedlings to low temperature, drought and salt. |  In this study, by constructing overexpression vectors D-163 + 1300:OsSCL30 and D-163 + 1300-AcGFP:OsSCL30-GFP, the mechanism of action of OsSCL30 in various abiotic stresses was explored |  Under normal conditions, the expression of OsSCL30 was higher in leaves and leaf sheaths |  The results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression of OsSCL30 decreased after low temperature, drought and salt treatment |  The results of the rice seedling tolerance and recovery tests showed that overexpression of OsSCL30 diminished the resistance to low temperature, drought and salt stresses in transgenic rice and resulted in larger accumulation of reactive oxygen species	OsSCL30 overexpression reduces the tolerance of rice seedlings to low temperature, drought and salt. |  In this study, by constructing overexpression vectors D-163 + 1300:OsSCL30 and D-163 + 1300-AcGFP:OsSCL30-GFP, the mechanism of action of OsSCL30 in various abiotic stresses was explored |  The results of the rice seedling tolerance and recovery tests showed that overexpression of OsSCL30 diminished the resistance to low temperature, drought and salt stresses in transgenic rice and resulted in larger accumulation of reactive oxygen species
