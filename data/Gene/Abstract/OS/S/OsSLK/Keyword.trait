OsSLK	root	The F-box protein SHORT PRIMARY ROOT modulates primary root meristem activity by targeting SEUSS-LIKE protein for degradation in rice.	 Collectively, our study establishes SHPR as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets OsSLK for degradation, and uncovers a protein ubiquitination pathway as a mechanism for modulating root meristem activity in rice
OsSLK	nucleus	The F-box protein SHORT PRIMARY ROOT modulates primary root meristem activity by targeting SEUSS-LIKE protein for degradation in rice.	 We show that SHPR interacts with Oryza sativa SEUSS-LIKE (OsSLK) in the nucleus and is required for OsSLK polyubiquitination and degradation by the ubiquitin 26S-proteasome system (UPS)
OsSLK	meristem	The F-box protein SHORT PRIMARY ROOT modulates primary root meristem activity by targeting SEUSS-LIKE protein for degradation in rice.	 Collectively, our study establishes SHPR as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets OsSLK for degradation, and uncovers a protein ubiquitination pathway as a mechanism for modulating root meristem activity in rice
OsSLK	Ubiquitin	The F-box protein SHORT PRIMARY ROOT modulates primary root meristem activity by targeting SEUSS-LIKE protein for degradation in rice.	 We show that SHPR interacts with Oryza sativa SEUSS-LIKE (OsSLK) in the nucleus and is required for OsSLK polyubiquitination and degradation by the ubiquitin 26S-proteasome system (UPS)
OsSLK	Ubiquitin	The F-box protein SHORT PRIMARY ROOT modulates primary root meristem activity by targeting SEUSS-LIKE protein for degradation in rice.	 Collectively, our study establishes SHPR as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets OsSLK for degradation, and uncovers a protein ubiquitination pathway as a mechanism for modulating root meristem activity in rice
OsSLK	root meristem	The F-box protein SHORT PRIMARY ROOT modulates primary root meristem activity by targeting SEUSS-LIKE protein for degradation in rice.
