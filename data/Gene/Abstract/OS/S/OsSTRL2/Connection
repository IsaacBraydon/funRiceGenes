OsSTRL2	STR1	An atypical strictosidine synthase, OsSTRL2, plays key roles in anther development and pollen wall formation in rice.	 Comparative protein sequence analysis indicated that OsSTRL2 lacked the key catalytic residue found in a typical STR (STR1), although it possessed conserved β-propellers and α-helices formed the basic structure of STR1
