NA	An atypical strictosidine synthase, OsSTRL2, plays key roles in anther development and pollen wall formation in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, 611130, China.	Strictosidine synthase (STR) plays an important role in the biosynthesis of terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) and is expressed in a range of active meristematic tissues of higher plants. STR proteins are involved in different physiological and biochemical pathways. However, the function of STR proteins in rice development remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified 21 possible STR-like (OsSTRL) family members in rice genome and found that only one gene, OsSTRL2, exhibited a pre-emergency specific florescence expression pattern. Tissue-specific expression profile analysis, β-glucuronidase histochemical (GUS) staining and RNA in situ hybridization confirmed that OsSTRL2 was highly expressed in tapetal cells and microspores. Comparative protein sequence analysis indicated that OsSTRL2 lacked the key catalytic residue found in a typical STR (STR1), although it possessed conserved β-propellers and α-helices formed the basic structure of STR1. OsSTRL2 knockout mutant resulted to male sterility because of the defects in anther development and pollen wall formation. Subcellular localization of OsSTRL2-YFP revealed that the OsSTRL2 protein was primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Therefore, OsSTRL2 is an atypical strictosidine synthase that plays crucial roles in regulating anther development and pollen wall formation in rice.
NA	Gene Expression Dynamics in Rice Peduncles at the Heading Stage	2020	Front Genet	Grass Genetics and Informatics Group, School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.	Improving grain yield in the staple food crop rice has been long sought goal of plant biotechnology. One of the traits with significant impact on rice breeding programs is peduncle elongation at the time of heading failing which leads to significant reduction in grain yield due to incomplete panicle exsertion. To decipher transcriptional dynamics and molecular players underlying peduncle elongation, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of elongating and non-elongating peduncles in two Indian cultivars, Swarna and Pokkali, at the time of heading. Along with genes associated with cell division and cell wall biosynthesis, we observed significant enrichment of genes associated with auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis/signaling in the elongating peduncles before heading in both the genotypes. Similarly, genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and mobilization, abiotic stress response along with cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene biosynthesis/signaling were enriched in non-elongating peduncles post heading. Significant enrichment of genes belonging to key transcription factor families highlights their specialized roles in peduncle elongation and grain filling before and after heading, respectively. A comparison with anther/pollen development-related genes provided 76 candidates with overlapping roles in anther/pollen development and peduncle elongation. Some of these are important for carbohydrate remobilization to the developing grains. These can be engineered to combat with incomplete panicle exsertion in male sterile lines and manipulate carbohydrate dynamics in grasses. Overall, this study provides baseline information about potential target genes for engineering peduncle elongation with implications on plant height, biomass composition and grain yields in rice.
NA	Reinvestigation of THOUSAND-GRAIN WEIGHT 6 grain weight genes in wheat and rice indicates a role in pollen development rather than regulation of auxin content in grains	2021	Theor Appl Genet	School of Science and Technology, University of New England, Armidale, NSW, 2351, Australia.	Phylogenetic and expression analyses of grain weight genes TaTGW6 and OsTGW6 and investigation of substrate availability indicate TGW6 does not regulate auxin content of grains but may affect pollen development. The THOUSAND-GRAIN WEIGHT 6 genes (TaTGW6 and OsTGW6) are reported to result in larger grains of wheat and rice by reducing production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in developing grains. However, a critical comparison of data on TaTGW6 and OsTGW6 with other reports on IAA synthesis in cereal grains requires that this hypothesis be reinvestigated. Here, we show that TaTGW6 and OsTGW6 are members of a large gene family that has undergone major, lineage-specific gene expansion. Wheat has nine genes, and rice three genes encoding proteins with more than 80% amino acid identity with TGW6, making it difficult to envisage how a single inactive allele could have a major effect on IAA levels in grains. In our study, we show that neither TaTGW6 nor OsTGW6 is expressed in developing grains. Instead, both genes and their close homologues are exclusively expressed in pre-emergent inflorescences; TaTGW6 is expressed particularly in microspores prior to mitosis. This evidence, combined with our observation that developing wheat grains have undetectable levels of ester IAA in comparison to free IAA and do not express an IAA-glucose synthase suggests that TaTGW6 and OsTGW6 do not regulate grain size via the hydrolysis of IAA-glucose. Instead, their similarity to rice strictosidine synthase-like (OsSTRL2) suggests they play a key role in pollen development.
