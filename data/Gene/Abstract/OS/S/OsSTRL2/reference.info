NA	An atypical strictosidine synthase, OsSTRL2, plays key roles in anther development and pollen wall formation in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, 611130, China.	Strictosidine synthase (STR) plays an important role in the biosynthesis of terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) and is expressed in a range of active meristematic tissues of higher plants. STR proteins are involved in different physiological and biochemical pathways. However, the function of STR proteins in rice development remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified 21 possible STR-like (OsSTRL) family members in rice genome and found that only one gene, OsSTRL2, exhibited a pre-emergency specific florescence expression pattern. Tissue-specific expression profile analysis, β-glucuronidase histochemical (GUS) staining and RNA in situ hybridization confirmed that OsSTRL2 was highly expressed in tapetal cells and microspores. Comparative protein sequence analysis indicated that OsSTRL2 lacked the key catalytic residue found in a typical STR (STR1), although it possessed conserved β-propellers and α-helices formed the basic structure of STR1. OsSTRL2 knockout mutant resulted to male sterility because of the defects in anther development and pollen wall formation. Subcellular localization of OsSTRL2-YFP revealed that the OsSTRL2 protein was primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Therefore, OsSTRL2 is an atypical strictosidine synthase that plays crucial roles in regulating anther development and pollen wall formation in rice.
