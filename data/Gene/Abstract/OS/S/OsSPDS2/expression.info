OsSPDS2|OsSPMS1	 We generated several homozygous RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression (OE) lines of OsSPMS1	 We generated several homozygous RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression (OE) lines of OsSPMS1	 We generated several homozygous RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression (OE) lines of OsSPMS1 |  The ratio of Spm to Spd was significantly lower in the RNAi lines and considerably higher in the OE lines than in the wild-type (WT), suggesting that OsSPMS1 may function as a spermine synthase
