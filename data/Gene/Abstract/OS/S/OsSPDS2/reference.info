A cDNA for a putative 42 kD spermidine synthase (OsSPDS2) was cloned from rice. The deduced OsSPDS2 sequence showed highest similarity with Arabidopsis AtSPDS3. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that OsSPDS2 and AtSPDS3 form a distinctive subclass in the spermidine synthase family in plants. OsSPDS2 mRNA accumulated in roots during long term exposure to chilling temperature (12 degrees C). In contrast, no such induction of the paralogous OsSPDS1 was observed during the chilling treatment. ABA treatment up-regulated OsSPDS2, whereas salt stress did not change OsSPDS2 levels significantly. Data suggested a distinct function of OsSPDS2 in chilling response in rice.
NA	The Spermine Synthase OsSPMS1 Regulates Seed Germination, Grain Size, and Yield.	2018	Plant Physiol	Yangzhou University CITY: Yangzhou STATE: Jiangsu China [CN].	Polyamines, including putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd), and spermine (Spm), play essential roles in a wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Rice (Oryza sativa) contains four putative spermidine/spermine synthase (SPMS)-encoding genes (OsSPMS1, OsSPMS2, OsSPMS3, and OsACAULIS5), but none have been functionally characterized. In this study, we used a reverse genetic strategy to investigate the biological function of OsSPMS1. We generated several homozygous RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression (OE) lines of OsSPMS1. Phenotypic analysis indicated that OsSPMS1 negatively regulates seed germination, grain size, and grain yield per plant. The ratio of Spm to Spd was significantly lower in the RNAi lines and considerably higher in the OE lines than in the wild-type (WT), suggesting that OsSPMS1 may function as a spermine synthase. S-adenosyl-L-methionine is a common precursor of polyamines and ethylene biosynthesis. The 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and ethylene contents in seeds significantly increased in RNAi lines and decreased in OE lines, respectively, compared with wild-type. Additionally, the reduced germination rates and growth defects of OE lines could be rescued with ACC treatment. These data suggest that OsSPMS1 affects ethylene synthesis and may regulate seed germination and plant growth by affecting the ACC and ethylene pathways. Most importantly, an OsSPMS1 knockout mutant showed an increase in grain yield per plant in a high-yield variety, Suken118, suggesting that OsSPMS1 is an important target for yield enhancement in rice.
