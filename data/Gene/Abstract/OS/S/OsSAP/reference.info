We identified rice genes that might be involved in drought stress tolerance by virtue of their anti-apoptotic activity. Potential anti-apoptosis related genes were identified by screening an Oryza sativa cDNA library derived from drought stressed tissues in a yeast functional assay. About 28 O. sativa cDNAs promoted yeast survival following engagement of Bax-induced apoptosis. An O. sativa cDNA encoding R12H780 was a highly conserved putative senescence-associated-protein (OsSAP). OsSAP was both highly and rapidly expressed in response to drought stress. Additionally, OsSAP was found to be localized to the mitochondria. Overall, OsSAP represents a new type of Bax suppressor related gene and endows multiple stress tolerance in yeast.
