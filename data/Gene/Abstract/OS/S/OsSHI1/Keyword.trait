OsSHI1	transcription factor	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.	 Map-based cloning revealed that OsSHI1 encodes a plant-specific transcription factor of the SHORT INTERNODES (SHI) family with a characteristic family-specific IGGH domain and a conserved zinc-finger DNA binding domain
OsSHI1	panicle	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.	 OsSHI1 is predominantly expressed in axillary buds and young panicle
OsSHI1	panicle	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.	 Further, OsSHI1 represses the transcriptional activation activity of IPA1 by affecting its DNA binding activity towards the promoters of both OsTB1 and OsDEP1, resulting in increased tiller number and diminished panicle size
OsSHI1	tiller	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.	 Further, OsSHI1 represses the transcriptional activation activity of IPA1 by affecting its DNA binding activity towards the promoters of both OsTB1 and OsDEP1, resulting in increased tiller number and diminished panicle size

OsSHI1	architecture	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.
OsSHI1	architecture	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.	 Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsSHI1 regulates plant architecture through modulating the transcriptional activity of IPA1 and provide novel insight into the establishment of plant architecture in rice
OsSHI1	panicle size	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.	 Further, OsSHI1 represses the transcriptional activation activity of IPA1 by affecting its DNA binding activity towards the promoters of both OsTB1 and OsDEP1, resulting in increased tiller number and diminished panicle size
OsSHI1	tiller number	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.	 Further, OsSHI1 represses the transcriptional activation activity of IPA1 by affecting its DNA binding activity towards the promoters of both OsTB1 and OsDEP1, resulting in increased tiller number and diminished panicle size
