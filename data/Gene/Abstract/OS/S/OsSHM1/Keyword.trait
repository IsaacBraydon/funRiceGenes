OsSHM1|OsSHMT1	growth	Characterization and molecular cloning of a serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (OsSHM1) in rice.	 The osshm1 mutant had chlorotic lesions and a considerably smaller, lethal phenotype under natural ambient CO2 concentrations, but could be restored to wild type with normal growth under elevated CO2 levels (0
OsSHM1|OsSHMT1	mitochondria	Characterization and molecular cloning of a serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (OsSHM1) in rice.	 OsSHM1 protein is localized to the mitochondria
OsSHM1|OsSHMT1	oxidative stress	Characterization and molecular cloning of a serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (OsSHM1) in rice.	 The data from antioxidant enzymes activity measurement suggested that osshm1 was subjected to significant oxidative stress
OsSHM1|OsSHMT1	oxidative	Characterization and molecular cloning of a serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (OsSHM1) in rice.	 The data from antioxidant enzymes activity measurement suggested that osshm1 was subjected to significant oxidative stress
OsSHM1|OsSHMT1	stress	Characterization and molecular cloning of a serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (OsSHM1) in rice.	 The data from antioxidant enzymes activity measurement suggested that osshm1 was subjected to significant oxidative stress
