NA	Stable mitotic inheritance of rice minichromosomes in cell suspension cultures.	2015	Plant Cell Rep	School of Life Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, New Territories, Hong Kong.	Suspension cell cultures of rice minichromosomes were established. The minichromosomes in suspension cultured cells were mitotically stable and had active gene expression, thus have the potential to be used as gene expression vectors to produce valuable bioactive products. The plant artificial chromosome (PAC) is a novel vector for plant genetic engineering to produce genetically modified crops with multiple transgenes, or to produce valuable bioactive products through the expression of multiple genes or biochemical pathways as a bioreactor. PAC is mainly constructed by engineered minichromosomes through telomere-mediated chromosome truncations. We have constructed rice minichromosomes in a previous study. Thus, the understanding of rice minichromosome inheritance under different culture conditions has potential importance for their utility in future studies and applications. In this study, we performed suspension cultures of three rice minichromosome-containing cell lines, 1004-111, 1008-100 and 1004-011. Two cell lines, 1004-111 and 1008-100, showed typical S growth pattern consisting of a lag phase, an active growing exponential phase and a stationary phase, whereas cell line 1004-011 grew very slowly and eventually died. Both 1004-111 and 1008-100 minichromosomes were stably transmitted in cell suspension cultures without any abnormality. Foreign gene expression was verified from 1004-111 and 1008-100 minichromosomes in suspension cultures. The stable mitotic inheritance of minichromosomes and gene expression from them indicated that rice minichromosomes could be maintained and propagated in cell suspension cultures. This study tested key parameters for suspension cultures of rice cell lines with minichromosomes, and proved in concept the potential for industrial use of PAC vectors as bioreactors.
NA	The molecular cloning and clarification of a photorespiratory mutant, oscdm1, using enhancer trapping.	2015	Front Genet	Biotechnology Research Institute/National Key Facility for Genetic Resources and Gene Improvement, The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Beijing, China.	Enhancer trap systems have been demonstrated to increase the effectiveness of gene identification in rice. In this study, a chlorophyll-deficient mutant, named oscdm1, was screened and characterized in detail from a T-DNA enhancer-tagged population. The oscdm1 plants were different from other chlorophyll-deficient mutants; they produced chlorotic leaves at the third leaf stage, which gradually died with further growth of the plants. However, the oscdm1 plants were able to survive exposure to elevated CO2 levels, similar to photorespiratory mutants. An analysis of the T-DNA flanking sequence in the oscdm1 plants showed that the T-DNA was inserted into the promoter region of a serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) gene. OsSHMT1 is a key enzyme that is ubiquitous in nature and structurally conserved across kingdoms. The enzyme is responsible for the interconversion of serine and glycine and is essential for cellular one-carbon metabolism. Full-length OsSHMT1 complemented the oscdm1 phenotype, and the downregulation of OsSHMT1 in wild-type plants by RNA interference (RNAi) produced plants that mimicked the oscdm1 phenotype. GUS assays and quantitative PCR revealed the preferential expression of OsSHMT1 in young leaves. TEM revealed serious damage to the thylakoid membrane in oscdm1 chloroplasts. The oscdm1 plants showed more extensive damage than wild type using an IMAGING-PAM fluorometer, especially under high light intensities. OsSHMT1-GFP localized exclusively to mitochondria. Further analysis revealed that the H2O2 content in the oscdm1 plants was twice that in wild type at the fourth leaf stage. This suggests that the thylakoid membrane damage observed in the oscdm1 plants was caused by excessive H2O2. Interestingly, OsSHMT1-overexpressing plants exhibited increased photosynthetic efficiency and improved plant productivity. These results lay the foundation for further study of the OsSHMT1 gene and will help illuminate the functional role of OsSHMT1 in photorespiration in rice.
