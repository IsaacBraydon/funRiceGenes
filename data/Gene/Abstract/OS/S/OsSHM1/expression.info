OsSHM1|OsSHMT1	 GUS assays and quantitative PCR revealed the preferential expression of OsSHMT1 in young leaves	 Full-length OsSHMT1 complemented the oscdm1 phenotype, and the downregulation of OsSHMT1 in wild-type plants by RNA interference (RNAi) produced plants that mimicked the oscdm1 phenotype
