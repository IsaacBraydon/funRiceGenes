NA	OsSPL10, a SBP-Box Gene, Plays a Dual Role in Salt Tolerance and Trichome Formation in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2019	G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics	Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University	Salinity is one of the major abiotic stress factors limiting rice production. Glabrousness is a trait of agronomic importance in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We previously found a single-gene recessive mutant sst, which displayed increased salt tolerance and glabrous leaf and glume without trichomes, and identified an SBP-box gene OsSPL10 as the candidate of the SST gene. In this study, OsSPL10-knockout and OsSPL10-overexpression mutants were created to check the function of the gene. The knockout mutants exhibited enhanced salt tolerance and  glabrous leaves and glumes as expected, while the overexpression mutants showed opposite phenotypes, in which both salt sensitivity and trichome density on leaf  and glume were increased. These results clearly confirmed that OsSPL10 is SST, and suggested that OsSPL10 controls the initiation rather than the elongation of  trichomes. In addition, expression analysis indicated that OsSPL10 was preferentially expressed in young panicle and stem, and protein OsSPL10 was localized in nucleus. Taken together, OsSPL10 negatively controls salt tolerance  but positively controls trichome formation in rice.
NA	MiR529a controls plant height, tiller number, panicle architecture and grain size by regulating SPL target genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2021	Plant Sci	Institute of Crop Science, Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Crop Germplasm, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world. Breeding high-yield, multi-resistant and high-quality varieties has always been the goal of rice breeding. Rice tiller, panicle architecture and grain size are the constituent factors of yield, which are regulated by both genetic and environmental factors, including miRNAs, transcription factors, and downstream target genes. Previous studies have shown that SPL (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING-LIKE) transcription factors can control rice tiller, panicle architecture and grain size, which were regulated by miR156, miR529 and miR535. In this study, we obtained miR529a target mimicry (miR529a-MIMIC) transgenic plants to investigate plant phenotypes, physiological and molecular characteristics together with miR529a overexpression (miR529a-OE) and wild type (WT) to explore the function of miR529a and its SPL target genes in rice. We found that OsSPL2, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18 at seedling stage were regulated by miR529a, but there had complicated mechanism to control plant height. OsSPL2, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and SPL18 at tillering stage were regulated by miR529a to control plant height and tiller number. And panicle architecture and grain size were controlled by miR529a through altering the expression of all five target genes OsSPL2, OsSPL7, OsSPL14, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18. Our study suggested that miR529a might control rice growth and development by regulating different SPL target genes at different stages, which could provide a new method to improve rice yield by regulating miR529a and its SPL target genes.
