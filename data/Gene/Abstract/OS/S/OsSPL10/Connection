GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	OsSPL10	Rice SPL10 positively regulates trichome development through expression of HL6 and auxin-related genes	 Tests of allelism in 51 glabrous rice (Oryza sativa) accessions collected worldwide identified OsSPL10 and OsWOX3B as regulators of trichome development in rice
HL6|OsGL6	OsSPL10	Rice SPL10 positively regulates trichome development through expression of HL6 and auxin-related genes	 HAIRY LEAF6 (HL6) encodes another transcription factor that regulates trichome initiation and elongation, and OsSPL10 directly binds to the HL6 promoter to regulate its expression
OsSPL10	OsYUCCA5	Rice SPL10 positively regulates trichome development through expression of HL6 and auxin-related genes	 Moreover, the transcript levels of auxin-related genes, such as OsYUCCA5 and OsPIN-FORMED1b, were altered in OsSPL10 overexpression and RNAi transgenic lines
