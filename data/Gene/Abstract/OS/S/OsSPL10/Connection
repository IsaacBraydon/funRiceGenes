GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	OsSPL10	Rice SPL10 positively regulates trichome development through expression of HL6 and auxin-related genes	 Tests of allelism in 51 glabrous rice (Oryza sativa) accessions collected worldwide identified OsSPL10 and OsWOX3B as regulators of trichome development in rice
HL6|OsGL6	OsSPL10	Rice SPL10 positively regulates trichome development through expression of HL6 and auxin-related genes	 HAIRY LEAF6 (HL6) encodes another transcription factor that regulates trichome initiation and elongation, and OsSPL10 directly binds to the HL6 promoter to regulate its expression
OsSPL10	OsYUCCA5	Rice SPL10 positively regulates trichome development through expression of HL6 and auxin-related genes	 Moreover, the transcript levels of auxin-related genes, such as OsYUCCA5 and OsPIN-FORMED1b, were altered in OsSPL10 overexpression and RNAi transgenic lines

COX11|OsCOX11	OsSPL10	Variations in OsSPL10 confer drought tolerance by directly regulating OsNAC2 expression and ROS production in rice.	 Importantly, we demonstrated that the varieties with the OsSPL10 (Hap1) allele show low expression levels of OsSPL10 and its downstream gene, OsNAC2, which decreases the expression of OsAP37 and increases the expression of OsCOX11, thus preventing ROS accumulation and PCD
OsAP37	OsSPL10	Variations in OsSPL10 confer drought tolerance by directly regulating OsNAC2 expression and ROS production in rice.	 Importantly, we demonstrated that the varieties with the OsSPL10 (Hap1) allele show low expression levels of OsSPL10 and its downstream gene, OsNAC2, which decreases the expression of OsAP37 and increases the expression of OsCOX11, thus preventing ROS accumulation and PCD
OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsSPL10	Variations in OsSPL10 confer drought tolerance by directly regulating OsNAC2 expression and ROS production in rice.	Variations in OsSPL10 confer drought tolerance by directly regulating OsNAC2 expression and ROS production in rice.

OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsSPL10	Variations in OsSPL10 confer drought tolerance by directly regulating OsNAC2 expression and ROS production in rice.	 Based on these observations, we propose that OsSPL10 confers drought tolerance by regulating OsNAC2 expression and that OsSPL10 (Hap1) could be a valuable haplotype for genetic improvement of drought tolerance in rice
