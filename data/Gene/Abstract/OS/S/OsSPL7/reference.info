NA	Modulation of plant architecture by the miR156f-OsSPL7-OsGH3.8 pathway in rice.	2018	J Exp Bot	Key Laboratory of Insect Developmental and Evolutionary Biology, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.	Tiller number and plant height are two of the main features of plant architecture that directly influence rice yield. Auxin and miR156, an extensively studied smRNA, are both broadly involved in plant development and physiology, suggesting a possible relationship between the two. In this study, we identified a rice T-DNA insertion cluster and dwarf (cd) mutant that has an increased tiller number and reduced plant height. The T-DNA insertion was in close proximity to the miR156f gene and was associated with its up-regulation. Plants over-expressing miR156f resembled the cd mutant. In contrast, plants over-expression a miR156f target mimic (MIM156fOE) had a reduced tiller number and increased height. Genetic analysis showed that OsSPL7 is a target of miR156f that regulates plant architecture. Plants over-expressing OsSPL7 had a reduced tiller number, while OsSPL7 RNAi plants had an increased tiller number and a reduced height. We also found that OsSPL7 binds directly to the OsGH3.8 promoter to regulate its transcription. Overexpression of OsGH3.8 and OsGH3.8 RNAi partially complemented the MIM156fOE and cd mutant phenotypes, respectively. Our combined data show that the miR156f-OsSPL7-OsGH3.8 pathway regulates tiller number and plant height in rice, and this pathway may allow crosstalk between miR156 and auxin.
NA	Inducible overexpression of Ideal Plant Architecture1 improves both yield and disease resistance in rice.	2019	Nat Plants	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Breeding crops with resistance is an efficient way to control diseases. However, increased resistance often has a fitness penalty. Thus, simultaneously increasing disease resistance and yield potential is a challenge in crop breeding. In this study, we found that downregulation of microRNA-156 (miR-156) and overexpression of Ideal Plant Architecture1 (IPA1) and OsSPL7, two target genes of miR-156, enhanced disease resistance against bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), but reduced rice yield. We discovered that gibberellin signalling might be partially responsible for the disease resistance and developmental defects in IPA1 overexpressors. We then generated transgenic rice plants expressing IPA1 with the pathogen-inducible promoter of OsHEN1; these plants had both enhanced disease resistance and enhanced yield-related traits. Thus, we have identified miR-156-IPA1 as a novel regulator of the crosstalk between growth and defence, and we have established a new strategy for obtaining both high disease resistance and high yield.
NA	Heat stress transcription factor OsSPL7 plays a critical role in reactive oxygen species balance and stress responses in rice.	2019	Plant Sci	Graduate School of Biotechnology and Crop Biotech Institute, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 17104, South Korea.	The rice spotted leaf gene, OsSPL7, induces lesion mimic (LM) spots under heat stress. Herein, we provide several lines of evidence elucidating the importance of OsSPL7 in maintaining reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance via the regulation of downstream gene expression. osspl7 knockout (spl7ko) mutants showed LM and growth retardation. Transgenic rice lines strongly overexpressing OsSPL7 (SPL7OX-S) exhibited LM accompanied by accumulated H2O2, whereas moderate expressers of OsSPL7 (SPL7OX-M) did not, and neither of them exhibited severe growth defects. Transient expression of OsSPL7-GFP in rice protoplasts indicated that OsSPL7 localizes predominantly in the nucleus. Transcriptional activity assay suggested its function as a transcriptional activator in rice. Disease evaluation showed that both SPL7OX and spl7ko enhanced resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agents of blast and blight diseases in rice, respectively. Additionally, SPL7OX enhanced tolerance to cold stress, whereas spl7ko showed a phenotype opposite to the overexpression lines. RNA sequencing analyses identified four major groups of differentially expressed genes associated with LM, pathogen resistance, LM-pathogen resistance, and potential direct targets of OsSPL7. Collectively, our results suggest that OsSPL7 plays a critical role in plant growth and balancing ROS during biotic and abiotic stress.
