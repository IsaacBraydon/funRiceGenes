OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	OsSPL7	Inducible overexpression of Ideal Plant Architecture1 improves both yield and disease resistance in rice.	 In this study, we found that downregulation of microRNA-156 (miR-156) and overexpression of Ideal Plant Architecture1 (IPA1) and OsSPL7, two target genes of miR-156, enhanced disease resistance against bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv
OsSPL7	qGW8|OsSPL16|GW8	MiR529a controls plant height, tiller number, panicle architecture and grain size by regulating SPL target genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 And panicle architecture and grain size were controlled by miR529a through altering the expression of all five target genes OsSPL2, OsSPL7, OsSPL14, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	OsSPL7	MiR529a controls plant height, tiller number, panicle architecture and grain size by regulating SPL target genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 And panicle architecture and grain size were controlled by miR529a through altering the expression of all five target genes OsSPL2, OsSPL7, OsSPL14, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18
OsSPL18	OsSPL7	MiR529a controls plant height, tiller number, panicle architecture and grain size by regulating SPL target genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 And panicle architecture and grain size were controlled by miR529a through altering the expression of all five target genes OsSPL2, OsSPL7, OsSPL14, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18
OsBGAL9	OsSPL7	SPOTTED-LEAF7 targets the gene encoding β-Galactosidase9, which functions in rice growth and stress responses.	 Here, we identified rice (Oryza sativa) β-galactosidase9 (OsBGAL9) as a direct target of the heat stress-induced transcription factor SPOTTED-LEAF7 (OsSPL7), as demonstrated by protoplast transactivation analysis and yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assays
