OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	OsSPL7	Inducible overexpression of Ideal Plant Architecture1 improves both yield and disease resistance in rice.	 In this study, we found that downregulation of microRNA-156 (miR-156) and overexpression of Ideal Plant Architecture1 (IPA1) and OsSPL7, two target genes of miR-156, enhanced disease resistance against bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv
