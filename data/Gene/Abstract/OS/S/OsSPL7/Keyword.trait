OsSPL7	tiller	Modulation of plant architecture by the miR156f-OsSPL7-OsGH3.8 pathway in rice.	 Plants over-expressing OsSPL7 had a reduced tiller number, while OsSPL7 RNAi plants had an increased tiller number and a reduced height
OsSPL7	architecture	Modulation of plant architecture by the miR156f-OsSPL7-OsGH3.8 pathway in rice.	 Genetic analysis showed that OsSPL7 is a target of miR156f that regulates plant architecture
OsSPL7	height	Modulation of plant architecture by the miR156f-OsSPL7-OsGH3.8 pathway in rice.	 Plants over-expressing OsSPL7 had a reduced tiller number, while OsSPL7 RNAi plants had an increased tiller number and a reduced height
OsSPL7	tiller number	Modulation of plant architecture by the miR156f-OsSPL7-OsGH3.8 pathway in rice.	 Plants over-expressing OsSPL7 had a reduced tiller number, while OsSPL7 RNAi plants had an increased tiller number and a reduced height
OsSPL7	plant architecture	Modulation of plant architecture by the miR156f-OsSPL7-OsGH3.8 pathway in rice.	 Genetic analysis showed that OsSPL7 is a target of miR156f that regulates plant architecture
