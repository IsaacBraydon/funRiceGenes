Plant Physiol.-1995-Tanaka-677-83.pdf	Structure, organization, and chromosomal location of the gene encoding a form of rice soluble starch synthase	1995	Plant Physiol	Institute of Applied Biochemistry, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	A rice (Oryza sativa L.) genomic clone encoding the gene for a form of soluble starch synthase (SSS1) and its 5'- and 3'-flanking regions has been isolated and sequenced. The SSS1 gene contained 15 exons interrupted by 14 introns. The exon/intron organization of the SSS1 gene was divergent from that of the rice Waxy gene coding for granule-bound starch synthase, thus suggesting that the SSS1 and granule-bound starch synthase genes have evolved from an ancestral gene in a different way or that the two genes are products of different ancestral genes that have converged during evolution. However, these two genes were closely located to each other on rice chromosome 6 at an approximate map distance of 5 centimorgans. The nucleotide sequence of the 5'-end region of the gene is unique because of the presence of some repetitive sequences.
Plant Physiol.-2006-Fujita-1070-84.pdf	Function and characterization of starch synthase I using mutants in rice	2006	Plant Physiol	Department of Biological Production, Akita Prefectural University, Akita City, Japan. naokof@akita-pu.ac.jp	Four starch synthase I (SSI)-deficient rice (Oryza sativa) mutant lines were generated using retrotransposon Tos17 insertion. The mutants exhibited different levels of SSI activities and produced significantly lower amounts of SSI protein ranging from 0% to 20% of the wild type. The mutant endosperm amylopectin showed a decrease in chains with degree of polymerization (DP) 8 to 12 and an increase in chains with DP 6 to 7 and DP 16 to 19. The degree of change in amylopectin chain-length distribution was positively correlated with the extent of decrease in SSI activity in the mutants. The structural changes in the amylopectin increased the gelatinization temperature of endosperm starch. Chain-length analysis of amylopectin in the SSI band excised from native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/SS activity staining gel showed that SSI preferentially synthesized DP 7 to 11 chains by elongating DP 4 to 7 short chains of glycogen or amylopectin. These results show that SSI distinctly generates DP 8 to 12 chains from short DP 6 to 7 chains emerging from the branch point in the A or B(1) chain of amylopectin. SSI seemingly functions from the very early through the late stage of endosperm development. Yet, the complete absence of SSI, despite being a major SS isozyme in the developing endosperm, had no effect on the size and shape of seeds and starch granules and the crystallinity of endosperm starch, suggesting that other SS enzymes are probably capable of partly compensating SSI function. In summary, this study strongly suggested that amylopectin chains are synthesized by the coordinated actions of SSI, SSIIa, and SSIIIa isoforms.

Extensive searches for starch synthase genes were done in the databases of both the whole genome and full-length cDNAs of rice, and ten genes were revealed to comprise the starch synthase gene family. Multi-sequence alignment analysis of the starch synthase proteins from rice and other plant species suggested that they were grouped into five classes, soluble starch synthase I (SSI), SSII, SSIII, SSIV and granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS). In rice, there was one gene for SSI, three for SSII and two each for SSIII, IV and GBSS. The expression pattern of the ten genes in the developing caryopsis was examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Based on the temporal expression patterns, the ten genes could be divided into three groups: (i) early expressers ( SSII-2, III-1, GBSSII), which are expressed in the early stage of grain filling; (ii) late expressers ( SSII-3, III-2, GBSSI), which are expressed in the mid to later stage of grain filling; and (iii) steady expressers ( SSI, II-1, IV-1, IV-2), which are expressed relatively constantly during grain filling. Within a caryopsis, the three gene groups spatially share their expression, i.e. "early expressers" in the pericarp, the "late expressers" in the endosperm" and the "steady expressers" in both tissues. In addition, this grouping was reflected in the expression pattern of various rice tissues: expression in non-endosperm, endosperm or all tissues examined. The implications in this spatio-temporal work sharing of starch synthesis isogenes are discussed.
