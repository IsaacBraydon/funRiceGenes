OsPIL15	OsSSI|SSS1	Regulation of OsPIL15 on rice quality.	 Gene expression analysis showed that RNAi transgenic lines decreased OsCIN2 and OsSUS1 expression and increased OsGBSSI, OsSSI, OsAPGL2, and OsAPGL3 expression level, while over-expression of OsPIL15 increased OsCIN2, OsSUS1, OsSUS6, and OsSSI and decreased OsSSIIa, OsSSIIc, and OsAPGL2 expression level
OsNAC24	OsSSI|SSS1	The OsNAC24-OsNAP protein complex activates OsGBSSI and OsSBEI expression to fine-tune starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm.	 OsNAC24 is a transcriptional activator that targets the promoters of six SECGs; OsGBSSI, OsSBEI, OsAGPS2, OsSSI, OsSSIIIa and OsSSIVb
