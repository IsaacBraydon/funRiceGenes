OsPIL15	OsSSI|SSS1	Regulation of OsPIL15 on rice quality.	 Gene expression analysis showed that RNAi transgenic lines decreased OsCIN2 and OsSUS1 expression and increased OsGBSSI, OsSSI, OsAPGL2, and OsAPGL3 expression level, while over-expression of OsPIL15 increased OsCIN2, OsSUS1, OsSUS6, and OsSSI and decreased OsSSIIa, OsSSIIc, and OsAPGL2 expression level
