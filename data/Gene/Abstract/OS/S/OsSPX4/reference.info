NA	SPX4 Negatively Regulates Phosphate Signaling and Homeostasis through Its Interaction with PHR2 in Rice	2014	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, People¡¯s Republic of China	PHR2, a central regulator of phosphate signaling in rice, enhanced the expression of phosphate starvation-induced (PSI) genes and resulted in the enhancement of Pi acquisition under Pi deficiency stress. This occurred via PHR2 binding to a cis-element named the PHR1 binding sequences. However, the transcription level of PHR2 was not responsive to Pi starvation. So how is activity of transcription factor PHR2 adjusted to adapt diverse Pi status? Here, we identify an SPX family protein, Os-SPX4 (SPX4 hereafter), involving in Pi starvation signaling and acting as a negative regulator of PHR2. SPX4 is shown to be a fast turnover protein. When Pi is sufficient, through its interaction with PHR2, SPX4 inhibits the binding of PHR2 to its cis-element and reduces the targeting of PHR2 to the nucleus. However, when plants grow under Pi deficiency, the degradation of SPX4 is accelerated through the 26S proteasome pathway, thereby releasing PHR2 into the nucleus and activating the expression of PSI genes. Because the level of SPX4 is responsive to Pi concentration and SPX4 interacts with PHR2 and regulates its activity, this suggests that SPX4 senses the internal Pi concentration under diverse Pi conditions and regulates appropriate responses to maintain Pi homeostasis in plants.
NA	Nitrate-NRT1.1B-SPX4 cascade integrates nitrogen and phosphorus signalling networks in plants.	2019	Nat Plants	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. bhu@genetics.ac.cn.	To ensure high crop yields in a sustainable manner, a comprehensive understanding of the control of nutrient acquisition is required. In particular, the signalling networks controlling the coordinated utilization of the two most highly demanded mineral nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus, are of utmost importance. Here, we reveal a mechanism by which nitrate activates both phosphate and nitrate utilization in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We show that the nitrate sensor NRT1.1B interacts with a phosphate signalling repressor SPX4. Nitrate perception strengthens the NRT1.1B-SPX4 interaction and promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of SPX4 by recruiting NRT1.1B interacting protein 1 (NBIP1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This in turn allows the key transcription factor of phosphate signalling, PHR2, to translocate to the nucleus and initiate the transcription of phosphorus utilization genes. Interestingly, the central transcription factor of nitrate signalling, NLP3, is also under the control of SPX4. Thus, nitrate-triggered degradation of SPX4 activates both phosphate- and nitrate-responsive genes, implementing the coordinated utilization of nitrogen and phosphorus.
