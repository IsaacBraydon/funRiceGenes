NA	SPX4 Negatively Regulates Phosphate Signaling and Homeostasis through Its Interaction with PHR2 in Rice	2014	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, People¡¯s Republic of China	PHR2, a central regulator of phosphate signaling in rice, enhanced the expression of phosphate starvation-induced (PSI) genes and resulted in the enhancement of Pi acquisition under Pi deficiency stress. This occurred via PHR2 binding to a cis-element named the PHR1 binding sequences. However, the transcription level of PHR2 was not responsive to Pi starvation. So how is activity of transcription factor PHR2 adjusted to adapt diverse Pi status? Here, we identify an SPX family protein, Os-SPX4 (SPX4 hereafter), involving in Pi starvation signaling and acting as a negative regulator of PHR2. SPX4 is shown to be a fast turnover protein. When Pi is sufficient, through its interaction with PHR2, SPX4 inhibits the binding of PHR2 to its cis-element and reduces the targeting of PHR2 to the nucleus. However, when plants grow under Pi deficiency, the degradation of SPX4 is accelerated through the 26S proteasome pathway, thereby releasing PHR2 into the nucleus and activating the expression of PSI genes. Because the level of SPX4 is responsive to Pi concentration and SPX4 interacts with PHR2 and regulates its activity, this suggests that SPX4 senses the internal Pi concentration under diverse Pi conditions and regulates appropriate responses to maintain Pi homeostasis in plants.
NA	Nitrate-NRT1.1B-SPX4 cascade integrates nitrogen and phosphorus signalling networks in plants.	2019	Nat Plants	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. bhu@genetics.ac.cn.	To ensure high crop yields in a sustainable manner, a comprehensive understanding of the control of nutrient acquisition is required. In particular, the signalling networks controlling the coordinated utilization of the two most highly demanded mineral nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus, are of utmost importance. Here, we reveal a mechanism by which nitrate activates both phosphate and nitrate utilization in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We show that the nitrate sensor NRT1.1B interacts with a phosphate signalling repressor SPX4. Nitrate perception strengthens the NRT1.1B-SPX4 interaction and promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of SPX4 by recruiting NRT1.1B interacting protein 1 (NBIP1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This in turn allows the key transcription factor of phosphate signalling, PHR2, to translocate to the nucleus and initiate the transcription of phosphorus utilization genes. Interestingly, the central transcription factor of nitrate signalling, NLP3, is also under the control of SPX4. Thus, nitrate-triggered degradation of SPX4 activates both phosphate- and nitrate-responsive genes, implementing the coordinated utilization of nitrogen and phosphorus.
NA	Modulation of nitrate-induced phosphate response by the MYB transcription factor RLI1/HINGE1 in the nucleus	2020	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, the Innovative Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China.	The coordinated utilization of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) is vital for plants to maintain nutrient balance and achieve optimal growth. Previously, we revealed a mechanism by which nitrate induces genes for phosphate utilization; this mechanism depends on NRT1.1B-facilitated degradation of cytoplasmic SPX4, which in turn promotes cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of PHR2, the central transcription factor of phosphate signaling, and triggers the nitrate-induced phosphate response (NIPR) and N-P coordinated utilization in rice. In this study, we unveiled a fine-tuning mechanism of NIPR in the nucleus regulated by Highly Induced by Nitrate Gene 1 (HINGE1, also known as RLI1), a MYB-transcription factor closely related to PHR2. RLI1/HINGE1, which is transcriptionally activated by PHR2 under nitrate induction, can directly activate the expression of phosphate starvation-induced genes. More importantly, RLI1/HINGE1 competes with PHR2 for binding to its repressor proteins in the nucleus (SPX proteins), and consequently releases PHR2 to further enhance phosphate response. Therefore, RLI1/HINGE1 amplifies the phosphate response in the nucleus downstream of the cytoplasmic SPX4-PHR2 cascade, thereby enabling fine-tuning of N-P balance when nitrate supply is sufficient.
NA	The D14-SDEL1-SPX4 cascade integrates the strigolactone and phosphate signalling networks in rice.	2023	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics &amp; Germplasm Enhancement and Utilization, Nanjing Agricultural University, 210095, Nanjing, China.	Modern agriculture needs large quantities of phosphate (Pi) fertilisers to obtain high yields. Information on how plants sense and adapt to Pi is required to enhance phosphorus-use efficiency (PUE) and thereby promote agricultural sustainability. Here, we show that strigolactones (SLs) regulate riceÂ root developmental and metabolic adaptations to low Pi, by promoting efficient Pi uptake and translocation from roots to shoots. Low Pi stress triggers the synthesis of SLs, which dissociate the Pi central signalling module of SPX domain-containing protein (SPX4) and PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE protein (PHR2), leading to the release of PHR2 into the nucleus and activating the expression of Pi-starvation-induced genes including Pi transporters. The SL synthetic analogue GR24 enhances the interaction between the SL receptor DWARF 14 (D14) and a RING-finger ubiquitin E3 ligase (SDEL1). The sdel mutants have a reduced response to Pi starvation relative to wild-type plants, leading to insensitive root adaptation to Pi. Also, SLs induce the degradation of SPX4 via forming the D14-SDEL1-SPX4 complex. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism underlying crosstalk between the SL and Pi signalling networks in response to Pi fluctuations, which will enable breeding of high-PUE crop plants.
