Symbol	Expression
OsSWN1	 OsSWN1 triggers the induction of polysaccharide and lignin biosynthetic gene expressions, however resulting in no significant impact on the lignin content in the transgenic plants
OsSWN1	 DNA methylation variation of lignin synthesis-related OsSWN1, OsMYBX9, OsPAL1 and Os4CL3 mediated their expression level differnece and affected the ratio of cellulose to lignin content
