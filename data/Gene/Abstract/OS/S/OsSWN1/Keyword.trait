OsSWN1	lignin	Change in lignin structure, but not in lignin content, in transgenic poplar overexpressing the rice master regulator of secondary cell wall biosynthesis.	 OsSWN1 triggers the induction of polysaccharide and lignin biosynthetic gene expressions, however resulting in no significant impact on the lignin content in the transgenic plants
