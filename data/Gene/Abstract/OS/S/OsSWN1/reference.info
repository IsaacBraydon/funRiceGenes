The bulk of grass biomass potentially useful for cellulose-based biofuel production is the remains of secondary wall-containing sclerenchymatous fibers. Hence, it is important to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of secondary wall thickening in grass species. So far, little is known about the transcriptional regulatory switches responsible for the activation of the secondary wall biosynthetic program in grass species. Here, we report the roles of a group of rice and maize NAC and MYB transcription factors in the regulation of secondary wall biosynthesis. The rice and maize secondary wall-associated NACs (namely OsSWNs and ZmSWNs) were able to complement the Arabidopsis snd1 nst1 double mutant defective in secondary wall thickening. When overexpressed in Arabidopsis, OsSWNs and ZmSWNs were sufficient to activate a number of secondary wall-associated transcription factors and secondary wall biosynthetic genes, and concomitantly result in the ectopic deposition of cellulose, xylan and lignin. It was also found that the rice and maize MYB transcription factors, OsMYB46 and ZmMYB46, are functional orthologs of Arabidopsis MYB46/MYB83 and, when overexpressed in Arabidopsis, they were able to activate the entire secondary wall biosynthetic program. Furthermore, the promoters of OsMYB46 and ZmMYB46 contain secondary wall NAC-binding elements (SNBEs), which can be bound and activated by OsSWNs and ZmSWNs. Together, our results indicate that the rice and maize SWNs and MYB46 are master transcriptional activators of the secondary wall biosynthetic program and that OsSWNs and ZmSWNs activate their direct target genes through binding to the SNBE sites.
NA	Change in lignin structure, but not in lignin content, in transgenic poplar overexpressing the rice master regulator of secondary cell wall biosynthesis.	2017	Physiol Plant	Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Koganei, Tokyo, 184-8588, Japan.	We previously succeeded to enhance formation of wood in transgenic poplar plants by overexpressing SECONDARY WALL NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN 1 from Oryza sativa (OsSWN1), a transcription factor master regulator of secondary cell wall formation in rice, under control of the fiber preferential NST3/SND1 promoter from Arabidopsis. Transgenic plants had an increased cell wall thickness and cell wall density of individual cells in the secondary xylem of stems as well as an increased wood density. OsSWN1 triggers the induction of polysaccharide and lignin biosynthetic gene expressions, however resulting in no significant impact on the lignin content in the transgenic plants. In contrast, wet and dry chemical analyses of lignin revealed changes in S/G ratio and in the composition of lignin inter-unit linkages in transgenic lines. The results from gene expression analysis suggest that the structural changes in lignin were due to an unbalanced induction of lignin biosynthetic genes in transgenic lines. Our present data indicate that the overexpression of the chimeric transcription factor causes accelerated deposition of secondary cell wall components including lignin and polysaccharides through an acquired mechanism.
