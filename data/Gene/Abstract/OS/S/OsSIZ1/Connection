OsSIZ1	OsSIZ2	OsSIZ1 Regulates the Vegetative Growth and Reproductive Development in Rice	In this work, two homologous genes from rice (Oryza sativa) were isolated and designated as OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 based on amino acid sequence homology to AtSIZ1 and their phylogenetic relationship
OsSIZ1	OsSIZ2	Functional characterization of the SIZ/PIAS-type SUMO E3 ligases, OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 in rice	Here, we report the isolation and molecular characterization of Oryza sativa SIZ1 (OsSIZ1) and SIZ2 (OsSIZ2), rice homologs of Arabidopsis SIZ1
OsSIZ1	OsSIZ2	Functional characterization of the SIZ/PIAS-type SUMO E3 ligases, OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 in rice	The expression of OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 in siz1-2 Arabidopsis plants partially complemented the morphological mutant phenotype and enhanced levels of SUMO conjugates under heat shock conditions
OsSIZ1	OsSIZ2	Functional characterization of the SIZ/PIAS-type SUMO E3 ligases, OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 in rice	In addition, ABA-hypersensitivity of siz1-2 seed germination was partially suppressed by OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2
OsSIZ1	OsSIZ2	Functional characterization of the SIZ/PIAS-type SUMO E3 ligases, OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 in rice	Functional characterization of the SIZ/PIAS-type SUMO E3 ligases, OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 in rice
OsSIZ1	OsSIZ2	Functional characterization of the SIZ/PIAS-type SUMO E3 ligases, OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 in rice	The results suggest that rice SIZ1 and SIZ2 are able to functionally complement Arabidopsis SIZ1 in the SUMO conjugation pathway
OsLPR3	OsSIZ1	Identification and expression analysis of OsLPR family revealed the potential roles of OsLPR3 and 5 in maintaining phosphate homeostasis in rice.	Further, the expression levels of OsLPR3 and 5 were either attenuated in ossiz1 and ospho2 or augmented in rice overexpressing OsSPX1
OsSIZ1	OsSIZ2	OsSIZ2 exerts regulatory influences on the developmental responses and phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 Whether paralogs OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 are functionally redundant or the latter regulates these traits independent of the former is not known
OsSIZ1	OsSIZ2	OsSIZ2 exerts regulatory influences on the developmental responses and phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 Further, attenuation in the expression levels of OsSIZ2 in the roots of ossiz1 and relatively similar trend of the effects of the mutation in OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 on growth and development and total P concentration in different tissues suggested a prevalence of partial functional redundancy between these paralogs
OsSIZ1	OsSIZ2	OsSIZ2 regulates nitrogen homeostasis and some of the reproductive traits in rice.	 Here, we investigated the biological function of OsSIZ2, a paralog of OsSIZ1, in the responses to nitrogen, anther dehiscence, and seed length using a reverse genetics approach
