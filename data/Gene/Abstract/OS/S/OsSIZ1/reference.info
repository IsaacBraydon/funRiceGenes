Although there have been a number of reports about the functions of SIZ1 in Arabidopsis in the regulation of diverse life processes, no information regarding the role of SIZ in other plants is available yet. In this work, two homologous genes from rice (Oryza sativa) were isolated and designated as OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 based on amino acid sequence homology to AtSIZ1 and their phylogenetic relationship. The function in the vegetative growth and reproductive development in rice was investigated using OsSIZ1 mutants containing a T-DNA insertion. The results showed that the mutant Ossiz1 exhibited the significant changes in several growth and developmental parameters, including primary root length, adventitious root number, plant height, leaf and panicle length, flower formation, and seed-setting rate compared with wild type. Taking together these results indicate that OsSIZ1 plays an important role in regulating growth and development in rice.

The PIAS [protein inhibitor of activated signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)] and SAP (scaffold attachment factor A/B/acinus/PIAS)/MIZ (SIZ) proteins exhibit SUMO E3-ligase activity that facilitates the conjugation of SUMO proteins to target substrates. Here, we report the isolation and molecular characterization of Oryza sativa SIZ1 (OsSIZ1) and SIZ2 (OsSIZ2), rice homologs of Arabidopsis SIZ1. The rice SIZ proteins are localized to the nucleus and showed sumoylation activities in a tobacco system. Our analysis showed increased amounts of SUMO conjugates associated with environmental stresses such as high and low temperature, NaCl and abscisic acid (ABA) in rice plants. The expression of OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 in siz1-2 Arabidopsis plants partially complemented the morphological mutant phenotype and enhanced levels of SUMO conjugates under heat shock conditions. In addition, ABA-hypersensitivity of siz1-2 seed germination was partially suppressed by OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2. The results suggest that rice SIZ1 and SIZ2 are able to functionally complement Arabidopsis SIZ1 in the SUMO conjugation pathway. Their effects on the Arabidopsis mutant suggest a function for these genes related to stress responses and stress adaptation.

However, the biological function of the SUMO E3 ligase, SIZ1, in rice (Oryza sativa) is still under investigation. * In this study, we employed two different genetic approaches, the use of siz1 T-DNA mutant and SIZ1-RNAi transgenic plants, to characterize the function of rice SIZ1. * Genetic results revealed the co-segregation of single T-DNA insertional recessive mutation with the observed phenotypes in siz1. In addition to showing reduced plant height, tiller number and seed set percentage, both the siz1 mutant and SIZ1-RNAi transgenic plants showed obvious defects in anther dehiscence, but not pollen viability. The anther indehiscence in siz1 was probably a result of defects in endothecium development before anthesis. Interestingly, rice orthologs of AtIRX and ZmMADS2, which are essential for endothecium development during anther dehiscence, were significantly down-regulated in siz1. Compared with the wild-type, the sumoylation profile of high-molecular-weight proteins in mature spikelets was reduced significantly in siz1 and the SIZ1-RNAi line with notably reduced SIZ1 expression. The nuclear localization signal located in the SIZ1 C-terminus was sufficient for its nuclear targeting in bombarded onion epidermis. * The results suggest the functional role of SIZ1, a SUMO E3 ligase, in regulating rice anther dehiscence.
NA	OsSIZ1, a SUMO E3 Ligase Gene, is Involved in the Regulation of the Responses to Phosphate and Nitrogen in Rice.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, 210095, China Present address: Provincial Key Laboratory of Agrobiology, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, China.	SIZ1-mediated SUMOylation regulates hormone signaling as well as abiotic and biotic stress responses in plants. Here, we investigated the expression profile of OsSIZ1 in rice using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and pOsSIZ1-GUS transgenic plants, and the function of OsSIZ1 in the responses to phosphate and nitrogen using a reverse genetics approach. OsSIZ1 is constitutively expressed throughout the vegetative and reproductive growth of rice, with stronger promoter activities in vascular bundles of culms. ossiz1 mutants had shorter primary roots and adventitious roots than wild-type plants, suggesting that OsSIZ1 is associated with the regulation of root system architecture. Total phosphorus (P) and phosphate (Pi) concentrations in both roots and shoots of ossiz1 mutants were significantly increased irrespective of Pi supply conditions compared with the wild type. Pi concentration in the xylem sap of ossiz1 mutants was significantly higher than that of the wild type under a Pi-sufficient growth regime. Total nitrogen (N) concentrations in the most detected tissues of ossiz1 mutants were significantly increased compared with the wild type. Analysis of mineral contents in ossiz1 mutants indicated that OsSIZ1 functions specifically in Pi and N responses, not those of other nutrients examined, in rice. Further, qRT-PCR analyses revealed that the expression of multiple genes involved in Pi starvation signaling and N transport and assimilation were altered in ossiz1 mutants. Together, these results suggested that OsSIZ1 may act as a regulator of the Pi (N)-dependent responses in rice.
NA	Overexpression of the Rice SUMO E3 Ligase Gene OsSIZ1 in Cotton Enhances Drought and Heat Tolerance, and Substantially Improves Fiber Yields in the Field under Reduced Irrigation and Rainfed Conditions.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Biological Sciences, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX 79409, USA.	The Arabidopsis SUMO E3 ligase gene AtSIZ1 plays important roles in plant response to abiotic stresses as loss of function in AtSIZ1 leads to increased sensitivity to drought, heat and salt stresses. Overexpression of the AtSIZ1 rice homolog, OsSIZ1, leads to increased heat and drought tolerance in bentgrass, suggesting that the function of the E3 ligase SIZ1 is highly conserved in plants and it plays a critical role in abiotic stress responses. To test the possibility that the SUMO E3 ligase could be used to engineer drought- and heat-tolerant crops, the rice gene OsSIZ1 was overexpressed in cotton. We report here that overexpression of OsSIZ1 in cotton results in higher net photosynthesis and better growth than wild-type cotton under drought and thermal stresses in growth chamber and greenhouse conditions. Additionally, this tolerance to abiotic stresses was correlated with higher fiber yield in both controlled-environment and field trials carried out under reduced irrigation and rainfed conditions. These results suggest that OsSIZ1 is a viable candidate gene to improve crop yields under water-limited and rainfed agricultural production systems.
NA	Overexpression of the rice gene OsSIZ1 in Arabidopsis improves drought-, heat-, and salt-tolerance simultaneously.	2018	PLoS One	Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.	Sumoylation is one of the post translational modifications, which affects cellular processes in plants through conjugation of small ubiquitin like modifier (SUMO) to target substrate proteins. Response to various abiotic environmental stresses is one of the major cellular functions regulated by SUMO conjugation. SIZ1 is a SUMO E3 ligase, facilitating a vital step in the sumoylation pathway. In this report, it is demonstrated that over-expression of the rice gene OsSIZ1 in Arabidopsis leads to increased tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. For example, OsSIZ1-overexpressing plants exhibited enhanced tolerance to salt, drought, and heat stresses, and generated greater seed yields under a variety of stress conditions. Furthermore, OsSIZ1-overexpressing plants were able to exclude sodium ions more efficiently when grown in saline soils and accumulate higher potassium ions as compared to wild-type plants. Further analysis revealed that OsSIZ1-overexpressing plants expressed higher transcript levels of P5CS, a gene involved in the biosynthesis of proline, under both salt and drought stress conditions. Therefore, proline here is acting as an osmoprotectant to alleviate damages caused by drought and salt stresses. These results demonstrate that the rice gene OsSIZ1 has a great potential to be used for improving crop's tolerance to several abiotic stresses.
