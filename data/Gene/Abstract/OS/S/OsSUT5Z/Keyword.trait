OsSUT5|OsSUT5Z	leaf	Cloning and expression analysis of rice sucrose transporter genes OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z	 In vegetative organs, transcripts of OsSUT2M were higher in source leaf blades than in other organs at the same development stage, whereas transcripts of OsSUT5Z were less traceable in all organs investigated
