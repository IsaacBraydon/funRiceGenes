OsSUT5|OsSUT5Z	leaf	Cloning and expression analysis of rice sucrose transporter genes OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z	In vegetative organs, transcripts of OsSUT2M were higher in source leaf blades than in other organs at the same development stage, whereas transcripts of OsSUT5Z were less traceable in all organs investigated
OsSUT5|OsSUT5Z	transporter	Cloning and expression analysis of rice sucrose transporter genes OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z	Two sucrose transporter (SUT) cDNAs, OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z, were isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L
OsSUT5|OsSUT5Z	transporter	Cloning and expression analysis of rice sucrose transporter genes OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z	The TopPred program suggested that both sucrose transporter proteins, OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z, consist of potentially 12 transmembrane domains
OsSUT5|OsSUT5Z	transporter	Cloning and expression analysis of rice sucrose transporter genes OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z	Cloning and expression analysis of rice sucrose transporter genes OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z
OsSUT5|OsSUT5Z	transporter	Transport activity of rice sucrose transporters OsSUT1 and OsSUT5	Transport activity of rice sucrose transporters OsSUT1 and OsSUT5
OsSUT5|OsSUT5Z	vegetative	Cloning and expression analysis of rice sucrose transporter genes OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z	In vegetative organs, transcripts of OsSUT2M were higher in source leaf blades than in other organs at the same development stage, whereas transcripts of OsSUT5Z were less traceable in all organs investigated
OsSUT5|OsSUT5Z	phloem	Phloem loading in rice leaves depends strongly on the apoplastic pathway	 Cross sections of the GUS transgenic plant showed that the signals of OsSUT1 and OsSUT5 occurred in the phloem companion cells
