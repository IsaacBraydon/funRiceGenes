OsSOG1	DNA repair	SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE 1 plays rice-specific roles in DNA damage response and repair.	 Based on the analysis of DNA damage susceptibility and the effect on the expression of DNA repair-related genes using these mutants, we have demonstrated that OsSOG1 plays a more important role than OsSGL in controlling the DDR and DNA repair
OsSOG1	homologous recombination	SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE 1 plays rice-specific roles in DNA damage response and repair.	 In addition to OsSOG1 or OsSGL knockout mutants, OsSOG1 non-phosphorylatable mutants (OsSOG1-7A) were generated by homologous recombination-mediated gene targeting (GT)
