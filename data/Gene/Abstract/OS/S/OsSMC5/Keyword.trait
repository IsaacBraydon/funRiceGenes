OsSMC5	yield	The SMC5/6 complex subunit MMS21 regulates stem cell proliferation in rice.	 ossmc5/ + and ossmc6/ + heterozygous single mutants did not yield homozygous mutants in their progeny, indicating that OsSMC5 and OsSMC6 both play necessary roles during embryo formation
OsSMC5	embryo	The SMC5/6 complex subunit MMS21 regulates stem cell proliferation in rice.	 ossmc5/ + and ossmc6/ + heterozygous single mutants did not yield homozygous mutants in their progeny, indicating that OsSMC5 and OsSMC6 both play necessary roles during embryo formation
OsSMC5	cell proliferation	The SMC5/6 complex subunit MMS21 regulates stem cell proliferation in rice.	 Here, OsSMC5 and OsSMC6 single heterozygous mutants were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to elucidate the function of SMC5/6 subunits, including OsSMC5, OsSMC6, and OsMMS21, in cell proliferation in rice
