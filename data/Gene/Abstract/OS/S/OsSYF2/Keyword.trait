OsSYF2	grain	A Cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 Interacts with OsSYF2 to Regulate Grain Length by Pre-mRNA Splicing.	A Cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 Interacts with OsSYF2 to Regulate Grain Length by Pre-mRNA Splicing.
OsSYF2	grain	A Cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 Interacts with OsSYF2 to Regulate Grain Length by Pre-mRNA Splicing.	 The phenotypes of transgenic lines indicated that OsSYF2 positively regulates grain length via its influence on cell expansion
OsSYF2	grain length	A Cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 Interacts with OsSYF2 to Regulate Grain Length by Pre-mRNA Splicing.	A Cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 Interacts with OsSYF2 to Regulate Grain Length by Pre-mRNA Splicing.
OsSYF2	grain length	A Cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 Interacts with OsSYF2 to Regulate Grain Length by Pre-mRNA Splicing.	 The phenotypes of transgenic lines indicated that OsSYF2 positively regulates grain length via its influence on cell expansion
OsSYF2	sugar	A Cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 Interacts with OsSYF2 to Regulate Grain Length by Pre-mRNA Splicing.	 Transcriptomic analysis showed that OsSYF2 controls the expression and pre-mRNA alternative splicing of genes involved in sugar metabolism
