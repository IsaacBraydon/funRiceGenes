NA	OsSQD1 at the crossroads of phosphate and sulfur metabolism affects plant morphology and lipid composition in response to phosphate deprivation.	2020	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	In phosphate (Pi)-deprived Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is substituted by sulfolipid for maintaining Pi homeostasis. Sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol1 (AtSQD1) encodes a protein, which catalyzes uridine diphosphate glucose (UDPG) and sulfite (SO3 2- ) to UDP-sulfoquinovose, which is a key component in the sulfolipid biosynthetic pathway. In this study, a reverse genetics approach was employed to decipher the function of the AtSQD1 homolog OsSQD1 in rice. Differential expressions of OsSQD1 in different tissue and response to -P and -S also detected, respectively. The in vitro protein assay and analysis suggests that OsSQD1 is a UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase. Transient expression analysis showed that OsSQD1 is located in the chloroplast. The analyses of the knockout (ossqd1) and knockdown (Ri1 and Ri2) mutants demonstrated reductions in Pi and total P concentrations, 32 Pi uptake rate, expression levels of Pi transporters and altered developmental responses of root traits, which were accentuated during Pi deficiency. The inhibitory effects of the OsSQD1 mutation were also evident in the development of reproductive tissue. Furthermore, OsSQD1 differently affects lipid composition under different Pi regime affects sulfur (S) homeostasis. Together, the study revealed that OsSQD1 affects Pi and S homeostasis, and lipid composition in response to Pi deprivation.
NA	Does Sulfoquinovosyl Diacylglycerol Synthase OsSQD1 Affect the Composition of Lipids in Rice Phosphate-Deprived Root?	2022	Int J Mol Sci	Institute of Eco-Environment and Plant Protection, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shanghai 201403, China.	Lipids are the essential components of the cell intracellular and plasma membranes. Sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) is a glycolipid; glycolipids can replace phospholipids in maintaining phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in plants which are undergoing Pi starvation. Sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol synthase 1 (OsSQD1) is a critical enzyme in the first step of catalyzation in the formation of SQDG in rice. In this study, the expression pattern of different zones in roots of OsSQD1 in response to different Pi conditions is examined, and it is found that OsSQD1 is highly expressed in lateral roots under Pi-sufficient and -deficient conditions. The root phenotype observation of different OsSQD1 transgenic lines suggests that the knockout/down of OsSQD1 inhibits the formation and growth of lateral roots under different Pi conditions. Additionally, the lipid concentrations in OsSQD1 transgenic line roots indicate that OsSQD1 knockout/down decreases the concentration of phospholipids and glycolipids in Pi-starved roots. The OsSQD1 mutation also changes the composition of different lipid species with different acyl chain lengths, mainly under Pi-deprived conditions. The relative transcript expression of genes relating to glycolipid synthesis and phospholipid degradation is estimated to help study the mechanism by which OsSQD1 exerts an influence on the alteration of lipid composition and concentration in Pi-starved roots. Moreover, in Pi-starved roots, the knockout of OsSQD1 decreases the unsaturated fatty acid content of phospholipids and glycolipids. To summarize, the present study demonstrates that OsSQD1 plays a key role in the maintenance of phospholipid and glycolipid composition in Pi-deprived rice roots, which may influence root growth and development under Pi-deprived conditions.
