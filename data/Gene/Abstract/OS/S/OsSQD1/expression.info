OsSQD1	 Differential expressions of OsSQD1 in different tissue and response to -P and -S also detected, respectively |  Transient expression analysis showed that OsSQD1 is located in the chloroplast |  The analyses of the knockout (ossqd1) and knockdown (Ri1 and Ri2) mutants demonstrated reductions in Pi and total P concentrations, 32 Pi uptake rate, expression levels of Pi transporters and altered developmental responses of root traits, which were accentuated during Pi deficiency
OsSQD1	 In this study, the expression pattern of different zones in roots of OsSQD1 in response to different Pi conditions is examined, and it is found that OsSQD1 is highly expressed in lateral roots under Pi-sufficient and -deficient conditions |  The relative transcript expression of genes relating to glycolipid synthesis and phospholipid degradation is estimated to help study the mechanism by which OsSQD1 exerts an influence on the alteration of lipid composition and concentration in Pi-starved roots
