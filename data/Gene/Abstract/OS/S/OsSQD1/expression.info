OsSQD1	 Differential expressions of OsSQD1 in different tissue and response to -P and -S also detected, respectively |  Transient expression analysis showed that OsSQD1 is located in the chloroplast |  The analyses of the knockout (ossqd1) and knockdown (Ri1 and Ri2) mutants demonstrated reductions in Pi and total P concentrations, 32 Pi uptake rate, expression levels of Pi transporters and altered developmental responses of root traits, which were accentuated during Pi deficiency
