OsSQD1	chloroplast	OsSQD1 at the crossroads of phosphate and sulfur metabolism affects plant morphology and lipid composition in response to phosphate deprivation.	 Transient expression analysis showed that OsSQD1 is located in the chloroplast
OsSQD1	development	OsSQD1 at the crossroads of phosphate and sulfur metabolism affects plant morphology and lipid composition in response to phosphate deprivation.	 The inhibitory effects of the OsSQD1 mutation were also evident in the development of reproductive tissue
OsSQD1	reproductive	OsSQD1 at the crossroads of phosphate and sulfur metabolism affects plant morphology and lipid composition in response to phosphate deprivation.	 The inhibitory effects of the OsSQD1 mutation were also evident in the development of reproductive tissue
OsSQD1	homeostasis	OsSQD1 at the crossroads of phosphate and sulfur metabolism affects plant morphology and lipid composition in response to phosphate deprivation.	 Furthermore, OsSQD1 differently affects lipid composition under different Pi regime affects sulfur (S) homeostasis
OsSQD1	phosphate	OsSQD1 at the crossroads of phosphate and sulfur metabolism affects plant morphology and lipid composition in response to phosphate deprivation.	OsSQD1 at the crossroads of phosphate and sulfur metabolism affects plant morphology and lipid composition in response to phosphate deprivation.
OsSQD1	Pi	OsSQD1 at the crossroads of phosphate and sulfur metabolism affects plant morphology and lipid composition in response to phosphate deprivation.	 Furthermore, OsSQD1 differently affects lipid composition under different Pi regime affects sulfur (S) homeostasis
OsSQD1	Pi	OsSQD1 at the crossroads of phosphate and sulfur metabolism affects plant morphology and lipid composition in response to phosphate deprivation.	 Together, the study revealed that OsSQD1 affects Pi and S homeostasis, and lipid composition in response to Pi deprivation
