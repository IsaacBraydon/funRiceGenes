OsMED25	OsSFR6|OsMED16	Functional Analysis of OsMED16 and OsMED25 in Response to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses in Rice 	Functional Analysis of OsMED16 and OsMED25 in Response to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses in Rice 
OsMED25	OsSFR6|OsMED16	Functional Analysis of OsMED16 and OsMED25 in Response to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses in Rice 	 We used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to study the functions of two genes, namely OsMED16 and OsMED25 in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in rice
ICS1|OsVDAC1|OsICS1	OsSFR6|OsMED16	OsMED16, a tail subunit of ediator complex, interacts with OsE2Fa to synergistically regulate rice leaf development and blast resistance.	 Further analysis revealed that OsMED16 interacts with OsE2Fa in nuclei, and the complex could directly regulate the transcriptional levels of several genes involved in cell cycle regulation and SA mediated blast resistance, such as OsCC52A1, OsCDKA1, OsCDKB2;2, OsICS1 and OsWRKY45
