j.1469-8137.2011.03759.x.pdf	OsSFR6 is a functional rice orthologue of SENSITIVE TO FREEZING-6 and can act as a regulator of COR gene expression, osmotic stress and freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis	2011	New Phytol	School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Durham University, Durham, UK.	The Arabidopsis protein SENSITIVE TO FREEZING-6 (AtSFR6) is required for cold- and drought-inducible expression of COLD-ON REGULATED (COR) genes and, as a consequence, AtSFR6 is essential for osmotic stress and freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis. Therefore, orthologues of AtSFR6 in crop species represent important candidate targets for future manipulation of stress tolerance. We identified and cloned a homologue of AtSFR6 from rice (Oryza sativa), OsSFR6, and confirmed its orthology in Arabidopsis. OsSFR6 was identified by homology searches, and a full-length coding region isolated using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from Oryza sativa cDNA. To test for orthology, OsSFR6 was expressed in an Arabidopsis sfr6 loss-of-function mutant background, and restoration of wild-type phenotypes was assessed. Searching the rice genome revealed a single homologue of AtSFR6. Cloning and sequencing the OsSFR6 coding region showed OsSFR6 to have 61.7% identity and 71.1% similarity to AtSFR6 at the predicted protein sequence level. Expression of OsSFR6 in the atsfr6 mutant background restored the wild-type visible phenotype, as well as restoring wild-type levels of COR gene expression and tolerance of osmotic and freezing stresses. OsSFR6 is an orthologue of AtSFR6, and thus a target for future manipulation to improve tolerance to osmotic and other abiotic stresses.
NA	Functional Analysis of OsMED16 and OsMED25 in Response to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses in Rice 	2021	Front Plant Sci	College of Life Science, Taizhou University, Taizhou, China.	Mediator complex is a multiprotein complex that regulates RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Moreover, it functions in several signaling pathways, including those involved in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. We used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to study the functions of two genes, namely OsMED16 and OsMED25 in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in rice. Both genes were differentially induced by Magnaporthe grisea (M. grisea), the causative agent of blast disease, hormone treatment, and abiotic stress. We found that both BMV: OsMED16- and BMV: OsMED25-infiltrated seedlings reduced the resistance to M. grisea by regulating the accumulation of H2O2 and expression of defense-related genes. Furthermore, BMV: OsMED16-infiltrated seedlings decreased the tolerance to cold by increasing the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and reducing the expression of cold-responsive genes. 
NA	MEDIATOR SUBUNIT 16 negatively regulates rice immunity by modulating PATHOGENESIS RELATED 3 activity.	2023	Plant Physiol	Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, 200234, China.	Lesion mimic mutants (LMMs) are valuable genetic resources for unraveling plant defense responses including programmed cell death (PCD). Here, we identified a rice (Oryza sativa) LMM, spotted leaf 38 (spl38), and demonstrated that spl38 is essential for the formation of hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesions and innate immunity. Map-based cloning revealed that SPL38 encodes MEDIATOR SUBUNIT 16 (OsMED16). The spl38 mutant showed enhanced resistance to rice pathogens Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and exhibited delayed flowering, while OsMED16-overexpressing plants showed increased rice susceptibility to M. oryzae. The OsMED16-edited rice lines were phenotypically similar to the spl38 mutant but were extremely weak, exhibited growth retardation, and eventually died. The C-terminus of OsMED16 showed interaction with the positive immune regulator PATHOGENESIS RELATED 3 (OsPR3), resulting in the competitive repression of its chitinase and chitin-binding activities. Furthermore, the ospr3 osmed16 double mutants did not exhibit the lesion mimic phenotype of the spl38 mutant. Strikingly, OsMED16 exhibited an opposite function in plant defense relative to that of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtMED16, most likely because of two amino acid substitutions between the monocot and dicot MED16s tested. Collectively, our findings suggest that OsMED16 negatively regulates cell death and immunity in rice, probably via the OsPR3-mediated chitin signaling pathway.
