OsSFR6|OsMED16	abiotic stress	OsSFR6 is a functional rice orthologue of SENSITIVE TO FREEZING-6 and can act as a regulator of COR gene expression, osmotic stress and freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis	OsSFR6 is an orthologue of AtSFR6, and thus a target for future manipulation to improve tolerance to osmotic and other abiotic stresses
OsSFR6|OsMED16	abiotic stress	Functional Analysis of OsMED16 and OsMED25 in Response to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses in Rice 	Functional Analysis of OsMED16 and OsMED25 in Response to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses in Rice 
OsSFR6|OsMED16	abiotic stress	Functional Analysis of OsMED16 and OsMED25 in Response to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses in Rice 	 We used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to study the functions of two genes, namely OsMED16 and OsMED25 in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in rice
OsSFR6|OsMED16	biotic stress	Functional Analysis of OsMED16 and OsMED25 in Response to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses in Rice 	Functional Analysis of OsMED16 and OsMED25 in Response to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses in Rice 
OsSFR6|OsMED16	biotic stress	Functional Analysis of OsMED16 and OsMED25 in Response to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses in Rice 	 We used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to study the functions of two genes, namely OsMED16 and OsMED25 in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in rice
OsSFR6|OsMED16	defense	MEDIATOR SUBUNIT 16 negatively regulates rice immunity by modulating PATHOGENESIS RELATED 3 activity.	 Strikingly, OsMED16 exhibited an opposite function in plant defense relative to that of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtMED16, most likely because of two amino acid substitutions between the monocot and dicot MED16s tested
OsSFR6|OsMED16	immunity	MEDIATOR SUBUNIT 16 negatively regulates rice immunity by modulating PATHOGENESIS RELATED 3 activity.	 Collectively, our findings suggest that OsMED16 negatively regulates cell death and immunity in rice, probably via the OsPR3-mediated chitin signaling pathway
OsSFR6|OsMED16	cell death	MEDIATOR SUBUNIT 16 negatively regulates rice immunity by modulating PATHOGENESIS RELATED 3 activity.	 Collectively, our findings suggest that OsMED16 negatively regulates cell death and immunity in rice, probably via the OsPR3-mediated chitin signaling pathway
OsSFR6|OsMED16	lesion	MEDIATOR SUBUNIT 16 negatively regulates rice immunity by modulating PATHOGENESIS RELATED 3 activity.	 Furthermore, the ospr3 osmed16 double mutants did not exhibit the lesion mimic phenotype of the spl38 mutant
OsSFR6|OsMED16	lesion mimic	MEDIATOR SUBUNIT 16 negatively regulates rice immunity by modulating PATHOGENESIS RELATED 3 activity.	 Furthermore, the ospr3 osmed16 double mutants did not exhibit the lesion mimic phenotype of the spl38 mutant
OsSFR6|OsMED16	chitin signaling	MEDIATOR SUBUNIT 16 negatively regulates rice immunity by modulating PATHOGENESIS RELATED 3 activity.	 Collectively, our findings suggest that OsMED16 negatively regulates cell death and immunity in rice, probably via the OsPR3-mediated chitin signaling pathway
