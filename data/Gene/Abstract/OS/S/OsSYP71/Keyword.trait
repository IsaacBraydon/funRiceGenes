OsSYP71	oxidative	Overexpression of the Qc-SNARE gene OsSYP71 enhances tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	OsSYP71 is an oxidative stress and rice blast response gene that encodes a Qc-SNARE protein in rice
OsSYP71	oxidative	Overexpression of the Qc-SNARE gene OsSYP71 enhances tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Overexpression of OsSYP71 in rice showed more tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast than wild-type plants
OsSYP71	oxidative	Overexpression of the Qc-SNARE gene OsSYP71 enhances tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	These results indicate that Qc-SNAREs play an important role in rice response to environmental stresses, and OsSYP71 is useful in engineering crop plants with enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast
OsSYP71	oxidative	Overexpression of the Qc-SNARE gene OsSYP71 enhances tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Overexpression of the Qc-SNARE gene OsSYP71 enhances tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
OsSYP71	blast	Overexpression of the Qc-SNARE gene OsSYP71 enhances tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	OsSYP71 is an oxidative stress and rice blast response gene that encodes a Qc-SNARE protein in rice
