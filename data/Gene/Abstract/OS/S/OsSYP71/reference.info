Qc-SNARE proteins belong to the superfamily of SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors), which function as important components of the vesicle trafficking machinery in eukaryotic cells. In this paper, 12 Qc-SNARE genes were isolated from rice, and expression patterns of 9 genes were detected in various tissues and in seedlings challenged with oxidative stresses and inoculated with rice blast. The expression of OsSYP71 was clearly up-regulated under these stresses. Overexpression of OsSYP71 in rice showed more tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast than wild-type plants. These results indicate that Qc-SNAREs play an important role in rice response to environmental stresses, and OsSYP71 is useful in engineering crop plants with enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast.
