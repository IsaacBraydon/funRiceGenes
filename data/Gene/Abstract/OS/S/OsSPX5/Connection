OsSPX3	OsSPX5	The paralogous SPX3 and SPX5 genes redundantly modulate Pi homeostasis in rice	 In this study, phylogenetic analysis revealed that OsSPX3 and OsSPX5 (SPX3/5) are paralogous SPX genes ( SYG1/Pho81/XPR1) in cereal crops| Similar tissue expression patterns of the two genes and proteins were identified by in situ hybridization and the transgenic plants harbouring SPX3pro-SPX3-GUS or SPX5pro-SPX5-GUS fusions, respectively|The paralogous SPX3 and SPX5 genes redundantly modulate Pi homeostasis in rice
