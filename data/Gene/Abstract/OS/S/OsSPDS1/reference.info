A cDNA for a putative 42 kD spermidine synthase (OsSPDS2) was cloned from rice. The deduced OsSPDS2 sequence showed highest similarity with Arabidopsis AtSPDS3. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that OsSPDS2 and AtSPDS3 form a distinctive subclass in the spermidine synthase family in plants. OsSPDS2 mRNA accumulated in roots during long term exposure to chilling temperature (12 degrees C). In contrast, no such induction of the paralogous OsSPDS1 was observed during the chilling treatment. ABA treatment up-regulated OsSPDS2, whereas salt stress did not change OsSPDS2 levels significantly. Data suggested a distinct function of OsSPDS2 in chilling response in rice.
