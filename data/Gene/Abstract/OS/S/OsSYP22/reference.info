Vacuolar storage of inorganic phosphate (Pi) is essential for Pi homeostasis in plants. The SPX-MFS family proteins have been demonstrated to be vacuolar Pi transporters in many plant species. Transcriptional regulation of the predominant transporter among rice SPX-MFSs, OsSPX-MFS3, was only moderately suppressed by Pi starvation. Thus, post-transcriptional mechanisms were hypothesized to regulate the activity of OsSPX-MFS3. In this study, we found that the tonoplast localization of OsSPX-MFSs is inhibited under Pi-depleted conditions, resulting in their retention in the pre-vacuolar compartments (PVCs). A yeast two-hybrid screen identified that two SNARE proteins, OsSYP21 and OsSYP22, interact with the MFS domain of OsSPX-MFS3. Further genetic and cytological analyses indicate that OsSYP21 and OsSYP22 facilitate trafficking of OsSPX-MFS3 from PVCs to the tonoplast. Although a homozygous frameshift mutation in OsSYP22 appeared to be lethal, tonoplast localization of OsSPX-MFS3 was significantly inhibited in transgenic plants expressing a negative-dominant form of OsSYP22 (OsSYP22-ND), resulting in reduced vacuolar Pi concentrations in OsSYP22-ND plants. Under Pi-depleted conditions, the interaction between OsSYP22 and OsSPX-MFS3 was disrupted, and this process depended on the presence of the SPX domain. Deleting the SPX domains of OsSPX-MFSs resulted in their tonoplast localization under both Pi-depleted and Pi-replete conditions. Complementation of the osspx-mfs1/2/3 triple mutants with the MFS domain or the SPX domain of OsSPX-MFS3 confirmed that the MFS and SPX domains are responsive to Pi transport activity and Pi-dependent regulation, respectively. These data indicated that the SPX domains of OsSPX-MFSs sense cellular Pi (InsP) levels and, under Pi-depleted conditions, inhibit the interaction between OsSPX-MFSs and OsSYP21/22 and subsequent trafficking of OsSPX-MFSs from PVCs to the tonoplast.
