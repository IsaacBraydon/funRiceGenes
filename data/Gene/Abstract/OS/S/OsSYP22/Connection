OsSPX-MFS3|OsPSS3	OsSYP22	Phosphate-dependent regulation of vacuolar trafficking of OsSPX-MFSs is critical for maintaining intracellular phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 A yeast two-hybrid screen identified that two SNARE proteins, OsSYP21 and OsSYP22, interact with the MFS domain of OsSPX-MFS3
OsSPX-MFS3|OsPSS3	OsSYP22	Phosphate-dependent regulation of vacuolar trafficking of OsSPX-MFSs is critical for maintaining intracellular phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 Further genetic and cytological analyses indicate that OsSYP21 and OsSYP22 facilitate trafficking of OsSPX-MFS3 from PVCs to the tonoplast
OsSPX-MFS3|OsPSS3	OsSYP22	Phosphate-dependent regulation of vacuolar trafficking of OsSPX-MFSs is critical for maintaining intracellular phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 Although a homozygous frameshift mutation in OsSYP22 appeared to be lethal, tonoplast localization of OsSPX-MFS3 was significantly inhibited in transgenic plants expressing a negative-dominant form of OsSYP22 (OsSYP22-ND), resulting in reduced vacuolar Pi concentrations in OsSYP22-ND plants
OsSPX-MFS3|OsPSS3	OsSYP22	Phosphate-dependent regulation of vacuolar trafficking of OsSPX-MFSs is critical for maintaining intracellular phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 Under Pi-depleted conditions, the interaction between OsSYP22 and OsSPX-MFS3 was disrupted, and this process depended on the presence of the SPX domain
