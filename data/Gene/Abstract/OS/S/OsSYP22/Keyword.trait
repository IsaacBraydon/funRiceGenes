OsSYP22	Pi	Phosphate-dependent regulation of vacuolar trafficking of OsSPX-MFSs is critical for maintaining intracellular phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 Although a homozygous frameshift mutation in OsSYP22 appeared to be lethal, tonoplast localization of OsSPX-MFS3 was significantly inhibited in transgenic plants expressing a negative-dominant form of OsSYP22 (OsSYP22-ND), resulting in reduced vacuolar Pi concentrations in OsSYP22-ND plants
