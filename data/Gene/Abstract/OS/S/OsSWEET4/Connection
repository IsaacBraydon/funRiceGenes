OsS40-14	OsSWEET4	Five OsS40 Family Members Are Identified as Senescence-Related Genes in Rice by Reverse Genetics Approach.	 OsSWEET4 and OsSWEET1b were significantly upregulated, while OsSWEET1a and OsSWEET13 were significantly downregulated in both oss40-7 and oss40-14 compared to WT
OsS40-7	OsSWEET4	Five OsS40 Family Members Are Identified as Senescence-Related Genes in Rice by Reverse Genetics Approach.	 OsSWEET4 and OsSWEET1b were significantly upregulated, while OsSWEET1a and OsSWEET13 were significantly downregulated in both oss40-7 and oss40-14 compared to WT
GS3.1|DG1|GFD1	OsSWEET4	MATE transporter GFD1 cooperates with sugar transporters, mediates carbohydrate partitioning and controls grain-filling duration, grain size and number in rice.	 GFD1 protein was partially localized on the plasma membrane and in the Golgi apparatus, and was finally verified to interact with two sugar transporters, OsSWEET4 and OsSUT2
GS3.1|DG1|GFD1	OsSWEET4	MATE transporter GFD1 cooperates with sugar transporters, mediates carbohydrate partitioning and controls grain-filling duration, grain size and number in rice.	 Genetic analyses showed that GFD1 might control grain-filling duration through OsSWEET4, adjust grain size with OsSUT2 and synergistically modulate grain number per panicle with both OsSUT2 and OsSWEET4
