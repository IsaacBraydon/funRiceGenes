OsSWEET4	seed	Seed filling in domesticated maize and rice depends on SWEET-mediated hexose transport.	Mutants of both maize ZmSWEET4c and its rice ortholog OsSWEET4 are defective in seed filling, indicating that a lack of hexose transport at the BETL impairs further transfer of sugars imported from the maternal phloem
OsSWEET4	phloem	Seed filling in domesticated maize and rice depends on SWEET-mediated hexose transport.	Mutants of both maize ZmSWEET4c and its rice ortholog OsSWEET4 are defective in seed filling, indicating that a lack of hexose transport at the BETL impairs further transfer of sugars imported from the maternal phloem
OsSWEET4	grain	MATE transporter GFD1 cooperates with sugar transporters, mediates carbohydrate partitioning and controls grain-filling duration, grain size and number in rice.	 Genetic analyses showed that GFD1 might control grain-filling duration through OsSWEET4, adjust grain size with OsSUT2 and synergistically modulate grain number per panicle with both OsSUT2 and OsSWEET4
OsSWEET4	grain size	MATE transporter GFD1 cooperates with sugar transporters, mediates carbohydrate partitioning and controls grain-filling duration, grain size and number in rice.	 Genetic analyses showed that GFD1 might control grain-filling duration through OsSWEET4, adjust grain size with OsSUT2 and synergistically modulate grain number per panicle with both OsSUT2 and OsSWEET4
OsSWEET4	panicle	MATE transporter GFD1 cooperates with sugar transporters, mediates carbohydrate partitioning and controls grain-filling duration, grain size and number in rice.	 Genetic analyses showed that GFD1 might control grain-filling duration through OsSWEET4, adjust grain size with OsSUT2 and synergistically modulate grain number per panicle with both OsSUT2 and OsSWEET4
OsSWEET4	grain number	MATE transporter GFD1 cooperates with sugar transporters, mediates carbohydrate partitioning and controls grain-filling duration, grain size and number in rice.	 Genetic analyses showed that GFD1 might control grain-filling duration through OsSWEET4, adjust grain size with OsSUT2 and synergistically modulate grain number per panicle with both OsSUT2 and OsSWEET4
OsSWEET4	sugar	MATE transporter GFD1 cooperates with sugar transporters, mediates carbohydrate partitioning and controls grain-filling duration, grain size and number in rice.	 GFD1 protein was partially localized on the plasma membrane and in the Golgi apparatus, and was finally verified to interact with two sugar transporters, OsSWEET4 and OsSUT2
OsSWEET4	plasma membrane	MATE transporter GFD1 cooperates with sugar transporters, mediates carbohydrate partitioning and controls grain-filling duration, grain size and number in rice.	 GFD1 protein was partially localized on the plasma membrane and in the Golgi apparatus, and was finally verified to interact with two sugar transporters, OsSWEET4 and OsSUT2
