OsSWEET4	seed	Seed filling in domesticated maize and rice depends on SWEET-mediated hexose transport.	 Mutants of both maize ZmSWEET4c and its rice ortholog OsSWEET4 are defective in seed filling, indicating that a lack of hexose transport at the BETL impairs further transfer of sugars imported from the maternal phloem
