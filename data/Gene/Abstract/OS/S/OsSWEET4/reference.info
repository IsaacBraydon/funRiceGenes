NA	Seed filling in domesticated maize and rice depends on SWEET-mediated hexose transport.	2015	Nat Genet	Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Science, Stanford, California, USA.	Carbohydrate import into seeds directly determines seed size and must have been increased through domestication. However, evidence of the domestication of sugar translocation and the identities of seed-filling transporters have been elusive. Maize ZmSWEET4c, as opposed to its sucrose-transporting homologs, mediates transepithelial hexose transport across the basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL), the entry point of nutrients into the seed, and shows signatures indicative of selection during domestication. Mutants of both maize ZmSWEET4c and its rice ortholog OsSWEET4 are defective in seed filling, indicating that a lack of hexose transport at the BETL impairs further transfer of sugars imported from the maternal phloem. In both maize and rice, SWEET4 was likely recruited during domestication to enhance sugar import into the endosperm.
NA	A Heat Stress Responsive NAC Transcription Factor Heterodimer Plays Key Roles in Rice Grain Filling	2021	J Exp Bot	College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	High temperature often leads to the failure of grain filling in rice (Oryza sativa) to cause yield loss, while the mechanism is not well elucidated yet. Here, we report that two seed-specific NAM/ATAF/CUC domain transcription factors, ONAC127 and ONAC129, are responsive to heat stress and involved in the grain filling process of rice. ONAC127 and ONAC129 are dominantly expressed in the pericarp and can form a heterodimer during rice grain filling. CRISPR/Cas9 induced mutants and overexpression lines were then generated to investigate the functions of these two transcription factors. Interestingly, both knock-out and overexpression plants showed incomplete grain filling and shrunken grains, which became more severe under heat stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed that ONAC127 and ONAC129 mainly regulate stimulus response and nutrient transport. ChIP-seq analysis identified that the direct targets of ONAC127 and ONAC129 in developing rice seeds include monosaccharide transporter OsMST6, sugar transporter OsSWEET4, calmodulin-like protein OsMSR2 and AP2/ERF factor OsEATB. These results suggest that ONAC127 and ONAC129 may regulate grain filling through affecting sugar transportation and abiotic stress responses. Overall, this study demonstrates a transcriptional regulatory network involving ONAC127 and ONAC129 and coordinating multiple pathways to modulate seed development and heat stress response at rice reproductive stage.
NA	MATE transporter GFD1 cooperates with sugar transporters, mediates carbohydrate partitioning and controls grain-filling duration, grain size and number in rice.	2022	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.	More than half of the world&#x27;s food is provided by cereals, as humans obtain &gt;60% of daily calories from grains. Producing more carbohydrates is always the final target of crop cultivation. The carbohydrate partitioning pathway directly affects grain yield, but the molecular mechanisms and biological functions are poorly understood, including rice (Oryza sativa L.), one of the most important food sources. Here, we reported a prolonged grain filling duration mutant 1 (gfd1), exhibiting a long grain-filling duration, less grain number per panicle and bigger grain size without changing grain weight. Map-based cloning and molecular biological analyses revealed that GFD1 encoded a MATE transporter and expressed high in vascular tissues of the stem, spikelet hulls and rachilla, but low in the leaf, controlling carbohydrate partitioning in the stem and grain but not in the leaf. GFD1 protein was partially localized on the plasma membrane and in the Golgi apparatus, and was finally verified to interact with two sugar transporters, OsSWEET4 and OsSUT2. Genetic analyses showed that GFD1 might control grain-filling duration through OsSWEET4, adjust grain size with OsSUT2 and synergistically modulate grain number per panicle with both OsSUT2 and OsSWEET4. Together, our work proved that the three transporters, which are all initially classified in the major facilitator superfamily family, could control starch storage in both the primary sink (grain) and temporary sink (stem), and affect carbohydrate partitioning in the whole plant through physical interaction, giving a new vision of sugar transporter interactome and providing a tool for rice yield improvement.
