The rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome contains at least six genes exclusively with an SPX (SYG1/PHO81/XPR1) domain at the N-terminal, designated as OsSPX1-6. Here we report the diverse expression patterns of the OsSPX genes in different tissues and their responses to Pi-starvation. Among them, five genes, OsSPX1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 are responsive to Pi-starvation in shoots and/or in roots. The subcellular localization analysis indicates that OsSPX1 and OsSPX2 is exclusively located in nucleus, OsSPX3 in the cytoplasm, and OsSPX4 is a membrane localization protein. OsSPX1 regulates OsSPX2, 3 and 5 at the transcription level and is positively involved in the responses of the genes to Pi-starvation. Overexpression of OsSPX3 downregulates OsSPX5 in shoots under Pi-sufficiency. OsSPX3 negatively regulates the PSI (Pi-starvation induced) gene, OsIPS1 and is involved in the responses of miR399 and OsPHO2 to Pi-starvation. Our results suggest that OsSPX1 may be a regulator involved in the transcriptions of OsSPX2, 3 and 5. OsSPX3 plays a role in OsIPS1/miR399 mediated long distance regulation on OsPHO2. Our results also indicate that OsSPX3 is involved in plant tolerance to Pi-starvation stress.
NA	Rice SPX6 negatively regulates the phosphate starvation response through suppression of the transcription factor PHR2.	2018	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development, but the molecular mechanism determining how plants sense external inorganic phosphate (Pi) levels and reprogram transcriptional and adaptive responses is incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the function of OsSPX6 (hereafter SPX6), an uncharacterized member of SPX domain (SYG1, Pho81 and XPR1)-containing proteins in rice, using reverse genetics and biochemical approaches. Transgenic plants overexpressing SPX6 exhibited decreased Pi concentrations and suppression of phosphate starvation-induced (PSI) genes. By contrast, transgenic lines with decreased SPX6 transcript levels or spx6 mutant showed significant Pi accumulation in the leaf and upregulation of PSI genes. Overexpression of SPX6 genetically suppressed the overexpression of PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE REGULATOR 2 (PHR2) in terms of the accumulation of high Pi content. Moreover, direct interaction of SPX6 with PHR2 impeded PHR2 translocation into the nucleus, and inhibited PHR2 binding to the P1BS (PHR1 binding sequence) element. SPX6 protein was degraded in leaves under Pi-deficient conditions, whereas it accumulated in roots. We conclude that rice SPX6 is another important negative regulator in Pi starvation signaling through the interaction with PHR2. SPX6 shows different responses to Pi starvation in shoot and root, which differ from those of other SPX proteins.
