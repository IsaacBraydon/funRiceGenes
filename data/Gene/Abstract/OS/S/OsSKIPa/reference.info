Abiotic stresses are major limiting factors for growth, development, and productivity of crop plants. Here, we report on OsSKIPa, a rice homolog of human Ski-interacting protein (SKIP) that can complement the lethal defect of the knockout mutant of SKIP homolog in yeast and positively modulate cell viability and stress tolerance of rice. Suppression of OsSKIPa in rice resulted in growth arrest and reduced cell viability. The expression OsSKIPa is induced by various abiotic stresses and phytohormone treatments. Transgenic rice overexpressing OsSKIPa exhibited significantly improved growth performance in the medium containing stress agents (abscisic acid, salt, or mannitol) and drought resistance at both the seedling and reproductive stages. The OsSKIPa-overexpressing rice showed significantly increased reactive oxygen species-scavenging ability and transcript levels of many stress-related genes, including SNAC1 and rice homologs of CBF2, PP2C, and RD22, under drought stress conditions. More than 30 OsSKIPa-interacting proteins were identified, but most of these proteins have no matches with the reported SKIP-interacting proteins in animals and yeast. Together, these data suggest that OsSKIPa has evolved a specific function in positive modulation of stress resistance through transcriptional regulation of diverse stress-related genes in rice.
psb-6-1684.pdf	OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice	2011	Plant Signal Behav	State Laboratory for Biology of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests, Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation has been well demonstrated as a key regulatory mechanism in response to drought stress in Arabidopsis. However, the biological function of most E3 ligase genes in drought response is still unknown in rice. We recently showed that OsDIS1 (Oryza sativa drought-induced SINA protein 1), a SINA type E3 ligase, is involved in the drought-stress signal transduction in rice. OsDIS1 plays a negative role in drought stress tolerance through the transcriptional regulation of diverse stress-related genes and also possibly through the posttranslational regulation of its interacting protein OsNek6 in rice. Here we also show that OsDIS1 interacts with OsSKIPa, a drought and salt stress positive regulator in rice. Based on these results, we propose a working model for the function of OsDIS1 in regulating the stress signaling pathway in rice.
