OsNAC19|SNAC1|OsNAC9	OsSKIPa	A homolog of human ski-interacting protein in rice positively regulates cell viability and stress tolerance	The OsSKIPa-overexpressing rice showed significantly increased reactive oxygen species-scavenging ability and transcript levels of many stress-related genes, including SNAC1 and rice homologs of CBF2, PP2C, and RD22, under drought stress conditions
OsDIS1	OsSKIPa	OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice	Here we also show that OsDIS1 interacts with OsSKIPa, a drought and salt stress positive regulator in rice
