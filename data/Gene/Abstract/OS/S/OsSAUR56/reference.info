GRID: grid.20561.30. ISNI: 0000 0000 9546 5767	Heading date is a critical agronomic trait that determines crop yield. Although numerous genes associated with heading date have been identified in rice, the mechanisms involving Small Auxin Up RNA (SAUR) family have not been elucidated. In this study, the biological function of several SAUR genes was initially investigated using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology in the Japonica cultivar Zhonghua11 (ZH11) background. Further analysis revealed that the loss-of-function of OsSAUR56 affected heading date in both NLD (natural long-day) and ASD (artificial short-day). OsSAUR56 exhibited predominant expression in the anther, with its protein localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. OsSAUR56 regulated flowering time and heading date by modulating the expression of the clock gene OsGI, as well as two repressors Ghd7 and DTH8. Furthermore, haplotype-phenotype association analysis revealed a strong correlation between OsSAUR56 and heading date, suggesting its role in selection during the domestication of rice. In summary, these findings highlights the importance of OsSAUR56 in the regulation of heading date for further potential facilitating genetic engineering for flowering time during rice breeding.
