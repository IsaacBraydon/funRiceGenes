OsSYT-5	pollen	Enhancement of drought tolerance in rice by silencing of the OsSYT-5 gene.	 Transgenic lines with suppressed OsSYT-5 gene expression exhibited higher pollen viability and produced more grains compared to the wild type at both normal and drought stress conditions
OsSYT-5	drought	Enhancement of drought tolerance in rice by silencing of the OsSYT-5 gene.	Enhancement of drought tolerance in rice by silencing of the OsSYT-5 gene.
OsSYT-5	drought	Enhancement of drought tolerance in rice by silencing of the OsSYT-5 gene.	 In the water deficit experiment, the transgenic lines with a silenced OsSYT-5 gene exhibited symptoms of drought stress seven days later than the wild type
