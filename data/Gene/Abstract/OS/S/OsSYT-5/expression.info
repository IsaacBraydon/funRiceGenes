OsSYT-5	 Transgenic lines with suppressed expression of the OsSYT-5 gene exhibited an enhanced photosynthetic rate but reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration during water deficit stress |  The silencing of the OsSYT-5 gene affected the expression of several genes associated with ABA-related stress signaling in the transgenic rice plants |  Transgenic lines with suppressed OsSYT-5 gene expression exhibited higher pollen viability and produced more grains compared to the wild type at both normal and drought stress conditions
