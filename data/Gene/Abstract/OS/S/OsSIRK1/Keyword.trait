OsSIRK1	disease	BRHIS1 suppresses rice innate immunity through binding to monoubiquitinated H2A and H2B variants.	 The BRHIS1-containing complex represses the expression of some disease defense-related genes, including the pathogenesis-related gene OsPBZc and the leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) receptor-like protein kinase gene OsSIRK1
