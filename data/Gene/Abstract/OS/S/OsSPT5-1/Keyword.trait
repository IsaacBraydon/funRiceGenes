OsSPT5-1	transcription factor	Transcription elongation factors OsSPT4 and OsSPT5 are essential for rice growth and development and act with APO2.	 Furthermore, OsSPT5-1 interacts with the transcription factor ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2 (APO2) and plays a similar role in regulating the growth of rice shoots
OsSPT5-1	growth	Transcription elongation factors OsSPT4 and OsSPT5 are essential for rice growth and development and act with APO2.	 Loss-of-function mutants of OsSPT4 and OsSPT5-1 could not be obtained; their heterozygotes showed severe reproductive growth defects
OsSPT5-1	growth	Transcription elongation factors OsSPT4 and OsSPT5 are essential for rice growth and development and act with APO2.	 Furthermore, OsSPT5-1 interacts with the transcription factor ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2 (APO2) and plays a similar role in regulating the growth of rice shoots
OsSPT5-1	panicle	Transcription elongation factors OsSPT4 and OsSPT5 are essential for rice growth and development and act with APO2.	 Furthermore, OsSPT5-1 interacts with the transcription factor ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2 (APO2) and plays a similar role in regulating the growth of rice shoots
OsSPT5-1	cytokinin	Transcription elongation factors OsSPT4 and OsSPT5 are essential for rice growth and development and act with APO2.	 RNA sequencing analysis verified that OsSPT5-1 is involved in multiple phytohormone pathways, including gibberellin, auxin, and cytokinin
OsSPT5-1	reproductive	Transcription elongation factors OsSPT4 and OsSPT5 are essential for rice growth and development and act with APO2.	 Loss-of-function mutants of OsSPT4 and OsSPT5-1 could not be obtained; their heterozygotes showed severe reproductive growth defects
OsSPT5-1	phytohormone	Transcription elongation factors OsSPT4 and OsSPT5 are essential for rice growth and development and act with APO2.	 RNA sequencing analysis verified that OsSPT5-1 is involved in multiple phytohormone pathways, including gibberellin, auxin, and cytokinin
OsSPT5-1	reproductive growth	Transcription elongation factors OsSPT4 and OsSPT5 are essential for rice growth and development and act with APO2.	 Loss-of-function mutants of OsSPT4 and OsSPT5-1 could not be obtained; their heterozygotes showed severe reproductive growth defects
