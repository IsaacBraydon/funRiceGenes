OsSPT5-1	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	Transcription elongation factors OsSPT4 and OsSPT5 are essential for rice growth and development and act with APO2.	The transcription elongation factor SPT4/SPT5 complex is essential for rice vegetative and reproductive growth and that OsSPT5-1, with its interactor APO2, is involved in multiple phytohormone pathways
OsSPT5-1	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	Transcription elongation factors OsSPT4 and OsSPT5 are essential for rice growth and development and act with APO2.	 Furthermore, OsSPT5-1 interacts with the transcription factor ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2 (APO2) and plays a similar role in regulating the growth of rice shoots
