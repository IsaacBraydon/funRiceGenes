OsSAUR33	 Expression of OsSAUR33 was higher in mature grains and early germinating seeds |  OsSAUR33 interacted with the sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase OsSnRK1A, a regulator of the sugar signaling pathway, which influences the expression of sugar signaling-related genes during germination
