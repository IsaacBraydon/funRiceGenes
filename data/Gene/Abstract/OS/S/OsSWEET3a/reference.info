NA	The dual function of OsSWEET3a as a gibberellin and glucose transporter is important for young shoot development in rice	2020	Plant Cell Physiol	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.	Translocation and long-distance transport of phytohormones are considered important processes for phytohormone responses as well as their synthesis and signaling. Here, we report on the dual function of OsSWEET3a, a bidirectional sugar transporter from Clade I of the rice SWEET family of proteins, as both a gibberellin (GA) and a glucose transporter. OsSWEET3a efficiently transports GAs in the C13-hydroxylation pathway of GA biosynthesis. Both knockout and overexpression lines of OsSWEET3a showed defects in germination and early shoot development, which were partially restored by GA, especially GA20. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR, GUS staining, and in situ hybridization revealed that OsSWEET3a was expressed in vascular bundles in basal parts of the seedlings. OsSWEET3a expression co-localized with OsGA20ox1 expression in the vascular bundles but not with OsGA3ox2, whose expression was restricted to leaf primordia and young leaves. These results suggest that OsSWEET3a is expressed in the vascular tissue of basal parts of seedlings and is involved in the transport of both GA20 and glucose to young leaves, where GA20 is possibly converted to the bioactive GA1 form by OsGA3ox2, during early plant development. We also indicated that such GA transport activities of SWEET proteins have sporadically appeared in the evolution of plants: GA transporters in Arabidopsis evolved from sucrose transporters, while those in rice and sorghum have evolved from glucose transporters.
