NA	The dual function of OsSWEET3a as a gibberellin and glucose transporter is important for young shoot development in rice	2020	Plant Cell Physiol	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.	Translocation and long-distance transport of phytohormones are considered important processes for phytohormone responses as well as their synthesis and signaling. Here, we report on the dual function of OsSWEET3a, a bidirectional sugar transporter from Clade I of the rice SWEET family of proteins, as both a gibberellin (GA) and a glucose transporter. OsSWEET3a efficiently transports GAs in the C13-hydroxylation pathway of GA biosynthesis. Both knockout and overexpression lines of OsSWEET3a showed defects in germination and early shoot development, which were partially restored by GA, especially GA20. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR, GUS staining, and in situ hybridization revealed that OsSWEET3a was expressed in vascular bundles in basal parts of the seedlings. OsSWEET3a expression co-localized with OsGA20ox1 expression in the vascular bundles but not with OsGA3ox2, whose expression was restricted to leaf primordia and young leaves. These results suggest that OsSWEET3a is expressed in the vascular tissue of basal parts of seedlings and is involved in the transport of both GA20 and glucose to young leaves, where GA20 is possibly converted to the bioactive GA1 form by OsGA3ox2, during early plant development. We also indicated that such GA transport activities of SWEET proteins have sporadically appeared in the evolution of plants: GA transporters in Arabidopsis evolved from sucrose transporters, while those in rice and sorghum have evolved from glucose transporters.
NA	Mutation of OsSAC3, Encoding the Xanthine Dehydrogenase, Caused Early Senescence in Rice.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	Rice Research Institute, Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.	In both animals and higher plants, xanthine dehydrogenase is a highly conserved housekeeping enzyme in purine degradation where it oxidizes hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Previous reports demonstrated that xanthine dehydrogenase played a vital role in N metabolism and stress response. Is xanthine dehydrogenase involved in regulating leaf senescence? A recessive early senescence mutant with excess sugar accumulation, ossac3, was isolated previously by screening the EMS-induced mutant library. Here, we show that xanthine dehydrogenase not only plays a role in N metabolism but also involved in regulating carbon metabolism in rice. Based on map-based cloning, OsSAC3 was identified, which encodes the xanthine dehydrogenase. OsSAC3 was constitutively expressed in all examined tissues and the OsSAC3 protein located in the cytoplasm. Transcriptional analysis revealed purine metabolism, chlorophyll metabolism, photosynthesis, sugar metabolism and redox balance were affected in the ossac3 mutant. Moreover, carbohydrate distribution was changed, leading to the accumulation of sucrose and starch in the leaves containing ossac3 on account of decreased expression of OsSWEET3a, OsSWEET6a and OsSWEET14 and oxidized inactivation of starch degradation enzymes in ossac3. These results indicated that OsSAC3 played a vital role in leaf senescence by regulating carbon metabolism in rice.
