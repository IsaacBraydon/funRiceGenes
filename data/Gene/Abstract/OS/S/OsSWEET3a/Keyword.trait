OsSWEET3a	leaf	The dual function of OsSWEET3a as a gibberellin and glucose transporter is important for young shoot development in rice	 OsSWEET3a expression co-localized with OsGA20ox1 expression in the vascular bundles but not with OsGA3ox2, whose expression was restricted to leaf primordia and young leaves
OsSWEET3a	seedlings	The dual function of OsSWEET3a as a gibberellin and glucose transporter is important for young shoot development in rice	 Quantitative reverse transcription PCR, GUS staining, and in situ hybridization revealed that OsSWEET3a was expressed in vascular bundles in basal parts of the seedlings
OsSWEET3a	seedlings	The dual function of OsSWEET3a as a gibberellin and glucose transporter is important for young shoot development in rice	 These results suggest that OsSWEET3a is expressed in the vascular tissue of basal parts of seedlings and is involved in the transport of both GA20 and glucose to young leaves, where GA20 is possibly converted to the bioactive GA1 form by OsGA3ox2, during early plant development
