Symbol	Expression	Overexpression
OsSYP121	 OsSYP121 is plasma membrane-localized and its expression was obviously induced by the rice blast in both the blast-resistant rice landrace Hei (Heikezijing) and the blast-susceptible landrace Su (Suyunuo) |  Overexpression of OsSYP121 in Su resulted in enhanced resistance to blast |  Knockdown of OsSYP121 expression in Su resulted in a more susceptible phenotype |  However, knockdown of OsSYP121 expression in the resistant cultivar Hei resulted in susceptibility to the blast fungus	 Overexpression of OsSYP121 in Su resulted in enhanced resistance to blast
