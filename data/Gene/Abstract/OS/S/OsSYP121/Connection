OsSNAP32	OsSYP121	OsSYP121 accumulates at fungi penetration sites and mediates host resistance to rice blast.	 Yeast two-hybrid results showed that OsSYP121 can interact with OsSNAP32 (Synaptosome-associated protein of 32 kDa) and OsVAMP714/724 (Vesicle-associated membrane protein714/724)
OsSNAP32	OsSYP121	OsSYP121 accumulates at fungi penetration sites and mediates host resistance to rice blast.	 The interaction between OsSYP121 and OsSNAP32 may contribute to host resistance to rice blast
