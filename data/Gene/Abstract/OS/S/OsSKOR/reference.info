NA	Differential gene expression of two outward-rectifying shaker-like potassium channels OsSKOR and OsGORK in rice	2015	Journal of Plant Biology	Molecular Breeding DivisionNational Academy of Agricultural Science, RDAJeonjuKorea	Shaker-like potassium channels are highly conserved voltage-dependent ion channels in plants. Rice, a monocot model plant, has similar numbers of shaker-like potassium channels as Arabidopsis. Although several inward-rectifying potassium channels have been identified, no outward-rectifying potassium channels have yet been reported for rice. Here, we identified two outward-rectifying shaker-like potassium channels in rice, with high amino acid sequence similarities to Arabidopsis stelar K+ outward rectifier (SKOR) and guard cell outward rectifying K+ channel (GORK). To characterize these channels we monitored their expression patterns in several tissues. qRTPCR and promoter-GUS analysis showed that OsSKOR is expressed in root vascular tissues, flower, and seed scutellum. OsGORK was expressed to some degree in most tissues, such as leaf blade, node, leaf sheath and root, but at high levels in flowers. This is the first report characterizing rice outward-rectifying potassium channels and contributes to understanding the regulation of potassium homeostasis in monocot plants.
NA	Silicon alleviates salt stress-induced potassium deficiency by promoting potassium uptake and translocation in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2021	J Plant Physiol	Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Environment Remediation and Ecological Health, College of Environmental & Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Under salt stress, plants suffer from potassium (K) deficiency caused by excess salts in growth substrate. Silicon (Si) can promote K status in many plant species under salt stress, however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we assessed the effects of Si on K homeostasis in rice under salt stress and investigated the mechanisms behind using two low-Si rice mutants (lsi1 and lsi2) and their wild types (WTs). After five days' treatment with Si, plant growth was improved and salt stress-induced K deficiency was alleviated in WTs but not in mutants. Simultaneously, Si significantly enhanced K accumulation content, K uptake index and shoot K distribution rate in WTs but not in mutants. Besides, Si enhanced K concentration in xylem sap in WTs but not in mutants. Scanning ion-selected electrode technique (SIET) analysis showed net K influx rate was raised by Si addition under salt stress in WTs but not in mutants. Moreover, Si up-regulated the expression of genes responsible for K uptake (OsAKT1 and OsHAK1) and xylem loading (OsSKOR) in WTs but not in mutants. Overall, our results strongly indicate that Si can improve K uptake and translocation by up-regulating the expression of relevant genes, thereby promoting K status and alleviating salt stress in rice.
