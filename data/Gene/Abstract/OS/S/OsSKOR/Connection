OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsSKOR	OsNAC2 positively affects salt-induced cell death and binds to the OsAP37 and OsCOX11 promoters.	 Furthermore, K+-efflux channels (OsGORK and OsSKOR) were obviously activated by OsNAC2
OsAKT1	OsSKOR	Silicon alleviates salt stress-induced potassium deficiency by promoting potassium uptake and translocation in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Moreover, Si up-regulated the expression of genes responsible for K uptake (OsAKT1 and OsHAK1) and xylem loading (OsSKOR) in WTs but not in mutants
OsHAK1	OsSKOR	Silicon alleviates salt stress-induced potassium deficiency by promoting potassium uptake and translocation in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Moreover, Si up-regulated the expression of genes responsible for K uptake (OsAKT1 and OsHAK1) and xylem loading (OsSKOR) in WTs but not in mutants
