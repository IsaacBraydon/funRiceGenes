MYB61|OsMYB61	OsSND2	OsSND2, a NAC family transcription factor, is involved in secondary cell wall biosynthesis through regulating MYBs expression in rice	We used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (ChIP) to  further confirm that OsSND2 can directly bind to the promoter of OsMYB61 both in  vitro and in vivo
