OsSND2	OsSND2, a NAC family transcription factor, is involved in secondary cell wall biosynthesis through regulating MYBs expression in rice. |  Expression pattern analysis indicated that OsSND2 was mainly expressed in internodes and panicles |  Overexpression of OsSND2 resulted in rolled leaf, increased cellulose content and up-regulated expression of SCWs related genes |  The knockout of OsSND2 using CRISPR/Cas9 system decreased cellulose content and down-regulated the expression of SCWs related genes	 Overexpression of OsSND2 resulted in rolled leaf, increased cellulose content and up-regulated expression of SCWs related genes
