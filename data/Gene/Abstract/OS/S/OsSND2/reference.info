As one of the most important staple food crops, rice produces huge agronomic biomass residues that contain lots of secondary cell walls (SCWs) comprising cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. The transcriptional regulation mechanism underlying SCWs biosynthesis remains elusive.In this study, we isolated a NAC family transcription factor (TF), OsSND2 through yeast one-hybrid screening using the secondary wall NAC-binding element (SNBE) on the promoter region of OsMYB61 which is known transcription factor for regulation of SCWs biosynthesis as bait. We used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (ChIP) to further confirm that OsSND2 can directly bind to the promoter of OsMYB61 both in vitro and in vivo. OsSND2, a close homolog of AtSND2, is localized in the nucleus and has transcriptional activation activity. Expression pattern analysis indicated that OsSND2 was mainly expressed in internodes and panicles. Overexpression of OsSND2 resulted in rolled leaf, increased cellulose content and up-regulated expression of SCWs related genes. The knockout of OsSND2 using CRISPR/Cas9 system decreased cellulose content and down-regulated the expression of SCWs related genes. Furthermore, OsSND2 can also directly bind to the promoters of other MYB family TFs by transactivation analysis in yeast cells and rice protoplasts. Altogether, our findings suggest that OsSND2 may function as a master regulator to mediate SCWs biosynthesis.OsSND2 was identified as a positive regulator of cellulose biosynthesis in rice. An increase in the expression level of this gene can improve the SCWs cellulose content. Therefore, the study of the function of OsSND2 can provide a strategy for manipulating plant biomass production.
