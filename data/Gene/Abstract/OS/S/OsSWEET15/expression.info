OsSWEET15	 Expression analyses of SWEET genes and histochemical analysis of ¦Â-glucuronidase-reporter transgenic plants suggested that OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 are major SWEET transporters regulating the sucrose transport and levels in response to the abiotic stresses |  Transactivation analyses showed that an abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 directly binds to the promoters of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 and activates their expression |  Taken together, the results showed that the higher expressions of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 genes, induced by binding of an ABA-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 to the promoters, potentially modulate sucrose transport and distribution in response to the abiotic stresses
OsSWEET15	 Notably, the ovaries in the blighted grains of the ossweet15 mutants expanded after flowering but terminated their development before the endosperm cellularization stage and subsequently glucuronidase (GUS) and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter lines representing the OsSWEET15 expression showed that the gene was expressed in the endosperm tissues surrounding the embryo, which supposedly supplies nutrients to sustain embryo development
