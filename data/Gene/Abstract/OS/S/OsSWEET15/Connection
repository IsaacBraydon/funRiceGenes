OsbZIP72|OsABF4	OsSWEET15	Sucrose transport in response to drought and salt stress involves ABA-mediated induction of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 in rice	 Transactivation analyses showed that an abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 directly binds to the promoters of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 and activates their expression
OsbZIP72|OsABF4	OsSWEET15	Sucrose transport in response to drought and salt stress involves ABA-mediated induction of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 in rice	 Taken together, the results showed that the higher expressions of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 genes, induced by binding of an ABA-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 to the promoters, potentially modulate sucrose transport and distribution in response to the abiotic stresses
OsSWEET15	Xa25|OsSWEET13	Sucrose transport in response to drought and salt stress involves ABA-mediated induction of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 in rice	Sucrose transport in response to drought and salt stress involves ABA-mediated induction of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 in rice
OsSWEET15	Xa25|OsSWEET13	Sucrose transport in response to drought and salt stress involves ABA-mediated induction of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 in rice	 Expression analyses of SWEET genes and histochemical analysis of ¦Â-glucuronidase-reporter transgenic plants suggested that OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 are major SWEET transporters regulating the sucrose transport and levels in response to the abiotic stresses
OsSWEET15	Xa25|OsSWEET13	Sucrose transport in response to drought and salt stress involves ABA-mediated induction of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 in rice	 Transactivation analyses showed that an abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 directly binds to the promoters of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 and activates their expression
OsSWEET15	Xa25|OsSWEET13	Sucrose transport in response to drought and salt stress involves ABA-mediated induction of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 in rice	 Taken together, the results showed that the higher expressions of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 genes, induced by binding of an ABA-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 to the promoters, potentially modulate sucrose transport and distribution in response to the abiotic stresses
Os8N3|xa13|OsSWEET11	OsSWEET15	Knockout of OsSWEET15 Impairs Rice Embryo Formation and Seed-Setting.	 Investigation of ossweet11 mutant grains revealed similar phenotypes to those observed in the ossweet15 mutants
Os8N3|xa13|OsSWEET11	OsSWEET15	Knockout of OsSWEET15 Impairs Rice Embryo Formation and Seed-Setting.	 These results indicate that both OsSWEET15 and OsSWEET11 play important and similar roles in rice pollen development, caryopsis formation and seed-setting, in addition to their function in seed-filling that was demonstrated previously
