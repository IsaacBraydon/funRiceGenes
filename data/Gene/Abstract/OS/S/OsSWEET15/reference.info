NA	SWEET11 and 15 as key players in seed filling in rice.	2018	New Phytol	Institute for Molecular Physiology, Heinrich-Heine University Duesseldorf, 40225, Duesseldorf, Germany.	Despite the relevance of seed-filling mechanisms for crop yield, we still have only a rudimentary understanding of the transport processes that supply the caryopsis with sugars. We hypothesized that SWEET sucrose transporters may play important roles in nutrient import pathways in the rice caryopsis. We used a combination of mRNA quantification, histochemical analyses, translational promoter-reporter fusions and analysis of knockout mutants created by genomic editing to evaluate the contribution of SWEET transporters to seed filling. In rice caryopses, SWEET11 and 15 had the highest mRNA levels and proteins localized to four key sites: all regions of the nucellus at early stages; the nucellar projection close to the dorsal vein; the nucellar epidermis that surrounds the endosperm; and the aleurone. ossweet11;15 double knockout lines accumulated starch in the pericarp, whereas caryopses did not contain a functional endosperm. Jointly, SWEET11 and 15 show all the hallmarks of being necessary for seed filling with sucrose efflux functions at the nucellar projection and a role in transfer across the nucellar epidermis/aleurone interface, delineating two major steps for apoplasmic seed filling, observations that are discussed in relation to observations made in rice and barley regarding the relative prevalence of these two potential import routes.
NA	Sucrose transport in response to drought and salt stress involves ABA-mediated induction of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 in rice	2020	Physiol Plant	National Institute of Plant Genome Research, New Delhi, India.	Abiotic stresses, including drought and salinity, negatively affect plant development and physiology at molecular and metabolic levels. Sucrose transport, mediating distribution of photosynthates in plant, is a key physiological process impacted by drought and salinity stresses, as sucrose is a prime energy and signaling molecule as well as an osmolyte. Therefore, understanding the effects of abiotic stresses on sucrose transport and transporters, and underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms, is imperative to maintain sugar homeostasis in plants under stress. Here, we investigated the effects of drought and salinity stresses on sucrose transport and distribution, and on expression levels of genes encoding Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters (SWEETs), along with a potential transcription factor regulating SWEET expression in rice. We observed that drought and salinity stresses increased the sucrose content in leaf and root tissues and in phloem sap of rice indica varieties. Expression analyses of SWEET genes and histochemical analysis of ¦Â-glucuronidase-reporter transgenic plants suggested that OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 are major SWEET transporters regulating the sucrose transport and levels in response to the abiotic stresses. Transactivation analyses showed that an abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 directly binds to the promoters of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 and activates their expression. Taken together, the results showed that the higher expressions of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 genes, induced by binding of an ABA-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 to the promoters, potentially modulate sucrose transport and distribution in response to the abiotic stresses. The mechanism could possibly be targeted for maintaining sugar homeostasis in rice under drought and salinity stresses.
