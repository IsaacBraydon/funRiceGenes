OsSWEET15	seed filling	SWEET11 and 15 as key players in seed filling in rice.	SWEET11 and 15 as key players in seed filling in rice.
OsSWEET15	seed filling	SWEET11 and 15 as key players in seed filling in rice.	OsSWEET11 and 15 are essential for seed filling
OsSWEET15	sucrose translocation	SWEET11 and 15 as key players in seed filling in rice.	The accumulation of starch in the pericarp of ossweet11 and ossweet11;15 double mutants supports the critical roles of OsSWEET11 and OsSWEET15 in sucrose translocation and mobilization towards the developing endosperm.
OsSWEET15	transcription factor	Sucrose transport in response to drought and salt stress involves ABA-mediated induction of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 in rice	 Transactivation analyses showed that an abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 directly binds to the promoters of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 and activates their expression
OsSWEET15	transcription factor	Sucrose transport in response to drought and salt stress involves ABA-mediated induction of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 in rice	 Taken together, the results showed that the higher expressions of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 genes, induced by binding of an ABA-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 to the promoters, potentially modulate sucrose transport and distribution in response to the abiotic stresses
