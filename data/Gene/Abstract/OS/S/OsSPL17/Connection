OsMADS5	OsSPL17	OsMADS5 interacts with OsSPL14/17 to inhibit rice root elongation by restricting cell proliferation of root meristem under ammonium supply.	 We also found that OsMADS5 interacted with OsSPL14 and OsSPL17 (OsSPL14/17) to repress their transcriptional activation by attenuating DNA binding ability
