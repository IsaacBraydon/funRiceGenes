NA	Rice microRNA156/529-SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE7/14/17 modules regulate defenses against bacteria.	2023	Plant Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Hubei Hongshan Laboratory, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) microRNA156/529-SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE7/14/17 (miR156/529-SPL7/14/17) modules have pleiotropic effects on many biological pathways. OsSPL7/14 can interact with DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1) to modulate gibberellin acid (GA) signal transduction against the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. However, whether the miR156/529-OsSPL7/14/17 modules also regulate resistance against other pathogens is unclear. Notably, OsSPL7/14/17 functioning as transcriptional activators, their target genes, and the corresponding downstream signaling pathways remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that miR156/529 play negative roles in plant immunity and that miR156/529-regulated OsSPL7/14/17 confer broad-spectrum resistance against two devastating bacterial pathogens. Three OsSPL7/14/17 proteins directly bind to the promoters of rice Allene Oxide Synthases 2 (OsAOS2) and NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES1 (OsNPR1) and activate their transcription, regulating jasmonic acid (JA) accumulation and the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway, respectively. Overexpression of OsAOS2 or OsNPR1 impairs the susceptibility of the osspl7/14/17 triple mutant. Exogenous application of JA enhances resistance of the osspl7/14/17 triple mutant and the miR156 overexpressing plants. In addition, genetic evidence confirms that bacterial pathogen-activated miR156/529 negatively regulate pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) responses, such as pattern recognition receptor Xa3/Xa26-initiated PTI. Our findings demonstrate that bacterial pathogens modulate miR156/529-OsSPL7/14/17 modules to suppress OsAOS2-catalyzed JA accumulation and the OsNPR1-promoted SA signaling pathway, facilitating pathogen infection. The uncovered miR156/529-OsSPL7/14/17-OsAOS2/OsNPR1 regulatory network provides a potential strategy to genetically improve rice disease resistance.
NA	OsMADS5 interacts with OsSPL14/17 to inhibit rice root elongation by restricting cell proliferation of root meristem under ammonium supply.	2023	Plant J	Key Laboratory of Rice Biology in Henan Province, Collaborative Innovation Center of Henan Grain Crops, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 450046, China.	Nitrogen (N) is a vital major nutrient for rice (Oryza sativa). Rice responds to different applications of N by altering its root morphology, including root elongation. Although ammonium ( NH4+ ) is the primary source of N for rice, NH4+ is toxic to rice roots and inhibits root elongation. However, the precise molecular mechanism that NH4+ -inhibited root elongation of rice is not well understood. Here, we identified a rice T-DNA insert mutant of OsMADS5 with a longer seminal root (SR) under sufficient N conditions. Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the expression level of OsMADS5 was supply. Under NH4+ conditions, knocking out OsMADS5 (cas9) produced a longer SR, phenocopying osmads5, while there was no supply. Moreover, OsMADS5-overexpression plants displayed the opposite SR phenotype. Further study demonstrated that enhancement of OsMADS5 by NH4+ supply inhibited rice SR elongation, likely by reducing root meristem activity of root tip, with the involvement of OsCYCB1;1. We also found that OsMADS5 interacted with OsSPL14 and OsSPL17 (OsSPL14/17) to repress their transcriptional activation by attenuating DNA binding ability. Moreover, loss of OsSPL14/17 function in osmads5 eliminated its stimulative effect on SR elongation under NH4+ conditions, implying OsSPL14/17 may function downstream of OsMADS5 to mediate rice SR elongation under NH4+ supply. Overall, our results indicate the existence of a novel modulatory pathway in which enhancement of OsMADS5 by NH4+ supply represses the transcriptional activities of OsSPL14/17 to restrict SR elongation of rice.
