OsSHR2	leaf	SHORTROOT-mediated increase in stomatal density has no impact on photosynthetic efficiency.	 To test whether the pathway has the potential to similarly pattern epidermal cell-types, we expanded the expression domain of the rice OsSHR2 gene, which we show is restricted to developing leaf veins, to include bundle sheath cells encircling the vein
