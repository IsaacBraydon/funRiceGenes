NA	A plausible mechanism, based upon Short-Root movement, for regulating the number of cortex cell layers in roots	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104	Formation of specialized cells and tissues at defined times and in specific positions is essential for the development of multicellular organisms. Often this developmental precision is achieved through intercellular signaling networks, which establish patterns of differential gene expression and ultimately the specification of distinct cell fates. Here we address the question of how the Short-root (SHR) proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtSHR), Brachypodium distachyon (BdSHR), and Oryza sativa (OsSHR1 and OsSHR2) function in patterning the root ground tissue. We find that all of the SHR proteins function as mobile signals in A. thaliana and all of the SHR homologs physically interact with the AtSHR binding protein, Scarecow (SCR). Unlike AtSHR, movement of the SHR homologs was not limited to the endodermis. Instead, the SHR proteins moved multiple cell layers and determined the number of cortex, not endodermal, cell layers formed in the root. Our results in A. thaliana are consistent with a mechanism by which the regulated movement of the SHR transcription factor determines the number of cortex cell layers produced in the roots of B. distachyon and O. sativa. These data also provide a new model for ground tissue patterning in A. thaliana in which the ability to form a functional endodermis is spatially limited independently of SHR.
NA	SHR overexpression induces the formation of supernumerary cell layers with cortex cell identity in rice.	2017	Dev Biol	CIRAD, UMR AGAP, 34398 Montpellier Cedex 5 France.	The number of root cortex cell layers varies among plants, and many species have several cortical cell layers. We recently demonstrated that the two rice orthologs of the Arabidopsis SHR gene, OsSHR1 and OsSHR2, could complement the A. thaliana shr mutant. Moreover, OsSHR1 and OsSHR2 expression in A. thaliana roots induced the formation of extra root cortical cell layers. In this article, we demonstrate that the overexpression of AtSHR and OsSHR2 in rice roots leads to plants with wide and short roots that contain a high number of extra cortical cell layers. We hypothesize that SHR genes may share a conserved function in the control of cortical cell layer division and the number of ground tissue cell layers in land plants.
NA	SHORTROOT-mediated increase in stomatal density has no impact on photosynthetic efficiency.	2017	Plant Physiol	University of Oxford CITY: Oxford OX1 3RB United Kingdom [GB].	The co-ordinated positioning of veins, mesophyll cells and stomata across a leaf is crucial for efficient gas exchange and transpiration, and therefore for overall function. In monocot leaves, stomatal cell files are positioned at the flanks of underlying longitudinal leaf veins, rather than directly above or below. This pattern suggests either that stomatal formation is inhibited in epidermal cells directly in contact with the vein, or that specification is induced in cells files beyond the vein. The SHORTROOT pathway specifies distinct cell-types around the vasculature in sub-epidermal layers of both root and shoots, with cell-type identity determined by distance from the vein. To test whether the pathway has the potential to similarly pattern epidermal cell-types, we expanded the expression domain of the rice OsSHR2 gene, which we show is restricted to developing leaf veins, to include bundle sheath cells encircling the vein. In transgenic lines, which were generated using the orthologous ZmSHR1 gene to avoid potential silencing of OsSHR2, stomatal cell files were observed both in the normal position and in more distant positions from the vein. Contrary to theoretical predictions, and to phenotypes observed in eudicot leaves, the increase in stomatal density did not enhance photosynthetic capacity or increase mesophyll cell density. Collectively these results suggest that the SHORTROOT pathway may co-ordinate the positioning of veins and stomata in monocot leaves, and that distinct mechanisms may operate in monocot and eudicot leaves to co-ordinate stomatal patterning with the development of underlying mesophyll cells.
NA	Multiple transcriptional factors control stomata development in rice.	2019	New Phytol	MOE Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, China.	The grass stomata can balance the gas exchange and evaporation effectively in rapidly changing environment via their unique anatomical features. Although the key components of stomatal development in Arabidopsis have been largely elucidated during the past decade, the molecular mechanisms that govern stomatal development in grasses are poorly understood. Via the genome editing system and T-DNA insertion lines, the key transcriptional factors (TFs) regulating stomatal development in rice (Oryza sativa) were knocked out. A combination of genetic and biochemical assays subsequently revealed the functions of these TFs. OsSPCH/OsICE is essential for the initiation of stomatal lineage. OsMUTE/OsICE determines meristemoid to guard mother cell (GMC) transition. OsFAMA/OsICE influences subsidiary mother cell asymmetric division and mature stoma differentiation. OsFLP regulates the orientation of GMC symmetric division. More importantly, we found that OsSCR/OsSHR controls the initiation of stomatal lineage cells and the formation of subsidiary cells, and the transcription of OsSCR is activated by OsSPCH and OsMUTE. This study characterized the functions of master regulatory TFs that control each stomatal developmental stage in rice. Our findings are helpful to elucidate how various species reprogramme the molecular mechanisms to generate different stomatal types during evolution. This article is protected by copyright.

NA	SHORT-ROOT and SCARECROW homologs regulate patterning of diverse cell types within and between species.	2022	New Phytol	Department of Plant Biology, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, 95616, USA.	The roles of SHORT-ROOT (SHR) and SCARECROW (SCR) in ground tissue patterning and differentiation have been well established in the root of Arabidopsis thaliana. Recently, work in additional organs and species revealed the extensive functional diversification of these genes, including regulation of cortical divisions essential for nodule organogenesis in legume roots, bundle sheath specification in the Arabidopsis leaf, patterning of inner leaf cell layers in maize, and stomatal development in rice. The co-option of distinct functions and cell types is attributed to different mechanisms, including paralog retention, spatiotemporal changes in gene expression, and novel protein functions. Elaborating our knowledge of the SHR-SCR module further unravels the developmental regulation that controls diverse forms and functions within and between species.
NA	SHORT ROOT and INDETERMINATE DOMAIN family members govern PIN-FORMED expression to regulate minor vein differentiation in rice.	2023	Plant Cell	Biotechnology Research Institute (BRI), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), Beijing, China.	C3 and C4 grasses directly and indirectly provide the vast majority of calories to the human diet, yet our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving photosynthetic productivity in grasses is largely unexplored. Ground meristem cells divide to form mesophyll or vascular initial cells early in leaf development in C3 and C4 grasses. Here we define a genetic circuit composed of SHR (SHORT ROOT), IDD (INDETERMINATE DOMAIN), and PIN (PIN-FORMED) family members that specifies vascular identify and ground cell proliferation in leaves of both C3 and C4 grasses. Ectopic expression and loss-of-function mutant studies of SHR paralogs in the C3 plant Oryza sativa (rice) and the C4 plant Setaria viridis (green millet) revealed the roles of these genes in both minor vein formation and ground cell differentiation. Genetic and in vitro studies further suggested that SHR regulates this process through its interactions with IDD12 and 13. We also revealed direct interactions of these IDD proteins with a putative regulatory element within the auxin transporter gene PIN5c. Collectively, these findings indicate that a SHR-IDD regulatory circuit mediates auxin transport by negatively regulating PIN expression to modulate minor vein patterning in the grasses.
