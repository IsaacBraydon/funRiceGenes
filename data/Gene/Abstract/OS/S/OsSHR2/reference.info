NA	A plausible mechanism, based upon Short-Root movement, for regulating the number of cortex cell layers in roots	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104	Formation of specialized cells and tissues at defined times and in specific positions is essential for the development of multicellular organisms. Often this developmental precision is achieved through intercellular signaling networks, which establish patterns of differential gene expression and ultimately the specification of distinct cell fates. Here we address the question of how the Short-root (SHR) proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtSHR), Brachypodium distachyon (BdSHR), and Oryza sativa (OsSHR1 and OsSHR2) function in patterning the root ground tissue. We find that all of the SHR proteins function as mobile signals in A. thaliana and all of the SHR homologs physically interact with the AtSHR binding protein, Scarecow (SCR). Unlike AtSHR, movement of the SHR homologs was not limited to the endodermis. Instead, the SHR proteins moved multiple cell layers and determined the number of cortex, not endodermal, cell layers formed in the root. Our results in A. thaliana are consistent with a mechanism by which the regulated movement of the SHR transcription factor determines the number of cortex cell layers produced in the roots of B. distachyon and O. sativa. These data also provide a new model for ground tissue patterning in A. thaliana in which the ability to form a functional endodermis is spatially limited independently of SHR.
NA	SHR overexpression induces the formation of supernumerary cell layers with cortex cell identity in rice.	2017	Dev Biol	CIRAD, UMR AGAP, 34398 Montpellier Cedex 5 France.	The number of root cortex cell layers varies among plants, and many species have several cortical cell layers. We recently demonstrated that the two rice orthologs of the Arabidopsis SHR gene, OsSHR1 and OsSHR2, could complement the A. thaliana shr mutant. Moreover, OsSHR1 and OsSHR2 expression in A. thaliana roots induced the formation of extra root cortical cell layers. In this article, we demonstrate that the overexpression of AtSHR and OsSHR2 in rice roots leads to plants with wide and short roots that contain a high number of extra cortical cell layers. We hypothesize that SHR genes may share a conserved function in the control of cortical cell layer division and the number of ground tissue cell layers in land plants.
NA	SHORTROOT-mediated increase in stomatal density has no impact on photosynthetic efficiency.	2017	Plant Physiol	University of Oxford CITY: Oxford OX1 3RB United Kingdom [GB].	The co-ordinated positioning of veins, mesophyll cells and stomata across a leaf is crucial for efficient gas exchange and transpiration, and therefore for overall function. In monocot leaves, stomatal cell files are positioned at the flanks of underlying longitudinal leaf veins, rather than directly above or below. This pattern suggests either that stomatal formation is inhibited in epidermal cells directly in contact with the vein, or that specification is induced in cells files beyond the vein. The SHORTROOT pathway specifies distinct cell-types around the vasculature in sub-epidermal layers of both root and shoots, with cell-type identity determined by distance from the vein. To test whether the pathway has the potential to similarly pattern epidermal cell-types, we expanded the expression domain of the rice OsSHR2 gene, which we show is restricted to developing leaf veins, to include bundle sheath cells encircling the vein. In transgenic lines, which were generated using the orthologous ZmSHR1 gene to avoid potential silencing of OsSHR2, stomatal cell files were observed both in the normal position and in more distant positions from the vein. Contrary to theoretical predictions, and to phenotypes observed in eudicot leaves, the increase in stomatal density did not enhance photosynthetic capacity or increase mesophyll cell density. Collectively these results suggest that the SHORTROOT pathway may co-ordinate the positioning of veins and stomata in monocot leaves, and that distinct mechanisms may operate in monocot and eudicot leaves to co-ordinate stomatal patterning with the development of underlying mesophyll cells.
