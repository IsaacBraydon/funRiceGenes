OsSIDP366	 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsSIDP366 showed enhanced drought and salinity tolerance and reduced water loss as compared to that in the control, whereas plants with down-regulated OsSIDP366 expression levels using RNA interference (RNAi) were more sensitive to salinity and drought treatments |  The sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) treatment was not changed in OsSIDP366-overexpressing plants, and OsSIDP366 expression was not affected in ABA-deficient mutants |  Digital gene expression (DGE) profile analysis indicated that stress related genes such as SNAC1, OsHAK5 and PRs were up-regulated in OsSIDP366-overexpressing plants	 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsSIDP366 showed enhanced drought and salinity tolerance and reduced water loss as compared to that in the control, whereas plants with down-regulated OsSIDP366 expression levels using RNA interference (RNAi) were more sensitive to salinity and drought treatments
