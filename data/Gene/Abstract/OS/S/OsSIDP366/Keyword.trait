OsSIDP366	resistance	OsSIDP366, a DUF1644 gene, positively regulates responses to drought and salt stresses in rice.	 These results suggest that OsSIDP366 may function as a regulator of the PBs/SGs and positively regulate salt and drought resistance in rice
OsSIDP366	drought	OsSIDP366, a DUF1644 gene, positively regulates responses to drought and salt stresses in rice.	 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsSIDP366 showed enhanced drought and salinity tolerance and reduced water loss as compared to that in the control, whereas plants with down-regulated OsSIDP366 expression levels using RNA interference (RNAi) were more sensitive to salinity and drought treatments
OsSIDP366	drought	OsSIDP366, a DUF1644 gene, positively regulates responses to drought and salt stresses in rice.	 These results suggest that OsSIDP366 may function as a regulator of the PBs/SGs and positively regulate salt and drought resistance in rice
OsSIDP366	salinity	OsSIDP366, a DUF1644 gene, positively regulates responses to drought and salt stresses in rice.	 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsSIDP366 showed enhanced drought and salinity tolerance and reduced water loss as compared to that in the control, whereas plants with down-regulated OsSIDP366 expression levels using RNA interference (RNAi) were more sensitive to salinity and drought treatments
OsSIDP366	salt	OsSIDP366, a DUF1644 gene, positively regulates responses to drought and salt stresses in rice.	 These results suggest that OsSIDP366 may function as a regulator of the PBs/SGs and positively regulate salt and drought resistance in rice
OsSIDP366	tolerance	OsSIDP366, a DUF1644 gene, positively regulates responses to drought and salt stresses in rice.	 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsSIDP366 showed enhanced drought and salinity tolerance and reduced water loss as compared to that in the control, whereas plants with down-regulated OsSIDP366 expression levels using RNA interference (RNAi) were more sensitive to salinity and drought treatments
OsSIDP366	stress	OsSIDP366, a DUF1644 gene, positively regulates responses to drought and salt stresses in rice.	 Subcellular localization analysis revealed that OsSIDP366 is presented in the cytoplasmic foci that colocalized with protein markers for both processing bodies (PBs) and stress granules (SGs) in rice protoplasts
OsSIDP366	drought resistance	OsSIDP366, a DUF1644 gene, positively regulates responses to drought and salt stresses in rice.	 These results suggest that OsSIDP366 may function as a regulator of the PBs/SGs and positively regulate salt and drought resistance in rice
OsSIDP366	abscisic acid	OsSIDP366, a DUF1644 gene, positively regulates responses to drought and salt stresses in rice.	 The sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) treatment was not changed in OsSIDP366-overexpressing plants, and OsSIDP366 expression was not affected in ABA-deficient mutants
