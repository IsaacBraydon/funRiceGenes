OsSTLK	root	A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, OsSTLK, modulates salt tolerance in rice 	 Transcript analysis showed that OsSTLK was significantly induced in response to salt stress in rice shoot and root in a time and dosage-dependent fashion
OsSTLK	shoot	A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, OsSTLK, modulates salt tolerance in rice 	 Transcript analysis showed that OsSTLK was significantly induced in response to salt stress in rice shoot and root in a time and dosage-dependent fashion
OsSTLK	salt	A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, OsSTLK, modulates salt tolerance in rice 	 Here, we identified a novel rice LRR-RLK member involved in salt tolerance and designated as OsSTLK (Oryza sativa L

OsSTLK	salt	A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, OsSTLK, modulates salt tolerance in rice 	 Phenotypic observations indicated that OsSTLK overexpression exhibited reduced salt sensitivity, and improved salt stress tolerance
OsSTLK	salt	A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, OsSTLK, modulates salt tolerance in rice 	 Further physiological analysis showed that OsSTLK overexpression remarkably reduced electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation under salt stress conditions by up-regulating ROS-scavenging activities and modifying stomatal patterning
OsSTLK	salt	A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, OsSTLK, modulates salt tolerance in rice 	 Taken together, our findings suggested that OsSTLK as an important positive regulator of salt stress tolerance perhaps through regulating ROS scavenging system, Na+/K+ ratio and MAPK signal pathway
