OsSTLK	 Phenotypic observations indicated that OsSTLK overexpression exhibited reduced salt sensitivity, and improved salt stress tolerance |  Further physiological analysis showed that OsSTLK overexpression remarkably reduced electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation under salt stress conditions by up-regulating ROS-scavenging activities and modifying stomatal patterning |  Moreover, Na+/K+ ratio and MAPK phosphorylation level were also reduced in OsSTLK-overexpression transgenic rice plants compared with WT control	 Phenotypic observations indicated that OsSTLK overexpression exhibited reduced salt sensitivity, and improved salt stress tolerance |  Further physiological analysis showed that OsSTLK overexpression remarkably reduced electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation under salt stress conditions by up-regulating ROS-scavenging activities and modifying stomatal patterning |  Moreover, Na+/K+ ratio and MAPK phosphorylation level were also reduced in OsSTLK-overexpression transgenic rice plants compared with WT control
