ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	OsSKL2	Regulation of Drought and Salt Tolerance by OsSKL2 and OsASR1 in Rice.	Regulation of Drought and Salt Tolerance by OsSKL2 and OsASR1 in Rice.
ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	OsSKL2	Regulation of Drought and Salt Tolerance by OsSKL2 and OsASR1 in Rice.	 Moreover, OsSKL2 was found to physically interact with OsASR1, a well-known chaperone-like protein, which also exhibited positive roles in salt and drought tolerance
ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	OsSKL2	Regulation of Drought and Salt Tolerance by OsSKL2 and OsASR1 in Rice.	 A reduction in ROS production was also observed in leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana showing transient co-expression of OsSKL2 with OsASR1
ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	OsSKL2	Regulation of Drought and Salt Tolerance by OsSKL2 and OsASR1 in Rice.	 Taken together, these findings suggest that OsSKL2 together with OsASR1 act as important regulatory factors that confer salt and drought tolerance in rice via ROS scavenging
