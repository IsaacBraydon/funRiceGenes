NA	Disruption of OsSULTR3;3 reduces phytate and phosphorus concentrations and alters the metabolite profile in rice grains.	2016	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Institute of Crop Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Two low phytic acid (lpa) mutants have been developed previously with the aim to improve the nutritional value of rice (Oryza sativa) grains. In the present study, the impacts of lpa mutations on grain composition and underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated. Comparative compositional analyses and metabolite profiling demonstrated that concentrations of both phytic acid (PA) and total phosphorus (P) were significantly reduced in lpa brown rice, accompanied by changes in other metabolites and increased concentrations of nutritionally relevant compounds. The lpa mutations modified the expression of a number of genes involved in PA metabolism, as well as in sulfate and phosphate homeostasis and metabolism. Map-based cloning and complementation identified the underlying lpa gene to be OsSULTR3;3. The promoter of OsSULTR3;3 is highly active in the vascular bundles of leaves, stems and seeds, and its protein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. No activity of OsSULTR3;3 was revealed for the transport of phosphate, sulfate, inositol or inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate by heterologous expression in either yeast or Xenopus oocytes. The findings reveal that OsSULTR3;3 plays an important role in grain metabolism, pointing to a new route to generate value-added grains in rice and other cereal crops.
NA	Stability of the Metabolite Signature Resulting from the OsSULTR;3 Mutation in Low Phytic Acid Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Seeds upon Cross-breeding.	2018	J Agric Food Chem	Fail	The low phytic acid (lpa) rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant Os-lpa-MH86-1, resulting from the mutation of the putative sulfate transporter gene OsSULTR3;3, was crossed with a commercial rice cultivar. The obtained progenies of generations F4 to F7 were subjected to a non-targeted metabolite profiling approach allowing the analyses of a broad spectrum of lipophilic and hydrophilic low molecular weight constituents. The metabolite profiles of the homozygous lpa progenies were characterized not only by a decreased concentration of phytic acid, but also by increased contents of constituents from various classes, such as sugars, sugar alcohols, amino acids, phytosterols and biogenic amines. Statistical assessments of the data via multivariate and univariate approaches demonstrated that this mutation-induced metabolite signature was nearly unaffected by the cross-breeding step and consistently expressed over several generations. The data demonstrate that even for complex metabolic changes resulting from a mutation, cross-breeding can be employed as a tool to generate progeny rice seeds stably exhibiting the mutation induced traits.
