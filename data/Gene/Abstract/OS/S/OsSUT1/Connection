OsSUT1	OsSUT2|OsSUT2M	Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice	 On the other handOsSUT1 was expressed at the early stage of the grain development, suggesting a different physiological role compared to Os SUT2
OsSUT1	OsSUT5|OsSUT5Z	Transport activity of rice sucrose transporters OsSUT1 and OsSUT5	 Expression of OsSUT1 and OsSUT5 resulted in sucrose-dependent currents that were analyzed by two-electrode voltage clamping| In conclusion, differences in transport activity between OsSUT1 and OsSUT5 indicate that type II SUTs have a range of transport activities that are tuned to their function in the plant|Transport activity of rice sucrose transporters OsSUT1 and OsSUT5
