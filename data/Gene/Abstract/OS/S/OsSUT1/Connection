OsSUT1	OsSUT2|OsSUT2M	Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice	On the other handOsSUT1 was expressed at the early stage of the grain development, suggesting a different physiological role compared to Os SUT2
OsSUT1	OsSUT5|OsSUT5Z	Transport activity of rice sucrose transporters OsSUT1 and OsSUT5	Expression of OsSUT1 and OsSUT5 resulted in sucrose-dependent currents that were analyzed by two-electrode voltage clamping
OsSUT1	OsSUT5|OsSUT5Z	Transport activity of rice sucrose transporters OsSUT1 and OsSUT5	In conclusion, differences in transport activity between OsSUT1 and OsSUT5 indicate that type II SUTs have a range of transport activities that are tuned to their function in the plant

OsSUT1	WOX11	Improving rice tolerance to potassium deficiency by enhancing OsHAK16p:WOX11-controlled root development	The improvement of sugar partitioning to the roots by the expression of OsHAK16p:WOX11 was further indicated by increasing the expression of OsSUT1 and OsSUT4 genes in leaf blades and several OsMSTs genes in roots.
OsNF-YB1	OsSUT1	NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm	In summary, the aleurone-specific NF-YB1, with stronger expression at the dorsal side, plays an important role in regulating rice grain filling through activating the expression of SUT1, SUT3 and SUT4
OsSAC1	OsSUT1	Mutation of the OsSAC1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum protein with an unknown function, causes sugar accumulation in rice leaves.	 Extremely more OsAGPL1 and OsAGPS1 (responsible for starch synthesis) expression and significantly less OscFBP1, OscFBP2, OsSPS1, and OsSPS11 (responsible for sucrose synthesis) and OsSWEET11, OsSWEET14, and OsSUT1 (responsible for sucrose loading) expression occurred in ossac1 source leaves than in WT source leaves
OsSUT1	OsSUT5|OsSUT5Z	Phloem loading in rice leaves depends strongly on the apoplastic pathway	 Cross sections of the GUS transgenic plant showed that the signals of OsSUT1 and OsSUT5 occurred in the phloem companion cells
OsSUT1	OsSUT4	Phloem loading in rice leaves depends strongly on the apoplastic pathway	 The ossut1 and ossut4 mutants presented a decrease of grain yield, implying important roles of OsSUTs in phloem loading
OsCCA1|Nhd1	OsSUT1	Rice circadian clock regulator Nhd1 controls the expression of the sucrose transporter gene OsSUT1 and impacts carbon-nitrogen balance.	Rice circadian clock regulator Nhd1 controls the expression of the sucrose transporter gene OsSUT1 and impacts carbon-nitrogen balance.
OsCCA1|Nhd1	OsSUT1	Rice circadian clock regulator Nhd1 controls the expression of the sucrose transporter gene OsSUT1 and impacts carbon-nitrogen balance.	 We identified that Nhd1 can directly activate the transcriptional expression of sucrose transporter-1 (OsSUT1)
OsCCA1|Nhd1	OsSUT1	Rice circadian clock regulator Nhd1 controls the expression of the sucrose transporter gene OsSUT1 and impacts carbon-nitrogen balance.	 Knockout of Nhd1 suppressed OsSUT1 expression, and both nhd1 and ossut1 mutants showed similar shorter height, and lower shoot biomass and sucrose concentration in comparison with the wild type, while overexpression of OsSUT1 can restore the defective sucrose transport and partially ameliorate the reduced growth of nhd1 mutants
OsCCA1|Nhd1	OsSUT1	Rice circadian clock regulator Nhd1 controls the expression of the sucrose transporter gene OsSUT1 and impacts carbon-nitrogen balance.	 The positively related variation of Nhd1 and OsSUT1 expression among randomly selected indica and japonica varieties suggests a common regulatory module of Nhd1-OsSUT1-mediated C and N balance in rice
