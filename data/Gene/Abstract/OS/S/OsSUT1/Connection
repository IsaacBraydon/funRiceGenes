OsSUT1	OsSUT2|OsSUT2M	Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice	 On the other handOsSUT1 was expressed at the early stage of the grain development, suggesting a different physiological role compared to Os SUT2
OsSUT1	OsSUT5|OsSUT5Z	Transport activity of rice sucrose transporters OsSUT1 and OsSUT5	 Expression of OsSUT1 and OsSUT5 resulted in sucrose-dependent currents that were analyzed by two-electrode voltage clamping
OsSUT1	OsSUT5|OsSUT5Z	Transport activity of rice sucrose transporters OsSUT1 and OsSUT5	 In conclusion, differences in transport activity between OsSUT1 and OsSUT5 indicate that type II SUTs have a range of transport activities that are tuned to their function in the plant

OsSUT1	WOX11	Improving rice tolerance to potassium deficiency by enhancing OsHAK16p:WOX11-controlled root development	The improvement of sugar partitioning to the roots by the expression of OsHAK16p:WOX11 was further indicated by increasing the expression of OsSUT1 and OsSUT4 genes in leaf blades and several OsMSTs genes in roots.
OsNF-YB1	OsSUT1	NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm	In summary, the aleurone-specific NF-YB1, with stronger expression at the dorsal side, plays an important role in regulating rice grain filling through activating the expression of SUT1, SUT3 and SUT4
