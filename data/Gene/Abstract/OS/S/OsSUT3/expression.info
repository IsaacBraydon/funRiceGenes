OsSUT3	Transcriptome Analyses Show Changes in Gene Expression Triggered by a 31-bp InDel within OsSUT3 5&#x27;UTR in Rice Panicle. |  In this study, to analyze the changes of gene expression triggered by 31-bp InDel during pollen development, two vectors (p385-In/Del::OsSUT3-GUS) were constructed and then stably introduced into rice |  Histochemical and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of transgenic plants showed that 31-bp deletion drastically reduced the expressions of downstream genes, including both OsSUT3 and GUS in rice panicle at booting stage, especially that of OsSUT3
