Plant Cell Physiol-2003-Aoki-223-32.pdf	The sucrose transporter gene family in rice	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	CSIRO Plant Industry, Canberra, ACT, 2601 Australia.	In this paper we report the identification, cloning and expression analysis of four putative sucrose transporter (SUT) genes from rice, designated OsSUT2, 3, 4 and 5. Three of the four genes were identified through extensive searches of the recently published draft sequence of the rice genome. Along with the previously reported OsSUT1 we propose that these five genes comprise the rice SUT gene family. Complementary DNA clones were isolated for the four newly identified genes. The deduced proteins of all five SUT genes were predicted to contain 12 membrane-spanning helices and a domain highly conserved throughout all known plant SUTs, suggesting the four additional OsSUT genes encode functional SUTs. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis was performed in order to investigate the expression pattern of each member of the SUT family in rice. A differing but overlapping expression pattern was observed for each member of the SUT family at different stages through plant development. These results, together with the structural variations apparent from the deduced protein sequences, suggest that the five SUTs possess diverse roles in both sink and source tissues. We also discuss the classification and evolution of the rice SUT gene family, using a comparison of the gene structures and deduced amino acid sequences with other known plant SUT genes.
NA	Identification of the Core Pollen-Specific Regulation in the Rice OsSUT3 Promoter.	2020	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, China.	The regulatory mechanisms of pollen development have potential value for applications in agriculture, such as better understanding plant reproductive regularity. Pollen-specific promoters are of vital importance for the ectopic expression of functional genes associated with pollen development in plants. However, there is a limited number of successful applications using pollen-specific promoters in genetic engineering for crop breeding and hybrid generation. Our previous work led to the identification and isolation of the OsSUT3 promoter from rice. In this study, to analyze the effects of different putative regulatory motifs in the OsSUT3 promoter, a series of promoter deletions were fused to a GUS reporter gene and then stably introduced into rice and Arabidopsis. Histochemical GUS analysis of transgenic plants revealed that p385 (from -385 to -1) specifically mediated maximal GUS expression in pollen tissues. The S region (from -385 to -203) was the key region for controlling the pollen-specific expression of a downstream gene. The E1 (-967 to -606), E2 (-202 to -120), and E3 (-119 to -1) regions enhanced ectopic promoter activity to different degrees. Moreover, the p385 promoter could alter the expression pattern of the 35S promoter and improve its activity when they were fused together. In summary, the p385 promoter, a short and high-activity promoter, can function to drive pollen-specific expression of transgenes in monocotyledon and dicotyledon transformation experiments.
