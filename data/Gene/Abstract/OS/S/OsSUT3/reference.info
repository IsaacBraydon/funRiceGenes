In this paper we report the identification, cloning and expression analysis of four putative sucrose transporter (SUT) genes from rice, designated OsSUT2, 3, 4 and 5. Three of the four genes were identified through extensive searches of the recently published draft sequence of the rice genome. Along with the previously reported OsSUT1 we propose that these five genes comprise the rice SUT gene family. Complementary DNA clones were isolated for the four newly identified genes. The deduced proteins of all five SUT genes were predicted to contain 12 membrane-spanning helices and a domain highly conserved throughout all known plant SUTs, suggesting the four additional OsSUT genes encode functional SUTs. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis was performed in order to investigate the expression pattern of each member of the SUT family in rice. A differing but overlapping expression pattern was observed for each member of the SUT family at different stages through plant development. These results, together with the structural variations apparent from the deduced protein sequences, suggest that the five SUTs possess diverse roles in both sink and source tissues. We also discuss the classification and evolution of the rice SUT gene family, using a comparison of the gene structures and deduced amino acid sequences with other known plant SUT genes.
