OsSUT3	panicle	Transcriptome Analyses Show Changes in Gene Expression Triggered by a 31-bp InDel within OsSUT3 5&#x27;UTR in Rice Panicle.	 Histochemical and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of transgenic plants showed that 31-bp deletion drastically reduced the expressions of downstream genes, including both OsSUT3 and GUS in rice panicle at booting stage, especially that of OsSUT3
