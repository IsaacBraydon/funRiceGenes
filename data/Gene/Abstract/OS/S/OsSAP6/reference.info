NA	OsSAP6 Positively Regulates Soda Saline-Alkaline Stress Tolerance in Rice.	2022	Rice (N Y)	Key Laboratory of Saline-Alkali Vegetation Ecology Restoration, Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, 150040, China.	BACKGROUND: Soil salinization is a worldwide environmental problem, especially in the arid and semiarid regions of northeastern China, which are heavily affected by soda saline-alkaline stress. At present, there is an urgent need to improve the soda saline-alkaline stress tolerance of rice. RESULTS: Stress-associated proteins are involved in regulating the abiotic stresses in plants. There are 18 members of the rice stress-associated protein (OsSAP) gene family. In this study, the expression levels of OsSAP6 in leaves and roots were upregulated with increasing NaHCO(3) stress duration. OsSAP6 was located in nucleus and cytoplasm. The bud length and total root length of OsSAP6 overexpression rice were significantly longer than those of Lj11 (Oryza sativa longjing11) during germination stage, and the survival rates, plant height and malondialdehyde content at the seedling stage showed tolerance growth of saline-alkaline stress. The expression of OsCu/Zn-SOD, OsAPX2, and OsCAT1 in transgenic lines was increased significantly under SAE (soda saline-alkali soil eluent) stress. OsSAP6 interacts with OsPK5 according to yeast two-hybrid screening and luciferase complementation experiments. The expression of OsPK5 increased under NaHCO(3) and H(2)O(2) stress, and the overexpression of OsPK5 in rice improved soda saline-alkaline tolerance. CONCLUSION: Overexpression of OsSAP6 in rice significantly enhanced saline-alkaline tolerance compared with the wild type. It is speculated that OsSAP6 responds to soda salinity stress and interacts with OsPK5 to positively regulate soda saline-alkaline tolerance through ROS homeostasis. This study revealed the features of OsSAP6 involved in response to soda saline-alkaline stress and the interaction with OsPK5, which provided resources for breeding aimed at improving the soda saline-alkaline stress tolerance of rice.
