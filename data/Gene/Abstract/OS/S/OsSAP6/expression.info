OsSAP6	 In this study, the expression levels of OsSAP6 in leaves and roots were upregulated with increasing NaHCO(3) stress duration |  The bud length and total root length of OsSAP6 overexpression rice were significantly longer than those of Lj11 (Oryza sativa longjing11) during germination stage, and the survival rates, plant height and malondialdehyde content at the seedling stage showed tolerance growth of saline-alkaline stress |  CONCLUSION: Overexpression of OsSAP6 in rice significantly enhanced saline-alkaline tolerance compared with the wild type	 The bud length and total root length of OsSAP6 overexpression rice were significantly longer than those of Lj11 (Oryza sativa longjing11) during germination stage, and the survival rates, plant height and malondialdehyde content at the seedling stage showed tolerance growth of saline-alkaline stress |  CONCLUSION: Overexpression of OsSAP6 in rice significantly enhanced saline-alkaline tolerance compared with the wild type
