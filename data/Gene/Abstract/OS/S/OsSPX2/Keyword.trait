OsSPX2	phosphate starvation response	Rice SPX1 and SPX2 inhibit phosphate starvation responses through interacting with PHR2 in a phosphate-dependent manner	Rice SPX1 and SPX2 inhibit phosphate starvation responses through interacting with PHR2 in a phosphate-dependent manner
OsSPX2	phosphate starvation	Rice SPX1 and SPX2 inhibit phosphate starvation responses through interacting with PHR2 in a phosphate-dependent manner	Rice SPX1 and SPX2 inhibit phosphate starvation responses through interacting with PHR2 in a phosphate-dependent manner
OsSPX2	phosphate	Rice SPX1 and SPX2 inhibit phosphate starvation responses through interacting with PHR2 in a phosphate-dependent manner	Rice SPX1 and SPX2 inhibit phosphate starvation responses through interacting with PHR2 in a phosphate-dependent manner
OsSPX2	leaf	Transcription factor OsNAC016 negatively regulates phosphate-starvation response in rice.	 Together, our findings demonstrate that OsNAC016 negatively regulates rice phosphate-starvation response and leaf inclination by activating OsSPX2 expression under Pi-starvation conditions
OsSPX2	Pi	Transcription factor OsNAC016 negatively regulates phosphate-starvation response in rice.	 Further, we found that Pi starvation enhanced OsNAC016 binding to the OsSPX2 promoter, thus strongly promoting OsSPX2 expression
OsSPX2	pi	Transcription factor OsNAC016 negatively regulates phosphate-starvation response in rice.	 Further, we found that Pi starvation enhanced OsNAC016 binding to the OsSPX2 promoter, thus strongly promoting OsSPX2 expression
