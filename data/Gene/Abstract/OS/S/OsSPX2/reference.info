NA	Rice SPX1 and SPX2 inhibit phosphate starvation responses through interacting with PHR2 in a phosphate-dependent manner	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China	In plants, sensing the levels of external and internal nutrients is essential for reprogramming the transcriptome and adapting to the fluctuating environment. Phosphate (Pi) is a key plant nutrient, and a large proportion of Pi starvation-responsive genes are under the control of PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE REGULATOR 1 (PHR1) in Arabidopsis (AtPHR1) and its homologs, such as Oryza sativa (Os)PHR2 in rice. AtPHR1 and OsPHR2 expression is not very responsive to Pi starvation, raising the question as to how plants sense changes in cellular Pi levels to activate the central regulator. SPX [named after SYG1 (suppressor of yeast gpa1), Pho81 (CDK inhibitor in yeast PHO pathway), and XPR1 (xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor)] proteins that harbor only the SPX domain are reported to be involved in the negative regulation of Pi starvation responses. Here, we show that the nuclear localized SPX proteins SPX1 and SPX2 are Pi-dependent inhibitors of the activity of OsPHR2 in rice. Indeed, SPX1 and SPX2 proteins interact with PHR2 through their SPX domain, inhibiting its binding to P1BS (the PHR1-binding sequence: GNATATNC). In vivo data, as well as results from in vitro experiments using purified SPX1, SPX2, and OsPHR2 proteins, showed that SPX1 and SPX2 inhibition of OsPHR2 activity is Pi-dependent. These data provide evidence to support the involvement of SPX1 and SPX2 in the Pi-sensing mechanism in plants.
NA	Mechanistic insights into the regulation of plant phosphate homeostasis by the PHR2 complex.	2022	Nat Commun	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Hubei Hongshan Laboratory, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Phosphate (Pi) starvation response (PHR) transcription factors play key roles in plant Pi homeostasis maintenance. They are negatively regulated by stand-alone SPX proteins, cellular receptors for inositol pyrophosphate (PP-InsP) nutrient messengers. How PP-InsP-bound SPX interacts with PHRs is poorly understood. Here, we report crystal structures of the rice SPX2/InsP(6)/PHR2 complex and of the PHR2 DNA binding (MYB) domain in complex with target DNA at resolutions of 3.1 Å and 2.7 Å, respectively. In the SPX2/InsP(6)/PHR2 complex, the signalling-active SPX2 assembles into a domain-swapped dimer conformation and binds two copies of PHR2, targeting both its coiled-coil (CC) oligomerisation domain and MYB domain. Our results reveal that the SPX2 senses PP-InsPs to inactivate PHR2 by establishing severe steric clashes with the PHR2 MYB domain, preventing DNA binding, and by disrupting oligomerisation of the PHR2 CC domain, attenuating promoter binding. Our findings rationalize how PP-InsPs activate SPX receptor proteins to target PHR family transcription factors.
NA	Transcription factor OsNAC016 negatively regulates phosphate-starvation response in rice.	2023	Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Bioengineering College, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China. Electronic address: 1589385755@qq.com.	Phosphate (Pi), the main form of inorganic phosphorus that can be absorbed by plants, is one of the most limiting macro-nutrients in plants. However, the underlying molecular mechanism determining how plants sense external Pi levels and reprogram transcriptional and adaptive responses is incompletely understood. At present, few rice NAC members have been reported to be involved in the signaling pathways of Pi homeostasis in plants. Here, our research demonstrated that OsNAC016, a Pi-starvation responsive gene in rice, was regulated by PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE protein 1 (OsPHR1) and OsPHR4. Under Pi-starvation stress, the root growth of OsNAC016-overexpression lines was inhibited more severely, and overexpression plants had lower Pi content than wild type, while osnac016 mutant was hyposensitive to Pi starvation, indicating that OsNAC016 negatively modulates rice Pi-starvation response. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) analysis and transient transactivation assays indicated that OsNAC016 could activate the SPX-domain-containing protein 2 (OsSPX2) gene through binding to its promoter. Further, we found that Pi starvation enhanced OsNAC016 binding to the OsSPX2 promoter, thus strongly promoting OsSPX2 expression. At the same time, Pi starvation induced OsNAC016 protein accumulation in plants. Moreover, similar to OsSPX2, OsNAC016 negatively regulates leaf inclination by repressing the cell elongation in lamina joint in rice under Pi-starvation stress. Together, our findings demonstrate that OsNAC016 negatively regulates rice phosphate-starvation response and leaf inclination by activating OsSPX2 expression under Pi-starvation conditions. These data provide a strategy to create smart crops with ideal shoot architecture and high phosphorus utilization efficiency.
