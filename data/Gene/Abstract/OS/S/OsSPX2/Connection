OsPHR2	OsSPX2	Rice SPX1 and SPX2 inhibit phosphate starvation responses through interacting with PHR2 in a phosphate-dependent manner	Rice SPX1 and SPX2 inhibit phosphate starvation responses through interacting with PHR2 in a phosphate-dependent manner
OsPHR2	OsSPX2	Rice SPX1 and SPX2 inhibit phosphate starvation responses through interacting with PHR2 in a phosphate-dependent manner	Indeed, SPX1 and SPX2 proteins interact with PHR2 through their SPX domain, inhibiting its binding to P1BS (the PHR1-binding sequence: GNATATNC)
OsPIE1	OsSPX2	A phosphate-starvation induced RING-type E3 ligase maintains phosphate homeostasis partially through OsSPX2 in rice.	 OsSPX2 was strongly suppressed in OsPIE1 overexpressors
OsPIE1	OsSPX2	A phosphate-starvation induced RING-type E3 ligase maintains phosphate homeostasis partially through OsSPX2 in rice.	 Further comparative transcriptome analysis, tissue expression patterns and genetic interaction analysis indicated that the enhancing of Pi accumulation and APase activities upon overexpression of OsPIE1 was (at least in part) caused by repression of OsSPX2
OsNAC016	OsSPX2	Transcription factor OsNAC016 negatively regulates phosphate-starvation response in rice.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) analysis and transient transactivation assays indicated that OsNAC016 could activate the SPX-domain-containing protein 2 (OsSPX2) gene through binding to its promoter
OsNAC016	OsSPX2	Transcription factor OsNAC016 negatively regulates phosphate-starvation response in rice.	 Further, we found that Pi starvation enhanced OsNAC016 binding to the OsSPX2 promoter, thus strongly promoting OsSPX2 expression
OsNAC016	OsSPX2	Transcription factor OsNAC016 negatively regulates phosphate-starvation response in rice.	 Moreover, similar to OsSPX2, OsNAC016 negatively regulates leaf inclination by repressing the cell elongation in lamina joint in rice under Pi-starvation stress
OsNAC016	OsSPX2	Transcription factor OsNAC016 negatively regulates phosphate-starvation response in rice.	 Together, our findings demonstrate that OsNAC016 negatively regulates rice phosphate-starvation response and leaf inclination by activating OsSPX2 expression under Pi-starvation conditions
