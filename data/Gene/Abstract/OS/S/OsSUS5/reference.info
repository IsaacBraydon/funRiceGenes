Systematic searches using the complete genome sequence of rice (Oryza sativa) identified OsSUS7, a new member of the rice sucrose synthase (OsSUS) gene family, which shows only nine single nucleotide substitutions in the OsSUS5 coding sequence. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the synteny between OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 is conserved, and that significant numbers of transposable elements are scattered at both loci. In particular, a 17.6-kb genomic region containing transposable elements was identified in the 5' upstream sequence of the OsSUS7 gene. GFP fusion experiments indicated that OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 are largely associated with the plasma membrane and partly with the cytosol in maize mesophyll protoplasts. RT-PCR analysis and transient expression assays revealed that OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 exhibit similar expression patterns in rice tissues, with the highest expression evident in roots. These results suggest that two redundant genes, OsSUS5 and OsSUS7, evolved via duplication of a chromosome region and through the transposition of transposable elements.
