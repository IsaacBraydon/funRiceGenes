OsSEC3A	resistance	Disruption of OsSEC3A increases the content of salicylic acid and induces plant defense responses in rice.	 The Ossec3a mutant exhibited enhanced defense responses, as shown by up-regulated transcript levels of pathogenesis- and salicylic acid synthesis-related genes, increased levels of salicylic acid, and enhanced resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae
OsSEC3A	defense	Disruption of OsSEC3A increases the content of salicylic acid and induces plant defense responses in rice.	Disruption of OsSEC3A increases the content of salicylic acid and induces plant defense responses in rice.

OsSEC3A	salicylic acid	Disruption of OsSEC3A increases the content of salicylic acid and induces plant defense responses in rice.	Disruption of OsSEC3A increases the content of salicylic acid and induces plant defense responses in rice.
OsSEC3A	salicylic acid	Disruption of OsSEC3A increases the content of salicylic acid and induces plant defense responses in rice.	 The Ossec3a mutant exhibited enhanced defense responses, as shown by up-regulated transcript levels of pathogenesis- and salicylic acid synthesis-related genes, increased levels of salicylic acid, and enhanced resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae
OsSEC3A	blast	Disruption of OsSEC3A increases the content of salicylic acid and induces plant defense responses in rice.	 In addition, OsSEC3A interacted with rice SNAP25-type t-SNARE protein OsSNAP32, which is involved in rice blast resistance, via the C-terminus and bound to phosphatidylinositol lipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, through its N-terminus
OsSEC3A	magnaporthe oryzae	Disruption of OsSEC3A increases the content of salicylic acid and induces plant defense responses in rice.	 The Ossec3a mutant exhibited enhanced defense responses, as shown by up-regulated transcript levels of pathogenesis- and salicylic acid synthesis-related genes, increased levels of salicylic acid, and enhanced resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae
OsSEC3A	dwarf	Disruption of OsSEC3A increases the content of salicylic acid and induces plant defense responses in rice.	 Disruption of OsSEC3A by CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) caused dwarf stature and a lesion-mimic phenotype
OsSEC3A	plasma membrane	Disruption of OsSEC3A increases the content of salicylic acid and induces plant defense responses in rice.	 Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that OsSEC3A has a punctate distribution with the plasma membrane
OsSEC3A	blast resistance	Disruption of OsSEC3A increases the content of salicylic acid and induces plant defense responses in rice.	 In addition, OsSEC3A interacted with rice SNAP25-type t-SNARE protein OsSNAP32, which is involved in rice blast resistance, via the C-terminus and bound to phosphatidylinositol lipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, through its N-terminus
OsSEC3A	pathogen	Disruption of OsSEC3A increases the content of salicylic acid and induces plant defense responses in rice.	 The Ossec3a mutant exhibited enhanced defense responses, as shown by up-regulated transcript levels of pathogenesis- and salicylic acid synthesis-related genes, increased levels of salicylic acid, and enhanced resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae
