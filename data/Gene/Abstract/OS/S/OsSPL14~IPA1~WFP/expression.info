OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	Enhanced expression of OsSPL14 gene and its association with yield components in rice (Oryza sativa) under low nitrogen conditions. |  Expression analysis of OsSPL14 (LOC_Os08g39890) gene reported to be associated with increased panicle branching and higher grain yield through real time PCR in leaf and three stages of panicle has shown differential temporal expression and its association with yield and yield related components across the genotypes |  The expression of OsSPL14 at panicle stage 3, has shown correlation (P&lt;0 |  Since OsSPL14 is a functional transcription activator, its association of expression in leaf and three panicle stages with yield components as observed in the present study suggests the role of nitrogen metabolism related genes in plant growth and development and its conversion into yield components in rice
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	 Our findings reveal that IPA traits can be fine-tuned by manipulating IPA1 expression and that an optimal IPA1 expression/dose may lead to an ideal yield, demonstrating a practical approach to efficiently design elite super rice varieties
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	 Here we report that Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1), a key regulator of the plant architecture in rice, functions as a direct downstream component of D53 in regulating tiller number and SL-induced gene expression |  We further showed that IPA1 could directly bind to the D53 promoter and plays a critical role in the feedback regulation of SL-induced D53 expression
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	 Phosphorylated IPA1 binds to the promoter of the pathogen defense gene WRKY45 and activates its expression, leading to enhanced disease resistance
