OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	Enhanced expression of OsSPL14 gene and its association with yield components in rice (Oryza sativa) under low nitrogen conditions. |  Expression analysis of OsSPL14 (LOC_Os08g39890) gene reported to be associated with increased panicle branching and higher grain yield through real time PCR in leaf and three stages of panicle has shown differential temporal expression and its association with yield and yield related components across the genotypes |  The expression of OsSPL14 at panicle stage 3, has shown correlation (P&lt;0 |  Since OsSPL14 is a functional transcription activator, its association of expression in leaf and three panicle stages with yield components as observed in the present study suggests the role of nitrogen metabolism related genes in plant growth and development and its conversion into yield components in rice
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	 Our findings reveal that IPA traits can be fine-tuned by manipulating IPA1 expression and that an optimal IPA1 expression/dose may lead to an ideal yield, demonstrating a practical approach to efficiently design elite super rice varieties
