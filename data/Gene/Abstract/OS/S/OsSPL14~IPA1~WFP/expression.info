OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	Enhanced expression of OsSPL14 gene and its association with yield components in rice (Oryza sativa) under low nitrogen conditions. |  Expression analysis of OsSPL14 (LOC_Os08g39890) gene reported to be associated with increased panicle branching and higher grain yield through real time PCR in leaf and three stages of panicle has shown differential temporal expression and its association with yield and yield related components across the genotypes |  The expression of OsSPL14 at panicle stage 3, has shown correlation (P&lt;0 |  Since OsSPL14 is a functional transcription activator, its association of expression in leaf and three panicle stages with yield components as observed in the present study suggests the role of nitrogen metabolism related genes in plant growth and development and its conversion into yield components in rice
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	 Our findings reveal that IPA traits can be fine-tuned by manipulating IPA1 expression and that an optimal IPA1 expression/dose may lead to an ideal yield, demonstrating a practical approach to efficiently design elite super rice varieties
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	 Here we report that Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1), a key regulator of the plant architecture in rice, functions as a direct downstream component of D53 in regulating tiller number and SL-induced gene expression |  We further showed that IPA1 could directly bind to the D53 promoter and plays a critical role in the feedback regulation of SL-induced D53 expression
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	 Phosphorylated IPA1 binds to the promoter of the pathogen defense gene WRKY45 and activates its expression, leading to enhanced disease resistance
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	 And panicle architecture and grain size were controlled by miR529a through altering the expression of all five target genes OsSPL2, OsSPL7, OsSPL14, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	 Analysis of the soluble sugar content, activity of amylase, and expression of the ¦Á-amylase genes revealed that the starch metabolism was weakened in the ipa1-NIL germinating seeds |  Meanwhile, the expression of GA synthesis-related gene OsGA20ox1 was downregulated, whereas the expression of GA inactivation-related genes was upregulated in ipa1-NIL seeds |  In addition, the expression of OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY71 was significantly upregulated in ipa1-NIL seeds |  Using transient dual-luciferase and yeast one-hybrid assays, IPA1 was found to directly activate the expression of OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY71, which would interfere with the binding affinity of GA-induced transcription factor OsGAMYB to inhibit the expression of ¦Á-amylase genes
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	 Analysis of carbon-nitrogen metabolism-associated enzyme activity, gene expression, and metabolic profile indicated that ipa1 could tip the carbon-nitrogen metabolism balance towards an increased carbon metabolism pattern |  Expression of the ABA biosynthesis genes was detected to be up-regulated, whereas the expression of ABA catabolism genes was down-regulated in the ipa1 seedlings |  The expression of OsHOX12 and OsNAC52 was significantly up-regulated in the ipa1 plants
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	 Mechanistic studies revealed that the deleted fragment is a target site for the transcription factor An-1 to repress IPA1 expression in panicles and roots
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	 Expression of SNAC1 is significantly down-regulated in IPA1 knockout plants
