Osmtd1	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	A T-DNA insertion mutant Osmtd1 aas altered in architecture by upregulating MicroRNA156f in rice.	We showed that the expression of OsSPL3, OsSPL12 and OsSPL14 was significantly down-regulated in Osmtd1 or OsmiR156f overexpressed lines, indicating that OsSPL3, OsSPL12 and OsSPL14 were possibly direct target genes of OsmiR156f
IPI1	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	Tissue-specific Ubiquitination by IPA1 INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 Modulates IPA1 Protein Levels to Regulate Plant Architecture in Rice.	 Here, we report the identification and characterization of IPA1 INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 (IPI1), a RING-finger E3 ligase that can interact with IPA1 in the nucleus
IPI1	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	Tissue-specific Ubiquitination by IPA1 INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 Modulates IPA1 Protein Levels to Regulate Plant Architecture in Rice.	 IPI1 promotes the degradation of IPA1 in panicles while it stabilizes IPA1 in shoot apexes
IPI1	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	Tissue-specific Ubiquitination by IPA1 INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 Modulates IPA1 Protein Levels to Regulate Plant Architecture in Rice.	 These results demonstrate that IPI1 affects plant architecture through precisely tuning IPA1 protein levels in different tissues in rice, and provide new insight into the tissue-specific regulation of plant architecture and important genetic resources for molecular breeding applications
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	WTG1|OsOTUB1	Non-canonical regulation of SPL transcription factors by a human OTUB1-like deubiquitinase defines a new plant type rice associated with higher grain yield.	 OsOTUB1 interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating protein OsUBC13 and the squamosa promoter-binding protein-like transcription factor OsSPL14
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	WTG1|OsOTUB1	Non-canonical regulation of SPL transcription factors by a human OTUB1-like deubiquitinase defines a new plant type rice associated with higher grain yield.	 OsOTUB1 and OsSPL14 share common target genes, and their physical interaction limits K63-linked ubiquitination (K63Ub) of OsSPL14, which in turn promotes K48Ub-dependent proteasomal degradation of OsSPL14
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	WTG1|OsOTUB1	Non-canonical regulation of SPL transcription factors by a human OTUB1-like deubiquitinase defines a new plant type rice associated with higher grain yield.	 Conversely, loss-of-function of OsOTUB1 is correlated with the accumulation of high levels of OsSPL14, resulting in the NPT architecture
