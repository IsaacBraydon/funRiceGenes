The bulk of grass biomass potentially useful for cellulose-based biofuel production is the remains of secondary wall-containing sclerenchymatous fibers. Hence, it is important to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of secondary wall thickening in grass species. So far, little is known about the transcriptional regulatory switches responsible for the activation of the secondary wall biosynthetic program in grass species. Here, we report the roles of a group of rice and maize NAC and MYB transcription factors in the regulation of secondary wall biosynthesis. The rice and maize secondary wall-associated NACs (namely OsSWNs and ZmSWNs) were able to complement the Arabidopsis snd1 nst1 double mutant defective in secondary wall thickening. When overexpressed in Arabidopsis, OsSWNs and ZmSWNs were sufficient to activate a number of secondary wall-associated transcription factors and secondary wall biosynthetic genes, and concomitantly result in the ectopic deposition of cellulose, xylan and lignin. It was also found that the rice and maize MYB transcription factors, OsMYB46 and ZmMYB46, are functional orthologs of Arabidopsis MYB46/MYB83 and, when overexpressed in Arabidopsis, they were able to activate the entire secondary wall biosynthetic program. Furthermore, the promoters of OsMYB46 and ZmMYB46 contain secondary wall NAC-binding elements (SNBEs), which can be bound and activated by OsSWNs and ZmSWNs. Together, our results indicate that the rice and maize SWNs and MYB46 are master transcriptional activators of the secondary wall biosynthetic program and that OsSWNs and ZmSWNs activate their direct target genes through binding to the SNBE sites.
NA	The RLCK-VND6 module coordinates secondary cell wall formation and adaptive growth in rice.	2023	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, The Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	The orderly deposition of secondary cell wall (SCW) in plants is implicated in various biological programs and is precisely controlled. Although many positive and negative regulators of SCW have been documented, the molecular mechanisms underlying SCW formation coordinated with distinct cellular physiological processes during plant adaptive growth remain largely unclear. Here, we report the identification of Cellulose Synthase co-expressed Kinase1 (CSK1), which encodes a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, as a negative regulator of SCW formation and its signaling cascade in rice. Transcriptome deep sequencing of developing internodes and genome-wide co-expression assays revealed that CSK1 is co-expressed with cellulose synthase genes and is responsive to various stress stimuli. The increased SCW thickness and vigorous vessel transport in csk1 indicate that CSK1 functions as a negative regulator of SCW biosynthesis. Through observation of green fluorescent protein-tagged CSK1 in rice protoplasts and stable transgenic plants, we found that CSK1 is localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm adjacent to the plasma membrane. Biochemical and molecular assays demonstrated that CSK1 phosphorylates VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN 6 (VND6), a master SCW-associated transcription factor, in the nucleus, which reduces the transcription of a suite of SCW-related genes, thereby attenuating SCW accumulation. Consistently, genetic analyses show that CSK1 functions upstream of VND6 in regulating SCW formation. Interestingly, our physiological analyses revealed that CSK1 and VND6 are involved in abscisic acid-mediated regulation of cell growth and SCW deposition. Taken together, these results indicate that the CSK1-VND6 module is an important component of the SCW biosynthesis machinery, which coordinates SCW accumulation and adaptive growth in rice. Our study not only identifies a new regulator of SCW biosynthesis but also reveals a fine-tuned mechanism for precise control of SCW deposition, offering tools for rationally tailoring agronomic traits.
