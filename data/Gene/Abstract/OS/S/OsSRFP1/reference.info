NA	Knock-down of stress inducible OsSRFP1 encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase with transcriptional activation activity confers abiotic stress tolerance through enhancing antioxidant protection in rice.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	E3 ubiquitin ligases are involved in a variety of physiological processes. This study demonstrated the function of a previously unknown rice RING finger E3 ligase, Oryza sativa Stress-related RING Finger Protein 1 (OsSRFP1) in stress responses in rice. OsSRFP1 was ubiquitously expressed in various rice organs, with the higher expression levels in roots, panicles and culm nodes. The transcript of OsSRFP1 was induced by cold, dehydration, salt, H2O2 and abscisic acid treatments. Interestingly, the OsSRFP1-overexpressing plants were less tolerant to salt, cold and oxidative stresses than wild type plants; while the RNA interference silencing of OsSRFP1 plants were more tolerant than wild type without yield penalty. Compared with the wild type, amounts of free proline and activities of antioxidant enzymes were increased in the RNAi plants but decreased in the overexpression plants under cold stress, which were inversely correlated with the malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels in the tested lines. Microarray analysis showed that expression of numerous genes involving in ROS homeostasis was altered in the OsSRFP1-overexpressing plants under normal and cold conditions. In vitro ubiquitination assays showed that OsSRFP1 possessed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and the intact RING domain was essential for the activity. Moreover, OsSRFP1 might function in transcriptional regulation with nuclear localization. Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsSRFP1 may have dual functions in post-translational and transcriptional regulations in modulating abiotic stress responses in rice, at least in part, by negatively regulating antioxidant enzymes-mediated reactive oxygen species removal.
NA	Two RING-finger ubiquitin E3 ligases regulate the degradation of SPX4, the internal phosphate sensor, for phosphate homeostasis and signaling in rice.	2019	Mol Plant	Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilizer, Ministry of Agriculture, Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	SPX-domain containing proteins play an important role in inorganic phosphate (Pi) sensing, signaling and transport in eukaryotes. In plants, the only SPX-domain containing proteins (SPXs) are known to integrate cellular Pi status and negatively regulate the activity of Pi central regulators, PHOSPATE STARVATION RESPONSE proteins (PHRs). The stability of SPX proteins, such as SPX4 was reduced under Pi-deficient condition. However, the mechanism by which SPXs are degraded is still unknown. In a yeast-two hybrid screen to identify SPX4 stability regulators in rice, we isolated two candidate SPX4 degradation E3 ligases (designed as SDELs), which were post-transcriptionally induced by the Pi starvation. We found that the nucleus and cytoplasm located SDELs had ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and directly ubiquitinated the K213 and K299 lysine residues in SPX4, therefore regulating SPX4 stability. Furthermore, PHR2, the Pi central regulator in rice, could compete with SDELs by interacting with SPX4 under Pi sufficient conditions, which protects SPX4 from ubiquitination and degradation. Consistent with this biochemical function of SDEL1 and SDEL2, enhancing the expression of SDEL1 and SDEL2 results in Pi over-accumulation and induces Pi-starvation signaling even under Pi-sufficient conditions. Conversely, the loss-of-function mutants display lower Pi accumulation and reduced Pi-starvation signaling. Therefore SDEL1 and SDEL2 facilitate the degradation of SPX4 to modulate PHR2 activity and regulate Pi-homeostasis and Pi-signaling in response to external Pi availability in rice.
