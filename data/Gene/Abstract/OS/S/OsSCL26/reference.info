NA	The Splicing Factor OsSCL26 Regulates Phosphorus Homeostasis in Rice.	2023	Plants (Basel)	College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient for plant growth. However, its deficiency poses a significant challenge for crop production. To overcome the low P availability, plants have developed various strategies to regulate their P uptake and usage. In this study, we identified a splicing factor, OsSCL26, belonging to the Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins, that plays a crucial role in regulating P homeostasis in rice. OsSCL26 is expressed in the roots, leaves, and base nodes, with higher expression levels observed in the leaf blades during the vegetative growth stage. The OsSCL26 protein is localized in the nucleus. Mutation of OsSCL26 resulted in the accumulation of P in the shoot compared to the wild-type, and the dwarf phenotype of the osscl26 mutant was alleviated under low P conditions. Further analysis revealed that the accumulated P concentrations in the osscl26 mutant were higher in the old leaves and lower in the new leaves. Furthermore, the P-related genes, including the PHT and SPX family genes, were upregulated in the osscl26 mutant, and the exclusion/inclusion ratio of the two genes, OsSPX-MFS2 and OsNLA2, was increased compared to wild-type rice. These findings suggest that the splicing factor OsSCL26 plays a pivotal role in maintaining P homeostasis in rice by influencing the absorption and distribution of P through the regulation of the transcription and splicing of the P transport genes.
