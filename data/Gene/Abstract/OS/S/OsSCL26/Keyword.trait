OsSCL26	leaf	The Splicing Factor OsSCL26 Regulates Phosphorus Homeostasis in Rice.	 OsSCL26 is expressed in the roots, leaves, and base nodes, with higher expression levels observed in the leaf blades during the vegetative growth stage
OsSCL26	growth	The Splicing Factor OsSCL26 Regulates Phosphorus Homeostasis in Rice.	 OsSCL26 is expressed in the roots, leaves, and base nodes, with higher expression levels observed in the leaf blades during the vegetative growth stage
OsSCL26	shoot	The Splicing Factor OsSCL26 Regulates Phosphorus Homeostasis in Rice.	 Mutation of OsSCL26 resulted in the accumulation of P in the shoot compared to the wild-type, and the dwarf phenotype of the osscl26 mutant was alleviated under low P conditions
OsSCL26	nucleus	The Splicing Factor OsSCL26 Regulates Phosphorus Homeostasis in Rice.	 The OsSCL26 protein is localized in the nucleus
OsSCL26	vegetative	The Splicing Factor OsSCL26 Regulates Phosphorus Homeostasis in Rice.	 OsSCL26 is expressed in the roots, leaves, and base nodes, with higher expression levels observed in the leaf blades during the vegetative growth stage
OsSCL26	homeostasis	The Splicing Factor OsSCL26 Regulates Phosphorus Homeostasis in Rice.	The Splicing Factor OsSCL26 Regulates Phosphorus Homeostasis in Rice.
OsSCL26	homeostasis	The Splicing Factor OsSCL26 Regulates Phosphorus Homeostasis in Rice.	 These findings suggest that the splicing factor OsSCL26 plays a pivotal role in maintaining P homeostasis in rice by influencing the absorption and distribution of P through the regulation of the transcription and splicing of the P transport genes
OsSCL26	dwarf	The Splicing Factor OsSCL26 Regulates Phosphorus Homeostasis in Rice.	 Mutation of OsSCL26 resulted in the accumulation of P in the shoot compared to the wild-type, and the dwarf phenotype of the osscl26 mutant was alleviated under low P conditions
OsSCL26	phosphorus	The Splicing Factor OsSCL26 Regulates Phosphorus Homeostasis in Rice.	The Splicing Factor OsSCL26 Regulates Phosphorus Homeostasis in Rice.
