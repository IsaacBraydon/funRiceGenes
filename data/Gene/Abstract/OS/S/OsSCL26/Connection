OsNLA2	OsSCL26	The Splicing Factor OsSCL26 Regulates Phosphorus Homeostasis in Rice.	 Furthermore, the P-related genes, including the PHT and SPX family genes, were upregulated in the osscl26 mutant, and the exclusion/inclusion ratio of the two genes, OsSPX-MFS2 and OsNLA2, was increased compared to wild-type rice
