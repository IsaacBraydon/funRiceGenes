OsSAMDC	temperature	Differential expression of an S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase gene involved in polyamine biosynthesis under low temperature stress in japonica and indica rice genotypes	 These results suggest that the induction of the OsSAMDC gene in response to cold may be used as a molecular marker for the ability of rice seedlings to withstand exposure to low temperatures
OsSAMDC	abiotic stress	Differential expression of an S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase gene involved in polyamine biosynthesis under low temperature stress in japonica and indica rice genotypes	 We also analyzed the response of OsSAMDC to various abiotic stress treatments and plant hormones
OsSAMDC	resistant	Differential expression of an S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase gene involved in polyamine biosynthesis under low temperature stress in japonica and indica rice genotypes	 Upon exposure to cold stress (5 degrees C) the level of OsSAMDC transcripts in the cold-resistant Yukihikari genotype continued to increase for up to 72 h
OsSAMDC	seedling	Differential expression of an S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase gene involved in polyamine biosynthesis under low temperature stress in japonica and indica rice genotypes	 These results suggest that the induction of the OsSAMDC gene in response to cold may be used as a molecular marker for the ability of rice seedlings to withstand exposure to low temperatures
OsSAMDC	cold stress	Differential expression of an S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase gene involved in polyamine biosynthesis under low temperature stress in japonica and indica rice genotypes	 Upon exposure to cold stress (5 degrees C) the level of OsSAMDC transcripts in the cold-resistant Yukihikari genotype continued to increase for up to 72 h
