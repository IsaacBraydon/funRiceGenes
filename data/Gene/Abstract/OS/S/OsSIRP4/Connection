OsPEX11-1	OsSIRP4	E3 ligase, the Oryza sativa salt-induced RING finger protein 4 (OsSIRP4), negatively regulates salt stress responses via degradation of the OsPEX11-1 protein	E3 ligase, the Oryza sativa salt-induced RING finger protein 4 (OsSIRP4), negatively regulates salt stress responses via degradation of the OsPEX11-1 protein
OsPEX11-1	OsSIRP4	E3 ligase, the Oryza sativa salt-induced RING finger protein 4 (OsSIRP4), negatively regulates salt stress responses via degradation of the OsPEX11-1 protein	OsSIRP4 is an E3 ligase that acts as a negative regulator in the plant response to salt stress via the 26S proteasomal system regulation of substrate proteins, OsPEX11-1, which it provides important information for adaptation and regulation in rice.
