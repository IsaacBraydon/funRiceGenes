Serotonin is a well known neurotransmitter in mammals and plays an important role in various mental functions in humans. In plants, the serotonin biosynthesis pathway and its function are not well understood. The rice sekiguchi lesion (sl) mutants accumulate tryptamine, a candidate substrate for serotonin biosynthesis. We isolated the SL gene by map-based cloning and found that it encodes CYP71P1 in a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase family. A recombinant SL protein exhibited tryptamine 5-hydroxylase enzyme activity and catalyzed the conversion of tryptamine to serotonin. This pathway is novel and has not been reported in mammals. Expression of SL was induced by the N-acetylchitooligosaccharide (chitin) elicitor and by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, a causal agent for rice blast disease. Exogenously applied serotonin induced defense gene expression and cell death in rice suspension cultures and increased resistance to rice blast infection in plants. We also found that serotonin-induced defense gene expression is mediated by the RacGTPase pathway and by the G alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. These results suggest that serotonin plays an important role in rice innate immunity.
NA	Disruption of EARLY LESION LEAF 1, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, induces ROS accumulation and cell death in rice	2020	Plant Journal	State Key Lab of Rice Biology, National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, P. R. China.	LMMs (lesion-mimic mutants) provide a valuable tool to reveal the molecular mechanisms determining programmed cell death in plants. Despite numerous of research, the mechanisms behind PCD and the formation of lesions in various LMMs are still being elucidated. Here, we identified a rice LMM, early lesion leaf 1 (ell1), cloned the causal gene by map-based cloning, and verified this by complementation. ELL1 encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, and the ELL1 protein was located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ell1 mutant exhibited decreased chlorophyll contents, serious chloroplast degradation, up-regulated expression of chloroplast degradation-related genes, and attenuated photosynthetic protein activity, indicating that ELL1 is involved in chloroplast development. RNA-seq analysis showed that genes related to oxygen binding were differentially expressed in ell1 and wild-type plants; histochemical and paraffin sectioning results displayed that hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) and callose accumulated in the ell1 leaves, and the cell structure around the lesion was severely damaged, which indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated and cell death occurred in the mutant. TUNEL and comet experiments revealed that severe DNA degradation and abnormal PCD occurred in the mutant, which implied that excessive ROS accumulation may induce DNA damage and ROS-mediated cell death in the ell1 mutant. Additionally, lesion initiation in the ell1 mutant was light dependent and temperature sensitive. Our findings revealed that ELL1 affects chloroplast development or function, and that loss of ELL1 function induces ROS accumulation and lesion formation in rice.
