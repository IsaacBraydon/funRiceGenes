OsSL|LLM1|ELL1	chloroplast	Disruption of EARLY LESION LEAF 1, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, induces ROS accumulation and cell death in rice	 The ell1 mutant exhibited decreased chlorophyll contents, serious chloroplast degradation, up-regulated expression of chloroplast degradation-related genes, and attenuated photosynthetic protein activity, indicating that ELL1 is involved in chloroplast development
OsSL|LLM1|ELL1	chloroplast	Disruption of EARLY LESION LEAF 1, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, induces ROS accumulation and cell death in rice	 Our findings revealed that ELL1 affects chloroplast development or function, and that loss of ELL1 function induces ROS accumulation and lesion formation in rice
OsSL|LLM1|ELL1	temperature	Disruption of EARLY LESION LEAF 1, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, induces ROS accumulation and cell death in rice	 Additionally, lesion initiation in the ell1 mutant was light dependent and temperature sensitive
OsSL|LLM1|ELL1	development	Disruption of EARLY LESION LEAF 1, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, induces ROS accumulation and cell death in rice	 The ell1 mutant exhibited decreased chlorophyll contents, serious chloroplast degradation, up-regulated expression of chloroplast degradation-related genes, and attenuated photosynthetic protein activity, indicating that ELL1 is involved in chloroplast development
OsSL|LLM1|ELL1	development	Disruption of EARLY LESION LEAF 1, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, induces ROS accumulation and cell death in rice	 Our findings revealed that ELL1 affects chloroplast development or function, and that loss of ELL1 function induces ROS accumulation and lesion formation in rice
OsSL|LLM1|ELL1	cell death	Disruption of EARLY LESION LEAF 1, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, induces ROS accumulation and cell death in rice	 RNA-seq analysis showed that genes related to oxygen binding were differentially expressed in ell1 and wild-type plants; histochemical and paraffin sectioning results displayed that hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) and callose accumulated in the ell1 leaves, and the cell structure around the lesion was severely damaged, which indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated and cell death occurred in the mutant
OsSL|LLM1|ELL1	cell death	Disruption of EARLY LESION LEAF 1, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, induces ROS accumulation and cell death in rice	 TUNEL and comet experiments revealed that severe DNA degradation and abnormal PCD occurred in the mutant, which implied that excessive ROS accumulation may induce DNA damage and ROS-mediated cell death in the ell1 mutant
OsSL|LLM1|ELL1	chloroplast development	Disruption of EARLY LESION LEAF 1, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, induces ROS accumulation and cell death in rice	 The ell1 mutant exhibited decreased chlorophyll contents, serious chloroplast degradation, up-regulated expression of chloroplast degradation-related genes, and attenuated photosynthetic protein activity, indicating that ELL1 is involved in chloroplast development
OsSL|LLM1|ELL1	chloroplast development	Disruption of EARLY LESION LEAF 1, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, induces ROS accumulation and cell death in rice	 Our findings revealed that ELL1 affects chloroplast development or function, and that loss of ELL1 function induces ROS accumulation and lesion formation in rice
OsSL|LLM1|ELL1	chlorophyll content	Disruption of EARLY LESION LEAF 1, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, induces ROS accumulation and cell death in rice	 The ell1 mutant exhibited decreased chlorophyll contents, serious chloroplast degradation, up-regulated expression of chloroplast degradation-related genes, and attenuated photosynthetic protein activity, indicating that ELL1 is involved in chloroplast development
OsSL|LLM1|ELL1	reactive oxygen species	Disruption of EARLY LESION LEAF 1, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, induces ROS accumulation and cell death in rice	 RNA-seq analysis showed that genes related to oxygen binding were differentially expressed in ell1 and wild-type plants; histochemical and paraffin sectioning results displayed that hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) and callose accumulated in the ell1 leaves, and the cell structure around the lesion was severely damaged, which indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated and cell death occurred in the mutant
OsSL|LLM1|ELL1	PCD	Disruption of EARLY LESION LEAF 1, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, induces ROS accumulation and cell death in rice	 TUNEL and comet experiments revealed that severe DNA degradation and abnormal PCD occurred in the mutant, which implied that excessive ROS accumulation may induce DNA damage and ROS-mediated cell death in the ell1 mutant
OsSL|LLM1|ELL1	lesion	Disruption of EARLY LESION LEAF 1, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, induces ROS accumulation and cell death in rice	 RNA-seq analysis showed that genes related to oxygen binding were differentially expressed in ell1 and wild-type plants; histochemical and paraffin sectioning results displayed that hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) and callose accumulated in the ell1 leaves, and the cell structure around the lesion was severely damaged, which indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated and cell death occurred in the mutant
OsSL|LLM1|ELL1	lesion	Disruption of EARLY LESION LEAF 1, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, induces ROS accumulation and cell death in rice	 Additionally, lesion initiation in the ell1 mutant was light dependent and temperature sensitive
