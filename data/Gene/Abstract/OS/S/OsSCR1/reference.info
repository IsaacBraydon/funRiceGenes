NA	Multiple transcriptional factors control stomata development in rice.	2019	New Phytol	MOE Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, China.	The grass stomata can balance the gas exchange and evaporation effectively in rapidly changing environment via their unique anatomical features. Although the key components of stomatal development in Arabidopsis have been largely elucidated during the past decade, the molecular mechanisms that govern stomatal development in grasses are poorly understood. Via the genome editing system and T-DNA insertion lines, the key transcriptional factors (TFs) regulating stomatal development in rice (Oryza sativa) were knocked out. A combination of genetic and biochemical assays subsequently revealed the functions of these TFs. OsSPCH/OsICE is essential for the initiation of stomatal lineage. OsMUTE/OsICE determines meristemoid to guard mother cell (GMC) transition. OsFAMA/OsICE influences subsidiary mother cell asymmetric division and mature stoma differentiation. OsFLP regulates the orientation of GMC symmetric division. More importantly, we found that OsSCR/OsSHR controls the initiation of stomatal lineage cells and the formation of subsidiary cells, and the transcription of OsSCR is activated by OsSPCH and OsMUTE. This study characterized the functions of master regulatory TFs that control each stomatal developmental stage in rice. Our findings are helpful to elucidate how various species reprogramme the molecular mechanisms to generate different stomatal types during evolution. This article is protected by copyright.

NA	SCARECROW is deployed in distinct contexts during rice and maize leaf development.	2022	Development	Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3RB, UK.	The flexible deployment of developmental regulators is an increasingly appreciated aspect of plant development and evolution. The GRAS transcription factor SCARECROW (SCR) regulates the development of the endodermis in Arabidopsis and maize roots, but during leaf development it regulates the development of distinct cell types; bundle-sheath in Arabidopsis and mesophyll in maize. In rice, SCR is implicated in stomatal patterning, but it is unknown whether this function is additional to a role in inner leaf patterning. Here, we demonstrate that two duplicated SCR genes function redundantly in rice. Contrary to previous reports, we show that these genes are necessary for stomatal development, with stomata virtually absent from leaves that are initiated after germination of mutants. The stomatal regulator OsMUTE is downregulated in Osscr1;Osscr2 mutants, indicating that OsSCR acts early in stomatal development. Notably, Osscr1;Osscr2 mutants do not exhibit the inner leaf patterning perturbations seen in Zmscr1;Zmscr1h mutants, and Zmscr1;Zmscr1h mutants do not exhibit major perturbations in stomatal patterning. Taken together, these results indicate that SCR was deployed in different developmental contexts after the divergence of rice and maize around 50 million years ago.
