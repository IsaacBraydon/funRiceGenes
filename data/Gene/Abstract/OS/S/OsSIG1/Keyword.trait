OsSIG1	leaf	The plastid sigma factor SIG1 maintains photosystem I activity via regulated expression of the psaA operon in rice chloroplasts	We previously showed that transcripts of OsSIG1, which encodes one such sigma factor in rice, accumulate relatively late during leaf development
OsSIG1	chloroplast	The plastid sigma factor SIG1 maintains photosystem I activity via regulated expression of the psaA operon in rice chloroplasts	Quantitative RT-PCR and northern blot analyses of chloroplast gene expression revealed that the abundance of transcripts derived from the psaA operon was markedly reduced in OsSIG1-/- plants compared with that in wild-type homozygotes
OsSIG1	chloroplast	The plastid sigma factor SIG1 maintains photosystem I activity via regulated expression of the psaA operon in rice chloroplasts	Our results thus indicate that OsSIG1 plays an important role in the maintenance of photosynthetic activity in mature chloroplasts of rice by regulating expression of chloroplast genes for components of photosystem I
OsSIG1	leaf development	The plastid sigma factor SIG1 maintains photosystem I activity via regulated expression of the psaA operon in rice chloroplasts	We previously showed that transcripts of OsSIG1, which encodes one such sigma factor in rice, accumulate relatively late during leaf development
OsSIG1	leaf development	Differential Expression of Three Plastidial Sigma Factors,OsSIG1,OsSIG2A, andOsSIG2B, during Leaf Development in Rice	Gene expression analysis revealed that the OsSIG2A transcript is more abundant than the OsSIG2B transcript in all tissues tested and that both rice SIG2s are expressed from earlier stages of leaf development than that in the case of OsSIG1
OsSIG1	leaf development	Differential Expression of Three Plastidial Sigma Factors,OsSIG1,OsSIG2A, andOsSIG2B, during Leaf Development in Rice	Differential Expression of Three Plastidial Sigma Factors,OsSIG1,OsSIG2A, andOsSIG2B, during Leaf Development in Rice
