OsSIG1	OsSIG2A	Differential Expression of Three Plastidial Sigma Factors,OsSIG1,OsSIG2A, andOsSIG2B, during Leaf Development in Rice	Gene expression analysis revealed that the OsSIG2A transcript is more abundant than the OsSIG2B transcript in all tissues tested and that both rice SIG2s are expressed from earlier stages of leaf development than that in the case of OsSIG1

DUA1	OsSIG1	A pentatricopeptide repeat protein DUA1 interacts with sigma factor 1 to regulate chloroplast gene expression in Rice	 Furthermore, we demonstrated that sigma factor OsSIG1 interacted with DUA1 in vitro and in vivo
DUA1	OsSIG1	A pentatricopeptide repeat protein DUA1 interacts with sigma factor 1 to regulate chloroplast gene expression in Rice	 Our study reveals that the PPR protein DUA1 plays an important role in regulating PEP-mediated chloroplast gene expression through interacting with OsSIG1, thus modulates chloroplast development in response to environmental signals
