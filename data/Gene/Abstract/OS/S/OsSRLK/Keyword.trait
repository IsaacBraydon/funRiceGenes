OsSRLK	chloroplast	Rice Senescence-Induced Receptor-Like Kinase (OsSRLK) Is Involved in Phytohormone-Mediated Chlorophyll Degradation.	 Furthermore, ultrastructural analysis revealed that ossrlk leaves maintained the chloroplast structure with intact grana stacks during dark incubation; however, the retained green color and preserved chloroplast structures of ossrlk did not enhance the photosynthetic competence during age-dependent senescence in autumn
OsSRLK	senescence	Rice Senescence-Induced Receptor-Like Kinase (OsSRLK) Is Involved in Phytohormone-Mediated Chlorophyll Degradation.	 The detached leaves of ossrlk mutant (ossrlk) contained more green pigment than those of the wild type (WT) during dark-induced senescence (DIS)
OsSRLK	senescence	Rice Senescence-Induced Receptor-Like Kinase (OsSRLK) Is Involved in Phytohormone-Mediated Chlorophyll Degradation.	 Furthermore, ultrastructural analysis revealed that ossrlk leaves maintained the chloroplast structure with intact grana stacks during dark incubation; however, the retained green color and preserved chloroplast structures of ossrlk did not enhance the photosynthetic competence during age-dependent senescence in autumn
OsSRLK	panicle	Rice Senescence-Induced Receptor-Like Kinase (OsSRLK) Is Involved in Phytohormone-Mediated Chlorophyll Degradation.	 In ossrlk, the panicles per plant was increased and the spikelets per panicle were reduced, resulting in similar grain productivity between WT and ossrlk
OsSRLK	grain	Rice Senescence-Induced Receptor-Like Kinase (OsSRLK) Is Involved in Phytohormone-Mediated Chlorophyll Degradation.	 In ossrlk, the panicles per plant was increased and the spikelets per panicle were reduced, resulting in similar grain productivity between WT and ossrlk
OsSRLK	spikelets per panicle	Rice Senescence-Induced Receptor-Like Kinase (OsSRLK) Is Involved in Phytohormone-Mediated Chlorophyll Degradation.	 In ossrlk, the panicles per plant was increased and the spikelets per panicle were reduced, resulting in similar grain productivity between WT and ossrlk
OsSRLK	chlorophyll biogenesis	Rice Senescence-Induced Receptor-Like Kinase (OsSRLK) Is Involved in Phytohormone-Mediated Chlorophyll Degradation.	 By transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing, genes related to phytohormone, senescence, and chlorophyll biogenesis were significantly altered in ossrlk compared to those in WT during DIS
OsSRLK	photosystem	Rice Senescence-Induced Receptor-Like Kinase (OsSRLK) Is Involved in Phytohormone-Mediated Chlorophyll Degradation.	 HPLC and immunoblot assay revealed that degradation of chlorophyll and photosystem II proteins was repressed in ossrlk during DIS
