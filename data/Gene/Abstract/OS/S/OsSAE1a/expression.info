OsSAE1a	 The qRT-PCR assay revealed a constitutive and variable spatiotemporal expression pattern of OsSAE1a in the vegetative and reproductive tissues and was comparable in the root and shoot grown under different Pi regimes |  RNAi-mediated suppression of OsSAE1a exerted variable effects on the concentrations of Pi and total P in different tissues, uptake and distribution of 32Pi, and relative expression levels of several genes that play pivotal roles in the maintenance of Pi homeostasis	 RNAi-mediated suppression of OsSAE1a exerted variable effects on the concentrations of Pi and total P in different tissues, uptake and distribution of 32Pi, and relative expression levels of several genes that play pivotal roles in the maintenance of Pi homeostasis
