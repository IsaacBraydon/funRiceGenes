Understanding pollen tube growth is critical for crop yield maintenance. The pollen tube provides a path for sperm cells for fertilization with egg cells. Cells must be subdivided into functionally and structurally distinct compartments for polar tip growth, and phosphoinositides are thought to be one of the facilitators for polarization during pollen tube growth. OsSNDP3 encodes Sec14-nodulin domain-containing protein and localizes in the nucleus and the microdomains of the plasma membrane in tobacco leaf epidermis cells. OsSNDP3 is thought to bind with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate based on the data including the information of basic amino acids in the C-terminal and colocalization with 2X Pleckstrin homology domain of Phospholipase C delta-1. OsSNDP3 interacts with a protein that contains a class I nodulin domain. We discovered that OsSNDP3 plays a significant role in pollen tube germination using CRISPR/Cas9 systems, whereas another pollen-preferential Sec14-nodulin domain-containing protein, OsSNDP2, additively functions with OsSNDP3 during pollen tube germination. Gene Ontology analysis using downregulated genes in ossndp3 indicated that the expression of genes involved in the phosphatidylinositol metabolic process and tip growth was significantly altered in ossndp3. OsSNDP3 aids pollen polar tip growth by binding with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. We can better understand the roles of phosphoinositides during pollen tube growth by studying the functions of OsSNDP3 and OsSNDP2. And downregulated genes in ossndp3 might be useful targets for future research on polar tip growth.
