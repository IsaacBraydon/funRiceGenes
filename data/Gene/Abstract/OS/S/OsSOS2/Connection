OsbHLH96|OsbHLH044	OsSOS2	Loss-of-function mutations of OsbHLH044 transcription factor lead to salinity sensitivity and a greater chalkiness in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 The expression levels of genes coding for starch (OsAGPL1, OsSSIIa, OsWx, and OsFLO2) and seed storage proteins (GluA1 and Globulin 1) were significantly decreased, indicating that they synthesize less store starch and proteins, resulting in grain chalkiness in the osbhlh044 (OsHKT1;3, OsHAK7, OsSOS1, OsSOS2, OsNHX2, and OsLEA3 but not OsHKT2;1), and starch-related genes (OsSSIIa, OsWx, and OsFLO2) by binding to the G-boxes of their promoters
