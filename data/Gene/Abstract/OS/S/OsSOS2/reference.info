NA	Low-cesium rice: mutation in OsSOS2 reduces radiocesium in rice grains.	2017	Sci Rep	Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, 305-8604, Japan. isatoru@affrc.go.jp.	In Japan, radiocesium contamination in foods has become of great concern and it is a primary issue to reduce grain radiocesium concentration in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, we report a low-cesium rice mutant 1 (lcs1) with the radiocesium concentration in grain about half that in the wild-type cultivar. Genetic analyses revealed that a mutation in OsSOS2, which encodes a serine/threonine-protein kinase required for the salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway in plants, is responsible for the decreased cesium (Cs) concentrations in lcs1. Physiological analyses showed that Cs(+) uptake by lcs1 roots was significantly decreased under low-potassium (K(+)) conditions in the presence of sodium (Na(+)) (low K(+)/Na(+)). The transcript levels of several K(+) and Na(+) transporter genes, such as OsHAK1, OsHAK5, OsAKT1, and OsHKT2;1 were significantly down-regulated in lcs1 grown at low K(+)/Na(+). The decreased Cs(+) uptake in lcs1 might be closely related to the lower expression of these genes due to the K(+)/Na(+) imbalance in the lcs1 roots caused by the OsSOS2 mutation. Since the lcs1 plant had no significant negative effects on agronomic traits when grown in radiocesium-contaminated paddy fields, this mutant could be used directly in agriculture for reducing radiocesium in rice grains.
NA	Unraveling the contribution of OsSOS2 in conferring salinity and drought tolerance in a high-yielding rice.	2022	Physiol Plant	Stress Physiology and Molecular Biology Laboratory, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.	Abiotic stresses are emerging as a potential threat to sustainable agriculture worldwide. Soil salinity and drought will be the major limiting factors for rice productivity in years to come. The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway plays a key role in salinity tolerance by maintaining the cellular ion homeostasis, with SOS2, a S/T kinase, being a vital component. The present study investigated the role of the OsSOS2, a SOS2 homolog from rice, in improving salinity and drought tolerance. Transgenic plants with either overexpression (OE) or knockdown (KD) of OsSOS2 were IR64. Using a combined approach based on physiological, biochemical, anatomical, microscopic, molecular, and agronomic assessment, the evidence presented in this study advocates the role of OsSOS2 in improving salinity and drought tolerance in rice. The OE plants were found to have favourable ion and redox homeostasis when grown in the presence of salinity, while the KD plants showed the reverse pattern. Several key stress-responsive genes were found to work in an orchestrated manner to contribute to this phenotype. Notably, the OE plants showed tolerance to stress at both the seedling and the reproductive stages, addressing the two most sensitive stages of the plant. Keeping in mind the importance of developing crops pants with tolerance to multiple stresses, the present study established the potential of OsSOS2 for biotechnological applications to improve salinity and drought stress tolerance in diverse cultivars of rice.
