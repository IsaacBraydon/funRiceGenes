OsSPL1	abiotic stress	Overexpression of rice sphingosine-1-phoshpate lyase gene OsSPL1 in transgenic tobacco reduces salt and oxidative stress tolerance	" In this study, we performed functional analysis of a rice (Oryza sativa) S1P lyase gene OsSPL1 in transgenic tobacco plants and explored its possible involvement in abiotic stress response
OsSPL1	abiotic stress	Overexpression of rice sphingosine-1-phoshpate lyase gene OsSPL1 in transgenic tobacco reduces salt and oxidative stress tolerance	 Our results suggest that rice OsSPL1 plays an important role in abiotic stress responses"
OsSPL1	oxidative	Overexpression of rice sphingosine-1-phoshpate lyase gene OsSPL1 in transgenic tobacco reduces salt and oxidative stress tolerance	" Overexpression of OsSPL1 in transgenic tobacco resulted in enhanced sensitivity to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), and decreased tolerance to salt and oxidative stress, when compared with the wild type
OsSPL1	oxidative	Overexpression of rice sphingosine-1-phoshpate lyase gene OsSPL1 in transgenic tobacco reduces salt and oxidative stress tolerance	 Furthermore, the expression levels of some selected stress-related genes in OsSPL1-overexpressing plants were reduced after application of salt or oxidative stress, indicating that the altered responsiveness of stress-related genes may be responsible for the reduced tolerance in OsSPL1-overexpressing tobacco plants under salt and oxidative stress
