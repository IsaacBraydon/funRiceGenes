Sphingolipids, including sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), have been shown to function as signaling mediators to regulate diverse aspects of plant growth, development, and stress response. In this study, we performed functional analysis of a rice (Oryza sativa) S1P lyase gene OsSPL1 in transgenic tobacco plants and explored its possible involvement in abiotic stress response. Overexpression of OsSPL1 in transgenic tobacco resulted in enhanced sensitivity to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), and decreased tolerance to salt and oxidative stress, when compared with the wild type. Furthermore, the expression levels of some selected stress-related genes in OsSPL1-overexpressing plants were reduced after application of salt or oxidative stress, indicating that the altered responsiveness of stress-related genes may be responsible for the reduced tolerance in OsSPL1-overexpressing tobacco plants under salt and oxidative stress. Our results suggest that rice OsSPL1 plays an important role in abiotic stress responses.
NA	Molecular characterization of rice sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase gene OsSPL1 and functional analysis of its role in disease resistance response.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Institute of Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310058, People's Republic of China.	Our results indicate that overexpression of OsSPL1 in transgenic tobacco plants attenuated disease resistance and facilitated programmed cell death. Long-chain base phosphates including sphingosine-1-phosphate have been shown to act as signaling mediators in regulating programmed cell death (PCD) and stress responses in mammals. In the present study, we characterized a rice gene OsSPL1, encoding a putative sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase that is involved in metabolism of sphingosine-1-phosphate. Expression of OsSPL1 was down-regulated in rice plants after treatments with salicylic acid, benzothiadiazole and 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, but was induced by infection with a virulent strain of Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. Transgenic tobacco lines with overexpression of OsSPL1 were generated and analyzed for the possible role of OsSPL1 in disease resistance response and PCD. The OsSPL1-overexpressing tobacco plants displayed increased susceptibility to infection of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci (Pst), the causal agent of wildfire disease, showing severity of disease symptom and bacterial titers in inoculated leaves, and attenuated pathogen-induced expression of PR genes after infection of Pst as compared to the wild-type and vector-transformed plants. Higher level of cell death, as revealed by dead cell staining, leakage of electrolyte and expression of hypersensitive response indicator genes, was observed in the OsSPL1-overexpressing plants after treatment with fumonisin B1, a fungal toxin that induces PCD in plants. Our results suggest that OsSPL1 has different functions in regulating disease resistance response and PCD in plants.

However, molecular studies on plant SPL have not been reported to date. Here, we present bioinformatic, molecular and functional analyses of putative SPL proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (designated as AtSPL and OsSPL, respectively). Amino acid sequence comparison revealed that plant SPL contained the pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylase domain and the conserved residue that may be involved in substrate catalysis. When expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, AtSPL and OsSPL corrected the hypersensitive phenotype of the yeast dpl1 deletion strain, which is deficient in endogenous SPL activity, to exogenous supplied sphingolipid long chain bases (LCBs), suggesting that plant SPL protein is functional in vivo in degrading phosphorylated LCBs. In Arabidopsis, AtSPL transcripts were detected in roots, stems, leaves, flowers and siliques. In pAtSPL-AtSPL::GUS transgenic lines, the AtSPL::GUS fusion protein was found in a variety of vegetative and reproductive tissues. AtSPL expression level was dynamically regulated during leaf development and senescence, and was steadily and significantly increased in Arabidopsis seedlings treated with the cell death-inducing fungal toxin fumonisin B1. The potential function of SPL in Arabidopsis is discussed.
