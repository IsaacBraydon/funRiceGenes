OsSPK1	resistance	Resistance protein Pit interacts with the GEF OsSPK1 to activate OsRac1 and trigger rice immunity.	Resistance protein Pit interacts with the GEF OsSPK1 to activate OsRac1 and trigger rice immunity.
OsSPK1	blast	Resistance protein Pit interacts with the GEF OsSPK1 to activate OsRac1 and trigger rice immunity.	 OsSPK1 contributes to signaling by two disease-resistance genes, Pit and Pia, against the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and facilitates OsRac1 activation in vitro and in vivo
OsSPK1	magnaporthe oryzae	Resistance protein Pit interacts with the GEF OsSPK1 to activate OsRac1 and trigger rice immunity.	 OsSPK1 contributes to signaling by two disease-resistance genes, Pit and Pia, against the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and facilitates OsRac1 activation in vitro and in vivo
OsSPK1	immunity	Resistance protein Pit interacts with the GEF OsSPK1 to activate OsRac1 and trigger rice immunity.	 Overall, we conclude that OsSPK1 is a direct and key signaling target of Pit-mediated immunity
