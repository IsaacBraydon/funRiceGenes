NA	Resistance protein Pit interacts with the GEF OsSPK1 to activate OsRac1 and trigger rice immunity.	2018	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Signal Transduction and Immunity Group, Chinese Academy of Sciences Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Shanghai Center for Plant Stress Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 201602 Shanghai, China.	Resistance (R) genes encode intracellular nucleotide-binding/leucine-rich repeat-containing (NLR) family proteins that serve as critical plant immune receptors to induce effector-triggered immunity (ETI). NLR proteins possess a tripartite domain architecture consisting of an N-terminal variable region, a central nucleotide-binding domain, and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat. N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) or Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domains of R proteins appear to serve as platforms to trigger immune responses, because overexpression of the CC or TIR domain of some R proteins is sufficient to induce an immune response. Because direct downstream signaling molecules of R proteins remain obscure, the molecular mechanisms by which R proteins regulate downstream signaling are largely unknown. We reported previously that a rice R protein named Pit triggers ETI through a small GTPase, OsRac1, although how Pit activates OsRac1 is unclear. Here, we identified OsSPK1, a DOCK family guanine nucleotide exchange factor, as an interactor of Pit and activator for OsRac1. OsSPK1 contributes to signaling by two disease-resistance genes, Pit and Pia, against the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and facilitates OsRac1 activation in vitro and in vivo. The CC domain of Pit is required for its binding to OsSPK1, OsRac1 activation, and the induction of cell death. Overall, we conclude that OsSPK1 is a direct and key signaling target of Pit-mediated immunity. Our results shed light on how R proteins trigger ETI through direct downstream molecules.
NA	The OsSPK1-OsRac1-RAI1 defense signaling pathway is shared by two distantly related NLR proteins in rice blast resistance.	2021	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Ecological Control of Fujian-Taiwan Crop Pests, Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Genetics, Breeding and Multiple Utilization of Crops, Plant Immunity Center, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, Fujian 350002, China.	Resistance (R) proteins are important components of plant innate immunity. Most known R proteins are nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins. Although a number of signaling components downstream of NLRs have been identified, we lack a general understanding of the signaling pathways. Here, we used the interaction between rice (Oryza sativa) and Magnaporthe oryzae to study signaling of rice NLRs in response to blast infection. We found that in blast resistance mediated by the NLR PIRICULARIA ORYZAE RESISTANCE IN DIGU 3 (PID3), the guanine nucleotide exchange factor OsSPK1 works downstream of PID3. OsSPK1 activates the small GTPase OsRac1, which in turn transduces the signal to the transcription factor RAC IMMUNITY1 (RAI1). Further investigation revealed that the three signaling components also play important roles in disease resistance mediated by the distantly related NLR protein Pi9, suggesting that the OsSPK1-OsRac1-RAI1 signaling pathway could be conserved across rice NLR-induced blast resistance. In addition, we observed changes in RAI1 levels during blast infection, which led to identification of OsRPT2a, a subunit of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome. OsRPT2a seemed to be responsible for RAI1 turnover in a 26S proteasome-dependent manner. Collectively, our results suggest a defense signaling route that might be common to NLR proteins in response to blast infection.
