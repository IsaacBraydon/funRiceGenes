Generating a new variety of plant with erect-leaf is a critical strategy to improve rice grain yield, as plants with this trait can be dense-planted. The erect-leaf is a significant morphological trait partially regulated by Brassinosteroids (BRs) in rice plants. So far, only a few genes can be used for molecular breeding in rice. Here, we identified OsBAK1 as a potential gene to alter rice architecture. Based on rice genome sequences, four closely related homologs of Arabidopsis BAK1 (AtBAK1) gene were amplified. Phylogenetic analysis and suppression of a weak Arabidopsis mutant bri1-5 indicated that OsBAK1 (Os08g0174700) is the closest relative of AtBAK1. Genetic, physiological, and biochemical analyses all suggest that the function of OsBAK1 is conserved with AtBAK1. Overexpression of a truncated intracellular domain of OsBAK1, but not the extracellular domain of OsBAK1, resulted in a dwarfed phenotype, similar to the rice BR-insensitive mutant plants. The expression of OsBAK1 changed important agricultural traits of rice such as plant height, leaf erectness, grain morphologic features, and disease resistance responses. Our results suggested that a new rice variety with erect-leaf and normal reproduction can be generated simply by suppressing the expression level of OsBAK1. Therefore, OsBAK1 is a potential molecular breeding tool for improving rice grain yield by modifying rice architecture.

Since the identification of BRI1-Associated receptor Kinase 1 (BAK1), a member of the Somatic Embryogenesis Receptor Kinase (SERK) family, the dual functions of BAK1 in BR signaling and innate immunity in Arabidopsis have attracted considerable attention as clues for understanding developmental processes that must be balanced between growth and defense over the life of plants. Here, we extended our research to study cellular functions of OsSERKs in rice. As it was difficult to identify an authentic ortholog of AtBAK1 in rice, we generated transgenic rice in which the expression of multiple OsSERK genes, including OsBAK1, was reduced by OsBAK1 RNA interference. Resulting transgenic rice showed reduced levels of Os-BAK1 and decreased sensitivity to BL, leading to semidwarfism in overall growth. Moreover, they resulted in abnormal growth patterns, especially in leaf development. Most of the OsBAK1RNAi transgenic rice plants were defective in the development of bulliform cells in the leaf epidermal layer. They also showed increased expression level of pathogenesis-related gene and enhanced susceptibility to a rice blast-causing fungal pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae. These results indicate that OsSERK genes, such as OsBAK1, play versatile roles in rice growth and development.
NA	Two rice receptor-like kinases maintain male fertility under changing temperatures.	2017	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic and Developmental Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.	Plants employ dynamic molecular networks to control development in response to environmental changes, yet the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we report the identification of two rice leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases, Thermo-Sensitive Genic Male Sterile 10 (TMS10) and its close homolog TMS10-Like (TMS10L), which redundantly function in the maintenance of the tapetal cell layer and microspore/pollen viability under normal temperature conditions with TMS10 playing an essential role in higher temperatures (namely, 28 °„C). tms10 displays male sterility under high temperatures but male fertility under low temperatures, and the tms10 tms10l double mutant shows complete male sterility under both high and low temperatures. Biochemical and genetic assays indicate that the kinase activity conferred by the intracellular domain of TMS10 is essential for tapetal degeneration and male fertility under high temperatures. Furthermore, indica or japonica rice varieties that contain mutations in TMS10, created by genetic crosses or genome editing, also exhibit thermo-sensitive genic male sterility. These findings demonstrate that TMS10 and TMS10L act as a key switch in postmeiotic tapetal development and pollen development by buffering environmental temperature changes, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms by which plants develop phenotypic plasticity via genotype-environment temperature interaction. TMS10 may be used as a genetic resource for the development of hybrid seed production systems in crops.
