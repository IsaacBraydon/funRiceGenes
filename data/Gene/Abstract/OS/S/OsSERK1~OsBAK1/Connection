OsBISERK1|OsSERK1|OsBAK1	OsSERK2	Expression of SERK family receptor-like protein kinase genes in rice	 In this study, we isolated two novel rice genes, OsSERK1 and OsSERK2, belonging to the SERK-family
COE1	OsBISERK1|OsSERK1|OsBAK1	COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice	 COE1 encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, whose amino acid sequence is similar to that of brassinosteroid-insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1), and which is localized at the plasma membrane| Because of the sequence similarity of COE1 to BAK1, we also examined the involvement of brassinosteroids in CV formation
