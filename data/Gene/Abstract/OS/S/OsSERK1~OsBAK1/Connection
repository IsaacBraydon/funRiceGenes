OsBISERK1|OsSERK1|OsBAK1|TBP1	OsSERK2	Expression of SERK family receptor-like protein kinase genes in rice	In this study, we isolated two novel rice genes, OsSERK1 and OsSERK2, belonging to the SERK-family
COE1	OsBISERK1|OsSERK1|OsBAK1|TBP1	COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice	COE1 encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, whose amino acid sequence is similar to that of brassinosteroid-insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1), and which is localized at the plasma membrane
COE1	OsBISERK1|OsSERK1|OsBAK1|TBP1	COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice	Because of the sequence similarity of COE1 to BAK1, we also examined the involvement of brassinosteroids in CV formation
OsBISERK1|OsSERK1|OsBAK1|TBP1	OsSERK2	OsSERK1 regulates rice development but not immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae or Magnaporthe oryzae	In yeast, OsSERK1 interacts with itself forming homodimers, and also interacts with the kinase domains of OsSERK2 and BRI1, respectively.
D61|OsBRI1	OsBISERK1|OsSERK1|OsBAK1|TBP1	OsSERK1 regulates rice development but not immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae or Magnaporthe oryzae	In yeast, OsSERK1 interacts with itself forming homodimers, and also interacts with the kinase domains of OsSERK2 and BRI1, respectively.
OsBISERK1|OsSERK1|OsBAK1|TBP1	OsI-BAK1	Brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated kinase 1 (OsI-BAK1) is associated with grain filling and leaf development in rice.	The aim of this study is to investigate the functions of a rice OsBAK1 homologue, designated as OsI-BAK1, which is highly expressed after heading
OsBISERK1|OsSERK1|OsBAK1|TBP1	OsREM4.1	OsREM4.1 Interacts with OsSERK1 to Coordinate the Interlinking between Abscisic Acid and Brassinosteroid Signaling in Rice.	OsREM4.1 Interacts with OsSERK1 to Coordinate the Interlinking between Abscisic Acid and Brassinosteroid Signaling in Rice.
OsBISERK1|OsSERK1|OsBAK1|TBP1	OsPRA2	OsPRA2 fine-tunes rice brassinosteroid receptor.	 Recently we have reported that a rice small G protein, OsPRA2, bound to the BR receptor OsBRI1 at the plasma membrane (PM) and inhibited its kinase activity and its interaction with the co-receptor OsBAK1, leading to a lower sensitivity to BR treatment and dephosphorylation of OsBZR1
