Some SERK-family receptor-like protein kinase genes have been shown to confer embryonic competence to cells. In this study, we isolated two novel rice genes, OsSERK1 and OsSERK2, belonging to the SERK-family. OsSERK2 showed constitutive expression. The OsSERK1 promoter showed reporter gene activities in some specific tissues in a germinating seed, leaf and root, but not in a developing embryo. This promoter activity suggests that OsSERK1 may have roles in non-embryonic tissues rather than in the embryo.

Here we report on the isolation and characterization of a somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase (OsSERK1) gene in rice (Oryza sativa). The OsSERK1 gene belongs to a small subfamily of receptor-like kinase genes in rice and shares a highly conserved gene structure and extensive sequence homology with previously reported plant SERK genes. Though it has a basal level of expression in various rice organs/tissues, as high expression level was detected in rice callus during somatic embryogenesis. Suppression of OsSERK1 expression in transgenic calli by RNA interference resulted in a significant reduction of shoot regeneration rate (from 72% to 14% in the japonica rice Zhonghua11). Overexpression of OsSERK1, however, increased the shoot regeneration rate (from 72% to 86%). Interestingly, OsSERK1 is significantly activated by the rice blast fungus, particularly during the incompatible interaction, and is associated with host cell death in Sekigushi lesion mimic mutants. This gene is also inducible by defense signaling molecules such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid. Furthermore, constitutive overexpression of OsSERK1 in two rice cultivars led to an increase in host resistance to the blast fungus. Our data suggest that OsSERK1 may partially mediate defense signal transduction in addition to its basic role in somatic embryogenesis.

Summary Leaf veins have a complex network pattern. Formation of this vein pattern has been widely studied as a model of tissue pattern formation in plants. To understand the molecular mechanism governing the vascular patterning process, we isolated the rice mutant, commissural vein excessive1 (coe1). The coe1 mutants had short commissural vein (CV) intervals and produced clustered CVs. Application of 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid and brefeldin A decreased CV intervals, and application of 1-naphthaleneacetic acid increased CV intervals in wild-type rice; however, coe1 mutants were insensitive to these chemicals. COE1 encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, whose amino acid sequence is similar to that of brassinosteroid-insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1), and which is localized at the plasma membrane. Because of the sequence similarity of COE1 to BAK1, we also examined the involvement of brassinosteroids in CV formation. Brassinolide, an active brassinosteroid, decreased the CV intervals of wild-type rice, and brassinazole, an inhibitor of brassinosteroid biosynthesis, increased the CV intervals of wild-type rice, but coe1 mutants showed insensitivity to these chemicals. These results suggest that auxin and brassinosteroids regulate CV intervals in opposite directions, and COE1 may regulate CV intervals downstream of auxin and brassinosteroid signals.

Generating a new variety of plant with erect-leaf is a critical strategy to improve rice grain yield, as plants with this trait can be dense-planted. The erect-leaf is a significant morphological trait partially regulated by Brassinosteroids (BRs) in rice plants. So far, only a few genes can be used for molecular breeding in rice. Here, we identified OsBAK1 as a potential gene to alter rice architecture. Based on rice genome sequences, four closely related homologs of Arabidopsis BAK1 (AtBAK1) gene were amplified. Phylogenetic analysis and suppression of a weak Arabidopsis mutant bri1-5 indicated that OsBAK1 (Os08g0174700) is the closest relative of AtBAK1. Genetic, physiological, and biochemical analyses all suggest that the function of OsBAK1 is conserved with AtBAK1. Overexpression of a truncated intracellular domain of OsBAK1, but not the extracellular domain of OsBAK1, resulted in a dwarfed phenotype, similar to the rice BR-insensitive mutant plants. The expression of OsBAK1 changed important agricultural traits of rice such as plant height, leaf erectness, grain morphologic features, and disease resistance responses. Our results suggested that a new rice variety with erect-leaf and normal reproduction can be generated simply by suppressing the expression level of OsBAK1. Therefore, OsBAK1 is a potential molecular breeding tool for improving rice grain yield by modifying rice architecture.

Since the identification of BRI1-Associated receptor Kinase 1 (BAK1), a member of the Somatic Embryogenesis Receptor Kinase (SERK) family, the dual functions of BAK1 in BR signaling and innate immunity in Arabidopsis have attracted considerable attention as clues for understanding developmental processes that must be balanced between growth and defense over the life of plants. Here, we extended our research to study cellular functions of OsSERKs in rice. As it was difficult to identify an authentic ortholog of AtBAK1 in rice, we generated transgenic rice in which the expression of multiple OsSERK genes, including OsBAK1, was reduced by OsBAK1 RNA interference. Resulting transgenic rice showed reduced levels of Os-BAK1 and decreased sensitivity to BL, leading to semidwarfism in overall growth. Moreover, they resulted in abnormal growth patterns, especially in leaf development. Most of the OsBAK1RNAi transgenic rice plants were defective in the development of bulliform cells in the leaf epidermal layer. They also showed increased expression level of pathogenesis-related gene and enhanced susceptibility to a rice blast-causing fungal pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae. These results indicate that OsSERK genes, such as OsBAK1, play versatile roles in rice growth and development.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs11033-007-9080-8.pdf	Molecular characterization and expression analysis of OsBISERK1, a gene encoding a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, during disease resistance responses in rice	2008	Mol Biol Rep	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Institute of Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310029, P.R. China.	A rice gene, OsBISERK1, encoding a protein belonging to SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE (SERK) type of leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) was identified. The OsBISERK1 encodes a 624 aa protein with high level of identity to known plant SERKs. OsBISERK1 contains a hydrophobic signal peptide, a leucine zipper, and five leucine-rich repeat motifs in the extracellular domain; the cytoplasmic region carries a proline-rich region and a single transmembrane domain, as well as a conserved intracellular serine/threonine protein kinase domain. OsBISERK1 has a low level of basal expression in leaf tissue. However, expression of OsBISERK1 was induced by treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), which is capable of inducing disease resistance in rice, and also up-regulated after inoculation with Magnaporthe grisea in BTH-treated rice seedlings and during incompatible interaction between a blast-resistant rice genotype and M. grisea. The results suggest that OsBISERK1 may be involved in disease resistance responses in rice.
NA	OsSERK1 regulates rice development but not immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae or Magnaporthe oryzae	2014	J Integr Plant Biol	Department of Plant Pathology and the Genome Center, University of California, Davis, California, 95616, USA; Joint Bioenergy Institute, Emeryville, California, 94710, USA; Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology of Jiangsu Province, College of Agriculture, Yangzhou University/Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics of the Ministry of Education, Yangzhou, 225009, China.	Somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase (SERK) proteins play pivotal roles in regulation of plant development and immunity. The rice genome contains two SERK genes, OsSerk1 and OsSerk2. We previously demonstrated that OsSerk2 is required for rice Xa21-mediated resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and for normal development. Here we report the molecular characterization of OsSerk1. Overexpression of OsSerk1 results in a semi-dwarf phenotype whereas silencing of OsSerk1 results in a reduced angle of the lamina joint. OsSerk1 is not required for rice resistance to Xoo or Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae). Overexpression of OsSerk1 in OsSerk2-silenced lines complements phenotypes associated with brassinosteroid (BR) signaling defects, but not the disease resistance phenotype mediated by Xa21. In yeast, OsSERK1 interacts with itself forming homodimers, and also interacts with the kinase domains of OsSERK2 and BRI1, respectively. OsSERK1 is a functional protein kinase capable of auto-phosphorylation in vitro. We conclude that, whereas OsSERK2 regulates both rice development and immunity, OsSERK1 functions in rice development but not immunity to Xoo and M. oryzae.
NA	08SG2/OsBAK1 regulates grain size and number, and functions differently in Indica and Japonica backgrounds in rice.	2017	Rice (N Y)	Rice Research Institute of Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu Wenjiang, Sichuan, 611130, China.	Both grain size and grain number are significant for rice yield. In the past decade, a number of genes related to grain size and grain number have been documented, however, the regulatory mechanisms underlying them remains ambiguous.We identified a rice small grain (sg2) mutant in an EMS mutant library generated from an indica variety, Shuhui498. Using the MutMap gene mapping strategy, we identified two linkage regions on chromosome 7 and 8, respectively, consistent with the segregation ratios in the F2 population. We focused on the linkage region on chromosome 8, and named this locus as 08sg2. One of three SNPs identified in the linkage region was located in an exon of OsBAK1, leading to a nonsynonymous mutation in the kinase domain. The plant harboring the mutant version 08sg2 locus exhibited a decreased grain size, grain number and plant height. Cytological analysis indicated that 08SG2 regulated spikelet hull development by affecting cell proliferation. The grain size and number of knockout mutants of OsBAK1 in the japonica background were significantly decreased, but less so than in 08sg2, supporting the idea that the SNP in OsBAK1 was responsible for the 08sg2 phenotype, but that 08SG2/OsBAK1 function differently in indica and japonica backgrounds. 08sg2 was insensitive to 24-epiBL, and the expression of BR-related genes was obviously altered in 08sg2. The proportionally decreased grain length when 08sg2 and GS3 were combined indicate that 08SG2 and GS3 regulate grain length independently.Our work shows that 08SG2/OsBAK1 is important for rice yield in both indica and japonica backgrounds, by regulating grain size and grain number, and the function of 08SG2/OsBAK1 is obviously affected by genetic background. The amino acid substituted in 08sg2 is highly conserved among different species, supporting the idea that it is important for the molecular function of 08SG2/OsBAK1. Together, our work is helpful for fully understanding the function of 08SG2/OsBAK1.
