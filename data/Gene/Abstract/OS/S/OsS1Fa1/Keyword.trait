OsS1Fa1	seedlings	Overexpression of Rice OsS1Fa1 Gene Confers Drought Tolerance in Arabidopsis.	 OsS1Fa1 was highly expressed in leaf, culm, and root tissues of rice seedlings during vegetative growth and was significantly induced under drought stress
OsS1Fa1	root	Overexpression of Rice OsS1Fa1 Gene Confers Drought Tolerance in Arabidopsis.	 OsS1Fa1 was highly expressed in leaf, culm, and root tissues of rice seedlings during vegetative growth and was significantly induced under drought stress
OsS1Fa1	growth	Overexpression of Rice OsS1Fa1 Gene Confers Drought Tolerance in Arabidopsis.	 OsS1Fa1 was highly expressed in leaf, culm, and root tissues of rice seedlings during vegetative growth and was significantly induced under drought stress
OsS1Fa1	drought	Overexpression of Rice OsS1Fa1 Gene Confers Drought Tolerance in Arabidopsis.	Overexpression of Rice OsS1Fa1 Gene Confers Drought Tolerance in Arabidopsis.
OsS1Fa1	drought	Overexpression of Rice OsS1Fa1 Gene Confers Drought Tolerance in Arabidopsis.	 OsS1Fa1 was highly expressed in leaf, culm, and root tissues of rice seedlings during vegetative growth and was significantly induced under drought stress
OsS1Fa1	drought	Overexpression of Rice OsS1Fa1 Gene Confers Drought Tolerance in Arabidopsis.	 OsS1Fa1 overexpression in Arabidopsis induced the expression of selected drought-responsive genes and enhanced the survival rate of transgenic lines under drought
OsS1Fa1	drought	Overexpression of Rice OsS1Fa1 Gene Confers Drought Tolerance in Arabidopsis.	 Together, our data indicate that the small protein OsS1Fa1 is induced by drought and is post-translationally regulated, and the ectopic expression of OsS1Fa1 protects plants from drought stress
OsS1Fa1	tolerance	Overexpression of Rice OsS1Fa1 Gene Confers Drought Tolerance in Arabidopsis.	Overexpression of Rice OsS1Fa1 Gene Confers Drought Tolerance in Arabidopsis.
OsS1Fa1	vegetative	Overexpression of Rice OsS1Fa1 Gene Confers Drought Tolerance in Arabidopsis.	 OsS1Fa1 was highly expressed in leaf, culm, and root tissues of rice seedlings during vegetative growth and was significantly induced under drought stress
