OsS1Fa1	Overexpression of Rice OsS1Fa1 Gene Confers Drought Tolerance in Arabidopsis. |  OsS1Fa1 overexpression in Arabidopsis induced the expression of selected drought-responsive genes and enhanced the survival rate of transgenic lines under drought |  Together, our data indicate that the small protein OsS1Fa1 is induced by drought and is post-translationally regulated, and the ectopic expression of OsS1Fa1 protects plants from drought stress	Overexpression of Rice OsS1Fa1 Gene Confers Drought Tolerance in Arabidopsis. |  OsS1Fa1 overexpression in Arabidopsis induced the expression of selected drought-responsive genes and enhanced the survival rate of transgenic lines under drought
