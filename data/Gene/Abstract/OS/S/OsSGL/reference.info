NA	OsSGL, a novel pleiotropic stress-related gene enhances grain length and yield in rice.	2016	Sci Rep	Key Laboratory of Agro-ecological Processes in Subtropical Region, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changsha, Hunan 410125, China.	Abiotic stress seriously affects the yield of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Grain yield in rice is multiplicatively determined by the number of panicles, number of grains per panicle, and grain weight. Here, we describe the molecular and functional characterization of STRESS_tolerance and GRAIN_LENGTH (OsSGL), a rice gene strongly up-regulated by a wide spectrum of abiotic stresses. OsSGL encodes a putative member of the DUF1645 protein family of unknown function. Overexpression of OsSGL significantly altered certain development processes greatly and positively affecting an array of traits in transgenic rice plants, including increased grain length, grain weight and grain number per panicle, resulting in a significant increase in yield. Microscopical analysis showed that the enhanced OsSGL expression promoted cell division and grain filling. Microarray and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses revealed that a large number of genes involved in stress-response, cell cycle and cytokinin signaling processes were induced or suppressed in OsSGL-overexpressing plants. Together, our results suggest that OsSGL may regulate stress-tolerance and cell growth by acting via a cytokinin signaling pathway. This study not only contributes to our understanding of the underlying mechanism regulating rice stress-tolerance and grain length, but also provides a strategy for tailor-made crop yield improvement.
NA	OsSGL, a Novel DUF1645 Domain-Containing Protein, Confers Enhanced Drought Tolerance in Transgenic Rice and Arabidopsis.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Agro-ecological Processes in Subtropical Region, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences Changsha, China.	Drought is a major environmental factor that limits plant growth and crop productivity. Genetic engineering is an effective approach to improve drought tolerance in various crops, including rice (Oryza sativa). Functional characterization of relevant genes is a prerequisite when identifying candidates for such improvements. We investigated OsSGL (Oryza sativa Stress tolerance and Grain Length), a novel DUF1645 domain-containing protein from rice. OsSGL was up-regulated by multiple stresses and localized to the nucleus. Transgenic plants over-expressing or hetero-expressing OsSGL conferred significantly improved drought tolerance in transgenic rice and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively. The overexpressing plants accumulated higher levels of proline and soluble sugars but lower malondialdehyde (MDA) contents under osmotic stress. Our RNA-sequencing data demonstrated that several stress-responsive genes were significantly altered in transgenic rice plants. We unexpectedly observed that those overexpressing rice plants also had extensive root systems, perhaps due to the altered transcript levels of auxin- and cytokinin-associated genes. These results suggest that the mechanism by which OsSGL confers enhanced drought tolerance is due to the modulated expression of stress-responsive genes, higher accumulations of osmolytes, and enlarged root systems.
NA	Transcription factor OsSGL is a regulator of starch synthesis and grain quality in rice.	2022	J Exp Bot	College of Biology, State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, and Hunan Province Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Developmental Regulation, Hunan University, Changsha, P. R. China.	Starch biosynthesis during rice endosperm development is important for grain quality, as it influences grain size and physico-chemical properties, which together determine rice eating quality. Cereal starch biosynthetic pathways have been comprehensively investigated; however, their regulation, especially by transcriptional repressors remains largely unknown. Here, we identified a DUF1645 domain-containing protein, STRESS_tolerance and GRAIN_LENGTH (OsSGL), that participates in regulating rice starch biosynthesis. Overexpression of OsSGL reduced total starch and amylose content in the endosperm compared with the wild type. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-seq analyses indicated that OsSGL targets the transcriptional activity of several starch and sucrose metabolism genes. In addition, ChIP-qPCR, yeast one-hybrid, EMSA and dual-luciferase assays demonstrated that OsSGL directly inhibits the expression of SUCROSE SYNTHASE 1 (OsSUS1) in the endosperm. Furthermore, OsSUS1 interacts with OsSGL to release its transcriptional repression ability. Unexpectedly, our results also show that knock down and mutation of OsSGL disrupts the starch biosynthetic pathway, causing lower starch and amylose content. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that accurate control of OsSGL homeostasis is essential for starch synthesis and grain quality. In addition, we revealed the molecular mechanism of OsSGL in regulating starch biosynthesis-related genes, which are required for grain quality.
