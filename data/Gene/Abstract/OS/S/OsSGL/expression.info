OsSGL	 Overexpression of OsSGL significantly altered certain development processes greatly and positively affecting an array of traits in transgenic rice plants, including increased grain length, grain weight and grain number per panicle, resulting in a significant increase in yield |  Microscopical analysis showed that the enhanced OsSGL expression promoted cell division and grain filling	 Overexpression of OsSGL significantly altered certain development processes greatly and positively affecting an array of traits in transgenic rice plants, including increased grain length, grain weight and grain number per panicle, resulting in a significant increase in yield
OsSGL	 Overexpression of OsSGL reduced total starch and amylose content in the endosperm compared with the wild type |  In addition, ChIP-qPCR, yeast one-hybrid, EMSA and dual-luciferase assays demonstrated that OsSGL directly inhibits the expression of SUCROSE SYNTHASE 1 (OsSUS1) in the endosperm	 Overexpression of OsSGL reduced total starch and amylose content in the endosperm compared with the wild type
