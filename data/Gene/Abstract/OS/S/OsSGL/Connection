OsSGL	OsSOG1	SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE 1 plays rice-specific roles in DNA damage response and repair.	 Rice SOG1 (OsSOG1) and SOG1-like (OsSGL) were identified as putative AtSOG1 orthologs with complete or partial conservation of the serine-glutamine (SQ) motifs involved in activation via phosphorylation
OsSGL	OsSOG1	SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE 1 plays rice-specific roles in DNA damage response and repair.	 In addition to OsSOG1 or OsSGL knockout mutants, OsSOG1 non-phosphorylatable mutants (OsSOG1-7A) were generated by homologous recombination-mediated gene targeting (GT)
OsSGL	OsSOG1	SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE 1 plays rice-specific roles in DNA damage response and repair.	 Based on the analysis of DNA damage susceptibility and the effect on the expression of DNA repair-related genes using these mutants, we have demonstrated that OsSOG1 plays a more important role than OsSGL in controlling the DDR and DNA repair
