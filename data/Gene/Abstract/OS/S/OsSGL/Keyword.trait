OsSGL	growth	OsSGL, a novel pleiotropic stress-related gene enhances grain length and yield in rice.	 Together, our results suggest that OsSGL may regulate stress-tolerance and cell growth by acting via a cytokinin signaling pathway
OsSGL	grain	OsSGL, a novel pleiotropic stress-related gene enhances grain length and yield in rice.	 Overexpression of OsSGL significantly altered certain development processes greatly and positively affecting an array of traits in transgenic rice plants, including increased grain length, grain weight and grain number per panicle, resulting in a significant increase in yield
OsSGL	grain	OsSGL, a novel pleiotropic stress-related gene enhances grain length and yield in rice.	 Microscopical analysis showed that the enhanced OsSGL expression promoted cell division and grain filling
