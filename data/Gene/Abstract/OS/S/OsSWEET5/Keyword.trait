OsSWEET5	growth	Overexpression of OsSWEET5 in rice causes growth retardation and precocious senescence.	Overexpression of OsSWEET5 in rice causes growth retardation and precocious senescence.
OsSWEET5	auxin	Overexpression of OsSWEET5 in rice causes growth retardation and precocious senescence.	 Taken together, our findings suggest that OsSWEET5 plays a crucial role in regulating the crosstalk between sugar and auxin in rice
OsSWEET5	transporter	Overexpression of OsSWEET5 in rice causes growth retardation and precocious senescence.	 Heterologous expression assay indicated that OsSWEET5 encoded a galactose transporter in yeast
OsSWEET5	sugar	Overexpression of OsSWEET5 in rice causes growth retardation and precocious senescence.	 Taken together, our findings suggest that OsSWEET5 plays a crucial role in regulating the crosstalk between sugar and auxin in rice
