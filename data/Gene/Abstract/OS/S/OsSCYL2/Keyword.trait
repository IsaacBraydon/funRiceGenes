OsSCYL2	resistance	A conserved clathrin-coated vesicle component, OsSCYL2, regulates plant innate immunity in rice.	 Although mutants of OsSCYL2 showed additional defects in the photosynthetic system, they exhibited enhanced resistance to bacterial pathogens
OsSCYL2	cell death	A conserved clathrin-coated vesicle component, OsSCYL2, regulates plant innate immunity in rice.	 Here, we show that mutation of OsSCYL2 in rice gave rise to a novel phenotype-hypersensitive response-like (HR) cell death in a light-dependent manner
OsSCYL2	cell death	A conserved clathrin-coated vesicle component, OsSCYL2, regulates plant innate immunity in rice.	 OsSCYL2 interacted with OsSPL28, subunit of a clathrin-associated adaptor protein that is known to regulate HR-like cell death in rice
OsSCYL2	R protein	A conserved clathrin-coated vesicle component, OsSCYL2, regulates plant innate immunity in rice.	 OsSCYL2 interacted with OsSPL28, subunit of a clathrin-associated adaptor protein that is known to regulate HR-like cell death in rice
