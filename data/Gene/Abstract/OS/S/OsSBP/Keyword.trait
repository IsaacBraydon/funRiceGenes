OsSBP	biotic stress	"Enhanced Resistance to Blast Fungus and Bacterial Blight in Transgenic Rice Constitutively ExpressingOsSBP, a Rice Homologue of Mammalian Selenium-binding Proteins"	" Additionally, the OsSBP protein might have a role in modulating the defense mechanism to biotic stress in rice"
OsSBP	blast	Enhanced Resistance to Blast Fungus and Bacterial Blight in Transgenic Rice Constitutively ExpressingOsSBP, a Rice Homologue of Mammalian Selenium-binding Proteins	The rice Oryza sativa selenium-binding protein homologue (OsSBP) gene encodes a homologue of mammalian selenium-binding proteins, and it has been isolated as one of the genes induced by treating a plant with a cerebroside elicitor from rice blast fungus| Plants overexpressing OsSBP showed enhanced resistance to a virulent strain of rice blast fungus as well as to rice bacterial blight| The expression of defense-related genes and the accumulation of phytoalexin after infection by rice blast fungus were accelerated in the OsSBP overexpressors|Enhanced Resistance to Blast Fungus and Bacterial Blight in Transgenic Rice Constitutively ExpressingOsSBP, a Rice Homologue of Mammalian Selenium-binding Proteins
OsSBP	blight	Enhanced Resistance to Blast Fungus and Bacterial Blight in Transgenic Rice Constitutively ExpressingOsSBP, a Rice Homologue of Mammalian Selenium-binding Proteins	 Plants overexpressing OsSBP showed enhanced resistance to a virulent strain of rice blast fungus as well as to rice bacterial blight|Enhanced Resistance to Blast Fungus and Bacterial Blight in Transgenic Rice Constitutively ExpressingOsSBP, a Rice Homologue of Mammalian Selenium-binding Proteins
OsSBP	defense	"Enhanced Resistance to Blast Fungus and Bacterial Blight in Transgenic Rice Constitutively ExpressingOsSBP, a Rice Homologue of Mammalian Selenium-binding Proteins"	" The possible role of OsSBP in plant defense was evaluated by using a transgenic approach| The expression of defense-related genes and the accumulation of phytoalexin after infection by rice blast fungus were accelerated in the OsSBP overexpressors| These results suggest that the upregulation of OsSBP expression conferred enhanced tolerance to different pathogens, possibly by increasing plant sensitivity to endogenous defense responses| Additionally, the OsSBP protein might have a role in modulating the defense mechanism to biotic stress in rice"
