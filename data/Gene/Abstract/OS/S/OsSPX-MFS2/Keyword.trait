OsSPX-MFS2	 pi 	Complex regulation of two target genes encoding SPX-MFS proteins by rice miR827 in response to phosphate starvation	In parallel, we analyzed the responses of the two OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2 gene targets to Pi starvation
OsSPX-MFS2	 pi 	Complex regulation of two target genes encoding SPX-MFS proteins by rice miR827 in response to phosphate starvation	In contrast, OsSPX-MFS2 responds in a diametrically opposed manner to Pi starvation
OsSPX-MFS2	 pi 	Complex regulation of two target genes encoding SPX-MFS proteins by rice miR827 in response to phosphate starvation	The accumulation of OsSPX-MFS2 mRNA is dramatically enhanced under Pi starvation, suggesting the involvement of complex regulation of osa-miR827 and its two target genes
OsSPX-MFS2	 pi 	Complex regulation of two target genes encoding SPX-MFS proteins by rice miR827 in response to phosphate starvation	This suggests that OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2 are both negatively regulated by osa-miR827 abundance although they respond differently to external Pi conditions
OsSPX-MFS2	phosphate	Complex regulation of two target genes encoding SPX-MFS proteins by rice miR827 in response to phosphate starvation	Here we report on the characterization of rice osa-miR827 and its two target genes, OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2, which encode SPX-MFS proteins predicted to be implicated in phosphate (Pi) sensing or transport
