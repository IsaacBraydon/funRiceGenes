nph12499.pdf	Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa)	2014	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Phosphorus (P) is crucial nutrient element for crop growth and development. However, the network pathway regulating homeostasis of phosphate (Pi) in crops has many molecular breeding unknowns. Here, we report that an auxin response factor, OsARF12, functions in Pi homeostasis. Measurement of element content, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis and acid phosphatases (APases) activity assay showed that the osarf12 mutant and osarf12/25 double mutant with P-intoxicated phenotypes had higher P concentrations, up-regulation of the Pi transporter encoding genes and increased APase activity under Pi-sufficient/-deficient (+Pi/-Pi, 0.32/0 mM NaH2 PO4) conditions. Transcript analysis revealed that Pi-responsive genes--Phosphate starvation (OsIPS)1 and OsIPS2, SYG1/Pho81/XPR1(OsSPX1), Sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2 (OsSQD2), R2R3 MYB transcription factor (OsMYB2P-1) and Transport Inhibitor Response1 (OsTIR1)--were more abundant in the osarf12 and osarf12/25 mutants under +Pi/-Pi conditions. Knockout of OsARF12 also influenced the transcript abundances of the OsPHR2 gene and its downstream components, such as OsMiR399j, OsPHO2, OsMiR827, OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2. Results from -Pi/1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) treatments, and auxin reporter DR5::GUS staining suggest that root system alteration and Pi-induced auxin response were at least partially controlled by OsARF12. These findings enrich our understanding of the biological functions of OsARF12, which also acts in regulating Pi homeostasis.
Plant Cell Physiol-2010-Lin-2119-31.pdf	Complex regulation of two target genes encoding SPX-MFS proteins by rice miR827 in response to phosphate starvation	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan.	Here we report on the characterization of rice osa-miR827 and its two target genes, OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2, which encode SPX-MFS proteins predicted to be implicated in phosphate (Pi) sensing or transport. We first show by Northern blot analysis that osa-miR827 is strongly induced by Pi starvation in both shoots and roots. Hybridization of osa-miR827 in situ confirms its strong induction by Pi starvation, with signals concentrated in mesophyll, epidermis and ground tissues of roots. In parallel, we analyzed the responses of the two OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2 gene targets to Pi starvation. OsSPX-MFS1 mRNA is mainly expressed in shoots under sufficient Pi supply while its expression is reduced on Pi starvation, revealing a direct relationship between induction of osa-miR827 and down-regulation of OsSPX-MFS1. In contrast, OsSPX-MFS2 responds in a diametrically opposed manner to Pi starvation. The accumulation of OsSPX-MFS2 mRNA is dramatically enhanced under Pi starvation, suggesting the involvement of complex regulation of osa-miR827 and its two target genes. We further produced transgenic rice lines overexpressing osa-miR827 and T-DNA knockout mutant lines in which the expression of osa-miR827 is abolished. Compared with wild-type controls, both target mRNAs exhibit similar changes, their expression being reduced and increased in overexpressing and knockout lines, respectively. This suggests that OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2 are both negatively regulated by osa-miR827 abundance although they respond differently to external Pi conditions. We propose that this is a complex mechanism comprising fine tuning of spatial or temporal regulation of both targets by osa-miR827.
