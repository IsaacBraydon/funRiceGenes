NA	Multi-omics approach reveals the contribution of OsSEH1 to rice cold tolerance.	2023	Front Plant Sci	Rice Research Institute/Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetic Improvement and High Quality and Efficiency Production of Northeast Japonica Rice in China, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China.	As low environmental temperature adversely affects the growth, development and geographical distribution, plants have evolved multiple mechanisms involving changing physiological and metabolic processes to adapt to cold stress. In this study, we revealed that nucleoporin-coding gene OsSEH1 was a positive regulator of cold stress in rice. Physiological assays showed that the activity of antioxidant enzymes showed a significant difference between osseh1 knock-out lines and wild type under cold stress. Metabolome analysis revealed that the contents of large-scale flavonoids serving as ROS scavengers were lower in osseh1 mutants compared with wild type under cold stress. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the DEGs between osseh1 knock-out lines and wild type plants were enriched in defense response, regulation of hormone levels and oxidation-reduction process. Integration of transcriptomic and metabolic profiling revealed that OsSEH1 plays a role in the oxidation-reduction process by coordinately regulating genes expression and metabolite accumulation involved in phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. In addition, Exogenous ABA application assays indicated that osseh1 lines had hypersensitive phenotypes compared with wild type plants, suggesting that OsSEH1 may mediate cold tolerance by regulating ABA levels.
NA	Natural variation in OsSEC13 HOMOLOG 1 modulates redox homeostasis to confer cold tolerance in rice.	2023	Plant Physiol	Rice Research Institute/Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetic Improvement and High Quality and Efficiency Production of Northeast Japonica Rice in China, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China, 110866.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a cold-sensitive species that often faces cold stress, which adversely affects yield productivity and quality. However, the genetic basis for low-temperature adaptation in rice remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that two functional polymorphisms in Oryza sativa SEC13 Homolog 1 (OsSEH1), encoding a WD40-repeat nucleoporin, between the two subspecies Oryza sativa japonica and Oryza sativa indica rice may have facilitated cold adaptation in japonica rice. We show that OsSEH1 of the japonica variety expressed in OsSEH1MSD plants (transgenic line overexpressing the OsSEH1 allele from Mangshuidao [MSD], cold-tolerant landrace) has a higher affinity for metallothionein 2b (OsMT2b) than that of OsSEH1 of indica. This high affinity of OsSEH1MSD for OsMT2b results in inhibition of OsMT2b degradation, with decreased accumulation of reactive oxygen species and increased cold tolerance. Transcriptome analysis indicates that OsSEH1 positively regulates the expression of the genes encoding dehydration-responsive element-binding transcription factors, i.e., OsDREB1 genes, and induces the expression of multiple cold-regulated genes to enhance cold tolerance. Our findings highlight a breeding resource for improving cold tolerance in rice.
