OsMT2b	OsSEH1	Natural variation in OsSEC13 HOMOLOG 1 modulates redox homeostasis to confer cold tolerance in rice.	 We show that OsSEH1 of the japonica variety expressed in OsSEH1MSD plants (transgenic line overexpressing the OsSEH1 allele from Mangshuidao [MSD], cold-tolerant landrace) has a higher affinity for metallothionein 2b (OsMT2b) than that of OsSEH1 of indica
