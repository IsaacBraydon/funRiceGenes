Asymmetric cell division is one of the most important mechanisms in the diversification of cell function and fate. In Arabidopsis, SCARECROW (SCR) is essential for the asymmetric division of the cortex/endodermis progenitor cell in the root. To learn more about how SCR is involved in asymmetric division, we analyzed the rice SCR (OsSCR) expression. In the root tip, OsSCR expression was observed in the endodermal cell layer and downregulated in the daughter cortex cell after asymmetric division, just as with Arabidopsis SCR. In leaf primordia, expression of OsSCR was observed in stomatal and ligule formation. In stomatal development, OsSCR was specifically expressed in the stomatal cell files before formation of guard mother cells (GMCs), and then, its expression was localized in GMCs, when the first asymmetric division occurred to generate the GMCs. Before the second asymmetric division of subsidiary mother cells (SMCs), localized OsSCR expression was observed in SMCs in the area close to the GMCs. Before these asymmetric divisions, the localization of OsSCR mRNA in GMC-forming cells and SMCs was observed in the area of the daughter GMC and subsidiary cells. OsSCR expression was also observed in the initiation area of ligule formation, and its downregulation occurred in the inner L2 cells generated by asymmetric division. Based on these observations, we proposed that OsSCR is involved not only in the asymmetric division of the cortex/endodermis progenitor cell but also during stomata and ligule formation by establishing the polarization of cytoplasm.

Here, we report the analysis of a rice tryptophan- (Trp-) and IAA-deficient mutant, tryptophan deficient dwarf1 (tdd1), which is embryonic lethal because of a failure to develop most organs during embryogenesis. Regenerated tdd1 plants showed pleiotropic phenotypes: dwarfing, narrow leaves, short roots and abnormal flowers. TDD1 encodes a protein homologous to anthranilate synthase beta-subunit, which catalyses the first step of the Trp biosynthesis pathway and functions upstream of Trp-dependent IAA biosynthesis. TDD1-uidA and DR5-uidA expression overlapped at many sites in WT plants but was lacking in tdd1, indicating that TDD1 is involved in auxin biosynthesis. Both Trp and IAA levels in flowers and embryos were much lower in tdd1 than in wild type (WT). Trp feeding completely rescued the mutant phenotypes and moderate expression of OsYUCCA1, which encodes a key enzyme in Trp-dependent IAA biosynthesis, also rescued plant height and root length, indicating that the abnormal phenotypes of tdd1 are caused predominantly by Trp and IAA deficiency. In tdd1 embryos, the expression patterns of OSH1 and OsSCR, which mark the presumptive apical region and the L2 layer, respectively, are identical to those in WT, suggesting a possibility either that different IAA levels are required for basic pattern formation than for organ formation or that an orthologous gene compensates for TDD1 deficiency during pattern formation.
