j.1365-313X.2003.01856.x.pdf	The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants	2003	The Plant Journal	BioScience Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	Asymmetric cell division is one of the most important mechanisms in the diversification of cell function and fate. In Arabidopsis, SCARECROW (SCR) is essential for the asymmetric division of the cortex/endodermis progenitor cell in the root. To learn more about how SCR is involved in asymmetric division, we analyzed the rice SCR (OsSCR) expression. In the root tip, OsSCR expression was observed in the endodermal cell layer and downregulated in the daughter cortex cell after asymmetric division, just as with Arabidopsis SCR. In leaf primordia, expression of OsSCR was observed in stomatal and ligule formation. In stomatal development, OsSCR was specifically expressed in the stomatal cell files before formation of guard mother cells (GMCs), and then, its expression was localized in GMCs, when the first asymmetric division occurred to generate the GMCs. Before the second asymmetric division of subsidiary mother cells (SMCs), localized OsSCR expression was observed in SMCs in the area close to the GMCs. Before these asymmetric divisions, the localization of OsSCR mRNA in GMC-forming cells and SMCs was observed in the area of the daughter GMC and subsidiary cells. OsSCR expression was also observed in the initiation area of ligule formation, and its downregulation occurred in the inner L2 cells generated by asymmetric division. Based on these observations, we proposed that OsSCR is involved not only in the asymmetric division of the cortex/endodermis progenitor cell but also during stomata and ligule formation by establishing the polarization of cytoplasm.
j.1365-313X.2009.03952.x.pdf	A rice tryptophan deficient dwarf mutant, tdd1, contains a reduced level of indole acetic acid and develops abnormal flowers and organless embryos	2009	Plant J	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. sazuka@agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp	Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) plays a critical role in many aspects of plant growth and development; however, complete pathways of biosynthesis, localization and many aspects of functions of IAA in rice remain unclear. Here, we report the analysis of a rice tryptophan- (Trp-) and IAA-deficient mutant, tryptophan deficient dwarf1 (tdd1), which is embryonic lethal because of a failure to develop most organs during embryogenesis. Regenerated tdd1 plants showed pleiotropic phenotypes: dwarfing, narrow leaves, short roots and abnormal flowers. TDD1 encodes a protein homologous to anthranilate synthase beta-subunit, which catalyses the first step of the Trp biosynthesis pathway and functions upstream of Trp-dependent IAA biosynthesis. TDD1-uidA and DR5-uidA expression overlapped at many sites in WT plants but was lacking in tdd1, indicating that TDD1 is involved in auxin biosynthesis. Both Trp and IAA levels in flowers and embryos were much lower in tdd1 than in wild type (WT). Trp feeding completely rescued the mutant phenotypes and moderate expression of OsYUCCA1, which encodes a key enzyme in Trp-dependent IAA biosynthesis, also rescued plant height and root length, indicating that the abnormal phenotypes of tdd1 are caused predominantly by Trp and IAA deficiency. In tdd1 embryos, the expression patterns of OSH1 and OsSCR, which mark the presumptive apical region and the L2 layer, respectively, are identical to those in WT, suggesting a possibility either that different IAA levels are required for basic pattern formation than for organ formation or that an orthologous gene compensates for TDD1 deficiency during pattern formation.
NA	Multiple transcriptional factors control stomata development in rice.	2019	New Phytol	MOE Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, China.	The grass stomata can balance the gas exchange and evaporation effectively in rapidly changing environment via their unique anatomical features. Although the key components of stomatal development in Arabidopsis have been largely elucidated during the past decade, the molecular mechanisms that govern stomatal development in grasses are poorly understood. Via the genome editing system and T-DNA insertion lines, the key transcriptional factors (TFs) regulating stomatal development in rice (Oryza sativa) were knocked out. A combination of genetic and biochemical assays subsequently revealed the functions of these TFs. OsSPCH/OsICE is essential for the initiation of stomatal lineage. OsMUTE/OsICE determines meristemoid to guard mother cell (GMC) transition. OsFAMA/OsICE influences subsidiary mother cell asymmetric division and mature stoma differentiation. OsFLP regulates the orientation of GMC symmetric division. More importantly, we found that OsSCR/OsSHR controls the initiation of stomatal lineage cells and the formation of subsidiary cells, and the transcription of OsSCR is activated by OsSPCH and OsMUTE. This study characterized the functions of master regulatory TFs that control each stomatal developmental stage in rice. Our findings are helpful to elucidate how various species reprogramme the molecular mechanisms to generate different stomatal types during evolution. This article is protected by copyright.

NA	RSD1 Is Essential for Stomatal Patterning and Files in Rice	2020	Front Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China.	Stomatal density is an important factor that determines the efficiency of plant gas exchange and water transpiration. Through forward genetics, we screened a mutant rice stomata developmental defect 1 (rsd1-1) with decreased stomatal density and clustered stomata in rice (Oryza sativa). After the first asymmetric division, some of the larger sister cells undergo an extra asymmetric division to produce a small cell neighboring guard mother cell. Some of these small cells develop into stomata, which leads to stomatal clustering, and the rest arrested or developed into pavement cell. After map-based cloning, we found the protein encoded by this gene containing DUF630 and DUF632 domains. Evolutionary analysis showed that the DUF630/632 gene family differentiated earlier in land plants. It was found that the deletion of RSD1 would lead to the disorder of gene expression regarding stomatal development, especially the expression of stomatal density and distribution 1 (OsSDD1). Through the construction of OsSDD1 deletion mutants by CRISPR-Cas9, we found that, similar to rsd1 mutants, the ossdd1 mutants have clustered stomata and extra small cells adjacent to the stomata. OsSDD1 and RSD1 are both required for inhibiting ectopic asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) and clustered stomata. By dehydration stress assay, the decreased stomatal density of rsd1 mutants enhanced their dehydration avoidance. This study characterized the functions of RSD1 and OsSDD1 in rice stomatal development. Our findings will be helpful in developing drought-resistant crops through controlling the stomatal density.
