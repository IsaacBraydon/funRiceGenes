Huang-2007-Down-regulation of a.pdf	Down-regulation of a SILENT INFORMATION REGULATOR2-related histone deacetylase gene, OsSRT1, induces DNA fragmentation and cell death in rice	2007	Plant Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	The SILENT INFORMATION REGULATOR2 (SIR2) family proteins are NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylases. Sir2 is involved in chromatin silencing at the mating-type loci, rDNA, and telomeres in yeast and is associated with lifespan extension in yeast, worms, and flies, but also in a broader range of additional functions. In this work, we investigated the role of OsSRT1, one of the two SIR2-related genes found in rice (Oryza sativa). We show that OsSRT1 is a widely expressed nuclear protein with higher levels in rapidly dividing tissues. OsSRT1 RNA interference induced an increase of histone H3K9 (lysine-9 of H3) acetylation and a decrease of H3K9 dimethylation, leading to H(2)O(2) production, DNA fragmentation, cell death, and lesions mimicking plant hypersensitive responses during incompatible interactions with pathogens, whereas overexpression of OsSRT1 enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress. Transcript microarray analysis revealed that the transcription of many transposons and retrotransposons in addition to genes related to hypersensitive response and/or programmed cell death was activated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that OsSRT1 down-regulation induced histone H3K9 acetylation on the transposable elements and some of the hypersensitive response-related genes, suggesting that these genes may be among the primary targets of deacetylation regulated by OsSRT1. Our data together suggest that the rice SIR2-like gene is required for safeguard against genome instability and cell damage to ensure plant cell growth, but likely implicates different molecular mechanisms than yeast and animal homologs.
journal.pone.0066807.pdf	The rice NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase OsSRT1 targets preferentially to stress- and metabolism-related genes and transposable elements	2013	PLoS One	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	Histone acetylation/deacetylation is an important chromatin modification for epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Silent information regulation2 (Sir2)-related sirtuins are nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent histone deacetylases (HDAC). The mammalian sirtuin family comprises 7 members (SIRT1-7) that act in different cellular compartments to regulate metabolism and aging. The rice genome contains only two Sir2-related genes: OsSRT1 (or SRT701) and OsSRT2 (orSRT702). OsSRT1 is closely related to the mammalian SIRT6, while OsSRT2 is homologous to SIRT4. Previous work has shown that OsSRT1 is required for the safeguard against genome instability and cell damage in rice plant. In this work we investigated the role of OsSRT1 on genome-wide acetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac) and studied the genome-wide binding targets of OsSRT1. The study reveals that OsSRT1 binds to loci with relatively low levels of H3K9ac and directly regulates H3K9ac and expression of many genes that are related to stress and metabolism, indicating that OsSRT1 is an important site-specific histone deacetylase for gene regulation in rice. In addition, OsSRT1 is found to also target to several families of transposable elements, suggesting that OsSRT1 is directly involved in transposable element repression.
NA	OsSRT1 is involved in rice seed development through regulation of starch metabolism gene expression	2016	Plant Science	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China	OsSRT1 is a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase, closely related to the human SIRT6 that plays key roles in genome stability and metabolic homeostasis. In this work, we investigated the role of OsSRT1 in rice seed development. Down-regulation of OsSRT1 induced higher expression of Rice Starch Regulator1 (RSR1) and amylases genes in developing seeds, which resulted in a decrease of starch synthesis and an increase of starch degradation, leading to abnormal seed development. ChIP assay showed that OsSRT1 was required to reduce histone H3K9 acetylation on starch metabolism genes and transposons in developing seeds. In addition, OsSRT1 was detected to directly bind to starch metabolism genes such as OsAmy3B, OsAmy3E, OsBmy4, and OsBmy9. Our results suggested that OsSRT1-mediated histone deacetylation is involved in starch accumulation and transposon repression to regulate normal seed development.
