OsSRT1	OsSRT1 is involved in rice seed development through regulation of starch metabolism gene expression |  Down-regulation of OsSRT1 induced higher expression of Rice Starch Regulator1 (RSR1) and amylases genes in developing seeds, which resulted in a decrease of starch synthesis and an increase of starch degradation, leading to abnormal seed development
OsSRT1	 In this work, we show that the rice nuclear sirtuin OsSRT1 not only functions as an epigenetic regulator to repress glycolytic genes expression and glycolysis in seedlings, but also inhibits transcriptional activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase (GAPDH) that is enriched on glycolytic genes promoters and stimulates their expression
