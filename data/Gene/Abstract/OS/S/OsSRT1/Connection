OsSRT1	RSR1|qHD5	OsSRT1 is involved in rice seed development through regulation of starch metabolism gene expression	Down-regulation of OsSRT1 induced higher expression of Rice Starch Regulator1 (RSR1) and amylases genes in developing seeds, which resulted in a decrease of starch synthesis and an increase of starch degradation, leading to abnormal seed development
OsGAPDH1	OsSRT1	Rice NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase OsSRT1 represses glycolysis and regulates the moonlighting function of GAPDH as a transcriptional activator of glycolytic genes	OsSRT1-dependent lysine deacetylation of OsGAPDH1 represses transcriptional activity of the protein.
