J. Exp. Bot.-2013-Tian-jxb-ert128.pdf	Small GTPase Sar1 is crucial for proglutelin and alpha-globulin export from the endoplasmic reticulum in rice endosperm	2013	J Exp Bot	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	Rice seed storage proteins glutelin and alpha-globulin are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and deposited in protein storage vacuoles (PSVs). Sar1, a small GTPase, acts as a molecular switch to regulate the assembly of coat protein complex II, which exports secretory protein from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. To reveal the route by which glutelin and alpha-globulin exit the ER, four putative Sar1 genes (OsSar1a/b/c/d) were cloned from rice, and transgenic rice were generated with Sar1 overexpressed or suppressed by RNA interference (RNAi) specifically in the endosperm under the control of the rice glutelin promoter. Overexpression or suppression of any OsSar1 did not alter the phenotype. However, simultaneous knockdown of OsSar1a/b/c resulted in floury and shrunken seeds, with an increased level of glutelin precursor and decreased level of the mature alpha- and beta-subunit. OsSar1abc RNAi endosperm generated numerous, spherical, novel protein bodies with highly electron-dense matrixes containing both glutelin and alpha-globulin. Notably, the novel protein bodies were surrounded by ribosomes, showing that they were derived from the ER. Some of the ER-derived dense protein bodies were attached to a blebbing structure containing prolamin. These results indicated that OsSar1a/b/c play a crucial role in storage proteins exiting from the ER, with functional redundancy in rice endosperm, and glutelin and alpha-globulin transported together from the ER to the Golgi apparatus by a pathway mediated by coat protein complex II.
NA	A deleterious Sar1c variant in rice inhibits export of seed storage proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum.	2022	Plant Mol Biol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, People&#x27;s Republic of China.	We identified a dosage-dependent dominant negative form of Sar1c, which confirms the essential role of COPII system in mediating ER export of storage proteins in rice endosperm. Higher plants accumlate large amounts of seed storage proteins (SSPs). However, mechanisms underlying SSP trafficking are largely unknown, especially the ER-Golgi anterograde process. Here, we showed that a rice glutelin precursor accumulation13 (gpa13) mutant exhibited floury endosperm and overaccumulated glutelin precursors, which phenocopied the reported RNAi-Sar1abc line. Molecular cloning revealed that the gpa13 allele encodes a mutated Sar1c (mSar1c) with a deletion of two conserved amino acids Pro134 and Try135. Knockdown or knockout of Sar1c alone caused no obvious phenotype, while overexpression of mSar1c resulted in seedling lethality similar to the gpa13 mutant. Transient expression experiment in tobacco combined with subcellular fractionation experiment in gpa13 demonstrated that the expression of mSar1c affects the subcellular distribution of all Sar1 isoforms and Sec23c. In addition, mSar1c failed to interact with COPII component Sec23. Conversely, mSar1c competed with Sar1a/b/d to interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sec12. Together, we identified a dosage-dependent dominant negative form of Sar1c, which confirms the essential role of COPII system in mediating ER export of storage proteins in rice endosperm.
