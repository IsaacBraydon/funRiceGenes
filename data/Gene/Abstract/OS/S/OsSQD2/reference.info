Chen-2011-OsPHF1 regulates the.pdf	OsPHF1 regulates the plasma membrane localization of low- and high-affinity inorganic phosphate transporters and determines inorganic phosphate uptake and translocation in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, People's Republic of China.	PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 (PHF1) is known to regulate the plasma membrane localization of PHT1;1, a high-affinity inorganic phosphate (Pi) transporter in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). OsPHF1, a rice (Oryza sativa) gene homologous to AtPHF1, was isolated and found to regulate the localization of both low- and high-affinity Pi transporters to the plasma membrane. Three OsPHF1 allelic mutants carrying one-point mutations at the fifth WD-repeat motif and two at the transmembrane helix, respectively, showed arsenate resistance and severely reduced Pi accumulation. The data indicate that mutation of OsPHF1 results in the endoplasmic reticulum retention of the low-affinity Pi transporter OsPT2 and high-affinity Pi transporter OsPT8. Mutation of OsPHF1 also reduced Pi accumulation in plants exhibiting excessive shoot Pi accumulation due to the overexpression of OsPHR2. However, the transcript level of OsPHF1 itself is not controlled by OsPHR2. Overexpression of OsPHF1 increased Pi accumulation in both roots and shoots in a solution culture with Pi-supplied condition. These results indicate that the role of OsPHF1 is unique in the localization of both low- and high-affinity Pi transporters on the plasma membrane in rice and determines Pi uptake and translocation in rice. The similar function of PHF1 required to facilitate PHT1 transit through the endoplasmic reticulum between Arabidopsis and rice provides an example of expectations from what one would deduce from sequence comparisons to extend knowledge from Arabidopsis to crops.
j.1365-313X.2008.03734.x.pdf	Involvement of OsSPX1 in phosphate homeostasis in rice	2009	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Arabidopsis thaliana SPX (SYG/PHO81/XPR1) domain genes have recently been shown to be involved in the phosphate (Pi) signaling pathway. We show here that a rice (Oryza sativa) SPX gene, OsSPX1, is specifically induced by Pi starvation in roots. Suppression of OsSPX1 by RNA interference resulted in severe signs of toxicity caused by the over-accumulation of Pi, similar to that found in OsPHR2 (phosphate starvation response transcription factor 2) overexpressors and pho2 (phosphate-responsive mutant 2). Quantitative RT-PCR showed that expression of OsSPX1 was strongly induced in OsPHR2 overexpression and pho2 mutant plants, indicating that OsSPX1 occurs downstream of OsPHR2 and PHO2. The expression of 10 genes associated with the phosphate-starvation signal pathways was analyzed. Expression of OsPT2 (phosphate transporter 2) and OsPT8 was significantly induced in OsSPX1-RNAi (OsSPX1-Ri) plants, suggesting that over-accumulation of Pi in OsSPX1-Ri plants results from an increase in Pi transport. In contrast, overexpression of OsSPX1 suppressed the induction of expression by Pi starvation of all 10 phosphate starvation-induced genes tested: IPS1 (induced by phosphate starvation 1), IPS2, OsPAP10 (purple acid phosphatase 10), OsSQD2 (sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2), miR399d and miR399j (microRNA 399), OsPT2, OsPT3, OsPT6 and OsPT8. This suggests that OsSPX1 acts via a negative feedback loop to optimize growth under phosphate-limited conditions.
NA	The Sulfoquinovosyltransferase-like Enzyme SQD2.2 is Involved in Flavonoid Glycosylation, Regulating Sugar Metabolism and Seed Setting in Rice.	2017	Sci Rep	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Seed setting is an important trait that contributes to seed yield and relies greatly on starch accumulation. In this study, a sulfoquinovosyl transferase-like protein, designated as SQD2.2 involved in seed setting and flavonoid accumulation, was identified and characterized in rice. Rice SQD2.2 is localized to the cytoplasm, and the SQD2.2 transcript was highest in leaves. Rice SQD2.2-overexpressing (OE) plants exhibited a decreased seed setting rate and diminished tiller number simultaneously with an increased glycosidic flavonoid level compared with wild-type (WT) plants. SQD2.2 catalyzes the glycosylation of apigenin to produce apigenin 7-O-glucoside using uridine diphosphate-glucose (UDPG) as a sugar donor, but it failed to compensate for sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) synthesis in the Arabidopsis sqd2 mutant. Furthermore, apigenin 7-O-glucoside inhibited starch synthase (SS) activity in a concentration-dependent manner, and SQD2.2-OE plants exhibited reduced SS activity accompanied by a significant reduction in starch levels and an elevation in soluble sugar levels relative to WT plants. Both adenosine diphosphate-glucose (ADPG) and UDPG levels in SQD2.2-OE plants were notably lower than those in WT plants. Taken together, rice SQD2.2 exhibits a novel role in flavonoid synthesis and plays an important role in mediating sugar allocation between primary and secondary metabolism in rice.
