The developmental transition from vegetative to reproductive phase (i.e., flowering) is the critical event in plant's life cycle, which is regulated by exogenous and endogenous signals to ensure it in a timely manner (He and Li, 2018). Rice (Oryza sativa) is classified as a facultative short-day plant (Tsuji et al., 2011). In rice, Hd1 (Heading date 1) is controlled by photoperiod, encodes a zinc finger protein, and promotes floral transition under SDs by up regulating Hd3a (Heading date 3a) expression; while under LDs, it strongly represses Hd3a expression to restrain floral transition (Sun et al., 2014).

Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant. In addition to serving as a model plant for molecular genetic studies of monocots, rice is a staple crop for about half of the world population. Heading date is a critical agronomic trait, and many genes controlling heading date have been cloned during the last two decades. The mechanism of flowering in rice from recognition of day length by leaves to floral activation in the shoot apical meristem has been extensively studied. In this review, we summarize current progress on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice with emphasis on post-translational modifications of key regulators, including Heading Date 1 (Hd1), Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Grain Number, Plant Height, and Heading Date7 (Ghd7). The contribution of heading date genes to heterosis and the expansion of rice cultivation areas from low-latitude to high-latitude regions are also discussed. To overcome limitations of diverse genetic backgrounds used in heading date studies and to gain a clearer understanding of flowering in rice, we propose a systematic collection of genetic resources in a common genetic background. Strategies in breeding adapted cultivars by rational design are also discussed.
