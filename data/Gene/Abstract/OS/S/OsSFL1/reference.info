NA	Rice Homolog of Sin3-Associated Polypeptide 30, OsSFL1, Mediates Histone Deacetylation to Regulate Flowering Time during Short Days.	2019	Plant Biotechnol J	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, Beijing, 100081, China.	The developmental transition from vegetative to reproductive phase (i.e., flowering) is the critical event in plant's life cycle, which is regulated by exogenous and endogenous signals to ensure it in a timely manner (He and Li, 2018). Rice (Oryza sativa) is classified as a facultative short-day plant (Tsuji et al., 2011). In rice, Hd1 (Heading date 1) is controlled by photoperiod, encodes a zinc finger protein, and promotes floral transition under SDs by up regulating Hd3a (Heading date 3a) expression; while under LDs, it strongly represses Hd3a expression to restrain floral transition (Sun et al., 2014).
