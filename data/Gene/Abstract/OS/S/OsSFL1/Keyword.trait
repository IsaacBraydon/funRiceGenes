OsSFL1	flowering time	Rice homolog of Sin3-associated polypeptide 30, OsSFL1, mediates histone deacetylation to regulate flowering time during short days	Consistently, we also verified that ossfl1©\T line delayed flowering time under SDs (about 17 days) compared with that of wild©\type DJ plants (Figure 1d), suggesting that OsSFL1 is an important player to regulate flowering time in rice.
