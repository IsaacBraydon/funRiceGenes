OsSWC4	pollen	Chromatin remodeling factors OsYAF9 and OsSWC4 interact to promote internode elongation in rice.	 Loss of OsSWC4 function exhibited defects in pollen germination and failure to generate seeds, whereas knockdown of OsSWC4 resulted in reduced height and fewer tillers
OsSWC4	gibberellin	Chromatin remodeling factors OsYAF9 and OsSWC4 interact to promote internode elongation in rice.	 The reduced height caused by OsYAF9 mutation and OsSWC4 knockdown was due to shorter internodes and defects in cell elongation, and this phenotype was rescued with gibberellin (GA) treatment, suggesting that both OsYAF9 and OsSWC4 are involved in the GA biosynthesis pathway
