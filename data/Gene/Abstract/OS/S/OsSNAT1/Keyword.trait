OsSNAT1	melatonin	Cloning and characterization of the serotonin N-acetyltransferase-2 gene (SNAT2) in rice (Oryza sativa).	The OsSNAT1 and OsSNAT2 transcripts were similarly suppressed in rice leaves during the melatonin induction after cadmium treatment
OsSNAT1	cadmium	Cloning and characterization of the serotonin N-acetyltransferase-2 gene (SNAT2) in rice (Oryza sativa).	The OsSNAT1 and OsSNAT2 transcripts were similarly suppressed in rice leaves during the melatonin induction after cadmium treatment
OsSNAT1	seedlings	Overexpression of rice serotonin N-acetyltransferase1 in transgenic rice plants confers resistance to cadmium and senescence and increases grain yield.	In contrast to tomato, melatonin synthesis in rice seedlings was not induced by selenium and OsSNAT1 transgenic rice plants did not show tolerance to selenium
OsSNAT1	panicle	Overexpression of rice serotonin N-acetyltransferase1 in transgenic rice plants confers resistance to cadmium and senescence and increases grain yield.	T2 homozygous OsSNAT1 transgenic rice plants exhibited increased grain yield due to increased panicle number per plant under paddy field conditions
OsSNAT1	grain	Overexpression of rice serotonin N-acetyltransferase1 in transgenic rice plants confers resistance to cadmium and senescence and increases grain yield.	T2 homozygous OsSNAT1 transgenic rice plants exhibited increased grain yield due to increased panicle number per plant under paddy field conditions
OsSNAT1	tolerance	Overexpression of rice serotonin N-acetyltransferase1 in transgenic rice plants confers resistance to cadmium and senescence and increases grain yield.	In contrast to tomato, melatonin synthesis in rice seedlings was not induced by selenium and OsSNAT1 transgenic rice plants did not show tolerance to selenium
OsSNAT1	grain yield	Overexpression of rice serotonin N-acetyltransferase1 in transgenic rice plants confers resistance to cadmium and senescence and increases grain yield.	T2 homozygous OsSNAT1 transgenic rice plants exhibited increased grain yield due to increased panicle number per plant under paddy field conditions
OsSNAT1	yield	Overexpression of rice serotonin N-acetyltransferase1 in transgenic rice plants confers resistance to cadmium and senescence and increases grain yield.	T2 homozygous OsSNAT1 transgenic rice plants exhibited increased grain yield due to increased panicle number per plant under paddy field conditions
OsSNAT1	melatonin	Overexpression of rice serotonin N-acetyltransferase1 in transgenic rice plants confers resistance to cadmium and senescence and increases grain yield.
