NA	A negative regulator in response to salinity in rice: Oryza sativa Salt-, ABA- and Drought-induced RING finger protein 1 (OsSADR1).	2018	Plant Cell Physiol	Plant Genomics Lab, Department of Applied Plant Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 200-713, Republic of Korea.	RING (Really Interesting New Gene) finger proteins play crucial roles in abiotic stress responses in plants. We report the RING finger E3 ligase, an Oryza sativa salt, abscisic acid (ABA), and drought stress-induced RING finger protein 1 gene (OsSADR1). We demonstrated that although OsSAR1 possesses E3 ligase activity, a single amino acid substitution (OsSADR1C168A) in the RING domain exhibited no E3 ligase activity, suggesting that the activity of most E3s is specified by the RING domain. Additional assays substantiated that OsSADR1 interacts with three substrates-OsSNAC2, OsGRAS44, and OsPIRIN, and mediates their proteolysis via the 26S proteasome pathway. For OsSADR1, approximately 62% of the transient signals were in the cytosol and 38% in the nucleus. However, transiently expressed OsSADR1 was primarily expressed in the nucleus (70%) in 200<U+2009>mM salt-treated rice protoplasts. The two nucleus-localised proteins (OsSNAC2 and OsGRAS44) interacted with OsSADR1 in the cytosol and nucleus. Heterogeneous overexpression of OsSADR1 in Arabidopsis exhibited sensitive phenotypes for salt- and mannitol-responsive seed germination and seedling growth. With ABA, OsSADR1 overexpression in plants produced highly tolerant phenotypes, with morphological changes in root length and stomatal closure. The ABA-tolerant transgenic plants also showed hypersensitivity phenotypes under severe water deficit conditions. Taken together, OsSADR1 may act as a regulator in abiotic stress responses by modulating target protein levels.
