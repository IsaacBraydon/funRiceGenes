OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsSAE1	SALT AND ABA RESPONSE ERF1 improves seed germination and salt tolerance by repressing ABA signaling in rice.	 Here, we used genetic and biochemical analyses to uncover the role of an APETALA2-type transcription factor, SALT AND ABA RESPONSE ERF1 (OsSAE1), as a positive regulator of seed germination and salt tolerance in rice by repressing the expression of ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE5 (OsABI5)
OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsSAE1	SALT AND ABA RESPONSE ERF1 improves seed germination and salt tolerance by repressing ABA signaling in rice.	 In vivo and in vitro assays indicated that OsSAE1 binds directly to the promoter of OsABI5, a major downstream component of the ABA signaling pathway and acts as a major regulator of seed germination and stress response
