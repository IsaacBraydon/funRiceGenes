OsSAE1	 Here, we used genetic and biochemical analyses to uncover the role of an APETALA2-type transcription factor, SALT AND ABA RESPONSE ERF1 (OsSAE1), as a positive regulator of seed germination and salt tolerance in rice by repressing the expression of ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE5 (OsABI5) |  OsSAE1 overexpression lines exhibited the converse phenotype, with increased seed germination and salt tolerance	 OsSAE1 overexpression lines exhibited the converse phenotype, with increased seed germination and salt tolerance
