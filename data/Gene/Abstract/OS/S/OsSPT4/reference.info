NA	Transcription elongation factors OsSPT4 and OsSPT5 are essential for rice growth and development and act with APO2.	2023	Plant Cell Rep	College of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, People&#x27;s Republic of China.	The transcription elongation factor SPT4/SPT5 complex is essential for rice vegetative and reproductive growth and that OsSPT5-1, with its interactor APO2, is involved in multiple phytohormone pathways. The SPT4/SPT5 complex is a transcription elongation factor that regulates the processivity of transcription elongation. However, our understanding of the role of SPT4/SPT5 complex in developmental regulation remains limited. Here, we identified three SPT4/SPT5 genes (OsSPT4, OsSPT5-1, and OsSPT5-2) in rice, and investigated their roles in vegetative and reproductive growth. These genes are highly conserved with their orthologs in other species. OsSPT4 and OsSPT5-1 are widely expressed in various tissues. By contrast, OsSPT5-2 is expressed at a relatively low level, which could cause osspt5-2 null mutants have no phenotypes. Loss-of-function mutants of OsSPT4 and OsSPT5-1 could not be obtained; their heterozygotes showed severe reproductive growth defects. An incomplete mutant line (osspt5-1#12) displayed gibberellin-related dwarfed defects and a weak root system at an early vegetative phase, and a short life cycle in different planting environments. Furthermore, OsSPT5-1 interacts with the transcription factor ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2 (APO2) and plays a similar role in regulating the growth of rice shoots. RNA sequencing analysis verified that OsSPT5-1 is involved in multiple phytohormone pathways, including gibberellin, auxin, and cytokinin. Therefore, the SPT4/SPT5 complex is essential for both vegetative and reproductive growth in rice.
