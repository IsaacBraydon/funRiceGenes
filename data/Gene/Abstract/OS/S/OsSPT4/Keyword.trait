OsSPT4	growth	Transcription elongation factors OsSPT4 and OsSPT5 are essential for rice growth and development and act with APO2.	Transcription elongation factors OsSPT4 and OsSPT5 are essential for rice growth and development and act with APO2.
OsSPT4	growth	Transcription elongation factors OsSPT4 and OsSPT5 are essential for rice growth and development and act with APO2.	 Loss-of-function mutants of OsSPT4 and OsSPT5-1 could not be obtained; their heterozygotes showed severe reproductive growth defects
