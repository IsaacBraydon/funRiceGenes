OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	 Out of these genes, five OsMPKs (OsMPK1, OsMPK3, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, and OsMPK16) were found to exhibit upregulated expression only during incompatible interaction
OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	 A transient expression analysis in combination with mutant analysis in rice protoplasts revealed that bip130 is required for ABA-induced antioxidant defense in an OsMPK1-dependent manner
OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	 OsFER2 knock-out in wild-type rice HY did not induce ROS and ferric ion (Fe(3+)) accumulation, lipid peroxidation and hypersensitive response (HR) cell death, and also downregulated the defense-related genes OsPAL1, OsPR1-b, OsRbohB, OsNADP-ME2-3, OsMEK2 and OsMPK1, and vacuolar membrane transporter OsVIT2 expression
