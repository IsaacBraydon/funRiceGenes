Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays a central role in controlling a vast array of plant biochemical and physiological processes. It is regulated by a characteristic phosphorelay system in which a series of three kinases phosphorylate and activate each other. Over the past years, several plants MAPKs have been identified and characterized. Of these, rice OsSIPK (Salicylic acid (SA)-Induced Protein Kinase) and its orthologs in other plants are of particular interest. A large body of evidence demonstrates the involvement of SIPKs in fine-tuned regulation of the plant responses to ozone, wounding, SA, and jasmonic acid (JA). Interestingly, their function appears to be conserved across reference plants, such as rice, tobacco, and Arabidopsis. In this minireview, we discuss the recent progress on rice OsSIPK and its orthologs as a "central master switch" for mediating plant responses against ozone, wounding, and JA as examples.
10.1007-s00425-007-0672-2.pdf	Novel rice OsSIPK is a multiple stress responsive MAPK family member showing rhythmic expression at mRNA level	2007	Planta	Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Science, Sejong University, Gwangjin-Gu, Seoul, South Korea.	We report isolation and transcriptional profiling of rice (Oryza sativa L.) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), OsSIPK (salicylic acid-induced protein kinase). OsSIPK gene is located on chromosome 6 most probably existing as a single copy in the rice genome, and encodes 398 amino acid polypeptide having the MAPK family signature and phosphorylation activation motif TEY. Steady state mRNA analyses of OsSIPK showed weak constitutive expression in leaves of 2-week-old rice seedlings. A time course (30-120 min) experiment using a variety of elicitors and stresses revealed that the OsSIPK mRNA is strongly induced by jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), ethephon, abscisic acid, cycloheximide (CHX), JA/SA + CHX, cantharidin, okadaic acid, hydrogen peroxide, chitosan, sodium chloride, and cold stress (12 degrees C), but not with wounding by cut, gaseous pollutants ozone, and sulfur dioxide, high temperature, ultraviolet C irradiation, sucrose, and drought. Its transcription was also found to be tissue-specifically regulated, and followed a rhythmic dark induction in leaves. Finally, we showed that the OsSIPK protein is localized to the nucleus. From these results, OsSIPK can be implicated in diverse stimuli-responsive signaling cascades and transcription of certain genes.
j.1744-7909.2012.01135.x.pdf	The C2H2-type zinc finger protein ZFP182 is involved in abscisic acid-induced antioxidant defense in rice	2012	J Integr Plant Biol	College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	C(2) H(2) -type zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) are thought to play important roles in modulating the responses of plants to drought, salinity and oxidative stress. However, direct evidence is lacking for the involvement of these ZFPs in abscisic acid (ABA)-induced antioxidant defense in plants. In this study, the role of the rice (Oryza sativa L. sub. japonica cv. Nipponbare) C(2) H(2) -type ZFP ZFP182 in ABA-induced antioxidant defense and the relationship between ZFP182 and two rice MAPKs, OsMPK1 and OsMPK5 in ABA signaling were investigated. ABA treatment induced the increases in the expression of ZFP182, OsMPK1 and OsMPK5, and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in rice leaves. The transient gene expression analysis and the transient RNA interference (RNAi) analysis in protoplasts showed that ZFP182, OsMPK1 and OsMPK5 are involved in ABA-induced up-regulation in the activities of SOD and APX. Besides, OsMPK1 and OsMPK5 were shown to be required for the up-regulation in the expression of ZFP182 in ABA signaling, but ZFP182 did not mediate the ABA-induced up-regulation in the expression of OsMPK1 and OsMPK5. These results indicate that ZFP182 is required for ABA-induced antioxidant defense and the expression of ZFP182 is regulated by rice MAPKs in ABA signaling.
Kim-2012-The bHLH Rac Immunit.pdf	The bHLH Rac Immunity1 (RAI1) Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma, Japan.	The Rac/Rop GTPase OsRac1 plays an essential role in rice immunity. However, the regulatory genes acting downstream of OsRac1 are largely unknown. We focused on the RAI1 gene, which is up-regulated in suspension cells expressing a constitutively active form of OsRac1. RAI1 encodes a putative basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. A microarray analysis of cells transformed with an inducible RAI1 construct showed increased expression of PAL1 and OsWRKY19 genes after induction, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RAI1. This was confirmed using RAI1 T-DNA activation-tagged and RNA interference lines. The PAL1 and OsWRKY19 genes were also up-regulated by sphingolipid and chitin elicitors, and the RAI1 activation-tagged plants had increased resistance to a rice blast fungus. These results indicated that RAI1 is involved in defense responses in rice. RAI1 interacted with OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 proteins in vivo and in vitro. Also, RAI1 was phosphorylated by OsMAPK3/6 and OsMKK4-dd in vitro. Overexpression of OsMAPK6 and/or OsMAPK3 together with OsMKK4-dd increased PAL1 and OsWRKY19 expression in rice protoplasts. Therefore, the regulation of PAL1 and OsWRKY19 expression by RAI1 could be controlled via an OsMKK4-OsMAPK3/6 cascade. Co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that OsMAPK3 and OsRac1 occur in the same complex as OsMAPK6. Taken together, our results indicate that RAI1 could be regulated by OsRac1 through an OsMAPK3/6 cascade. In this study, we have identified RAI1 as the first transcription factor acting downstream of OsRac1. This work will help us to understand the immune system regulated by OsRac1 in rice and its orthologs in other plant species.
MPMI-19-0530.pdf	Molecular analysis of the rice MAP kinase gene family in relation to Magnaporthe grisea infection	2006	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Department of Plant Pathology, Program in Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701, USA.	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play a crucial role in plant growth and development as well as biotic and abiotic stress responses. In Arabidopsis, 20 MAPKs have been identified and divided into four major groups. In rice, a monocot model and economically important cereal crop, only five MAPKs were characterized, including three related to the host defense response. In this study, we have identified 17 members of the rice MAPK gene (OsMPK) family through an in silico search of rice genome databases. Based on the phylogenetic analysis and pairwise comparison of Arabidopsis and rice MAPKs, we propose that MAPKs can be divided into six groups. Interestingly, the rice genome contains many more MAPKs with the TDY phosphorylation site (11 members) than with the TEY motif (six members). In contrast, the Arabidopsis genome contains more MAPKs with the TEY motif (12 members) than with the TDY motif (eight members). Upon inoculation with the blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea), nine of 17 OsMPK genes were found to be induced at the mRNA level during either early, late, or both stages of infection. Four of the M. grisea-induced OsMPK genes were associated with host-cell death in the lesion-mimic rice mutant, and eight of them were differentially induced in response to defense signal molecules such as jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, abscisic acid, and ethylene. The genome-wide expression analysis suggests that about half of the rice MAPK genes are associated with pathogen infection and host defense response.
pce12154.pdf	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice	2014	Plant Cell Environ	College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	In rice, the Ca(2+) /calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) OsDMI3 has been shown to be required for abscisic acid (ABA)-induced antioxidant defence. However, it is not clear how OsDMI3 participates in this process in rice. In this study, the cross-talk between OsDMI3 and the major ABA-activated MAPK OsMPK1 in ABA-induced antioxidant defence was investigated. ABA treatment induced the expression of OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 and the activities of OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 in rice leaves. In the mutant of OsDMI3, the ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activity of OsMPK1 were substantially reduced. But in the mutant of OsMPK1, the ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activity of OsDMI3 were not affected. Pretreatments with MAPKK inhibitors also did not affect the ABA-induced activation of OsDMI3. Further, a transient expression analysis in combination with mutant analysis in rice protoplasts showed that OsMPK1 is required for OsDMI3-induced increases in the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the production of H2 O2 . Our data indicate that there exists a cross-talk between OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 in ABA signalling, in which OsDMI3 functions upstream of OsMPK1 to regulate the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the production of H2 O2 in rice.
NA	Involvement of the OsMKK4-OsMPK1 Cascade and its Downstream Transcription Factor OsWRKY53 in the Wounding Response in Rice	2014	Plant Pathol J	Department of Plant Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 500-757, Korea.	Plant has possessed diverse stress signals from outside and maintained its fitness. Out of such plant responses, it is well known that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade plays important role in wounding and pathogen attack in most dicot plants. However, little is understood about its role in wounding response for the economically important monocot rice plant. In this study, therefore, the involvement of MAPK was investigated to understand the wounding signaling pathway in rice. The OsMPK1 was rapidly activated by wounding within 10 min, and OsMPK1 was also activated by challenge of rice blast fungus. Further analysis revealed that OsMKK4, the upstream kinase of OsMPK1, phosphorylated OsMPK1 by wounding in vivo. Furthermore, OsMPK1 directly interacted with a rice defense-related transcription factor OsWRKY53. To understand a functional link between MAPK and its target transcription factor, we showed that OsMPK1 activated by the constitutively active mutant OsMKK4(DD) phosphorylated OsWRKY53 in vitro. Taken together, components involving in the wounding signaling pathway, OsMKK4-OsMPK1-OsWRKY53, can be important players in regulating crosstalk between abiotic stress and biotic stress.
NA	OsMAPK6, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, influences rice grain size and biomass production	2015	Plant J	National Centre for Plant Gene Research, State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, P. R. China.	Grain size is an important agronomic trait in determining grain yield. However, the molecular mechanisms that determine the final grain size is not well understood. Here, we report the functional analysis of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant, dwarf and small grains1 (dsg1), which displays pleiotropic phenotypes, including small grains, dwarfism and erect leaves. Cytological observations revealed that the small grain and dwarfism of dsg1 were mainly caused by the inhibition of cell proliferation. Map-based cloning revealed that DSG1 encoded a  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), OsMAPK6. OsMAPK6 mainly located in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and was ubiquitously distributed in various organs, predominately in spikelets and spikelet hulls, consistent with its role in grain  size and biomass production. As a functional kinase, OsMAPK6 interacts strongly with OsMKK4, indicating that OsMKK4 is likely to be the upstream MAPKK of OsMAPK6 in rice. In addition, hormone sensitivity tests indicated that the dsg1 mutant was less sensitive to brassinosteroids (BRs). The endogenous BR levels were reduced in dsg1, and the expression of several BR signaling pathway genes and feedback-inhibited genes were altered in the dsg1 mutant, with or without exogenous BRs, indicating that OsMAPK6 may contribute to influence BR homeostasis and signaling. Thus, OsMAPK6, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, plays a pivotal role in grain size, via cell proliferation, and BR signaling and homeostasis, in  rice.
NA	Control of grain size and weight by the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMAPK6 signaling pathway in rice.	2018	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Cell and Chromosome Engineering, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; CAS Centre for Excellence in Molecular Plant Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Grain size is one of the key agronomic traits that determine grain yield in crops. However, the mechanisms underlying grain size control in crops remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMAPK6 signaling pathway positively regulates grain size and weight in rice. Loss of OsMKKK10 function results in small and light grains, short panicles and semi-dwarf plants, while overexpression of constitutively active OsMKKK10 (CA-OsMKKK10) causes large and heavy grains, long panicles and tall plants in rice. OsMKKK10 interacts with and phosphorylates OsMKK4. We identify a gain-of-function mutant of OsMKK4 (large11-1D), which causes large and heavy grains. OsMKK4A227T encoded by the large11-1D allele has stronger kinase activity than OsMKK4. Overexpression of a constitutively active OsMKK4 (OsMKK4-DD) also forms large grains. Further biochemical and genetic analyses reveal that OsMKKK10, OsMKK4 and OsMAPK6 function in a common pathway to control grain size. Thus, our findings reveal an important genetic and molecular framework for the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMAPK6 cascade-mediated control of grain size and weight in rice.
