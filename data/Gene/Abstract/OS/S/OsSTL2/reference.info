Soil salinity is a major factor affecting rice growth and productivity worldwide especially at seedling stage. Many genes for salt tolerance have been identified and applied to rice breeding, but the actual mechanism of salt tolerance remains unclear. In this study, seedlings of 664 cultivated rice varieties from the 3000 Rice Genome Project (3K-RG) were cultivated by hydroponic culture with 0.9% salt solution for trait identification. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of salt tolerance was performed using different models of analysis. Twenty-one QTLs were identified and two candidate genes named OsSTL1 (Oryza sativa salt tolerance level 1) and OsSTL2 (Oryza sativa salt tolerance level 2) were confirmed using sequence analysis. Haplotype and sequence analysis revealed that gene OsSTL1 was a homolog of salt tolerance gene SRP1 (Stress associated RNA-binding protein 1) in Arabidopsis. The hap1 of OsSTL1 was identified as the superior haplotype and a non-synonymous SNP was most likely to be the functional site. We also determined that the level of salt tolerance was improved by combining haplotypes of different genes. Our study provides a foundation for molecular breeding and functional analysis of salt tolerance in rice seedlings.
