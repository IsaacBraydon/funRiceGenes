Plants respond to environmental stresses by altering gene expression, and several genes have been found to mediate stress-induced expression, but many additional factors are yet to be identified. OsNAP is a member of the NAC transcription factor family; it is localized in the nucleus, and shows transcriptional activator activity in yeast. Analysis of the OsNAP transcript levels in rice showed that this gene was significantly induced by ABA and abiotic stresses, including high salinity, drought and low temperature. Rice plants overexpressing OsNAP did not show growth retardation, but showed a significantly reduced rate of water loss, enhanced tolerance to high salinity, drought and low temperature at the vegetative stage, and improved yield under drought stress at the flowering stage. Microarray analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsNAP revealed that many stress-related genes were up-regulated, including OsPP2C06/OsABI2, OsPP2C09, OsPP2C68 and OsSalT, and some genes coding for stress-related transcription factors (OsDREB1A, OsMYB2, OsAP37 and OsAP59). Our data suggest that OsNAP functions as a transcriptional activator that plays a role in mediating abiotic stress responses in rice.

Type 2C protein phosphatase plays an important role in the signal transduction of stress response in plants. In this paper, we identified a novel stress-induced type 2C protein phosphatase gene OsSIPP2C1 from rice. OsSIPP2C1 contains a complete open reading frame of 1,074 bp, encoding a protein with 357 amino acids. OsSIPP2C1 expression was up-regulated by high salt, PEG6000 and exogenous ABA, and enhanced in the abl1 mutant under normal, salt, or drought condition. Interestingly, OsSIPP2C1 expression was increased during the early panicle development. Subcellular localization assay using rice protoplast cells indicated that OsSIPP2C1 was predominantly located in the nucleus. Together, it is suggested that a nuclear PP2C protein OsSIPP2C1 negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice.
