Vesicular trafficking plays critical roles in cell expansion in yeast and mammals, but information linking vesicular trafficking and cell expansion in plants is limited. Here, we isolated and characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, decreased plant height 1-1 (dph1-1), which exhibited a wide spectrum of developmental phenotypes, including reduced plant height and smaller panicles and grains. Cytological analysis revealed that limited cell expansion was responsible for the dph1-1 mutant phenotype compared to the wild-type. Map-based cloning revealed that DPH1 encodes a plant-specific protein, OsSCD2, which is homologous to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) STOMATAL CYTOKINESIS DEFECTIVE2 (SCD2). Subcellular localization revealed that OsSCD2 is associated with clathrin. Confocal microscopy showed that the dph1-1 mutant has defective endocytosis and post-Golgi trafficking. Biochemical and confocal data indicated that OsSCD2 physically interacts with OsSCD1 and that they are associated with intracellular structures that colocalize with microtubules. Furthermore, we found that cellulose synthesis was affected in the dph1-1 mutant, evidenced by reduced cellulose synthase gene accumulation at the transcript and protein levels, most likely resulting from an impaired localization pattern. Our results suggest that OsSCD2 is involved in clathrin-related vesicular trafficking with an important role in maintaining plant growth in rice.
