NA	Rice STOMATAL CYTOKINESIS DEFECTIVE2 regulates cell expansion by affecting vesicular trafficking in rice.	2022	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Vesicular trafficking plays critical roles in cell expansion in yeast and mammals, but information linking vesicular trafficking and cell expansion in plants is limited. Here, we isolated and characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, decreased plant height 1-1 (dph1-1), which exhibited a wide spectrum of developmental phenotypes, including reduced plant height and smaller panicles and grains. Cytological analysis revealed that limited cell expansion was responsible for the dph1-1 mutant phenotype compared to the wild-type. Map-based cloning revealed that DPH1 encodes a plant-specific protein, OsSCD2, which is homologous to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) STOMATAL CYTOKINESIS DEFECTIVE2 (SCD2). Subcellular localization revealed that OsSCD2 is associated with clathrin. Confocal microscopy showed that the dph1-1 mutant has defective endocytosis and post-Golgi trafficking. Biochemical and confocal data indicated that OsSCD2 physically interacts with OsSCD1 and that they are associated with intracellular structures that colocalize with microtubules. Furthermore, we found that cellulose synthesis was affected in the dph1-1 mutant, evidenced by reduced cellulose synthase gene accumulation at the transcript and protein levels, most likely resulting from an impaired localization pattern. Our results suggest that OsSCD2 is involved in clathrin-related vesicular trafficking with an important role in maintaining plant growth in rice.
NA	CEF3 is involved in membrane trafficking and essential for secondary cell wall biosynthesis and its mutation enhanced biomass enzymatic saccharification in rice.	2022	Biotechnol Biofuels Bioprod	Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, 230031, China.	BACKGROUND: As one of the most important staple food crops, rice produces large of agronomic biomass residues that contain lots of secondary cell walls (SCWs). Membrane trafficking plays key roles in SCWs biosynthesis, but information association membrane trafficking and SCWs formation in plants is limited. RESULTS: In this study, we report the function characterization of a rice mutant, culm easily fragile 3 (cef3), that exhibits growth retardation and fragile culm phenotype with significantly altered cell wall composition and reduced secondary wall thickness. Map-based cloning revealed that CEF3 encodes a homologous protein of Arabidopsis STOMATAL CYTOKINESIS DEFECTIVE2 (SCD2). The saccharification assays revealed that CEF3 mutation can improve biomass enzymatic saccharification. Expression pattern analysis indicated that CEF3 is ubiquitously expressed in many organs at different developmental stages. Subcellular localization revealed that CEF3 is a Golgi-localized protein. The FM4-64 uptake assay revealed CEF3 is involved in endocytosis. Furthermore, mutation of CEF3 not only affected cellulose synthesis-related genes expression, but also altered the abundance of cellulose synthase catalytic subunit 9 (OsCESA9) in the PM and in the endomembrane systems. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated that CEF3 participates in the membrane trafficking that is essential for normal cellulose and other polysaccharides biosynthesis of the secondary cell wall, thereby manipulation of CEF3 could alter cellulose content and enhance biomass enzymatic saccharification in rice plants. Therefore, the study of the function of CEF3 can provide a strategy for genetic modification of SCWs in bioenergy crops.
