OsSK2	panicle	Identification of three shikimate kinase genes in rice: characterization of their differential expression during panicle development and of the enzymatic activities of the encoded proteins	Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of OsSK1 and OsSK2 was induced in rice calli by treatment with the elicitor N-acetylchitoheptaose, and that expression of OsSK1 and OsSK3 was up-regulated specifically during the heading stage of panicle development
