BACKGROUND: It is well known that salt stress has different effects on old and young tissues. However, it remains largely unexplored whether old and young tissues have different regulatory mechanism during adaptation of plants to salt stress. The aim of this study was to investigate whether salt stress has different effects on the ion balance and nitrogen metabolism in the old and young leaves of rice, and to compare functions of both organs in rice salt tolerance. RESULTS: Rice protected young leaves from ion harm via the large accumulation of Na+ and Cl- in old leaves. The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 might contribute to accumulation of Na+ in old leaves under salt stress. In addition, lower expression of OsHKT1;5 and OsSOS1 in old leaves may decrease frequency of retrieving Na+ from old leaf cells. Under salt stress, old leaves showed higher concentration of NO3- content than young leaves. Up-regulation of OsNRT1;2, a gene coding nitrate transporter, might contribute to the accumulation of NO3- in the old leaves of salt stressed-rice. Salt stress clearly up-regulated the expression of OsGDH2 and OsGDH3 in old leaves, while strongly down-regulated expression of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves. CONCLUSIONS: The down-regulation of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves might be a harmful response to excesses of Na+ and Cl-. Under salt stress, rice might accumulate Na+ and Cl- to toxic levels in old leaves. This might influence photorespiration process, reduce NH4+ production from photorespiration, and immediately down-regulate the expression of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves of salt stressed rice. Excesses of Na+ and Cl- also might change the pathway of NH4+ assimilation in old leaves of salt stressed rice plants, weaken GOGAT/GS pathway and elevate GDH pathway.
21007784.pdf	Isolation and characterization of a new Na+/H+ antiporter gene OsNHA1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2006	DNA Seq	State key laboratory of crop genetics and germplasm enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	The full-length cDNA (3612 bp) of OsNHA1 was cloned by RT-PCR approach from rice (Oryza sativa L.), which encodes a putative plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter. Its deduced protein, OsNHA1, has 11 transmembrane domains and a significant similarity to a plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter AtNHA1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the OsNHA1 clusters with the plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporters from various organisms. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay revealed that the expression of OsNHA1 was up-regulated in both shoots and roots of rice seedlings under salt stress, whereas it was not induced in the rice seedlings treated by drought stress.

The salt tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa) correlates with the ability to exclude Na+ from the shoot and to maintain a low cellular Na+/K+ ratio. We have identified a rice plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger that, on the basis of genetic and biochemical criteria, is the functional homolog of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) salt overly sensitive 1 (SOS1) protein. The rice transporter, denoted by OsSOS1, demonstrated a capacity for Na+/H+ exchange in plasma membrane vesicles of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells and reduced their net cellular Na+ content. The Arabidopsis protein kinase complex SOS2/SOS3, which positively controls the activity of AtSOS1, phosphorylated OsSOS1 and stimulated its activity in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, OsSOS1 suppressed the salt sensitivity of a sos1-1 mutant of Arabidopsis. These results represent the first molecular and biochemical characterization of a Na+ efflux protein from monocots. Putative rice homologs of the Arabidopsis protein kinase SOS2 and its Ca2+-dependent activator SOS3 were identified also. OsCIPK24 and OsCBL4 acted coordinately to activate OsSOS1 in yeast cells and they could be exchanged with their Arabidopsis counterpart to form heterologous protein kinase modules that activated both OsSOS1 and AtSOS1 and suppressed the salt sensitivity of sos2 and sos3 mutants of Arabidopsis. These results demonstrate that the SOS salt tolerance pathway operates in cereals and evidences a high degree of structural conservation among the SOS proteins from dicots and monocots.
NA	Na+/K+ Balance and Transport Regulatory Mechanisms in Weedy and Cultivated Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Under Salt Stress.	2018	BMC Plant Biol	College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Salinization is a primary abiotic stress constraining global plant growth and production. Weedy rice, though highly homologous to cultivated rice, is more salt tolerant during seed germination and seedling growth; we hypothesize that this is owing to ionic homeostasis and changes in the expression of genes encoding ion transport regulators.The four different genotypes of weedy (JYGY-1 and JYFN-4) and cultivated (Nipponbare and 9311) rice have different salt-tolerance during seed germination and seedling vegetative growth under salt stress. In this study, Na+ and Ca2+content increased in weedy and cultivated rice genotypes under salt stress while K+ and Mg2+decreased; however, JYGY-1 had the lowest Na+/K+ ratio of assessed genotypes. Genes in the high-affinity K+ transporter (HKT) and tonoplast sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHX) families, and salt overly sensitive 1 (OsSOS1) have more than 98% homology in amino acid sequences between weedy and cultivated rice genotypes. Under salt stress, the HKT family members were differentially expressed in the roots and shoots of four different genotypes. However, the NHX family transcripts were markedly up-regulated in all genotypes, but there are significant differences between different genotypes. OsSOS1 was significantly up-regulated in roots, especially in JYGY-1genotype.The results showed that different genotypes had different germination and nutrient survival under salt stress, which was related to the difference of ion content and the difference of a series of ion transport gene expression. At the same time this study will provide new insight into the similarities and differences in ion homeostasis and gene regulatory mechanisms between weedy and cultivated rice under salt stress, which can aid in novel rice breeding and growth strategies.
NA	A Critical Role of Sodium Flux via the Plasma Membrane Na+/H+ Exchanger SOS1 in the Salt Tolerance of Rice.	2019	Plant Physiol	Instituto de Recursos Naturales y Agrobiologia (IRNAS), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient¨ªficas (CSIC) CITY: Sevilla Spain [ES].	Rice (Oryza sativa) stands among the world's most important crop species. Rice is salt-sensitive and the undue accumulation of sodium ions (Na+) in shoots has the strongest negative correlation with rice productivity under long-term salinity. The plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger protein SOS1 is the sole Na+ efflux transporter that has been genetically characterized to date. Here, the importance of SOS1-facilitated Na+ flux in the salt tolerance of rice was analyzed in a reverse-genetics approach. A sos1 loss-of-function mutant displayed exceptional salt sensitivity that was correlated with excessive Na+ intake and impaired Na+ loading into the xylem, thus indicating that SOS1 controls net root Na+ uptake and long-distance Na+ transport to shoots. The acute Na+ sensitivity of sos1 plants at low NaCl concentrations allowed analysis of the transcriptional response to sodicity stress without effects of the osmotic stress intrinsic to high-salinity treatments. In contrast to that in the wild type, sos1 mutant roots displayed preferential down-regulation of stress-related genes in response to salt treatment, despite the greater intensity of stress experienced by the mutant. These results suggest there is impaired stress detection or an inability to mount a comprehensive response to salinity in sos1. In summary, the plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger SOS1 plays a major role in the salt tolerance of rice by controlling Na+ homeostasis and possibly contributing to the sensing of sodicity stress.
NA	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase OsDMI3 positively regulates saline-alkaline tolerance in rice roots	2020	Plant Signal Behav	College of Life Sciences, National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Crop Physiology Ecology and Production Management, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University , Nanjing, China.	Soil saline-alkalization is a major environmental stress that impairs plant growth and crop productivity. Plant roots are the primary site for the perception of soil stresses; however, the regulation mechanism engaged in the saline-alkaline stress response in plant roots is not well understood. In this study, we identified how a rice Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, OsDMI3, confers saline-alkaline tolerance in rice root growth. We measured the OsDMI3 activity by an in-gel kinase assay, Na+ content by NaHCO3 treatment, and Na+ and H+ fluxes by noninvasive micro-test technology (NMT). Furthermore, a real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed to identify the genes upregulated in response to NaHCO3 treatment in rice roots. The results showed that NaHCO3 significantly increased OsDMI3 expression and activity in rice roots. This was consistent with the results of Na+ content and NMT that indicated OsDMI3 promoted root elongation under saline-alkaline stress by reducing root Na+ and H+ influx. Moreover, real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsDMI3 up-regulated the transcript levels of OsSOS1 and PM-H+-ATPase genes OsA3 and OsA8 in saline-alkaline stressed rice plants. Collectively, our results suggest that OsDMI3 could promote saline-alkaline tolerance in rice roots by modulating the Na+ and H+ influx. These findings provide an important genetic target for protection of growth in rice exposed to saline-alkaline stress.
NA	CC-type glutaredoxin, OsGrx_C7 plays a crucial role in enhancing protection against salt stress in rice	2021	J Biotechnol	Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Division, CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, India; Department of Botany, University of Lucknow, India.	Soil salinity is one of the critical issue worldwide that adversely affect soil fertility. Salt stress significantly limits crop yield and grain quality; therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a strategy to improve salt stress tolerance. In present study, we reported that rice glutaredoxin (OsGrx_C7) plays a positive response in salt induced stress. Gene expression analysis, silencing, and overexpression of OsGrx_C7 gene were used to discover the role of OsGrx_C7 in response to salt stress. Gene expression analysis suggested that OsGrx_C7 expression was induced under salt stress and ubiquitously expressed in rice including root and shoot. The silencing of osgrx_c7 gene leads to increased sensitivity to salt stress, indicating its importance in salt stress tolerance. A gain-of-function approach showed that OsGrx_C7 may act as an important determinant in salt stress, compared with WT, and revealed higher biomass accumulation, improved root and plant growth under salt stress. Under salt stress condition, OsGrx_C7 overexpressing rice plants showed lower level of lipid peroxidation and Na+/K+ ratio, while proline accumulation, soluble sugar content and GSH/GSSG ratio was higher compared to WT. Furthermore, expression analysis suggested that OsGrx_C7 acted as positive regulator of salt tolerance by reinforcing the expression of transporters (OsHKT2;1, OsHKT1;5 and OsSOS1) engaged in Na+ homeostasis in overexpressing plants. Overall our study revealed that OsGrx_C7 emerged as a key mediator in response to salt stress in rice and could be used for engineering tolerance against salt stress in rice and other crops.
