OsNHA1|OsSOS1	OsPEX11	OsPEX11, a Peroxisomal Biogenesis Factor 11, Contributes to Salt Stress Tolerance in Oryza sativa.	Furthermore, qPCR data suggested that OsPEX11 acted as a positive regulator of salt tolerance by reinforcing the expression of several well-known rice transporters (OsHKT2;1, OsHKT1;5, OsLti6a, OsLti6b, OsSOS1, OsNHX1, and OsAKT1) involved in Na(+)/K(+) homeostasis in transgenic plants under salinity
OsHAK1	OsNHA1|OsSOS1	Variation in the Abundance of OsHAK1 Transcript Underlies the Differential Salinity Tolerance of an indica and a japonica Rice Cultivar.	 At the transcriptome level, the over-expression of OsHAK1 stimulated a number of stress-responsive genes as well as four genes known to be involved in Na+ homeostasis and the salinity response (OsHKT1;5, OsSOS1, OsLti6a and OsLti6b)
OsC2DP	OsNHA1|OsSOS1	OsC2DP, a novel C2 domain-containing protein is required for salt tolerance in rice.	 Furthermore, the qRT-PCR and transcriptomic analysis showed that the expression level of some genes related to salt tolerance were indirectly regulated by OsC2DP, especially OsSOS1 and OsNHX4
OsA3	OsNHA1|OsSOS1	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase OsDMI3 positively regulates saline-alkaline tolerance in rice roots	 Moreover, real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsDMI3 up-regulated the transcript levels of OsSOS1 and PM-H+-ATPase genes OsA3 and OsA8 in saline-alkaline stressed rice plants

OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	OsNHA1|OsSOS1	CC-type glutaredoxin, OsGrx_C7 plays a crucial role in enhancing protection against salt stress in rice	 Furthermore, expression analysis suggested that OsGrx_C7 acted as positive regulator of salt tolerance by reinforcing the expression of transporters (OsHKT2;1, OsHKT1;5 and OsSOS1) engaged in Na+ homeostasis in overexpressing plants

OsbHLH96|OsbHLH044	OsNHA1|OsSOS1	Loss-of-function mutations of OsbHLH044 transcription factor lead to salinity sensitivity and a greater chalkiness in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 The expression levels of genes coding for starch (OsAGPL1, OsSSIIa, OsWx, and OsFLO2) and seed storage proteins (GluA1 and Globulin 1) were significantly decreased, indicating that they synthesize less store starch and proteins, resulting in grain chalkiness in the osbhlh044 (OsHKT1;3, OsHAK7, OsSOS1, OsSOS2, OsNHX2, and OsLEA3 but not OsHKT2;1), and starch-related genes (OsSSIIa, OsWx, and OsFLO2) by binding to the G-boxes of their promoters

Root ion concentrations indicated that OsABT overexpression lines could maintain lower Na(+) and higher K(+)/Na(+) ratios and upregulated expression of salt-related genes OsSOS1 and OsHAK5 compared with the wild-type (WT) Nipponbare plants
