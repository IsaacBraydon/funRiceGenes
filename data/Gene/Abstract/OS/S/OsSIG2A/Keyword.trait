OsSIG2A	leaf development	Differential Expression of Three Plastidial Sigma Factors,OsSIG1,OsSIG2A, andOsSIG2B, during Leaf Development in Rice	Gene expression analysis revealed that the OsSIG2A transcript is more abundant than the OsSIG2B transcript in all tissues tested and that both rice SIG2s are expressed from earlier stages of leaf development than that in the case of OsSIG1
OsSIG2A	leaf development	Differential Expression of Three Plastidial Sigma Factors,OsSIG1,OsSIG2A, andOsSIG2B, during Leaf Development in Rice	Differential Expression of Three Plastidial Sigma Factors,OsSIG1,OsSIG2A, andOsSIG2B, during Leaf Development in Rice
OsSIG2A	chloroplast	The virescent-2 mutation inhibits translation of plastid transcripts for the plastid genetic system at an early stage of chloroplast differentiation	Accumulation of transcripts of nuclear-encoded photosynthetic genes, such as cab and rbcS, was strongly suppressed in the mutant at later stages of chloroplast differentiation, whereas transcripts of genes for the plastid transcription apparatus, such as OsRpoTp and OsSIG2A, accumulated to abnormally high levels at these stages

OsSIG2A	chloroplast	OsSIG2A is required for chloroplast development in rice (Oryza sativa L.) at low temperature by regulating plastid genes expression.	OsSIG2A is required for chloroplast development in rice (Oryza sativa L.) at low temperature by regulating plastid genes expression.
OsSIG2A	chloroplast	OsSIG2A is required for chloroplast development in rice (Oryza sativa L.) at low temperature by regulating plastid genes expression.	 Here, we uncovered the essential role of OsSIG2A in rice chloroplast development at low temperatures by a newly reported thermo-sensitive chlorophyll deficient 12 (tcd12) mutant, which exhibited albino leaves with decreased chlorophyll content and malformed chloroplasts at seedling stage under low temperature
OsSIG2A	chloroplast	OsSIG2A is required for chloroplast development in rice (Oryza sativa L.) at low temperature by regulating plastid genes expression.	 Taken together, our findings indicate that OsSIG2A is required for early chloroplast differentiation under low temperatures by regulating plastid genes expression
