68_973.pdf	Differential Expression of Three Plastidial Sigma Factors,OsSIG1,OsSIG2A, andOsSIG2B, during Leaf Development in Rice	2014	Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry	National Food Research Institute	We isolated and characterized two rice nuclear genes, OsSIG2A and OsSIG2B, encoding the putative Ïƒ-factor of the plastid RNA polymerase. Deduced protein sequences predicted a plastid-localizing signal in the N-terminus and subsequent polypeptides similar to known SIG2 proteins. Gene expression analysis revealed that the OsSIG2A transcript is more abundant than the OsSIG2B transcript in all tissues tested and that both rice SIG2s are expressed from earlier stages of leaf development than that in the case of OsSIG1. These results indicate differential expression of SIG genes in leaf morphogenesis, suggesting the existence of tissue- and stage-specific functions of SIG proteins for transcriptional regulation of chloroplast genes in plant development.
Plant Cell Physiol-2004-Sugimoto-985-96.pdf	The virescent-2 mutation inhibits translation of plastid transcripts for the plastid genetic system at an early stage of chloroplast differentiation	2004	Plant and Cell Physiology	Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, 812-8581 Japan.	The rice virescent-2 mutant (v(2)) is temperature conditional and develops chlorotic, chloroplast-deficient leaves at the restrictive temperature. In the v(2) mutant, plastid-encoded proteins involved in photosynthesis and plastid transcriptional regulation were not detectable at any time during chloroplast differentiation. However, the plastid transcripts for these two classes of proteins behaved differently in the mutant, with those for the plastid transcription/translation apparatus accumulating to wild-type levels and those for photosynthetic apparatus being suppressed. Polysome analysis showed that translation of the plastid transcripts encoding the plastid transcription/translation apparatus was blocked at an early stage of chloroplast differentiation. Accumulation of transcripts of nuclear-encoded photosynthetic genes, such as cab and rbcS, was strongly suppressed in the mutant at later stages of chloroplast differentiation, whereas transcripts of genes for the plastid transcription apparatus, such as OsRpoTp and OsSIG2A, accumulated to abnormally high levels at these stages. These results suggest that activation of the plastid translation machinery at an early stage of chloroplast differentiation is important for triggering the transmission of information about plastid developmental state to the nucleus, which in turn is required for the induction of nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins at later stages of chloroplast differentiation.
