OsSRK1	gibberellin	OsSRK1, a lectin receptor-like kinase, controls plant height by mediating internode elongation in Oryza sativa L.	 Importantly, we further verified that OsSRK1 can directly interact with gibberellin receptor GID1
OsSRK1	gibberellin	OsSRK1, a lectin receptor-like kinase, controls plant height by mediating internode elongation in Oryza sativa L.	 Together, our results revealed that LecRLKs family member OsSRK1 positively regulated plant height by controlling internode elongation which maybe depended on OsSRK1-GID1 interaction mediated gibberellin signaling transduction
OsSRK1	height	OsSRK1, a lectin receptor-like kinase, controls plant height by mediating internode elongation in Oryza sativa L.	 Importantly, srk1-1 and srk1-2, two genome-edited mutants of OsSRK1 using CRISPR/Cas9 system, exhibited obviously a decreased plant height and shorter length of the first internode and second internode compared with those in WT
