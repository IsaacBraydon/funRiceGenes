GRID: grid.67293.39	LecRLKs (lectin receptor-like kinases) is a subfamily of RLKs (receptor like kinase) and takes part in mounds of biological processes in plant-environment interaction. However, the roles of LecRLKs in plant development are still elusive. Here, we showed that OsSRK1, belonging to LecRLK family in rice, had a relative higher expression in internode and stem in comparison with that in root and leaf. Importantly, srk1-1 and srk1-2, two genome-edited mutants of OsSRK1 using CRISPR/Cas9 system, exhibited obviously a decreased plant height and shorter length of the first internode and second internode compared with those in WT. Subsequently, histochemical sectioning showed that the stem diameter and the cell length in stem are significantly reduced in srk1-1 and srk1-2 compared with WT. Moreover, analyzing the expression of four gibberellin biosynthesis related genes showed that CPS, KAO, KS1, and GA3ox2 expression had similar levels between WT and mutants. Importantly, we further verified that OsSRK1 can directly interact with gibberellin receptor GID1. Together, our results revealed that LecRLKs family member OsSRK1 positively regulated plant height by controlling internode elongation which maybe depended on OsSRK1-GID1 interaction mediated gibberellin signaling transduction.
