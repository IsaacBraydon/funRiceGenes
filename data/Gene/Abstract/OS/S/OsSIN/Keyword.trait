OsSIN	stem	Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa	Our results suggest that OsSIN is a new member in the GA pathway regulating rice stem development
OsSIN	dwarf	Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa	Constitutive expression of OsSIN resulted in dwarfism and reduced number of inferior spikelets
OsSIN	spikelet	Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa	Constitutive expression of OsSIN resulted in dwarfism and reduced number of inferior spikelets
OsSIN	 ga 	Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa	The rice with OsSIN overexpression was less sensitive to GA than the wild type in terms of the second leaf sheath length
OsSIN	 ga 	Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa	Our results suggest that OsSIN is a new member in the GA pathway regulating rice stem development
OsSIN	sheath	Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa	The rice with OsSIN overexpression was less sensitive to GA than the wild type in terms of the second leaf sheath length
OsSIN	leaf	Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa	The rice with OsSIN overexpression was less sensitive to GA than the wild type in terms of the second leaf sheath length
