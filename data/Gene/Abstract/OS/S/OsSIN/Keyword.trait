OsSIN|ACE1	stem	Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa	Our results suggest that OsSIN is a new member in the GA pathway regulating rice stem development
OsSIN|ACE1	dwarf	Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa	Constitutive expression of OsSIN resulted in dwarfism and reduced number of inferior spikelets
OsSIN|ACE1	spikelet	Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa	Constitutive expression of OsSIN resulted in dwarfism and reduced number of inferior spikelets
OsSIN|ACE1	 ga 	Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa	The rice with OsSIN overexpression was less sensitive to GA than the wild type in terms of the second leaf sheath length
OsSIN|ACE1	 ga 	Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa	Our results suggest that OsSIN is a new member in the GA pathway regulating rice stem development
OsSIN|ACE1	sheath	Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa	The rice with OsSIN overexpression was less sensitive to GA than the wild type in terms of the second leaf sheath length
OsSIN|ACE1	leaf	Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa	The rice with OsSIN overexpression was less sensitive to GA than the wild type in terms of the second leaf sheath length
OsSIN|ACE1	growth	Antagonistic regulation of the gibberellic acid response during stem growth in rice 	 Furthermore, an analysis of genetic diversity suggests that mutations in ACE1 and DEC1 have historically contributed to the selection of shorter plants in domesticated populations of rice to increase their resistance to lodging, and of taller plants in wild species of rice for adaptation to growth in deep water
OsSIN|ACE1	resistance	Antagonistic regulation of the gibberellic acid response during stem growth in rice 	 Furthermore, an analysis of genetic diversity suggests that mutations in ACE1 and DEC1 have historically contributed to the selection of shorter plants in domesticated populations of rice to increase their resistance to lodging, and of taller plants in wild species of rice for adaptation to growth in deep water
OsSIN|ACE1	internode elongation	Antagonistic regulation of the gibberellic acid response during stem growth in rice 	 We also show that the mechanism of internode elongation that is mediated by ACE1 and DEC1 is conserved in the Gramineae family
