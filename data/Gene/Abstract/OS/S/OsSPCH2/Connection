OsBC1L1	OsSPCH2	OsBC1L1 and OsBC1L8 function in stomatal development in rice	 The expression of OsSPCH2 and OsFAMA, two genes key to stomatal development is both down-regulated in osbc1l1 osbc1l8
OsBC1L1	OsSPCH2	OsBC1L1 and OsBC1L8 function in stomatal development in rice	 In contrast, overexpressing OsBC1L1 suppresses only the expression of OsSPCH2
OsBC1L8	OsSPCH2	OsBC1L1 and OsBC1L8 function in stomatal development in rice	 The expression of OsSPCH2 and OsFAMA, two genes key to stomatal development is both down-regulated in osbc1l1 osbc1l8
