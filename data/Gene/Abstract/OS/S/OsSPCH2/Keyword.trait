OsSPCH2	stomatal	Multiple transcriptional factors control stomata development in rice	Another work indicated that OsSPCH2 controls the initiation of stomatal files in rice (Liu et al., 2009)
OsSPCH2	stomatal	Multiple transcriptional factors control stomata development in rice	These results indicated that OsSPCH1 and OsSPCH2 redundantly controlled stomatal initiation and meristemoid fate and that OsSPCH2 plays a major role in this process.
