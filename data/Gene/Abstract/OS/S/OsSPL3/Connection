OsMADS50|OsSOC1|DTH3	OsSPL3	OsSPL3, a SBP-Domain Protein, Regulates Crown Root Development in Rice.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing assays of OsSPL3-binding sites and RNA-sequencing of differentially expressed transcripts in lcrn1 further identified potential direct targets of OsSPL3 in basal nodes, including a MADS-box transcription factor OsMADS50
