OsMADS50|OsSOC1|DTH3	OsSPL3	OsSPL3, a SBP-Domain Protein, Regulates Crown Root Development in Rice.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing assays of OsSPL3-binding sites and RNA-sequencing of differentially expressed transcripts in lcrn1 further identified potential direct targets of OsSPL3 in basal nodes, including a MADS-box transcription factor OsMADS50
OsSPL3	OsSPL4	CRISPR-based assessment of genomic structure in the conserved SQUAMOSA promoter-binding-like gene clusters in rice	 Expression of OsSPL3 was negatively correlated with that of its closest neighbor in its synteny group, OsSPL4, and its sister paired gene, OsSPL12, in the opposing group
