OsSUT4	WOX11	Improving rice tolerance to potassium deficiency by enhancing OsHAK16p:WOX11-controlled root development	The improvement of sugar partitioning to the roots by the expression of OsHAK16p:WOX11 was further indicated by increasing the expression of OsSUT1 and OsSUT4 genes in leaf blades and several OsMSTs genes in roots.
OsNF-YB1	OsSUT4	NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm	In summary, the aleurone-specific NF-YB1, with stronger expression at the dorsal side, plays an important role in regulating rice grain filling through activating the expression of SUT1, SUT3 and SUT4
OsSUT1	OsSUT4	Phloem loading in rice leaves depends strongly on the apoplastic pathway	 The ossut1 and ossut4 mutants presented a decrease of grain yield, implying important roles of OsSUTs in phloem loading
