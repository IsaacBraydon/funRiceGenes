OsSIZ2	leaf	OsSIZ2 exerts regulatory influences on the developmental responses and phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 Although the relative expression of OsSIZ2 was spatiotemporally regulated, it showed constitutive expression in root and leaf blade irrespective of Pi regime
OsSIZ2	root	OsSIZ2 exerts regulatory influences on the developmental responses and phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 Although the relative expression of OsSIZ2 was spatiotemporally regulated, it showed constitutive expression in root and leaf blade irrespective of Pi regime
OsSIZ2	growth	OsSIZ2 exerts regulatory influences on the developmental responses and phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 Further, attenuation in the expression levels of OsSIZ2 in the roots of ossiz1 and relatively similar trend of the effects of the mutation in OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 on growth and development and total P concentration in different tissues suggested a prevalence of partial functional redundancy between these paralogs
OsSIZ2	development	OsSIZ2 exerts regulatory influences on the developmental responses and phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 Further, attenuation in the expression levels of OsSIZ2 in the roots of ossiz1 and relatively similar trend of the effects of the mutation in OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 on growth and development and total P concentration in different tissues suggested a prevalence of partial functional redundancy between these paralogs
