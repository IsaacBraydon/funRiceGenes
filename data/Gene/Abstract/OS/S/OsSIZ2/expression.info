OsSIZ2	 Although the relative expression of OsSIZ2 was spatiotemporally regulated, it showed constitutive expression in root and leaf blade irrespective of Pi regime |  Further, attenuation in the expression levels of OsSIZ2 in the roots of ossiz1 and relatively similar trend of the effects of the mutation in OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 on growth and development and total P concentration in different tissues suggested a prevalence of partial functional redundancy between these paralogs	 Analysis of T-DNA insertion knockout (ossiz2) and RNAi-mediated knockdown (Ri1-3) mutants revealed positive influences on growth and developmental responses including yield-related traits
