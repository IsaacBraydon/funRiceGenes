Although there have been a number of reports about the functions of SIZ1 in Arabidopsis in the regulation of diverse life processes, no information regarding the role of SIZ in other plants is available yet. In this work, two homologous genes from rice (Oryza sativa) were isolated and designated as OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 based on amino acid sequence homology to AtSIZ1 and their phylogenetic relationship. The function in the vegetative growth and reproductive development in rice was investigated using OsSIZ1 mutants containing a T-DNA insertion. The results showed that the mutant Ossiz1 exhibited the significant changes in several growth and developmental parameters, including primary root length, adventitious root number, plant height, leaf and panicle length, flower formation, and seed-setting rate compared with wild type. Taking together these results indicate that OsSIZ1 plays an important role in regulating growth and development in rice.

The PIAS [protein inhibitor of activated signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)] and SAP (scaffold attachment factor A/B/acinus/PIAS)/MIZ (SIZ) proteins exhibit SUMO E3-ligase activity that facilitates the conjugation of SUMO proteins to target substrates. Here, we report the isolation and molecular characterization of Oryza sativa SIZ1 (OsSIZ1) and SIZ2 (OsSIZ2), rice homologs of Arabidopsis SIZ1. The rice SIZ proteins are localized to the nucleus and showed sumoylation activities in a tobacco system. Our analysis showed increased amounts of SUMO conjugates associated with environmental stresses such as high and low temperature, NaCl and abscisic acid (ABA) in rice plants. The expression of OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 in siz1-2 Arabidopsis plants partially complemented the morphological mutant phenotype and enhanced levels of SUMO conjugates under heat shock conditions. In addition, ABA-hypersensitivity of siz1-2 seed germination was partially suppressed by OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2. The results suggest that rice SIZ1 and SIZ2 are able to functionally complement Arabidopsis SIZ1 in the SUMO conjugation pathway. Their effects on the Arabidopsis mutant suggest a function for these genes related to stress responses and stress adaptation.
