NA	OsSPL regulates meiotic fate acquisition in rice.	2018	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	In angiosperms, the key step in sexual reproduction is successful acquisition of meiotic fate. However, the molecular mechanism determining meiotic fate remains largely unknown. Here, we report that OsSPOROCYTELESS (OsSPL) is critical for meiotic entry in rice (Oryza sativa). We performed a large-scale genetic screen of rice sterile mutants aimed to identify genes regulating meiotic entry and identified OsSPL using map-based cloning. We showed that meiosis-specific callose deposition, chromatin organization, and centromere-specific histone H3 loading were altered in the cells corresponding to pollen mother cells in Osspl anthers. Global transcriptome analysis showed that the enriched differentially expressed genes in Osspl were mainly related to redox status, meiotic process, and parietal cell development. OsSPL might form homodimers and interact with TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF (TCP) transcription factor OsTCP5 via the SPL dimerization and TCP interaction domain. OsSPL also interacts with TPL (TOPLESS) corepressors, OsTPL2 and OsTPL3, via the EAR motif. Our results suggest that the OsSPL-mediated signaling pathway plays a crucial role in rice meiotic entry, which appears to be a conserved regulatory mechanism for meiotic fate acquisition in angiosperms.
NA	Nitrogen Mediates Flowering Time and Nitrogen Use Efficiency via Floral Regulators in Rice	2020	Curr Biol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	High nitrogen (N) fertilization for maximizing crop yield commonly leads to postponed flowering time (heading date in rice) and ripening, thus affecting resources use efficiency and followed planting time. We found that N-mediated heading date-1 (Nhd1) can directly activate florigen gene OsHd3a in rice. Inactivation of either Nhd1 or OsHd3a results in delay and insensitivity to N supply of flowering time. Knockout of Nhd1 increases N uptake and utilization efficiency at low-to-moderate N level under both short- and long-day field conditions. Increasing glutamine, the product of N assimilation, can upregulate expression of Nhd1, which in turn downregulates OsFd-GOGAT expression and OsFd-GOGAT activity, displaying a Nhd1-controlled negative feedback regulatory pathway of N assimilation. Moreover, N fertilization effect on rice flowering time shows genetically controlled diversity, and single-nucleotide polymorphism in Nhd1 promoter may relate to different responses of flowering time to N application. Nhd1 thus balances flowering time and N use efficiency in addition to photoperiod in rice.
