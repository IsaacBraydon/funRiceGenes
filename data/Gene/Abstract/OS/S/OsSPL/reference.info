NA	OsSPL regulates meiotic fate acquisition in rice.	2018	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	In angiosperms, the key step in sexual reproduction is successful acquisition of meiotic fate. However, the molecular mechanism determining meiotic fate remains largely unknown. Here, we report that OsSPOROCYTELESS (OsSPL) is critical for meiotic entry in rice (Oryza sativa). We performed a large-scale genetic screen of rice sterile mutants aimed to identify genes regulating meiotic entry and identified OsSPL using map-based cloning. We showed that meiosis-specific callose deposition, chromatin organization, and centromere-specific histone H3 loading were altered in the cells corresponding to pollen mother cells in Osspl anthers. Global transcriptome analysis showed that the enriched differentially expressed genes in Osspl were mainly related to redox status, meiotic process, and parietal cell development. OsSPL might form homodimers and interact with TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF (TCP) transcription factor OsTCP5 via the SPL dimerization and TCP interaction domain. OsSPL also interacts with TPL (TOPLESS) corepressors, OsTPL2 and OsTPL3, via the EAR motif. Our results suggest that the OsSPL-mediated signaling pathway plays a crucial role in rice meiotic entry, which appears to be a conserved regulatory mechanism for meiotic fate acquisition in angiosperms.
