OsSPL	transcription factor	OsSPL regulates meiotic fate acquisition in rice.	 OsSPL might form homodimers and interact with TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF (TCP) transcription factor OsTCP5 via the SPL dimerization and TCP interaction domain
OsSPL	pollen	OsSPL regulates meiotic fate acquisition in rice.	 We showed that meiosis-specific callose deposition, chromatin organization, and centromere-specific histone H3 loading were altered in the cells corresponding to pollen mother cells in Osspl anthers
OsSPL	development	OsSPL regulates meiotic fate acquisition in rice.	 Global transcriptome analysis showed that the enriched differentially expressed genes in Osspl were mainly related to redox status, meiotic process, and parietal cell development
OsSPL	map-based cloning	OsSPL regulates meiotic fate acquisition in rice.	 We performed a large-scale genetic screen of rice sterile mutants aimed to identify genes regulating meiotic entry and identified OsSPL using map-based cloning
OsSPL	sterile	OsSPL regulates meiotic fate acquisition in rice.	 We performed a large-scale genetic screen of rice sterile mutants aimed to identify genes regulating meiotic entry and identified OsSPL using map-based cloning
OsSPL	meiotic	OsSPL regulates meiotic fate acquisition in rice.	OsSPL regulates meiotic fate acquisition in rice.
OsSPL	meiotic	OsSPL regulates meiotic fate acquisition in rice.	 We performed a large-scale genetic screen of rice sterile mutants aimed to identify genes regulating meiotic entry and identified OsSPL using map-based cloning
OsSPL	meiotic	OsSPL regulates meiotic fate acquisition in rice.	 Global transcriptome analysis showed that the enriched differentially expressed genes in Osspl were mainly related to redox status, meiotic process, and parietal cell development
