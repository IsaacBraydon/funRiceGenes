OsSRDP	 In this study, we investigated the function of LOC_Os04g59420, a gene of DUF740 family (OsSRDP-Oryza sativa Stress Responsive DUF740 Protein) from rice, which showed upregulation in response to abiotic stress in the available global expression data, but is yet to be functionally characterized |  Based on bioinformatics studies, we identified four potential candidate interaction partners for LOC_Os04g59420, of which two genes (LOC_Os05g09640 and LOC_Os06g50370) showed co-expression under biotic and drought stress along with OsSRDP |  Altogether, our findings established that stress-inducible expression of OsSRDP can significantly enhance tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses and a biotic stress
