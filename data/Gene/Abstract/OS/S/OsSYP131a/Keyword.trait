OsSYP131a	fertility	The Rice Qa-SNAREs in SYP13 Subfamily Are Involved in Regulating Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiosis and Seed Fertility.	 After employing CRISPR/Cas9 technique to generate their mutants, the Ossyp131a homozygous mutant T(0) plants exhibited a dwarf phenotype and produced no fertile seeds, indicating a required role of this gene in seed fertility
