OsBISERK1|OsSERK1|OsBAK1	OsSERK2	Expression of SERK family receptor-like protein kinase genes in rice	In this study, we isolated two novel rice genes, OsSERK1 and OsSERK2, belonging to the SERK-family
OsFLS2	OsSERK2	An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors	Here we report the isolation of OsSERK2 (rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2) and demonstrate that OsSERK2 positively regulates immunity mediated by XA21 and XA3 as well as the rice immune receptor FLS2 (OsFLS2)
OsFLS2	OsSERK2	An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors	Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanism of OsSERK2-meditated regulation of rice XA21, XA3, and FLS2 differs from that of AtSERK3/BAK1-mediated regulation of Arabidopsis FLS2 and EFR
OsSERK2	xa21	An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors	Here we report the isolation of OsSERK2 (rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2) and demonstrate that OsSERK2 positively regulates immunity mediated by XA21 and XA3 as well as the rice immune receptor FLS2 (OsFLS2)
OsSERK2	xa21	An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors	OsSERK2 undergoes bidirectional transphosphorylation with XA21 in vitro and forms a constitutive complex with XA21 in vivo
OsSERK2	xa21	An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors	Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanism of OsSERK2-meditated regulation of rice XA21, XA3, and FLS2 differs from that of AtSERK3/BAK1-mediated regulation of Arabidopsis FLS2 and EFR
OsSERK2	xa21	An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors	An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors
OsSERK2	Xa26|Xa3	An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors	Here we report the isolation of OsSERK2 (rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2) and demonstrate that OsSERK2 positively regulates immunity mediated by XA21 and XA3 as well as the rice immune receptor FLS2 (OsFLS2)
OsSERK2	Xa26|Xa3	An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors	Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanism of OsSERK2-meditated regulation of rice XA21, XA3, and FLS2 differs from that of AtSERK3/BAK1-mediated regulation of Arabidopsis FLS2 and EFR
OsSERK2	Xa26|Xa3	An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors	An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors
OsBISERK1|OsSERK1|OsBAK1	OsSERK2	OsSERK1 regulates rice development but not immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae or Magnaporthe oryzae	In yeast, OsSERK1 interacts with itself forming homodimers, and also interacts with the kinase domains of OsSERK2 and BRI1, respectively.
