Some SERK-family receptor-like protein kinase genes have been shown to confer embryonic competence to cells. In this study, we isolated two novel rice genes, OsSERK1 and OsSERK2, belonging to the SERK-family. OsSERK2 showed constitutive expression. The OsSERK1 promoter showed reporter gene activities in some specific tissues in a germinating seed, leaf and root, but not in a developing embryo. This promoter activity suggests that OsSERK1 may have roles in non-embryonic tissues rather than in the embryo.

Generating a new variety of plant with erect-leaf is a critical strategy to improve rice grain yield, as plants with this trait can be dense-planted. The erect-leaf is a significant morphological trait partially regulated by Brassinosteroids (BRs) in rice plants. So far, only a few genes can be used for molecular breeding in rice. Here, we identified OsBAK1 as a potential gene to alter rice architecture. Based on rice genome sequences, four closely related homologs of Arabidopsis BAK1 (AtBAK1) gene were amplified. Phylogenetic analysis and suppression of a weak Arabidopsis mutant bri1-5 indicated that OsBAK1 (Os08g0174700) is the closest relative of AtBAK1. Genetic, physiological, and biochemical analyses all suggest that the function of OsBAK1 is conserved with AtBAK1. Overexpression of a truncated intracellular domain of OsBAK1, but not the extracellular domain of OsBAK1, resulted in a dwarfed phenotype, similar to the rice BR-insensitive mutant plants. The expression of OsBAK1 changed important agricultural traits of rice such as plant height, leaf erectness, grain morphologic features, and disease resistance responses. Our results suggested that a new rice variety with erect-leaf and normal reproduction can be generated simply by suppressing the expression level of OsBAK1. Therefore, OsBAK1 is a potential molecular breeding tool for improving rice grain yield by modifying rice architecture.
Mol. Plant-2014-Chen-mp-ssu003.pdf	An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors	2014	Mol Plant	Department of Plant Pathology and the Genome Center, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.	The rice XA21 immune receptor kinase and the structurally related XA3 receptor confer immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent of bacterial leaf blight. Here we report the isolation of OsSERK2 (rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2) and demonstrate that OsSERK2 positively regulates immunity mediated by XA21 and XA3 as well as the rice immune receptor FLS2 (OsFLS2). Rice plants silenced for OsSerk2 display altered morphology and reduced sensitivity to the hormone brassinolide. OsSERK2 interacts with the intracellular domains of each immune receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system in a kinase activity-dependent manner. OsSERK2 undergoes bidirectional transphosphorylation with XA21 in vitro and forms a constitutive complex with XA21 in vivo. These results demonstrate an essential role for OsSERK2 in the function of three rice immune receptors and suggest that direct interaction with the rice immune receptors is critical for their function. Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanism of OsSERK2-meditated regulation of rice XA21, XA3, and FLS2 differs from that of AtSERK3/BAK1-mediated regulation of Arabidopsis FLS2 and EFR.

Since the identification of BRI1-Associated receptor Kinase 1 (BAK1), a member of the Somatic Embryogenesis Receptor Kinase (SERK) family, the dual functions of BAK1 in BR signaling and innate immunity in Arabidopsis have attracted considerable attention as clues for understanding developmental processes that must be balanced between growth and defense over the life of plants. Here, we extended our research to study cellular functions of OsSERKs in rice. As it was difficult to identify an authentic ortholog of AtBAK1 in rice, we generated transgenic rice in which the expression of multiple OsSERK genes, including OsBAK1, was reduced by OsBAK1 RNA interference. Resulting transgenic rice showed reduced levels of Os-BAK1 and decreased sensitivity to BL, leading to semidwarfism in overall growth. Moreover, they resulted in abnormal growth patterns, especially in leaf development. Most of the OsBAK1RNAi transgenic rice plants were defective in the development of bulliform cells in the leaf epidermal layer. They also showed increased expression level of pathogenesis-related gene and enhanced susceptibility to a rice blast-causing fungal pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae. These results indicate that OsSERK genes, such as OsBAK1, play versatile roles in rice growth and development.
NA	Structure of the OsSERK2 leucine-rich repeat extracellular domain.	2014	Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr	Physical Biosciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 1 Cyclotron Road, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.	Somatic embryogenesis receptor kinases (SERKs) are leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing integral membrane receptors that are involved in the regulation  of development and immune responses in plants. It has recently been shown that rice SERK2 (OsSERK2) is essential for XA21-mediated resistance to the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. OsSERK2 is also required for the BRI1-mediated, FLS2-mediated and EFR-mediated responses to brassinosteroids, flagellin and elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), respectively. Here, crystal structures of the LRR domains of OsSERK2 and a D128N OsSERK2 mutant, expressed as hagfish variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR) fusions, are reported. These structures suggest that the aspartate mutation does not generate any significant conformational change in the protein, but instead leads to an altered interaction with partner receptors.
NA	The Xanthomonas effector XopK harbours E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity that is required for virulence.	2018	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is the causative agent of rice bacterial leaf blight. While the type III secretion system of X.<U+00A0>oryzae pv. oryzae is essential for virulence, the biochemical activities and virulence mechanisms of non-transcription activator-like (non-TAL) effectors delivered by this system are largely unknown. Here, by screening for non-TAL effectors that contribute to X.<U+00A0>oryzae pv. oryzae virulence, we revealed that Xanthomonas outer protein K (XopK) inhibits pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity upstream of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. Specifically, XopK interacted with and directly ubiquitinated rice somatic embryogenic receptor kinase 2 (OsSERK2), resulting in its degradation. Accordingly, mutation of a putative ubiquitin-conjugation enzyme (E2) binding site abolished XopK-induced degradation of OsSERK2 and compromised XopK-dependent virulence. As crucial immune regulators associated with a multitude of immune receptors, SERKs have been shown to be perturbed by Pseudomonas effectors via different mechanisms. Our study revealed a distinct perturbation mechanism of SERK activity via ubiquitination achieved by Xanthomonas non-TAL effector.
NA	Four tyrosine residues of the rice immune receptor XA21 are not required for interaction with the co-receptor OsSERK2 or resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2018	PeerJ	Department of Plant Biology and the Genome Center, University of California, Davis, CA, USA.	Tyrosine phosphorylation has emerged as an important regulator of plasma membrane-localized immune receptors activity. Here, we investigate the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of rice XANTHOMONAS RESISTANCE 21 (XA21)-mediated immunity. We demonstrate that the juxtamembrane and kinase domain of Escherichia coli-expressed XA21 (XA21JK) autophosphorylates on tyrosine residues. Directed mutagenesis of four out of the nine tyrosine residues in XA21JK reduced autophosphorylation. These sites include Tyr698 in the juxtamembrane domain, and Tyr786, Tyr907, and Tyr909 in the kinase domain. Rice plants expressing XA21-GFP fusion proteins or proteins with these tyrosine residues individually mutated to phenylalanine (XA21YF-GFP), which prevents phosphorylation at these sites, maintain resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. In contrast, plants expressing phosphomimetic XA21 variants with tyrosine mutated to aspartate (XA21YD-GFP) were susceptible. In vitro purified XA21JKY698F, XA21JKY907F, and XA21JKY909F variants are catalytically active, whereas activity was not detected in XA21JKY768F and the four XA21JKYD variants. We previously demonstrated that interaction of XA21 with the co-receptor OsSERK2 is critical for biological function. Four of the XA21JKYF variants maintain interaction with OsSERK2 as well as the XA21 binding (XB) proteins XB3 and XB15 in yeast, suggesting that these four tyrosine residues are not required for their interaction. Taken together, these results suggest that XA21 is capable of tyrosine autophosphorylation, but the identified tyrosine residues are not required for activation of XA21-mediated immunity or interaction with predicted XA21 signaling proteins.
NA	Regulation of Brassinosteroid Signaling and Salt Resistance by SERK2 and Potential Utilization for Crop Improvement in Rice	2020	Front Plant Sci	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	The complex roles of the steroid hormone brassinosteroids (BRs) in many different yield- and stress-related traits make it difficult to utilize the hormones for crop improvement. Here, we show that SERK2 as a BR signaling component is a potentially useful candidate for BR manipulation in rice. We generated multiple mutant alleles of SERK2 by CRISPR/Cas9 editing and show that knockout of SERK2 results in a compact structure accompanied with increased grain size. SERK2 is localized on plasma membrane and can interact with OsBRI1, the BR receptor, suggesting its conserved role as co-receptor in BR signaling. Consistently, the mutant has impaired BR sensitivity compared to wild type. Notably, the mutant is highly sensitive to salt stress as evaluated by plant survival rate as well as transcriptome analysis, whereas has slightly increased sensitivity to ABA, the stress hormone. By contrast, overexpression of SERK2 significantly enhances grain size and salt stress resistance, importantly, without affecting plant architecture. Furthermore, while salt suppresses SERK2 transcription, the protein is greatly induced by salt stress. Taken together, we propose that the adverse condition induces SERK2 accumulation to enhance early BR signaling on plasma membrane in favor of the anti-stress response. Our results illustrate the great potentials of specific BR components such as SERK2 for crop improvement by utilizing flexible strategies.
