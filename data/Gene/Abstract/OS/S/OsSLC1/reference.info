NA	OsSLC1 Encodes a Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Essential for Early Chloroplast Development and Seedling Survival.	2020	Rice	College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, China.	In this study, we raised a mutant from tissue-culture-derived plants of Oryza sativa subsp. japonica 'Zhonghua 11', which exhibited a lethal chlorosis phenotype from germination to the third-leaf stage. The mutant was designated seedling-lethal chlorosis 1 (slc1). The slc1 mutant leaves showed extremely low contents of photosynthetic pigments and abnormal chloroplast development, and were severely defective in photosynthesis. Map-based cloning of OsSLC1 revealed that a single base (G) deletion was detected in the first exon of Os06g0710800 in the slc1 mutant, which caused a premature stop codon. Knockout and complementation experiments further confirmed that OsSLC1 is responsible for the seedling-lethal chlorosis phenotype in the slc1 mutant. OsSLC1 was preferentially expressed in green leaves, and encoded a chloroplast-localized PPR protein harboring 12 PPR motifs. Loss-of-function of OsSLC1 affected the intron splicing of multiple group II introns, and especially precluded the intron splicing of rps16, and resulted in significant increase in the transcript levels of 3 chloroplast ribosomal RNAs and 16 chloroplast development-related and photosynthesis-related genes, and in significant reduction in the transcript levels of 1 chloroplast ribosomal RNAs and 2 chloroplast development-related and photosynthesis-related genes.
