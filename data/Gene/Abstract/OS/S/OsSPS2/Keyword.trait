OsSPS2	mitochondria	Two solanesyl diphosphate synthases with different subcellular localizations and their respective physiological roles in Oryza sativa	Green fluorescent protein fusion analyses showed that OsSPS1 localized to mitochondria, while OsSPS2 localized to plastids
OsSPS2	mitochondria	Two solanesyl diphosphate synthases with different subcellular localizations and their respective physiological roles in Oryza sativa	This suggests that OsSPS1 is involved in the supply of solanesyl diphosphate for ubiquinone-9 biosynthesis in mitochondria, whereas OsSPS2 is involved in providing solanesyl diphosphate for plastoquinone-9 formation
OsSPS2	growth	Two solanesyl diphosphate synthases with different subcellular localizations and their respective physiological roles in Oryza sativa	However, an important biological difference was observed between the two genes: OsSPS1 complemented the yeast coq1 disruptant, which does not form UQ, whereas OsSPS2 only very weakly complemented the growth defect of the coq1 mutant
OsSPS2	root	Two solanesyl diphosphate synthases with different subcellular localizations and their respective physiological roles in Oryza sativa	OsSPS1 was highly expressed in root tissue whereas OsSPS2 was found to be high in both leaves and roots
