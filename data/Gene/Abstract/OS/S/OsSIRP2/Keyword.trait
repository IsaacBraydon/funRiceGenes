OsSIRP2	salinity	Oryza sativa salt-induced RING E3 ligase 2 (OsSIRP2) acts as a positive regulator of transketolase in plant response to salinity and osmotic stress.	 Overexpression of OsSIRP2 conferred salinity and osmotic stress tolerance in plants
OsSIRP2	salinity	Oryza sativa salt-induced RING E3 ligase 2 (OsSIRP2) acts as a positive regulator of transketolase in plant response to salinity and osmotic stress.	 Heterogeneous overexpression of OsSIRP2 resulted in conferring tolerance against salinity and osmotic stress
OsSIRP2	salt	Oryza sativa salt-induced RING E3 ligase 2 (OsSIRP2) acts as a positive regulator of transketolase in plant response to salinity and osmotic stress.
