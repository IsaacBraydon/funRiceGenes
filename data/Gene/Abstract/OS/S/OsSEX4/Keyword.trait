OsSEX4	leaf	Genetic engineering of transitory starch accumulation by knockdown of OsSEX4 in rice plants for enhanced bioethanol production.	 Ectopic expression of OsSEX4 complementary DNA complemented the leaf starch-excess phenotype of the Arabidopsis sex4-4 mutant
OsSEX4	starch	Genetic engineering of transitory starch accumulation by knockdown of OsSEX4 in rice plants for enhanced bioethanol production.	Genetic engineering of transitory starch accumulation by knockdown of OsSEX4 in rice plants for enhanced bioethanol production.
OsSEX4	starch	Genetic engineering of transitory starch accumulation by knockdown of OsSEX4 in rice plants for enhanced bioethanol production.	 Starch accumulation was higher in OsSEX4-knockdown suspension-cultured cells, leaves, and rice straw compared with the wild type, suggesting that OsSEX4 plays an important role in degradation of transitory starch
OsSEX4	bioethanol	Genetic engineering of transitory starch accumulation by knockdown of OsSEX4 in rice plants for enhanced bioethanol production.	Genetic engineering of transitory starch accumulation by knockdown of OsSEX4 in rice plants for enhanced bioethanol production.
OsSEX4	bioethanol production	Genetic engineering of transitory starch accumulation by knockdown of OsSEX4 in rice plants for enhanced bioethanol production.	Genetic engineering of transitory starch accumulation by knockdown of OsSEX4 in rice plants for enhanced bioethanol production.
