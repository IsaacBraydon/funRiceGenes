D14L	OsSMAX1	Karrikin Signaling Acts Parallel to and Additively with Strigolactone Signaling to Regulate Rice Mesocotyl Elongation in Darkness 	 We demonstrate that D14L recognizes the karrikin signal and recruits the SCFD3 ubiquitin ligase for the ubiquitination and degradation of OsSMAX1, mirroring the SL-induced and D14- and D3-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of D53
D14L	OsSMAX1	Karrikin Signaling Acts Parallel to and Additively with Strigolactone Signaling to Regulate Rice Mesocotyl Elongation in Darkness 	 Overexpression of OsSMAX1 promoted mesocotyl elongation in the dark, whereas knockout of OsSMAX1 suppressed the elongated-mesocotyl phenotypes of d14l and d3 but had little effect on their shoot branching phenotype
D3	OsSMAX1	Karrikin Signaling Acts Parallel to and Additively with Strigolactone Signaling to Regulate Rice Mesocotyl Elongation in Darkness 	 Overexpression of OsSMAX1 promoted mesocotyl elongation in the dark, whereas knockout of OsSMAX1 suppressed the elongated-mesocotyl phenotypes of d14l and d3 but had little effect on their shoot branching phenotype
D53	OsSMAX1	Karrikin Signaling Acts Parallel to and Additively with Strigolactone Signaling to Regulate Rice Mesocotyl Elongation in Darkness 	 We demonstrate that D14L recognizes the karrikin signal and recruits the SCFD3 ubiquitin ligase for the ubiquitination and degradation of OsSMAX1, mirroring the SL-induced and D14- and D3-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of D53
