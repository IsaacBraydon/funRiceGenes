NA	The negative regulator SMAX1 controls mycorrhizal symbiosis and strigolactone biosynthesis in rice.	2020	Nat Commun	Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 3EA, UK. jc913@cam.ac.uk.	Most plants associate with beneficial arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi that facilitate soil nutrient acquisition. Prior to contact, partner recognition triggers reciprocal genetic remodelling to enable colonisation. The plant Dwarf14-Like (D14L) receptor conditions pre-symbiotic perception of AM fungi, and also detects the smoke constituent karrikin. D14L-dependent signalling mechanisms, underpinning AM symbiosis are unknown. Here, we present the identification of a negative regulator from rice, which operates downstream of the D14L receptor, corresponding to the homologue of the Arabidopsis thaliana Suppressor of MAX2-1 (AtSMAX1) that functions in karrikin signalling. We demonstrate that rice SMAX1 is a suppressor of AM symbiosis, negatively regulating fungal colonisation and transcription of crucial signalling components and conserved symbiosis genes. Similarly, rice SMAX1 negatively controls strigolactone biosynthesis, demonstrating an unexpected crosstalk between the strigolactone and karrikin signalling pathways. We conclude that removal of SMAX1, resulting from D14L signalling activation, de-represses essential symbiotic programmes and increases strigolactone hormone production.
NA	Karrikin Signaling Acts Parallel to and Additively with Strigolactone Signaling to Regulate Rice Mesocotyl Elongation in Darkness 	2020	Plant Cell	Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen CITY: Shenzhen China [CN].	Seedling emergence in monocots depends mainly on mesocotyl elongation, requiring the coordination between developmental signals and environmental stimuli. Strigolactones (SLs) and karrikins are butenolide compounds that regulate various developmental processes; both are able to negatively regulate rice (Oryza sativa) mesocotyl elongation in the dark. Here, we report that a karrikin signaling complex, DWARF 14-LIKE (D14L)-DWARF 3 (D3)-Oryza sativa SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1 (OsSMAX1), regulates rice mesocotyl elongation in the dark. We demonstrate that D14L recognizes the karrikin signal and recruits the SCFD3 ubiquitin ligase for the ubiquitination and degradation of OsSMAX1, mirroring the SL-induced and D14- and D3-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of D53. Overexpression of OsSMAX1 promoted mesocotyl elongation in the dark, whereas knockout of OsSMAX1 suppressed the elongated-mesocotyl phenotypes of d14l and d3 but had little effect on their shoot branching phenotype. OsSMAX1 localizes in nucleus and interacts with TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINs (TPRs), regulating downstream gene expression. Moreover, we showed that the GR24 enantiomers GR245DS and GR24ent-5DS specifically inhibit mesocotyl elongation and regulate downstream gene expression in a D14- and D14L-dependent manner, respectively. Our work revealed that karrikin and SL signaling play parallel and additive roles in modulating downstream genes expression and negatively regulating mesocotyl elongation in the dark.
