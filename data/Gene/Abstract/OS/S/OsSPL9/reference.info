Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are critical regulators of plant antiviral defense. However, little is known as to how these miRNAs respond to virus invasion at the transcriptional level. We established previously that defense to Rice stripe virus (RSV) invasion entailed a reduction of miR528 accumulation in rice, thus alleviating miR528-mediated degradation of L-Ascorbate Oxidase (AO) mRNA, bolstering the antiviral activity of AO. Here we show that this miR528-AO defense module is also regulated by the transcription factor SPL9. SPL9 displayed high affinity binding to specific motifs within the promoter region of miR528 and activated the transcription of miR528 promoter in vivo assay. Loss-of-function mutations in SPL9 correlated with a significant reduction of miR528 but a substantial increase of AO mRNA, enhancing rice resistance to RSV. Conversely, transgenic overexpression of SPL9 stimulated the expression of miR528, hence lowering the level of AO mRNA and compromising rice defense to RSV. Importantly, gain in RSV susceptibility did not occur when SPL9 overexpression was attempted in mir528 loss-of-function mutants, or in transgenic rice expressing a miR528-resistant AO. In conclusion, SPL9-mediated transcriptional activation of miR528 expression adds a novel layer of regulation of the miR528-AO antiviral defense.
NA	Fine-Tuning of MiR528 Accumulation Modulates Flowering Time in Rice.	2019	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; Key Laboratory of Genome Sciences and Information, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	In plants, microRNA (miRNA) functions in the post-transcriptional repression of target mRNAs are well-explored, but the mechanisms regulating the accumulation of miRNAs remain poorly understood. Here, we report that distinct mechanisms regulate accumulation of a monocot-specific miRNA, rice (Oryza sativa) miR528. At the transcriptional level, miR528 accumulated in older plants and exhibited diurnal rhythms; at the post-transcriptional level, aging modulated miR528 levels by enhancing pri-miR528 alternative splicing. In addition, miR528 promoted flowering under long-day conditions by targeting RED AND FAR-RED INSENSITIVE 2 (OsRFI2). Moreover, natural variation in the MIR528 promoter region caused differences in miR528 expression among rice varieties, potentially due to differences in the binding strength of the transcription factor OsSPL9. Together, our findings show evidence for fine-tuning of miR528 levels in rice and provide insight into the mechanisms that regulate MIRNA expression in plants.
