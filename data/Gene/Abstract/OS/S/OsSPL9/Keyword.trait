OsSPL9	grain	Overexpression of OsSPL9 enhances accumulation of Cu in rice grain and improves its digestibility and metabolism	Overexpression of OsSPL9 enhances accumulation of Cu in rice grain and improves its digestibility and metabolism
OsSPL9	transcription factor	Fine-Tuning of MiR528 Accumulation Modulates Flowering Time in Rice.	 Moreover, natural variation in the MIR528 promoter region caused differences in miR528 expression among rice varieties, potentially due to differences in the binding strength of the transcription factor OsSPL9
OsSPL9	development	OsSPL9 Regulates Grain Number and Grain Yield in Rice	 OsSPL9 was highly expressed in the early developing young panicles, consistent with its function of regulating panicle development
OsSPL9	flower	OsSPL9 Regulates Grain Number and Grain Yield in Rice	 By combining expression analysis and dual-luciferase assays, we further confirmed that OsSPL9 directly activates the expression of RCN1 (rice TERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIS homolog) in the early developing young panicle to regulate the panicle branches and GNP
