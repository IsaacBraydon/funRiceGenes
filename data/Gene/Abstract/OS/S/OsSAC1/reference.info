Sugars are the most abundant organic compounds produced by plants, and can be used to build carbon skeleton and generate energy. The sugar accumulation 1 (OsSAC1) gene encodes a protein with an unknown function that exhibits four N-terminal transmembrane regions and two conserved domains DUF4220 and DUF594 with unknown functions. OsSAC1 was found poorly and specifically expressed at the bottoms of young leaves and in the developing leaf sheathes. Subcellular location results showed that OsSAC1 was co-localized with ER:mCherry and targeted the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). OsSAC1 has been found to affect sugar partitioning in rice (Oryza sativa). I2/KI starch staining, ultrastructure observations, and starch content measurements indicated that more and larger starch granules accumulated in ossac1 source leaves than in wild-type (WT) source leaves. Additionally, higher sucrose and glucose concentrations accumulated in the ossac1 source leaves than in WT source leaves. Whereas, lower sucrose and glucose concentrations were observed in the ossac1 young leaves and developing leaf sheathes than those of the WT. Extremely more OsAGPL1 and OsAGPS1 (responsible for starch synthesis) expression and significantly less OscFBP1, OscFBP2, OsSPS1, and OsSPS11 (responsible for sucrose synthesis) and OsSWEET11, OsSWEET14, and OsSUT1 (responsible for sucrose loading) expression occurred in ossac1 source leaves than in WT source leaves. More rice plasmodesmata negative regulator OsGSD1 was detected in ossac1 young leaves and developing leaf sheathes than in those of the WT. These results suggest that ER targeted OsSAC1 may indirectly regulate sugar partitioning in carbon-demanding young leaves and developing leaf sheathes.
