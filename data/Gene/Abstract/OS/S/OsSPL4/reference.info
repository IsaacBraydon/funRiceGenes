NA	Identification of Key Genes for the Ultrahigh Yield of Rice Using Dynamic Cross-tissue Network Analysis	2020	Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650223, China; State Key Laboratory of Hybrid rice, College of life sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China.	Significantly increasing crop yield is a major and worldwide challenge for food supply and security. It is well-known that rice cultivated at Taoyuan in Yunnan of China can produce the highest yield worldwide. Yet, the gene regulatory mechanism underpinning this ultrahigh yield has been a mystery. Here, we systematically collected the transcriptome data for seven key tissues at different developmental stages using rice cultivated both at Taoyuan as the case group and at another regular rice planting place Jinghong as the control group. We identified the top 24 candidate high-yield genes with their network modules from these well-designed datasets by developing a novel computational systems biology method, i.e., dynamic cross-tissue (DCT) network analysis. We used one of the candidate genes, OsSPL4, whose function was previously unknown, for gene editing experimental validation of the high yield, and confirmed that OsSPL4 significantly affects panicle branching and increases the rice yield. This study, which included extensive field phenotyping, cross-tissue systems biology analyses, and functional validation, uncovered the key genes and gene regulatory networks underpinning the ultrahigh yield of rice. The DCT method could be applied to other plant or animal systems if different phenotypes under various environments with the common genome sequences of the examined sample.

NA	CRISPR-based assessment of genomic structure in the conserved SQUAMOSA promoter-binding-like gene clusters in rice	2020	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China.	Although SQUAMOSA promoter-binding-like (SPL) transcription factors are important regulators of development in rice (Oryza sativa), prior assessments of the SPL family have been limited to single genes. A functional comparison across the full gene family in standardized genetic backgrounds has not been reported previously. Here, we demonstrate that the SPL gene family in rice is enriched due to the most recent whole genome duplication (WGD). Notably, 10 of 19 rice SPL genes (52%) cluster in four units that have persisted for at least 50 million years. We show that SPL gene grouping and retention following WGD is widespread in angiosperms, suggesting the conservatism and importance of this gene arrangement. We used Cas9 editing to generate transformation lines for all 19 SPL genes in a common set of backgrounds, and found that knockouts of 14 SPL genes exhibited defects in plant height, 10 exhibited defects in panicle size, and nine had altered grain lengths. We observed subfunctionalization of genes in the paleoduplicated pairs, but little evidence of neofunctionalization. Expression of OsSPL3 was negatively correlated with that of its closest neighbor in its synteny group, OsSPL4, and its sister paired gene, OsSPL12, in the opposing group. Nucleotide diversity was lower in eight of the nine singleton genes in domesticated rice, relative to wild rice, whereas the reverse was true for the paired genes. Together, these results provide functional information on eight previously unexamined OsSPL family members and suggest that paleoduplicate pair redundancy benefits plant survival and innovation.
NA	The Elite Alleles of OsSPL4 Regulate Grain Size and Increase Grain Yield in Rice.	2021	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.	Grain weight and grain number, the two important yield traits, are mainly determined by grain size and panicle architecture in rice. Herein, we report the identification and functional analysis of OsSPL4 in panicle and grain development of rice. Using CRISPR/Cas9 system, two elite alleles of OsSPL4 were obtained, which exhibited an increasing number of grains per panicle and grain size, resulting in increase of rice yield. Cytological analysis showed that OsSPL4 could regulate spikelet development by promoting cell division. The results of RNA-seq and qRT-PCR validations also demonstrated that several MADS-box and cell-cycle genes were up-regulated in the mutation lines. Co-expression network revealed that many yield-related genes were involved in the regulation network of OsSPL4. In addition, OsSPL4 could be cleaved by the osa-miR156 in vivo, and the OsmiR156-OsSPL4 module might regulate the grain size in rice. Further analysis indicated that the large-grain allele of OsSPL4 in indica rice might introgress from aus varieties under artificial selection. Taken together, our findings suggested thatÂ OsSPL4 could be as a key regulator of grain size by acting on cell division control and provided a strategy for panicle architecture and grain size modification for yield improvement in rice.
