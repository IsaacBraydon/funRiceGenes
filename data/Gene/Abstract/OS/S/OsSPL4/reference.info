NA	Identification of Key Genes for the Ultrahigh Yield of Rice Using Dynamic Cross-tissue Network Analysis	2020	Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650223, China; State Key Laboratory of Hybrid rice, College of life sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China.	Significantly increasing crop yield is a major and worldwide challenge for food supply and security. It is well-known that rice cultivated at Taoyuan in Yunnan of China can produce the highest yield worldwide. Yet, the gene regulatory mechanism underpinning this ultrahigh yield has been a mystery. Here, we systematically collected the transcriptome data for seven key tissues at different developmental stages using rice cultivated both at Taoyuan as the case group and at another regular rice planting place Jinghong as the control group. We identified the top 24 candidate high-yield genes with their network modules from these well-designed datasets by developing a novel computational systems biology method, i.e., dynamic cross-tissue (DCT) network analysis. We used one of the candidate genes, OsSPL4, whose function was previously unknown, for gene editing experimental validation of the high yield, and confirmed that OsSPL4 significantly affects panicle branching and increases the rice yield. This study, which included extensive field phenotyping, cross-tissue systems biology analyses, and functional validation, uncovered the key genes and gene regulatory networks underpinning the ultrahigh yield of rice. The DCT method could be applied to other plant or animal systems if different phenotypes under various environments with the common genome sequences of the examined sample.

NA	CRISPR-based assessment of genomic structure in the conserved SQUAMOSA promoter-binding-like gene clusters in rice	2020	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China.	Although SQUAMOSA promoter-binding-like (SPL) transcription factors are important regulators of development in rice (Oryza sativa), prior assessments of the SPL family have been limited to single genes. A functional comparison across the full gene family in standardized genetic backgrounds has not been reported previously. Here, we demonstrate that the SPL gene family in rice is enriched due to the most recent whole genome duplication (WGD). Notably, 10 of 19 rice SPL genes (52%) cluster in four units that have persisted for at least 50 million years. We show that SPL gene grouping and retention following WGD is widespread in angiosperms, suggesting the conservatism and importance of this gene arrangement. We used Cas9 editing to generate transformation lines for all 19 SPL genes in a common set of backgrounds, and found that knockouts of 14 SPL genes exhibited defects in plant height, 10 exhibited defects in panicle size, and nine had altered grain lengths. We observed subfunctionalization of genes in the paleoduplicated pairs, but little evidence of neofunctionalization. Expression of OsSPL3 was negatively correlated with that of its closest neighbor in its synteny group, OsSPL4, and its sister paired gene, OsSPL12, in the opposing group. Nucleotide diversity was lower in eight of the nine singleton genes in domesticated rice, relative to wild rice, whereas the reverse was true for the paired genes. Together, these results provide functional information on eight previously unexamined OsSPL family members and suggest that paleoduplicate pair redundancy benefits plant survival and innovation.
