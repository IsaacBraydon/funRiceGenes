OsSNAP32	culm	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel SNAP25-type protein gene OsSNAP32 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay showed that the OsSNAP32 is highly expressed in leaves and culms, and low in roots of rice, while hardly detected in immature spikes and flowering spikes
OsSNAP32	blast	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel SNAP25-type protein gene OsSNAP32 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 The expression of OsSNAP32 was significantly activated in rice seedlings treated with H2O2, PEG6000, and low temperature or after inoculation with rice blast (Magnaporthe grisea strain Hoku 1)
OsSNAP32	root	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel SNAP25-type protein gene OsSNAP32 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay showed that the OsSNAP32 is highly expressed in leaves and culms, and low in roots of rice, while hardly detected in immature spikes and flowering spikes
OsSNAP32	seedling	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel SNAP25-type protein gene OsSNAP32 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 The expression of OsSNAP32 was significantly activated in rice seedlings treated with H2O2, PEG6000, and low temperature or after inoculation with rice blast (Magnaporthe grisea strain Hoku 1)
OsSNAP32	temperature	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel SNAP25-type protein gene OsSNAP32 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	" The expression of OsSNAP32 was significantly activated in rice seedlings treated with H2O2, PEG6000, and low temperature or after inoculation with rice blast (Magnaporthe grisea strain Hoku 1)"
OsSNAP32	flower	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel SNAP25-type protein gene OsSNAP32 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay showed that the OsSNAP32 is highly expressed in leaves and culms, and low in roots of rice, while hardly detected in immature spikes and flowering spikes
