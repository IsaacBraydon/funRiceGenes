OsSEC3A	OsSNAP32	Disruption of OsSEC3A increases the content of salicylic acid and induces plant defense responses in rice.	 In addition, OsSEC3A interacted with rice SNAP25-type t-SNARE protein OsSNAP32, which is involved in rice blast resistance, via the C-terminus and bound to phosphatidylinositol lipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, through its N-terminus
OsSNAP32	OsSYP121	OsSYP121 accumulates at fungi penetration sites and mediates host resistance to rice blast.	 Yeast two-hybrid results showed that OsSYP121 can interact with OsSNAP32 (Synaptosome-associated protein of 32 kDa) and OsVAMP714/724 (Vesicle-associated membrane protein714/724)
OsSNAP32	OsSYP121	OsSYP121 accumulates at fungi penetration sites and mediates host resistance to rice blast.	 The interaction between OsSYP121 and OsSNAP32 may contribute to host resistance to rice blast
OCP	OsSNAP32	Knockout of a papain-like cysteine protease gene OCP enhances blast resistance in rice.	 We prove that OCP, featuring cysteine protease activity, interacts with OsRACK1A (receptor for activated C kinase 1) and OsSNAP32 (synaptosome-associated protein of 32 kD) physically in vitro and in vivo, and they co-locate in the rice cytoplasm but cannot form a ternary complex
OCP	OsSNAP32	Knockout of a papain-like cysteine protease gene OCP enhances blast resistance in rice.	 Therefore, OCP negatively regulates blast resistance in rice by interacting with OsRACK1A or OsSNAP32 and influencing the expression profiles of many resistance-related genes
