OsSEC3A	OsSNAP32	Disruption of OsSEC3A increases the content of salicylic acid and induces plant defense responses in rice.	 In addition, OsSEC3A interacted with rice SNAP25-type t-SNARE protein OsSNAP32, which is involved in rice blast resistance, via the C-terminus and bound to phosphatidylinositol lipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, through its N-terminus
OsSNAP32	OsSYP121	OsSYP121 accumulates at fungi penetration sites and mediates host resistance to rice blast.	 Yeast two-hybrid results showed that OsSYP121 can interact with OsSNAP32 (Synaptosome-associated protein of 32 kDa) and OsVAMP714/724 (Vesicle-associated membrane protein714/724)
OsSNAP32	OsSYP121	OsSYP121 accumulates at fungi penetration sites and mediates host resistance to rice blast.	 The interaction between OsSYP121 and OsSNAP32 may contribute to host resistance to rice blast
