OsSUN2	meiosis	The SUN domain proteins OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 play critical but partially redundant roles in meiosis	The SUN domain proteins OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 play critical but partially redundant roles in meiosis
OsSUN2	meiosis	The SUN domain proteins OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 play critical but partially redundant roles in meiosis	 The Ossun1 Ossun2 double mutant showed severe defects in telomere clustering, homologous pairing and crossover formation, suggesting that OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 are essential for rice meiosis
OsSUN2	meiosis	The SUN domain proteins OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 play critical but partially redundant roles in meiosis	 Importantly, the Ossun1 single mutant had a normal phenotype but meiosis was disrupted in the Ossun2 mutant, indicating that OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 are not completely redundant in rice
OsSUN2	meiosis	The SUN domain proteins OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 play critical but partially redundant roles in meiosis	 These results suggested that OsSUN2 plays a more critical role than OsSUN1 in rice meiosis
OsSUN2	meiosis	The SUN domain proteins OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 play critical but partially redundant roles in meiosis	 Taken together, this work reveals the essential but partially redundant roles of OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 in rice meiosis and demonstrates that functional divergence of SUN proteins has taken place during evolution
OsSUN2	crossover	The SUN domain proteins OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 play critical but partially redundant roles in meiosis	 The Ossun1 Ossun2 double mutant showed severe defects in telomere clustering, homologous pairing and crossover formation, suggesting that OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 are essential for rice meiosis
OsSUN2	crossover	The SUN domain proteins OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 play critical but partially redundant roles in meiosis	 When introducing a mutant allele of OsSPORULATION11 (OsSPO11)-1, which encodes a topoisomerase initiating homologous recombination, into the Ossun1 Ossun2 mutant, we observed a combined Osspo11-1- and Ossun1 Ossun2-like phenotype, demonstrating that OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 promote bouquet formation independent of OsSPO11-1, but regulate pairing and crossover formation downstream of OsSPO11-1
OsSUN2	homologous recombination	The SUN domain proteins OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 play critical but partially redundant roles in meiosis	 When introducing a mutant allele of OsSPORULATION11 (OsSPO11)-1, which encodes a topoisomerase initiating homologous recombination, into the Ossun1 Ossun2 mutant, we observed a combined Osspo11-1- and Ossun1 Ossun2-like phenotype, demonstrating that OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 promote bouquet formation independent of OsSPO11-1, but regulate pairing and crossover formation downstream of OsSPO11-1
