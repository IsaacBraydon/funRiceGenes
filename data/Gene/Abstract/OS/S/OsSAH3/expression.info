OsSAH3	 Knockout OsSAH2 and OsSAH3 (sahKO) genes conferred enhanced resistance to both hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens, whereas overexpression of each OsSAH gene increased susceptibility to the pathogens	 Knockout OsSAH2 and OsSAH3 (sahKO) genes conferred enhanced resistance to both hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens, whereas overexpression of each OsSAH gene increased susceptibility to the pathogens
OsSAH3|OsS5H1	 SA levels were significantly increased in the oss5h mutants, while they were dramatically decreased in the OsS5H1 and OsS5H2 overexpression lines	 SA levels were significantly increased in the oss5h mutants, while they were dramatically decreased in the OsS5H1 and OsS5H2 overexpression lines
