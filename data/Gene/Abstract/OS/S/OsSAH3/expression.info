OsSAH3	 Knockout OsSAH2 and OsSAH3 (sahKO) genes conferred enhanced resistance to both hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens, whereas overexpression of each OsSAH gene increased susceptibility to the pathogens	 Knockout OsSAH2 and OsSAH3 (sahKO) genes conferred enhanced resistance to both hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens, whereas overexpression of each OsSAH gene increased susceptibility to the pathogens
OsSAH3|OsS5H1	 SA levels were significantly increased in the oss5h mutants, while they were dramatically decreased in the OsS5H1 and OsS5H2 overexpression lines	 SA levels were significantly increased in the oss5h mutants, while they were dramatically decreased in the OsS5H1 and OsS5H2 overexpression lines
OsSAH3|OsS5H1|OsS3H	Activated Expression of Rice DMR6-like Gene OsS3H Partially Explores the Susceptibility to Bacterial Leaf Streak Mediated by Knock-Out OsF3H04g. |  To explore the susceptibility mechanism in OsF3H04g loss-of-function rice lines, transcriptome sequencing revealed that another homolog, OsS3H, had induced expression in the loss-of-function OsF3H04g rice lines |  Then, we found that the overexpression of OsS3H increased rice susceptibility to BLS, while gene-editing mediated the loss-of-function OsS3H enhanced rice resistance to BLS |  Thus, we concluded that the knock-out of OsF3H04g activated the expression of the OsS3H, partially participating in the susceptibility to BLS in rice	 Then, we found that the overexpression of OsS3H increased rice susceptibility to BLS, while gene-editing mediated the loss-of-function OsS3H enhanced rice resistance to BLS
