OsSAH3|OsS5H1|OsS3H	resistance	Salicylic Acid Is Required for Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance in Rice.	 Knockout OsSAH2 and OsSAH3 (sahKO) genes conferred enhanced resistance to both hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens, whereas overexpression of each OsSAH gene increased susceptibility to the pathogens
OsSAH3|OsS5H1|OsS3H	magnaporthe oryzae	Salicylic Acid Is Required for Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance in Rice.	 Analysis of the OsSAH3 promoter indicated that its induction was mainly restricted around Magnaporthe oryzae infection sites
OsSAH3|OsS5H1|OsS3H	sa	Salicylic Acid Is Required for Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance in Rice.	 Recombinant OsSAH proteins catalyzed SA in vitro, while OsSAH3 protein showed only SA 5-hydroxylase (SA5H) activity, which was remarkably higher than that of other OsSAHs that presented both SA3H and SA5H activities
OsSAH3|OsS5H1|OsS3H	SA	Salicylic Acid Is Required for Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance in Rice.	 Recombinant OsSAH proteins catalyzed SA in vitro, while OsSAH3 protein showed only SA 5-hydroxylase (SA5H) activity, which was remarkably higher than that of other OsSAHs that presented both SA3H and SA5H activities
OsSAH3|OsS5H1|OsS3H	 sa 	Salicylic Acid Is Required for Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance in Rice.	 Recombinant OsSAH proteins catalyzed SA in vitro, while OsSAH3 protein showed only SA 5-hydroxylase (SA5H) activity, which was remarkably higher than that of other OsSAHs that presented both SA3H and SA5H activities
OsSAH3|OsS5H1|OsS3H	sa	Disruption of the primary salicylic acid hydroxylases in rice enhances broad-spectrum resistance against pathogens.	 SA levels were significantly increased in the oss5h mutants, while they were dramatically decreased in the OsS5H1 and OsS5H2 overexpression lines
OsSAH3|OsS5H1|OsS3H	SA	Disruption of the primary salicylic acid hydroxylases in rice enhances broad-spectrum resistance against pathogens.	 SA levels were significantly increased in the oss5h mutants, while they were dramatically decreased in the OsS5H1 and OsS5H2 overexpression lines

OsSAH3|OsS5H1|OsS3H	leaf	Activated Expression of Rice DMR6-like Gene OsS3H Partially Explores the Susceptibility to Bacterial Leaf Streak Mediated by Knock-Out OsF3H04g.	Activated Expression of Rice DMR6-like Gene OsS3H Partially Explores the Susceptibility to Bacterial Leaf Streak Mediated by Knock-Out OsF3H04g.
OsSAH3|OsS5H1|OsS3H	resistance	Activated Expression of Rice DMR6-like Gene OsS3H Partially Explores the Susceptibility to Bacterial Leaf Streak Mediated by Knock-Out OsF3H04g.	 Then, we found that the overexpression of OsS3H increased rice susceptibility to BLS, while gene-editing mediated the loss-of-function OsS3H enhanced rice resistance to BLS
OsSAH3|OsS5H1|OsS3H	resistance	Activated Expression of Rice DMR6-like Gene OsS3H Partially Explores the Susceptibility to Bacterial Leaf Streak Mediated by Knock-Out OsF3H04g.	 However, the knock-out of both OsF3H04g and OsS3H by gene-editing only neutralized rice resistance to BLS
