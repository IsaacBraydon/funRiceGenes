OsSAH3	resistance	Salicylic Acid Is Required for Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance in Rice.	 Knockout OsSAH2 and OsSAH3 (sahKO) genes conferred enhanced resistance to both hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens, whereas overexpression of each OsSAH gene increased susceptibility to the pathogens
OsSAH3	magnaporthe oryzae	Salicylic Acid Is Required for Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance in Rice.	 Analysis of the OsSAH3 promoter indicated that its induction was mainly restricted around Magnaporthe oryzae infection sites
OsSAH3	sa	Salicylic Acid Is Required for Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance in Rice.	 Recombinant OsSAH proteins catalyzed SA in vitro, while OsSAH3 protein showed only SA 5-hydroxylase (SA5H) activity, which was remarkably higher than that of other OsSAHs that presented both SA3H and SA5H activities
