Rice plants contain high basal levels of salicylic acid (SA), but some of their functions remain elusive. To elucidate the importance of SA homeostasis in rice immunity, we characterized four rice SA hydroxylase genes (OsSAHs) and verified their roles in SA metabolism and disease resistance. Recombinant OsSAH proteins catalyzed SA in vitro, while OsSAH3 protein showed only SA 5-hydroxylase (SA5H) activity, which was remarkably higher than that of other OsSAHs that presented both SA3H and SA5H activities. Amino acid substitutions revealed that three amino acids in the binding pocket affected SAH enzyme activity and/or specificity. Knockout OsSAH2 and OsSAH3 (sahKO) genes conferred enhanced resistance to both hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens, whereas overexpression of each OsSAH gene increased susceptibility to the pathogens. sahKO mutants showed increased SA and jasmonate levels compared to those of the wild type and OsSAH-overexpressing plants. Analysis of the OsSAH3 promoter indicated that its induction was mainly restricted around Magnaporthe oryzae infection sites. Taken together, our findings indicate that SA plays a vital role in immune signaling. Moreover, fine-tuning SA homeostasis through suppression of SA metabolism is an effective approach in studying broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.
NA	Disruption of the primary salicylic acid hydroxylases in rice enhances broad-spectrum resistance against pathogens.	2022	Plant Cell Environ	Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Biotechnology on Specialty Economic Plants, College of Chemistry and Life Sciences, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua, Zhejiang, China.	Salicylic acid (SA) is a crucial hormone involved in plant immunity. Rice (Oryza sativa) maintains high SA levels that are not induced by pathogens. However, the roles of SA in rice immunity and yield remain largely unknown. Here, we identified SA 5-hydroxylases 1 (OsS5H1) and 2 (OsS5H2) as the primary enzymes engaged in catalysing SA to 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA) in rice. SA levels were significantly increased in the oss5h mutants, while they were dramatically decreased in the OsS5H1 and OsS5H2 overexpression lines. The mutants were resistant, whereas the overexpression lines were susceptible to Pyricularia oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae. Moreover, the pathogen-associated molecular patterns-triggered immunity responses, including reactive oxygen species burst and callose deposition, were enhanced in all the mutants and compromised in the overexpression lines. Quantification of the agronomic traits of the oss5h mutants grown in the paddy fields demonstrated that the grain number per panicle was decreased as the SA levels increased; however, the tiller number and grain size were enhanced, resulting in no significant yield penalty. Collectively, we reveal that mildly increasing SA content in rice can confer broad-spectrum resistance without yield penalty and put new insights into the roles of SA in immunity and growth.
