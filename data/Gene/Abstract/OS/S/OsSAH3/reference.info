NA	Salicylic Acid Is Required for Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance in Rice.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	Key Laboratory of Pest Monitoring and Green Management, MOA, Joint Laboratory for International Cooperation in Crop Molecular Breeding, Department of Plant Pathology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.	Rice plants contain high basal levels of salicylic acid (SA), but some of their functions remain elusive. To elucidate the importance of SA homeostasis in rice immunity, we characterized four rice SA hydroxylase genes (OsSAHs) and verified their roles in SA metabolism and disease resistance. Recombinant OsSAH proteins catalyzed SA in vitro, while OsSAH3 protein showed only SA 5-hydroxylase (SA5H) activity, which was remarkably higher than that of other OsSAHs that presented both SA3H and SA5H activities. Amino acid substitutions revealed that three amino acids in the binding pocket affected SAH enzyme activity and/or specificity. Knockout OsSAH2 and OsSAH3 (sahKO) genes conferred enhanced resistance to both hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens, whereas overexpression of each OsSAH gene increased susceptibility to the pathogens. sahKO mutants showed increased SA and jasmonate levels compared to those of the wild type and OsSAH-overexpressing plants. Analysis of the OsSAH3 promoter indicated that its induction was mainly restricted around Magnaporthe oryzae infection sites. Taken together, our findings indicate that SA plays a vital role in immune signaling. Moreover, fine-tuning SA homeostasis through suppression of SA metabolism is an effective approach in studying broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.
NA	Disruption of the primary salicylic acid hydroxylases in rice enhances broad-spectrum resistance against pathogens.	2022	Plant Cell Environ	Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Biotechnology on Specialty Economic Plants, College of Chemistry and Life Sciences, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua, Zhejiang, China.	Salicylic acid (SA) is a crucial hormone involved in plant immunity. Rice (Oryza sativa) maintains high SA levels that are not induced by pathogens. However, the roles of SA in rice immunity and yield remain largely unknown. Here, we identified SA 5-hydroxylases 1 (OsS5H1) and 2 (OsS5H2) as the primary enzymes engaged in catalysing SA to 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA) in rice. SA levels were significantly increased in the oss5h mutants, while they were dramatically decreased in the OsS5H1 and OsS5H2 overexpression lines. The mutants were resistant, whereas the overexpression lines were susceptible to Pyricularia oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae. Moreover, the pathogen-associated molecular patterns-triggered immunity responses, including reactive oxygen species burst and callose deposition, were enhanced in all the mutants and compromised in the overexpression lines. Quantification of the agronomic traits of the oss5h mutants grown in the paddy fields demonstrated that the grain number per panicle was decreased as the SA levels increased; however, the tiller number and grain size were enhanced, resulting in no significant yield penalty. Collectively, we reveal that mildly increasing SA content in rice can confer broad-spectrum resistance without yield penalty and put new insights into the roles of SA in immunity and growth.
NA	Activated Expression of Rice DMR6-like Gene OsS3H Partially Explores the Susceptibility to Bacterial Leaf Streak Mediated by Knock-Out OsF3H04g.	2023	Int J Mol Sci	College of Plant Protection, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, China.	Downy Mildew Resistance 6-like (DMR6-like) genes are identified as salicylic acid (SA) hydroxylases and negative regulators of plant immunity. Previously, we identified two rice DMR6-like genes, OsF3H03g, and OsF3H04g, that act as susceptible targets of transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc), which causes bacterial leaf streak (BLS) in rice. Furthermore, all four homologs of rice DMR6-like proteins were identified to predominantly carry the enzyme activity of SA 5-hydroxylase (S5H), negatively regulate rice broad-spectrum resistance, and cause the loss of function of these OsDMR6s, leading to increased resistance to rice blast and bacterial blight (BB). Here, we curiously found that an OsF3H04g knock-out mutant created by T-DNA insertion, osf3h04g, was remarkedly susceptible to BLS and BB and showed an extreme reduction in SA content. OsF3H04g knock-out rice lines produced by gene-editing were mildly susceptible to BLS and reduced content of SA. To explore the susceptibility mechanism in OsF3H04g loss-of-function rice lines, transcriptome sequencing revealed that another homolog, OsS3H, had induced expression in the loss-of-function OsF3H04g rice lines. Furthermore, we confirmed that a great induction of OsS3H downstream and genomically adjacent to OsF3H04g in osf3h04g was primarily related to the inserted T-DNA carrying quadruple enhancer elements of 35S, while a slight induction was caused by an unknown mechanism in gene-editing lines. Then, we found that the overexpression of OsS3H increased rice susceptibility to BLS, while gene-editing mediated the loss-of-function OsS3H enhanced rice resistance to BLS. However, the knock-out of both OsF3H04g and OsS3H by gene-editing only neutralized rice resistance to BLS. Thus, we concluded that the knock-out of OsF3H04g activated the expression of the OsS3H, partially participating in the susceptibility to BLS in rice.
