To explore the susceptibility mechanism in OsF3H04g loss-of-function rice lines, transcriptome sequencing revealed that another homolog, OsS3H, had induced expression in the loss-of-function OsF3H04g rice lines

Furthermore, we confirmed that a great induction of OsS3H downstream and genomically adjacent to OsF3H04g in osf3h04g was primarily related to the inserted T-DNA carrying quadruple enhancer elements of 35S, while a slight induction was caused by an unknown mechanism in gene-editing lines

Thus, we concluded that the knock-out of OsF3H04g activated the expression of the OsS3H, partially participating in the susceptibility to BLS in rice
