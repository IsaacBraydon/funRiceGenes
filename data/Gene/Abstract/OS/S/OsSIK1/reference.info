Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play essential roles in plant growth, development and responses to environmental stresses. A putative RLK gene, OsSIK1, with extracellular leucine-rich repeats was cloned and characterized in rice (Oryza sativa). OsSIK1 exhibits kinase activity in the presence of Mn(2+), and the OsSIK1 kinase domain has the ability to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate myelin basic protein (MBP). OsSIK1 promoter-GUS analysis revealed that OsSIK1 is expressed mainly in the stem and spikelet in rice. The expression of OsSIK1 is mainly induced by salt, drought and H(2)O(2) treatments. Transgenic rice plants with overexpression of OsSIK1 show higher tolerance to salt and drought stresses than control plants. On the contrary, the knock-out mutants sik1-1 and sik1-2, as well as RNA interference (RNAi) plants, are sensitive to drought and salt stresses. The activities of peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase are enhanced significantly in OsSIK1-overexpressing plants. Also, the accumulation of H(2)O(2) in leaves of OsSIK1-overexpressing plants is much less than that of the mutants, RNAi plants and control plants, as measured by 3,3'-diamino benzidine (DAB) staining. We also show that OsSIK1 affects stomatal density in the abaxial and adaxial leaf epidermis of rice. These results indicate that OsSIK1 plays important roles in salt and drought stress tolerance in rice, through the activation of the antioxidative system.
NA	Phylogenetic and CRISPR/Cas9 Studies in Deciphering the Evolutionary Trajectory and Phenotypic Impacts of Rice ERECTA Genes.	2018	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.	The ERECTA family genes (ERfs) have been found to play diverse functions in Arabidopsis, including controlling cell proliferation and cell growth, regulating stomata patterning, and responding to various stresses. This wide range of functions has rendered them as a potential candidate for crop improvement. However, information on their functional roles, particularly their morphological impact, in crop genomes, such as rice, is limited. Here, through evolutionary prediction, we first depict the evolutionary trajectory of the ER family, and show that the ER family is actually highly conserved across different species, suggesting that most of their functions may also be observed in other plant species. We then take advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated nuclease 9) system to assess their morphological impact on one of the most important crops, rice. Loss-of-function mutants of OsER1 and OsER2 display shortened plant stature and reduced panicle size, suggesting they possibly also functioned in regulating cell proliferation and cell growth in rice. In addition to functions similar to that in Arabidopsis, we also find clues that rice ERfs may play unique functional roles. The OsER2 displayed more severe phenotypic changes than OsER1, indicating putative differentiation in their functions. The OsERL might be of essential in its function, and the proper function of all three rice ER genes might be dependent of their genetic background. Future investigations relating to these functions are key to exploiting ERfs in crop development.
NA	OsNAC45 is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice	2020	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530004, China.	Background: Salt stress threatens crop yields all over the world. Many NAC transcription factors have been reported to be involved in different abiotic stress responses, but it remains unclear how loss of these transcription factors alters the transcriptomes of plants. Previous reports have demonstrated that overexpression of OsNAC45 enhances salt and drought tolerance in rice, and that OsNAC45 may regulate the expression of two specific genes, OsPM1 and OsLEA3-1.  Results: Here, we found that ABA repressed, and NaCl promoted, the expression of OsNAC45 in roots. Immunostaining showed that OsNAC45 was localized in all root cells and was mainly expressed in the stele. Loss of OsNAC45 decreased the sensitivity of rice plants to ABA and over-expressing this gene had the opposite effect, which demonstrated that OsNAC45 played an important role during ABA signal responses. Knockout of OsNAC45 also resulted in more ROS accumulation in roots and increased sensitivity of rice to salt stress. Transcriptome sequencing assay found that thousands of genes were differently expressed in OsNAC45-knockout plants. Most of the down-regulated genes participated in plant stress responses. Quantitative real time RT-PCR suggested that seven genes may be regulated by OsNAC45 including OsCYP89G1, OsDREB1F, OsEREBP2, OsERF104, OsPM1, OsSAMDC2, and OsSIK1.  Conclusions: These results indicate that OsNAC45 plays vital roles in ABA signal responses and salt tolerance in rice. Further characterization of this gene may help us understand ABA signal pathway and breed rice plants that are more tolerant to salt stress.
NA	Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) to Identify Salt-Tolerance QTLs Carrying Novel Candidate Genes in Rice During Early Vegetative Stage	2021	Rice (N Y)	Agricultural Biotechnology Department, Faculty of Agriculture, Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran.	Background: Rice is considered as a salt-sensitive plant, particularly at early vegetative stage, and its production is suffered from salinity due to expansion of salt affected land in areas under cultivation. Hence, significant increase of rice productivity on salinized lands is really necessary. Today genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a method of choice for fine mapping of QTLs involved in plant responses to abiotic stresses including salinity stress at early vegetative stage. In this study using > 33,000 SNP markers we identified rice genomic regions associated to early stage salinity tolerance. Eight salinity-related traits including shoot length (SL), root length (RL), root dry weight (RDW), root fresh weight (RFW), shoot fresh weight (SFW), shoot dry weight (SDW), relative water content (RWC) and TW, and 4 derived traits including SL-R, RL-R, RDW-R and RFW-R in a diverse panel of rice were evaluated under salinity (100 mM NaCl) and normal conditions in growth chamber. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was applied based on MLM(+Q + K) model.  Results: Under stress conditions 151 trait-marker associations were identified that were scattered on 10 chromosomes of rice that arranged in 29 genomic regions. A genomic region on chromosome 1 (11.26 Mbp) was identified which co-located with a known QTL region SalTol1 for salinity tolerance at vegetative stage. A candidate gene (Os01g0304100) was identified in this region which encodes a cation chloride cotransporter. Furthermore, on this chromosome two other candidate genes, Os01g0624700 (24.95 Mbp) and Os01g0812000 (34.51 Mbp), were identified that encode a WRKY transcription factor (WRKY 12) and a transcriptional activator of gibberellin-dependent alpha-amylase expression (GAMyb), respectively. Also, a narrow interval on the same chromosome (40.79-42.98 Mbp) carries 12 candidate genes, some of them were not so far reported for salinity tolerance at seedling stage. Two of more interesting genes are Os01g0966000 and Os01g0963000, encoding a plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase and a peroxidase BP1 protein. A candidate gene was identified on chromosome 2 (Os02g0730300 at 30.4 Mbp) encoding a high affinity K+ transporter (HAK). On chromosome 6 a DnaJ-encoding gene and pseudouridine synthase gene were identified. Two novel genes on chromosome 8 including the ABI/VP1 transcription factor and retinoblastoma-related protein (RBR), and 3 novel genes on chromosome 11 including a Lox, F-box and Na+/H+ antiporter, were also identified.  Conclusion: Known or novel candidate genes in this research were identified that can be used for improvement of salinity tolerance in molecular breeding programmes of rice. Further study and identification of effective genes on salinity tolerance by the use of candidate gene-association analysis can help to precisely uncover the mechanisms of salinity tolerance at molecular level. A time dependent relationship between salt tolerance and expression level of candidate genes could be recognized.
NA	The leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase OsERL plays a critical role in anther lobe formation in rice	2021	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.	In Arabidopsis, ERECTA (ER) subfamily of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) play important roles in cell division and cell elongation. However, the functions of OsER genes in rice are still very much unknown. In this study, sixty-seven TILLING and four gene-edited mutants were identified for one of the three OsERs, OsERL, and used for functional analyses. Results showed that mutations in OsERL led to striking defects in anther development. Compete male sterility and reduced numbers of anther lobes, more severe than knockout mutants, were observed in mutants with amino acid substitutions in the kinase domain. Among alleles with amino acid changes in LRRs, only one mutation in the 16th LRR showed evident phenotype, suggesting a role of the LRR in ligand sensing. OsERL is expressed in shoot apcies, internodes and anthers, and within the anther OsERL is expressed in sporophytic and tapetal cells. Cell biological analyses revealed that mutations in OsERL led to defected periclinal division in archesporial cells in anthers, suggesting a critical role of OsERL in rice anther development.
