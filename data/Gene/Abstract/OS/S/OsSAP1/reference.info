Stress-associated proteins (SAPs), containing A20/AN1 zinc-finger domains, confer abiotic stress tolerance in different plants, however, their interacting partners and downstream targets remain to be identified. * In this study, we have investigated the subcellular interactions of rice SAPs and their interacting partner using yeast two-hybrid and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approaches. Their efficacy in improving abiotic stress tolerance was analysed in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Regulation of gene expression by genome-wide microarray in transgenics was used to identify downstream targets. * It was found that the A20 domain mediates the interaction of OsSAP1 with self, its close homolog OsSAP11 and a rice receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, OsRLCK253. Such interactions between OsSAP1/11 and with OsRLCK253 occur at nuclear membrane, plasma membrane and in nucleus. Functionally, both OsSAP11 and OsRLCK253 could improve the water-deficit and salt stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants via a signaling pathway affecting the expression of several common endogenous genes. * Components of a novel stress-responsive pathway have been identified. Their stress-inducible expression provided the protection against yield loss in transgenic plants, indicating the agronomic relevance of OsSAP11 and OsRLCK253 in conferring abiotic stress tolerance.
NA	OsPAP26 encodes a major purple acid phosphatase and regulates phosphate remobilization in rice.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, P. R. China.	During phosphate (Pi) starvation or leaf senescence, the accumulation of intracellular and extracellular purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) increases in plants in order to scavenge organic phosphorus (P). In this study, we demonstrated that a PAP encoding gene in rice, OsPAP26, is constitutively expressed in all tissues. While the abundance of OsPAP26 transcript is not affected by Pi supply, it is upregulated during leaf senescence. Furthermore, Pi deprivation and leaf senescence greatly increased the abundance of OsPAP26 protein. Overexpression or RNA interference (RNAi) of OsPAP26 in transgenic rice significantly increased or reduced APase activities in leaves, roots and growth medium, respectively. Compared with wild type (WT) plants, Pi concentrations of OsPAP26-overexpressing plants increased in the non-senescing leaves and decreased in the senescing leaves. The increased remobilization of Pi from the senescing leaves to non-senescing leaves in the OsPAP26-overexpressing plants resulted in better growth performance when plants were grown in Pi depleted condition. In contrast, OsPAP26-RNAi plants retained more Pi in the senescing leaves, and were more sensitive to Pi-starvation stress. OsPAP26 was found to localize to the apoplast of rice cells. Western blot analysis of protein extracts from callus growth medium confirmed that OsPAP26 is a secreted PAP. OsPAP26-overexpressing plants were capable of converting more ATP into inorganic Pi in the growth medium, which further supported the potential role of OsPAP26 in utilizing organic P in rhizosphere. In summary, we concluded that OsPAP26 perform dual functions in plants: Pi remobilization from senescing to non-senescing leaves and organic P utilization.
