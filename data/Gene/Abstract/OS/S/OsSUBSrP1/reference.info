INTRODUCTION: Panicle abortion is a severe physiological defect and causes a reduction in grain yield. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aim to provide the characterization and functional analysis of a mutant apa1331 (apical panicle abortion1331). METHODS: The isolated mutant from an EMS-mutagenized population was subjected to SSR analysis and Mutmap assay for candidate gene mapping. We performed phenotypic analysis, anthers cross-sections morphology, wax and cutin profiling, biochemical assays and phylogenetic analysis for characterization and evaluation of apa1331. We used CRISPR/Cas9 disruption for functional validation of its candidate gene. Furthermore, comparative RNA-seq and relative expression analysis were performed to get further insights into mechanistic role of the candidate gene. RESULTS: The anthers from the apical spikelets of apa1331 were degenerated, pollen-less and showed defects in cuticle formation. Transverse sections of apa1331 anthers showed defects in post-meiotic microspore development at stage 8-9. Gas Chromatography showed a significant reduction of wax and cutin in anthers of apa1331 compared to Wildtype (WT). Quantification of H(2)O(2) and MDA has indicated the excessive ROS (reactive oxygen species) in apa1331. Trypan blue staining and TUNEL assay revealed cell death and excessive DNA fragmentation in apa1331. Map-based cloning and Mutmap analysis revealed that LOC_Os04g40720, encoding a putative SUBTILISIN-LIKE SERINE PROTEASE (OsSUBSrP1), harbored an SNP (A &gt; G) in apa1331. Phenotypic defects were only seen in apical spikelets due to highest expression of OsSUBSrP1 in upper panicle portion. CRISPR-mediated knock-out lines of OsSUBSrP1 displayed spikelet abortion comparable to apa1331. Global gene expression analysis revealed a significant downregulation of wax and cutin biosynthesis genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports the novel role of SUBSrP1 in anther cuticle biosynthesis by ROS-mediated programmed cell death in rice.
