OsSUBSrP1	spikelet	A putative SUBTILISIN-LIKE SERINE PROTEASE 1 (SUBSrP1) regulates anther cuticle biosynthesis and panicle development in rice.	 CRISPR-mediated knock-out lines of OsSUBSrP1 displayed spikelet abortion comparable to apa1331
OsSUBSrP1	panicle	A putative SUBTILISIN-LIKE SERINE PROTEASE 1 (SUBSrP1) regulates anther cuticle biosynthesis and panicle development in rice.	 Phenotypic defects were only seen in apical spikelets due to highest expression of OsSUBSrP1 in upper panicle portion
