OsSIDP301	 We found that overexpression of OsSIDP301 (OE) in plants conferred salt hypersensitivity and reduced grain size, whereas plants with OsSIDP301 RNA interference (RNAi) exhibited salt tolerance and increased grain size in rice |  Our findings reveal that OsSIDP301 functions as a negative regulator of salt stress and grain size, and repressing its expression represents a promising strategy for improving salt stress tolerance and yield in rice	 We found that overexpression of OsSIDP301 (OE) in plants conferred salt hypersensitivity and reduced grain size, whereas plants with OsSIDP301 RNA interference (RNAi) exhibited salt tolerance and increased grain size in rice	 We found that overexpression of OsSIDP301 (OE) in plants conferred salt hypersensitivity and reduced grain size, whereas plants with OsSIDP301 RNA interference (RNAi) exhibited salt tolerance and increased grain size in rice
