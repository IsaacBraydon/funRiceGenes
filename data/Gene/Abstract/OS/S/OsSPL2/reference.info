NA	Hydrogen peroxide regulates the Osa-miR156-OsSPL2/OsTIFY11b module in rice.	2023	Plant Cell Environ	Institute of Plant Biology and Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.	Field-grown rice (Oryza sativa L.), when exposed to various environmental stresses, produces high amounts of reactive oxygen species, such as H(2) O(2) . MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in plant stress responses. This study characterized the functions of H(2) O(2) -regulated miRNAs in rice. Small RNA deep sequencing revealed that miR156 levels decreased following H(2) O(2) treatment. Searches of the rice transcriptome and degradome databases indicated that OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b are miR156-target genes. Interactions between miR156 and OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b were confirmed using transient expression assays through agroinfiltration. In addition, the levels of OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b transcripts were lower in transgenic rice plants overexpressing miR156 than in wild-type plants. The OsSPL2-GFP and OsTIFY11b-GFP proteins were localized to the nucleus. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays indicated interactions between OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b. Furthermore, OsTIFY11b interacted with OsMYC2 to regulate the expression of OsRBBI3-3, which encodes a proteinase inhibitor. The results suggested that H(2) O(2) accumulation in rice suppresses the expression of miR156, and induces the expression of its target genes, OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b, whose proteins interact in the nucleus to regulate the expression of OsRBBI3-3, which is involved in plant defense.
