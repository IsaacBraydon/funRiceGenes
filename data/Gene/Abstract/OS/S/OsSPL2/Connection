miR156	OsSPL2	Hydrogen peroxide regulates the Osa-miR156-OsSPL2/OsTIFY11b module in rice.	 Interactions between miR156 and OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b were confirmed using transient expression assays through agroinfiltration
miR156	OsSPL2	Hydrogen peroxide regulates the Osa-miR156-OsSPL2/OsTIFY11b module in rice.	 In addition, the levels of OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b transcripts were lower in transgenic rice plants overexpressing miR156 than in wild-type plants
miR156	OsSPL2	Hydrogen peroxide regulates the Osa-miR156-OsSPL2/OsTIFY11b module in rice.	 The results suggested that H(2) O(2) accumulation in rice suppresses the expression of miR156, and induces the expression of its target genes, OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b, whose proteins interact in the nucleus to regulate the expression of OsRBBI3-3, which is involved in plant defense
