HOS59	OsSPL13	KNOX II transcription factor HOS59 functions in regulating rice grain size.	 Meanwhile, our IP-MS datasets showed that HOS59 was closely associated with BELL family proteins, some grain size regulators (OsSPL13, OsSPL16, OsSPL18, SLG, etc
HOS59	OsSPL13	KNOX II transcription factor HOS59 functions in regulating rice grain size.	 The qRT-PCR results showed that mutation of the HOS59 gene led to upregulation of some grain size-related genes such as OsSPL13, OsSPL18, and PGL2
