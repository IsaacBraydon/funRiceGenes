SIMILAR TO RCD ONE (SRO) is a plant-specific gene family involved in development and abiotic stress responses. SRO proteins are characterized by containing poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase catalytic (PARP) and C-terminal RCD1-SRO-TAF4 domains, and can be classified into two groups and five subgroups on the basis of their PARP domain. Expression analysis of rice SRO genes in response to various abiotic stresses showed that OsSRO1c, a rice SRO gene which functions downstream of the stress-responsive transcription factor SNAC1, is the major stress-responsive gene in the rice SRO family. The ossro1c-1 mutant showed resistance not only to chloroplastic oxidative stress, but also to apoplastic oxidative stress. However, the ossro1c-1 mutant and artificial microRNA-OsSRO1c transgenic rice were significantly impaired in cold tolerance. When compared with the well-characterized Arabidopsis SRO protein radical-induced cell death 1 (RCD1), OsSRO1c has considerable variation in the protein sequence, and the two genes exhibit different expression profiles under abiotic stresses. Furthermore, ossro1c-1 and rcd1 showed different responses to multiple abiotic stresses. By screening an Arabidopsis transcription factor library, 29 transcription factors interacted with OsSRO1c in yeast, but only two of these transcription factors were reported to interact with RCD1, which may partly explain the different responses of the two mutants under various stresses. The data presented in this report provide important clues for further elucidating the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of OsSRO1c in mediating responses to multiple abiotic stresses.
ers349.pdf	The SNAC1-targeted gene OsSRO1c modulates stomatal closure and oxidative stress tolerance by regulating hydrogen peroxide in rice	2013	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Abiotic stresses such as drought cause a reduction of plant growth and loss of crop yield. Stomatal aperture controls CO(2) uptake and water loss to the atmosphere, thus playing important roles in both the yield gain and drought tolerance of crops. Here, a rice homologue of SRO (similar to RCD one), termed OsSRO1c, was identified as a direct target gene of SNAC1 (stress-responsive NAC 1) involved in the regulation of stomatal aperture and oxidative response. SNAC1 could bind to the promoter of OsSRO1c and activate the expression of OsSRO1c. OsSRO1c was induced in guard cells by drought stress. The loss-of-function mutant of OsSRO1c showed increased stomatal aperture and sensitivity to drought, and faster water loss compared with the wild-type plant, whereas OsSRO1c overexpression led to decreased stomatal aperture and reduced water loss. Interestingly, OsSRO1c-overexpressing rice showed increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Expression of DST, a reported zinc finger gene negatively regulating H(2)O(2)-induced stomatal closure, and the activity of H(2)O(2)-scavenging related enzymes were significantly suppressed, and H(2)O(2) in guard cells was accumulated in the overexpression lines. OsSRO1c interacted with various stress-related regulatory and functional proteins, and some of the OsSRO1c-interacting proteins are predicted to be involved in the control of stomatal aperture and oxidative stress tolerance. The results suggest that OsSRO1c has dual roles in drought and oxidative stress tolerance of rice by promoting stomatal closure and H(2)O(2) accumulation through a novel pathway involving regulators SNAC1 and DST.
NA	A common wild rice-derived BOC1 allele reduces callus browning in indica rice transformation.	2020	Nat Commun	MOE Key Laboratory of Crop Heterosis and Utilization, National Center for Evaluation of Agricultural Wild Plants (Rice), Beijing Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Department of Plant Genetics and Breeding, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.	Callus browning, a common trait derived from the indica rice cultivar (Oryza sativa L.), is a challenge to transformation regeneration. Here, we report the map-based cloning of BROWNING OF CALLUS1 (BOC1) using a population derived from crossing Teqing, an elite indica subspecies exhibiting callus browning, and Yuanjiang, a common wild rice accession (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) that is less susceptible to callus browning. We show that BOC1 encodes a SIMILAR TO RADICAL-INDUCED CELL DEATH ONE (SRO) protein. Callus browning can be reduced by appropriate upregulation of BOC1, which consequently improves the genetic transformation efficiency. The presence of a Tourist-like miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (Tourist MITE) specific to wild rice in the promoter of BOC1 increases the expression of BOC1 in callus. BOC1 may decrease cell senescence and death caused by oxidative stress. Our study provides a<U+00A0>gene target for improving tissue culturability and genetic transformation.
