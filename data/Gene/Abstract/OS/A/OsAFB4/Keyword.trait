OsAFB4	auxin	Functional analysis of auxin receptor OsTIR1/OsAFB family members in rice grain yield, tillering, plant height, root system, germination, and auxinic herbicide resistance	 Notably, only the Osafb4 mutants were strongly resistant to herbicide picloram, suggesting that OsAFB4 is a unique auxin receptor in rice
