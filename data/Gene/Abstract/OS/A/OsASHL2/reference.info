COMPASS or COMPASS-like is a highly conserved polyprotein complex in eukaryotes that is often involved in methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4). However, the biological function of this complex in rice (Oryza sativa) is unclear. Here, we report the identifiction of their functions in growth and development. The osashl1 osashl2 double mutant shows a dwarf and late-flowering phenotype. Lower expression of Ehd1, OsVIL4, and OsMADS51 in the osashl1 osashl2 double mutant background accompanies a delayed vegetative growth phase and photoperiod-sensitive phase compared with that in wild type. Notably, there is and trimethylation genome-wide in the double mutant, in particular less H3K4 trimethylation at OsVIL4. Consistent with this result, knockout of OsVIL4 gives rise to a late-flowering phenotype similar to that of the osashl1 osashl2 double mutant, suggesting that OsVIL4 is a target of the COMPASS-like complex. In addition, the expression of key genes in brassinosteroid and gibberellic acid metabolism is altered in the osashl1 osashl2 double mutant, suggesting that the COMPASS-like complex regulates plant growth and development by modulating the levels of these two phytohormones. In summary, we demonstrate that OsASHL1 and OsASHL2 are important for floral transition and plant development.
