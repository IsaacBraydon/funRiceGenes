OsATL15	leaf	An amino acid transporter-like protein (OsATL15) facilitates the systematic distribution of thiamethoxam in rice for controlling the brown planthopper.	 OsATL15 was localized in rice cell membrane and abundant in the root transverse sections, vascular bundles of leaf blade, and stem longitudinal sections, but not in hull and brown rice at filling stages
