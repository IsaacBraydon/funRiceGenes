OsACS4	SD38	A very-long-chain fatty acid synthesis gene, SD38, influences plant height by activating ethylene biosynthesis in rice.	 Exogenously supplied VLCFA (C24:0) increased the expression levels of OsACS3, OsACS4, and OsACO7 and the plant height of sd38 mutant seedlings, similar to the effect of exogenous application of ACC and ethephon
