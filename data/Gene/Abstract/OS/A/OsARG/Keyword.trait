OsARG	mitochondria	OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice	 The OsARG protein was localized in the mitochondria, consistent with other arginases
OsARG	grain	OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice	OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice
OsARG	nitrogen	OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice	 The phenotype was partially corrected supplying exogenous nitrogen, and fully corrected by a wild type OsARG transgene| Our results suggest that the arginase encoded by OsARG, a key enzyme in Arg catabolism, plays a critical role during panicle development, especially under conditions of insufficient exogenous nitrogen
OsARG	panicle	OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice	 OsARG, ubiquitously expressed in various organs, was more strongly expressed in the developing panicles| Our results suggest that the arginase encoded by OsARG, a key enzyme in Arg catabolism, plays a critical role during panicle development, especially under conditions of insufficient exogenous nitrogen|OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice
