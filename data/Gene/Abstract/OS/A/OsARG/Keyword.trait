OsARG	mitochondria	OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice	The OsARG protein was localized in the mitochondria, consistent with other arginases
OsARG	grain	OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice	OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice
OsARG	nitrogen	OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice	The phenotype was partially corrected supplying exogenous nitrogen, and fully corrected by a wild type OsARG transgene
OsARG	nitrogen	OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice	Our results suggest that the arginase encoded by OsARG, a key enzyme in Arg catabolism, plays a critical role during panicle development, especially under conditions of insufficient exogenous nitrogen
OsARG	panicle	OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice	OsARG, ubiquitously expressed in various organs, was more strongly expressed in the developing panicles
OsARG	panicle	OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice	Our results suggest that the arginase encoded by OsARG, a key enzyme in Arg catabolism, plays a critical role during panicle development, especially under conditions of insufficient exogenous nitrogen
OsARG	panicle	OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice	OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice
OsARG	seedlings	Expression of the Rice Arginase Gene OsARG in Cotton Influences the Morphology and Nitrogen Transition of Seedlings.	The nitric oxide content and the morphology of ARG-26 and ARG-38 seedlings were both affected by expression of the OsARG gene
OsARG	nitrogen	Expression of the Rice Arginase Gene OsARG in Cotton Influences the Morphology and Nitrogen Transition of Seedlings.	Expression of the Rice Arginase Gene OsARG in Cotton Influences the Morphology and Nitrogen Transition of Seedlings.
OsARG	nitrogen	Expression of the Rice Arginase Gene OsARG in Cotton Influences the Morphology and Nitrogen Transition of Seedlings.	The unique rice arginase gene OsARG is known to affect nitrogen use efficiency and is also associated with higher yields in rice
