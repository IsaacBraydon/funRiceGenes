Ghd2	OsARID3	Ghd2, a CONSTANS-like gene, confers drought sensitivity through regulation of senescence in rice.	 Ghd2 interacted with several regulatory proteins, including OsARID3, OsPURα, and three 14-3-3 proteins
Ghd2	OsARID3	Ghd2, a CONSTANS-like gene, confers drought sensitivity through regulation of senescence in rice.	 OsARID3 and OsPURα showed expression patterns similar to Ghd2 in rice leaves, with the highest levels at the grain-filling stage, whereas OsARID3 and the 14-3-3 genes responded differently to drought stress conditions
