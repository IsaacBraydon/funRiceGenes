NA	Subcellular localization of rice acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) indicates that OsACBP6::GFP is targeted to the peroxisomes.	2014	New Phytol	School of Biological Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China; College of Life Science, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China.	Acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) show conservation at the acyl-CoA-binding (ACB) domain which facilitates binding to acyl-CoA esters. In Arabidopsis thaliana, six ACBPs participate in development and stress responses. Rice (Oryza sativa) also contains six genes encoding ACBPs. We investigated differences in subcellular localization between monocot rice and eudicot A. thaliana ACBPs. The subcellular localization of the six OsACBPs was achieved via transient expression of green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusions in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) epidermal cells, and stable transformation of A. thaliana. As plant ACBPs had not been reported in the peroxisomes, OsACBP6::GFP localization was confirmed by transient expression in rice sheath cells. The function of OsACBP6 was investigated by overexpressing 35S::OsACBP6 in the peroxisomal abc transporter1 (pxa1) mutant defective in peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation. As predicted, OsACBP1::GFP and OsACBP2::GFP were localized to the cytosol, and OsACBP4::GFP and OsACBP5::GFP to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, OsACBP3::GFP displayed subcellular multi-localization while OsACBP6::GFP was localized to the peroxisomes. 35S::OsACBP6-OE/pxa1 lines showed recovery in indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) peroxisomal β-oxidation, wound-induced VEGETATIVE STORAGE PROTEIN1 (VSP1) expression and jasmonic acid (JA) accumulation. These findings indicate a role for OsACBP6 in peroxisomal β-oxidation, and suggest that rice ACBPs are involved in lipid degradation in addition to lipid biosynthesis.
NA	Rice acyl-CoA-binding proteins OsACBP4 and OsACBP5 are differentially localized in the endoplasmic reticulum of transgenic Arabidopsis.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	a School of Biological Sciences; The University of Hong Kong; Pokfulam, Hong Kong, PR China.	Acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) are known to bind and transport acyl-CoA esters and phospholipids intracellularly. In our recent paper in the New Phytologist, we reported that the six acyl-CoA-binding proteins (OsACBPs) in rice (Oryza sativa) are distributed across various subcellular compartments in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) such as the cytosol (OsACBP1, OsACBP2 and OsACBP3), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) including the tubules (OsACBP4 and OsACBP5) and the cisternae (OsACBP4), and the peroxisomes (OsACBP6). Localization of OsACBP4::GFP to the peripheral ER cisternae and the central cisternal ER-like structures in transgenic Arabidopsis distinguished it from OsACBP5::GFP. We further report that besides the ER, OsACBP4::GFP and OsACBP5::GFP were also targeted to the membrane of ER bodies and ER-derived spherical structures, respectively, in transgenic Arabidopsis. These findings support our previous conclusion that OsACBP4 and OsACBP5 are not redundant proteins in the ER.
NA	The overexpression of OsACBP5 protects transgenic rice against necrotrophic, hemibiotrophic and biotrophic pathogens	2020	Sci Rep	School of Biological Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China.	The most devastating diseases in rice (Oryza sativa) are sheath blight caused by the fungal necrotroph Rhizoctonia solani, rice blast by hemibiotrophic fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, and leaf blight by bacterial biotroph Xanthomonas oryzae (Xoo). It has been reported that the Class III acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) such as those from dicots (Arabidopsis and grapevine) play a role in defence against biotrophic pathogens. Of the six Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ACBPs, AtACBP3 conferred protection in transgenic Arabidopsis against Pseudomonas syringae, but not the necrotrophic fungus, Botrytis cinerea. Similar to Arabidopsis, rice possesses six ACBPs, designated OsACBPs. The aims of this study were to test whether OsACBP5, the homologue of AtACBP3, can confer resistance against representative necrotrophic, hemibiotrophic and biotrophic phytopathogens and to understand the mechanisms in protection. Herein, when OsACBP5 was overexpressed in rice, the OsACBP5-overexpressing (OsACBP5-OE) lines exhibited enhanced disease resistance against representative necrotrophic (R. solani & Cercospora oryzae), hemibiotrophic (M. oryzae & Fusarium graminearum) and biotrophic (Xoo) phytopathogens. Progeny from a cross between OsACBP5-OE9 and the jasmonate (JA)-signalling deficient mutant were more susceptible than the wild type to infection by the necrotroph R. solani. In contrast, progeny from a cross between OsACBP5-OE9 and the salicylic acid (SA)-signalling deficient mutant was more susceptible to infection by the hemibiotroph M. oryzae and biotroph Xoo. Hence, enhanced resistance of OsACBP5-OEs against representative necrotrophs appears to be JA-dependent whilst that to (hemi)biotrophs is SA-mediated.
