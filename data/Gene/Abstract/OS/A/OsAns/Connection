OsAns	OsDfr	Rice flavonoid pathway genes, OsDfr and OsAns, are induced by dehydration, high salt and ABA, and contain stress responsive promoter elements that interact with the transcription activator, OsC1-MYB	 The role of the regulatory gene OsC1-Myb, encoding a MYB class of transcription activators in the stress-induced expression of the structural genes, OsDfr and OsAns, was analyzed
OsAns	OsDfr	Rice flavonoid pathway genes, OsDfr and OsAns, are induced by dehydration, high salt and ABA, and contain stress responsive promoter elements that interact with the transcription activator, OsC1-MYB	 indica) seedlings under dehydration stress or high salt or abscisic acid (ABA) showed a significant enhancement of transcript level and/or transcript stability of OsDfr and OsAns
OsAns	OsDfr	Rice flavonoid pathway genes, OsDfr and OsAns, are induced by dehydration, high salt and ABA, and contain stress responsive promoter elements that interact with the transcription activator, OsC1-MYB	 The expression pattern of these three genes indicates that the stress responsive accumulation of OsDfr and OsAns transcripts is mediated by the transcription factor, OsC1-MYB
OsAns	OsDfr	Rice flavonoid pathway genes, OsDfr and OsAns, are induced by dehydration, high salt and ABA, and contain stress responsive promoter elements that interact with the transcription activator, OsC1-MYB	 The 5' upstream region of the OsDfr and OsAns genes carry several regulatory domains, which share homology with some of the known stress responsive genes in plants
OsAns	OsDfr	Rice flavonoid pathway genes, OsDfr and OsAns, are induced by dehydration, high salt and ABA, and contain stress responsive promoter elements that interact with the transcription activator, OsC1-MYB	 In addition, several putative myb and myc responsive domains were identified in the promoter region of the genes, OsDfr and OsAns
OsAns	OsDfr	Rice flavonoid pathway genes, OsDfr and OsAns, are induced by dehydration, high salt and ABA, and contain stress responsive promoter elements that interact with the transcription activator, OsC1-MYB	 The recombinant OsC1-MYB protein binds in vitro to the myb responsive elements (MREs) in the OsDfr and OsAns promoters, suggesting that it is a potential transcription activator of stress-induced expression of structural genes of the flavonoid pathway
OsAns	OsDfr	Rice flavonoid pathway genes, OsDfr and OsAns, are induced by dehydration, high salt and ABA, and contain stress responsive promoter elements that interact with the transcription activator, OsC1-MYB	Rice flavonoid pathway genes, OsDfr and OsAns, are induced by dehydration, high salt and ABA, and contain stress responsive promoter elements that interact with the transcription activator, OsC1-MYB
