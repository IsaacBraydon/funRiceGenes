The levels of RAmy3D and RAmy3E mRNAs in rice cultured cells are inversely related to the concentration of sugar in the culture medium. Other genes in the rice α-amylase gene family have little or no expression in cultured cells; these expression levels are not controlled by metabolic regulation. A RAmy3D promoter/GUS gene fusion was metabolically regulated in the transgenic rice cell line 3DG, just as the endogenous RAmy3D gene is regulated. An assay of GUS enzyme activity in 3DG cells demonstrated that RAmy3D/GUS expression is repressed when sugar is present in the culture medium and induced when sugar is removed from the medium. The 942 bp fragment of the RAmy3D promoter that was linked to the coding region of the GUS reporter gene thus contains all of the regulatory sequences necessary for metabolic regulation of the gene.

Rice has the unique ability to express alpha-amylase under anoxic conditions, a feature that is critical for successful anaerobic germination and growth. Previously, anaerobic conditions were shown to up-regulate the expression of Amy3 subfamily genes (Amy3B/C, 3D, and 3E) in rice embryos. These genes are known to be feedback regulated by the hydrolytic products of starchy endosperm such as the simple sugar glucose. It was found that oxygen deficiency interferes with the repression of Amy3D gene expression imposed by low concentrations of glucose but not with that imposed by higher amounts. This differential anoxic de-repression depending on sugar concentration suggests the presence of two distinct pathways for sugar regulation of Amy3D gene expression. Anoxic de-repression can be mimicked by treating rice embryos with inhibitors of ATP synthesis during respiration. Other sugar-regulated rice alpha-amylase genes, Amy3B/C and 3E, behave similarly to Amy3D. Treatment with a respiratory inhibitor or anoxia also relieved the sugar repression of the rice CIPK15 gene, a main upstream positive regulator of SnRK1A that is critical for Amy3D expression in response to sugar starvation. SnRK1A accumulation was previously shown to be required for MYBS1 expression, which transactivates Amy3D by binding to a cis-acting element found in the proximal region of all Amy3 subfamily gene promoters (the TA box). Taken together, these results suggest that prevention of oxidative phosphorylation by oxygen deficiency interferes with the sugar repression of Amy3 subfamily gene expression, leading to their enhanced expression in rice embryos during anaerobic germination.
j.1438-8677.2010.00415.x.pdf	Regulatory interplay of the Sub1A and CIPK15 pathways in the regulation of alpha-amylase production in flooded rice plants	2011	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Department of Crop Plant Biology, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) can successfully germinate and grow even when flooded. Rice varieties possessing the submergence 1A (Sub1A) gene display a distinct flooding-tolerant phenotype, associated with lower carbohydrate consumption and restriction of the fast-elongation phenotype typical of flooding-intolerant rice varieties. Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase 15 (CIPK15) was recently indicated as a key regulator of alpha-amylases under oxygen deprivation, linked to both rice germination and flooding tolerance in adult plants. It is still unknown whether the Sub1A- and CIPK15-mediated pathways act as complementary processes for rice survival under O(2) deprivation. In adult plants Sub1A and CIPK15 may perhaps play an antagonistic role in terms of carbohydrate consumption, with Sub1A acting as a starch degradation repressor and CIPK15 as an activator. In this study, we analysed sugar metabolism in the stem of rice plants under water submergence by selecting cultivars with different traits associated with flooding survival. The relation between the Sub1A and the CIPK15 pathways was investigated. The results show that under O(2) deprivation, the CIPK15 pathway is repressed in the tolerant, Sub1A-containing, FR13A variety. CIPK15 is likely to play a role in the up-regulation of Ramy3D in flooding-intolerant rice varieties that display fast elongation under flooding and that do not possess Sub1A.
nar00207-0253.pdf	Structural organization and differential expression of rice alpha-amylase genes	1990	Nucleic Acids Res	Department of Genetics, University of California, Davis 95616.	Rice alpha-amylases are encoded by a multigene family that has previously been classified into 5 hybridization groups. DNA sequence and Southern blot analysis identified three genes (RAmy1A, RAmy1B and RAmy1C) in Group 1 with DNA sequence identity of at least 90%. Hybridization Group 2 is represented by only one gene, RAmy3D, which is identical to a previously characterized cDNA, pOS137. RAmy3D is physically linked to the sole representative of Group 5, RAmy3E. The identity between these two genes is 81.4% in the coding region but less than 50% in the 5' and 3' flanking regions. Northern blot analysis and RNA-PCR were used to detect the expression of alpha-amylase genes in various tissues. Alpha-amylase mRNA was abundant in germinating seeds and callus. Some genes were also expressed at much lower levels in roots, young leaves and immature seeds. RAmy1A and RAmy3E were expressed in all tissues while RAmy3D was expressed in all tissues except the immature seeds. RAmy1B was weakly expressed only in callus. RAmy1A transcript was most abundant in the germinating seeds, while RAmy3D and RAmy3E transcripts were most abundant in callus and immature seeds, respectively.
Plant Cell-2007-Lu-2484-99.pdf	The SnRK1A protein kinase plays a key role in sugar signaling during germination and seedling growth of rice	2007	Plant Cell	Department of Life Sciences, National Central University, Jhongli City, Taoyuan County 320, Taiwan, Republic of China.	Sugars repress alpha-amylase expression in germinating embryos and cell cultures of rice (Oryza sativa) through a sugar response complex (SRC) in alpha-amylase gene promoters and its interacting transcription factor MYBS1. The Snf1 protein kinase is required for the derepression of glucose-repressible genes in yeast. In this study, we explored the role of the yeast Snf1 ortholog in rice, SnRK1, in sugar signaling and plant growth. Rice embryo transient expression assays indicated that SnRK1A and SnRK1B act upstream and relieve glucose repression of MYBS1 and alphaAmy3 SRC promoters. Both SnRK1s contain N-terminal kinase domains serving as activators and C-terminal regulatory domains as dominant negative regulators of SRC. The accumulation and activity of SnRK1A was regulated by sugars posttranscriptionally, and SnRK1A relieved glucose repression specifically through the TA box in SRC. A transgenic RNA interference approach indicated that SnRK1A is also necessary for the activation of MYBS1 and alphaAmy3 expression under glucose starvation. Two mutants of SnRK1s, snrk1a and snrk1b, were obtained, and the functions of both SnRK1s were further studied. Our studies demonstrated that SnRK1A is an important intermediate in the sugar signaling cascade, functioning upstream from the interaction between MYBS1 and alphaAmy3 SRC and playing a key role in regulating seed germination and seedling growth in rice.
PNAS-1998-Chan-6543-7.pdf	The 3' untranslated region of a ricea-amylase gene functions as a sugar-dependent mRNA stability determinant	1998	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taipei 11529, Taiwan, Republic of China.	In plants, sugar feedback regulation provides a mechanism for control of carbohydrate allocation and utilization among tissues and organs. The sugar repression of alpha-amylase gene expression in rice provides an ideal model for studying the mechanism of sugar feedback regulation. We have shown previously that sugar repression of alpha-amylase gene expression in rice suspension cells involves control of both transcription rate and mRNA stability. The alpha-amylase mRNA is significantly more stable in sucrose-starved cells than in sucrose-provided cells. To elucidate the mechanism of sugar-dependent mRNA turnover, we have examined the effect of alphaAmy3 3' untranslated region (UTR) on mRNA stability by functional analyses in transformed rice suspension cells. We found that the entire alphaAmy3 3' UTR and two of its subdomains can independently mediate sugar-dependent repression of reporter mRNA accumulation. Analysis of reporter mRNA half-lives demonstrated that the entire alphaAmy3 3' UTR and the two subdomains each functioned as a sugar-dependent destabilizing determinant in the turnover of mRNA. Nuclear run-on transcription analysis further confirmed that the alphaAmy3 3' UTR and the two subdomains did not affect the transcription rate of promoter. The identification of sequence elements in the alpha-amylase mRNA that dictate the differential stability has very important implications for the study of sugar-dependent mRNA decay mechanisms.

However, it has been a long-running debate as to whether alpha-amylases are localized in plastids where starch is stored. To study the subcellular localization of alpha-amylases in plant cells, a rice (Oryza sativa) alpha-amylase, alphaAmy3, with or without its own signal peptide (SP) was expressed in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and analyzed. Loss-of-function analyses revealed that SP was required for targeting of alphaAmy3 to chloroplasts and/or amyloplasts and cell walls and/or extracellular compartments of leaves and suspension cells. SP was also required for in vitro transcribed and/or translated alphaAmy3 to be cotranslationally imported and processed in canine microsomes. alphaAmy3, present in chloroplasts of transgenic tobacco leaves, was processed to a product with Mr similar to alphaAmy3 minus its SP. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the SP of chloroplast localized alphaAmy3 was cleaved at a site only one amino acid preceding the predicted cleavage site. Function of the alphaAmy3 SP was further studied by gain-of-function analyses. beta-Glucuronidase (GUS) and green fluorescence protein fused with or without the alphaAmy3 SP was expressed in transgenic tobacco or rice. The alphaAmy3 SP directed translocation of GUS and green fluorescence protein to chloroplasts and/or amyloplasts and cell walls in tobacco leaves and rice suspension cells. The SP of another rice alpha-amylase, alphaAmy8, similarly directed the dual localizations of GUS in transgenic tobacco leaves. This study is the first evidence of SP-dependent dual translocations of proteins to plastids and extracellular compartments, which provides new insights into the role of SP in protein targeting and the pathways of SP-dependent protein translocation in plants.
tpc1802326.pdf	Interaction between rice MYBGA and the gibberellin response element controls tissue-specific sugar sensitivity of alpha-amylase genes	2006	Plant Cell	Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taipei 115, Republic of China.	Expression of alpha-amylase genes during cereal grain germination and seedling growth is regulated negatively by sugar in embryos and positively by gibberellin (GA) in endosperm through the sugar response complex (SRC) and the GA response complex (GARC), respectively. We analyzed two alpha-amylase promoters, alphaAmy3 containing only SRC and alphaAmy8 containing overlapped SRC and GARC. alphaAmy3 was sugar-sensitive but GA-nonresponsive in both rice (Oryza sativa) embryos and endosperms, whereas alphaAmy8 was sugar-sensitive in embryos and GA-responsive in endosperms. Mutation of the GA response element (GARE) in the alphaAmy8 promoter impaired its GA response but enhanced sugar sensitivity, and insertion of GARE in the alphaAmy3 promoter rendered it GA-responsive but sugar-insensitive in endosperms. Expression of the GARE-interacting transcription factor MYBGA was induced by GA in endosperms, correlating with the endosperm-specific alphaAmy8 GA response. alphaAmy8 became sugar-sensitive in MYBGA knockout mutant endosperms, suggesting that the MYBGA-GARE interaction overrides the sugar sensitivity of alphaAmy8. In embryos overexpressing MYBGA, alphaAmy8 became sugar-insensitive, indicating that MYBGA affects sugar repression. alpha-Amylase promoters active in endosperms contain GARE, whereas those active in embryos may or may not contain GARE, confirming that the GARE and GA-induced MYBGA interaction prevents sugar feedback repression of endosperm alpha-amylase genes. We demonstrate that the MYBGA-GARE interaction affects sugar feedback control in balanced energy production during seedling growth and provide insight into the control mechanisms of tissue-specific regulation of alpha-amylase expression by sugar and GA signaling interference.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs004250050275.pdf	Sugar sensing and alpha-amylase gene repression in rice embryos	1998	Planta	Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan. b42295a@nucc.cc.nagoya-u.ac.jp	We used a transient expression system to study the mechanism by which carbohydrates repress a rice (Oryza sativa L.) alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) gene. Exogenously fed metabolizable carbohydrates are able to elicit repression of the alpha-amylase gene RAmy3D in the rice embryo, and our results indicate that repression is also triggered efficiently by endogenous carbohydrates. Glucose analogs that are taken up by plant cells but not phosphorylated by hexokinase are unable to repress the alpha-amylase gene studied, while 2-deoxyglucose, which is phosphorylable but not further metabolized, down-regulates RAmy3D promoter activity, indicating a role for hexokinase in the sugar-sensing mechanism triggering repression of the RAmy3D gene. We tested two different hexokinase inhibitors, mannoheptulose and glucosamine, but only the latter was able to relieve RAmy3D promoter activity from repression by endogenous carbohydrates. This correlates with the higher ability of glucosamine to inhibit the activity of rice hexokinases in vitro. The glucosamine-mediated relief of RAmy3D promoter activity from repression by endogenous carbohydrates does not correlate with a reduced rate of carbohydrate utilization.
