alphaAmy3|OsAmy3D|RAmy3D	OsMYBS1	Interference with oxidative phosphorylation enhances anoxic expression of rice alpha-amylase genes through abolishing sugar regulation	SnRK1A accumulation was previously shown to be required for MYBS1 expression, which transactivates Amy3D by binding to a cis-acting element found in the proximal region of all Amy3 subfamily gene promoters (the TA box)
alphaAmy3|OsAmy3D|RAmy3D	SnRK1A	Interference with oxidative phosphorylation enhances anoxic expression of rice alpha-amylase genes through abolishing sugar regulation	Treatment with a respiratory inhibitor or anoxia also relieved the sugar repression of the rice CIPK15 gene, a main upstream positive regulator of SnRK1A that is critical for Amy3D expression in response to sugar starvation

According to transient expression assays that used the promoter:luciferase fusion construct, OsHXK7 enhanced the glucose (Glc)-dependent repression of a rice Î±-amylase gene (RAmy3D) in the mesophyll protoplasts of maize, but its catalytically inactive mutant alleles did not
