OsABA8ox2|OsCYP707A6	OsABA8ox3	Glucose-induced delay of seed germination in rice is mediated by the suppression of ABA catabolism rather than an enhancement of ABA biosynthesis	Expression of OsABA8ox genes, especially OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3, was sensitively suppressed in the presence of exogenously supplied glucose
OsABA8ox2|OsCYP707A6	OsWRKY53	OsWRKY53 Promotes Abscisic Acid Accumulation to Accelerate Leaf Senescence and Inhibit Seed Germination by Downregulating Abscisic Acid Catabolic Genes in Rice.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation and protoplast transient assays revealed that OsWRKY53 directly bound to the promoters of OsABA8ox1 and OsABA8ox2 to repress their transcription, resulting in elevated endogenous ABA contents that promoted premature leaf senescence in the OsWRKY53-oe plants
OsABA8ox2|OsCYP707A6	OsABA8ox3	Improving pre-harvest sprouting resistance in rice by editing OsABA8ox using CRISPR/Cas9.	 There are three genes that encode ABA8&#x27; hydroxylase in rice, named OsABA8ox1, OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3
