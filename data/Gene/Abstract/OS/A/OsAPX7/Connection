GLO1|OsGLO1	OsAPX7	A synthetic light-inducible photorespiratory bypass enhances photosynthesis to improve rice growth and grain yield.	 To solve this bottleneck, here, we successfully developed a new synthetic photorespiratory bypass (called GMA bypass) in rice chloroplasts by introducing Oryza sativa glycolate oxidase 1 (OsGLO1), Cucurbita maxima malate synthase (CmMS), and Oryza sativa ascorbate peroxidase7 (OsAPX7) into rice genome using a high-efficiency transgene stacking system
