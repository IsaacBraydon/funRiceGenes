We assayed the enzyme activity of recombinant OsAkalphaGal with different natural substrates and examined the effect of ectopic OsAkalphaGal expression in rice plants. Recombinant OsAkalphaGal showed at least a two-fold greater substrate-binding affinity and a 10-fold greater turnover rate to galactolipid digalactosyl diacylglycerol than the raffinose family of oligosaccharides (verbascose, stachyose, raffinose) and melibiose. The OsAkalphaGal null mutant (osakalphagal) displayed a delayed leaf senescence phenotype. OsAkalphaGal complementation in osakalphagal recovered OsAkalphaGal expression and showed a senescence phenotype similar to that of wild-type plants. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsAkalphaGal (UbiP-OsAkalphaGal) exhibited retarded plant growth and development, and showed a pale-green phenotype coupled with a reduced chlorophyll content to 42% in newly unfolded leaves. UbiP-OsAkalphaGal leaves also showed a 29-fold increase in alkaline alpha-galactosidase activity compared with wild-type leaves. An ultrastructural study of Ubi-OsAkalphaGal chloroplasts in newly unfolded leaves revealed abnormal grana organization. Our findings strongly suggest that OsAkalphaGal is a thylakoid membrane-degrading enzyme involved in the degradation of digalactosyl diacylglycerol during rice leaf senescence.
NA	A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.	2004	Plant Mol Biol	Institute of Botany, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.	We previously isolated and identified numerous senescence-associated genes (SAGs) in rice leaves. Here we characterized the structure and function of an SAG- Osh69 encoding alkaline alpha-galactosidase that belongs to a novel family of glycosyl hydrolases. Osh69 is a single-copy gene composed of 13 exons located on rice chromosome 8. The expression level of Osh69 is not only up-regulated during natural leaf senescence but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones (methyl jasmonic acid, salicylic acid), and stresses (H2O2 and wounding). The recombinant Osh69 protein over-expressed in Escherichia coli has displayed optimal alpha-galactosidase activity at pH 8.0. The enzyme showed good hydrolytic activities towards alpha-1,6-galactosyl oligosaccharides and galactolipid digalactosyl diacylglycerol. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis demonstrates that Osh69 is specifically localized in the chloroplasts of senescing leaves. These findings strongly suggest an important role for Osh69 in the degradation of chloroplast galactolipids during leaf senescence.
