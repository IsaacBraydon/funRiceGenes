We assayed the enzyme activity of recombinant OsAkalphaGal with different natural substrates and examined the effect of ectopic OsAkalphaGal expression in rice plants. Recombinant OsAkalphaGal showed at least a two-fold greater substrate-binding affinity and a 10-fold greater turnover rate to galactolipid digalactosyl diacylglycerol than the raffinose family of oligosaccharides (verbascose, stachyose, raffinose) and melibiose. The OsAkalphaGal null mutant (osakalphagal) displayed a delayed leaf senescence phenotype. OsAkalphaGal complementation in osakalphagal recovered OsAkalphaGal expression and showed a senescence phenotype similar to that of wild-type plants. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsAkalphaGal (UbiP-OsAkalphaGal) exhibited retarded plant growth and development, and showed a pale-green phenotype coupled with a reduced chlorophyll content to 42% in newly unfolded leaves. UbiP-OsAkalphaGal leaves also showed a 29-fold increase in alkaline alpha-galactosidase activity compared with wild-type leaves. An ultrastructural study of Ubi-OsAkalphaGal chloroplasts in newly unfolded leaves revealed abnormal grana organization. Our findings strongly suggest that OsAkalphaGal is a thylakoid membrane-degrading enzyme involved in the degradation of digalactosyl diacylglycerol during rice leaf senescence.
NA	A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.	2004	Plant Mol Biol	Institute of Botany, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.	We previously isolated and identified numerous senescence-associated genes (SAGs) in rice leaves. Here we characterized the structure and function of an SAG- Osh69 encoding alkaline alpha-galactosidase that belongs to a novel family of glycosyl hydrolases. Osh69 is a single-copy gene composed of 13 exons located on rice chromosome 8. The expression level of Osh69 is not only up-regulated during natural leaf senescence but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones (methyl jasmonic acid, salicylic acid), and stresses (H2O2 and wounding). The recombinant Osh69 protein over-expressed in Escherichia coli has displayed optimal alpha-galactosidase activity at pH 8.0. The enzyme showed good hydrolytic activities towards alpha-1,6-galactosyl oligosaccharides and galactolipid digalactosyl diacylglycerol. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis demonstrates that Osh69 is specifically localized in the chloroplasts of senescing leaves. These findings strongly suggest an important role for Osh69 in the degradation of chloroplast galactolipids during leaf senescence.
NA	Mutation of OsNaPRT1 in the NAD Salvage Pathway Leads to Withered Leaf Tips in Rice	2016	Plant Physiology	China National Rice Research Institute CITY: Hangzhou POSTAL_CODE: 311400 China	Premature leaf senescence affects plant growth and yield in rice. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) plays critical roles in cellular redox reactions and remains at a sufficient level in the cell to prevent cell death. Although numerous factors affecting leaf senescence have been identified, few involving NAD biosynthetic pathways have been described for plants. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of Leaf Tip Senescence 1 (LTS1) in rice (Oryza sativa), a recessive mutation in the gene encoding O. sativa nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (OsNaPRT1) in the NAD salvage pathway. A point mutation in OsNaPRT1 leads to dwarfism and the withered leaf tip phenotype, and the lts1 mutant displays early leaf senescence compared to the wild type. Leaf nicotinate and nicotinamide contents are elevated in lts1, while NAD levels are reduced. Leaf tissue of lts1 exhibited significant DNA fragmentation and H2O2 accumulation, along with up-regulation of genes associated with senescence. The lts1 mutant also showed reduced expression of SIR2-like genes (OsSRT1 and OsSRT2) and increased acetylation of histone H3K9. Down-regulation of OsSRTs induced histone H3K9 acetylation of senescence-related genes. These results suggest that deficiency in the NAD salvage pathway can trigger premature leaf senescence due to transcriptional activation of senescence-related genes.
