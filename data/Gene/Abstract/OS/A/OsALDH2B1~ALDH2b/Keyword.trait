OsALDH2B1|ALDH2b	panicle	Organ-specific expressions and chromosomal locations of two mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.), ALDH2a and ALDH2b	 Northern blot and immunoblot analyses revealed that ALDH2b was constitutively present in all the organs examined, whereas ALDH2a was expressed in leaves of dark-grown seedlings and panicles
OsALDH2B1|ALDH2b	seedling	Organ-specific expressions and chromosomal locations of two mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.), ALDH2a and ALDH2b	 Northern blot and immunoblot analyses revealed that ALDH2b was constitutively present in all the organs examined, whereas ALDH2a was expressed in leaves of dark-grown seedlings and panicles
OsALDH2B1|ALDH2b	mitochondria	Organ-specific expressions and chromosomal locations of two mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.), ALDH2a and ALDH2b	 We suggest that the rice ALDH2a and ALDH2b genes are orthologues of maize mitochondrial ALDH genes, rf2b and rf2a, respectively|Organ-specific expressions and chromosomal locations of two mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.), ALDH2a and ALDH2b
