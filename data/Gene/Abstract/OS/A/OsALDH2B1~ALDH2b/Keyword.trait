OsALDH2b|OsALDH2B1|ALDH2b	panicle	Organ-specific expressions and chromosomal locations of two mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.), ALDH2a and ALDH2b	Northern blot and immunoblot analyses revealed that ALDH2b was constitutively present in all the organs examined, whereas ALDH2a was expressed in leaves of dark-grown seedlings and panicles
OsALDH2b|OsALDH2B1|ALDH2b	seedling	Organ-specific expressions and chromosomal locations of two mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.), ALDH2a and ALDH2b	Northern blot and immunoblot analyses revealed that ALDH2b was constitutively present in all the organs examined, whereas ALDH2a was expressed in leaves of dark-grown seedlings and panicles
OsALDH2b|OsALDH2B1|ALDH2b	mitochondria	Organ-specific expressions and chromosomal locations of two mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.), ALDH2a and ALDH2b	We suggest that the rice ALDH2a and ALDH2b genes are orthologues of maize mitochondrial ALDH genes, rf2b and rf2a, respectively
OsALDH2b|OsALDH2B1|ALDH2b	mitochondria	Organ-specific expressions and chromosomal locations of two mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.), ALDH2a and ALDH2b	Organ-specific expressions and chromosomal locations of two mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.), ALDH2a and ALDH2b
OsALDH2b|OsALDH2B1|ALDH2b	tapetum degeneration	The mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase OsALDH2b negatively regulates tapetum degeneration in rice.	The mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase OsALDH2b negatively regulates tapetum degeneration in rice.
OsALDH2b|OsALDH2B1|ALDH2b	programmed cell death	The mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase OsALDH2b negatively regulates tapetum degeneration in rice.	The mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase OsALDH2b negatively regulates tapetum degeneration in rice.
OsALDH2b|OsALDH2B1|ALDH2b	male reproductive development	The mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase OsALDH2b negatively regulates tapetum degeneration in rice.	These results demonstrate that OsALDH2b negatively regulates tapetal PCD and is required for male reproductive development, providing insights into the regulation of tapetum development in plants.
OsALDH2b|OsALDH2B1|ALDH2b	reproductive development	The mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase OsALDH2b negatively regulates tapetum degeneration in rice.	These results demonstrate that OsALDH2b negatively regulates tapetal PCD and is required for male reproductive development, providing insights into the regulation of tapetum development in plants.
