Recent studies have suggested that mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldehyde:NAD(P)(+) oxidoreductase, EC 1.2.1.3) (ALDH2) plays essential roles in pollen development in plants. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) ALDH2 is encoded by at least two ALDH2 genes, one of which (ALDH2a) was previously identified. In this study, to understand the roles of ALDH2 in rice, we isolated and characterized a cDNA clone encoding another rice ALDH2 (ALDH2b). An in vitro ALDH assay indicated that ALDH2b possesses an NAD(+)-linked activity for oxidation of acetaldehyde, glycolaldehyde and propionaldehyde. Northern blot and immunoblot analyses revealed that ALDH2b was constitutively present in all the organs examined, whereas ALDH2a was expressed in leaves of dark-grown seedlings and panicles. By RFLP linkage mapping, the ALDH2a and ALDH2b genes were mapped to the long arm of chromosome 2 and the short arm of chromosome 6, respectively. We suggest that the rice ALDH2a and ALDH2b genes are orthologues of maize mitochondrial ALDH genes, rf2b and rf2a, respectively.

The aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene superfamily encoding for NAD(P)(+)-dependent enzymes is found in all major plant and animal taxa. However, the characterization of plant ALDHs has lagged behind their animal- and prokaryotic-ALDH homologs. In plants, ALDHs are involved in abiotic stress tolerance, male sterility restoration, embryo development and seed viability and maturation. However, there is still no structural property-dependent functional characterization of ALDH protein superfamily in plants. In this paper, we identify members of the rice ALDH gene superfamily and use the evolutionary nesting events of retrotransposons and protein-modeling-based structural reconstitution to report the genetic and molecular and structural features of each member of the rice ALDH superfamily in abiotic/biotic stress responses and developmental processes. Our results indicate that rice-ALDHs are the most expanded plant ALDHs ever characterized. This work represents the first report of specific structural features mediating functionality of the whole families of ALDHs in an organism ever characterized.
