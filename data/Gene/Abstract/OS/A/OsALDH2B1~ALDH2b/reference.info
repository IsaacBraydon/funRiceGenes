Recent studies have suggested that mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldehyde:NAD(P)(+) oxidoreductase, EC 1.2.1.3) (ALDH2) plays essential roles in pollen development in plants. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) ALDH2 is encoded by at least two ALDH2 genes, one of which (ALDH2a) was previously identified. In this study, to understand the roles of ALDH2 in rice, we isolated and characterized a cDNA clone encoding another rice ALDH2 (ALDH2b). An in vitro ALDH assay indicated that ALDH2b possesses an NAD(+)-linked activity for oxidation of acetaldehyde, glycolaldehyde and propionaldehyde. Northern blot and immunoblot analyses revealed that ALDH2b was constitutively present in all the organs examined, whereas ALDH2a was expressed in leaves of dark-grown seedlings and panicles. By RFLP linkage mapping, the ALDH2a and ALDH2b genes were mapped to the long arm of chromosome 2 and the short arm of chromosome 6, respectively. We suggest that the rice ALDH2a and ALDH2b genes are orthologues of maize mitochondrial ALDH genes, rf2b and rf2a, respectively.

The aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene superfamily encoding for NAD(P)(+)-dependent enzymes is found in all major plant and animal taxa. However, the characterization of plant ALDHs has lagged behind their animal- and prokaryotic-ALDH homologs. In plants, ALDHs are involved in abiotic stress tolerance, male sterility restoration, embryo development and seed viability and maturation. However, there is still no structural property-dependent functional characterization of ALDH protein superfamily in plants. In this paper, we identify members of the rice ALDH gene superfamily and use the evolutionary nesting events of retrotransposons and protein-modeling-based structural reconstitution to report the genetic and molecular and structural features of each member of the rice ALDH superfamily in abiotic/biotic stress responses and developmental processes. Our results indicate that rice-ALDHs are the most expanded plant ALDHs ever characterized. This work represents the first report of specific structural features mediating functionality of the whole families of ALDHs in an organism ever characterized.
NA	The mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase OsALDH2b negatively regulates tapetum degeneration in rice.	2020	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, Guangzhou, China.	Timely degradation of anther tapetal cells is a prerequisite for normal pollen development in flowering plants. Although several genes involved in tapetum development have been identified, the molecular basis of tapetum degeneration regulation remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified and characterized the nucleus-encoded, conserved mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase OsALDH2b as a key regulator of tapetum degeneration in rice (Oryza sativa). OsALDH2b was highly expressed in anthers from meiosis to the early microspore stage. Mutation of OsALDH2b resulted in excess malonaldehyde (MDA) accumulation and earlier programmed cell death (PCD) in the tapetum, leading to premature tapetum degeneration and abnormal microspore development. These results demonstrate that OsALDH2b negatively regulates tapetal PCD and is required for male reproductive development, providing insights into the regulation of tapetum development in plants.
NA	The versatile functions of OsALDH2B1 provide a genic basis for growth-defense trade-offs in rice.	2020	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	In plants, enhanced defense often compromises growth and development, which is regarded as trade-offs between growth and defense. Here we identified a gene, OsALDH2B1, that functions as a master regulator of the growth-defense trade-off in rice. OsALDH2B1 has its primary function as an aldehyde dehydrogenase and a moonlight function as a transcriptional regulator. Loss of function of OsALDH2B1 greatly enhanced resistance to broad-spectrum pathogens, including fungal blast, bacterial leaf blight, and leaf streak, but caused severe phenotypic changes such as male sterility and reduced plant size, grain size, and number. We showed that its primary function as a mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase conditions male fertility. Its moonlight function of transcriptional regulation, featuring both repressing and activating activities, regulates a diverse range of biological processes involving brassinolide, G protein, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid signaling pathways. Such regulations cause large impacts on the morphology and immunity of rice plants. The versatile functions of OsALDH2B1 provide an example of the genic basis of growth-defense trade-offs in plants.
