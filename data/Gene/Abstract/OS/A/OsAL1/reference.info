NA	Albino Leaf 1 that Encodes the Sole Octotricopeptide Repeat Protein Is Responsible for Chloroplast Development in Rice	2016	Plant Physiol	South China Agricultural University CITY: Guangzhou STATE: Guangdong China 	Chloroplast, the photosynthetic organelle in plants, plays a crucial role in plant development and growth through manipulating the capacity of photosynthesis. However, the regulatory mechanism of chloroplast development still remains elusive. Here, we characterized a mutant with defective in chloroplasts in rice, termed albino leaf 1 (al1), which exhibits distinct albino phenotype in leaves, eventually leading the al1 seedling to lethal. Electronic microscopy observation demonstrated that the numbers of thylakoids was reduced and the structure of thylakoids was disrupted in the al1 mutant during rice development, which eventually led to the breakdown of chloroplast. Molecular cloning revealed that AL1 encodes the sole Octotricopeptide Repeat Protein (RAP) in rice. Genetic complementation of the Arabidopsis rap mutants indicated that AL1 protein is a functional RAP. Further analysis illustrated that three transcript variants were present in the AL1 gene and the altered splices were occurred at the 3'UTR of AL1 transcript. In addition, our results also indicate that disruption of AL1 gene results in the altered expression of chloroplast associated genes. Consistently, proteomic analysis demonstrated that the abundances of photosynthesis associated proteins are significantly altered, as well as a group of metabolism associated proteins. More specifically, we found that the loss of AL1 resulted in the altered abundances of ribosomal proteins, suggesting that RAP likely also regulates the homeostasis of ribosomal proteins in rice in addition to the rRNA. Taken together, we conclude that the AL1, particularly the AL1a and c isoform, plays an essential role in chloroplast development in rice.
