The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is a key stress signal in plants. Although the identification of ABA receptors led to significant progresses in understanding Arabidopsis ABA signaling pathway, there are still many mysteries for ABA signaling in monocots, such as in rice. Here, we report that a rice ortholog of AtABI1 and AtABI2, named as OsABI-LIKE2 (OsABIL2), plays a negative role in rice ABA signaling. Overexpression of OsABIL2 not only led to the ABA insensitivity, but also significantly altered plant developmental phenotypes, including stomata density and root architecture, which likely caused the hypersensitivity to drought stress. OsABIL2 interacts with OsPYL1, SAPK8 and SAPK10 both in vitro and in vivo, and the phosphatase activity of OsABIL2 was repressed by ABA-bound OsPYL1. However, unlike many other solely nucleus-localized clade A PP2Cs, the OsABIL2 is localized in both nucleus and cytosol. Furthermore, OsABIL2 interacts with and co-localized with OsPYL1 mainly in the cytosol, and ABA treatment regulates the nucleus-cytosol distribution of OsABIL2, suggesting a different mechanism for the activation of ABA signaling. Taken together, this study provides significant insights into rice ABA signaling and indicates the important role of OsABIL2 in regulating root development.
