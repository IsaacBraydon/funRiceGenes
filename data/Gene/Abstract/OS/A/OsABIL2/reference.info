NA	Abscisic acid regulates subcellular redistribution of OsABI-LIKE2, a negative regulator in ABA signaling, to control root architecture and drought resistance in Oryza Sativa.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	1, National Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China.	The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is a key stress signal in plants. Although the identification of ABA receptors led to significant progresses in understanding Arabidopsis ABA signaling pathway, there are still many mysteries for ABA signaling in monocots, such as in rice. Here, we report that a rice ortholog of AtABI1 and AtABI2, named as OsABI-LIKE2 (OsABIL2), plays a negative role in rice ABA signaling. Overexpression of OsABIL2 not only led to the ABA insensitivity, but also significantly altered plant developmental phenotypes, including stomata density and root architecture, which likely caused the hypersensitivity to drought stress. OsABIL2 interacts with OsPYL1, SAPK8 and SAPK10 both in vitro and in vivo, and the phosphatase activity of OsABIL2 was repressed by ABA-bound OsPYL1. However, unlike many other solely nucleus-localized clade A PP2Cs, the OsABIL2 is localized in both nucleus and cytosol. Furthermore, OsABIL2 interacts with and co-localized with OsPYL1 mainly in the cytosol, and ABA treatment regulates the nucleus-cytosol distribution of OsABIL2, suggesting a different mechanism for the activation of ABA signaling. Taken together, this study provides significant insights into rice ABA signaling and indicates the important role of OsABIL2 in regulating root development.
NA	Abscisic Acid Regulates Auxin Homeostasis in Rice Root Tips to Promote Root Hair Elongation.	2017	Front Plant Sci	National Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan UniversityShanghai, China.	Abscisic acid (ABA) plays an essential role in root hair elongation in plants, but the regulatory mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, we found that exogenous ABA can promote rice root hair elongation. Transgenic rice overexpressing SAPK10 (Stress/ABA-activated protein kinase 10) had longer root hairs; rice plants overexpressing OsABIL2 (OsABI-Like 2) had attenuated ABA signaling and shorter root hairs, suggesting that the effect of ABA on root hair elongation depends on the conserved PYR/PP2C/SnRK2 ABA signaling module. Treatment of the DR5-GUS and OsPIN-GUS lines with ABA and an auxin efflux inhibitor showed that ABA-induced root hair elongation depends on polar auxin transport. To examine the transcriptional response to ABA, we divided rice root tips into three regions: short root hair, long root hair and root tip zones; and conducted RNA-seq analysis with or without ABA treatment. Examination of genes involved in auxin transport, biosynthesis and metabolism indicated that ABA promotes auxin biosynthesis and polar auxin transport in the root tip, which may lead to auxin accumulation in the long root hair zone. Our findings shed light on how ABA regulates root hair elongation through crosstalk with auxin biosynthesis and transport to orchestrate plant development.
