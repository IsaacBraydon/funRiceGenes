OsABIL2	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	Abscisic acid regulates subcellular redistribution of OsABI-LIKE2, a negative regulator in ABA signaling, to control root architecture and drought resistance in Oryza Sativa.	OsABIL2 interacts with OsPYL1, SAPK8 and SAPK10 both in vitro and in vivo, and the phosphatase activity of OsABIL2 was repressed by ABA-bound OsPYL1
OsABIL2	SAPK10	Abscisic acid regulates subcellular redistribution of OsABI-LIKE2, a negative regulator in ABA signaling, to control root architecture and drought resistance in Oryza Sativa.	OsABIL2 interacts with OsPYL1, SAPK8 and SAPK10 both in vitro and in vivo, and the phosphatase activity of OsABIL2 was repressed by ABA-bound OsPYL1
OsABIL2	OsPYL1	Abscisic acid regulates subcellular redistribution of OsABI-LIKE2, a negative regulator in ABA signaling, to control root architecture and drought resistance in Oryza Sativa	OsABIL2 interacts with OsPYL1, SAPK8 and SAPK10 both in vitro and in vivo, and the phosphatase activity of OsABIL2 was repressed by ABA-bound OsPYL1
OsABIL2	SAPK10	Abscisic Acid Regulates Auxin Homeostasis in Rice Root Tips to Promote Root Hair Elongation.	 Transgenic rice overexpressing SAPK10 (Stress/ABA-activated protein kinase 10) had longer root hairs; rice plants overexpressing OsABIL2 (OsABI-Like 2) had attenuated ABA signaling and shorter root hairs, suggesting that the effect of ABA on root hair elongation depends on the conserved PYR/PP2C/SnRK2 ABA signaling module
OsABIL2	OsPYL1	Ectopic expression of mutated type 2C protein phosphatase OsABI-LIKE2 decreases abscisic acid sensitivity in Arabidopsis and rice.	 A yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that the interaction between OsABIL2 and a putative rice ABA receptor, OsPYL1, was ABA-dependent, and the interaction was lost with amino acid substitution from glycine to aspartic acid at the 183rd amino acid of the OsABIL2 protein, corresponding to abi1-1 mutation
HDA704	OsABIL2	Rice histone deacetylase HDA704 positively regulates drought and salt tolerance by controlling stomatal aperture and density	Our results showed that HDA704 directly binds to DST and ABIL2, repressing their expression via histone deacetylation modification.
