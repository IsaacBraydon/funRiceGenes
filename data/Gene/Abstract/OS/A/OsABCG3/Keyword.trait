OsABCG3	pollen	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.
OsABCG3	pollen	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.	Here we identified two osabcg3 allelic mutants and demonstrated that OsABCG3 was required for pollen development in rice
OsABCG3	pollen	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.	 The expression of some genes required for pollen wall formation was examined in osabcg3 mutants
OsABCG3	pollen	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.	Base on the genetic and cytological analyses, OsABCG3 was proposed to transport the tapetum-produced materials essential for pollen wall formation
OsABCG3	development	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.
OsABCG3	development	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.	Here we identified two osabcg3 allelic mutants and demonstrated that OsABCG3 was required for pollen development in rice
OsABCG3	transporter	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.
OsABCG3	transporter	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.	 OsABCG3 encodes a half-size ABCG transporter localized on the plasma membrane
OsABCG3	plasma membrane	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.	 OsABCG3 encodes a half-size ABCG transporter localized on the plasma membrane
OsABCG3	tapetum	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.	 Loss-function of OsABCG3 caused abnormal degradation of the tapetum
OsABCG3	pollen development	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.
OsABCG3	pollen development	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.	Here we identified two osabcg3 allelic mutants and demonstrated that OsABCG3 was required for pollen development in rice
OsABCG3	pollen wall	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.	 The expression of some genes required for pollen wall formation was examined in osabcg3 mutants
OsABCG3	pollen wall	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.	Base on the genetic and cytological analyses, OsABCG3 was proposed to transport the tapetum-produced materials essential for pollen wall formation
