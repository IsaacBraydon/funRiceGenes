The pollen wall, which protects male gametophyte against various stresses and facilitates pollination, is essential for successful reproduction in flowering plants. The pollen wall consists of gametophyte-derived intine and sporophyte-derived exine. From outside to inside of exine are tectum, bacula, nexine I and nexine II layers. How these structural layers are formed has been under extensive studies, but the molecular mechanisms remain obscure.Here we identified two osabcg3 allelic mutants and demonstrated that OsABCG3 was required for pollen development in rice. OsABCG3 encodes a half-size ABCG transporter localized on the plasma membrane. It was mainly expressed in anther when exine started to form. Loss-function of OsABCG3 caused abnormal degradation of the tapetum. The mutant pollen lacked the nexine II and intine layers, and shriveled without cytoplasm. The expression of some genes required for pollen wall formation was examined in osabcg3 mutants. The mutation did not alter the expression of the regulatory genes and lipid metabolism genes, but altered the expression of lipid transport genes.Base on the genetic and cytological analyses, OsABCG3 was proposed to transport the tapetum-produced materials essential for pollen wall formation. This study provided a new perspective to the genetic regulation of pollen wall development.
