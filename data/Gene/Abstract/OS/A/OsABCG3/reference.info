NA	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.	2018	Rice (N Y)	Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Plant Development, School of Life Sciences, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, 510631, China.	The pollen wall, which protects male gametophyte against various stresses and facilitates pollination, is essential for successful reproduction in flowering plants. The pollen wall consists of gametophyte-derived intine and sporophyte-derived exine. From outside to inside of exine are tectum, bacula, nexine I and nexine II layers. How these structural layers are formed has been under extensive studies, but the molecular mechanisms remain obscure.Here we identified two osabcg3 allelic mutants and demonstrated that OsABCG3 was required for pollen development in rice. OsABCG3 encodes a half-size ABCG transporter localized on the plasma membrane. It was mainly expressed in anther when exine started to form. Loss-function of OsABCG3 caused abnormal degradation of the tapetum. The mutant pollen lacked the nexine II and intine layers, and shriveled without cytoplasm. The expression of some genes required for pollen wall formation was examined in osabcg3 mutants. The mutation did not alter the expression of the regulatory genes and lipid metabolism genes, but altered the expression of lipid transport genes.Base on the genetic and cytological analyses, OsABCG3 was proposed to transport the tapetum-produced materials essential for pollen wall formation. This study provided a new perspective to the genetic regulation of pollen wall development.
NA	Gene Expression Dynamics in Rice Peduncles at the Heading Stage	2020	Front Genet	Grass Genetics and Informatics Group, School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.	Improving grain yield in the staple food crop rice has been long sought goal of plant biotechnology. One of the traits with significant impact on rice breeding programs is peduncle elongation at the time of heading failing which leads to significant reduction in grain yield due to incomplete panicle exsertion. To decipher transcriptional dynamics and molecular players underlying peduncle elongation, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of elongating and non-elongating peduncles in two Indian cultivars, Swarna and Pokkali, at the time of heading. Along with genes associated with cell division and cell wall biosynthesis, we observed significant enrichment of genes associated with auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis/signaling in the elongating peduncles before heading in both the genotypes. Similarly, genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and mobilization, abiotic stress response along with cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene biosynthesis/signaling were enriched in non-elongating peduncles post heading. Significant enrichment of genes belonging to key transcription factor families highlights their specialized roles in peduncle elongation and grain filling before and after heading, respectively. A comparison with anther/pollen development-related genes provided 76 candidates with overlapping roles in anther/pollen development and peduncle elongation. Some of these are important for carbohydrate remobilization to the developing grains. These can be engineered to combat with incomplete panicle exsertion in male sterile lines and manipulate carbohydrate dynamics in grasses. Overall, this study provides baseline information about potential target genes for engineering peduncle elongation with implications on plant height, biomass composition and grain yields in rice.
