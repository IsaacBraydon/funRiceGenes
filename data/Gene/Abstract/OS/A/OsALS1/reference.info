Toxic aluminum enters the root cells rapidly, therefore internal detoxification is required. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here we functionally characterized a rice gene, Os03g0755100 (OsALS1), that is regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor. OsALS1 encodes a half-size ABC transporter that is a member of the TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) sub-group. Expression of OsALS1 was rapidly and specifically induced by Al in the roots, but not by other metals or low pH. OsALS1 was localized at all cells of the roots. Furthermore, OsALS1 is localized to the tonoplast. These expression patterns and cell specificity of localization are different from those of the homologous gene AtALS1 in Arabidopsis. Knockout of OsALS1 in three independent lines resulted in significant increased sensitivity to Al, but did not affect the sensitivity to other metals and low pH. Comparison of Al accumulation patterns between wild-type and osals1 mutants showed that there was no difference in Al levels in the cell sap of root tips between wild-type and the mutants, but the mutants accumulated more Al in the cytosol and nucleus than the wild-type. Expression of OsALS1 in yeast resulted in increased Al sensitivity due to mis-localization. These results indicate that OsALS1 localized at the tonoplast is responsible for sequestration of Al into the vacuoles, which is required for internal detoxification of Al in rice.
NA	Base-Editing-Mediated Artificial Evolution of OsALS1 in planta to Develop Novel Herbicide-Tolerant Rice Germplasms.	2020	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory for Biology of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests, Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100193, China.	Recently developed CRISPR-mediated base editors, which enable numerous nucleotide changes in target genomic regions, have been widely adopted in gene correction and generating gain-of-function crop germplasms in relation to important genetic variations. However, engineering target genes with unknown functional SNPs remains a challenge. To address this question, here we present a base-editor-mediated gene evolution method (BEMGE), mediated by both Cas9n-based cytosine and adenine base editors as well as a sgRNA library tiling the full-length coding region, for developing novel germplasms of any endogenous gene in rice. To this end, OsALS1 was artificially evolved in rice cells using BEMGE through both Agrobacterium- and particle bombardment-mediated transformation. Four different types of amino acid substitutions in the evolved OsALS1, derived from two loci which have never been targeted by natural or human selection during rice domestication, were identified conferring varying levels of tolerance to herbicide bispyribac-sodium. Furthermore, the P171F substitution identified in a strong OsALS1 allele was quickly introduced into the commercial rice cultivar Nangeng 46 through precise base editing with the corresponding base editor and sgRNA. All these data indicate a great potential of BEMGE in identification of important genetic variations of target genes and in future crop improvement.
