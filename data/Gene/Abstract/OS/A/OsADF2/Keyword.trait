OsADF2	drought	An Actin Depolymerizing Factor from the Halophyte Smooth Cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora (SaADF2) is Superior to its Rice homolog (OsADF2) in Conferring Drought and Salt Tolerance when Constitutively Overexpressed in Rice.	 An ADF isolated from a monocot halophyte, Spartina alterniflora (SaADF2) imparted significantly higher level of drought and salinity tolerance when expressed in rice than its rice homologue OsADF2
OsADF2	drought	An Actin Depolymerizing Factor from the Halophyte Smooth Cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora (SaADF2) is Superior to its Rice homolog (OsADF2) in Conferring Drought and Salt Tolerance when Constitutively Overexpressed in Rice.	 Rice transgenics constitutively overexpressing SaADF2 (SaADF2-OE) showed better growth, relative water content, and photosynthetic and agronomic yield under drought conditions than wild-type (WT) and OsADF2 overexpressers (OsADF2-OE)
OsADF2	salinity	An Actin Depolymerizing Factor from the Halophyte Smooth Cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora (SaADF2) is Superior to its Rice homolog (OsADF2) in Conferring Drought and Salt Tolerance when Constitutively Overexpressed in Rice.	 An ADF isolated from a monocot halophyte, Spartina alterniflora (SaADF2) imparted significantly higher level of drought and salinity tolerance when expressed in rice than its rice homologue OsADF2
OsADF2	tolerance	An Actin Depolymerizing Factor from the Halophyte Smooth Cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora (SaADF2) is Superior to its Rice homolog (OsADF2) in Conferring Drought and Salt Tolerance when Constitutively Overexpressed in Rice.	 An ADF isolated from a monocot halophyte, Spartina alterniflora (SaADF2) imparted significantly higher level of drought and salinity tolerance when expressed in rice than its rice homologue OsADF2
OsADF2	yield	An Actin Depolymerizing Factor from the Halophyte Smooth Cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora (SaADF2) is Superior to its Rice homolog (OsADF2) in Conferring Drought and Salt Tolerance when Constitutively Overexpressed in Rice.	 Rice transgenics constitutively overexpressing SaADF2 (SaADF2-OE) showed better growth, relative water content, and photosynthetic and agronomic yield under drought conditions than wild-type (WT) and OsADF2 overexpressers (OsADF2-OE)
OsADF2	protein kinase	An Actin Depolymerizing Factor from the Halophyte Smooth Cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora (SaADF2) is Superior to its Rice homolog (OsADF2) in Conferring Drought and Salt Tolerance when Constitutively Overexpressed in Rice.	 SaADF2 differs from OsADF2 by a few amino acid residues, including a substitution in the regulatory phosphorylation site serine-6, which accounted for its weak interaction with OsCDPK6 (calcium dependent protein kinase), thus resulting in an increased efficacy of SaADF2 and enhanced cellular actin dynamics
