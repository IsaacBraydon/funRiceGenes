OsATG5	autophagy	eIF4A, a target of siRNA derived from rice stripe virus, negatively regulates antiviral autophagy by interacting with ATG5 in Nicotiana benthamiana	Finally, we demonstrate that eIF4A from rice, the natural host of RSV, also interacts with OsATG5 and suppresses OsATG5-activated autophagy, pointing to the conserved function of eIF4A as a negative regulator of antiviral autophagy.
