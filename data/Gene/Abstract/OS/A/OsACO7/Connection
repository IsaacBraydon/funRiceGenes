OsACO7	OsACS2	Contribution of ethylene biosynthesis for resistance to blast fungus infection in young rice plants	Among six ACC synthase (ACS) and seven ACO genes found in the rice genome, OsACS2 was transiently expressed at 48 hpi in IL7 and at 96 hpi in wild type, and OsACO7 was expressed at 48 hpi in IL7
OsACO7	OsACS2	Contribution of ethylene biosynthesis for resistance to blast fungus infection in young rice plants	These findings suggest the importance of ET biosynthesis and, consequently, the coproduct, cyanide, for HR-accompanied resistance to blast fungus in young rice plants and the contribution of induced OsACS2 and OsACO7 gene expression to it
OsACO7	SD38	A very-long-chain fatty acid synthesis gene, SD38, influences plant height by activating ethylene biosynthesis in rice.	 Exogenously supplied VLCFA (C24:0) increased the expression levels of OsACS3, OsACS4, and OsACO7 and the plant height of sd38 mutant seedlings, similar to the effect of exogenous application of ACC and ethephon
