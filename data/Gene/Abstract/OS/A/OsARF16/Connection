OsARF16	OsPHR2	OsARF16, a transcription factor, is required for auxin and phosphate starvation response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Six phosphate starvation-induced genes (PSIs) were less induced by -Pi in osarf16 and these trends were similar to a knockdown mutant of OsPHR2 or AtPHR1, which was a key regulator under -Pi
OsARF12	OsARF16	Auxin response factors (ARFs) differentially regulate rice antiviral immune response against rice dwarf virus	 Strikingly, our genetic data showed that loss-of-function mutants of osarf12 or osarf16 exhibit reduced resistance whereas osarf11 mutants display enhanced resistance to RDV
OsARF11	OsARF16	Auxin response factors (ARFs) differentially regulate rice antiviral immune response against rice dwarf virus	 Strikingly, our genetic data showed that loss-of-function mutants of osarf12 or osarf16 exhibit reduced resistance whereas osarf11 mutants display enhanced resistance to RDV
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsARF16	Narrow Leaf21, Encoding Ribosomal Protein RPS3A, Controls Leaf Development in Rice	 Transformation with modified OsARF11, OsARF16 and OsWOX3A genomic DNA lacking uORFs rescued the narrow leaf phenotype of nal21 to a better extent than transformation with their native genomic DNA, implying that RPS3A could regulate translation of ARFs and WOX3A through uORFs
OsARF11	OsARF16	Narrow Leaf21, Encoding Ribosomal Protein RPS3A, Controls Leaf Development in Rice	 Transformation with modified OsARF11, OsARF16 and OsWOX3A genomic DNA lacking uORFs rescued the narrow leaf phenotype of nal21 to a better extent than transformation with their native genomic DNA, implying that RPS3A could regulate translation of ARFs and WOX3A through uORFs
NAL21	OsARF16	Narrow Leaf21, Encoding Ribosomal Protein RPS3A, Controls Leaf Development in Rice	 Transformation with modified OsARF11, OsARF16 and OsWOX3A genomic DNA lacking uORFs rescued the narrow leaf phenotype of nal21 to a better extent than transformation with their native genomic DNA, implying that RPS3A could regulate translation of ARFs and WOX3A through uORFs
OsARF16	OsUBC11	Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme OsUBC11 Affects the Development of Roots via Auxin Pathway.	 Expression of the auxin synthesis regulating gene OsYUCCA4/6/7/9, the auxin transport gene OsAUX1, auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) family gene OsIAA31, auxin response factor OsARF16 and root regulator key genes, including OsWOX11, OsCRL1, OsCRL5 was significantly down-regulated in OsUBC11 overexpressing plants
