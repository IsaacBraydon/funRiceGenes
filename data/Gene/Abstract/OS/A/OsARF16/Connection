OsARF16	OsPHR2	OsARF16, a transcription factor, is required for auxin and phosphate starvation response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Six phosphate starvation-induced genes (PSIs) were less induced by -Pi in osarf16 and these trends were similar to a knockdown mutant of OsPHR2 or AtPHR1, which was a key regulator under -Pi
OsARF12	OsARF16	Auxin response factors (ARFs) differentially regulate rice antiviral immune response against rice dwarf virus	 Strikingly, our genetic data showed that loss-of-function mutants of osarf12 or osarf16 exhibit reduced resistance whereas osarf11 mutants display enhanced resistance to RDV
