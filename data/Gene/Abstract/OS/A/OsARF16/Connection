OsARF16	OsPHR2	OsARF16, a transcription factor, is required for auxin and phosphate starvation response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Six phosphate starvation-induced genes (PSIs) were less induced by -Pi in osarf16 and these trends were similar to a knockdown mutant of OsPHR2 or AtPHR1, which was a key regulator under -Pi
