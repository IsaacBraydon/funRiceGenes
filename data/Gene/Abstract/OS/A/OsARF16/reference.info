pce12001.pdf	OsARF16, a transcription factor, is required for auxin and phosphate starvation response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2013	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Plant responses to auxin and phosphate (Pi) starvation are closely linked. However, the underlying mechanisms connecting auxin to phosphate starvation (-Pi) responses are largely unclear. Here, we show that OsARF16, an auxin response factor, functions in both auxin and -Pi responses in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The knockout of OsARF16 led to primary roots (PR), lateral roots (LR) and root hair losing sensitivity to auxin and -Pi response. OsARF16 expression and OsARF16::GUS staining in PR and LR of rice Nipponbare (NIP) were induced by indole acetic acid and -Pi treatments. In -Pi conditions, the shoot biomass of osarf16 was slightly reduced, and neither root growth nor iron content was induced, indicating that the knockout of OsARF16 led to loss of response to Pi deficiency in rice. Six phosphate starvation-induced genes (PSIs) were less induced by -Pi in osarf16 and these trends were similar to a knockdown mutant of OsPHR2 or AtPHR1, which was a key regulator under -Pi. These data first reveal the biological function of OsARF16, provide novel evidence of a linkage between auxin and -Pi responses and facilitate the development of new strategies for the efficient utilization of Pi in rice.
NA	OsARF16 Is Involved in Cytokinin-Mediated Inhibition of Phosphate Transport and Phosphate Signaling in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2014	PLoS One	College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou 310036, China.	Plant responses to phytohormone stimuli are the most important biological features for plants to survive in a complex environment. Cytokinin regulates growth and nutrient homeostasis, such as the phosphate (Pi) starvation response and Pi uptake in plants. However, the mechanisms underlying how cytokinin participates in Pi uptake and Pi signaling are largely unknown. In this study, we found that OsARF16 is required for the cytokinin response and is involved in the negative regulation of Pi uptake and Pi signaling by cytokinin. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The mutant osarf16 showed an obvious resistance to exogenous cytokinin treatment and the expression level of the OsARF16 gene was considerably up-regulated by cytokinin. Cytokinin (6-BA) application suppressed Pi uptake and the Pi starvation response in wild-type Nipponbare (NIP) and all these responses were compromised in the osarf16 mutant. Our data showed that cytokinin inhibits the transport of Pi from the roots to the shoots and that OsARF16 is involved in this process. The Pi content in the osarf16 mutant was much higher than in NIP under 6-BA treatment. The expressions of PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1 (PHT1) genes, phosphate (Pi) starvation-induced (PSI) genes and purple PAPase genes were higher in the osarf16 mutant than in NIP under cytokinin treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed a new biological function for OsARF16 in the cytokinin-mediated inhibition of Pi uptake and Pi signaling in rice.
NA	OsARF16, a transcription factor regulating auxin redistribution, is required for iron deficiency response in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Plant Sci	College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou 310036, China. Electronic address: shencj@hznu.edu.cn.	Plant response to iron deficiency is the most important feature for survival in Fe-limited soils. Several phytohormones, including auxin, are involved in iron uptake and homeostasis. However, the mechanisms behind how auxin participates in the iron deficiency response in rice are largely unknown. We found that OsARF16 was involved in the iron deficiency response and the induction of iron deficiency response genes. Most Fe-deficient symptoms could be partially restored in the osarf16 mutant, including dwarfism, photosynthesis decline, a reduction in iron content and root system architecture (RSA) regulation. OsARF16 expression was induced in the roots and shoots by Fe deprivation. Restoration of the phenotype could also be mimicked by 1-NOA, an auxin influx inhibitor. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR data indicated that the induction of Fe-deficiency response genes by iron deficiency was more compromised in the osarf16 mutant than in Nipponbare. In conclusion, osarf16, an auxin insensitive mutant, was involved in iron deficiency response in rice. Our results reveal a new biological function for OsARF16 and provide important information on how ARF-medicated auxin signaling affects iron signaling and the iron deficiency response. This work may help us to improve production or increased Fe nutrition of rice to iron deficiency by regulating auxin signaling.
NA	Auxin response factors (ARFs) differentially regulate rice antiviral immune response against rice dwarf virus	2021	PLoS Pathog	The State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.	There are 25 auxin response factors (ARFs) in the rice genome, which play critical roles in regulating myriad aspects of plant development, but their role (s) in host antiviral immune defense and the underneath mechanism remain largely unknown. By using the rice-rice dwarf virus (RDV) model system, here we report that auxin signaling enhances rice defense against RDV infection. In turn, RDV infection triggers increased auxin biosynthesis and accumulation in rice, and that treatment with exogenous auxin reduces OsIAA10 protein level, thereby unleashing a group of OsIAA10-interacting OsARFs to mediate downstream antiviral responses. Strikingly, our genetic data showed that loss-of-function mutants of osarf12 or osarf16 exhibit reduced resistance whereas osarf11 mutants display enhanced resistance to RDV. In turn, OsARF12 activates the down-stream OsWRKY13 expression through direct binding to its promoter, loss-of-function mutants of oswrky13 exhibit reduced resistance. These results demonstrated that OsARF 11, 12 and 16 differentially regulate rice antiviral defense. Together with our previous discovery that the viral P2 protein stabilizes OsIAA10 protein via thwarting its interaction with OsTIR1 to enhance viral infection and pathogenesis, our results reveal a novel auxin-IAA10-ARFs-mediated signaling mechanism employed by rice and RDV for defense and counter defense responses.
NA	Narrow Leaf21, Encoding Ribosomal Protein RPS3A, Controls Leaf Development in Rice	2021	Plant Physiol	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Leaf morphology influences photosynthesis, transpiration and ultimately crop yield. However, the molecular mechanism of leaf development is still not fully understood. Here, we identified and characterized the narrow leaf21 (nal21) mutant in rice (Oryza sativa), showing a significant reduction in leaf width, leaf length and plant height, and increased tiller number. Microscopic observation revealed defects in the vascular system and reduced epidermal cell size and number in the nal21 leaf blade. Map-based cloning revealed that NAL21 encodes a ribosomal small subunit protein RPS3A. Ribosome-targeting antibiotics resistance assay and ribosome profiling showed a significant reduction in the free 40S ribosome subunit in the nal21 mutant. The nal21 mutant showed aberrant auxin responses in which multiple auxin response factors (ARFs) harboring upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) were repressed at the translational level. The WUSCHEL-related homeobox 3A (OsWOX3A) gene, a key transcription factor involved in leaf blade lateral outgrowth, is also under the translational regulation by RPS3A. Transformation with modified OsARF11, OsARF16 and OsWOX3A genomic DNA lacking uORFs rescued the narrow leaf phenotype of nal21 to a better extent than transformation with their native genomic DNA, implying that RPS3A could regulate translation of ARFs and WOX3A through uORFs. Our results demonstrate that proper translational regulation of key factors involved in leaf development is essential to maintain normal leaf morphology.
