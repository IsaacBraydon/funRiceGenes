OsATG8c	yield	OsATG8c-Mediated Increased Autophagy Regulates the Yield and Nitrogen Use Efficiency in Rice.	 It was found that the overexpression of OsATG8c significantly enhanced the activity of autophagy and that the number of autophagosomes, dwarfed the plant height and increased the effective tillers' number and yield
