NA	OsATG8c-Mediated Increased Autophagy Regulates the Yield and Nitrogen Use Efficiency in Rice.	2019	Int J Mol Sci	Key Laboratory of Northern Japonica Rice Genetics and Breeding, Ministry of Education and Liaoning Province, Key Laboratory of Northeast Rice Biology and Genetics and Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture, Rice Research Institute of Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang 110866, China. xiaoxizhen1991@163.com.	Autophagy, a conserved pathway in eukaryotes, degrades and recycles cellular components, thus playing an important role in nitrogen (N) remobilization. N plays an important role in the growth and development of plants, which also affects plant yield and quality. In this research, it was found that the transcriptional level of a core autophagy gene of rice (Oryza sativa), OsATG8c, was increased during N starvation conditions. It was found that the overexpression of OsATG8c significantly enhanced the activity of autophagy and that the number of autophagosomes, dwarfed the plant height and increased the effective tillers' number and yield. The nitrogen uptake efficiency (NUpE) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) significantly increased in the transgenic rice under both optimal and suboptimal N conditions. Based on our results, OsATG8c is considered to be a good candidate gene for increasing NUE, especially under suboptimal field conditions.
NA	A tripartite rheostat controls self-regulated host plant resistance to insects.	2023	Nature	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.	Plants deploy receptor-like kinases and nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors to confer host plant resistance (HPR) to herbivores(1). These gene-for-gene interactions between insects and their hosts have been proposed for more than 50 years(2). However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie HPR have been elusive, as the identity and sensing mechanisms of insect avirulence effectors have remained unknown. Here we identify an insect salivary protein perceived by a plant immune receptor. The BPH14-interacting salivary protein (BISP) from the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål) is secreted into rice (Oryza sativa) during feeding. In susceptible plants, BISP targets O. satvia RLCK185 (OsRLCK185; hereafter Os is used to denote O. satvia-related proteins or genes) to suppress basal defences. In resistant plants, the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptor BPH14 directly binds BISP to activate HPR. Constitutive activation of Bph14-mediated immunity is detrimental to plant growth and productivity. The fine-tuning of Bph14-mediated HPR is achieved through direct binding of BISP and BPH14 to the selective autophagy cargo receptor OsNBR1, which delivers BISP to OsATG8 for degradation. Autophagy therefore controls BISP levels. In Bph14 plants, autophagy restores cellular homeostasis by downregulating HPR when feeding by brown planthoppers ceases. We identify an insect saliva protein sensed by a plant immune receptor and discover a three-way interaction system that offers opportunities for developing high-yield, insect-resistant crops.
