NA	OsATG8c-Mediated Increased Autophagy Regulates the Yield and Nitrogen Use Efficiency in Rice.	2019	Int J Mol Sci	Key Laboratory of Northern Japonica Rice Genetics and Breeding, Ministry of Education and Liaoning Province, Key Laboratory of Northeast Rice Biology and Genetics and Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture, Rice Research Institute of Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang 110866, China. xiaoxizhen1991@163.com.	Autophagy, a conserved pathway in eukaryotes, degrades and recycles cellular components, thus playing an important role in nitrogen (N) remobilization. N plays an important role in the growth and development of plants, which also affects plant yield and quality. In this research, it was found that the transcriptional level of a core autophagy gene of rice (Oryza sativa), OsATG8c, was increased during N starvation conditions. It was found that the overexpression of OsATG8c significantly enhanced the activity of autophagy and that the number of autophagosomes, dwarfed the plant height and increased the effective tillers' number and yield. The nitrogen uptake efficiency (NUpE) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) significantly increased in the transgenic rice under both optimal and suboptimal N conditions. Based on our results, OsATG8c is considered to be a good candidate gene for increasing NUE, especially under suboptimal field conditions.
