79307495.pdf	Hormonal Cross-Talk Between Auxin and Ethylene Differentially Regulates the Expression of Two Members of the 1-Aminocyclopropane-l-Carboxylate Oxidase Gene Family in Rice	2000	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Biology, College of Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.	Two cDNA clones, pOS-ACO2 and pOS-ACO3, encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) oxidase were isolated from rice seedling cDNA library. pOS-ACO3 is a 1,299 bp full-length clone encoding 321 amino acids (Mr=35.9 kDa), while pOS-ACO2 is 1,072 bp long and is a partial cDNA clone encoding 314 amino acids. These two deduced amino acid sequences share 70% identity, and display a high degree of sequence identity (72-92%) with previously isolated pOS-ACO1 of deepwater rice. The chromosomal location studies show that OS-ACO2 is positioned on the long arm of chromosome 9, while OS-ACO3 on the long arm of chromosome 2 of rice genome. A marked increase in the level of OS-ACO2 transcript was observed in IAA-treated etiolated rice seedlings, whereas the OS-ACO3 mRNA was greatly accumulated by ethylene treatment. Results of ethylene inhibitor studies indicated that auxin promotion of the OS-ACO2 transcription was not mediated through the action of auxin-induced ethylene. Thus, it appears that there are two groups of ACC oxidase transcripts in rice plants, either auxin-induced or ethylene-induced. The auxin-induced OS-ACO2 expression was partially inhibited by ethylene, while ethylene induction of OS-ACO3 transcription was completely blocked by auxin. These results indicate that the expression of ACC oxidase genes is regulated by complex hormonal networks in a gene specific manner in rice seedlings. Okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase, effectively suppressed the IAA induction of OS-ACO2 expression, suggesting that protein dephosphorylation plays a role in the induction of ACC oxidase by auxin. A scheme of the multiple regulatory pathways for the expression of ACC oxidase gene family by auxin, ethylene and protein phosphatase is presented.
Hu-2011-The Bphi008a gene in.pdf	The Bphi008a gene interacts with the ethylene pathway and transcriptionally regulates MAPK genes in the response of rice to brown planthopper feeding	2011	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, People's Republic of China.	We examined ways in which the Brown planthopper induced008a (Bphi008a; AY256682) gene of rice (Oryza sativa) enhances the plant's resistance to a specialist herbivore, the brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens). Measurement of the expression levels of ethylene synthases and of ethylene emissions showed that BPH feeding rapidly initiated the ethylene signaling pathway and up-regulated Bphi008a transcript levels after 6 to 96 h of feeding. In contrast, blocking ethylene transduction (using 1-methylcyclopropene) reduced Bphi008a transcript levels in wild-type plants fed upon by BPH. In vitro kinase assays showed that Bphi008a can be phosphorylated by rice Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase5 (OsMPK5), and yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal proline-rich region of Bphi008a interacts directly with this kinase. Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that this interaction occurs in the nucleus. Subsequently, we found that Bphi008a up-regulation and down-regulation were accompanied by different changes in transcription levels of OsMPK5, OsMPK12, OsMPK13, and OsMPK17 in transgenic plants. Immunoblot analysis also showed that the OsMPK5 protein level increased in overexpressing plants and decreased in RNA interference plants after BPH feeding. In transgenic lines, changes in the expression levels of several enzymes that are important components of the defenses against the BPH were also observed. Finally, yeast two-hybrid screening results showed that Bphi008a is able to interact with a b-ZIP transcription factor (OsbZIP60) and a RNA polymerase polypeptide (SDRP).
pp1421202.pdf	Contribution of ethylene biosynthesis for resistance to blast fungus infection in young rice plants	2006	Plant Physiol	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The role of ethylene (ET) in resistance to infection with blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) in rice (Oryza sativa) is poorly understood. To study it, we quantified ET levels after inoculation, using young rice plants at the four-leaf stage of rice cv Nipponbare (wild type) and its isogenic plant (IL7), which contains the Pi-i resistance gene to blast fungus race 003. Small necrotic lesions by hypersensitive reaction (HR) were formed at 42 to 72 h postinoculation (hpi) in resistant IL7 leaves, and whitish expanding lesions at 96 hpi in susceptible wild-type leaves. Notable was the enhanced ET emission at 48 hpi accompanied by increased 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) levels and highly elevated ACC oxidase (ACO) activity in IL7 leaves, whereas only an enhanced ACC increase at 96 hpi in wild-type leaves. Among six ACC synthase (ACS) and seven ACO genes found in the rice genome, OsACS2 was transiently expressed at 48 hpi in IL7 and at 96 hpi in wild type, and OsACO7 was expressed at 48 hpi in IL7. Treatment with an inhibitor for ACS, aminooxyacetic acid, suppressed enhanced ET emission at 48 hpi in IL7, resulting in expanding lesions instead of HR lesions. Exogenously supplied ACC compromised the aminooxyacetic acid-induced breakdown of resistance in IL7, and treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene and silver thiosulfate, inhibitors of ET action, did not suppress resistance. These findings suggest the importance of ET biosynthesis and, consequently, the coproduct, cyanide, for HR-accompanied resistance to blast fungus in young rice plants and the contribution of induced OsACS2 and OsACO7 gene expression to it.
