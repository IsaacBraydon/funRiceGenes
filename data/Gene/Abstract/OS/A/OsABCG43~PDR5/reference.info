An understanding of the cadmium (Cd) transport system in rice can serve as a basis for coping with Cd-related problems in rice and human health. To identify a new gene involved in Cd transport in rice, we screened our yeast library, expressing 140 kinds of rice ATP binding cassette (ABC)-type transporters. From the screening, we found that OsABCG43/PDR5 conferred high Cd tolerance on yeast. The Cd concentration of yeast carrying OsABCG43 was similar to that of the vector control. The OsABCG43 transcript was detected both in shoots and roots. Accumulation of it was elevated by Cd treatment in the roots but not in the shoots. This study indicates that OsABCG43 is a Cd inducible-transporter gene capable of conferring Cd tolerance on yeast.
NA	Cadmium accumulation regulated by a rice heavy-metal importer is harmful for host plant and leaf bacteria.	2022	J Adv Res	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	INTRODUCTION: Cadmium (Cd), one of the major toxic heavy metals, causes severe deleterious effects on all living organisms from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Cadmium deposition affects bacterial diversity and bacterial population in soil. Cadmium accumulation in plants is mainly controlled by transporters and the resulting Cd enrichment gives rise to phytotoxicity. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to mine transporters that control Cd import or accumulation in rice and uncover the underlying mechanisms that how accumulated Cd poses risks to host plant and leaf bacteria. METHODS: RNA-seq analysis, histochemical assays, and elemental quantification were carried out to reveal the biological roles of OsABCG43 for Cd import. Pathogen inoculation, IC(50) value, and bacterial virulence assays were conducted to disclose the effects of Cd on leaf bacteria. RESULTS: OsABCG43 is characterized as a Cd importer controlling Cd accumulation in rice. OsABCG43 was induced under Cd stress and specifically expressed in the vasculature of leaves and roots. Overexpression of OsABCG43 caused Cd accumulation which inhibits photosynthesis and development and alters the antioxidant system, resulting in phytotoxicity. Moreover, overexpression of OsABCG43 resulted in retarded plant growth and enhanced rice sensitivity to Cd stress. Numerous differentially expressed genes were identified via RNA-seq analysis between the OsABCG43-overexpressing plants and wild type, which functioned in Cd or reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. In addition, OsABCG43 transcripts were induced by leaf bacteria Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) and X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The enriched Cd directly impaired the formation of virulence factors for the leaf bacteria, preventing colonization or proliferation of Xoc or Xoo in rice leaves. CONCLUSION: This work reveals that OsABCG43 is expressed specifically in the vascular and plasma membrane-localized OsABCG43 functions as a Cd importer. OsABCG43-mediated import of Cd is harmful for both rice and the corresponding leaf bacteria.
