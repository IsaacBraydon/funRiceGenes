OsABCG43|PDR5	shoot	RiceABCG43Is Cd Inducible and Confers Cd Tolerance on Yeast	The OsABCG43 transcript was detected both in shoots and roots
OsABCG43|PDR5	root	RiceABCG43Is Cd Inducible and Confers Cd Tolerance on Yeast	The OsABCG43 transcript was detected both in shoots and roots
OsABCG43|PDR5	transporter	RiceABCG43Is Cd Inducible and Confers Cd Tolerance on Yeast	This study indicates that OsABCG43 is a Cd inducible-transporter gene capable of conferring Cd tolerance on yeast
OsABCG43|PDR5	leaf	Cadmium accumulation regulated by a rice heavy-metal importer is harmful for host plant and leaf bacteria.	 In addition, OsABCG43 transcripts were induced by leaf bacteria Xanthomonas oryzae pv
OsABCG43|PDR5	growth	Cadmium accumulation regulated by a rice heavy-metal importer is harmful for host plant and leaf bacteria.	 Moreover, overexpression of OsABCG43 resulted in retarded plant growth and enhanced rice sensitivity to Cd stress
OsABCG43|PDR5	development	Cadmium accumulation regulated by a rice heavy-metal importer is harmful for host plant and leaf bacteria.	 Overexpression of OsABCG43 caused Cd accumulation which inhibits photosynthesis and development and alters the antioxidant system, resulting in phytotoxicity
OsABCG43|PDR5	photosynthesis	Cadmium accumulation regulated by a rice heavy-metal importer is harmful for host plant and leaf bacteria.	 Overexpression of OsABCG43 caused Cd accumulation which inhibits photosynthesis and development and alters the antioxidant system, resulting in phytotoxicity
OsABCG43|PDR5	stress	Cadmium accumulation regulated by a rice heavy-metal importer is harmful for host plant and leaf bacteria.	 OsABCG43 was induced under Cd stress and specifically expressed in the vasculature of leaves and roots
OsABCG43|PDR5	stress	Cadmium accumulation regulated by a rice heavy-metal importer is harmful for host plant and leaf bacteria.	 Moreover, overexpression of OsABCG43 resulted in retarded plant growth and enhanced rice sensitivity to Cd stress
OsABCG43|PDR5	plant growth	Cadmium accumulation regulated by a rice heavy-metal importer is harmful for host plant and leaf bacteria.	 Moreover, overexpression of OsABCG43 resulted in retarded plant growth and enhanced rice sensitivity to Cd stress
OsABCG43|PDR5	plasma membrane	Cadmium accumulation regulated by a rice heavy-metal importer is harmful for host plant and leaf bacteria.	 CONCLUSION: This work reveals that OsABCG43 is expressed specifically in the vascular and plasma membrane-localized OsABCG43 functions as a Cd importer
