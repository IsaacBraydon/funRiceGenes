Post-hypoxic injuries in plants are primarily caused by bursts of reactive oxygen species and acetaldehyde. In agreement with previous studies, we found accumulations of acetaldehyde in rice during re-aeration following submergence. During re-aeration, acetaldehyde-oxidizing aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity increased, thereby causing the acetaldehyde content to decrease in rice. Interestingly, re-aerated rice plants showed an intense mitochondrial ALDH2a protein induction, even though ALDH2a mRNA was submergence induced and declined upon re-aeration. This suggests that rice ALDH2a mRNA is accumulated in order to quickly metabolize acetaldehyde that is produced upon re-aeration.

Recent studies have suggested that mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldehyde:NAD(P)(+) oxidoreductase, EC 1.2.1.3) (ALDH2) plays essential roles in pollen development in plants. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) ALDH2 is encoded by at least two ALDH2 genes, one of which (ALDH2a) was previously identified. In this study, to understand the roles of ALDH2 in rice, we isolated and characterized a cDNA clone encoding another rice ALDH2 (ALDH2b). An in vitro ALDH assay indicated that ALDH2b possesses an NAD(+)-linked activity for oxidation of acetaldehyde, glycolaldehyde and propionaldehyde. Northern blot and immunoblot analyses revealed that ALDH2b was constitutively present in all the organs examined, whereas ALDH2a was expressed in leaves of dark-grown seedlings and panicles. By RFLP linkage mapping, the ALDH2a and ALDH2b genes were mapped to the long arm of chromosome 2 and the short arm of chromosome 6, respectively. We suggest that the rice ALDH2a and ALDH2b genes are orthologues of maize mitochondrial ALDH genes, rf2b and rf2a, respectively.

The aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene superfamily encoding for NAD(P)(+)-dependent enzymes is found in all major plant and animal taxa. However, the characterization of plant ALDHs has lagged behind their animal- and prokaryotic-ALDH homologs. In plants, ALDHs are involved in abiotic stress tolerance, male sterility restoration, embryo development and seed viability and maturation. However, there is still no structural property-dependent functional characterization of ALDH protein superfamily in plants. In this paper, we identify members of the rice ALDH gene superfamily and use the evolutionary nesting events of retrotransposons and protein-modeling-based structural reconstitution to report the genetic and molecular and structural features of each member of the rice ALDH superfamily in abiotic/biotic stress responses and developmental processes. Our results indicate that rice-ALDHs are the most expanded plant ALDHs ever characterized. This work represents the first report of specific structural features mediating functionality of the whole families of ALDHs in an organism ever characterized.
Plant Physiol.-2000-Nakazono-587-98.pdf	Expression of a gene encoding mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase in rice increases under submerged conditions	2000	Plant Physiol	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan. anakazo@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp	It is known that alcoholic fermentation is important for survival of plants under anaerobic conditions. Acetaldehyde, one of the intermediates of alcoholic fermentation, is not only reduced by alcohol dehydrogenase but also can be oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). To determine whether ALDH plays a role in anaerobic metabolism in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv Nipponbare), we characterized a cDNA clone encoding mitochondrial ALDH from rice (Aldh2a). Analysis of sub-cellular localization of ALDH2a protein using green fluorescent protein and an in vitro ALDH assay using protein extracts from Escherichia coli cells that overexpressed ALDH2a indicated that ALDH2a functions in the oxidation of acetaldehyde in mitochondria. A Southern-blot analysis indicated that mitochondrial ALDH is encoded by at least two genes in rice. We found that the Aldh2a mRNA was present at high levels in leaves of dark-grown seedlings, mature leaf sheaths, and panicles. It is interesting that expression of the rice Aldh2a gene, unlike the expression of the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) Aldh2a gene, was induced in rice seedlings by submergence. Experiments with ruthenium red, which is a blocker of Ca(2+) fluxes in rice as well as maize (Zea mays), suggest that the induction of expression of Adh1 and Pdc1 by low oxygen stress is regulated by elevation of the cytosolic Ca(2+) level. However, the induction of Aldh2a gene expression may not be controlled by the cytosolic Ca(2+) level elevation. A possible involvement of ALDH2a in the submergence tolerance of rice is discussed.
