ALDH2a|OsALDH2B5	OsALDH2B1|ALDH2b	Organ-specific expressions and chromosomal locations of two mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.), ALDH2a and ALDH2b	Northern blot and immunoblot analyses revealed that ALDH2b was constitutively present in all the organs examined, whereas ALDH2a was expressed in leaves of dark-grown seedlings and panicles
ALDH2a|OsALDH2B5	OsALDH2B1|ALDH2b	Organ-specific expressions and chromosomal locations of two mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.), ALDH2a and ALDH2b	By RFLP linkage mapping, the ALDH2a and ALDH2b genes were mapped to the long arm of chromosome 2 and the short arm of chromosome 6, respectively
ALDH2a|OsALDH2B5	OsALDH2B1|ALDH2b	Organ-specific expressions and chromosomal locations of two mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.), ALDH2a and ALDH2b	We suggest that the rice ALDH2a and ALDH2b genes are orthologues of maize mitochondrial ALDH genes, rf2b and rf2a, respectively
ALDH2a|OsALDH2B5	OsALDH2B1|ALDH2b	Organ-specific expressions and chromosomal locations of two mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.), ALDH2a and ALDH2b	Organ-specific expressions and chromosomal locations of two mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.), ALDH2a and ALDH2b
