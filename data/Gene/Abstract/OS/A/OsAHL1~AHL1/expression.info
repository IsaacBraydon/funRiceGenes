OsAHL1|AHL1	 Overexpression of OsAHL1 enhanced multiple stress tolerances in rice plants during both seedling and panicle development stages |  OsAHL1 specifically binds to the A/T rich sequence region of promoters or introns, and hence directly regulates the expression of many stress related downstream genes	 Overexpression of OsAHL1 enhanced multiple stress tolerances in rice plants during both seedling and panicle development stages
OsAHL1|AHL1	 Our knockout and overexpression studies showed that OsAHL1 positively regulates plant immunity in response to M	 Our knockout and overexpression studies showed that OsAHL1 positively regulates plant immunity in response to M
