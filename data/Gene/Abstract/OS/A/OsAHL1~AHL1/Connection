OsAHL1|AHL1	OsEIN2	MoIug4 is a novel secreted effector promoting rice blast by counteracting host OsAHL1-regulated ethylene gene transcription.	 OsAHL1 exhibits transcriptional regulatory activities by binding the OsEIN2 promoter region, similar to MoIug4
OsAHL1|AHL1	OsEIN2	MoIug4 is a novel secreted effector promoting rice blast by counteracting host OsAHL1-regulated ethylene gene transcription.	 Intriguingly, we found that MoIug4 exhibits a higher binding affinity than OsAHL1 to the OsEIN2 promoter, suggesting differential regulatory specificities
