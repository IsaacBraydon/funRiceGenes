Fujimoto-2004-Identification of a.pdf	Identification of a novel plant MAR DNA binding protein localized on chromosomal surfaces	2004	Plant Mol Biol	Department of Biotechnology, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1, Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.	We identified a novel nucleoplasm localized protein in Arabidopsis called AT-hook motif nuclear localized protein 1 (AHL1), which was isolated by visual screening of transformants using random GFP::cDNA fusions. AHL1 contains an AT-hook motif and unknown conserved PPC (plants and prokaryotes conserved) domain that includes a hydrophobic region. Approximately 30 paralogues were identified in the Arabidopsis genome. Proteins with PPC-like domains are found in Bacteria, Archaea and the plant kingdom, but in Bacteria and Archaea the PPC containing proteins of do not have an AT-hook motif. Thus, the PPC domain is evolutionary conserved and has a new function such as AT-rich DNA binding. AHL1 was mainly localized in the nucleoplasm, but little in the nucleolus and heterochromatic region, and was concentrated in the boundary region between euchromatin and heterochromatin. Biochemically, AHL1 was also found in the nuclear matrix fraction. In the M phase, AHL1 was localized on the chromosomal surface. The AT-hook motif was essential for matrix attachment region (MAR) binding, and the hydrophobic region of the PPC was indispensable for nuclear localization. Our results suggest that AHL1 is a novel plant MAR binding protein, which is related to the positioning of chromatin fibers in the nucleus by the presence of an AT-hook motif and PPC domain. In addition, AHL1 is located on the surface of chromosomes during mitosis.
NA	A novel gene OsAHL1 improves both drought avoidance and drought tolerance in rice.	2016	Sci Rep	Shanghai Agrobiological Gene Center, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shanghai 201106, China.	A novel gene, OsAHL1, containing an AT-hook motif and a PPC domain was identified through genome-wide profiling and analysis of mRNAs by comparing the microarray of drought-challenged versus normally watered rice. The results indicated OsAHL1 has both drought avoidance and drought tolerance that could greatly improve drought resistance of the rice plant. Overexpression of OsAHL1 enhanced multiple stress tolerances in rice plants during both seedling and panicle development stages. Functional studies revealed that OsAHL1 regulates root development under drought condition to enhance drought avoidance, participates in oxidative stress response and also regulates the content of chlorophyll in rice leaves. OsAHL1 specifically binds to the A/T rich sequence region of promoters or introns, and hence directly regulates the expression of many stress related downstream genes.
NA	MoIug4 is a novel secreted effector promoting rice blast by counteracting host OsAHL1-regulated ethylene gene transcription.	2022	New Phytol	Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Crop Diseases and Pests, Department of Plant Pathology, Ministry of Education, College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Magnaporthe oryzae secretes several effectors that modulate and hijack rice processes to colonize host cells, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We report on a novel cytoplasmic effector MoIug4 that targets the rice ethylene pathway as a transcription repressor to subvert host immunity. We found that MoIug4 binds to the promoter of the host OsEIN2 gene that encodes a central signal transducer in the ethylene-signaling pathway. We also identified a MoIug4 interacting protein, OsAHL1, which acts as an AT-hook motif-containing protein binding to the A/T-rich promoter regions. Our knockout and overexpression studies showed that OsAHL1 positively regulates plant immunity in response to M.â€‰oryzae infection. OsAHL1 exhibits transcriptional regulatory activities by binding the OsEIN2 promoter region, similar to MoIug4. Intriguingly, we found that MoIug4 exhibits a higher binding affinity than OsAHL1 to the OsEIN2 promoter, suggesting differential regulatory specificities. These results revealed a counter-defense strategy by which the pathogen effector suppresses the activation of host defense genes by interfering with host transcription activator functions.
