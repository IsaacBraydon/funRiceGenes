NA	Osa-miR167d facilitates infection of Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.	2019	J Integr Plant Biol	Rice Research Institute and Key Lab for Major Crop Diseases, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in rice response to Magnaporthe oryzae, the causative agent of rice blast disease. Studying the roles of rice miRNAs is of great significance for the disease control. Osa-miR167d belongs to a conserved miRNA family targeting auxin responsive factor (ARF) genes that act in developmental and stress-induced responses. Here, we show that Osa-miR167d plays a negative role in rice immunity against M. oryzae by suppressing its target gene. The expression of Osa-miR167d was significantly suppressed in a resistant accession at and after 24 hours post inoculation (hpi), however, its expression was significantly increased at 24 hpi in the susceptible accession upon M. oryzae infection. Transgenic rice lines over-expressing Osa-miR167d were highly susceptible to multiple blast fungal strains. By contrast, transgenic lines expressing a target mimicry to block Osa-miR167d enhanced resistance to rice blast disease. In addition, knocking out the target gene ARF12 led to hyper-susceptibility to multiple blast fungal strains. Taken together, our results indicate that Osa-miR167d negatively regulate rice immunity to facilitate the infection of M. oryzae by down-regulating ARF12. Thus, Osa-miR167d-ARF12 regulatory module could be valuable in improvement of blast-disease resistance.
