OsAIR2	OsKAT1	Molecular characterization of rice arsenic-induced RING Finger E3 ligase 2 (OsAIR2) and its heterogeneous overexpression in Arabidopsis thalaiana.	 Moreover, in vitro pull-down assay verified the physical interaction between OsAIR2 and OsKAT1
OsAIR2	OsKAT1	Molecular characterization of rice arsenic-induced RING Finger E3 ligase 2 (OsAIR2) and its heterogeneous overexpression in Arabidopsis thalaiana.	 Interestingly, in vitro ubiquitination assay and in vivo proteasomal degradation assay revealed that OsAIR2 ubiquitinates OsKAT1 and promotes the degradation of OsKAT1 via the 26S proteasome degradation pathway
