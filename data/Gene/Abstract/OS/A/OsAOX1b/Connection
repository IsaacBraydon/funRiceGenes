AOX1a|OsAOX1a	OsAOX1b	Transcript levels of tandem-arranged alternative oxidase genes in rice are increased by low temperature	 The predicted AOX1a and AOX1b precursor proteins consist of 332 and 335 amino acid residues, respectively| Steady-state mRNA levels of both of the genes for AOX1a and AOX1b were increased under low temperature (4 degrees C)| However, no difference in the pattern of induction of transcription between the genes for AOX1a and AOX1b was observed
AOX1a|OsAOX1a	OsAOX1b	Unravelling mitochondrial retrograde regulation in the abiotic stress induction of rice ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE 1 genes	 In this study, we analysed the early abiotic stress response of the rice OsAOX1 genes, and the induction of OsAOX1a and OsAOX1b (OsAOX1a/b) was selected as a working model for the stress-induced MRR studies
