OsAOC	OsOPR1	Targeted Phytohormone Profiling Identifies Potential Regulators of Spikelet Sterility in Rice under Combined Drought and Heat Stress.	 Similarly, in spikelets, increased accumulation of jasmonic acid in AVT2-5315 was correlated with expression of allene oxide cyclase (OsAOC) and 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase 1 (OsOPR1)
