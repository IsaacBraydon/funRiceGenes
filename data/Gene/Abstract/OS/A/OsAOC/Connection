OsAOC|OsAOC1	OsOPR1	Targeted Phytohormone Profiling Identifies Potential Regulators of Spikelet Sterility in Rice under Combined Drought and Heat Stress.	 Similarly, in spikelets, increased accumulation of jasmonic acid in AVT2-5315 was correlated with expression of allene oxide cyclase (OsAOC) and 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase 1 (OsOPR1)
OsAOC|OsAOC1	OsCOI1|OsCOI1a	Warm temperature compromises JA-regulated basal resistance to enhance Magnaporthe oryzae infection in rice.	 Phenotypic analyses of the osaoc1 and osmyc2 mutants, OsCOI1 RNAi lines, and OsMYC2-OE plants further demonstrated that compromised M
