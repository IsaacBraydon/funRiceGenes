OsAOC|OsAOC1	OsOPR1	Targeted Phytohormone Profiling Identifies Potential Regulators of Spikelet Sterility in Rice under Combined Drought and Heat Stress.	 Similarly, in spikelets, increased accumulation of jasmonic acid in AVT2-5315 was correlated with expression of allene oxide cyclase (OsAOC) and 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase 1 (OsOPR1)
OsAOC|OsAOC1	OsCOI1|OsCOI1a	Warm temperature compromises JA-regulated basal resistance to enhance Magnaporthe oryzae infection in rice.	 Phenotypic analyses of the osaoc1 and osmyc2 mutants, OsCOI1 RNAi lines, and OsMYC2-OE plants further demonstrated that compromised M

OsAOC|OsAOC1	OsMADS23	Rice OsPUB16 modulates the &#x27;SAPK9-OsMADS23-OsAOC&#x27; pathway to reduce plant water-deficit tolerance by repressing ABA and JA biosynthesis.	 Further, the ChIP-qPCR analysis and transient transactivation activity assays demonstrated that OsMADS23 activated the expression of JA-biosynthetic gene OsAOC by binding to its promoter
OsAOC|OsAOC1	OsMADS23	Rice OsPUB16 modulates the &#x27;SAPK9-OsMADS23-OsAOC&#x27; pathway to reduce plant water-deficit tolerance by repressing ABA and JA biosynthesis.	 Interestingly, SAPK9-mediated phosphorylation on OsMADS23 reduced its ubiquitination level by interfering with the OsPUB16-OsMADS23 interaction, which thus enhanced OsMADS23 stability and promoted OsAOC expression
