OsAOC	 Further, the retardation in accumulation of ORSs and water were caused by jasmonic acid (JA) deficiency, resulting from down-regulation of OsAOC expression
OsAOC|OsAOC1	 Further, the ChIP-qPCR analysis and transient transactivation activity assays demonstrated that OsMADS23 activated the expression of JA-biosynthetic gene OsAOC by binding to its promoter |  Interestingly, SAPK9-mediated phosphorylation on OsMADS23 reduced its ubiquitination level by interfering with the OsPUB16-OsMADS23 interaction, which thus enhanced OsMADS23 stability and promoted OsAOC expression
