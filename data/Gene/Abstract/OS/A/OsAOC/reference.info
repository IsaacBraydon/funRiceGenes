tpj12115.pdf	Identification of rice Allene Oxide Cyclase mutants and the function of jasmonate for defence against Magnaporthe oryzae	2013	Plant J	Botanical Institute, Molecular Cell Biology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Kaiserstrasse 2, 76131, Karlsruhe, Germany.	Two photomorphogenic mutants of rice, coleoptile photomorphogenesis 2 (cpm2) and hebiba, were found to be defective in the gene encoding allene oxide cyclase (OsAOC) by map-based cloning and complementation assays. Examination of the enzymatic activity of recombinant GST-OsAOC indicated that OsAOC is a functional enzyme that is involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid and related compounds. The level of jasmonate was extremely low in both mutants, in agreement with the fact that rice has only one gene encoding allene oxide cyclase. Several flower-related mutant phenotypes were observed, including morphological abnormalities of the flower and early flowering. We used these mutants to investigate the function of jasmonate in the defence response to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Inoculation assays with fungal spores revealed that both mutants are more susceptible than wild-type to an incompatible strain of M. oryzae, in such a way that hyphal growth was enhanced in mutant tissues. The level of jasmonate isoleucine, a bioactive form of jasmonate, increased in response to blast infection. Furthermore, blast-induced accumulation of phytoalexins, especially that of the flavonoid sakuranetin, was found to be severely impaired in cpm2 and hebiba. Together, the present study demonstrates that, in rice, jasmonate mediates the defence response against blast fungus.
NA	Jasmonic acid deficiency leads to scattered floret opening time in cytoplasmic male sterile rice Zhenshan 97A.	2017	J Exp Bot	College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) rice has been widely used for hybrid rice seed production in China. However, CMS rice suffers from undesirable flowering habits including scattered floret opening time (FOT), which causes different FOTs among parental rice plants and greatly reduces hybrid rice seed production. Little is known about the mechanism of scattered FOT in CMS rice. Our results demonstrate that scattered FOT in CMS rice Zhenshan 97A (ZS97A) resulted from the lack of a driving force to open florets, which was directly caused by retarded lodicule expansion. Our results indicate that retarded lodicule expansion in ZS97A was caused by reduced water accumulation due to retarded accumulation of osmotic regulation substances (ORSs). Further, the retardation in accumulation of ORSs and water were caused by jasmonic acid (JA) deficiency, resulting from down-regulation of OsAOC expression. Applying JA restored scattered FOT in ZS97A by promoting ORS and water accumulation, and inducing the expansion of the lodicules. Taken together, JA deficiency inhibited lodicule expansion by retarding the accumulation of ORSs and water, leading to scattered FOT in CMS rice ZS97A.
NA	CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Gene Editing of the Jasmonate Biosynthesis OsAOC Gene in Rice.	2020	Methods Mol Biol	Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD), Cirad, Universite fe Montpellier, DIADE, Montpellier, France.	The function of Jasmonate (JA) is well documented in different plant physiological processes as well as in the interactions with their environment. Mutants impaired in JA production and/or signaling are useful materials to study the function of this phytohormone. Genes involved in the JA biosynthesis pathway in rice have been described, but few mutants deficient in JA production and signaling have been identified. Moreover, these mutants are mostly generated through random mutagenesis approaches, such as irradiation, EMS treatment, or T-DNA insertion, and potentially harbor undesired mutations that could affect other biological processes. The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a precise and efficient genome editing tool that creates DNA modification at specific loci and limit undesired mutations.In this chapter, we describe a procedure to generate new JA-deficient mutant using CRISPR/Cas9 system in rice. The Allene Oxide Cyclase (OsAOC) gene is targeted since it is a single copy gene in the JA biosynthesis pathway in rice. The widely used variety Oryza sativa japonica Kitaake has been chosen due to its short life cycle and its ease of genetic transformation. This protocol describes the selection of the 20-nt target sequence, construction of the binary vector, and strategy for selecting the T-DNA-free mutant.
NA	Warm temperature compromises JA-regulated basal resistance to enhance Magnaporthe oryzae infection in rice.	2022	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 311400, China.	Changes in global temperatures profoundly affect the occurrence of plant diseases. It is well known that rice blast can easily become epidemic in relatively warm weather. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we show that enhanced blast development at a warm temperature (22°C) compared with the normal growth temperature (28°C) is rice plant-determined. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and signaling genes in rice could be effectively induced by Magnaporthe oryzae at 28°C but not at 22°C. Phenotypic analyses of the osaoc1 and osmyc2 mutants, OsCOI1 RNAi lines, and OsMYC2-OE plants further demonstrated that compromised M. oryzae-induced JA biosynthesis and signaling lead to enhanced blast susceptibility at the warm temperature. Consistent with these results, we found that exogenous application of methyl jasmonate served as an effective strategy for improving blast resistance under the warm environmental conditions. Furthermore, decreased activation of JA signaling resulted in the downregulated expression of some key basal resistance genes at 22°C when compared with 28°C. Among these affected genes, OsCEBiP (chitin elicitor-binding protein precursor) was found to be directly regulated by OsMYB22 and its interacting protein OsMYC2, a key component of JA signaling, and this contributed to temperature-modulated blast resistance. Taken together, these results suggest that warm temperature compromises basal resistance in rice and enhances M. oryzae infection by reducing JA biosynthesis and signaling, providing potential new strategies for managing rice blast disease under warm climate conditions.
NA	Rice OsPUB16 modulates the &#x27;SAPK9-OsMADS23-OsAOC&#x27; pathway to reduce plant water-deficit tolerance by repressing ABA and JA biosynthesis.	2022	PLoS Genet	Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Bioengineering College, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China.	Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis plays crucial roles in plant responses to environmental stress. However, the mechanism by which E3 ubiquitin ligases modulate plant stress response still needs to be elucidated. In this study, we found that rice PLANT U-BOX PROTEIN 16 (OsPUB16), a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase, negatively regulates rice drought response. Loss-of-function mutants of OsPUB16 generated through CRISPR/Cas9 system exhibited the markedly enhanced water-deficit tolerance, while OsPUB16 overexpression lines were hypersensitive to water deficit stress. Moreover, OsPUB16 negatively regulated ABA and JA response, and ospub16 mutants produced more endogenous ABA and JA than wild type when exposed to water deficit. Mechanistic investigations revealed that OsPUB16 mediated the ubiquitination and degradation of OsMADS23, which is the substrate of OSMOTIC STRESS/ABA-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 9 (SAPK9) and increases rice drought tolerance by promoting ABA biosynthesis. Further, the ChIP-qPCR analysis and transient transactivation activity assays demonstrated that OsMADS23 activated the expression of JA-biosynthetic gene OsAOC by binding to its promoter. Interestingly, SAPK9-mediated phosphorylation on OsMADS23 reduced its ubiquitination level by interfering with the OsPUB16-OsMADS23 interaction, which thus enhanced OsMADS23 stability and promoted OsAOC expression. Collectively, our findings establish that OsPUB16 reduces plant water-deficit tolerance by modulating the &#x27;SAPK9-OsMADS23-OsAOC&#x27; pathway to repress ABA and JA biosynthesis.
