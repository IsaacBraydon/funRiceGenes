tpj12115.pdf	Identification of rice Allene Oxide Cyclase mutants and the function of jasmonate for defence against Magnaporthe oryzae	2013	Plant J	Botanical Institute, Molecular Cell Biology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Kaiserstrasse 2, 76131, Karlsruhe, Germany.	Two photomorphogenic mutants of rice, coleoptile photomorphogenesis 2 (cpm2) and hebiba, were found to be defective in the gene encoding allene oxide cyclase (OsAOC) by map-based cloning and complementation assays. Examination of the enzymatic activity of recombinant GST-OsAOC indicated that OsAOC is a functional enzyme that is involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid and related compounds. The level of jasmonate was extremely low in both mutants, in agreement with the fact that rice has only one gene encoding allene oxide cyclase. Several flower-related mutant phenotypes were observed, including morphological abnormalities of the flower and early flowering. We used these mutants to investigate the function of jasmonate in the defence response to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Inoculation assays with fungal spores revealed that both mutants are more susceptible than wild-type to an incompatible strain of M. oryzae, in such a way that hyphal growth was enhanced in mutant tissues. The level of jasmonate isoleucine, a bioactive form of jasmonate, increased in response to blast infection. Furthermore, blast-induced accumulation of phytoalexins, especially that of the flavonoid sakuranetin, was found to be severely impaired in cpm2 and hebiba. Together, the present study demonstrates that, in rice, jasmonate mediates the defence response against blast fungus.
NA	Jasmonic acid deficiency leads to scattered floret opening time in cytoplasmic male sterile rice Zhenshan 97A.	2017	J Exp Bot	College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) rice has been widely used for hybrid rice seed production in China. However, CMS rice suffers from undesirable flowering habits including scattered floret opening time (FOT), which causes different FOTs among parental rice plants and greatly reduces hybrid rice seed production. Little is known about the mechanism of scattered FOT in CMS rice. Our results demonstrate that scattered FOT in CMS rice Zhenshan 97A (ZS97A) resulted from the lack of a driving force to open florets, which was directly caused by retarded lodicule expansion. Our results indicate that retarded lodicule expansion in ZS97A was caused by reduced water accumulation due to retarded accumulation of osmotic regulation substances (ORSs). Further, the retardation in accumulation of ORSs and water were caused by jasmonic acid (JA) deficiency, resulting from down-regulation of OsAOC expression. Applying JA restored scattered FOT in ZS97A by promoting ORS and water accumulation, and inducing the expansion of the lodicules. Taken together, JA deficiency inhibited lodicule expansion by retarding the accumulation of ORSs and water, leading to scattered FOT in CMS rice ZS97A.
