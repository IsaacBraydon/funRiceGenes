OsANN1	growth	A calcium-binding protein, rice annexin OsANN1, enhances heat stress tolerance by modulating the production of H2O2.	 OsANN1-knockdown [RNA interference (RNAi)] plants were more sensitive to heat and drought stresses, whereas OsANN1-overexpression (OE) lines showed improved growth with higher expression of OsANN1 under abiotic stress
OsANN1	growth	A calcium-binding protein, rice annexin OsANN1, enhances heat stress tolerance by modulating the production of H2O2.	 OsANN1 also has calcium-binding and ATPase activities in vitro, indicating that OsANN1 has multiple functions in rice growth

OsANN1	abiotic stress	A calcium-binding protein, rice annexin OsANN1, enhances heat stress tolerance by modulating the production of H2O2.
