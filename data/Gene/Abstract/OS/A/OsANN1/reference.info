NA	A calcium-binding protein, rice annexin OsANN1, enhances heat stress tolerance by modulating the production of H2O2.	2015	J Exp Bot	Hebei Key Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Hebei Normal University, Hebei Collaboration Innovation Center for Cell Signaling, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, 050024, China.	OsANN1 is a member of the annexin protein family in rice. The function of this protein and the mechanisms of its involvement in stress responses and stress tolerance are largely unknown. Here it is reported that OsANN1 confers abiotic stress tolerance by modulating antioxidant accumulation under abiotic stress. OsANN1-knockdown [RNA interference (RNAi)] plants were more sensitive to heat and drought stresses, whereas OsANN1-overexpression (OE) lines showed improved growth with higher expression of OsANN1 under abiotic stress. Overexpression of OsANN1 promoted SOD (superoxide dismutase) and CAT (catalase) activities, which regulate H2O2 content and redox homeostasis, suggesting the existence of a feedback mechanism between OsANN1 and H2O2 production under abiotic stress. Higher expression of OsANN1 can provide overall cellular protection against abiotic stress-induced damage, and a significant accumulation of OsANN1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) signals was found in the cytosol after heat shock treatment. OsANN1 also has calcium-binding and ATPase activities in vitro, indicating that OsANN1 has multiple functions in rice growth. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays demonstrated that OsANN1 interacts with OsCDPK24. This cross-talk may provide additional layers of regulation in the abiotic stress response.
NA	Calcium binding protein OsANN1 regulates rice blast disease resistance by inactivating jasmonic acid signaling.	2023	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology and MOA Key Laboratory for Monitoring and Green Management of Crop Pests, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.	Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most and lipid-binding proteins that have multiple functions; however, the biological roles of annexins in plant disease resistance remain unknown. Here, we report a rice annexin gene, OsANN1 (Rice annexin 1), that was induced by M. oryzae infection and negatively regulated blast disease resistance in rice. By yeast two-hybrid screening, we found that OsANN1 interacted with a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, HAN1 (&quot;HAN&quot; termed &quot;chilling&quot; in Chinese), which has been reported to catalyze the conversion of biologically active jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) to the inactive form 12-hydroxy-JA-Ile (12OH-JA-Ile). Pathogen inoculation assays revealed that HAN1 was also a negative regulator in rice blast resistance. Genetic evidence showed that OsANN1 acts upstream of HAN1. OsANN1 stabilizes HAN1 in planta, resulting in the inactivation of the endogenous biologically active JA-Ile. Taken together, our study unravels a mechanism where an OsANN1-HAN1 module impairs blast disease resistance via inactivating biologically active JA-Ile and JA signaling in rice.
