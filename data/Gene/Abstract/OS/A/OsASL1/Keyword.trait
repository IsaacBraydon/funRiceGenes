OsASL1	root	An appropriate concentration of arginine is required for normal root growth in rice.	 Here, we further characterized OsASL1 in terms of expression pattern, subcellular localization, and arginine effect on the root growth
OsASL1	root	An appropriate concentration of arginine is required for normal root growth in rice.	 Our results indicate that the subcellular localization was determined by the N terminus of OsASL1 and that appropriate concentration of Arg is required for normal root elongation in rice
OsASL1	growth	An appropriate concentration of arginine is required for normal root growth in rice.	 Here, we further characterized OsASL1 in terms of expression pattern, subcellular localization, and arginine effect on the root growth
OsASL1	growth	An appropriate concentration of arginine is required for normal root growth in rice.	1 was expressed in most organs throughout the whole growth period, whereas OsASL1
