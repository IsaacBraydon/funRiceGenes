OsAGO1a	OsAGO1b	Rice MicroRNA effector complexes and targets	Rice (Oryza sativa) encodes four AGO1 homologs (AGO1a, AGO1b, AGO1c, and AGO1d)
OsAGO1a	OsAGO1b	Rice MicroRNA effector complexes and targets	AGO1a, AGO1b, and AGO1c complexes were purified and further characterized
OsAGO1a	OsAGO1c	Rice MicroRNA effector complexes and targets	Rice (Oryza sativa) encodes four AGO1 homologs (AGO1a, AGO1b, AGO1c, and AGO1d)
OsAGO1a	OsAGO1c	Rice MicroRNA effector complexes and targets	AGO1a, AGO1b, and AGO1c complexes were purified and further characterized
OsAGO1a	OsAGO1d	Rice MicroRNA effector complexes and targets	Rice (Oryza sativa) encodes four AGO1 homologs (AGO1a, AGO1b, AGO1c, and AGO1d)
OsAGO1a	OsMIR168a	CRISPR-Cas9 mediated OsMIR168a knockout reveals its pleiotropy in rice.	 Analysis of gene expression showed that the transcription levels of OsMIR168a&#39;s target genes such as OsAGO1a, OsAGO1b and OsAGO1d were elevated significantly in the OsMIR168a mutants
