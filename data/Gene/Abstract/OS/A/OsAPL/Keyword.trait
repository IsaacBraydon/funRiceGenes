OsAPL	leaf	OsAPL controls the nutrient transport systems in the leaf of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	OsAPL controls the nutrient transport systems in the leaf of rice (Oryza sativa L.).
OsAPL	growth	OsAPL controls the nutrient transport systems in the leaf of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	OsAPL positively controls the seedling growth and grain size in rice by targeting the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase-encoding gene, OsRHA1, as well as drastically affects genes encoding H(+)-coupled secondary active transporters
OsAPL	grain	OsAPL controls the nutrient transport systems in the leaf of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	OsAPL positively controls the seedling growth and grain size in rice by targeting the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase-encoding gene, OsRHA1, as well as drastically affects genes encoding H(+)-coupled secondary active transporters
OsAPL	grain	OsAPL controls the nutrient transport systems in the leaf of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Overexpression of OsAPL leads to a 10% increase in grain yield at the heading stage
OsAPL	grain size	OsAPL controls the nutrient transport systems in the leaf of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	OsAPL positively controls the seedling growth and grain size in rice by targeting the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase-encoding gene, OsRHA1, as well as drastically affects genes encoding H(+)-coupled secondary active transporters
OsAPL	seedling	OsAPL controls the nutrient transport systems in the leaf of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	OsAPL positively controls the seedling growth and grain size in rice by targeting the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase-encoding gene, OsRHA1, as well as drastically affects genes encoding H(+)-coupled secondary active transporters
OsAPL	grain yield	OsAPL controls the nutrient transport systems in the leaf of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Overexpression of OsAPL leads to a 10% increase in grain yield at the heading stage
OsAPL	yield	OsAPL controls the nutrient transport systems in the leaf of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Overexpression of OsAPL leads to a 10% increase in grain yield at the heading stage
OsAPL	yield	OsAPL controls the nutrient transport systems in the leaf of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Taken together, our findings suggest the involvement of OsAPL in nutrients transport and crop yield accumulation in rice
OsAPL	transporter	OsAPL controls the nutrient transport systems in the leaf of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Decreased expression of OsAPL leads to a decreased expression level of nutrient transporter genes
OsAPL	plasma membrane	OsAPL controls the nutrient transport systems in the leaf of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	OsAPL positively controls the seedling growth and grain size in rice by targeting the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase-encoding gene, OsRHA1, as well as drastically affects genes encoding H(+)-coupled secondary active transporters
OsAPL	plasma membrane	OsAPL controls the nutrient transport systems in the leaf of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 OsAPL acts as a transcriptional activator of OsRHA1, which encodes a subunit of the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase (primary transporter)
OsAPL	transcriptional activator	OsAPL controls the nutrient transport systems in the leaf of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 OsAPL acts as a transcriptional activator of OsRHA1, which encodes a subunit of the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase (primary transporter)
OsAPL	seedling growth	OsAPL controls the nutrient transport systems in the leaf of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	OsAPL positively controls the seedling growth and grain size in rice by targeting the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase-encoding gene, OsRHA1, as well as drastically affects genes encoding H(+)-coupled secondary active transporters
