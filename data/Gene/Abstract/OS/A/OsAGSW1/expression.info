OsAGSW1	 Expression of OsAGSW1-GFP in rice revealed that OsAGSW1 is localized to the chloroplasts in rice	 Furthermore, OsAGSW1-RNAi and overexpressed transgenic rice lines were generated |  Stable transgenic lines overexpressing OsAGSW1 exhibited a phenotype with a significant increase in grain size, grain weight, grain filling rate and 1000-grain weight compared with the wild-type and RNAi transgenic plants |  Microscopy analysis showed that spikelet hulls just before heading were different in the OsAGSW1-overexpressed plants compared with wild-type and OsAGSW1 RNAi rice |  Further cytological analysis showed that the number of external parenchyma cells in rice hulls of OsAGSW1-overexpressed plants increased, leading to wider and longer spikelet hulls than those of the wild-type and OsAGSW1-RNAi plants
