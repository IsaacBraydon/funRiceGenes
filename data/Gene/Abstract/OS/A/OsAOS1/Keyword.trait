OsAOS1	seedling	Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings	We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots
OsAOS1	seedling	Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings	Our results also indicated that OsAOS1, responding to both light and wounding, is the most highly expressed of all the OsAOSs in seedling shoots
OsAOS1	 ja 	OsMPK3 positively regulates the JA signaling pathway and plant resistance to a chewing herbivore in rice	Silencing OsMPK3 (ir-mpk3) reduced the expression of the gene by 50-70 %, decreased elicited levels of JA and diminished the expression of a lipoxygenase gene OsHI-LOX and an allene oxide synthase gene OsAOS1
OsAOS1	chloroplast	Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings	The analysis of deduced amino acid sequences indicated that only OsAOS1 has a chloroplast transit peptide among all the identified monocot AOSs including OsAOSs
OsAOS1	shoot	Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings	We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots
OsAOS1	shoot	Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings	Our results also indicated that OsAOS1, responding to both light and wounding, is the most highly expressed of all the OsAOSs in seedling shoots
OsAOS1	stem	Both Allene Oxide Synthases Genes Are Involved in the Biosynthesis of Herbivore-Induced Jasmonic Acid and Herbivore Resistance in Rice	 We cloned the two rice AOS genes and observed that the transcript level of both OsAOS1 and OsAOS2 was enhanced by mechanical wounding, the infestation of the striped stem borer (SSB) (Chilo suppressalis) or brown planthopper (BPH) (Niaparvata lugens), and treatment with JA; however, OsAOS1 responded more rapidly to SSB infestation and JA treatment than did OsAOS2
OsAOS1	resistance	Both Allene Oxide Synthases Genes Are Involved in the Biosynthesis of Herbivore-Induced Jasmonic Acid and Herbivore Resistance in Rice	 The antisense expression of OsAOS1 (as-aos1) or OsAOS2 (as-aos2) decreased levels of SSB- or BPH-induced JA, which, in turn, reduced the production of SSB-induced trypsin protease inhibitor (TrypPI) and volatiles as well as the resistance of rice to SSB
OsAOS1	resistance	Both Allene Oxide Synthases Genes Are Involved in the Biosynthesis of Herbivore-Induced Jasmonic Acid and Herbivore Resistance in Rice	 These results indicate that OsAOS1 and OsAOS2 are both involved in herbivore-induced JA biosynthesis and play a vital role in determining the resistance of rice to chewing and phloem-feeding herbivores
OsAOS1	 ja 	Both Allene Oxide Synthases Genes Are Involved in the Biosynthesis of Herbivore-Induced Jasmonic Acid and Herbivore Resistance in Rice	 We cloned the two rice AOS genes and observed that the transcript level of both OsAOS1 and OsAOS2 was enhanced by mechanical wounding, the infestation of the striped stem borer (SSB) (Chilo suppressalis) or brown planthopper (BPH) (Niaparvata lugens), and treatment with JA; however, OsAOS1 responded more rapidly to SSB infestation and JA treatment than did OsAOS2
