OsAOS1	seedling	Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings	 We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots| Our results also indicated that OsAOS1, responding to both light and wounding, is the most highly expressed of all the OsAOSs in seedling shoots
OsAOS1	 ja 	OsMPK3 positively regulates the JA signaling pathway and plant resistance to a chewing herbivore in rice	 Silencing OsMPK3 (ir-mpk3) reduced the expression of the gene by 50-70 %, decreased elicited levels of JA and diminished the expression of a lipoxygenase gene OsHI-LOX and an allene oxide synthase gene OsAOS1
OsAOS1	chloroplast	Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings	 The analysis of deduced amino acid sequences indicated that only OsAOS1 has a chloroplast transit peptide among all the identified monocot AOSs including OsAOSs
OsAOS1	shoot	Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings	 We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots| Our results also indicated that OsAOS1, responding to both light and wounding, is the most highly expressed of all the OsAOSs in seedling shoots
