Allene oxide synthase (AOS) is a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA). We identified four AOS gene homologs, named OsAOS1-4, in the database of a japonica rice genome and cloned a full-length cDNA of OsAOS1. The analysis of deduced amino acid sequences indicated that only OsAOS1 has a chloroplast transit peptide among all the identified monocot AOSs including OsAOSs. We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots. The response in OsAOS1 transcripts occurred rapidly and transiently, while the response in OsAOS4 transcripts was slower and more sustainable; the maximal enhancement was greater in OsAOS1 transcripts than in OsAOS4 transcripts. The transcript of OsAOS1 was also up-regulated transiently in response to wounding, as reported for dicot AOSs. No wound-induced enhancement occurred, however, in OsAOS4 transcripts. Our results also indicated that OsAOS1, responding to both light and wounding, is the most highly expressed of all the OsAOSs in seedling shoots. By using phyA mutants of rice, it was demonstrated that the photoregulation of the AOS transcript level is mediated by phytochrome. It is suggested that this transcriptional photoregulation participates in the phytochrome-mediated inhibition of rice coleoptile growth.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs) are known to play an important role in plant defense by transferring biotic and abiotic signals into programmed cellular responses. However, their functions in the herbivore-induced defense response in rice remain largely unknown. Here, we identified a MPK3 gene from rice, OsMPK3, and found that its expression levels were up-regulated in response to infestation by the larvae of the striped stem borer (SSB) (Chilo suppressalis), to mechanical wounding and to treatment with jasmonic acid (JA), but not to infestation by the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens or to treatment with salicylic acid. Moreover, mechanical wounding and SSB infestation induced the expression of OsMPK3 strongly and quickly, whereas JA treatment induced the gene more weakly and slowly. Silencing OsMPK3 (ir-mpk3) reduced the expression of the gene by 50-70 %, decreased elicited levels of JA and diminished the expression of a lipoxygenase gene OsHI-LOX and an allene oxide synthase gene OsAOS1. The reduced JA signaling in ir-mpk3 plants decreased the levels of herbivore-induced trypsin protease inhibitors (TrypPIs) and improved the performance of SSB larvae, but did not influence BPH. Our findings suggest that the gene OsMPK3 responds early in herbivore-induced defense and can be regulated by rice plants to activate a specific and appropriate defense response to different herbivores.
