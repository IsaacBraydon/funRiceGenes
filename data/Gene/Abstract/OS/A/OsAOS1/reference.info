Allene oxide synthase (AOS) is a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA). We identified four AOS gene homologs, named OsAOS1-4, in the database of a japonica rice genome and cloned a full-length cDNA of OsAOS1. The analysis of deduced amino acid sequences indicated that only OsAOS1 has a chloroplast transit peptide among all the identified monocot AOSs including OsAOSs. We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots. The response in OsAOS1 transcripts occurred rapidly and transiently, while the response in OsAOS4 transcripts was slower and more sustainable; the maximal enhancement was greater in OsAOS1 transcripts than in OsAOS4 transcripts. The transcript of OsAOS1 was also up-regulated transiently in response to wounding, as reported for dicot AOSs. No wound-induced enhancement occurred, however, in OsAOS4 transcripts. Our results also indicated that OsAOS1, responding to both light and wounding, is the most highly expressed of all the OsAOSs in seedling shoots. By using phyA mutants of rice, it was demonstrated that the photoregulation of the AOS transcript level is mediated by phytochrome. It is suggested that this transcriptional photoregulation participates in the phytochrome-mediated inhibition of rice coleoptile growth.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs) are known to play an important role in plant defense by transferring biotic and abiotic signals into programmed cellular responses. However, their functions in the herbivore-induced defense response in rice remain largely unknown. Here, we identified a MPK3 gene from rice, OsMPK3, and found that its expression levels were up-regulated in response to infestation by the larvae of the striped stem borer (SSB) (Chilo suppressalis), to mechanical wounding and to treatment with jasmonic acid (JA), but not to infestation by the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens or to treatment with salicylic acid. Moreover, mechanical wounding and SSB infestation induced the expression of OsMPK3 strongly and quickly, whereas JA treatment induced the gene more weakly and slowly. Silencing OsMPK3 (ir-mpk3) reduced the expression of the gene by 50-70 %, decreased elicited levels of JA and diminished the expression of a lipoxygenase gene OsHI-LOX and an allene oxide synthase gene OsAOS1. The reduced JA signaling in ir-mpk3 plants decreased the levels of herbivore-induced trypsin protease inhibitors (TrypPIs) and improved the performance of SSB larvae, but did not influence BPH. Our findings suggest that the gene OsMPK3 responds early in herbivore-induced defense and can be regulated by rice plants to activate a specific and appropriate defense response to different herbivores.
NA	Cellular localization and detergent dependent oligomerization of rice allene oxide synthase-1.	2014	J Plant Res	Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Kumho Life Science Laboratory, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, 500-757, Republic of Korea.	Allene oxide synthase-1 from Oryza sativa (OsAOS1) localizes to the chloroplast, but lacks a putative chloroplast targeting sequence typically found in dicot AOS. Here, kinetic parameters and the oligomerization state/subunit composition of OsAOS1 were characterized in vitro in the absence or presence of detergent micelles. The catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of OsAOS1 reached a maximum near the critical micelle concentration for polyoxyethylene 10 tridecyl ether. Native gel analysis showed that OsAOS1 exists as a multimer in the absence of detergent micelles. The multimeric form of OsAOS1 was stably cross-linked in the absence of detergents, while only monomeric OsAOS1 was detected in the presence of detergent micelles. Gel filtration analysis indicated that the oligomeric state of OsAOS1 depends strongly on the detergents and that the monomer becomes the predominant form in the presence of detergent micelles. These data suggest that the detergent-dependent oligomeric state of OsAOS1 is an important factor for the regulation of its catalytic efficiency.
NA	Jasmonate regulates juvenile-adult phase transition in rice.	2016	Development	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan ahibarak@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp.	Juvenile-adult phase transition is an important shift for the acquisition of adult vegetative character and subsequent reproductive competence. We identified a recessive precocious (pre) mutant exhibiting long leaf phenotype in rice. The long leaf phenotype is conspicuous in 2nd through 4th leaves that are juvenile and juvenile-adult transition leaves. We found that the morphological and physiological traits such as the midrib formation, shoot meristem size, photosynthetic rate and plastochron in juvenile and juvenile-adult transition stages of pre have precociously acquired adult characters. In agreement with these results, expression patterns of miR156 and miR172, which are microRNAs regulating phase change, support the accelerated juvenile-adult phase change in pre The PRE gene encodes an allene oxide synthase (OsAOS1), which is a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA). pre mutant showed a low level of JA and enhanced sensitivity to gibberellic acid promoting the phase change in some plant species. We also show that prolonged plastochron in pre is caused by the accelerated PLASTOCHRON1 (PLA1) function. The present study reveals a substantial role of JA as a negative regulator of vegetative phase change.
NA	Both Allene Oxide Synthases Genes Are Involved in the Biosynthesis of Herbivore-Induced Jasmonic Acid and Herbivore Resistance in Rice	2021	Plants (Basel)	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology & Ministry of Agriculture Key Lab of Molecular Biology of Crop Pathogens and Insects, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Allene oxide synthase (AOS) is the second enzyme in the biosynthesis of the plant defensive hormone jasmonic acid (JA). In rice, there are two AOSs, OsAOS1 and OsAOS2. However, the role of these two AOS genes in herbivore-induced defenses in rice remains unidentified. We cloned the two rice AOS genes and observed that the transcript level of both OsAOS1 and OsAOS2 was enhanced by mechanical wounding, the infestation of the striped stem borer (SSB) (Chilo suppressalis) or brown planthopper (BPH) (Niaparvata lugens), and treatment with JA; however, OsAOS1 responded more rapidly to SSB infestation and JA treatment than did OsAOS2. The antisense expression of OsAOS1 (as-aos1) or OsAOS2 (as-aos2) decreased levels of SSB- or BPH-induced JA, which, in turn, reduced the production of SSB-induced trypsin protease inhibitor (TrypPI) and volatiles as well as the resistance of rice to SSB. In contrast, BPH preferred to feed and oviposit on wild-type (WT) plants over as-aos1 and as-aos2 plants. Moreover, the survival of BPH nymphs on as-aos1 or as-aos2 lines was significantly lower than on WT plants. The increased resistance of as-aos1 or as-aos2 plants to BPH correlated with higher levels of BPH-induced H2O2 and SA. These results indicate that OsAOS1 and OsAOS2 are both involved in herbivore-induced JA biosynthesis and play a vital role in determining the resistance of rice to chewing and phloem-feeding herbivores.
