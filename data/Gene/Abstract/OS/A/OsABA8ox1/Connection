OsABA8ox1	OsNCED1|OsCCD4a	Phosphorylation of D-allose by hexokinase involved in regulation of OsABF1 expression for growth inhibition in Oryza sativa L	In this study, we discovered that D-allose induced expression of ABA-related genes including OsNCED1-3 and OsABA8ox1-3 in rice
OsABA8ox1	OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	A Rice NAC Transcription Factor Promotes Leaf Senescence via ABA Biosynthesis.	 Moreover, ectopic expression of OsNAC2 leads to an increase in ABA levels via directly upregulating expression of ABA biosynthetic genes (OsNCED3 and OsZEP1) as well as downregulating the ABA catabolic gene (OsABA8ox1)
OsABA8ox1	OsbHLH035|OsbHLH35	The transcription factor OsbHLH035 mediates seed germination and enables seedling recovery from salt stress through ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways, respectively.	 In parallel, abscisic acid (ABA) contents are over-accumulated, and the expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes OsABA2 and OsAAO3 is upregulated; furthermore, compared with that in wild-type (WT) seedlings, the salt-induced expression of OsABA8ox1, an ABA catabolic gene, in germinating Osbhlh035 mutant seeds is downregulated
OsABA8ox1	OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	OsNAC2 Is Involved in Multiple Hormonal Pathways to Mediate Germination of Rice Seeds and Establishment of Seedling	 Moreover, OsNAC2 delays the germination of seeds and coleoptile growth through the ABA pathway instead of the ethylene and GA pathway, by targeting the promoters of OsNCED3, OsZEP1, and OsABA8ox1
OsABA8ox1	OsWRKY53	OsWRKY53 Promotes Abscisic Acid Accumulation to Accelerate Leaf Senescence and Inhibit Seed Germination by Downregulating Abscisic Acid Catabolic Genes in Rice.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation and protoplast transient assays revealed that OsWRKY53 directly bound to the promoters of OsABA8ox1 and OsABA8ox2 to repress their transcription, resulting in elevated endogenous ABA contents that promoted premature leaf senescence in the OsWRKY53-oe plants
OsABA8ox1	OsNR1	NLP2-NR Module Associated NO Is Involved in Regulating Seed Germination in Rice under Salt Stress.	 Transient trans-activation assays further revealed NLP2 can significantly activate the expression of OsABA8ox1 and OsNR1, suggesting that NLP2 activates expression of ABA catabolism gene directly or indirectly via NR-associated NO
OsABA8ox1	OsABA8ox3	Improving pre-harvest sprouting resistance in rice by editing OsABA8ox using CRISPR/Cas9.	 There are three genes that encode ABA8&#x27; hydroxylase in rice, named OsABA8ox1, OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3
OsABA8ox1	OsABA8ox2|OsCYP707A6	Improving pre-harvest sprouting resistance in rice by editing OsABA8ox using CRISPR/Cas9.	 There are three genes that encode ABA8&#x27; hydroxylase in rice, named OsABA8ox1, OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3
