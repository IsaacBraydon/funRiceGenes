OsABA8ox1	OsNCED1|OsCCD4a	Phosphorylation of D-allose by hexokinase involved in regulation of OsABF1 expression for growth inhibition in Oryza sativa L	In this study, we discovered that D-allose induced expression of ABA-related genes including OsNCED1-3 and OsABA8ox1-3 in rice
OsABA8ox1	OsNAC2|OsTIL1|OMTN2|OsORE1	A Rice NAC Transcription Factor Promotes Leaf Senescence via ABA Biosynthesis.	 Moreover, ectopic expression of OsNAC2 leads to an increase in ABA levels via directly upregulating expression of ABA biosynthetic genes (OsNCED3 and OsZEP1) as well as downregulating the ABA catabolic gene (OsABA8ox1)
