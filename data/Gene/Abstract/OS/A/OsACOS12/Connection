OsACOS12	STS1|OsLDDT1|OsSTS1	SWOLLEN TAPETUM AND STERILITY 1 Is Required for Tapetum Degeneration and Pollen Wall Formation in Rice.	 Moreover, STS1 interacts with Polyketide Synthase 2 (OsPKS2) and Acyl-CoA Synthetase 12 (OsACOS12), two enzymes crucial in lipidic sporopollenin biosynthesis in pollen wall formation, suggesting a potentially lipidic metabolon for sporopollenin biosynthesis in rice
OsACOS12	OsTKPR2	OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.	 OsTKPR1 and OsTKPR2 were integrated into a metabolon including OsACOS12 and OsPKS2, which resulted in a significant increased enzymatic efficiency when both OsTKPR1 and OsTKPR2 were present, indicating the mutual dependence of OsTKPR2 and OsTKPR1 for their full biochemical activities
