NA	OsACOS12, an orthologue of Arabidopsis acyl-CoA synthetase5, plays an important role in pollen exine formation and anther development in rice.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	College of Life and Environment Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, 100 Guilin Road, Shanghai, 200234, China.	Sporopollenin is a major component of the pollen exine pattern. In Arabidopsis, acyl-CoA synthetase5 (ACOS5) is involved in sporopollenin precursor biosynthesis. In this study, we identified its orthologue, OsACOS12, in rice (Oryza sativa) and compared the functional conservation of ACOS in rice to Arabidopsis.Sequence analysis showed that OsACOS12 shares 63.9<U+00A0>% amino acid sequence identity with ACOS5. The osacos12 mutation caused by a pre-mature stop codon in LOC_Os04g24530 exhibits defective sexine resulting in a male sterile phenotype in rice. In situ hybridization shows that OsACOS12 is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores at the transcript level. The localization of OsACOS12-GFP demonstrated that OsACOS12 protein is accumulated in tapetal cells and anther locules. OsACOS12 driven by the ACOS5 promoter could partially restore the male fertility of the acos5 mutant in Arabidopsis.OsACOS12 is an orthologue of ACOS5 that is essential for sporopollenin synthesis in rice. ACOS5 and OsACOS12 are conserved for pollen wall formation in monocot and dicot species.
NA	Rice fatty acyl-CoA synthetase OsACOS12 is required for tapetum programmed cell death and male fertility.	2017	Planta	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic and Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University-University of Adelaide Joint Centre for Agriculture and Health, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China.	Loss of function mutation of rice OsACOS12 impairs lipid metabolism-mediated anther cuticle and pollen wall formation, and interferes with tapetum programmed cell death, leading to male sterility. Acyl-CoA Synthetase (ACOS) is one of the enzymes activating fatty acids for various metabolic functions in plants. Here, we show that OsACOS12, an orthologue of Arabidopsis ACOS5 in rice, is crucial for rice fertility. Similar to acos5, osaocs12 mutant had no mature pollen. But unlike acos5, osaocs12 produced defective anthers lacking cutin and Ubisch bodies on the epidermal and inner surfaces, respectively, and delayed programmed cell death (PCD)-induced tapetum degradation. Those phenotypic changes were evident at stage 10, during which OsACOS12 had its maximum expression in tapetal cells and microspores. Chemical analysis revealed that the levels of anther cuticular lipid components (wax and cutin monomers) were significantly reduced in osaocs12, while the expression levels of three known lipid biosynthetic genes were unchanged. Recombinant OsACOS12 enzyme was shown to catalyze the conversion of C18:1 fatty acid to C18:1 CoA in vitro. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that OsACOS12 is an ancient and conserved enzyme associated with the plant's colonization to earth. Collectively, our study suggests that OsACOS12 is an ancient enzyme participating in a conserved metabolic pathway for diversified biochemical functions to secure male reproduction in plants.
