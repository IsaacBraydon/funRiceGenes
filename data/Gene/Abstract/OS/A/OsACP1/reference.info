A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase cDNA was cloned from the rice, Oryza sativa. The cDNA encoding O. sativa acid phosphatase (OsACP1) has 1100 bp with an open reading frame of 274 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of OsACP1 cDNA showed 53% identity to tomato acid phosphatase and 46-50% identity to several other plant phosphatases. OsACP1 expression was up-regulated in the rice plant and in cell culture in the absence of phosphate (Pi). The induced expression of OsACP1 was a specific response to Pi starvation, and was not affected by the deprivation of other nutrients. OsACP1 expression was responsive to the level of Pi supply, with transcripts of OsACP1 being abundant in Pi-deprived root. The OsACP1 cDNA was expressed as a 30 kDa polypeptide in baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells. In addition, the OsACP1 gene was introduced into Arabidopsis via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Functional expression of the OsACP1 gene in the transgenic Arabidopsis lines was confirmed by Northern blot and Western blot analyses, as well as phosphatase activity assays. These results suggest that the OsACP1 gene can be used to develop new transgenic dicotyledonous plants able to adapt to Pi-deficient conditions.
NA	Rice ACID PHOSPHATASE 1 regulates Pi stress adaptation by maintaining intracellular Pi homeostasis.	2021	Plant Cell Environ	Microelement Research Center, College of Resources &amp; Environment, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, P. R. China.	The concentration and homeostasis of intracellular phosphate (Pi) are crucial for sustaining cell metabolism and growth. During short-term Pi starvation, intracellular Pi is maintained relatively constant at the expense of vacuolar Pi. After the vacuolar stored Pi is exhausted, the plant cells induce the synthesis of intracellular acid phosphatase (APase) to recycle Pi from expendable organic phosphate (Po). In this study, the expression, enzymatic activity and subcellular localization of ACID PHOSPHATASE 1 (OsACP1) were determined. OsACP1 expression is specifically induced in almost all cell types of leaves and roots under Pi stress conditions. OsACP1 encodes an acid phosphatase with broad Po substrates and localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus (GA). Phylogenic analysis demonstrates that OsACP1 has a similar structure with human acid phosphatase PHOSPHO1. Overexpression or mutation of OsACP1 affected Po degradation and utilization, which further influenced plant growth and productivity under both Pi-sufficient and Pi-deficient conditions. Moreover, overexpression of OsACP1 significantly affected intracellular Pi homeostasis and Pi starvation signalling. We concluded that OsACP1 is an active acid phosphatase that regulates rice growth under Pi stress conditions by recycling Pi from Po in the ER and GA. This article is protected by copyright.
