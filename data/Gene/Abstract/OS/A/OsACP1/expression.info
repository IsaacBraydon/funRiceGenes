OsACP1	 In this study, the expression, enzymatic activity and subcellular localization of ACID PHOSPHATASE 1 (OsACP1) were determined |  OsACP1 expression is specifically induced in almost all cell types of leaves and roots under Pi stress conditions |  Overexpression or mutation of OsACP1 affected Po degradation and utilization, which further influenced plant growth and productivity under both Pi-sufficient and Pi-deficient conditions |  Moreover, overexpression of OsACP1 significantly affected intracellular Pi homeostasis and Pi starvation signalling	 Overexpression or mutation of OsACP1 affected Po degradation and utilization, which further influenced plant growth and productivity under both Pi-sufficient and Pi-deficient conditions |  Moreover, overexpression of OsACP1 significantly affected intracellular Pi homeostasis and Pi starvation signalling
