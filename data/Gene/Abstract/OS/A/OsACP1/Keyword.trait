OsACP1	phosphate	A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression	 OsACP1 expression was up-regulated in the rice plant and in cell culture in the absence of phosphate (Pi)
OsACP1	root	A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression	 OsACP1 expression was responsive to the level of Pi supply, with transcripts of OsACP1 being abundant in Pi-deprived root
OsACP1	insect	A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression	 The OsACP1 cDNA was expressed as a 30 kDa polypeptide in baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells
OsACP1	 pi 	A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression	 The induced expression of OsACP1 was a specific response to Pi starvation, and was not affected by the deprivation of other nutrients
OsACP1	 pi 	A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression	 OsACP1 expression was responsive to the level of Pi supply, with transcripts of OsACP1 being abundant in Pi-deprived root
