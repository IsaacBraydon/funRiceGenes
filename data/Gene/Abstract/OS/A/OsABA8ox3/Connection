OsABA8ox2|OsCYP707A6	OsABA8ox3	Glucose-induced delay of seed germination in rice is mediated by the suppression of ABA catabolism rather than an enhancement of ABA biosynthesis	Expression of OsABA8ox genes, especially OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3, was sensitively suppressed in the presence of exogenously supplied glucose
OsABA8ox3	OsHIPL1	OsHIPL1, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.	 The higher levels of endogenous ABA were measured in germinating seeds of OsHIPL1 mutants and NIL-qsv3 line compared to IR26 plants, with two up-regulated ABA biosynthesis genes (OsZEP and OsNCED4) and one down-regulated ABA catabolism gene OsABA8ox3
OsABA8ox1	OsABA8ox3	Improving pre-harvest sprouting resistance in rice by editing OsABA8ox using CRISPR/Cas9.	 There are three genes that encode ABA8&#x27; hydroxylase in rice, named OsABA8ox1, OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3
