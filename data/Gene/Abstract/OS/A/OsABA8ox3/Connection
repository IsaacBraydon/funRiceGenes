OsABA8ox2|OsCYP707A6	OsABA8ox3	Glucose-induced delay of seed germination in rice is mediated by the suppression of ABA catabolism rather than an enhancement of ABA biosynthesis	Expression of OsABA8ox genes, especially OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3, was sensitively suppressed in the presence of exogenously supplied glucose
OsABA8ox3	OsHIPL1	OsHIPL1, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.	 The higher levels of endogenous ABA were measured in germinating seeds of OsHIPL1 mutants and NIL-qsv3 line compared to IR26 plants, with two up-regulated ABA biosynthesis genes (OsZEP and OsNCED4) and one down-regulated ABA catabolism gene OsABA8ox3
OsABA8ox1	OsABA8ox3	Improving pre-harvest sprouting resistance in rice by editing OsABA8ox using CRISPR/Cas9.	 There are three genes that encode ABA8&#x27; hydroxylase in rice, named OsABA8ox1, OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3
OsABA8ox2|OsCYP707A6	OsABA8ox3	Improving pre-harvest sprouting resistance in rice by editing OsABA8ox using CRISPR/Cas9.	 There are three genes that encode ABA8&#x27; hydroxylase in rice, named OsABA8ox1, OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3
OsABA8ox3	OsNF-YA3	OsNF-YA3 regulates plant growth and osmotic stress tolerance by interacting with SLR1 and SAPK9 in rice.	 OsNF-YA3 reduces ABA levels by transcriptionally regulating ABA catabolic genes OsABA8ox1 and OsABA8ox3 by binding to their promoters
OsABA8ox3	OsLTPL23	Rice lipid transfer protein, OsLTPL23, controls seed germination by regulating starch-sugar conversion and ABA homeostasis.	 Transcript profiles in the germinating seeds exhibited that the abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive genes, OsABI3 and OsABI5, and biosynthesis genes, OsNCED1, OsNCED2, OsNCED3 and OsNCED4, are obviously upregulated in the osltpl23 mutants compared to NIP plants, conversely, ABA metabolism genes OsABA8ox1, OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3 are stepwise decreased
