OsARF19	 We here report that OsARF19-overexpression rice lines show an enlarged lamina inclination due to increase of its adaxial cell division |  Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrate that OsARF19 binds to the promoter of OsGH3-5 and brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (OsBRI1) directing their expression |  OsGH3-5-overexpression lines show a similar phenotype as OsARF19-O1 |  OsARF19-overexpression lines are sensitive to exogenous BR treatment and alter the expressions of genes related to BR signalling	 We here report that OsARF19-overexpression rice lines show an enlarged lamina inclination due to increase of its adaxial cell division |  OsGH3-5-overexpression lines show a similar phenotype as OsARF19-O1 |  OsARF19-overexpression lines are sensitive to exogenous BR treatment and alter the expressions of genes related to BR signalling
