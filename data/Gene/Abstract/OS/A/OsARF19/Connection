D61|OsBRI1	OsARF19	The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.	The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.
D61|OsBRI1	OsARF19	The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.	Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrate that OsARF19 binds to the promoter of OsGH3-5 and brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (OsBRI1) directing their expression

AET1	OsARF19	Translational Regulation of Plant Response to High Temperature by a Dual Function tRNAHis Guanylyltransferase in Rice.	 Notably, AET1 can directly bind to the OsARF mRNAs including the uORFs of OsARF19 and OsARF23, indicating that AET1 is associated with translation regulation
AET1	OsARF19	Translational Regulation of Plant Response to High Temperature by a Dual Function tRNAHis Guanylyltransferase in Rice.	 Furthermore, polysome profiling assays suggest that the translational status remains unaffected in the aet1 mutant, but that the translational efficiency of OsARF19 and OsARF23 is reduced; moreover, the OsARF23 protein levels are obviously decreased in the aet1 mutant under high temperature, implying that AET1 regulates auxin signaling in response to high temperature
