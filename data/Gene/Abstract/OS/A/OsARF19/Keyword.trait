OsARF19	auxin	The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.	OsARF19 is expressed in various organs including lamina joint and strongly induced by auxin and BR
OsARF19	brassinosteroid	The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.	Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrate that OsARF19 binds to the promoter of OsGH3-5 and brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (OsBRI1) directing their expression
OsARF19	lamina	The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.	OsARF19 is expressed in various organs including lamina joint and strongly induced by auxin and BR
