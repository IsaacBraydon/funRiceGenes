OsAGO1a	OsAGO1d	Rice MicroRNA effector complexes and targets	Rice (Oryza sativa) encodes four AGO1 homologs (AGO1a, AGO1b, AGO1c, and AGO1d)
OsAGO1b	OsAGO1d	Rice MicroRNA effector complexes and targets	Rice (Oryza sativa) encodes four AGO1 homologs (AGO1a, AGO1b, AGO1c, and AGO1d)
OsAGO1c	OsAGO1d	Rice MicroRNA effector complexes and targets	Rice (Oryza sativa) encodes four AGO1 homologs (AGO1a, AGO1b, AGO1c, and AGO1d)
OsAGO1d	OsMIR168a	CRISPR-Cas9 mediated OsMIR168a knockout reveals its pleiotropy in rice.	 Analysis of gene expression showed that the transcription levels of OsMIR168a&#39;s target genes such as OsAGO1a, OsAGO1b and OsAGO1d were elevated significantly in the OsMIR168a mutants
miR2118	OsAGO1d	Mobile ARGONAUTE 1d binds 22-nt miRNAs to generate phasiRNAs important for low-temperature male fertility in rice.	 OsAGO1d binds miR2118 and miR2275 family members and triggers phasiRNA biogenesis; it also binds 21-nt phasiRNAs with a 5&#x27; terminal U
miR2275	OsAGO1d	Mobile ARGONAUTE 1d binds 22-nt miRNAs to generate phasiRNAs important for low-temperature male fertility in rice.	 OsAGO1d binds miR2118 and miR2275 family members and triggers phasiRNA biogenesis; it also binds 21-nt phasiRNAs with a 5&#x27; terminal U
miR2275	OsAGO1d	Mobile ARGONAUTE 1d binds 22-nt miRNAs to generate phasiRNAs important for low-temperature male fertility in rice.	 OsAGO1d protein moves from anther wall cells into meiocytes, where it loads miR2275 to produce 24-nt phasiRNAs
