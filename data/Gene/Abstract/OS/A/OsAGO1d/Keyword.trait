OsAGO1d	temperature	Mobile ARGONAUTE 1d binds 22-nt miRNAs to generate phasiRNAs important for low-temperature male fertility in rice.	 Together, our results show that OsAGO1d acts as a mobile signal to fine-tune phasiRNA production and this function is important for male fertility at low temperature
OsAGO1d	development	Mobile ARGONAUTE 1d binds 22-nt miRNAs to generate phasiRNAs important for low-temperature male fertility in rice.	 Loss of OsAGO1d function causes low-temperature male sterility associated with delayed programmed cell death of tapetal cells during anther development
OsAGO1d	fertility	Mobile ARGONAUTE 1d binds 22-nt miRNAs to generate phasiRNAs important for low-temperature male fertility in rice.	 Together, our results show that OsAGO1d acts as a mobile signal to fine-tune phasiRNA production and this function is important for male fertility at low temperature
OsAGO1d	anther	Mobile ARGONAUTE 1d binds 22-nt miRNAs to generate phasiRNAs important for low-temperature male fertility in rice.	 Loss of OsAGO1d function causes low-temperature male sterility associated with delayed programmed cell death of tapetal cells during anther development
OsAGO1d	anther	Mobile ARGONAUTE 1d binds 22-nt miRNAs to generate phasiRNAs important for low-temperature male fertility in rice.	 OsAGO1d protein moves from anther wall cells into meiocytes, where it loads miR2275 to produce 24-nt phasiRNAs
OsAGO1d	sterility	Mobile ARGONAUTE 1d binds 22-nt miRNAs to generate phasiRNAs important for low-temperature male fertility in rice.	 Loss of OsAGO1d function causes low-temperature male sterility associated with delayed programmed cell death of tapetal cells during anther development
OsAGO1d	cell death	Mobile ARGONAUTE 1d binds 22-nt miRNAs to generate phasiRNAs important for low-temperature male fertility in rice.	 Loss of OsAGO1d function causes low-temperature male sterility associated with delayed programmed cell death of tapetal cells during anther development
OsAGO1d	anther development	Mobile ARGONAUTE 1d binds 22-nt miRNAs to generate phasiRNAs important for low-temperature male fertility in rice.	 Loss of OsAGO1d function causes low-temperature male sterility associated with delayed programmed cell death of tapetal cells during anther development
OsAGO1d	tapetal	Mobile ARGONAUTE 1d binds 22-nt miRNAs to generate phasiRNAs important for low-temperature male fertility in rice.	 Loss of OsAGO1d function causes low-temperature male sterility associated with delayed programmed cell death of tapetal cells during anther development
OsAGO1d	male sterility	Mobile ARGONAUTE 1d binds 22-nt miRNAs to generate phasiRNAs important for low-temperature male fertility in rice.	 Loss of OsAGO1d function causes low-temperature male sterility associated with delayed programmed cell death of tapetal cells during anther development
OsAGO1d	low-temperature	Mobile ARGONAUTE 1d binds 22-nt miRNAs to generate phasiRNAs important for low-temperature male fertility in rice.	 Loss of OsAGO1d function causes low-temperature male sterility associated with delayed programmed cell death of tapetal cells during anther development
OsAGO1d	male fertility	Mobile ARGONAUTE 1d binds 22-nt miRNAs to generate phasiRNAs important for low-temperature male fertility in rice.
