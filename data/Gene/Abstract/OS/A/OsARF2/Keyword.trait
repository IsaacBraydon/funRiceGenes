OsARF2|OsARF4	auxin	Auxin regulates source-sink carbohydrate partitioning and reproductive organ development in rice	We demonstrate that OsARF2 regulates the expression of OsSUT1 through direct binding to the sugar-responsive elements (SuREs) in the OsSUT1 promoter and that OsARF18 represses the expression of OsARF2 and OsSUT1 via direct binding to the auxin-responsive element (AuxRE) or SuRE in their promoters, respectively.
OsARF2|OsARF4	seed-setting	Auxin regulates source-sink carbohydrate partitioning and reproductive organ development in rice	Furthermore, overexpression of OsSUT1 in the dao and Osarf2 mutant backgrounds could largely rescue the spikelets' opening and seed-setting defects.
