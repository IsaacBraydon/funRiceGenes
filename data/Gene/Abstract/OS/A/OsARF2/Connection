OsARF2|OsARF4	OsIAA10	Control of grain size in rice by TGW3 phosphorylation of OsIAA10 through potentiation of OsIAA10-OsARF4-mediated auxin signaling.	 Phosphorylation of OsIAA10 facilitates its interaction with OsTIR1 and subsequent destabilization, but this modification hinders its interaction with OsARF4
