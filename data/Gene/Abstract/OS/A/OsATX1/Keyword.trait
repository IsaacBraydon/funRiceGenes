OsATX1	leaf	OsATX1 Interacts with Heavy Metal P1B-type ATPases and Affects Copper Transport and Distribution.	 At the reproductive stage, the concentrations of Cu in developing tissues, including panicles, upper nodes and internodes, younger leaf blades, and leaf sheaths of the main tiller, were significantly increased in OsATX1-overexpressing plants and decreased in osatx1 mutants compared to that in wild type
OsATX1	root	OsATX1 Interacts with Heavy Metal P1B-type ATPases and Affects Copper Transport and Distribution.	 Knocking out OsATX1 resulted in increased Cu concentrations in roots, whereas OsATX1 overexpression reduced root Cu concentrations but increased Cu accumulation in the shoots
OsATX1	tolerance	OsATX1 Interacts with Heavy Metal P1B-type ATPases and Affects Copper Transport and Distribution.	 In addition, heterologous expression of OsATX1 in the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cadmium (Cd)-sensitive mutant ¦¤ycf1 increased the tolerance to Cu and Cd by decreasing their respective concentrations in the transformed yeast cells
OsATX1	reproductive	OsATX1 Interacts with Heavy Metal P1B-type ATPases and Affects Copper Transport and Distribution.	 At the reproductive stage, the concentrations of Cu in developing tissues, including panicles, upper nodes and internodes, younger leaf blades, and leaf sheaths of the main tiller, were significantly increased in OsATX1-overexpressing plants and decreased in osatx1 mutants compared to that in wild type
OsATX1	homeostasis	OsATX1 Interacts with Heavy Metal P1B-type ATPases and Affects Copper Transport and Distribution.	 These results suggest that OsATX1 may function to deliver Cu to heavy metal P1B-ATPases for Cu trafficking and distribution in order to maintain Cu homeostasis in different rice tissues
OsATX1	cadmium	OsATX1 Interacts with Heavy Metal P1B-type ATPases and Affects Copper Transport and Distribution.	 In addition, heterologous expression of OsATX1 in the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cadmium (Cd)-sensitive mutant ¦¤ycf1 increased the tolerance to Cu and Cd by decreasing their respective concentrations in the transformed yeast cells
OsATX1	copper	OsATX1 Interacts with Heavy Metal P1B-type ATPases and Affects Copper Transport and Distribution.	OsATX1 Interacts with Heavy Metal P1B-type ATPases and Affects Copper Transport and Distribution.
