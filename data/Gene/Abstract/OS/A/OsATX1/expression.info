OsATX1	 Knocking out OsATX1 resulted in increased Cu concentrations in roots, whereas OsATX1 overexpression reduced root Cu concentrations but increased Cu accumulation in the shoots |  In addition, heterologous expression of OsATX1 in the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cadmium (Cd)-sensitive mutant ¦¤ycf1 increased the tolerance to Cu and Cd by decreasing their respective concentrations in the transformed yeast cells	 Knocking out OsATX1 resulted in increased Cu concentrations in roots, whereas OsATX1 overexpression reduced root Cu concentrations but increased Cu accumulation in the shoots
