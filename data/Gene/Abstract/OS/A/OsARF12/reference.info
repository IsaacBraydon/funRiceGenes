However, the mechanism of controlling RSA remains largely unclear. Here, we found a limiting factor of RSA--OsARF12--an auxin response factor whose knockout led to decreased primary root length in rice (Oryza sativa). * OsARF12 as a transcription activator can facilitate the expression of the auxin response element DR5::GFP, and OsARF12 was inhibited by osa-miRNA167d by transient expression in tobacco and rice callus. * The root elongation zones of osarf12 and osarf12/25, which had lower auxin concentrations, were distinctly shorter than for the wild-type, possibly as a result of decreased expression of auxin synthesis genes OsYUCCAs and auxin efflux carriers OsPINs and OsPGPs. The knockout of OsARF12 also altered the abundance of mitochondrial iron-regulated (OsMIR), iron (Fe)-regulated transporter1 (OsIRT1) and short postembryonic root1 (OsSPR1) in roots of rice, and resulted in lower Fe content. * The data provide evidence for the biological function of OsARF12, which is implicated in regulating root elongation. Our investigation contributes a novel insight for uncovering regulation of RSA and the relationship between auxin response and Fe acquisition.
nph12499.pdf	Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa)	2014	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Phosphorus (P) is crucial nutrient element for crop growth and development. However, the network pathway regulating homeostasis of phosphate (Pi) in crops has many molecular breeding unknowns. Here, we report that an auxin response factor, OsARF12, functions in Pi homeostasis. Measurement of element content, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis and acid phosphatases (APases) activity assay showed that the osarf12 mutant and osarf12/25 double mutant with P-intoxicated phenotypes had higher P concentrations, up-regulation of the Pi transporter encoding genes and increased APase activity under Pi-sufficient/-deficient (+Pi/-Pi, 0.32/0 mM NaH2 PO4) conditions. Transcript analysis revealed that Pi-responsive genes--Phosphate starvation (OsIPS)1 and OsIPS2, SYG1/Pho81/XPR1(OsSPX1), Sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2 (OsSQD2), R2R3 MYB transcription factor (OsMYB2P-1) and Transport Inhibitor Response1 (OsTIR1)--were more abundant in the osarf12 and osarf12/25 mutants under +Pi/-Pi conditions. Knockout of OsARF12 also influenced the transcript abundances of the OsPHR2 gene and its downstream components, such as OsMiR399j, OsPHO2, OsMiR827, OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2. Results from -Pi/1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) treatments, and auxin reporter DR5::GUS staining suggest that root system alteration and Pi-induced auxin response were at least partially controlled by OsARF12. These findings enrich our understanding of the biological functions of OsARF12, which also acts in regulating Pi homeostasis.
NA	Osa-miR167d facilitates infection of Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.	2019	J Integr Plant Biol	Rice Research Institute and Key Lab for Major Crop Diseases, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in rice response to Magnaporthe oryzae, the causative agent of rice blast disease. Studying the roles of rice miRNAs is of great significance for the disease control. Osa-miR167d belongs to a conserved miRNA family targeting auxin responsive factor (ARF) genes that act in developmental and stress-induced responses. Here, we show that Osa-miR167d plays a negative role in rice immunity against M. oryzae by suppressing its target gene. The expression of Osa-miR167d was significantly suppressed in a resistant accession at and after 24 hours post inoculation (hpi), however, its expression was significantly increased at 24 hpi in the susceptible accession upon M. oryzae infection. Transgenic rice lines over-expressing Osa-miR167d were highly susceptible to multiple blast fungal strains. By contrast, transgenic lines expressing a target mimicry to block Osa-miR167d enhanced resistance to rice blast disease. In addition, knocking out the target gene ARF12 led to hyper-susceptibility to multiple blast fungal strains. Taken together, our results indicate that Osa-miR167d negatively regulate rice immunity to facilitate the infection of M. oryzae by down-regulating ARF12. Thus, Osa-miR167d-ARF12 regulatory module could be valuable in improvement of blast-disease resistance.
NA	Rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR7 Modulates Plant Architecture through Regulating GA and IAA Metabolism	2020	Plant Physiol	Wuhan University CITY: Wuhan STATE: Hubei China [CN].	Plant-specific GROWTH-REGULATING FACTORs (GRFs) participate in central developmental processes, including leaf and root development; inflorescence, flower and seed formation; senescence; and tolerance to stresses. In rice (Oryza sativa), there are 12 GRFs, but the role of the miR396-OsGRF7 regulatory module remains unknown. Here, we report that OsGRF7 shapes plant architecture via the regulation of auxin and gibberellin metabolism in rice. OsGRF7 is mainly expressed in lamina joints, nodes, internodes, axillary buds, and young inflorescences. Overexpression of OsGRF7 causes a semidwarf and compact plant architecture with an increased culm wall thickness and narrowed leaf angles mediated by shortened cell length, altered cell arrangement, and increased parenchymal cell layers in the culm and adaxial side of the lamina joints. Knock-out and knock-down lines of OsGRF7 exhibit contrasting phenotypes with severe degradation of parenchymal cells in the culm and lamina joints at maturity. Further analysis indicated that OsGRF7 binds the ACRGDA motif in the promoters of Cytochrome P450 gene (OsCYP714B1) and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 12 (OsARF12), which are involved in the gibberellin synthesis and auxin signaling pathways, respectively. Correspondingly, OsGRF7 alters the contents of endogenous gibberellins and auxins and sensitivity to exogenous phytohormones. These findings establish OsGRF7 as a crucial component in the OsmiR396-OsGRF-plant hormone regulatory network that controls rice plant architecture. 
NA	Auxin response factors (ARFs) differentially regulate rice antiviral immune response against rice dwarf virus	2021	PLoS Pathog	The State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.	There are 25 auxin response factors (ARFs) in the rice genome, which play critical roles in regulating myriad aspects of plant development, but their role (s) in host antiviral immune defense and the underneath mechanism remain largely unknown. By using the rice-rice dwarf virus (RDV) model system, here we report that auxin signaling enhances rice defense against RDV infection. In turn, RDV infection triggers increased auxin biosynthesis and accumulation in rice, and that treatment with exogenous auxin reduces OsIAA10 protein level, thereby unleashing a group of OsIAA10-interacting OsARFs to mediate downstream antiviral responses. Strikingly, our genetic data showed that loss-of-function mutants of osarf12 or osarf16 exhibit reduced resistance whereas osarf11 mutants display enhanced resistance to RDV. In turn, OsARF12 activates the down-stream OsWRKY13 expression through direct binding to its promoter, loss-of-function mutants of oswrky13 exhibit reduced resistance. These results demonstrated that OsARF 11, 12 and 16 differentially regulate rice antiviral defense. Together with our previous discovery that the viral P2 protein stabilizes OsIAA10 protein via thwarting its interaction with OsTIR1 to enhance viral infection and pathogenesis, our results reveal a novel auxin-IAA10-ARFs-mediated signaling mechanism employed by rice and RDV for defense and counter defense responses.
NA	The miR167-OsARF12 module regulates grain filling and grain size downstream of miR159.	2023	Plant Commun	Collaborative Innovation Center of Henan Grain Crops, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450002, China; Key Laboratory of Rice Biology in Henan Province, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450002, China; Henan Engineering Laboratory of Rice, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450002, China.	Grain weight and quality are always determined by the grain filling. Plant miRNAs have drawn attention as key targets for regulating grain size and yield. Yet the mechanisms underlying the regulation of grain size are largely unclear due to the complex networks controlling this trait. Our earlier studies proved that the suppressed expression of miR167 (STTM/MIM167) substantially increased grain weight. In a field test, the increased yield up to 12.90%-21.94% due to the significantly enhanced grain filling rate. Biochemical and genetic analyses reveal the regulatory effects of miR159 on miR167 expression. Further analysis indicates that OsARF12 is the major mediator of miR167 in regulating rice grain filling. Expectedly, over expressing OsARF12 could resemble the phenotype of STTM/MIM167 plants with respect to grain weight and grain filling rate. Upon in-depth analysis, we found that OsARF12 activates OsCDKF;2 expressions by directly binding to the TGTCGG motif in the promoter region. Flow cytometric analysis in young panicles of plants overexpressing OsARF12 and cell number examination of cdkf;2 mutants verify that OsARF12 positively regulates grain filling and grain size by targeting OsCDKF;2. Moreover, RNA-seq result suggests that miR167-OsARF12 module is involved in the cell development process and hormone pathways. Additionally, plants overexpressing OsARF12 or cdkf;2 mutants present enhanced or reduced sensitivity to exogenous auxin and brassinosteroid (BR) treatments, confirming that OsCDKF;2 targeting by OsARF12 mediates auxin and BR signaling. Our results reveal that miR167-OsARF12 module works downstream of miR159 to regulate rice grain filling and grain size by OsCDKF;2 through controlling cell division and mediating auxin and BR signals.
