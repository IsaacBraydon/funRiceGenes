However, the mechanism of controlling RSA remains largely unclear. Here, we found a limiting factor of RSA--OsARF12--an auxin response factor whose knockout led to decreased primary root length in rice (Oryza sativa). * OsARF12 as a transcription activator can facilitate the expression of the auxin response element DR5::GFP, and OsARF12 was inhibited by osa-miRNA167d by transient expression in tobacco and rice callus. * The root elongation zones of osarf12 and osarf12/25, which had lower auxin concentrations, were distinctly shorter than for the wild-type, possibly as a result of decreased expression of auxin synthesis genes OsYUCCAs and auxin efflux carriers OsPINs and OsPGPs. The knockout of OsARF12 also altered the abundance of mitochondrial iron-regulated (OsMIR), iron (Fe)-regulated transporter1 (OsIRT1) and short postembryonic root1 (OsSPR1) in roots of rice, and resulted in lower Fe content. * The data provide evidence for the biological function of OsARF12, which is implicated in regulating root elongation. Our investigation contributes a novel insight for uncovering regulation of RSA and the relationship between auxin response and Fe acquisition.
nph12499.pdf	Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa)	2014	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Phosphorus (P) is crucial nutrient element for crop growth and development. However, the network pathway regulating homeostasis of phosphate (Pi) in crops has many molecular breeding unknowns. Here, we report that an auxin response factor, OsARF12, functions in Pi homeostasis. Measurement of element content, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis and acid phosphatases (APases) activity assay showed that the osarf12 mutant and osarf12/25 double mutant with P-intoxicated phenotypes had higher P concentrations, up-regulation of the Pi transporter encoding genes and increased APase activity under Pi-sufficient/-deficient (+Pi/-Pi, 0.32/0 mM NaH2 PO4) conditions. Transcript analysis revealed that Pi-responsive genes--Phosphate starvation (OsIPS)1 and OsIPS2, SYG1/Pho81/XPR1(OsSPX1), Sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2 (OsSQD2), R2R3 MYB transcription factor (OsMYB2P-1) and Transport Inhibitor Response1 (OsTIR1)--were more abundant in the osarf12 and osarf12/25 mutants under +Pi/-Pi conditions. Knockout of OsARF12 also influenced the transcript abundances of the OsPHR2 gene and its downstream components, such as OsMiR399j, OsPHO2, OsMiR827, OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2. Results from -Pi/1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) treatments, and auxin reporter DR5::GUS staining suggest that root system alteration and Pi-induced auxin response were at least partially controlled by OsARF12. These findings enrich our understanding of the biological functions of OsARF12, which also acts in regulating Pi homeostasis.
NA	Osa-miR167d facilitates infection of Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.	2019	J Integr Plant Biol	Rice Research Institute and Key Lab for Major Crop Diseases, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in rice response to Magnaporthe oryzae, the causative agent of rice blast disease. Studying the roles of rice miRNAs is of great significance for the disease control. Osa-miR167d belongs to a conserved miRNA family targeting auxin responsive factor (ARF) genes that act in developmental and stress-induced responses. Here, we show that Osa-miR167d plays a negative role in rice immunity against M. oryzae by suppressing its target gene. The expression of Osa-miR167d was significantly suppressed in a resistant accession at and after 24 hours post inoculation (hpi), however, its expression was significantly increased at 24 hpi in the susceptible accession upon M. oryzae infection. Transgenic rice lines over-expressing Osa-miR167d were highly susceptible to multiple blast fungal strains. By contrast, transgenic lines expressing a target mimicry to block Osa-miR167d enhanced resistance to rice blast disease. In addition, knocking out the target gene ARF12 led to hyper-susceptibility to multiple blast fungal strains. Taken together, our results indicate that Osa-miR167d negatively regulate rice immunity to facilitate the infection of M. oryzae by down-regulating ARF12. Thus, Osa-miR167d-ARF12 regulatory module could be valuable in improvement of blast-disease resistance.
