OsARF12	 In turn, OsARF12 activates the down-stream OsWRKY13 expression through direct binding to its promoter, loss-of-function mutants of oswrky13 exhibit reduced resistance
OsARF12	 Upon in-depth analysis, we found that OsARF12 activates OsCDKF;2 expressions by directly binding to the TGTCGG motif in the promoter region
