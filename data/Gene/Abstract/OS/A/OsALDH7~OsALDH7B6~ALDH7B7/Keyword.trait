OsALDH7|OsALDH7B6|ALDH7B7	seed development	Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability	These pigments started to accumulate in the late seed developmental stage, the time when OsALDH7 expression began to increase significantly
OsALDH7|OsALDH7B6|ALDH7B7	endosperm	Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability	Interestingly, endosperms from the osaldh7 null mutants accumulated brown pigments during desiccation and storage
OsALDH7|OsALDH7B6|ALDH7B7	blast	Molecular cloning and differential expression of an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene in rice leaves in response to infection by blast fungus	Using diï¬€erential display RT-PCR and cDNA library screening, a full-length aldehyde dehydrogenase cDNA (ALDH7B7) was isolated from rice leaves infected by incompatible race of blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea
OsALDH7|OsALDH7B6|ALDH7B7	blast	Molecular cloning and differential expression of an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene in rice leaves in response to infection by blast fungus	ALDH7B7 expression was induced by blast fungus infection, ultraviolet, mechanical wound in rice leaves and was not detected in untreated rice organs
OsALDH7|OsALDH7B6|ALDH7B7	blast	Molecular cloning and differential expression of an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene in rice leaves in response to infection by blast fungus	The function of ALDH7B7 in the interaction process between blast fungus and rice is discussed

OsALDH7|OsALDH7B6|ALDH7B7	seed	Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability	These results suggest that OsALDH7 is involved in removing various aldehydes formed by oxidative stress during seed desiccation
OsALDH7|OsALDH7B6|ALDH7B7	seed	Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability	These data imply that OsALDH7 plays an important role in maintaining seed viability by detoxifying the aldehydes generated by lipid peroxidation
OsALDH7|OsALDH7B6|ALDH7B7	endosperm	Mutation of OsALDH7 causes a yellow-colored endosperm associated with accumulation of oryzamutaic acid A in rice	Here we reported a mutant with yellow-colored endosperm in rice, and showed that the yellow endosperm was caused by mutation of OsALDH7
