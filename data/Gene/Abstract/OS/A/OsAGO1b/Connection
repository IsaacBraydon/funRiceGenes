OsAGO1a	OsAGO1b	Rice MicroRNA effector complexes and targets	Rice (Oryza sativa) encodes four AGO1 homologs (AGO1a, AGO1b, AGO1c, and AGO1d)
OsAGO1a	OsAGO1b	Rice MicroRNA effector complexes and targets	AGO1a, AGO1b, and AGO1c complexes were purified and further characterized
OsAGO1b	OsAGO1c	Rice MicroRNA effector complexes and targets	Rice (Oryza sativa) encodes four AGO1 homologs (AGO1a, AGO1b, AGO1c, and AGO1d)
OsAGO1b	OsAGO1c	Rice MicroRNA effector complexes and targets	AGO1a, AGO1b, and AGO1c complexes were purified and further characterized
OsAGO1b	OsAGO1d	Rice MicroRNA effector complexes and targets	Rice (Oryza sativa) encodes four AGO1 homologs (AGO1a, AGO1b, AGO1c, and AGO1d)
OsAGO1b	OSHB3|OsHox33	Overexpression of OsAGO1b Induces Adaxially Rolled Leaves by Affecting Leaf Abaxial Sclerenchymatous Cell Development in Rice.	 The mRNA distribution patterns of OSHB3 and OsARF4 in leaves remained almost unchanged between ZH11 and OsAGO1b overexpression lines, but their expression levels were enhanced at the regions of vascular bundles and sclerenchymatous cell differentiation
