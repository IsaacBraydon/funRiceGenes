Anuradha-2012-Mapping QTLs and can.pdf	Mapping QTLs and candidate genes for iron and zinc concentrations in unpolished rice of MadhukarxSwarna RILs	2012	Gene	Directorate of Rice Research, Hyderabad, India.	Identifying QTLs/genes for iron and zinc in rice grains can help in biofortification programs. 168 F(7) RILs derived from MadhukarxSwarna were used to map QTLs for iron and zinc concentrations in unpolished rice grains. Iron ranged from 0.2 to 224 ppm and zinc ranged from 0.4 to 104ppm. Genome wide mapping using 101 SSRs and 9 gene specific markers showed 5 QTLs on chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 7 and 12 significantly linked to iron, zinc or both. In all, 14 QTLs were identified for these two traits. QTLs for iron were co-located with QTLs for zinc on chromosomes 7 and 12. In all, ten candidate genes known for iron and zinc homeostasis underlie 12 of the 14 QTLs. Another 6 candidate genes were close to QTLs on chromosomes 3, 5 and 7. Thus the high priority candidate genes for high Fe and Zn in seeds are OsYSL1 and OsMTP1 for iron, OsARD2, OsIRT1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2 for zinc and OsNAS3, OsNRAMP1, Heavy metal ion transport and APRT for both iron and zinc together based on our genetic mapping studies as these genes strictly underlie QTLs. Several elite lines with high Fe, high Zn and both were identified.
J. Exp. Bot.-2006-Ogo-2867-78.pdf	Isolation and characterization of IRO2, a novel iron-regulated bHLH transcription factor in graminaceous plants	2006	J Exp Bot	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	To clarify the molecular mechanism that regulates iron (Fe) acquisition in graminaceous plants, a time-course analysis of gene expression during Fe deficiency stress was conducted using a rice 22K oligo-DNA microarray. Twenty-one genes for proteins that function in gene regulation were induced by Fe deficiency. Of these genes, a putative basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor gene, named OsIRO2, was strongly expressed in both roots and shoots during Fe deficiency stress. The expression of OsIRO2 was induced exclusively by Fe deficiency, and not by deficiencies in other metals. Expression of the barley HvIRO2 gene, which is a homologue of OsIRO2, was also induced by Fe deficiency. An in silico search revealed that IRO2 is highly conserved among graminaceous plants, which include wheat, sorghum, and maize. The cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CASTing) technique revealed that OsIRO2 bound preferentially to the sequence 5'-ACCACGTGGTTTT-3', and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed 5'-CACGTGG-3' as the core sequence for OsIRO2 binding. Sequences similar to the OsIRO2-binding sequence were found upstream of several genes that are involved in Fe acquisition, such as OsNAS1, OsNAS3, OsIRT1, OsFDH, OsAPT1, and IDS3. The core sequence of the OsIRO2-binding sequence occurred more frequently in the upstream regions of Fe deficiency-inducible genes than in the corresponding regions of non-inducible genes. These results suggest that IRO2 is involved in the regulation of gene expression under Fe-deficient conditions.
Kobayashi-2005-Expression of iron-a.pdf	Expression of iron-acquisition-related genes in iron-deficient rice is co-ordinately induced by partially conserved iron-deficiency-responsive elements	2005	J Exp Bot	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) utilize the iron chelators known as mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs) to acquire iron from the rhizosphere. Synthesis of MAs and uptake of MA-chelated iron are strongly induced under conditions of iron deficiency. Microarray analysis was used to characterize the expression profile of rice in response to iron deficiency at the genomic level. mRNA extracted from iron-deficient or iron-sufficient rice roots or leaves was hybridized to a rice array containing 8987 cDNA clones. An induction ratio of greater than 2.0 in roots was observed for 57 genes, many of which are involved in iron-uptake mechanisms, including every identified or predicted step in the methionine cycle and the biosynthesis of MAs from methionine. Northern analysis confirmed that the expression of genes encoding every step in the methionine cycle is thoroughly induced by iron deficiency in roots, and almost thoroughly induced in leaves. A promoter search revealed that the iron-deficiency-induced genes related to iron uptake possessed sequences homologous to the iron-deficiency-responsive cis-acting elements IDE1 and IDE2 in their promoter regions, at a higher rate than that showing no induction under Fe deficiency. These results suggest that rice genes involved in iron acquisition are co-ordinately regulated by conserved mechanisms in response to iron deficiency, in which IDE-mediated regulation plays a significant role.
pce2569.pdf	Identification of OsbHLH133 as a regulator of iron distribution between roots and shoots in Oryza sativa	2013	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry Joint Research Laboratory in Genomics and Nutriomics, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient element for plant growth. Regulation of Fe-deficiency signalling networks is one of the many functions reported for basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors in plants. In the present study, OsbHLH133 was found to be induced by Fe-deficiency conditions in Oryza sativa. Insertional inactivation of OsbHLH133 (bhlh133) resulted in growth retardation, with enhanced Fe concentration seen in shoots, and reduced Fe concentration in roots. Overexpression of OsbHLH133 had the opposite effect, that is resulted in an enhanced Fe concentration in roots and reduced Fe concentration in shoots and also in xylem sap. Microarray analysis showed that some of the genes encoding Fe-related functions were up-regulated under Fe-sufficient conditions, in bhlh133 mutant plants compared to wild-type plants. Significant differential expression of a number of signalling pathways, including calcium signalling, was also seen in bhlh133 plants compared to wild-type plants, independent of Fe conditions.
