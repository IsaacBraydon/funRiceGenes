OsAPL2|osagpl2-3	endosperm	Phenotypic and Candidate Gene Analysis of a New Floury Endosperm Mutant (osagpl2-3) in Rice	A floury endosperm mutant, osagpl2-3, was isolated from the M2 generation of japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare following ethyl methane sulfonate mutagenesis
OsAPL2|osagpl2-3	endosperm	Phenotypic and Candidate Gene Analysis of a New Floury Endosperm Mutant (osagpl2-3) in Rice	 The osagpl2-3 mutant produced a white-core endosperm compared to the transparent endosperm of the wild type (WT)
OsAPL2|osagpl2-3	endosperm	Phenotypic and Candidate Gene Analysis of a New Floury Endosperm Mutant (osagpl2-3) in Rice	Phenotypic and Candidate Gene Analysis of a New Floury Endosperm Mutant (osagpl2-3) in Rice
OsAPL2|osagpl2-3	temperature	Phenotypic and Candidate Gene Analysis of a New Floury Endosperm Mutant (osagpl2-3) in Rice	" The analysis for cooking and nutrition quality traits indicated that the values of gel consistency, gelatinization temperature, and rapid viscosity analysis profile of osagpl2-3 grains were lower than those of the WT"
OsAPL2|osagpl2-3	seed development	Gene expression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch contents in rice cultured cells are cooperatively regulated by sucrose and ABA	 OsAPL3 was predominantly expressed in the middle phases of seed development, and OsAPS1, OsAPL1 and OsAPL2 were expressed later in seed development
OsAPL2|osagpl2-3	starch	Phenotypic and Candidate Gene Analysis of a New Floury Endosperm Mutant (osagpl2-3) in Rice	 The results from scanning electron microscope showed that the osagpl2-3 mutant grains comprised of round and loosely packed starch granules, some of which were compounded
