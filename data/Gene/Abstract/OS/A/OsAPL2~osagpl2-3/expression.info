Symbol	Expression
OsAPL2|osagpl2-3|OsAGPL2	 The defect in OsAGPL2 enhanced the expression levels of the AGPase family |  Moreover, the expression of OsAGPL2 and its counterpart, OsAGPS2b, was highly coordinated in rice endosperm
OsAPL2|osagpl2-3|OsAGPL2|GIF2	 This reflected the unanticipated expression of both OsAPL2 and OsAPS2b in the leaves, generating a complete ectopic AGPase in the leaf cytosol, and a corresponding decrease in the expression of the plastidial small subunit OsAPS2a that was only partially complemented by an increase in the expression of OsAPS1
