NA	Overexpression of rice gene OsATG8b confers tolerance to nitrogen starvation and increases yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in Arabidopsis.	2019	PLoS One	Rice Research Institute of Shenyang Agricultural University, Key Laboratory of Northern Japonica Rice Genetics and Breeding, Ministry of Education and Liaoning Province, Key Laboratory of Northeast Rice Biology and Genetics and Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture, Shenyang, China.	Nitrogen (N) is an important element required for plant growth and development, which also affects plant yield and quality. Autophagy, a conserved pathway in eukaryotes, degrades and recycles cellular components, thus playing an important role in N remobilization. However, only a few autophagy genes related to N remobilization in rice (Oryza sativa) have been reported. Here, we identified a core autophagy gene in rice, OsATG8b, with increased expression levels under N starvation conditions. It was investigated the function of OsATG8b by generating three independent homozygous 35S-OsATG8b transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines. The overexpression of OsATG8b significantly enhanced autophagic flux in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants. It was also showed that over-expressing OsATG8b promoted growth and development of Arabidopsis, in which the rosette leaves were larger than those of the wild type (WT), and the yield increased significantly by 25.25%. In addition, the transgenic lines accumulated more N in seeds than in the rosette leaves. Further examination revealed that overexpression of OsATG8b could effectively alleviate the growth inhibition of transgenic Arabidopsis under nitrogen (N) stress. N partitioning studies revealed that nitrogen-harvest index (NHI) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) were significantly increased in the transgenic Arabidopsis, as well as the 15N-tracer experiments revealing that the remobilization of N to seeds in the OsATG8b-overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis was high and more than WT. Based on our findings, we consider OsATG8b to be a great candidate gene to increase NUE and yield, especially under suboptimal field conditions.
NA	A Rice Autophagy Gene OsATG8b Is Involved in Nitrogen Remobilization and Control  of Grain Quality.	2020	Front Plant Sci	School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China.	Enhancing nitrogen (N) use efficiency is a potential way to reduce excessive nitrogen application and increase yield. Autophagy is a conserved degradation system in the evolution of eukaryotic cells and plays an important role in plant  development and stress response. Autophagic cores have two conjugation pathways that attach the product of autophagy-related gene 8 (ATG8) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and ATG5 to ATG12, respectively, which then help with vesicle elongation and enclosure. Rice has six ATG8 genes, which have not been functionally confirmed so far. We identified the rice gene OsATG8b and characterized its role in N remobilization to affect grain quality by generating  transgenic plants with its over-expression and knockdown. Our study confirmed the autophagy activity of OsATG8b through the complementation of the yeast autophagy-defective mutant scatg8 and by observation of autophagosome formation in rice. The autophagy activity is higher in OsATG8b-OE lines and lower in OsATG8b-RNAi than that in wild type (ZH11). 15N pulse-chase analysis revealed that OsATG8b-OE plants conferred higher N recycling efficiency to grains, while OsATG8b-RNAi transgenic plants exhibited lower N recycling efficiency and poorer  grain quality. The autophagic role of OsATG8b was experimentally confirmed, and it was concluded that OsATG8b-mediated autophagy is involved in N recycling to grains and contributes to the grain quality, indicating that OsATG8b may be a potential gene for molecular breeding and cultivation of rice.
