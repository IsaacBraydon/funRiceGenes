OsATG8b	Overexpression of rice gene OsATG8b confers tolerance to nitrogen starvation and increases yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in Arabidopsis. |  Here, we identified a core autophagy gene in rice, OsATG8b, with increased expression levels under N starvation conditions |  The overexpression of OsATG8b significantly enhanced autophagic flux in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants |  Further examination revealed that overexpression of OsATG8b could effectively alleviate the growth inhibition of transgenic Arabidopsis under nitrogen (N) stress	Overexpression of rice gene OsATG8b confers tolerance to nitrogen starvation and increases yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in Arabidopsis. |  The overexpression of OsATG8b significantly enhanced autophagic flux in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants |  Further examination revealed that overexpression of OsATG8b could effectively alleviate the growth inhibition of transgenic Arabidopsis under nitrogen (N) stress
