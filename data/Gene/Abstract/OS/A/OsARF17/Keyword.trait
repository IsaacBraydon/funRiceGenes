OsARF17	leaf	SPOC domain-containing protein Leaf inclination3 interacts with LIP1 to regulate rice leaf inclination through auxin signaling.	 Being consistent, transgenic plants with OsIAA12 overexpression or deficiency of OsARF17 which interacts with OsIAA12 do present enlarged leaf inclination
OsARF17	auxin	Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor OsARF17 by different plant RNA viruses for infection.	Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor OsARF17 by different plant RNA viruses for infection.
OsARF17	auxin	Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor OsARF17 by different plant RNA viruses for infection.	 This suggests that OsARF17 plays a crucial role in plant defense against different types of plant viruses, and that these viruses use independently evolved viral proteins to target this key component of auxin signaling and facilitate infection
OsARF17	resistance	Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor OsARF17 by different plant RNA viruses for infection.	 OsARF17 also confers resistance to a cytorhabdovirus and was directly targeted by one of the viral proteins
OsARF17	defense	Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor OsARF17 by different plant RNA viruses for infection.	 This suggests that OsARF17 plays a crucial role in plant defense against different types of plant viruses, and that these viruses use independently evolved viral proteins to target this key component of auxin signaling and facilitate infection
OsARF17	auxin response	Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor OsARF17 by different plant RNA viruses for infection.	Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor OsARF17 by different plant RNA viruses for infection.
OsARF17	R protein	Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor OsARF17 by different plant RNA viruses for infection.	 We show here that two fijiviruses (double-stranded RNA viruses) utilize their proteins to disturb the dimerization of OsARF17 and repress its transcriptional activation ability, while a tenuivirus (negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus) directly interferes with the DNA binding activity of OsARF17

OsARF17	transcription factor	Transcriptome analysis of auxin transcription factor OsARF17-mediated rice stripe mosaic virus response in rice.	 RT-qPCR assays showed that the induction of plant defense-related genes, such as WRKY transcription factors, OsAHT2 and OsDR8, and JA-related genes, were significantly suppressed in OsARF17 mutants in response to RSMV
OsARF17	auxin	Transcriptome analysis of auxin transcription factor OsARF17-mediated rice stripe mosaic virus response in rice.	 Our previous studies have indicated that auxin response factor OsARF17 plays a crucial role in plant defense against diverse rice viruses
OsARF17	defense	Transcriptome analysis of auxin transcription factor OsARF17-mediated rice stripe mosaic virus response in rice.	 Our previous studies have indicated that auxin response factor OsARF17 plays a crucial role in plant defense against diverse rice viruses
OsARF17	defense	Transcriptome analysis of auxin transcription factor OsARF17-mediated rice stripe mosaic virus response in rice.	 METHODS: Utilizing a comparative transcriptome analysis of Rice stripe mosaic virus (RSMV)-inoculated OsARF17 mutant rice plants, to further elucidate the molecular mechanism of OsARF17 in antiviral defense pathway
OsARF17	auxin response	Transcriptome analysis of auxin transcription factor OsARF17-mediated rice stripe mosaic virus response in rice.	 Our previous studies have indicated that auxin response factor OsARF17 plays a crucial role in plant defense against diverse rice viruses
OsARF17	signal transduction	Transcriptome analysis of auxin transcription factor OsARF17-mediated rice stripe mosaic virus response in rice.	 RESULTS: KEGG enrichment analyses showed that the down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) belonged to plant-pathogen interaction and plant hormone signal transduction pathways were markedly enriched in OsARF17 mutants under RSMV inoculation
