OsARF17	OsmiR167a	OsmiR167a-targeted auxin response factors modulate tiller angle via fine-tuning auxin distribution in rice.	 In the overexpression of OsMIR167a plants, the expression of OsARF12, OsARF17 and OsARF25 were severely repressed, and displayed larger tiller angle as well as the osarf12/osarf17 and osarf12/ osarf25 plants
OsARF17	OsmiR167a	OsmiR167a-targeted auxin response factors modulate tiller angle via fine-tuning auxin distribution in rice.	 Our results reveal that OsmiR167a represses its targets, OsARF12, OsARF17 and OsARF25, to control rice tiller angle by fine-tuning auxin asymmetric distribution in shoots
D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1|HFR131	OsARF17	The identification and characterization of a plant height and grain length related gene hfr131 in rice.	 By combining yeast one-hybrid assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR and gene expression quantification, we demonstrated that OsARF17, an auxin response factor, could bind to the promoter region of HFR131 and positively regulated HFR131 expression, thereby regulating the plant height and grain length, and influencing brassinosteroid sensitivity
