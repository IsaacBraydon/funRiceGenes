OsAAI1	In this study, we investigated the function of OsAAI1 in yield and drought tolerance by constructing overexpression line OE-OsAAI1 and mutant line osaai1 |  The expression of OsAAI1 was significantly induced by ABA and drought stress |  OsAAI1 overexpression (OE19) significantly increased, and gene mutant (osaai1-1) repressed plant height, primary root length, lateral root number, grain size and yield in rice	In this study, we investigated the function of OsAAI1 in yield and drought tolerance by constructing overexpression line OE-OsAAI1 and mutant line osaai1 |  OsAAI1 overexpression (OE19) significantly increased, and gene mutant (osaai1-1) repressed plant height, primary root length, lateral root number, grain size and yield in rice
