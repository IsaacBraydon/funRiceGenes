OsAPx8	 ABA 	NaCl-induced expression of ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 8 in roots of rice (Oryza sativaL.) seedlings is not associated with osmotic component	Here we show that ABA level but not OsAPx8 expression was enhanced at a concentration of mannitol iso-osmotic with 150 mM NaCl suggests that NaCl-enhanced OsAPx8 expression is not associated with osmotic component
OsAPx8	root	Expression of ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 8 in roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings in response to NaCl	NaCl at 150 mM and 200 mM increased the expression of OsAPx8 and the activities of APx, but had no effect on the expression of OsAPx1, OsAPx2, OsAPx3, OsAPx4, OsAPx5, OsAPx6, and OsAPx7 in rice roots
OsAPx8	root	Expression of ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 8 in roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings in response to NaCl	Exogenously applied ABA also specifically enhanced the expression of OsAPx8 in rice roots
OsAPx8	root	Expression of ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 8 in roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings in response to NaCl	It appears that NaCl-enhanced expression of OsAPx8 in rice roots is mediated through an accumulation of ABA
OsAPx8	root	Expression of ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 8 in roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings in response to NaCl	Evidence is provided to show that Na(+) but not Cl(-) is required for enhancing OsAPx8 expression, APx activity, and ABA accumulation in rice roots treated with NaCl
OsAPx8	root	Expression of ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 8 in roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings in response to NaCl	Diphenylene iodonium treatment, which is known to inhibit NaCl-induced accumulation of H(2)O(2) in rice roots, did not suppress OsAPx8 induction and ABA accumulation by NaCl
OsAPx8	root	Expression of ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 8 in roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings in response to NaCl	It appears that H(2)O(2) is not involved in the regulation of NaCl-induced OsAPx8 expression in rice roots
OsAPx8	 ABA 	Expression of ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 8 in roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings in response to NaCl	Exogenously applied ABA also specifically enhanced the expression of OsAPx8 in rice roots
OsAPx8	 ABA 	Expression of ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 8 in roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings in response to NaCl	Evidence is provided to show that Na(+) but not Cl(-) is required for enhancing OsAPx8 expression, APx activity, and ABA accumulation in rice roots treated with NaCl
OsAPx8	 ABA 	Expression of ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 8 in roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings in response to NaCl	Diphenylene iodonium treatment, which is known to inhibit NaCl-induced accumulation of H(2)O(2) in rice roots, did not suppress OsAPx8 induction and ABA accumulation by NaCl
OsAPx8	chloroplast	Expression of ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 8 in roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings in response to NaCl	Applying semi-quantitative RT-PCR, the mRNA levels were quantified for two cytosolic (OsAPx1 and OsAPx2), two peroxisomal (OsAPx3 and OsAPx4), and four chloroplastic (OsAPx5, OsAPx6, OsAPx7, and OsAPx8) isoforms identified in the rice genome
OsAPx8	chloroplast	NaCl-induced expression of ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 8 in roots of rice (Oryza sativaL.) seedlings is not associated with osmotic component	Eight types of APx have been described for Oryza sativa: two cytosolic (OsAPx1 and OsAPx2), two putative peroxisomal (OsAPx3 and OsAPx4), and four chloroplastic isoforms (OsAPx5, OsAPx6, OsAPx7, and OsAPx8)
OsAPx8	root	NaCl-induced expression of ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 8 in roots of rice (Oryza sativaL.) seedlings is not associated with osmotic component	We have recently demonstrated that Na+ but not Cl- is required for the NaCl-induced expression of OsAPx8 in rice roots
OsAPx8	tolerance	The rice thylakoid membrane-bound ascorbate peroxidase OsAPX8 functions in tolerance to bacterial blight.	The rice thylakoid membrane-bound ascorbate peroxidase OsAPX8 functions in tolerance to bacterial blight.
OsAPx8	tolerance	The rice thylakoid membrane-bound ascorbate peroxidase OsAPX8 functions in tolerance to bacterial blight.	In addition, OsAPX8 interacted with the susceptibility protein Os8N3/Xa13, and their binding repressed the reaction of OsAPX8 in tolerance to bacterial blight
OsAPx8	blight	The rice thylakoid membrane-bound ascorbate peroxidase OsAPX8 functions in tolerance to bacterial blight.	In addition, OsAPX8 interacted with the susceptibility protein Os8N3/Xa13, and their binding repressed the reaction of OsAPX8 in tolerance to bacterial blight
OsAPx8	bacterial blight	The rice thylakoid membrane-bound ascorbate peroxidase OsAPX8 functions in tolerance to bacterial blight.	The rice thylakoid membrane-bound ascorbate peroxidase OsAPX8 functions in tolerance to bacterial blight.
