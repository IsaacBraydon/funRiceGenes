OsAPx8	 Further analysis of the H2O2 content in these transgenic plants indicated that the H2O2 accumulation of OsAPX8-overexpressing plants was considerably less than that of wild-type and RNAi plants upon challenge with bacterial pathogen
OsAPx8	 For this, OsApx8 RNAi-silenced rice (apx8) and non-transformed plants (NT) were exposed to mild water deficit
