NA	Two ATP Binding Cassette G (ABCG) Transporters, OsABCG26 and OsABCG15, Collaboratively Regulate Rice Male Reproduction.	2015	Plant Physiol	Shanghai Jiao Tong University CITY: Shanghai STATE: Shanghai China [CN].	Male reproduction in higher plants requires the support of various metabolites including lipid molecules produced in the innermost anther wall layer, the tapetum, but how the molecules are allocated among different anther tissues remains largely unknown. Previously rice OsABCG15 and its Arabidopsis ortholog were shown to be required for pollen exine formation. Here, we report the significant role of OsABCG26 in regulating the development of anther cuticle and pollen exine together with OsABCG15 in rice. Cytological and chemical analysis indicate that osabcg26 shows reduced transport of lipidic molecules from tapetal cells for anther cuticle development. Supportively, the localization of OsABCG26 is on the plasma membrane of the anther wall layers. By contrast, OsABCG15 is polarly localized in tapetal plasma membrane facing anther locules. osabcg26 osabcg15 double mutant displays an almost complete absence of anther cuticle and pollen exine, similar to that of osabcg15 single mutant. Taken together, we propose that OsABCG26 and OsABCG15 collaboratively regulate rice male reproduction: OsABCG26 is mainly responsible for the transport of lipidic molecules from tapetal cells to anther wall layers, while OsABCG15 mainly is responsible for the export of lipidic molecules from the tapetal cells to anther locules for pollen exine development.
NA	An ABC transporter, OsABCG26, is required for anther cuticle and pollen exine formation and pollen-pistil interactions in rice	2016	Plant Science	Shenzhen Institute of Molecular Crop Design, Shenzhen 518107, China	Wax, cutin and sporopollenin are essential components for the formation of the anther cuticle and the pollen exine, respectively. Their lipid precursors are synthesized by secretory tapetal cells and transported to the anther and microspore surface for deposition. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of the anther cuticle and pollen exine are poorly understood in rice. Here, we characterized a rice male sterile mutant osabcg26. Molecular cloning and sequence analysis revealed a point mutation in the gene encoding an ATP binding cassette transporter G26 (OsABCG26). OsABCG26 was specifically expressed in the anther and pistil. Cytological analysis revealed defects in tapetal cells, lipidic Ubisch bodies, pollen exine, and anther cuticle in the osabcg26 mutant. Expression of some key genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport, such as UDT1, WDA1, CYP704B2, OsABCG15, OsC4 and OsC6, was significantly altered in osabcg26 anther, possibly due to a disturbance in the homeostasis of anther lipid metabolism and transport. Additionally, wild-type pollen tubes showed a growth defect in osabcg26 pistils, leading to low seed setting in osabcg26 cross-pollinated with the wild-type pollen. These results indicated that OsABCG26 plays an important role in anther cuticle and pollen exine formation and pollen-pistil interactions in rice.
