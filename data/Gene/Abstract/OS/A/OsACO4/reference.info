In deepwater rice positive feedback regulation of ethylene on the biosynthetic genes 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (OsACS5), ACC oxidase (OsACO1 and OsACO3) and the Yang cycle OsARD1 gene likely contributes to maintain elevated rates of ethylene synthesis over prolonged periods of time. Ethylene modulates gibberellin and abscisic acid homeostasis thereby promoting internodal growth which keeps part of the foliage above flood waters. Ethylene further induces growth of adventitious roots and programmed cell death to form aerenchyma and to facilitate adventitious root emergence at stem nodes. The ethylene signaling components identified so far in rice include receptors, an EIN2 and an EIN3 ortholog, and CTR1, RTE1, EBF1/2 and EIN5 homologs that are conserved between the dicot Arabidopsis and the monocot rice. Based on the observation that ein2 and eil1 mutants of rice do not display a strong phenotype we conclude that ethylene signaling in rice may be more intricate than in Arabidopsis. In addition, ethylene may have specific signaling outputs in semiaquatic plants such as rice as was shown for Yang cycle regulation. Functional analysis of signaling pathways including the large ethylene response factor (ERF) family may help understand how ethylene co-ordinates adaptive responses to flooding stress in rice.
pp1421202.pdf	Contribution of ethylene biosynthesis for resistance to blast fungus infection in young rice plants	2006	Plant Physiol	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The role of ethylene (ET) in resistance to infection with blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) in rice (Oryza sativa) is poorly understood. To study it, we quantified ET levels after inoculation, using young rice plants at the four-leaf stage of rice cv Nipponbare (wild type) and its isogenic plant (IL7), which contains the Pi-i resistance gene to blast fungus race 003. Small necrotic lesions by hypersensitive reaction (HR) were formed at 42 to 72 h postinoculation (hpi) in resistant IL7 leaves, and whitish expanding lesions at 96 hpi in susceptible wild-type leaves. Notable was the enhanced ET emission at 48 hpi accompanied by increased 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) levels and highly elevated ACC oxidase (ACO) activity in IL7 leaves, whereas only an enhanced ACC increase at 96 hpi in wild-type leaves. Among six ACC synthase (ACS) and seven ACO genes found in the rice genome, OsACS2 was transiently expressed at 48 hpi in IL7 and at 96 hpi in wild type, and OsACO7 was expressed at 48 hpi in IL7. Treatment with an inhibitor for ACS, aminooxyacetic acid, suppressed enhanced ET emission at 48 hpi in IL7, resulting in expanding lesions instead of HR lesions. Exogenously supplied ACC compromised the aminooxyacetic acid-induced breakdown of resistance in IL7, and treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene and silver thiosulfate, inhibitors of ET action, did not suppress resistance. These findings suggest the importance of ET biosynthesis and, consequently, the coproduct, cyanide, for HR-accompanied resistance to blast fungus in young rice plants and the contribution of induced OsACS2 and OsACO7 gene expression to it.
