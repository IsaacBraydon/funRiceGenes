HDA710	OsARF18|RST1	OsHDA710-mediated Histone Deacetylation Regulates Callus Formation of Rice Mature Embryo	 Meanwhile, the transcriptional repressors OsARF18 and OsARF22 were upregulated in the callus of hda710
HDA710	OsARF18|RST1	OsHDA710-mediated Histone Deacetylation Regulates Callus Formation of Rice Mature Embryo	 The ChIP-qPCR analysis demonstrated that the callus of hda710 exhibited enhanced histone H3 acetylation levels at the chromatin regions of OsARF18 and OsARF22
OsARF18|RST1	OsARF22	OsHDA710-mediated Histone Deacetylation Regulates Callus Formation of Rice Mature Embryo.	 Meanwhile, the transcriptional repressors OsARF18 and OsARF22 were upregulated in the callus of hda710
OsARF18|RST1	OsARF22	OsHDA710-mediated Histone Deacetylation Regulates Callus Formation of Rice Mature Embryo.	 The ChIP-qPCR analysis demonstrated that the callus of hda710 exhibited enhanced histone H3 acetylation levels at the chromatin regions  of OsARF18 and OsARF22
OsARF18|RST1	OsARF22	OsHDA710-mediated Histone Deacetylation Regulates Callus Formation of Rice Mature Embryo.	 Furthermore, we found that OsARF18 and OsARF22 were regulated through the OsHDA710 recruitment to their target loci
OsARF18|RST1	OsASN1|OsAS1	Transcriptional repressor RST1 controls salt tolerance and grain yield in rice by regulating gene expression of asparagine synthetase.	 Molecular analyses showed that RST1 directly repressed the expression of the gene encoding asparagine synthetase 1 (OsAS1)
OsARF18|RST1	OsASN1|OsAS1	Transcriptional repressor RST1 controls salt tolerance and grain yield in rice by regulating gene expression of asparagine synthetase.	 Loss of RST1 function increased the expression of OsAS1 and improved nitrogen (N) utilization by promoting asparagine production and avoiding excess ammonium (NH(4)(+)) accumulation
