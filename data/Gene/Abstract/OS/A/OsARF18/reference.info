Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play important roles in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. The role of HDACs in specialized transcriptional regulation and biological processes is poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the global expression patterns of genes related to epigenetic modifications during callus initiation in rice. We found that the repression of HDAC activity by trichostatin A (TSA) or by OsHDA710 mutation (hda710) results in impaired callus formation of rice mature embryo and increased global histone H3 acetylation levels. The HDAC inhibition decreased auxin response and cell proliferation in callus formation. Meanwhile, the transcriptional repressors OsARF18 and OsARF22 were upregulated in the callus of hda710. The ChIP-qPCR analysis demonstrated that the callus of hda710 exhibited enhanced histone H3 acetylation levels at the chromatin regions of OsARF18 and OsARF22. Furthermore, we found that OsARF18 and OsARF22 were regulated through the OsHDA710 recruitment to their target loci. Additionally, overexpression of OsARF18 decreased the transcription of downstream genes PLT1 and PLT2, and inhibited callus formation of mature embryo. These results demonstrate that OsHDA710 regulates callus formation by suppressing repressive OsARFs via histone deacetylation during callus formation of rice mature embryo. This indicates that OsHDA710-mediated histone deacetylation is an epigenetic regulation pathway for maintaining auxin response during cell dedifferentiation. 
NA	Transcriptional repressor RST1 controls salt tolerance and grain yield in rice by regulating gene expression of asparagine synthetase.	2022	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	College of Life Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Salt stress impairs nutrient metabolism in plant cells, leading to growth and yield penalties. However, the mechanism by which plants alter their nutrient metabolism processes in response to salt stress remains elusive. In this study, we identified and characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) rice salt tolerant 1 (rst1) mutant, which displayed improved salt tolerance and grain yield. Map-based cloning revealed that the gene RST1 encoded an auxin response factor (OsARF18). Molecular analyses showed that RST1 directly repressed the expression of the gene encoding asparagine synthetase 1 (OsAS1). Loss of RST1 function increased the expression of OsAS1 and improved nitrogen (N) utilization by promoting asparagine production and avoiding excess ammonium (NH(4)(+)) accumulation. RST1 was undergoing directional selection during domestication. The superior haplotype RST1(Hap III) decreased its transcriptional repression activity and contributed to salt tolerance and grain weight. Together, our findings unravel a synergistic regulator of growth and salt tolerance associated with N metabolism and provide a new strategy for the development of tolerant cultivars.
