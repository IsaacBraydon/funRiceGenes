MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of conserved small RNA with a length of 21-24 nucleotides in eukaryotes, which are involved in development and defense responses against biotic and abiotic stresses. By RNA-seq, Osa-miR444b.2 was identified to be induced after Rhizoctonia solani (R. solani) infection. In order to clarify the function of Osa-miR444b.2 responding to R. solani infection in rice, transgenic lines over-expressing and knocking out Osa-miR444b.2 were generated in the background of susceptible cultivar Xu3 and resistant cultivar YSBR1, respectively. Over-expressing Osa-miR444b.2 resulted in compromised resistance to R. solani. In contrast, the knocking out Osa-miR444b.2 lines exhibited improved resistance to R. solani. Furthermore, knocking out Osa-miR444b.2 resulted in increased height, tillers, smaller panicle, and decreased 1000-grain weight and primary branches. However, the transgenic lines over-expressing Osa-miR444b.2 showed decreased primary branches and tillers, but increased panicle length. These results indicated that Osa-miR444b.2 was also involved in regulating the agronomic traits in rice. The RNA-seq assay revealed that Osa-miR444b.2 mainly regulated the resistance to rice sheath blight disease by affecting the expression of plant hormone signaling pathways-related genes such as ET and IAA, and transcription factors such as WRKYs and F-boxes. Together, our results suggest that Osa-miR444b.2 negatively mediated the resistance to R. solani in rice, which will contribute to the cultivation of sheath blight resistant varieties.
