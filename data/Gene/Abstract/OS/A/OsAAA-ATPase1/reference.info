NA	Rice OsAAA-ATPase1 is Induced during Blast Infection in a Salicylic Acid-Dependent Manner, and Promotes Blast Fungus Resistance.	2020	Int J Mol Sci	College of Life Science, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan 430074, China.	Fatty acids (FAs) have been implicated in signaling roles in plant defense responses. We previously reported that mutation or RNAi-knockdown (OsSSI2-kd) of the rice OsSSI2 gene, encoding a stearoyl acyl carrier protein FA desaturase (SACPD), remarkably enhanced resistance to blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and the leaf-blight bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Transcriptomic analysis identified six AAA-ATPase family genes (hereafter OsAAA-ATPase1-6) upregulated in the OsSSI2-kd plants, in addition to other well-known defense-related genes. Here, we report the functional analysis of OsAAA-ATPase1 in rice's defense response to M. oryzae. Recombinant OsAAA-ATPase1 synthesized in Escherichia coli showed ATPase activity. OsAAA-ATPase1 transcription was induced by exogenous treatment with a functional analogue of salicylic acid (SA), benzothiadiazole (BTH), but not by other plant hormones tested. The transcription of OsAAA-ATPase1 was also highly induced in response to M. oryzae infection in an SA-dependent manner, as gene induction was significantly attenuated in a transgenic rice line expressing a bacterial gene (nahG) encoding salicylate hydroxylase. Overexpression of OsAAA-ATPase1 significantly enhanced pathogenesis-related gene expression and the resistance to M. oryzae; conversely, RNAi-mediated suppression of this gene compromised this resistance. These results suggest that OsAAA-APTase1 plays an important role in SA-mediated defense responses against blast fungus M. oryzae.
