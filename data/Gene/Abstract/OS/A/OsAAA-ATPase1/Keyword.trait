OsAAA-ATPase1	resistance	Rice OsAAA-ATPase1 is Induced during Blast Infection in a Salicylic Acid-Dependent Manner, and Promotes Blast Fungus Resistance.	 Overexpression of OsAAA-ATPase1 significantly enhanced pathogenesis-related gene expression and the resistance to M
OsAAA-ATPase1	ATPase	Rice OsAAA-ATPase1 is Induced during Blast Infection in a Salicylic Acid-Dependent Manner, and Promotes Blast Fungus Resistance.	 Recombinant OsAAA-ATPase1 synthesized in Escherichia coli showed ATPase activity
OsAAA-ATPase1	defense	Rice OsAAA-ATPase1 is Induced during Blast Infection in a Salicylic Acid-Dependent Manner, and Promotes Blast Fungus Resistance.	 Here, we report the functional analysis of OsAAA-ATPase1 in rice's defense response to M
OsAAA-ATPase1	defense response	Rice OsAAA-ATPase1 is Induced during Blast Infection in a Salicylic Acid-Dependent Manner, and Promotes Blast Fungus Resistance.	 Here, we report the functional analysis of OsAAA-ATPase1 in rice's defense response to M
OsAAA-ATPase1	salicylic acid	Rice OsAAA-ATPase1 is Induced during Blast Infection in a Salicylic Acid-Dependent Manner, and Promotes Blast Fungus Resistance.	Rice OsAAA-ATPase1 is Induced during Blast Infection in a Salicylic Acid-Dependent Manner, and Promotes Blast Fungus Resistance.
OsAAA-ATPase1	salicylic acid	Rice OsAAA-ATPase1 is Induced during Blast Infection in a Salicylic Acid-Dependent Manner, and Promotes Blast Fungus Resistance.	 OsAAA-ATPase1 transcription was induced by exogenous treatment with a functional analogue of salicylic acid (SA), benzothiadiazole (BTH), but not by other plant hormones tested
OsAAA-ATPase1	blast	Rice OsAAA-ATPase1 is Induced during Blast Infection in a Salicylic Acid-Dependent Manner, and Promotes Blast Fungus Resistance.	Rice OsAAA-ATPase1 is Induced during Blast Infection in a Salicylic Acid-Dependent Manner, and Promotes Blast Fungus Resistance.
