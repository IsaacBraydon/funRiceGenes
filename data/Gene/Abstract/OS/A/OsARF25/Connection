OsARF25	OsCKX4	CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE4 Integrates Cytokinin and Auxin Signaling to Control Rice Crown Root Formation.	Furthermore, one-hybrid assays revealed that OsCKX4 is a direct binding target of both the auxin response factor OsARF25 and the cytokinin response regulators OsRR2 and OsRR3
OsARF25	OsmiR167a	OsmiR167a-targeted auxin response factors modulate tiller angle via fine-tuning auxin distribution in rice.	 In the overexpression of OsMIR167a plants, the expression of OsARF12, OsARF17 and OsARF25 were severely repressed, and displayed larger tiller angle as well as the osarf12/osarf17 and osarf12/ osarf25 plants
OsARF25	OsmiR167a	OsmiR167a-targeted auxin response factors modulate tiller angle via fine-tuning auxin distribution in rice.	 Our results reveal that OsmiR167a represses its targets, OsARF12, OsARF17 and OsARF25, to control rice tiller angle by fine-tuning auxin asymmetric distribution in shoots
