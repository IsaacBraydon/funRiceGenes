Programmed cell death (PCD) during tapetum degeneration in postmeiotic anthers is critical for the proper development of male gametophytes in flowering plants. Although several genes involved in this process have been identified recently, the molecular mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we show that knockout of rice (Oryza sativa) APOPTOSIS INHIBITOR5 (API5), which encodes a putative homolog of antiapoptosis protein Api5 in animals, results in delayed degeneration of the tapetum due to inhibition of the tapetal PCD process leading to defects in formation of male gametophytes. Os API5 is a nuclear protein that interacts with two DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicases, API5-INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (AIP1) and AIP2. AIP1 and AIP2 are homologs of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Suppressor of Bad Response to Refrigeration1 protein 2 (SUB2p) that have critical roles in transcription elongation and pre-mRNA splicing. Os AIP1 and AIP2 can form dimers and interact directly with the promoter region of CP1, a rice cysteine protease gene. Suppression of Os AIP1/2 leads to down-regulation of CP1, resulting in sterility, which is highly similar to the effects of suppressed expression of Os CP1. Our results uncover a previously unknown pathway for regulating PCD during tapetum degeneration in rice, one that may be conserved among eukaryotic organisms.
NA	Stress-induced Oryza sativa BAT1 dual helicase exhibits unique bipolar translocation.	2015	Protoplasma	International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, 110067, India, narendra@icgeb.res.in.	HLA-B associated transcript 1 (BAT1) protein, also named as spliceosome RNA helicase UAP56, is a member of the DExD/H-box family of helicases. However, regulation under stress, biochemical properties, and functions of plant homologue of BAT1 are poorly understood. Here, we report the purification and detailed biochemical characterization of the Oryza sativa homologue of BAT1 (OsBAT1/UAP56) protein (52 kDa) and regulation of its transcript under abiotic stress. OsBAT1 transcript levels are enhanced in rice seedlings in response to abiotic stress including salt stress and abscisic acid. Purified OsBAT1 protein exhibits the DNA- and RNA-dependent ATPase, RNA helicase, and DNA- and RNA-binding activities. Interestingly OsBAT1 also exhibits unique DNA helicase activity, which has not been reported so far in any BAT1 homologue. Moreover, OsBAT1 translocates in both the 3' to 5' and 5' to 3' directions, which is also a unique property. The K m value for OsBAT1 DNA helicase is 0.9753 nM and for RNA helicase is 1.7536 nM, respectively. This study demonstrates several unique characteristics of OsBAT1 especially its ability to unwind both DNA and RNA duplexes; bipolar translocation and its transcript upregulation under abiotic stresses indicate that it is a multifunctional protein. Overall, this study represents significant contribution in advancing our knowledge regarding functions of OsBAT1 in RNA and DNA metabolism and its putative role in abiotic stress signaling in plants.
