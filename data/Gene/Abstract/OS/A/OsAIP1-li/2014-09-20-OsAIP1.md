## Publication
1. [Rice APOPTOSIS INHIBITOR5 coupled with two DEAD-box adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent RNA helicases regulates tapetum degeneration](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice APOPTOSIS INHIBITOR5 coupled with two DEAD-box adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent RNA helicases regulates tapetum degeneration%5BTitle%5D)), 2011, Plant Cell.

## Key message

## Connection
1. __OsAIP1__, __OsAPI5__, [Rice APOPTOSIS INHIBITOR5 coupled with two DEAD-box adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent RNA helicases regulates tapetum degeneration](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice APOPTOSIS INHIBITOR5 coupled with two DEAD-box adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent RNA helicases regulates tapetum degeneration%5BTitle%5D)),  Os API5 is a nuclear protein that interacts with two DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicases, API5-INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (AIP1) and AIP2
2. __OsAIP1__, __OsCP1__, [Rice APOPTOSIS INHIBITOR5 coupled with two DEAD-box adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent RNA helicases regulates tapetum degeneration](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice APOPTOSIS INHIBITOR5 coupled with two DEAD-box adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent RNA helicases regulates tapetum degeneration%5BTitle%5D)),  Os AIP1 and AIP2 can form dimers and interact directly with the promoter region of CP1, a rice cysteine protease gene, Suppression of Os AIP1/2 leads to down-regulation of CP1, resulting in sterility, which is highly similar to the effects of suppressed expression of Os CP1
3. __OsAIP1__, __OsAIP2__, [Rice APOPTOSIS INHIBITOR5 coupled with two DEAD-box adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent RNA helicases regulates tapetum degeneration](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice APOPTOSIS INHIBITOR5 coupled with two DEAD-box adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent RNA helicases regulates tapetum degeneration%5BTitle%5D)),  Os API5 is a nuclear protein that interacts with two DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicases, API5-INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (AIP1) and AIP2, AIP1 and AIP2 are homologs of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Suppressor of Bad Response to Refrigeration1 protein 2 (SUB2p) that have critical roles in transcription elongation and pre-mRNA splicing, Os AIP1 and AIP2 can form dimers and interact directly with the promoter region of CP1, a rice cysteine protease gene
