OsAAP3	nitrogen	Blocking Amino acid transporter OsAAP3 improves grain yield by promoting outgrowth buds and increasing tiller number in rice.	 However, RNAi of OsAAP3 decreased significantly Arg, Lys, Asp, and Thr concentrations to a small extent, and thus promoted bud outgrowth, increased significantly tiller numbers and effective panicle numbers per plant, and further enhanced significantly grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE)
OsAAP3	tillering	Blocking Amino acid transporter OsAAP3 improves grain yield by promoting outgrowth buds and increasing tiller number in rice.	 Elevated expression of OsAAP3 in transgenic plants resulted in significantly higher amino acid concentrations of Lys, Arg, His, Asp, Ala, Gln, Gly, Thr and Tyr, and inhibited bud outgrowth and rice tillering
OsAAP3	panicle	Blocking Amino acid transporter OsAAP3 improves grain yield by promoting outgrowth buds and increasing tiller number in rice.	 However, RNAi of OsAAP3 decreased significantly Arg, Lys, Asp, and Thr concentrations to a small extent, and thus promoted bud outgrowth, increased significantly tiller numbers and effective panicle numbers per plant, and further enhanced significantly grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE)
