NA	Blocking Amino acid transporter OsAAP3 improves grain yield by promoting outgrowth buds and increasing tiller number in rice.	2018	Plant Biotechnol J	Center of Applied Biotechnology, Wuhan Institute of Bioengineering, Wuhan 430415, PR China.	Amino acid transporters (AATs) play indispensable roles in nutrient allocation during plant development. In this study, we demonstrated that inhibiting expression of the rice amino acid transporter OsAAP3 increased grain yield due to a formation of larger numbers of tillers as a result of increased bud outgrowth. Elevated expression of OsAAP3 in transgenic plants resulted in significantly higher amino acid concentrations of Lys, Arg, His, Asp, Ala, Gln, Gly, Thr and Tyr, and inhibited bud outgrowth and rice tillering. However, RNAi of OsAAP3 decreased significantly Arg, Lys, Asp, and Thr concentrations to a small extent, and thus promoted bud outgrowth, increased significantly tiller numbers and effective panicle numbers per plant, and further enhanced significantly grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). The promoter sequences of OsAAP3 showed some divergence between Japonica and Indica rice, and expression of the gene was higher in Japonica, which produced fewer tillers than Indica. We generated knockout-lines of OsAAP3 on Japonica ZH11 and KY131 using CRISPR technology and found that grain yield could be increased significantly. These results suggest that manipulation of OsAAP3 expression could be used to increase grain yield in rice. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
NA	The Amino Acid Transporter OsAAP4 Contributes to Rice Tillering and Grain Yield by Regulating Neutral Amino Acid Allocation through Two Splicing Variants	2021	Rice (N Y)	Key Laboratory of Plant Resource Conservation and Germplasm Innovation in Mountainous Region (Ministry of Education), College of Agricultural Sciences, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, China. zmfang@gzu.edu.cn.	Background: Amino acids, which are transported by amino acid transporters, are the major forms of organic nitrogen utilized by higher plants. Among the 19 Amino Acid Permease transporters (AAPs) in rice, only a small number of these genes have been reported to influence rice growth and development. However, whether other OsAAPs are responsible for rice growth and development is unclear.  Results: In this study, we demonstrate that OsAAP4 promoter sequences are divergent between Indica and Japonica, with higher expression in the former, which produces more tillers and higher grain yield than does Japonica. Overexpression of two different splicing variants of OsAAP4 in Japonica ZH11 significantly increased rice tillering and grain yield as result of enhancing the neutral amino acid concentrations of Val, Pro, Thr and Leu. OsAAP4 RNA interference (RNAi) and mutant lines displayed opposite trends compared with overexpresing (OE) lines. In addition, exogenous Val or Pro at 0.5 mM significantly promoted the bud outgrowth of lines overexpressing an OsAAP4a splicing variant compared with ZH11, and exogenous Val or Pro at 2.0 mM significantly enhanced the bud outgrowth of lines overexpressing splicing variant OsAAP4b compared with ZH11. Of note, the results of a protoplast amino acid-uptake assay showed that Val or Pro at different concentrations was specifically transported and accumulated in these overexpressing lines. Transcriptome analysis further demonstrated that OsAAP4 may affect nitrogen transport and metabolism, and auxin, cytokinin signaling in regulating rice tillering.  Conclusion: Our results suggested that OsAAP4 contributes to rice tiller and grain yield by regulating neutral amino acid allocation through two different splicing variants and that OsAAP4 might have potential applications in rice breeding.
NA	Altered Expression of OsAAP3 Influences Rice Lesion Mimic and Leaf Senescence by Regulating Arginine Transport and Nitric Oxide Pathway	2021	Int J Mol Sci	Key Laboratory of Plant Resource Conservation and Germplasm Innovation in Mountainous Region (Ministry of Education), College of Agricultural Sciences, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China.	Persistent lesion mimic can cause leaf senescence, affecting grain yield in crops. However, knowledge about the regulation of lesion mimic and leaf senescence in crop plants is still limited. Here, we report that the amino acid transporter OsAAP3, a negative regulator of tiller bud elongation and rice grain yield, is involved in lesion mimic and leaf senescence. Altered expression of OsAAP3 can initiate the nitric oxide signaling pathway through excessive accumulation of arginine in rice leaves, influencing ROS accumulation, antioxidant enzymes activities, proline concentration, and malondialdehyde concentration. This finally triggers cell death which ultimately leads to lesion mimic and leaf senescence by regulating the degradation of chloroplast and the expression abundance of components in the photosynthetic pathway. Overall, the results not only provide initial insights into the regulatory role of amino acid transport genes in rice growth and development, but also help to understand the factors regulating the leaf senescence.
