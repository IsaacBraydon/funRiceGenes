Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is considered a signal molecule inducing cellular stress. Both heat shock (HS) and Cd can increase H2O2 content. We investigated the involvement of H2O2 in HS- and Cd-mediated changes in the expression of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) in leaves of rice seedlings. HS treatment increased the content of H2O2 before it increased activities of APX and GR in rice leaves. Moreover, HS-induced H2O2 production and APX and GR activities could be counteracted by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors dipehenylene iodonium (DPI) and imidazole (IMD). HS-induced OsAPX2 gene expression was associated with HS-induced APX activity but was not regulated by H2O2. Cd-increased H2O2 content and APX and GR activities were lower with than without HS. Cd did not increase the expression of OsAPX and OsGR without HS treatment. Cd increased H2O2 content by Cd before it increased APX and GR activities without HS. Treatment with DPI and IMD effectively inhibited Cd-induced H2O2 production and APX and GR activities. Moreover, the effects of DPI and IMD could be rescued with H2O2 treatment. H2O2 may be involved in the regulation of HS- and Cd-increased APX and GR activities in leaves of rice seedlings.

journal.pone.0057472.pdf	Gene knockout study reveals that cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase 2(OsAPX2) plays a critical role in growth and reproduction in rice under drought, salt and cold stresses	2013	PLoS One	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences/National Key facility for Gene Resources And Genetic Improvement, Beijing, China.	Plant ascorbate peroxidases (APXs), enzymes catalyzing the dismutation of H2O2 into H2O and O2, play an important role in reactive oxygen species homeostasis in plants. The rice genome has eight OsAPXs, but their physiological functions remain to be determined. In this report, we studied the function of OsAPX2 gene using a T-DNA knockout mutant under the treatment of drought, salt and cold stresses. The Osapx2 knockout mutant was isolated by a genetic screening of a rice T-DNA insertion library under 20% PEG-2000 treatment. Loss of function in OsAPX2 affected the growth and development of rice seedlings, resulting in semi-dwarf seedlings, yellow-green leaves, leaf lesion mimic and seed sterility. OsAPX2 expression was developmental- and spatial-regulated, and was induced by drought, salt, and cold stresses. Osapx2 mutants had lower APX activity and were sensitive to abiotic stresses; overexpression of OsAPX2 increased APX activity and enhanced stress tolerance. H2O2 and MDA levels were high in Osapx2 mutants but low in OsAPX2-OX transgenic lines relative to wild-type plants after stress treatments. Taken together, the cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase OsAPX2 plays an important role in rice growth and development by protecting the seedlings from abiotic stresses through scavenging reactive oxygen species.
pone.0041233.pdf	Genetic transformation and analysis of rice OsAPx2 gene in Medicago sativa	2012	PLoS One	Key Laboratory of Saline-alkali Vegetation Ecology Restoration in Oil Field (SAVER), Ministry of Education, Alkali Soil Natural Environmental Science Center (ASNESC), Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China.	The OsAPx2 gene from rice was cloned to produce PBI121::OsAPx2 dual-expression plants, of which expression level would be increasing under stressful conditions. The enzyme ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in the leaves and roots of the plants increased with increasing exposure time to different sodium chloride (NaCl) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))concentrations, as indicated by protein gel blot analysis. The increased enzyme yield improved the ability of the plants to resist the stress treatments. The OsAPx2 gene was localized in the cytoplasm of epidermal onion cells as indicated by the instantaneous expression of green fluorescence. An 80% regeneration rate was observed in Medicago sativa L. plants transformed with the OsAPx2 gene using Agrobacterium tumefaciens, as indicated by specific primer PCR. The OsAPx2 gene was expressed at the mRNA level and the individual M. sativa (T#1,T#2,T#5) were obtained through assaying the generation of positive T2 using RNA gel blot analysis. When the seeds of the wild type (WT) and the T2 (T#1,T#5) were incubated in culture containing MS with NaCl for 7 days, the results as shown of following: the root length of transgenic plant was longer than WT plants, the H(2)O(2) content in roots of WT was more than of transgenic plants, the APX activity under stresses increased by 2.89 times compared with the WT, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content of the WT was higher than the transgenic plants, the leaves of the WT turned yellow, but those of the transgenic plants remained green and remained healthy. The chlorophyll content in the WT leaves was less than in the transgenic plants, after soaking in solutions of H(2)O(2), sodium sulfite (Na(2)SO(3)), and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)). Therefore, the OsAPx2 gene overexpression in transgenic M. sativa improves the removal of H(2)O(2) and the salt-resistance compared with WT plants. A novel strain of M. sativa carrying a salt-resistance gene was obtained.

China.	To clarify the diversity and function of isozymes of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in plants, a method of producing large quantities of these proteins is needed. Here, we describe an Escherichia coli expression system for the rapid and economic expression of two rice APX genes, APXa and APXb (GeneBank accession Nos. D45423 and AB053297, respectively). The two genes were cloned into the pGEX-6p-3 vector to allow expression of APX as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The GST-APXa and GST-APXb fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column, with final yields of 40 and 73 mg g(-1) dry cells, respectively. Specific activities were 15 and 20 mM ascorbate min(-1) mg(-1) protein, respectively. The K(m) values for ascorbate were 4 and 1 mM, respectively, and those for H(2)O(2) were 0.3 and 0.7 mM, respectively indicating that the two rice isoenzymes have different properties.
NA	Cytosolic APX2 is a pleiotropic protein involved in H2O2homeostasis, chloroplast protection, plant architecture and fertility maintenance.	2018	Plant Cell Rep	College of Life Sciences, Capital Normal University, Beijing, 100048, China.	Rice cytoplasmic APX2 is a pleiotropic protein, densely distributed around chloroplasts. It plays key roles in H2O2homeostasis and chloroplast protection, and is related to plant architecture and fertility regulation. Ascorbate peroxidases (APXs) catalyze the conversion of H2O2into H2O. In this report, we systematically investigated the function of cytosolic APX2 using a T-DNA knockout mutant. Loss of OsAPX2 altered rice architecture including shoot height and leaf inclination, resulting in shoot dwarfing, leaf dispersion and fertility decline. Sixty-five differentially expressed proteins were identified in flag leaves of the milk-ripe stage, mainly involved in photosynthesis, glycolysis and TCA cycle, redox homeostasis, and defense. The absence of APX2 severely impacted the stability of chloroplast proteins, and dramatically reduced their expression levels. Subcellular localization showed that APX2 was enriched around each chloroplast to form a high concentration sphere, highlighting chloroplasts as key targets protected by the protein. Accumulation of H2O2was suppressed in the KO-APX2 mutant, which may benefit from increased CAT activity and functional complementation of APX family members. Unexpectedly, the accumulation of soluble sugar, especially sucrose increased significantly, suggesting that APX2 was involved in regulation of sugar metabolism. Obviously, roles of the cytosolic APX2 are very profound and complex in rice. It can be concluded that the cytosolic APX2 is a pleiotropic protein and an important regulator in ROS homeostasis, chloroplast protection, carbohydrate metabolism as well as plant architecture and fertility maintenance.
