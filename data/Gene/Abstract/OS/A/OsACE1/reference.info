INTRODUCTION: The excessive dosage of pesticides required for agronomic reality results in growing contamination of pesticide residues in environment, thus bringing high risks to crop production and human health. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to unveil a novel mechanism for catabolism of two pesticides MTR and FSA facilitated by an uncharacterized Phase II reaction enzyme termed acetyltransferase-1 (ACE1) in rice and to make assessment of its potential for bioremediation to minimize the risks to crop production and food safety. METHODS: We developed genetically improved cultivars overexpressing OsACE1 (OE) and knockout mutant lines by CRISPR-Cas9 technology to identify the MTR and FSA detoxic and metabolic functions and characterized their metabolites and conjugates by HPLC-LTQ-MS/MS. RESULTS: OsACE1 overexpression conferred rice resistance to toxicity of MTR/FSA compared to wild-type, manifested by improved plant elongation and biomass, attenuated cellular injury, and increased chlorophyll accumulation. The OE plants accumulated significantly less parent MTR/FSA and more degradative metabolites, and removed MTR/FSA from their growth medium by 1.38 and 1.61 folds over the wild-type. In contrast, knocking out OsACE1 led to compromised growth fitness and intensified toxic symptoms under MTR/FSA stress and accumulation of more toxic MTR and FSA in rice. The reduced metabolites of MTR and FSA detected in the Cas9 plants suggest the impaired capability of OsACE1 function. CONCLUSIONS: These results signified that OsACE1 expression is required for detoxifying the two poisoning chemicals in rice and plays a critical role in accelerating breakdown of the pesticides mainly through Phase II reaction mechanism pathways.
