OsACE1	 RESULTS: OsACE1 overexpression conferred rice resistance to toxicity of MTR/FSA compared to wild-type, manifested by improved plant elongation and biomass, attenuated cellular injury, and increased chlorophyll accumulation |  CONCLUSIONS: These results signified that OsACE1 expression is required for detoxifying the two poisoning chemicals in rice and plays a critical role in accelerating breakdown of the pesticides mainly through Phase II reaction mechanism pathways	 RESULTS: OsACE1 overexpression conferred rice resistance to toxicity of MTR/FSA compared to wild-type, manifested by improved plant elongation and biomass, attenuated cellular injury, and increased chlorophyll accumulation
