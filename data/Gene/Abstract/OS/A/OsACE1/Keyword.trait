OsACE1	growth	Detoxification and catabolism of mesotrione and fomesafen facilitated by a Phase II reaction acetyltransferase in rice.	 In contrast, knocking out OsACE1 led to compromised growth fitness and intensified toxic symptoms under MTR/FSA stress and accumulation of more toxic MTR and FSA in rice
OsACE1	resistance	Detoxification and catabolism of mesotrione and fomesafen facilitated by a Phase II reaction acetyltransferase in rice.	 RESULTS: OsACE1 overexpression conferred rice resistance to toxicity of MTR/FSA compared to wild-type, manifested by improved plant elongation and biomass, attenuated cellular injury, and increased chlorophyll accumulation
