OsARF24	auxin	Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth	Moreover, RMD expression is directly regulated by heterodimerized O. sativa auxin response factor 23 (OsARF23) and OsARF24, providing evidence that auxin modulates the orientation of F-actin arrays through RMD.
