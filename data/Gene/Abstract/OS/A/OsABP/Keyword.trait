OsABP	abiotic stress	A new DEAD-box helicase ATP-binding protein (OsABP) from rice is responsive to abiotic stress	" In the present study, we report on the identification of a new DEAD-box helicase ATP-binding protein (OsABP) from rice which is upregulated in response e to multiple abiotic stress treatments including NaCl, dehydration, ABA, blue and red light
OsABP	abiotic stress	A new DEAD-box helicase ATP-binding protein (OsABP) from rice is responsive to abiotic stress	 These results imply that OsABP might perform important functions in the cellular response to specific abiotic stress
