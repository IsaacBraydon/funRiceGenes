OsAP2-39	OsDERF1	Transcriptional activation of OsDERF1 in OsERF3 and OsAP2-39 negatively modulates ethylene synthesis and drought tolerance in rice	Biochemical and molecular approaches showed that OsDERF1 at least directly interacted with the GCC box in the promoters of ERF repressors OsERF3 and OsAP2-39
OsAP2-39	OsDERF1	Transcriptional activation of OsDERF1 in OsERF3 and OsAP2-39 negatively modulates ethylene synthesis and drought tolerance in rice	Transcriptional activation of OsDERF1 in OsERF3 and OsAP2-39 negatively modulates ethylene synthesis and drought tolerance in rice
AP37|OsERF3	OsAP2-39	Transcriptional activation of OsDERF1 in OsERF3 and OsAP2-39 negatively modulates ethylene synthesis and drought tolerance in rice	Biochemical and molecular approaches showed that OsDERF1 at least directly interacted with the GCC box in the promoters of ERF repressors OsERF3 and OsAP2-39
AP37|OsERF3	OsAP2-39	Transcriptional activation of OsDERF1 in OsERF3 and OsAP2-39 negatively modulates ethylene synthesis and drought tolerance in rice	Moreover, overexpression of OsERF3/OsAP2-39 suppressed ethylene synthesis
AP37|OsERF3	OsAP2-39	Transcriptional activation of OsDERF1 in OsERF3 and OsAP2-39 negatively modulates ethylene synthesis and drought tolerance in rice	Transcriptional activation of OsDERF1 in OsERF3 and OsAP2-39 negatively modulates ethylene synthesis and drought tolerance in rice
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	OsAP2-39	Multiple areas investigation reveals the genes related to vascular bundles in rice.	 The double mutant for the DEP1 and AP2-like genes (OsAP2-39) showed decreased endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) level and insensitivity to exogenous ABA treatment, confirming that both DEP1 and OsAP2-39 are involved in the ABA response mechanism
OsAP2-39	OsWRKY55|WRKY55a|WRKY55b	Rice Transcription Factor OsWRKY55 Is Involved in the Drought Response and Regulation of Plant Growth 	 In addition, based on a dual luciferase reporter assay, OsWRKY55 was shown to bind to the promoter of OsAP2-39 through a yeast one-hybrid assay and positively regulate OsAP2-39 expression
