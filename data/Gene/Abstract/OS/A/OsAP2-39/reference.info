The phytohormone ethylene is a key signaling molecule that regulates a variety of developmental processes and stress responses in plants. Transcriptional modulation is a pivotal process controlling ethylene synthesis, which further triggers the expression of stress-related genes and plant adaptation to stresses; however, it is unclear how this process is transcriptionally modulated in rice. In the present research, we report the transcriptional regulation of a novel rice ethylene response factor (ERF) in ethylene synthesis and drought tolerance. Through analysis of transcriptional data, one of the drought-responsive ERF genes, OsDERF1, was identified for its activation in response to drought, ethylene and abscisic acid. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsDERF1 (OE) led to reduced tolerance to drought stress in rice at seedling stage, while knockdown of OsDERF1 (RI) expression conferred enhanced tolerance at seedling and tillering stages. This regulation was supported by negative modulation in osmotic adjustment response. To elucidate the molecular basis of drought tolerance, we identified the target genes of OsDERF1 using the Affymetrix GeneChip, including the activation of cluster stress-related negative regulators such as ERF repressors. Biochemical and molecular approaches showed that OsDERF1 at least directly interacted with the GCC box in the promoters of ERF repressors OsERF3 and OsAP2-39. Further investigations showed that OE seedlings had reduced expression (while RI lines showed enhanced expression) of ethylene synthesis genes, thereby resulting in changes in ethylene production. Moreover, overexpression of OsERF3/OsAP2-39 suppressed ethylene synthesis. In addition, application of ACC recovered the drought-sensitive phenotype in the lines overexpressing OsERF3, showing that ethylene production contributed to drought response in rice. Thus our data reveal that a novel ERF transcriptional cascade modulates drought response through controlling the ethylene synthesis, deepening our understanding of the regulation of ERF proteins in ethylene related drought response.
pgen.1001098.pdf	The APETALA-2-Like Transcription Factor OsAP2-39 Controls Key Interactions between Abscisic Acid and Gibberellin in Rice	2010	PLoS Genet	Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada	The interaction between phytohormones is an important mechanism which controls growth and developmental processes in plants. Deciphering these interactions is a crucial step in helping to develop crops with enhanced yield and resistance to environmental stresses. Controlling the expression level of OsAP2-39 which includes an APETALA 2 (AP2) domain leads to phenotypic changes in rice. Overexpression of OsAP2-39 leads to a reduction in yield by decreasing the biomass and the number of seeds in the transgenic rice lines. Global transcriptome analysis of the OsAP2-39 overexpression transgenic rice revealed the upregulation of a key Abscisic Acid (ABA) biosynthetic gene OsNCED-I which codes for 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase and leads to an increase in the endogenous ABA level. In addition to OsNCED-1, the gene expression analysis revealed the upregulation of a gene that codes for the Elongation of Upper most Internode (EUI) protein, an enzyme that catalyzes 16a, 17-epoxidation of non-13-hydroxylated GAs, which has been shown to deactivate gibberellins (GAs) in rice. The exogenous application of GA restores the wild-type phenotype in the transgenic line and ABA application induces the expression of EUI and suppresses the expression of OsAP2-39 in the wild-type line. These observations clarify the antagonistic relationship between ABA and GA and illustrate a mechanism that leads to homeostasis of these hormones. In vivo and in vitro analysis showed that the expression of both OsNCED-1 and EUI are directly controlled by OsAP2-39. Together, these results reveal a novel mechanism for the control of the ABA/GA balance in rice which is regulated by OsAP2-39 that in turn regulates plant growth and seed production.
NA	APETALA 2-domain-containing transcription factors: focusing on abscisic acid and gibberellins antagonism.	2017	New Phytol	Department of Plant Physiology and Biotechnology, Institute of Ecological Agriculture, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, 611130, China.	The phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) antagonistically mediate diverse plant developmental processes including seed dormancy and germination, root development, and flowering time control, and thus the optimal balance between ABA and GA is essential for plant growth and development. Although more than a half and one century have passed since the initial discoveries of ABA and GA, respectively, the precise mechanisms underlying ABA-GA antagonism still need further investigation. Emerging evidence indicates that two APETALA 2 (AP2)-domain-containing transcription factors (ATFs), ABI4 in Arabidopsis and OsAP2-39 in rice, play key roles in ABA and GA antagonism. These two transcription factors precisely regulate the transcription pattern of ABA and GA biosynthesis or inactivation genes, mediating ABA and GA levels. In this Viewpoint article, we try to shed light on the effects of ATFs on ABA-GA antagonism, and summarize the overlapping but distinct biological functions of these ATFs in the antagonism between ABA and GA. Finally, we strongly propose that further research is needed into the detailed roles of additional numerous ATFs in ABA and GA crosstalk, which will improve our understanding of the antagonism between these two phytohormones.
NA	Multiple areas investigation reveals the genes related to vascular bundles in rice.	2019	Rice (N Y)	Rice Research Institute of Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, 110866, China.	The vascular bundle in the panicle neck is a crucial trait in rice (Oryza sativa) production that differs between the indica and japonica subspecies. However, the effect of indica/japonica genetic background on the vascular bundles remains unknown.A series of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between japonica and indica were planted in three areas. High-throughput sequencing was conducted to determine the indica pedigree percentage and for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. The indica pedigree affected the number of large vascular bundles (LVBs), but not the number of small vascular bundles (SVBs). QTL analysis identified a locus (qLVB9) that was pleiotropic for both LVBs and SVBs in all three areas, and qLVB9 appeared synonymous with DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 1 (DEP1). Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and gene overexpression technology, we confirmed that the truncated dep1 allele increased the number of LVBs, and resulted in LVBs more closely associated to the indica pedigree. RNA sequencing showed that the truncated dep1 allele downregulated the AP2-like gene family. The double mutant for the DEP1 and AP2-like genes (OsAP2-39) showed decreased endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) level and insensitivity to exogenous ABA treatment, confirming that both DEP1 and OsAP2-39 are involved in the ABA response mechanism.The present study showed the qLVB9/DEP1 affects LVBs, and involved in ABA signaling via regulating the AP2-like gene family. These results offer new insights into the function of qLVB9/DEP1 in rice.
NA	OsDREB2B, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, negatively regulates plant height by conferring GA metabolism in rice.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Jilin Provincial Engineering Laboratory of Plant Genetic Improvement, College of Plant Science, Jilin University, Changchun, China.	The AP2/ERF family is a large group of plant-specific transcription factors that play an important role in many biological processes, such as growth, development, and abiotic stress responses. OsDREB2B, a dehydration responsive factor (DRE/CRT) in the DREB subgroup of the AP2/ERF family, is associated with abiotic stress responses, such as cold, drought, salt, and heat stress, in Arabidopsis or rice. However, its role in regulating plant growth and development in rice is unclear. In this study, we reported a new function of OsDREB2B, which negatively regulates plant height in rice. Compared with wild type (WT), OsDREB2B-overexpressing (OE) rice exhibited dwarf phenotypes, such as reduction in plant height, internode length, and seed length, as well as grain yield, while the knockout mutants developed by CRISPR/Cas9 technology exhibited similar phenotypes. Spatial expression analysis revealed that OsDREB2B was highly expressed in the leaf sheaths. Under exogenous GA(3) application, OsDREB2B expression was induced, and the length of the second leaf sheath of the OsDREB2B-OE lines recovered to that of the WT. OsDREB2B localized to the nucleus of the rice protoplast acted as a transcription activator and upregulated OsAP2-39 by directly binding to its promoter. OsDREB2B-OE lines reduced endogenous bioactive GA levels by downregulating seven GA biosynthesis genes and upregulating eight GA deactivation genes but not GA signaling genes. The yeast two-hybrid assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay showed that OsDREB2B interacted with OsWRKY21. In summary, our study suggests that OsDREB2B plays a negative role in rice growth and development by regulating GA metabolic gene expression, which is mediated by OsAP2-39 and OsWRKY21, thereby reducing GA content and rice plant height.
