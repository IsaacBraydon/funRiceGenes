OsABA2	OsbHLH035|OsbHLH35	The transcription factor OsbHLH035 mediates seed germination and enables seedling recovery from salt stress through ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways, respectively.	 In parallel, abscisic acid (ABA) contents are over-accumulated, and the expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes OsABA2 and OsAAO3 is upregulated; furthermore, compared with that in wild-type (WT) seedlings, the salt-induced expression of OsABA8ox1, an ABA catabolic gene, in germinating Osbhlh035 mutant seeds is downregulated
OsABA2	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	Phosphorylation of OsABA2 at Ser197 by OsMPK1 regulates abscisic acid biosynthesis in rice.	Phosphorylation of OsABA2 at Ser197 by OsMPK1 regulates abscisic acid biosynthesis in rice.
OsABA2	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	Phosphorylation of OsABA2 at Ser197 by OsMPK1 regulates abscisic acid biosynthesis in rice.	 Here, by using yeast two-hybrid assay and firefly luciferase complementary imaging assay, we show that OsMPK1 physically interact with a short-chain dehydrogenase protein OsABA2
OsABA2	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	Phosphorylation of OsABA2 at Ser197 by OsMPK1 regulates abscisic acid biosynthesis in rice.	 However, OsMPK5, a homolog of OsMPK1, does not interact with OsABA2
OsABA2	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	Phosphorylation of OsABA2 at Ser197 by OsMPK1 regulates abscisic acid biosynthesis in rice.	 We also found that OsABA2 has feedback regulation on OsMPK1 kinase activity
OsABA2	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	Phosphorylation of OsABA2 at Ser197 by OsMPK1 regulates abscisic acid biosynthesis in rice.	 Further research reveals that OsMPK1 and OsABA2 coordinately regulate the biosynthesis of ABA, and phosphorylation of OsABA2 at Ser197 by OsMPK1 plays a crucial role in regulating the biosynthesis of ABA
OsABA2	OsMSRMK2|OsMAP1|OsMPK5|OsMAPK2|OsMAPK5|OsBIMK1|OsMPK3	Phosphorylation of OsABA2 at Ser197 by OsMPK1 regulates abscisic acid biosynthesis in rice.	 However, OsMPK5, a homolog of OsMPK1, does not interact with OsABA2
