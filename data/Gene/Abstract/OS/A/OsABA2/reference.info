NA	Functional characterization of xanthoxin dehydrogenase in rice.	2014	J Plant Physiol	Crop Breeding Research Division, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Hokkaido Agricultural Research Center, 1 Hitsujigaoka, Toyohira-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 062-8555, Japan.	Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone that plays a key role in biotic and abiotic stress responses. ABA metabolic genes are promising targets for molecular breeding work to improve stress tolerance in crops. The accumulation of ABA does not always improve stress tolerance since stress-induced accumulation of ABA in pollen inhibits the normal course of gametogenesis, affecting grain yields in cereals. This effect highlights the importance of manipulating the ABA levels according to the type of tissues. The aim of this study was to assign an ABA biosynthetic enzyme, xanthoxin dehydrogenase (XanDH), as a functional marker to modulate ABA levels in rice. XanDH is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family that catalyzes the conversion of xanthoxin to abscisyl aldehyde (ABAld). Previously, this enzyme had only been identified in Arabidopsis, as AtABA2. In this study, a XanDH named OsABA2 was identified in rice. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that a single gene encodes for OsABA2 in the rice genome. Its amino acid sequence contains two motifs that are essential for cofactor binding and catalytic activity. Expression analysis of OsABA2 mRNA showed that the transcript level did not change in response to treatment with ABA or dehydration. Recombinant OsABA2 protein expressed in Escherichia coli converted xanthoxin to ABAld in an NAD-dependent manner. Moreover, expression of OsABA2 in an Arabidopsis aba2 mutant rescued the aba2 mutant phenotypes, characterized by reduced growth, increased water loss, and germination in the presence of paclobutrazol, a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor or high concentration of glucose. These results indicate that OsABA2 is a rice XanDH that functions in ABA biosynthesis.
NA	Mutation in Rice Abscisic Acid2 Results in Cell Death, Enhanced Disease-Resistance, Altered Seed Dormancy and Development.	2018	Front Plant Sci	Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, China.	Lesion mimic mutants display spontaneous cell death, and thus are valuable for understanding the molecular mechanism of cell death and disease resistance. Although a lot of such mutants have been characterized in rice, the relationship between lesion formation and abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis pathway is not reported. In the present study, we identified a rice mutant, lesion mimic mutant 9150 (lmm9150), exhibiting spontaneous cell death, pre-harvest sprouting, enhanced growth, and resistance to rice bacterial and blast diseases. Cell death in the mutant was accompanied with excessive accumulation of H2O2. Enhanced disease resistance was associated with cell death and upregulation of defense-related genes. Map-based cloning identified a G-to-A point mutation resulting in a D-to-N substitution at the amino acid position 110 of OsABA2 (LOC_Os03g59610) in lmm9150. Knock-out of OsABA2 through CRISPR/Cas9 led to phenotypes similar to those of lmm9150. Consistent with the function of OsABA2 in ABA biosynthesis, ABA level in the lmm9150 mutant was significantly reduced. Moreover, exogenous application of ABA could rescue all the mutant phenotypes of lmm9150. Taken together, our data linked ABA deficiency to cell death and provided insight into the role of ABA in rice disease resistance.
NA	Phosphorylation of OsABA2 at Ser197 by OsMPK1 regulates abscisic acid biosynthesis in rice.	2021	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210095, China.	The mitogen-activated protein kinase OsMPK1 is involved in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of OsMPK1 in regulating ABA biosynthesis are poorly understood. Here, by using yeast two-hybrid assay and firefly luciferase complementary imaging assay, we show that OsMPK1 physically interact with a short-chain dehydrogenase protein OsABA2. However, OsMPK5, a homolog of OsMPK1, does not interact with OsABA2. Further, OsMPK1 can phosphorylate OsABA2(S197) inÂ vitro. Phosphorylation at the position of OsABA2(S197) does not affect its subcellular localization, but enhances the stability of OsABA2 protein. We also found that OsABA2 has feedback regulation on OsMPK1 kinase activity. Further research reveals that OsMPK1 and OsABA2 coordinately regulate the biosynthesis of ABA, and phosphorylation of OsABA2 at Ser197 by OsMPK1 plays a crucial role in regulating the biosynthesis of ABA. Finally, genetic analysis showed that OsABA2 can enhance the sensitivity of rice to ABA and the tolerance of rice to drought and salt stress.
