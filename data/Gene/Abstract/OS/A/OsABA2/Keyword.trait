OsABA2	gibberellin	Functional characterization of xanthoxin dehydrogenase in rice.	Moreover, expression of OsABA2 in an Arabidopsis aba2 mutant rescued the aba2 mutant phenotypes, characterized by reduced growth, increased water loss, and germination in the presence of paclobutrazol, a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor or high concentration of glucose
OsABA2	 ABA 	Functional characterization of xanthoxin dehydrogenase in rice.	Expression analysis of OsABA2 mRNA showed that the transcript level did not change in response to treatment with ABA or dehydration
OsABA2	 ABA 	Functional characterization of xanthoxin dehydrogenase in rice.	These results indicate that OsABA2 is a rice XanDH that functions in ABA biosynthesis

OsABA2	map-based cloning	Mutation in Rice Abscisic Acid2 Results in Cell Death, Enhanced Disease-Resistance, Altered Seed Dormancy and Development.	 Map-based cloning identified a G-to-A point mutation resulting in a D-to-N substitution at the amino acid position 110 of OsABA2 (LOC_Os03g59610) in lmm9150
OsABA2	 ABA 	Mutation in Rice Abscisic Acid2 Results in Cell Death, Enhanced Disease-Resistance, Altered Seed Dormancy and Development.	 Consistent with the function of OsABA2 in ABA biosynthesis, ABA level in the lmm9150 mutant was significantly reduced
OsABA2	ABA	Mutation in Rice Abscisic Acid2 Results in Cell Death, Enhanced Disease-Resistance, Altered Seed Dormancy and Development.	 Consistent with the function of OsABA2 in ABA biosynthesis, ABA level in the lmm9150 mutant was significantly reduced
