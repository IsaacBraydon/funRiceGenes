OsABA2	gibberellin	Functional characterization of xanthoxin dehydrogenase in rice.	Moreover, expression of OsABA2 in an Arabidopsis aba2 mutant rescued the aba2 mutant phenotypes, characterized by reduced growth, increased water loss, and germination in the presence of paclobutrazol, a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor or high concentration of glucose
OsABA2	 ABA 	Functional characterization of xanthoxin dehydrogenase in rice.	Expression analysis of OsABA2 mRNA showed that the transcript level did not change in response to treatment with ABA or dehydration
OsABA2	 ABA 	Functional characterization of xanthoxin dehydrogenase in rice.	These results indicate that OsABA2 is a rice XanDH that functions in ABA biosynthesis
