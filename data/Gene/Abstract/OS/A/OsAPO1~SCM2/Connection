APO1|OsAPO1|SCM2	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2/RFL, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis LEAFY, suppresses the transition from inflorescence meristem to floral meristem through interaction with APO1	Further analysis indicated that APO2/RFL and APO1, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS, act cooperatively to control inflorescence and flower development
APO1|OsAPO1|SCM2	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2/RFL, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis LEAFY, suppresses the transition from inflorescence meristem to floral meristem through interaction with APO1	ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2/RFL, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis LEAFY, suppresses the transition from inflorescence meristem to floral meristem through interaction with APO1
APO1|OsAPO1|SCM2	LARGE2|OsUPL2	The LARGE2-APO1/APO2 regulatory module controls panicle size and grain number in rice	 Biochemical analyses show that LARGE2 physically associates with ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (APO1) and APO2, two positive regulators of panicle size and grain number, and modulates their stabilities
APO1|OsAPO1|SCM2	LARGE2|OsUPL2	The LARGE2-APO1/APO2 regulatory module controls panicle size and grain number in rice	 Genetic analyses support that LARGE2 functions with APO1 and APO2 in a common pathway to regulate panicle size and grain number

APO1|OsAPO1|SCM2	LAX1|BOS1	BOS1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor involved in regulating panicle development in rice.	 The expression of panicle development-related genes, such as OsPIN2, OsPIN3, APO1, and FZP, was changed by bos1-1 mutation, suggesting that the genes may be the direct or indirect targets of BOS1 to regulate panicle development
