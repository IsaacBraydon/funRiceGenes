NA	Subcellular localization of rice acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) indicates that OsACBP6::GFP is targeted to the peroxisomes.	2014	New Phytol	School of Biological Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China; College of Life Science, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China.	Acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) show conservation at the acyl-CoA-binding (ACB) domain which facilitates binding to acyl-CoA esters. In Arabidopsis thaliana, six ACBPs participate in development and stress responses. Rice (Oryza sativa) also contains six genes encoding ACBPs. We investigated differences in subcellular localization between monocot rice and eudicot A. thaliana ACBPs. The subcellular localization of the six OsACBPs was achieved via transient expression of green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusions in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) epidermal cells, and stable transformation of A. thaliana. As plant ACBPs had not been reported in the peroxisomes, OsACBP6::GFP localization was confirmed by transient expression in rice sheath cells. The function of OsACBP6 was investigated by overexpressing 35S::OsACBP6 in the peroxisomal abc transporter1 (pxa1) mutant defective in peroxisomal fatty acid Î²-oxidation. As predicted, OsACBP1::GFP and OsACBP2::GFP were localized to the cytosol, and OsACBP4::GFP and OsACBP5::GFP to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, OsACBP3::GFP displayed subcellular multi-localization while OsACBP6::GFP was localized to the peroxisomes. 35S::OsACBP6-OE/pxa1 lines showed recovery in indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) peroxisomal Î²-oxidation, wound-induced VEGETATIVE STORAGE PROTEIN1 (VSP1) expression and jasmonic acid (JA) accumulation. These findings indicate a role for OsACBP6 in peroxisomal Î²-oxidation, and suggest that rice ACBPs are involved in lipid degradation in addition to lipid biosynthesis.
NA	Rice acyl-CoA-binding proteins OsACBP4 and OsACBP5 are differentially localized in the endoplasmic reticulum of transgenic Arabidopsis.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	a School of Biological Sciences; The University of Hong Kong; Pokfulam, Hong Kong, PR China.	Acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) are known to bind and transport acyl-CoA esters and phospholipids intracellularly. In our recent paper in the New Phytologist, we reported that the six acyl-CoA-binding proteins (OsACBPs) in rice (Oryza sativa) are distributed across various subcellular compartments in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) such as the cytosol (OsACBP1, OsACBP2 and OsACBP3), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) including the tubules (OsACBP4 and OsACBP5) and the cisternae (OsACBP4), and the peroxisomes (OsACBP6). Localization of OsACBP4::GFP to the peripheral ER cisternae and the central cisternal ER-like structures in transgenic Arabidopsis distinguished it from OsACBP5::GFP. We further report that besides the ER, OsACBP4::GFP and OsACBP5::GFP were also targeted to the membrane of ER bodies and ER-derived spherical structures, respectively, in transgenic Arabidopsis. These findings support our previous conclusion that OsACBP4 and OsACBP5 are not redundant proteins in the ER.
NA	RICE ACYL-COA-BINDING PROTEIN6 Affects Acyl-CoA Homeostasis and Growth in Rice	2020	Rice	Key Laboratory of Saline-alkali Vegetation Ecology Restoration (Northeast Forestry University), Ministry of Education, Harbin, 150040, China.	Backgrounds: Acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) esters are important intermediates in lipid metabolism with regulatory properties. Acyl-CoA-binding proteins bind and transport acyl-CoAs to fulfill these functions. RICE ACYL-COA-BINDING PROTEIN6 (OsACBP6) is currently the only one peroxisome-localized plant ACBP that has been proposed to be involved in ¦Â-oxidation in transgenic Arabidopsis. The role of the peroxisomal ACBP (OsACBP6) in rice (Oryza sativa) was investigated.  Results: Here, we report on the function of OsACBP6 in rice. The osacbp6 mutant showed diminished growth with reduction in root meristem activity and leaf growth. Acyl-CoA profiling and lipidomic analysis revealed an increase in acyl-CoA content and a slight triacylglycerol accumulation caused by the loss of OsACBP6. Comparative transcriptomic analysis discerned the biological processes arising from the loss of OsACBP6. Reduced response to oxidative stress was represented by a decline in gene expression of a group of peroxidases and peroxidase activities. An elevation in hydrogen peroxide was observed in both roots and shoots/leaves of osacbp6. Taken together, loss of OsACBP6 not only resulted in a disruption of the acyl-CoA homeostasis but also peroxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. In contrast, osacbp6-complemented transgenic rice displayed similar phenotype to the wild type rice, supporting a role for OsACBP6 in the maintenance of the acyl-CoA pool and ROS homeostasis. Furthermore, quantification of plant hormones supported the findings observed in the transcriptome and an increase in jasmonic acid level occurred in osacbp6.  Conclusions: In summary, OsACBP6 appears to be required for the efficient utilization of acyl-CoAs. Disruption of OsACBP6 compromises growth and led to provoked defense response, suggesting a correlation of enhanced acyl-CoAs content with defense responses.
