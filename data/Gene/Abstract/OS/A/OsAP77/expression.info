OsAP77	 We previously reported that the expression of a rice AP gene (OsAP77, Os10g0537800) was induced by probenazole (PBZ), a chemical inducer of disease resistance | To elucidate the spatial and temporal expression of OsAP77, the chimeric gene was constructed carrying the structural gene encoding Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by the OsAP77 promoter | These results suggest that the expression of OsAP77 is induced by pathogen infection and defense related signaling molecules in a vascular tissue specific manner and that this gene has a positive role of defense response against fungal, bacterial and viral infections
