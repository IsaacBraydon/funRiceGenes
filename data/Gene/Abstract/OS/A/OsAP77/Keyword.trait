OsAP77	defense	Response of an aspartic protease gene OsAP77 to fungal, bacterial and viral infections in rice.	These results suggest that the expression of OsAP77 is induced by pathogen infection and defense related signaling molecules in a vascular tissue specific manner and that this gene has a positive role of defense response against fungal, bacterial and viral infections

OsAP77	ABA	Response of an aspartic protease gene OsAP77 to fungal, bacterial and viral infections in rice.	 RT-PCR analysis showed that OsAP77 was induced not only by infection with these pathogens, but also after treatment with SA, INA, H2O2 or ABA
