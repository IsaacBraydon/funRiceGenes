NA	Response of an aspartic protease gene OsAP77 to fungal, bacterial and viral infections in rice.	2014	Rice (N Y)	Faculty of Agriculture, Ehime University, 790-8566, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan, mahfuz6@yahoo.com.	Aspartic protease (APs) plays important roles in plant growth, development and biotic and abiotic stresses. We previously reported that the expression of a rice AP gene (OsAP77, Os10g0537800) was induced by probenazole (PBZ), a chemical inducer of disease resistance. In this study we examined some characteristics of this gene in response to fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens.To elucidate the spatial and temporal expression of OsAP77, the chimeric gene was constructed carrying the structural gene encoding Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by the OsAP77 promoter. This construct was introduced into rice and the transgenic lines were tested to analyze gene expression by fungal, bacterial and viral infections. Inoculation with Magnaporthe oryzae or Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae revealed the enhanced GUS activities in vascular tissues surrounding the symptom sites by each pathogen. Moreover, GUS activity also increased after inoculation with Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Transgenic plants immersed in a solution containing salicylic acid (SA), isonicotinic acid (INA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or abscisic acid (ABA) showed an increased level of GUS activity exclusively in vascular tissues. RT-PCR analysis showed that OsAP77 was induced not only by infection with these pathogens, but also after treatment with SA, INA, H2O2 or ABA. A knockout mutant line of OsAP77 by the insertion of Tos17 after inoculation with M. oryzae, X. oryzae pv. oryzae or CMV showed an enhanced susceptibility compared to wild type.These results suggest that the expression of OsAP77 is induced by pathogen infection and defense related signaling molecules in a vascular tissue specific manner and that this gene has a positive role of defense response against fungal, bacterial and viral infections.
