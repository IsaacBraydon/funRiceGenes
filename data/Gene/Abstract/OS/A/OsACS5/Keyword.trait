OS-ACS5|OsACS5	leaf	Tissue localization of a submergence-induced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase in rice	 Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that in air-grown rice seedlings, OS-ACS5 was expressed at a low level in the shoot apex, meristems, leaf, and adventitious root primordia, and in vascular tissues of nonelongated stems and leaf sheaths
OS-ACS5|OsACS5	seedling	Tissue localization of a submergence-induced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase in rice	 Previously, the OS-ACS5 gene has been shown to be induced during short- as well as long-term complete submergence of seedlings and to be controlled by a balance of gibberellin and abscisic acid in both lowland and deepwater rice| Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that in air-grown rice seedlings, OS-ACS5 was expressed at a low level in the shoot apex, meristems, leaf, and adventitious root primordia, and in vascular tissues of nonelongated stems and leaf sheaths
OS-ACS5|OsACS5	vegetative	Tissue localization of a submergence-induced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase in rice	 Our findings suggest that OS-ACS5 plays a role in vegetative growth of rice under normal conditions and is also recruited for enhanced growth upon complete submergence
OS-ACS5|OsACS5	growth	Tissue localization of a submergence-induced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase in rice	 Our findings suggest that OS-ACS5 plays a role in vegetative growth of rice under normal conditions and is also recruited for enhanced growth upon complete submergence
OS-ACS5|OsACS5	adventitious root	Tissue localization of a submergence-induced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase in rice	 Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that in air-grown rice seedlings, OS-ACS5 was expressed at a low level in the shoot apex, meristems, leaf, and adventitious root primordia, and in vascular tissues of nonelongated stems and leaf sheaths
OS-ACS5|OsACS5	shoot	Tissue localization of a submergence-induced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase in rice	 Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that in air-grown rice seedlings, OS-ACS5 was expressed at a low level in the shoot apex, meristems, leaf, and adventitious root primordia, and in vascular tissues of nonelongated stems and leaf sheaths| The possible implication of OS-ACS5 in root-shoot communication during submergence stress and its putative role in aerenchyma formation upon low-oxygen stress are discussed
OS-ACS5|OsACS5	gibberellin	Tissue localization of a submergence-induced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase in rice	 Previously, the OS-ACS5 gene has been shown to be induced during short- as well as long-term complete submergence of seedlings and to be controlled by a balance of gibberellin and abscisic acid in both lowland and deepwater rice
OS-ACS5|OsACS5	root	Tissue localization of a submergence-induced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase in rice	 Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that in air-grown rice seedlings, OS-ACS5 was expressed at a low level in the shoot apex, meristems, leaf, and adventitious root primordia, and in vascular tissues of nonelongated stems and leaf sheaths| The possible implication of OS-ACS5 in root-shoot communication during submergence stress and its putative role in aerenchyma formation upon low-oxygen stress are discussed
OS-ACS5|OsACS5	stem	Tissue localization of a submergence-induced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase in rice	 Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that in air-grown rice seedlings, OS-ACS5 was expressed at a low level in the shoot apex, meristems, leaf, and adventitious root primordia, and in vascular tissues of nonelongated stems and leaf sheaths
