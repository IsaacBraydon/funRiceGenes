NA	A naturally occurring conditional albino mutant in rice caused by defects in the plastid-localized OsABCI8 transporter.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Grassland Science, College of Forestry and Landscape Architecture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	A wide range of molecules are transported across membranes by the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Plants possess a collection of ABC proteins bearing similarities to the components of prokaryotic multi subunit ABC transporters, designed as ABC group I. However the functions of most of them are not well understood. Here, we characterized a naturally occurring rice mutant that exhibited albino phenotype under continuous rainy days in the field, but gradually recovered to normal green after the rainy season. Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that the phenotypes were caused by a mutation in the OsABCI8 that encoded a member of the ABCI family. Subcellular localization demonstrated that OsABCI8 is a chloroplast ABC transporter. Expression of OsABCI8 is significantly enhanced in rainy days compared to sunny days. Besides defects in chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis, the mutant phenotype is accompanied by a higher accumulation of iron, suggesting that OsABCI8 is involved in iron transportation and/or homeostasis in rice. Our results demonstrate that OsABCI8 represents a conserved ABCI protein involved in transition metals transportation and/or homeostasis and suggest an important role of the plastid-localized OsABCI8 for chloroplast development.
NA	TSC1 enables plastid development under dark conditions, contributing to rice adaptation to transplantation shock.	2017	J Integr Plant Biol	Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Science, Shanghai 200032, China.	Since its domestication from wild rice thousands of years ago, rice has been cultivated largely through transplantation. During transplantation from the nursery to the paddy field, rice seedlings experience transplantation shock which affects their physiology and production. However, the mechanisms underlying transplantation shock and rice adaptation to this shock are largely unknown. Here, we isolated a transplant-sensitive chloroplast-deficient (tsc1) rice mutant that produces albino leaves after transplantation. Blocking light from reaching the juvenile leaves and leaf primordia caused chloroplast deficiencies in transplanted tsc1 seedlings. TSC1 encodes a noncanonical ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter homologous to AtNAP14 and of cyanobacterial origin. We found that TSC1 controls plastid development in rice under dark conditions, and functions independently of light signaling. However, light rescued the tsc1 mutant phenotype in a spectrum-independent manner. TSC1 was upregulated following transplantation, and modulated the iron and copper levels, thereby regulating prolamellar body formation during the early P4 stage of leaf development. Therefore, TSC1 is indispensable for plastid development in the absence of light, and contributes to adaptation to transplantation shock. Our study provides insight into the regulation of plastid development and establishes a framework for improving recovery from transplantation shock in rice.
