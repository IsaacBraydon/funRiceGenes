Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is considered a signal molecule inducing cellular stress. Both heat shock (HS) and Cd can increase H2O2 content. We investigated the involvement of H2O2 in HS- and Cd-mediated changes in the expression of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) in leaves of rice seedlings. HS treatment increased the content of H2O2 before it increased activities of APX and GR in rice leaves. Moreover, HS-induced H2O2 production and APX and GR activities could be counteracted by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors dipehenylene iodonium (DPI) and imidazole (IMD). HS-induced OsAPX2 gene expression was associated with HS-induced APX activity but was not regulated by H2O2. Cd-increased H2O2 content and APX and GR activities were lower with than without HS. Cd did not increase the expression of OsAPX and OsGR without HS treatment. Cd increased H2O2 content by Cd before it increased APX and GR activities without HS. Treatment with DPI and IMD effectively inhibited Cd-induced H2O2 production and APX and GR activities. Moreover, the effects of DPI and IMD could be rescued with H2O2 treatment. H2O2 may be involved in the regulation of HS- and Cd-increased APX and GR activities in leaves of rice seedlings.

10.1007-s00299-010-0985-7.pdf	Enhanced chilling tolerance at the booting stage in rice by transgenic overexpression of the ascorbate peroxidase gene, OsAPXa	2011	Plant Cell Rep	National Agricultural Research Center for Hokkaido Region, Hitsujigaoka 1, Toyohira, Sapporo 062-8555, Japan, yutaka@affrc.go.jp	Low temperatures during the booting stage reduce rice yields by causing cold-induced male sterility. To determine whether antioxidant capacity affects the ability of rice plants to withstand chilling at the booting stage, we produced transgenic rice plants that overexpress OsAPXa and have increased APX activity. The effect of increased APX activity on the levels of H(2)O(2) and lipid peroxidation were determined by measuring H(2)O(2) levels and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in spikelets during cold treatments at the booting stage. The levels of H(2)O(2) and the MDA content increased by 1.5-fold and twofold, respectively in WT plants subjected to a 12 degrees C treatment for 6 days. In contrast, transgenic lines showed small changes in H(2)O(2) levels and MDA content under cold stress, and H(2)O(2) levels and MDA content were significantly lower than in WT plants. APX activity showed negative correlations with levels of H(2)O(2) and MDA content, which increased during cold treatment. Cold tolerance at the booting stage in transgenic lines and WT plants was evaluated. Spikelet fertility was significantly higher in transgenic lines than in WT plants after a 12 degrees C treatment for 6 days. These results indicate that higher APX activity enhances H(2)O(2)-scavenging capacity and protects spikelets from lipid peroxidation, thereby increasing spikelet fertility under cold stress.
J. Exp. Bot.-2001-Sato-145-51.pdf	Heat shock-mediated APX gene expression and protection against chilling injury in rice seedlings	2001	J Exp Bot	Hokkaido National Agricultural Experiment Station, Hitsujigaoka 1, Toyohira‚Äêku, Sapporo 062‚Ä<U+393C><U+3E30>8555, Japan	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings, when kept at 42‚Äâ¬∞C for 24‚Äâh before being kept at 5‚Äâ¬∞C for 7‚Äâd, did not develop chilling injury. Chilling resistance was enhanced in parallel with the period of heat‚Äêtreatment. The level of APX activity was higher in heated seedlings whereas CAT activity was decreased by heat stress. There was no significant difference in SOD activity between heated and unheated seedlings. The elevated activity of APX was sustained after 7‚Äâd of chilling. The cytosolic APX gene expression in response to high and low temperature was analysed with an APXa gene probe. APXa mRNA levels increased within 1‚Äâh after seedlings were exposed to 42‚Äâ¬∞C. Elevated APXa mRNA levels could also be detected after 24‚Äâh of heating. The APXa mRNA level in preheated seedlings was still higher than unheated seedlings under cold stress. The promoter of the APXa gene was cloned from rice genomic DNA by TAIL‚ÄêPCR, and characterized by DNA sequencing. The promoter had a minimal heat shock factor‚Äêbinding motif, 5‚Ä≤‚ÄênGAAnnTTCn‚Ä<U+393C><U+3E30>3‚Äë˘<U+3E32>, located in the 81‚Äâbp upstream of the TATA box. Heat shock induction of the APXa gene could be a possible cause of reduced chilling injury in rice seedlings.
s10529-004-6587-0.pdf	Purification and characterization of two ascorbate peroxidases of rice (Oryza sativa L.) expressed in Escherichia coli	2005	Biotechnol Lett	Alkali Soil Natural Environmental Science Center (ASNESC), Stress Molecular Biology Laboratory, Northeast Forestry University, 150040, Harbin, P.R. China.	To clarify the diversity and function of isozymes of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in plants, a method of producing large quantities of these proteins is needed. Here, we describe an Escherichia coli expression system for the rapid and economic expression of two rice APX genes, APXa and APXb (GeneBank accession Nos. D45423 and AB053297, respectively). The two genes were cloned into the pGEX-6p-3 vector to allow expression of APX as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The GST-APXa and GST-APXb fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column, with final yields of 40 and 73 mg g(-1) dry cells, respectively. Specific activities were 15 and 20 mM ascorbate min(-1) mg(-1) protein, respectively. The K(m) values for ascorbate were 4 and 1 mM, respectively, and those for H(2)O(2) were 0.3 and 0.7 mM, respectively indicating that the two rice isoenzymes have different properties.
NA	The ascorbate peroxidase APX1 is a direct target of a zinc finger transcription factor ZFP36 and a late embryogenesis abundant protein OsLEA5 interacts with ZFP36 to co-regulate OsAPX1 in seed germination in rice.	2017	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210095, China; National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Seed germination is a vital developmental process. Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential repressor of seed germination, while ROS (reactive oxygen species) also plays a vital role in regulating seed germination. ABA could inhibit the production of ROS in seed germination, but the mechanism of ABA reduced ROS production in seed germination was hitherto unknown. Here, by ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation)-seq, we found that ZFP36, a rice zinc finger transcription factor, could directly bind to the promoter of OsAPX1, coding an ascorbate peroxidase (APX) which has the most affinity for H2O2 (substrate; a type of ROS), and act as a transcriptional activator of OsAPX1 promoter. Moreover, ZFP36 could interact with a late embryogenesis abundant protein OsLEA5 to co-regulate the promoter activity of OsAPX1. The seed germination is highly inhibited in ZFP36 overexpression plants under ABA treatment, while an RNA interference (RNAi) mutant of OsLEA5 rice seeds were less sensitive to ABA, and exogenous ASC (ascorbate acid) could alleviate the inhibition induced by ABA. Thus, our conclusion is that OsAPX1 is a direct target of ZFP36 and OsLEA5 could interact with ZFP36 to co-regulate ABA-inhibited seed germination by controlling the expression of OsAPX1.
NA	OsAPX1 Positively Contributes to Rice Blast Resistance.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Department of Plant Pathology, College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Ascorbate peroxidases (APXs) maintain cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis through their peroxidase activity. Here, we report that OsAPX1 also promotes ROS production such that a delicate cellular ROS homeostasis is achieved temporally after Magnaporthe oryzae infection. OsAPX1 specifically induces ROS production through increasing respiratory burst oxidase homologs (OsRBOHs) expression and can be inhibited by DPI, a ROS inhibitor. The time-course experiment data show that the simultaneous induction of OsAPX1 and OsRBOHs leads to ROS accumulation at an early stage; whereas a more durable expression of OsAPX1 leads to ROS scavenging at a later stage. By the temporal switching between ROS inducer and eliminator, OsAPX1 triggers an instant ROS burst upon M. oryzae infection and then a timely elimination of ROS toxicity. We find that OsAPX1 is under the control of the miR172a-OsIDS1 regulatory module. OsAPX1 also affects salicylic acid (SA) synthesis and signaling, which contribute to blast resistance. In conclusion, we show that OsAPX1 is a key factor that connects the upstream gene silencing and transcription regulatory routes with the downstream phytohormone and redox pathway, which provides an insight into the sophisticated regulatory network of rice innate immunity.
NA	OsSGT1 promotes melatonin-ameliorated seed tolerance to chromium stress by affecting the OsABI5-OsAPX1 transcriptional module in rice.	2022	Plant J	College of Agronomy, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, 230036, P.R. China.	Chromium (Cr) pollution threatens plant development and growth. Applications of melatonin (Mel) are emerging as an effective ally to resist stress, but how Mel ameliorates seed germination exposed to heavy metal is poorly understood. Here, we found that seed priming with Mel considerably alleviated the Cr stress during rice seed germination, and that a remarkable amelioration of germination performance was observed in overexpressed OsSGT1 (suppressor of the G2 allele of skp1) lines, while the mutations of OsSGT1 and/or abscisic acid insensitive 5 (OsABI5) noticeably abrogated such Mel-mediated alleviation to Cr stress. Complementation assays suggested that the restored expression of OsSGT1 could not rescue the weak germination exhibitions of sgt1-1abi5 under Cr stress, even for those of Mel priming, but the expression of OsABI5, driven by the promoter of OsSGT1, significantly restored the Mel-ameliorated germination and the expression of ascorbate peroxidase 1 (OsAPX1) in sgt1-1abi5. Further analysis indicated that OsABI5 directly regulated the transcriptional expression of OsAPX1, whose encoding products promoted H(2) O(2) scavenging to maintain redox homeostasis, which was essential for germination. Collectively, this work demonstrates that OsSGT1 coordinates OsABI5 to target OsAPX1 conferring the melatonin-ameliorated germination of Cr-stressed seeds, which provides a guide for the applications of Mel in production.
