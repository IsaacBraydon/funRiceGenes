OsAPX1|APXa	 Thus, our conclusion is that OsAPX1 is a direct target of ZFP36 and OsLEA5 could interact with ZFP36 to co-regulate ABA-inhibited seed germination by controlling the expression of OsAPX1
OsAPX1|APXa	 OsAPX1 specifically induces ROS production through increasing respiratory burst oxidase homologs (OsRBOHs) expression and can be inhibited by DPI, a ROS inhibitor |  The time-course experiment data show that the simultaneous induction of OsAPX1 and OsRBOHs leads to ROS accumulation at an early stage; whereas a more durable expression of OsAPX1 leads to ROS scavenging at a later stage
