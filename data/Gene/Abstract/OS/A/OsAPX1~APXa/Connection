BSR-D1|ZFP36	OsAPX1|APXa	The ascorbate peroxidase APX1 is a direct target of a zinc finger transcription factor ZFP36 and a late embryogenesis abundant protein OsLEA5 interacts with ZFP36 to co-regulate OsAPX1 in seed germination in rice.	The ascorbate peroxidase APX1 is a direct target of a zinc finger transcription factor ZFP36 and a late embryogenesis abundant protein OsLEA5 interacts with ZFP36 to co-regulate OsAPX1 in seed germination in rice.

Here, by ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation)-seq, we found that ZFP36, a rice zinc finger transcription factor, could directly bind to the promoter of OsAPX1, coding an ascorbate peroxidase (APX) which has the most affinity for H2O2 (substrate; a type of ROS), and act as a transcriptional activator of OsAPX1 promoter

OsAPX1|APXa	OsLEA5	An Atypical Late Embryogenesis Abundant Protein OsLEA5 Plays A Positive Role In ABA-Induced Antioxidant Defense In Oryza Sativa L.	OsLEA5 acts as a co-regulator of a transcriptional factor ZFP36 to enhance the expression and the activity of ascorbate peroxidase OsAPX1 to regulate seed germination in rice, but it it unknown whether OsLEA5 is also crucial in plant seedlings under stress conditions

Moreover, we found two homologue of OsLEA5 (5C700, short for Os05g0526700 and 5C300, short for Os05g0584300) which were induced by ABA also interacted with ZFP36 separately; interestingly, the nucleus-located 5C700 could also act as a co-activator of ZFP36 to modulate OsAPX1 while 5C300 which was ABA-induced downexpressed played as an ABA-induced inhibitor of ZFP36 to regulate OsAPX1
