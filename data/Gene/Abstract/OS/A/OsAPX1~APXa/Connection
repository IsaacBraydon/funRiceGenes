OsAPX1|APXa	OsAPX2|APXb	Purification and characterization of two ascorbate peroxidases of rice (Oryza sativa L.) expressed in Escherichia coli	Here, we describe an Escherichia coli expression system for the rapid and economic expression of two rice APX genes, APXa and APXb (GeneBank accession Nos
OsAPX1|APXa	OsAPX2|APXb	Purification and characterization of two ascorbate peroxidases of rice (Oryza sativa L.) expressed in Escherichia coli	The GST-APXa and GST-APXb fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column, with final yields of 40 and 73 mg g(-1) dry cells, respectively
BSR-D1|ZFP36	OsAPX1|APXa	The ascorbate peroxidase APX1 is a direct target of a zinc finger transcription factor ZFP36 and a late embryogenesis abundant protein OsLEA5 interacts with ZFP36 to co-regulate OsAPX1 in seed germination in rice.	The ascorbate peroxidase APX1 is a direct target of a zinc finger transcription factor ZFP36 and a late embryogenesis abundant protein OsLEA5 interacts with ZFP36 to co-regulate OsAPX1 in seed germination in rice.
BSR-D1|ZFP36	OsAPX1|APXa	The ascorbate peroxidase APX1 is a direct target of a zinc finger transcription factor ZFP36 and a late embryogenesis abundant protein OsLEA5 interacts with ZFP36 to co-regulate OsAPX1 in seed germination in rice.	 Here, by ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation)-seq, we found that ZFP36, a rice zinc finger transcription factor, could directly bind to the promoter of OsAPX1, coding an ascorbate peroxidase (APX) which has the most affinity for H2O2 (substrate; a type of ROS), and act as a transcriptional activator of OsAPX1 promoter

Moreover, ZFP36 could interact with a late embryogenesis abundant protein OsLEA5 to co-regulate the promoter activity of OsAPX1
BSR-D1|ZFP36	OsAPX1|APXa	The ascorbate peroxidase APX1 is a direct target of a zinc finger transcription factor ZFP36 and a late embryogenesis abundant protein OsLEA5 interacts with ZFP36 to co-regulate OsAPX1 in seed germination in rice.	 Thus, our conclusion is that OsAPX1 is a direct target of ZFP36 and OsLEA5 could interact with ZFP36 to co-regulate ABA-inhibited seed germination by controlling the expression of OsAPX1
