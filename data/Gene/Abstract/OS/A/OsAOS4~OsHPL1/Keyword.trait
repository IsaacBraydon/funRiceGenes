OsAOS4|OsHPL1	seedling	Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings	 We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots
OsAOS4|OsHPL1	shoot	Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings	 We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots
OsAOS4|OsHPL1	root	Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis	 Similarly, there were undetectable levels of aldehydes in rice roots, in spite of the presence of OsHPL1 transcripts
OsAOS4|OsHPL1	sheath	Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis	 OsHPL1 is ubiquitously expressed, OsHPL2 is expressed in the leaves and leaf sheaths, whereas OsHPL3 is wound inducible and expressed exclusively in leaves
OsAOS4|OsHPL1	leaf	Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis	 OsHPL1 is ubiquitously expressed, OsHPL2 is expressed in the leaves and leaf sheaths, whereas OsHPL3 is wound inducible and expressed exclusively in leaves
