OsABCC1|MRP1	ABC transporter	A rice ABC transporter, OsABCC1, reduces arsenic accumulation in the grain	A rice ABC transporter, OsABCC1, reduces arsenic accumulation in the grain
OsABCC1|MRP1	As transport	A rice ABC transporter, OsABCC1, reduces arsenic accumulation in the grain	A rice ABC transporter, OsABCC1, reduces arsenic accumulation in the grain
OsABCC1|MRP1	As transport	A rice ABC transporter, OsABCC1, reduces arsenic accumulation in the grain	Taken together, our results indicate that OsABCC1 limits As transport to the grains by sequestering As in the vacuoles of the phloem companion cells of the nodes in rice.
