OsABCC1|MRP1	OsPCS1	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	 Map-based cloning identified the responsible genes as OsABCC1 in has1 and OsPCS1 in has2
OsABCC1|MRP1	OsPCS1	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	 The levels of As in grains and node I were similar between the two mutants, suggesting that OsABCC1 preferentially cooperates with OsPCS1 to sequester As, although rice has another phytochelatin synthase, OsPCS2
