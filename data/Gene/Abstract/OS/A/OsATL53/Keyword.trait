OsATL53	root	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.
OsATL53	anther	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.
OsATL53	ja	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.	 These data show OsATL53 affects activity of OsCCR14, and their JA induced degradation by SCF OsFBK1 regulates lignification of rice anthers and roots
OsATL53	JA	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.	 These data show OsATL53 affects activity of OsCCR14, and their JA induced degradation by SCF OsFBK1 regulates lignification of rice anthers and roots
OsATL53	nucleus	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.	 SCF OsFBK1 mediates turn-over of OsATL53 in cytoplasm and nucleus, while of OsCCR14 in the nucleus as validated by cell-free degradation assays
OsATL53	cytoplasm	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.	 SCF OsFBK1 mediates turn-over of OsATL53 in cytoplasm and nucleus, while of OsCCR14 in the nucleus as validated by cell-free degradation assays
OsATL53	cytoplasm	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.	 Biochemically, OsATL53 decreases enzymatic activity of OsCCR14 and sequesters it in the cytoplasm thereby regulating the lignification process
OsATL53	jasmonic	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.
OsATL53	jasmonic acid	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.
OsATL53	lignin	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.	 Knock-down rice transgenics of OsATL53 display increased lignin deposition in the anthers and roots vis-a-vis wild-type, while those of OsCCR14 have decreased lignin content
OsATL53	 ja 	SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.	 These data show OsATL53 affects activity of OsCCR14, and their JA induced degradation by SCF OsFBK1 regulates lignification of rice anthers and roots
