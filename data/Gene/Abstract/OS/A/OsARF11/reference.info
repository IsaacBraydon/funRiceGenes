NA	DS1/OsEMF1 interacts with OsARF11 to control rice architecture by regulation of brassinosteroid signaling.	2018	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Plant height and leaf angle are important determinants of yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Genes involved in regulating plant height and leaf angle were identified in previous studies; however, there are many remaining unknown factors that affect rice architecture.In this study, we characterized a dwarf mutant named ds1 with small grain size and decreased leaf angle,selected from an irradiated population of ssp. japonica variety Nanjing35. The ds1 mutant also showed abnormal floral organs. ds1 plants were insensitive to BL treatment and expression of genes related to BR signaling was changed. An F2 population from a cross between ds1 and indica cultivar 93-11 was used to fine map DS1 and to map-based clone the DS1 allele, which encoded an EMF1-like protein that acted as a transcriptional regulator. DS1 was constitutively expressed in various tissues, and especially highly expressed in young leaves, panicles and seeds. We showed that the DS1 protein interacted with auxin response factor 11 (OsARF11), a major transcriptional regulator of plant height and leaf angle, to co-regulate D61/OsBRI1 expression. These findings provide novel insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms by which DS1 integrates auxin and brassinosteroid signaling in rice.The DS1 gene encoded an EMF1-like protein in rice. The ds1 mutation altered the expression of genes related to BR signaling, and ds1<U+00A0>was insensitive to BL treatment. DS1 interacts with OsARF11 to co-regulate OsBRI1 expression.
