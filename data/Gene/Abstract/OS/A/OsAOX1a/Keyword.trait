AOX1a|OsAOX1a	cold tolerance	"Overexpression of an alternative oxidase gene, OsAOX1a, improves cold tolerance in Oryza sativa L"	"Overexpression of an alternative oxidase gene, OsAOX1a, improves cold tolerance in Oryza sativa L"
AOX1a|OsAOX1a	oxidative	"Overexpression of an alternative oxidase gene, OsAOX1a, improves cold tolerance in Oryza sativa L"	" Both factors were reduced by OsAOX1a overexpression, which revealed that OsAOX1a could reduce oxidative damage under cold stress| Taken together, our results suggested that overexpressing OsAOX1a could improve growth performance of rice under cold stress, which might be closely related to the reduction of reactive oxygen species generation and oxidative damage"
AOX1a|OsAOX1a	temperature	Transcript levels of tandem-arranged alternative oxidase genes in rice are increased by low temperature	 Steady-state mRNA levels of both of the genes for AOX1a and AOX1b were increased under low temperature (4 degrees C)
AOX1a|OsAOX1a	seedling	Overexpression of an alternative oxidase gene, OsAOX1a, improves cold tolerance in Oryza sativa L	 We found that OsAOX1a overexpression could strongly enhance the cold growth of seedlings, especially with respect to root extension

AOX1a|OsAOX1a	mitochondria	Unravelling mitochondrial retrograde regulation in the abiotic stress induction of rice ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE 1 genes	 The results suggest that only the mitochondrial SOD, OsMSD, attenuated the stress induction of OsAOX1a/b specifically| Therefore, our findings demonstrate that abiotic stress initiates the MRR on OsAOX1a/b and that mitochondrial O2
AOX1a|OsAOX1a	growth	Overexpression of an alternative oxidase gene, OsAOX1a, improves cold tolerance in Oryza sativa L	 We found that OsAOX1a overexpression could strongly enhance the cold growth of seedlings, especially with respect to root extension| Taken together, our results suggested that overexpressing OsAOX1a could improve growth performance of rice under cold stress, which might be closely related to the reduction of reactive oxygen species generation and oxidative damage

AOX1a|OsAOX1a	mitochondria	DCW11, down-regulated gene 11 in CW-type cytoplasmic male sterile rice, encoding mitochondrial protein phosphatase 2c is related to cytoplasmic male sterility	 This idea was supported by the up-regulation of alternative oxidase 1a (AOX1a), which is known to be regulated by mitochondrial retrograde signaling, in DCW11 knockdown lines
AOX1a|OsAOX1a	abiotic stress	Unravelling mitochondrial retrograde regulation in the abiotic stress induction of rice ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE 1 genes	" In this study, we analysed the early abiotic stress response of the rice OsAOX1 genes, and the induction of OsAOX1a and OsAOX1b (OsAOX1a/b) was selected as a working model for the stress-induced MRR studies| Therefore, our findings demonstrate that abiotic stress initiates the MRR on OsAOX1a/b and that mitochondrial O2"
