AOX1a|OsAOX1a	OsAOX1b	Transcript levels of tandem-arranged alternative oxidase genes in rice are increased by low temperature	 The predicted AOX1a and AOX1b precursor proteins consist of 332 and 335 amino acid residues, respectively
AOX1a|OsAOX1a	OsAOX1b	Transcript levels of tandem-arranged alternative oxidase genes in rice are increased by low temperature	 Steady-state mRNA levels of both of the genes for AOX1a and AOX1b were increased under low temperature (4 degrees C)
AOX1a|OsAOX1a	OsAOX1b	Transcript levels of tandem-arranged alternative oxidase genes in rice are increased by low temperature	 However, no difference in the pattern of induction of transcription between the genes for AOX1a and AOX1b was observed
AOX1a|OsAOX1a	OsMSD	Unravelling mitochondrial retrograde regulation in the abiotic stress induction of rice ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE 1 genes	 The results suggest that only the mitochondrial SOD, OsMSD, attenuated the stress induction of OsAOX1a/b specifically
AOX1a|OsAOX1a	OsAOX1b	Unravelling mitochondrial retrograde regulation in the abiotic stress induction of rice ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE 1 genes	 In this study, we analysed the early abiotic stress response of the rice OsAOX1 genes, and the induction of OsAOX1a and OsAOX1b (OsAOX1a/b) was selected as a working model for the stress-induced MRR studies
AOX1a|OsAOX1a	DCW11	DCW11, down-regulated gene 11 in CW-type cytoplasmic male sterile rice, encoding mitochondrial protein phosphatase 2c is related to cytoplasmic male sterility	 This idea was supported by the up-regulation of alternative oxidase 1a (AOX1a), which is known to be regulated by mitochondrial retrograde signaling, in DCW11 knockdown lines
AOX1a|OsAOX1a	DCW11	DCW11, down-regulated gene 11 in CW-type cytoplasmic male sterile rice, encoding mitochondrial protein phosphatase 2c is related to cytoplasmic male sterility	 Down-regulation of DCW11 and up-regulation of AOX1a were also observed in two other types of rice CMS
