We identified two genes for alternative oxidase (AOX) from rice. One AOX gene (designated AOX1a) is located approx. 1.9 kb downstream of another AOX gene (designated AOX1b). Comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences of the two AOX genes showed that the AOX1a gene is interrupted by three introns, as are AOX genes of other plants. On the other hand, two introns are inserted in the AOX1b gene. The predicted AOX1a and AOX1b precursor proteins consist of 332 and 335 amino acid residues, respectively. A genomic Southern hybridization analysis indicated that rice has several AOX genes other than the two tandem-arranged AOX genes. Steady-state mRNA levels of both of the genes for AOX1a and AOX1b were increased under low temperature (4 degrees C). However, no difference in the pattern of induction of transcription between the genes for AOX1a and AOX1b was observed.
gmr3150.pdf	Overexpression of an alternative oxidase gene, OsAOX1a, improves cold tolerance in Oryza sativa L	2013	Genet Mol Res	College of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei, China.	Low temperature is a major environmental stress in rice cultivating and production. The alternative oxidase 1 (AOX1) gene is potentially important for genetic engineering to increase cold adaptation. However, previous studies related to this effect have mostly focused on the dicot plants Arabidopsis and tobacco, whereas functional research on rice is limited. In this study, we cloned a rice predominant cold-response AOX1 gene, OsAOX1a. Transgenic rice plants with overexpression of OsAOX1a were obtained. We found that OsAOX1a overexpression could strongly enhance the cold growth of seedlings, especially with respect to root extension. However, growth between transgenic and control plants did not differ under normal conditions. Furthermore, the lipid peroxidation and ion leakage rate were determined after cold treatment in transgenic plants. Both factors were reduced by OsAOX1a overexpression, which revealed that OsAOX1a could reduce oxidative damage under cold stress. Taken together, our results suggested that overexpressing OsAOX1a could improve growth performance of rice under cold stress, which might be closely related to the reduction of reactive oxygen species generation and oxidative damage.
Li-2013-Unravelling mitochon.pdf	Unravelling mitochondrial retrograde regulation in the abiotic stress induction of rice ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE 1 genes	2013	Plant Cell Environ	Institute of Rice Research, Anhui Academy of Agricultural Science, Hefei 230031, China.	Mitochondrial retrograde regulation (MRR) is the transduction of mitochondrial signals to mediate nuclear gene expression. It is not clear whether MRR is a common regulation mechanism in plant abiotic stress response. In this study, we analysed the early abiotic stress response of the rice OsAOX1 genes, and the induction of OsAOX1a and OsAOX1b (OsAOX1a/b) was selected as a working model for the stress-induced MRR studies. We found that the induction mediated by the superoxide ion (O2.(-) )-generating chemical methyl viologen was stronger than that of hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ). The addition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers demonstrated that the stress induction was reduced by eliminating O2.(-) . Furthermore, the stress induction did not rely on chloroplast- or cytosol-derived O2.(-) . Next, we generated transgenic plants overexpressing the superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene at different subcellular locations. The results suggest that only the mitochondrial SOD, OsMSD, attenuated the stress induction of OsAOX1a/b specifically. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that abiotic stress initiates the MRR on OsAOX1a/b and that mitochondrial O2.(-) is involved in the process.
Plant Cell Physiol-2008-Fujii-633-40.pdf	DCW11, down-regulated gene 11 in CW-type cytoplasmic male sterile rice, encoding mitochondrial protein phosphatase 2c is related to cytoplasmic male sterility	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Environmental Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, 1-1 Tsutumidori-Amamiyamachi, Aoba-ku, Sendai 981-8555, Japan.	Causes of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in plants have been studied for two decades, and mitochondrial chimeric genes have been predicted to induce CMS. However, it is unclear what happens after CMS-associated proteins accumulate in mitochondria. In our previous study of microarray analysis, we found that 140 genes are aberrantly regulated in anthers of CW-type CMS of rice (Oryza sativa L.). In the present study, we investigated DCW11, one of the down-regulated genes in CW-CMS encoding a protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C). DCW11 mRNA was preferentially expressed in anthers, with the highest expression in mature pollen. As predicted by the N-terminal sequence, DCW11 signal peptide-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was localized in mitochondria. Knockdown of DCW11 in wild-type rice by RNA interference caused a major loss of seed-set fertility, without visible defect in pollen development. Since this knockdown phenotype resembled that of CW-CMS, we concluded that the down-regulation of DCW11 is correlated with CW-CMS. This idea was supported by the up-regulation of alternative oxidase 1a (AOX1a), which is known to be regulated by mitochondrial retrograde signaling, in DCW11 knockdown lines. Down-regulation of DCW11 and up-regulation of AOX1a were also observed in two other types of rice CMS. Our result indicates that DCW11 could play a role as a mitochondrial signal transduction mediator in pollen germination.
NA	OsPPR939, a nad5 splicing factor, is essential for plant growth and pollen development in rice	2021	Theor Appl Genet	Institute of Crop Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	P-subfamily PPR protein OsPPR939, which can be phosphorylated by OsS6K1, regulates plant growth and pollen development by involving in the splicing of mitochondrial nad5 introns 1, 2, and 3. In land plants, pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins play key roles in mitochondrial group II intron splicing, but how these nucleus-encoded proteins are imported into mitochondria is unknown. To date, a few PPR proteins have been characterized in rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we demonstrate that the mitochondrion-localized P-subfamily PPR protein OsPPR939 is required for the splicing of nad5 introns 1, 2, and 3 in rice. Complete knockout or partial disruption of OsPPR939 function resulted in different degrees of growth retardation and pollen sterility. The dramatically reduced splicing efficiency of these introns in osppr939-4 and osppr939-5 led to reduced mitochondrial complex I abundance and activity and enhanced expression of alternative respiratory pathway genes. Complementation with OsPPR939 rescued the defective plant morphology of osppr939-4 and restored its decreased splicing efficiency of nad5 introns 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, OsPPR939 plays crucial roles in plant growth and pollen development by splicing mitochondrial nad5 introns 1, 2, and 3. More importantly, the 12th amino acid Ser in the N-terminal targeting sequence of OsPPR939 is phosphorylated by OsS6K1, and truncated OsPPR939 with a non-phosphorylatable S12A mutation in its presequence could not be imported into mitochondria, suggesting that phosphorylation of this amino acid plays an important role in the mitochondrial import of OsPPR939. To our knowledge, the 12th residue Ser on OsPPR939 is the first experimentally proven phosphorylation site in PPR proteins. Our results provide a basis for investigating the regulatory mechanism of PPR proteins at the post-translational level.
