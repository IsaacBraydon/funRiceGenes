AOX1a|OsAOX1a	 The aim of this study was to identify the regulatory mechanisms by comparing OsAOX1a-RNAi and wild-type (WT) rice seed during artificial aging treatment |  Weight gain and time for the seed germination percentage decreased to 50% (P50) in OsAOX1a-RNAi rice seed, indicating possible impairment in seed development and storability |  Compared to WT seeds at 100%, and succinate-dependent O(2) consumption, the activity of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, and ATP contents all decreased in the OsAOX1a-RNAi seeds, indicating that mitochondrial status in the OsAOX1a-RNAi seeds after imbibition was weaker than in the WT seeds |  In addition, the reduction in the abundance of Complex I subunits showed that the capacity of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain was significantly inhibited in the OsAOX1a-RNAi seeds at the critical node of seed viability |  The results indicate that ATP production was impaired in the OsAOX1a-RNAi seeds during aging |  Therefore, we conclude that mitochondrial metabolism and alternative pathways were severely inhibited in the OsAOX1a-RNAi seeds at critical node of viability, which could accelerate the collapse of seed viability
