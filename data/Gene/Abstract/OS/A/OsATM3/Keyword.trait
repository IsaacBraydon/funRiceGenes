OsATM3	leaf	Mitochondrial ABC Transporter ATM3 is Essential for Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly.	 In the osatm3 T-DNA insertion mutant, the fourth leaf fails to develop and the lateral roots are short
OsATM3	root	Mitochondrial ABC Transporter ATM3 is Essential for Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly.	 Promoter-¦Â-glucuronidase staining of the transgenic line indicated that OsATM3 is highly expressed in lateral root primordia, root tip meristem zones, and shoot apical meristem regions
OsATM3	root	Mitochondrial ABC Transporter ATM3 is Essential for Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly.	 Massive cell death occurred in the osatm3 root tip meristem zone
OsATM3	shoot	Mitochondrial ABC Transporter ATM3 is Essential for Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly.	 Promoter-¦Â-glucuronidase staining of the transgenic line indicated that OsATM3 is highly expressed in lateral root primordia, root tip meristem zones, and shoot apical meristem regions
OsATM3	cell death	Mitochondrial ABC Transporter ATM3 is Essential for Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly.	 Massive cell death occurred in the osatm3 root tip meristem zone
OsATM3	meristem	Mitochondrial ABC Transporter ATM3 is Essential for Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly.	 Promoter-¦Â-glucuronidase staining of the transgenic line indicated that OsATM3 is highly expressed in lateral root primordia, root tip meristem zones, and shoot apical meristem regions
OsATM3	meristem	Mitochondrial ABC Transporter ATM3 is Essential for Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly.	 Massive cell death occurred in the osatm3 root tip meristem zone
OsATM3	cell cycle	Mitochondrial ABC Transporter ATM3 is Essential for Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly.	 Quantitative RT-PCR revealed transcriptional reprogramming of the genes in the osatm3 and RNAi lines involved in DNA repair and cell cycle arrest
OsATM3	R protein	Mitochondrial ABC Transporter ATM3 is Essential for Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly.	 Cytosolic iron-sulfur protein activities were significantly reduced in both osatm3 and RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic lines
OsATM3	lateral root	Mitochondrial ABC Transporter ATM3 is Essential for Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly.	 In the osatm3 T-DNA insertion mutant, the fourth leaf fails to develop and the lateral roots are short
OsATM3	lateral root	Mitochondrial ABC Transporter ATM3 is Essential for Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly.	 Promoter-¦Â-glucuronidase staining of the transgenic line indicated that OsATM3 is highly expressed in lateral root primordia, root tip meristem zones, and shoot apical meristem regions
OsATM3	iron	Mitochondrial ABC Transporter ATM3 is Essential for Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly.	 The expression profiles of many iron metabolism genes were altered in the osatm3 and RNAi lines
OsATM3	shoot apical meristem	Mitochondrial ABC Transporter ATM3 is Essential for Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly.	 Promoter-¦Â-glucuronidase staining of the transgenic line indicated that OsATM3 is highly expressed in lateral root primordia, root tip meristem zones, and shoot apical meristem regions
OsATM3	reactive oxygen species	Mitochondrial ABC Transporter ATM3 is Essential for Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly.	 Glutathione metabolism was impaired and reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly superoxide, accumulated in osatm3
