OsATM3	 The expression profiles of many iron metabolism genes were altered in the osatm3 and RNAi lines	 Cytosolic iron-sulfur protein activities were significantly reduced in both osatm3 and RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic lines |  The expression profiles of many iron metabolism genes were altered in the osatm3 and RNAi lines |  Quantitative RT-PCR revealed transcriptional reprogramming of the genes in the osatm3 and RNAi lines involved in DNA repair and cell cycle arrest
