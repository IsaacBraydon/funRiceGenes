OsANN3	root	OsANN3, a calcium-dependent lipid binding annexin is a positive regulator of ABA-dependent stress tolerance in rice.	 In addition, overexpression OsANN3 showed better growth under drought stress comparing to wild type, such as longer root length and more stomata closure for reducing water loss by regulating ABA-dependent stress response pathways
OsANN3	growth	OsANN3, a calcium-dependent lipid binding annexin is a positive regulator of ABA-dependent stress tolerance in rice.	 In addition, overexpression OsANN3 showed better growth under drought stress comparing to wild type, such as longer root length and more stomata closure for reducing water loss by regulating ABA-dependent stress response pathways
OsANN3	drought	OsANN3, a calcium-dependent lipid binding annexin is a positive regulator of ABA-dependent stress tolerance in rice.	 Overexpression of OsANN3 in rice significantly increased survival rates under drought stress, while knocking down OsANN3 resulted in sensitivity to drought
