OsANN3	 We found that expression of OsANN3 was induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments |  Overexpression of OsANN3 in rice significantly increased survival rates under drought stress, while knocking down OsANN3 resulted in sensitivity to drought |  Meanwhile, OsANN3 overexpression showed enhanced sensitivity to exogenous ABA |  In addition, overexpression OsANN3 showed better growth under drought stress comparing to wild type, such as longer root length and more stomata closure for reducing water loss by regulating ABA-dependent stress response pathways	 Overexpression of OsANN3 in rice significantly increased survival rates under drought stress, while knocking down OsANN3 resulted in sensitivity to drought |  Meanwhile, OsANN3 overexpression showed enhanced sensitivity to exogenous ABA |  In addition, overexpression OsANN3 showed better growth under drought stress comparing to wild type, such as longer root length and more stomata closure for reducing water loss by regulating ABA-dependent stress response pathways
