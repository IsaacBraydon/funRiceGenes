OsARD4	root	OsARD4 encoding an acireductone dioxygenase improves root architecture in rice by promoting development of secondary roots.	OsARD4 encoding an acireductone dioxygenase improves root architecture in rice by promoting development of secondary roots.
OsARD4	root	OsARD4 encoding an acireductone dioxygenase improves root architecture in rice by promoting development of secondary roots.	 Transgenic ASD16 rice plants engineered for the overexpression of OsARD4 exhibited root growth characteristics similar to those of Nootripathu, including faster radical emergence, more rapid elongation of primary roots, early initiation of crown/lateral roots, and higher root biomass than the non-transgenic plants
