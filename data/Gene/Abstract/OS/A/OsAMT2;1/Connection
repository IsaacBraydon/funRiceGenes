OsAMT2;1	OsDOF18	Transcription Factor OsDOF18 Controls Ammonium Uptake by Inducing Ammonium Transporters in Rice Roots.	 Among the 10 ammonium transporter genes examined here, expression of OsAMT1;1,<U+00A0>OsAMT1;3, OsAMT2;1, and OsAMT4;1 was reduced in osdof18 mutants, demonstrating that the ammonium transporter genes function downstream of OsDOF18
