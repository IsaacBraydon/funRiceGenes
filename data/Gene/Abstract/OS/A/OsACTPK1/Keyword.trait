OsACTPK1	root	Lack of ACTPK1, an STY kinase, enhances ammonium uptake and use and promotes growth of rice seedlings under sufficient external ammonium.	 Root cellular expression of OsACTPK1 also overlapped with that of ammonium-induced OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2
OsACTPK1	growth	Lack of ACTPK1, an STY kinase, enhances ammonium uptake and use and promotes growth of rice seedlings under sufficient external ammonium.	 Furthermore, introduction of OsACTPK1 cDNA fused to the synthetic green fluorescence protein under its own promoter complemented growth and the HATS influx, and suggested plasma membrane localization
OsACTPK1	Kinase	Lack of ACTPK1, an STY kinase, enhances ammonium uptake and use and promotes growth of rice seedlings under sufficient external ammonium.	 Using transcriptome and reverse genetics in ammonium-preferring rice, we revealed the role of the serine/threonine/tyrosine protein kinase gene OsACTPK1 in down-modulation of HATS under sufficient ammonium
OsACTPK1	plasma membrane	Lack of ACTPK1, an STY kinase, enhances ammonium uptake and use and promotes growth of rice seedlings under sufficient external ammonium.	 Furthermore, introduction of OsACTPK1 cDNA fused to the synthetic green fluorescence protein under its own promoter complemented growth and the HATS influx, and suggested plasma membrane localization
