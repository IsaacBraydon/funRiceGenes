OsACX1	jasmonic	Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding	It is suggested that OsACX2 is involved in providing germinating seeds with sugar and energy, while OsACX1 plays a role in the synthesis of jasmonic acid in response to wounding
OsACX1	jasmonic acid	Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding	It is suggested that OsACX2 is involved in providing germinating seeds with sugar and energy, while OsACX1 plays a role in the synthesis of jasmonic acid in response to wounding
OsACX1	seed	Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding	The results from reverse transcriptase-PCR indicate that OsACX1 is expressed in leaves, stems, and roots, but was barely detectable in germinating seeds

OsACX1	stem	Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding	The results from reverse transcriptase-PCR indicate that OsACX1 is expressed in leaves, stems, and roots, but was barely detectable in germinating seeds
OsACX1	stem	Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding	Only OsACX1 was upregulated by wounding, both locally and systemically
OsACX1	root	Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding	The results from reverse transcriptase-PCR indicate that OsACX1 is expressed in leaves, stems, and roots, but was barely detectable in germinating seeds
