OsANN4	root	OsANN4 modulates ROS production and mediates Ca 2+ influx in response to ABA 	 Under ABA treatment, the plants in which OsANN4 was knocked down by RNA interference showed some visible phenotypic changes compared to the wild type, such as a lower rooting rate and shorter shoot and root lengths
OsANN4	shoot	OsANN4 modulates ROS production and mediates Ca 2+ influx in response to ABA 	 Under ABA treatment, the plants in which OsANN4 was knocked down by RNA interference showed some visible phenotypic changes compared to the wild type, such as a lower rooting rate and shorter shoot and root lengths
