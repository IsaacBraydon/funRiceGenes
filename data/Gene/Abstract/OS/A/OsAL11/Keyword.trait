OsAL11	seed	Natural variation of Alfin-like family affects seed size and drought tolerance in rice.	1 and Hap7 of OsAL11 were favorable haplotypes of seed weight and germination under osmotic stress
OsAL11	drought	Natural variation of Alfin-like family affects seed size and drought tolerance in rice.	1 and OsAL11 in rice weakened the tolerance to drought in the adult stage
OsAL11	tolerance	Natural variation of Alfin-like family affects seed size and drought tolerance in rice.	1 and OsAL11 in rice weakened the tolerance to drought in the adult stage
OsAL11	stress	Natural variation of Alfin-like family affects seed size and drought tolerance in rice.	1 and Hap7 of OsAL11 were favorable haplotypes of seed weight and germination under osmotic stress
OsAL11	seed weight	Natural variation of Alfin-like family affects seed size and drought tolerance in rice.	1 and Hap7 of OsAL11 were favorable haplotypes of seed weight and germination under osmotic stress
OsAL11	abscisic acid	Natural variation of Alfin-like family affects seed size and drought tolerance in rice.	1 and osal11 mutants have larger seeds and are more sensitive to abscisic acid and mannitol during germination stage
