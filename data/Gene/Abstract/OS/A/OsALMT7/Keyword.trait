OsALMT7	panicle	OsALMT7 Maintains Panicle Size and Grain Yield in Rice by Mediating Malate Transport.	OsALMT7 Maintains Panicle Size and Grain Yield in Rice by Mediating Malate Transport.
OsALMT7	panicle	OsALMT7 Maintains Panicle Size and Grain Yield in Rice by Mediating Malate Transport.	 Consistent with a function for OsALMT7 as a malate transporter, the panicle of the paab1-1 mutant contained less malate than wild type, particularly at the apical portions, and injection of malate into the paab1-1 panicle could alleviate the spikelet degeneration phenotype
