NA	A putative AGO protein, OsAGO17, positively regulates grain size and grain weight through OsmiR397b in rice.	2019	Plant Biotechnol J	College of Life Science, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China.	Argonaute (AGO) proteins and small RNAs (sRNAs) are core components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). It has been reported that miRNAs regulate plant height and grain size in rice, but which AGO is involved in grain size regulation remains unclear. Here, we report that enhanced expression of OsAGO17, a putative AGO protein, could improve grain size and weight and promote stem development in rice. Cytological evidence showed that these effects are mainly caused by alteration of cell elongation. Expression analyses showed that OsAGO17 was highly expressed in young panicles and nodes, which was consistent with the expression pattern of OsmiR397b. SRNA sequencing, stem-loop RT-PCR and sRNA blotting showed that the expression of OsmiR397b was reduced in ago17 and enhanced in the OsAGO17 OE lines. Four OsmiR397b target laccase (LAC) genes showed complementary expression patterns with OsAGO17 and OsmiR397b. Combined with the results of immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis, we suggested that OsAGO17 formed an RISC with OsmiR397b and affected rice development by suppression of LAC expression. In conclusion, OsAGO17 might be a critical protein in the sRNA pathway and positively regulates grain size and weight in rice.
NA	Rice-specific Argonaute 17 controls reproductive growth and yield-associated phenotypes	2020	Plant Mol Biol	National Centre for Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, GKVK Campus, Bangalore, 560065, India.	This manuscript describes the functions of an Argonaute protein named AGO17 in rice. AGO17 is required for the development of rice reproductive tissues. Argonaute (AGO) proteins are a well-conserved multigene family of regulators mediating gene silencing across eukaryotes. Monocot plants have additional members of AGO, the functions of which are poorly understood. Among the non-dicot AGO1 clade members in monocots, AGO17 expresses highly in reproductive tissues. Here we show that overexpression of Oryza sativa indica AGO17 in rice resulted in robust growth and increased yield, whereas its silencing resulted in reduced panicle length, less fertility, and poor growth. Small (s)RNA transcriptome analysis revealed misregulation of several miRNAs and other categories of sRNAs in silenced and overexpression lines, in agreement with its likely competition with other AGO1 clade members. Targets of differentially expressed miRNAs included previously unreported target RNAs coding for proteins involved in development, phase transition, and transport. Our results indicate a distinctive role for OsAGO17 in rice reproductive development that could be harnessed to improve yield.
