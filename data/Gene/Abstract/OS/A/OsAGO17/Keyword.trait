OsAGO17	grain	A putative AGO protein, OsAGO17, positively regulates grain size and grain weight through OsmiR397b in rice.	 In conclusion, OsAGO17 might be a critical protein in the sRNA pathway and positively regulates grain size and weight in rice
OsAGO17	development	A putative AGO protein, OsAGO17, positively regulates grain size and grain weight through OsmiR397b in rice.	 Combined with the results of immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis, we suggested that OsAGO17 formed an RISC with OsmiR397b and affected rice development by suppression of LAC expression
OsAGO17	grain size	A putative AGO protein, OsAGO17, positively regulates grain size and grain weight through OsmiR397b in rice.	 In conclusion, OsAGO17 might be a critical protein in the sRNA pathway and positively regulates grain size and weight in rice
OsAGO17	development	Rice-specific Argonaute 17 controls reproductive growth and yield-associated phenotypes	 Our results indicate a distinctive role for OsAGO17 in rice reproductive development that could be harnessed to improve yield
OsAGO17	yield	Rice-specific Argonaute 17 controls reproductive growth and yield-associated phenotypes	 Our results indicate a distinctive role for OsAGO17 in rice reproductive development that could be harnessed to improve yield
OsAGO17	reproductive	Rice-specific Argonaute 17 controls reproductive growth and yield-associated phenotypes	 Our results indicate a distinctive role for OsAGO17 in rice reproductive development that could be harnessed to improve yield
