OsAO4	immunity	Co-evolved ascorbate oxidases of plant and the blast fungus orchestrate host apoplast redox state to modulate rice immunity.	 In addition, we found that MoAo1, OsAO3, and OsAO4 all undergo polymorphic variations whose varied interactions orchestrate pathogen virulence and rice immunity
