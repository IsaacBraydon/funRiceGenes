Apoplast ascorbate oxidases (AOs) play a critical role in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated innate host immunity by regulating the apoplast redox state. To date, little is known regarding how apoplastic effectors of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae modulate the rice apoplast redox state to subvert its immunity. Here, we demonstrated M. oryzae MoAo1 as an ascorbate oxidase that plays a role in virulence through modulating the host apoplast redox status. We showed that MoAo1 inhibits host ascorbate oxidases OsAO3 and OsAO4, which also regulate apoplast redox status and host immunity. In addition, we found that MoAo1, OsAO3, and OsAO4 all undergo polymorphic variations whose varied interactions orchestrate pathogen virulence and rice immunity. Our studies reveal a critical role of extracellular redox enzymes during the rice blast and shed light on the importance of the redox state and its regulation during pathogen-host interactions.
