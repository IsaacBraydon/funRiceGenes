OsABI4	OsTCP19	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways	Interactions of OsTCP19 with OsABI4 and OsULT1 further suggest its function in modulation of abscisic acid pathways and chromatin structure
OsABI4	OsHIPL1	OsHIPL1, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.	 The expression of abscisic acid-insensitive 3 (OsABI3), OsABI4 and OsABI5 was significantly up-regulated in germinating seeds of OsHIPL1 mutants and NIL-qsv3 line compared to IR26 plants
