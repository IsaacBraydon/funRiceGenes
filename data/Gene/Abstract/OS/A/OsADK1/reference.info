Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis relies on the formation of arbuscules for efficient nutrient exchange between plants and AM fungi. In this study, we identified a novel kinase gene in rice named OsADK1 (Arbuscule Development Kinase 1) that is required for arbuscule development. By obtaining OsADK1pro::GUS transgenic rice plants and also generating Osadk1 mutants via CRISPR/Cas9 technique, OsADK1 was revealed to be specifically induced in the arbusculated cortical cells and mutations in OsADK1 resulted in an extremely low colonisation rate (c. 3%) of rice roots by AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. In the mutant roots, the very few observed arbuscules nearly all arrested at an early &#x27;trunk-forming&#x27; phase without forming any branches. Increasing the inoculum strength of AM fungus or cocultivation with a wild-type nurse plant did not result in the rescue of the arbuscule phenotype. Transcriptome sequencing of both nursed and un-nursed Osadk1 mutants then revealed that the mutation of OsADK1 could greatly affect the AM symbiotic programme, including many key transcription factors such as RAM1 and WRI5. OsADK1 therefore represents a new rice kinase that is required for arbuscule branching. Its identification opens a new window to explore the elaborate signal transduction pathway that determines arbuscule development during plant-fungus symbiosis.
