NA	OsADK1, a novel kinase regulating arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	2022	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Department of Biology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China.	Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis relies on the formation of arbuscules for efficient nutrient exchange between plants and AM fungi. In this study, we identified a novel kinase gene in rice named OsADK1 (Arbuscule Development Kinase 1) that is required for arbuscule development. By obtaining OsADK1pro::GUS transgenic rice plants and also generating Osadk1 mutants via CRISPR/Cas9 technique, OsADK1 was revealed to be specifically induced in the arbusculated cortical cells and mutations in OsADK1 resulted in an extremely low colonisation rate (c. 3%) of rice roots by AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. In the mutant roots, the very few observed arbuscules nearly all arrested at an early &#x27;trunk-forming&#x27; phase without forming any branches. Increasing the inoculum strength of AM fungus or cocultivation with a wild-type nurse plant did not result in the rescue of the arbuscule phenotype. Transcriptome sequencing of both nursed and un-nursed Osadk1 mutants then revealed that the mutation of OsADK1 could greatly affect the AM symbiotic programme, including many key transcription factors such as RAM1 and WRI5. OsADK1 therefore represents a new rice kinase that is required for arbuscule branching. Its identification opens a new window to explore the elaborate signal transduction pathway that determines arbuscule development during plant-fungus symbiosis.
NA	A PHR-regulated receptor-like kinase, OsADK1 is required for mycorrhizal symbiosis and phosphate starvation responses.	2022	New Phytol	Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, 200234, China.	• Most land plants associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to secure mineral nutrient acquisition, especially that of phosphorus. A phosphate starvation response (PHR)-centered network regulates arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis. • Here, we identified 520 direct target genes for the rice transcription factor OsPHR1/2/3 during AM symbiosis using transcriptome deep sequencing and DNA affinity purification sequencing. These genes were involved in strigolactone biosynthesis, transcriptional reprogramming, and bi-directional nutrient exchange. • Moreover, we identified the receptor-like kinase, Arbuscule Development Kinase 1 (OsADK1) as a new target of OsPHR1/2/3. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transactivation assays showed that OsPHR2 can bind directly to the P1BS elements within the OsADK1 promoter to activate its transcription. OsADK1 appeared to be required for mycorrhizal colonization and arbuscule development. In addition, Hydroponic experiments suggested that OsADK1 may be involved in plant Pi starvation responses. • Our findings validated a role for OsPHR1/2/3 as master regulators of mycorrhizal-related genes involved in various stages of symbiosis and uncovered a new RLK involved in AM symbiosis and plant Pi starvation responses.
