OsADK1	OsPHR2	A PHR-regulated receptor-like kinase, OsADK1 is required for mycorrhizal symbiosis and phosphate starvation responses.	 Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transactivation assays showed that OsPHR2 can bind directly to the P1BS elements within the OsADK1 promoter to activate its transcription
