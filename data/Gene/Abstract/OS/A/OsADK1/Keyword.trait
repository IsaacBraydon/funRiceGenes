OsADK1	transcription factor	OsADK1, a novel kinase regulating arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	 Transcriptome sequencing of both nursed and un-nursed Osadk1 mutants then revealed that the mutation of OsADK1 could greatly affect the AM symbiotic programme, including many key transcription factors such as RAM1 and WRI5
OsADK1	development	OsADK1, a novel kinase regulating arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	 In this study, we identified a novel kinase gene in rice named OsADK1 (Arbuscule Development Kinase 1) that is required for arbuscule development
OsADK1	Kinase	OsADK1, a novel kinase regulating arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	 In this study, we identified a novel kinase gene in rice named OsADK1 (Arbuscule Development Kinase 1) that is required for arbuscule development
OsADK1	Kinase	OsADK1, a novel kinase regulating arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	 OsADK1 therefore represents a new rice kinase that is required for arbuscule branching
OsADK1	kinase	OsADK1, a novel kinase regulating arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	 In this study, we identified a novel kinase gene in rice named OsADK1 (Arbuscule Development Kinase 1) that is required for arbuscule development
OsADK1	kinase	OsADK1, a novel kinase regulating arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	 OsADK1 therefore represents a new rice kinase that is required for arbuscule branching
OsADK1	branching	OsADK1, a novel kinase regulating arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	 OsADK1 therefore represents a new rice kinase that is required for arbuscule branching
