OsACE2	growth	Acetyltransferase OsACE2 acts as a regulator to reduce the environmental risk of oxyfluorfen to rice production.	 Conversely, knocking out OsACE2 resulted in compromised growth phenotypes compared to the wild-type (WT)
OsACE2	growth	Acetyltransferase OsACE2 acts as a regulator to reduce the environmental risk of oxyfluorfen to rice production.	 Collectively, OsACE2 plays a primary role in catabolizing OFF residues in rice through multiple degradation pathways and reducing OFF in its growth environment
OsACE2	resistance	Acetyltransferase OsACE2 acts as a regulator to reduce the environmental risk of oxyfluorfen to rice production.	 To demonstrate the regulatory role of OsACE2 in resistance to OFF toxicity, we generated OsACE2 overexpression (OE) and knockout mutant using genetic transformation and gene-editing technologies (CRISPR/Cas9)
