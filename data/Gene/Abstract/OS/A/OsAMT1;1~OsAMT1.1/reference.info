BACKGROUND: Ammonium is one of the major forms in which nitrogen is available for plant growth. OsAMT1;1 is a high-affinity ammonium transporter in rice (Oryza sativa L.), responsible for ammonium uptake at low nitrogen concentration. The expression pattern of the gene has been reported. However, variations in its nucleotides and the evolutionary pathway of its descent from wild progenitors are yet to be elucidated. In this study, nucleotide diversity of the gene OsAMT1;1 and the diversity pattern of seven gene fragments spanning a genomic region approximately 150 kb long surrounding the gene were surveyed by sequencing a panel of 216 rice accessions including both cultivated rice and wild relatives. RESULTS: Nucleotide polymorphism (Pi) of OsAMT1;1 was as low as 0.00004 in cultivated rice (Oryza sativa), only 2.3% of that in the common wild rice (O. rufipogon). A single dominant haplotype was fixed at the locus in O. sativa. The test values for neutrality were significantly negative in the entire region stretching 5' upstream and 3' downstream of the gene in all accessions. The value of linkage disequilibrium remained high across a 100 kb genomic region around OsAMT1;1 in O. sativa, but fell rapidly in O. rufipogon on either side of the promoter of OsAMT1;1, demonstrating a strong natural selection within or nearby the ammonium transporter. CONCLUSIONS: The severe reduction in nucleotide variation at OsAMT1;1 in rice was caused by a selective sweep around OsAMT1;1, which may reflect the nitrogen uptake system under strong selection by the paddy soil during the domestication of rice. Purifying selection also occurred before the wild rice diverged into its two subspecies, namely indica and japonica. These findings would provide useful insights into the processes of evolution and domestication of nitrogen uptake genes in rice.
FP05165.pdf	Over-expression of the rice OsAMT1-1 gene increases ammonium uptake and content, but impairs growth and development of plants under high ammonium nutrition	2006	Functional Plant Biology	Research School of Biological Sciences, The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 2000, Australia. 	A transgenic approach was undertaken to investigate the role of a rice ammonium transporter (OsAMT1-1) in ammonium uptake and consequent ammonium assimilation under different nitrogen regimes. Transgenic lines overexpressing OsAMT1-1 were produced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of two rice cultivars, Taipei 309 and Jarrah, with an OsAMT1-1 cDNA gene construct driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter. Transcript levels of OsAMT1-1 in both Taipei 309 and Jarrah transgenic lines correlated positively with transgene copy number. Shoot and root biomass of some transgenic lines decreased during seedling and early vegetative stage compared to the wild type, especially when grown under high (2 mm) ammonium nutrition. Transgenic plants, particularly those of cv. Jarrah recovered in the mid-vegetative stage under high ammonium nutrition. Roots of the transgenic plants showed increased ammonium uptake and ammonium content. We conclude that the decreased biomass of the transgenic lines at early stages of growth might be caused by the accumulation of ammonium in the roots owing to the inability of ammonium assimilation to match the greater ammonium uptake.
Gaur-2012-Influence of differe.pdf	Influence of different nitrogen inputs on the members of ammonium transporter and glutamine synthetase genes in two rice genotypes having differential responsiveness to nitrogen	2012	Mol Biol Rep	Department of Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering, College of Basic Sciences and Humanities, G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar, Uttarakhand, India.	Two aromatic rice genotypes, Pusa Basmati 1 (PB1) and Kalanamak 3119 (KN3119) having 120 and 30 kg/ha optimum nitrogen requirement respectively, to produce optimal yield, were chosen to understand their differential nitrogen responsiveness. Both the genotypes grown under increasing nitrogen inputs showed differences in seed/panicle, 1,000 seed weight, %nitrogen in the biomass and protein content in the seeds. All these parameters in PB1 were found to be in the increasing order in contrast to KN3119 which showed declined response on increasing nitrogen dose exceeding the normal dose indicating that both the genotypes respond differentially to the nitrogen inputs. Gene expression analysis of members of ammonium transporter gene family in flag leaves during active grain filling stage revealed that all the three members of OsAMT3 family genes (OsAMT1;1-3), only one member of OsAMT2 family i.e., OsAMT2;3 and the high affinity OsAMT1;1 were differentially expressed and were affected by different doses of nitrogen. In both the genotypes, both increase and decline in seed protein contents matched with the expressions levels of OsAMT1;1, OsGS1;1 and OsGS1;2 in the flag leaves during grain filling stage indicating that high nitrogen nutrition in KN3119 probably causes the repression of these genes which might be important during grain filling.
J. Exp. Bot.-2014-Ranathunge-jxb-ert458.pdf	AMT1;1 transgenic rice plants with enhanced NH4(+) permeability show superior growth and higher yield under optimal and suboptimal NH4(+) conditions	2014	J Exp Bot	Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada, N1G 2W1.	The major source of nitrogen for rice (Oryza sativa L.) is ammonium (NH4(+)). The NH4(+) uptake of roots is mainly governed by membrane transporters, with OsAMT1;1 being a prominent member of the OsAMT1 gene family that is known to be involved in NH4(+) transport in rice plants. However, little is known about its involvement in NH4(+) uptake in rice roots and subsequent effects on NH4(+) assimilation. This study shows that OsAMT1;1 is a constitutively expressed, nitrogen-responsive gene, and its protein product is localized in the plasma membrane. Its expression level is under the control of circadian rhythm. Transgenic rice lines (L-2 and L-3) overexpressing the OsAMT1;1 gene had the same root structure as the wild type (WT). However, they had 2-fold greater NH4(+) permeability than the WT, whereas OsAMT1;1 gene expression was 20-fold higher than in the WT. Analogous to the expression, transgenic lines had a higher NH4(+) content in the shoots and roots than the WT. Direct NH4(+) fluxes in the xylem showed that the transgenic lines had significantly greater uptake rates than the WT. Higher NH4(+) contents also promoted higher expression levels of genes in the nitrogen assimilation pathway, resulting in greater nitrogen assimilates, chlorophyll, starch, sugars, and grain yield in transgenic lines than in the WT under suboptimal and optimal nitrogen conditions. OsAMT1;1 also enhanced overall plant growth, especially under suboptimal NH4(+) levels. These results suggest that OsAMT1;1 has the potential for improving nitrogen use efficiency, plant growth, and grain yield under both suboptimal and optimal nitrogen fertilizer conditions.
j.1365-3040.2003.01023.x.pdf	Differential expression of three members of the AMT1 gene family encoding putative high-affinity NH4+ transporters in roots of Oryza sativa subspecies indica	2003	Plant Cell Environ	Department of Botany, the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z4, Agriculture and AgriFood Canada, Shelterbelt Centre Indian Head SK, Canada S0G 2K0 and Division of Biology, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0116, USA.	In order to investigate the molecular basis of high-affinity ammonium absorption by roots of rice plants (Oryza sativa subspecies indica) the expression patterns of three members of the AMT1 family of genes in rice seedling roots in response to altered nitrogen provision and diurnal changes in irradiance were examined. The 13NH4+ influx and transcript levels of OsAMT1.1 in roots decreased several fold within 48 h when plants acclimated to 10 micro m external NH4+ for 3 weeks were transferred to 10 mm NH4+. Likewise when plants acclimated in 10 mm NH4+ were transferred to 10 micro m NH4+, there was an equally rapid up-regulation of OsAMT1.1 and 13NH4+ influx in the roots. Changes in transcript abundance of OsAMT1.2 following these treatments were approximately 50% less than in OsAMT1.1, and changes of OsAMT1.3 expression were even less. By contrast, in response to the diurnal changes of irradiance, root transcript abundance of OsAMT1.3 and 15NH4+ influx increased approximately three-fold late in the photoperiod, whereas OsAMT1.1 and OsAMT1.2 exhibited only modest changes. The present results suggest that high-affinity NH4+ influx is differentially regulated at the transcriptional level through the expression of three members of the OsAMT1 family of genes in roots of rice seedlings in response to changes of N status and daily irradiance. In general, these findings are in agreement with earlier observations in Arabidopsis and tomato.
Plant Cell Physiol-2003-Sonoda-1396-402.pdf	Feedback regulation of the ammonium transporter gene family AMT1 by glutamine in rice	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	Division of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, Hokkaido University, Kita-ku N10-W8, Sapporo, 060-0810 Japan.	The three members of the rice OsAMT1 gene family of ammonium transporters show distinct expression patterns; constitutive and ammonium-promoted expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1; root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2; root-specific and nitrogen-repressible expression for OsAMT1;3 [Sonoda et al. (2003), Plant Cell Physiol. 44: 726]. To clarify the feedback mechanisms, and to identify regulatory factors of the OsAMT1 genes, the accumulation of the three mRNAs and its dependence on endogenous nitrogen compounds (as quantified by capillary electrophoresis) was studied. Ammonium application to roots following a period of nitrogen starvation induced accumulation of OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2 mRNA, but a decrease of OsAMT1;3 mRNA levels. The expression patterns of the three genes showed good correlation (positive in OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2, negative in OsAMT1;3) with the root tissue contents of glutamine but not of ammonium. The ammonium effects on OsAMT1 expression were prevented by methionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase. Moreover, glutamine had the same effect on transcriptional regulation of OsAMT1 genes as ammonium, indicating that glutamine rather than ammonium controls the expression of ammonium transporter genes in rice. These results imply that rice possesses unique mechanisms of adaptation to variable nitrogen sources in the soil.
Plant Cell Physiol-2003-Sonoda-726-34.pdf	Distinct expression and function of three ammonium transporter genes (OsAMT1;1-1;3) in rice	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	Division of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, Hokkaido University, Kita-ku N10-W8, Sapporo, 060-0810 Japan.	To study the regulation of ammonium uptake into rice roots, three ammonium transporter genes (OsAMT1;1, 1;2 and 1;3; Oryza sativa ammonium transporter) were isolated and examined. OsAMT1s belong to AMT1 family, containing 11 putative transmembrane-spanning domains. Southern blot analysis and screening of the rice genome database confirmed that with OsAMT1;1-1;3 the complete AMT1 family of rice had been isolated. Heterologous expression of OsAMT1s in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant 31019b showed that all three OsAMT1s exhibit ammonium transport activity. Northern blot analysis showed a distinct expression pattern for the three genes; more constitutive expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1, root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2, and root-specific and nitrogen-derepressible expression for OsAMT1;3. In situ mRNA detection revealed that OsAMT1;2 is expressed in the central cylinder and cell surface of root tips. This gene expression analysis revealed a distinct nitrogen-dependent regulation for AMTs in rice, differing from that in tomato or Arabidopsis:
NA	The rice OsAMT1;1 is a proton-independent feedback regulated ammonium transporter.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 71, East Beijing Road, Nanjing, 210008, China.	Functional identification of a relatively lower affinity ammonium transporter, OsAMT1;1, which is a proton-independent feedback regulated ammonium transporter in rice. Rice genome contains at least 12 ammonium transporters, though their functionality has not been clearly resolved. Here, we demonstrate the functional properties of OsAMT1;1 applying functional complementation and (15)NH4 (+) uptake determination in yeast cells in combination with electrophysiological measurements in Xenopus oocytes. Our results show that OsAMT1;1 is a NH4 (+) transporter with relatively lower affinity to NH4 (+) (110-129 μM in oocytes and yeast cells, respectively). Under our experimental conditions, OsAMT1;1-mediated NH4 (+) uptake or current is not significantly modulated by extra- or intracellular pH gradient, suggesting that this transporter probably functions as a NH4 (+) uniporter. Inhibition of yeast growth or currents elicited from oocytes by ammonium assimilation inhibitor L-methionine sulfoximine indicates that NH4 (+) transport by OsAMT1;1 is likely feedback regulated by accumulation of the substrate. In addition, effects of phosphorylation inhibitors imply that NH4 (+) uptake by OsAMT1;1 is also modulated by tyrosine-specific protein kinase or calcium-regulated serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase involved phosphorylation processes.
NA	The OsAMT1.1 gene functions in ammonium uptake and ammonium-potassium homeostasis over low and high ammonium concentration ranges.	2016	J Genet Genomics	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement and MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Lower-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Rice (Oryza sativa) grown in paddy fields is an ammonium (NH4(+))-preferring crop; however, its AMT-type NH4(+) transporters that mediate root N acquisition have not been well characterized yet. In this study, we analyzed the expression pattern and physiological function of the OsAMT1.1 gene of the AMT1 subfamily in rice. OsAMT1.1 is located in the plasma membrane and is mainly expressed in the root epidermis, stele and mesophyll cells. Disruption of the OsAMT1.1 gene decreased the uptake of NH4(+), and the growth of roots and shoots under both low NH4(+) and high NH4(+) conditions. OsAMT1.1 contributed to the short-term (5<U+00A0>min) (15)NH4(+) influx rate by approximately one-quarter, irrespective of the NH4(+) concentration. Knockout of OsAMT1.1 significantly decreased the total N transport from roots to shoots under low NH4(+) conditions. Moreover, compared with the wild type, the osamt1.1 mutant showed an increase in the potassium (K) absorption rate under high NH4(+) conditions and a decrease under low NH4(+) conditions. The mutants contained a significantly high concentration of K in both the roots and shoots at a limited K (0.1<U+00A0>mmol/L) supply when NH4(+) was replete. Taken together, the results indicated that OsAMT1.1 significantly contributes to the NH4(+) uptake under both low- and high- NH4(+) conditions and plays an important role in N-K homeostasis in rice.
NA	Three polarly localized ammonium transporter 1 members are cooperatively responsible for ammonium uptake in rice under low ammonium condition	2021	New Phytol	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Chuo 2-20-1, Kurashiki, 710-0046, Japan	Ammonium is a preferential nitrogen form for rice (Oryza sativa) grown in paddy field, but the molecular mechanisms for ammonium uptake have not been well understood. We functionally characterized three members belonging to ammonium transporter 1 (AMT1) and investigated their contributions to ammonium uptake. Spatial expression analysis showed that the upregulated expression of OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2 and downregulated expression of OsAMT1;3 by ammonium were higher in the root mature region than in the root tips. All OsAMT1 members were polarly localized at the distal side of exodermis in the mature region of crown roots and lateral roots. Upon exposure to ammonium, localization of OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2 was also observed in the endoplasmic reticulum, but their abundance in the plasma membrane was not changed. Single knockout of either gene did not affect ammonium uptake, but knockout of all three genes resulted in 95% reduction of ammonium uptake. However, the nitrogen uptake did not differ between the wild-type rice and triple mutants at high ammonium and nitrate supply. Our results indicate that three OsAMT1 members are cooperatively required for uptake of low ammonium in rice roots and that they undergo a distinct regulatory mechanism in response to ammonium.
NA	Ammonium transporter 1 increases rice resistance to sheath blight by promoting nitrogen assimilation and ethylene signalling.	2022	Plant Biotechnol J	College of Plant Protection, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China.	Sheath blight (ShB) significantly threatens rice yield production. However, the underlying mechanism of ShB defence in rice remains largely unknown. Here, we identified a highly ShB-susceptible mutant Ds-m which contained a mutation at the ammonium transporter 1;1 (AMT1;1) D(358) N. AMT1;1 D(358) N interacts with AMT1;1, AMT1;2 and AMT1;3 to inhibit the ammonium transport activity. The AMT1 RNAi was more susceptible and similar to the AMT1;1 D(358) N mutant; however, plants with higher NH(4) (+) uptake activity were less susceptible to ShB. Glutamine synthetase 1;1 (GS1;1) mutant gs1;1 and overexpressors (GS1;1 OXs) were more and less susceptible to ShB respectively. Furthermore, AMT1;1 overexpressor (AMT1;1 OX)/gs1;1 and gs1;1 exhibited a similar response to ShB, suggesting that ammonium assimilation rather than accumulation controls the ShB defence. Genetic and physiological assays further demonstrated that plants with higher amino acid or chlorophyll content promoted rice resistance to ShB. Interestingly, the expression of ethylene-related genes was higher in AMT1;1 OX and lower in RNAi mutants than in wild-type. Also, ethylene signalling positively regulated rice resistance to ShB and NH(4) (+) uptake, suggesting that ethylene signalling acts downstream of AMT and also NH(4) (+) uptake is under feedback control. Taken together, our data demonstrated that the AMT1 promotes rice resistance to ShB via the regulation of diverse metabolic and signalling pathways.
