Symbol	Expression
OsAOS2	 The expressions of defense-related genes, OsPR10a and OsAOS2, were highly up-regulated in response to JA, whereas OsEDS1 was down-regulated
OsAOS2	 The antisense expression of OsAOS1 (as-aos1) or OsAOS2 (as-aos2) decreased levels of SSB- or BPH-induced JA, which, in turn, reduced the production of SSB-induced trypsin protease inhibitor (TrypPI) and volatiles as well as the resistance of rice to SSB
