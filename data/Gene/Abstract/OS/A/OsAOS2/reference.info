WRKY transcription factors are crucial regulatory components of plant responses to pathogen infection. In the present study, we report isolation and functional characterization of the pathogen-responsive rice WRKY30 gene, whose transcripts accumulate rapidly in response to salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) treatment. Overexpression of WRKY30 in rice enhanced resistance to rice sheath blight fungus Rhizoctonia solani and blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea. The enhanced resistance in the transgenic lines overexpressing WRKY30 was associated with activated expression of JA synthesis-related genes LOX, AOS2 and pathogenesis-related (PR)3 and PR10, and increased endogenous JA accumulation under the challenge of fungal pathogens. WRKY30 was nuclear-localized and had transcriptional activation ability in yeast cells, supporting that it functions as a transcription factor. Together, our findings indicate that JA plays a crucial role in the WRKY30-mediated defense responses to fungal pathogens, and that the rice WRKY30 seems promising as an important candidate gene to improve disease resistance in rice.
MPMI-19-1127.pdf	Inducible overexpression of a rice allene oxide synthase gene increases the endogenous jasmonic acid level, PR gene expression, and host resistance to fungal infection	2006	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Department of Plant Pathology and Program in Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville 72071, USA.	Many studies in dicotyledonous plants have shown that jasmonates, including jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate, are important signal molecules involved in induced resistance to pathogen infection and insect herbivory. However, very little genetic and molecular evidence is available to demonstrate their role in host defense response of rice and other economically important monocot plants. In this study, we have shown that exogenous application of JA was able to activate defense gene expression and local induced resistance in rice seedlings against the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea). Furthermore, we have characterized a pathogen-inducible rice OsAOS2 gene (which encodes allene oxide synthase, a key enzyme in the JA biosynthetic pathway) and examined the role of endogenous JA in rice defense response through transgenic manipulation of the JA biosynthesis. Sequence analysis indicated that OsAOS2 contains four common domains of the cytochrome P450 enzyme, but does not have the signal peptide for chloroplast targeting. The basal level of OsAOS2 expression is very low in leaves but relatively high in the sheath, culm, and flower of rice plants. Interestingly, the expression of OsAOS2 in rice leaves can be induced significantly upon M. grisea infection. Transgenic rice lines carrying the OsAOS2 transgene under the control of a strong, pathogen-inducible PBZ1 promoter accumulated abundant OsAOS2 transcripts and higher levels of JA, especially after the pathogen infection. These transgenic lines also exhibited enhanced activation of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes such as PR1a, PR3, and PR5 and increased resistance to M. grisea infection. Our results suggest that JA plays a significant role in PR gene induction and blast resistance in rice plants.
Plant Cell Physiol-2004-Haga-119-28.pdf	Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Botanical Gardens, Research School of Science, Osaka City University, Kisaichi, Katano-shi, Osaka, 576-0004 Japan.	Allene oxide synthase (AOS) is a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA). We identified four AOS gene homologs, named OsAOS1-4, in the database of a japonica rice genome and cloned a full-length cDNA of OsAOS1. The analysis of deduced amino acid sequences indicated that only OsAOS1 has a chloroplast transit peptide among all the identified monocot AOSs including OsAOSs. We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots. The response in OsAOS1 transcripts occurred rapidly and transiently, while the response in OsAOS4 transcripts was slower and more sustainable; the maximal enhancement was greater in OsAOS1 transcripts than in OsAOS4 transcripts. The transcript of OsAOS1 was also up-regulated transiently in response to wounding, as reported for dicot AOSs. No wound-induced enhancement occurred, however, in OsAOS4 transcripts. Our results also indicated that OsAOS1, responding to both light and wounding, is the most highly expressed of all the OsAOSs in seedling shoots. By using phyA mutants of rice, it was demonstrated that the photoregulation of the AOS transcript level is mediated by phytochrome. It is suggested that this transcriptional photoregulation participates in the phytochrome-mediated inhibition of rice coleoptile growth.
NA	Application of jasmonic acid at the stage of visible brown necrotic spots in Magnaporthe oryzae infection as a novel and environment-friendly control strategy for rice blast disease	2021	Protoplasma	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Heilongtan, Northern suburb, Kunming, 650201, Yunnan, People's Republic of China.	Rice blast disease is one of the most common rice diseases worldwide. It is essential to improve disease resistance through environment-friendly methods, while maintaining yield and quality parameters. In this study, jasmonic acid (JA), a plant hormone with anti-fungal activity, was obtained, at both low (100 ¦Ìmol/L) and high (400 ¦Ìmol/L) concentrations in rice leaves, before, during, and after infection, respectively. JA could inhibit germination and appressorium formation of rice blast spores in a dose-dependent manner. A total of 400-¦Ìmol/L JA treatment significantly enhanced cell viability and endogenous JA level in rice leaves. Furthermore, rice leaves inoculated with Magnaporthe oryzae and sprayed with JA 72 h post-inoculation showed the maximum symptom relief and the highest endogenous JA production among all treatment approaches. The expressions of defense-related genes, OsPR10a and OsAOS2, were highly up-regulated in response to JA, whereas OsEDS1 was down-regulated. Hence, we revealed that exogenous JA could activate JA signaling to effectively control the symptoms of rice blast.
NA	Both Allene Oxide Synthases Genes Are Involved in the Biosynthesis of Herbivore-Induced Jasmonic Acid and Herbivore Resistance in Rice	2021	Plants (Basel)	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology & Ministry of Agriculture Key Lab of Molecular Biology of Crop Pathogens and Insects, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Allene oxide synthase (AOS) is the second enzyme in the biosynthesis of the plant defensive hormone jasmonic acid (JA). In rice, there are two AOSs, OsAOS1 and OsAOS2. However, the role of these two AOS genes in herbivore-induced defenses in rice remains unidentified. We cloned the two rice AOS genes and observed that the transcript level of both OsAOS1 and OsAOS2 was enhanced by mechanical wounding, the infestation of the striped stem borer (SSB) (Chilo suppressalis) or brown planthopper (BPH) (Niaparvata lugens), and treatment with JA; however, OsAOS1 responded more rapidly to SSB infestation and JA treatment than did OsAOS2. The antisense expression of OsAOS1 (as-aos1) or OsAOS2 (as-aos2) decreased levels of SSB- or BPH-induced JA, which, in turn, reduced the production of SSB-induced trypsin protease inhibitor (TrypPI) and volatiles as well as the resistance of rice to SSB. In contrast, BPH preferred to feed and oviposit on wild-type (WT) plants over as-aos1 and as-aos2 plants. Moreover, the survival of BPH nymphs on as-aos1 or as-aos2 lines was significantly lower than on WT plants. The increased resistance of as-aos1 or as-aos2 plants to BPH correlated with higher levels of BPH-induced H2O2 and SA. These results indicate that OsAOS1 and OsAOS2 are both involved in herbivore-induced JA biosynthesis and play a vital role in determining the resistance of rice to chewing and phloem-feeding herbivores.
