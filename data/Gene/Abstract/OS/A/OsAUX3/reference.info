NA	The auxin influx carrier, OsAUX3, regulates rice root development and responses to aluminium stress.	2018	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	In rice, there are five members of the auxin carrier AUXIN1/LIKE AUX1 (AUX1/LAX) family, however, the biological functions of the other four members besides OsAUX1 remains unknown. Here, by using Crispr/cas9 we constructed two independent OsAUX3 knock-down lines, osaux3-1 and osaux3-2, in wild-type rice, Hwayoung (WT/HY) and Dongjin (WT/DJ). osaux3-1 and osaux3-2 have shorter primary roots (PR), decreased lateral root (LR) density and longer root hairs (RH) compared to their WT. OsAUX3 expression in PRs, LRs and RHs further supports that OsAUX3 plays a critical role in the regulation of root development. OsAUX3 locates at the plasma membrane and functions as an auxin influx carrier affecting acropetal auxin transport. OsAUX3 is upregulated in the root apex under aluminium (Al) stress and osaux3-2 is insensitive to Al treatments. Furthermore, NAA accented the sensitivity of WT/DJ and osaux3-2 to respond to Al stress. Auxin concentrations, Al contents and Al-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage in osaux3-2 under Al stress are lower than in WT, indicating that OsAUX3 is involved in Al-induced inhibition of root growth. This study uncovers a novel pathway alleviating Al-induced oxidative damage by inhibition of acropetal auxin transport, and provides a new option for engineering Al-tolerance rice species.
NA	A Novel miR167a-OsARF6-OsAUX3 Module Regulates Grain Length and Weight in Rice	2021	Mol Plant	Key Laboratory of Herbage & Endemic Crop Biotechnology, Ministry of Education, Inner Mongolia Key Laboratory of Herbage & Endemic Crop Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Huhehaote 010000, China; State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Grain size is one of the most import factors of controlling rice yield, as it is associated with grain weight (GW). To date, several rice genes that regulate grain size have been isolated; however, the regulatory mechanism underlying GW control is not fully understood. Herein, a quantitative trait locus qGL5 for grain length (GL) and GW was identified in recombinant inbred lines of 9311 and Nipponbare (NPB), and fine mapped to a candidate gene, OsAUX3. Sequence variations between 9311 and NPB in the OsAUX3 promoter, and loss-of-function of OsAUX3 led to increased GL and GW. RNA-sequencing, gene expression quantification, dual-luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and yeast one-hybrid assay demonstrated that OsARF6 is an upstream transcription factor of OsAUX3. OsARF6 directly binds to the auxin response elements of the OsAUX3 promoter, covering a single nucleotide polymorphism site between 9311 and NPB/Dongjin/Hwayoung, thereby controlling GL by altering longitudinal expansion and auxin distribution/content in glume cells. miR167a was also confirmed to positively regulate GL and GW by directing OsARF6 mRNA silencing. Therefore, the miR167a-OsARF6-OsAUX3 module regulates GL and GW in rice, representing a potential target for improving rice yield.
