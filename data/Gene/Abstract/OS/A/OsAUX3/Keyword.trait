OsAUX3	root	The auxin influx carrier, OsAUX3, regulates rice root development and responses to aluminium stress.	 OsAUX3 expression in PRs, LRs and RHs further supports that OsAUX3 plays a critical role in the regulation of root development
OsAUX3	root	The auxin influx carrier, OsAUX3, regulates rice root development and responses to aluminium stress.	 OsAUX3 is upregulated in the root apex under aluminium (Al) stress and osaux3-2 is insensitive to Al treatments
OsAUX3	root	The auxin influx carrier, OsAUX3, regulates rice root development and responses to aluminium stress.	 Auxin concentrations, Al contents and Al-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage in osaux3-2 under Al stress are lower than in WT, indicating that OsAUX3 is involved in Al-induced inhibition of root growth
OsAUX3	growth	The auxin influx carrier, OsAUX3, regulates rice root development and responses to aluminium stress.	 Auxin concentrations, Al contents and Al-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage in osaux3-2 under Al stress are lower than in WT, indicating that OsAUX3 is involved in Al-induced inhibition of root growth
