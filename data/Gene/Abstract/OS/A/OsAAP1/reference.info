In most plants, organic nitrogen is primarily transported in the form of amino acids. Here, we show that OsAAP1 (Amino Acid Permease 1) functions as a positive regulator of growth and grain yield in rice. We found that the OsAAP1 gene is highly expressed in rice axillary buds, leaves, and young panicles and that the OsAAP1 protein is localized to both the plasma membrane and the nuclear membrane. Compared with the wild type ZH11, OsAAP1 overexpressing (OE) lines exhibited increased filled grain numbers as a result of enhanced tillering while RNA interference (RNAi) and CRISPR (Osaap1) knockout lines showed the opposite phenotype. In addition, OsAAP1-OE lines had higher concentrations of neutral and acidic amino acids, but lower concentrations of basic amino acids in the straw. An exogenous treatment with neutral amino acids more strongly promoted axillary bud outgrowth in the OE lines than that in the WT, RNAi or Osaap1 lines. Transcriptome analysis of Osaap1 further demonstrated that OsAAP1 may affect the nitrogen transport and metabolism, auxin, cytokinin and strigolactone signaling in regulating rice tillering. Taken together, these results support that increasing neutral amino acid uptake and reallocation via OsAAP1 could improve growth and grain yield in rice.
