Symbol	RNAi
OsAAP1	 Compared with the wild type ZH11, OsAAP1 overexpressing (OE) lines exhibited increased filled grain numbers as a result of enhanced tillering while RNA interference (RNAi) and CRISPR (Osaap1) knockout lines showed the opposite phenotype |  An exogenous treatment with neutral amino acids more strongly promoted axillary bud outgrowth in the OE lines than that in the WT, RNAi or Osaap1 lines
