OsABAR1	seedlings	OsABAR1, a novel GRAM domain-containing protein, confers drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway in rice.	 Furthermore, OsABAR1-OX seedlings were hypersensitive to exogenous ABA, whereas Osabar1 seedlings were hyposensitive
OsABAR1	drought	OsABAR1, a novel GRAM domain-containing protein, confers drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway in rice.	 Moreover, OsABAR1 expression was up-regulated by  drought and salinity stresses
OsABAR1	drought	OsABAR1, a novel GRAM domain-containing protein, confers drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway in rice.	 These results imply that OsABAR1 is a positive regulator of the ABA pathway and confirm that OsABAR1 improves rice drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway
OsABAR1	salinity	OsABAR1, a novel GRAM domain-containing protein, confers drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway in rice.	 Moreover, OsABAR1 expression was up-regulated by  drought and salinity stresses
OsABAR1	salt	OsABAR1, a novel GRAM domain-containing protein, confers drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway in rice.	 These results imply that OsABAR1 is a positive regulator of the ABA pathway and confirm that OsABAR1 improves rice drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway
OsABAR1	tolerance	OsABAR1, a novel GRAM domain-containing protein, confers drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway in rice.	 These results imply that OsABAR1 is a positive regulator of the ABA pathway and confirm that OsABAR1 improves rice drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway
OsABAR1	 ABA 	OsABAR1, a novel GRAM domain-containing protein, confers drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway in rice.	 In turn, OsABAR1 regulated the expression of ABA metabolic genes and responsive genes
OsABAR1	 ABA 	OsABAR1, a novel GRAM domain-containing protein, confers drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway in rice.	 These results imply that OsABAR1 is a positive regulator of the ABA pathway and confirm that OsABAR1 improves rice drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway
OsABAR1	salt tolerance	OsABAR1, a novel GRAM domain-containing protein, confers drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway in rice.	 These results imply that OsABAR1 is a positive regulator of the ABA pathway and confirm that OsABAR1 improves rice drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway
OsABAR1	cytoplasm	OsABAR1, a novel GRAM domain-containing protein, confers drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway in rice.	 The OsABAR1 protein was localized in  the cytoplasm and nucleus
OsABAR1	nucleus	OsABAR1, a novel GRAM domain-containing protein, confers drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway in rice.	 The OsABAR1 protein was localized in  the cytoplasm and nucleus
OsABAR1	salinity stress	OsABAR1, a novel GRAM domain-containing protein, confers drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway in rice.	 Moreover, OsABAR1 expression was up-regulated by  drought and salinity stresses
OsABAR1	abscisic acid	OsABAR1, a novel GRAM domain-containing protein, confers drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway in rice.	 We further analyzed the involvement of OsABAR1 in the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway
OsABAR1	ABA	OsABAR1, a novel GRAM domain-containing protein, confers drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway in rice.	 The OsABAR1 expression level was up-regulated by ABA
OsABAR1	ABA	OsABAR1, a novel GRAM domain-containing protein, confers drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway in rice.	 In turn, OsABAR1 regulated the expression of ABA metabolic genes and responsive genes
OsABAR1	ABA	OsABAR1, a novel GRAM domain-containing protein, confers drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway in rice.	 These results imply that OsABAR1 is a positive regulator of the ABA pathway and confirm that OsABAR1 improves rice drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway
