OsACO2	OsERF109	The ethylene response factor OsERF109 negatively affects ethylene biosynthesis and drought tolerance in rice.	Quantitative real-time PCR analysis also proved the regulation of OsERF109 in the expression of OSACS6, OSACO2, and OsERF3, which have been identified to play important roles in ethylene biosynthesis
OsACO2	OsACS1|OsASC1	Targeted Phytohormone Profiling Identifies Potential Regulators of Spikelet Sterility in Rice under Combined Drought and Heat Stress.	 In AC35027, increased ethylene content was correlated with expression of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 1 (OsASC1) and aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase 2 (OsACO2)
