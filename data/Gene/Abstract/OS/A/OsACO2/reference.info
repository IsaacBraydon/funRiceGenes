OsERF3 is a transcriptional repressor with an ethylene-responsive element-binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif (F/LDLNxxP), which transcriptionally represses the ethylene emission and drought tolerance in rice. However, its molecular mechanism to explore repression function remains unknown. Here, we first revealed that the expression of OsERF3 was induced by drought, salt, ACC and ABA treatment. In addition, it showed a higher expression level in the root and sheath than that in the leaf. Then, we generated transgenic rice overexpressing full-length OsERF3 (OE) and its mutation of EAR motif with the A 680/C substitution (mEAR), respectively. The physiological analyses showed that mEAR lines showed better drought tolerance and more ethylene emission compared with those of OE lines and wild type plants. Consistent with our previous research, the expression of ethylene synthesis genes, including ACO2, ACS2, and ACS6 was down-regulated in OE lines. However, the repression of OsERF3 was eliminated in mEAR lines. Specifically, ACS2 was up-regulated in mEAR lines compared with that in OE lines and WT plants, suggesting that the Leu/Ala substitution within the EAR motif resulted in loss of repression of OsERF3. Thus, our data reveal that the EAR motif is required for OsERF3 to transcriptionally regulate the ethylene synthesis and drought tolerance in rice, providing new insight to the roles of ethylene-response factor proteins in regulating ethylene biosynthesis and stress response.

The role of ethylene (ET) in resistance to infection with blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) in rice (Oryza sativa) is poorly understood. To study it, we quantified ET levels after inoculation, using young rice plants at the four-leaf stage of rice cv Nipponbare (wild type) and its isogenic plant (IL7), which contains the Pi-i resistance gene to blast fungus race 003. Small necrotic lesions by hypersensitive reaction (HR) were formed at 42 to 72 h postinoculation (hpi) in resistant IL7 leaves, and whitish expanding lesions at 96 hpi in susceptible wild-type leaves. Notable was the enhanced ET emission at 48 hpi accompanied by increased 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) levels and highly elevated ACC oxidase (ACO) activity in IL7 leaves, whereas only an enhanced ACC increase at 96 hpi in wild-type leaves. Among six ACC synthase (ACS) and seven ACO genes found in the rice genome, OsACS2 was transiently expressed at 48 hpi in IL7 and at 96 hpi in wild type, and OsACO7 was expressed at 48 hpi in IL7. Treatment with an inhibitor for ACS, aminooxyacetic acid, suppressed enhanced ET emission at 48 hpi in IL7, resulting in expanding lesions instead of HR lesions. Exogenously supplied ACC compromised the aminooxyacetic acid-induced breakdown of resistance in IL7, and treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene and silver thiosulfate, inhibitors of ET action, did not suppress resistance. These findings suggest the importance of ET biosynthesis and, consequently, the coproduct, cyanide, for HR-accompanied resistance to blast fungus in young rice plants and the contribution of induced OsACS2 and OsACO7 gene expression to it.
