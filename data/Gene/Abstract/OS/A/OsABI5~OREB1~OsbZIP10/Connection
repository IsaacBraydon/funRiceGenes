OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	SAPK6|OSRK1	A rice dehydration-inducible SNF1-related protein kinase 2 phosphorylates an abscisic acid responsive element-binding factor and associates with ABA signaling	 A rice family of abscisic acid-responsive element (ABRE) binding factor, OREB1 was phosphorylated in vitro by OSRK1 at multiple sites of different functional domains
OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	SAPK6|OSRK1	A rice dehydration-inducible SNF1-related protein kinase 2 phosphorylates an abscisic acid responsive element-binding factor and associates with ABA signaling	 MALDI-TOF analysis identified a phosphorylation site at Ser44 of OREB1 and mutation of the residue greatly decreased the substrate specificity for OSRK1
OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	SAPK6|OSRK1	A rice dehydration-inducible SNF1-related protein kinase 2 phosphorylates an abscisic acid responsive element-binding factor and associates with ABA signaling	 We further showed that OSRK1 interacts with OREB1 in a yeast two-hybrid system and co-localized to nuclei by transient expression analysis of GFP-fused protein in onion epidermis
OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsbZIP23	Constitutive activation of transcription factor OsbZIP46 improves drought tolerance in rice	 It has high sequence similarity to ABA-responsive element binding factor (ABF/AREB) transcription factors ABI5 and OsbZIP23, two transcriptional activators positively regulating stress tolerance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice, respectively
OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	Rice ABI5-Like1 regulates abscisic acid and auxin responses by affecting the expression of ABRE-containing genes	 Here, we report the functional identification of rice (Oryza sativa) ABI5-Like1 (ABL1), which is a basic region/leucine zipper motif transcription factor
OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	Rice ABI5-Like1 regulates abscisic acid and auxin responses by affecting the expression of ABRE-containing genes	 The ABL1 deficiency mutant, abl1, shows suppressed ABA responses, and ABL1 expression in the Arabidopsis abi5 mutant rescued the ABA sensitivity
Ehd1	OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	A Drought-inducible bZIP Transcription Factor OsABF1 Delays Reproductive Timing in Rice.	 Molecular and genetic analyses demonstrate that a drought regime enhances expression of the OsABF1 gene, which indirectly suppresses expression of the Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) gene that encodes a key activator of rice flowering
