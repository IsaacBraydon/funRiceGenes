1-s2.0-S0006291X07012028-main.pdf	Characterization of alternative splicing products of bZIP transcription factors OsABI5	2007	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	National Centre for Plant Gene Research, Key Laboratory of Molecular and Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, South 1-3, Zhongguancun, Beijing 100080, PR China.	Alternative splicing allows many gene products to alter their biological functions. A bZIP-type transcription factor, OsABI5, undergoes alternative splicing. Two OsABI5 splicing variants were identified, designated OsABI5-1, and OsABI5-2 and their different expression patterns in tissues were analyzed. Despite a completely identical functional domain, OsABI5-2 could specifically bind to G-box element, but OsABI5-1 could not; the transactivation activity of OsABI5-1 was higher than that of OsABI5-2; the interaction strength of OsABI5-2 and OsVP1 was stronger than that of OsABI5-1 and OsVP1; indicating a different function in the regulation of downstream target genes. Complementation tests and ABA (abscisic acid) hypersensitivity of Arabidopsis transgenic lines revealed the redundant function of OsABI5 splicing variants in ABA signaling. The interaction between OsABI5-1 and OsABI5-2 was also confirmed. These results suggest that OsABI5 variants may have overlapping and distinct functions to fine tune gene expression in ABA signaling as transcription factors together with OsVP1.
1-s2.0-S0031942210003857-main.pdf	Phosphorylation-mediated regulation of a rice ABA responsive element binding factor	2011	Phytochemistry	Bio-Crops Development Division, National Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Suwon, Republic of Korea.	OREB1 is a rice ABRE binding factor characterized by the presence of multiple highly-conserved phosphorylation domains (C1, C2, C3, and C4) and two kinase recognition motifs, RXXS/T and S/TXXE/D, within different functional domains. An in vitro kinase assay showed that OREB1 is phosphorylated not only by the SnRK2 kinase, but also by other Ser/Thr protein kinases, such as CaMKII, CKII, and SnRK3. Furthermore, the N-terminal phosphorylation domain C1 was found to be differentially phosphorylated by the SnRK2/SnRK3 kinase and by hyperosmotic/cold stress, suggesting that the C1 domain may function in decoding different signals. The phosphorylation-mediated regulation of OREB1 activity was investigated through mutation of the SnRK2 recognition motif RXXS/T within each phosphorylation module. OREB1 contains a crucial nine-amino acid transactivation domain located near the phosphorylation module C1. Deletion of the C1 domain increased OREB1 activity, whereas mutation of Ser 44, Ser 45, and Ser 48 of the C1 domain to aspartates decreased OREB1 activity. In the C2 domain, a double mutation of Ser 118 and Ser 120 to alanines suppressed OREB1 activity. These findings strongly suggest that selective phosphorylation of the C1 or C2 modules may positively or negatively regulate OREB1 transactivation. In addition, mutation of Ser 385 of the C4 domain to alanines completely abolished the interaction between OREB1 and a rice 14-3-3 protein, GF14d, suggesting that SnRK2-mediated phosphorylation may regulate this interaction. These results indicate that phosphorylation domains of OREB1 are not functionally redundant and regulate at least three different functions, including transactivation activity, DNA binding, and protein interactions. The multisite phosphorylation of OREB1 is likely a key for the fine control of its activity and signal integration in the complex stress signaling network of plant cells.
10.1007-s00425-013-1853-9.pdf	Phosphorylation of D-allose by hexokinase involved in regulation of OsABF1 expression for growth inhibition in Oryza sativa L	2013	Planta	Faculty of Agriculture, Rare Sugar Research Center, and Gene Research Center, Kagawa University, Miki, Kagawa, 761-0795, Japan.	We previously reported that a rare sugar D-allose, which is the D-glucose epimer at C3, inhibits the gibberellin-dependent responses such as elongation of the second leaf sheath and induction of alpha-amylase in embryo-less half seeds in rice (Fukumoto et al. 2011). D-Allose suppresses expressions of gibberellin-responsive genes downstream of SLR1 protein in the gibberellin-signaling through hexokinase (HXK)-dependent pathway. In this study, we discovered that D-allose induced expression of ABA-related genes including OsNCED1-3 and OsABA8ox1-3 in rice. Interestingly, D-allose also up-regulated expression of OsABF1, encoding a conserved bZIP transcription factor in ABA signaling, in rice. The D-allose-induced expression of OsABF1 was diminished by a hexokinase inhibitor, D-mannoheptulose (MNH). Consistently, D-allose also inhibited Arabidopsis growth, but failed to trigger growth retardation in the glucose-insensitive2 (gin2) mutant, which is a loss-of-function mutant of the glucose sensor AtHXK1. D-Allose activated AtABI5 expression in transgenic gin2 over-expressing wild-type AtHXK1 but not in gin2 over-expressing the catalytic mutant AtHXK1(S177A), indicating that the D-allose phosphorylation by HXK to D-allose 6-phosphate (A6P) is the first step for the up-regulation of AtABI5 gene expression as well as D-allose-induced growth inhibition. Moreover, overexpression of OsABF1 showed increased sensitivity to D-allose in rice. These findings indicated that the phosphorylation of D-allose at C6 by hexokinase is essential and OsABF1 is involved in the signal transduction for D-allose-induced growth inhibition.
10.1007-s11103-006-9079-x.pdf	A rice dehydration-inducible SNF1-related protein kinase 2 phosphorylates an abscisic acid responsive element-binding factor and associates with ABA signaling	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Cell and Genetics Division, National Institute of Agricultural Biotechnology, Suwon, 441-707, Republic of Korea.	By a differential cDNA screening technique, we have isolated a dehydration-inducible gene (designated OSRK1) that encodes a 41.8 kD protein kinase of SnRK2 family from Oryza sativa. The OSRK1 transcript level was undetectable in vegetative tissues, but significantly increased by hyperosmotic stress and Abscisic acid (ABA). To determine its biochemical properties, we expressed and isolated OSRK1 and its mutants as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. In vitro kinase assay showed that OSRK1 can phosphorylate itself and generic substrates as well. Interestingly, OSRK1 showed strong substrate preference for rice bZIP transcription factors and uncommon cofactor requirement for Mn(2+) over Mg(2+). By deletion of C-terminus 73 amino acids or mutations of Ser-158 and Thr-159 to aspartic acids (Asp) in the activation loop, the activity of OSRK1 was dramatically decreased. OSRK1 can transphosphorylate the inactive deletion protein. A rice family of abscisic acid-responsive element (ABRE) binding factor, OREB1 was phosphorylated in vitro by OSRK1 at multiple sites of different functional domains. MALDI-TOF analysis identified a phosphorylation site at Ser44 of OREB1 and mutation of the residue greatly decreased the substrate specificity for OSRK1. The recognition motif for OSRK1, RQSS is highly similar to the consensus substrate sequence of AMPK/SNF1 kinase family. We further showed that OSRK1 interacts with OREB1 in a yeast two-hybrid system and co-localized to nuclei by transient expression analysis of GFP-fused protein in onion epidermis. Finally, ectopic expression of OSRK1 in transgenic tobacco resulted in a reduced sensitivity to ABA in seed germination and root elongation. These findings suggest that OSRK1 is associated with ABA signaling, possibly through the phosphorylation of ABF family in vivo. The interaction between SnRK2 family kinases and ABF transcription factors may constitute an important part of cross-talk mechanism in the stress signaling networks in plants.
10.1007-s11103-009-9592-9.pdf	The bZIP transcription factor OsABF1 is an ABA responsive element binding factor that enhances abiotic stress signaling in rice	2010	Plant Mol Biol	Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, The University of Suwon, Hwasung 445-743, Korea.	A number of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors are known to function in stress signaling in plants but few have thus far been functionally characterized in rice. In our current study in rice, we have newly isolated and characterized the OsABF1 (Oryza sativa ABA responsive element binding factor 1) gene that encodes a bZIP transcription factor. Its expression in seedling shoots and roots was found to be induced by various abiotic stress treatments such as anoxia, salinity, drought, oxidative stress, cold and abscisic acid (ABA). Subcellular localization analysis in maize protoplasts using GFP fusion vectors indicated that OsABF1 is a nuclear protein. In a yeast experiment, OsABF1 was shown to bind to ABA responsive elements (ABREs) and its N-terminal region was necessary to transactivate the downstream reporter gene. The homozygous T-DNA insertional mutants Osabf1-1 and Osabf1-2 were more sensitive in response to drought and salinity treatments than wild type plants. Furthermore, the upregulated expression of some ABA/stress-regulated genes in response to ABA treatment was suppressed in these Osabf1 mutants. Our current results thus suggest that OsABF1 is involved in abiotic stress responses and ABA signaling in rice.
10.1007-s11741-009-0216-3.pdf	Genome-wide analysis of basic leucine zipper transcription factor families in Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Populus trichocarpa	2009	Journal of Shanghai University (English Edition)	School of Life Sciences, Shanghai University, Shanghai, 200444, P. R. China	The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors form a large gene family that is important in pathogen defense, light and stress signaling, etc. The Completed whole genome sequences of model plants Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa) constitute a valuable resource for genome-wide analysis and genomic comparative analysis, as they are representatives of the two major evolutionary lineages within the angiosperms: the monocotyledons and the dicotyledons. In this study, bioinformatics analysis identified 74, 89 and 88 bZIP genes respectively in Arabidopsis, rice and poplar. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of this gene family is presented, including the gene structure, phylogeny, chromosome distribution, conserved motifs. As a result, the plant bZIPs were organized into 10 subfamilies on basis of phylogenetic relationship. Gene duplication events during the family evolution history were also investigated. And it was further concluded that chromosomal/segmental duplication might have played a key role in gene expansion of bZIP gene family.
1755.pdf	Constitutive activation of transcription factor OsbZIP46 improves drought tolerance in rice	2012	Plant Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	OsbZIP46 is one member of the third subfamily of bZIP transcription factors in rice (Oryza sativa). It has high sequence similarity to ABA-responsive element binding factor (ABF/AREB) transcription factors ABI5 and OsbZIP23, two transcriptional activators positively regulating stress tolerance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice, respectively. Expression of OsbZIP46 was strongly induced by drought, heat, hydrogen peroxide, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment; however, it was not induced by salt and cold stresses. Overexpression of the native OsbZIP46 gene increased ABA sensitivity but had no positive effect on drought resistance. The activation domain of OsbZIP46 was defined by a series of deletions, and a region (domain D) was identified as having a negative effect on the activation. We produced a constitutive active form of OsbZIP46 (OsbZIP46CA1) with a deletion of domain D. Overexpression of OsbZIP46CA1 in rice significantly increased tolerance to drought and osmotic stresses. Gene chip analysis of the two overexpressors (native OsbZIP46 and the constitutive active form OsbZIP46CA1) revealed that a large number of stress-related genes, many of them predicted to be downstream genes of ABF/AREBs, were activated in the OsbZIP46CA1 overexpressor but not (even down-regulated) in the OsbZIP46 overexpressor. OsbZIP46 can interact with homologs of SnRK2 protein kinases that phosphorylate ABFs in Arabidopsis. These results suggest that OsbZIP46 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling and drought stress tolerance of rice depending on its activation. The stress-related genes activated by OsbZIP46CA1 are largely different from those activated by the other rice ABF/AREB homologs (such as OsbZIP23), further implying the value of OsbZIP46CA1 in genetic engineering of drought tolerance.
Plant Physiol.-2011-Yang-pp.111.173427.pdf	Rice ABI5-Like1 regulates abscisic acid and auxin responses by affecting the expression of ABRE-containing genes	2011	Plant Physiol	Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences-University of California, Berkeley, Joint Center on Molecular Life Sciences, National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, People's Republic of China.	Abscisic acid (ABA) regulates plant development and is crucial for plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Studies have identified the key components of ABA signaling in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), some of which regulate ABA responses by the transcriptional regulation of downstream genes. Here, we report the functional identification of rice (Oryza sativa) ABI5-Like1 (ABL1), which is a basic region/leucine zipper motif transcription factor. ABL1 is expressed in various tissues and is induced by the hormones ABA and indole-3-acetic acid and stress conditions including salinity, drought, and osmotic pressure. The ABL1 deficiency mutant, abl1, shows suppressed ABA responses, and ABL1 expression in the Arabidopsis abi5 mutant rescued the ABA sensitivity. The ABL1 protein is localized to the nucleus and can directly bind ABA-responsive elements (ABREs; G-box) in vitro. A gene expression analysis by DNA chip hybridization confirms that a large proportion of down-regulated genes of abl1 are involved in stress responses, consistent with the transcriptional activating effects of ABL1. Further studies indicate that ABL1 regulates the plant stress responses by regulating a series of ABRE-containing WRKY family genes. In addition, the abl1 mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous indole-3-acetic acid, and some ABRE-containing genes related to auxin metabolism or signaling are altered under ABL1 deficiency, suggesting that ABL1 modulates ABA and auxin responses by directly regulating the ABRE-containing genes.
s11103-008-9298-4.pdf	A bZIP transcription factor, OsABI5, is involved in rice fertility and stress tolerance	2008	Plant Mol Biol	Key Laboratory of Molecular and Developmental Biology, National Centre for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, P.O. Box 2707, South 1-3, Zhongguancun, Beijing 100080, P.R. China.	The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is involved in the adaptive stress response and regulates expression of many stress-responsive genes, including some transcriptional factors. A bZIP transcription factor, OsABI5, was isolated from the panicle of Oryza sativa L. Expression of the OsABI5 gene was induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and high salinity, and down-regulated by drought and cold (4 degrees C) in seedlings. The OsABI5 protein was localized in the nucleus and has trans-activation activity. The N-terminal of the protein is necessary for its activity. OsABI5 could bind to a G-box element and trans-activate reporter gene expression. Complementation analysis revealed that the expression of OsABI5 driven by the 35S promoter could rescue ABA-insensitivity of abi5-1 during seed germination and result in hypersensitivity to ABA. Over-expression of OsABI5 in rice conferred high sensitivity to salt stress. Repression of OsABI5 promoted stress tolerance and resulted in low fertility of rice. These results suggested that OsABI5 could regulate the adaptive stress response and plant fertility of rice as a transcription factor.
NA	A Drought-inducible bZIP Transcription Factor OsABF1 Delays Reproductive Timing in Rice.	2016	Plant Physiol	Crop Science Institute, CAAS CITY: Beijing China [CN].	The molecular mechanisms underlying photoperiod or temperature control of flowering time have been recently elucidated, but how plants regulate flowering time in response to other external factors, such as water availability, remains poorly understood. Using a large-scale Hybrid Transcription Factor (HTF) approach, we identified a bZIP transcriptional factor, O. sativa ABA responsive element binding factor 1 (OsABF1) that acts as a suppressor of floral transition in a photoperiod-independent manner. Simultaneous knockdown of both OsABF1 and its closest homologous gene OsbZIP40 in rice by RNA interference results in a significantly earlier flowering phenotype. Molecular and genetic analyses demonstrate that a drought regime enhances expression of the OsABF1 gene, which indirectly suppresses expression of the Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) gene that encodes a key activator of rice flowering. Furthermore, we identified a drought inducible gene named OsWRKY104 that is under the direct regulation of OsABF1. Overexpression of OsWRKY104 can suppress Ehd1 expression and confers a later flowering phenotype in rice. Together, these findings reveal a novel pathway by which rice modulates heading date in response to the change of ambient water availability.
NA	The OsABF1 transcription factor improves drought tolerance by activating the transcription of COR413-TM1 in rice.	2017	J Exp Bot	Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Water deprivation causes substantial losses in crop yields around the world. In this study, we show that when overexpressed in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa), the bZIP transcription factor OsABF1 confers distinctly different drought-tolerance phenotypes when tethered to the transcriptional activator VP16 versus the transcriptional repressor EAR. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) assays on transgenic rice lines and determined that OsABF1 binds to DNA sequences containing an ACGT core motif. Analysis of the overlap between the RNA-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing data identified 242 OsABF1 target genes involved in multiple aspects of the drought response. Overexpression of one of these genes, COR413-TM1, which encodes a putative thylakoid membrane protein, resulted in a drought-tolerance phenotype without obvious side effects. In addition, OsABF1 directly regulates the expression of the protein phosphatase 2C (OsPP48 and OsPP108) and bZIP (OsbZIP23, OsbZIP46, and OsbZIP72) genes, thus forming a complex feedback circuit in the drought/abscisic acid signaling pathway.
NA	Histone deacetylase HDA710 controls salt tolerance by regulating ABA signaling in rice	2020	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agriculture University, Wuhan, 430030, China.	Plants have evolved numerous mechanisms that assist them in withstanding environmental stresses. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play crucial roles in plant stress responses; however, their regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we explored the function of HDA710/OsHDAC2, a member of the HDAC RPD3/HDA1 family, in stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa). We established that HDA710 localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm and is involved in regulating the acetylation of histone H3 and H4, specifically targeting H4K5 and H4K16 under normal conditions. HDA710 transcript accumulation levels were strongly induced by abiotic stresses including drought and salinity, as well as by the phytohormones jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA). hda710 knockout mutant plants showed enhanced salinity tolerance and reduced ABA sensitivity, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing HDA710 displayed the opposite phenotypes. Moreover, ABA- and salt-stress-responsive genes, such as OsLEA3, OsABI5, OsbZIP72, and OsNHX1, were upregulated in hda710 compared with wild-type plants. These expression differences corresponded with higher levels of histone H4 acetylation in gene promoter regions in hda710 compared with the wild type under ABA and salt-stress treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that HDA710 is involved in regulating ABA- and salt-stress-responsive genes by altering H4 acetylation levels in their promoters.

NA	Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant. In addition to serving as a model plant for molecular genetic studies of monocots, rice is a staple crop for about half of the world population. Heading date is a critical agronomic trait, and many genes controlling heading date have been cloned during the last two decades. The mechanism of flowering in rice from recognition of day length by leaves to floral activation in the shoot apical meristem has been extensively studied. In this review, we summarize current progress on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice with emphasis on post-translational modifications of key regulators, including Heading Date 1 (Hd1), Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Grain Number, Plant Height, and Heading Date7 (Ghd7). The contribution of heading date genes to heterosis and the expansion of rice cultivation areas from low-latitude to high-latitude regions are also discussed. To overcome limitations of diverse genetic backgrounds used in heading date studies and to gain a clearer understanding of flowering in rice, we propose a systematic collection of genetic resources in a common genetic background. Strategies in breeding adapted cultivars by rational design are also discussed.
