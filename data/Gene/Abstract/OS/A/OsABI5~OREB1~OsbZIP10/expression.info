OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	 Molecular and genetic analyses demonstrate that a drought regime enhances expression of the OsABF1 gene, which indirectly suppresses expression of the Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) gene that encodes a key activator of rice flowering
OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	 In addition, OsABF1 directly regulates the expression of the protein phosphatase 2C (OsPP48 and OsPP108) and bZIP (OsbZIP23, OsbZIP46, and OsbZIP72) genes, thus forming a complex feedback circuit in the drought/abscisic acid signaling pathway
OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	 In addition, the induction of OsPRR95 by ABA partly required a functional OsRCAR10, and the ABA responsive element (ABRE)-binding factor ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE5 (OsABI5) bound directly to the promoter of OsPRR95 and activated its expression, thus establishing a regulatory feedback loop between OsPRR95, OsRCAR10 and OsABI5
