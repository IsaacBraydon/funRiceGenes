OsA2	OSA7|osAHA7|AHA7|LMPA	Isoforms of plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase in rice root and shoot are differentially induced by starvation and resupply of NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª or NH‚Ç<U+383C><U+3E34>+.	 Resupply of NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª resulted in induction of the following PM H+-ATPase isoforms, OsA1, OsA2, OsA5 and OsA7 in the shoots and OsA2, OsA5, OsA7 and OsA8 in the roots
OsA2	OSA7|osAHA7|AHA7|LMPA	Isoforms of plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase in rice root and shoot are differentially induced by starvation and resupply of NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª or NH‚Ç<U+383C><U+3E34>+.	 PM H+-ATPase isoforms OsA2 and OsA7 displayed the strongest induction in response to N resupply, therefore indicating that these genes could be involved in N uptake in rice
