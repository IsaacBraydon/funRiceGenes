OsAUX5	OsWRKY78	Natural variations of OsAUX5, a target gene of OsWRKY78, control the neutral essential amino acid content in rice grains.	Natural variations of OsAUX5, a target gene of OsWRKY78, control the neutral essential amino acid content in rice grains.
OsAUX5	OsWRKY78	Natural variations of OsAUX5, a target gene of OsWRKY78, control the neutral essential amino acid content in rice grains.	 Natural variations of OsAUX5 occur in the cis elements of its promoter, which are differentially activated because of the different binding affinity between OsWRKY78 and the W-box, contributing to grain EAA variation among rice varieties
