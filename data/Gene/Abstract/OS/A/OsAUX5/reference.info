Grain essential amino acid (EAA) levels contribute to rice nutritional quality. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying EAA accumulation and natural variation in rice grains remain unclear. Here we report the identification of a previously unrecognized auxin influx carrier subfamily gene, OsAUX5, which encodes an amino acid transporter that functions in uptake of multiple amino acids. We identified an elite haplotype of Pro::OsAUX5(Hap2) that enhances grain EAA accumulation without an apparent negative effect on agronomic traits. Natural variations of OsAUX5 occur in the cis elements of its promoter, which are differentially activated because of the different binding affinity between OsWRKY78 and the W-box, contributing to grain EAA variation among rice varieties. The two distinct haplotypes were shown to have originated from different Oryza rufipogon progenitors, which contributed to the divergence between japonica and indica. Introduction of the indica-type Pro::OsAUX5(Hap2) genotype into japonica could significantly increase EAA levels, indicating that indica-type Pro::OsAUX5(Hap2) can be utilized to increase grain EAAs of japonica varieties. Collectively, our study uncovers an WRKY78-OsAUX5-based regulatory mechanism controlling grain EAA accumulation and provides a potential target for breeding EAA-rich rice.
