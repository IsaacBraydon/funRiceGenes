NA	Osa-miR162a fine-tunes rice resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae and Yield.	2020	Rice	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae, the causative agent of rice blast disease. Here we demonstrate that Osa-miR162a fine-tunes rice immunity against M. oryzae and yield traits. Overexpression of Osa-miR162a enhances rice resistance to M. oryzae accompanying enhanced induction of defense-related genes and accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In contrast, blocking Osa-miR162 by overexpressing a target mimic of Osa-miR162a enhances susceptibility to blast fungus associating with compromised induction of defense-related gene expression and H2O2 accumulation. Moreover, the transgenic lines overexpressing Osa-miR162a display decreased seed setting rate resulting in slight reduced yield per plant, whereas the transgenic lines blocking Osa-miR162 show an increased number of grains per panicle, resulting in increased yield per plant. Altered accumulation of Osa-miR162 had a limited impact on the expression of rice Dicer-like 1 (OsDCL1) in these transgenic lines showing normal gross morphology, and silencing of OsDCL1 led to enhanced resistance to blast fungus similar to that caused by overexpression of Osa-miR162a, suggesting the involvement of OsDCL1 in Osa-miR162a-regulated resistance. Together, our results indicate that Osa-miR162a is involved in rice immunity against M. oryzae and fine-tunes resistance and yield.
