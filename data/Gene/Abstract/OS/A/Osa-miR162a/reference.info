NA	Osa-miR162a fine-tunes rice resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae and Yield.	2020	Rice	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae, the causative agent of rice blast disease. Here we demonstrate that Osa-miR162a fine-tunes rice immunity against M. oryzae and yield traits. Overexpression of Osa-miR162a enhances rice resistance to M. oryzae accompanying enhanced induction of defense-related genes and accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In contrast, blocking Osa-miR162 by overexpressing a target mimic of Osa-miR162a enhances susceptibility to blast fungus associating with compromised induction of defense-related gene expression and H2O2 accumulation. Moreover, the transgenic lines overexpressing Osa-miR162a display decreased seed setting rate resulting in slight reduced yield per plant, whereas the transgenic lines blocking Osa-miR162 show an increased number of grains per panicle, resulting in increased yield per plant. Altered accumulation of Osa-miR162 had a limited impact on the expression of rice Dicer-like 1 (OsDCL1) in these transgenic lines showing normal gross morphology, and silencing of OsDCL1 led to enhanced resistance to blast fungus similar to that caused by overexpression of Osa-miR162a, suggesting the involvement of OsDCL1 in Osa-miR162a-regulated resistance. Together, our results indicate that Osa-miR162a is involved in rice immunity against M. oryzae and fine-tunes resistance and yield.
NA	Overexpression of an Osa-miR162a Derivative in Rice Confers Cross-Kingdom RNA Interference-Mediated Brown Planthopper Resistance without Perturbing Host Development.	2021	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China.	Rice is a main food crop for more than half of the global population. The brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) is one of the most destructive insect pests of rice. Currently, repeated overuse of chemical insecticides represents a common practice in agriculture for BPH control, which can induce insect tolerance and provoke environmental concerns. This situation calls for innovative and widely applicable strategies for rice protection against BPH. Here we report that the rice osa-miR162a can mediate cross-kingdom RNA interference (RNAi) by targeting the NlTOR (Target of rapamycin) gene of BPH that regulates the reproduction process. Through artificial diet or injection, osa-miR162a mimics repressed the NlTOR expression and impaired the oviposition of BPH adults. Consistently, overproduced osa-miR162a in transgenic rice plants compromised the fecundity of BPH adults fed with these plants, but meanwhile perturbed root and grain development. To circumvent this issue, we generated osa-miR162a-m1, a sequence-optimized osa-miR162a, by decreasing base complementarity to rice endogenous target genes while increasing base complementarity to NlTOR. Transgenic overexpression of osa-miR162a-m1 conferred rice resistance to BPH without detectable developmental penalty. This work reveals the first cross-kingdom RNAi mechanism in rice-BPH interactions and inspires a potentially useful approach for improving rice resistance to BPH. We also introduce an effective strategy to uncouple unwanted host developmental perturbation from desirable cross-kingdom RNAi benefits for overexpressed plant miRNAs.
