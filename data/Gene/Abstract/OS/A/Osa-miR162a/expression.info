Osa-miR162a	 Overexpression of Osa-miR162a enhances rice resistance to M |  In contrast, blocking Osa-miR162 by overexpressing a target mimic of Osa-miR162a enhances susceptibility to blast fungus associating with compromised induction of defense-related gene expression and H2O2 accumulation |  Altered accumulation of Osa-miR162 had a limited impact on the expression of rice Dicer-like 1 (OsDCL1) in these transgenic lines showing normal gross morphology, and silencing of OsDCL1 led to enhanced resistance to blast fungus similar to that caused by overexpression of Osa-miR162a, suggesting the involvement of OsDCL1 in Osa-miR162a-regulated resistance	 Overexpression of Osa-miR162a enhances rice resistance to M |  Altered accumulation of Osa-miR162 had a limited impact on the expression of rice Dicer-like 1 (OsDCL1) in these transgenic lines showing normal gross morphology, and silencing of OsDCL1 led to enhanced resistance to blast fungus similar to that caused by overexpression of Osa-miR162a, suggesting the involvement of OsDCL1 in Osa-miR162a-regulated resistance
