EAT1-rice.pdf	EAT1 promotes tapetal cell death by regulating aspartic proteases during male reproductive development in rice	2013	Nat Commun	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.	Programmed cell death is essential for the development of multicellular organisms, yet pathways of plant programmed cell death and its regulation remain elusive. Here we report that ETERNAL TAPETUM 1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor conserved in land plants, positively regulates programmed cell death in tapetal cells in rice anthers. eat1 exhibits delayed tapetal cell death and aborted pollen formation. ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 directly regulates the expression of OsAP25 and OsAP37, which encode aspartic proteases that induce programmed cell death in both yeast and plants. Expression and genetic analyses revealed that ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 acts downstream of TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION, another positive regulator of tapetal programmed cell death, and that ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 can also interact with the TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION protein. This study demonstrates that ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 promotes aspartic proteases triggering plant programmed cell death, and reveals a dynamic regulatory cascade in male reproductive development in rice.
NA	OsNAC2 positively affects salt-induced cell death and binds to the OsAP37 and OsCOX11 promoters.	2018	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Genetics, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, China.	Plant development and adaptations to environmental stresses are intimately associated with programmed cell death (PCD). Although some of the mechanisms regulating PCD [e.g., accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)] are common among responses to different abiotic stresses, the pathways mediating salt-induced PCD remain largely uncharacterized. We herein report that overexpressing OsNAC2, which encodes a plant-specific transcription factor, promotes salt-induced cell death accompanied by the loss of plasma membrane integrity, nuclear DNA fragmentation, and changes to caspase-like activity. In OsNAC2-knockdown lines, cell death was markedly decreased in response to severe salt stress. Additionally, OsNAC2 expression was enhanced in rice seedlings exposed to a high NaCl concentration. Moreover, the results of quantitative real-time PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase, and yeast one-hybrid assays indicated that OsNAC2 targeted genes encoding an ROS scavenger (OsCOX11) and a caspase-like protease (OsAP37). Furthermore, K+-efflux channels (OsGORK and OsSKOR) were obviously activated by OsNAC2. Overall, our results suggest that OsNAC2 accelerates NaCl-induced PCD and provide new insights into the mechanisms affecting ROS accumulation, plant caspase-like activity, and K+efflux.
