OsAP37	cell death	EAT1 promotes tapetal cell death by regulating aspartic proteases during male reproductive development in rice	ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 directly regulates the expression of OsAP25 and OsAP37, which encode aspartic proteases that induce programmed cell death in both yeast and plants
OsAP37	tapetum	EAT1 promotes tapetal cell death by regulating aspartic proteases during male reproductive development in rice	ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 directly regulates the expression of OsAP25 and OsAP37, which encode aspartic proteases that induce programmed cell death in both yeast and plants
OsAP37	cell death	OsNAC2 positively affects salt-induced cell death and binds to the OsAP37 and OsCOX11 promoters.	OsNAC2 positively affects salt-induced cell death and binds to the OsAP37 and OsCOX11 promoters.
OsAP37	PCD	Variations in OsSPL10 confer drought tolerance by directly regulating OsNAC2 expression and ROS production in rice.	 Importantly, we demonstrated that the varieties with the OsSPL10 (Hap1) allele show low expression levels of OsSPL10 and its downstream gene, OsNAC2, which decreases the expression of OsAP37 and increases the expression of OsCOX11, thus preventing ROS accumulation and PCD
