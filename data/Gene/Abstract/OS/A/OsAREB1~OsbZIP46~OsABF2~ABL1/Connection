OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	OsbZIP23	Constitutive activation of transcription factor OsbZIP46 improves drought tolerance in rice	 The stress-related genes activated by OsbZIP46CA1 are largely different from those activated by the other rice ABF/AREB homologs (such as OsbZIP23), further implying the value of OsbZIP46CA1 in genetic engineering of drought tolerance
OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	OsDIL|OsLTP6	The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages	 The expression levels of the drought-responsive genes RD22, SODA1, bZIP46 and POD, as well as the ABA synthetic gene ZEP1 were up-regulated in the OsDIL-overexpression lines but the ABA degradation gene ABAOX3 was down-regulated
OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	ZEP1	The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages	 The expression levels of the drought-responsive genes RD22, SODA1, bZIP46 and POD, as well as the ABA synthetic gene ZEP1 were up-regulated in the OsDIL-overexpression lines but the ABA degradation gene ABAOX3 was down-regulated
OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	OsSIPP2C1|OsPP2C68	A novel nuclear protein phosphatase 2C negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice	 OsSIPP2C1 expression was up-regulated by high salt, PEG6000 and exogenous ABA, and enhanced in the abl1 mutant under normal, salt, or drought condition| Together, it is suggested that a nuclear PP2C protein OsSIPP2C1 negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice
OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	Rice ABI5-Like1 regulates abscisic acid and auxin responses by affecting the expression of ABRE-containing genes	 Here, we report the functional identification of rice (Oryza sativa) ABI5-Like1 (ABL1), which is a basic region/leucine zipper motif transcription factor| The ABL1 deficiency mutant, abl1, shows suppressed ABA responses, and ABL1 expression in the Arabidopsis abi5 mutant rescued the ABA sensitivity
OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	OsPM19L1	Characterization of OsPM19L1 encoding an AWPM-19-like family protein that is dramatically induced by osmotic stress in rice.	 Moreover, under stress conditions, OsPM19L1 expression was enhanced in an ABI5-Like1 (ABL1) deficiency rice mutant, abl1, suggesting that ABL1 negatively regulates OsPM19L1 gene expression
