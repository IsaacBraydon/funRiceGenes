OsABCC7	xylem	The C-type ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter OsABCC7 Is Involved in the Root-to-Shoot Translocation of Arsenic in Rice.	 Transgenic rice plants expressing OsABCC7 Promoter-GUS (¦Â-glucuronidase) suggest that the gene was predominantly expressed in the xylem parenchyma cells in the stele region of the primary and lateral roots
OsABCC7	xylem	The C-type ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter OsABCC7 Is Involved in the Root-to-Shoot Translocation of Arsenic in Rice.	 Knockout of OsABCC7 in rice significantly decreased As concentration in the xylem sap and As concentration in the shoots, but had little effect on root As concentration
OsABCC7	root	The C-type ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter OsABCC7 Is Involved in the Root-to-Shoot Translocation of Arsenic in Rice.	 Knockout of OsABCC7 in rice significantly decreased As concentration in the xylem sap and As concentration in the shoots, but had little effect on root As concentration
OsABCC7	transporter	The C-type ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter OsABCC7 Is Involved in the Root-to-Shoot Translocation of Arsenic in Rice.	The C-type ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter OsABCC7 Is Involved in the Root-to-Shoot Translocation of Arsenic in Rice.
OsABCC7	lateral root	The C-type ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter OsABCC7 Is Involved in the Root-to-Shoot Translocation of Arsenic in Rice.	 Transgenic rice plants expressing OsABCC7 Promoter-GUS (¦Â-glucuronidase) suggest that the gene was predominantly expressed in the xylem parenchyma cells in the stele region of the primary and lateral roots
