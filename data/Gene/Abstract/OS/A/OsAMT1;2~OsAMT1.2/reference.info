In order to investigate the molecular basis of high-affinity ammonium absorption by roots of rice plants (Oryza sativa subspecies indica) the expression patterns of three members of the AMT1 family of genes in rice seedling roots in response to altered nitrogen provision and diurnal changes in irradiance were examined. The 13NH4+ influx and transcript levels of OsAMT1.1 in roots decreased several fold within 48 h when plants acclimated to 10 micro m external NH4+ for 3 weeks were transferred to 10 mm NH4+. Likewise when plants acclimated in 10 mm NH4+ were transferred to 10 micro m NH4+, there was an equally rapid up-regulation of OsAMT1.1 and 13NH4+ influx in the roots. Changes in transcript abundance of OsAMT1.2 following these treatments were approximately 50% less than in OsAMT1.1, and changes of OsAMT1.3 expression were even less. By contrast, in response to the diurnal changes of irradiance, root transcript abundance of OsAMT1.3 and 15NH4+ influx increased approximately three-fold late in the photoperiod, whereas OsAMT1.1 and OsAMT1.2 exhibited only modest changes. The present results suggest that high-affinity NH4+ influx is differentially regulated at the transcriptional level through the expression of three members of the OsAMT1 family of genes in roots of rice seedlings in response to changes of N status and daily irradiance. In general, these findings are in agreement with earlier observations in Arabidopsis and tomato.
nph12075.pdf	Indeterminate domain 10 regulates ammonium-mediated gene expression in rice roots	2013	New Phytol	Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 Program), Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Research Center, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 660-701, South Korea.	Indeterminate domain (IDD) genes are a family of plant transcriptional regulators that function in the control of development and metabolism during growth. Here, the function of Oryza sativa indeterminate domain 10 (OsIDD10) has been explored in rice plants. Compared with wild-type roots, idd10 mutant roots are hypersensitive to exogenous ammonium. This work aims to define the action of IDD10 on gene expression involved in ammonium uptake and nitrogen (N) metabolism. The ammonium induction of key ammonium uptake and assimilation genes was examined in the roots of idd10 mutants and IDD10 overexpressors. Molecular studies and transcriptome analysis were performed to identify target genes and IDD10 binding cis-elements. IDD10 activates the transcription of AMT1;2 and GDH2 by binding to a cis-element motif present in the promoter region of AMT1;2 and in the fifth intron of GDH2. IDD10 contributes significantly to the induction of several genes involved in N-linked metabolic and cellular responses, including genes encoding glutamine synthetase 2, nitrite reductases and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase. Furthermore, the possibility that IDD10 might influence the N-mediated feedback regulation of target genes was examined. This study demonstrates that IDD10 is involved in regulatory circuits that determine N-mediated gene expression in plant roots.

The three members of the rice OsAMT1 gene family of ammonium transporters show distinct expression patterns; constitutive and ammonium-promoted expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1; root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2; root-specific and nitrogen-repressible expression for OsAMT1;3 [Sonoda et al. (2003), Plant Cell Physiol. 44: 726]. To clarify the feedback mechanisms, and to identify regulatory factors of the OsAMT1 genes, the accumulation of the three mRNAs and its dependence on endogenous nitrogen compounds (as quantified by capillary electrophoresis) was studied. Ammonium application to roots following a period of nitrogen starvation induced accumulation of OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2 mRNA, but a decrease of OsAMT1;3 mRNA levels. The expression patterns of the three genes showed good correlation (positive in OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2, negative in OsAMT1;3) with the root tissue contents of glutamine but not of ammonium. The ammonium effects on OsAMT1 expression were prevented by methionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase. Moreover, glutamine had the same effect on transcriptional regulation of OsAMT1 genes as ammonium, indicating that glutamine rather than ammonium controls the expression of ammonium transporter genes in rice. These results imply that rice possesses unique mechanisms of adaptation to variable nitrogen sources in the soil.
Plant Cell Physiol-2003-Sonoda-726-34.pdf	Distinct expression and function of three ammonium transporter genes (OsAMT1;1-1;3) in rice	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	Division of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, Hokkaido University, Kita-ku N10-W8, Sapporo, 060-0810 Japan.	To study the regulation of ammonium uptake into rice roots, three ammonium transporter genes (OsAMT1;1, 1;2 and 1;3; Oryza sativa ammonium transporter) were isolated and examined. OsAMT1s belong to AMT1 family, containing 11 putative transmembrane-spanning domains. Southern blot analysis and screening of the rice genome database confirmed that with OsAMT1;1-1;3 the complete AMT1 family of rice had been isolated. Heterologous expression of OsAMT1s in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant 31019b showed that all three OsAMT1s exhibit ammonium transport activity. Northern blot analysis showed a distinct expression pattern for the three genes; more constitutive expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1, root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2, and root-specific and nitrogen-derepressible expression for OsAMT1;3. In situ mRNA detection revealed that OsAMT1;2 is expressed in the central cylinder and cell surface of root tips. This gene expression analysis revealed a distinct nitrogen-dependent regulation for AMTs in rice, differing from that in tomato or Arabidopsis:
NA	Three polarly localized ammonium transporter 1 members are cooperatively responsible for ammonium uptake in rice under low ammonium condition	2021	New Phytol	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Chuo 2-20-1, Kurashiki, 710-0046, Japan	Ammonium is a preferential nitrogen form for rice (Oryza sativa) grown in paddy field, but the molecular mechanisms for ammonium uptake have not been well understood. We functionally characterized three members belonging to ammonium transporter 1 (AMT1) and investigated their contributions to ammonium uptake. Spatial expression analysis showed that the upregulated expression of OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2 and downregulated expression of OsAMT1;3 by ammonium were higher in the root mature region than in the root tips. All OsAMT1 members were polarly localized at the distal side of exodermis in the mature region of crown roots and lateral roots. Upon exposure to ammonium, localization of OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2 was also observed in the endoplasmic reticulum, but their abundance in the plasma membrane was not changed. Single knockout of either gene did not affect ammonium uptake, but knockout of all three genes resulted in 95% reduction of ammonium uptake. However, the nitrogen uptake did not differ between the wild-type rice and triple mutants at high ammonium and nitrate supply. Our results indicate that three OsAMT1 members are cooperatively required for uptake of low ammonium in rice roots and that they undergo a distinct regulatory mechanism in response to ammonium.
NA	OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2 Coordinate Root Morphological and Physiological Responses to Ammonium for Efficient Nitrogen Foraging in Rice.	2022	Plant Cell Physiol	Key Laboratory of Plant-Soil Interactions, MOE, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, National Academy of Agriculture Green Development, China Agricultural University, No. 2 Yuanmingyuan West Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100193, China.	Optimal plant growth and development rely on morphological and physiological adaptions of the root system to forage heterogeneously distributed nitrogen (N) in soils. Rice grows mainly in the paddy soil where ammonium (NH4+) is present as the major N source. Although root NH4+ foraging behaviors are expected to be agronomically relevant, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that NH4+ supply transiently enhanced the high-affinity NH4+ uptake and stimulated lateral root (LR) branching and elongation. These synergistic physiological and morphological responses were closely related to NH4+-induced expression of NH4+ transporters OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2 in roots. The two independent double mutants (dko) defective in OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2 failed to induce NH4+ uptake and stimulate LR formation, suggesting that OsAMT1s conferred the substrate-dependent root NH4+ foraging. In dko plants, NH4+ was unable to activate the expression of OsPIN2, and the OsPIN2 mutant (lra1) exhibited a strong reduction in NH4+-triggered LR branching, suggesting that the auxin pathway was likely involved in OsAMT1s-dependent LR branching. Importantly, OsAMT1s-dependent root NH4+ foraging behaviors facilitated rice growth and N acquisition under fluctuating NH4+ supply. These results revealed an essential role of OsAMT1s in synergizing root morphological and physiological processes, allowing for efficient root NH4+ foraging to optimize N capture under fluctuating N availabilities.
NA	Mutation of phytochrome B promotes resistance to sheath blight and saline-alkaline stress via increasing ammonium uptake in rice.	2022	Plant J	College of Plant Protection, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, 110866, China.	Phytochrome B (PhyB), a red-light receptor, plays important roles in diverse biological processes in plants; however, its function in NH(4) (+) uptake and stress responses of plants is unclear. Here, we observed that mutation in indeterminate domain 10 (IDD10), which encodes a key transcription factor in NH(4) (+) signaling, led to NH(4) (+) -sensitive root growth in light but not in the dark. Genetic combinations of idd10 and phy mutants demonstrated that phyB, but not phyA or phyC, suppressed NH(4) (+) -sensitive root growth of idd10. PhyB mutants and PhyB overexpressors (PhyB OXs) accumulated more and less NH(4) (+) , respectively, compared with wild-type plants. Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) revealed that PhyB negatively regulated NH(4) (+) -mediated induction of Ammonium transporter 1;2 (AMT1;2). AMT1 RNAi plants with suppressed AMT1;1, AMT1;2, and AMT1;3 expression exhibited shorter primary roots under NH(4) (+) conditions. This suggested that NH(4) (+) uptake might be positively associated with root growth. Further, PhyB interacted with and inhibited IDD10 and brassinazole-resistant 1 (BZR1). IDD10 interacted with BZR1 to activate AMT1;2. NH(4) (+) uptake is known to promote resistance of rice (Oryza sativa) to sheath blight (ShB) and saline-alkaline stress. Inoculation of Rhizoctonia solani demonstrated that PhyB and IDD10 negatively regulated and AMT1 and BZR1 positively regulated resistance of rice to ShB. In addition, PhyB negatively regulated and IDD10 and AMT1 positively regulated resistance of rice to saline-alkaline stress. This suggested that PhyB-IDD10-AMT1;2 signaling regulates the saline-alkaline response, whereas the PhyB-BZR1-AMT1;2 pathway modulates ShB resistance. Collectively, these data prove that mutation in the PhyB gene enhances the resistance of rice to ShB and saline-alkaline stress by increasing NH(4) (+) uptake.
