OsAMT1;1|OsAMT1.1	OsAMT1;2|OsAMT1.2	Feedback regulation of the ammonium transporter gene family AMT1 by glutamine in rice	The three members of the rice OsAMT1 gene family of ammonium transporters show distinct expression patterns; constitutive and ammonium-promoted expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1; root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2; root-specific and nitrogen-repressible expression for OsAMT1;3 [Sonoda et al
