NA	ABA Regulates Subcellular Redistribution of OsABI-LIKE2, a Negative Regulator in ABA Signaling, to Control Root Architecture and Drought Resistance in Oryza sativa.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China.	The phytohormone ABA is a key stress signal in plants. Although the identification of ABA receptors led to significant progress in understanding the Arabidopsis ABA signaling pathway, there are still many unsolved mysteries regarding ABA signaling in monocots, such as rice. Here, we report that a rice ortholog of AtABI1 and AtABI2, named OsABI-LIKE2 (OsABIL2), plays a negative role in rice ABA signaling. Overexpression of OsABIL2 not only led to ABA insensitivity, but also significantly altered plant developmental phenotypes, including stomatal density and root architecture, which probably caused the hypersensitivity to drought stress. OsABIL2 interacts with OsPYL1, SAPK8 and SAPK10 both in vitro and in vivo, and the phosphatase activity of OsABIL2 was repressed by ABA-bound OsPYL1. However, unlike many other solely nuclear-localized clade A type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), OsABIL2 is localized in both the nucleus and cytosol. Furthermore, OsABIL2 interacts with and co-localized with OsPYL1 mainly in the cytosol, and ABA treatment regulates the nucleus-cytosol distribution of OsABIL2, suggesting a different mechanism for the activation of ABA signaling. Taken together, this study provides significant insights into rice ABA signaling and indicates the important role of OsABIL2 in regulating root development.
NA	Modulation of ABA signaling by altering VxGΦL motif of PP2Cs in Oryza sativa.	2017	Mol Plant	Department of Biological Sciences, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Republic of Korea.	Abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway is regulated by Clade A type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2CAs) in plant. In the presence of ABA, PP2Cs release stress/ABA-activated protein kinases by binding to ABA-bound receptors (PYL/RCARs) for activation. Although the wedging tryptophan in PP2Cs is critical in the interaction with PYL/RCARs in Arabidopsis and rice, it remains elusive how other interface regions are involved in the interaction. Here, we identified a conserved region on PP2Cs, termed VxGΦL motif, that modulates the interaction with PYL/RCARs through its second and forth residues. The effects of the second and forth residues on the interaction of OsPP2C50 with several OsPYL/RCAR proteins were investigated by systematic mutagenesis. Investigating the interaction between OsPP2C50 and OsPYL/RCAR3, one OsPP2C50 mutant, VFGML (&quot;FM&quot;) mutant, lowered the affinity by ∼15-fold. Comparison of the crystal structures of OsPP2C50:ABA:OsPYL/RCAR3 wild-type and FM mutant revealed local conformational changes near the VxGΦL motif, further supported by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. In rice protoplasts, ABA signaling was altered by mutations in the VxGΦL motif. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C50FM changed ABA sensitivity, validating the in vitro results. Taken together, the VxGΦL motif of PP2Cs seems to modulate the affinity to PYL/RCARs with potentials to alter the ABA signaling, leading to the differential sensitivity to ABA in planta.
