OsABIL3|OsPP2C50	 ABA 	Modulation of ABA signaling by altering VxGΦL motif of PP2Cs in Oryza sativa.	 Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C50FM changed ABA sensitivity, validating the in vitro results
OsABIL3|OsPP2C50	R protein	Modulation of ABA signaling by altering VxGΦL motif of PP2Cs in Oryza sativa.	 The effects of the second and forth residues on the interaction of OsPP2C50 with several OsPYL/RCAR proteins were investigated by systematic mutagenesis
OsABIL3|OsPP2C50	ABA	Modulation of ABA signaling by altering VxGΦL motif of PP2Cs in Oryza sativa.	 Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C50FM changed ABA sensitivity, validating the in vitro results
OsABIL3|OsPP2C50	 ABA 	Structural determinants for pyrabactin recognition in ABA receptors in Oryza sativa.	 The water-mediated interaction between the wedging Trp-259 of OsPP2C50 and pyrabactin is lost, undermining the structural integrity of the ABA receptor:co-receptor
OsABIL3|OsPP2C50	ABA	Structural determinants for pyrabactin recognition in ABA receptors in Oryza sativa.	 The water-mediated interaction between the wedging Trp-259 of OsPP2C50 and pyrabactin is lost, undermining the structural integrity of the ABA receptor:co-receptor
OsABIL3|OsPP2C50	 ABA 	Two Clade A Phosphatase 2Cs Expressed in Guard Cells Physically Interact With Abscisic Acid Signaling Components to Induce Stomatal Closure in Rice.	OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 is major negative regulators of ABA signaling regarding stomata closing in rice
OsABIL3|OsPP2C50	stomatal	Two Clade A Phosphatase 2Cs Expressed in Guard Cells Physically Interact With Abscisic Acid Signaling Components to Induce Stomatal Closure in Rice.	 We identified that only OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 among 9 OsPP2CAs might be related with stomatal closure/opening signaling based on guard cell specific expression and subcellular localization
OsABIL3|OsPP2C50	ABA	Two Clade A Phosphatase 2Cs Expressed in Guard Cells Physically Interact With Abscisic Acid Signaling Components to Induce Stomatal Closure in Rice.	OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 is major negative regulators of ABA signaling regarding stomata closing in rice
OsABIL3|OsPP2C50	stomata	Two Clade A Phosphatase 2Cs Expressed in Guard Cells Physically Interact With Abscisic Acid Signaling Components to Induce Stomatal Closure in Rice.	OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 is major negative regulators of ABA signaling regarding stomata closing in rice
OsABIL3|OsPP2C50	water loss	Two Clade A Phosphatase 2Cs Expressed in Guard Cells Physically Interact With Abscisic Acid Signaling Components to Induce Stomatal Closure in Rice.	 Transgenic rice overexpressing OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 showed significantly higher water loss than control
