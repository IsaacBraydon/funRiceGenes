OsABIL3|OsPP2C50	 ABA 	Modulation of ABA signaling by altering VxGΦL motif of PP2Cs in Oryza sativa.	 Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C50FM changed ABA sensitivity, validating the in vitro results
OsABIL3|OsPP2C50	R protein	Modulation of ABA signaling by altering VxGΦL motif of PP2Cs in Oryza sativa.	 The effects of the second and forth residues on the interaction of OsPP2C50 with several OsPYL/RCAR proteins were investigated by systematic mutagenesis
