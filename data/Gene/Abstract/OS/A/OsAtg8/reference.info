10.1007-s11033-006-9011-0.pdf	Identification and characterization of two rice autophagy associated genes, OsAtg8 and OsAtg4	2006	Mol Biol Rep	Institute of Genetics, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, 220 Handan Road, Shanghai, 200433, China.	Autophagy is an intracellular process for vacuolar degradation of cytoplasmic components. The molecular machinery responsible for yeast and mammalian autophagy has begun to be elucidated at the cellular level. A genome-wide search revealed significant conservation among autophagy genes in yeast and Arabidopsis. Up till now, however, there is no report about rice autophagy associated genes. Here we cloned OsAtg8 and OsAtg4 from Oryza sativa and detected their expression patterns in various tissues. Immunoblotting analysis showed that carboxyl terminus of OsAtg8 can be cleaved in yeast cell. Mutation analysis revealed that the conserved Gly117 residue of OsAtg8 was essential for its characteristic C-terminal cleavage as similar to that found in mammalian and yeast Atg8. We further proved that OsAtg8 interacted with OsAtg4, and this interaction was not affected by the conserved Gly117 mutation. Our results demonstrate that Atg8 conjugation pathway is conserved in rice and may play important roles in rice autophagy.
NA	Autophagy targets Hd1 for vacuolar degradation to regulate rice flowering.	2022	Mol Plant	Key Laboratory of Photobiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.	Flowering time (heading date) is a critical agronomic trait that determines the yield and regional adaptability of crops. Heading date 1 (Hd1) is a central regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice (Oryza sativa). However, how the homeostasis of Hd1 protein is achieved is poorly understood. Here, we report that the nuclear autophagy pathway mediates Hd1 degradation in the dark to regulate flowering. Loss of autophagy function results in an accumulation of Hd1 and delays flowering under both short-day and long-day conditions. In the dark, nucleus-localized Hd1 is recognized as a substrate for autophagy and is subjected to vacuolar degradation via the autophagy protein OsATG8. The Hd1-OsATG8 interaction is required for autophagic degradation of Hd1 in the dark. Our study reveals a new mechanism by which Hd1 protein homeostasis is regulated by autophagy to control rice flowering. Our study also indicates that the regulation of flowering by autophagic degradation of Hd1 orthologs may have arisen over the course of mesangiosperm evolution, which would have increased their flexibility and adaptability to the environment by modulating flowering time.
NA	A tripartite rheostat controls self-regulated host plant resistance to insects.	2023	Nature	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.	Plants deploy receptor-like kinases and nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors to confer host plant resistance (HPR) to herbivores(1). These gene-for-gene interactions between insects and their hosts have been proposed for more than 50 years(2). However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie HPR have been elusive, as the identity and sensing mechanisms of insect avirulence effectors have remained unknown. Here we identify an insect salivary protein perceived by a plant immune receptor. The BPH14-interacting salivary protein (BISP) from the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål) is secreted into rice (Oryza sativa) during feeding. In susceptible plants, BISP targets O. satvia RLCK185 (OsRLCK185; hereafter Os is used to denote O. satvia-related proteins or genes) to suppress basal defences. In resistant plants, the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptor BPH14 directly binds BISP to activate HPR. Constitutive activation of Bph14-mediated immunity is detrimental to plant growth and productivity. The fine-tuning of Bph14-mediated HPR is achieved through direct binding of BISP and BPH14 to the selective autophagy cargo receptor OsNBR1, which delivers BISP to OsATG8 for degradation. Autophagy therefore controls BISP levels. In Bph14 plants, autophagy restores cellular homeostasis by downregulating HPR when feeding by brown planthoppers ceases. We identify an insect saliva protein sensed by a plant immune receptor and discover a three-way interaction system that offers opportunities for developing high-yield, insect-resistant crops.
