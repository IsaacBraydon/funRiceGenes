OsAtg4	OsAtg8	Identification and characterization of two rice autophagy associated genes, OsAtg8 and OsAtg4	Here we cloned OsAtg8 and OsAtg4 from Oryza sativa and detected their expression patterns in various tissues
OsAtg4	OsAtg8	Identification and characterization of two rice autophagy associated genes, OsAtg8 and OsAtg4	We further proved that OsAtg8 interacted with OsAtg4, and this interaction was not affected by the conserved Gly117 mutation
OsAtg4	OsAtg8	Identification and characterization of two rice autophagy associated genes, OsAtg8 and OsAtg4	Identification and characterization of two rice autophagy associated genes, OsAtg8 and OsAtg4
Hd1	OsAtg8	Autophagy targets Hd1 for vacuolar degradation to regulate rice flowering.	 In the dark, nucleus-localized Hd1 is recognized as a substrate for autophagy and is subjected to vacuolar degradation via the autophagy protein OsATG8
