OsAtg4	OsAtg8	Identification and characterization of two rice autophagy associated genes, OsAtg8 and OsAtg4	 Here we cloned OsAtg8 and OsAtg4 from Oryza sativa and detected their expression patterns in various tissues| We further proved that OsAtg8 interacted with OsAtg4, and this interaction was not affected by the conserved Gly117 mutation|Identification and characterization of two rice autophagy associated genes, OsAtg8 and OsAtg4
