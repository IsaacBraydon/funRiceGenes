The microRNA miR393 has been shown to play a role in plant development and in the stress response by targeting mRNAs that code for the auxin receptors in Arabidopsis. In this study, we verified that two rice auxin receptor gene homologs (OsTIR1 and OsAFB2) could be targeted by OsmiR393 (Os for Oryza sativa). Two new phenotypes (increased tillers and early flowering) and two previously observed phenotypes (reduced tolerance to salt and drought and hyposensitivity to auxin) were observed in the OsmiR393-overexpressing rice plants. The OsmiR393-overexpressing rice demonstrated hyposensitivity to synthetic auxin-analog treatments. These data indicated that the phenotypes of OsmiR393-overexpressing rice may be caused through hyposensitivity to the auxin signal by reduced expression of two auxin receptor genes (OsTIR1 and OsAFB2). The expression of an auxin transporter (OsAUX1) and a tillering inhibitor (OsTB1) were downregulated by overexpression of OsmiR393, which suggested that a gene chain from OsmiR393 to rice tillering may be from OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 to OsAUX1, which affected the transportation of auxin, then to OsTB1, which finally controlled tillering. The positive phenotypes (increased tillers and early flowering) and negative phenotypes (reduced tolerance to salt and hyposensitivity to auxin) of OsmiR393-overexpressing rice present a dilemma for molecular breeding.
j.1744-7909.2011.01059.x.pdf	Adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor-GTPase-activating protein stimulates the transport of AUX1 endosome, which relies on actin cytoskeletal organization in rice root development	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	Key Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Molecular Environmental Physiology, Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	Polar auxin transport, which depends on polarized subcellular distribution of AUXIN RESISTANT 1/LIKE AUX1 (AUX1/LAX) influx carriers and PIN-FORMED (PIN) efflux carriers, mediates various processes of plant growth and development. Endosomal recycling of PIN1 is mediated by an adenosine diphosphate (ADP)ribosylation factor (ARF)-GTPase exchange factor protein, GNOM. However, the mediation of auxin influx carrier recycling is poorly understood. Here, we report that overexpression of OsAGAP, an ARF-GTPase-activating protein in rice, stimulates vesicle transport from the plasma membrane to the Golgi apparatus in protoplasts and transgenic plants and induces the accumulation of early endosomes and AUX1. AUX1 endosomes could partially colocalize with FM4-64 labeled early endosome after actin disruption. Furthermore, OsAGAP is involved in actin cytoskeletal organization, and its overexpression tends to reduce the thickness and bundling of actin filaments. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis revealed exocytosis of the AUX1 recycling endosome was not affected in the OsAGAP overexpression cells, and was only slightly promoted when the actin filaments were completely disrupted by Lat B. Thus, we propose that AUX1 accumulation in the OsAGAP overexpression and actin disrupted cells may be due to the fact that endocytosis of the auxin influx carrier AUX1 early endosome was greatly promoted by actin cytoskeleton disruption.
NA	OsAUX1 controls lateral root initiation in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China.	Polar auxin transport, mediated by influx and efflux transporters, controls many aspects of plant growth and development. The auxin influx carriers in Arabidopsis have been shown to control lateral root development and gravitropism, but little is known about these proteins in rice. This paper reports on the functional characterization of OsAUX1. Three OsAUX1 T-DNA insertion mutants and RNAi knockdown transgenic plants reduced lateral root initiation compared to WT plants. OsAUX1 overexpression plants exhibited increased lateral root initiation and OsAUX1 was highly expressed in lateral roots and lateral root primordia. Similarly, the auxin reporter, DR5-GUS, was expressed at lower levels in osaux1 than in the WT plants, which indicated that the auxin levels in the mutant roots had decreased. Exogenous NAA treatment rescued the defective phenotype in osaux1-1 plants, whereas IAA and 2,4-D could not, which suggested that OsAUX1 was a putative auxin influx carrier. The transcript levels of several auxin-signaling genes and cell cycle genes significantly declined in osaux1, hinting that the regulatory role of OsAUX1 may be mediated by auxin-signaling and cell cycle genes. Overall, our results indicated that OsAUX1 was involved in polar auxin transport and functioned to control auxin-mediated lateral root initiation in rice.
NA	The auxin transporter, OsAUX1, is involved in primary root and root hair elongation and in Cd stress responses in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Auxin and cadmium (Cd) stress play critical roles during root development. There are only a few reports on the mechanisms how Cd stress influences auxin homeostasis and affects primary root (PR) and lateral root (LR) development, whereas there is almost nothing known how auxin and Cd interfere with root hair (RH) development. Here, we characterize rice osaux1 mutants that have longer PR and shorter RH in hydroponic culture, and that are more sensitive to Cd stress compared to WT/Dongjin (DJ). OsAUX1 expression in root hair cells is different from its paralogous gene, AtAUX1, expressed in non-hair cells. However, OsAUX1 - like AtAUX1 - also localizes at the plasma membrane and seems to function as an auxin tranporter. Decreased auxin distribution and contents in osaux1 mutant result in reduction of OsCyCB1;1 expression and shortened PR, LR and RH under Cd stress, but can be rescued by the membrane-permeable auxin, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). Auxin transport inhibitors, 1-naphthoxyacetic acid (NOA) and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), increased the Cd sensitivity of rice WT. Cd contents in the osaux1 mutant were not altered but reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage was enhanced, further increasing the osaux1 mutant sensitivity to Cd stress. Taken together, our results indicate that OsAUX1 plays an important role in root development and in responses to Cd stress. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
NA	Dynamic Regulation of Auxin Response during Rice Development Revealed by Newly Established Hormone Biosensor Markers.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine, Ministry of Education, Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong UniversityShanghai, China; Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic &amp; Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University-University of Adelaide Joint Centre for Agriculture and Health, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong UniversityShanghai, China.	The hormone auxin is critical for many plant developmental processes. Unlike the model eudicot plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), auxin distribution and signaling in rice tissues has not been systematically investigated due to the absence of suitable auxin response reporters. In this study we observed the conservation of auxin signaling components between Arabidopsis and model monocot crop rice (Oryza sativa), and generated complementary types of auxin biosensor constructs, one derived from the Aux/IAA-based biosensor DII-VENUS but constitutively driven by maize ubiquitin-1 promoter, and the other termed DR5-VENUS in which a synthetic auxin-responsive promoter (DR5rev ) was used to drive expression of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Using the obtained transgenic lines, we observed that during the vegetative development, accumulation of DR5-VENUS signal was at young and mature leaves, tiller buds and stem base. Notably, abundant DR5-VENUS signals were observed in the cytoplasm of cortex cells surrounding lateral root primordia (LRP) in rice. In addition, auxin maxima and dynamic re-localization were seen at the initiation sites of inflorescence and spikelet primordia including branch meristems (BMs), female and male organs. The comparison of these observations among Arabidopsis, rice and maize suggests the unique role of auxin in regulating rice lateral root emergence and reproduction. Moreover, protein localization of auxin transporters PIN1 homologs and GFP tagged OsAUX1 overlapped with DR5-VENUS during spikelet development, helping validate these auxin response reporters are reliable markers in rice. This work firstly reveals the direct correspondence between auxin distribution and rice reproductive and root development at tissue and cellular level, and provides high-resolution auxin tools to probe fundamental developmental processes in rice and to establish links between auxin, development and agronomical traits like yield or root architecture.
NA	Rice auxin influx carrier OsAUX1 facilitates root hair elongation in response to low external phosphate.	2018	Nat Commun	Centre for Plant Integrative Biology (CPIB), School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, LE12 5RD, UK.	Root traits such as root angle and hair length influence resource acquisition particularly for immobile nutrients like phosphorus (P). Here, we attempted to modify root angle in rice by disrupting the OsAUX1 auxin influx transporter gene in an effort to improve rice P acquisition efficiency. We show by X-ray microCT imaging that root angle is altered in the osaux1 mutant, causing preferential foraging in the top soil where P normally accumulates, yet surprisingly, P acquisition efficiency does not improve. Through closer investigation, we reveal that OsAUX1 also promotes root hair elongation in response to P limitation. Reporter studies reveal that auxin response increases in the root hair zone in low P environments. We demonstrate that OsAUX1 functions to mobilize auxin from the root apex to the differentiation zone where this signal promotes hair elongation when roots encounter low external P. We conclude that auxin and OsAUX1 play key roles in promoting root foraging for P in rice.
NA	The WUSCHEL-related homeobox transcription factor OsWOX4 controls the primary root elongation by activating OsAUX1 in rice	2020	Plant Science	Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Bioengineering College, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400030, PR China.	Primary root is the basic component of root system and plays a key role in early seedling growth and survival in rice. However, the molecular mechanism of primary root elongation still needs to be well understood. Here, we showed that OsWOX4, a WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) transcription factor, was involved in the primary root elongation in rice. Silencing of OsWOX4 by RNA interference (RNAi) greatly increased the primary root length, whereas its overexpression reduced primary root elongation significantly. Moreover, the size of meristem zone and epidermal cell length of mature zone in RNAi root tips were drastically enhanced, while they were reduced markedly in overexpression lines, in comparison with that of wild type. Further analysis showed that the accumulation of free IAA was slightly increased in RNAi roots, but drastically reduced in plants overexpressing OsWOX4. The expression of genes responsible for auxin biosynthesis and transport was also changed in OsWOX4 transgenic lines. Transient transcriptional activation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that OsWOX4 directly regulated the transcription of OsAUX1 through binding to its promoter region. Collectively, our results indicated that OsWOX4 played a crucial role in the primary root elongation by regulating auxin transport, suggesting its importance in rice root system architecture.
NA	MiR529a controls plant height, tiller number, panicle architecture and grain size by regulating SPL target genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2021	Plant Sci	Institute of Crop Science, Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Crop Germplasm, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world. Breeding high-yield, multi-resistant and high-quality varieties has always been the goal of rice breeding. Rice tiller, panicle architecture and grain size are the constituent factors of yield, which are regulated by both genetic and environmental factors, including miRNAs, transcription factors, and downstream target genes. Previous studies have shown that SPL (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING-LIKE) transcription factors can control rice tiller, panicle architecture and grain size, which were regulated by miR156, miR529 and miR535. In this study, we obtained miR529a target mimicry (miR529a-MIMIC) transgenic plants to investigate plant phenotypes, physiological and molecular characteristics together with miR529a overexpression (miR529a-OE) and wild type (WT) to explore the function of miR529a and its SPL target genes in rice. We found that OsSPL2, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18 at seedling stage were regulated by miR529a, but there had complicated mechanism to control plant height. OsSPL2, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and SPL18 at tillering stage were regulated by miR529a to control plant height and tiller number. And panicle architecture and grain size were controlled by miR529a through altering the expression of all five target genes OsSPL2, OsSPL7, OsSPL14, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18. Our study suggested that miR529a might control rice growth and development by regulating different SPL target genes at different stages, which could provide a new method to improve rice yield by regulating miR529a and its SPL target genes.
NA	The Potassium Transporter OsHAK5 Alters Rice Architecture via ATP-Dependent Transmembrane Auxin Fluxes	2020	Plant Commun	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Lower-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Plant HAK/KUP/KT family members function as plasma membrane (PM) H+/K+ symporters and may modulate chemiosmotically-driven polar auxin transport (PAT). Here, we show that inactivation of OsHAK5, a rice K+ transporter gene, decreased rootward and shootward PAT, tiller number, and the length of both lateral roots and root hairs, while OsHAK5 overexpression increased PAT, tiller number, and root hair length, irrespective of the K+ supply. Inhibitors of ATP-binding-cassette type-B transporters, NPA and BUM, abolished the OsHAK5-overexpression effect on PAT. The mechanistic basis of these changes included the OsHAK5-mediated decrease of transmembrane potential (depolarization), increase of extracellular pH, and increase of PM-ATPase activity. These findings highlight the dual roles of OsHAK5 in altering cellular chemiosmotic gradients (generated continuously by PM H+-ATPase) and regulating ATP-dependent auxin transport. Both functions may underlie the prominent effect of OsHAK5 on rice architecture, which may be exploited in the future to increase crop yield via genetic manipulations.
