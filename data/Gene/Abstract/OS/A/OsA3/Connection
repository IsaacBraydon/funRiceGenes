OsA3	OsA8	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase OsDMI3 positively regulates saline-alkaline tolerance in rice roots	 Moreover, real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsDMI3 up-regulated the transcript levels of OsSOS1 and PM-H+-ATPase genes OsA3 and OsA8 in saline-alkaline stressed rice plants
OsA3	OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase OsDMI3 positively regulates saline-alkaline tolerance in rice roots	 Moreover, real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsDMI3 up-regulated the transcript levels of OsSOS1 and PM-H+-ATPase genes OsA3 and OsA8 in saline-alkaline stressed rice plants
OsA3	OsNHA1|OsSOS1	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase OsDMI3 positively regulates saline-alkaline tolerance in rice roots	 Moreover, real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsDMI3 up-regulated the transcript levels of OsSOS1 and PM-H+-ATPase genes OsA3 and OsA8 in saline-alkaline stressed rice plants
OsA3	OSA7|osAHA7|AHA7|LMPA	Isoforms of plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase in rice root and shoot are differentially induced by starvation and resupply of NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª or NH‚Ç<U+383C><U+3E34>+.	 Resupply of NH‚Ç<U+383C><U+3E34>+ resulted in the induction of the following OsA1, OsA3 and OsA7 isoforms in the roots while OsA1 was induced in the shoots
