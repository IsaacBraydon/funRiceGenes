cr20117a.pdf	OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice	2011	Cell Res	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	The events occurring at the onset of meiosis have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, OsAM1 was identified in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by map-based cloning. OsAM1, a homolog of Arabidopsis SWI1 and maize AM1, encodes a protein with a coiled-coil domain in its central region. In the Osam1 mutant, pollen mother cells are arrested at leptotene, showing that OsAM1 is required for the leptotene-zygotene transition. Immunocytological analysis revealed that OsAM1 exists as foci in early prophase I meiocytes. Very faint OsREC8 foci persisted in the Osam1 mutant, indicating that OsAM1 is not required for the initial meiotic recruitment of OsREC8. In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes. In contrast, in pair2, Osmer3 and zep1 mutants, OsAM1 could be loaded normally, suggesting that OsAM1 plays a fundamental role in building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis.

Shugoshin is a conserved protein in eukaryotes that protects the centromeric cohesin of sister chromatids from cleavage by separase during meiosis. In this study, we identify the rice (Oryza sativa, 2n=2x=24) homolog of ZmSGO1 in maize (Zea mays), named OsSGO1. During both mitosis and meiosis, OsSGO1 is recruited from nucleoli onto centromeres at the onset of prophase. In the Tos17-insertional Ossgo1-1 mutant, centromeres of sister chromatids separate precociously from each other from metaphase I, which causes unequal chromosome segregation during meiosis II. Moreover, the release of OsSGO1 from nucleoli is completely blocked in Ossgo1-1, which leads to the absence of OsSGO1 in centromeric regions after the onset of mitosis and meiosis. Furthermore, the timely assembly and maintenance of synaptonemal complexes during early prophase I are affected in Ossgo1 mutants. Finally, we found that the centromeric localization of OsSGO1 depends on OsAM1, not other meiotic proteins such as OsREC8, PAIR2, OsMER3, or ZEP1.
