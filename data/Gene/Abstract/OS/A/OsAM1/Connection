OsAM1	OsRad21-4|OsREC8	OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice	 Very faint OsREC8 foci persisted in the Osam1 mutant, indicating that OsAM1 is not required for the initial meiotic recruitment of OsREC8
OsAM1	PAIR2	OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice	 In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes
OsAM1	PAIR2	OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice	 In contrast, in pair2, Osmer3 and zep1 mutants, OsAM1 could be loaded normally, suggesting that OsAM1 plays a fundamental role in building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis
OsAM1	ZEP1	OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice	 In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes
OsAM1	ZEP1	OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice	 In contrast, in pair2, Osmer3 and zep1 mutants, OsAM1 could be loaded normally, suggesting that OsAM1 plays a fundamental role in building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis
MER3|RCK	OsAM1	OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice	 In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes

OsAM1	OsRad21-4|OsREC8	OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis	 Finally, we found that the centromeric localization of OsSGO1 depends on OsAM1, not other meiotic proteins such as OsREC8, PAIR2, OsMER3, or ZEP1
OsAM1	PAIR2	OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis	 Finally, we found that the centromeric localization of OsSGO1 depends on OsAM1, not other meiotic proteins such as OsREC8, PAIR2, OsMER3, or ZEP1
