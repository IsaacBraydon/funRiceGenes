NA	Rice H2A.Z negatively Regulates Genes Responsive to Nutrient Starvation but Promotes Expression of Key Housekeeping Genes.	2018	J Exp Bot	Department of Biological Sciences, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA.	The H2A.Z histone variant plays a role in the modulation of environmental responses, but the nature of the associated mechanisms remains enigmatic. We investigated global H2A.Z deposition and transcriptomic changes in rice (Oryza sativa) upon exposure to phosphate (Pi) deficiency and in response to RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of OsARP6, which encodes a key component of the H2A.Z exchange complex. Both Pi deficiency and OsARP6-knockdown resulted in similar, profound effects on global H2A.Z distribution. H2A.Z in the gene body of stress-responsive genes was anti-correlated with gene expression, which was more apparent in response to Pi deficiency. In contrast, the role of H2A.Z at the TSS was more context dependent, acting as a repressor of some stress-responsive genes, but an activator of some genes with house-keeping functions. This was especially evident upon OsARP6 knockdown, which resulted in a number of genes linked to chloroplast function, that contained decreases in H2A.Z at the TSS and were down-regulated. Consistently, OsARP6-RNAi plants exhibited lower chlorophyll content relative to wild type. Our results demonstrate that gene body-localized H2A.Z plays a prominent role in repressing stress-responsive genes under non-inductive conditions, whereas H2A.Z at the TSS functions as a positive or negative regulator of transcription.
NA	OsARP6 Is Involved in Internode Elongation by Regulating Cell-Cycle-Related Genes	2021	Biomolecules	School of Life Sciences, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230027, China.	The SWR1 complex (SWR1-C) is important for the deposition of histone variant H2A.Z into chromatin to regulate gene expression. Characterization of SWR1-C subunits in Arabidopsis thaliana has revealed their role in variety of developmental processes. Oryza sativa actin related protein 6 (OsARP6) is a subunit of rice SWR1-C. Its role in rice plant development is unknown. Here, we examined the subcellular localization, expression patterns, and loss of function phenotypes for this protein and found that OsARP6 is a nuclear localized protein, and is broadly expressed. OsARP6 interacted with OsPIE1, a central ATPase subunit of rice SWR1-C. The osarp6 knockout mutants displayed pleiotropic phenotypic alterations in vegetative and reproductive traits, including semi-dwarf phenotype, lower tillers number, short leaf length, changes in spikelet morphology, and seed abortion. Microscopic thin sectioning of the top internode revealed that the dwarf phenotype of osarp6 was due to reduced number of cells rather than reduced cell length. The altered transcript level of genes involved in cell division suggested that OsARP6 affects cell cycle regulation. In addition, H2A.Z levels were reduced at the promoters and transcription start sites (TSS) of the regulated genes in osarp6 plants. Together, these results suggest that OsARP6 is involved in rice plant development, and H2A.Z deposition.
