OsARP6	chloroplast	Rice H2A.Z negatively Regulates Genes Responsive to Nutrient Starvation but Promotes Expression of Key Housekeeping Genes.	 This was especially evident upon OsARP6 knockdown, which resulted in a number of genes linked to chloroplast function, that contained decreases in H2A
OsARP6	leaf	OsARP6 Is Involved in Internode Elongation by Regulating Cell-Cycle-Related Genes	 The osarp6 knockout mutants displayed pleiotropic phenotypic alterations in vegetative and reproductive traits, including semi-dwarf phenotype, lower tillers number, short leaf length, changes in spikelet morphology, and seed abortion
OsARP6	plant development	OsARP6 Is Involved in Internode Elongation by Regulating Cell-Cycle-Related Genes	 Together, these results suggest that OsARP6 is involved in rice plant development, and H2A
OsARP6	spikelet	OsARP6 Is Involved in Internode Elongation by Regulating Cell-Cycle-Related Genes	 The osarp6 knockout mutants displayed pleiotropic phenotypic alterations in vegetative and reproductive traits, including semi-dwarf phenotype, lower tillers number, short leaf length, changes in spikelet morphology, and seed abortion
OsARP6	seed	OsARP6 Is Involved in Internode Elongation by Regulating Cell-Cycle-Related Genes	 The osarp6 knockout mutants displayed pleiotropic phenotypic alterations in vegetative and reproductive traits, including semi-dwarf phenotype, lower tillers number, short leaf length, changes in spikelet morphology, and seed abortion
OsARP6	ATPase	OsARP6 Is Involved in Internode Elongation by Regulating Cell-Cycle-Related Genes	 OsARP6 interacted with OsPIE1, a central ATPase subunit of rice SWR1-C
OsARP6	cell division	OsARP6 Is Involved in Internode Elongation by Regulating Cell-Cycle-Related Genes	 The altered transcript level of genes involved in cell division suggested that OsARP6 affects cell cycle regulation
OsARP6	vegetative	OsARP6 Is Involved in Internode Elongation by Regulating Cell-Cycle-Related Genes	 The osarp6 knockout mutants displayed pleiotropic phenotypic alterations in vegetative and reproductive traits, including semi-dwarf phenotype, lower tillers number, short leaf length, changes in spikelet morphology, and seed abortion
OsARP6	reproductive	OsARP6 Is Involved in Internode Elongation by Regulating Cell-Cycle-Related Genes	 The osarp6 knockout mutants displayed pleiotropic phenotypic alterations in vegetative and reproductive traits, including semi-dwarf phenotype, lower tillers number, short leaf length, changes in spikelet morphology, and seed abortion
OsARP6	dwarf	OsARP6 Is Involved in Internode Elongation by Regulating Cell-Cycle-Related Genes	 Microscopic thin sectioning of the top internode revealed that the dwarf phenotype of osarp6 was due to reduced number of cells rather than reduced cell length
OsARP6	cell cycle	OsARP6 Is Involved in Internode Elongation by Regulating Cell-Cycle-Related Genes	 The altered transcript level of genes involved in cell division suggested that OsARP6 affects cell cycle regulation
OsARP6	internode elongation	OsARP6 Is Involved in Internode Elongation by Regulating Cell-Cycle-Related Genes	OsARP6 Is Involved in Internode Elongation by Regulating Cell-Cycle-Related Genes
