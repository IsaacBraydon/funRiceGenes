OsACBP2	 OsACBP2 mRNA accumulated in embryos and endosperm of germinating seeds in qRT-PCR analysis, while Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) assays on OsACBP2pro::GUS rice transformants showed GUS expression in embryos, as well as the scutellum and aleurone layer of germinating seeds |  Deletion analysis of the OsACBP2 5'-flanking region revealed five copies of the seed cis-element, Skn-I-like motif (-1486/-1482, -956/-952, -939/-935, -826/-822, and -766/-762), and the removal of any adversely affected expression in seeds, thereby providing a molecular basis for OsACBP2 expression in seeds
