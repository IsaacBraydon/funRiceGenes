OsACBP2	grain	The overexpression of rice ACYL-COA-BINDING PROTEIN2 increases grain size and bran oil content in transgenic rice.	 Herein, rice OsACBP2 was demonstrated not only to play a role in seed development and germination, but also to influence grain size
OsACBP2	grain	The overexpression of rice ACYL-COA-BINDING PROTEIN2 increases grain size and bran oil content in transgenic rice.	 When OsACBP2 function was investigated using osacbp2 mutants and transgenic rice overexpressing OsACBP2 (OsACBP2-OE), osacbp2 was retarded in germination, while OsACBP2-OEs performed better than the wild-type and vector-transformed controls, in germination, seedling growth, grain size, and grain weight
OsACBP2	seedling	The overexpression of rice ACYL-COA-BINDING PROTEIN2 increases grain size and bran oil content in transgenic rice.	 When OsACBP2 function was investigated using osacbp2 mutants and transgenic rice overexpressing OsACBP2 (OsACBP2-OE), osacbp2 was retarded in germination, while OsACBP2-OEs performed better than the wild-type and vector-transformed controls, in germination, seedling growth, grain size, and grain weight
OsACBP2	development	The overexpression of rice ACYL-COA-BINDING PROTEIN2 increases grain size and bran oil content in transgenic rice.	 Herein, rice OsACBP2 was demonstrated not only to play a role in seed development and germination, but also to influence grain size
OsACBP2	seed	The overexpression of rice ACYL-COA-BINDING PROTEIN2 increases grain size and bran oil content in transgenic rice.	 Herein, rice OsACBP2 was demonstrated not only to play a role in seed development and germination, but also to influence grain size
OsACBP2	seed	The overexpression of rice ACYL-COA-BINDING PROTEIN2 increases grain size and bran oil content in transgenic rice.	 Deletion analysis of the OsACBP2 5'-flanking region revealed five copies of the seed cis-element, Skn-I-like motif (-1486/-1482, -956/-952, -939/-935, -826/-822, and -766/-762), and the removal of any adversely affected expression in seeds, thereby providing a molecular basis for OsACBP2 expression in seeds
OsACBP2	seed	The overexpression of rice ACYL-COA-BINDING PROTEIN2 increases grain size and bran oil content in transgenic rice.	 As dietary rice bran contains beneficial bioactive components, OsACBP2 appears to be a promising candidate for enriching seed nutritional value
OsACBP2	grain size	The overexpression of rice ACYL-COA-BINDING PROTEIN2 increases grain size and bran oil content in transgenic rice.	 Herein, rice OsACBP2 was demonstrated not only to play a role in seed development and germination, but also to influence grain size
OsACBP2	grain size	The overexpression of rice ACYL-COA-BINDING PROTEIN2 increases grain size and bran oil content in transgenic rice.	 When OsACBP2 function was investigated using osacbp2 mutants and transgenic rice overexpressing OsACBP2 (OsACBP2-OE), osacbp2 was retarded in germination, while OsACBP2-OEs performed better than the wild-type and vector-transformed controls, in germination, seedling growth, grain size, and grain weight
OsACBP2	endosperm	The overexpression of rice ACYL-COA-BINDING PROTEIN2 increases grain size and bran oil content in transgenic rice.	 OsACBP2 mRNA accumulated in embryos and endosperm of germinating seeds in qRT-PCR analysis, while Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) assays on OsACBP2pro::GUS rice transformants showed GUS expression in embryos, as well as the scutellum and aleurone layer of germinating seeds
OsACBP2	seed development	The overexpression of rice ACYL-COA-BINDING PROTEIN2 increases grain size and bran oil content in transgenic rice.	 Herein, rice OsACBP2 was demonstrated not only to play a role in seed development and germination, but also to influence grain size
OsACBP2	grain weight	The overexpression of rice ACYL-COA-BINDING PROTEIN2 increases grain size and bran oil content in transgenic rice.	 When OsACBP2 function was investigated using osacbp2 mutants and transgenic rice overexpressing OsACBP2 (OsACBP2-OE), osacbp2 was retarded in germination, while OsACBP2-OEs performed better than the wild-type and vector-transformed controls, in germination, seedling growth, grain size, and grain weight
