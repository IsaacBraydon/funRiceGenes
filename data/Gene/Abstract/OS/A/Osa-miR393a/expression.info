Osa-miR393a	 We found that Osa-miR393a transgenics had fewer, but longer tillers, enhanced drought stress tolerance associated with reduced stomata density and denser cuticles, improved salt stress tolerance associated with increased uptake of potassium, and enhanced heat stress tolerance associated with induced expression of small heat shock protein in comparison to wild type (WT) controls
