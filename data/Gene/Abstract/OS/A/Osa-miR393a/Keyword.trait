Osa-miR393a	development	Transgenic creeping bentgrass overexpressing Osa-miR393a exhibits altered plant development and improved multiple stress tolerance.	Transgenic creeping bentgrass overexpressing Osa-miR393a exhibits altered plant development and improved multiple stress tolerance.
Osa-miR393a	drought	Transgenic creeping bentgrass overexpressing Osa-miR393a exhibits altered plant development and improved multiple stress tolerance.	 We found that Osa-miR393a transgenics had fewer, but longer tillers, enhanced drought stress tolerance associated with reduced stomata density and denser cuticles, improved salt stress tolerance associated with increased uptake of potassium, and enhanced heat stress tolerance associated with induced expression of small heat shock protein in comparison to wild type (WT) controls
