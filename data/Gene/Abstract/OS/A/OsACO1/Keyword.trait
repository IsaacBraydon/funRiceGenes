OsACO1	ethylene	OsEIL1, a rice homolog of the Arabidopsis EIN3 regulates the ethylene response as a positive component	OsEBP89, an ethylene responsive element binding protein (EREBP) and OsACO1, an ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) oxidase gene were enhanced in the OsEIL1 overexpressing transgenic plants
OsACO1	abiotic stress	Identification and analysis of the mechanism underlying heat-inducible expression of rice aconitase 1.	In this study, we found that expression of the rice Aconitase gene OsACO1 is induced in a time-dependent manner by heat but not other typical abiotic stresses
