Since the OsEREBP1-like gene EBL1 (OsEREBP1-LIKE 1) was significantly downregulated in phyAphyBphyC mutants, EBL1 was suspected to repress ACO1 expression in wild-type plants. However, ACO1 was downregulated in EBL1 RNA interference plants, and the total length of these plants was slightly shorter than that of wild-type plants. This study shows that EBL1 is positively regulated by phytochrome B and associated with ACO1 upregulation.
1187.pdf	The multiple contributions of phytochromes to the control of internode elongation in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	Division of Plant Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan. iwamas@nias.affrc.go.jp	Although phyAphyBphyC phytochrome-null mutants in rice (Oryza sativa) have morphological changes and exhibit internode elongation, even as seedlings, it is unknown how phytochromes contribute to the control of internode elongation. A gene for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO1), which is an ethylene biosynthesis gene contributing to internode elongation, was up-regulated in phyAphyBphyC seedlings. ACO1 expression was controlled mainly by phyA and phyB, and a histochemical analysis showed that ACO1 expression was localized to the basal parts of leaf sheaths of phyAphyBphyC seedlings, similar to mature wild-type plants at the heading stage, when internode elongation was greatly promoted. In addition, the transcription levels of several ethylene- or gibberellin (GA)-related genes were changed in phyAphyBphyC mutants, and measurement of the plant hormone levels indicated low ethylene production and bioactive GA levels in the phyAphyBphyC mutants. We demonstrate that ethylene induced internode elongation and ACO1 expression in phyAphyBphyC seedlings but not in the wild type and that the presence of bioactive GAs was necessary for these effects. These findings indicate that phytochromes contribute to multiple steps in the control of internode elongation, such as the expression of the GA biosynthesis gene OsGA3ox2, ACO1 expression, and the onset of internode elongation.
j.1365-3040.2009.02106.x.pdf	ACO1, a gene for aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase: effects on internode elongation at the heading stage in rice	2010	Plant Cell Environ	Photobiology and Photosynthesis Research Unit, Division of Plant Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan. iwamas@nias.affrc.go.jp	Although reports on a gene for 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) oxidase (ACO1) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) suggest that high levels of its transcript are associated with internode elongation of deep-water rice during submergence, the role of ACO1 in rice development is largely unknown. The tissue-specificity of ACO1 expression indicated that its transcript significantly accumulated in lower parts of elongating internodes at the heading stage. Histochemical analysis and in situ hybridization showed that the ACO1 expression was localized in the basal parts of leaf sheaths immediately above nodes or the lower parts of elongating internodes. To further examine the role of ACO1, ACO1-deficient (aco1) and overexpressing (ACO1-OX) mutants were characterized. The total length of the elongated internodes of aco1 mutants was slightly shorter than that of wild-type plants and that of ACO1-OX mutants was longer. Interestingly, expression of the ACC synthase gene ACS1 and ethylene signalling gene OsEIN2 was up-regulated in the aco1 mutants. This study suggests that the ACO1 has a little effect on internode elongation at the heading stage, and that up-regulation of the ACS1 and OsEIN2 expression may attenuate inhibition of internode elongation.
OsEIL1.pdf	OsEIL1, a rice homolog of the Arabidopsis EIN3 regulates the ethylene response as a positive component	2006	Plant Mol Biol	Institute of Plant Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, PR China.	The plant gaseous hormone ethylene regulates many aspects of plant growth, development and responses to the environment. ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) is a transcription factor involved in the ethylene signal transduction pathway in Arabidopsis. To gain a better understanding of the ethylene signal transduction pathway in rice, six EIN3-like genes (designated OsEIL1-6) were identified. OsEIL1, which showed highest similarity with EIN3, was isolated and functionally characterized. Ectopic expression of OsEIL1 in Arabidopsis can partially complement the ein3-1 mutant. The transgenic rice plants with overexpression of OsEIL1 exhibit short root, coiled primary root and slightly short shoot phenotype and elevated response to exogenous ethylene. OsEBP89, an ethylene responsive element binding protein (EREBP) and OsACO1, an ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) oxidase gene were enhanced in the OsEIL1 overexpressing transgenic plants. These results indicate that OsEIL1 is involved in ethylene signal transduction pathway and acts as a positive regulator of ethylene response in rice.
Plant Cell Physiol-1996-Mekhedov-531-7.pdf	Submergence enhances expression of a gene encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase in deepwater rice	1996	Plant Cell Physiol	MSU-DOE Plant Research Laboratory, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824-1312, USA.	Partial submergence greatly stimulates internodal growth in deep water rice (Oryza sativa L.). Previous work has shown that the effect of submergence is, at least in part, mediated by ethylene, which accumulates in the air spaces of submerged internodes. To investigate the expression of the genes encoding ethylene biosynthetic enzymes during accelerated growth of deep water rice, we cloned a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) oxidase cDNA (OS-ACO1) from internodes of submerged plants and measured the activity of the enzyme in tissue extracts with an improved assay. We found an increase in ACC oxidase mRNA levels and enzyme activity after 4 to 24 h of submergence. Thus, it is likely that ethylene biosynthesis in internodes of deep water rice is controlled, at least in part, at the level of ACC oxidase.
Plant Cell Physiol-2004-Jun-281-9.pdf	OsEIN2 is a positive component in ethylene signaling in rice	2004	Plant and Cell Physiology	National Research Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics, Division of Molecular and Life Sciences, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, 790-784 Korea.	EIN2 is a central signal transducer in the ethylene-signaling pathway, and a unique membrane-anchored protein. By screening a cDNA library, we have isolated a cDNA clone (OsEIN2) that encodes the rice EIN2 homolog. The full-length ORF clone was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. OsEIN2 shares significant amino acid sequence similarity with Arabidopsis EIN2 (57% similarity and 42% identity). Both the numbers and positions of introns and exons in the OsEIN2 and AtEIN2 coding regions are also conserved. To address whether this structural similarity is indicative of functional conservation of the corresponding proteins, we also generated transgenic lines expressing the antisense construct of OsEIN2. Those plants were stunted and shoot elongation was severely inhibited. Their phenotypes were similar to that found with wild-type rice seedlings that were treated with AgNO3, an ethylene signal inhibitor. In the OsEIN2 antisense plants, the expression levels of two ethylene-responsive genes, SC129 and SC255, were decreased compared with the wild types. These results suggest that OsEIN2 is a positive component of the ethylene-signaling pathway in rice, just as AtEIN2 is in Arabidopsis. Our antisense transgenic plants produced approximately 3.5 times more ethylene than the wild-type plants. Expression analysis of rice ACS and ACO genes showed that the transcript levels of OsACS1 and OsACS1 were elevated in the transgenic plants.
NA	Identification and analysis of the mechanism underlying heat-inducible expression of rice aconitase 1.	2015	Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Rice Genetic Breeding of Anhui Province, Rice Research Institute, Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hefei 230031, China; Institute of Technical Biology and Agriculture Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China.	Respiratory metabolism is an important though poorly understood facet of plant adaptation to stress. Posttranslational modification of aconitase, a component of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), may be involved in stress tolerance. However, such stress-related transcriptional regulation and its mechanism remain unknown. In this study, we found that expression of the rice Aconitase gene OsACO1 is induced in a time-dependent manner by heat but not other typical abiotic stresses. To analyze the transcriptional regulation mechanism underlying the response to heat, the OsACO1 promoter (POsACO1) was isolated and characterized in transgenic rice. Using qualitative and quantitative analyses, we found that the expression of the GUS reporter gene responded to heat in different tissues and at different stages of development when driven by POsACO1. A series of 5' distal deletions of POsACO1 was generated to delineate the region responsible for heat-induced gene expression. Transient expression analyses in tobacco leaves identified a 322-bp minimal region between -1386 and -1065 as being essential and sufficient for heat-induced expression by POsACO1. We screened for known heat response-related cis-elements in this 322-bp region; however, sequences correlating with heat-induced gene expression were not identified in POsACO1. Therefore, truncations and successive mutagenesis analyses were performed in this 322-bp region. By comparing the activities of promoter fragments and their derivatives, our results indicated that the heat response element resided in a 9-bp region between -1132 and -1124, a sequence that contains a W-box motif. Additional site-directed mutagenesis analyses eliminated the heat response activity of POsACO1 via the W-box element, and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) indicated the binding of POsACO1 by factors in the nuclear extracts of heat-stressed rice seedlings in a W-box-dependent manner. Our results illustrate the expression pattern of a key component of the TCA response to abiotic stress and establish a putative regulatory pathway in the transcriptional modulation of rice respiratory metabolism genes in response to heat.
