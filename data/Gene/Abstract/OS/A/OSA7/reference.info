NA	Oryza sativa H+-ATPase (OSA) is Involved in the Regulation of Dumbbell-Shaped Guard Cells of Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	Division of Biological Science, Graduate School of Science, Nagoya University, Nagoya, 464-8602 Japan.	The stomatal apparatus consists of a pair of guard cells and regulates gas exchange between the leaf and atmosphere. In guard cells, blue light (BL) activates H(+)-ATPase in the plasma membrane through the phosphorylation of its penultimate threonine, mediating stomatal opening. Although this regulation is thought to be widely adopted among kidney-shaped guard cells in dicots, the molecular basis underlying that of dumbbell-shaped guard cells in monocots remains unclear. Here, we show that H(+)-ATPases are involved in the regulation of dumbbell-shaped guard cells. Stomatal opening of rice was promoted by the H(+)-ATPase activator fusicoccin and by BL, and the latter was suppressed by the H(+)-ATPase inhibitor vanadate. Using H(+)-ATPase antibodies, we showed the presence of phosphoregulation of the penultimate threonine in Oryza sativa H(+)-ATPases (OSAs) and localization of OSAs in the plasma membrane of guard cells. Interestingly, we identified one H(+)-ATPase isoform, OSA7, that is preferentially expressed among the OSA genes in guard cells, and found that loss of function of OSA7 resulted in partial insensitivity to BL. We conclude that H(+)-ATPase is involved in BL-induced stomatal opening of dumbbell-shaped guard cells in monocotyledon species.
NA	Isoforms of plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase in rice root and shoot are differentially induced by starvation and resupply of NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª or NH‚Ç<U+383C><U+3E34>+.	2010	Plant Sci	Departamento de Solos, Instituto de Agronomia, Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro, Rodovia BR 465 km 7 Serop√©dica, RJ 23890-000, Brazil. marcusloss@gmail.com	The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of nitrogen starvation and resupply in 10 PM H+-ATPase isoforms and the expression of NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª and NH‚Ç<U+383C><U+3E34>+ transporters in rice. The net uptake of both forms of NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª-N or NH‚Ç<U+383C><U+3E34>+-N was increased with its resupply. Resupply of NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª resulted in induction of the following PM H+-ATPase isoforms, OsA1, OsA2, OsA5 and OsA7 in the shoots and OsA2, OsA5, OsA7 and OsA8 in the roots. Resupply of NH‚Ç<U+383C><U+3E34>+ resulted in the induction of the following OsA1, OsA3 and OsA7 isoforms in the roots while OsA1 was induced in the shoots. It was observed that increased PM H+-ATPase activity also resulted in increased net uptake of NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª and NH‚Ç<U+383C><U+3E34>+. In the roots, OsNRT2.1 and OsNRT2.2 were induced by NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª resupply, while OsAMT1.1 and OsAMT1.2 were induced by NH‚Ç<U+383C><U+3E34>+ deficiency. The results showed that the expression of PM H+-ATPase isoforms is related to NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª and NH‚Ç<U+383C><U+3E34>+ transporters as well as in which section of the plant it takes place. PM H+-ATPase isoforms OsA2 and OsA7 displayed the strongest induction in response to N resupply, therefore indicating that these genes could be involved in N uptake in rice.
NA	LMPA Regulates Lesion Mimic Leaf and Panicle Development Through ROS-Induced PCD in Rice.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, China.	Leaf and panicle are important nutrient and yield organs in rice, respectively. Although several genes controlling lesion mimic leaf and panicle abortion have been identified, a few studies have reported the involvement of a single gene in the production of both the traits. In this study, we characterized a panicle abortion mutant, lesion mimic leaf and panicle apical abortion (lmpa), which exhibits lesions on the leaf and causes degeneration of apical spikelets. Molecular cloning revealed that LMPA encodes a proton pump ATPase protein that is localized in the plasma membrane and is highly expressed in leaves and panicles. The analysis of promoter activity showed that the insertion of a fragment in the promoter of lmpa caused a decrease in the transcription level. Cellular and histochemistry analysis indicated that the ROS accumulated and cell death occurred in lmpa. Moreover, physiological experiments revealed that lmpa was more sensitive to high temperatures and salt stress conditions. These results provide a better understanding of the role of LMPA in panicle development and lesion mimic formation by regulating ROS homeostasis.
