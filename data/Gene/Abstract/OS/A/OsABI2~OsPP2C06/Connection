OsABI2|OsPP2C06|OsABIL1	OsNAP	The NAC family transcription factor OsNAP confers abiotic stress response through the ABA pathway	Microarray analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsNAP revealed that many stress-related genes were up-regulated, including OsPP2C06/OsABI2, OsPP2C09, OsPP2C68 and OsSalT, and some genes coding for stress-related transcription factors (OsDREB1A, OsMYB2, OsAP37 and OsAP59)
OsABI2|OsPP2C06|OsABIL1	OsSIPP2C1|OsPP2C68|OsPP108	The NAC family transcription factor OsNAP confers abiotic stress response through the ABA pathway	Microarray analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsNAP revealed that many stress-related genes were up-regulated, including OsPP2C06/OsABI2, OsPP2C09, OsPP2C68 and OsSalT, and some genes coding for stress-related transcription factors (OsDREB1A, OsMYB2, OsAP37 and OsAP59)
