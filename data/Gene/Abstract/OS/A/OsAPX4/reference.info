NA	Rice peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase knockdown affects ROS signaling and triggers early leaf senescence	2017	Plant Science	Programa de P√≥s-Gradua√ß√£o em Biologia Celular e Molecular, Centro de Biotecnologia, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil	H2O2, which is continually produced by aerobic metabolism, is a cytotoxic molecule when in high levels. However, low levels can act as a signaling molecule able to regulate the expression of stress responses, senescence, programmed cell death, plant growth, and development. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) enzyme plays an essential role in the control of intracellular H2O2 levels. Here, the function of a gene encoding a peroxisomal APX (OsAPX4) from rice (Oryza sativa L.) was studied. OsAPX4 gene expression can be detected in roots and panicles, but the highest expression level occurs in leaves. Silencing of OsAPX4 and OsAPX3 expression in RNAiOsAPX4 did not affect the growth of plants under growth chamber conditions, but aging transgenic plants interestingly displayed an early senescence phenotype. Leaf fragments from silenced plants were also more sensitive to induced senescence conditions. RNAiOsAPX4 plants did not present detectable changes in intracellular H2O2 levels, but biochemical analyses showed that transgenic plants displayed some decreased APX activity in the chloroplastic fraction. Also, the peroxisomal enzyme glycolate oxidase exhibited lower activity, whereas catalase activity was similar to non-transformed rice. The results imply that OsAPX4 gene has an important role in leaf senescence pathway mediated by ROS signaling.
NA	Impairment of peroxisomal APX and CAT activities increases protection of photosynthesis.	2018	J Exp Bot	Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Federal University of Cear®¢, Fortaleza, Cear®¢, Brazil.	Retrograde signalling pathways, triggered by changes in cellular redox homeostasis, remain poorly understood. Transformed rice plants that are deficient in peroxisomal APX4 (RNAiOsAPX4) exhibit more effective protection of photosynthesis than controls when catalase (CAT) is inhibited, but the mechanisms involved have not been characterised. An in-depth physiological and proteomics analysis was therefore performed on the RNAiOsAPX4-CAT-inhibited rice plants. Loss of APX4 function led to an increased abundance of several proteins that are involved in essential metabolic pathways, possibly as a result of increased tissue H2O2 levels. The higher photosynthetic activities measured in the RNAiOsAPX4 plants under CAT inhibition was accompanied by higher levels of Rubisco, a higher Vcmax and increased photochemical efficiencies, together with large increases in photosynthesis-related proteins. Large increases in the levels of proteins involved in the ascorbate/glutathione cycle and other antioxidant-related pathways were observed and these changes may be important in the protection of photosynthesis in the RNAiOsAPX4 plants. Large increases in the abundance of proteins localised in the nuclei and mitochondria were also observed, together with increased levels of proteins involved in important cellular pathways, particularly protein translation. Taken together, the results show that RNAiOsAPX4 plants exhibit significant metabolic reprogramming, which incorporate a more effective antioxidant response to protect photosynthesis under conditions of impaired CAT activity.
