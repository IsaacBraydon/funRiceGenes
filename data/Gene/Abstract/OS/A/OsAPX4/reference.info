NA	Rice peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase knockdown affects ROS signaling and triggers early leaf senescence	2017	Plant Science	Programa de Pós-Graduação em Biologia Celular e Molecular, Centro de Biotecnologia, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil	H2O2, which is continually produced by aerobic metabolism, is a cytotoxic molecule when in high levels. However, low levels can act as a signaling molecule able to regulate the expression of stress responses, senescence, programmed cell death, plant growth, and development. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) enzyme plays an essential role in the control of intracellular H2O2 levels. Here, the function of a gene encoding a peroxisomal APX (OsAPX4) from rice (Oryza sativa L.) was studied. OsAPX4 gene expression can be detected in roots and panicles, but the highest expression level occurs in leaves. Silencing of OsAPX4 and OsAPX3 expression in RNAiOsAPX4 did not affect the growth of plants under growth chamber conditions, but aging transgenic plants interestingly displayed an early senescence phenotype. Leaf fragments from silenced plants were also more sensitive to induced senescence conditions. RNAiOsAPX4 plants did not present detectable changes in intracellular H2O2 levels, but biochemical analyses showed that transgenic plants displayed some decreased APX activity in the chloroplastic fraction. Also, the peroxisomal enzyme glycolate oxidase exhibited lower activity, whereas catalase activity was similar to non-transformed rice. The results imply that OsAPX4 gene has an important role in leaf senescence pathway mediated by ROS signaling.
