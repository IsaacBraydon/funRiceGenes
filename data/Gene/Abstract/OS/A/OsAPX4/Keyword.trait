OsAPX4	leaf	Rice peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase knockdown affects ROS signaling and triggers early leaf senescence	 The results imply that OsAPX4 gene has an important role in leaf senescence pathway mediated by ROS signaling
OsAPX4	leaf senescence	Rice peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase knockdown affects ROS signaling and triggers early leaf senescence	 The results imply that OsAPX4 gene has an important role in leaf senescence pathway mediated by ROS signaling
OsAPX4	senescence	Rice peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase knockdown affects ROS signaling and triggers early leaf senescence	 Silencing of OsAPX4 and OsAPX3 expression in RNAiOsAPX4 did not affect the growth of plants under growth chamber conditions, but aging transgenic plants interestingly displayed an early senescence phenotype
