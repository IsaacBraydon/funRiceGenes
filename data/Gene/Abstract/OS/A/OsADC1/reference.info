The isolated full-length cDNA (OsADC1) contains an insert consisting of 2451 bp. The longest open reading frame within encodes a putative protein of 702 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 74 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.9. ClustalW alignment revealed that the deduced OsADC1 protein sequence shares overall 60% and 61% identity at the amino acid level with the Pisum sativum and Glycine max ADC proteins, respectively. Additionally, several OsADC1 regions exhibited striking similarity with these two other plant ADC protein sequences, including motifs characteristic of ADC proteins. Further, RNA gel blot analysis revealed markedly increased OsADC1 mRNA levels in rice seedling leaves subjected to chilling stress. Interestingly, this treatment induced a concomitant increase in free Put levels in these samples, coincident with the observed elevated OsADC1 mRNA levels. To our knowledge, this represents the first direct evidence supporting essentially chilling-specific regulation of a rice ADC gene that also potentially influences Put accumulation, a phenomenon previously noted in cold-stressed rice seedlings.
1-s2.0-S0981942810000203-main.pdf	Transcriptional regulation of the rice arginine decarboxylase (Adc1) and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (Samdc) genes by methyl jasmonate	2010	Plant Physiol Biochem	Departament de Produccio Vegetal i Ciencia Forestal, ETSEA, Universitat de Lleida, Av. Alcalde Rovira Roure 191, E-25198 Lleida, Spain.	We investigated the effect of methyl jasmonate (MeJa) treatment on the expression of two genes in the rice polyamine biosynthesis pathway and on the polyamine content in wild type plants and transgenic rice plants expressing a Datura stramonium (Ds) Adc cDNA, the latter accumulating up to three-fold the normal level of putrescine. Exogenous MeJa transiently inhibited the expression of OsAdc1, OsSamdc and Spermidine synthase (OsSpds) genes in the polyamine biosynthesis pathway, probably through transcriptional repression. There was also a similar negative impact on the DsAdc transgene in transgenic plants, even though a constitutive promoter was used to drive transgene expression. The free putrescine content was reduced significantly in the leaves of both wild type and transgenic plants in response to MeJa, although the magnitude of the effect was greater in wild type plants. We discuss our findings with respect to the previously proposed threshold model of polyamine metabolism in plants subjected to abiotic stress.
