In our search to identify gene(s) involved in the rice self-defense responses, we cloned a novel rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) gene, OsATX, a single copy gene, from the JA treated rice seedling leaves cDNA library. This gene encodes a 69 amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 7649.7 and a pI of 5.6. OsATX was responsive to cutting (wounding by cutting the excised leaf), over its weak constitutive expression in the healthy leaves. The critical signalling molecules, jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and hydrogen peroxide, together with protein phosphatase inhibitors, effectively up-regulated the OsATX expression with time, over the excised leaf cut control, whereas ethylene had no affect. Furthermore, copper, a heavy metal, also up-regulated OsATX expression. Moreover, induced expression of OsATX mRNA was influenced by light signal(s), and showed a requirement for de novo synthesized protein factors. Additionally, co-application of either JA or ABA with SA drastically suppressed the induced OsATX mRNA level. Finally, the blast pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea, triggered OsATX mRNA accumulation. These results strongly suggest a function/role(s) for OsATX in defense/stress responses in rice.
