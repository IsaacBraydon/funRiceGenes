OsATX	seedling	Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways	 Nipponbare) gene, OsATX, a single copy gene, from the JA treated rice seedling leaves cDNA library
OsATX	 ABA 	Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways	 Additionally, co-application of either JA or ABA with SA drastically suppressed the induced OsATX mRNA level
OsATX	 sa 	Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways	 Additionally, co-application of either JA or ABA with SA drastically suppressed the induced OsATX mRNA level
OsATX	leaf	Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways	 OsATX was responsive to cutting (wounding by cutting the excised leaf), over its weak constitutive expression in the healthy leaves| The critical signalling molecules, jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and hydrogen peroxide, together with protein phosphatase inhibitors, effectively up-regulated the OsATX expression with time, over the excised leaf cut control, whereas ethylene had no affect
OsATX	blast	Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways	 Finally, the blast pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea, triggered OsATX mRNA accumulation
OsATX	jasmonic acid	Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways	 The critical signalling molecules, jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and hydrogen peroxide, together with protein phosphatase inhibitors, effectively up-regulated the OsATX expression with time, over the excised leaf cut control, whereas ethylene had no affect
OsATX	salicylic acid	Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways	 The critical signalling molecules, jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and hydrogen peroxide, together with protein phosphatase inhibitors, effectively up-regulated the OsATX expression with time, over the excised leaf cut control, whereas ethylene had no affect
OsATX	ethylene	Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways	 The critical signalling molecules, jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and hydrogen peroxide, together with protein phosphatase inhibitors, effectively up-regulated the OsATX expression with time, over the excised leaf cut control, whereas ethylene had no affect
OsATX	defense	Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways	 These results strongly suggest a function/role(s) for OsATX in defense/stress responses in rice
OsATX	jasmonic	Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways	 The critical signalling molecules, jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and hydrogen peroxide, together with protein phosphatase inhibitors, effectively up-regulated the OsATX expression with time, over the excised leaf cut control, whereas ethylene had no affect
