OsANN10	oxidative	A calcium-dependent lipid binding protein, OsANN10, is a negative regulator of osmotic stress tolerance in rice.	 Knocking down OsANN10 significantly decreased the content of H2O2 by increasing Peroxidase (POD) and Catalase (CAT) activities, further reducing oxidative damage in rice leaves, suggesting a negative regulation of OsANN10 in protecting cell membrane against oxidative damage via scavenging ROS under osmotic stress
