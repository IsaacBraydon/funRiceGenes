outhkj.pdf	Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice	2007	Plant Mol Biol	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. morimasa@nias.affrc.go.jp	A lesion mimic mutant that we designated Spotted leaf 18 (Spl18) was isolated from 13,000 activation-tagging lines of rice produced by our modified activation-tagging vector and further characterized. Spl18 was dominant and its phenotype was linked to the T-DNA insertion. An ORF was located about 500 bp downstream of the inserted T-DNA, and the deduced protein, designated OsAT1, showed sequence similarity to an acyltransferase whose expression is induced by hypersensitive reaction in tobacco. The transcriptional level of OsAT1 was very low in the WT leaf blade but high in Spl18 leaf blade. In wild-type rice, OsAT1 was transcribed mainly in the young panicle, in the panicle just after heading, and in the leaf sheath. In addition, transcription of the genes for PR protein was upregulated in Spl18, accumulation of phytoalexins (both momilactone A and sakuranetin) was increased, and resistance to blast disease was improved. We then combined OsAT1 genomic DNA downstream of the modified 35S promoter and re-transformed it into rice. Lesion mimic and blast resistance phenotypes were detected in the transgenic lines produced, clearly indicating that overexpression of OsAT1 caused the Spl18 phenotypes. In addition, plants overexpressing OsAT1 showed resistance to bacterial blight.
NA	OsAT1, an anion transporter, negatively regulates grain size and yield in rice.	2022	Physiol Plant	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.	Improving the grain yield of rice is a central goal of basic and applied scientific research. Here, we identified an anion transporter, OsAT1, localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. OsAT1 is highly expressed in flag, stem, and sheath as monitored using qRT-PCR and pOsAT1::GUS. Thousand-grain weight, grain weight per plant, and content of starch were significantly increased in OsAT1 knock-down mutants (OsAT1-Ri) but significantly decreased in OsAT1 overexpressed lines (OsAT1-OE). In addition, the grain weight per plant increased by 6.17% to 6.78% in OsAT1-RNAi lines, whereas it decreased by 45.93% to 46.76% in OsAT1-OE lines, compared to wild-type. Moreover, the copper content was noticeably reduced in flag leaf of OsAT1-Ri lines and increased in OsAT1-OE lines. RNA-sequencing analysis of OsAT1-OE lines revealed that the genes related to starch biosynthesis and metabolism pathway were enriched in the down-regulated category. Thus, our results suggest that knock-down of OsAT1 in rice possibly reduces copper accumulation and improves the accumulation of storage starch, hence, increasing the grain size and weight. OsAT1 may be a useful gene to consider for cereal breeding programs.
