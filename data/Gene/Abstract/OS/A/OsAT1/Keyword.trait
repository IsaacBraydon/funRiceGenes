OsAT1	blast resistance	Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice	 Lesion mimic and blast resistance phenotypes were detected in the transgenic lines produced, clearly indicating that overexpression of OsAT1 caused the Spl18 phenotypes
OsAT1	blight	Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice	 In addition, plants overexpressing OsAT1 showed resistance to bacterial blight
OsAT1	leaf	Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice	 The transcriptional level of OsAT1 was very low in the WT leaf blade but high in Spl18 leaf blade| In wild-type rice, OsAT1 was transcribed mainly in the young panicle, in the panicle just after heading, and in the leaf sheath
OsAT1	panicle	Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice	 In wild-type rice, OsAT1 was transcribed mainly in the young panicle, in the panicle just after heading, and in the leaf sheath
OsAT1	bacterial blight	Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice	 In addition, plants overexpressing OsAT1 showed resistance to bacterial blight
OsAT1	blast	Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice	 Lesion mimic and blast resistance phenotypes were detected in the transgenic lines produced, clearly indicating that overexpression of OsAT1 caused the Spl18 phenotypes
OsAT1	sheath	Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice	 In wild-type rice, OsAT1 was transcribed mainly in the young panicle, in the panicle just after heading, and in the leaf sheath
