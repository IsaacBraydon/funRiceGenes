OsAT1	blast resistance	Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice	Lesion mimic and blast resistance phenotypes were detected in the transgenic lines produced, clearly indicating that overexpression of OsAT1 caused the Spl18 phenotypes
OsAT1	blight	Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice	In addition, plants overexpressing OsAT1 showed resistance to bacterial blight
OsAT1	leaf	Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice	The transcriptional level of OsAT1 was very low in the WT leaf blade but high in Spl18 leaf blade
OsAT1	leaf	Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice	In wild-type rice, OsAT1 was transcribed mainly in the young panicle, in the panicle just after heading, and in the leaf sheath
OsAT1	panicle	Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice	In wild-type rice, OsAT1 was transcribed mainly in the young panicle, in the panicle just after heading, and in the leaf sheath
OsAT1	bacterial blight	Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice	In addition, plants overexpressing OsAT1 showed resistance to bacterial blight
OsAT1	blast	Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice	Lesion mimic and blast resistance phenotypes were detected in the transgenic lines produced, clearly indicating that overexpression of OsAT1 caused the Spl18 phenotypes
OsAT1	sheath	Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice	In wild-type rice, OsAT1 was transcribed mainly in the young panicle, in the panicle just after heading, and in the leaf sheath
OsAT1	grain	OsAT1, an anion transporter, negatively regulates grain size and yield in rice.	 Thousand-grain weight, grain weight per plant, and content of starch were significantly increased in OsAT1 knock-down mutants (OsAT1-Ri) but significantly decreased in OsAT1 overexpressed lines (OsAT1-OE)
OsAT1	grain	OsAT1, an anion transporter, negatively regulates grain size and yield in rice.	 Thus, our results suggest that knock-down of OsAT1 in rice possibly reduces copper accumulation and improves the accumulation of storage starch, hence, increasing the grain size and weight
OsAT1	grain size	OsAT1, an anion transporter, negatively regulates grain size and yield in rice.	 Thus, our results suggest that knock-down of OsAT1 in rice possibly reduces copper accumulation and improves the accumulation of storage starch, hence, increasing the grain size and weight
OsAT1	starch	OsAT1, an anion transporter, negatively regulates grain size and yield in rice.	 Thousand-grain weight, grain weight per plant, and content of starch were significantly increased in OsAT1 knock-down mutants (OsAT1-Ri) but significantly decreased in OsAT1 overexpressed lines (OsAT1-OE)
OsAT1	sheath	OsAT1, an anion transporter, negatively regulates grain size and yield in rice.	 OsAT1 is highly expressed in flag, stem, and sheath as monitored using qRT-PCR and pOsAT1::GUS
OsAT1	breeding	OsAT1, an anion transporter, negatively regulates grain size and yield in rice.	 OsAT1 may be a useful gene to consider for cereal breeding programs
OsAT1	grain weight	OsAT1, an anion transporter, negatively regulates grain size and yield in rice.	 Thousand-grain weight, grain weight per plant, and content of starch were significantly increased in OsAT1 knock-down mutants (OsAT1-Ri) but significantly decreased in OsAT1 overexpressed lines (OsAT1-OE)
OsAT1	copper accumulation	OsAT1, an anion transporter, negatively regulates grain size and yield in rice.	 Thus, our results suggest that knock-down of OsAT1 in rice possibly reduces copper accumulation and improves the accumulation of storage starch, hence, increasing the grain size and weight
OsAT1	copper	OsAT1, an anion transporter, negatively regulates grain size and yield in rice.	 Thus, our results suggest that knock-down of OsAT1 in rice possibly reduces copper accumulation and improves the accumulation of storage starch, hence, increasing the grain size and weight
