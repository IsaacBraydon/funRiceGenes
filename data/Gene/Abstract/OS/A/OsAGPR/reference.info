N-Acetyl-gamma-glutamyl-phosphate reductase (AGPR) catalyzes the third step in an eight-step arginine-biosynthetic pathway that starts with glutamate. This enzyme converts N-acetyl-gamma-glutamyl phosphate to N-acetylglutamate-gamma-semialdehyde by an NADPH-dependent reductive dephosphorylation. AGPR from Oryza sativa (OsAGPR) was expressed in Escherichia coli at 291 K as a soluble fusion protein with an upstream thioredoxin-hexahistidine [Trx-(His)6] extension. OsAGPR(Ala50-Pro366) was purified and crystals were obtained using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method at 293 K and diffract X-rays to at least 1.8 A resolution. They belong to the hexagonal space group P6(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 86.11, c = 316.3 A.
