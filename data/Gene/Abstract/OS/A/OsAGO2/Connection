BG3|OsPUP4	OsAGO2	ARGONAUTE2 Enhances Grain Length and Salt Tolerance by Activating BIG GRAIN3 to Modulate Cytokinin Distribution in Rice.	ARGONAUTE2 Enhances Grain Length and Salt Tolerance by Activating BIG GRAIN3 to Modulate Cytokinin Distribution in Rice.
BG3|OsPUP4	OsAGO2	ARGONAUTE2 Enhances Grain Length and Salt Tolerance by Activating BIG GRAIN3 to Modulate Cytokinin Distribution in Rice.	AGO2 can  become enriched on the BG3 locus and alter its histone methylation level, thus promoting BG3 expression.
OsAGO2	OsPRMT5	An OsPRMT5-OsAGO2/miR1875-OsHXK1 module regulates rice immunity to blast disease.	 OsAGO2 itself is delicately regulated by OsPRMT5, which senses M
miR1875	OsAGO2	An OsPRMT5-OsAGO2/miR1875-OsHXK1 module regulates rice immunity to blast disease.	 OsAGO2 associates with the 24-nt miR1875 and binds to the promoter region of HEXOKINASE1 (OsHXK1), which causes DNA methylation and leads to gene silencing
