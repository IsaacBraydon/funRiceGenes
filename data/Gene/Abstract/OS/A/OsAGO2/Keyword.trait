OsAGO2	pollen	OsAGO2 controls ROS production and the initiation of tapetal PCD by epigenetically regulating OsHXK1 expression in rice anthers.	 Knockdown of OsAGO2 led to the overaccumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and abnormal anther development, causing premature initiation of tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) and pollen abortion
OsAGO2	pollen	OsAGO2 controls ROS production and the initiation of tapetal PCD by epigenetically regulating OsHXK1 expression in rice anthers.	 Moreover, knockdown of OsHXK1 restored pollen fertility in OsAGO2 knockdown plants
OsAGO2	anther	OsAGO2 controls ROS production and the initiation of tapetal PCD by epigenetically regulating OsHXK1 expression in rice anthers.	 Here, we show that the AGO protein OsAGO2 regulates anther development in rice
