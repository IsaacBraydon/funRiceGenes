Symbol	Expression
OsAGO2	OsAGO2 controls ROS production and the initiation of tapetal PCD by epigenetically regulating OsHXK1 expression in rice anthers. |  The expression level of Hexokinase 1 (OsHXK1) increased significantly, and the methylation levels of its promoter decreased, in plants with knocked-down OsAGO2 expression
OsAGO2	 oryzae infection, the reduced OsAGO2/miR1875 led to a relatively activated OsHXK1 expression
