OsAAP5	leaf	The amino acid permease OsAAP5 regulates tiller number and grain yield in rice.	 Lower expression of OsAAP5 in the young leaf blade in indica varieties than in japonica varieties was associated with more tillers in indica than in japonica
OsAAP5	grain	The amino acid permease OsAAP5 regulates tiller number and grain yield in rice.	The amino acid permease OsAAP5 regulates tiller number and grain yield in rice.
OsAAP5	grain	The amino acid permease OsAAP5 regulates tiller number and grain yield in rice.	 Downregulation of OsAAP5 expression in japonica using RNA interference (Ri) and CRISPR led to increases in tiller number and grain yield, while OsAAP5 overexpression (OE) had the opposite effect
OsAAP5	grain	The amino acid permease OsAAP5 regulates tiller number and grain yield in rice.	 Thus, OsAAP5 could regulate tiller bud outgrowth by affecting cytokinin levels, and knockout of OsAAP5 could be valuable for japonica breeding programs seeking high yield and grain quality
OsAAP5	tiller	The amino acid permease OsAAP5 regulates tiller number and grain yield in rice.	The amino acid permease OsAAP5 regulates tiller number and grain yield in rice.
