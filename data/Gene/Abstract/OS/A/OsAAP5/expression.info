OsAAP5	 Lower expression of OsAAP5 in the young leaf blade in indica varieties than in japonica varieties was associated with more tillers in indica than in japonica |  Downregulation of OsAAP5 expression in japonica using RNA interference (Ri) and CRISPR led to increases in tiller number and grain yield, while OsAAP5 overexpression (OE) had the opposite effect	 Downregulation of OsAAP5 expression in japonica using RNA interference (Ri) and CRISPR led to increases in tiller number and grain yield, while OsAAP5 overexpression (OE) had the opposite effect
