OsACR9	leaf	Cellular distribution of ACT domain repeat protein 9, a nuclear localizing protein, in rice (Oryza sativa)	In rice leaf samples, OsACR9 protein was abundant in the vascular parenchyma and mestome-sheath cells of young leaf blades at the early stage of development and in the vascular parenchyma and phloem-companion cells of mature leaf sheaths
OsACR9	vascular bundle	Cellular distribution of ACT domain repeat protein 9, a nuclear localizing protein, in rice (Oryza sativa)	OsACR9 protein also showed a high level of accumulation in vascular parenchyma cells of dorsal vascular bundles and aleurone cells in young rice grains at the early stage of ripening
OsACR9	root	Cellular distribution of ACT domain repeat protein 9, a nuclear localizing protein, in rice (Oryza sativa)	In rice roots, OsACR9 protein was distributed in epidermis, exodermis, sclerenchyma and vascular parenchyma cells, and its accumulation markedly increased after supply of NH(+)(4)
OsACR9	grain	Cellular distribution of ACT domain repeat protein 9, a nuclear localizing protein, in rice (Oryza sativa)	OsACR9 protein also showed a high level of accumulation in vascular parenchyma cells of dorsal vascular bundles and aleurone cells in young rice grains at the early stage of ripening
OsACR9	nitrogen	Cellular distribution of ACT domain repeat protein 9, a nuclear localizing protein, in rice (Oryza sativa)	In the current study, to evaluate the possible involvement of the protein OsACR9 in the Gln-sensing system related to nitrogen (N) metabolism in rice (Oryza sativa L
OsACR9	sheath	Cellular distribution of ACT domain repeat protein 9, a nuclear localizing protein, in rice (Oryza sativa)	In rice leaf samples, OsACR9 protein was abundant in the vascular parenchyma and mestome-sheath cells of young leaf blades at the early stage of development and in the vascular parenchyma and phloem-companion cells of mature leaf sheaths
