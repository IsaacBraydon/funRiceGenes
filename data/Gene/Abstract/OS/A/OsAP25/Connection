OsAP25	OsAP37	EAT1 promotes tapetal cell death by regulating aspartic proteases during male reproductive development in rice	ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 directly regulates the expression of OsAP25 and OsAP37, which encode aspartic proteases that induce programmed cell death in both yeast and plants
OsAP25	OsGRDP1	A Novel Glycine-Rich Domain Protein, OsGRDP1, Functions as a Critical Feedback Regulator for Controlling Cell Death and Disease Resistance in Rice	 OsGRDP1 interacted with an aspartic proteinase OsAP25
