OsAP25	OsAP37	EAT1 promotes tapetal cell death by regulating aspartic proteases during male reproductive development in rice	ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 directly regulates the expression of OsAP25 and OsAP37, which encode aspartic proteases that induce programmed cell death in both yeast and plants
OsAP25	OsGRDP1|LSL1	A Novel Glycine-Rich Domain Protein, OsGRDP1, Functions as a Critical Feedback Regulator for Controlling Cell Death and Disease Resistance in Rice	 OsGRDP1 interacted with an aspartic proteinase OsAP25
OsAP25	OsEDM2L	OsEDM2L mediates m 6 A of EAT1 transcript for proper alternative splicing and polyadenylation regulating rice tapetal degradation	 Mutation of OsEDM2L altered the transcriptomic m6 A landscape, and caused a distinct m6 A modification of the EAT1 transcript leading to dysregulation of its alternative splicing and polyadenylation, followed by suppression of the EAT1 target genes OsAP25 and OsAP37 for tapetal PCD
