To unravel the mechanisms of K+ uptake and its sensitivity to salt stress in the model plant rice, we isolated and functionally characterized OsAKT1, a potassium channel homologous to the Arabidopsis root inward rectifier AKT1. OsAKT1 transcripts were predominantly found in the coleoptile and in the roots of young rice seedlings. K+ channel mRNA decreases in response to salt stress, both in the shoot and in the root of 4-day-old rice seedlings. Following expression in HEK293 cells, we were able to characterize OsAKT1 as a voltage-dependent, inward-rectifying K+ channel regulated by extracellular Ca2+ and protons. Patch-clamp studies on rice root protoplasts identified a K+ inward rectifier with similar channel properties as heterologously expressed OsAKT1. In line with the transcriptional downregulation of OsAKT1 in response to salt stress, inward K+ currents were significantly reduced in root protoplasts. Thus, OsAKT1 seems to represent the dominant salt-sensitive K+ uptake channel in rice roots.
NA	The Os-AKT1 Channel Is Critical for K+ Uptake in Rice Roots and Is Modulated by the Rice CBL1-CIPK23 Complex	2014	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Biological Sciences, National Plant Gene Research Centre (Beijing), China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.	Potassium (K+) is one of the essential nutrient elements for plant growth and development. Plants absorb K+ ions from the environment via root cell K+ channels and/or transporters. In this study, the Shaker K+ channel Os-AKT1 was characterized for its function in K+ uptake in rice (Oryza sativa) roots, and its regulation by Os-CBL1 (Calcineurin B-Like protein1) and Os-CIPK23 (CBL-Interacting Protein Kinase23) was investigated. As an inward K+ channel, Os-AKT1 could carry out K+ uptake and rescue the low-K+-sensitive phenotype of Arabidopsis thaliana akt1 mutant plants. Rice Os-akt1 mutant plants showed decreased K+ uptake and displayed an obvious low-K+-sensitive phenotype. Disruption of Os-AKT1 significantly reduced the K+ content, which resulted in inhibition of plant growth and development. Similar to the AKT1 regulation in Arabidopsis, Os-CBL1 and Os-CIPK23 were identified as the upstream regulators of Os-AKT1 in rice. The Os-CBL1-Os-CIPK23 complex could enhance Os-AKT1-mediated K+ uptake. A phenotype test confirmed that Os-CIPK23 RNAi lines exhibited similar K+-deficient symptoms as the Os-akt1 mutant under low K+ conditions. These findings demonstrate that Os-AKT1-mediated K+ uptake in rice roots is modulated by the Os-CBL1-Os-CIPK23 complex.
