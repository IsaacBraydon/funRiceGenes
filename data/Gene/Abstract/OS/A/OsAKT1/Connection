OsAKT1	OsCBL1	The Os-AKT1 Channel Is Critical for K+ Uptake in Rice Roots and Is Modulated by the Rice CBL1-CIPK23 Complex	The Os-AKT1 Channel Is Critical for K+ Uptake in Rice Roots and Is Modulated by the Rice CBL1-CIPK23 Complex
OsAKT1	OsCBL1	The Os-AKT1 Channel Is Critical for K+ Uptake in Rice Roots and Is Modulated by the Rice CBL1-CIPK23 Complex	Similar to the AKT1 regulation in Arabidopsis, Os-CBL1 and Os-CIPK23 were identified as the upstream regulators of Os-AKT1 in rice
OsAKT1	OsCBL1	The Os-AKT1 Channel Is Critical for K+ Uptake in Rice Roots and Is Modulated by the Rice CBL1-CIPK23 Complex	The Os-CBL1-Os-CIPK23 complex could enhance Os-AKT1-mediated K+ uptake.
OsAKT1	OsCBL1	The Os-AKT1 Channel Is Critical for K+ Uptake in Rice Roots and Is Modulated by the Rice CBL1-CIPK23 Complex	These findings demonstrate that Os-AKT1-mediated K+ uptake in rice roots is modulated by the Os-CBL1-Os-CIPK23 complex.

OsAKT1	OsPEX11	OsPEX11, a Peroxisomal Biogenesis Factor 11, Contributes to Salt Stress Tolerance in Oryza sativa.	Furthermore, qPCR data suggested that OsPEX11 acted as a positive regulator of salt tolerance by reinforcing the expression of several well-known rice transporters (OsHKT2;1, OsHKT1;5, OsLti6a, OsLti6b, OsSOS1, OsNHX1, and OsAKT1) involved in Na(+)/K(+) homeostasis in transgenic plants under salinity
