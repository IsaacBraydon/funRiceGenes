Asr3|OsASR3	ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities	OsASR1 and OsASR3 are the most abundant and are found in most tissues; they are enriched in the leaves and roots, respectively
Asr3|OsASR3	ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities	Coexpression analysis of OsASR1 and OsASR3 and a comparison of the cis-acting elements upstream of OsASR1 and OsASR3 suggested that their expression is regulated in common by abiotic stresses but differently regulated by hormone and sugar signals
Asr3|OsASR3	ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities	The results of quantitative real-time PCR analyses of OsASR1 and OsASR3 expression under various conditions further support this model
Asr3|OsASR3	ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities	The expression of both OsASR1 and OsASR3 was induced by drought stress, which is a major regulator of the expression of all ASR genes in rice
Asr3|OsASR3	ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities	OsASR1 transcription was highly induced by ABA, whereas OsASR3 transcription was strongly induced by GA
Asr3|OsASR3	ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities	In addition, OsASR1 and OsASR3 expression was significantly induced by sucrose and sucrose/glucose treatments, respectively
Asr3|OsASR3	ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities	Our data also showed that the overexpression of either OsASR1 or OsASR3 in transgenic rice plants increased their tolerance to drought and cold stress
Asr3|OsASR3	ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities
ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Os2H16	OsASR2 regulates the expression of a defense-related gene, Os2H16, by targeting the GT-1 cis-element.	OsASR2 regulates the expression of a defense-related gene, Os2H16, by targeting the GT-1 cis-element.
ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Os2H16	OsASR2 regulates the expression of a defense-related gene, Os2H16, by targeting the GT-1 cis-element.	 Furthermore, we identified that OsASR2 was specifically bound to GT-1 and activated the expression of the target gene Os2H16, as well as GFP driven by the chimeric promoter of 2 Ã— GT-1-35S mini construct
