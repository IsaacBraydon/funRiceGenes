Asr3|OsASR3	ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities	OsASR1 and OsASR3 are the most abundant and are found in most tissues; they are enriched in the leaves and roots, respectively
Asr3|OsASR3	ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities	Coexpression analysis of OsASR1 and OsASR3 and a comparison of the cis-acting elements upstream of OsASR1 and OsASR3 suggested that their expression is regulated in common by abiotic stresses but differently regulated by hormone and sugar signals
Asr3|OsASR3	ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities	The results of quantitative real-time PCR analyses of OsASR1 and OsASR3 expression under various conditions further support this model
Asr3|OsASR3	ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities	The expression of both OsASR1 and OsASR3 was induced by drought stress, which is a major regulator of the expression of all ASR genes in rice
Asr3|OsASR3	ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities	OsASR1 transcription was highly induced by ABA, whereas OsASR3 transcription was strongly induced by GA
Asr3|OsASR3	ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities	In addition, OsASR1 and OsASR3 expression was significantly induced by sucrose and sucrose/glucose treatments, respectively
Asr3|OsASR3	ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities	Our data also showed that the overexpression of either OsASR1 or OsASR3 in transgenic rice plants increased their tolerance to drought and cold stress
Asr3|OsASR3	ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities
ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Os2H16	OsASR2 regulates the expression of a defense-related gene, Os2H16, by targeting the GT-1 cis-element.	OsASR2 regulates the expression of a defense-related gene, Os2H16, by targeting the GT-1 cis-element.
ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	Os2H16	OsASR2 regulates the expression of a defense-related gene, Os2H16, by targeting the GT-1 cis-element.	 Furthermore, we identified that OsASR2 was specifically bound to GT-1 and activated the expression of the target gene Os2H16, as well as GFP driven by the chimeric promoter of 2 Ã— GT-1-35S mini construct
ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	OsSKL2	Regulation of Drought and Salt Tolerance by OsSKL2 and OsASR1 in Rice.	Regulation of Drought and Salt Tolerance by OsSKL2 and OsASR1 in Rice.
ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	OsSKL2	Regulation of Drought and Salt Tolerance by OsSKL2 and OsASR1 in Rice.	 Moreover, OsSKL2 was found to physically interact with OsASR1, a well-known chaperone-like protein, which also exhibited positive roles in salt and drought tolerance
ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	OsSKL2	Regulation of Drought and Salt Tolerance by OsSKL2 and OsASR1 in Rice.	 A reduction in ROS production was also observed in leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana showing transient co-expression of OsSKL2 with OsASR1
ASR5|OsAsr1|OsASR2	OsSKL2	Regulation of Drought and Salt Tolerance by OsSKL2 and OsASR1 in Rice.	 Taken together, these findings suggest that OsSKL2 together with OsASR1 act as important regulatory factors that confer salt and drought tolerance in rice via ROS scavenging
