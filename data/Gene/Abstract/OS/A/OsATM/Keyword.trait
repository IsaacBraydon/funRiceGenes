OsATM	pollen	OsATM safeguards accurate repair of meiotic double-strand breaks in rice.	 Aberrant chromosome associations and DNA fragmentations were observed after the completion of homologous pairing and synapsis in Osatm pollen mother cells (PMCs)
OsATM	meiotic	OsATM safeguards accurate repair of meiotic double-strand breaks in rice.	OsATM safeguards accurate repair of meiotic double-strand breaks in rice.
OsATM	meiotic	OsATM safeguards accurate repair of meiotic double-strand breaks in rice.	 Together, these findings suggest that OsATM plays important roles in the accurate repair of meiotic DSBs in rice
OsATM	homologous recombination	OsATM safeguards accurate repair of meiotic double-strand breaks in rice.	 Aberrant chromosome associations disappeared in Osspo11-1 Osatm-1 double mutants and more severe defects were observed in Osdmc1  Osatm, suggesting that OsATM functions downstream of OsSPO11-1-catalyzed double-strand break (DSB) formation and in parallel with OsDMC1-mediated homologous recombination
