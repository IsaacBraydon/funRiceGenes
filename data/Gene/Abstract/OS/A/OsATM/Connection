H2AX	OsATM	OsATM safeguards accurate repair of meiotic double-strand breaks in rice.	 We further demonstrated that phosphorylation of H2AX in PMCs did not depend on OsATM, in contrast to the situation in somatic cells
HEI10	OsATM	OsATM safeguards accurate repair of meiotic double-strand breaks in rice.	 Moreover, the removal of OsDMC1 from chromosomes in Osatm PMCs was delayed and the number of HEI10 foci (markers of interference-sensitive CO intermediates) decreased
OsATM	OsDMC1|DMC1B|OsDMC1B	OsATM safeguards accurate repair of meiotic double-strand breaks in rice.	 Aberrant chromosome associations disappeared in Osspo11-1 Osatm-1 double mutants and more severe defects were observed in Osdmc1  Osatm, suggesting that OsATM functions downstream of OsSPO11-1-catalyzed double-strand break (DSB) formation and in parallel with OsDMC1-mediated homologous recombination
