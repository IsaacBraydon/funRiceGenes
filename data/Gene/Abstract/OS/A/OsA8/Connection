OsA8	OsLPT1|OsPht1;6|OsPT6	Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice	Knockout of OsA8 affected the expression of several OsA genes and the high affinity phosphate transporter, OsPT6, and resulted in a higher P concentration in the roots and a lower amount of P in the shoots
OsA3	OsA8	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase OsDMI3 positively regulates saline-alkaline tolerance in rice roots	 Moreover, real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsDMI3 up-regulated the transcript levels of OsSOS1 and PM-H+-ATPase genes OsA3 and OsA8 in saline-alkaline stressed rice plants
