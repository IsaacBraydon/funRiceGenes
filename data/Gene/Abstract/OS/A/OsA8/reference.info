J. Exp. Bot.-2009-Chang-557-65.pdf	Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice	2009	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	The plasma membrane (PM) proton pump ATPases (H(+)-ATPases) are involved in almost all aspects of biology. They are plant specific and several members of this family are supposed to play a key role in nutrient acquisition. At present, only some members of this gene family in plants have been characterized. However, no nutrient uptake associated H(+)-ATPase gene in rice has been functionally analysed. It is reported here that OsA8, a typical PM H(+)-ATPases gene that was predominantly expressed in roots of rice, is down-regulated by nutrient deficiency. The Osa8 mutant had a relatively smaller size and root to shoot biomass ratio, but higher ATPase activity than its wild-type counterparts under phosphorus (P) starvation conditions. Knockout of OsA8 affected the expression of several OsA genes and the high affinity phosphate transporter, OsPT6, and resulted in a higher P concentration in the roots and a lower amount of P in the shoots. These analyses demonstrate that OsA8 not only influences the uptake of P by roots, but also the translocation of P from the roots to the shoots in rice.
NA	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase OsDMI3 positively regulates saline-alkaline tolerance in rice roots	2020	Plant Signal Behav	College of Life Sciences, National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Crop Physiology Ecology and Production Management, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University , Nanjing, China.	Soil saline-alkalization is a major environmental stress that impairs plant growth and crop productivity. Plant roots are the primary site for the perception of soil stresses; however, the regulation mechanism engaged in the saline-alkaline stress response in plant roots is not well understood. In this study, we identified how a rice Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, OsDMI3, confers saline-alkaline tolerance in rice root growth. We measured the OsDMI3 activity by an in-gel kinase assay, Na+ content by NaHCO3 treatment, and Na+ and H+ fluxes by noninvasive micro-test technology (NMT). Furthermore, a real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed to identify the genes upregulated in response to NaHCO3 treatment in rice roots. The results showed that NaHCO3 significantly increased OsDMI3 expression and activity in rice roots. This was consistent with the results of Na+ content and NMT that indicated OsDMI3 promoted root elongation under saline-alkaline stress by reducing root Na+ and H+ influx. Moreover, real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsDMI3 up-regulated the transcript levels of OsSOS1 and PM-H+-ATPase genes OsA3 and OsA8 in saline-alkaline stressed rice plants. Collectively, our results suggest that OsDMI3 could promote saline-alkaline tolerance in rice roots by modulating the Na+ and H+ influx. These findings provide an important genetic target for protection of growth in rice exposed to saline-alkaline stress.
