NA	Base editing-mediated targeted evolution of ACCase for herbicide-resistant rice mutants.	2022	J Integr Plant Biol	Shanghai Center for Plant Stress Biology and Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 201602, China.	Improved cytosine and adenine base editors and an efficient dual editor were applied in targeted evolution of ACETYL COA CARBOXYLASE in rice, resulting in the generation of dozens of herbicide-resistant mutations, at least three of which, W2125L, W2125Q and C2186H, have not been reported previously.
