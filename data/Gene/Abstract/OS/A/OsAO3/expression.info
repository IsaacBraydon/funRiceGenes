OsAO3	 OsAO3 was expressed in germinated seeds, roots, leaves, and floral organs, particularly in vascular tissues and guard cells, and its expression was significantly induced by exogenous ABA and mannitol |  Mutation and overexpression of OsAO3 decreased and increased ABA levels, respectively, in seedling shoots and roots under both normal and drought stress conditions |  Mutation and overexpression of OsAO3 increased and decreased grain yield, respectively, by affecting panicle number per plant, spikelet number per panicle, and spikelet fertility	 Mutation and overexpression of OsAO3 decreased and increased ABA levels, respectively, in seedling shoots and roots under both normal and drought stress conditions |  Mutation and overexpression of OsAO3 increased and decreased grain yield, respectively, by affecting panicle number per plant, spikelet number per panicle, and spikelet fertility
