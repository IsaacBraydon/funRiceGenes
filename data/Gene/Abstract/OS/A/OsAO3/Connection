OsAO3	OsAO4	Co-evolved ascorbate oxidases of plant and the blast fungus orchestrate host apoplast redox state to modulate rice immunity.	 We showed that MoAo1 inhibits host ascorbate oxidases OsAO3 and OsAO4, which also regulate apoplast redox status and host immunity
OsAO3	OsAO4	Co-evolved ascorbate oxidases of plant and the blast fungus orchestrate host apoplast redox state to modulate rice immunity.	 In addition, we found that MoAo1, OsAO3, and OsAO4 all undergo polymorphic variations whose varied interactions orchestrate pathogen virulence and rice immunity
OsAO3	OsERF106MZ	Overexpression of OsERF106MZ promotes parental root growth in rice seedlings by relieving the ABA-mediated inhibition of root growth under salinity stress conditions.	 Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR and luciferase (LUC) reporter assays showed that OsERF106MZ can bind directly to the sequence containing the GCC box in the promoter region of the OsAO3 gene and repress the expression of OsAO3
