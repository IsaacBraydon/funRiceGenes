NA	Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.	2015	Nat Commun	1] State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China [2] University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.	In plants, auxin signalling is initiated by the auxin-promoted interaction between the auxin receptor TIR1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors, which are subsequently degraded by the proteasome. Gain-of-function mutations in the highly conserved domain II of Aux/IAAs abolish the TIR1-Aux/IAA interaction and thus cause an auxin-resistant phenotype. Here we show that peptidyl-prolyl isomerization of rice OsIAA11 catalysed by LATERAL ROOTLESS2 (LRT2), a cyclophilin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, directly regulates the stability of OsIAA11. NMR spectroscopy reveals that LRT2 efficiently catalyses the cis/trans isomerization of OsIAA11. The lrt2 mutation reduces OsTIR1-OsIAA11 interaction and consequently causes the accumulation of a higher level of OsIAA11 protein. Moreover, knockdown of the OsIAA11 expression partially rescues the lrt2 mutant phenotype in lateral root development. Together, these results illustrate cyclophilin-catalysed peptidyl-prolyl isomerization promotes Aux/IAA degradation, as a mechanism regulating auxin signalling.
NA	Nitrogen Mediates Flowering Time and Nitrogen Use Efficiency via Floral Regulators in Rice	2020	Curr Biol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	High nitrogen (N) fertilization for maximizing crop yield commonly leads to postponed flowering time (heading date in rice) and ripening, thus affecting resources use efficiency and followed planting time. We found that N-mediated heading date-1 (Nhd1) can directly activate florigen gene OsHd3a in rice. Inactivation of either Nhd1 or OsHd3a results in delay and insensitivity to N supply of flowering time. Knockout of Nhd1 increases N uptake and utilization efficiency at low-to-moderate N level under both short- and long-day field conditions. Increasing glutamine, the product of N assimilation, can upregulate expression of Nhd1, which in turn downregulates OsFd-GOGAT expression and OsFd-GOGAT activity, displaying a Nhd1-controlled negative feedback regulatory pathway of N assimilation. Moreover, N fertilization effect on rice flowering time shows genetically controlled diversity, and single-nucleotide polymorphism in Nhd1 promoter may relate to different responses of flowering time to N application. Nhd1 thus balances flowering time and N use efficiency in addition to photoperiod in rice.
