OsARF7	Nuclear translocation of OsMADS25 facilitated by OsNAR2.1 in response to nitrate signal promotes root growth by regulating the expression of OsMADS27 and OsARF7 in rice. |  Secondly, our ChIP-seq, ChIP-qPCR, Y1H and LUC experiments showed that OsMADS25 could directly activate the expression of OsMADS27 and OsARF7, which were reported to associate with root growth | 1 lines exhibited significantly reduced root growth than that of wild type in response to nitrate supply, and expression of OsMADS27 and OsARF7 was significantly suppressed in these lines | 1, which is required for nuclear accumulation of OsMADS25, further to promote the expression of OsMADS27 and OsARF7 and root growth in a nitrate dependent manner
