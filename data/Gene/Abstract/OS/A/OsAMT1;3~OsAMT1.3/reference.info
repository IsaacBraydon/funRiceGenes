In order to investigate the molecular basis of high-affinity ammonium absorption by roots of rice plants (Oryza sativa subspecies indica) the expression patterns of three members of the AMT1 family of genes in rice seedling roots in response to altered nitrogen provision and diurnal changes in irradiance were examined. The 13NH4+ influx and transcript levels of OsAMT1.1 in roots decreased several fold within 48 h when plants acclimated to 10 micro m external NH4+ for 3 weeks were transferred to 10 mm NH4+. Likewise when plants acclimated in 10 mm NH4+ were transferred to 10 micro m NH4+, there was an equally rapid up-regulation of OsAMT1.1 and 13NH4+ influx in the roots. Changes in transcript abundance of OsAMT1.2 following these treatments were approximately 50% less than in OsAMT1.1, and changes of OsAMT1.3 expression were even less. By contrast, in response to the diurnal changes of irradiance, root transcript abundance of OsAMT1.3 and 15NH4+ influx increased approximately three-fold late in the photoperiod, whereas OsAMT1.1 and OsAMT1.2 exhibited only modest changes. The present results suggest that high-affinity NH4+ influx is differentially regulated at the transcriptional level through the expression of three members of the OsAMT1 family of genes in roots of rice seedlings in response to changes of N status and daily irradiance. In general, these findings are in agreement with earlier observations in Arabidopsis and tomato.

The three members of the rice OsAMT1 gene family of ammonium transporters show distinct expression patterns; constitutive and ammonium-promoted expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1; root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2; root-specific and nitrogen-repressible expression for OsAMT1;3 [Sonoda et al. (2003), Plant Cell Physiol. 44: 726]. To clarify the feedback mechanisms, and to identify regulatory factors of the OsAMT1 genes, the accumulation of the three mRNAs and its dependence on endogenous nitrogen compounds (as quantified by capillary electrophoresis) was studied. Ammonium application to roots following a period of nitrogen starvation induced accumulation of OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2 mRNA, but a decrease of OsAMT1;3 mRNA levels. The expression patterns of the three genes showed good correlation (positive in OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2, negative in OsAMT1;3) with the root tissue contents of glutamine but not of ammonium. The ammonium effects on OsAMT1 expression were prevented by methionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase. Moreover, glutamine had the same effect on transcriptional regulation of OsAMT1 genes as ammonium, indicating that glutamine rather than ammonium controls the expression of ammonium transporter genes in rice. These results imply that rice possesses unique mechanisms of adaptation to variable nitrogen sources in the soil.
Plant Cell Physiol-2003-Sonoda-726-34.pdf	Distinct expression and function of three ammonium transporter genes (OsAMT1;1-1;3) in rice	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	Division of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, Hokkaido University, Kita-ku N10-W8, Sapporo, 060-0810 Japan.	To study the regulation of ammonium uptake into rice roots, three ammonium transporter genes (OsAMT1;1, 1;2 and 1;3; Oryza sativa ammonium transporter) were isolated and examined. OsAMT1s belong to AMT1 family, containing 11 putative transmembrane-spanning domains. Southern blot analysis and screening of the rice genome database confirmed that with OsAMT1;1-1;3 the complete AMT1 family of rice had been isolated. Heterologous expression of OsAMT1s in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant 31019b showed that all three OsAMT1s exhibit ammonium transport activity. Northern blot analysis showed a distinct expression pattern for the three genes; more constitutive expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1, root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2, and root-specific and nitrogen-derepressible expression for OsAMT1;3. In situ mRNA detection revealed that OsAMT1;2 is expressed in the central cylinder and cell surface of root tips. This gene expression analysis revealed a distinct nitrogen-dependent regulation for AMTs in rice, differing from that in tomato or Arabidopsis:
NA	Identification of structural elements involved in fine-tuning of the transport activity of the rice ammonium transporter OsAMT1;3.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.	Ammonium transporters (AMTs) are major routes for plant uptake of the NH4(+)-form nitrogen. Plant AMTs mediate predominantly the uptake of NH4(+) and to a lesser extent, its organic analog methylammonium (MeA(+)). Mutagenesis studies on potential phosphorylation residues have achieved solid recognition that alteration of the phosphorylation status can result in allosteric regulation and impair the functionality of plant AMTs. However, molecular insights to the fine-tuning of a functional ammonium transporter remain less clear. In this report, we demonstrate that the rice root expressed OsAMT1;3 (Oryza sativa ammonium transporter 1;3) functions as a typical high-affinity NH4(+) transporter and is weakly permeable to MeA(+) using growth assays in NH4(+) uptake defective yeast cells and electrophysiological measurements in Xenopus oocytes. Upon screening of six point mutations generated with the transporter, we identified two amino acid residues involved in the functional modulation of OsAMT1;3. The H199E mutation caused loss of transport activity whereas other five mutations retained the functionality of OsAMT1;3. Furthermore, the L56F mutation enabled respectively 5- and 3.5 -fold increased capability for NH4(+) and MeA(+) uptake with several-fold decreased affinity (Km) and accelerated Vmax values. Surprisingly, yeast cells expressing the L56F mutation shown increased Na(+) toxicity leading to a speculation that enhanced Na(+) permeation occurred with this mutation. The phenomenon was further supported by the observation of significant Na(+) uptake current in oocytes. Our results seemingly support a speculation that the L56F mutation of OsAMT1;3 widens the substrate passage tunnel and allows enhanced permeability to NH4(+) and larger ions MeA(+) and Na(+).
