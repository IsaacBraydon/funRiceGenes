NA	Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance	2014	Plant Physiol	Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, CAS.	Effective grain filling is one of the key determinants of grain setting in rice. Grain setting defect 1 (GSD1), which encodes a putative remorin protein, was found to affect grain setting in rice. Investigation of the phenotype of a T-DNA insertion mutant (grain setting defect 1-Dominant, gsd1-D) with enhanced GSD1 expression revealed abnormalities including a reduced grain setting rate, accumulation of carbohydrates in leaves, and lower soluble sugar content in the phloem exudates. GSD1 was found to be specifically expressed in the plasma membrane and plasmodesmata (PD) of phloem companion cells. Experimental evidence suggests the phenotype of the gsd1-D mutant is caused by defects in the grain filling process as a result of the impaired transport of carbohydrates from the photosynthetic site to the phloem. GSD1 functioned in affecting PD conductance by interacting with OsACT1 in association with the PD callose binding protein PDCB1. Together, our results suggest that GSD1 may play a role in regulating photoassimilate translocation through the symplastic pathway to impact grain setting in rice.
