OsARGOS	seedlings	Expression of a rice OsARGOS gene in Arabidopsis promotes cell division and expansion and increases organ size.	 OsARGOS transcripts were detected in most of rice tissues, particularly in the young tissues, and its expression was induced in rice seedlings by the application of either auxin or cytokinin
OsARGOS	growth	Expression of a rice OsARGOS gene in Arabidopsis promotes cell division and expansion and increases organ size.	 The expression of OsARGOS in Arabidopsis may activate the signaling pathways that control cell proliferation and cell expansion during the course of plant growth and development
OsARGOS	auxin	Expression of a rice OsARGOS gene in Arabidopsis promotes cell division and expansion and increases organ size.	 OsARGOS transcripts were detected in most of rice tissues, particularly in the young tissues, and its expression was induced in rice seedlings by the application of either auxin or cytokinin
OsARGOS	development	Expression of a rice OsARGOS gene in Arabidopsis promotes cell division and expansion and increases organ size.	 The expression of OsARGOS in Arabidopsis may activate the signaling pathways that control cell proliferation and cell expansion during the course of plant growth and development
OsARGOS	cell division	Expression of a rice OsARGOS gene in Arabidopsis promotes cell division and expansion and increases organ size.	Expression of a rice OsARGOS gene in Arabidopsis promotes cell division and expansion and increases organ size.
OsARGOS	cytokinin	Expression of a rice OsARGOS gene in Arabidopsis promotes cell division and expansion and increases organ size.	 OsARGOS transcripts were detected in most of rice tissues, particularly in the young tissues, and its expression was induced in rice seedlings by the application of either auxin or cytokinin
OsARGOS	plant growth	Expression of a rice OsARGOS gene in Arabidopsis promotes cell division and expansion and increases organ size.	 The expression of OsARGOS in Arabidopsis may activate the signaling pathways that control cell proliferation and cell expansion during the course of plant growth and development
OsARGOS	biomass	Expression of a rice OsARGOS gene in Arabidopsis promotes cell division and expansion and increases organ size.	 Since the expression of OsARGOS causes organ enlargement, the potential application of this gene through genetic engineering may significantly improve the production of biomass in agricultural practice
OsARGOS	cell proliferation	Expression of a rice OsARGOS gene in Arabidopsis promotes cell division and expansion and increases organ size.	 The expression of OsARGOS in Arabidopsis may activate the signaling pathways that control cell proliferation and cell expansion during the course of plant growth and development
OsARGOS	organ size	Expression of a rice OsARGOS gene in Arabidopsis promotes cell division and expansion and increases organ size.	Expression of a rice OsARGOS gene in Arabidopsis promotes cell division and expansion and increases organ size.
OsARGOS	organ size	Expression of a rice OsARGOS gene in Arabidopsis promotes cell division and expansion and increases organ size.	 We also transferred the OsARGOS gene to rice, but the transgenic plants did not show any changes in organ size compared with the control plants
OsARGOS	organ size	Expression of a rice OsARGOS gene in Arabidopsis promotes cell division and expansion and increases organ size.	 It is likely that the function of OsARGOS in organ size control depends on other size regulators in rice
