OsADF	anther	An anther development F-box (ADF) protein regulated by tapetum degeneration retardation (TDR) controls rice anther development.	 By qRT-PCR and RNA in situ hybridization, we further confirmed that OsADF expressed specially in tapetal cells from stage 9 to stage 12 during anther development
OsADF	anther	An anther development F-box (ADF) protein regulated by tapetum degeneration retardation (TDR) controls rice anther development.	 Furthermore, we demonstrated that the TDR, a key regulator in controlling rice anther development, could regulate directly the expression of OsADF by binding to E-box motifs of its promoter
OsADF	fertility	An anther development F-box (ADF) protein regulated by tapetum degeneration retardation (TDR) controls rice anther development.	 In consistent with this specific expression pattern, the RNAi transgenic lines of OsADF exhibited abnormal tapetal degeneration and aborted microspores development, which eventually grew pollens with reduced fertility
OsADF	tapetal	An anther development F-box (ADF) protein regulated by tapetum degeneration retardation (TDR) controls rice anther development.	 By qRT-PCR and RNA in situ hybridization, we further confirmed that OsADF expressed specially in tapetal cells from stage 9 to stage 12 during anther development
