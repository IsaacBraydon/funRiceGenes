OsADF	 In this study, we cloned and characterized a panicle-specific expression F-box protein, anther development F-box (OsADF) |  In consistent with this specific expression pattern, the RNAi transgenic lines of OsADF exhibited abnormal tapetal degeneration and aborted microspores development, which eventually grew pollens with reduced fertility |  Furthermore, we demonstrated that the TDR, a key regulator in controlling rice anther development, could regulate directly the expression of OsADF by binding to E-box motifs of its promoter	 In consistent with this specific expression pattern, the RNAi transgenic lines of OsADF exhibited abnormal tapetal degeneration and aborted microspores development, which eventually grew pollens with reduced fertility
