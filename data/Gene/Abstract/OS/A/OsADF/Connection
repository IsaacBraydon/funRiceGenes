OsADF	TDR	An anther development F-box (ADF) protein regulated by tapetum degeneration retardation (TDR) controls rice anther development.	In this study, we reported that a F-box protein, OsADF, as one of the direct targets of TDR , plays a critical role in rice tapetum cell development and pollen formation
OsADF	TDR	An anther development F-box (ADF) protein regulated by tapetum degeneration retardation (TDR) controls rice anther development.	Furthermore, we demonstrated that the TDR, a key regulator in controlling rice anther development, could regulate directly the expression of OsADF by binding to E-box motifs of its promoter
