OsALMT4	xylem	Altered expression of a malate-permeable anion channel, OsALMT4, disrupts mineral nutrition.	 Transgenic rice lines over-expressing (OX) OsALMT4 released malate from the roots constitutively and had two-fold higher malate concentrations in the xylem sap than nulls indicating greater concentrations of malate in the apoplast
OsALMT4	plasma membrane	Altered expression of a malate-permeable anion channel, OsALMT4, disrupts mineral nutrition.	 We show that OsALMT4 is expressed in roots and shoots and the OsALMT4 protein localizes to the plasma membrane
OsALMT4	growth	Altered Expression of the Malate-Permeable Anion Channel OsALMT4 Reduces the Growth of Rice Under Low Radiance.	Altered Expression of the Malate-Permeable Anion Channel OsALMT4 Reduces the Growth of Rice Under Low Radiance.
OsALMT4	growth	Altered Expression of the Malate-Permeable Anion Channel OsALMT4 Reduces the Growth of Rice Under Low Radiance.	 Growth of transgenic lines with either increased OsALMT4 expression or reduced expression was measured in different environments
OsALMT4	growth	Altered Expression of the Malate-Permeable Anion Channel OsALMT4 Reduces the Growth of Rice Under Low Radiance.	 Altering OsALMT4 expression compromises growth in low-light environments
OsALMT4	grain	Altered Expression of the Malate-Permeable Anion Channel OsALMT4 Reduces the Growth of Rice Under Low Radiance.	 Here, we show that OsALMT4 is expressed widely in roots, shoots, flowers, and grain but not guard cells
OsALMT4	salicylic acid	Altered Expression of the Malate-Permeable Anion Channel OsALMT4 Reduces the Growth of Rice Under Low Radiance.	 Malate efflux from the transgenic plants over-expressing OsALMT4 was inhibited by niflumate and salicylic acid
OsALMT4	biomass	Altered Expression of the Malate-Permeable Anion Channel OsALMT4 Reduces the Growth of Rice Under Low Radiance.	 When day-time light was reduced from 700 to 300 ¦Ìmol m-2s-1 independent transgenic lines with either increased or decreased OsALMT4 expression accumulated less biomass compared to their null controls
OsALMT4	plasma membrane	Altered Expression of the Malate-Permeable Anion Channel OsALMT4 Reduces the Growth of Rice Under Low Radiance.	 Previous studies showed that OsALMT4 localizes to the plasma membrane and that expression in transgenic rice lines results in a constitutive release of malate from the roots
