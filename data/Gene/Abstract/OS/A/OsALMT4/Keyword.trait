OsALMT4	xylem	Altered expression of a malate-permeable anion channel, OsALMT4, disrupts mineral nutrition.	 Transgenic rice lines over-expressing (OX) OsALMT4 released malate from the roots constitutively and had two-fold higher malate concentrations in the xylem sap than nulls indicating greater concentrations of malate in the apoplast
OsALMT4	plasma membrane	Altered expression of a malate-permeable anion channel, OsALMT4, disrupts mineral nutrition.	 We show that OsALMT4 is expressed in roots and shoots and the OsALMT4 protein localizes to the plasma membrane
