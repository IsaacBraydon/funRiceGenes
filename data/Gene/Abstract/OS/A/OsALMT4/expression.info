OsALMT4	Altered expression of a malate-permeable anion channel, OsALMT4, disrupts mineral nutrition. |  We conclude that increasing OsALMT4 expression affected malate efflux and compartmentation within the tissues which increased Mn concentrations in the apoplast of leaves and induced the toxicity symptoms
OsALMT4	Altered Expression of the Malate-Permeable Anion Channel OsALMT4 Reduces the Growth of Rice Under Low Radiance. |  Previous studies showed that OsALMT4 localizes to the plasma membrane and that expression in transgenic rice lines results in a constitutive release of malate from the roots |  Growth of transgenic lines with either increased OsALMT4 expression or reduced expression was measured in different environments |  When day-time light was reduced from 700 to 300 ¦Ìmol m-2s-1 independent transgenic lines with either increased or decreased OsALMT4 expression accumulated less biomass compared to their null controls |  Altering OsALMT4 expression compromises growth in low-light environments
