OsALMT4	Altered expression of a malate-permeable anion channel, OsALMT4, disrupts mineral nutrition. |  We conclude that increasing OsALMT4 expression affected malate efflux and compartmentation within the tissues which increased Mn concentrations in the apoplast of leaves and induced the toxicity symptoms
