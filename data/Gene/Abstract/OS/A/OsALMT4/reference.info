NA	Altered expression of a malate-permeable anion channel, OsALMT4, disrupts mineral nutrition.	2017	Plant Physiol	CSIRO Agriculture and Food CITY: Canberra ACT 2601 Australia [AU].	Aluminium-activated malate transporters (ALMT) form a family of anions channels in plants but little is known about most of its members. This study examined the function of OsALMT4 from rice (Oryza sativa L.). We show that OsALMT4 is expressed in roots and shoots and the OsALMT4 protein localizes to the plasma membrane. Transgenic rice lines over-expressing (OX) OsALMT4 released malate from the roots constitutively and had two-fold higher malate concentrations in the xylem sap than nulls indicating greater concentrations of malate in the apoplast. OX lines developed brown necrotic spots on the leaves which did not appear on nulls. These symptoms were not associated with altered concentrations of any mineral element in the leaves although the OX lines had higher concentrations of Mn and B in their grain compared with nulls. While total leaf Mn concentrations were not different between the OX and null lines, Mn concentrations in the apoplast were greater in the OX plants. The OX lines also displayed increased expression of Mn transporters and were more sensitive to Mn toxicity than null plants. We showed that growth of wild-type rice was unaffected by 100 ¦ÌM Mn in hydroponics but, when combined with 1 mM malate, this concentration inhibited growth. We conclude that increasing OsALMT4 expression affected malate efflux and compartmentation within the tissues which increased Mn concentrations in the apoplast of leaves and induced the toxicity symptoms. This study reveals new links between malate transport and mineral nutrition.
NA	Altered Expression of the Malate-Permeable Anion Channel OsALMT4 Reduces the Growth of Rice Under Low Radiance.	2018	Front Plant Sci	Agriculture and Food, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Canberra, ACT, Australia.	We examined the function of OsALMT4 in rice (Oryza sativa L.) which is a member of the aluminum-activated malate transporter family. Previous studies showed that OsALMT4 localizes to the plasma membrane and that expression in transgenic rice lines results in a constitutive release of malate from the roots. Here, we show that OsALMT4 is expressed widely in roots, shoots, flowers, and grain but not guard cells. Expression was also affected by ionic and osmotic stress, light and to the hormones ABA, IAA, and salicylic acid. Malate efflux from the transgenic plants over-expressing OsALMT4 was inhibited by niflumate and salicylic acid. Growth of transgenic lines with either increased OsALMT4 expression or reduced expression was measured in different environments. Light intensity caused significant differences in growth between the transgenic lines and controls. When day-time light was reduced from 700 to 300 ¦Ìmol m-2s-1 independent transgenic lines with either increased or decreased OsALMT4 expression accumulated less biomass compared to their null controls. This response was not associated with differences in photosynthetic capacity, stomatal conductance or sugar concentrations in tissues. We propose that by disrupting malate fluxes across the plasma membrane carbon partitioning and perhaps signaling are affected which compromises growth under low light. We conclude that OsALMT4 is expressed widely in rice and facilitates malate efflux from different cell types. Altering OsALMT4 expression compromises growth in low-light environments.
