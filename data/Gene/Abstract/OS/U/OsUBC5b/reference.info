Chem.-2005-Katoh-41015-24.pdf	Active site residues and amino acid specificity of the ubiquitin carrier protein-binding RING-H2 finger domain	2005	J Biol Chem	Biochemistry Department, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	EL5 is a rice ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) containing a RING-H2 finger domain that interacts with Oryza sativa (Os) UBC5b, a rice ubiquitin carrier protein. We introduced point mutations into the EL5 RING-H2 finger so that residues that functionally interact with OsUBC5b could be identified when assayed for ubiquitination activity in vitro. The residue positions were selected based on the results of an EL5 RING-H2 finger/OsUBC5b NMR titration experiment. These RING-H2 finger residues form or are adjacent to a shallow groove that is recognized by OsUBC5b. The E3 activity of EL5 is shown to be dependent on a Trp located at the center of the groove. We classified rice RING fingers according to the type of metal-chelating motif, i.e. RING-H2 or RING-HC, and according to the presence or absence of a conserved EL5-like Trp. We discuss the probable relationship between E3 activity and the conserved Trp.
j.1365-313X.2002.01299.x.pdf	EL5, a rice N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor-responsive RING-H2 finger protein, is a ubiquitin ligase which functions in vitro in co-operation with an elicitor-responsive ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, OsUBC5b	2002	The Plant Journal	Institute of Applied Biochemistry, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennoudai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8572, Japan.	EL5, a rice gene responsive to N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor, encodes a RING-H2 finger protein with structural features common to the plant-specific ATL family. We show that the fusion protein of EL5 with maltose binding protein (MBP) was polyubiquitinated by incubation with ubiquitin, ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), and the Ubc4/5 subfamily of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). EL5 possesses the activity to catalyse the transfer of ubiquitin to the MBP moiety, and the RING-H2 finger motif of EL5 is necessary for this activity. Thus, we concluded that EL5 represents a ubiquitin ligase (E3). We also show that two rice E2s (OsUBC5a, OsUBC5b) of the Ubc4/5 subfamily function as E2 which catalyses EL5-mediated ubiquitination, and OsUBC5b was induced by elicitor, as well as EL5. These results strongly suggest that EL5 and OsUBC5b have roles in plant defense response through the turnover of protein(s) via the ubiquitin/proteasome system.
