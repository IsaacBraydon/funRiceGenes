Root hairs are required for water and nutrient acquisition in plants. Here, we report a novel mechanism that OsUGE1 is negatively controlled by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair elongation in rice. Root hairs are tubular outgrowths generated by the root epidermal cells. They effectively enlarge the soil-root contact area and play essential roles for nutrient and water absorption. Here, in this study, we demonstrated that the Oryza sativa UDP-glucose 4-epimerase 1-like (OsUGE1) negatively regulated root hair elongation and was directly targeted by Oryza sativa growth regulating factor 6 (OsGRF6). Knockout mutants of OsUGE1 using CRISPR-Cas9 technology showed longer root hairs than those of wild type. In contrast, overexpression lines of OsUGE1 displayed shorter root hair compared with those of wild type. GUS staining showed that it could specifically express in root hair. Subcellular localization analysis indicates that OsUGE1 is located in endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus and plasma membrane. More importantly, ChIP-qPCR, Yeast-one-hybrid and BiFC experiments revealed that OsGRF6 could bind to the promoter of OsUGE1. Furthermore, knockout mutants of OsGRF6 showed shorter root hair than those of wild type, and OsGRF6 dominantly expressed in root. In addition, the expression level of OsUGE1 is significantly downregulated in Osgrf6 mutant. Taken together, our study reveals a novel pathway that OsUGE1 is negatively controlled by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair elongation in rice.
NA	UDP-glucose epimerase 1, moonlighting as a transcriptional activator, is essential for tapetum degradation and male fertility in rice.	2023	Mol Plant	Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China. Electronic address: wangnan_xndx@126.com.	Multiple enzymes perform moonlighting functions distinct from their main roles. UDP-glucose epimerases (UGEs), a subclass of isomerases, catalyze the interconversion of UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) and UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal). We identified a rice male-sterile mutant, osuge1, with delayed tapetum degradation and abortive pollen. The mutant osuge1 protein lacked UDP-glucose epimerase activity, resulting in higher UDP-Gal content and lower UDP-Glc levels in the osuge1 mutant compared with the wild type. Interestingly, we discovered that OsUGE1 participates in the TIP2/bHLH142-TDR-EAT1/DTD transcriptional regulatory cascade involved in tapetum degradation, in which TIP2 and TDR regulate the expression of OsUGE1 while OsUGE1 regulates the expression of EAT1. In addition, we found that OsUGE1 regulates the expression of its own gene by directly binding to an E-box element in the OsUGE1 promoter. Collectively, our results indicate that OsUGE1 not only functions as a UDP-glucose epimerase but also moonlights as a transcriptional activator to promote tapetum degradation, revealing a novel regulatory mechanism of rice reproductive development.
