OsGRF6	OsUGE1	OsUGE1 is directly targeted by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair length in rice.	OsUGE1 is directly targeted by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair length in rice.
OsGRF6	OsUGE1	OsUGE1 is directly targeted by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair length in rice.	 Here, we report a novel mechanism that OsUGE1 is negatively controlled by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair elongation in rice
OsGRF6	OsUGE1	OsUGE1 is directly targeted by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair length in rice.	 Here, in this study, we demonstrated that the Oryza sativa UDP-glucose 4-epimerase 1-like (OsUGE1) negatively regulated root hair elongation and was directly targeted by Oryza sativa growth regulating factor 6 (OsGRF6)
OsGRF6	OsUGE1	OsUGE1 is directly targeted by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair length in rice.	 More importantly, ChIP-qPCR, Yeast-one-hybrid and BiFC experiments revealed that OsGRF6 could bind to the promoter of OsUGE1
OsGRF6	OsUGE1	OsUGE1 is directly targeted by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair length in rice.	 In addition, the expression level of OsUGE1 is significantly downregulated in Osgrf6 mutant
OsGRF6	OsUGE1	OsUGE1 is directly targeted by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair length in rice.	 Taken together, our study reveals a novel pathway that OsUGE1 is negatively controlled by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair elongation in rice
