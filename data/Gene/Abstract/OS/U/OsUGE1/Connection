OsGRF6	OsUGE1|BP1	OsUGE1 is directly targeted by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair length in rice.	OsUGE1 is directly targeted by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair length in rice.
OsGRF6	OsUGE1|BP1	OsUGE1 is directly targeted by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair length in rice.	 Here, we report a novel mechanism that OsUGE1 is negatively controlled by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair elongation in rice
OsGRF6	OsUGE1|BP1	OsUGE1 is directly targeted by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair length in rice.	 Here, in this study, we demonstrated that the Oryza sativa UDP-glucose 4-epimerase 1-like (OsUGE1) negatively regulated root hair elongation and was directly targeted by Oryza sativa growth regulating factor 6 (OsGRF6)
OsGRF6	OsUGE1|BP1	OsUGE1 is directly targeted by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair length in rice.	 More importantly, ChIP-qPCR, Yeast-one-hybrid and BiFC experiments revealed that OsGRF6 could bind to the promoter of OsUGE1
OsGRF6	OsUGE1|BP1	OsUGE1 is directly targeted by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair length in rice.	 In addition, the expression level of OsUGE1 is significantly downregulated in Osgrf6 mutant
OsGRF6	OsUGE1|BP1	OsUGE1 is directly targeted by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair length in rice.	 Taken together, our study reveals a novel pathway that OsUGE1 is negatively controlled by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair elongation in rice
DTD|EAT1	OsUGE1|BP1	UDP-glucose epimerase 1, moonlighting as a transcriptional activator, is essential for tapetum degradation and male fertility in rice.	 Interestingly, we discovered that OsUGE1 participates in the TIP2/bHLH142-TDR-EAT1/DTD transcriptional regulatory cascade involved in tapetum degradation, in which TIP2 and TDR regulate the expression of OsUGE1 while OsUGE1 regulates the expression of EAT1
