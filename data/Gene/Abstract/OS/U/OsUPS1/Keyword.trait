OsUPS1	growth	Allantoin accumulation through overexpression of ureide permease1 improves rice growth under limited nitrogen conditions.	 We propose that OsUPS1 is responsible for allantoin partitioning in rice and its overexpression can support plant growth through accumulation of allantoin in sink tissues which can be utilized when N is limiting
OsUPS1	plasma membrane	Allantoin accumulation through overexpression of ureide permease1 improves rice growth under limited nitrogen conditions.	 Here, we show that OsUPS1 is localized in plasma membranes and are highly expressed in vascular tissues of rice
OsUPS1	plant growth	Allantoin accumulation through overexpression of ureide permease1 improves rice growth under limited nitrogen conditions.	 We propose that OsUPS1 is responsible for allantoin partitioning in rice and its overexpression can support plant growth through accumulation of allantoin in sink tissues which can be utilized when N is limiting
