NA	A Nitrogen Molecular Sensing System, Comprised of the ALLANTOINASE and UREIDE PERMEASE 1 Genes, Can Be Used to Monitor N Status in Rice.	2018	Front Plant Sci	Graduate School of International Agricultural Technology and Crop Biotechnology Institute, GreenBio Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Pyeongchang, South Korea.	Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for plant growth and development, but its concentration in the soil is often insufficient for optimal crop production. Consequently, improving N utilization in crops is considered as a major target in agricultural biotechnology. However, much remains to be learnt about crop N metabolism for application. In this study, we have developed a molecular sensor system to monitor the N status in rice (Oryza sativa). We first examined the role of the ureide, allantoin, which is catabolized into allantoin-derived metabolites and used as an N source under low N conditions. The expression levels of two genes involved in ureide metabolism, ALLANTOINASE (OsALN) and UREIDE PERMEASE 1 (OsUPS1), were highly responsive to the N status. OsALN was rapidly up-regulated under low N conditions, whereas OsUPS1 was up-regulated under high N conditions. Taking advantage of the responses of these two genes to N status, we generated transgenic rice plants harboring the molecular N sensors, proALN::ALN-LUC2 and proUPS1::UPS1-LUC2, comprising the gene promoters driving expression of the luciferase reporter. We observed that expression of the transgenes mimicked transcriptional regulation of the endogenous OsALN and OsUPS1 genes in response to exogenous N status. Importantly, the molecular N sensors showed similar levels of specificity to nitrate and ammonium, from which we infer their sensing abilities. Transgenic rice plants expressing the proUPS1::UPS1-LUC2 sensor showed strong luminescence under high exogenous N conditions (&gt;1 mM), whereas transgenic plants expressing the proALN::ALN-LUC2 sensor showed strong luminescence under low exogenous N conditions (&lt;0.1 mM). High exogenous N (&gt;1 mM) substantially increased internal ammonium and nitrate levels, whereas low exogenous N (&lt;0.1 mM) had no effect on internal ammonium and nitrate levels, indicating the luminescence signals of molecular sensors reflect internal N status in rice. Thus, proALN::ALN-LUC2 and proUPS1::UPS1-LUC2 represent N molecular sensors that operate over a physiological and developmental range in rice.
NA	Allantoin accumulation through overexpression of ureide permease1 improves rice growth under limited nitrogen conditions.	2018	Plant Biotechnol J	Graduate School of International Agricultural Technology and Crop Biotechnology, Institute/GreenBio Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Pyeongchang, Korea.	In legumes, nitrogen (N) can be stored as ureide allantoin and transported by ureide permease (UPS) from nodules to leaves where it is catabolized to release ammonium and assimilation to amino acids. In non-leguminous plants especially rice, information on its roles in N metabolism is scarce. Here, we show that OsUPS1 is localized in plasma membranes and are highly expressed in vascular tissues of rice. We further evaluated an activation tagging rice overexpressing OsUPS1 (OsUPS1OX ) under several N regimes. Under normal field conditions, panicles from OsUPS1OX plants (14 days after flowering (DAF)) showed significant allantoin accumulation. Under hydroponic system at the vegetative stage, plants were exposed to N-starvation and measured the ammonium in roots after resupplying with ammonium sulfate. OsUPS1OX plants displayed higher ammonium uptake in roots compared to wild type (WT). When grown under low-N soil supplemented with different N concentrations, OsUPS1OX exhibited better growth at 50% N showing higher chlorophyll, tiller number and at least 20% increase in shoot and root biomass relative to WT. To further confirm the effects of regulating the expression of OsUPS1, we evaluated whole-body-overexpressing plants driven by the GOS2 promoter (OsUPS1GOS2 ) as well as silencing plants (OsUPS1RNAi ). We found significant accumulation of allantoin in leaves, stems and roots of OsUPS1GOS2 while in OsUPS1RNAi allantoin was significantly accumulated in roots. We propose that OsUPS1 is responsible for allantoin partitioning in rice and its overexpression can support plant growth through accumulation of allantoin in sink tissues which can be utilized when N is limiting.
