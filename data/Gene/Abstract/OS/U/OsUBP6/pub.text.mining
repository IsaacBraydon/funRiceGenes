The seedlings were grown for                  Os08g41620       5-GTTGATCAAAAACAATCCGAG-3 growth chamber, transplanted to soil, and raised to maturity in a               Os08g41640       5-GTGTGATTTTGGTGTGATGAAC-3    Rice seedlings were subjected to various abiotic stresses                    Os08g37350       5-GAAAACATAGCTGAAACCAACA-3 slight modifications.

Briefly, seedlings were dehydrated on                  Os12g30540       5-TGAAGCTCATCTCTACACCATC-3 and subdivided into 9 groups based on their sequence identities and domain structures. The G1 members (Os08g41530, Os08g41540, Os08g41630, Os08g41640, and Os08g41620) contain 1 or 2 zinc-finger ubiquitin-specific protease (ZnF-UBP) domains, three out of four G2 members (Os08g37350, Os02g14730, and Os06g44380) contain myeloid, nervy and DEAF1 (MYND)-type zinc finger (ZnF-MYND) motif, and two G5 OsUBPs (Os12g30540 and Os01g56490) have a single meprin and TRAF homology (MATH) domain in their N-terminal regions. Ubiquitin and DUSP (domain in USPs) motifs are present in the G6 (Os01g36930) and G8 (Os10g07270) OsUBPs, respectively, in their N- terminal regions. The G7 (Os01g08200) member contains ZnF-UBP, UCH, and two ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains. The G3 (Os06g08530, Os02g55180, and Os05g43480), G4 (Os04g37950, Os03g09080, and Os02g36400), and G9 (Os07g46660) OsUBP proteins 2007). In contrast, although the possible functions of UBPs             bers (Os08g37350, Os02g14730, and Os06g44380) (Fig. 2). In were studied in Arabidopsis (Doelling et al., 2007; Liu et al.,         addition, two G5 OsUBPs (Os12g30540 and Os01g56490) rice, a monocot model plant. To identify rice UBP genes, we             their N-terminal regions. The G6 (Os01g36930) and G8 (Os10g tain ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (UCH) motif. Our             the G7 member (Os01g08200) contains three different motifs, uitin-Specific Proteases). We next carried out the phylogenetic         (Os06g08530, Os02g55180, and Os05g43480), G4 (Os04g analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, the predicted OsUBPs were                37950, Os03g09080, and Os02g36400), and G9 (Os07g46660) 41530, Os08g41540, Os08g41630, Os08g41640, and Os08g                    flowers of three-month-old mature rice plants. Total RNA was then subjected to RT-PCR analysis using gene specific primer               Os06g44380), G7 (Os01g08200), and G8 (Os10g07270) genes G1 genes (Os08g41530, Os08g41540, Os08g41630, Os08g 41640, and Os08g41620) are expressed at very low levels in                 Isolation and characterization of OsUBP6 full-length cDNA every tissue examined, including leaves, stems, roots, and flow-           Among the 21 putative OsUBPs, the Os01g36930 protein (the the levels of G3 (Os06g08530, Os02g55180, and Os05g43480),                 length Os01g36930 cDNA by RT-PCR using gene-specific G4 (Os04g37950, Os03g09080, and Os02g36400), G5 (Os12g                     primers.

The Os01g36930 protein has a predicted molecular mass of 53.2 kDa and a calculated pI of 5.73. The rice Os01g36930 protein          NP_005142.1) (Figs. 3B and 3C).

Therefore, we named rice Os01g36930 protein             shown in Fig. 4B, MBP-OsUBP6 produced ubiquitin monomer under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S            family members, Os08g41530, Os08g41540, Os08g41630, promoter, and the resulting construct (35S:OsUBP6-smFGP)                Os08g41640, and Os08g41620, are extremely low in most rice was transfected into onion epidermal cells by particle bombard-         tissues, while four G2 genes (Os08g37350, Os09g28940, ment. Localization of the fusion protein was then visualized with a     Os02g14730, and Os06g44380) show similar low expression fluorescence microscope. The results show that OsUBP6-                  levels. In addition, all G3 genes (Os06g08530 and Os02g55180), smGFP is primarily localized to the nucleus (Fig. 6, lower panels),     G4 genes (Os04g37950, Os03g09080, and Os02g36400), and while control smGFP is found to be present throughout the cell          G5 genes (Os12g30540 and Os01g56490) are expressed at
