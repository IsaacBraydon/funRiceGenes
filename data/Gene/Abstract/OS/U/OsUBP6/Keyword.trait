OsUBP6	growth	Structure and expression of OsUBP6, an ubiquitin-specific protease 6 homolog in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 We also examined how knock-out of OsUBP6 affects developmental growth of rice plants
OsUBP6	growth	Structure and expression of OsUBP6, an ubiquitin-specific protease 6 homolog in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Although homozygous T3 osubp6 T-DNA insertion mutant seedlings displayed slower growth relative to wild type seedlings, mature mutant plants appeared to be normal
OsUBP6	seedling	Structure and expression of OsUBP6, an ubiquitin-specific protease 6 homolog in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Although homozygous T3 osubp6 T-DNA insertion mutant seedlings displayed slower growth relative to wild type seedlings, mature mutant plants appeared to be normal
