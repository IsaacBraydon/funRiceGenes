OsUGT706C2	tolerance	A UV-B-responsive glycosyltransferase, OsUGT706C2, modulates flavonoid metabolism in rice.	 Furthermore, overexpressing OsUGT706C2 can enhance UV-B tolerance by promoting ROS scavenging in rice
OsUGT706C2	yield	A UV-B-responsive glycosyltransferase, OsUGT706C2, modulates flavonoid metabolism in rice.	 Our findings might make it possible to use the glycosyltransferase OsUGT706C2 for crop improvement with respect to UV-B adaptation and/or flavonoid accumulation, which may contribute to stable yield
OsUGT706C2	glycosyltransferase	A UV-B-responsive glycosyltransferase, OsUGT706C2, modulates flavonoid metabolism in rice.	A UV-B-responsive glycosyltransferase, OsUGT706C2, modulates flavonoid metabolism in rice.
OsUGT706C2	flavonoid metabolism	A UV-B-responsive glycosyltransferase, OsUGT706C2, modulates flavonoid metabolism in rice.	A UV-B-responsive glycosyltransferase, OsUGT706C2, modulates flavonoid metabolism in rice.
