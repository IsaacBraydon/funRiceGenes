OsUGT706C2	 Although the in vitro enzyme activity of OsUGT706C2 was similar to that of OsUGT706D1, the expression pattern and induced expression profile of OsUGT706C2 were very different from those of OsUGT706D1 |  Constitutive expression of OsUGT706C2 in rice may modulate phenylpropanoid metabolism at both the transcript and metabolite levels
