Although natural variations in rice flavonoids exist, and biochemical characterization of a few flavonoid glycosyltransferases has been reported, few studies focused on natural variations in tricin-lignan-glycosides and their underlying genetic basis. In this study, we carried out metabolic profiling of tricin-lignan-glycosides and identified a major quantitative gene annotated as a UDP-dependent glycosyltransferase OsUGT706C2 by metabolite-based genome-wide association analysis. The putative flavonoid glycosyltransferase OsUGT706C2 was characterized as a flavonoid 7-O-glycosyltransferas in vitro and in vivo. Although the in vitro enzyme activity of OsUGT706C2 was similar to that of OsUGT706D1, the expression pattern and induced expression profile of OsUGT706C2 were very different from those of OsUGT706D1. Besides, OsUGT706C2 was specifically induced by UV-B. Constitutive expression of OsUGT706C2 in rice may modulate phenylpropanoid metabolism at both the transcript and metabolite levels. Furthermore, overexpressing OsUGT706C2 can enhance UV-B tolerance by promoting ROS scavenging in rice. Our findings might make it possible to use the glycosyltransferase OsUGT706C2 for crop improvement with respect to UV-B adaptation and/or flavonoid accumulation, which may contribute to stable yield.
