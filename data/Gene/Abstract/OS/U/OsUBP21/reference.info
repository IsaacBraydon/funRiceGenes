To understand the early heat shock (HS)-regulated cellular responses that influence the tolerance of rice plant to high environmental temperatures, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) was performed to explore the early HS-regulated proteome. Multiple proteins that showed abundance changes after 1 and 5 min of HS treatment were identified. Of the early HS-regulated proteins identified, the abundance of a ubiquitin-specific protease, OsUBP21, and its Arabidopsis homolog, AtUBP13, was found to be up-regulated by 5 min of HS treatment. Further, knocking the expression of OsUBP21 or AtUBP13 down or out increased the tolerance of rice and Arabidopsis plants to HS stress, suggesting that the function of these ubiquitin-specific proteases in regulating plant HS responses is conserved between monocots and dicots. 2-D DIGE showed a group of proteins were differentially regulated in wild-type and ubp21 mutant after 30 min of HS treatment. Among these proteins, 11 were found to interact directly with OsUBP21; thus, they may be targets of OsUBP21. Future analyses of the roles of these OsUBP21-interacting proteins in plant HS responses will help reveal the protein ubiquitination/deubiquitination-regulated cellular responses induced by HS in rice.
