OsUBP21	tolerance	A Quantitative Proteomics Study of Early Heat-Regulated Proteins by Two-Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis Identified OsUBP21 as a Negative Regulator of Heat Stress Responses in Rice.	 Further, knocking the expression of OsUBP21 or AtUBP13 down or out increased the tolerance of rice and Arabidopsis plants to HS stress, suggesting that the function of these ubiquitin-specific proteases in regulating plant HS responses is conserved between monocots and dicots
