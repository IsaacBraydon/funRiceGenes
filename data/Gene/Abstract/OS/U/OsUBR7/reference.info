Plant height is an important agronomic trait for lodging resistance and yield. Here we report a new plant height-related gene OsUBR7 in rice (Oryza sativa L.); knockout of OsUBR7 caused fewer cells in internodes, resulting in a semi-dwarf phenotype. OsUBR7 encodes a putative E3 ligase containing a Plant Homeodomain-finger and an Ubiquitin Protein Ligase E3 Component N-Recognin7 (UBR7) domain. OsUBR7 interacts with histones and monoubiquitinates H2B (H2Bub1) at lysine148 with coordination of the E2 conjugase OsUBC18. OsUBR7 mediates H2Bub1 at a number of chromatin loci for the normal expression of target genes, including cell cycle-related and pleiotropic genes, consistent with the observation that the osubr7 mutant had suppression of cell cycle progression due to reductions of H2Bub1 and expression levels at these loci. The genetic divergence of OsUBR7 alleles among japonica and indica cultivars affects their transcriptional activity, and these alleles might have undergone selection during rice domestication. Overall, our results provide a novel mechanism mediating H2Bub1 in plants, and UBR7 orthologs could be utilized as an untapped epigenetic resource for crop improvement.
