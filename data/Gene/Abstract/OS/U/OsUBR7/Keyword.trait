OsUBR7	domestication	Rice OsUBR7 modulates plant height by regulating histone H2B monoubiquitination and cell proliferation.	 The genetic divergence of OsUBR7 alleles among japonica and indica cultivars affects their transcriptional activity, and these alleles might have undergone selection during rice domestication
OsUBR7	cell cycle	Rice OsUBR7 modulates plant height by regulating histone H2B monoubiquitination and cell proliferation.	 OsUBR7 mediates H2Bub1 at a number of chromatin loci for the normal expression of target genes, including cell cycle-related and pleiotropic genes, consistent with the observation that the osubr7 mutant had suppression of cell cycle progression due to reductions of H2Bub1 and expression levels at these loci
OsUBR7	height	Rice OsUBR7 modulates plant height by regulating histone H2B monoubiquitination and cell proliferation.	Rice OsUBR7 modulates plant height by regulating histone H2B monoubiquitination and cell proliferation.
OsUBR7	plant height	Rice OsUBR7 modulates plant height by regulating histone H2B monoubiquitination and cell proliferation.	Rice OsUBR7 modulates plant height by regulating histone H2B monoubiquitination and cell proliferation.
OsUBR7	plant height	Rice OsUBR7 modulates plant height by regulating histone H2B monoubiquitination and cell proliferation.	 Here we report a new plant height-related gene OsUBR7 in rice (Oryza sativa L
OsUBR7	cell proliferation	Rice OsUBR7 modulates plant height by regulating histone H2B monoubiquitination and cell proliferation.	Rice OsUBR7 modulates plant height by regulating histone H2B monoubiquitination and cell proliferation.
OsUBR7	Ubiquitin	Rice OsUBR7 modulates plant height by regulating histone H2B monoubiquitination and cell proliferation.	 OsUBR7 encodes a putative E3 ligase containing a Plant Homeodomain-finger and an Ubiquitin Protein Ligase E3 Component N-Recognin7 (UBR7) domain
