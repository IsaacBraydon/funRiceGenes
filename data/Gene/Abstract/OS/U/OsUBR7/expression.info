OsUBR7	 OsUBR7 mediates H2Bub1 at a number of chromatin loci for the normal expression of target genes, including cell cycle-related and pleiotropic genes, consistent with the observation that the osubr7 mutant had suppression of cell cycle progression due to reductions of H2Bub1 and expression levels at these loci
