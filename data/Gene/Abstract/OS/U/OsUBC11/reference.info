NA	Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme OsUBC11 Affects the Development of Roots via Auxin Pathway.	2023	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory of Black Soils Conservation and Utilization, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Harbin, China.	Rice has 48 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and the functions of most of these enzymes have not been elucidated. In the present study, a T-DNA insertional mutant named R164, which exhibited a significant decrease in the length of primary and lateral roots, was used as the experimental material to explore the potential function of OsUBC11. Analysis using the SEFA-PCR method showed that the T-DNA insertion was present in the promoter region of OsUBC11 gene, which encodes ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and activates its expression. Biochemical experiments showed that OsUBC11 is a lysine-48-linked ubiquitin chain-forming conjugase. OsUBC11 overexpression lines showed the same root phenotypes. These results demonstrated that OsUBC11 was involved in root development. Further analyses showed that the IAA content of R164 mutant and OE3 line were significantly lower compared with wild-type Zhonghua11. Application of exogenous NAA restored the length of lateral and primary roots in R164 and OsUBC11 overexpression lines. Expression of the auxin synthesis regulating gene OsYUCCA4/6/7/9, the auxin transport gene OsAUX1, auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) family gene OsIAA31, auxin response factor OsARF16 and root regulator key genes, including OsWOX11, OsCRL1, OsCRL5 was significantly down-regulated in OsUBC11 overexpressing plants. Collectively, these results indicate that OsUBC11 modulates auxin signaling, ultimately affecting root development at the rice seedling stage.
