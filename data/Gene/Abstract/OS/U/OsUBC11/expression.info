OsUBC11	 Analysis using the SEFA-PCR method showed that the T-DNA insertion was present in the promoter region of OsUBC11 gene, which encodes ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and activates its expression |  OsUBC11 overexpression lines showed the same root phenotypes |  Application of exogenous NAA restored the length of lateral and primary roots in R164 and OsUBC11 overexpression lines |  Expression of the auxin synthesis regulating gene OsYUCCA4/6/7/9, the auxin transport gene OsAUX1, auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) family gene OsIAA31, auxin response factor OsARF16 and root regulator key genes, including OsWOX11, OsCRL1, OsCRL5 was significantly down-regulated in OsUBC11 overexpressing plants	 OsUBC11 overexpression lines showed the same root phenotypes |  Application of exogenous NAA restored the length of lateral and primary roots in R164 and OsUBC11 overexpression lines
