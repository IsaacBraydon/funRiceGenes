OsUCL8	grain	miRNA MiR408 regulates grain yield and photosynthesis via a phytocyanin protein.	 The knock down or knock out of OsUCL8 also increases grain yield, while the overexpression of OsUCL8 results in an opposite phenotype
OsUCL8	photosynthesis	miRNA MiR408 regulates grain yield and photosynthesis via a phytocyanin protein.	 Further studies revealed that the cleavage of OsUCL8 by miR408 affects copper homeostasis in the plant cell, which in turn affects the abundance of plastocyanin proteins and photosynthesis in rice
OsUCL8	grain yield	miRNA MiR408 regulates grain yield and photosynthesis via a phytocyanin protein.	 The knock down or knock out of OsUCL8 also increases grain yield, while the overexpression of OsUCL8 results in an opposite phenotype
OsUCL8	inflorescence	miRNA MiR408 regulates grain yield and photosynthesis via a phytocyanin protein.	 Spatial and temporal expression analyses showed that OsUCL8 was highly expressed in pistils, young panicles, developing seeds and inflorescence meristem, and was nearly complementary to that of OsmiR408
OsUCL8	homeostasis	miRNA MiR408 regulates grain yield and photosynthesis via a phytocyanin protein.	 Further studies revealed that the cleavage of OsUCL8 by miR408 affects copper homeostasis in the plant cell, which in turn affects the abundance of plastocyanin proteins and photosynthesis in rice
OsUCL8	plasma membrane	miRNA MiR408 regulates grain yield and photosynthesis via a phytocyanin protein.	 Interestingly, the OsUCL8 protein was localized to the cytoplasm, distinctive from a majority of phytocyanins which localize to the plasma membrane
OsUCL8	copper	miRNA MiR408 regulates grain yield and photosynthesis via a phytocyanin protein.	 Further studies revealed that the cleavage of OsUCL8 by miR408 affects copper homeostasis in the plant cell, which in turn affects the abundance of plastocyanin proteins and photosynthesis in rice
