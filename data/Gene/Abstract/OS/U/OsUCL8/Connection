miR408|OsMIR408|OsmiR408	OsUCL8	MiR408 Regulates Grain Yield and Photosynthesis via a Phytocyanin Protein.	 Further studies revealed that the cleavage of OsUCL8 by miR408 affects copper homeostasis in the plant cell, which, in turn, affects the abundance of plastocyanin proteins and photosynthesis in rice
