miR408|OsMIR408|OsmiR408	OsUCL8	MiR408 Regulates Grain Yield and Photosynthesis via a Phytocyanin Protein.	 Further studies revealed that the cleavage of OsUCL8 by miR408 affects copper homeostasis in the plant cell, which, in turn, affects the abundance of plastocyanin proteins and photosynthesis in rice
OsPKIWI|PKIWI502	OsUCL8	Rice UCL8, a plantacyanin gene targeted by miR408, regulates fertility by controlling pollen tube germination and growth.	 Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we revealed that OsUCL8 interacts with the protein OsPKIWI, a homolog of the Arabidopsis FNRL protein
OsPKIWI|PKIWI502	OsUCL8	Rice UCL8, a plantacyanin gene targeted by miR408, regulates fertility by controlling pollen tube germination and growth.	 We thus hypothesized that OsUCL8 might regulate the production of VB components by interacting with OsPKIWI
