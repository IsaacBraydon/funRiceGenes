NA	miRNA MiR408 regulates grain yield and photosynthesis via a phytocyanin protein.	2017	Plant Physiol	Sun Yat-sen University CITY: Guangzhou China [CN].	Increasing grain yield is the most important subject of crop breeding. Here, we report the elevated expression of a conserved microRNA, OsmiR408, could positively regulate grain yield in rice by increasing panicle branches and grain number. We further showed that OsmiR408 regulates grain yield by downregulating its downstream target, OsUCL8, which is an uclacyanin (UCL) gene of the phytocyanin family. The knock down or knock out of OsUCL8 also increases grain yield, while the overexpression of OsUCL8 results in an opposite phenotype. Spatial and temporal expression analyses showed that OsUCL8 was highly expressed in pistils, young panicles, developing seeds and inflorescence meristem, and was nearly complementary to that of OsmiR408. Interestingly, the OsUCL8 protein was localized to the cytoplasm, distinctive from a majority of phytocyanins which localize to the plasma membrane. Further studies revealed that the cleavage of OsUCL8 by miR408 affects copper homeostasis in the plant cell, which in turn affects the abundance of plastocyanin proteins and photosynthesis in rice. This is the first report of the effects of miR408-OsUCL8 in regulating rice photosynthesis and grain yield. Our study further broadens the perspective of miRNAs and UCLs and provides important information for breeding high-yielded crops through genetic engineering.
NA	Rice UCL8, a plantacyanin gene targeted by miR408, regulates fertility by controlling pollen tube germination and growth.	2018	Rice (N Y)	Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, People's Republic of China.	Pollen tube formation and growth are crucial steps that lead to seed production. Despite the importance of pollen tube growth, the molecular mechanisms implicated in its spatial and temporal control are not fully known. In this study, we found an uclacyanin gene, OsUCL8, that regulates pollen intine deposition and pollen tube growth.The overexpression of OsUCL8 led to a striking irregularity in pollen tube growth and pollination and thus affected the seed setting rate in rice; many pollen tubes appeared to lose the ability to grow directly into the style. Conversely, plants with OsUCL8 knocked out and plants overexpressing miR408, a negative regulator of OsUCL8, had vigorous pollens with a higher germination rate. We further demonstrated that OsUCL8 mainly affects pollen intine formation. The addition of Vitamin B1 (VB1) significantly contributed to the germination of OXUCL8 pollen grains, suggesting that OsUCL8 could be associated with VB1 production. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we revealed that OsUCL8 interacts with the protein OsPKIWI, a homolog of the Arabidopsis FNRL protein. We thus hypothesized that OsUCL8 might regulate the production of VB components by interacting with OsPKIWI. This study revealed a novel molecular mechanism of pollen tube growth regulation.The rice plantacyanin family member OsUCL8 plays an important role in pollen tube formation and growth and, in turn, regulates fertility and the seed setting rate.
