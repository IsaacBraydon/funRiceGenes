APIP6	OsUBC26	Rice ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme OsUBC26 is essential for immunity to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae	 Moreover, OsUBC26 working with APIP6 ubiquitinateds AvrPiz-t, an avirulence effector of M
APIP6	OsUBC26	Rice ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme OsUBC26 is essential for immunity to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae	 In summary, OsUBC26 plays important roles in rice disease resistance by regulating WRKY45 expression and working with E3 ligases such as APIP6 to counteract the effector protein AvrPiz-t from M
