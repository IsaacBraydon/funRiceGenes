GW2	OsUBP15|LG1	Ubiquitin Specific Protease 15 Has an Important Role in Regulating Grain Width and Size in Rice	 Genetic data indicated that OsUBP15 and GW2 were not independent in regulating grain width and size
GW2	OsUBP15|LG1	Ubiquitin Specific Protease 15 Has an Important Role in Regulating Grain Width and Size in Rice	 In summary, we identified OsUBP15 as a positive regulator of grain width and size in rice and provide a promising strategy for improvement of grain yield by pyramiding OsUBP15 and gw2
OsDA1	OsUBP15|LG1	Ubiquitin Specific Protease 15 Has an Important Role in Regulating Grain Width and Size in Rice	 Further experiments verified that OsDA1  directly interacted with OsUBP15
