OsUGT706D1	flavone	Differentially evolved glucosyltransferases determine natural variation of rice flavone accumulation and UV-tolerance.	Here, we report that the natural variation of rice flavones is mainly determined by OsUGT706D1 (flavone 7-O-glucosyltransferase) and OsUGT707A2 (flavone 5-O-glucosyltransferase).
