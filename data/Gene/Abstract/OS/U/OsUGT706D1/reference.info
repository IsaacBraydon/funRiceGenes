NA	Differentially evolved glucosyltransferases determine natural variation of rice flavone accumulation and UV-tolerance.	2017	Nat Commun	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Decoration of phytochemicals contributes to the majority of metabolic diversity in nature, whereas how this process alters the biological functions of their precursor molecules remains to be investigated. Flavones, an important yet overlooked subclass of flavonoids, are most commonly conjugated with sugar moieties by UDP-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs). Here, we report that the natural variation of rice flavones is mainly determined by OsUGT706D1 (flavone 7-O-glucosyltransferase) and OsUGT707A2 (flavone 5-O-glucosyltransferase). UV-B exposure and transgenic evaluation demonstrate that their allelic variation contributes to UV-B tolerance in nature. Biochemical characterization of over 40 flavonoid UGTs reveals their differential evolution in angiosperms. These combined data provide biochemical insight and genetic regulation into flavone biosynthesis and additionally suggest that adoption of the positive alleles of these genes into breeding programs will likely represent a potential strategy aimed at producing stress-tolerant plants.
NA	A UV-B-responsive glycosyltransferase, OsUGT706C2, modulates flavonoid metabolism in rice.	2020	Sci China Life Sci	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Although natural variations in rice flavonoids exist, and biochemical characterization of a few flavonoid glycosyltransferases has been reported, few studies focused on natural variations in tricin-lignan-glycosides and their underlying genetic basis. In this study, we carried out metabolic profiling of tricin-lignan-glycosides and identified a major quantitative gene annotated as a UDP-dependent glycosyltransferase OsUGT706C2 by metabolite-based genome-wide association analysis. The putative flavonoid glycosyltransferase OsUGT706C2 was characterized as a flavonoid 7-O-glycosyltransferas in vitro and in vivo. Although the in vitro enzyme activity of OsUGT706C2 was similar to that of OsUGT706D1, the expression pattern and induced expression profile of OsUGT706C2 were very different from those of OsUGT706D1. Besides, OsUGT706C2 was specifically induced by UV-B. Constitutive expression of OsUGT706C2 in rice may modulate phenylpropanoid metabolism at both the transcript and metabolite levels. Furthermore, overexpressing OsUGT706C2 can enhance UV-B tolerance by promoting ROS scavenging in rice. Our findings might make it possible to use the glycosyltransferase OsUGT706C2 for crop improvement with respect to UV-B adaptation and/or flavonoid accumulation, which may contribute to stable yield.
