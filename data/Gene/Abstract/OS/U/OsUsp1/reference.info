Sequence analysis revealed that OsUSP1 is most closely related to the bacterial MJ0577-type of ATP-binding USP proteins which have been suggested to act as a molecular switch. USP protein homologues appear to be ubiquitous in plants and are encoded by gene families, but are absent in animal species. In the youngest internode of deepwater rice plants, OsUsp1 expression was very strongly induced within 1 h of submergence. Elevated transcript levels were observed in dividing cells, in expanding cells and in differentiated tissue indicating that USP1 mediates a general process. Gene induction was shown to be regulated by ethylene with a highly similar expression pattern to that observed with submergence treatment. Based on sequence information and on expression data it is hypothesized that OsUSP1 plays a role in ethylene-mediated stress adaptation in rice.
