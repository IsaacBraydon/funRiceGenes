OsUsp1	submergence	The novel ethylene-regulated gene OsUsp1 from rice encodes a member of a plant protein family related to prokaryotic universal stress proteins	"Using subtractive hybridization a submergence-induced gene was identified from deepwater rice, OsUsp1, that encodes a homologue of the bacterial universal stress protein family| In the youngest internode of deepwater rice plants, OsUsp1 expression was very strongly induced within 1 h of submergence"
OsUsp1	ethylene	The novel ethylene-regulated gene OsUsp1 from rice encodes a member of a plant protein family related to prokaryotic universal stress proteins	 Based on sequence information and on expression data it is hypothesized that OsUSP1 plays a role in ethylene-mediated stress adaptation in rice|The novel ethylene-regulated gene OsUsp1 from rice encodes a member of a plant protein family related to prokaryotic universal stress proteins
