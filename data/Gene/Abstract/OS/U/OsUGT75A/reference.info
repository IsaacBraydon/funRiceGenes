Submergence stress represents a major obstacle limiting the application of direct seeding in rice cultivation. Under flooding conditions, coleoptile elongation can function as an escape strategy that contributes to submergence tolerance during seed germination in rice; however, the underlying molecular bases have yet to be fully determined. Herein, we report that natural variation of rice coleoptile length subjected to submergence is determined by the glucosyltransferase encoding gene OsUGT75A. OsUGT75A regulates coleoptile length via decreasing free abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) levels by promoting glycosylation of these two phytohormones under submergence. Moreover, we find that OsUGT75A accelerates coleoptile length through mediating the interactions between JASMONATE ZIMDOMAIN (OsJAZ) and ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE (OsABI) proteins. Last, we reveal the origin of the haplotype that contributes to coleoptile length in response to submergence and transferring this haplotype to indica rice can enhance coleoptile length in submergence conditions. Thus, we propose that OsUGT75A is a useful target in breeding of rice varieties suitable for direct seeding cultivation.
