OsUGT75A	submergence	UDP-glucosyltransferase OsUGT75A promotes submergence tolerance during rice seed germination.	UDP-glucosyltransferase OsUGT75A promotes submergence tolerance during rice seed germination.
OsUGT75A	submergence	UDP-glucosyltransferase OsUGT75A promotes submergence tolerance during rice seed germination.	 Herein, we report that natural variation of rice coleoptile length subjected to submergence is determined by the glucosyltransferase encoding gene OsUGT75A
OsUGT75A	submergence	UDP-glucosyltransferase OsUGT75A promotes submergence tolerance during rice seed germination.	 OsUGT75A regulates coleoptile length via decreasing free abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) levels by promoting glycosylation of these two phytohormones under submergence
OsUGT75A	seed	UDP-glucosyltransferase OsUGT75A promotes submergence tolerance during rice seed germination.	UDP-glucosyltransferase OsUGT75A promotes submergence tolerance during rice seed germination.
