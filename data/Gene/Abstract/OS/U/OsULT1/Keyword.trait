OsULT1	abscisic acid	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	Interactions of OsTCP19 with OsABI4 and OsULT1 further suggest its function in modulation of abscisic acid pathways and chromatin structure
OsULT1	methyltransferase	Rice Trithorax factor ULTRAPETALA 1 (OsULT1) specifically binds to &quot;GAGAG&quot; sequence motif present in Polycomb response elements.	 Moreover, OsULT1 interacts with rice SET domain-containing methyltransferase TRX1, suggesting OsULT1 is an integral part of plant Trithorax group complex
