NA	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	2015	Sci Rep	National Institute of Plant Genome Research, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi. 110067, India.	Class-I TCP transcription factors are plant-specific developmental regulators. In this study, the role of one such rice gene, OsTCP19, in water-deficit and salt stress response was explored. Besides a general upregulation by abiotic stresses, this transcript was more abundant in tolerant than sensitive rice genotypes during early hours of stress. Stress, tissue and genotype-dependent retention of a small in-frame intron in this transcript was also observed. Overexpression of OsTCP19 in Arabidopsis caused upregulation of IAA3, ABI3 and ABI4 and downregulation of LOX2, and led to developmental abnormalities like fewer lateral root formation. Moreover, decrease in water loss and reactive oxygen species, and hyperaccumulation of lipid droplets in the transgenics contributed to better stress tolerance both during seedling establishment and in mature plants. OsTCP19 was also shown to directly regulate a rice triacylglycerol biosynthesis gene in transient assays. Genes similar to those up- or downregulated in the transgenics were accordingly found to coexpress positively and negatively with OsTCP19 in Rice Oligonucleotide Array Database. Interactions of OsTCP19 with OsABI4 and OsULT1 further suggest its function in modulation of abscisic acid pathways and chromatin structure. Thus, OsTCP19 appears to be an important node in cell signaling which crosslinks stress and developmental pathways.
NA	Rice Trithorax factor ULTRAPETALA 1 (OsULT1) specifically binds to &quot;GAGAG&quot; sequence motif present in Polycomb response elements.	2019	Biochim Biophys Acta Gene Regul Mech	Division of Plant Biology, Bose Institute, Kolkata 700054, India; Department of Biochemistry, University of Calcutta, Kolkata 700019, India.	Co-ordinated interplay between Polycomb group (PcG) and Trithorax group (TrxG) of proteins regulate chromatin state and maintain the transcription &quot;off&quot; and &quot;on&quot; state of a gene in higher eukaryotes. Targeting PcG complex to a specific locus is mediated by DNA sequences known as Polycomb response elements. Interestingly, these PREs are also recognized by TrxG proteins to antagonise PcG mediated gene repression. In this study, we have characterised DNA binding property of rice trithorax group factor ULTRAPETALA1 (OsULT1) which has a SAND domain and B-box motif. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicates cold induced enrichment of OsULT1 occupancy and a decrease in H3K27me3 mark in the promoter region of OsDREB1b gene, during transcription activation. OsULT1 binds to the cis motif &quot;GAGAG&quot;, and the sequence specificity is contributed mainly by the SAND domain. GAGAG is one of the cis motifs present in PREs that are recognized by Drosophila GAGA factor and Pipsqueak. Thus, binding of OsULT1 to GAGAG motif, along with a decrease in H3K27me3 suggests that OsULT1 antagonises the repressive effect of PcG complex for transcriptional activation of OsDREB1b. Moreover, OsULT1 interacts with rice SET domain-containing methyltransferase TRX1, suggesting OsULT1 is an integral part of plant Trithorax group complex. Furthermore, the increase in ULT1 levels during environmental cues suggests its involvement in the transcriptional regulation of stress responsive genes. Collectively, these results suggest that the antagonistic functions of PcG and TrxG proteins and the mechanism of recruitment of these complexes to target loci are evolutionarily conserved for gene expression regulation across kingdoms.
