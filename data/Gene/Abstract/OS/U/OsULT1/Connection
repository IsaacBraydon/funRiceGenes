OsTCP19	OsULT1	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways	Interactions of OsTCP19 with OsABI4 and OsULT1 further suggest its function in modulation of abscisic acid pathways and chromatin structure
OsDREB1B	OsULT1	Rice Trithorax factor ULTRAPETALA 1 (OsULT1) specifically binds to &quot;GAGAG&quot; sequence motif present in Polycomb response elements.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicates cold induced enrichment of OsULT1 occupancy and a decrease in H3K27me3 mark in the promoter region of OsDREB1b gene, during transcription activation
OsDREB1B	OsULT1	Rice Trithorax factor ULTRAPETALA 1 (OsULT1) specifically binds to &quot;GAGAG&quot; sequence motif present in Polycomb response elements.	 Thus, binding of OsULT1 to GAGAG motif, along with a decrease in H3K27me3 suggests that OsULT1 antagonises the repressive effect of PcG complex for transcriptional activation of OsDREB1b
