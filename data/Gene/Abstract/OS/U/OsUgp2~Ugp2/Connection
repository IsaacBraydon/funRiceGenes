OsUgp1|Ugp1|UGPase1	OsUgp2|Ugp2	UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase2 (OsUgp2), a pollen-preferential gene in rice, plays a critical role in starch accumulation during pollen maturation	Two homologous UGPase genes, OsUgp1 and OsUgp2, exist in rice genome
OsUgp1|Ugp1|UGPase1	OsUgp2|Ugp2	UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase2 (OsUgp2), a pollen-preferential gene in rice, plays a critical role in starch accumulation during pollen maturation	OsUgp2 complements OsUgp1 to fulfill the UGPaseâ€™s functions necessary for the full process of pollen development
OsUgp1|Ugp1|UGPase1	OsUgp2|Ugp2	Rice UDP-Glucose Pyrophosphorylase1 Is Essential for Pollen Callose Deposition and Its Cosuppression Results in a New Type of Thermosensitive Genic Male Sterility	The rice (Oryza sativa) genome contains two homologous UGPase genes, Ugp1 and Ugp2
OsUgp1|Ugp1|UGPase1	OsUgp2|Ugp2	Rice UDP-Glucose Pyrophosphorylase1 Is Essential for Pollen Callose Deposition and Its Cosuppression Results in a New Type of Thermosensitive Genic Male Sterility	Expressing a double-stranded RNA interference construct in Ugp1-RI plants resulted in complete suppression of both Ugp1 and Ugp2, together with various pleiotropic developmental abnormalities, suggesting that UGPase plays critical roles in plant growth and development
