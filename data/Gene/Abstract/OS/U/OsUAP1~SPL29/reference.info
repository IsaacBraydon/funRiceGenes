NA	Functional inactivation of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1) induces early leaf senescence and defence responses in rice	2014	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Hubei, 430072, China.	Plant leaf senescence and defence responses are important biological processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved are not well understood. This study identified a new rice mutant, spotted leaf 29 (spl29). The SPL29 gene was identified by map-based cloning, and SPL29 was confirmed as UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1) by enzymatic analysis. The mutant spl29 lacks UAP activity. The biological phenotypes for which UAP is responsible have not previously been reported in plants. The spl29 mutant displayed early leaf senescence, confirmed by chlorophyll loss and photosystem II decline as physiological indicators, chloroplast degradation as a cellular characteristic, and both upregulation of senescence transcription factors and senescence-associated genes, and downregulation of photosynthesis-related genes, as molecular evidence. Defence responses were induced in the spl29 mutant, shown by enhanced resistance to bacterial blight inoculation and upregulation of defence response genes. Reactive oxygen species, including O2 - and H2O2, accumulated in spl29 plants; there was also increased malondialdehyde content. Enhanced superoxide dismutase activity combined with normal catalase activity in spl29 could be responsible for H2O2 accumulation. The plant hormones jasmonic acid and abscisic acid also accumulated in spl29 plants. ROS and plant hormones probably play important roles in early leaf senescence and defence responses in the spl29 mutant. Based on these findings, it is suggested that UAP1 is involved in regulating leaf senescence and defence responses in rice.
NA	UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase enhances rice survival at high temperature.	2021	New Phytol	State Key Lab of Rice Biology, National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, P. R. China.	‚Äêı<U+3E32> High-temperature stress inhibits normal cellular processes and results in abnormal growth and development in plants. However, the mechanisms by which rice (Oryza sativa) copes with high temperature are not yet fully understood. ‚Äêı<U+3E32> In this study, we identified a rice high temperature enhanced lesion spots 1 (hes1) mutant, which displayed larger and more dense necrotic spots under high temperature. HES1 encoded a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase, which had the UGPase enzymatic activity. RNA sequencing analysis showed that photosystem-related genes were differentially expressed in the hes1 mutant under different temperatures, indicating that HES1 plays essential roles in maintaining chloroplast function. HES1 expression was induced under high temperature. ‚Äêı<U+3E32> Furthermore, loss of function of HES1 affected the HSFs expression and its mutation exhibited greater vulnerability to high temperature. Several experiments revealed that higher accumulation of reactive oxygen species occurred in the hes1 mutant under high temperature. TUNEL and comet experiments indicated that the hes1 undergo more severe DNA damage under high temperature. The determination of chlorophyll content and chloroplast¬†ultrastructure showed more severe photosystem-defects occurred in the hes1 mutant under high temperature. ‚Äêı<U+3E32> This study reveals that HES1 plays a key role in adaptation to high-temperature stress in rice.
