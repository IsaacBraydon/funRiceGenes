The ubiquitin-26S proteasome system is important in the quality control of intracellular proteins. The ubiquitin-26S proteasome system includes the E1 (ubiquitin activating), E2 (ubiquitin conjugating), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase) enzymes. U-box proteins are a derived version of RING-finger domains, which have E3 enzyme activity. Here, we present the isolation of a novel U-box protein, U-box containing E3 ligase induced by phosphate starvation (OsUPS), from rice (Oryza sativa). The cDNA encoding the O. sativa U-box protein (OsUPS) comprises 1338 bp, with an open reading frame of 445 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of OsUPS cDNA shows 41-79% identity with other plant U-box homologous genes. The open reading frame of the OsUPS protein is comprised of notable domains: a single ~70-amino acid domain and a GKL domain that contains conserved glycine, lysine/arginine residues and leucine-rich feature. We found that full-length expression of OsUPS was up-regulated in both rice plants and cell culture in the absence of inorganic phosphate (P(i)). A self-ubiquitination assay indicated that the bacterially expressed OsUPS protein had E3 ligase activity, and subcellular localization results showed that OsUPS was located in the chloroplast. These results support the notion that OsUPS plays an important role in the P(i) signaling pathway through the ubiquitin-26S proteasome system.
NA	Overexpression of OsPUB41, a Rice E3 ubiquitin ligase induced by cell wall degrading enzymes, enhances immune responses in Rice and Arabidopsis.	2019	BMC Plant Biol	CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Uppal Road, Hyderabad, 500007, India.	Cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) induce plant immune responses and E3 ubiquitin ligases are known to play important roles in regulating plant defenses. Expression of the rice E3 ubiquitin ligase, OsPUB41, is enhanced upon treatment of leaves with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) secreted CWDEs such as Cellulase and Lipase/Esterase. However, it is not reported to have a role in elicitation of immune responses.Expression of the rice E3 ubiquitin ligase, OsPUB41, is induced when rice leaves are treated with either CWDEs, pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or pathogens. Overexpression of OsPUB41 leads to induction of callose deposition, enhanced tolerance to Xoo and Rhizoctonia solani infection in rice and Arabidopsis respectively. In rice, transient overexpression of OsPUB41 leads to enhanced expression of PR genes and SA as well as JA biosynthetic and response genes. However, in Arabidopsis, ectopic expression of OsPUB41 results in upregulation of only JA biosynthetic and response genes. Transient overexpression of either of the two biochemically inactive mutants (OsPUB41C40A and OsPUB41V51R) of OsPUB41 in rice and stable transgenics in Arabidopsis ectopically expressing OsPUB41C40A failed to elicit immune responses. This indicates that the E3 ligase activity of OsPUB41 protein is essential for induction of plant defense responses.The results presented here suggest that OsPUB41 is possibly involved in elicitation of CWDE triggered immune responses in rice.
NA	OsPUB41, a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase, acts as a negative regulator of drought stress response in rice (Oryza Sativa L.)	2021	Plant Mol Biol	Department of Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea. es1106@yonsei.ac.kr.	OsPUB41 plays a negative role in drought stress response through the mediation of OsUBC25 and interacts with OsCLC6, suggesting a putative substrate. The notable expansion of Plant U-Box E3 ligases (PUB), compared with those in mammals, implies that PUB proteins have evolved to perform plant-specific functions. OsPUB41, a potential ortholog of CMPG1, was recently reported to regulate the cell wall degrading enzyme (CWDE)-induced innate immune response in rice. Here, we characterized the OsPUB41 gene, which encodes a dual-localized cytosolic and nuclear U-box E3 ligase in rice. OsPUB41 expression was specifically induced by dehydration among various abiotic stresses and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. Furthermore, we revealed that the core U-box motif of OsPUB41 possesses the E3 ligase activity that can be activated by OsUBC25 in rice. The Ubi:RNAi-OsPUB41 knock-down and ospub41 suppression mutant plants exhibited enhanced tolerance to drought stress compared with the wild-type rice plants in terms of transpirational water loss, long-term dehydration response, and chlorophyll content. Moreover, the knock-down or suppression of the OsPUB41 gene did not cause adverse effect on rice yield-related traits. Yeast two-hybrid and an in vitro pull-down analyses revealed that OsCLC6, a chloride channel, is a putative substrate of OsPUB41. Overall, these results suggest that OsPUB41 acts as a negative regulator of dehydration conditions and interacts with OsCLC6, implying that it is a substrate of OsPUB41.
