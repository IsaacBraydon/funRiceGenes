OsUBC13	resistance	Rice ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme OsUbc13 negatively regulates immunity against pathogens by enhancing the activity of OsSnRK1a.	 Strikingly, OsUbc13 directly interacts with OsSnRK1a, which is the α catalytic subunit of SnRK1 (sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase-1) and acts as a positive regulator of broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice
