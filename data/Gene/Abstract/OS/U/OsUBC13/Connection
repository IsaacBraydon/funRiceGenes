OsUBC13	WTG1|OsOTUB1|GWC1	Non-canonical regulation of SPL transcription factors by a human OTUB1-like deubiquitinase defines a new plant type rice associated with higher grain yield.	 OsOTUB1 interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating protein OsUBC13 and the squamosa promoter-binding protein-like transcription factor OsSPL14
OsUBC13	OsUEV1B	OsUEV1B, an Ubc enzyme variant protein, is required for phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant protein OsUEV1B was previously found to interact with OsUbc13 and mediate lysine63-linked polyubiquitination
