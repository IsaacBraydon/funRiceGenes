OsUBC13	WTG1|OsOTUB1|GWC1	Non-canonical regulation of SPL transcription factors by a human OTUB1-like deubiquitinase defines a new plant type rice associated with higher grain yield.	 OsOTUB1 interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating protein OsUBC13 and the squamosa promoter-binding protein-like transcription factor OsSPL14
OsUBC13	OsUEV1B	OsUEV1B, an Ubc enzyme variant protein, is required for phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant protein OsUEV1B was previously found to interact with OsUbc13 and mediate lysine63-linked polyubiquitination
OsUBC13	SnRK1A|OsSnRK1a|OsSnRK1A1	Rice ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme OsUbc13 negatively regulates immunity against pathogens by enhancing the activity of OsSnRK1a.	Rice ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme OsUbc13 negatively regulates immunity against pathogens by enhancing the activity of OsSnRK1a.
OsUBC13	SnRK1A|OsSnRK1a|OsSnRK1A1	Rice ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme OsUbc13 negatively regulates immunity against pathogens by enhancing the activity of OsSnRK1a.	 Strikingly, OsUbc13 directly interacts with OsSnRK1a, which is the Î± catalytic subunit of SnRK1 (sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase-1) and acts as a positive regulator of broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice
OsUBC13	SnRK1A|OsSnRK1a|OsSnRK1A1	Rice ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme OsUbc13 negatively regulates immunity against pathogens by enhancing the activity of OsSnRK1a.	 Our data demonstrate OsUbc13 negatively regulates immunity against pathogens by enhancing the activity of OsSnRK1a
