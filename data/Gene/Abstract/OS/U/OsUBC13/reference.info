In addition, many environmental chemicals can also damage the plant genome. In yeast and mammalian cells protection against the above genome instability is provided by an error-free DNA-damage tolerance (DDT) pathway, which is dependent on Ubc13-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In this study, we isolated the UBC13 gene from rice and characterized its functions. Expression of OsUBC13 can protect a yeast ubc13 null mutant against spontaneous and environmental DNA damage. Furthermore, OsUbc13 physically interacts with human Ubc13 partners Mms2 and Uev1A, and catalyzes K63 polyubiquitination in vitro. These observations collectively suggest that the K63 polyubiquitination is conserved in rice, and that OsUBC13 may be involved in DDT and other cellular processes. In addition, OsUBC13 is constitutively expressed at a high level even under various stress conditions, suggesting that it is a housekeeping gene.
NA	Rice ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme OsUbc13 negatively regulates immunity against pathogens by enhancing the activity of OsSnRK1a.	2023	Plant Biotechnol J	Center for Plant Water-use and Nutrition Regulation and College of Resources and Environment, Joint International Research Laboratory of Water and Nutrient in Crop, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China.	Ubc13 is required for Lys63-linked polyubiquitination and innate immune responses in mammals, but its functions in plant immunity still remain largely unknown. Here, we used molecular biological, pathological, biochemical, and genetic approaches to evaluate the roles of rice OsUbc13 in response to pathogens. The OsUbc13-RNA interference (RNAi) lines with lesion mimic phenotypes displayed a and chitin-induced reactive oxygen species, and in defence-related genes expression or hormones as well as resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. Strikingly, OsUbc13 directly interacts with OsSnRK1a, which is the Î± catalytic subunit of SnRK1 (sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase-1) and acts as a positive regulator of broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice. In the OsUbc13-RNAi plants, although the protein level of OsSnRK1a did not change, its activity and ABA sensitivity were obviously enhanced, and the K63-linked polyubiquitination was weaker than that of wild-type Dongjin (DJ). Overexpression of the deubiquitinase-encoding gene OsOTUB1.1 produced similar effects with inhibition of OsUbc13 in affecting immunity responses, M. oryzae resistance, OsSnRK1a ubiquitination, and OsSnRK1a activity. Furthermore, re-interfering with OsSnRK1a in one OsUbc13-RNAi line (Ri-3) partially restored its M. oryzae resistance to a level between those of Ri-3 and DJ. Our data demonstrate OsUbc13 negatively regulates immunity against pathogens by enhancing the activity of OsSnRK1a.
