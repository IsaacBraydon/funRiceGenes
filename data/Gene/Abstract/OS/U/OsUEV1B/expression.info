OsUEV1B	 Under sufficient Pi conditions, similar to osuev1b, a mutation in OsVDAC1 resulted in significantly greater Pi concentrations in the roots and second leaves, improved acid phosphatase activity, and enhanced expression of the Pi starvation inducible and phosphate transporter genes compared with wild-type DongJin, whereas overexpression of OsVDAC1 had the opposite effects |  Moreover, overexpression of OsVDAC1 in osuev1b partially restored its high Pi concentration to a level between those of osuev1b and DongJin	 Under sufficient Pi conditions, similar to osuev1b, a mutation in OsVDAC1 resulted in significantly greater Pi concentrations in the roots and second leaves, improved acid phosphatase activity, and enhanced expression of the Pi starvation inducible and phosphate transporter genes compared with wild-type DongJin, whereas overexpression of OsVDAC1 had the opposite effects |  Moreover, overexpression of OsVDAC1 in osuev1b partially restored its high Pi concentration to a level between those of osuev1b and DongJin	 Both osuev1b mutant and OsUEV1B-RNA interference (RNAi) lines displayed serious symptoms of toxicity due to Pi overaccumulation |  Some Pi starvation inducible and phosphate transporter genes were upregulated in osuev1b mutant and OsUEV1B-RNAi plants in association with enhanced Pi acquisition, and representative Pi starvation responses, including stimulation of acid phosphatase activity and root hair growth, were also activated in the presence of sufficient Pi
