OsUEV1B	root	OsUEV1B, an Ubc enzyme variant protein, is required for phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 Some Pi starvation inducible and phosphate transporter genes were upregulated in osuev1b mutant and OsUEV1B-RNAi plants in association with enhanced Pi acquisition, and representative Pi starvation responses, including stimulation of acid phosphatase activity and root hair growth, were also activated in the presence of sufficient Pi
