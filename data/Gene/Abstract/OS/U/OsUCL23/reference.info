NA	OsmiR528 regulates rice-pollen intine formation by targeting an uclacyanin to influence flavonoid metabolism.	2019	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-Sen University, 510275 Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.	The intine, the inner layer of the pollen wall, is essential for the normal development and germination of pollen. However, the composition and developmental regulation of the intine in rice (Oryza sativa) remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a microRNA, OsmiR528, which regulates the formation of the pollen intine and thus male fertility in rice. The mir528 knockout mutant aborted pollen development at the late binucleate pollen stage, significantly decreasing the seed-setting rate. We further demonstrated that OsmiR528 affects pollen development by directly targeting the uclacyanin gene OsUCL23 (encoding a member of the plant-specific blue copper protein family of phytocyanins) and regulating intine deposition. OsUCL23 overexpression phenocopied the mir528 mutant. The OsUCL23 protein localized in the prevacuolar compartments (PVCs) and multivesicular bodies (MVBs). We further revealed that OsUCL23 interacts with a member of the proton-dependent oligopeptide transport (POT) family of transporters to regulate various metabolic components, especially flavonoids. We propose a model in which OsmiR528 regulates pollen intine formation by directly targeting OsUCL23 and in which OsUCL23 interacts with the POT protein on the PVCs and MVBs to regulate the production of metabolites during pollen development. The study thus reveals the functions of OsmiR528 and an uclacyanin during pollen development.
NA	Gene Expression Dynamics in Rice Peduncles at the Heading Stage	2020	Front Genet	Grass Genetics and Informatics Group, School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.	Improving grain yield in the staple food crop rice has been long sought goal of plant biotechnology. One of the traits with significant impact on rice breeding programs is peduncle elongation at the time of heading failing which leads to significant reduction in grain yield due to incomplete panicle exsertion. To decipher transcriptional dynamics and molecular players underlying peduncle elongation, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of elongating and non-elongating peduncles in two Indian cultivars, Swarna and Pokkali, at the time of heading. Along with genes associated with cell division and cell wall biosynthesis, we observed significant enrichment of genes associated with auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis/signaling in the elongating peduncles before heading in both the genotypes. Similarly, genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and mobilization, abiotic stress response along with cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene biosynthesis/signaling were enriched in non-elongating peduncles post heading. Significant enrichment of genes belonging to key transcription factor families highlights their specialized roles in peduncle elongation and grain filling before and after heading, respectively. A comparison with anther/pollen development-related genes provided 76 candidates with overlapping roles in anther/pollen development and peduncle elongation. Some of these are important for carbohydrate remobilization to the developing grains. These can be engineered to combat with incomplete panicle exsertion in male sterile lines and manipulate carbohydrate dynamics in grasses. Overall, this study provides baseline information about potential target genes for engineering peduncle elongation with implications on plant height, biomass composition and grain yields in rice.
