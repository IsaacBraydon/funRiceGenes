The intine, the inner layer of the pollen wall, is essential for the normal development and germination of pollen. However, the composition and developmental regulation of the intine in rice (Oryza sativa) remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a microRNA, OsmiR528, which regulates the formation of the pollen intine and thus male fertility in rice. The mir528 knockout mutant aborted pollen development at the late binucleate pollen stage, significantly decreasing the seed-setting rate. We further demonstrated that OsmiR528 affects pollen development by directly targeting the uclacyanin gene OsUCL23 (encoding a member of the plant-specific blue copper protein family of phytocyanins) and regulating intine deposition. OsUCL23 overexpression phenocopied the mir528 mutant. The OsUCL23 protein localized in the prevacuolar compartments (PVCs) and multivesicular bodies (MVBs). We further revealed that OsUCL23 interacts with a member of the proton-dependent oligopeptide transport (POT) family of transporters to regulate various metabolic components, especially flavonoids. We propose a model in which OsmiR528 regulates pollen intine formation by directly targeting OsUCL23 and in which OsUCL23 interacts with the POT protein on the PVCs and MVBs to regulate the production of metabolites during pollen development. The study thus reveals the functions of OsmiR528 and an uclacyanin during pollen development.
