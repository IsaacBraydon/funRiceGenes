OsOAT	oxidative	An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice	" In addition, OsOAT-overexpressing plants showed significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress|An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice"
OsOAT	transcription factor	An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice	 We confirmed that OsOAT is a direct target of the stress-responsive NAC transcription factor SNAC2
OsOAT	growth	An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice	 Overexpression of OsOAT caused significantly increased delta-OAT activity and Pro accumulation under normal growth conditions
OsOAT	drought	An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice	 Both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways contributed to the drought-induced expression of OsOAT| Overexpression of the OsOAT gene in rice resulted in significantly enhanced drought and osmotic stress tolerance|An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice
OsOAT	phytohormone	An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice	 OsOAT is responsive to multiple stresses and phytohormone treatments
