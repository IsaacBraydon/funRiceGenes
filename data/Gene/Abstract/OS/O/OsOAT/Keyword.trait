OsOAT	oxidative	An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice	In addition, OsOAT-overexpressing plants showed significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress
OsOAT	oxidative	An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice	An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice
OsOAT	transcription factor	An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice	We confirmed that OsOAT is a direct target of the stress-responsive NAC transcription factor SNAC2
OsOAT	growth	An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice	Overexpression of OsOAT caused significantly increased delta-OAT activity and Pro accumulation under normal growth conditions
OsOAT	drought	An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice	Both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways contributed to the drought-induced expression of OsOAT
OsOAT	drought	An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice	Overexpression of the OsOAT gene in rice resulted in significantly enhanced drought and osmotic stress tolerance
OsOAT	drought	An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice	An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice
OsOAT	phytohormone	An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice	OsOAT is responsive to multiple stresses and phytohormone treatments
OsOAT	nitrogen	Ornithine ¦Ä-aminotransferase is critical for floret development and seed setting through mediating nitrogen reutilization in rice.	 In the Osoat mutant, metabolic abnormality induced by nitrogen deficiency in floret causes malformed glumes, incapable glume opening and anther indehiscence
OsOAT	nitrogen	Ornithine ¦Ä-aminotransferase is critical for floret development and seed setting through mediating nitrogen reutilization in rice.	 Therefore, OsOAT is crucial for nitrogen reutilization and plays a critical role in floret development and seed setting in rice
OsOAT	anther	Ornithine ¦Ä-aminotransferase is critical for floret development and seed setting through mediating nitrogen reutilization in rice.	 In the Osoat mutant, metabolic abnormality induced by nitrogen deficiency in floret causes malformed glumes, incapable glume opening and anther indehiscence
OsOAT	development	Ornithine ¦Ä-aminotransferase is critical for floret development and seed setting through mediating nitrogen reutilization in rice.	 Therefore, OsOAT is crucial for nitrogen reutilization and plays a critical role in floret development and seed setting in rice
