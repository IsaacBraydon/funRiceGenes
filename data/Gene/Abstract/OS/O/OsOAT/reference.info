Ornithine delta-aminotransferase (delta-OAT) is a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme that has been proposed to be involved in proline (Pro) and arginine (Arg) metabolism. However, the actual role of delta-OAT in abiotic responses in plants remains to be clarified. Here we characterized an ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT that confers multi-stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa). We confirmed that OsOAT is a direct target of the stress-responsive NAC transcription factor SNAC2. OsOAT is responsive to multiple stresses and phytohormone treatments. Both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways contributed to the drought-induced expression of OsOAT. Overexpression of the OsOAT gene in rice resulted in significantly enhanced drought and osmotic stress tolerance. Overexpression of OsOAT caused significantly increased delta-OAT activity and Pro accumulation under normal growth conditions. In addition, OsOAT-overexpressing plants showed significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress. The glutathione (GSH) content and activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase, were also increased in OsOAT-overexpressing plants. We conclude that OsOAT is a target gene of SNAC2 and confers stress tolerance mainly through enhancing ROS-scavenging capacity and Pro pre-accumulation.
NA	Ornithine ¦Ä-aminotransferase is critical for floret development and seed setting through mediating nitrogen reutilization in rice.	2018	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Nitrogen is one of the most important nutrient element that is essential for plant growth and development. Many genes have been reported to contribute to nitrogen absorption and transportation. However, genes involved in nitrogen reutilization are seldom reported. Ornithine ¦Ä-aminotransferase (¦ÄOAT) is the enzyme connecting arginine cycling and proline cycling. Here, we found that OsOAT, the homologue of ¦ÄOAT in rice, is essential for nitrogen reutilization through mediating arginase activity. In the Osoat mutant, metabolic abnormality induced by nitrogen deficiency in floret causes malformed glumes, incapable glume opening and anther indehiscence. These defects in the mutant affect the pollination process and lead to a low seed setting rate as well as abnormal seed shape. Intriguingly, urea can rescue the phenotypes of the Osoat mutant. Therefore, OsOAT is crucial for nitrogen reutilization and plays a critical role in floret development and seed setting in rice. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
