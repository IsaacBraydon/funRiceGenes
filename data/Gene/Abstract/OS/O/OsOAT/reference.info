You-2012-An ornithine delta-a.pdf	An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice	2012	Plant Sci	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Ornithine delta-aminotransferase (delta-OAT) is a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme that has been proposed to be involved in proline (Pro) and arginine (Arg) metabolism. However, the actual role of delta-OAT in abiotic responses in plants remains to be clarified. Here we characterized an ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT that confers multi-stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa). We confirmed that OsOAT is a direct target of the stress-responsive NAC transcription factor SNAC2. OsOAT is responsive to multiple stresses and phytohormone treatments. Both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways contributed to the drought-induced expression of OsOAT. Overexpression of the OsOAT gene in rice resulted in significantly enhanced drought and osmotic stress tolerance. Overexpression of OsOAT caused significantly increased delta-OAT activity and Pro accumulation under normal growth conditions. In addition, OsOAT-overexpressing plants showed significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress. The glutathione (GSH) content and activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase, were also increased in OsOAT-overexpressing plants. We conclude that OsOAT is a target gene of SNAC2 and confers stress tolerance mainly through enhancing ROS-scavenging capacity and Pro pre-accumulation.
NA	Ornithine ¦Ä-aminotransferase is critical for floret development and seed setting through mediating nitrogen reutilization in rice.	2018	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Nitrogen is one of the most important nutrient element that is essential for plant growth and development. Many genes have been reported to contribute to nitrogen absorption and transportation. However, genes involved in nitrogen reutilization are seldom reported. Ornithine ¦Ä-aminotransferase (¦ÄOAT) is the enzyme connecting arginine cycling and proline cycling. Here, we found that OsOAT, the homologue of ¦ÄOAT in rice, is essential for nitrogen reutilization through mediating arginase activity. In the Osoat mutant, metabolic abnormality induced by nitrogen deficiency in floret causes malformed glumes, incapable glume opening and anther indehiscence. These defects in the mutant affect the pollination process and lead to a low seed setting rate as well as abnormal seed shape. Intriguingly, urea can rescue the phenotypes of the Osoat mutant. Therefore, OsOAT is crucial for nitrogen reutilization and plays a critical role in floret development and seed setting in rice. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
NA	Ornithine Î´-aminotransferase OsOAT is critical for male fertility and cold tolerance during rice plant development.	2023	Plant J	Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Plant Development, School of Life Sciences, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, 510631, China.	Cold stress is a major factor limiting the production and geographical distribution of rice (Oryza sativa) varieties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying cold tolerance remain to be elucidated. Here, we report that ornithine Î´-aminotransferase (OsOAT) contributes to cold tolerance during the vegetative and reproductive development of rice. osoat mutant was identified as a temperature-sensitive male sterile mutant with deformed floral organs and seedlings sensitive to cold stress. Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that OsOAT mutation and cold treatment of the wild-type plant led to similar changes in the global gene expression profiles in anthers. OsOAT genes in indica rice Huanghuazhan (HHZ) and japonica rice Wuyungeng (WYG) are different in gene structure and response to cold. OsOAT is cold-inducible in WYG but cold-irresponsive in HHZ. Further studies showed that indica varieties carry both WYG-type and HHZ-type OsOAT, whereas japonica varieties mostly carry WYG-type OsOAT. Cultivars carrying HHZ-type OsOAT are mainly distributed in low-latitude and high-latitude regions. Moreover, indica varieties carrying WYG-type OsOAT generally have higher seed-setting rates than those carrying HHZ-type OsOAT under cold stress at reproductive stage, highlighting the favorable selection for WYG-type OsOAT during domestication and breeding to cope with low temperatures.
