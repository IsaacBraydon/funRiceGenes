OsOPL1	grain	Rice co-expression network analysis identifies gene modules associated with agronomic traits.	 As an example, we identified a candidate gene, OsOPL1 (OCTOPUS-LIKE 1), a homologue of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) OPS (OCTOPUS) gene, from a grain size module and verified it as a regulator of grain size via functional studies
