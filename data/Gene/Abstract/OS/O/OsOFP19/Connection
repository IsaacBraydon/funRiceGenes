DLT|OsGRAS-32|D62|GS6|SMOS2	OsOFP19	OsOFP19 modulates plant architecture by integrating cell division pattern and brassinosteroid signaling.	 Here, we report that OsOFP19 negatively modulates brassinosteroid (BR) response and integrates it with cell division pattern to affect plant architecture, including grain shape, through interaction with both DLT (DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING) and OSH1 (Oryza sativa homeobox1)
