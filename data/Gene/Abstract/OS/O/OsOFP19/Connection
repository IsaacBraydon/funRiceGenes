DLT|OsGRAS-32|D62|GS6|SMOS2	OsOFP19	OsOFP19 modulates plant architecture by integrating cell division pattern and brassinosteroid signaling.	 Here, we report that OsOFP19 negatively modulates brassinosteroid (BR) response and integrates it with cell division pattern to affect plant architecture, including grain shape, through interaction with both DLT (DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING) and OSH1 (Oryza sativa homeobox1)

DLT|OsGRAS-32|D62|GS6|SMOS2	OsOFP19	OsOFP19 modulates plant architecture by integrating cell division pattern and brassinosteroid signaling.	 Therefore, OsOFP19, OSH1, and DLT form a functional complex which plays a pivotal role in modulating BR signaling and determining the cell division pattern during plant growth and development

Here, we report that OsOFP19 negatively modulates brassinosteroid (BR) response and integrates it with cell division pattern to affect plant architecture, including grain shape, through interaction with both DLT (DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING) and OSH1 (Oryza sativa homeobox1)
OSH1|Oskn1	OsOFP19	OsOFP19 modulates plant architecture by integrating cell division pattern and brassinosteroid signaling.	 Further studies revealed that OsOFP19 interacts with OSH1, and this interaction enhances the transcriptional activity of each other and leads to a transition from anticlinal to periclinal cell division

OsOFP19	TAC4|SG2	Ribonuclease H-like gene Small Grain2 regulates grain size in rice through brassinosteroids signal pathway.	 In addition, OsOFP19, a negative regulator of grain shape, interacts with SG2 and plays an antagonistic role with SG2 in controlling gene expression and grain size
OsOFP19	TAC4|SG2	Ribonuclease H-like gene Small Grain2 regulates grain size in rice through brassinosteroids signal pathway.	 Our results indicated that SG2 is a new component of GSK2-related BR signaling response and regulates grain size by interacting with OsOFP19
