OsOFP19	grain	OsOFP19 modulates plant architecture by integrating cell division pattern and brassinosteroid signaling.	 Here, we report that OsOFP19 negatively modulates brassinosteroid (BR) response and integrates it with cell division pattern to affect plant architecture, including grain shape, through interaction with both DLT (DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING) and OSH1 (Oryza sativa homeobox1)
OsOFP19	cell division	OsOFP19 modulates plant architecture by integrating cell division pattern and brassinosteroid signaling.	OsOFP19 modulates plant architecture by integrating cell division pattern and brassinosteroid signaling.

OsOFP19	cell division	OsOFP19 modulates plant architecture by integrating cell division pattern and brassinosteroid signaling.	 Further studies revealed that OsOFP19 interacts with OSH1, and this interaction enhances the transcriptional activity of each other and leads to a transition from anticlinal to periclinal cell division

OsOFP19	brassinosteroid	Overexpression of SlOFP20 affects floral organ and pollen development.	 SlOFP20 overexpression altered the expression levels of some brassinosteroid (BR)-associated genes, implying that SlOFP20 may play a negative role in the BR response, similar to its ortholog OsOFP19 in rice
