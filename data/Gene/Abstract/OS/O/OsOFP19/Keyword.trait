OsOFP19	grain	OsOFP19 modulates plant architecture by integrating cell division pattern and brassinosteroid signaling.	 Here, we report that OsOFP19 negatively modulates brassinosteroid (BR) response and integrates it with cell division pattern to affect plant architecture, including grain shape, through interaction with both DLT (DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING) and OSH1 (Oryza sativa homeobox1)
OsOFP19	cell division	OsOFP19 modulates plant architecture by integrating cell division pattern and brassinosteroid signaling.	OsOFP19 modulates plant architecture by integrating cell division pattern and brassinosteroid signaling.

OsOFP19	cell division	OsOFP19 modulates plant architecture by integrating cell division pattern and brassinosteroid signaling.	 Further studies revealed that OsOFP19 interacts with OSH1, and this interaction enhances the transcriptional activity of each other and leads to a transition from anticlinal to periclinal cell division
