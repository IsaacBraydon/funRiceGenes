NA	OsOFP19 modulates plant architecture by integrating cell division pattern and brassinosteroid signaling.	2017	Plant J	Key Laboratory of South China Agricultural Plant Molecular Analysis and Genetic Improvement, and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Botany, South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510650, China.	Characterization of OFPs (OVATE Family Proteins) has revealed that they exert functions through interacting with different types of transcription factors. However, the molecular bases of these processes are poorly understood. Here, we report that OsOFP19 negatively modulates brassinosteroid (BR) response and integrates it with cell division pattern to affect plant architecture, including grain shape, through interaction with both DLT (DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING) and OSH1 (Oryza sativa homeobox1). Overexpression of OsOFP19 caused semi-dwarf stature with thicker leaves and stronger culms and roots, which is resulted from the increased cell layers in the sub-epidermal tissue. Further studies revealed that OsOFP19 interacts with OSH1, and this interaction enhances the transcriptional activity of each other and leads to a transition from anticlinal to periclinal cell division. Furthermore, DLT interacts with both OsOFP19 and OSH1 and acts as an antagonist in the two interactions. Therefore, OsOFP19, OSH1, and DLT form a functional complex which plays a pivotal role in modulating BR signaling and determining the cell division pattern during plant growth and development.

NA	Overexpression of SlOFP20 affects floral organ and pollen development.	2019	Hortic Res	1Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Tomato, Bioengineering College, Chongqing University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China.	The OVATE gene was initially identified in tomato and serves as a key regulator of fruit shape. There are 31 OFP members in the tomato genome. However, their roles in tomato growth and reproductive development are largely unknown. Here, we cloned the OFP transcription factor SlOFP20. Tomato plants overexpressing SlOFP20 displayed several phenotypic defects, including an altered floral architecture and fruit shape and reduced male fertility. SlOFP20 overexpression altered the expression levels of some brassinosteroid (BR)-associated genes, implying that SlOFP20 may play a negative role in the BR response, similar to its ortholog OsOFP19 in rice. Moreover, the transcript accumulation of gibberellin (GA)-related genes was significantly affected in the transgenic lines. SlOFP20 may play an important role in the crosstalk between BR and GA. The pollen germination assay suggested that the pollen germination rate of SlOFP20-OE plants was distinctly lower than that of WT plants. In addition, the tomato pollen-associated genes SlCRK1, SlPMEI, LePRK3, SlPRALF, and LAT52 were all suppressed in the transgenic lines. Our data imply that SlOFP20 may affect floral organ and pollen development by modulating BR and GA signaling in tomato.
