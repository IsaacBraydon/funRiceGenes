Characterization of OFPs (OVATE Family Proteins) has revealed that they exert functions through interacting with different types of transcription factors. However, the molecular bases of these processes are poorly understood. Here, we report that OsOFP19 negatively modulates brassinosteroid (BR) response and integrates it with cell division pattern to affect plant architecture, including grain shape, through interaction with both DLT (DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING) and OSH1 (Oryza sativa homeobox1). Overexpression of OsOFP19 caused semi-dwarf stature with thicker leaves and stronger culms and roots, which is resulted from the increased cell layers in the sub-epidermal tissue. Further studies revealed that OsOFP19 interacts with OSH1, and this interaction enhances the transcriptional activity of each other and leads to a transition from anticlinal to periclinal cell division. Furthermore, DLT interacts with both OsOFP19 and OSH1 and acts as an antagonist in the two interactions. Therefore, OsOFP19, OSH1, and DLT form a functional complex which plays a pivotal role in modulating BR signaling and determining the cell division pattern during plant growth and development.
