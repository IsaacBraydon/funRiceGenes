OsOFP19	 Overexpression of OsOFP19 caused semi-dwarf stature with thicker leaves and stronger culms and roots, which is resulted from the increased cell layers in the sub-epidermal tissue	 Overexpression of OsOFP19 caused semi-dwarf stature with thicker leaves and stronger culms and roots, which is resulted from the increased cell layers in the sub-epidermal tissue
OsOFP19	 SlOFP20 overexpression altered the expression levels of some brassinosteroid (BR)-associated genes, implying that SlOFP20 may play a negative role in the BR response, similar to its ortholog OsOFP19 in rice	 SlOFP20 overexpression altered the expression levels of some brassinosteroid (BR)-associated genes, implying that SlOFP20 may play a negative role in the BR response, similar to its ortholog OsOFP19 in rice
