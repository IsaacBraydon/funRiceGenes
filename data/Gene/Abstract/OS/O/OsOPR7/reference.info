10.1007-s00425-007-0635-7.pdf	Identification of the OsOPR7 gene encoding 12-oxophytodienoate reductase involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid in rice	2008	Planta	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Enzyme 12-oxophytodienoate (OPDA) reductase (EC1.3.1.42), which is involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA), catalyses the reduction of 10, 11-double bonds of OPDA to yield 3-oxo-2-(2'-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid (OPC-8:0). The rice OsOPR1 gene encodes OPDA reductase (OPR) converting (-)-cis-OPDA preferentially, rather than (+)-cis-OPDA, a natural precursor of JA. Here, we provide evidence that an OPR family gene in rice chromosome 8, designated OsOPR7, encodes the enzyme involved in the JA biosynthesis. Recombinant OsOPR7-His protein efficiently catalysed the reduction of both enantiomers of cis-OPDA, similar to the OPR3 protein in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. The expression of OsOPR7 mRNA was induced and reached maximum levels within 0.5 h of mechanical wounding and drought stress, and the endogenous JA level started to increase in accordance with the increase in OsOPR7 expression. The GFP-OsOPR7 fusion protein was detected exclusively in peroxisomes in onion epidermal cells. Furthermore, complementation analysis using an Arabidopsis opr3 mutant indicated that the OsOPR7 gene, but not OsOPR1, was able to complement the phenotypes of male sterility in the mutant caused by JA deficiency, and that JA production in the opr3 mutant was also restored by the expression of the OsOPR7 gene. We conclude that the OsOPR7 gene encodes the enzyme catalysing the reduction of natural (+)-cis-OPDA for the JA biosynthesis in rice.
NA	OPEN GLUME1: a key enzyme reducing the precursor of JA, participates in carbohydrate transport of lodicules during anthesis in rice.	2017	Plant Cell Rep	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, People's Republic of China.	OG1 is involved in JA-regulated anthesis by modulating carbohydrate transport of lodicules in rice. Flowering plants have evolved a sophisticated regulatory network to coordinate anthesis and maximize reproductive success. In addition to various environmental conditions, the plant hormone jasmonic acid and its derivatives (JAs) are involved in anthesis. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. Here, we report a JA-defective mutant in rice (Oryza sativa), namely open glume 1, which has dysfunctional lodicules that lead to open glumes following anthesis. Map-based cloning and subsequent complementation tests confirmed that OG1 encodes a peroxisome-localized 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase-a key enzyme that reduces the precursor of JA. Loss-of-function of OG1 resulted in almost no JA accumulation. Exogenous JA treatment completely rescued the defects caused by the og1 mutation. Further studies revealed that intracellular metabolism was disrupted in the lodicules of og1 mutant. At the mature plant stage, most seeds of the mutant were malformed with significantly reduced starch content. We speculate that JA or JA signaling mediates the carbohydrate transport of lodicules during anthesis, and signal the onset of cell degradation in lodicules after anthesis. We conclude that the OPEN GLUME 1 gene that produces a key enzyme involved in reducing the precursor of JA in JA biosynthesis and is involved in carbohydrate transport underlying normal lodicule function during anthesis in rice.
NA	Creation of male©\sterile lines that can be restored to fertility by exogenous methyl jasmonate for the establishment of a two©\line system for the hybrid production of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2020	Plant Biotechnology Journal	College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Male sterility is widely used in the production of hybrid seeds in rice, but the use of genic male sterility is limited because of the high labour cost for maintaining male-sterile lines. Previous studies using T-DNA insertional mutagenesis demonstrated that disrupting the expression of oxophytodienoic acid reductase 3 (OPR3), which is involved in the jasmonate biosynthesis pathway, results in a kind of male sterility that can be restored to fertility by exogenous jasmonate in Arabidopsis. Here, we created male-sterile mutations by editing the second and fourth exons of OsOPR7 in rice through clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated system 9. The induced mutagenesis at these exons resulted in 31.8% and 23.9% male-sterile plants in the T0 generation, respectively. We screened male-sterile lines that can be restored to fertility by exogenous methyl jasmonate in the T0, T1 and T2 rice populations and characterized the anther and agronomic traits of the transgenic plants. Results showed the successful generation of male-sterile lines through the silencing of OsOPR7, the orthologous gene of Arabidopsis OPR3, in a field crop, paving the way for the establishment of a two-line system for rice hybrid production. The system consists of a male-sterile line that can be maintained by spraying methyl jasmonate and a restoring line that confers pollen.
