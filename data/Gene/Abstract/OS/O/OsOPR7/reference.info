10.1007-s00425-007-0635-7.pdf	Identification of the OsOPR7 gene encoding 12-oxophytodienoate reductase involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid in rice	2008	Planta	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Enzyme 12-oxophytodienoate (OPDA) reductase (EC1.3.1.42), which is involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA), catalyses the reduction of 10, 11-double bonds of OPDA to yield 3-oxo-2-(2'-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid (OPC-8:0). The rice OsOPR1 gene encodes OPDA reductase (OPR) converting (-)-cis-OPDA preferentially, rather than (+)-cis-OPDA, a natural precursor of JA. Here, we provide evidence that an OPR family gene in rice chromosome 8, designated OsOPR7, encodes the enzyme involved in the JA biosynthesis. Recombinant OsOPR7-His protein efficiently catalysed the reduction of both enantiomers of cis-OPDA, similar to the OPR3 protein in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. The expression of OsOPR7 mRNA was induced and reached maximum levels within 0.5 h of mechanical wounding and drought stress, and the endogenous JA level started to increase in accordance with the increase in OsOPR7 expression. The GFP-OsOPR7 fusion protein was detected exclusively in peroxisomes in onion epidermal cells. Furthermore, complementation analysis using an Arabidopsis opr3 mutant indicated that the OsOPR7 gene, but not OsOPR1, was able to complement the phenotypes of male sterility in the mutant caused by JA deficiency, and that JA production in the opr3 mutant was also restored by the expression of the OsOPR7 gene. We conclude that the OsOPR7 gene encodes the enzyme catalysing the reduction of natural (+)-cis-OPDA for the JA biosynthesis in rice.
NA	OPEN GLUME1: a key enzyme reducing the precursor of JA, participates in carbohydrate transport of lodicules during anthesis in rice.	2017	Plant Cell Rep	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, People's Republic of China.	OG1 is involved in JA-regulated anthesis by modulating carbohydrate transport of lodicules in rice. Flowering plants have evolved a sophisticated regulatory network to coordinate anthesis and maximize reproductive success. In addition to various environmental conditions, the plant hormone jasmonic acid and its derivatives (JAs) are involved in anthesis. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. Here, we report a JA-defective mutant in rice (Oryza sativa), namely open glume 1, which has dysfunctional lodicules that lead to open glumes following anthesis. Map-based cloning and subsequent complementation tests confirmed that OG1 encodes a peroxisome-localized 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase-a key enzyme that reduces the precursor of JA. Loss-of-function of OG1 resulted in almost no JA accumulation. Exogenous JA treatment completely rescued the defects caused by the og1 mutation. Further studies revealed that intracellular metabolism was disrupted in the lodicules of og1 mutant. At the mature plant stage, most seeds of the mutant were malformed with significantly reduced starch content. We speculate that JA or JA signaling mediates the carbohydrate transport of lodicules during anthesis, and signal the onset of cell degradation in lodicules after anthesis. We conclude that the OPEN GLUME 1 gene that produces a key enzyme involved in reducing the precursor of JA in JA biosynthesis and is involved in carbohydrate transport underlying normal lodicule function during anthesis in rice.
NA	Creation of male©\sterile lines that can be restored to fertility by exogenous methyl jasmonate for the establishment of a two©\line system for the hybrid production of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2020	Plant Biotechnology Journal	College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Male sterility is widely used in the production of hybrid seeds in rice, but the use of genic male sterility is limited because of the high labour cost for maintaining male-sterile lines. Previous studies using T-DNA insertional mutagenesis demonstrated that disrupting the expression of oxophytodienoic acid reductase 3 (OPR3), which is involved in the jasmonate biosynthesis pathway, results in a kind of male sterility that can be restored to fertility by exogenous jasmonate in Arabidopsis. Here, we created male-sterile mutations by editing the second and fourth exons of OsOPR7 in rice through clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated system 9. The induced mutagenesis at these exons resulted in 31.8% and 23.9% male-sterile plants in the T0 generation, respectively. We screened male-sterile lines that can be restored to fertility by exogenous methyl jasmonate in the T0, T1 and T2 rice populations and characterized the anther and agronomic traits of the transgenic plants. Results showed the successful generation of male-sterile lines through the silencing of OsOPR7, the orthologous gene of Arabidopsis OPR3, in a field crop, paving the way for the establishment of a two-line system for rice hybrid production. The system consists of a male-sterile line that can be maintained by spraying methyl jasmonate and a restoring line that confers pollen.
NA	Magnaporthe oryzae systemic defense trigger 1 (MoSDT1)-mediated metabolites regulate defense response in Rice	2021	BMC Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China.	Background: Some of the pathogenic effector proteins play an active role in stimulating the plant defense system to strengthen plant resistance.  Results: In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS) was implemented to identify altered metabolites in transgenic rice containing over-expressed M. oryzae Systemic Defense Trigger 1 (MoSDT1) that was infected at three-time points. The characterized dominating metabolites were organic acids and their derivatives, organic oxygen compounds, lipids, and lipid-like molecules. Among the identified metabolites, shikimate, galactinol, trehalose, D-mannose, linolenic acid, dopamine, tyramine, and L-glutamine are precursors for the synthesis of many secondary defense metabolites Carbohydrate, as well as amino acid metabolic, pathways were revealed to be involved in plant defense responses and resistance strengthening.  Conclusion: The increasing salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) content enhanced interactions between JA synthesis/signaling gene, SA synthesis/receptor gene, raffinose/fructose/sucrose synthase gene, and cell wall-related genes all contribute to defense response in rice. The symptoms of rice after M. oryzae infection were significantly alleviated when treated with six identified metabolites, i.e., galactol, tyramine, L-glutamine, L-tryptophan, ¦Á-terpinene, and dopamine for 72 h exogenously. Therefore, these metabolites could be utilized as an optimal metabolic marker for M. oryzae defense.
NA	The jasmonate biosynthesis Gene OsOPR7 can mitigate salinity induced mitochondrial oxidative stress.	2021	Plant Sci	Molecular Cell Biology, Botanical Institute, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Fritz-Haber-Weg 4, D-76131, Karlsruhe, Germany. Electronic address: kinfe_michael2006@yahoo.com.	Salinity poses a serious threat to global agriculture and human food security. A better understanding of plant adaptation to salt stress is, therefore, mandatory. In the non-photosynthetic cells of the root, salinity perturbs oxidative balance in mitochondria, leading to cell death. In parallel, plastids accumulate the jasmonate precursor cis (+)12-Oxo-Phyto-Dienoic Acid (OPDA) that is then translocated to peroxisomes and has been identified as promoting factor for salt-induced cell death as well. In the current study, we probed for a potential interaction between these three organelles that are primarily dealing with oxidative metabolism. We made use of two tools: (i) Rice OPDA Reductase 7 (OsOPR7), an enzyme localised in peroxisomes converting OPDA into the precursors of the stress hormone JA-Ile. (ii) A Trojan Peptoid, Plant PeptoQ, which can specifically target to mitochondria and scavenge excessive superoxide accumulating in response to salt stress. We show that overexpression of OsOPR7 as GFP fusion in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Bright Yellow 2, BY-2) cells, as well as a pretreatment with Plant PeptoQ can mitigate salt stress with respect to numerous aspects including proliferation, expansion, ionic balance, redox homeostasis, and mortality. This mitigation correlates with a more robust oxidative balance, evident from a higher activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), lower levels of superoxide and lipid peroxidation damage, and a conspicuous and specific upregulation of mitochondrial SOD transcripts. Although both, Plant PeptoQ and ectopic OsOPR7, were acting in parallel and mostly additive, there are two specific differences: (i) OsOPR7 is strictly localised to the peroxisomes, while Plant PeptoQ found in mitochondria. (ii) Plant PeptoQ activates transcripts of NAC, a factor involved in retrograde signalling from mitochondria to the nucleus, while these transcripts are suppressed significantly in the cells overexpressing OsOPR7. The fact that overexpression of a peroxisomal enzyme shifting the jasmonate pathway from the cell-death signal OPDA towards JA-Ile, a hormone linked with salt adaptation, is accompanied by more robust redox homeostasis in a different organelle, the mitochondrion, indicates that cross-talk between peroxisome and mitochondrion is a crucial factor for efficient adaptation to salt stress.
