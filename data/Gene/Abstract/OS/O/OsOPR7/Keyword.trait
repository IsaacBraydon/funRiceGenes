OsOPR7|OG1	mitochondria	The jasmonate biosynthesis Gene OsOPR7 can mitigate salinity induced mitochondrial oxidative stress.	 Although both, Plant PeptoQ and ectopic OsOPR7, were acting in parallel and mostly additive, there are two specific differences: (i) OsOPR7 is strictly localised to the peroxisomes, while Plant PeptoQ found in mitochondria
OsOPR7|OG1	mitochondria	The jasmonate biosynthesis Gene OsOPR7 can mitigate salinity induced mitochondrial oxidative stress.
