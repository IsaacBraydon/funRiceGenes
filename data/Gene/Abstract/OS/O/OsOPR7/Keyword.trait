OsOPR7|OG1	sterility	Identification of the OsOPR7 gene encoding 12-oxophytodienoate reductase involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid in rice	Furthermore, complementation analysis using an Arabidopsis opr3 mutant indicated that the OsOPR7 gene, but not OsOPR1, was able to complement the phenotypes of male sterility in the mutant caused by JA deficiency, and that JA production in the opr3 mutant was also restored by the expression of the OsOPR7 gene

OsOPR7|OG1	map-based cloning	OPEN GLUME1: a key enzyme reducing the precursor of JA, participates in carbohydrate transport of lodicules during anthesis in rice.	 Map-based cloning and subsequent complementation tests confirmed that OG1 encodes a peroxisome-localized 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase-a key enzyme that reduces the precursor of JA
OsOPR7|OG1	 ja 	OPEN GLUME1: a key enzyme reducing the precursor of JA, participates in carbohydrate transport of lodicules during anthesis in rice.	 Loss-of-function of OG1 resulted in almost no JA accumulation
OsOPR7|OG1	 ja 	OPEN GLUME1: a key enzyme reducing the precursor of JA, participates in carbohydrate transport of lodicules during anthesis in rice.	 Exogenous JA treatment completely rescued the defects caused by the og1 mutation
