OsOPR7|OG1	OsPEX5	OsPEX5 regulates rice spikelet development through modulating jasmonic acid biosynthesis.	 • We show that OsPEX5 can physically interact with OsOPR7, an enzyme involved in jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and is required for its import into peroxisome
OsOPR7|OG1	OsPEX5	OsPEX5 regulates rice spikelet development through modulating jasmonic acid biosynthesis.	 Similar to Ospex5 mutant, knockout mutant of OsOPR7 generated via the CRISPR-Cas9 technology has reduced levels of endogenous JA and also displays an abnormal spikelet phenotype
OsOPR7|OG1	OsPEX5	OsPEX5 regulates rice spikelet development through modulating jasmonic acid biosynthesis.	 Application of exogenous JA can partially rescue the abnormal spikelet phenotype of Ospex5 and Osopr7
OsOPR7|OG1	OsPEX5	OsPEX5 regulates rice spikelet development through modulating jasmonic acid biosynthesis.	 • Our results suggest that OsPEX5 plays a critical role in regulating spikelet development through mediating peroxisomal import of OsOPR7, thus providing new insights into regulation of JA biosynthesis in plants and expanding our understanding of the biological role of JA in regulating rice reproduction
