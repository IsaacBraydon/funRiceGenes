LIP19|OsbZIP38	OsOBF1|OsbZIP87	LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants	The protein-protein interaction in homo- and hetero-combinations between LIP19 and OsOBF1 was confirmed in vitro and in planta
LIP19|OsbZIP38	OsOBF1|OsbZIP87	LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants	LIP19 and OsOBF1 most likely interact with each other more strongly than OsOBF1 interacts with itself, and the resulting heterodimer binds to the C/G hybrid sequence but not to the hexamer sequence
LIP19|OsbZIP38	OsOBF1|OsbZIP87	LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants	Whereas the expression patterns of lip19 and OsOBF1 in response to low temperatures were totally opposite, the locations of their expression were almost identical
