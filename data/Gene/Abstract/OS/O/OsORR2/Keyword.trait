OsORR2	nucleus	Overexpression of a B-type cytokinin response regulator ( OsORR2) reduces plant height in rice	 The subcellular localization of OsORR2 was in cell nucleus
OsORR2	height	Overexpression of a B-type cytokinin response regulator ( OsORR2) reduces plant height in rice	 Here, we found that overexpressing an OsORR2 gene (a type-B RR) could reduce plant height in rice compared with the wild type (WT)
OsORR2	plant height	Overexpression of a B-type cytokinin response regulator ( OsORR2) reduces plant height in rice	 Here, we found that overexpressing an OsORR2 gene (a type-B RR) could reduce plant height in rice compared with the wild type (WT)
