OsOTS1	root	SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.	 We demonstrate that OsOTS1 confers salt tolerance in rice by increasing root biomass
OsOTS1	salinity	SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.	 High salinity triggers OsOTS1 degradation indicating that increased SUMO conjugation in rice plants during salt stress is in part achieved by down-regulation of OTS1/2 activity
OsOTS1	salt	SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.	 In this report, we reveal the Ubiquitin-like Protease (ULP) class of SUMO protease gene family in rice and demonstrate a critical role for OsOTS1 SUMO protease in salt stress
OsOTS1	salt	SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.	 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsOTS1 have increased salt tolerance and a concomitant reduction in the levels of SUMOylated proteins
