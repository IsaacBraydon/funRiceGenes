NA	SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.	2016	Plant Physiol	University of Durham CITY: Durham United Kingdom [GB].	SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) conjugation onto target proteins has emerged as a very influential class of protein modification system. SUMO1/2 double mutant plants are non viable underlining the importance of SUMO conjugation to plant survival. Once covalently bound SUMO can alter a conjugated protein's stability and/or functionality. SUMO conjugation is a highly dynamic process that can be rapidly reversed by the action of SUMO proteases. The balance between the conjugated / de-conjugated forms is a major determinant in the modulation of SUMO-target function. Given the important mechanistic role of SUMO proteases in model plants, till now the identity or the function of these regulatory enzymes has not been defined in any crop plant. In this report, we reveal the Ubiquitin-like Protease (ULP) class of SUMO protease gene family in rice and demonstrate a critical role for OsOTS1 SUMO protease in salt stress. OsOTS-RNAi rice plants accumulate high levels of SUMO1 conjugated proteins during salt stress and are highly salt sensitive however, in non-salt conditions they are developmentally indistinguishable from wild type plants. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsOTS1 have increased salt tolerance and a concomitant reduction in the levels of SUMOylated proteins. We demonstrate that OsOTS1 confers salt tolerance in rice by increasing root biomass. High salinity triggers OsOTS1 degradation indicating that increased SUMO conjugation in rice plants during salt stress is in part achieved by down-regulation of OTS1/2 activity. OsOTS1 is nuclear localised indicating a direct requirement of OsOTS1 dependent deSUMOylation activity in rice nuclei for salt tolerance.
NA	Rice OVERLY TOLERANT TO SALT 1(OTS1) SUMO protease is a positive regulator of seed germination and root development.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	a School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences , Durham University , Durham , DH1 3LE , UK.	Salinity is one of the major environmental stresses affecting rice production worldwide. Improving rice salt tolerance is a critical step for sustainable food production. Posttranslational modifications of proteins greatly expand proteome diversity, increase functionality and allow quick responses to environmental stresses, all at low cost to the cell. SUMO mediated modification of substrate proteins is a highly dynamic process governed by the balance of activities of SUMO E3 ligases and deconjugating SUMO proteases. In recent years, SUMO (Small Ubiquitin like Modifier) conjugation of proteins has emerged as an influential regulator of stress signalling in the model plant Arabidopsis. However SUMOylation remain largely under studied in crop plants. We recently identified the SUMO protease gene family in rice and demonstrated a role for OsOTS1 SUMO proteases in salt stress. Interestingly, rice plants silencing OsOTS1 also show significantly reduced germination rate. Knockdown of OsOTS1 gene expression affects root growth by primarily reducing cell size rather than cell division.
