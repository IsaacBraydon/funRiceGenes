OsO3L2	seedlings	Engineering low-cadmium rice through stress-inducible expression of OXS3-family member genes.	 However, despite generating 625 putative transformants, only 7 lines survived as T1 seedlings and only 1 line of each overexpressed OsO3L2 or OsO3L3-produced T2 progeny
OsO3L2	root	Engineering low-cadmium rice through stress-inducible expression of OXS3-family member genes.	 Analysis of the expression profile suggested that low Cd accumulation may be due to high expression of OsO3L2 and OsO3L3 in the root tip region
OsO3L2	root	Engineering low-cadmium rice through stress-inducible expression of OXS3-family member genes.	 Cellular localization of OsO3L2 and OsO3L3 indicate that they are histone H2A interacting nuclear proteins in vascular cells and especially in the root tip region
OsO3L2	R protein	Engineering low-cadmium rice through stress-inducible expression of OXS3-family member genes.	 Cellular localization of OsO3L2 and OsO3L3 indicate that they are histone H2A interacting nuclear proteins in vascular cells and especially in the root tip region
