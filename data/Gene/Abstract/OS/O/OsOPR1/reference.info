The rice 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase 1 gene (OsOPR1), isolated as a jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive gene, has been suggested to be involved in defense responses in rice. We identified a 19-base pair region that is essential to the JA-responsiveness of OsOPR1 by deletion and mutation analysis of the promoter by dual luciferase assay. This region contains possible recognition sites for basic leucine zipper transcription factors.
NA	Magnaporthe oryzae systemic defense trigger 1 (MoSDT1)-mediated metabolites regulate defense response in Rice	2021	BMC Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China.	Background: Some of the pathogenic effector proteins play an active role in stimulating the plant defense system to strengthen plant resistance.  Results: In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS) was implemented to identify altered metabolites in transgenic rice containing over-expressed M. oryzae Systemic Defense Trigger 1 (MoSDT1) that was infected at three-time points. The characterized dominating metabolites were organic acids and their derivatives, organic oxygen compounds, lipids, and lipid-like molecules. Among the identified metabolites, shikimate, galactinol, trehalose, D-mannose, linolenic acid, dopamine, tyramine, and L-glutamine are precursors for the synthesis of many secondary defense metabolites Carbohydrate, as well as amino acid metabolic, pathways were revealed to be involved in plant defense responses and resistance strengthening.  Conclusion: The increasing salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) content enhanced interactions between JA synthesis/signaling gene, SA synthesis/receptor gene, raffinose/fructose/sucrose synthase gene, and cell wall-related genes all contribute to defense response in rice. The symptoms of rice after M. oryzae infection were significantly alleviated when treated with six identified metabolites, i.e., galactol, tyramine, L-glutamine, L-tryptophan, ¦Á-terpinene, and dopamine for 72 h exogenously. Therefore, these metabolites could be utilized as an optimal metabolic marker for M. oryzae defense.
NA	Targeted Phytohormone Profiling Identifies Potential Regulators of Spikelet Sterility in Rice under Combined Drought and Heat Stress.	2021	Int J Mol Sci	Department of Crop Physiology, University of Agricultural Sciences, GKVK, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India.	Rice cultivated under rainfed or semi-irrigated ecosystems is frequently exposed to a combination of drought and heat stress. As a sensitive crop at the reproductive stage, exposure to combined drought and heat stress will have a deleterious effect on yield. In this study, two rice cultivars with contrasting spikelet sterility, AVT2-5315 (low sterility) and AC35027 (high sterility), under combined stress were selected for physiological characterization and phytohormonal profiling at anthesis. Under combined stress, both cultivars did not differ in the physiological parameters such as relative water content, photosynthetic rate, light-adapted chlorophyll fluorescence and biomass, suggesting a similar source activity under stress. However, AVT2-5315 showed better yield due to better pollen and spikelet fertility than AC35027, suggesting its intrinsic tolerance ability under combined stress. Targeted profiling of 15 phytohormones from drought, heat and combined stress-treated flag leaf and spikelet tissues using LC-MS/MS showed increased accumulation of auxins (indole 3-acetic acid and indole 3-butyric acid) in flag leaves and jasmonic acid in spikelets of AVT2-5315, while there was increased accumulation of ethylene in flag leaves and methyl-jasmonate in spikelets of AC35027. Increased accumulation of these hormones correlated with key biosynthetic pathway genes. In the flag leaves, increased accumulation of auxins was correlated with increased transcript levels of YUCCA-like gene 1 (OsYUCCA1) and fish bone (OsFIB), in AVT2-5315 under combined stress. In AC35027, increased ethylene content was correlated with expression of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 1 (OsASC1) and aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase 2 (OsACO2). Similarly, in spikelets, increased accumulation of jasmonic acid in AVT2-5315 was correlated with expression of allene oxide cyclase (OsAOC) and 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase 1 (OsOPR1). The mechanism of regulating spikelet sterility by these hormones needs further investigation towards improving rice tolerance to combined stress.
