The rice 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase 1 gene (OsOPR1), isolated as a jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive gene, has been suggested to be involved in defense responses in rice. We identified a 19-base pair region that is essential to the JA-responsiveness of OsOPR1 by deletion and mutation analysis of the promoter by dual luciferase assay. This region contains possible recognition sites for basic leucine zipper transcription factors.
