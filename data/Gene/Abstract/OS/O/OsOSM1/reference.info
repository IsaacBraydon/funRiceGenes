NA	Overexpression of OsOSM1 Enhances Resistance to Rice Sheath Blight	2016	lant Disease	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology	Sheath blight (SB), caused by Rhizoctonia solani, is one of the most destructive rice diseases worldwide. It has been difficult to generate SB-resistant varieties through conventional breeding because of the quantitative nature of rice resistance to SB. In this study, we found that overexpression of the OsOSM1 gene, encoding an osmotin protein belonging to the pathogenesis-related protein 5 family, is able to improve rice resistance to SB in field tests. Although there are two osmotin genes in rice, OsOSM1 is the one mainly expressed in leaf sheath at the booting stage, coinciding with the critical stage of SB development in the field. In addition, OsOSM1 expression is strongly induced by R. solani in SB-resistant rice variety YSBR1 but not in susceptible varieties, suggesting its involvement in SB resistance. Overexpression of OsOSM1 (OsOSM1ox) in susceptible variety Xudao 3 significantly increases resistance to SB in transgenic rice. The OsOSM1 mRNA levels in different transgenic lines are found to be positively correlated with their SB resistance levels. Intriguingly, although extremely high levels of OsOSM1 were detrimental to rice development, appropriately elevated levels of OsSOM1 were obtained that enhanced rice SB resistance without affecting rice development or grain yield. The OsSOM1 protein is localized on plasma membrane. OsOSM1 is upregulated by jasmonic acid (JA); furthermore, JA-responsive marker genes are induced in OsOSM1ox lines. These results suggest that the activation of JA signaling pathway may account for the increased resistance in transgenic OsOSM1ox lines. Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsOSM1 plays an important role in defense against rice SB disease and provides a new target for engineering resistance to SB.
