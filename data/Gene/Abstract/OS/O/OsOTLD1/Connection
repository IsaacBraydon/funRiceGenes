MODD	OsOTLD1	Reversible Histone H2B Monoubiquitination Fine-tunes Abscisic Acid Signaling and Drought Response in Rice.	 Interestingly, MODD, a reported suppressor of ABA signaling and drought resistance through mediation of OsbZIP46 deactivation and degradation, can repress the H2Bub1 level in the OsbZIP46 target genes by recruiting a putative deubiquitinase OsOTLD1
