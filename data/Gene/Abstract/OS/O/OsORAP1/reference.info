NA	A novel gene OsORAP1 enhances cell death in ozone stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Plant Physiol	Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation (INRES) - Plant Nutrition CITY: Bonn STATE: NRW Germany [DE].	A novel protein OZONE-RESPONSIVE APOPLASTIC PROTEIN 1 (OsORAP1) was characterized, which was previously suggested as a candidate gene underlying OzT9, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for ozone stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The sequence of OsORAP1 was similar to ascorbate oxidase (AO) proteins. It was localized in the apoplast as shown by transient expression of an OsORAP1/GFP fusion construct in tobacco leaf epidermal and mesophyll cells, but did not possess AO activity as shown by heterologous expression of OsORAP1 in Arabidopsis mutants with reduced background AO activity. A knock-out (KO) rice line of OsORAP1 showed enhanced tolerance to ozone stress (120 nL L-1 average daytime concentration, 20 days) as demonstrated by less formation of leaf visible symptoms (= cell death), less lipid peroxidation, and lower NADPH oxidase activity, indicating reduced active production of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, the effect of ozone on chlorophyll content was not significantly different among the lines. These observations suggested that OsORAP1 specifically induced cell death in ozone stress. Significantly enhanced expression of jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive genes in the KO line implied involvement of the JA pathway in symptom mitigation. Sequence analysis revealed extensive polymorphisms in the promoter region of OsORAP1 between the ozone susceptible Nipponbare and tolerant Kasalath, the OzT9 donor variety, which could be responsible for differential regulation of OsORAP1 reported earlier. These pieces of evidence suggested that OsORAP1 enhanced cell death in ozone stress, and its expression levels could explain the effect of a previously reported QTL.
