OsOSCA1.2	osmotic stress	Cryo-EM structure of OSCA1.2 from Oryza sativa elucidates the mechanical basis of potential membrane hyperosmolality gating.	By combining biochemical, biophysical, and computational studies, we derive a model of how OSCA1.2 could mediate transport pathway gating under osmotic stress.
