OsORC1	root apical meristem	Molecular cloning and characterization of a plant homologue of the origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1)	OsORC1 transcripts were expressed strongly in root tips and weakly in young leaves containing root apical meristem and marginal meristem, respectively
OsORC1	root	Molecular cloning and characterization of a plant homologue of the origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1)	OsORC1 transcripts were expressed strongly in root tips and weakly in young leaves containing root apical meristem and marginal meristem, respectively
OsORC1	growth	Molecular cloning and characterization of a plant homologue of the origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1)	The level of OsORC1 expression was significantly reduced when cell proliferation was temporarily halted by the removal of sucrose from the growth medium
OsORC1	growth	Molecular cloning and characterization of a plant homologue of the origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1)	When the growth-halted cells began to re-grow following addition of sucrose to the medium, OsORC1 was again expressed at high levels
OsORC1	meristem	Molecular cloning and characterization of a plant homologue of the origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1)	OsORC1 transcripts were expressed strongly in root tips and weakly in young leaves containing root apical meristem and marginal meristem, respectively
