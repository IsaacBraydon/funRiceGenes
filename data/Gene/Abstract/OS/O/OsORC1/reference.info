Alignment of the OsORC1 protein sequence with the sequence of ORC1 from human and yeasts S. cerevisiae and S. pombe showed a high degree of sequence homology (38.7, 32.9 and 35.0% identity, respectively), particularly around the C-terminal region containing the CDC-NTP domain. Interestingly, the OsORC1 protein had an A+T hook-like motif, which was not present in the human or yeast genes. Genomic analysis indicated that OsORC1 existed as a single copy per genome. OsORC1 transcripts were expressed strongly in root tips and weakly in young leaves containing root apical meristem and marginal meristem, respectively. No expression was detected in the mature leaves. The level of OsORC1 expression was significantly reduced when cell proliferation was temporarily halted by the removal of sucrose from the growth medium. When the growth-halted cells began to re-grow following addition of sucrose to the medium, OsORC1 was again expressed at high levels. These results suggested that OsORC1 is required for cell proliferation. The role of OsORC1 in plant DNA replication will be discussed.
