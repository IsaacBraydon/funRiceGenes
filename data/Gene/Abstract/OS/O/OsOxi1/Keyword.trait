OsOxi1	defense response	AGC kinase OsOxi1 positively regulates basal resistance through suppression of OsPti1a-mediated negative regulation	" Taken together, our data suggest that OsOxi1 positively regulates defense responses through the phosphorylation of OsPti1a, causing the release from an OsPti1a-dependent inhibition of the responses"
OsOxi1	disease resistance	AGC kinase OsOxi1 positively regulates basal resistance through suppression of OsPti1a-mediated negative regulation	 Overexpression of OsOxi1 enhanced basal resistance to the blast fungus, indicating that OsOxi1 positively regulates disease resistance
OsOxi1	disease	Pdk1 Kinase Regulates Basal Disease Resistance Through the OsOxi1-OsPti1a Phosphorylation Cascade in Rice	The AGC kinase OsOxi1, which has been isolated as an interactor with OsPti1a, positively regulates basal disease resistance in rice
OsOxi1	disease	Pdk1 Kinase Regulates Basal Disease Resistance Through the OsOxi1-OsPti1a Phosphorylation Cascade in Rice	 We show here that OsPdk1 acts upstream of the OsOxi1-OsPti1a signal cascade in disease resistance in rice
