OsOASTL-A1	root	OsOASTL-A1 functions as a cytosolic cysteine synthase and affects arsenic tolerance in rice.	 Transgenic rice plants expressing pOsOASTL-A1::GUS suggested that OsOASTL-A1 was strongly expressed in the outer cortex and the vascular cylinder in the root mature zone
OsOASTL-A1	growth	OsOASTL-A1 functions as a cytosolic cysteine synthase and affects arsenic tolerance in rice.	 Tissue expression analysis revealed that OsOASTL-A1 mainly expressed in roots at the vegetative growth stage and in nodes at the reproductive stage
OsOASTL-A1	tolerance	OsOASTL-A1 functions as a cytosolic cysteine synthase and affects arsenic tolerance in rice.	OsOASTL-A1 functions as a cytosolic cysteine synthase and affects arsenic tolerance in rice.
OsOASTL-A1	vegetative	OsOASTL-A1 functions as a cytosolic cysteine synthase and affects arsenic tolerance in rice.	 Tissue expression analysis revealed that OsOASTL-A1 mainly expressed in roots at the vegetative growth stage and in nodes at the reproductive stage
OsOASTL-A1	stress	OsOASTL-A1 functions as a cytosolic cysteine synthase and affects arsenic tolerance in rice.	 Knockout of OsOASTL-A1 led to significantly lower levels of cysteine, glutathione and phytochelatins in roots and increased sensitivity to arsenate stress
OsOASTL-A1	reproductive	OsOASTL-A1 functions as a cytosolic cysteine synthase and affects arsenic tolerance in rice.	 Tissue expression analysis revealed that OsOASTL-A1 mainly expressed in roots at the vegetative growth stage and in nodes at the reproductive stage
