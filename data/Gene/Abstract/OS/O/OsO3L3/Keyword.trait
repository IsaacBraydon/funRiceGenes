OsO3L3	root	Engineering low-cadmium rice through stress-inducible expression of OXS3-family member genes.	 Analysis of the expression profile suggested that low Cd accumulation may be due to high expression of OsO3L2 and OsO3L3 in the root tip region
OsO3L3	root	Engineering low-cadmium rice through stress-inducible expression of OXS3-family member genes.	 Cellular localization of OsO3L2 and OsO3L3 indicate that they are histone H2A interacting nuclear proteins in vascular cells and especially in the root tip region
OsO3L3	R protein	Engineering low-cadmium rice through stress-inducible expression of OXS3-family member genes.	 Cellular localization of OsO3L2 and OsO3L3 indicate that they are histone H2A interacting nuclear proteins in vascular cells and especially in the root tip region
