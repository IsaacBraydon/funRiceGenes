NA	Rice OVATE family protein 6 regulates plant development and confers resistance to drought and cold stresses.	2017	J Exp Bot	Key Laboratory of South China Agricultural Plant Molecular Analysis and Genetic Improvement, and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Botany, South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510650, China.	OVATE family proteins (OFPs) regulate multiple aspects of plant growth and development; however, their roles in responses to abiotic stresses have not yet been studied. Here, we report that rice OsOFP6 regulates growth and development, and alters responses to drought and cold stresses. OsOFP6 is expressed in various tissues and developmental stages. Knock-down of OsOFP6 by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in semi-dwarf stature, altered grain shape, and shorter lateral roots. OsOFP6 was shown to interfere with auxin in regulating lateral root growth and initiation, as RNAi plants had increased density of lateral roots under IAA (indole-3-acetic acid) treatment. OsOFP6 also affects polar auxin transport, which was demonstrated by the different responses of RNAi and OsOFP6-overexpression (OE) plants to treatment with N-1-naphthylphalamic acid (NPA). Furthermore, under drought conditions OE lines showed slower water loss and less accumulation of H2O2 compared with RNAi plants, which displayed faster water loss and higher H2O2, implying that OsOFP6 may confer both drought avoidance and drought tolerance in rice plants. In addition, under cold treatment OE and RNAi plants exhibited lower and higher relative electrical conductivity (REC), respectively, suggesting an important role of OsOFP6 in response to cold stress. These results provide new insights into the multiple functions of OVATE family proteins.
NA	Rice OVATE family protein 6 regulates leaf angle by modulating secondary cell wall biosynthesis 	2020	Plant Mol Biol.	Key Laboratory of South China Agricultural Plant Molecular Analysis and Genetic Improvement, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Botany, Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, South China, 510650, China.	Secondary cell wall not only provides rigidity and mechanical resistance to plants, but also has a large impact on plant growth and adaptation to environments. Biosynthesis of secondary cell wall is regulated by a complicated signaling transduction network; however, it is still unclear how the transcriptional regulation of secondary cell wall biosynthesis works at the molecular level. Here, we report in rice that OVATE family proteins 6 (OsOFP6) is a positive regulator in modulating expression of the genes related to biosynthesis of the secondary cell wall. Transgenic plants with knock-down of OsOFP6 by RNA interference showed increased leaf angle, which resulted from the thinner secondary cell wall with reduced amounts of cellulose and lignin, whilst overexpression of OsOFP6 in rice led to the thinker secondary cell wall with increased lignin content. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that OsOFP6 interacts with Oryza sativa homeobox 15 (OSH15), a class I KNOX protein. The interaction of OsOFP6 and OSH15 enhanced the transcriptional activity of OSH15 which binds to the promoter of OsIRX9 (Oryza sativa IRREGULAR XYLEM 9). Taken together, our study provides insights into the function of OsOFP6 in regulating leaf angle and the control of biosynthesis of secondary cell wall.
