OsOFP6	root	Rice OVATE family protein 6 regulates plant development and confers resistance to drought and cold stresses.	 OsOFP6 was shown to interfere with auxin in regulating lateral root growth and initiation, as RNAi plants had increased density of lateral roots under IAA (indole-3-acetic acid) treatment
OsOFP6	growth	Rice OVATE family protein 6 regulates plant development and confers resistance to drought and cold stresses.	 Here, we report that rice OsOFP6 regulates growth and development, and alters responses to drought and cold stresses
