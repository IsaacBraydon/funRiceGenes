D6|OSH15|Oskn3	OsOFP6	Rice OVATE family protein 6 regulates leaf angle by modulating secondary cell wall biosynthesis 	 Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that OsOFP6 interacts with Oryza sativa homeobox 15 (OSH15), a class I KNOX protein
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	OsOFP6	Rice OVATE family protein 6 regulates leaf angle by modulating secondary cell wall biosynthesis 	 The interaction of OsOFP6 and OSH15 enhanced the transcriptional activity of OSH15 which binds to the promoter of OsIRX9 (Oryza sativa IRREGULAR XYLEM 9)
