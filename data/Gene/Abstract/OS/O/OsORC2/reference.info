In eukaryotic cells, the origin recognition complex (ORC) governs the initiation site of DNA replication and formation of the prereplication complex. The isolation, characterization and tissue-specific expression of a putative ORC subunit 2 (OsORC2) in Oryza sativa is described here. A novel cDNA fragment encoding rice ORC2 was isolated by screening the subtractive library, which had a higher expression level in inflorescence meristem than in shoot apical meristem. The full-length cDNA of rice ORC2 was obtained by the method of rapid amplification of cDNA ends, which contained an 1140 bp open reading frame encoding a 379 amino acid polypeptide. Sequence alignment shows that there is a high homology between the deduced amino sequence of OsORC2 and maize ORC2 (85%). The tissue-specific expression pattern of OsORC2 reveals that it is abundant in roots, seedling and inflorescence meristem, while its expression level is much lower in mature leaves and shoot.
