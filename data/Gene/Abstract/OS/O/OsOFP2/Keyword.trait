OsOFP2	leaf	Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 (OFP2) alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.	Rice plants overexpressing OsOFP2 were reduced in height and exhibited altered leaf morphology, seed shape, and positioning of vascular bundles in stems
OsOFP2	vascular bundle	Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 (OFP2) alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.	Rice plants overexpressing OsOFP2 were reduced in height and exhibited altered leaf morphology, seed shape, and positioning of vascular bundles in stems
OsOFP2	seed	Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 (OFP2) alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.	Rice plants overexpressing OsOFP2 were reduced in height and exhibited altered leaf morphology, seed shape, and positioning of vascular bundles in stems
OsOFP2	development	Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 (OFP2) alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.	Also, we found that OsOFP2 was expressed in plant vasculature and determined that putative vascular development KNOX and BELL proteins interact with OsOFP2
OsOFP2	development	Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 (OFP2) alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.	We propose that OsOFP2 could modulate KNOX-BELL function to control diverse aspects of development including vasculature development
OsOFP2	gibberellin	Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 (OFP2) alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.	Reduced expression of the gibberellin biosynthesis gene GA 20-oxidase 7 coincided with lower gibberellin content in OsOFP2 overexpression lines
OsOFP2	 ga 	Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 (OFP2) alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.	Reduced expression of the gibberellin biosynthesis gene GA 20-oxidase 7 coincided with lower gibberellin content in OsOFP2 overexpression lines
OsOFP2	height	Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 (OFP2) alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.	Rice plants overexpressing OsOFP2 were reduced in height and exhibited altered leaf morphology, seed shape, and positioning of vascular bundles in stems
OsOFP2	nucleus	Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 (OFP2) alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.	OsOFP2 was found to localize to the nucleus and to the cytosol
OsOFP2	Gibberellin	Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 (OFP2) alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.	Reduced expression of the gibberellin biosynthesis gene GA 20-oxidase 7 coincided with lower gibberellin content in OsOFP2 overexpression lines
OsOFP2	GA	Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 (OFP2) alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.	Reduced expression of the gibberellin biosynthesis gene GA 20-oxidase 7 coincided with lower gibberellin content in OsOFP2 overexpression lines
OsOFP2	vascular development	Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 (OFP2) alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.	Also, we found that OsOFP2 was expressed in plant vasculature and determined that putative vascular development KNOX and BELL proteins interact with OsOFP2
