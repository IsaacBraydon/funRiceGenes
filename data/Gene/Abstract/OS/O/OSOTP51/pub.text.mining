according to Fryer et al. 2002). As shown in Figure 8, the leaves   are LOC_Os02g47280, LOC_Os02g47310, LOC_Os02g47360 of osotp51 showed much more intense staining of superoxide          and LOC_Os02g47390. After sequencing, we found a mutation than that of WT, indicating more ROS accumulation in osotp51.       of AA to C in the LOC_Os02g47360 in the mutant (Figure 9B).
