OsJRL40	 The loss of function of OsJRL40 increased sensitivity to salt stress in rice, whereas its overexpression enhanced salt tolerance at the seedling stage and during reproductive growth |  RNA-seq analysis revealed that OsJRL40 regulates salt tolerance in rice by controlling the expression of genes encoding Na(+)/K(+) transporters, salt-responsive transcription factors, and other salt response-related proteins	 The loss of function of OsJRL40 increased sensitivity to salt stress in rice, whereas its overexpression enhanced salt tolerance at the seedling stage and during reproductive growth
