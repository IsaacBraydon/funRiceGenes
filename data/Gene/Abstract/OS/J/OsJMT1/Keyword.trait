OsJMT1	 ABA 	Methyl jasmonate reduces grain yield by mediating stress signals to alter spikelet development in rice	Two genes, OsJMT1 and OsSDR (for short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase), are involved in MeJA and ABA biosynthesis, respectively, in rice (Oryza sativa)
OsJMT1	yield	Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.	Plants in which OsJMT1 had been overexpressed (oe-JMT plants) showed reduced height and yield
OsJMT1	brown planthopper	Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.	OsJMT1 is up-regulated in response to infestation with the brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens)
OsJMT1	height	Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.	Plants in which OsJMT1 had been overexpressed (oe-JMT plants) showed reduced height and yield
OsJMT1	 ja 	Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.	After we cloned a rice JMT gene, OsJMT1, whose encoding protein was localized in the cytosol, we found that the recombinant OsJMT1 protein catalyzed JA to MeJA
OsJMT1	JA	Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.	After we cloned a rice JMT gene, OsJMT1, whose encoding protein was localized in the cytosol, we found that the recombinant OsJMT1 protein catalyzed JA to MeJA
