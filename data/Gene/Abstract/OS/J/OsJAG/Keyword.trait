SL1|OsJAG	vegetative	Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	OsJAG is an important gene with pleiotropy, expressing almost throughout the plant and acting in both vegetative phase and reproductive phase
SL1|OsJAG	palea	STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice	The sl1 mutant largely resembles the rice B-class gene mutant spw1; both exhibit homeotic conversions of lodicules and stamens to palea/lemma-like organs and carpels
SL1|OsJAG	lemma	STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice	The sl1 mutant largely resembles the rice B-class gene mutant spw1; both exhibit homeotic conversions of lodicules and stamens to palea/lemma-like organs and carpels
SL1|OsJAG	sterile	Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Loss of OsJAG function results in maldevelopment of all floral organs, such as degenerated lemma and palea, elongated lodicules and deformed and sterile pistil
SL1|OsJAG	lemma	Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Loss of OsJAG function results in maldevelopment of all floral organs, such as degenerated lemma and palea, elongated lodicules and deformed and sterile pistil
SL1|OsJAG	flower	STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice	Additionally, sl1 produces flowers with varied numbers of inner floral organs, and amorphous tissues without floral organ identity were frequently formed in whorls 3 and 4
SL1|OsJAG	floral	STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice	Here, we report molecular cloning and characterization of the rice STAMENLESS 1 (SL1) gene that is involved in floral development
SL1|OsJAG	floral	STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice	Additionally, sl1 produces flowers with varied numbers of inner floral organs, and amorphous tissues without floral organ identity were frequently formed in whorls 3 and 4
SL1|OsJAG	floral	STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice	The functional divergence between SL1 and JAG implies that SL1 was co-opted for its distinctive roles in specification of floral organ identity in rice after the lineage split from Arabidopsis
SL1|OsJAG	palea	Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Loss of OsJAG function results in maldevelopment of all floral organs, such as degenerated lemma and palea, elongated lodicules and deformed and sterile pistil
SL1|OsJAG	reproductive	Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	OsJAG is an important gene with pleiotropy, expressing almost throughout the plant and acting in both vegetative phase and reproductive phase
SL1|OsJAG	stamen	STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice	Here, we report molecular cloning and characterization of the rice STAMENLESS 1 (SL1) gene that is involved in floral development
SL1|OsJAG	stamen	STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice	The sl1 mutant largely resembles the rice B-class gene mutant spw1; both exhibit homeotic conversions of lodicules and stamens to palea/lemma-like organs and carpels
SL1|OsJAG	stamen	STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice	We also show that SL1 specifies lodicule and stamen identities through positive transcriptional regulation of SPW1/OsMADS16 expression
SL1|OsJAG	floral	Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Interestingly, OsJAG does not affect the number of floral organ primordial and so of floral organs in each whorl, suggesting that OsJAG does not influence the initiation of floral organ primordia, but affect the developmental fate of all floral organs after their primordia have initiated
SL1|OsJAG	floral	Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Loss of OsJAG function results in maldevelopment of all floral organs, such as degenerated lemma and palea, elongated lodicules and deformed and sterile pistil
