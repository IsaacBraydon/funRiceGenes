OsMADS16|SPW1	SL1|OsJAG	STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice	 We also show that SL1 specifies lodicule and stamen identities through positive transcriptional regulation of SPW1/OsMADS16 expression| The sl1 mutant largely resembles the rice B-class gene mutant spw1; both exhibit homeotic conversions of lodicules and stamens to palea/lemma-like organs and carpels
