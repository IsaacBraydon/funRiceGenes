OsJMT1	yield	Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.	Plants in which OsJMT1 had been overexpressed (oe-JMT plants) showed reduced height and yield
OsJMT1	brown planthopper	Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.	OsJMT1 is up-regulated in response to infestation with the brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens)
OsJMT1	height	Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.	Plants in which OsJMT1 had been overexpressed (oe-JMT plants) showed reduced height and yield
OsJMT1	 ja 	Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.	After we cloned a rice JMT gene, OsJMT1, whose encoding protein was localized in the cytosol, we found that the recombinant OsJMT1 protein catalyzed JA to MeJA
