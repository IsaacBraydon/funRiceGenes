OsJAZ8|OsTIFY10c	blight	Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice	Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice
OsJAZ8|OsTIFY10c	 ja 	Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice	JA treatment caused OsJAZ8 degradation and this degradation was dependent on the 26S proteasome pathway
OsJAZ8|OsTIFY10c	 ja 	Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice	On the basis of these data, we conclude that JA plays an important role in resistance to Xoo, and OsJAZ8 acts as a repressor of JA signaling in rice
OsJAZ8|OsTIFY10c	jasmonate	Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice	Expression of OsJAZ8, a rice jasmonate ZIM-domain protein, was highly up-regulated by JA
OsJAZ8|OsTIFY10c	jasmonate	Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice	Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice
OsJAZ8|OsTIFY10c	bacterial blight	Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice	Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice
OsJAZ8|OsTIFY10c	 xoo 	Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice	Furthermore, OsJAZ8DeltaC negatively regulated the JA-induced resistance to Xoo in rice
OsJAZ8|OsTIFY10c	defense	Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice	A large-scale analysis using a rice DNA microarray revealed that overexpression of OsJAZ8DeltaC altered the expression of JA-responsive genes, including defense-related genes, in rice
