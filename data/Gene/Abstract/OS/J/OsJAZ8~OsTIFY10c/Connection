OsCOI1|OsCOI1a	OsJAZ8|OsTIFY10c	Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice	OsJAZ8 interacted with a putative OsCOI1, which is a component of the SCF(COI1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in a coronatine-dependent manner
OsJAZ8|OsTIFY10c	OsMYC2	Overexpression of OsMYC2 Results in the Up-Regulation of Early JA-Rresponsive Genes and Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice.	The up-regulation of OsMYC2 in response to JA was regulated by OsJAZ8
OsJAZ8|OsTIFY10c	OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	Jasmonate Zim-Domain Protein 9 Interacts With Slender Rice 1 to Mediate the Antagonistic Interaction Between Jasmonic and Gibberellic Acid Signals in Rice.	 Analysis of protein-protein interactions showed that OsJAZ8 and OsJAZ9 interact with SLR1; OsJAZ9 also interacted with the SLR1-LIKE (SLRL) protein SLRL2

Analysis of protein-protein interactions showed that OsJAZ8 and OsJAZ9 interact with SLR1; OsJAZ9 also interacted with the SLR1-LIKE (SLRL) protein SLRL2.
OsJAZ8|OsTIFY10c	SLR1|OsGAI|OsSLR1	Jasmonate Zim-Domain Protein 9 Interacts With Slender Rice 1 to Mediate the Antagonistic Interaction Between Jasmonic and Gibberellic Acid Signals in Rice.	Analysis of protein-protein interactions showed that OsJAZ8 and OsJAZ9 interact with SLR1; OsJAZ9 also interacted with the SLR1-LIKE (SLRL) protein SLRL2.
OsAOS2|AOS	OsJAZ8|OsTIFY10c	Jasmonic acid contributes to rice resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae.	 Secondly, we observe that transcripts for JA biosynthesis (OsAOS2 and OsOPR7), JA signalling (OsJAZ8, OsJAZ9, OsJAZ11 and OsJAZ13), JA-dependent phytoalexin synthesis (OsNOMT), and JA-regulated defence-related genes, such as OsBBTI2 and OsPR1a, accumulate after fungal infection in a pattern that correlates with the amplitude of resistance
