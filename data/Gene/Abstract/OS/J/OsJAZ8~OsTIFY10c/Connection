OsCOI1|OsCOI1a	OsJAZ8|OsTIFY10c	Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice	OsJAZ8 interacted with a putative OsCOI1, which is a component of the SCF(COI1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in a coronatine-dependent manner
OsJAZ8|OsTIFY10c	OsMYC2	Overexpression of OsMYC2 Results in the Up-Regulation of Early JA-Rresponsive Genes and Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice.	The up-regulation of OsMYC2 in response to JA was regulated by OsJAZ8
