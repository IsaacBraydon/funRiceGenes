OsJAZ11	development	OsJAZ11 regulates spikelet and seed development in rice.	OsJAZ11 regulates spikelet and seed development in rice.
OsJAZ11	development	OsJAZ11 regulates spikelet and seed development in rice.	 We propose that OsJAZ11 participates in the regulation of seed size and spikelet development by coordinating the expression of JA-related, OsGW7 and MADS genes
OsJAZ11	spikelet	OsJAZ11 regulates spikelet and seed development in rice.	OsJAZ11 regulates spikelet and seed development in rice.
OsJAZ11	spikelet	OsJAZ11 regulates spikelet and seed development in rice.	 Constitutive expression of OsJAZ11 dramatically influenced spikelet morphogenesis leading to extra glume-like structures, open hull, and abnormal numbers of floral organs
