OsJAC1	 Transgenic overexpression of OsJAC1 in rice resulted in quantitative broad-spectrum resistance against different pathogens including bacteria, oomycetes and fungi |  Both protein domains of OsJAC1 are required to establish resistance as indicated by single or combined transient expression of individual domains	 Transgenic overexpression of OsJAC1 in rice resulted in quantitative broad-spectrum resistance against different pathogens including bacteria, oomycetes and fungi
OsJAC1	Overexpression of OsJAC1, a Lectin Gene, Suppresses the Coleoptile and Stem Elongation in Rice |  Here we cloned the promoter of OsJAC1, and GUS activity was detected in young roots, coleoptiles, sheaths, leaves, nodes of stems, stems, rachises, pistils, stamens and lemmas of OsJAC1::GUS transgenic rice, suggesting that OsJAC1 is a constitutive expression gene in rice |  In addition, compared with coleoptiles of wild-type plants, those of OsJAC1 overexpression rice were more sensitive to JA treatment	Overexpression of OsJAC1, a Lectin Gene, Suppresses the Coleoptile and Stem Elongation in Rice |  In addition, compared with coleoptiles of wild-type plants, those of OsJAC1 overexpression rice were more sensitive to JA treatment
OsJAC1	Overexpression of rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin (OsJAC1) enhances resistance to ionizing radiation in Arabidopsis. | Time- and dose-dependent changes of OsJAC1 expression in rice were detected in response to gamma radiation |  Interestingly, OsJAC1 overexpression conferred hyper-resistance to gamma radiation in these plants | OsJAC1 overexpression may confer hyper-resistance to gamma radiation via activation of DNA damage perception and DNA damage checkpoints in Arabidopsis, implicating OsJAC1 as a key player in DNA damage response in plants	Overexpression of rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin (OsJAC1) enhances resistance to ionizing radiation in Arabidopsis. |  Interestingly, OsJAC1 overexpression conferred hyper-resistance to gamma radiation in these plants | OsJAC1 overexpression may confer hyper-resistance to gamma radiation via activation of DNA damage perception and DNA damage checkpoints in Arabidopsis, implicating OsJAC1 as a key player in DNA damage response in plants
