NA	Polarized Defence Against Fungal Pathogens Is Mediated by the Jacalin-Related Lectin Domain of Modular Poaceae-Specific Proteins.	2015	Mol Plant	Department of Plant Physiology, RWTH Aachen University, 52056 Aachen, Germany.	Modular proteins are an evolutionary answer to optimize performance of proteins that physically interact with each other for functionality. Using a combination of genetic and biochemical experiments, we characterized the rice protein OsJAC1 which consists of a jacalin-related lectin (JRL) domain predicted to bind mannose-containing oligosaccharides and a dirigent domain which might function in stereoselective coupling of monolignols. Transgenic overexpression of OsJAC1 in rice resulted in quantitative broad-spectrum resistance against different pathogens including bacteria, oomycetes and fungi. Overexpression of this gene or its wheat ortholog TAJA1 in barley enhanced resistance against the powdery mildew fungus. Both protein domains of OsJAC1 are required to establish resistance as indicated by single or combined transient expression of individual domains. Expression of artificially separated and fluorescence-tagged protein domains showed that the JRL domain is sufficient for targeting the powdery mildew penetration site. Nevertheless, co-localization of lectin- and dirigent-domain occurred. Phylogenetic analyses revealed orthologs of OsJAC1 exclusively within the Poaceae plant family. Dicots, by contrast, only contain proteins with either JRL or dirigent domain(s). Altogether, our results identify OsJAC1 as a representative of a novel type of resistance proteins derived from a plant-lineage specific gene fusion event for better function in local pathogen defense.
NA	Overexpression of OsJAC1, a Lectin Gene, Suppresses the Coleoptile and Stem Elongation in Rice	2007	Journal of Integrative Plant Biology	Research Center for Molecular & Developmental Biology, Key Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Environmental Molecular Physiology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China	Lectin plays an important role in defense signaling in plants, but its function in plant growth and development is not well known. Previously, we cloned a rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene OsJAC1 encoding a mannose-binding jacalin-related lectin, and found that OsJAC1 was jasmonic acid (JA) inducible. Here we cloned the promoter of OsJAC1, and GUS activity was detected in young roots, coleoptiles, sheaths, leaves, nodes of stems, stems, rachises, pistils, stamens and lemmas of OsJAC1::GUS transgenic rice, suggesting that OsJAC1 is a constitutive expression gene in rice. Moreover, OsJAC1-overexpressed (Ubi::OsJAC1) rice showed dwarfism with shorter coleptiles resulting from the failure of cell elongation of coleoptiles. In addition, compared with coleoptiles of wild-type plants, those of OsJAC1 overexpression rice were more sensitive to JA treatment. These data revealed that, besides its roles in defense response, lectin plays an important role in rice growth and development.
NA	Cloning and expression of a novel cDNA encoding a mannose-specific jacalin-related lectin from Oryza sativa.	2005	Toxicon	Research Center for Molecular and Developmental Biology, Key Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Environmental Molecular Physiology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	Lectin plays an important role in defense signaling in plants. A few genes of this family have been cloned. Here we report on a mannose-specific jacalin-related lectin in rice. Using sequence information of wheat gene VER2, which we had previously cloned, we were able to amplify a cDNA of OsJAC1 from Oryza sativa by RT-PCR. The cDNA of OsJAC1 was 1172 bp and contained a 921-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding dirigent (amino acids 26-139) and jacalin (amino acids 175-305) domains of 306 amino acids. Comparison of the OsJAC1 sequence with those of other lectins (jacalin) from rice, wheat and other species revealed that OsJAC1 had the 12 amino acid positions conserved in all mannose-binding lectins. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that OsJAC1 expression was present in stems, leaves and young spikes but not young roots; the expression was high in leaves and low in stems and spikes. And methyl jasmonate could induce the expression of OsJAC1. To test the activity of OsJAC1, the jacalin domain at the C-terminal was expressed in E. coli. BL21 (DE3). The purified recombinant protein could agglutinate red blood cells of rabbit, and the agglutination activity was strongly inhibited by mannose compared with other carbohydrates. These results indicate that lectin with dirigent and jacalin domains exists in rice as well as wheat. This is the first report of cDNA cloning of mannose-binding jacalin-related lectin with a dirigent domain in N-terminal region from O. sativa.
NA	Overexpression of rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin (OsJAC1) enhances resistance to ionizing radiation in Arabidopsis.	2019	BMC Plant Biol	Advanced Radiation Technology Institute, Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, 29 Geumgu-gil, Jeongeup-si, Jeollabuk-do, 56212, Republic of Korea.	Jacalin-related lectins in plants are important in defense signaling and regulate growth, development, and response to abiotic stress. We characterized the function of a rice mannose-binding jacalin-related lectin (OsJAC1) in the response to DNA damage from gamma radiation.Time- and dose-dependent changes of OsJAC1 expression in rice were detected in response to gamma radiation. To identify OsJAC1 function, OsJAC1-overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis plants were generated. Interestingly, OsJAC1 overexpression conferred hyper-resistance to gamma radiation in these plants. Using comparative transcriptome analysis, genes related to pathogen defense were identified among 22 differentially expressed genes in OsJAC1-overexpressing Arabidopsis lines following gamma irradiation. Furthermore, expression profiles of genes associated with the plant response to DNA damage were determined in these transgenic lines, revealing expression changes of important DNA damage checkpoint and perception regulatory components, namely MCMs, RPA, ATM, and MRE11.OsJAC1 overexpression may confer hyper-resistance to gamma radiation via activation of DNA damage perception and DNA damage checkpoints in Arabidopsis, implicating OsJAC1 as a key player in DNA damage response in plants. This study is the first report of a role for mannose-binding jacalin-related lectin in DNA damage.
