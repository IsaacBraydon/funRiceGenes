OsJAC1	resistance	Polarized Defence Against Fungal Pathogens Is Mediated by the Jacalin-Related Lectin Domain of Modular Poaceae-Specific Proteins.	Transgenic overexpression of OsJAC1 in rice resulted in quantitative broad-spectrum resistance against different pathogens including bacteria, oomycetes and fungi
OsJAC1	resistance	Polarized Defence Against Fungal Pathogens Is Mediated by the Jacalin-Related Lectin Domain of Modular Poaceae-Specific Proteins.	Both protein domains of OsJAC1 are required to establish resistance as indicated by single or combined transient expression of individual domains
OsJAC1	resistance	Polarized Defence Against Fungal Pathogens Is Mediated by the Jacalin-Related Lectin Domain of Modular Poaceae-Specific Proteins.	Altogether, our results identify OsJAC1 as a representative of a novel type of resistance proteins derived from a plant-lineage specific gene fusion event for better function in local pathogen defense

OsJAC1	jasmonic	Overexpression of OsJAC1, a Lectin Gene, Suppresses the Coleoptile and Stem Elongation in Rice	) gene OsJAC1 encoding a mannose-binding jacalin-related lectin, and found that OsJAC1 was jasmonic acid (JA) inducible
OsJAC1	 ja 	Overexpression of OsJAC1, a Lectin Gene, Suppresses the Coleoptile and Stem Elongation in Rice	In addition, compared with coleoptiles of wild-type plants, those of OsJAC1 overexpression rice were more sensitive to JA treatment

OsJAC1	JA	Overexpression of OsJAC1, a Lectin Gene, Suppresses the Coleoptile and Stem Elongation in Rice	In addition, compared with coleoptiles of wild-type plants, those of OsJAC1 overexpression rice were more sensitive to JA treatment
OsJAC1	jasmonate	Cloning and expression of a novel cDNA encoding a mannose-specific jacalin-related lectin from Oryza sativa.	And methyl jasmonate could induce the expression of OsJAC1
OsJAC1	methyl jasmonate	Cloning and expression of a novel cDNA encoding a mannose-specific jacalin-related lectin from Oryza sativa.	And methyl jasmonate could induce the expression of OsJAC1
