OsJAC1	resistance	Polarized Defence Against Fungal Pathogens Is Mediated by the Jacalin-Related Lectin Domain of Modular Poaceae-Specific Proteins.	 Transgenic overexpression of OsJAC1 in rice resulted in quantitative broad-spectrum resistance against different pathogens including bacteria, oomycetes and fungi
OsJAC1	resistance	Polarized Defence Against Fungal Pathogens Is Mediated by the Jacalin-Related Lectin Domain of Modular Poaceae-Specific Proteins.	 Both protein domains of OsJAC1 are required to establish resistance as indicated by single or combined transient expression of individual domains
OsJAC1	resistance	Polarized Defence Against Fungal Pathogens Is Mediated by the Jacalin-Related Lectin Domain of Modular Poaceae-Specific Proteins.	 Altogether, our results identify OsJAC1 as a representative of a novel type of resistance proteins derived from a plant-lineage specific gene fusion event for better function in local pathogen defense
