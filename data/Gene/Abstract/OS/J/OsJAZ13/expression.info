OsJAZ13	 The expression of OsJAZ13 was mainly activated in vegetative tissues and transiently responded to JA and ethylene |  Remarkably, overexpression of OsJAZ13a resulted in the attenuation of root by methyl JA |  Gene-expression analysis suggested the role of OsJAZ13 in modulating the expression of JA/ethylene response-related genes to regulate growth and activate hypersensitive cell death	 Remarkably, overexpression of OsJAZ13a resulted in the attenuation of root by methyl JA
