OsJAZ6	Ectopic Expression of OsJAZ6, which Interacts with OsJAZ1, Alters JA Signaling and Spikelet Development in Rice. |  In vivo protein distribution analysis revealed that the OsJAZ6 content is efficiently regulated during spikelet development, and biochemical and genetic evidence showed that OsJAZ6 is more sensitive to JA-mediated degradation and mis-expression experiments, we further showed that the protein stability and levels of OsJAZ6 orchestrate the output of JA signaling during rice spikelet development
