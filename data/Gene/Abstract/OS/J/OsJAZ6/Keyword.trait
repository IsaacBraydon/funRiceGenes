OsJAZ6	development	Ectopic Expression of OsJAZ6, which Interacts with OsJAZ1, Alters JA Signaling and Spikelet Development in Rice.	 Here, we found that OsJAZ6 interacts with OsJAZ1 depending on a single amino acid in the so-called ZIM domain of OsJAZ6 in rice JA signaling transduction and JA-regulated rice spikelet development
OsJAZ6	development	Ectopic Expression of OsJAZ6, which Interacts with OsJAZ1, Alters JA Signaling and Spikelet Development in Rice.	 In vivo protein distribution analysis revealed that the OsJAZ6 content is efficiently regulated during spikelet development, and biochemical and genetic evidence showed that OsJAZ6 is more sensitive to JA-mediated degradation and mis-expression experiments, we further showed that the protein stability and levels of OsJAZ6 orchestrate the output of JA signaling during rice spikelet development
OsJAZ6	spikelet	Ectopic Expression of OsJAZ6, which Interacts with OsJAZ1, Alters JA Signaling and Spikelet Development in Rice.
