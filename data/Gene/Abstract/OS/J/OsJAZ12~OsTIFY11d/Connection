OsJAZ12|OsTIFY11d	OsWRKY76	OsWRKY76 positively regulates drought stress via OsbHLH148-mediated jasmonate signaling in rice.	 Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsWRKY76 interacted with OsJAZ12
OsJAZ12|OsTIFY11d	OsWRKY76	OsWRKY76 positively regulates drought stress via OsbHLH148-mediated jasmonate signaling in rice.	 OsWRKY76 weakened the interaction between OsbHLH148 and OsJAZ12 in yeast cells
OsJAZ12|OsTIFY11d	OsWRKY76	OsWRKY76 positively regulates drought stress via OsbHLH148-mediated jasmonate signaling in rice.	 The OsJAZ12 protein repressed the transactivation activity of OsbHLH148, and this repression was partly restored by OsWRKY76 in rice protoplasts
