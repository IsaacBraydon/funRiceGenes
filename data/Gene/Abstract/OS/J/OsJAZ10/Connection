OsJAZ10|OsTIFY11b	OsMYC2	Overexpression of OsMYC2 Results in the Up-Regulation of Early JA-Rresponsive Genes and Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice.	A large-scale microarray analysis revealed that OsMYC2 up-regulated OsJAZ10 as well as many other defense-related genes
OsJAZ10|OsTIFY11b	OsMYC2	Overexpression of OsMYC2 Results in the Up-Regulation of Early JA-Rresponsive Genes and Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice.	OsMYC2 selectively bound to the G-box-like motif of the OsJAZ10 promoter in vivo and regulated the expression of early JA-responsive genes, but not of late JA-responsive genes
miR156	OsJAZ10|OsTIFY11b	Hydrogen peroxide regulates the Osa-miR156-OsSPL2/OsTIFY11b module in rice.	 Interactions between miR156 and OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b were confirmed using transient expression assays through agroinfiltration
miR156	OsJAZ10|OsTIFY11b	Hydrogen peroxide regulates the Osa-miR156-OsSPL2/OsTIFY11b module in rice.	 In addition, the levels of OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b transcripts were lower in transgenic rice plants overexpressing miR156 than in wild-type plants
miR156	OsJAZ10|OsTIFY11b	Hydrogen peroxide regulates the Osa-miR156-OsSPL2/OsTIFY11b module in rice.	 The results suggested that H(2) O(2) accumulation in rice suppresses the expression of miR156, and induces the expression of its target genes, OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b, whose proteins interact in the nucleus to regulate the expression of OsRBBI3-3, which is involved in plant defense
OsJAZ10|OsTIFY11b	OsMYC2	Hydrogen peroxide regulates the Osa-miR156-OsSPL2/OsTIFY11b module in rice.	 Furthermore, OsTIFY11b interacted with OsMYC2 to regulate the expression of OsRBBI3-3, which encodes a proteinase inhibitor
