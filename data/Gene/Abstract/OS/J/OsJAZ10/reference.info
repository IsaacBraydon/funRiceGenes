NA	Overexpression of OsMYC2 Results in the Up-Regulation of Early JA-Rresponsive Genes and Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	Plant Genome and Resource Research Center, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagawa University, Miki, Kagawa, 761-0795 Japan.	JASMONATE ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins act as transcriptional repressors of jasmonic acid (JA) responses and play a crucial role in the regulation of host immunity in plants. Here, we report that OsMYC2, a JAZ-interacting transcription factor in rice (Oryza sativa L.), plays an important role in the resistance response against rice bacterial blight, which is one of the most serious diseases in rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The results showed that OsMYC2 interacted with some OsJAZ proteins in a JAZ-interacting domain (JID)-dependent manner. The up-regulation of OsMYC2 in response to JA was regulated by OsJAZ8. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsMYC2 exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and were more resistant to Xoo. A large-scale microarray analysis revealed that OsMYC2 up-regulated OsJAZ10 as well as many other defense-related genes. OsMYC2 selectively bound to the G-box-like motif of the OsJAZ10 promoter in vivo and regulated the expression of early JA-responsive genes, but not of late JA-responsive genes. The nuclear localization of OsMYC2 depended on a nuclear localization signal within JID. Overall, we conclude that OsMYC2 acts as a positive regulator of early JA signals in the JA-induced resistance against Xoo in rice.
NA	Hydrogen peroxide regulates the Osa-miR156-OsSPL2/OsTIFY11b module in rice.	2023	Plant Cell Environ	Institute of Plant Biology and Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.	Field-grown rice (Oryza sativa L.), when exposed to various environmental stresses, produces high amounts of reactive oxygen species, such as H(2) O(2) . MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in plant stress responses. This study characterized the functions of H(2) O(2) -regulated miRNAs in rice. Small RNA deep sequencing revealed that miR156 levels decreased following H(2) O(2) treatment. Searches of the rice transcriptome and degradome databases indicated that OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b are miR156-target genes. Interactions between miR156 and OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b were confirmed using transient expression assays through agroinfiltration. In addition, the levels of OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b transcripts were lower in transgenic rice plants overexpressing miR156 than in wild-type plants. The OsSPL2-GFP and OsTIFY11b-GFP proteins were localized to the nucleus. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays indicated interactions between OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b. Furthermore, OsTIFY11b interacted with OsMYC2 to regulate the expression of OsRBBI3-3, which encodes a proteinase inhibitor. The results suggested that H(2) O(2) accumulation in rice suppresses the expression of miR156, and induces the expression of its target genes, OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b, whose proteins interact in the nucleus to regulate the expression of OsRBBI3-3, which is involved in plant defense.
