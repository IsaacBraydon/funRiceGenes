OsJRL	salinity	OsJRL, a rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin gene, enhances Escherichia coli viability under high-salinity stress and improves salinity tolerance of rice.	Overexpression of OsJRL in rice also enhanced salinity tolerance and increased the expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including three LEA (late embryogenesis abundant proteins) genes (OsLEA19a, OsLEA23 and OsLEA24), three Na(+) transporter genes (OsHKT1;3, OsHKT1;4 and OsHKT1;5) and two DREB genes (OsDREB1A and OsDREB2B)
OsJRL	tolerance	OsJRL, a rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin gene, enhances Escherichia coli viability under high-salinity stress and improves salinity tolerance of rice.	Overexpression of OsJRL in rice also enhanced salinity tolerance and increased the expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including three LEA (late embryogenesis abundant proteins) genes (OsLEA19a, OsLEA23 and OsLEA24), three Na(+) transporter genes (OsHKT1;3, OsHKT1;4 and OsHKT1;5) and two DREB genes (OsDREB1A and OsDREB2B)
OsJRL	cytoplasm	OsJRL, a rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin gene, enhances Escherichia coli viability under high-salinity stress and improves salinity tolerance of rice.	OsJRL was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm
OsJRL	stress	OsJRL, a rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin gene, enhances Escherichia coli viability under high-salinity stress and improves salinity tolerance of rice.	Based on these results, we suggest that OsJRL plays an important role in cell protection and stress signal transduction
OsJRL	transporter	OsJRL, a rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin gene, enhances Escherichia coli viability under high-salinity stress and improves salinity tolerance of rice.	Overexpression of OsJRL in rice also enhanced salinity tolerance and increased the expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including three LEA (late embryogenesis abundant proteins) genes (OsLEA19a, OsLEA23 and OsLEA24), three Na(+) transporter genes (OsHKT1;3, OsHKT1;4 and OsHKT1;5) and two DREB genes (OsDREB1A and OsDREB2B)
OsJRL	nucleus	OsJRL, a rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin gene, enhances Escherichia coli viability under high-salinity stress and improves salinity tolerance of rice.	OsJRL was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm
OsJRL	abscisic acid	OsJRL, a rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin gene, enhances Escherichia coli viability under high-salinity stress and improves salinity tolerance of rice.	Real time PCR analyses revealed that OsJRL expression showed tissue specificity in rice and was upregulated under diverse stresses, namely salt, drought, cold, heat and abscisic acid treatments
