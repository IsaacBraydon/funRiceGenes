The TIFY family is a novel plant-specific gene family involved in the regulation of diverse plant-specific biologic processes, such as development and responses to phytohormones, in Arabidopsis. However, there is limited information about this family in monocot species. This report identifies 20 TIFY genes in rice, the model monocot species. Sequence analysis indicated that rice TIFY proteins have conserved motifs beyond the TIFY domain as was previously shown in Arabidopsis. On the basis of their protein structures, members of the TIFY family can be divided into two groups. Transcript level analysis of OsTIFY genes in tissues and organs revealed different tempo-spatial expression patterns, suggesting that expression and function vary by stage of plant growth and development. Most of the OsTIFY genes were predominantly expressed in leaf. Nine OsTIFY genes were responsive to jasmonic acid and wounding treatments. Interestingly, almost all the OsTIFY genes were responsive to one or more abiotic stresses including drought, salinity, and low temperature. Over-expression of OsTIFY11a, one of the stress-inducible genes, resulted in significantly increased tolerance to salt and dehydration stresses. These results suggest that the OsTIFY family may have important roles in response to abiotic stresses. The data presented in this report provide important clues for further elucidating the functions of the genes in the OsTIFY family.
Plant Cell Physiol-2012-Yamada-2060-72.pdf	Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Kagawa University, Miki, Kagawa, 761-0795 Japan.	The plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) has a crucial role in both host immunity and development in plants. Here, we report the importance of JA signaling in the defense system of rice. Exogenous application of JA conferred resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) in rice. Expression of OsJAZ8, a rice jasmonate ZIM-domain protein, was highly up-regulated by JA. OsJAZ8 interacted with a putative OsCOI1, which is a component of the SCF(COI1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in a coronatine-dependent manner. OsJAZ8 also formed heterodimers with other OsJAZ proteins but did not form homodimer. JA treatment caused OsJAZ8 degradation and this degradation was dependent on the 26S proteasome pathway. Furthermore, the JA-dependent OsJAZ8 degradation was mediated by the Jas domain. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsJAZ8DeltaC, which lacks the Jas domain, exhibited a JA-insensitive phenotype. A large-scale analysis using a rice DNA microarray revealed that overexpression of OsJAZ8DeltaC altered the expression of JA-responsive genes, including defense-related genes, in rice. Furthermore, OsJAZ8DeltaC negatively regulated the JA-induced resistance to Xoo in rice. On the basis of these data, we conclude that JA plays an important role in resistance to Xoo, and OsJAZ8 acts as a repressor of JA signaling in rice.
NA	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.	2014	Plant Sci	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	The basic functions of plant-specific TIFY proteins as transcriptional regulators have been reported in plants. Some TIFY genes are responsive to abiotic stresses, but the functions of these genes in stress tolerance have seldom been reported. OsJAZ9 is a member of the JAZ subfamily which belongs to the TIFY gene family in rice (Oryza sativa). Suppression of OsJAZ9 resulted in reduced salt tolerance. The altered salt tolerance was mainly due to changes in ion (especially K(+)) homeostasis, which was supported by the altered expression levels of several ion transporter genes. The OsJAZ9-suppression rice plants showed increased sensitivity to jasmonic acid (JA) treatment. OsJAZ9 interacts with OsCOI1a, a component of the SCF(COI1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in a coronatine-dependent manner, suggesting that OsJAZ9 is involved in the regulation of JA signaling. OsJAZ9 interacts with several bHLH transcription factors including OsbHLH062 via the Jas domain. OsbHLH062 can bind to an E-box in the promoters of the ion transporter genes such as OsHAK21, and most of these ion transporter genes are responsive to JA treatment. We found that OsJAZ9 can also interact with OsNINJA, a rice homolog of the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptional repressor NINJA in JA signaling. Both OsJAZ9 and OsNINJA (Novel Interactor of JAZ) repressed OsbHLH062-mediated transcription activation. These results together suggest that OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator by forming a transcriptional regulation complex with OsNINJA and OsbHLH to fine tune the expression of JA-responsive genes involved in salt stress tolerance in rice.
