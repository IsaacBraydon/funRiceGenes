OsCOI1|OsCOI1a	OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.	OsJAZ9 interacts with OsCOI1a, a component of the SCF(COI1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in a coronatine-dependent manner, suggesting that OsJAZ9 is involved in the regulation of JA signaling
OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	SALT	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.
OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	SALT	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.	Suppression of OsJAZ9 resulted in reduced salt tolerance
OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	SALT	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.	These results together suggest that OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator by forming a transcriptional regulation complex with OsNINJA and OsbHLH to fine tune the expression of JA-responsive genes involved in salt stress tolerance in rice
OsbHLH1|OsbHLH062	OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.	OsJAZ9 interacts with several bHLH transcription factors including OsbHLH062 via the Jas domain
OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	OsMYB30	The OsMYB30 transcription factor suppresses cold tolerance by interacting with a JAZ protein and suppressing beta-amylase expression.	Furthermore, we identified an OsMYB30-interacting protein OsJAZ9 that had a significant effect in suppressing the transcriptional activation of OsMYB30 and in the repression of BMY genes mediated by OsMYB30
OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	OsMYB30	The OsMYB30 transcription factor suppresses cold tolerance by interacting with a JAZ protein and suppressing beta-amylase expression.	These results together suggested that OsMYB30 might be a novel regulator of cold tolerance through the negative regulation of the BMY genes by interacting with OsJAZ9 to fine tune the starch breakdown and the content of maltose which might contribute to the cold tolerance as a compatible solute
