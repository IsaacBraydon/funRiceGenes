OsCOI1|OsCOI1a	OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.	OsJAZ9 interacts with OsCOI1a, a component of the SCF(COI1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in a coronatine-dependent manner, suggesting that OsJAZ9 is involved in the regulation of JA signaling
OsbHLH1|OsbHLH062	OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.	OsJAZ9 interacts with several bHLH transcription factors including OsbHLH062 via the Jas domain
OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	OsMYB30|OsMYB5P	The OsMYB30 transcription factor suppresses cold tolerance by interacting with a JAZ protein and suppressing beta-amylase expression.	Furthermore, we identified an OsMYB30-interacting protein OsJAZ9 that had a significant effect in suppressing the transcriptional activation of OsMYB30 and in the repression of BMY genes mediated by OsMYB30
OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	OsMYB30|OsMYB5P	The OsMYB30 transcription factor suppresses cold tolerance by interacting with a JAZ protein and suppressing beta-amylase expression.	These results together suggested that OsMYB30 might be a novel regulator of cold tolerance through the negative regulation of the BMY genes by interacting with OsJAZ9 to fine tune the starch breakdown and the content of maltose which might contribute to the cold tolerance as a compatible solute
OsbHLH148	OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	Jasmonate Zim-Domain Protein 9 Interacts With Slender Rice 1 to Mediate the Antagonistic Interaction Between Jasmonic and Gibberellic Acid Signals in Rice.	 Based on this broader interaction, we explored the function of OsJAZ9 in JA and GA responses by analyzing transcript levels of the JA-responsive gene OsbHLH148 and the GA-responsive gene OsPIL14 in OsJAZ9-overexpressing (OsJAZ9-Ox) and osjaz9 mutant plants
OsbHLH148	OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	Jasmonate Zim-Domain Protein 9 Interacts With Slender Rice 1 to Mediate the Antagonistic Interaction Between Jasmonic and Gibberellic Acid Signals in Rice.	 By contrast, in osjaz9 mutants, the expression of OsbHLH148 was upregulated and the expression of OsPIL14 was downregulated
OsbHLH148	OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	Jasmonate Zim-Domain Protein 9 Interacts With Slender Rice 1 to Mediate the Antagonistic Interaction Between Jasmonic and Gibberellic Acid Signals in Rice.	 These observations indicated that OsJAZ9 regulates both JA and GA responses in rice, and this finding was supported by the opposite expression patterns of OsDREB1s, downstream targets of OsbHLH148 and OsPIL14, in the OsJAZ9-Ox and osjaz9 plants
OsJAZ8|OsTIFY10c	OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	Jasmonate Zim-Domain Protein 9 Interacts With Slender Rice 1 to Mediate the Antagonistic Interaction Between Jasmonic and Gibberellic Acid Signals in Rice.	 Analysis of protein-protein interactions showed that OsJAZ8 and OsJAZ9 interact with SLR1; OsJAZ9 also interacted with the SLR1-LIKE (SLRL) protein SLRL2
OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	OsPIL14|OsPIF14	Jasmonate Zim-Domain Protein 9 Interacts With Slender Rice 1 to Mediate the Antagonistic Interaction Between Jasmonic and Gibberellic Acid Signals in Rice.	 Based on this broader interaction, we explored the function of OsJAZ9 in JA and GA responses by analyzing transcript levels of the JA-responsive gene OsbHLH148 and the GA-responsive gene OsPIL14 in OsJAZ9-overexpressing (OsJAZ9-Ox) and osjaz9 mutant plants

OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	SLR1|OsGAI	Jasmonate Zim-Domain Protein 9 Interacts With Slender Rice 1 to Mediate the Antagonistic Interaction Between Jasmonic and Gibberellic Acid Signals in Rice.	 Together, these findings indicate that OsJAZ9 suppresses JA responses and promotes GA responses in rice, and the protein-protein interaction between OsJAZ9 and SLR1 is involved in the antagonistic interplay between JA and GA
OsJAZ8|OsTIFY10c	OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	Jasmonate Zim-Domain Protein 9 Interacts With Slender Rice 1 to Mediate the Antagonistic Interaction Between Jasmonic and Gibberellic Acid Signals in Rice.
