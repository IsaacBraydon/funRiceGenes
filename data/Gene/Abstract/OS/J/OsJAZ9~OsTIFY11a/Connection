OsCOI1|OsCOI1a	OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.	 OsJAZ9 interacts with OsCOI1a, a component of the SCF(COI1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in a coronatine-dependent manner, suggesting that OsJAZ9 is involved in the regulation of JA signaling
OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	SALT	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.
OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	SALT	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.	 Suppression of OsJAZ9 resulted in reduced salt tolerance
OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	SALT	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.	 These results together suggest that OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator by forming a transcriptional regulation complex with OsNINJA and OsbHLH to fine tune the expression of JA-responsive genes involved in salt stress tolerance in rice
OsbHLH1|OsbHLH062	OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.	 OsJAZ9 interacts with several bHLH transcription factors including OsbHLH062 via the Jas domain
