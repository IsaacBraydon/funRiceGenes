NA	Silencing an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Gene OsJMJ715 Enhances the Resistance of Rice to a Piercing-Sucking Herbivore by Activating ABA and JA Signaling Pathways.	2021	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology &amp; Ministry of Agriculture Key Lab of Agricultural Entomology, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	The RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases play an important role in plant growth, development, and defense responses to abiotic stresses and pathogens. However, their roles in the resistance of plants to herbivorous insects remain largely unknown. In this study, we isolated the rice gene OsJMJ715, which encodes a RING-domain containing protein, and investigated its role in rice resistance to brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens). OsJMJ715 is a nucleus-localized E3 ligase whose mRNA levels were upregulated by the infestation of gravid BPH females, mechanical wounding, and treatment with JA or ABA. Silencing OsJMJ715 enhanced BPH-elicited levels of ABA, JA, and JA-Ile as well as the amount of callose deposition in plants, which in turn increased the resistance of rice to BPH by reducing the feeding of BPH and the hatching rate of BPH eggs. These findings suggest that OsJMJ715 negative regulates the BPH-induced biosynthesis of ABA, JA, and JA-Ile and that BPH benefits by enhancing the expression of OsJMJ715.
