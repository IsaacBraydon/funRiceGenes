OsJar1|OsGH3.5|OsGH3-5	OsJAR2|OsGH3.3|OsGH3-3	OsJAR1 and OsJAR2 are jasmonyl-L-isoleucine synthases involved in wound- and pathogen-induced jasmonic acid signalling	 The expression levels of OsJAR1 and OsJAR2 were induced in response to wounding with the concomitant accumulation of JA-Ile
OsJar1|OsGH3.5|OsGH3-5	OsJAR2|OsGH3.3|OsGH3-3	OsJAR1 and OsJAR2 are jasmonyl-L-isoleucine synthases involved in wound- and pathogen-induced jasmonic acid signalling	OsJAR1 and OsJAR2 are jasmonyl-L-isoleucine synthases involved in wound- and pathogen-induced jasmonic acid signalling
OsJar1|OsGH3.5|OsGH3-5	PHYB|OsphyB	Rice JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 is involved in phytochrome and jasmonate signalling	 The analysis of OsJar1 expression in phytochrome (phy) mutants revealed that phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB) act redundantly to induce this gene by red light, presumably
OsJar1|OsGH3.5|OsGH3-5	PHYA	Rice JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 is involved in phytochrome and jasmonate signalling	 The analysis of OsJar1 expression in phytochrome (phy) mutants revealed that phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB) act redundantly to induce this gene by red light, presumably
OsJar1|OsGH3.5|OsGH3-5	PHYA	Rice JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 is involved in phytochrome and jasmonate signalling	 Unexpectedly, blue light-induced expression of OsJar1 gene was impaired in phyA-deficient mutants, indicating the involvement of phyA in the blue light signalling
OsARF19	OsJar1|OsGH3.5|OsGH3-5	The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.	The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.
OsARF19	OsJar1|OsGH3.5|OsGH3-5	The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrate that OsARF19 binds to the promoter of OsGH3-5 and brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (OsBRI1) directing their expression
