OsJar1|OsGH3.5|OsGH3-5	OsJAR2|OsGH3.3|OsGH3-3	OsJAR1 and OsJAR2 are jasmonyl-L-isoleucine synthases involved in wound- and pathogen-induced jasmonic acid signalling	 The expression levels of OsJAR1 and OsJAR2 were induced in response to wounding with the concomitant accumulation of JA-Ile
OsJar1|OsGH3.5|OsGH3-5	OsJAR2|OsGH3.3|OsGH3-3	OsJAR1 and OsJAR2 are jasmonyl-L-isoleucine synthases involved in wound- and pathogen-induced jasmonic acid signalling	OsJAR1 and OsJAR2 are jasmonyl-L-isoleucine synthases involved in wound- and pathogen-induced jasmonic acid signalling
OsJar1|OsGH3.5|OsGH3-5	PHYB|OsphyB	Rice JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 is involved in phytochrome and jasmonate signalling	 The analysis of OsJar1 expression in phytochrome (phy) mutants revealed that phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB) act redundantly to induce this gene by red light, presumably
OsJar1|OsGH3.5|OsGH3-5	PHYA|OsPhyA	Rice JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 is involved in phytochrome and jasmonate signalling	 The analysis of OsJar1 expression in phytochrome (phy) mutants revealed that phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB) act redundantly to induce this gene by red light, presumably
OsJar1|OsGH3.5|OsGH3-5	PHYA|OsPhyA	Rice JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 is involved in phytochrome and jasmonate signalling	 Unexpectedly, blue light-induced expression of OsJar1 gene was impaired in phyA-deficient mutants, indicating the involvement of phyA in the blue light signalling
OsARF19	OsJar1|OsGH3.5|OsGH3-5	The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.	The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.
OsARF19	OsJar1|OsGH3.5|OsGH3-5	The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrate that OsARF19 binds to the promoter of OsGH3-5 and brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (OsBRI1) directing their expression
OsCHX14	OsJar1|OsGH3.5|OsGH3-5	OsCHX14 is involved in the K+ homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa) flowers	 Expression profiling confirmed that among 17 CHX genes in rice, OsCHX14 was the only member that showed an expression polymorphism, not only in osjar1 mutants but also in RNAi lines of OsCOI1, another key member of the JA signaling pathway
