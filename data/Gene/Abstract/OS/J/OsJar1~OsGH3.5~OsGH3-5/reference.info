The synthesis of JA-Ile was catalysed by JA-Ile synthase, which is a member of the group I GH3 family of proteins. Here, we showed evidence that OsGH3.5 (OsJAR1) and OsGH3.3 (OsJAR2) are the functional JA-Ile synthases in rice, using recombinant proteins. The expression levels of OsJAR1 and OsJAR2 were induced in response to wounding with the concomitant accumulation of JA-Ile. In contrast, only the expression of OsJAR1 was associated with the accumulation of JA-Ile after blast infection. Our data suggest that these two JA-Ile synthases are differentially involved in the activation of JA signalling in response to wounding and pathogen challenge in rice.
21023589.pdf	The auxin-responsive GH3 gene family in rice (Oryza sativa)	2006	Funct Integr Genomics	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, Benito Juarez Road, New Delhi, 110021, India.	Auxin regulates plant growth and development by altering the expression of diverse genes. Among these, the genes of Aux/IAA, SAUR, and GH3 classes have been extensively studied in dicots, but little information is available on monocots. We have identified 12 members of GH3 gene family in rice using sequences of full-length cDNA clones available from KOME and analysis of the whole genome sequence of rice. The genomic organization as well as chromosomal location of all the OsGH3 genes is reported. The rice GH3 proteins can be classified in two groups (groups I and II) on the basis of their phylogenetic relationship with Arabidopsis GH3 proteins. Based upon the sequences available in the database, not a single group III GH3 protein could be identified in rice. An extensive survey of EST sequences of other monocots led to the conclusion that although GH3 gene family is highly conserved in both dicots and monocots but the group III is conspicuous by its absence in monocots. The in silico analysis has been complemented with experimental data to quantify transcript levels of all GH3 gene family members. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction, the organ-specific expression of individual OsGH3 genes in light- and dark-grown seedlings/plants has been examined. The transcript abundance of nearly all OsGH3 genes is enhanced on auxin treatment, with the effect more pronounced on OsGH3-1, -2, and -4. The functional validation of these genes in transgenics or analysis of gene-specific insertional mutants will help in elucidating their precise role in auxin signal transduction.

Jasmonate plays key roles in plant growth and stress responses, as in defense against pathogen attack. Jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), a major active form of jasmonates, is thought to play a pivotal role in plant defense responses, but the involvement of JA-Ile in rice defense responses, including phytoalexin production, remains largely unknown. Here we found that OsJAR1 contributes mainly to stress-induced JA-Ile production by the use of an osjar1 Tos17 mutant. The osjar1 mutant was impaired in JA-induced expression of JA-responsive genes and phytoalexin production, and these defects were restored genetically. Endogenous JA-Ile was indispensable to the production of a flavonoid phytoalexin, sakuranetin, but not to that of diterpenoid phytoalexins in response to heavy metal stress and the rice blast fungus. The osjar1 mutant was also found to be more susceptible to the blast fungus than the parental wild type. These results suggest that JA-Ile production makes a contribution to rice defense responses with a great impact on stress-induced sakuranetin production.

We isolated rice JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 (osjar1) mutants from the Tos17 mutant panel by BLAST search. In far-red and blue lights, osjar1 coleoptiles were longer if compared with the wild type (WT), indicating that OsJar1 participates in the suppression of coleoptile elongation in these light conditions, while the mutant did not show a clear phenotype in red light. The analysis of OsJar1 expression in phytochrome (phy) mutants revealed that phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB) act redundantly to induce this gene by red light, presumably. Unexpectedly, blue light-induced expression of OsJar1 gene was impaired in phyA-deficient mutants, indicating the involvement of phyA in the blue light signalling. In WT seedlings, OsJar1 transcripts were up-regulated transiently in response to treatment with exogenous methyl-jasmonic acid (MeJA). The dose-response curve of the MeJA treatment showed a characteristic pattern: concentrations as low as 4.5 nM could induce OsJar1 transcription, while the gene was superinduced at a concentration of 450 microM MeJA. In summary, this paper demonstrated that OsJar1 modulates light and JA signalling in the photomorphogenesis of rice.
jipb12057.pdf	Response of rice to insect elicitors and the role of OsJAR1 in wound and herbivory-induced JA-Ile accumulation	2013	J Integr Plant Biol	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan.	Plants produce jasmonic acid (JA) and its amino acid conjugate, jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) as major defense signals in response to wounding and herbivory. In rice (Oryza sativa), JA and JA-Ile rapidly increased after mechanical damage, and this increase was further amplified when the wounds were treated with oral secretions from generalist herbivore larvae, lawn armyworms (Spodoptera mauritia), revealing for the first time active perception mechanisms of herbivore-associated elicitor(s) in rice. In the rice genome, two OsJAR genes can conjugate JA and Ile and form JA-Ile in vitro; however, their function in herbivory-induced accumulation of JA-Ile has not been investigated. By functional characterization of TOS17 retrotransposon-tagged Osjar1 plants and their response to simulated herbivory, we show that OsJAR1 is essential for JA-Ile production in herbivore-attacked, field-grown plants. In addition, OsJAR1 was required for normal seed development in rice under field conditions. Our results suggest that OsJAR1 possesses at least two major functions in rice defense and development that cannot be complemented by the additional OsJAR2 gene function, although this gene previously showed overlapping enzyme activity in vitro.
