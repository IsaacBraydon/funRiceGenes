Nozoye-2011-Phytosiderophore eff.pdf	Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants	2011	J Biol Chem	Department of Global Agricultural Sciences, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657 Japan.	Eukaryotic organisms have developed diverse mechanisms for the acquisition of iron, which is required for their survival. Graminaceous plants use a chelation strategy. They secrete phytosiderophore compounds, which solubilize iron in the soil, and then take up the resulting iron-phytosiderophore complexes. Bacteria and mammals also secrete siderophores to acquire iron. Although phytosiderophore secretion is crucial for plant growth, its molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we show that the efflux of deoxymugineic acid, the primary phytosiderophore from rice and barley, involves the TOM1 and HvTOM1 genes, respectively. Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing TOM1 or HvTOM1 released (14)C-labeled deoxymugineic acid but not (14)C-labeled nicotianamine, a structural analog and biosynthetic precursor of deoxymugineic acid, indicating that the TOM1 and HvTOM1 proteins are the phytosiderophore efflux transporters. Under conditions of iron deficiency, rice and barley roots express high levels of TOM1 and HvTOM1, respectively, and the overexpression of these genes increased tolerance to iron deficiency. In rice roots, the efficiency of deoxymugineic acid secretion was enhanced by overexpression of TOM1 and decreased by its repression, providing further evidence that TOM1 encodes the efflux transporter of deoxymugineic acid. We have also identified two genes encoding efflux transporters of nicotianamine, ENA1 and ENA2. Our identification of phytosiderophore efflux transporters has revealed the final piece in the molecular machinery of iron acquisition in graminaceous plants.
pce2569.pdf	Identification of OsbHLH133 as a regulator of iron distribution between roots and shoots in Oryza sativa	2013	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry Joint Research Laboratory in Genomics and Nutriomics, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient element for plant growth. Regulation of Fe-deficiency signalling networks is one of the many functions reported for basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors in plants. In the present study, OsbHLH133 was found to be induced by Fe-deficiency conditions in Oryza sativa. Insertional inactivation of OsbHLH133 (bhlh133) resulted in growth retardation, with enhanced Fe concentration seen in shoots, and reduced Fe concentration in roots. Overexpression of OsbHLH133 had the opposite effect, that is resulted in an enhanced Fe concentration in roots and reduced Fe concentration in shoots and also in xylem sap. Microarray analysis showed that some of the genes encoding Fe-related functions were up-regulated under Fe-sufficient conditions, in bhlh133 mutant plants compared to wild-type plants. Significant differential expression of a number of signalling pathways, including calcium signalling, was also seen in bhlh133 plants compared to wild-type plants, independent of Fe conditions.
NA	Characterization of the Nicotianamine Exporter ENA1 in Rice.	2019	Front Plant Sci	Center for Liberal Arts, Meiji Gakuin University, Tokyo, Japan.	Under iron (Fe) deficiency, graminaceous plants produce and secrete Fe-chelating phytosiderophores of the mugineic acid (MA) family into the rhizosphere to solubilize and mediate uptake of sparingly soluble Fe in the soil. MAs and their biosynthetic intermediate, nicotianamine (NA), are also important for the translocation of divalent metals such as Fe and zinc (Zn) throughout the plant body. In this study, the physiological role of the efflux transporter EFFLUX TRANSPORTER OF NA (ENA1), which exports NA out of cells, was analyzed in rice. Promoter-GUS analysis showed that ENA1 was mainly expressed in roots, and strongly upregulated under Fe-deficient conditions. In epidermal onion cells and rice roots, green fluorescent protein-tagged ENA1 localized mainly to the plasma membrane, while a part of the fluorescence was observed in vesicular structures in the cytoplasm. In the younger stage after germination, ENA1-overexpressing rice plants exhibited truncated roots with many root hairs compared to wild-type plants, while these phenotype were not observed in high Zn-containing medium. In Arabidopsis, which use a different strategy for Fe uptake from rice, ENA1 overexpression did not show any apparent phenotypes. Oligo DNA microarray analysis in rice showed that ENA1 knockout affects the response to stress, especially in root plastids. These results suggest that ENA1 might be recycling between the plasma membrane and cellular compartments by vesicular transport, playing an important role in the transport of NA, which is important for the physiological response to Fe deficiency.
