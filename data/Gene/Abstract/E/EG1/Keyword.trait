EG1	floral meristem	A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice	 In this study, we report the cloning of the rice EXTRA GLUME1 (EG1) gene, a putative lipase gene that specifies empty-glume fate and floral meristem determinacy
EG1	floral meristem	A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice	 We also found that the floral meristem and organ identity gene OsLHS1 showed altered expression with respect to both pattern and levels in the eg1 mutant, and is probably responsible for the pleiotropic floral defects in eg1
EG1	meristem	A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice	 In this study, we report the cloning of the rice EXTRA GLUME1 (EG1) gene, a putative lipase gene that specifies empty-glume fate and floral meristem determinacy
EG1	meristem	A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice	 We also found that the floral meristem and organ identity gene OsLHS1 showed altered expression with respect to both pattern and levels in the eg1 mutant, and is probably responsible for the pleiotropic floral defects in eg1
EG1	spikelet	A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice	 As a putative class III lipase that functionally differs from any known plant lipase, EG1 reveals a novel pathway that regulates rice empty-glume fate and spikelet development
EG1	floral	A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice	 In this study, we report the cloning of the rice EXTRA GLUME1 (EG1) gene, a putative lipase gene that specifies empty-glume fate and floral meristem determinacy
EG1	floral	A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice	 In addition to affecting the identity and number of empty glumes, mutations in EG1 caused ectopic floral organs to be formed at each organ whorl or in extra ectopic whorls
EG1	floral	A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice	 EG1 is expressed strongly in inflorescence primordia and weakly in developing floral primordia
EG1	floral	A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice	 We also found that the floral meristem and organ identity gene OsLHS1 showed altered expression with respect to both pattern and levels in the eg1 mutant, and is probably responsible for the pleiotropic floral defects in eg1
EG1	inflorescence	A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice	 EG1 is expressed strongly in inflorescence primordia and weakly in developing floral primordia
EG1	JA biosynthesis	Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice	We show that EG1 is a plastid-targeted lipase that participates in JA biosynthesis, and EG2/OsJAZ1 is a JA signalling repressor that interacts with a putative JA receptor, OsCOI1b, to trigger OsJAZ1's degradation during spikelet development
