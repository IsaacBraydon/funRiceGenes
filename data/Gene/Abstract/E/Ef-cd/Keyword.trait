Ef-cd	nitrogen	Ef-cd locus shortens rice maturity duration without yield penalty.	 Ef-cd facilitates nitrogen utilization and also improves the photosynthesis rate
Ef-cd	grain	Ef-cd locus shortens rice maturity duration without yield penalty.	 Therefore, Ef-cd could be a vital contributor of elite early maturing hybrid varieties in balancing grain yield with maturity duration
Ef-cd	photosynthesis	Ef-cd locus shortens rice maturity duration without yield penalty.	 Ef-cd facilitates nitrogen utilization and also improves the photosynthesis rate
Ef-cd	grain yield	Ef-cd locus shortens rice maturity duration without yield penalty.	 Therefore, Ef-cd could be a vital contributor of elite early maturing hybrid varieties in balancing grain yield with maturity duration
Ef-cd	yield	Ef-cd locus shortens rice maturity duration without yield penalty.	Ef-cd locus shortens rice maturity duration without yield penalty.
Ef-cd	yield	Ef-cd locus shortens rice maturity duration without yield penalty.	 Field test comparisons of early maturing Ef-cd near-isogenic lines with their wild types as well as of the derivative early maturing hybrids with their wild-type hybrids conducted under different latitudes determined that the early maturing Ef-cd allele shortens maturity duration (ranging from 7 to 20 d) without a concomitant yield penalty
Ef-cd	yield	Ef-cd locus shortens rice maturity duration without yield penalty.	 Therefore, Ef-cd could be a vital contributor of elite early maturing hybrid varieties in balancing grain yield with maturity duration
