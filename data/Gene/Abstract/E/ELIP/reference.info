Haowen2011.pdf	Overexpression of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene OsTPS1 enhances abiotic stress tolerance in rice	2011	Planta	Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering Drug and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, People's Republic of China.	Trehalose plays an important role in metabolic regulation and abiotic stress tolerance in a variety of organisms. In plants, its biosynthesis is catalyzed by two key enzymes: trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP). The genome of rice (Oryza sativa) contains 11 OsTPS genes, and only OsTPS1 shows TPS activity. To demonstrate the physiological function of OsTPS1, we introduced it into rice and found that OsTPS1 overexpression improved the tolerance of rice seedling to cold, high salinity and drought treatments without other significant phenotypic changes. In transgenic lines overexpressing OsTPS1, trehalose and proline concentrations were higher than in the wild type and some stress-related genes were up-regulated, including WSI18, RAB16C, HSP70, and ELIP. These results demonstrate that OsTPS1 may enhance the abiotic stress tolerance of plants by increasing the amount of trehalose and proline, and regulating the expression of stress-related genes. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of some Class II TPSs also enhanced plant tolerance of abiotic stress. This work will help to clarify the role of trehalose metabolism in abiotic stress response in higher plants.
Iwasaki-1997-Cloning of cDNA enco.pdf	Cloning of cDNA encoding the rice 22 kDa protein of Photosystem II (PSII-S) and analysis of light-induced expression of the gene	1997	Gene	National Institute of Agrobiological Resources, Ibaraki, Japan.	Cloning of rice cDNA encoding the chlorophyll-binding 22 kDa protein of Photosystem II (PSII-S) and the light-induced expression of the gene are reported. One of the light-responsive cDNA clones, isolated by screening with a light-specific subtracted cDNA probe, was shown to encode PSII-S of rice. Genomic Southern analysis suggested that the PSII-S gene, psbS, is a single-copy gene in rice. A brief exposure to red light induced a severalfold increase in the steady state level of PSII-S transcripts in etiolated seedlings. The red light effect was reversed by far-red light, suggesting involvement of phytochrome in the PSII-S gene regulation. Prolonged exposure (3 h) to blue light, however, revealed a much stronger effect than red light on the accumulation of PSII-S transcripts in the etiolated seedlings. In dark-adapted green plants, prolonged exposure to blue light induced re-accumulation of transcripts encoding PSII-S, whereas red light had little effect.
