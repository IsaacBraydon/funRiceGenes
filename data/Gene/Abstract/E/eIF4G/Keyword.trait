eIF4G	resistance	Novel alleles of rice eIF4G generated by CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis confer resistance to Rice tungro spherical virus.	Novel alleles of rice eIF4G generated by CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis confer resistance to Rice tungro spherical virus.
eIF4G	resistance	Novel alleles of rice eIF4G generated by CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis confer resistance to Rice tungro spherical virus.	 To develop new sources of resistance to RTD, mutations in eIF4G were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in the RTSV-susceptible variety IR64, widely grown across tropical Asia
eIF4G	resistance	Novel alleles of rice eIF4G generated by CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis confer resistance to Rice tungro spherical virus.	 Among various mutated eIF4G alleles examined, only those resulting in in-frame mutations in SVLFPNLAGKS residues (mainly NL), adjacent to the YVV residues, conferred resistance
eIF4G	resistance	Genome Editing of Rice eIF4G Loci Confers Partial Resistance to Rice Black-Streaked Dwarf Virus	Genome Editing of Rice eIF4G Loci Confers Partial Resistance to Rice Black-Streaked Dwarf Virus
eIF4G	resistance	Genome Editing of Rice eIF4G Loci Confers Partial Resistance to Rice Black-Streaked Dwarf Virus	 To develop novel resources for resistance to RBSDV through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, a guide RNA sequence targeting exon 1 of eIF4G was designed and cloned into a binary vector, pHUE401
eIF4G	resistance	Genome Editing of Rice eIF4G Loci Confers Partial Resistance to Rice Black-Streaked Dwarf Virus	 These results indicate that site-specific mutation of rice eIF4G successfully conferred partial resistance specific to RBSDV associated with less transcription of eIF4G in mutants
eIF4G	dwarf	Genome Editing of Rice eIF4G Loci Confers Partial Resistance to Rice Black-Streaked Dwarf Virus	Genome Editing of Rice eIF4G Loci Confers Partial Resistance to Rice Black-Streaked Dwarf Virus
eIF4G	rice stripe virus	Genome Editing of Rice eIF4G Loci Confers Partial Resistance to Rice Black-Streaked Dwarf Virus	 However, the eif4g mutant plants showed the same sensitivity to rice stripe virus (RSV) infection as wild-type plants
