NA	Novel alleles of rice eIF4G generated by CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis confer resistance to Rice tungro spherical virus.	2018	Plant Biotechnol J	Genetics and Biotechnology Division, International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), DAPO Box 7777Metro 1277, Manila, Philippines.	Rice tungro disease (RTD) is a serious constraint in rice production across tropical Asia. RTD is caused by the interaction between Rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV) and Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV). RTSV resistance found in traditional cultivars has contributed to a reduction in the incidence of RTD in the field. Natural RTSV resistance is a recessive trait controlled by the translation initiation factor 4 gamma gene (eIF4G). The Y1059V1060V1061residues of eIF4G are known to be associated with the reactions to RTSV. To develop new sources of resistance to RTD, mutations in eIF4G were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in the RTSV-susceptible variety IR64, widely grown across tropical Asia. The mutation rates ranged from 36.0 to 86.6%, depending on the target site, and the mutations were successfully transmitted to the next generations. Among various mutated eIF4G alleles examined, only those resulting in in-frame mutations in SVLFPNLAGKS residues (mainly NL), adjacent to the YVV residues, conferred resistance. Furthermore, our data suggests that eIF4G is essential for normal development, as alleles resulting in truncated eIF4G could not be maintained in homozygous state. The final products with RTSV resistance and enhanced yield under greenhouse conditions were found to no longer contain the Cas9 sequence. Hence, the RTSV-resistant plants with the novel eIF4G alleles represent a valuable material to develop more diverse RTSV-resistant varieties. This article is protected by copyright.

NA	Single nucleotide polymorphisms in a gene for translation initiation factor (eIF4G) of rice (Oryza sativa) associated with resistance to Rice tungro spherical virus.	2010	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Department of Functional Crop Science, National Institute of Crop Sciences, Rural Development Administration, 1085 Neidong, Milyang, Gyeongnam, 627-803, Republic of Korea.	Rice tungro disease (RTD) is a serious constraint to rice production in South and Southeast Asia. RTD is caused by Rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV) and Rice tungro bacilliform virus. Rice cv. Utri Merah is resistant to RTSV. To identify the gene or genes involved in RTSV resistance, the association of genotypic and phenotypic variations for RTSV resistance was examined in backcross populations derived from Utri Merah and rice germplasm with known RTSV resistance. Genetic analysis revealed that resistance to RTSV in Utri Merah was controlled by a single recessive gene (tsv1) mapped within an approximately 200-kb region between 22.05 and 22.25 Mb of chromosome 7. A gene for putative translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G(tsv1)) was found in the tsv1 region. Comparison of eIF4G(tsv1) gene sequences among susceptible and resistant plants suggested the association of RTSV resistance with one of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites found in exon 9 of the gene. Examination of the SNP site in the eIF4G(tsv1) gene among various rice plants resistant and susceptible to RTSV corroborated the association of SNP or deletions in codons for Val(1060-1061) of the predicted eIF4G(tsv1) with RTSV resistance in rice.
NA	Genome Editing of Rice eIF4G Loci Confers Partial Resistance to Rice Black-Streaked Dwarf Virus	2021	Viruses	Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Food Quality and Safety-State Key Laboratory Cultivation Base, Institute of Plant Protection, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing 210014, China.	Rice black-streaked dwarf disease, caused by rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), is a serious constraint in Chinese rice production. Breeding disease-resistant varieties through multigene aggregation is considered an effective way to control diseases, but few disease-resistant resources have been characterized thus far. To develop novel resources for resistance to RBSDV through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, a guide RNA sequence targeting exon 1 of eIF4G was designed and cloned into a binary vector, pHUE401. This recombinant vector was used to generate mutations in the rice cultivar Nipponbare via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. This approach produced heritable homozygous mutations in the transgene-free T1 generation. Sequence analysis of the eIF4G target region from T1 transgenic plants identified 3 bp deletion mutants, and analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence identified one amino acid deletion in mutants that possess near full-length eIF4G. Furthermore, our data suggest that eIF4G may plays an important role in rice normal development, as there were no eIF4G knock-out homozygous mutants in T1 generation plants. When homozygous mutant lines were inoculated with RBSDV, they exhibited enhanced tolerance to virus infection, without visibly affecting plant growth and development. However, the eif4g mutant plants showed the same sensitivity to rice stripe virus (RSV) infection as wild-type plants. Notably, the wild-type and mutant N-termini of eIF4G interacted directly with RBSDV P8 in yeast and in planta. Additionally, compared to wild-type plants, the eIF4G transcript level was reduced twofold in the mutant plants. These results indicate that site-specific mutation of rice eIF4G successfully conferred partial resistance specific to RBSDV associated with less transcription of eIF4G in mutants. Therefore, this study demonstrates that the novel eIF4G alleles generated by CRISPR/Cas9 represent valuable disease-resistant resources that can be used to develop RBSDV-resistant varieties.
