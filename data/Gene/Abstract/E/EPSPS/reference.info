Kobayashi-2005-Evidence for an evol.pdf	Evidence for an evolutionary force that prevents epigenetic silencing between tail-to-tail rice genes with a short spacer	2005	Gene	Laboratory of Plant Breeding, Graduate School of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8589, Japan.	During the course of evolution, the genome should have toned down various types of genomic noise, such as those that cause the unstable expression or gene silencing observed in transgenic organisms. We found a rice genomic segment where two genes, encoding 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPs) and ribosomal protein small subunit 20 (rps20), are located in a tail-to-tail orientation and separated by only 300 bp of spacer. It is possible that this kind of structure would give rise to unstable expression due to antisense RNA derived from the neighboring gene. We examined this possibility using Northern blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and 3' RACE analyses, but obtained no evidence for instability or antisense RNAs of these housekeeping genes. Comparison of the sequences in the corresponding regions among related rice species revealed a lower level of genetic divergence of both the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTRs) than of the other noncoding regions; in particular both of the boundaries between the 3'-UTRs and the spacer were markedly conserved. The conservation of both the terminal regions is most likely the result of purifying selection, implying a functional role for the strict termination of the transcription of these genes to prevent gene-silencing-related events.
NA	Gene replacements and insertions in rice by intron targeting using CRISPR-Cas9.	2016	Nat Plants	State Key Laboratory of Plant Cell and Chromosome Engineering, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Sequence-specific nucleases have been exploited to create targeted gene knockouts in various plants(1), but replacing a fragment and even obtaining gene insertions at specific loci in plant genomes remain a serious challenge. Here, we report efficient intron-mediated site-specific gene replacement and insertion approaches that generate mutations using the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system. Using a pair of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting adjacent introns and a donor DNA template including the same pair of sgRNA sites, we achieved gene replacements in the rice endogenous gene 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) at a frequency of 2.0%. We also obtained targeted gene insertions at a frequency of 2.2% using a sgRNA targeting one intron and a donor DNA template including the same sgRNA site. Rice plants harbouring the OsEPSPS gene with the intended substitutions were glyphosate-resistant. Furthermore, the site-specific gene replacements and insertions were faithfully transmitted to the next generation. These newly developed approaches can be generally used to replace targeted gene fragments and to insert exogenous DNA sequences into specific genomic sites in rice and other plants.
NA	Overexpression of improved EPSPS gene results in field level glyphosate tolerance and higher grain yield in rice.	2020	Plant Biotechnol J.

Glyphosate is a popular, systemic, broad-spectrum herbicide used in modern agriculture. Being a structural analog of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), it inhibits 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) which is responsible for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids and various aromatic secondary metabolites. Taking a lead from glyphosate-resistant weeds, two mutant variants of the rice EPSPS gene were developed by amino acid substitution (T173I + P177S; TIPS-OsEPSPS and G172A + T173I + P177S; GATIPS-OsEPSPS). These mutated EPSPS genes were overexpressed in rice under the control of either native EPSPS or constitutive promoters (maize ubiquitin [ZmUbi] promoter). The overexpression of TIPS-OsEPSPS under the control of the ZmUbi promoter resulted in higher tolerance to glyphosate (up to three-fold of the recommended dose) without affecting the fitness and related agronomic traits of plants in both controlled and field conditions. Furthermore, such rice lines produced 17- 19% more grains compared to the wild type (WT) in the absence of glyphosate application and the phenylalanine and tryptophan contents in the transgenic seeds were found to be significantly higher in comparison to WT seeds. Our results also revealed that the native promoter guided expression of modified EPSPS genes did not significantly improve the glyphosate tolerance. The present study describing the introduction of a crop-specific TIPS mutation in class I aroA gene of rice and its overexpression have potential to substantially improve the yield and field level glyphosate-tolerance in rice. This is the first report to observe that the EPSPS has role to play in improving grain yield of rice.
