EPSPs|OsEPSPS	development	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology donor repair base editing confers glyphosate resistance to rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Here, we describe the development of glyphosate-resistant rice lines by site-specific amino acid substitutions (G172A, T173I, and P177S: GATIPS-mOsEPSPS) and modification of phosphoenolpyruvate-binding site in the native OsEPSPS gene employing fragment knockout and knock-in of homology donor repair (HDR) template harboring desired mutations through CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing
EPSPs|OsEPSPS	grain	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology donor repair base editing confers glyphosate resistance to rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Together, results highlighted that the efficacy of GATIPS mutations in OsEPSPS has tremendously contributed in glyphosate resistance (foliar spray of 6 ml/L), enhanced aromatic amino acids, and improved grain yields in rice
