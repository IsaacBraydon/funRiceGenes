NA	EARLY SENESCENCE 1 Encodes a SCAR-like Protein2 that Affects Water Loss in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	China National Rice Research Institute State Key Lab for Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China CITY: Hangzhou POSTAL_CODE: 311401 China [CN].	The global problem of drought threatens agricultural production and constrains the development of sustainable agricultural practices. In plants, excessive water loss causes drought stress and induces early senescence. In this study, we isolated a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, designated as early senescence 1 (es1), which exhibits early leaf senescence. The es1-1 leaves undergo water loss at the seedling stage (as reflected by whitening of the leaf margin and wilting) and display early senescence at the three-leaf stage. We used map-based cloning to identify ES1, which encodes a SCAR-like protein 2, a component of the SCAR/WAVE complex involved in actin polymerization and function. The es1-1 mutants exhibited significantly higher stomatal density. This resulted in excessive water loss and accelerated water flow in es1-1, also enhancing the water absorption capacity of the roots and water transport capacity of the stems, as well as promoting in vivo enrichment of metal ions co-transported with water. Expression of ES1 is higher in the leaves and leaf sheaths than in other tissues, consistent with its role in controlling water loss from leaves. GFP-ES1 fusion proteins were ubiquitously distributed in the cytoplasm of plant cells. Collectively, our data suggest that ES1 is important for regulating water loss in rice.
