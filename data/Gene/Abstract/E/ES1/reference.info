NA	EARLY SENESCENCE 1 Encodes a SCAR-like Protein2 that Affects Water Loss in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	China National Rice Research Institute State Key Lab for Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China CITY: Hangzhou POSTAL_CODE: 311401 China [CN].	The global problem of drought threatens agricultural production and constrains the development of sustainable agricultural practices. In plants, excessive water loss causes drought stress and induces early senescence. In this study, we isolated a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, designated as early senescence 1 (es1), which exhibits early leaf senescence. The es1-1 leaves undergo water loss at the seedling stage (as reflected by whitening of the leaf margin and wilting) and display early senescence at the three-leaf stage. We used map-based cloning to identify ES1, which encodes a SCAR-like protein 2, a component of the SCAR/WAVE complex involved in actin polymerization and function. The es1-1 mutants exhibited significantly higher stomatal density. This resulted in excessive water loss and accelerated water flow in es1-1, also enhancing the water absorption capacity of the roots and water transport capacity of the stems, as well as promoting in vivo enrichment of metal ions co-transported with water. Expression of ES1 is higher in the leaves and leaf sheaths than in other tissues, consistent with its role in controlling water loss from leaves. GFP-ES1 fusion proteins were ubiquitously distributed in the cytoplasm of plant cells. Collectively, our data suggest that ES1 is important for regulating water loss in rice.
NA	Rice TUTOU1 Encodes a SCAR-like Protein that Is Important for Actin Organization and Panicle Development.	2015	Plant Physiol	Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences CITY: Beijing POSTAL_CODE: 100000 China [CN] jtbai@genetics.ac.cn.	Panicle development, a key event in rice (Oryza sativa) reproduction and a critical determinant of grain yield, forms a branched structure containing multiple spikelets. Genetic and environmental factors can perturb panicle development, causing panicles to degenerate, and producing characteristic whitish, small spikelets with severely reduced fertility and yield; however, little is known about the molecular basis of the formation of degenerating panicles in rice. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the rice panicle degenerative mutant tutou1 (tut1), which shows severe defects in panicle development. The tut1 also shows a pleiotropic phenotype, characterized by short roots, reduced plant height, and abnormal development of anthers and pollen grains. Molecular genetic studies revealed that TUT1 encodes a SCAR/WAVE (suppressor of cAMP receptor/WASP family verprolin-homologous) like protein. We found that TUT1 contains conserved functional domains found in eukaryotic SCAR/WAVE proteins, and was able to activate Arp2/3 to promote actin nucleation and polymerization in vitro. Consistently, tut1mutants show defects in the arrangement of actin filaments in trichome. These results indicate that TUT1 is a functional SCAR/WAVE protein and plays an important role in panicle development.
