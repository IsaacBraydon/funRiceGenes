NA	Earlier Degraded Tapetum1 (EDT1) encodes an ATP-citrate lyase required for tapetum programmed cell death.	2019	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University CITY: Nanjing China [CN].	In flowering plants, the tapetum cells in anthers undergo programmed cell death (PCD) at the late meiotic stage, providing nutrients for further development of microspores, including the formation of the pollen wall. However, the molecular basis of tapetum PCD remains elusive. Here, we report a tapetum PCD-related mutant in rice (Oryza sativa), earlier degraded tapetum 1 (edt1), that shows complete pollen abortion associated with earlier-than-programmed tapetum cell death. EDT1 encodes a subunit of ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), and is specifically expressed in the tapetum of anthers. EDT1 localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm as observed in rice protoplast transient assays. We demonstrated that the A and B subunits of ACL interacted with each other and might function as a heteromultimer in the cytoplasm. EDT1 catalyzes the critical steps in cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis. Our data indicated a decrease in ATP level, energy charge and fatty acid content in mutant edt1 anthers. In addition, the genes encoding secretory proteases or lipid transporters, and the transcription factors known to regulate PCD, were down regulated. Our results demonstrate that the timing of tapetum PCD must be tightly regulated for successful pollen development, and that EDT1 is involved in the tapetum PCD process. This study furthers our understanding of the molecular basis of pollen fertility and fecundity in rice and may also be relevant to other flowering plants.
NA	Gene Expression Dynamics in Rice Peduncles at the Heading Stage	2020	Front Genet	Grass Genetics and Informatics Group, School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.	Improving grain yield in the staple food crop rice has been long sought goal of plant biotechnology. One of the traits with significant impact on rice breeding programs is peduncle elongation at the time of heading failing which leads to significant reduction in grain yield due to incomplete panicle exsertion. To decipher transcriptional dynamics and molecular players underlying peduncle elongation, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of elongating and non-elongating peduncles in two Indian cultivars, Swarna and Pokkali, at the time of heading. Along with genes associated with cell division and cell wall biosynthesis, we observed significant enrichment of genes associated with auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis/signaling in the elongating peduncles before heading in both the genotypes. Similarly, genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and mobilization, abiotic stress response along with cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene biosynthesis/signaling were enriched in non-elongating peduncles post heading. Significant enrichment of genes belonging to key transcription factor families highlights their specialized roles in peduncle elongation and grain filling before and after heading, respectively. A comparison with anther/pollen development-related genes provided 76 candidates with overlapping roles in anther/pollen development and peduncle elongation. Some of these are important for carbohydrate remobilization to the developing grains. These can be engineered to combat with incomplete panicle exsertion in male sterile lines and manipulate carbohydrate dynamics in grasses. Overall, this study provides baseline information about potential target genes for engineering peduncle elongation with implications on plant height, biomass composition and grain yields in rice.
