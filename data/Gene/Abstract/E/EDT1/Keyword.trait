EDT1	pollen	Earlier Degraded Tapetum1 (EDT1) encodes an ATP-citrate lyase required for tapetum programmed cell death.	 Our results demonstrate that the timing of tapetum PCD must be tightly regulated for successful pollen development, and that EDT1 is involved in the tapetum PCD process
EDT1	cytoplasm	Earlier Degraded Tapetum1 (EDT1) encodes an ATP-citrate lyase required for tapetum programmed cell death.	 EDT1 localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm as observed in rice protoplast transient assays
EDT1	nucleus	Earlier Degraded Tapetum1 (EDT1) encodes an ATP-citrate lyase required for tapetum programmed cell death.	 EDT1 localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm as observed in rice protoplast transient assays
EDT1	tapetum	Earlier Degraded Tapetum1 (EDT1) encodes an ATP-citrate lyase required for tapetum programmed cell death.	 EDT1 encodes a subunit of ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), and is specifically expressed in the tapetum of anthers
EDT1	tapetum	Earlier Degraded Tapetum1 (EDT1) encodes an ATP-citrate lyase required for tapetum programmed cell death.	 Our results demonstrate that the timing of tapetum PCD must be tightly regulated for successful pollen development, and that EDT1 is involved in the tapetum PCD process
