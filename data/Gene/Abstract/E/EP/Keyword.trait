EP	grain yield	Identification and characterization of the erect-pose panicle gene EP conferring high grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	The breeding of japonica varieties with erect-pose panicle (EP) has recently progressed in the northern part of China, because these varieties exhibit a far higher grain yield than the varieties with normal-pose panicle (NP)
EP	grain yield	Identification and characterization of the erect-pose panicle gene EP conferring high grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Experimental results showed that EP gene markedly enhanced grain yield, chiefly by increasing number of secondary branches and number of grains on the secondary branch

EP	panicle	Identification and characterization of the erect-pose panicle gene EP conferring high grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Based on previous studies, map-based cloning of EP locus was conducted using Liaojing5, Toyonishiki, their F(2) population, and a pair of near-isogenic lines for EP locus (ZF14 and WF14) derived from the cross between the two varieties; consequently, the STS marker H90 was found to completely cosegregate with panicle pose
