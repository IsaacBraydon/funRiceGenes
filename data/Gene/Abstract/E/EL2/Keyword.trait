EL2	defense response	Two novel genes rapidly and transiently activated in suspension-cultured rice cells by treatment with N-acetylchitoheptaose, a biotic elicitor for phytoalexin production	As shown in Fig2, a low level of mRNA for EL2 was detected in the non-treated cells, impling that EL2 gene product might play some role(s) in non-differentiated calli as well as in the defense response.
