EPAD1	pollen	Grass-Specific EPAD1 Is Essential for Pollen Exine Patterning in Rice	Grass-Specific EPAD1 Is Essential for Pollen Exine Patterning in Rice
EPAD1	reproductive	Grass-Specific EPAD1 Is Essential for Pollen Exine Patterning in Rice	 EPAD1 is specifically expressed in male meiocytes, indicating that reproductive cells exert genetic control over exine patterning
EPAD1	plasma membrane	Grass-Specific EPAD1 Is Essential for Pollen Exine Patterning in Rice	 EPAD1 possesses an N-terminal signal peptide and three redundant glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor sites at its C-terminus, segments required for its function and localization to the microspore plasma membrane
EPAD1	plasma membrane	Grass-Specific EPAD1 Is Essential for Pollen Exine Patterning in Rice	 We propose that plasma membrane lipids bound by EPAD1 may be involved in recruiting and arranging regulatory proteins in the primexine to drive correct exine deposition
EPAD1	microspore	Grass-Specific EPAD1 Is Essential for Pollen Exine Patterning in Rice	 EPAD1 possesses an N-terminal signal peptide and three redundant glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor sites at its C-terminus, segments required for its function and localization to the microspore plasma membrane
EPAD1	male sterility	Grass-Specific EPAD1 Is Essential for Pollen Exine Patterning in Rice	 Disruption of EPAD1 leads to abnormal exine pattern and complete male sterility, although sporopollenin biosynthesis is unaffected
