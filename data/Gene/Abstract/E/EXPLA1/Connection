EXPLA1	GW2|OsGW2	GW2 Functions as an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase for Rice Expansin-Like 1.	 Here, we show that rice Grain Width 2 (GW2), a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, can control seed development by catalyzing the ubiquitination of expansin-like 1 (EXPLA1), a cell wall-loosening protein that increases cell growth
EXPLA1	GW2|OsGW2	GW2 Functions as an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase for Rice Expansin-Like 1.	 Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down assays showed a strong interaction between GW2 and EXPLA1
EXPLA1	GW2|OsGW2	GW2 Functions as an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase for Rice Expansin-Like 1.	 In vitro ubiquitination analysis demonstrated that EXPLA1 was ubiquitinated by GW2 at lysine 279 (K279)
EXPLA1	GW2|OsGW2	GW2 Functions as an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase for Rice Expansin-Like 1.	 GW2 and EXPLA1 colocalized to the nucleus when expressed simultaneously
EXPLA1	GW2|OsGW2	GW2 Functions as an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase for Rice Expansin-Like 1.	 These results suggest that GW2 negatively regulates seed size by targeting EXPLA1 for degradation through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity
