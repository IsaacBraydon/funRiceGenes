EXPLA1	seed	GW2 Functions as an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase for Rice Expansin-Like 1.	 These results suggest that GW2 negatively regulates seed size by targeting EXPLA1 for degradation through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity
EXPLA1	nucleus	GW2 Functions as an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase for Rice Expansin-Like 1.	 GW2 and EXPLA1 colocalized to the nucleus when expressed simultaneously
EXPLA1	seed size	GW2 Functions as an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase for Rice Expansin-Like 1.	 These results suggest that GW2 negatively regulates seed size by targeting EXPLA1 for degradation through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity
EXPLA1	Ubiquitin	GW2 Functions as an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase for Rice Expansin-Like 1.	 These results suggest that GW2 negatively regulates seed size by targeting EXPLA1 for degradation through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity
