DTD|EAT1	TIP2|bHLH142	The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.	We revealed that TIP2 acts upstream of TDR and EAT1 and directly regulates the expression of TDR and EAT1.
DTC1	DTD|EAT1	Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.	 Moreover, levels of DTC1 transcripts are diminished in udt1, tdr, and eat1 anthers
