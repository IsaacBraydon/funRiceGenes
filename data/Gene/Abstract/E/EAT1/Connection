DTD|EAT1	TIP2|bHLH142	The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.	We revealed that TIP2 acts upstream of TDR and EAT1 and directly regulates the expression of TDR and EAT1.
DTC1	DTD|EAT1	Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.	Moreover, levels of DTC1 transcripts are diminished in udt1, tdr, and eat1 anthers
DTD|EAT1	OsTDF1	The functional analysis of OsTDF1 reveals a conserved genetic pathway for tapetal development between rice and Arabidopsis	The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that OsTDF1 acts downstream of UDT1 and upstream of TDR, EAT1, OsMYB103 and PTC1 in rice, suggesting that the genetic pathway for tapetum development is generally conserved between rice and Arabidopsis
