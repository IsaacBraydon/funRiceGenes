Ehd3	heading date	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	Transcript levels of OsGI, phytochrome genes, and Early heading date3 (Ehd3), which function upstream of Ghd7, were unchanged in the mutant
Ehd3	heading date	Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering	We report here that an early heading date 3 (ehd3) mutant flowered later than wild-type plants, particularly under LD conditions, regardless of the Hd1-deficient background
Ehd3	flower	Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering	We report here that an early heading date 3 (ehd3) mutant flowered later than wild-type plants, particularly under LD conditions, regardless of the Hd1-deficient background
Ehd3	flower	Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering	To identify the role of Ehd3 within the gene regulatory network for rice flowering, we compared the transcript levels of genes related to rice flowering in wild-type plants and ehd3 mutants
Ehd3	flower	Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering	Furthermore, Ehd3 ghd7 plants flowered earlier and show higher Ehd1 transcript levels than ehd3 ghd7 plants, suggesting a Ghd7-independent role of Ehd3 in the upregulation of Ehd1
Ehd3	flower	Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering	Our results demonstrate that the PHD-finger gene Ehd3 acts as a promoter in the unique genetic pathway responsible for photoperiodic flowering in rice
Ehd3	flower	Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering	Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering
Ehd3	floral	Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering	Increased transcription of Ghd7 under LD conditions and reduced transcription of downstream Ehd1 and FT-like genes in the ehd3 mutants suggested that Ehd3 normally functions as an LD downregulator of Ghd7 in floral induction
