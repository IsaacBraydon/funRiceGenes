OseIF3e|EIF3E	fertility	Inhibition of a basal transcription factor 3-like gene Osj10gBTF3 in rice results in significant plant miniaturization and typical pollen abortion	 Furthermore, the pollen that developed was completely sterile, which was correlated with the altered expression of two Rf (fertility restorer)-like genes that encode pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins OsPPR676 and OsPPR920, translational initiation factors OseIF3e and OseIF3h, and the heat shock protein OsHSP82

OseIF3e|EIF3E	growth	The Rice Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 Subunit e (OseIF3e) Influences Organ Size and Pollen Maturation.	 These results suggested although OseIF3e is not a &quot;functional core&quot; subunit of eIF3, it still plays crucial roles in rice growth and development, in combination with other factors
OseIF3e|EIF3E	pollen	The Rice Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 Subunit e (OseIF3e) Influences Organ Size and Pollen Maturation.	 Repression of OseIF3e led to defects in pollen maturation but did not affect pollen mitosis
OseIF3e|EIF3E	pollen	The Rice Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 Subunit e (OseIF3e) Influences Organ Size and Pollen Maturation.
