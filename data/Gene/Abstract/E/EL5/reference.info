1-s2.0-S0168945200003903-main.pdf	Isolation and analysis of expression mechanisms of a rice gene, EL5, which shows structural similarity to ATL family from Arabidopsis, in response to N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor	2001	Plant Science	Institute of Applied Biochemistry, University of Tsukuba, 305-8072, Tsukuba, Japan	Two rice cDNAs, EL5 and RRF1, were isolated and characterized. EL5 was responsive to N-acetylchitooligosaccharide, a biotic elicitor active in suspension-cultured rice cells. The structural specificity of the elicitor required for the expression of EL5 was consistent with other defense reactions observed in the experimental system, indicating that the elicitor signal to EL5 is transmitted through a single class of receptor-mediated recognition events. However, the intracellular signaling pathway to EL5 was distinct from those to other elicitor-responsive genes. Sequence analysis and alignment showed that a genomic sequence stored in rice genome databases in addition to EL5 and RRF1 belongs to the ATL family of RING-H2 finger motif proteins first isolated from Arabidopsis.

EL5, a rice gene responsive to N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor, encodes a RING-H2 finger protein with structural features common to the plant-specific ATL family. We show that the fusion protein of EL5 with maltose binding protein (MBP) was polyubiquitinated by incubation with ubiquitin, ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), and the Ubc4/5 subfamily of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). EL5 possesses the activity to catalyse the transfer of ubiquitin to the MBP moiety, and the RING-H2 finger motif of EL5 is necessary for this activity. Thus, we concluded that EL5 represents a ubiquitin ligase (E3). We also show that two rice E2s (OsUBC5a, OsUBC5b) of the Ubc4/5 subfamily function as E2 which catalyses EL5-mediated ubiquitination, and OsUBC5b was induced by elicitor, as well as EL5. These results strongly suggest that EL5 and OsUBC5b have roles in plant defense response through the turnover of protein(s) via the ubiquitin/proteasome system.
j.1365-313X.2007.03120.x.pdf	RING-H2 type ubiquitin ligase EL5 is involved in root development through the maintenance of cell viability in rice	2007	Plant J	Division of Plant Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai, 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	Rice EL5 is an ATL family gene characterized by a transmembrane domain at the N-terminal and a RING-H2 finger domain (RFD), which exhibits ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity. To elucidate the physiological roles of EL5, we analyzed transgenic rice plants overexpressing mutant EL5 proteins that are impaired in E3 activity to various degrees. Plants expressing EL5C153A and EL5W165A, which encode an inactive E3, showed a rootless phenotype accompanied by cell death in root primordia, and those expressing EL5V162A, with moderately impaired E3 activity, formed short crown roots with necrotic lateral roots. The dominant-negative phenotype was specifically observed in root meristems where EL5 is expressed, and not recovered by exogenous auxin. When wild-type EL5 was transcriptionally overexpressed, the EL5 protein was barely detected by Western blotting. Neither treatment with a proteasome inhibitor nor mutation of the sole lysine residue, a potential target of ubiquitination, resulted in increased EL5 accumulation, whereas mutations in the RFD led to increased EL5 accumulation. The stabilized EL5 without the RFD was localized in the plasma membrane. Deletion of the transmembrane domain prevented the EL5 from localizing in the membrane and from exerting an inhibitory effect on root formation. Deletion of the C-terminal region also neutralized the negative effect. We concluded that EL5 plays a major role as a membrane-anchored E3 for the maintenance of cell viability after the initiation of root primordial formation. In addition, we propose that EL5 is an unstable protein, of which degradation is regulated by the RFD in a proteasome-independent manner.
psb0302_0148.pdf	EL5 is involved in root development as an anti-cell death ubiquitin ligase	2008	Plant Signal Behav	Division of Plant Sciences; National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences; Tsukuba, Japan.	Ubiquitin ligase (E3) plays a central role in substrate recognition during ubiquitination, a post-translational modification of proteins. Rice EL5 is an E3 with a RING-H2 finger domain (RFD) and its transcript is upregulated by a chitin elicitor. The EL5-RFD has been intensively studied and demonstrated to exhibit E3 activity. Its three-dimensional structure was determined for the first time in plant E3, and the amino acid residues required for the interaction with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) were identified. Recent analyses revealed that EL5 plays a crucial role as an E3 in the maintenance of cell viability during root development in rice. In this addendum, we report that the EL5-RFD catalyzes polyubiquitination via the Lys48 residue of ubiquitin. We also discuss the possible role of EL5 as an anti-cell death enzyme. We hypothesize that EL5 might be responsible for mediating the degradation of cytotoxic proteins produced in root cells after the actions of phytohormones.
NA	Rice ubiquitin ligase EL5 prevents root meristematic cell death under high nitrogen conditions and interacts with a cytosolic GAPDH.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	a National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences ; Tsukuba , 305-8602 Japan ;	Root formation in rice transformants overexpressing mutated EL5 (mEL5) was severely inhibited because of meristematic cell death. Cell death was caused by nitrogen sources, particularly nitrate forms, in the culture medium. Nitrite treatment increased the cytokinin contents in roots, but mEL5 contained more cytokinins than non-transformants. Transcriptome profiling showed overlaps between nitrite-responsive genes in non-transformants and genes with altered expression in untreated mEL5. These results indicate that impairment of EL5 function activates nitrogen signaling despite the absence of a nitrogen source. Physical interaction between the EL5 C-terminal region and a cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, OsGapC2, was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Elucidation of the role of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in oxidative cell death in plants is expected in future.
