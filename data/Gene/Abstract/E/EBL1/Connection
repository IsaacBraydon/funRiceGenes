EBL1	OsACO1	Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice	 Since the OsEREBP1-like gene EBL1 (OsEREBP1-LIKE 1) was significantly downregulated in phyAphyBphyC mutants, EBL1 was suspected to repress ACO1 expression in wild-type plants| However, ACO1 was downregulated in EBL1 RNA interference plants, and the total length of these plants was slightly shorter than that of wild-type plants| This study shows that EBL1 is positively regulated by phytochrome B and associated with ACO1 upregulation|Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice
