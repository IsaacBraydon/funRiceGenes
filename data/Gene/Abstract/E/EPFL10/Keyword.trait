EPFL10	yield	Paralog editing tunes rice stomatal density to maintain photosynthesis and improve drought tolerance.	 Moderate reductions in stomatal density achieved by editing EPFL10 present a climate-adaptive approach for safeguarding yield in rice
EPFL10	stomatal	Paralog editing tunes rice stomatal density to maintain photosynthesis and improve drought tolerance.	 epfl10 lines with moderate reductions in stomatal density were able to conserve water to similar extents as stomagen lines but did not suffer from the concomitant reductions in stomatal conductance, carbon assimilation, or thermoregulation observed in stomagen knockouts
