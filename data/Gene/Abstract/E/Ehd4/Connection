Ehd4	Hd3a	Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice	We show that Ehd4 up-regulates the expression of the "florigen" genes Hd3a and RFT1 through Ehd1, but it acts independently of other known Ehd1 regulators
Ehd4	OsGI-Hd1-Hd3a|RFT1	Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice	We show that Ehd4 up-regulates the expression of the "florigen" genes Hd3a and RFT1 through Ehd1, but it acts independently of other known Ehd1 regulators
Ehd1	Ehd4	Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice	Here, we report isolation and characterization of a positive regulator of Ehd1, Early heading date 4 (Ehd4)
Ehd1	Ehd4	Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice	Ehd4 expression is most active in young leaves with a diurnal expression pattern similar to that of Ehd1 under both short-day and long-day conditions
Ehd1	Ehd4	Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice	We show that Ehd4 up-regulates the expression of the "florigen" genes Hd3a and RFT1 through Ehd1, but it acts independently of other known Ehd1 regulators
Ehd1	Ehd4	Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice	We conclude that Ehd4 is a novel Oryza-genus-specific regulator of Ehd1, and it plays an essential role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice
