Ehd4	flower	Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice	 ehd4 mutants showed a never flowering phenotype under natural long-day conditions| We conclude that Ehd4 is a novel Oryza-genus-specific regulator of Ehd1, and it plays an essential role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice|Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice
Ehd4	flowering time	Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice	 We conclude that Ehd4 is a novel Oryza-genus-specific regulator of Ehd1, and it plays an essential role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice
Ehd4	heading date	Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice	 Here, we report isolation and characterization of a positive regulator of Ehd1, Early heading date 4 (Ehd4)
