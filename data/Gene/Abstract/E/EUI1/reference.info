The recessive 'tall rice' phenotype associated with the mutation eui (elongated upper-most internode) is an important agronomic trait that has been introduced into hybrid rice to eliminate panicle enclosure in all types of male-sterile lines and produce good-quality seeds in high yield and at low cost. Based on our previous Eui mapping data, we conducted fine-structure mapping and positional cloning of the gene using an F2 population comprising more than 5000 individuals derived from a cross of the near-isogenic lines 307T (eui/eui) with the recurrent parent Zhenshan 97 (Eui/Eui). In total 45 CAPS (cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences) markers located within an interval of 14.5 cM were analyzed in the subpopulation of 1298 homozygous recessive plants. The resulting high-resolution map defined a 98-kb interval containing the Eui locus flanked by the markers M0387 and M01, and three markers were found to co-segregate with Eui. In order to facilitate the identification of the Eui gene, we used a transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC) vector to construct a set of contiguous TAC clones from the Nipponbare BACs (obtained from the Clemson University Genome Institute; CUGI) spanning this region. These clones can be used to streamline complementation testing. The markers tightly linked to the Eui locus can also be used in breeding male-sterile lines with the elongated uppermost internode.
cr200828a.pdf	Gibberellin homeostasis and plant height control by EUI and a role for gibberellin in root gravity responses in rice	2008	Cell Res	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 300 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, China.	The rice Eui (ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE) gene encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that deactivates bioactive gibberellins (GAs). In this study, we investigated controlled expression of the Eui gene and its role in plant development. We found that Eui was differentially induced by exogenous GAs and that the Eui promoter had the highest activity in the vascular bundles. The eui mutant was defective in starch granule development in root caps and Eui overexpression enhanced starch granule generation and gravity responses, revealing a role for GA in root starch granule development and gravity responses. Experiments using embryoless half-seeds revealed that RAmy1A and GAmyb were highly upregulated in eui aleurone cells in the absence of exogenous GA. In addition, the GA biosynthesis genes GA3ox1 and GA20ox2 were downregulated and GA2ox1 was upregulated in eui seedlings. These results indicate that EUI is involved in GA homeostasis, not only in the internodes at the heading stage, but also in the seedling stage, roots and seeds. Disturbing GA homeostasis affected the expression of the GA signaling genes GID1 (GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF 1), GID2 and SLR1. Transgenic RNA interference of the Eui gene effectively increased plant height and improved heading performance. By contrast, the ectopic expression of Eui under the promoters of the rice GA biosynthesis genes GA3ox2 and GA20ox2 significantly reduced plant height. These results demonstrate that a slight increase in Eui expression could dramatically change rice morphology, indicating the practical application of the Eui gene in rice molecular breeding for a high yield potential.
Mol. Plant-2008-Yang-528-37.pdf	Altered disease development in the eui mutants and Eui overexpressors indicates that gibberellins negatively regulate rice basal disease resistance	2008	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.	Gibberellins (GAs) form a group of important plant tetracyclic diterpenoid hormones that are involved in many aspects of plant growth and development. Emerging evidence implicates that GAs also play roles in stress responses. However, the role of GAs in biotic stress is largely unknown. Here, we report that knockout or overexpression of the Elongated uppermost internode (Eui) gene encoding a GA deactivating enzyme compromises or increases, respectively, disease resistance to bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oyrzae) and rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae). Exogenous application of GA(3) and the inhibitor of GA synthesis (uniconazol) could increase disease susceptibility and resistance, respectively, to bacterial blight. Similarly, uniconazol restored disease resistance of the eui mutant and GA(3) decreased disease resistance of the Eui overexpressors to bacterial blight. Therefore, the change of resistance attributes to GA levels. In consistency with this, the GA metabolism genes OsGA20ox2 and OsGA2ox1 were down-regulated during pathogen challenge. We also found that PR1a induction was enhanced but the SA level was decreased in the Eui overexpressor, while the JA level was reduced in the eui mutant. Together, our current study indicates that GAs play a negative role in rice basal disease resistance, with EUI as a positive modulator through regulating the level of bioactive GAs.
pgen.1001098.pdf	The APETALA-2-Like Transcription Factor OsAP2-39 Controls Key Interactions between Abscisic Acid and Gibberellin in Rice	2010	PLoS Genet	Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada	The interaction between phytohormones is an important mechanism which controls growth and developmental processes in plants. Deciphering these interactions is a crucial step in helping to develop crops with enhanced yield and resistance to environmental stresses. Controlling the expression level of OsAP2-39 which includes an APETALA 2 (AP2) domain leads to phenotypic changes in rice. Overexpression of OsAP2-39 leads to a reduction in yield by decreasing the biomass and the number of seeds in the transgenic rice lines. Global transcriptome analysis of the OsAP2-39 overexpression transgenic rice revealed the upregulation of a key Abscisic Acid (ABA) biosynthetic gene OsNCED-I which codes for 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase and leads to an increase in the endogenous ABA level. In addition to OsNCED-1, the gene expression analysis revealed the upregulation of a gene that codes for the Elongation of Upper most Internode (EUI) protein, an enzyme that catalyzes 16a, 17-epoxidation of non-13-hydroxylated GAs, which has been shown to deactivate gibberellins (GAs) in rice. The exogenous application of GA restores the wild-type phenotype in the transgenic line and ABA application induces the expression of EUI and suppresses the expression of OsAP2-39 in the wild-type line. These observations clarify the antagonistic relationship between ABA and GA and illustrate a mechanism that leads to homeostasis of these hormones. In vivo and in vitro analysis showed that the expression of both OsNCED-1 and EUI are directly controlled by OsAP2-39. Together, these results reveal a novel mechanism for the control of the ABA/GA balance in rice which is regulated by OsAP2-39 that in turn regulates plant growth and seed production.
Plant Cell-2006-Zhu-442-56.pdf	ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that epoxidizes gibberellins in a novel deactivation reaction in rice	2006	Plant Cell	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China.	The recessive tall rice (Oryza sativa) mutant elongated uppermost internode (eui) is morphologically normal until its final internode elongates drastically at the heading stage. The stage-specific developmental effect of the eui mutation has been used in the breeding of hybrid rice to improve the performance of heading in male sterile cultivars. We found that the eui mutant accumulated exceptionally large amounts of biologically active gibberellins (GAs) in the uppermost internode. Map-based cloning revealed that the Eui gene encodes a previously uncharacterized cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, CYP714D1. Using heterologous expression in yeast, we found that EUI catalyzed 16alpha,17-epoxidation of non-13-hydroxylated GAs. Consistent with the tall and dwarfed phenotypes of the eui mutant and Eui-overexpressing transgenic plants, respectively, 16alpha,17-epoxidation reduced the biological activity of GA(4) in rice, demonstrating that EUI functions as a GA-deactivating enzyme. Expression of Eui appeared tightly regulated during plant development, in agreement with the stage-specific eui phenotypes. These results indicate the existence of an unrecognized pathway for GA deactivation by EUI during the growth of wild-type internodes. The identification of Eui as a GA catabolism gene provides additional evidence that the GA metabolism pathway is a useful target for increasing the agronomic value of crops.
Plant Cell Physiol-2006-Luo-181-91.pdf	EUI1, encoding a putative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, regulates internode elongation by modulating gibberellin responses in rice	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China.	Elongation of rice internodes is one of the most important agronomic traits, which determines the plant height and underlies the grain yield. It has been shown that the elongation of internodes is under genetic control, and various factors are implicated in the process. Here, we report a detailed characterization of an elongated uppermost internode1 (eui1) mutant, which has been used in hybrid rice breeding. In the eui1-2 mutant, the cell lengths in the uppermost internodes are significantly longer than that of wild type and thus give rise to the elongated uppermost internode. It was found that the level of active gibberellin was elevated in the mutant, whereas its growth in response to gibberellin is similar to that of the wild type, suggesting that the higher level accumulation of gibberellin in the eui1 mutant causes the abnormal elongation of the uppermost internode. Consistently, the expression levels of several genes which encode gibberellin biosynthesis enzymes were altered. We cloned the EUI1 gene, which encodes a putative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, by map-based cloning and found that EUI1 was weakly expressed in most tissues, but preferentially in young panicles. To confirm its function, transgenic experiments with different constructs of EUI1 were conducted. Overexpression of EUI1 gave rise to the gibberellin-deficient-like phenotypes, which could be partially reversed by supplementation with gibberellin. Furthermore, apart from the alteration of expression levels of the gibberellin biosynthesis genes, accumulation of SLR1 protein was found in the overexpressing transgenic plants, indicating that the expression level of EUI1 is implicated in both gibberellin-mediated SLR1 destruction and a feedback regulation in gibberellin biosynthesis. Therefore, we proposed that EUI1 plays a negative role in gibberellin-mediated regulation of cell elongation in the uppermost internode of rice.

Upper internode elongation in rice is an important agronomic trait. Well-known mutants with an elongated uppermost internode (eui) are important germplasms for developing unsheathed-panicle male-sterile lines in hybrid rice breeding. We finely mapped the eui1 gene and identified its candidate gene using in silico analysis based on previous research work and rice genomic sequence data. The rice eui1 gene was mapped to two overlapping BAC clones, OSJNBa0095J22 and OSJNBb0099O15, between the markers AC40 and AC46, that were 0.64 cM apart and spanned approximately 152 kb. A simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker AC41 that cosegregated with eui1 was located in an intron of a putative cytochrome P450-related gene. In silico analysis suggested that this encoded the cytochrome CYP714D1. Allelic sequencing confirmed that EUI1 corresponded to this P450 gene. A gamma ray-induced eui1 mutant carried a deletion in exon II of the EUI1 gene, and resulted in a frame-shift deletion that produced a truncated polypeptide. We conclude that the EUI1 gene controlling the upper internode elongation in rice is 9,804 bp long, and comprises two exons and one intron. The length of the cDNA is 1,931 bp containing a 1,734 bp ORF, a 110 bp 5'-UTR and a 87 bp 3'-UTR. The ORF encodes an unknown 577 amino acid functional protein, that appears to be a member of the cytochrome P450 family.
NA	The Intronic cis-Element SE1 Recruits trans-acting Repressor Complexes to Repress the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1 in Rice.	2018	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Protein Function and Regulation in Agricultural Organisms, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China; Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Biotechnology of Guangdong Provincial Higher Education Institutions, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China; College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.	Plant height has a major effect on grain yield in crops such as rice (Oryza sativa), and the hormone gibberellic acid (GA) regulates many developmental processes that feed into plant height. Rice ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE 1 (Eui1) encodes a GA-deactivating enzyme governing elongation of uppermost internode. The expression of Eui1 is finely tuned, thereby maintaining homeostasis of endogenous bioactive GA and producing plants of normal plant height. Here, we identified a dominant dwarf mutant, dEui1, caused by the deletion of an RY motif-containing cis silencing element (SE1) in the intron of Eui1. Detailed genetic and molecular analysis of SE1 revealed that this intronic cis-element recruits at least a trans-acting repressor complex, containing the B3 repressors OsVAL2 and OsGD1, the SAP18 co-repressor, and a histone deacetylase OsHDA710, to negatively regulate the expression of Eui1. This complex generates closed chromatin at Eui1, suppressing Eui1 expression and modulating GA homeostasis. Loss of SE1 or dysfunction of the complex components impairs histone deacetylation and H3K27me3 of Eui1 chromatin, thereby increasing Eui1 transcription, and decreasing bioactive GA; producing dwarfism in rice. Together, our results reveal a novel model in which the intronic cis element SE1 negatively regulates Eui1 expression via repressor complexes that modulates histone deacetylation and/or methylation.
NA	OsCYP714D1 improves plant growth and salt tolerance through regulating gibberellin and ion homeostasis in transgenic poplar.	2021	Plant Physiol Biochem	The Engineering Research Institute of Agriculture and Forestry, Ludong University, 186 Hongqizhong Road, Yantai, 264025, China.	Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP450s) play crucial roles in the regulation of plant growth and response to abiotic stress. However, their functions in woody trees are still largely unknown. Previously, we reported that expression of the rice cytochrome P450 monooxygenase gene OsCYP714D1 increased gibberellic acid (GA) accumulation and shoot growth in transgenic poplar. In this work, we demonstrate that expression of OsCYP714D1 improved the salt tolerance of transgenic poplar plants. Compared to wild type, plant height and K(+) content were significantly higher, whereas plant growth inhibition and Na(+) content were significantly lower, in transgenic plants grown under high salt stress condition. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that OsCYP714D1 expression up-regulated the expressions of GA biosynthesis, signaling and stress responsive genes in transgenic plants under both normal and high salt stress conditions. Further gene ontology (GO) analyses indicated that genes involved in plant hormone and ion metabolic activities were significantly enriched in transgenic plants. Our findings imply that OsCYP714D1 participated in the regulation of both shoot growth and salt resistance through regulating gibberellin and ion homeostasis in transgenic poplar, and it can be used as a candidate gene for the engineering of new tree varieties with improved biomass production and salt stress resistance.
NA	LG5, a Novel Allele of EUI1, Regulates Grain Size and Flag Leaf Angle in Rice.	2023	Plants (Basel)	College of Agronomy, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang 110866, China.	Grain size and flag leaf angle are two important traits that determining grain yield in rice. However, the mechanisms regulating these two traits remain largely unknown. In this study, a rice long grain 5 (lg5) mutant with a large flag leaf angle was identified, and map-based cloning revealed that a single base substitution followed by a 2 bp insertion in the LOC_Os05g40384 gene resulted in larger grains, a larger flag leaf angle, and higher plant height than the wild type. Sequence analysis revealed that lg5 is a novel allele of elongated uppermost internode-1 (EUI1), which encodes a cytochrome P450 protein. Functional complementation and overexpression tests showed that LG5 can rescue the bigger grain size and larger flag leaf angle in the Xiushui11 (XS) background. Knockdown of the LG5 transcription level by RNA interference resulted in elevated grain size and flag leaf angle in the Nipponbare (NIP) background. Morphological and cellular analyses suggested that LG5 regulated grain size and flag leaf angle by promoting cell expansion and cell proliferation. Our results provided new insight into the functions of EUI1 in rice, especially in regulating grain size and flag leaf angle, indicating a potential target for the improvement of rice breeding.
