EUI1	 The expression of Eui1 is finely tuned, thereby maintaining homeostasis of endogenous bioactive GA and producing plants of normal plant height |  Detailed genetic and molecular analysis of SE1 revealed that this intronic cis-element recruits at least a trans-acting repressor complex, containing the B3 repressors OsVAL2 and OsGD1, the SAP18 co-repressor, and a histone deacetylase OsHDA710, to negatively regulate the expression of Eui1 |  This complex generates closed chromatin at Eui1, suppressing Eui1 expression and modulating GA homeostasis |  Together, our results reveal a novel model in which the intronic cis element SE1 negatively regulates Eui1 expression via repressor complexes that modulates histone deacetylation and/or methylation
EUI1|OsCYP714D1	 Previously, we reported that expression of the rice cytochrome P450 monooxygenase gene OsCYP714D1 increased gibberellic acid (GA) accumulation and shoot growth in transgenic poplar |  In this work, we demonstrate that expression of OsCYP714D1 improved the salt tolerance of transgenic poplar plants |  Transcriptomic analyses revealed that OsCYP714D1 expression up-regulated the expressions of GA biosynthesis, signaling and stress responsive genes in transgenic plants under both normal and high salt stress conditions
