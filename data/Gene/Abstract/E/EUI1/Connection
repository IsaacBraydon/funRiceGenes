EUI1	SLR1|OsGAI	EUI1, encoding a putative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, regulates internode elongation by modulating gibberellin responses in rice	 Furthermore, apart from the alteration of expression levels of the gibberellin biosynthesis genes, accumulation of SLR1 protein was found in the overexpressing transgenic plants, indicating that the expression level of EUI1 is implicated in both gibberellin-mediated SLR1 destruction and a feedback regulation in gibberellin biosynthesis
EUI1	HOX12	Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.	 In this study, we identified a dominant panicle enclosure mutant regulator of eui1 (ree1-D), which is caused by the activation of a homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor HOX12
EUI1	HOX12	Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.	 Diminished HOX12 expression by RNA interference enhances the panicle exsertion, mimicking the eui1 phenotype
EUI1	HOX12	Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.	 The expression of EUI1 is elevated in the ree1-D mutant but lowered in HOX12 knockdown plants
EUI1	HOX12	Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.	 Interestingly, both HOX12 and EUI1 genes are predominantly expressed in panicles, where GA4 is highly accumulated
EUI1	HOX12	Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.	 Yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that HOX12 physically interacts with EUI1 promoter both in vitro and in vivo
EUI1	HOX12	Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.	 Furthermore, overexpression of HOX12 in eui1 mutant background remains the elongated uppermost internode phenotype
EUI1	HOX12	Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.	 These results reveal a novel regulatory module that HOX12 acts directly through EUI1 to regulate panicle exsertion in rice
