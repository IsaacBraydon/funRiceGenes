Heading date (flowering time), which greatly influences regional and seasonal adaptability in rice (Oryza sativa), is regulated by many genes in different photoperiod pathways. Here, we characterized a heading date gene, Early heading date 5 (Ehd5), using a modified bulked segregant analysis method. The ehd5 mutant showed late flowering under both short-day and long-day conditions, as well as reduced yield, compared to the wild type. Ehd5, which encodes a WD40 domain-containing protein, is induced by light and follows a circadian rhythm expression pattern. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Ehd5 acts upstream of the flowering genes Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1), and Heading date 3a (Hd3a). Functional analysis showed that Ehd5 directly interacts with Rice outermost cell-specific gene 4 (Roc4) and Grain number, plant height, and heading date 8 (Ghd8), which might affect the formation of Ghd7-Ghd8 complexes, resulting in increased expression of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1. In a nutshell, these results demonstrate that Ehd5 functions as a positive regulator of rice flowering and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying heading date.
