Ehd5	 Ehd5, which encodes a WD40 domain-containing protein, is induced by light and follows a circadian rhythm expression pattern |  Functional analysis showed that Ehd5 directly interacts with Rice outermost cell-specific gene 4 (Roc4) and Grain number, plant height, and heading date 8 (Ghd8), which might affect the formation of Ghd7-Ghd8 complexes, resulting in increased expression of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1
