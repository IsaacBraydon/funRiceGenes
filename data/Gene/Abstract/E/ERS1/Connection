Os-ERS1	ERS2	Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions	Five ethylene receptor genes, OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 were isolated and characterized from rice
Os-ERS1	ERS2	Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions	The genomic structure of OS-ERS1 and OS-ERS2 revealed that the introns within the coding sequences occurred in conserved positions to those of At-ETR1 and At-ERS1, whereas each of the OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 genes contained 1 intron within its coding region located at a position equivalent to those of At-ERS2, At-ETR2, and At-EIN4
