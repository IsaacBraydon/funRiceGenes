ERS1|OsERS1	iaa	Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions	Northern analysis revealed that the level of OS-ETR2 mRNA was markedly elevated either by the exogenous application of IAA or by ethylene treatment in young etiolated rice seedlings, whereas the OS-ERS1 transcript level was only slightly induced under the same experimental conditions
ERS1|OsERS1	iaa	Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions	Pretreatment with silver prevented IAA-induced and ethylene-induced accumulation of both mRNAs (OS-ERS1 and OS-ETR2)
ERS1|OsERS1	ethylene	Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions	Five ethylene receptor genes, OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 were isolated and characterized from rice
ERS1|OsERS1	ethylene	Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions	Deduced amino acid sequences of OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 showed that they exhibited significant homology to the prokaryotic two-component signal transducer and a wide range of ethylene receptors in a variety of plant species
ERS1|OsERS1	ethylene	Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions	Northern analysis revealed that the level of OS-ETR2 mRNA was markedly elevated either by the exogenous application of IAA or by ethylene treatment in young etiolated rice seedlings, whereas the OS-ERS1 transcript level was only slightly induced under the same experimental conditions
ERS1|OsERS1	ethylene	Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions	Pretreatment with silver prevented IAA-induced and ethylene-induced accumulation of both mRNAs (OS-ERS1 and OS-ETR2)
ERS1|OsERS1	ethylene	Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions	Analysis of the expression of the three ethylene receptor genes in different tissues of rice has unravelled their corresponding tissue-specificity in which OS-ERS1 was constitutively expressed in considerable amounts in all tissues studied, while OS-ERS2 and OS-ETR2 exhibited differential expression patterns in different tissues of rice
ERS1|OsERS1	seedling	Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions	Northern analysis revealed that the level of OS-ETR2 mRNA was markedly elevated either by the exogenous application of IAA or by ethylene treatment in young etiolated rice seedlings, whereas the OS-ERS1 transcript level was only slightly induced under the same experimental conditions
ERS1|OsERS1	submergence	The Differentiated Localized Rice Ethylene Receptors OsERS1 and OsETR2 and their Potential Role during Submergence.	 Our results and others support the notion that OsERS1 and OsETR2 could have different roles during rice plant submergence
ERS1|OsERS1	ethylene	The Differentiated Localized Rice Ethylene Receptors OsERS1 and OsETR2 and their Potential Role during Submergence.	The Differentiated Localized Rice Ethylene Receptors OsERS1 and OsETR2 and their Potential Role during Submergence.
ERS1|OsERS1	ethylene	The Differentiated Localized Rice Ethylene Receptors OsERS1 and OsETR2 and their Potential Role during Submergence.	 OsERS1 and OsETR2 are major ethylene receptors in rice that have been reported to have different regulatory functions
ERS1|OsERS1	plasma membrane	The Differentiated Localized Rice Ethylene Receptors OsERS1 and OsETR2 and their Potential Role during Submergence.	 Base on the results, we suggested that OsERS1 could be localized to plasma membranes, whereas OsETR2 could be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum
