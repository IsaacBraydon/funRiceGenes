Biochemical studies revealed that the novel rice plant-specific kinesin K16 has several unique enzymatic characteristics as compared to conventional kinesins. The ADP-free form of K16 is very stable, whereas the ADP-free form of conventional kinesins is labile. In the present study, the crystal structure of the novel rice kinesin motor domain (K16MD) complexed with Mg-ADP was determined at 2.4 A resolutions. The overall structure of K16MD is similar to that of conventional kinesin motor domains, as expected from the high amino acid sequence similarity (43.2%). However, several unique structures in K16 were observed. The position and length of the L5, L11, and L12 loops, which are key functional regions, were different from those observed in conventional kinesins. Moreover, the neck-linker region of the ADP-bound K16MD showed an ordered conformation at a position quite different from that previously observed in conventional kinesins. These structural differences may reflect the unique enzymatic characteristics of rice kinesin K16.

Kinesin is an ATP-driven motor protein that plays important physiological roles in intracellular transport, mitosis and meiosis, control of microtubule dynamics, and signal transduction. The kinesin family is classified into subfamilies. Kinesin species derived from vertebrates have been well characterized. In contrast, plant kinesins have yet to be adequately characterized. In this study, we expressed the motor domain of a novel rice plant-specific kinesin, K16, in Escherichia coli, and then determined its enzymatic characteristics and compared them with those of kinesin 1. Our findings demonstrated that the rice kinesin motor domain has different enzymatic properties from those of well known kinesin 1.
J Biochem-2006-Umeki-857-64.pdf	Conformational change of the loop L5 in rice kinesin motor domain induced by nucleotide binding	2006	J Biochem	Laboratories of Plant and Microbial Genome Control, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Niigata University, Niigata 950-2181.	Loop L5 of kinesin is located near the ATPase site, in common with kinesins of various animal species. The rice plant-specific kinesin K16 also has a corresponding loop that is slightly shorter than that of mouse brain kinesin. The present study was designed to monitor conformational changes in loop L5 during ATP hydrolysis. For this purpose, we introduced one reactive cysteine into the L5 of rice kinesin and modified it with fluorescent probes. The cysteine in L5 was labeled with a fluorescent probe 2-(4'(iodoacetamide) anilino-naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid sodium salt) [IAANS]. IAANS was incorporated into L5 at an almost equimolar ratio in the absence of nucleotides. In contrast, the incorporated amount was reduced to 0.62 and 0.32 mol IAANS/mol motor domain in the presence of ATP and ADP, respectively. Upon nucleotide addition, the fluorescent intensity of IAANS incorporated into L5 was significantly reduced to 63% and 51% for ATP and ADP, respectively. These results suggest that L5 of rice kinesin significantly changes its conformation during ATP hydrolysis.
