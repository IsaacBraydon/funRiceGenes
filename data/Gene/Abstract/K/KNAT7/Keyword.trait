KNAT7	growth	A Rice Homeobox Protein KNAT7 Integrates the Pathways Regulating Cell Expansion And Wall Stiffness.	 Biochemical and gene expression analyses revealed that rice KNAT7 interacts with a secondary wall key regulator, NAC31, and a cell growth master regulator, GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 4 (GRF4)
KNAT7	resistance	A Rice Homeobox Protein KNAT7 Integrates the Pathways Regulating Cell Expansion And Wall Stiffness.	 A loss-of-function mutation in KNAT7 enhanced wall mechanical strength and cell expansion, resulting in improved lodging resistance and grain size
KNAT7	grain	A Rice Homeobox Protein KNAT7 Integrates the Pathways Regulating Cell Expansion And Wall Stiffness.	 A loss-of-function mutation in KNAT7 enhanced wall mechanical strength and cell expansion, resulting in improved lodging resistance and grain size
KNAT7	grain size	A Rice Homeobox Protein KNAT7 Integrates the Pathways Regulating Cell Expansion And Wall Stiffness.	 A loss-of-function mutation in KNAT7 enhanced wall mechanical strength and cell expansion, resulting in improved lodging resistance and grain size
KNAT7	cell wall	A Rice Homeobox Protein KNAT7 Integrates the Pathways Regulating Cell Expansion And Wall Stiffness.	 Overexpression of KNAT7 gave rise to the opposite phenotypes, with plants having weaker cell walls and smaller grains
KNAT7	lodging	A Rice Homeobox Protein KNAT7 Integrates the Pathways Regulating Cell Expansion And Wall Stiffness.	 A loss-of-function mutation in KNAT7 enhanced wall mechanical strength and cell expansion, resulting in improved lodging resistance and grain size
KNAT7	lodging resistance	A Rice Homeobox Protein KNAT7 Integrates the Pathways Regulating Cell Expansion And Wall Stiffness.	 A loss-of-function mutation in KNAT7 enhanced wall mechanical strength and cell expansion, resulting in improved lodging resistance and grain size
