KNAT7	 Overexpression of KNAT7 gave rise to the opposite phenotypes, with plants having weaker cell walls and smaller grains |  Biochemical and gene expression analyses revealed that rice KNAT7 interacts with a secondary wall key regulator, NAC31, and a cell growth master regulator, GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 4 (GRF4)	 Overexpression of KNAT7 gave rise to the opposite phenotypes, with plants having weaker cell walls and smaller grains
