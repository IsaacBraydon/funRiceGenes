KS2|OsKS2|OsKSL2	floral	Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis	 The expression pattern of OsKS2 in wild-type cv Dongjin, showed that it is expressed in all organs, most prominently in the stem and floral organs
KS2|OsKS2|OsKSL2	 ga 	Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis	 The putative OsKS2 gene was a chromosome 4-located ent-kaurene synthase (KS), encoding the enzyme that catalyses an early step of the GA biosynthesis pathway
KS2|OsKS2|OsKSL2	dwarf	Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis	 Reverse transcription PCR analyses of 22 candidate genes related to the gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis pathway revealed that among 22 candidate genes tested, a dwarf mutant transcript was not expressed only in one OsKS2 gene| We propose that dwarfism in this mutant is caused by a point mutation in OsKS2, which plays a significant role in growth and development of higher plants| Further investigation on OsKS2 and other OsKS-like proteins is underway and may yield better understanding of the putative role of OsKS in severe dwarf mutants
KS2|OsKS2|OsKSL2	gibberellin	Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis	 Reverse transcription PCR analyses of 22 candidate genes related to the gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis pathway revealed that among 22 candidate genes tested, a dwarf mutant transcript was not expressed only in one OsKS2 gene
KS2|OsKS2|OsKSL2	stem	Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis	 The expression pattern of OsKS2 in wild-type cv Dongjin, showed that it is expressed in all organs, most prominently in the stem and floral organs
KS2|OsKS2|OsKSL2	growth	Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis	 We propose that dwarfism in this mutant is caused by a point mutation in OsKS2, which plays a significant role in growth and development of higher plants
