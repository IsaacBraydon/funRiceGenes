KOB1	sheath	Molecular cloning and expression characterization of a rice K+ channel beta subunit	 Leaf sheaths were found to contain higher levels of KOB1 protein than the blade portions of leaves
KOB1	growth	Ectopic expression of the K+ channel beta subunits from Puccinellia tenuiflora (KPutB1) and rice (KOB1) alters K+ homeostasis of yeast and Arabidopsis	 Yeast co-expressing PutAKT1 and the beta subunits (KPutB1 and KOB1) had better growth and higher K+-uptake ability than yeast expressing PutAKT1 alone| In contrast, yeast co-expressing the beta subunits (KPutB1 and KOB1) with OsAKT1 had slower growth and lower K+ uptake than yeast expressing OsAKT1 alone
KOB1	leaf	Molecular cloning and expression characterization of a rice K+ channel beta subunit	 Later-developing leaves on a rice plant were found to contain increasing levels of the protein with the flag leaf having the highest titer of KOB1| Leaf sheaths were found to contain higher levels of KOB1 protein than the blade portions of leaves
KOB1	root	Molecular cloning and expression characterization of a rice K+ channel beta subunit	 Expression studies indicated that KOB1 protein is more abundant in leaves than in either reproductive structures or roots
KOB1	homeostasis	Ectopic expression of the K+ channel beta subunits from Puccinellia tenuiflora (KPutB1) and rice (KOB1) alters K+ homeostasis of yeast and Arabidopsis	Ectopic expression of the K+ channel beta subunits from Puccinellia tenuiflora (KPutB1) and rice (KOB1) alters K+ homeostasis of yeast and Arabidopsis
KOB1	reproductive	Molecular cloning and expression characterization of a rice K+ channel beta subunit	 Expression studies indicated that KOB1 protein is more abundant in leaves than in either reproductive structures or roots
