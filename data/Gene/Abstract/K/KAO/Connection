KAO	NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsWOX3A is involved in negative feedback regulation of the gibberellic acid biosynthetic pathway in rice (Oryza sativa).	 Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that OsWOX3A directly interacts with the KAO promoter
KAO	NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	Regulatory role of the OsWOX3A transcription factor in rice root development.	 In a recent study, we demonstrated that OsWOX3A directly binds to the promoter of the KAO gene, which encodes ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase, an enzyme involved in GA biosynthesis, and represses KAO expression
