KRP5	embryo	The roles of a novel CDKB/KRP/FB3 cell cycle core complex in rice gametes and initiation of embryogenesis.	 Supporting their critical roles in controlling the rice zygotic cell cycle, mutations in KRP4, KRP5 and FB3 result in the compromised function of sperm cells and abnormal organization of female germ units, embryo and endosperm, thus significantly reducing seed-set rate
