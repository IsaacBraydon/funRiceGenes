NA	The Birth of a Black Rice Gene and Its Local Spread by Introgression.	2015	Plant Cell	Functional Plant Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The origin and spread of novel agronomic traits during crop domestication are complex events in plant evolution. Wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) has red grains due to the accumulation of proanthocyanidins, whereas most cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) varieties have white grains induced by a defective allele in the Rc basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) gene. Although the events surrounding the origin and spread of black rice traits remain unknown, varieties with black grains due to anthocyanin accumulation are distributed in various locations throughout Asia. Here, we show that the black grain trait originated from ectopic expression of the Kala4 bHLH gene due to rearrangement in the promoter region. Both the Rc and Kala4 genes activate upstream flavonol biosynthesis genes, such as chalcone synthase and dihydroflavonol-4-reductase, and downstream genes, such as leucoanthocyanidin reductase and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, to produce the respective specific pigments. Genome analysis of 21 black rice varieties as well as red- and white-grained landraces demonstrated that black rice arose in tropical japonica and its subsequent spread to the indica subspecies can be attributed to the causal alleles of Kala4. The relatively small size of genomic fragments of tropical japonica origin in some indica varieties indicates that refined introgression must have occurred by natural crossbreeding in the course of evolution of the black trait in rice.
NA	The C-S-A gene system regulates hull pigmentation and reveals evolution of anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in rice.	2018	J Exp Bot	Key Laboratory of Crop Heterosis and Utilization, Ministry of Education/ Beijing Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Department of Plant Genetics and Breeding, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.	Floral organs in rice (Oryza sativa) can be purple, brown or red in color due to the accumulation of flavonoids. But the molecular mechanism underlying specific organ pigmentation is not clear. Here, we propose a C-S-A gene model for rice hull pigmentation and characterize through genetic, molecular and metabolomic approaches. Further we conduct phylogenetic studies to reveal the evolution of rice color. In this gene system, C1 encodes a R2R3-MYB transcription factor and acts as a color-producing gene and S1 encodes a bHLH protein that functions in a tissue-specific manner. C1 interacts with S1 and activate expression of A1 which encoding a dihydro-flavonol reductase (DFR). As a consequence, the hull is purple whereby functional A1 participation leads to high accumulation of cyanidin 3-O-glucoside. Loss of function of A1 leads to brown hull color due to accumulation of flavonoids such as hesperetin 5-O-glucoside, rutin and delphinidin 3-O-rutinoside. It shows different evolutionary pathway of rice color in japonica and indica, supporting independent origin of cultivars in each subspecies. Our findings give complete perspectives on gene regulation network of rice color formation and supply theoretical basis for extended application of this beneficial trait.
