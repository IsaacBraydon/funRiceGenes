PGL2|OsBUL1	 Moreover, OsBUL1 expression was induced by brassinolide (BL) and osbul1 did not respond to BL treatment |  Expression of OsBC1 is also upregulated by BL and has a similar pattern to that of OsBUL1	 OsBUL1 knockout mutant (osbul1) and transgenic rice for double stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) of OsBUL1 produced erected leaves with smaller grains whereas OsBUL1 overexpressors and an activation tagging line of OsBUL1 exhibited increased laminar inclination and grain size |  Transgenic rice plants expressing OsBC1 under the control of OsBUL1 promoter showed increased grain size as well as leaf bending while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of OsBC1 displayed reduced plant height and grain size
