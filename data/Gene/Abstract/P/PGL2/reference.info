bs-62-133.pdf	An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG	2012	Breed Sci	Graduate School of Horticulture, Chiba University , 648 Matsudo, Matsudo, Chiba 271-8510, Japan.	Grain size is an important yield component in rice, however, genes controlling the trait remain poorly understood. Previously, we have shown that an antagonistic pair of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 1 (PGL1) and ANTAGONIST OF PGL1 (APG), is involved in controlling rice grain length. Here, we report the involvement of another atypical bHLH protein gene, POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 (PGL2), in the regulation of rice grain length. Over-expression of PGL2 in the lemma/palea increased grain length and weight in correlation with the level of transgene expression. Observation of the inner epidermal cells of lemma of PGL2-overexpressing lines revealed that the long grain size is caused by an increase in cell length. PGL2 interacts with a typical bHLH protein APG, a negative regulator of rice grain length and weight, in vitro and in vivo. It was reported that overexpression of BU1 (BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED 1), the closest homolog of PGL2, caused an increase in grain length. However, we detected no interaction between BU1 and APG. These findings suggest that PGL2 and PGL1 redundantly suppress the function of APG by forming heterodimers to positively regulate the rice grain length, while the pathway through which BU1, the closest homolog of PGL2, controls grain length is independent of APG.
NA	Rice leaf angle and grain size are affected by the OsBUL1 transcriptional activator complex	2016	Plant Physiology	Biotechnology Center in Southern Taiwan, Academia Sinica CITY: Tainan	Rice atypical HLH protein Oryza sativa BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED 1-LIKE 1 (OsBUL1) is preferentially expressed in the laminar joint where it controls cell elongation and positively affects leaf angles. OsBUL1 knockout mutant (osbul1) and transgenic rice for double stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) of OsBUL1 produced erected leaves with smaller grains whereas OsBUL1 overexpressors and an activation tagging line of OsBUL1 exhibited increased laminar inclination and grain size. Moreover, OsBUL1 expression was induced by brassinolide (BL) and osbul1 did not respond to BL treatment. To understand the molecular network of OsBUL1 function in rice, we isolated a novel OsBUL1-interacting protein, LO9-177, an uncharacterized protein containing a KxDL motif and functionally studied it with respect to the laminar inclination and grain size of rice. OsBUL1 COMPLEX1 (OsBC1) is a basic HLH (bHLH) transcriptional activator that interacts with OsBUL1 only in the presence of LO9-177 forming a possible trimeric complex for cell elongation in the laminar joint of rice. Expression of OsBC1 is also upregulated by BL and has a similar pattern to that of OsBUL1. Transgenic rice plants expressing OsBC1 under the control of OsBUL1 promoter showed increased grain size as well as leaf bending while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of OsBC1 displayed reduced plant height and grain size. Together, these results demonstrated that a novel protein complex consisting of OsBUL1, LO9-177 and OsBC1 is associated with the HLH-bHLH system providing new insight into the molecular functional network based on HLH-bHLH proteins for cell elongation.
NA	Genome-wide association studies reveal that members of bHLH subfamily 16 share a conserved function in regulating flag leaf angle in rice (Oryza sativa).	2018	PLoS Genet	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	As a major component of ideal plant architecture, leaf angle especially flag leaf angle (FLA) makes a large contribution to grain yield in rice. We utilized a worldwide germplasm collection to elucidate the genetic basis of FLA that would be helpful for molecular design breeding in rice. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified a total of 40 and 32 QTLs for FLA in Wuhan and Hainan, respectively. Eight QTLs were commonly detected in both conditions. Of these, 2 and 3 QTLs were identified in the indica and japonica subpopulations, respectively. In addition, the candidates of 5 FLA QTLs were verified by haplotype-level association analysis. These results indicate diverse genetic bases for FLA between the indica and japonica subpopulations. Three candidates, OsbHLH153, OsbHLH173 and OsbHLH174, quickly responded to BR and IAA involved in plant architecture except for OsbHLH173, whose expression level was too low to be detected; their overexpression in plants increased rice leaf angle. Together with previous studies, it was concluded that all 6 members in bHLH subfamily 16 had the conserved function in regulating FLA in rice. A comparison with our previous GWAS for tiller angle (TA) showed only one QTL had pleiotropic effects on FLA and TA, which explained low similarity of the genetic basis between FLA and TA. An ideal plant architecture is expected to be efficiently developed by combining favorable alleles for FLA from indica with favorable alleles for TA from japonica by inter-subspecies hybridization.
NA	OsbHLH98 Regulates Leaf Angle in Rice Through Transcriptional Repression of OsBUL1	2021	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Leaf angle is an important agronomic trait in cereals that helps determine plant yield by affecting planting density. However, the regulation mechanism of leaf angle remained elusive. Here, we show that OsbHLH98, a rice bHLH transcription factor, negatively regulates leaf angle. osbhlh98 mutant leaves formed a lager leaf angle, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing OsbHLH98 exhibited a slight reduction in leaf angle. We determined that the changes in leaf angle resulted from increased number and size of parenchyma cells on the adaxial side of the lamina joint in osbhlh98 mutants. Experiments using reporter constructs showed that OsbHLH98 is expressed on the adaxial side of lamina joints, consistent with its proposed function in regulating leaf angle. Furthermore, we established by chromatin immunoprecipitation and CUT&RUN that OsBUL1 is a direct downstream target of OsbHLH98. Transactivation assays and RT-qPCR analysis indicated that OsbHLH98 represses OsBUL1 transcription. Our results demonstrate that OsbHLH98 negatively regulates leaf angle by counteracting brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation via the repression of OsBUL1 transcription. The characterization of OsbHLH98 and its role in determining leaf angle will lay the foundation to develop the ideal plant architecture for adaptation to high planting density.
