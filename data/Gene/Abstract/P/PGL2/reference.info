bs-62-133.pdf	An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG	2012	Breed Sci	Graduate School of Horticulture, Chiba University , 648 Matsudo, Matsudo, Chiba 271-8510, Japan.	Grain size is an important yield component in rice, however, genes controlling the trait remain poorly understood. Previously, we have shown that an antagonistic pair of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 1 (PGL1) and ANTAGONIST OF PGL1 (APG), is involved in controlling rice grain length. Here, we report the involvement of another atypical bHLH protein gene, POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 (PGL2), in the regulation of rice grain length. Over-expression of PGL2 in the lemma/palea increased grain length and weight in correlation with the level of transgene expression. Observation of the inner epidermal cells of lemma of PGL2-overexpressing lines revealed that the long grain size is caused by an increase in cell length. PGL2 interacts with a typical bHLH protein APG, a negative regulator of rice grain length and weight, in vitro and in vivo. It was reported that overexpression of BU1 (BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED 1), the closest homolog of PGL2, caused an increase in grain length. However, we detected no interaction between BU1 and APG. These findings suggest that PGL2 and PGL1 redundantly suppress the function of APG by forming heterodimers to positively regulate the rice grain length, while the pathway through which BU1, the closest homolog of PGL2, controls grain length is independent of APG.
NA	Rice leaf angle and grain size are affected by the OsBUL1 transcriptional activator complex	2016	Plant Physiology	Biotechnology Center in Southern Taiwan, Academia Sinica CITY: Tainan	Rice atypical HLH protein Oryza sativa BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED 1-LIKE 1 (OsBUL1) is preferentially expressed in the laminar joint where it controls cell elongation and positively affects leaf angles. OsBUL1 knockout mutant (osbul1) and transgenic rice for double stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) of OsBUL1 produced erected leaves with smaller grains whereas OsBUL1 overexpressors and an activation tagging line of OsBUL1 exhibited increased laminar inclination and grain size. Moreover, OsBUL1 expression was induced by brassinolide (BL) and osbul1 did not respond to BL treatment. To understand the molecular network of OsBUL1 function in rice, we isolated a novel OsBUL1-interacting protein, LO9-177, an uncharacterized protein containing a KxDL motif and functionally studied it with respect to the laminar inclination and grain size of rice. OsBUL1 COMPLEX1 (OsBC1) is a basic HLH (bHLH) transcriptional activator that interacts with OsBUL1 only in the presence of LO9-177 forming a possible trimeric complex for cell elongation in the laminar joint of rice. Expression of OsBC1 is also upregulated by BL and has a similar pattern to that of OsBUL1. Transgenic rice plants expressing OsBC1 under the control of OsBUL1 promoter showed increased grain size as well as leaf bending while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of OsBC1 displayed reduced plant height and grain size. Together, these results demonstrated that a novel protein complex consisting of OsBUL1, LO9-177 and OsBC1 is associated with the HLH-bHLH system providing new insight into the molecular functional network based on HLH-bHLH proteins for cell elongation.
