APG|OsPIL16	PGL2|OsBUL1|OsbHLH173	An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG	PGL2 interacts with a typical bHLH protein APG, a negative regulator of rice grain length and weight, in vitro and in vivo
APG|OsPIL16	PGL2|OsBUL1|OsbHLH173	An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG	These findings suggest that PGL2 and PGL1 redundantly suppress the function of APG by forming heterodimers to positively regulate the rice grain length, while the pathway through which BU1, the closest homolog of PGL2, controls grain length is independent of APG

OsBDG1	PGL2|OsBUL1|OsbHLH173	Oryza sativa BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 LIKE1 Induces the Expression of a Gene Encoding a Small Leucine-Rich-Repeat Protein to Positively Regulate Lamina Inclination and Grain Size in Rice.	 Here, we identified a putative downstream gene of OsBUL1, OsBUL1 DOWNSTREAM GENE1 (OsBDG1) encoding a small protein with short leucine-rich-repeats by cDNA microarray analyses in the lamina joint and panicles of wild-type and osbul1 plants
OsBDG1	PGL2|OsBUL1|OsbHLH173	Oryza sativa BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 LIKE1 Induces the Expression of a Gene Encoding a Small Leucine-Rich-Repeat Protein to Positively Regulate Lamina Inclination and Grain Size in Rice.	 Moreover, transgenic rice expressing OsBDG1 under the control of OsBUL1 promoter also shows enlarged leaf bending and grain size phenotypes
BU1|OsbHLH174	PGL2|OsBUL1|OsbHLH173	Genome-wide association studies reveal that members of bHLH subfamily 16 share a conserved function in regulating flag leaf angle in rice (Oryza sativa).	 Three candidates, OsbHLH153, OsbHLH173 and OsbHLH174, quickly responded to BR and IAA involved in plant architecture except for OsbHLH173, whose expression level was too low to be detected; their overexpression in plants increased rice leaf angle
LO9-177	PGL2|OsBUL1|OsbHLH173	Rice Leaf Angle and Grain Size Are Affected by the OsBUL1 Transcriptional Activator Complex.	 To understand the molecular network of OsBUL1 function in rice, we isolated a novel OsBUL1-interacting protein, LO9-177, an uncharacterized protein containing a KxDL motif, and functionally studied it with respect to the lamina inclination and grain size of rice
LO9-177	PGL2|OsBUL1|OsbHLH173	Rice Leaf Angle and Grain Size Are Affected by the OsBUL1 Transcriptional Activator Complex.	 OsBUL1 COMPLEX1 (OsBC1) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional activator that interacts with OsBUL1 only in the presence of LO9-177 forming a possible trimeric complex for cell elongation in the lamina joint of rice
LO9-177	PGL2|OsBUL1|OsbHLH173	Rice Leaf Angle and Grain Size Are Affected by the OsBUL1 Transcriptional Activator Complex.	 Together, these results demonstrated that a novel protein complex consisting of OsBUL1, LO9-177, and OsBC1 is associated with the HLH-bHLH system, providing new insight into the molecular functional network based on HLH-bHLH proteins for cell elongation
OsbHLH98	PGL2|OsBUL1|OsbHLH173	OsbHLH98 regulates leaf angle in rice through transcriptional repression of OsBUL1.	OsbHLH98 regulates leaf angle in rice through transcriptional repression of OsBUL1.

OsbHLH98	PGL2|OsBUL1|OsbHLH173	OsbHLH98 regulates leaf angle in rice through transcriptional repression of OsBUL1.	 Transactivation assays and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis indicated that OsbHLH98 represses OsBUL1 transcription
OsbHLH98	PGL2|OsBUL1|OsbHLH173	OsbHLH98 regulates leaf angle in rice through transcriptional repression of OsBUL1.	 Our results demonstrate that OsbHLH98 negatively regulates leaf angle by counteracting brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation via the repression of OsBUL1 transcription
HOS59	PGL2|OsBUL1|OsbHLH173	KNOX II transcription factor HOS59 functions in regulating rice grain size.	 The qRT-PCR results showed that mutation of the HOS59 gene led to upregulation of some grain size-related genes such as OsSPL13, OsSPL18, and PGL2
