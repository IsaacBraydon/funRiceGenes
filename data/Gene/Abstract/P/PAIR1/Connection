DTM1	PAIR1	The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis	Transcripts of UDT1, which functions in tapetum development during early meiosis, were reduced in dtm1 anthers, as were those of PAIR1, which is involved in chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis
DTM1	PAIR1	The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis	Moreover, transcripts of DTM1 were reduced in msp1 mutant anthers, but not in udt1 and pair1 mutants
DTM1	PAIR1	The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis	These results, together with their mutant phenotypes, suggest that DTM1 plays important roles in the ER membrane during early tapetum development, functioning after MSP1 and before UDT1, and also in meiocyte development, after MEL1 and before PAIR1
MEL1	PAIR1	The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis	These results, together with their mutant phenotypes, suggest that DTM1 plays important roles in the ER membrane during early tapetum development, functioning after MSP1 and before UDT1, and also in meiocyte development, after MEL1 and before PAIR1
PAIR1	Udt1	The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis	Transcripts of UDT1, which functions in tapetum development during early meiosis, were reduced in dtm1 anthers, as were those of PAIR1, which is involved in chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis
PAIR1	Udt1	The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis	Moreover, transcripts of DTM1 were reduced in msp1 mutant anthers, but not in udt1 and pair1 mutants

OsMSP1|MSP1|OsTMS15	PAIR1	The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis	Moreover, transcripts of DTM1 were reduced in msp1 mutant anthers, but not in udt1 and pair1 mutants

CRC1	PAIR1	Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice	CRC1 interacts with homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis1 (PAIR1) in vitro, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB formation
PAIR1	ZYGO1	The F-box protein ZYGO1 mediates bouquet formation to promote homologous pairing, synapsis, and recombination in rice meiosis.	 The suppressed telomere clustering in homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis 1 (pair1) zygo1 and rice completion of meiotic recombination (Oscom1) zygo1 double mutants, together with the altered localization of OsSAD1 (a SUN protein associated with the nuclear envelope) in zygo1 showed that ZYGO1 has a significant function in bouquet formation
OsRAD51D	PAIR1	OsRAD51D promotes homologous pairing and recombination by preventing non-homologous interactions in rice meiosis.	 Observations from the Osrad51d pair1 and Osrad51d ku70 double mutants further demonstrate that non-homologous interactions require DSB formation, but do not depend on the KU70-mediated repair pathway
OsRAD51D	PAIR1	OsRAD51D promotes homologous pairing and recombination by preventing nonhomologous interactions in rice meiosis 	 Observations from the Osrad51d pair1 and Osrad51d ku70 double mutants further demonstrate that nonhomologous interactions require double-strand break formation but do not depend on the KU70-mediated repair pathway
