Tapetum development and meiosis play crucial roles in anther development. Here we identified a rice gene, DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1), which controls the early stages of that development. This gene encodes for an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein that is present only in cereals. Our T-DNA insertion mutations gave rise to abnormal tapetal formation. Cellular organelles, especially the ER, were underdeveloped, which led to hampered differentiation and degeneration of the tapetum. In addition, the development of pollen mother cells was arrested at the early stages of meiotic prophase I. RNA in-situ hybridization analyses showed that DTM1 transcripts were most abundant in tapetal cells at stages 6 and 7, and moderately in the pollen mother cells and meiocytes. Transcripts of UDT1, which functions in tapetum development during early meiosis, were reduced in dtm1 anthers, as were those of PAIR1, which is involved in chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis. However, expression of MSP1 and MEL1, which function in anther wall specification and germ cell division, respectively, was not altered in the dtm1 mutant. Moreover, transcripts of DTM1 were reduced in msp1 mutant anthers, but not in udt1 and pair1 mutants. These results, together with their mutant phenotypes, suggest that DTM1 plays important roles in the ER membrane during early tapetum development, functioning after MSP1 and before UDT1, and also in meiocyte development, after MEL1 and before PAIR1.
Plant Cell-2004-Nonomura-1008-20.pdf	The novel gene HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS1 of rice encodes a putative coiled-coil protein required for homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis	2004	Plant Cell	Experimental Farm/Plant Genetics Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Shizuoka 411-8540, Japan. knonomur@lab.nig.ac.jp	We have identified and characterized a novel gene, PAIR1 (HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS1), required for homologous chromosome pairing and cytokinesis in male and female meiocytes of rice (Oryza sativa). The pair1 mutation, tagged by the endogenous retrotransposon Tos17, exhibited meiosis-specific defects and resulted in complete sterility in male and female gametes. The PAIR1 gene encodes a 492-amino acid protein, which contains putative coiled-coil motifs in the middle, two basic regions at both termini, and a potential nuclear localization signal at the C terminus. Expression of the PAIR1 gene was detected in the early stages of flower development, in which the majority of the sporocytes had not entered meiosis. During prophase I of the pair1 meiocyte, all the chromosomes became entangled to form a compact sphere adhered to a nucleolus, and homologous pairing failed. At anaphase I and telophase I, chromosome nondisjunction and degenerated spindle formation resulted in multiple uneven spore production. However, chromosomal fragmentation frequent in plant meiotic mutants was never observed in all of the pair1 meiocytes. These observations clarify that the PAIR1 protein plays an essential role in establishment of homologous chromosome pairing in rice meiosis.
Plant Cell-2013-Miao-tpc.113.113175.pdf	Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice	2013	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	In meiosis, homologous recombination entails programmed DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation and synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly coupled with the DSB repair. Although SCs display extensive structural conservation among species, their components identified are poorly conserved at the sequence level. Here, we identified a novel SC component, designated central region component1 (CRC1), in rice (Oryza sativa). CRC1 colocalizes with ZEP1, the rice SC transverse filament protein, to the central region of SCs in a mutually dependent fashion. Consistent with this colocalization, CRC1 interacts with ZEP1 in yeast two-hybrid assays. CRC1 is orthologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae pachytene checkpoint2 (Pch2) and Mus musculus THYROID receptor-interacting protein13 (TRIP13) and may be a conserved SC component. Additionally, we provide evidence that CRC1 is essential for meiotic DSB formation. CRC1 interacts with homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis1 (PAIR1) in vitro, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB formation. PAIR2, the rice ortholog of budding yeast homolog pairing1, is required for homologous chromosome pairing. We found that CRC1 is also essential for the recruitment of PAIR2 onto meiotic chromosomes. The roles of CRC1 identified here have not been reported for Pch2 or TRIP13.
