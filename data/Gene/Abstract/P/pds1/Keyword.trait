pds1	development	The rice pds1 locus genetically interacts with partner to cause panicle exsertion defects and ectopic tillers in spikelets.	 Further isolation of pds1 and its interactor pds2, would provide new insight into the molecular regulation of grass inflorescence development and exsertion, and the evolution history of the extant rice
pds1	panicle	The rice pds1 locus genetically interacts with partner to cause panicle exsertion defects and ectopic tillers in spikelets.	The rice pds1 locus genetically interacts with partner to cause panicle exsertion defects and ectopic tillers in spikelets.
pds1	inflorescence	The rice pds1 locus genetically interacts with partner to cause panicle exsertion defects and ectopic tillers in spikelets.
