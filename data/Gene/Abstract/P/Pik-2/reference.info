DNA markers for rice blast resistance have been developed, but most are not suitable for routine use in a marker-assisted selection breeding program involving large numbers of progeny. After identifying candidate microsatellite markers from public database sources, we have mapped these markers near the blast resistance genes Pi-b, Pi-k, and Pi-ta(2) on rice chromosomes 2, 11, and 12, respectively, using segregation information from hundreds of progeny in several crosses. Two microsatellite markers, RM208 and RM224, were found to cosegregate with the Pi-b and Pi-k genes, respectively, while additional microsatellites were found to closely flank these two genes and the Pi-tal gene. The new markers are polymorphic in the narrow crosses characteristic of applied breeding programs and appear to be ideally suited for marker assisted selection for blast resistance in rice because of their tight linkage with resistance genes and ease of use through analysis of amplification products. A dominant marker indicating the presence of the Pi-b gene, Pibdom, has also been developed on the basis of the sequence of the cloned Pi-b gene. These markers should facilitate the introgression and pyramiding of these three blast resistance genes into new rice cultivars and elite lines.
j.1469-8137.2010.03462.x.pdf	The isolation and characterization of Pik, a rice blast resistance gene which emerged after rice domestication	2011	New Phytol	Laboratory of Plant Resistance and Genetics, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.	* The rice-rice blast pathosystem is of great interest, not only because of the damaging potential of rice blast to the rice crop, but also because both the pathogen and its host are experimentally amenable. The rice blast resistance gene Pik, which is one of the five classical alleles located at the Pik locus on the long arm of chromosome 11, confers high and stable resistance to many Chinese rice blast isolates. * The isolation and functional characterization of Pik were performed in the present study through genetic and genomic approaches. * A combination of Pik-1 and Pik-2 is required for the expression of Pik resistance. Both Pik-1 and Pik-2 encode coiled-coil nucleotide binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) proteins, and each shares a very high level of protein identity with corresponding proteins encoded by the Pik-m and Pik-p alleles. Pik could be distinguished from other Pik alleles, including Pik-m and Pik-p, by the allele-specific, single-nucleotide polymorphism T1-2944G. * The coupled genes probably did not evolve as a result of a duplication event, and are far from any NBS-LRR R gene characterized. Pik is a younger allele at the locus that probably emerged after rice domestication.

Kusabue. Like Pikm, Pik is composed of two adjacent NBS-LRR (nucleotide-binding site, leucine-rich repeat) genes: the first gene, Pik1-KA, and the second gene, Pik2-KA. Pik from Kanto51 and Pik from Kusabue were not identical; although the predicted protein sequences of the second genes were identical, the sequences differed by three amino acids within the NBS domain of the first genes. The Pik proteins from Kanto51 and Kusabue differed from Pikm in eight and seven amino acids, respectively. Most of these substituted amino acids were within the coiled-coil (CC) and NBS domains encoded by the first gene. Of these substitutions, all within the CC domain were conserved between the two Pik proteins, whereas all within the NBS domain differed between them. Comparison of the two Pik proteins and Pikm suggests the importance of the CC domain in determining the resistance specificities of Pik and Pikm. This feature contrasts with that of most allelic or homologous NBS-LRR genes characterized to date, in which the major specificity determinant is believed to lie in the highly diverged LRR domain. In addition, our study revealed high evolutionary flexibility in the genome at the Pik locus, which may be relevant to the generation of new R specificities at this locus.

F3 families were produced from individual F2 plants. Approximately 25 plants of each F3 family were inoculated with each of 8 different strains of Magnaporthe grisea. Each strain of the pathogen was known to have different genes for avirulence on Katy or Lemont. Each F3 family was recorded as having all plants resistant, segregating for resistance, or all plants being susceptible. The results suggest that the â€˜singleâ€<U+393C><U+3E39> gene for resistance in Katy is a tightly linked cluster of at least seven genes.
