Identification of the PCR markers tightly linked to genes that encode important agronomic traits is useful for marker-assisted selection (MAS). The rice Pi5(t) locus confers broad-spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of rice blast disease. It has been hypothesized that the Pi5(t) locus carries the same gene as that encoded by the Pi3(t) and Pii(t) loci. We developed three PCR-based dominant markers (JJ80-T3, JJ81-T3, and JJ113-T3) from three previously identified BIBAC clones-JJ80, JJ81, and JJ113-that are linked to the Pi5(t) locus. PCR analysis of 24 monogenic lines revealed that these markers are present only in lines that carry Pi5(t), Pi3(t), and Pii(t). PCR and DNA gel-blot analysis of candidate resistance lines using JJ80-T3, JJ81-T3, and JJ113-T3 indicated that Tetep is the likely donor of Pi5(t). Of the 184 rice varieties tested, 34 carried the JJ80-T3-, JJ81-T3-, and JJ113-T3-specific bands. Disease evaluation of those 34 varieties revealed that all conferred resistance to PO6-6. The genomic structure of three of these resistant varieties (i.e., IR72, Taebaeg, Jahyangdo) is most similar to that of Pi5(t). Our results demonstrate the usefulness of the JJ80-T3, JJ81-T3, and JJ113-T3 markers for MAS for M. grisea resistance.

Rice blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases of rice. To understand the molecular basis of Pi5-mediated resistance to M. oryzae, we cloned the resistance (R) gene at this locus using a map-based cloning strategy. Genetic and phenotypic analyses of 2014 F2 progeny from a mapping population derived from a cross between IR50, a susceptible rice cultivar, and the RIL260 line carrying Pi5 enabled us to narrow down the Pi5 locus to a 130-kb interval. Sequence analysis of this genomic region identified two candidate genes, Pi5-1 and Pi5-2, which encode proteins carrying three motifs characteristic of R genes: an N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) motif, a nucleotide-binding (NB) domain, and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif. In genetic transformation experiments of a susceptible rice cultivar, neither the Pi5-1 nor the Pi5-2 gene was found to confer resistance to M. oryzae. In contrast, transgenic rice plants expressing both of these genes, generated by crossing transgenic lines carrying each gene individually, conferred Pi5-mediated resistance to M. oryzae. Gene expression analysis revealed that Pi5-1 transcripts accumulate after pathogen challenge, whereas the Pi5-2 gene is constitutively expressed. These results indicate that the presence of these two genes is required for rice Pi5-mediated resistance to M. oryzae.
r0303.pdf	Genetic and physical mapping of Pi5(t), a locus associated with broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast	2003	Mol Genet Genomics	Department of Plant Pathology, University of California, One Shields Avenue, Davis 95616, USA.	To gain an understanding of the molecular basis for resistance to rice blast (Magnaporthe grisea), we have initiated a project to clone Pi5(t), a locus associated with broad-spectrum resistance to diverse blast isolates. AFLP-derived markers linked to Pi5(t)-mediated resistance were isolated using bulked segregant analysis of F(2) populations generated by crossing three recombinant inbred lines (RILs), RIL125, RIL249, and RIL260 with the susceptible line CO39. The most tightly linked AFLP marker, S04G03, was positioned on chromosome 9 of the fingerprint-based physical map of Nipponbare, a well-characterized rice genotype. Flanking BAC-based Nipponbare markers were generated for saturation mapping using four populations, the three initial RILs and an additional one derived from a cross between M202 and RIL260. A BIBAC (binary BAC) library was constructed from RIL260. Using these resources Pi5(t) was mapped to a 170-kb interval, and a contiguous set of BIBAC clones spanning this region was constructed. It had previously been suggested that Pi3(t) and Pi5(t) might be allelic, due to their identical resistance spectrum and tight linkage. We therefore compared genomic regions for lines containing Pi3(t) using the Pi5(t)-linked markers. DNA gel-blot analyses indicated that the region around Pi3(t) is identical to that of Pi5(t), suggesting that Pi3(t) and Pi5(t) are the same resistance gene.
