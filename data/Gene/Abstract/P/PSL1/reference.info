NA	PHOTO-SENSITIVE LEAF ROLLING 1 encodes a polygalacturonase that modifies cell wall structure and drought tolerance in rice	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, China.	The biosynthesis and modification of cell wall composition and structure are controlled by hundreds of enzymes and have a direct consequence on plant growth and development. However, the majority of these enzymes has not been functionally characterised. Rice mutants with leaf-rolling phenotypes were screened in a field. Phenotypic analysis under controlled conditions was performed for the selected mutant and the relevant gene was identified by map-based cloning. Cell wall composition was analysed by glycome profiling assay. We identified a photo-sensitive leaf rolling 1 (psl1) mutant with 'napping' (midday depression of photosynthesis) phenotype and reduced growth. The PSL1 gene encodes a cell wall-localised polygalacturonase (PG), a pectin-degrading enzyme. psl1 with a 260-bp deletion in its gene displayed leaf rolling in response to high light intensity and/or low humidity. Biochemical assays revealed PG activity of recombinant PSL1 protein. Significant modifications to cell wall composition in the psl1 mutant compared with the wild-type plants were identified. Such modifications enhanced drought tolerance of the mutant plants by reducing water loss under osmotic stress and drought conditions. Taken together, PSL1 functions as a PG that modifies cell wall biosynthesis, plant development and drought tolerance in rice.
NA	OsPG1 Encodes a Polygalacturonase that Determines Cell Wall Architecture and Affects Resistance to Bacterial Blight Pathogen in Rice	2021	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Zhejiang, 310006, Hangzhou, China.	Background: Plant cell walls are the main physical barrier encountered by pathogens colonizing plant tissues. Alteration of cell wall integrity (CWI) can activate specific defenses by impairing proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis, degradation and remodeling, or cell wall damage due to biotic or abiotic stress. Polygalacturonase (PG) depolymerize pectin by hydrolysis, thereby altering pectin composition and structures and activating cell wall defense. Although many studies of CWI have been reported, the mechanism of how PGs regulate cell wall immune response is not well understood.  Results: Necrosis appeared in leaf tips at the tillering stage, finally resulting in 3-5 cm of dark brown necrotic tissue. ltn-212 showed obvious cell death and accumulation of H2O2 in leaf tips. The defense responses were activated in ltn-212 to resist bacterial blight pathogen of rice. Map based cloning revealed that a single base substitution (G-A) in the first intron caused incorrect splicing of OsPG1, resulting in a necrotic phenotype. OsPG1 is constitutively expressed in all organs, and the wild-type phenotype was restored in complementation individuals and knockout of wild-type lines resulted in necrosis as in ltn-212. Transmission electron microscopy showed that thicknesses of cell walls were significantly reduced and cell size and shape were significantly diminished in ltn-212.  Conclusion: These results demonstrate that OsPG1 encodes a PG in response to the leaf tip necrosis phenotype of ltn-212. Loss-of-function mutation of ltn-212 destroyed CWI, resulting in spontaneous cell death and an auto-activated defense response including reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst and pathogenesis-related (PR) gene expression, as well as enhanced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). These findings promote our understanding of the CWI mediated defense response.
