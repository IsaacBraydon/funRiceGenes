Pi50	resistance	Functional divergence of duplicated genes results in a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus.	Functional divergence of duplicated genes results in a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus.
Pi50	resistance	Functional divergence of duplicated genes results in a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus.	We characterized a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus; Pi50 is derived from functional divergence of duplicated genes
Pi50	resistance	Functional divergence of duplicated genes results in a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus.	 The unique features of Pi50 should facilitate its use in rice breeding and improve our understanding of the evolution of resistance specificities
Pi50	resistance	Functional divergence of duplicated genes results in a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus.	 Complementation tests and resistance spectrum analyses revealed that Pi50_NBS4_1/2, not Pi50_NBS4_3/4, control the novel resistance specificity as observed in the Pi50 near isogenic line, NIL-e1
Pi50	resistance	Functional divergence of duplicated genes results in a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus.	 The identification of Pi50 with its novel resistance specificity will facilitate the dissection of mechanisms behind the divergence and evolution of different resistance specificities at the Pi2/9 locus
Pi50	blast	Functional divergence of duplicated genes results in a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus.	Functional divergence of duplicated genes results in a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus.
Pi50	blast	Functional divergence of duplicated genes results in a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus.	We characterized a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus; Pi50 is derived from functional divergence of duplicated genes
Pi50	breeding	Functional divergence of duplicated genes results in a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus.	 The unique features of Pi50 should facilitate its use in rice breeding and improve our understanding of the evolution of resistance specificities
Pi50	R protein	Functional divergence of duplicated genes results in a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus.	 Pi50 shares greater than 96Â % amino acid sequence identity with each of three other R proteins, i
Pi50	blast resistance	Functional divergence of duplicated genes results in a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus.	Functional divergence of duplicated genes results in a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus.
Pi50	blast resistance	Functional divergence of duplicated genes results in a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus.	We characterized a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus; Pi50 is derived from functional divergence of duplicated genes
