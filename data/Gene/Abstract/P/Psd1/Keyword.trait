Psd1	growth	Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	The Psd1 mutant showed impaired cell division and elongation, and a severe dwarf phenotype under long-day conditions, but nearly normal growth in short-day
Psd1	gibberellin	Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	The plant height of Psd1 mutant could not be rescued by gibberellin or brassinosteroid treatment
Psd1	cell division	Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	The Psd1 mutant showed impaired cell division and elongation, and a severe dwarf phenotype under long-day conditions, but nearly normal growth in short-day

Psd1	height	Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	The plant height of Psd1 mutant could not be rescued by gibberellin or brassinosteroid treatment
Psd1	brassinosteroid	Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	The plant height of Psd1 mutant could not be rescued by gibberellin or brassinosteroid treatment
