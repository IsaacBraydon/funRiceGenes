Psd1|Ptd1	growth	Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	The Psd1 mutant showed impaired cell division and elongation, and a severe dwarf phenotype under long-day conditions, but nearly normal growth in short-day
Psd1|Ptd1	gibberellin	Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	The plant height of Psd1 mutant could not be rescued by gibberellin or brassinosteroid treatment
Psd1|Ptd1	cell division	Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	The Psd1 mutant showed impaired cell division and elongation, and a severe dwarf phenotype under long-day conditions, but nearly normal growth in short-day
Psd1|Ptd1	dwarf	Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	The Psd1 mutant showed impaired cell division and elongation, and a severe dwarf phenotype under long-day conditions, but nearly normal growth in short-day
Psd1|Ptd1	height	Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	The plant height of Psd1 mutant could not be rescued by gibberellin or brassinosteroid treatment
Psd1|Ptd1	brassinosteroid	Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	The plant height of Psd1 mutant could not be rescued by gibberellin or brassinosteroid treatment
Psd1|Ptd1	growth	A Lipid Transfer Protein Variant with a Mutant Eight-cysteine Motif Causes Photoperiod-thermo-sensitive Dwarfism in Rice.	 Furthermore, we found that the growth inhibition in Ptd1 might result from the special protein conformation of Ptd1 due to loss of two disulfide bonds in the Eight-cysteine motif (8-CM) that is conserved among nsLTPs
