NA	Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	Theor Appl Genet	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Biotechnology of Guangdong Provincial Higher Education Institutions, College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Plant height is an important agronomic trait for crop architecture and yield. Most known factors determining plant height function in gibberellin or brassinosteroid biosynthesis or signal transduction. Here, we report a japonica rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) dominant dwarf mutant, Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 (Psd1). The Psd1 mutant showed impaired cell division and elongation, and a severe dwarf phenotype under long-day conditions, but nearly normal growth in short-day. The plant height of Psd1 mutant could not be rescued by gibberellin or brassinosteroid treatment. Genetic analysis with R1 and F2 populations determined that Psd1 phenotype was controlled by a single dominant locus. Linkage analysis with 101 tall F2 plants grown in a long-day season, which were derived from a cross between Psd1 and an indica cultivar, located Psd1 locus on chromosome 1. Further fine-mapping with 1017 tall F2 plants determined this locus on an 11.5-kb region. Sequencing analysis of this region detected a mutation site in a gene encoding a putative lipid transfer protein; the mutation produces a truncated C-terminus of the protein. This study establishes the genetic foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating plant cell division and elongation mediated by interaction between genetic and environmental factors.
NA	A Lipid Transfer Protein Variant with a Mutant Eight-cysteine Motif Causes Photoperiod-thermo-sensitive Dwarfism in Rice.	2019	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, Guangzhou, China.	Plant height is an important trait for plant architecture patterning and crop yield improvement. Although the pathways involving in gibberellins and brassinosteroid have been well studied, there are still many gaps in the picture of the networks controlling plant height. Here, we revealed that a dominant photoperiod- and thermo-sensitive dwarf mutant is caused by the active role of a mutated gene Ptd1, of which the wild-type gene encodes a non-specific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP). The Ptd1 plants showed severe dwarfism under long-day and low-temperature conditions, but grew nearly normal under short-day and high-temperature conditions; these phenotypic variations were associated with the Ptd1 mRNA level and its protein accumulation. Furthermore, we found that the growth inhibition in Ptd1 might result from the special protein conformation of Ptd1 due to loss of two disulfide bonds in the Eight-cysteine motif (8-CM) that is conserved among nsLTPs. Our findings give new insights into the understanding of the novel function of disulfide bonds in 8-CM, and provide a new strategy for regulation of cell development and plant height, by modifying the amino acid residues involved in protein conformation patterning.
