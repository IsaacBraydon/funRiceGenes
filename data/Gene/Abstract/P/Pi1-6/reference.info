Box 933, Manila, Philippines e-mail: maslab@satyam.net.in, PH	Three major genes (Pi1, Piz-5 and Pita) for blast resistance on chromosomes 11, 6 and 12, respectively, were fine-mapped and closely linked RFLP markers identified. New markers for Pi1 and Pita were found that were flanking the genes. The three genes were pyramided using RFLP markers. A PCR-based SAP (sequence amplified polymorphism) marker was used to identify Piz-5 in the segregating population. The plants carrying the two- and three-gene combinations that were tested for resistance to leaf blast in the Philippines and India indicated that combinations including Piz-5 have enhanced resistance than when it is present alone. The genes from the pyramided lines are at present being deployed into agronomically superior ricevarieties by marker-aided selection (MAS).

Twenty-four primer pairs corresponding to 19 microsatellite loci were selected from the Gramene database (www. gramene.org) considering their relative proximity to Pi-1(t) gene in the current rice genetic map. Progenitors and DNA bulks of resistant and susceptible families from F3 segregating populations of a cross between the near-isogenic lines C101LAC (resistant) and C101A51 (susceptible) were used to identify polymorphic microsatellite markers associated to this gene through bulked segregant analysis. Putative molecular markers linked to the blast resistance gene Pi-1(t) were then used on the whole progeny for linkage analysis. Additionally, the diagnostic potential of the microsatellite markers associated to the resistance gene was also evaluated on 17 rice varieties planted in Latin America by amplification of the specific resistant alleles for the gene in each genotype. Comparing with greenhouse phenotypic evaluations for blast resistance, the usefulness of the highly linked microsatellite markers to identify resistant rice genotypes was evaluated. As expected, the phenotypic segregation in the F3 generation agreed to the expected segregation ratio for a single gene model. Of the 24 microsatellite sequences tested, six resulted polymorphic and linked to the gene. Two markers (RM1233*I and RM224) mapped in the same position (0.0 cM) with the Pi-1(t) gene. Other three markers corresponding to the same genetic locus were located at 18.5 cM above the resistance gene, while another marker was positioned at 23.8 cM below the gene. Microsatellite analysis on elite rice varieties with different genetic background showed that all known sources of blast resistance included in this study carry the specific Pi-1(t) allele. Results are discussed considering the potential utility of the microsatellite markers found, for MAS in rice breeding programs aiming at developing rice varieties with durable blast resistance based on a combination of resistance genes.
10.1007-s11032-012-9751-6.pdf	Improving blast resistance of Jin 23B and its hybrid rice by marker-assisted gene pyramiding	2012	Molecular Breeding	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research and National Center of Crop Molecular Breeding, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China	Rice blast is one of the most serious diseases in rice (Oryza sativa L.) worldwide. Jin 23B is the maintainer line, a parent for a number of hybrid rice varieties used widely in China. However, Jin 23B is highly susceptible to rice blast. In this study, Pi1, Pi2, and D12 were introgressed to improve the blast resistance of Jin 23B and its derived hybrids, Jinyou 402 and Jinyou 207, by marker-assisted selection (MAS). The improved Jin 23B, which carried single, two, and three genes, were evaluated for their resistance to rice blast using natural inoculation methods in disease nursery of Xianfeng, Hubei, China. The results showed that, the greater the number of genes contained in the improved Jin 23B and hybrids, the higher the resistance to rice blast. Pi1, Pi2, and D12 showed a strong dosage effect on the resistance to blast in the hybrid background during the entire growth duration in the field condition, being very useful for breeding blast-resistant hybrids. The result of examining agronomic traits showed that the improved Jin 23B and its derived hybrid rice were taller than or similar to controls, when there was no disease stress.
10.1007-s11274-009-0074-7.pdf	Molecular mapping of rice blast resistance gene Pi-1(t) in the elite indica variety Samba mahsuri	2009	World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology	Department of Biotechnology, Directorate of Rice Research, Rajendranagar, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, 500030, India	Samba mahsuri (BPT 5204) is a cultivar of the medium slender grain indica variety of Oryza sativa grown across India for its high yield and quality. However, this cultivar is susceptible to several diseases and pests including rice blast. The analysis of near isogenic lines indicated the presence of a resistance gene, Pi-1(t) in the donor cultivar C101LAC which is highly resistant to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea (M. grisea). C101LAC was crossed with susceptible indica rice cultivar (BPT 5204) to generate the mapping population. A mendelian segregation ratio of 3:1 for resistant to susceptible F2 plants using bulk segregation analysis confirmed the presence of a major gene pi-1(t) by simple sequence repeats marker RM224 to the highly virulent blast isolate DRR 001.
292-1211-1-PB.pdf	Rice Blast Resistance Gene <i>Pi1</i> Identified by MRG4766 Marker in 173 Yunnan Rice Landraces	2012	Rice Genomics and Genetics	Agricultural Environment and Resources Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, 650205, P.R. China	Rice Blast is one of the most serious rice diseases and caused great yield losses every year in the world. It had been proved that using resistant rice varieties would be the most effective way to control this disease; therefore, mining the resistant genes might be important foundational work in the breeding program. In the present study, we identified the existence of the Pi1 gene among the tested 173 landraces collected from Yunnan Province by using the SSR marker MRG4766. The results showed that the Pi1 gene was found in 64 landraces, accounting for 36.99% in total of 173 landraces. 33 of 102 indica landraces (32.35%) and 31 of 71 japonica landraces (43.66%) both contained Pi1 gene. The landraces harboring the Pi1 gene were distributed in 29 counties of 11 prefectures in Yunnan province. The distribution frequency of Pi1 gene was higher in paddy-upland rice region in South margin of Yunnan (41.03%) than that of in single and or double indica cropping region in south of Yunnan (32.69%). The distribution frequency of Pi1 gene was 35.29% in single indica and or japonica cropping region in center of Yunnan, 35.29% in japonica cropping region in northeast of Yunnan and 33.33% in japonica cropping region in northwest highland of Yunnan.
j.1365-313X.2008.03734.x.pdf	Involvement of OsSPX1 in phosphate homeostasis in rice	2009	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Arabidopsis thaliana SPX (SYG/PHO81/XPR1) domain genes have recently been shown to be involved in the phosphate (Pi) signaling pathway. We show here that a rice (Oryza sativa) SPX gene, OsSPX1, is specifically induced by Pi starvation in roots. Suppression of OsSPX1 by RNA interference resulted in severe signs of toxicity caused by the over-accumulation of Pi, similar to that found in OsPHR2 (phosphate starvation response transcription factor 2) overexpressors and pho2 (phosphate-responsive mutant 2). Quantitative RT-PCR showed that expression of OsSPX1 was strongly induced in OsPHR2 overexpression and pho2 mutant plants, indicating that OsSPX1 occurs downstream of OsPHR2 and PHO2. The expression of 10 genes associated with the phosphate-starvation signal pathways was analyzed. Expression of OsPT2 (phosphate transporter 2) and OsPT8 was significantly induced in OsSPX1-RNAi (OsSPX1-Ri) plants, suggesting that over-accumulation of Pi in OsSPX1-Ri plants results from an increase in Pi transport. In contrast, overexpression of OsSPX1 suppressed the induction of expression by Pi starvation of all 10 phosphate starvation-induced genes tested: IPS1 (induced by phosphate starvation 1), IPS2, OsPAP10 (purple acid phosphatase 10), OsSQD2 (sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2), miR399d and miR399j (microRNA 399), OsPT2, OsPT3, OsPT6 and OsPT8. This suggests that OsSPX1 acts via a negative feedback loop to optimize growth under phosphate-limited conditions.
WenNQ et al.MGG.pdf	Three types of defense-responsive genes are involved in resistance to bacterial blight and fungal blast diseases in rice	2003	Mol Genet Genomics	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Crop Molecular Breeding, Huazhong Agricultural University, 430070, Wuhan, China.	Bacterial blight and fungal blast diseases of rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Pyricularia grisea Sacc., respectively, are two of the most devastating diseases in rice worldwide. To study the defense responses to infection with each of these pathogens, expression profiling of 12 defense-responsive genes was performed using near-isogenic rice lines that are resistant or susceptible to bacterial blight and fungal blast, respectively, and rice cultivars that are resistant or susceptible to both pathogens. All 12 genes showed constitutive expression, but expression levels increased in response to infection. Based on their expression patterns in 12 host-pathogen combinations, these genes could be classified into three types, pathogen non-specific (6), pathogen specific but race non-specific (4) and race specific (2). Most of the 12 genes were only responsive during incompatible interactions. These results suggest that bacterial blight and fungal blast resistances share common pathway(s), but are also regulated by different defense pathways in rice. Activation of the corresponding R gene is the key step that initiates the action of these genes in defense responses. The chromosomal locations and pathogen specificities of seven of the 12 genes were consistent with those of previously identified quantitative trait loci for rice disease resistance, which indicates that some of the 12 genes studied may have a phenotypic impact on disease resistance in rice.

Two dominant genes conferring complete resistance to specific isolates of the rice blast fungus, Pyricularia grisea Sacc., were located on the molecular map of rice in this study. Pi-l(t) is a blast resistance gene derived from the cultivar 'LAC23'. Its map location was determined using a pair of nearly isogenic lines (NILs) and a B6F3 segregating population from which the isoline was derived. RFLP analysis showed that Pi-l(t) is located near the end of chromosome 11, linked to RZ536 at a distance of 14.0+/-4.5 centiMorgans (cM). A second gene, derived from the cultivar 'Apura', was mapped using a rice doubled-haploid (DH) population. This gene was located on chromosome 12, flanked by RG457 and RG869, at a distance of 13.5+-4.3 cM and 17.7+-4.5 cM, respectively. The newly mapped gene on chromosome 12 may be allelic or closely linked toPi-ta. (=Pi-4(t)), a gene derived from Tetep that was previously reported to be linked to RG869 at a distance of 15.4+/-4.7 cM. The usefulness of markers linked to blast resistance genes will be discussed in the context of breeding for durable blast resistance.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs00122-012-1894-7.pdf	The isolation of Pi1, an allele at the Pik locus which confers broad spectrum resistance to rice blast	2012	Theor Appl Genet	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropic Agrobioresources, Laboratory of Plant Resistance and Genetics, College of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.	We report the isolation of Pi1, a gene conferring broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae). Using loss- and gain-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that Pi1 is an allele at the Pik locus. Like other alleles at this locus, Pi1 consists of two genes. A functional nucleotide polymorphism (FNP) was identified that allows differentiation of Pi1 from other Pik alleles and other non-Pik genes. A extensive germplasm survey using this FNP reveals that Pi1 is a rare allele in germplasm collections and one that has conferred durable resistance to a broad spectrum of pathogen isolates.
