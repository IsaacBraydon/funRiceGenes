PPS1	pollen	Rice PPS1 encodes a DYW motif-containing pentatricopeptide repeat protein required for five consecutive RNA-editing sites of nad3 in mitochondria.	 Both pps1 RNAi and heterozygous plants are characterized by delayed development and partial pollen sterility at vegetative stages and reproductive stage
PPS1	sterility	Rice PPS1 encodes a DYW motif-containing pentatricopeptide repeat protein required for five consecutive RNA-editing sites of nad3 in mitochondria.	 Both pps1 RNAi and heterozygous plants are characterized by delayed development and partial pollen sterility at vegetative stages and reproductive stage
PPS1	development	Rice PPS1 encodes a DYW motif-containing pentatricopeptide repeat protein required for five consecutive RNA-editing sites of nad3 in mitochondria.	 Both pps1 RNAi and heterozygous plants are characterized by delayed development and partial pollen sterility at vegetative stages and reproductive stage
PPS1	vegetative	Rice PPS1 encodes a DYW motif-containing pentatricopeptide repeat protein required for five consecutive RNA-editing sites of nad3 in mitochondria.	 Both pps1 RNAi and heterozygous plants are characterized by delayed development and partial pollen sterility at vegetative stages and reproductive stage
PPS1	reproductive	Rice PPS1 encodes a DYW motif-containing pentatricopeptide repeat protein required for five consecutive RNA-editing sites of nad3 in mitochondria.	 Both pps1 RNAi and heterozygous plants are characterized by delayed development and partial pollen sterility at vegetative stages and reproductive stage
