The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein family is a large family characterized by tandem arrays of a degenerate 35-amino-acid motif whose members function as important regulators of organelle gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Despite the roles of PPRs in RNA editing in organelles, their editing activities and the underlying mechanism remain obscure. Here, we show that a novel DYW motif-containing PPR protein, PPS1, is associated with five conserved RNA-editing sites of nad3 located in close proximity to each other in mitochondria, all of which involve conversion from proline to leucine in rice. Both pps1 RNAi and heterozygous plants are characterized by delayed development and partial pollen sterility at vegetative stages and reproductive stage. RNA electrophoresis mobility shift assays (REMSAs) and reciprocal competition assays using different versions of nad3 probes confirm that PPS1 can bind to cis-elements near the five affected sites, which is distinct from the existing mode of PPR-RNA binding because of the continuity of the editing sites. Loss of editing at nad3 in pps1 reduces the activity of several complexes in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and affects mitochondrial morphology. Taken together, our results indicate that PPS1 is required for specific editing sites in nad3 in rice.
NA	Silencing of rice PPR gene PPS1 exhibited enhanced sensibility to abiotic stress and remarkable accumulation of ROS	2021	J Plant Physiol	Key Laboratory of Bio-Resource and Eco-Environment of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610065, Sichuan, China.

Recent researches presented pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins play crucial role in response to abiotic stress. However, the underlying mechanism of PPR genes in regulation of abiotic stress is still obscures. In our recent study, we found that the knockout of rice PPS1 causes pleiotropic growth disorders, including growth retardation, dwarf and sterile pollen, and finally leads to impaired C-U RNA editing at five consecutive sites on the mitochondrial nad3. In this study, we further investigate the roles of PPS1 in abiotic stress tolerance, we confirmed that pss1-RNAi line exhibited enhanced sensitivity to salinity and ABA stress at vegetative stage, specifically. While reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulate significantly only at reproductive stage, which further activated the expression of several ROS-scavenging system related genes. These results implied that PPS1 functioned on ROS signaling network to contribute for the flexibility to abiotic stresses. Our research emphasizes the stress adaptability mediated by the PPR protein, and also provides new insight into the understanding of the interaction between cytoplasm and nucleus and signal transduction involved in RNA editing.
