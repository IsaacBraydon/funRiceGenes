PPS1	 Both pps1 RNAi and heterozygous plants are characterized by delayed development and partial pollen sterility at vegetative stages and reproductive stage
PPS1	 In this study, we further investigate the roles of PPS1 in abiotic stress tolerance, we confirmed that pss1-RNAi line exhibited enhanced sensitivity to salinity and ABA stress at vegetative stage, specifically
