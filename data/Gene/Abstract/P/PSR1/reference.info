By conventional crosses of low-regeneration rice strain Koshihikari with high-regeneration rice strain Kasalath, we identified some quantitative trait loci, which control the regeneration ability in rice. Using a map-based cloning strategy, we isolated a main quantitative trait loci gene encoding ferredoxin-nitrite reductase (NiR) that determines regeneration ability in rice. Molecular analyses revealed that the poor regeneration ability of Koshihikari is caused by lower expression than in Kasalath and the specific activity of NiR. Using the NiR gene as a selection marker, we succeeded in selectively transforming a foreign gene into rice without exogenous marker genes. Our results demonstrate that nitrate assimilation is an important process in rice regeneration and also provide an additional selectable marker for rice transformation.
NA	Enhanced OsNLP4-OsNiR cascade confers nitrogen use efficiency by promoting tiller number in rice	2020	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Modern Crop Production, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Increased use of nitrogen fertilizers has deleterious impact on the environment. Increase in yield potential at low nitrogen supply is regarded as a cereal breeding goal for future agricultural sustainability. Although natural variations of nitrogen transporters have been investigated, key genes associated with assimilation remain largely unexplored for nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) enhancement. Here we identified a NIN-like protein NLP4 associated with NUE through a GWAS in rice. We found that OsNLP4 transactivated OsNiR encoding nitrite reductase that was critical in nitrogen assimilation in rice. We further constructed quadrupling NREs (Nitrate-responsive cis-element) in the promoter of OsNiR (p4xNRE:OsNiR) and enhanced nitrogen assimilation significantly. We demonstrated that OsNLP4-OsNiR increased tiller number and yield through enhancing nitrogen assimilation and NUE. Our discovery highlights the genetic modulation of OsNLP4-OsNiR signaling cascade as a strategy for high NUE and yield breeding in rice.
