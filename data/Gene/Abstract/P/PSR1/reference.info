By conventional crosses of low-regeneration rice strain Koshihikari with high-regeneration rice strain Kasalath, we identified some quantitative trait loci, which control the regeneration ability in rice. Using a map-based cloning strategy, we isolated a main quantitative trait loci gene encoding ferredoxin-nitrite reductase (NiR) that determines regeneration ability in rice. Molecular analyses revealed that the poor regeneration ability of Koshihikari is caused by lower expression than in Kasalath and the specific activity of NiR. Using the NiR gene as a selection marker, we succeeded in selectively transforming a foreign gene into rice without exogenous marker genes. Our results demonstrate that nitrate assimilation is an important process in rice regeneration and also provide an additional selectable marker for rice transformation.
