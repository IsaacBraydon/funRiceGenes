PSR1|OsNiR	nitrogen	Enhanced OsNLP4-OsNiR cascade confers nitrogen use efficiency by promoting tiller number in rice	 We found that OsNLP4 transactivated OsNiR encoding nitrite reductase that was critical in nitrogen assimilation in rice
PSR1|OsNiR	nitrogen	Enhanced OsNLP4-OsNiR cascade confers nitrogen use efficiency by promoting tiller number in rice	 We further constructed quadrupling NREs (Nitrate-responsive cis-element) in the promoter of OsNiR (p4xNRE:OsNiR) and enhanced nitrogen assimilation significantly
