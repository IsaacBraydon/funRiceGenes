Reaction center-type qE was detected by measuring non-photochemical quenching at 50 micromol photons m(-2) s(-1) white light intensity. We observed that in low light-grown rice plants, reaction center-type qE was higher than in high light-grown plants, and the amount of reaction center-type qE did not depend on zeaxanthin accumulation. This was confirmed in Arabidopsis npq1-2 mutant plants that lack zeaxanthin due to a mutation in the violaxanthin de-epoxidase enzyme. Although the electron transport rate measured at a light intensity of 50 micromol photons m(-2) s(-1) was the same in high light- and low light-grown wild type and mutant plants lacking PsbS protein, the generation of energy-dependent quenching was completely impaired only in mutant plants. Analyses of the pigment content, Lhcb proteins and D1 protein of PSII showed that the antenna size was larger in low light-grown plants, and this correlated with the amount of reaction center-type qE. Our results mark the first time that the reaction center-type qE has been shown to depend on photosystem II antenna size and, although it depends on the existence of PsbS protein, the extent of reaction center-type qE does not correlate with the transcript levels of PsbS protein. The presence of reaction center-type energy-dependent quenching, in addition to antenna-type quenching, in higher plants for dissipation of excess light energy demonstrates the complexity and flexibility of the photosynthetic apparatus of higher plants to respond to different environmental conditions.

A direct impact of chloroplastic protective energy dissipation (qE) on photosynthetic CO(2) assimilation has not been shown directly in plants in the absence of photoinhibition. To test this empirically we transformed rice to possess higher (overexpressors, OE) and lower (RNA interference, RNAi) levels of expression of the regulatory psbS gene and analysed CO(2) assimilation in transformants in a fluctuating measurement light regime. Western blots showed a several-fold difference in levels of PsbS protein between RNAi and OE plants with the wild type (WT) being intermediate. At a growth light intensity of 600 mumol m(-2) sec(-1) , the carboxylation capacity, electron transport capacity and dark adapted F(v)/F(m) (ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence) were inhibited in RNAi plants compared with WT and OE. The PsbS content had a significant impact on qE (measured here as non-photochemical quenching, NPQ) but the strongest effect was observed transiently, immediately following the application of light. This capacity for qE was several-fold lower in RNAi plants and significantly higher in OE plants during the first 10 min of illumination. At steady state the differences were reduced: notably at 500 mumol m(-2) sec(-1) all plants had the same NPQ values regardless of PsbS content. During a series of light-dark transitions the induction of CO(2) assimilation was inhibited in OE plants, reducing integrated photosynthesis during the light period. We conclude that the accumulation of PsbS and the resultant qE exerts control over photosynthesis in fluctuating light, showing that optimization of photoprotective processes is necessary for maximum photosynthetic productivity even in the absence of photoinhibitory stress.
Plant Cell Physiol-2011-Ishida-1822-31.pdf	Allocation of absorbed light energy in PSII to thermal dissipations in the presence or absence of PsbS subunits of rice	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Division of Integrated Life Sciences, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan.	The thermal dissipation (TD) of absorbed light energy in PSII is considered to be an important photoprotection process in photosynthesis. A major portion of TD has been visualized through the analysis of Chl fluorescence as energy quenching (qE) which depends on the presence of the PsbS subunit. Although the physiological importance of qE-associated TD (qE-TD) has been widely accepted, it is not yet clear how much of the absorbed light energy is dissipated through a qE-associated mechanism. In this study, the fates of absorbed light energy in PSII with regard to different TD processes, including qE-TD, were quantitatively estimated by the typical energy allocation models using transgenic rice in which psbS genes were silenced by RNA interference (RNAi). The silencing of psbS genes resulted in a decrease in the light-inducible portion of TD, whereas the allocation of energy to electron transport did not change over a wide range of light intensities. The allocation models indicate that the energy allocated to qE-TD under saturating light is 30-50%. We also showed that a large portion of absorbed light energy is thermally dissipated in manners that are independent of qE. The nature of such dissipations is discussed.
NA	Acceleration of cyclic electron flow in rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) deficient in the PsbS protein of Photosystem II.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	Department of Integrated Biological Science, Department of Molecular Biology, Pusan National University, Jangjeon-dong, Geumjeong-gu, Busan 609-735, Republic of Korea; Department of Biology, North-Eastern Federal University, 58 Belinsky Str., Yakutsk 677-027 Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Russian Federation; Institute of Botany, Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences, Patamdar Shosse 40, Baku, AZ 1073, Azerbaijan. Electronic address: iszulfugarov@pusan.ac.kr.	When compared with Photosystem I (PSI) in wild-type (WT) rice plants, PSI in PsbS-knockout (KO) plants that lack the energy-dependent component of nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) was less sensitive to photoinhibition. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between NPQ and cyclic electron flow (CEF) around PSI as a photoprotective mechanism. Activities of two CEF routes (PGR5-dependent or NDH-dependent) were compared between those genotypes by using both dark-adapted plants and pre-illuminated plants, i.e., those in which the Calvin-Benson cycle is de-activated and activated, respectively. In dark-adapted leaves activity of the PGR5-dependent route was determined as the rate of P700 photooxidation. Activity was higher in the mutants than in the WT. However, no difference was noted when plants of either genotype were pre-illuminated. When the electron transport pathway was switched to the cyclic mode by infiltrating leaf segments with 150<U+00A0>mM sorbitol, 40<U+00A0>¦ÌM DCMU, and 2<U+00A0>mM hydroxylamine, the rate of P700 oxidation was faster in the mutant. That difference disappeared when leaves were infiltrated with antimycin A to inhibit the PGR5-dependent route. Chlorophyll fluorescence (Fo) was also evaluated. To achieve an Fo level comparable to that of the WT, activation of the NDH-dependent route in the mutant required pre-illumination at a certain dose. Therefore, we propose that, as an alternate pathway for the photoprotection of photosystems in the absence of energy-dependent quenching, this PGR5-dependent route is more highly activated in the PsbS-KO mutants than in the WT. Moreover, that stronger activity is probably responsible for slower activation of the NDH-dependent route in the mutant.
NA	Does the upstream region possessing MULE-like sequence in rice upregulate PsbS1 gene expression?	2014	PLoS One	Institute for Environmental Science and Technology, Saitama University, Saitama city, Saitama, Japan; Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saitama University, Saitama City, Saitama, Japan.	The genomic nucleotide sequences of japonica rice (Sasanishiki and Nipponbare) contained about 2.7-kb unique region at the point of 0.4-kb upstream of the OsPsbS1 gene. In this study, we found that japonica rice with a few exceptions possessing such DNA sequences [denoted to OsMULE-japonica specific sequence (JSS)] is distinct by the presence of Mutator-like-element (MULE). Such sequence was absent in most of indica cultivars and Oryza glaberrima. In OsMULE-JSS1, we noted the presence of possible target site duplication (TSD; CTTTTCCAG) and about 80-bp terminal inverted repeat (TIR) near TSD. We also found the enhancement ofOsPsbS1 mRNA accumulation by intensified light, which was not associated with the DNA methylation status in OsMULE/JSS. In addition, O. rufipogon, possible ancestor of modern rice cultivars was found to compose PsbS gene of either japonica (minor) or indica (major) type. Transient gene expression assay showed that the japonica type promoter elevated a reporter gene activity than indica type.
