PFKB1	chloroplast	A phosphofructokinase B-type carbohydrate kinase family protein, PFKB1, is essential for chloroplast development at early seedling stage in rice.	 Here, we report the involvement of a PCK protein PFKB1 in chloroplast development by identification of a new rice mutant, revertible early yellowing Kitaake 2 [rey(k2)]
PFKB1	chloroplast	A phosphofructokinase B-type carbohydrate kinase family protein, PFKB1, is essential for chloroplast development at early seedling stage in rice.	 The Pfkb1 gene is ubiquitously expressed, and its protein is mainly targeted to the chloroplast and, in some cells, to the nucleus
PFKB1	chloroplast	A phosphofructokinase B-type carbohydrate kinase family protein, PFKB1, is essential for chloroplast development at early seedling stage in rice.	 Taken together, our study suggests that PFKB1 functions as a novel regulator indispensable for early chloroplast development, at least partly by regulating chloroplast-associated genes

Here, we report the involvement of a PCK protein PFKB1 in chloroplast development by identification of a new rice mutant, revertible early yellowing Kitaake 2 [rey(k2)]
PFKB1	nucleus	A phosphofructokinase B-type carbohydrate kinase family protein, PFKB1, is essential for chloroplast development at early seedling stage in rice.	 The Pfkb1 gene is ubiquitously expressed, and its protein is mainly targeted to the chloroplast and, in some cells, to the nucleus
