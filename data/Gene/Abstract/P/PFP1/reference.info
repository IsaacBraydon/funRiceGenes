NA	Pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (PFP1) regulates starch biosynthesis and seed development viaheterotetramer formation in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2019	Plant Biotechnol J	College of Agriculture, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, 434025, China.	Pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (PFP1)reversibly converts fructose 6-phosphate andpyrophosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and orthophosphate during glycolysis, and hasdiverse functions in plants. However, mechanisms underlying the regulation of starch metabolism by PFP1 remain elusive. This study addressed the function of PFP1 in rice floury endosperm and defective grainfilling. Compared with the wild type, pfp1-3exhibited remarkablylow grain weight and starch content, significantlyincreased protein and lipid content,altered starch physicochemical properties andchanges in embryo development. Map-based cloning revealed that pfp1-3 is a novel allele and encodes the regulatory β-subunit of PFP1 (PFP1β). Measurement of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) showed that mutation of PFP1βmarkedly decreased its enzyme activity. PFP1β and three of four putative catalytic α-subunits of PFP1, PFP1α1,PFP1α2, and PFP1α4, interacted with each other to form a heterotetramer.Additionally, PFP1β, PFP1α1,and PFP1α2 also formed homodimers. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that mutation of PFP1βsignificantly altered expression of many essential enzymes in starch biosynthesis pathways. Concentrations of multiple lipid and glycolytic intermediates and trehalose metabolites were elevated in pfp1-3 endosperm, indicating that PFP1 modulates endosperm metabolism, potentially through reversible adjustments to metabolic fluxes. Taken together, these findings provide new insightsinto seed endosperm developmentand starch biosynthesis, andwill help in the breeding of rice cultivars with higher grainyield and quality.
