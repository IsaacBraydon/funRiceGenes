PFP1	starch	Pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (PFP1) regulates starch biosynthesis and seed development viaheterotetramer formation in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 However, mechanisms underlying the regulation of starch metabolism by PFP1 remain elusive
PFP1	map-based cloning	Pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (PFP1) regulates starch biosynthesis and seed development viaheterotetramer formation in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Map-based cloning revealed that pfp1-3 is a novel allele and encodes the regulatory β-subunit of PFP1 (PFP1β)
PFP1	endosperm	Pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (PFP1) regulates starch biosynthesis and seed development viaheterotetramer formation in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 This study addressed the function of PFP1 in rice floury endosperm and defective grainfilling
PFP1	endosperm	Pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (PFP1) regulates starch biosynthesis and seed development viaheterotetramer formation in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Concentrations of multiple lipid and glycolytic intermediates and trehalose metabolites were elevated in pfp1-3 endosperm, indicating that PFP1 modulates endosperm metabolism, potentially through reversible adjustments to metabolic fluxes
