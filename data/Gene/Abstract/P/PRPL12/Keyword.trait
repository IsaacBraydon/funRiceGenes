PRPL12	chloroplast	A residue substitution in the plastid ribosomal protein L12/AL1 produces defective plastid ribosome and causes early seedling lethality in rice 	 The PRPL12 protein contains putative EF-G and EF-Tu interaction sites to recruit and bind elongation factors for elongation of the peptide chain (Supplementary Fig. S10; Diaconu et al. 2005; Mandava et al. 2012), suggesting its essential role in chloroplast translation.
