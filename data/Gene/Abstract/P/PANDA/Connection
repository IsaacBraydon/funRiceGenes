CCP1|DFO1|EMF1|OsEMF1	PANDA	The Harbinger transposon-derived gene PANDA epigenetically coordinates panicle number and grain size in rice.	 Among the target genes, both OsMADS55 and OsEMF1 were negative regulators of panicle number but positive regulators of grain size, partly explaining the involvement of PANDA in balancing panicle number and grain size
OsMSI1	PANDA	The Harbinger transposon-derived gene PANDA epigenetically coordinates panicle number and grain size in rice	The PANDA-encoding protein can bind to the core polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components OsMSI1 and OsFIE2, and regulates the deposition of H3K27me3 in the target genes, thereby epigenetically repressing their expression.
OsFIE2	PANDA	The Harbinger transposon-derived gene PANDA epigenetically coordinates panicle number and grain size in rice	The PANDA-encoding protein can bind to the core polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components OsMSI1 and OsFIE2, and regulates the deposition of H3K27me3 in the target genes, thereby epigenetically repressing their expression.
