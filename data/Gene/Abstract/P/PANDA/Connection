CCP1|DFO1|EMF1|OsEMF1	PANDA	The Harbinger transposon-derived gene PANDA epigenetically coordinates panicle number and grain size in rice.	 Among the target genes, both OsMADS55 and OsEMF1 were negative regulators of panicle number but positive regulators of grain size, partly explaining the involvement of PANDA in balancing panicle number and grain size
