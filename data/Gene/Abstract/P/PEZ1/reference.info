Iron deficiency is one of the major agricultural problems, as 30% of the arable land of the world is too alkaline for optimal crop production, rendering plants short of available iron despite its abundance. To take up apoplasmic precipitated iron, plants secrete phenolics such as protocatechuic acid (PCA) and caffeic acid. The molecular pathways and genes of iron uptake strategies are already characterized, whereas the molecular mechanisms of phenolics synthesis and secretion have not been clarified, and no phenolics efflux transporters have been identified in plants yet. Here we describe the identification of a phenolics efflux transporter in rice. We identified a cadmium-accumulating rice mutant in which the amount of PCA and caffeic acid in the xylem sap was dramatically reduced and hence named it phenolics efflux zero 1 (pez1). PEZ1 localized to the plasma membrane and transported PCA when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. PEZ1 localized mainly in the stele of roots. In the roots of pez1, precipitated apoplasmic iron increased. The growth of PEZ1 overexpression lines was severely restricted, and these lines accumulated more iron as a result of the high solubilization of precipitated apoplasmic iron in the stele. We show that PEZ1 is responsible for an increase of PCA concentration in the xylem sap and is essential for the utilization of apoplasmic precipitated iron in the stele.

Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for plants whose deficiency presents a major worldwide agricultural problem. Moreover, Fe is not easily available in neutral to alkaline soils, rendering plants deficient in Fe despite its abundance. Plants secrete phenolics, such as protocatechuic acid (PCA) and caffeic acid (CA), to take up and utilize apoplasmic precipitated Fe, but despite the rapid progress in understanding cellular and subcellular Fe transport, the molecular mechanisms of phenolics synthesis and secretion are not clear. Recently, we isolated and characterized a phenolics efflux transporter in rice by characterizing a mutant in which the amount of PCA and CA in the xylem sap was dramatically reduced, which we hence named phenolics efflux zero 1 (pez1). PEZ1 is a plasma membrane protein that transports PCA when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and characterization of PEZ1 knockdown and overexpressing plants revealed that it plays an essential role in solubilizing precipitated apoplasmic Fe. The identification of PEZ1 will increase our understanding of apoplasmic Fe solubilization as well as promote research on phenolics efflux mechanisms in different organisms.
