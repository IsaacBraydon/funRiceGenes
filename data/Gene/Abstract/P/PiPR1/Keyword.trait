PiPR1	blast disease	Genome-wide association study identifies an NLR gene that confers partial resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.	The identification of this new non-strain specific partial R gene, tentatively named rice blast Partial Resistance gene 1 (PiPR1), provides genetic material that will be useful for understanding the partial resistance mechanism and for breeding durably resistant cultivars against blast disease of rice.
