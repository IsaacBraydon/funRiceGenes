PDD|TCD8	chloroplast	A Natural Variation in PLEIOTROPIC DEVELOPMENTAL DEFECTS Uncovers a Crucial Role for Chloroplast tRNA Modification in Translation and Plant Development.	 LC-MS/MS revealed that PDD is associated with the 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine modification of chloroplast tRNA
PDD|TCD8	map-based cloning	A Natural Variation in PLEIOTROPIC DEVELOPMENTAL DEFECTS Uncovers a Crucial Role for Chloroplast tRNA Modification in Translation and Plant Development.	 Map-based cloning revealed that PDD encodes an evolutionarily conserved tRNA-modifying GTPase belonging to the TrmE family
PDD|TCD8	leaf	Rice TCD8 Encoding a Multi-Domain GTPase Is Crucial for Chloroplast Development of Early Leaf Stage at Low Temperatures.	Rice TCD8 Encoding a Multi-Domain GTPase Is Crucial for Chloroplast Development of Early Leaf Stage at Low Temperatures.
PDD|TCD8	chloroplast	Rice TCD8 Encoding a Multi-Domain GTPase Is Crucial for Chloroplast Development of Early Leaf Stage at Low Temperatures.	Rice TCD8 Encoding a Multi-Domain GTPase Is Crucial for Chloroplast Development of Early Leaf Stage at Low Temperatures.
PDD|TCD8	chloroplast	Rice TCD8 Encoding a Multi-Domain GTPase Is Crucial for Chloroplast Development of Early Leaf Stage at Low Temperatures.	 In addition, the disturbance of TCD8 suppressed the transcripts of certain chloroplast-related genes at low temperature, although the genes were recoverable to nearly normal levels at high temperature (32 째C), indicating that TCD8 governs chloroplast development at low temperature
