NA	A Natural Variation in PLEIOTROPIC DEVELOPMENTAL DEFECTS Uncovers a Crucial Role for Chloroplast tRNA Modification in Translation and Plant Development.	2020	Plant Cell	Fudan University CITY: Shanghai China [CN].	The modification of transfer RNA (tRNA) is important for accurate, efficient protein translation. A number of tRNA-modifying enzymes were found to influence various developmental processes in distinct organisms. However, few genetic or molecular studies have focused on genes encoding tRNA-modifying enzymes in green plant organelles. Here, we discovered that PDDOL, a natural variation allele of PLEIOTROPIC DEVELOPMENTAL DEFECTS (PDD), leads to pleiotropic developmental defects in a near-isogenic line generated by introgressing the wild rice Oryza longistaminata into the rice (Oryza sativa) cultivar 187R. Map-based cloning revealed that PDD encodes an evolutionarily conserved tRNA-modifying GTPase belonging to the TrmE family. The function of PDD was further confirmed by genetic complementation experiments and mutant analysis. PDD mRNA is primarily expressed in leaves, and PDD is localized to chloroplasts. Biochemical analyses indicated that PDD187R forms homodimers and has strong GTPase activity, whereas PDDOL fails to form homodimers and has weak GTPase activity. LC-MS/MS revealed that PDD is associated with the 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine modification of chloroplast tRNA. Furthermore, compared to 187R, NIL-PDDOL has severely reduced levels of proteins involved in photosynthesis and ribosome biogenesis but increased levels of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase subunits. Finally, we demonstrate that the defect due to PDDOL alters chloroplast gene expression, thereby affecting the communication between the chloroplast and nucleus.
NA	Rice TCD8 Encoding a Multi-Domain GTPase Is Crucial for Chloroplast Development of Early Leaf Stage at Low Temperatures.	2022	Biology (Basel)	College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China.	The multi-domain GTPase (MnmE) is conservative from bacteria to human and participates in tRNA modified synthesis. However, our understanding of how the MnmE is involved in plant chloroplast development is scarce, let alone in rice. A novel rice mutant, thermo-sensitive chlorophyll-deficient mutant 8 (tcd8) was identified in this study, which apparently presented an albino phenotype at 20 °C but a normal green over 24 °C, coincided with chloroplast development and chlorophyll content. Map-based cloning and complementary test revealed the TCD8 encoded a multi-domain GTPase localized in chloroplasts. In addition, the disturbance of TCD8 suppressed the transcripts of certain chloroplast-related genes at low temperature, although the genes were recoverable to nearly normal levels at high temperature (32 °C), indicating that TCD8 governs chloroplast development at low temperature. The multi-domain GTPase gene in rice is first reported in this study, which endorses the importance in exploring chloroplast development in rice.
