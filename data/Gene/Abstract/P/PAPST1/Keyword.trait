OsPAPST1	chloroplast	Identification of a dual-targeted protein belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family that is required for early leaf development in rice	 OsPAPST1 is highly expressed in young leaves and roots, while the expression is reduced in mature leaves, in line with the recovery of chloroplast development seen in the older leaves of papst1 mutant plants
OsPAPST1	chloroplast	Identification of a dual-targeted protein belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family that is required for early leaf development in rice	 OsPAPST1 is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane and chloroplast envelope
OsPAPST1	root	Identification of a dual-targeted protein belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family that is required for early leaf development in rice	 OsPAPST1 is highly expressed in young leaves and roots, while the expression is reduced in mature leaves, in line with the recovery of chloroplast development seen in the older leaves of papst1 mutant plants
OsPAPST1	mitochondria	Identification of a dual-targeted protein belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family that is required for early leaf development in rice	 OsPAPST1 is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane and chloroplast envelope
