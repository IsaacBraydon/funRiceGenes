NA	The methyl-CpG-binding domain family member PEM1 is essential for Ubisch body formation and pollen exine development in rice.	2022	Plant J	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China.	Pollen exine is composed of finely-organized nexine, bacula and tectum, and is crucial for pollen viability and function. Pollen exine development involves a complicated molecular network that coordinates the interaction between pollen and tapetal cells, as well as the biosynthesis, transport and assembly of sporopollenin precursors; however, our understanding of this network is very limited. Here, we report the roles of PEM1, a member of methyl-CpG-binding domain family, in rice pollen development. PEM1 expressed constitutively and, in anthers, its expression was detectable in tapetal cells and pollen. This predicted PEM1 protein of 240â€‰kDa had multiple epigenetic-related domains. pem1 mutants exhibited abnormal Ubisch bodies, delayed exine occurrence and, finally, defective exine, including invisible bacula, amorphous and thickened nexine and tectum layer structures, and also had the phenotype of increased anther cuticle. The mutation in PEM1 did not affect the timely degradation of tapetum. Lipidomics revealed much higher wax and cutin contents in mutant anthers than in wild-type. Accordingly, this mutation up-regulated the expression of a set of genes implicated in transcriptional repression, signaling and diverse metabolic pathways. These results indicate that PEM1 mediates Ubisch body formation and pollen exine development mainly by negatively modulating the expression of genes. Thus, the PEM1-mediated molecular network represents a route for insights into mechanisms underlying pollen development. PEM1 may be a master regulator of pollen exine development.
