PSD	leaf	Expression and characterization of rice putativePAUSEDgene	 Examining intronless tRNA-Tyr and intron-containing pre-tRNA-Ala expression levels in cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction with Northern blot analysis between wild-type and mutant leaf tissue suggested that rice PSD might be involved in tRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
PSD	fertility	Expression and characterization of rice putativePAUSEDgene	 In this study, we verified a rice transfer-DNAinsertional mutant psd line and analyzed its phenotypes; the mutant displayed severe morphological defects including retarded development and low fertility compared with wild-type rice
