Rice PLASTOCHRON 1 (PLA1) and PLA2 genes regulate leaf maturation and plastochron, and their loss-of-function mutants exhibit small organs and rapid leaf emergence. They encode a cytochrome P450 protein CYP78A11 and an RNA-binding protein, respectively. Their homologs in Arabidopsis and maize are also associated with plant development/organ size. Despite the importance of PLA genes in plant development, their molecular functions remain unknown. Here, we investigated how PLA1 and PLA2 genes are related to phytohormones. We found that gibberellin (GA) is the major phytohormone that promotes PLA1 and PLA2 expression. GA induced PLA1 and PLA2 expression, and conversely the GA-inhibitor uniconazole suppressed PLA1 and PLA2 expression. In pla1-4 and pla2-1 seedlings, expression levels of GA biosynthesis genes and the signal transduction gene were similar to those in wild-type seedlings. GA treatment slightly down-regulated the GA biosynthesis gene GA20ox2 and up-regulated the GA-catabolizing gene GA2ox4, whereas the GA biosynthesis inhibitor uniconazole up-regulated GA20ox2 and down-regulated GA2ox4 both in wild-type and pla mutants, suggesting that the GA feedback mechanism is not impaired in pla1 and pla2. To reveal how GA signal transduction affects the expression of PLA1 and PLA2, PLA expression in GA-signaling mutants was examined. In GA-insensitive mutant, gid1 and less-sensitive mutant, Slr1-d1, PLA1 and PLA2 expression was down-regulated. On the other hand, the expression levels of PLA1 and PLA2 were highly enhanced in a GA-constitutive-active mutant, slr1-1, causing ectopic overexpression. These results indicate that both PLA1 and PLA2 act downstream of the GA signal transduction pathway to regulate leaf development.
cr200936a.pdf	NECK LEAF 1, a GATA type transcription factor, modulates organogenesis by regulating the expression of multiple regulatory genes during reproductive development in rice	2009	Cell Res	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China.	In the monocot rice species Oryza sativa L., one of the most striking morphological processes during reproductive development is the concurrence of panicle development with the sequential elongation of upper internodes (UPIs). To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we cloned the rice gene NECK LEAF 1 (NL1), which when mutated results in delays in flowering time, smaller panicles with overgrown bracts and abnormal UPI elongation patterns. The NL1 gene encodes a GATA-type transcription factor with a single zinc finger domain, and its transcripts are detected predominantly in the bract primordia, which normally degenerate in the wild-type plants. Overexpression of NL1 in transgenic plants often gives rise to severe growth retardation, less vegetative phytomers and smaller leaves, suggesting that NL1 plays an important role in organ differentiation. A novel mutant allele of PLASTOCHRON1 (PLA1), a gene known to play a key role in regulating leaf initiation, was identified in this study. Genetic analysis demonstrated an interaction between nl1 and pla1, with NL1 acting upstream of PLA1. The expression level and spatial pattern of PLA1 were found to be altered in the nl1 mutant. Furthermore, the expression of two regulators of flowering, Hd3a and OsMADS1, was also affected in the nl1 mutant. On the basis of these findings, we propose that NL1 is an intrinsic factor that modulates and coordinates organogenesis through regulating the expression of PLA1 and other regulatory genes during reproductive development in rice.

Most aerial parts of the plant body are products of the continuous activity of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Leaves are the major component of the aerial plant body, and their temporal and spatial distribution mainly determines shoot architecture. Here we report the identification of the rice gene PLASTOCHRON3 (PLA3)/GOLIATH (GO) that regulates various developmental processes including the rate of leaf initiation (the plastochron). PLA3/GO encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase, which is thought to catabolize small acidic peptides and produce small signaling molecules. pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase. However, in contrast to pla1 and pla2, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology. Consistent with these pleiotropic phenotypes, PLA3 is expressed in the whole plant body, and is involved in plant hormone homeostasis. Double mutant analysis revealed that PLA1, PLA2 and PLA3 are regulated independently but function redundantly. Our results suggest that PLA3 modulates various signaling pathways associated with a number of developmental processes.
Plant Cell-1998-Itoh-1511-21.pdf	A recessive heterochronic mutation, plastochron1, shortens the plastochron and elongates the vegetative phase in rice	1998	Plant Cell	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	We describe two recessive alleles of a rice heterochronic gene, plastochron1-1 (pla1-1) and pla1-2, that reduce the length of the plastochron to approximately half that of the wild type. Because the onset of the reproductive phase in pla1 was not temporally affected, the number of leaves produced in the vegetative phase was nearly twice that produced in the wild type. Panicle development was severely disturbed in pla1 mutants. In pla1-1, many primordia of primary rachis branches were converted into vegetative shoots. These ectopic shoots repeated the initiation of panicle development and the conversion of primary rachis branches into shoots. In the weak allele pla1-2, however, only the basal one or two primordia developed as vegetative shoots, and the remaining primordia developed to produce a truncated panicle. These results indicate that both vegetative and reproductive programs are expressed simultaneously during the reproductive phase of pla1; however, the degree varied depending on the strength of the allele. Accordingly, pla1 is a heterochronic mutation that extends the vegetative period. The shoot apical meristem of pla1 was larger than that of the wild type, although the shape was not modified. An in situ hybridization experiment using the histone H4 gene as a probe revealed that cell divisions are accelerated in the pla1 meristem. The PLA1 gene is considered to regulate the duration of the vegetative phase by controlling the rate of leaf production in the meristem.
PNAS-2004-Miyoshi-875-80.pdf	PLASTOCHRON1, a timekeeper of leaf initiation in rice, encodes cytochrome P450	2004	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Plant Genetics Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, Yata 1111, Mishima, Shizuoka 411-8540, Japan.	During postembryonic development of higher plants, the shoot apical meristem produces lateral organs in a regular spacing (phyllotaxy) and a regular timing (plastochron). Molecular analysis of mutants associated with phyllotaxy and plastochron would greatly increase understanding of the developmental mechanism of plant architecture because phyllotaxy and plastochron are fundamental regulators of plant architecture. pla1 of rice is not only a plastochron mutant showing rapid leaf initiation without affecting phyllotaxy, but also a heterochronic mutant showing ectopic shoot formation in the reproductive phase. Thus, pla1 provides a tool for analyzing the molecular basis of temporal regulation in leaf development. In this work, we isolated the PLA1 gene by map-based cloning. The identified PLA1 gene encodes a cytochrome P450, CYP78A11, which potentially catalyzes substances controlling plant development. PLA1 is expressed in developing leaf primordia, bracts of the panicle, and elongating internodes, but not in the shoot apical meristem. The expression pattern and mutant phenotype suggest that the PLA1 gene acting in developing leaf primordia affects the timing of successive leaf initiation and the termination of vegetative growth.
tpc1800612.pdf	PLASTOCHRON2 Regulates Leaf Initiation and Maturation in Rice	2006	The Plant Cell Online	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan	In higher plants, leaves initiate in constant spatial and temporal patterns. Although the pattern of leaf initiation is a key element of plant shoot architecture, little is known about how the time interval between initiation events, termed plastochron, is regulated. Here, we present a detailed analysis of plastochron2 (pla2), a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant that exhibits shortened plastochron and precocious maturation of leaves during the vegetative phase and ectopic shoot formation during the reproductive phase. The corresponding PLA2 gene is revealed to be an orthologue of terminal ear1, a maize (Zea mays) gene that encodes a MEI2-like RNA binding protein. PLA2 is expressed predominantly in young leaf primordia. We show that PLA2 normally acts to retard the rate of leaf maturation but does so independently of PLA1, which encodes a member of the P450 family. Based on these analyses, we propose a model in which plastochron is determined by signals from immature leaves that act non-cell-autonomously in the shoot apical meristem to inhibit the initiation of new leaves.
NA	Jasmonate regulates juvenile-adult phase transition in rice.	2016	Development	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan ahibarak@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp.	Juvenile-adult phase transition is an important shift for the acquisition of adult vegetative character and subsequent reproductive competence. We identified a recessive precocious (pre) mutant exhibiting long leaf phenotype in rice. The long leaf phenotype is conspicuous in 2nd through 4th leaves that are juvenile and juvenile-adult transition leaves. We found that the morphological and physiological traits such as the midrib formation, shoot meristem size, photosynthetic rate and plastochron in juvenile and juvenile-adult transition stages of pre have precociously acquired adult characters. In agreement with these results, expression patterns of miR156 and miR172, which are microRNAs regulating phase change, support the accelerated juvenile-adult phase change in pre The PRE gene encodes an allene oxide synthase (OsAOS1), which is a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA). pre mutant showed a low level of JA and enhanced sensitivity to gibberellic acid promoting the phase change in some plant species. We also show that prolonged plastochron in pre is caused by the accelerated PLASTOCHRON1 (PLA1) function. The present study reveals a substantial role of JA as a negative regulator of vegetative phase change.
