10.1007-s11032-008-9175-5.pdf	Efficient authentic fine mapping of the rice blast resistance gene Pik-h in the Pik cluster, using new Pik-h-differentiating isolates	2008	Molecular Breeding	Division of Plant Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannon-dai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602, Japan	The Pik-h gene in rice confers resistance to several races of rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae), and has been classified as a member of the Pik cluster, one of the most resistance (R) gene-dense regions in the rice genome. However, the loss of a key mutant isolate has long made it difficult to differentiate Pik-h from other Pik group genes especially from Pik-m. We identified new natural isolates enabling the differentiation between Pik-h and Pik-m genes, and first confirmed the authenticity of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) â€œmonogenicâ€<U+393C><U+3E64> line IRBLkh-K3, and then fine-mapped the Pik-h gene in the Pik cluster. Using 701 susceptible individuals among 3,060 siblings from a cross of IRBLkh-K3Ã—CO39, the Pik-h region was delimited to 270 kb, the narrowest interval among the Pik group genes reported to date, in the cv. Nipponbare genome. Annotation of this genome region first revealed 6 NBS-LRR type R-gene analogs (RGAs), clustered within the central 120 kb, as possible counterparts of Pik-h and 6 other Pik group R genes. Interestingly, the Pik-h region and the cluster of RGAs were shown to be located 130 kb and 230 kb apart from Xa4 and Xa2 bacterial blight resistance genes, respectively, once classified as belonging to the Pik cluster. The closest recombination events were limited to the margins of the Pik-h region, and recombination was suppressed in the core interval with the RGA cluster. This fine-mapping, performed in a short time using an HEGS system, will facilitate utilization of the clusterâ€™s genetic resources and help to elucidate the mechanism of evolution of R-genes. The presence of natural isolates also confirmed that evolution of Pik-h corresponds to pathogen evolution.
J. Exp. Bot.-2012-Gupta-757-72.pdf	The single functional blast resistance gene Pi54 activates a complex defence mechanism in rice	2012	J Exp Bot	National Research Centre on Plant Biotechnology, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa Campus, New Delhi-110012, India.	The Pi54 gene (Pi-k(h)) confers a high degree of resistance to diverse strains of the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. In order to understand the genome-wide co-expression of genes in the transgenic rice plant Taipei 309 (TP) containing the Pi54 gene, microarray analysis was performed at 72 h post-inoculation of the M. oryzae strain PLP-1. A total of 1154 differentially expressing genes were identified in TP-Pi54 plants. Of these, 587 were up-regulated, whereas 567 genes were found to be down-regulated. 107 genes were found that were exclusively up-regulated and 58 genes that were down- regulated in the case of TP-Pi54. Various defence response genes, such as callose, laccase, PAL, and peroxidase, and genes related to transcription factors like NAC6, Dof zinc finger, MAD box, bZIP, and WRKY were found to be up-regulated in the transgenic line. The enzymatic activities of six plant defence response enzymes, such as peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, beta-glucosidase, beta-1,3-glucanase, and chitinase, were found to be significantly high in TP-Pi54 at different stages of inoculation by M. oryzae. The total phenol content also increased significantly in resistant transgenic plants after pathogen inoculation. This study suggests the activation of defence response and transcription factor-related genes and a higher expression of key enzymes involved in the defence response pathway in the rice line TP-Pi54, thus leading to incompatible host-pathogen interaction.
s13562-010-0026-1.pdf	Functional complementation of rice blast resistance gene Pi-k h (Pi54) conferring resistance to diverse strains of Magnaporthe oryzae	2011	Journal of Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology	National Research Centre on Plant Biotechnology, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, 110012, India	Blast disease of rice, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is an explosive disease that can spread rapidly in conducive conditions. R-gene mediated resistance offers an environmentally sustainable solution for management of this important disease of rice. We have earlier identified a unique R-gene of rice, on chromosome 11 of Oryza sativa ssp. indica cultivar Tetep. In this study we report functional validation of the Pi-k h (Pi54) gene using complementation assay. The blast resistance candidate gene Pi-k h (Pi54) was cloned into a plant transformation vector and the construct was used to transform a japonica cultivar of rice Taipei 309, which is susceptible to M. oryzae. Transgenic lines containing Pi-k h (Pi54) gene were found to confer high degree of resistance to diverse isolates of M. oryzae. The callose deposition was analyzed and compared between the transgenic and non-transgenic rice plants and widespread deposition was observed at the infection sites in plants showing incompatible interaction. Successful complementation of Pi-k h (Pi54) gene confirmed that the gene is responsible for resistance to M. oryzae in transgenic lines developed during this study. Expression analysis of the gene in resistant plants revealed that the gene is pathogen inducible in nature and is not expressed constitutively. Detection of callose deposition in resistant plants containing Pi-k h (Pi54) gene implicates its involvement in the initiation of defense response cascade.

Here, we report the molecular mapping and cloning of a dominant gene (Pi-k ( h )) present in the rice line Tetep, which is associated with resistance to rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe grisea. This gene is effective against M. grisea populations prevalent in the Northwestern Himalayan region of India. Using 178 sequence tagged microsatellite, sequence-tagged site, expressed sequence tag and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to genotype a population of 208 F(2) individuals, we mapped the Pi-k ( h ) gene between two SSR markers (TRS26 and TRS33) which are 0.7 and 0.5 cM away, respectively, and can be used in marker-assisted-selection for blast-resistant rice cultivars. We used the markers to identify the homologous region in the genomic sequence of Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare, and a physical map consisting of two overlapping bacterial artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome clones was assembled, spanning a region of 143,537 bp on the long arm of chromosome 11. Using bioinformatic analyses, we then identified a candidate blast-resistance gene in the region, and cloned the homologous sequence from Tetep. The putative Pi-k ( h ) gene cloned from Tetep is 1.5 kbp long with a single ORF, and belongs to the nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat class of disease resistance genes. Structural and expression analysis of the Pi-k ( h ) gene revealed that its expression is pathogen inducible.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs10142-012-0284-1.pdf	A novel blast resistance gene, Pi54rh cloned from wild species of rice, Oryza rhizomatis confers broad spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae	2012	Funct Integr Genomics	National Research Centre on Plant Biotechnology, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi 110 012, India.	The dominant rice blast resistance gene, Pi54 confers resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in different parts of India. In our effort to identify more effective forms of this gene, we isolated an orthologue of Pi54 named as Pi54rh from the blast-resistant wild species of rice, Oryza rhizomatis, using allele mining approach and validated by complementation. The Pi54rh belongs to CC-NBS-LRR family of disease resistance genes with a unique Zinc finger (C(3)H type) domain. The 1,447 bp Pi54rh transcript comprises of 101 bp 5'-UTR, 1,083 bp coding region and 263 bp 3'-UTR, driven by pathogen inducible promoter. We showed the extracellular localization of Pi54rh protein and the presence of glycosylation, myristoylation and phosphorylation sites which implicates its role in signal transduction process. This is in contrast to other blast resistance genes that are predicted to be intracellular NBS-LRR-type resistance proteins. The Pi54rh was found to express constitutively at basal level in the leaves, but upregulates 3.8-fold at 96 h post-inoculation with the pathogen. Functional validation of cloned Pi54rh gene using complementation test showed high degree of resistance to seven isolates of M. oryzae collected from different geographical locations of India. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrated that a rice blast resistance gene Pi54rh cloned from wild species of rice provides broad spectrum resistance to M. oryzae hence can be used in rice improvement breeding programme.
NA	Phenotypic expression of blast resistance gene Pi54 is not affected by its chromosomal position.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	National Research Centre on Plant Biotechnology, Lal Bahadur Shastri Centre, Pusa Campus, New Delhi, 110 012, India.	This is a novel report in which chromosomal position of the rice blast resistance gene Pi54 was not found to affect significantly the resistance phenotype or morphological traits. Blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is a serious constraint in rice production at global level. Pi54 gene imparts resistance against M. oryzae. Three different transgenic lines containing Pi54 and its orthologue Pi54rh were shown to be resistant to different races of M. oryzae. To determine the chromosomal location of Pi54 gene in transgenic lines, inverse PCR was performed. Our analysis showed that in two transgenic lines, Pi54 gene was integrated on chromosomes 6 and 10 at 12.94 and 22.30Â Mb, respectively. Similarly, Pi54rh allele was integrated on chromosome 1 at 16.25Â Mb. The Pi54 gene present on chromosome 6 was located in a non-coding region whereas in the other TP-Pi54 line, the gene was introgressed on chromosome 10 in between the coding region of SAP domain gene. The Pi54rh was also located in the non coding region flanked by the retrotransposon genes. These rice lines were evaluated for eight different traits related to seed and plant morphology and agronomic features for two consecutive years. The transgenic lines containing Pi54 gene have higher tiller number, grain weight, epicotyl length, and yield compared to the non-transgenic control. Multivariate correlation analysis shows that blast resistance was positively correlated with the number of tillers; thousand grain weight and epicotyl length. These results will facilitate precise utilization of Pi54 gene and its orthologue in breeding programs for the development of rice cultivars with broad spectrum and durable resistance to M. oryzae.
NA	Extensive sequence variation in rice blast resistance gene Pi54 makes it broad spectrum in nature.	2015	Front Plant Sci	National Research Centre on Plant Biotechnology, Pusa Campus New Delhi, India ; Department of Biotechnology, Himachal Pradesh University Shimla, India.	Rice blast resistant gene, Pi54 cloned from rice line, Tetep, is effective against diverse isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae. In this study, we prospected the allelic variants of the dominant blast resistance gene from a set of 92 rice lines to determine the nucleotide diversity, pattern of its molecular evolution, phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary dynamics, and to develop allele specific markers. High quality sequences were generated for homologs of Pi54 gene. Using comparative sequence analysis, InDels of variable sizes in all the alleles were observed. Profiling of the selected sites of SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) and amino acids (N sites â‰¥ 10) exhibited constant frequency distribution of mutational and substitutional sites between the resistance and susceptible rice lines, respectively. A total of 50 new haplotypes based on the nucleotide polymorphism was also identified. A unique haplotype (H_3) was found to be linked to all the resistant alleles isolated from indica rice lines. Unique leucine zipper and tyrosine sulfation sites were identified in the predicted Pi54 proteins. Selection signals were observed in entire coding sequence of resistance alleles, as compared to LRR domains for susceptible alleles. This is a maiden report of extensive variability of Pi54 alleles in different landraces and cultivated varieties, possibly, attributing broad-spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae. The sequence variation in two consensus region: 163 and 144 bp were used for the development of allele specific DNA markers. Validated markers can be used for the selection and identification of better allele(s) and their introgression in commercial rice cultivars employing marker assisted selection.
NA	Identification of novel alleles of the rice blast resistance gene Pi54.	2015	Sci Rep	Plant Biotechnology, Department of Biology, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), Zurich, Switzerland.	Rice blast is one of the most devastating rice diseases and continuous resistance breeding is required to control the disease. The rice blast resistance gene Pi54 initially identified in an Indian cultivar confers broad-spectrum resistance in India. We explored the allelic diversity of the Pi54 gene among 885 Indian rice genotypes that were found resistant in our screening against field mixture of naturally existing M. oryzae strains as well as against five unique strains. These genotypes are also annotated as rice blast resistant in the International Rice Genebank database. Sequence-based allele mining was used to amplify and clone the Pi54 allelic variants. Nine new alleles of Pi54 were identified based on the nucleotide sequence comparison to the Pi54 reference sequence as well as to already known Pi54 alleles. DNA sequence analysis of the newly identified Pi54 alleles revealed several single polymorphic sites, three double deletions and an eight base pair deletion. A SNP-rich region was found between a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site and the nucleotide binding site (NBS) domain. Together, the newly identified Pi54 alleles expand the allelic series and are candidates for rice blast resistance breeding programs.
NA	Over-Expression of the Pikh Gene with a CaMV 35S Promoter Leads to Improved Blast Disease (Magnaporthe oryzae) Tolerance in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Laboratory of Food Crops, Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Universiti Putra Malaysia Serdang, Malaysia.	Magnaporthe oryzae is a rice blast fungus and plant pathogen that causes a serious rice disease and, therefore, poses a threat to the world's second most important food security crop. Plant transformation technology has become an adaptable system for cultivar improvement and to functionally analyze genes in plants. The objective of this study was to determine the effects (through over-expressing and using the CaMV 35S promoter) of Pikh on MR219 resistance because it is a rice variety that is susceptible to the blast fungus pathotype P7.2. Thus, a full DNA and coding DNA sequence (CDS) of the Pikh gene, 3172 bp, and 1206 bp in length, were obtained through amplifying the gDNA and cDNA template from a PH9-resistant rice variety using a specific primer. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation technology was also used to introduce the Pikh gene into the MR219 callus. Subsequently, transgenic plants were evaluated from the DNA to protein stages using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), semi-quantitative RT-PCR, real-time quantitative PCR and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Transgenic plants were also compared with a control using a real-time quantification technique (to quantify the pathogen population), and transgenic and control plants were challenged with the local most virulent M. oryzae pathotype, P7.2. Based on the results, the Pikh gene encodes a hydrophilic protein with 18 sheets, 4 helixes, and 21 coils. This protein contains 401 amino acids, among which the amino acid sequence from 1 to 376 is a non-cytoplasmic region, that from 377 to 397 is a transmembrane region, and that from 398 to 401 is a cytoplasmic region with no identified disordered regions. The Pikh gene was up-regulated in the transgenic plants compared with the control plants. The quantity of the amino acid leucine in the transgenic rice plants increased significantly from 17.131 in the wild-type to 47.865 mg g(-1) in transgenic plants. The M. oryzae population was constant at 31, 48, and 72 h after inoculation in transgenic plants, while it was increased in the inoculated control plants. This study successfully clarified that over-expression of the Pikh gene in transgenic plants can improve their blast resistance against the M. oryzae pathotype P7.2.
NA	Divergent evolution of rice blast resistance Pi54 locus in the genus Oryza.	2018	Rice (N Y)	Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, 980-8577, Japan.	The rice blast resistance gene Pi54 was cloned from Oryza sativa ssp. indica cv. Tetep, which conferred broad-spectrum resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae. Pi54 allelic variants have been identified in not only domesticates but also wild rice species, but the majority of japonica and some indica cultivars lost the function.We here found that Pi54 (Os11g0639100) and its homolog Os11g0640600 (named as #11) were closely located on a 25 kbp region in japonica cv. Sasanishiki compared to a 99 kbp region in japonica cv. Nipponbare. Sasanishiki lost at least six genes containing one other R-gene cluster (Os11g0639600, Os11g0640000, and Os11g0640300). Eight AA-genome species including five wild rice species were classified into either Nipponbare or Sasanishiki type. The BB-genome wild rice species O. punctata was Sasanishiki type. The FF-genome wild rice species O. brachyantha (the basal lineage of Oryza) was neither, because Pi54 was absent and the orientation of the R-gene cluster was reversed in comparison with Nipponbare-type species. The phylogenetic analysis showed that #11gene of O. brachyantha was on the root of both Pi54 and #11 alleles. All Nipponbare-type Pi54 alleles were specifically disrupted by 143 and 37/44<U+2009>bp insertions compared to Tetep and Sasanishiki type. In addition, Pi54 of japonica cv. Sasanishiki lost nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) domains owing to additional mutations.These results suggest that Pi54 might be derived from a tandem duplication of the ancestor #11 gene in progenitor FF-genome species. Two divergent structures of Pi54 locus caused by a mobile unit containing the nearby R-gene cluster could be developed before domestication. This study provides a potential genetic resource of rice breeding for blast resistance in modern cultivars sustainability.
NA	Gene Pyramiding for Achieving Enhanced Resistance to Bacterial Blight, Blast, and Sheath Blight Diseases in Rice	2020	Front Plant Sci	Centre of Excellence for Innovations, Department of Biotechnology, Agricultural College and Research Institute, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Madurai, India.	Bacterial blight, blast, and sheath blight are the commonest diseases causing substantial yield loss in rice around the world. Stacking of broad-spectrum resistance genes/QTLs into popular cultivars is becoming a major objective of any disease resistance breeding program. The varieties ASD 16 and ADT 43 are the two popular, high yielding, and widely grown rice cultivars of South India, which are susceptible to bacterial blight (BB), blast, and sheath blight diseases. The present study was carried out to improve the cultivars (ASD 16 and ADT 43) through introgression of bacterial blight (xa5, xa13, and Xa21), blast (Pi54), and sheath blight (qSBR7-1, qSBR11-1, and qSBR11-2) resistance genes/QTLs by MABB (marker-assisted backcross breeding). IRBB60 (xa5, xa13, and Xa21) and Tetep (Pi54; qSBR7-1, qSBR11-1, and qSBR11-2) were used as donors to introgress BB, blast, and sheath blight resistance into the recurrent parents (ASD 16 and ADT 43). Homozygous (BC3F3 generation), three-gene bacterial blight pyramided (xa5 + xa13 + Xa21) lines were developed, and these lines were crossed with Tetep to combine blast (Pi54) and sheath blight (qSBR7-1, qSBR11-1, and qSBR11-2) resistance. In BC3F3 generation, the improved pyramided lines carrying a total of seven genes/QTLs (xa5 + xa13 + Xa21 + Pi54 + qSBR7-1 + qSBR11-1 + qSBR11-2) were selected through molecular and phenotypic assay, and these were evaluated for resistance against bacterial blight, blast, and sheath blight pathogens under greenhouse conditions. We have selected nine lines in ASD 16 background and 15 lines in ADT 43 background, exhibiting a high degree of resistance to BB, blast, and sheath blight diseases and also possessing phenotypes of recurrent parents. The improved pyramided lines are expected to be used as improved varieties or used as a potential donor in breeding programs. The present study successfully introgressed Pi54, and qSBR QTLs (qSBR7-1, qSBR11-1, and qSBR11-2) from Tetep and major effective BB-resistant genes (xa5, xa13, and Xa21) from IRBB60 into the commercial varieties for durable resistance to multiple diseases.
