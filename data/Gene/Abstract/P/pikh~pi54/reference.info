However, the loss of a key mutant isolate has long made it difficult to differentiate Pik-h from other Pik group genes especially from Pik-m. We identified new natural isolates enabling the differentiation between Pik-h and Pik-m genes, and first confirmed the authenticity of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) â€œmonogenicâ€<U+393C><U+3E64> line IRBLkh-K3, and then fine-mapped the Pik-h gene in the Pik cluster. Using 701 susceptible individuals among 3,060 siblings from a cross of IRBLkh-K3Ã—CO39, the Pik-h region was delimited to 270 kb, the narrowest interval among the Pik group genes reported to date, in the cv. Nipponbare genome. Annotation of this genome region first revealed 6 NBS-LRR type R-gene analogs (RGAs), clustered within the central 120 kb, as possible counterparts of Pik-h and 6 other Pik group R genes. Interestingly, the Pik-h region and the cluster of RGAs were shown to be located 130 kb and 230 kb apart from Xa4 and Xa2 bacterial blight resistance genes, respectively, once classified as belonging to the Pik cluster. The closest recombination events were limited to the margins of the Pik-h region, and recombination was suppressed in the core interval with the RGA cluster. This fine-mapping, performed in a short time using an HEGS system, will facilitate utilization of the clusterâ€™s genetic resources and help to elucidate the mechanism of evolution of R-genes. The presence of natural isolates also confirmed that evolution of Pik-h corresponds to pathogen evolution.
J. Exp. Bot.-2012-Gupta-757-72.pdf	The single functional blast resistance gene Pi54 activates a complex defence mechanism in rice	2012	J Exp Bot	National Research Centre on Plant Biotechnology, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa Campus, New Delhi-110012, India.	The Pi54 gene (Pi-k(h)) confers a high degree of resistance to diverse strains of the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. In order to understand the genome-wide co-expression of genes in the transgenic rice plant Taipei 309 (TP) containing the Pi54 gene, microarray analysis was performed at 72 h post-inoculation of the M. oryzae strain PLP-1. A total of 1154 differentially expressing genes were identified in TP-Pi54 plants. Of these, 587 were up-regulated, whereas 567 genes were found to be down-regulated. 107 genes were found that were exclusively up-regulated and 58 genes that were down- regulated in the case of TP-Pi54. Various defence response genes, such as callose, laccase, PAL, and peroxidase, and genes related to transcription factors like NAC6, Dof zinc finger, MAD box, bZIP, and WRKY were found to be up-regulated in the transgenic line. The enzymatic activities of six plant defence response enzymes, such as peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, beta-glucosidase, beta-1,3-glucanase, and chitinase, were found to be significantly high in TP-Pi54 at different stages of inoculation by M. oryzae. The total phenol content also increased significantly in resistant transgenic plants after pathogen inoculation. This study suggests the activation of defence response and transcription factor-related genes and a higher expression of key enzymes involved in the defence response pathway in the rice line TP-Pi54, thus leading to incompatible host-pathogen interaction.

R-gene mediated resistance offers an environmentally sustainable solution for management of this important disease of rice. We have earlier identified a unique R-gene of rice, on chromosome 11 of Oryza sativa ssp. indica cultivar Tetep. In this study we report functional validation of the Pi-k h (Pi54) gene using complementation assay. The blast resistance candidate gene Pi-k h (Pi54) was cloned into a plant transformation vector and the construct was used to transform a japonica cultivar of rice Taipei 309, which is susceptible to M. oryzae. Transgenic lines containing Pi-k h (Pi54) gene were found to confer high degree of resistance to diverse isolates of M. oryzae. The callose deposition was analyzed and compared between the transgenic and non-transgenic rice plants and widespread deposition was observed at the infection sites in plants showing incompatible interaction. Successful complementation of Pi-k h (Pi54) gene confirmed that the gene is responsible for resistance to M. oryzae in transgenic lines developed during this study. Expression analysis of the gene in resistant plants revealed that the gene is pathogen inducible in nature and is not expressed constitutively. Detection of callose deposition in resistant plants containing Pi-k h (Pi54) gene implicates its involvement in the initiation of defense response cascade.

Here, we report the molecular mapping and cloning of a dominant gene (Pi-k ( h )) present in the rice line Tetep, which is associated with resistance to rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe grisea. This gene is effective against M. grisea populations prevalent in the Northwestern Himalayan region of India. Using 178 sequence tagged microsatellite, sequence-tagged site, expressed sequence tag and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to genotype a population of 208 F(2) individuals, we mapped the Pi-k ( h ) gene between two SSR markers (TRS26 and TRS33) which are 0.7 and 0.5 cM away, respectively, and can be used in marker-assisted-selection for blast-resistant rice cultivars. We used the markers to identify the homologous region in the genomic sequence of Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare, and a physical map consisting of two overlapping bacterial artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome clones was assembled, spanning a region of 143,537 bp on the long arm of chromosome 11. Using bioinformatic analyses, we then identified a candidate blast-resistance gene in the region, and cloned the homologous sequence from Tetep. The putative Pi-k ( h ) gene cloned from Tetep is 1.5 kbp long with a single ORF, and belongs to the nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat class of disease resistance genes. Structural and expression analysis of the Pi-k ( h ) gene revealed that its expression is pathogen inducible.

The dominant rice blast resistance gene, Pi54 confers resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in different parts of India. In our effort to identify more effective forms of this gene, we isolated an orthologue of Pi54 named as Pi54rh from the blast-resistant wild species of rice, Oryza rhizomatis, using allele mining approach and validated by complementation. The Pi54rh belongs to CC-NBS-LRR family of disease resistance genes with a unique Zinc finger (C(3)H type) domain. The 1,447 bp Pi54rh transcript comprises of 101 bp 5'-UTR, 1,083 bp coding region and 263 bp 3'-UTR, driven by pathogen inducible promoter. We showed the extracellular localization of Pi54rh protein and the presence of glycosylation, myristoylation and phosphorylation sites which implicates its role in signal transduction process. This is in contrast to other blast resistance genes that are predicted to be intracellular NBS-LRR-type resistance proteins. The Pi54rh was found to express constitutively at basal level in the leaves, but upregulates 3.8-fold at 96 h post-inoculation with the pathogen. Functional validation of cloned Pi54rh gene using complementation test showed high degree of resistance to seven isolates of M. oryzae collected from different geographical locations of India. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrated that a rice blast resistance gene Pi54rh cloned from wild species of rice provides broad spectrum resistance to M. oryzae hence can be used in rice improvement breeding programme.
