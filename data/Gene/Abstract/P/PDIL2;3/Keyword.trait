PDIL2;3	reticulum stress response	Cis-element of the rice PDIL2-3 promoter is responsible for inducing the endoplasmic reticulum stress response.	Cis-element of the rice PDIL2-3 promoter is responsible for inducing the endoplasmic reticulum stress response.
PDIL2;3	stress response	Cis-element of the rice PDIL2-3 promoter is responsible for inducing the endoplasmic reticulum stress response.	Cis-element of the rice PDIL2-3 promoter is responsible for inducing the endoplasmic reticulum stress response.
PDIL2;3	ER stress	Cis-element of the rice PDIL2-3 promoter is responsible for inducing the endoplasmic reticulum stress response.	The activation of PDIL2-3 in response to ER stress strongly depends on the IRE1-OsbZIP50 signaling pathway.
