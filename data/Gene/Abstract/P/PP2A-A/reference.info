A 2225 bp cDNA, designated RPA1, was isolated from an Oryza sativa cDNA library. Analysis revealed a 1761 bp coding sequence with 15 non-identical repeat units. The ORF encoded the A regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A-A) as ascertained by complementation of the yeast tpd3 mutant defective in this gene. The corresponding genomic DNA from a rice genome BAC library revealed that the gene contains eleven introns. The rice genome contains only a single copy of this gene as judged by Southern blot analysis. The PP2A protein is highly conserved in nature; the rice protein shows 88% amino acid identity with its counterparts in Arabidopsis or Nicotiana tabacum.
