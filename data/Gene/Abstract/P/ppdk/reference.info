The enzyme is also ubiquitous in C3 plant tissues, although a precise non-photosynthetic C3 function(s) is yet to be validated, owing largely to its low abundance in most C3 organs. The single C3 organ type where PPDK is in high abundance, and, therefore, where its function is most amenable to elucidation, are the developing seeds of graminaceous cereals. In this report, we suggest a non-photosynthetic function for C3 PPDK by characterizing its abundance and posttranslational regulation in developing Oryza sativa (rice) seeds. Using primarily an immunoblot-based approach, we show that PPDK is a massively expressed protein during the early syncitial-endosperm/-cellularization stage of seed development. As seed development progresses from this early stage, the enzyme undergoes a rapid, posttranslational down-regulation in activity and amount via regulatory threonyl-phosphorylation (PPDK inactivation) and protein degradation. Immunoblot analysis of separated seed tissue fractions (pericarp, embryo + aleurone, seed embryo) revealed that regulatory phosphorylation of PPDK occurs in the non-green seed embryo and green outer pericarp layer, but not in the endosperm + aleurone layer. The modestly abundant pool of inactive PPDK (phosphorylated + dephosphorylated) that was found to persist in mature rice seeds was shown to remain largely unchanged (inactive) upon seed germination, suggesting that PPDK in rice seeds function in developmental rather than in post-developmental processes. These and related observations lead us to postulate a putative function for the enzyme that aligns its PEP to pyruvate-forming reaction with biosynthetic processes that are specific to early cereal seed development.

We have isolated a floury endosperm-4 (flo4) rice mutant with a floury-white endosperm but a normal outer portion. Scanning electron microscopic analysis revealed that this abnormal endosperm consisted of loosely packed starch granules. The mutant phenotype was generated by T-DNA insertion into the fifth intron of the OsPPDKB gene encoding pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK). Plants containing flo4-1 produced no OsPPDKB transcript or the OsPPDKB protein in their developing kernels and leaves. We obtained two additional alleles, flo4-2 and flo4-3, that also showed the same white-core endosperm phenotype. The flo4 kernels weighed about 6% less than wild-type ones. Starch contents in both kernel types were similar, but the total protein content was slightly higher in the mutant kernels. Moreover, lipid contents were significantly increased in the flo4 kernels. Expression analyses demonstrated that the cytosolic mRNA of OsPPDKB was induced in the reproductive organs after pollination, and greatly increased until about 10 days after fertilization. This mRNA was localized mainly in the endosperm, aleurone, and scutellum of the developing kernel. Our results suggest that cytosolic PPDK functions in rice to modulate carbon metabolism during grain filling.

As in maize, there are at least two ppdk genes in rice and one of them was very similar to the maize C4-type ppdk. The deduced amino acid sequence of the rice PPDK was 88% homologous to the maize C4-type PPDK in the mature peptide region and 56% homologous in the transit peptide region. The C4-like ppdk in rice contained 21 exons, which were interrupted by twenty introns, and the positions of the introns were essentially the same as those in the gene from maize, with the except in that the gene from rice had two extra introns. Such extra introns were also found in the C4-type ppdk from a dicot, Flaveria, at the same positions. These results strongly suggest that the two introns were present in an ancestral gene before the divergence of monocot and dicot plants. The C4-like ppdk in rice contained two functionally independent promoters had generated a larger transcript with the transit peptide region and a smaller transcript without this region. The unusual dual-promoter system for transcription has been conserved in the C4-type ppdk gene from maize, indicating that the dual-promoter system is a common feature of ppdk genes in both C3 and C4 plants. The patterns of expression of the two transcripts in rice were different: the larger transcript was expressed exclusively in green leaves at a low level whereas the smaller transcript was expressed in some reproductive organs at a high level. Essentially the same patterns of expression were observed in maize, but the level of expression of the larger transcript in maize green leaves was much higher than that in green leaves of rice. The promoter activities of the rice and maize genes for PPDK were examined directly in a transient expression assay in maize mesophyll protoplasts after electroporation with promoter::Î²-glucuronidase chimeric genes. The rice promoter for the smaller transcript was very active in the protoplasts but the rice promoter for the larger transcript had relatively low activity. By contrast, both promoters of the maize gene had high activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the rice C4-like ppdk is very similar to the maize C4-type ppdk, not only in terms of primary structure but also in terms of the regulation of expression, with the exception that the strength of the maize promoter for the larger transcript is higher. The results strongly suggest that the genetic alterations required to give rise to the C4-type ppdk gene were relatively limited.
