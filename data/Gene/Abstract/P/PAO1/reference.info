KEY MESSAGE: Oryza sativa polyamine oxidase 1 back-converts spermine (or thermospermine) to spermidine. Considering the previous work, major path of polyamine catabolism in rice plant is suggestive to be back-conversion but not terminal catabolism. Rice (Oryza sativa) contains seven genes encoding polyamine oxidases (PAOs), termed OsPAO1 to OsPAO7, based on their chromosomal number and gene ID number. We previously showed that three of these members, OsPAO3, OsPAO4 and OsPAO5, are abundantly expressed, that their products localize to peroxisomes and that they catalyze the polyamine back-conversion reaction. Here, we have focused on OsPAO1. The OsPAO1 gene product shares a high level of identity with those of Arabidopsis PAO5 and Brassica juncea PAO. Expression of OsPAO1 appears to be quite low under physiological conditions, but is markedly induced in rice roots by spermine (Spm) or T-Spm treatment. Consistent with the above finding, the recombinant OsPAO1 prefers T-Spm as a substrate at pH 6.0 and Spm at pH 8.5 and, in both cases, back-converts these tetraamines to spermidine, but not to putrescine. OsPAO1 localizes to the cytoplasm of onion epidermal cells. Differing in subcellular localization, four out of seven rice PAOs, OsPAO1, OsPAO3, OsPAO4 and OsPAO5, catalyze back-conversion reactions of PAs. Based on the results, we discuss the catabolic path(s) of PAs in rice plant.

Polyamine oxidases (PAOs) are FAD-dependent enzymes involved in polyamine (PA) catabolism. Recent studies have revealed that plant PAOs are not only active in the terminal catabolism of PAs as demonstrated for maize apoplastic PAO but also in a polyamine back-conversion pathway as shown for most Arabidopsis PAOs. We have characterized Oryza sativa PAOs at molecular and biochemical levels. The rice genome contains 7 PAO isoforms that are termed OsPAO1 to OsPAO7. Of the seven PAOs, OsPAO3, OsPAO4, and OsPAO5 transcripts were most abundant in 2-week-old seedlings and mature plants, while OsPAO1, OsPAO2, OsPAO6, and OsPAO7 were expressed at very low levels with different tissue specificities. The more abundantly expressed PAOs--OsPAO3, OsPAO4, and OsPAO5--were cloned, and their gene products were produced in Escherichia coli. The enzymatic activities of the purified OsPAO3 to OsPAO5 proteins were examined. OsPAO3 favored spermidine (Spd) as substrate followed by thermospermine (T-Spm) and spermine (Spm) and showed a full PA back-conversion activity. OsPAO4 substrate specificity was similar to that of OsPAO5 preferring Spm and T-Spm but not Spd. Those enzymes also converted Spm and T-Spm to Spd, again indicative of PA back-conversion activities. Lastly, we show that OsPAO3, OsPAO4, and OsPAO5 are localized in peroxisomes. Together, these data revealed that constitutively and highly expressed O. sativa PAOs are localized in peroxisomes and catalyze PA back-conversion processes.
Takahashi-2010-Characterization of.pdf	Characterization of five polyamine oxidase isoforms in Arabidopsis thaliana	2010	Plant Cell Rep	Laboratory of Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology, Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, 2-1-1 Katahira, Aoba, Sendai, Miyagi, 980-8577, Japan. ytakahashi@ige.tohoku.ac.jp	The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana contains five genes (AtPAO1 to AtPAO5) encoding polyamine oxidase (PAO) which is an enzyme responsible for polyamine catabolism. To understand the individual roles of the five AtPAOs, here we characterized their tissue-specific and space-temporal expression. AtPAO1 seems to have a specific function in flower organ. AtPAO2 was expressed in shoot meristem and root tip of seedlings, and to a higher extent in the later growth stage within restricted parts of the organs, such as shoot meristem, leaf petiole and also in anther. The expression of AtPAO3 was constitutive, but highest in flower organ. AtPAO3 promoter activity was detected in cotyledon, distal portion of root, boundary region of mature rosette leaf and in filaments of flower. AtPAO4 was expressed at higher level all over young seedlings including roots, and in the mature stage its expression was ubiquitous with rather lower level in stem. AtPAO5 expression was observed in the whole plant body throughout various growth stages. Its highest expression was in flowers, particularly in sepals, but not in petals. Furthermore, we determined the substrate specificity of AtPAO1 to AtPAO4. None of the AtPAO enzymes recognized putrescine (Put). AtPAO2 and AtPAO3 showed almost similar substrate recognition patterns in which the most preferable substrate is spermidine (Spd) followed by less specificity to other tetraamines tested. AtPAO4 seemed to be spermine (Spm)-specific. More interestingly, AtPAO1 preferred thermospermine (T-Spm) and norspermine (NorSpm) to Spm, but did not recognize Spd. Based on the results, the individual function of AtPAOs is discussed.
NA	POLYAMINE OXIDASE 1 from rice (Oryza sativa) is a functional ortholog of Arabidopsis POLYAMINE OXIDASE 5.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	Graduate School of Life Sciences; Tohoku University; Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.	POLYAMINE OXIDASE 1 (OsPAO1), from rice (Oryza sativa), and POLYAMINE OXIDASE 5 (AtPAO5), from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), are enzymes sharing high identity at the amino acid level and with similar characteristics, such as polyamine specificity and pH preference; furthermore, both proteins localize to the cytosol. A loss-of-function Arabidopsis mutant, Atpao5-2, was hypersensitive to low doses of exogenous thermospermine but this phenotype could be rescued by introduction of the wild-type AtPAO5 gene. Introduction of OsPAO1, under the control of a constitutive promoter, into Atpao5-2 mutants also restored normal thermospermine sensitivity, allowing growth in the presence of low levels of thermospermine, along with a concomitant decrease in thermospermine content in plants. By contrast, introduction of OsPAO3, which encodes a peroxisome-localized polyamine oxidase, into Atpao5-2 plants could not rescue any of the mutant phenotypes in the presence of thermospermine. These results suggest that OsPAO1 is the functional ortholog of AtPAO5.
