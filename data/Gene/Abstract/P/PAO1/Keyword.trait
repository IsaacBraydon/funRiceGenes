OsPAO1|PAO1	flower	Characterization of five polyamine oxidase isoforms in Arabidopsis thaliana	AtPAO1 seems to have a specific function in flower organ
OsPAO1|PAO1	root	Oryza sativa polyamine oxidase 1 back-converts tetraamines, spermine and thermospermine, to spermidine	Expression of OsPAO1 appears to be quite low under physiological conditions, but is markedly induced in rice roots by spermine (Spm) or T-Spm treatment
OsPAO1|PAO1	seedling	Constitutively and highly expressed Oryza sativa polyamine oxidases localize in peroxisomes and catalyze polyamine back conversion	Of the seven PAOs, OsPAO3, OsPAO4, and OsPAO5 transcripts were most abundant in 2-week-old seedlings and mature plants, while OsPAO1, OsPAO2, OsPAO6, and OsPAO7 were expressed at very low levels with different tissue specificities
