APIP10	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	The E3 Ligase APIP10 Connects the Effector AvrPiz-t to the NLR Receptor Piz-t in Rice.	The E3 Ligase APIP10 Connects the Effector AvrPiz-t to the NLR Receptor Piz-t in Rice.
APIP10	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	The E3 Ligase APIP10 Connects the Effector AvrPiz-t to the NLR Receptor Piz-t in Rice.	Conversely, silencing of APIP10 in the Piz-t background causes cell death, significant accumulation of Piz-t, and enhanced resistance to M

APIP10	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	The E3 Ligase APIP10 Connects the Effector AvrPiz-t to the NLR Receptor Piz-t in Rice.	We show that APIP10 promotes degradation of Piz-t via the 26S proteasome system
APIP10	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	The E3 Ligase APIP10 Connects the Effector AvrPiz-t to the NLR Receptor Piz-t in Rice.	Together, our results show that APIP10 is a novel E3 ligase that functionally connects the fungal effector AvrPiz-t to its NLR receptor Piz-t in rice
APIP5|OsbZIP53	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	Immunity to Rice Blast Disease by Suppression of Effector-Triggered Necrosis.	Conversely, Piz-t interacts with and stabilizes APIP5 to prevent necrosis at the necrotrophic stage
