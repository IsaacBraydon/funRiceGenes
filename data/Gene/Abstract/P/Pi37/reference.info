The famous rice cultivar (cv.), St. No. 1, confers complete resistance to many isolates collected from the South China region. To effectively utilize the resistance, a linkage assay using microsatellite markers (SSR) was performed in the three F2 populations derived from crosses between the donor cv. St. No. 1 and each of the three susceptible cvs. C101PKT, CO39 and AS20-1, which segregated into 3R:1S (resistant/susceptible) ratio, respectively. A total of 180 SSR markers selected from each chromosome equally were screened. The result showed that the two markers RM128 and RM486 located on chromosome 1 were linked to the resistance gene in the respective populations above. This result is not consistent with those previously reported, in which a well-known resistance gene Pif in the St. No. 1 is located on chromosome 11. To confirm this result, additional four SSR markers, which located in the region lanked by RM128 and RM486, were tested. The results showed that markers RM543 and RM319 were closer to, and RM302 and RM212 completely co-segregated with the resistance locus detected in the present study. These results indicated that another resistance gene involved in the St. No. 1, which is located on chromosome 1, and therefore tentatively designated as Pi37(t). To narrow down genomic region of the Pi37(t) locus, eight markers were newly developed in the target region through bioinformatics analysis (BIA) using the publicly available sequences. The linkage analysis with these markers showed that the Pi37(t) locus was mapped to a approximately 0.8 centimorgans (cM) interval flanked by RM543 and FPSM1, where a total of seven markers co-segregated with it. To physically map the locus, the Pi37(t)-linked markers were landed on the reference sequence of cv. Nipponbare through BIA. A contig map corresponding to the locus was constructed based on the reference sequence aligned by the Pi37(t)-linked markers. Consequently, the Pi37(t) locus was defined to 374 kb interval flanking markers RM543 and FPSM1, where only four candidate genes with the resistance gene conserved structure (NBS-LRR) were further identified to a DNA fragment of 60 kb in length by BIA.
GEN17731871.pdf	The blast resistance gene Pi37 encodes a nucleotide binding site leucine-rich repeat protein and is a member of a resistance gene cluster on rice chromosome 1	2007	Genetics	Laboratory of Plant Resistance and Genetics, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	The resistance (R) gene Pi37, present in the rice cultivar St. No. 1, was isolated by an in silico map-based cloning procedure. The equivalent genetic region in Nipponbare contains four nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) type loci. These four candidates for Pi37 (Pi37-1, -2, -3, and -4) were amplified separately from St. No. 1 via long-range PCR, and cloned into a binary vector. Each construct was individually transformed into the highly blast susceptible cultivar Q1063. The subsequent complementation analysis revealed Pi37-3 to be the functional gene, while -1, -2, and -4 are probably pseudogenes. Pi37 encodes a 1290 peptide NBS-LRR product, and the presence of substitutions at two sites in the NBS region (V239A and I247M) is associated with the resistance phenotype. Semiquantitative expression analysis showed that in St. No. 1, Pi37 was constitutively expressed and only slightly induced by blast infection. Transient expression experiments indicated that the Pi37 product is restricted to the cytoplasm. Pi37-3 is thought to have evolved recently from -2, which in turn was derived from an ancestral -1 sequence. Pi37-4 is likely the most recently evolved member of the cluster and probably represents a duplication of -3. The four Pi37 paralogs are more closely related to maize rp1 than to any of the currently isolated rice blast R genes Pita, Pib, Pi9, Pi2, Piz-t, and Pi36.
