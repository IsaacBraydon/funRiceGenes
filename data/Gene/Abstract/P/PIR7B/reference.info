To characterize the acquired resistance response in rice (Oryza sativa) we have cloned cDNAs corresponding to transcripts that accumulate concomitantly with the establishment of induced resistance following leaf infiltration with Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. Here we describe the structure and regulation of one of these cDNAs and two homologous genes. The cDNA represents a transcript from one of these genes, Pir7b, and encodes a putative protein that is 70% identical to the one encoded by Pir7a . Both of these proteins contain a lipase sequence motif. While Pir7a was not expressed under any of the circumstances that were checked, transcripts from Pir7b accumulated transiently after infiltration of leaves with P. syringae pv. syringae. In contrast to other defence-related transcripts, the accumulation of Pir7b-specific mRNA depended on the lemA gene function of the bacterial strain infiltrated. It did not occur upon treatment of the plants with other resistance-inducing agents. Thus, the Pir7b gene product does not appear to play a role in acquired resistance. Its function is more likely related to a specific property of the inducing P. syringae pv. syringae strains that is under the control of the two-component regulatory system for which lemA encodes the sensor. A hypothesis about this function is discussed.
Hassa-2000-Syringolin-mediated.pdf	Syringolin-mediated activation of the Pir7b esterase gene in rice cells is suppressed by phosphatase inhibitors	2000	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Institute of Plant Biology, University of Zurich, Switzerland.	Inoculation of rice plants (Oryza sativa) with the nonhost pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae leads to the activation of defense-related genes and ultimately to induced resistance against the rice blast fungus Pyricularia oryzae. One of the molecular determinants of P. syringae pv. syringae that is recognized by the plant cells and evokes these defense responses is syringolin A, an elicitor that is secreted by the bacteria under appropriate conditions. In order to investigate signal transduction events elicited by syringolin A, the response of cultured rice cells to syringolin A application was analyzed. Cultured rice cells were able to sense syringolin A at concentrations in the nanomolar range as observed by the transient accumulation of Pir7b esterase transcripts. Syringolin A-mediated Pir7b transcript accumulation was inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating that de novo protein synthesis was required. Calyculin and okadaic acid, two protein phosphatase inhibitors, blocked Pir7b gene induction, whereas the serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitors staurosporine and K-252a had no effect on Pir7b transcript levels. Actin transcript levels were essentially not affected by inhibitor treatments over the experimental time span. These results imply that dephosphorylation of a phosphoprotein is an important step in the syringolin A-triggered signal transduction pathway.
