PNZIP|OsCRD1|YL-1	flower	Dissection of a QTL reveals an adaptive, interacting gene complex associated with transgressive variation for flowering time in rice	1 region were associated with the presence of one or more flowering time genes (GI, SOC1, FT-L8, EMF1, and PNZIP)
PNZIP|OsCRD1|YL-1	flower	Dissection of a QTL reveals an adaptive, interacting gene complex associated with transgressive variation for flowering time in rice	Under short-day lengths, lines with introgressions carrying combinations of linked flowering time genes (GI/SOC1, SOC1/FT-L8, GI/SOC1/FT-L8 and EMF1/PNZIP) from the late parent, O
PNZIP|OsCRD1|YL-1	flower	Dissection of a QTL reveals an adaptive, interacting gene complex associated with transgressive variation for flowering time in rice	rufipogon, flowered earlier than the recurrent parent, Jefferson, while recombinant lines carrying smaller introgressions marked by the presence of GI, SOC1, EMF1 or PNZIP alone no longer flowered early
PNZIP|OsCRD1|YL-1	flower	Dissection of a QTL reveals an adaptive, interacting gene complex associated with transgressive variation for flowering time in rice	Under long-day length, lines carrying SOC1/FT-L8, SOC1 or PNZIP flowered early, while those carrying GI or EMF1 delayed flowering
