PNZIP|OsCRD1|YL-1|YGL8	flower	Dissection of a QTL reveals an adaptive, interacting gene complex associated with transgressive variation for flowering time in rice	1 region were associated with the presence of one or more flowering time genes (GI, SOC1, FT-L8, EMF1, and PNZIP)
PNZIP|OsCRD1|YL-1|YGL8	flower	Dissection of a QTL reveals an adaptive, interacting gene complex associated with transgressive variation for flowering time in rice	Under short-day lengths, lines with introgressions carrying combinations of linked flowering time genes (GI/SOC1, SOC1/FT-L8, GI/SOC1/FT-L8 and EMF1/PNZIP) from the late parent, O
PNZIP|OsCRD1|YL-1|YGL8	flower	Dissection of a QTL reveals an adaptive, interacting gene complex associated with transgressive variation for flowering time in rice	rufipogon, flowered earlier than the recurrent parent, Jefferson, while recombinant lines carrying smaller introgressions marked by the presence of GI, SOC1, EMF1 or PNZIP alone no longer flowered early
PNZIP|OsCRD1|YL-1|YGL8	flower	Dissection of a QTL reveals an adaptive, interacting gene complex associated with transgressive variation for flowering time in rice	Under long-day length, lines carrying SOC1/FT-L8, SOC1 or PNZIP flowered early, while those carrying GI or EMF1 delayed flowering
PNZIP|OsCRD1|YL-1|YGL8	flowering time	Dissection of a QTL reveals an adaptive, interacting gene complex associated with transgressive variation for flowering time in rice	1 region were associated with the presence of one or more flowering time genes (GI, SOC1, FT-L8, EMF1, and PNZIP)
PNZIP|OsCRD1|YL-1|YGL8	flowering time	Dissection of a QTL reveals an adaptive, interacting gene complex associated with transgressive variation for flowering time in rice	Under short-day lengths, lines with introgressions carrying combinations of linked flowering time genes (GI/SOC1, SOC1/FT-L8, GI/SOC1/FT-L8 and EMF1/PNZIP) from the late parent, O
PNZIP|OsCRD1|YL-1|YGL8	map-based cloning	Yellow-Leaf 1 encodes a magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester cyclase, involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Map-based cloning and over-expression analysis suggested that YL-1 encodes a subunit of MPEC
PNZIP|OsCRD1|YL-1|YGL8	Chl biosynthesis	Yellow-Leaf 1 encodes a magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester cyclase, involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Results of qRT-PCR showed that Chl biosynthesis upstream genes were highly expressed in the yl-1 mutant, while downstream genes were compromised, indicating that YL-1 plays a pivotal role in the Chl biosynthesis
