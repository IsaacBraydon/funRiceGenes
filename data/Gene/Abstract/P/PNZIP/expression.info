PNZIP|OsCRD1|YL-1	 Map-based cloning and over-expression analysis suggested that YL-1 encodes a subunit of MPEC |  RNA-seq results futher proved that numerous membrane-associated genes, including many plastid membrane-associated genes, have altered expression pattern in the yl-1 mutant, implying that YL-1 is required for plastid membrane stability
