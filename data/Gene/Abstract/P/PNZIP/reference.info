Maas-2010-Dissection of a QTL.pdf	Dissection of a QTL reveals an adaptive, interacting gene complex associated with transgressive variation for flowering time in rice	2010	Theor Appl Genet	Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Cornell University, 162 Emerson Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.	A days to heading QTL (dth1.1) located on the short arm of rice chromosome 1 was sub-divided into eight sub-introgression lines (SILs) to analyze the genetic basis of transgressive variation for flowering time. Each SIL contained one or more introgression(s) from O. rufipogon in the genetic background of the elite Oryza sativa cultivar, Jefferson. Each introgression was defined at high resolution using molecular markers and those in the dth1.1 region were associated with the presence of one or more flowering time genes (GI, SOC1, FT-L8, EMF1, and PNZIP). SILs and controls were evaluated for flowering time under both short- and long-day growing conditions. Under short-day lengths, lines with introgressions carrying combinations of linked flowering time genes (GI/SOC1, SOC1/FT-L8, GI/SOC1/FT-L8 and EMF1/PNZIP) from the late parent, O. rufipogon, flowered earlier than the recurrent parent, Jefferson, while recombinant lines carrying smaller introgressions marked by the presence of GI, SOC1, EMF1 or PNZIP alone no longer flowered early. Under long-day length, lines carrying SOC1/FT-L8, SOC1 or PNZIP flowered early, while those carrying GI or EMF1 delayed flowering. Across all experiments and in the field, only SIL_SOC1/FT-L8 was consistently early. A preliminary yield evaluation indicated that the transgressive early flowering observed in several of the SILs was also associated with a measurable and positive effect on yield. These SILs represent a new source of variation that can be used in breeding programs to manipulate flowering time in rice cultivars without the reduction in yield that is often associated with early maturing phenotypes.
Thomson-2006-Substitution mapping.pdf	Substitution mapping of dth1.1, a flowering-time quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with transgressive variation in rice, reveals multiple sub-QTL	2006	Genetics	Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.	A quantitative trait locus (QTL), dth1.1, was associated with transgressive variation for days to heading in an advanced backcross population derived from the Oryza sativa variety Jefferson and an accession of the wild rice relative Oryza rufipogon. A series of near-isogenic lines (NILs) containing different O. rufipogon introgressions across the target region were constructed to dissect dth1.1 using substitution mapping. In contrast to the late-flowering O. rufipogon parent, O. rufipogon alleles in the substitution lines caused early flowering under both short- and long-day lengths and provided evidence for at least two distinct sub-QTL: dth1.1a and dth1.1b. Potential candidate genes underlying these sub-QTL include genes with sequence similarity to Arabidopsis GI, FT, SOC1, and EMF1, and Pharbitis nil PNZIP. Evidence from families with nontarget O. rufipogon introgressions in combination with dth1.1 alleles also detected an early flowering QTL on chromosome 4 and a late-flowering QTL on chromosome 6 and provided evidence for additional sub-QTL in the dth1.1 region. The availability of a series of near-isogenic lines with alleles introgressed from a wild relative of rice provides an opportunity to better understand the molecular basis of transgressive variation in a quantitative trait.
