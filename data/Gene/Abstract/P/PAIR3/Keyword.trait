PAIR3	meiotic	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
PAIR3	meiosis	Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis	In this study, we identified a novel gene, PAIR3 (HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS 3), required for homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis in rice
PAIR3	meiosis	Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis	PAIR3 is preferentially expressed in reproductive organs, especially in pollen mother cells and the ovule tissues during meiosis
PAIR3	meiosis	Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis	Our results suggest that PAIR3 plays a crucial role in homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis in meiosis
PAIR3	meiosis	Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis	Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis
PAIR3	sterility	Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis	Two independent alleles, designated pair3-1 and pair3-2, were identified in our T-DNA insertional mutant library which could not form bivalents due to failure of homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis at diakinesis, resulting in sterility in both male and female gametes
PAIR3	pollen	Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis	PAIR3 is preferentially expressed in reproductive organs, especially in pollen mother cells and the ovule tissues during meiosis
PAIR3	reproductive	Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis	PAIR3 is preferentially expressed in reproductive organs, especially in pollen mother cells and the ovule tissues during meiosis
