OsCOM1	PAIR3	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	 Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
OsRad21-4|OsREC8	PAIR3	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	 Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
PAIR2	PAIR3	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	 Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
MER3|RCK	PAIR3	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	 Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
PAIR3	ZEP1	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	 Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
OsDMC1|DMC1B	PAIR3	OsDMC1 is not required for homologous pairing in rice meiosis.	 In the absence of OsDMC1, early recombination events probably occur normally, leading to normal localization of Î³H2AX, PAIR3, OsMRE11, OsCOM1 and OsRAD51C
OsDMC1|DMC1B	PAIR3	OsDMC1 is not required for homologous pairing in rice meiosis.	 Moreover, OsDMC1 was not detected in pairing-defective mutants, such as pair2, pair3, Oscom1 and Osrad51c, while it was loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in zep1, Osmer3, Oszip4 and Oshei10
