PDK1	magnaporthe oryzae	Pdk1 Kinase Regulates Basal Disease Resistance Through the OsOxi1-OsPti1a Phosphorylation Cascade in Rice	 The overexpression of OsPdk1 enhanced basal resistance against a blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, and a bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv
PDK1	disease resistance	Pdk1 Kinase Regulates Basal Disease Resistance Through the OsOxi1-OsPti1a Phosphorylation Cascade in Rice	 We show here that OsPdk1 acts upstream of the OsOxi1-OsPti1a signal cascade in disease resistance in rice| Taken together, these results suggest that OsPdk1 positively regulates basal disease resistance through the OsOxi1-OsPti1a phosphorylation cascade in rice|Pdk1 Kinase Regulates Basal Disease Resistance Through the OsOxi1-OsPti1a Phosphorylation Cascade in Rice
