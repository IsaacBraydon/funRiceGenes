Deak-1999-Characterisation of.pdf	Characterisation of a plant 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 homologue which contains a pleckstrin homology domain	1999	FEBS Letters	MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit, Department of Biochemistry, University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 5EH, UK	A plant homologue of mammalian 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) has been identified in Arabidopsis and rice which displays 40% overall identity with human 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1. Like the mammalian 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, Arabidopsis 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 and rice 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 possess a kinase domain at N-termini and a pleckstrin homology domain at their C-termini. Arabidopsis 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 can rescue lethality in Saccharomyces cerevisiae caused by disruption of the genes encoding yeast 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 homologues. Arabidopsis 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 interacts via its pleckstrin homology domain with phosphatidic acid, PtdIns3P, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 and to a lesser extent with PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns4P. Arabidopsis 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 is able to activate human protein kinase BÎ± (PKB/AKT) in the presence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Arabidopsis 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 is only the second plant protein reported to possess a pleckstrin homology domain and the first plant protein shown to bind 3-phosphoinositides.

The AGC kinase OsOxi1, which has been isolated as an interactor with OsPti1a, positively regulates basal disease resistance in rice. In eukaryotes, AGC kinase family proteins are regulated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (Pdk1). In Arabidopsis, AtPdk1 directly interacts with phosphatidic acid, which functions as a second messenger in both biotic and abiotic stress responses. However, the functions of Pdk1 are poorly understood in plants. We show here that OsPdk1 acts upstream of the OsOxi1-OsPti1a signal cascade in disease resistance in rice. OsPdk1 interacts with OsOxi1 and phosphorylates the Ser283 residue of OsOxi1 in vitro. To investigate whether OsPdk1 is involved in immunity that is triggered by microbial-associated molecular patterns, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of OsPdk1 in response to chitin elicitor. Like OsOxi1, OsPdk1 is rapidly phosphorylated in response to chitin elicitor, suggesting that OsPdk1 participates in signal transduction through pathogen recognition. The overexpression of OsPdk1 enhanced basal resistance against a blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, and a bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Taken together, these results suggest that OsPdk1 positively regulates basal disease resistance through the OsOxi1-OsPti1a phosphorylation cascade in rice.
