Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, is one of the most serious diseases of rice. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of Pib, one of the rice blast resistance genes. The Pib gene was isolated by a map-based cloning strategy. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Pib gene product contains a nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs); thus, Pib is a member of the NBS-LRR class of plant disease resistance genes. Interestingly, a duplication of the kinase 1a, 2 and 3a motifs of the NBS region was found in the N-terminal half of the Pib protein. In addition, eight cysteine residues are clustered in the middle of the LRRs, a feature which has not been reported for other R genes. Pib gene expression was induced upon altered environmental conditions, such as altered temperatures and darkness.

Couch) in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2010	Plant Breeding	International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), DAPO Box 7777, Metro Manila, Philippines	Gene pyramiding is considered one of the most effective strategies for achieving durable resistance against blast disease (Magnaporthe oryzae B. Couch) in rice (Oryza sativa L.), although few studies have evaluated the combining effect of the resistance genes. We report the development of pyramided lines with two major blast resistance genes, Pish and Pib, and the evaluation of the combining effect of them. The two genes pyramided lines were selected from the progenies of a cross between one near isogenic line (NIL), which harbours Pish, and another NIL, which harbours Pib, in the genetic background of blast susceptible variety, CO 39. The presence of the resistance genes was confirmed by DNA markers linked to them. To obtain DNA markers for Pish, we genetically mapped the Pish locus. We confirmed the additive effect of Pish and Pib in the pyramided lines by their reaction patterns to blast isolates, suggesting the potential availabilities of the combinations of these genes. In addition, we provide DNA markers linked to Pish for marker aided selection in rice blast resistance breeding.
