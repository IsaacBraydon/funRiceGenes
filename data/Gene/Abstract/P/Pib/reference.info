j.1365-313X.1999.00498.x.pdf	The Pib gene for rice blast resistance belongs to the nucleotide binding and leucine-rich repeat class of plant disease resistance genes	1999	The Plant Journal	Rice Genome Research Program, Institute of the Society for Techno-Innovation of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, is one of the most serious diseases of rice. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of Pib, one of the rice blast resistance genes. The Pib gene was isolated by a map-based cloning strategy. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Pib gene product contains a nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs); thus, Pib is a member of the NBS-LRR class of plant disease resistance genes. Interestingly, a duplication of the kinase 1a, 2 and 3a motifs of the NBS region was found in the N-terminal half of the Pib protein. In addition, eight cysteine residues are clustered in the middle of the LRRs, a feature which has not been reported for other R genes. Pib gene expression was induced upon altered environmental conditions, such as altered temperatures and darkness.
j.1439-0523.2010.01781.x.pdf	Development of pyramided lines with two resistance genes, Pish and Pib, for blast disease (Magnaporthe oryzae B. Couch) in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2010	Plant Breeding	International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), DAPO Box 7777, Metro Manila, Philippines	Gene pyramiding is considered one of the most effective strategies for achieving durable resistance against blast disease (Magnaporthe oryzae B. Couch) in rice (Oryza sativa L.), although few studies have evaluated the combining effect of the resistance genes. We report the development of pyramided lines with two major blast resistance genes, Pish and Pib, and the evaluation of the combining effect of them. The two genes pyramided lines were selected from the progenies of a cross between one near isogenic line (NIL), which harbours Pish, and another NIL, which harbours Pib, in the genetic background of blast susceptible variety, CO 39. The presence of the resistance genes was confirmed by DNA markers linked to them. To obtain DNA markers for Pish, we genetically mapped the Pish locus. We confirmed the additive effect of Pish and Pib in the pyramided lines by their reaction patterns to blast isolates, suggesting the potential availabilities of the combinations of these genes. In addition, we provide DNA markers linked to Pish for marker aided selection in rice blast resistance breeding.
NA	Function and evolution of Magnaporthe oryzae avirulence gene AvrPib responding to the rice blast resistance gene Pib.	2015	Sci Rep	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agrobioresurces, and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory for Microbe Signals and Crop Disease Control, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Magnaporthe oryzae (Mo) is the causative pathogen of the damaging disease rice blast. The effector gene AvrPib, which confers avirulence to host carrying resistance gene Pib, was isolated via map-based cloning. The gene encodes a 75-residue protein, which includes a signal peptide. Phenotyping and genotyping of 60 isolates from each of five geographically distinct Mo populations revealed that the frequency of virulent isolates, as well as the sequence diversity within the AvrPib gene increased from a low level in the far northeastern region of China to a much higher one in the southern region, indicating a process of host-driven selection. Resequencing of the AvrPiballele harbored by a set of 108 diverse isolates revealed that there were four pathoways, transposable element (TE) insertion (frequency 81.7%), segmental deletion (11.1%), complete absence (6.7%), and point mutation (0.6%), leading to loss of the avirulence function. The lack of any TE insertion in a sample of non-rice infecting Moisolates suggested that it occurred after the host specialization of Mo. Both the deletions and the functional point mutation were confined to the signal peptide. The reconstruction of 16 alleles confirmed seven functional nucleotide polymorphisms for the AvrPiballeles, which generated three distinct expression profiles.
