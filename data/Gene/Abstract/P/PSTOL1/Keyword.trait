PSTOL1	yield	The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency	 Here we show that overexpression of PSTOL1 in such varieties significantly enhances grain yield in phosphorus-deficient soil
PSTOL1	root	The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency	 Further analyses show that PSTOL1 acts as an enhancer of early root growth, thereby enabling plants to acquire more phosphorus and other nutrients
PSTOL1	phosphorus	The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency	 However, its functional mechanism remained elusive until the locus was sequenced, showing the presence of a Pup1-specific protein kinase gene, which we have named phosphorus-starvation tolerance 1 (PSTOL1)
PSTOL1	phosphorus	The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency	 Here we show that overexpression of PSTOL1 in such varieties significantly enhances grain yield in phosphorus-deficient soil

PSTOL1	phosphorus	The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency	The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency
PSTOL1	grain	The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency	 Here we show that overexpression of PSTOL1 in such varieties significantly enhances grain yield in phosphorus-deficient soil
PSTOL1	submergence	The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency	" The absence of PSTOL1 and other genes-for example, the submergence-tolerance gene SUB1A-from modern rice varieties underlines the importance of conserving and exploring traditional germplasm"
PSTOL1	growth	The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency	 Further analyses show that PSTOL1 acts as an enhancer of early root growth, thereby enabling plants to acquire more phosphorus and other nutrients

PSTOL1	tolerance	Phosphate acquisition efficiency and phosphate starvation tolerance locus (PSTOL1) in rice.	 Neither the presence of PSTOL1 gene nor its closely-linked SSR RM1261, showed any association with P-deficiency tolerance among the 108 genotypes
PSTOL1	tolerance	Phosphate acquisition efficiency and phosphate starvation tolerance locus (PSTOL1) in rice.	 Not only this, but the presence of PSTOL1 in recombinant inbred line (RIL) developed from a cross between Gobindabhog and Satabdi, also did not show any linkage with P-deficiency tolerance ability
PSTOL1	tolerance	Phosphate acquisition efficiency and phosphate starvation tolerance locus (PSTOL1) in rice.	 Thus, before considering PSTOL1 gene in MAB, its expression and role in P-deficiency tolerance in the donor parent must be ascertained
PSTOL1	root	Multiple interval QTL mapping and searching for PSTOL1 homologs associated with root morphology, biomass accumulation and phosphorus content in maize seedlings under low-P.	Multiple interval QTL mapping and searching for PSTOL1 homologs associated with root morphology, biomass accumulation and phosphorus content in maize seedlings under low-P.
PSTOL1	biomass	Multiple interval QTL mapping and searching for PSTOL1 homologs associated with root morphology, biomass accumulation and phosphorus content in maize seedlings under low-P.
