OsPHT1	PSTOL1	Trait variations and expression profiling of OsPHT1 gene family at the early growth-stages under phosphorus-limited conditions	To better understand the early response of genotypes to limited-phosphorus (P) conditions and the role of the phosphate transporter OsPHT1 gene family in the presence of PSTOL1, it is essential to characterize the level of tolerance in rice under limited-P conditions
