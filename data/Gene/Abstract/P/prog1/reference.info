The transition from the prostrate growth of ancestral wild rice (O. rufipogon Griff.) to the erect growth of Oryza sativa cultivars was one of the most critical events in rice domestication. This evolutionary step importantly improved plant architecture and increased grain yield. Here we find that prostrate growth of wild rice from Yuanjiang County in China is controlled by a semi-dominant gene, PROG1 (PROSTRATE GROWTH 1), on chromosome 7 that encodes a single Cys(2)-His(2) zinc-finger protein. prog1 variants identified in O. sativa disrupt the prog1 function and inactivate prog1 expression, leading to erect growth, greater grain number and higher grain yield in cultivated rice. Sequence comparison shows that 182 varieties of cultivated rice, including 87 indica and 95 japonica cultivars from 17 countries, carry identical mutations in the prog1 coding region that may have become fixed during rice domestication.

The closely related wild rice species Oryza rufipogon is considered the progenitor of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa). The transition from the characteristic plant architecture of wild rice to that of cultivated rice was one of the most important events in rice domestication; however, the molecular basis of this key domestication transition has not been elucidated. Here we show that the PROG1 gene controls aspects of wild-rice plant architecture, including tiller angle and number of tillers. The gene encodes a newly identified zinc-finger nuclear transcription factor with transcriptional activity and is mapped on chromosome 7. PROG1 is predominantly expressed in the axillary meristems, the site of tiller bud formation. Rice transformation experiments demonstrate that artificial selection of an amino acid substitution in the PROG1 protein during domestication led to the transition from the plant architecture of wild rice to that of domesticated rice.
NA	Evolution of Plant Architecture in Oryza Driven by the PROG1 Locus	2020	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Research Center for Perennial Rice Engineering and Technology of Yunnan, School of Agriculture, Yunnan University, Kunming, China.	The genetic control of plant architecture in crops is critical for agriculture and understanding morphological evolution. This study showed that an open reading frame (ORF) of the rice domestication gene PROG1 appeared 3.4-3.9 million years ago (Mya). Subsequently, it acquired a novel protein-coding gene function in the genome of O. rufipogon (~0.3-0.4 Mya). This extremely young gene and its paralogous C2H2 genes located nearby define the prostrate architecture of O. rufipogon and, thus, are of adaptive significance for wild rice in swamp and water areas. However, selection for dense planting and high yield during rice domestication silenced the PROG1 gene and caused the loss of the RPAD locus containing functional C2H2 paralogs; hence, domesticated lines exhibit an erect plant architecture. Analysis of the stepwise origination process of PROG1 and its evolutionary genetics revealed that this zinc-finger coding gene may have rapidly evolved under positive selection and promoted the transition from non- or semi-prostrate growth to prostrate growth. A transgenic assay showed that PROG1 from O. rufipogon exerts a stronger function compared with PROG1 sequences from other Oryza species. However, the analysis of the expression levels of PROG1 in different Oryza species suggests that the transcriptional regulation of PROG1 has played an important role in its evolution. This study provides the first strong case showing how a fundamental morphological trait evolved in Oryza species driven by a gene locus.
