prog1	meristem	Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication	PROG1 is predominantly expressed in the axillary meristems, the site of tiller bud formation
prog1	domestication	Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication	Sequence comparison shows that 182 varieties of cultivated rice, including 87 indica and 95 japonica cultivars from 17 countries, carry identical mutations in the prog1 coding region that may have become fixed during rice domestication
prog1	domestication	Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication	Rice transformation experiments demonstrate that artificial selection of an amino acid substitution in the PROG1 protein during domestication led to the transition from the plant architecture of wild rice to that of domesticated rice
prog1	tiller	Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication	Here we show that the PROG1 gene controls aspects of wild-rice plant architecture, including tiller angle and number of tillers
prog1	tiller	Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication	PROG1 is predominantly expressed in the axillary meristems, the site of tiller bud formation
prog1	growth	Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication	Here we find that prostrate growth of wild rice from Yuanjiang County in China is controlled by a semi-dominant gene, PROG1 (PROSTRATE GROWTH 1), on chromosome 7 that encodes a single Cys(2)-His(2) zinc-finger protein
prog1	growth	Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication	sativa disrupt the prog1 function and inactivate prog1 expression, leading to erect growth, greater grain number and higher grain yield in cultivated rice
prog1	grain	Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication	sativa disrupt the prog1 function and inactivate prog1 expression, leading to erect growth, greater grain number and higher grain yield in cultivated rice
prog1	tiller angle	Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication	Here we show that the PROG1 gene controls aspects of wild-rice plant architecture, including tiller angle and number of tillers
prog1	erect	Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication	sativa disrupt the prog1 function and inactivate prog1 expression, leading to erect growth, greater grain number and higher grain yield in cultivated rice
prog1	grain yield	Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication	sativa disrupt the prog1 function and inactivate prog1 expression, leading to erect growth, greater grain number and higher grain yield in cultivated rice
prog1	axillary meristem	Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication	PROG1 is predominantly expressed in the axillary meristems, the site of tiller bud formation
prog1	prostrate	Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication	Here we find that prostrate growth of wild rice from Yuanjiang County in China is controlled by a semi-dominant gene, PROG1 (PROSTRATE GROWTH 1), on chromosome 7 that encodes a single Cys(2)-His(2) zinc-finger protein
prog1	yield	Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication	sativa disrupt the prog1 function and inactivate prog1 expression, leading to erect growth, greater grain number and higher grain yield in cultivated rice
prog1	grain number	Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication	sativa disrupt the prog1 function and inactivate prog1 expression, leading to erect growth, greater grain number and higher grain yield in cultivated rice
prog1	architecture	Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication	Here we show that the PROG1 gene controls aspects of wild-rice plant architecture, including tiller angle and number of tillers
