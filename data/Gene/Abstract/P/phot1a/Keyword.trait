phot1a	seedling	Rice phot1a mutation reduces plant growth by affecting photosynthetic responses to light during early seedling growth	Rice phot1a mutation reduces plant growth by affecting photosynthetic responses to light during early seedling growth
phot1a	growth	Rice phot1a mutation reduces plant growth by affecting photosynthetic responses to light during early seedling growth	 When phot1a mutants were grown under WL (100) and BL (40 miccromol m(-2) s(-1)), they demonstrated a considerable reduction in photosynthetic capacity, which included decreased leaf CO(2) uptake and plant growth
phot1a	growth	Rice phot1a mutation reduces plant growth by affecting photosynthetic responses to light during early seedling growth	 We conclude that the defect of Os Phot1a affects degradation of chlorophylls and carotenoids, and under photosynthetically active photon fluxes, mutation of phot1a results in loss of photosynthetic capacity owing to the damage of photosystems caused by elevated H(2)O(2) accumulation, leading to a reduction in plant growth
