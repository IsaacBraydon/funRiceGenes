PTC2	pollen	PERSISTENT TAPETAL CELL 2 is required for normal tapetal programmed cell death and pollen wall patterning.	 ptc2 showed persistent tapetal cells and abnormal pollen wall patterning including absent nexine, collapsed bacula and disordered tectum
PTC2	pollen	PERSISTENT TAPETAL CELL 2 is required for normal tapetal programmed cell death and pollen wall patterning.	 The defective tapetal PCD phenotype of ptc2 was similar to that of a PCD delayed mutant, ptc1, in rice, while the abnormal pollen wall patterning resembled that of a pollen wall defective mutant, tek, in Arabidopsis thaliana
PTC2	pollen	PERSISTENT TAPETAL CELL 2 is required for normal tapetal programmed cell death and pollen wall patterning.	 Based on these data, we propose a model explaining how PTC2 affects anther and pollen development
PTC2	pollen	PERSISTENT TAPETAL CELL 2 is required for normal tapetal programmed cell death and pollen wall patterning.	 The characterization of PTC2 in tapetal PCD and pollen wall patterning expands our understanding of the regulatory network of male reproductive development in rice and will aid future breeding approaches
