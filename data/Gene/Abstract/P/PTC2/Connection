PTC1|OsMS1	PTC2	PERSISTENT TAPETAL CELL 2 is required for normal tapetal programmed cell death and pollen wall patterning.	 The defective tapetal PCD phenotype of ptc2 was similar to that of a PCD delayed mutant, ptc1, in rice, while the abnormal pollen wall patterning resembled that of a pollen wall defective mutant, tek, in Arabidopsis thaliana
