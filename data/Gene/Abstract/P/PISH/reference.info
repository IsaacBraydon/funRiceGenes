Miah-2013-Blast resistance in.pdf	Blast resistance in rice: a review of conventional breeding to molecular approaches	2013	Mol Biol Rep	Laboratory of Food Crops, Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), 43400, UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.	Blast disease caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae is the most severe diseases of rice. Using classical plant breeding techniques, breeders have developed a number of blast resistant cultivars adapted to different rice growing regions worldwide. However, the rice industry remains threatened by blast disease due to the instability of blast fungus. Recent advances in rice genomics provide additional tools for plant breeders to improve rice production systems that would be environmentally friendly. This article outlines the application of conventional breeding, tissue culture and DNA-based markers that are used for accelerating the development of blast resistant rice cultivars. The best way for controlling the disease is to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative genes in resistant variety. Through conventional and molecular breeding many blast-resistant varieties have been developed. Conventional breeding for disease resistance is tedious, time consuming and mostly dependent on environment as compare to molecular breeding particularly marker assisted selection, which is easier, highly efficient and precise. For effective management of blast disease, breeding work should be focused on utilizing the broad spectrum of resistance genes and pyramiding genes and quantitative trait loci. Marker assisted selection provides potential solution to some of the problems that conventional breeding cannot resolve. In recent years, blast resistant genes have introgressed into Luhui 17, G46B, Zhenshan 97B, Jin 23B, CO39, IR50, Pusa1602 and Pusa1603 lines through marker assisted selection. Introduction of exotic genes for resistance induced the occurrence of new races of blast fungus, therefore breeding work should be concentrated in local resistance genes. This review focuses on the conventional breeding to the latest molecular progress in blast disease resistance in rice. This update information will be helpful guidance for rice breeders to develop durable blast resistant rice variety through marker assisted selection.
Nguyen-2006-Pi35(t), a new gene.pdf	Pi35(t), a new gene conferring partial resistance to leaf blast in the rice cultivar Hokkai 188	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Fungal Disease Laboratory, Department of Plant Pathology, National Agricultural Research Organization, Kannondai 3-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8666, Japan.	The japonica rice cultivar Hokkai 188 shows a high level of partial resistance to leaf blast. For mapping genes conferring the resistance, a set of 190 F2 progeny/F3 families was developed from the cross between the indica rice cultivar Danghang-Shali, with a low level of partial resistance, and Hokkai 188. Partial resistance to leaf blast in the F3 families was assessed in upland nurseries. From a primary microsatellite (SSR) linkage map and QTL analysis using a subset of 126 F2 progeny/F3 families randomly selected from the above set, one major QTL located on chromosome 1 was detected in the vicinity of SSR marker RM1216. This QTL was responsible for 69.4% of the phenotypic variation, and Hokkai 188 contributed the resistance allele. Segregation analysis in the F3 families for partial resistance to leaf blast was in agreement with the existence of a major gene, and the gene was designated as Pi35(t). Another QTL detected on chromosome 8 was minor, explained 13.4% of the phenotypic variation, and an allele of Danghang-Shali increased the level of resistance in this QTL. Additional SSR markers of the targeted Pi35(t) region were further surveyed in the 190 F2 plants, and Pi35(t) was placed in a 3.5-cM interval flanked by markers RM1216 and RM1003.
Takahashi-2007-Rice Pti1a negativel.pdf	Rice Pti1a negatively regulates RAR1-dependent defense responses	2007	Plant Cell	Department of Molecular Genetics, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Pto encodes a protein kinase that confers resistance to bacterial speck disease. A second protein kinase, Pti1, physically interacts with Pto and is involved in Pto-mediated defense signaling. Pti1-related sequences are highly conserved among diverse plant species, including rice (Oryza sativa), but their functions are largely unknown. Here, we report the identification of a null mutant for the Pti1 homolog in rice and the functional characterization of Os Pti1a. The rice pti1a mutant was characterized by spontaneous necrotic lesions on leaves, which was accompanied by a series of defense responses and resistance against a compatible race of Magnaporthe grisea. Overexpression of Pti1a in rice reduced resistance against an incompatible race of the fungus recognized by a resistance (R) protein, Pish. Plants overexpressing Pti1a were also more susceptible to a compatible race of the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. These results suggest that Os Pti1a negatively regulates defense signaling for both R gene-mediated and basal resistance. We also demonstrated that repression of the rice RAR1 gene suppressed defense responses induced in the pti1a mutant, indicating that Pti1a negatively regulates RAR1-dependent defense responses. Expression of a tomato Pti1 cDNA in the rice pti1a mutant suppressed the mutant phenotypes. This contrasts strikingly with the previous finding that Sl Pti1 enhances Pto-mediated hypersensitive response (HR) induction when expressed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), suggesting that the molecular switch controlling HR downstream of pathogen recognition has evolved differently in rice and tomato.
Takahashi-2010-Unique features of t.pdf	Unique features of the rice blast resistance Pish locus revealed by large scale retrotransposon-tagging	2010	BMC Plant Biol	Division of Genome and Biodiversity Research, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Ibaraki, 305-8602, Japan.	BACKGROUND: R gene-mediated resistance is one of the most effective mechanisms of immunity against pathogens in plants. To date some components that regulate the primary steps of plant immunity have been isolated, however, the molecular dissection of defense signaling downstream of the R proteins remains to be completed. In addition, R genes are known to be highly variable, however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this variability remain obscure. RESULTS: To identify novel factors required for R gene-mediated resistance in rice, we used rice insertional mutant lines, induced by the endogenous retrotransposon Tos17, in a genetic screening involving the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. We inoculated 41,119 mutant lines with the fungus using a high throughput procedure, and identified 86 mutant lines with diminished resistance. A genome analysis revealed that 72 of the 86 lines contained mutations in a gene encoding a nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain-containing (NBS-LRR) protein. A genetic complementation analysis and a pathogenesis assay demonstrated that this NBS-LRR gene encodes Pish, which confers resistance against races of M. oryzae containing avrPish. The other 14 lines have intact copies of the Pish gene, suggesting that they may contain mutations in the signaling components downstream of Pish. The genome analysis indicated that Pish and its neighboring three NBS-LRR genes are high similar to one another and are tandemly located. An in silico analysis of a Tos17 flanking sequence database revealed that this region is a "hot spot" for insertion. Intriguingly, the insertion sites are not distributed evenly among these four NBS-LRR genes, despite their similarity at the sequence and expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: In this work we isolated the R gene Pish, and identified several other mutants involved in the signal transduction required for Pish-mediated resistance. These results indicate that our genetic approach is efficient and useful for unveiling novel aspects of defense signaling in rice. Furthermore, our data provide experimental evidence that R gene clusters have the potential to be highly preferred targets for transposable element insertions in plant genomes. Based on this finding, a possible mechanism underlying the high variability of R genes is discussed.
Zhu-2004-Identification and c.pdf	Identification and characterization of a new blast resistance gene located on rice chromosome 1 through linkage and differential analyses	2004	Phytopathology	None	The Chinese native cv. Q14 expresses a high level of resistance to many isolates of Pyricularia grisea collected from Japan, Thailand, and China. Q14 was crossed to an indica-susceptible cultivar, Q61 . To rapidly determine the chromosomal location of the major resistance gene present in the cultivar, a linkage analysis using microsatellite markers was performed in the F-2 population segregating 3R:1S (resistant/susceptible) through bulked-segregant analysis (BSA) in combination with recessive-class analysis (RCA). A total of 189 microsatellite markers selected from each chromosome equally (with approximate to10 centimorgans) were tested with the BSA approach. Only two markers. RM151 and RM259, located on chromosome 1 showed positive and negative polymorphisms, respectively, for a resistance gene segregating in the population. To confirm the polymorphic markers, a total of 155 viable susceptible individuals were tested with the RCA approach. The markers RM151 and RM259 were found to link to the resistance gene with recombination frequencies of 11.9 +/- 2.8% and 9.7 +/- 8.0%, respectively. For further characterization of the resistance gene, 3 resistance genes mapped on chromosome 1, as well as 15 major resistance genes that might be employed in the breeding program, were selected for differential tests with 85 Chinese isolates. The resistance gene identified in this research conveys reactions distinct front those conditioned by the 18 resistance genes. This new resistance gene tentatively was designated Pi27(t).
