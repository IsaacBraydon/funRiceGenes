Box 933, Manila, Philippines e-mail: maslab@satyam.net.in, PH	Three major genes (Pi1, Piz-5 and Pita) for blast resistance on chromosomes 11, 6 and 12, respectively, were fine-mapped and closely linked RFLP markers identified. New markers for Pi1 and Pita were found that were flanking the genes. The three genes were pyramided using RFLP markers. A PCR-based SAP (sequence amplified polymorphism) marker was used to identify Piz-5 in the segregating population. The plants carrying the two- and three-gene combinations that were tested for resistance to leaf blast in the Philippines and India indicated that combinations including Piz-5 have enhanced resistance than when it is present alone. The genes from the pyramided lines are at present being deployed into agronomically superior ricevarieties by marker-aided selection (MAS).

Rice blast is one of the important diseases of rice which can be effectively managed by the deployment of resistance genes. Pi-ta is one of the major blast resistant genes effective against pathogen populations in different parts of India. We analysed allelic variants of Pi-ta from 48 rice lines selected after phenotyping of 529 rice landraces across three eco-geographical blast hot spot regions. Besides, Pi-ta orthologue sequences of 220 rice accessions belonging to wild and cultivated species of rice were also included in the study for a better evo-devo perspective of the diversity present in the gene and the selection pressures acting on this locus. We obtained high nucleotide variations (SNPs and insertion-deletions) in the intronic region. We also identified 64 haplotypes based on nucleotide polymorphism in these alleles. Pi-ta orthologues of Indian landraces were scattered in eight major haplotypes indicating its heterogenous nature. We identified a total of 47 different Pi-ta protein variants on the basis of deduced amino acid residues amongst the orthologues. Five unique and novel Pi-ta variants were identified for the first time in rice landraces exhibiting different reaction types against the Magnaporthe oryzae population. A high value of Pi(non/syn) was observed only in the leucine-rich domain of the alleles cloned from Indian landraces, indicating strong selective forces acting on this region. The detailed molecular analysis of the Pi-ta orthologues provides insights to a high degree of inter- and intraspecific relationships amongst the Oryza species. We identified rice landraces possessing the effective alleles of this resistance gene which can be used in future blast resistance breeding programmes.
4004.full.pdf	Direct interaction of resistance gene and avirulence gene products confers rice blast resistance	2000	EMBO J	DuPont Agricultural Products, PO Box 80402, Wilmington, DE 19880-0402, USA.	Rice expressing the Pi-ta gene is resistant to strains of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea, expressing AVR-Pita in a gene-for-gene relationship. Pi-ta encodes a putative cytoplasmic receptor with a centrally localized nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich domain (LRD) at the C-terminus. AVR-Pita is predicted to encode a metalloprotease with an N-terminal secretory signal and pro-protein sequences. AVR-Pita(176) lacks the secretory and pro-protein sequences. We report here that transient expression of AVR-Pita(176) inside plant cells results in a Pi-ta-dependent resistance response. AVR-Pita(176) protein is shown to bind specifically to the LRD of the Pi-ta protein, both in the yeast two-hybrid system and in an in vitro binding assay. Single amino acid substitutions in the Pi-ta LRD or in the AVR-Pita(176) protease motif that result in loss of resistance in the plant also disrupt the physical interaction, both in yeast and in vitro. These data suggest that the AVR-Pita(176) protein binds directly to the Pi-ta LRD region inside the plant cell to initiate a Pi-ta-mediated defense response.
GEN17931527.pdf	Molecular evolution of the Pi-ta gene resistant to rice blast in wild rice (Oryza rufipogon)	2008	Genetics	Institute of Plant Biology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan.	Rice blast disease resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea is triggered by a physical interaction between the protein products of the host R (resistance) gene, Pi-ta, and the pathogen Avr (avirulence) gene, AVR-pita. The genotype variation and resistant/susceptible phenotype at the Pi-ta locus of wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), the ancestor of cultivated rice (O. sativa), was surveyed in 36 locations worldwide to study the molecular evolution and functional adaptation of the Pi-ta gene. The low nucleotide polymorphism of the Pi-ta gene of O. rufipogon was similar to that of O. sativa, but greatly differed from what has been reported for other O. rufipogon genes. The haplotypes can be subdivided into two divergent haplogroups named H1 and H2. H1 is derived from H2, with nearly no variation and at a low frequency. H2 is common and is the ancestral form. The leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain has a high pi(non)/pi(syn) ratio, and the low polymorphism of the Pi-ta gene might have primarily been caused by recurrent selective sweep and constraint by other putative physiological functions. Meanwhile, we provide data to show that the amino acid Ala-918 of H1 in the LRR domain has a close relationship with the resistant phenotype. H1 might have recently arisen during rice domestication and may be associated with the scenario of a blast pathogen-host shift from Italian millet to rice.
IND23308655.pdf	Development of Dominant Rice Blast Resistance Gene Markers	2002	Crop Science	USDA-ARS, Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center, P. O. Box 1090, Stuttgart, AR 72160-0287	Incorporation of resistance genes into existing rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars is a powerful strategy and is commonly applied in breeding rice resistance to blast disease [caused by Pyricularia grisea Sacc. = P. oryzae Cavara (teleomorph: Magnaporthe grisea (Hebert) Barr)]. The rice blast resistance gene, Pi-ta, originally introgressed into japonica from indica rice is important in breeding for rice blast resistance worldwide. In the southern USA, the rice cultivar Katy contains Pi-ta and is resistant to the predominant blast M. grisea races IB-49 and IC-17 and has been used as the blast resistant breeding parent. Three pairs of DNA primers specific to the dominant indica Pi-ta gene were designed to amplify the Pi-ta DNA fragments by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR products amplified by these Pi-ta specific primers were cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis confirmed the presence of the dominant indica Pi-ta allele. These Pi-ta primers were used to examine the presence of Pi-ta alleles in advanced Arkansas rice breeding lines. The Pi-ta containing rice lines, as determined by PCR analysis, were resistant to both IB-49 and IC-17 in standard pathogenicity assays. In contrast, lines lacking the Pi-ta genes failed to protect rice plants against both races IB-49 and IC-17. The presence of Pi-ta markers correlated with the Pi-ta resistance spectrum. Thus, the Pi-ta gene markers provide a basis for stacking other blast resistance genes into high yielding and good quality advanced breeding rice lines.

In the present study, 1790 accessions were characterized for Pi-ta, and Pi-ta independent resistance genes using marker analysis, disease evaluation with the race IB-49 carrying AVR-Pita, and IE-1k not carrying AVR-Pita and sequence analysis. A total of 183 accessions were identified using a Pi-ta-indel marker from the intron region. Sequence analysis revealed that resistance functional nucleotide polymorphism (FNP) was present in 163 accessions including reference cultivars. Among them, 89 were resistant to IB-49 and susceptible to IE-1k indicating that these accessions contain Pi-ta R alleles. Four accessions were susceptible to IB-49 suggesting that components were not intact in Pi-ta-mediated resistance. In contrast, 14 accessions with the susceptible FNP were resistant to IB-49 suggesting these 14 accessions may contain Pi-ta independent new R genes. Together, 83 accessions were identified to contain new R gene to IE-1k. These accessions were genetically distinct determined by simple sequence repeat markers. The results could impact breeding for blast resistance worldwide.
journal.pone.0026260.pdf	Molecular evolution of the rice blast resistance gene Pi-ta in invasive weedy rice in the USA	2011	PLoS One	Rice Research Extension Center, University of Arkansas, Stuttgart, Arkansas, United States of America.	The Pi-ta gene in rice has been effectively used to control rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae worldwide. Despite a number of studies that reported the Pi-ta gene in domesticated rice and wild species, little is known about how the Pi-ta gene has evolved in US weedy rice, a major weed of rice. To investigate the genome organization of the Pi-ta gene in weedy rice and its relationship to gene flow between cultivated and weedy rice in the US, we analyzed nucleotide sequence variation at the Pi-ta gene and its surrounding 2 Mb region in 156 weedy, domesticated and wild rice relatives. We found that the region at and around the Pi-ta gene shows very low genetic diversity in US weedy rice. The patterns of molecular diversity in weeds are more similar to cultivated rice (indica and aus), which have never been cultivated in the US, rather than the wild rice species, Oryza rufipogon. In addition, the resistant Pi-ta allele (Pi-ta) found in the majority of US weedy rice belongs to the weedy group strawhull awnless (SH), suggesting a single source of origin for Pi-ta. Weeds with Pi-ta were resistant to two M. oryzae races, IC17 and IB49, except for three accessions, suggesting that component(s) required for the Pi-ta mediated resistance may be missing in these accessions. Signatures of flanking sequences of the Pi-ta gene and SSR markers on chromosome 12 suggest that the susceptible pi-ta allele (pi-ta), not Pi-ta, has been introgressed from cultivated to weedy rice by out-crossing.
MPMI-21-4-0396.pdf	Identification of a new locus, Ptr(t), required for rice blast resistance gene Pi-ta-mediated resistance	2008	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	United States Department of Agriculture-Agriculture Research Service, Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center, Stuttgart, AR 72160, USA. Yulin.Jia@ars.usda.gov	Resistance to the blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae is proposed to be initiated by physical binding of a putative cytoplasmic receptor encoded by a nucleotide binding site-type resistance gene, Pi-ta, to the processed elicitor encoded by the corresponding avirulence gene AVR-Pita. Here, we report the identification of a new locus, Ptr(t), that is required for Pi-ta-mediated signal recognition. A Pi-ta-expressing susceptible mutant was identified using a genetic screen. Putative mutations at Ptr(t) do not alter recognition specificity to another resistance gene, Pi-k(s), in the Pi-ta homozygote, indicating that Ptr(t) is more likely specific to Pi-ta-mediated signal recognition. Genetic crosses of Pi-ta Ptr(t) and Pi-ta ptr(t) homozygotes suggest that Ptr(t) segregates as a single dominant nuclear gene. A ratio of 1:1 (resistant/susceptible) of a population of BC1 of Pi-ta Ptr(t) with pi-ta ptr(t) homozygotes indicates that Pi-ta and Ptr(t) are linked and cosegregate. Genotyping of mutants of pi-ta ptr(t) and Pi-ta Ptr(t) homozygotes using ten simple sequence repeat markers at the Pi-ta region determined that Pi-ta and Ptr(t) are located within a 9-megabase region and are of indica origin. Identification of Ptr(t) is a significant advancement in studying Pi-ta-mediated signal recognition and transduction.
Plant Cell-2000-Bryan-2033-45.pdf	tA single amino acid difference distinguishes resistant and susceptible alleles of the rice blast resistance gene Pi-ta	2000	Plant Cell	DuPont Agricultural Products, P.O. Box 80402, Wilmington, Delaware 19880-0402, USA.	The rice blast resistance (R) gene Pi-ta mediates gene-for-gene resistance against strains of the fungus Magnaporthe grisea that express avirulent alleles of AVR-Pita. Using a map-based cloning strategy, we cloned Pi-ta, which is linked to the centromere of chromosome 12. Pi-ta encodes a predicted 928-amino acid cytoplasmic receptor with a centrally localized nucleotide binding site. A single-copy gene, Pi-ta shows low constitutive expression in both resistant and susceptible rice. Susceptible rice varieties contain pi-ta(-) alleles encoding predicted proteins that share a single amino acid difference relative to the Pi-ta resistance protein: serine instead of alanine at position 918. Transient expression in rice cells of a Pi-ta(+) R gene together with AVR-Pita(+) induces a resistance response. No resistance response is induced in transient assays that use a naturally occurring pi-ta(-) allele differing only by the serine at position 918. Rice varieties reported to have the linked Pi-ta(2) gene contain Pi-ta plus at least one other R gene, potentially explaining the broadened resistance spectrum of Pi-ta(2) relative to Pi-ta. Molecular cloning of the AVR-Pita and Pi-ta genes will aid in deployment of R genes for effective genetic control of rice blast disease.
NA	Statistical Inference of Selection and Divergence of the Rice Blast Resistance Gene Pi-ta	2014	G3 (Bethesda)	Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada.	The resistance gene Pi-ta has been effectively used to control rice blast disease, but some populations of cultivated and wild rice have evolved resistance. Insights into the evolutionary processes that led to this resistance during crop domestication may be inferred from the population history of domesticated and wild rice strains. In this study, we applied a recently developed statistical method, time-dependent Poisson random field model, to examine the evolution of the Pi-ta gene in cultivated and weedy rice. Our study suggests that the Pi-ta gene may have more recently introgressed into cultivated rice, indica and japonica, and U.S. weedy rice from the wild species, O. rufipogon. In addition, the Pi-ta gene is under positive selection in japonica, tropical japonica, U.S. cultivars and U.S. weedy rice. We also found that sequences of two domains of the Pi-ta gene, the nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeat domain, are highly conserved among all rice accessions examined. Our results provide a valuable analytical tool for understanding the evolution of disease resistance genes in crop plants.
