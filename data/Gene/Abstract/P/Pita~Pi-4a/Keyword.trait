Pita|Pi-4a	blast disease	Molecular evolution of the Pi-ta gene resistant to rice blast in wild rice (Oryza rufipogon)	Rice blast disease resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea is triggered by a physical interaction between the protein products of the host R (resistance) gene, Pi-ta, and the pathogen Avr (avirulence) gene, AVR-pita
Pita|Pi-4a	blast	Identification of a new locus, Ptr(t), required for rice blast resistance gene Pi-ta-mediated resistance	Resistance to the blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae is proposed to be initiated by physical binding of a putative cytoplasmic receptor encoded by a nucleotide binding site-type resistance gene, Pi-ta, to the processed elicitor encoded by the corresponding avirulence gene AVR-Pita
Pita|Pi-4a	blast	Direct interaction of resistance gene and avirulence gene products confers rice blast resistance	Rice expressing the Pi-ta gene is resistant to strains of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea, expressing AVR-Pita in a gene-for-gene relationship
Pita|Pi-4a	blast resistance	tA single amino acid difference distinguishes resistant and susceptible alleles of the rice blast resistance gene Pi-ta	The rice blast resistance (R) gene Pi-ta mediates gene-for-gene resistance against strains of the fungus Magnaporthe grisea that express avirulent alleles of AVR-Pita
Pita|Pi-4a	blast resistance	Fine mapping and DNA marker-assisted pyramiding of the three major genes for blast resistance in rice	Three major genes (Pi1, Piz-5 and Pita) for blast resistance on chromosomes 11, 6 and 12, respectively, were fine-mapped and closely linked RFLP markers identified
