PR1b	pathogen	Identification of a small set of genes commonly regulated in rice roots in response to beneficial rhizobacteria	 Interestingly, exposure to a rice bacterial pathogen also triggered the expression of OsDXS3 while the expression of Os02g0582900 and PR1b was down-regulated, suggesting that these genes might play a key role in rice-bacteria interactions
