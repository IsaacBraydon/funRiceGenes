PBI1	transcription factor	Cooperative regulation of PBI1 and MAPKs controls WRKY45 transcription factor in rice immunity.	Cooperative regulation of PBI1 and MAPKs controls WRKY45 transcription factor in rice immunity.
PBI1	Kinase	Cooperative regulation of PBI1 and MAPKs controls WRKY45 transcription factor in rice immunity.	 In addition, chitin-induced MAP kinase activation is required for WRKY45 activation and PBI1 degradation
PBI1	kinase	Cooperative regulation of PBI1 and MAPKs controls WRKY45 transcription factor in rice immunity.	 In addition, chitin-induced MAP kinase activation is required for WRKY45 activation and PBI1 degradation
PBI1	transcriptional activator	Cooperative regulation of PBI1 and MAPKs controls WRKY45 transcription factor in rice immunity.	 PBI1 also interacts with WRKY45, a master transcriptional activator of rice immunity, and negatively regulates its activity
PBI1	chitin signaling	Cooperative regulation of PBI1 and MAPKs controls WRKY45 transcription factor in rice immunity.	 These data suggest that PBI1 suppresses WRKY45 activity when cells are in an unelicited state, and during chitin signaling, PUB44-mediated degradation of PBI1 leads to activation of WRKY45
