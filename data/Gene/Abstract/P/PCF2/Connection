PCF1	PCF2|OsPCF2	PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene	The two DNA binding proteins, designated PCF1 and PCF2, share > 70% homology in common conserved sequences at the N-terminal regions
PCF1	PCF2|OsPCF2	PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene	The motif is > 70% homologous to several expressed sequence tags from Arabidopsis and rice, suggesting that PCF1 and PCF2 are members of a novel family of proteins that are conserved in monocotyledons and dicotyledons
PCF1	PCF2|OsPCF2	PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene	PCF1 and PCF2 were also more likely to form heterodimers than homodimers
PCF1	PCF2|OsPCF2	PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene	Our results suggest that PCF1 and PCF2 are involved in meristematic tissue-specific expression of the rice PCNA gene through binding to sites IIa and IIb and formation of homodimers or heterodimers
