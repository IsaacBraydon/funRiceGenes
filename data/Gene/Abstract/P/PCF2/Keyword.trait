PCF2|OsPCF2	meristem	PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene	A supershift assay using an anti-PCF2 antibody showed the involvement of PCF2 in site IIa (site IIb) binding activities in rice nuclear extracts, particularly in meristematic tissues
PCF2|OsPCF2	meristem	PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene	Our results suggest that PCF1 and PCF2 are involved in meristematic tissue-specific expression of the rice PCNA gene through binding to sites IIa and IIb and formation of homodimers or heterodimers
