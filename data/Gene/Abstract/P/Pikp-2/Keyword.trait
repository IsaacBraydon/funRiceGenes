Pikp-2	blast resistance	The Pik-p resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice is mediated by a pair of closely linked CC-NBS-LRR genes	The Pik-p resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice is mediated by a pair of closely linked CC-NBS-LRR genes
Pikp-2	cell death	The rice NLR pair Pikp-1/Pikp-2 initiates cell death through receptor cooperation rather than negative regulation	 Further, expression of individual Pikp-1 or Pikp-2 domains did not result in cell death
Pikp-2	cell death	The rice NLR pair Pikp-1/Pikp-2 initiates cell death through receptor cooperation rather than negative regulation	 Mutations in the conserved P-loop and MHD sequence motifs in both Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 prevented cell death activation, demonstrating that these motifs are required for the function of the two partner NLRs
