Pikp-1	Pikp-2	The Pik-p resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice is mediated by a pair of closely linked CC-NBS-LRR genes	Both Pikp-1 (KP3) and Pikp-2 (KP4) encode coiled-coil NBS-LRR proteins and share, respectively, 95 and 99% peptide identity with the two alleles, Pikm1-TS and Pikm2-TS
Pikp-1	Pikp-2	The Pik-p resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice is mediated by a pair of closely linked CC-NBS-LRR genes	The Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 sequences share only limited homology
Pikp-1	Pikp-2	The Pik-p resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice is mediated by a pair of closely linked CC-NBS-LRR genes	Both Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 were constitutively expressed in cv
Pikp-1	Pikp-2	The rice NLR pair Pikp-1/Pikp-2 initiates cell death through receptor cooperation rather than negative regulation	 We found that any domain truncation, in either Pikp-1 or Pikp-2, prevented cell death in the presence of AVR-PikD, revealing that all domains are required for activity
Pikp-1	Pikp-2	The rice NLR pair Pikp-1/Pikp-2 initiates cell death through receptor cooperation rather than negative regulation	 Further, expression of individual Pikp-1 or Pikp-2 domains did not result in cell death
Pikp-1	Pikp-2	The rice NLR pair Pikp-1/Pikp-2 initiates cell death through receptor cooperation rather than negative regulation	 Mutations in the conserved P-loop and MHD sequence motifs in both Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 prevented cell death activation, demonstrating that these motifs are required for the function of the two partner NLRs
Pikp-1	Pikp-2	The rice NLR pair Pikp-1/Pikp-2 initiates cell death through receptor cooperation rather than negative regulation	 Finally, we showed that Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 associate to form homo- and hetero-complexes in planta in the absence of AVR-PikD; on co-expression the effector binds to Pikp-1 generating a tri-partite complex
Pikp-1	Pikp-2	The rice NLR pair Pikp-1/Pikp-2 initiates cell death through receptor cooperation rather than negative regulation	 Taken together, we provide evidence that Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 form a fine-tuned system that is activated by AVR-PikD via receptor cooperation rather than negative regulation
