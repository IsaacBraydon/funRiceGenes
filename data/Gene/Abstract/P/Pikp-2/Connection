Pikp-1	Pikp-2	The Pik-p resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice is mediated by a pair of closely linked CC-NBS-LRR genes	 Both Pikp-1 (KP3) and Pikp-2 (KP4) encode coiled-coil NBS-LRR proteins and share, respectively, 95 and 99% peptide identity with the two alleles, Pikm1-TS and Pikm2-TS| The Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 sequences share only limited homology| Both Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 were constitutively expressed in cv
