PLA3|OsLBD3-7	seed	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	However, in contrast to pla1 and pla2, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology
PLA3|OsLBD3-7	homeostasis	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	Consistent with these pleiotropic phenotypes, PLA3 is expressed in the whole plant body, and is involved in plant hormone homeostasis
PLA3|OsLBD3-7	leaf	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	Here we report the identification of the rice gene PLASTOCHRON3 (PLA3)/GOLIATH (GO) that regulates various developmental processes including the rate of leaf initiation (the plastochron)
PLA3|OsLBD3-7	leaf	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase

PLA3|OsLBD3-7	shoot	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase
PLA3|OsLBD3-7	reproductive	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase
PLA3|OsLBD3-7	leaf	OsLBD3-7 Overexpression Induced Adaxially Rolled Leaves in Rice.	Microscopy of flag leaf cross-sections indicated that overexpression of OsLBD3-7 led to a decrease in both bulliform cell size and number
PLA3|OsLBD3-7	leaf	OsLBD3-7 Overexpression Induced Adaxially Rolled Leaves in Rice.	These results indicated that OsLBD3-7 might acts as an upstream regulatory gene of bulliform cell development to regulate leaf rolling, which will give more insights on the leaf rolling regulation mechanism
PLA3|OsLBD3-7	development	OsLBD3-7 Overexpression Induced Adaxially Rolled Leaves in Rice.	These results indicated that OsLBD3-7 might acts as an upstream regulatory gene of bulliform cell development to regulate leaf rolling, which will give more insights on the leaf rolling regulation mechanism
PLA3|OsLBD3-7	nucleus	OsLBD3-7 Overexpression Induced Adaxially Rolled Leaves in Rice.	OsLBD3-7 works as a transcription activator and its protein is located on the plasma membrane and in the nucleus
PLA3|OsLBD3-7	plasma membrane	OsLBD3-7 Overexpression Induced Adaxially Rolled Leaves in Rice.	OsLBD3-7 works as a transcription activator and its protein is located on the plasma membrane and in the nucleus
PLA3|OsLBD3-7	transcription activator	OsLBD3-7 Overexpression Induced Adaxially Rolled Leaves in Rice.	OsLBD3-7 works as a transcription activator and its protein is located on the plasma membrane and in the nucleus
PLA3|OsLBD3-7	leaf rolling	OsLBD3-7 Overexpression Induced Adaxially Rolled Leaves in Rice.	These results indicated that OsLBD3-7 might acts as an upstream regulatory gene of bulliform cell development to regulate leaf rolling, which will give more insights on the leaf rolling regulation mechanism
