PLA3	seed	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	 However, in contrast to pla1 and pla2, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology
PLA3	homeostasis	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	 Consistent with these pleiotropic phenotypes, PLA3 is expressed in the whole plant body, and is involved in plant hormone homeostasis
PLA3	leaf	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	 Here we report the identification of the rice gene PLASTOCHRON3 (PLA3)/GOLIATH (GO) that regulates various developmental processes including the rate of leaf initiation (the plastochron)| pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase| However, in contrast to pla1 and pla2, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology
PLA3	shoot	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	 pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase
PLA3	reproductive	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	 pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase
