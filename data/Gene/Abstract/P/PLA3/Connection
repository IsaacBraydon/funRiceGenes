PLA2|LHD2	PLA3	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase
PLA2|LHD2	PLA3	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	However, in contrast to pla1 and pla2, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology
PLA2|LHD2	PLA3	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	Double mutant analysis revealed that PLA1, PLA2 and PLA3 are regulated independently but function redundantly
