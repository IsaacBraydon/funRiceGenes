OsWAK14	PIBP1	RRM Transcription Factors Interact with NLRs and Regulate Broad-Spectrum Blast Resistance in Rice.	 We find that PIBP1 and a homolog, Os06 g02240, bind DNA and function as unconventional transcription factors at the promoters of the defense genes OsWAK14 and OsPAL1, activating their expression
