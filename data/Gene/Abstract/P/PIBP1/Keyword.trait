PIBP1	transcription factor	RRM Transcription Factors Interact with NLRs and Regulate Broad-Spectrum Blast Resistance in Rice.	 We find that PIBP1 and a homolog, Os06 g02240, bind DNA and function as unconventional transcription factors at the promoters of the defense genes OsWAK14 and OsPAL1, activating their expression
PIBP1	resistance	RRM Transcription Factors Interact with NLRs and Regulate Broad-Spectrum Blast Resistance in Rice.	 Here, we identify PIBP1 (PigmR-INTERACTING and BLAST RESISTANCE PROTEIN 1), an RRM (RNA-recognition motif) protein that specifically interacts with PigmR and other similar NLRs to trigger blast resistance
PIBP1	resistance	RRM Transcription Factors Interact with NLRs and Regulate Broad-Spectrum Blast Resistance in Rice.	 PigmR-promoted nuclear accumulation of PIBP1 ensures full blast resistance
PIBP1	resistance	RRM Transcription Factors Interact with NLRs and Regulate Broad-Spectrum Blast Resistance in Rice.	 Knockout of PIBP1 and Os06 g02240 greatly attenuated blast resistance
