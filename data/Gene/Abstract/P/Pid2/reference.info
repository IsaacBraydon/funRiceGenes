Here, we constructed a control plasmid pZH01-pi-d2tp309 (pZH01-tp309) and three different expression constructs, pCB-Pi-d25.3kb (pCB5.3kb), pCB-Pi-d26.3kb (pCB6.3kb) and pZH01-Pi-d22.72kb (pZH01-2.72kb) of Pi-d2, driven by Pi-d2 gene's own promoter or CaMV35S promoter. These constructs were separately introduced into japonica rice varieties Lijiangxintuanhegu, Taipei 309, Nipponbare and Zhonghua 9 through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. A total of 150 transgenic rice plants were obtained from the regenerated calli selected on hygromycin. PCR, RT-PCR and Southern-blotting assay showed that the gene of interest had been integrated into rice genome and stably inherited. Thirty-five transgenic lines independently derived from T1 progeny were inoculated with the rice blast strain ZB15. Transformants exhibited resistance to rice blast at various levels. The lesions on the transgenic plant leaves were less severe than those on the controls and the resistance level of transgenic plants harboring the gene of interest from three vectors had no difference. The own promoter of Pi-d2, about 2.2 kb or 3.2 kb, had the similar promoter function as CaMV35S. Field evaluation for three successive years supported the results of artificial trial, and some lines with high resistance to rice leaf blast and neck blast were obtained.
1-s2.0-S1672630809600159-main.pdf	Rice Blast Resistance of Transgenic Rice Plants with Pi-d2 Gene	2010	Rice Science	Institute of Plant Protection, Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chengdu 610066, China	Resistance to rice blast of transgenic rice lines harboring rice blast resistance gene Pi-d2 transformed from three different expression vectors of pCB6.3kb, pCB5.3kb and pZH01-2.72kb were analyzed. Nine advanced-generation transgenic rice lines with Pi-d2 gene displayed various resistance to 39 rice blast strains, and the highest disease-resistant frequency reached 91.7%. Four early-generation homozygous transgenic lines with Pi-d2 gene exhibited resistance to more than 81.5% of 58 rice blast strains, showing the characteristic of wide-spectrum resistance. The transgenic embryonic calli selected by the crude toxin of rice blast fungus showed that the callus induction rate of immature embryo from transgenic rice plants decreased as the concentration of crude toxin in the culture medium increased. When the concentration of crude toxin reached 40%, the callus induction rate of immature embryo from transgenic lines was 49.3%, and that of the receptor control was 5%. The disease incidence of neck blast of the transgenic rice lines in fields under induction was 0% to 50%, indicating that the rice blast resistance of transgenic rice lines is much higher than that of the receptor control.

We previously reported that rice plants expressing the chimeric receptor consisting of rice chitin oligosaccharides binding protein (CEBiP) and the intracellular protein kinase region of Xa21, which confers resistance to rice bacterial blight, showed enhanced cellular responses to a chitin elicitor N-acetylchitoheptaose and increased resistance to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Here, we investigated whether CEBiP fused with another type of receptor-like protein kinase (RLK) also functions as a chimeric receptor. Fusion proteins CRPis consist of CEBiP and the intracellular protein kinase region of a true resistance gene Pi-d2. Transgenic rice expressing a CRPi showed enhanced cellular responses specifically to N-acetylchitoheptaose in cultured cells and increased levels of disease resistance against M. oryzae in plants. These responses depended on the amino acid sequences predicted to be essential for the protein kinase activity of CRPi. The structure of the transmembrane domain in CRPi affected the protein accumulation, cellular responses, and disease resistance in transgenic rice. These results suggest that the chimeric receptor consisting of CEBiP and Pi-d2 functions as a receptor for chitin oligosaccharides and CEBiP-based chimeric receptors fused with other RLKs may also act as functional receptors.
j.1365-313X.2006.02739.x.pdf	A B-lectin receptor kinase gene conferring rice blast resistance	2006	Plant J	Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, is one of the most devastating diseases in rice worldwide. The dominant resistance gene, Pi-d2 [previously named Pi-d(t)2], present in the rice variety Digu, confers gene-for-gene resistance to the Chinese blast strain, ZB15. Pi-d2 was previously mapped close to the centromere of chromosome 6. In this study, the Pi-d2 gene was isolated by a map-based cloning strategy. Pi-d2 encodes a receptor-like kinase protein with a predicted extracellular domain of a bulb-type mannose specific binding lectin (B-lectin) and an intracellular serine-threonine kinase domain. Pi-d2 is a single-copy gene that is constitutively expressed in the rice variety Digu. Transgenic plants carrying the Pi-d2 transgene confer race-specific resistance to the M. grisea strain, ZB15. The Pi-d2 protein is plasma membrane localized. A single amino acid difference at position 441 of Pi-d2 distinguishes resistant and susceptible alleles of rice blast resistance gene Pi-d2. Because of its novel extracellular domain, Pi-d2 represents a new class of plant resistance genes.
art%3A10.1007%2FBF00028849.pdf	Molecular cloning and biochemical characterization of a receptor-like serine/threonine kinase from rice	1994	Plant Mol Biol	Department of Botany, University of Maryland, College Park 20742-5815.	A receptor-like protein kinase, OsPK10, has been cloned from rice (Oryza sativa). The 2.8 kb cDNA contains an open reading frame capable of encoding a peptide sequence of 824 amino acids. The topological features of the predicted OsPK10 protein include an N-terminal signal peptide, a cysteine-rich extracellular ligand-binding domain, a membrane-spanning segment, and a cytoplasmic domain possessing all the hallmarks of catalytic domains of eukaryotic protein kinases. The cytoplasmic domain was selectively expressed in Escherichia coli and assayed for kinase activity. The results show the protein is capable of autophosphorylation using either ATP or GTP as the phosphate donor. Phosphoamino acid analysis reveals phosphorylation of threonines, consistent with the substrate specificity indicated by sequence motifs in the catalytic core. A single amino acid substitution of Glu for Lys-528 completely abolishes autophosphorylation activity. DNA gel blot analyses suggest that the haploid rice genome contains a single copy of the OsPK10 gene. OsPK10 transcripts appear to be more abundant in shoots than in roots of rice seedlings.
NA	Natural variation of rice blast resistance gene Pi-d2.	2015	Genet Mol Res	Agricultural Environment and Resources Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan Province, China.	Studying natural variation in rice resistance genes of cultivated and wild rice relatives can predict resistance stability to rice blast fungus. In the present study, the protein coding regions of the rice R gene Pi-d2 in 35 rice accessions, including Oryza sativa L. subsp. indica Kato (Aus), indica (IND), temperate japonica (TEJ), tropical japonica (TRJ), aromatic (ARO); subgroups of Oryza sativa; 6 accessions of wild rice varieties; O. nivara; and O. rufipogon were analyzed. A total of 13 nucleotide differences were found in the open reading frames (ORFs) of Pi-d2. Translation of these ORFs revealed 9 variants; 3 were novel Pi-d2 variants. Variants H2 and H5 were identified in accessions of cultivated rice and O. nivara, H1, H3, H4, H6, and H8 were only identified in cultivated rice. H2 and H5 were the common types of IND and O. nivara, H8 was the common type of TRJ and AUS, H6 was the specific type of AUS, and H3 was the specific type of ARO. H7 and H9 were specific haplotypes of O. nivara and O. rufipogon, respectively. These findings demonstrate that Pi-d2 variants are useful indicators for each subgroup, and Pi-d2 is an ancient gene that predates speciation of rice subgroups.
