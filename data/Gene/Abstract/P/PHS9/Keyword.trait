PHS9	development	Control of rice pre-harvest sprouting by glutaredoxin-mediated abscisic acid signaling.	 The corresponding gene PHS9 encodes a higher plant unique CC-type glutaredoxin and is specifically expressed in embryo at the late embryogenesis stage, implying that PHS9 plays some roles in late stage of seed development
PHS9	seed	Control of rice pre-harvest sprouting by glutaredoxin-mediated abscisic acid signaling.	 The corresponding gene PHS9 encodes a higher plant unique CC-type glutaredoxin and is specifically expressed in embryo at the late embryogenesis stage, implying that PHS9 plays some roles in late stage of seed development
PHS9	seed	Control of rice pre-harvest sprouting by glutaredoxin-mediated abscisic acid signaling.	 PHS9 or OsGAP overexpression plants showed reduced, while PHS9 or OsGAP knockout mutant plants showed increased ABA sensitivity in seed germination, suggesting that PHS9 and OsGAP acted as negative regulators in ABA signaling during seed germination
PHS9	seed	Control of rice pre-harvest sprouting by glutaredoxin-mediated abscisic acid signaling.	 Interestingly, the germination of PHS9 and OsGAP overexpression or knockout plant seeds was weakly promoted by H2 O2 , implying that PHS9 and OsGAP could affect the ROS signaling during seed germination
