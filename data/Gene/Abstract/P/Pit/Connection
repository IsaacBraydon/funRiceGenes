OsSPK1	Pit	Resistance protein Pit interacts with the GEF OsSPK1 to activate OsRac1 and trigger rice immunity.	Resistance protein Pit interacts with the GEF OsSPK1 to activate OsRac1 and trigger rice immunity.
OsSPK1	Pit	Resistance protein Pit interacts with the GEF OsSPK1 to activate OsRac1 and trigger rice immunity.	 Here, we identified OsSPK1, a DOCK family guanine nucleotide exchange factor, as an interactor of Pit and activator for OsRac1
OsSPK1	Pit	Resistance protein Pit interacts with the GEF OsSPK1 to activate OsRac1 and trigger rice immunity.	 OsSPK1 contributes to signaling by two disease-resistance genes, Pit and Pia, against the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and facilitates OsRac1 activation in vitro and in vivo
OsSPK1	Pit	Resistance protein Pit interacts with the GEF OsSPK1 to activate OsRac1 and trigger rice immunity.	 The CC domain of Pit is required for its binding to OsSPK1, OsRac1 activation, and the induction of cell death
OsRac1	Pit	The Small GTPase OsRac1 Forms Two Distinct Immune Receptor Complexes Containing the PRR OsCERK1 and the NLR Pit	The Small GTPase OsRac1 Forms Two Distinct Immune Receptor Complexes Containing the PRR OsCERK1 and the NLR Pit
OsRac1	Pit	The Small GTPase OsRac1 Forms Two Distinct Immune Receptor Complexes Containing the PRR OsCERK1 and the NLR Pit	 We have previously found that the small GTPase OsRac1 plays key roles in the signaling of OsCERK1, a PRR for fungal chitin, and of Pit, an NLR for rice blast fungus, and associates directly and indirectly with both of these immune receptors
OsRac1	Pit	The Small GTPase OsRac1 Forms Two Distinct Immune Receptor Complexes Containing the PRR OsCERK1 and the NLR Pit	 In this study, using biochemical and bioimaging approaches, we revealed that OsRac1 formed two distinct receptor complexes with OsCERK1 and with Pit
OsRac1	Pit	The Small GTPase OsRac1 Forms Two Distinct Immune Receptor Complexes Containing the PRR OsCERK1 and the NLR Pit	 Activation of OsCERK1 and Pit led to OsRac1 activation and, concomitantly, OsRac1 shifted from a small to a large protein complex fraction
OsRac1	Pit	The Small GTPase OsRac1 Forms Two Distinct Immune Receptor Complexes Containing the PRR OsCERK1 and the NLR Pit	 These findings illuminate how the PRR OsCERK1 and the NLR Pit orchestrate rice immunity through the small GTPase OsRac1
