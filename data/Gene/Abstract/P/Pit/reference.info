Functional markers (FMs), which are designed from functional polymorphisms within the sequence of genes, are unaffected by nonfunctional allelic variation and make it possible to identify an individual gene. We previously showed that the resistance function of the rice blast resistance gene Pit in a resistant cultivar, K59, was mainly acquired by up-regulated promoter activity through the insertion of a long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon upstream of Pit. Here, we developed PCR-based DNA markers derived from the LTR-retrotransposon sequence and used these markers to screen worldwide accessions of rice germplasm. We identified 5 cultivars with the LTR-retrotransposon insertion out of 68 rice accessions. The sequence and expression pattern of Pit in the five cultivars were the same as those in K59 and all showed Pit-mediated blast resistance. The results suggest that the functional Pit identified using the markers was derived from a common progenitor. Additionally, comparison of the Pit coding sequences between K59 and susceptible cultivars revealed that one nucleotide polymorphism, which caused an amino acid substitution, offered another target for a FM. These results indicate that our DNA markers should enhance prediction of Pit function and be applicable to a range of rice varieties/landraces cultivated in various regions worldwide and belonging to the temperate japonica, tropical japonica, and indica groups.

The plant genome contains a large number of disease resistance (R) genes that have evolved through diverse mechanisms. Here, we report that a long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon contributed to the evolution of the rice blast resistance gene Pit. Pit confers race-specific resistance against the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, and is a member of the nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) family of R genes. Compared with the non-functional allele Pit(Npb), the functional allele Pit(K59) contains four amino acid substitutions, and has the LTR retrotransposon Renovator inserted upstream. Pathogenesis assays using chimeric constructs carrying the various regions of Pit(K59) and Pit(Npb) suggest that amino acid substitutions might have a potential effect in Pit resistance; more importantly, the upregulated promoter activity conferred by the Renovator sequence is essential for Pit function. Our data suggest that transposon-mediated transcriptional activation may play an important role in the refunctionalization of additional 'sleeping' R genes in the plant genome.
