Pit	resistant	Identification of the blast resistance gene Pit in rice cultivars using functional markers	 We previously showed that the resistance function of the rice blast resistance gene Pit in a resistant cultivar, K59, was mainly acquired by up-regulated promoter activity through the insertion of a long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon upstream of Pit
