OsWRKY45	Pb1	Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein Pb1 is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction	 The Pb1 protein interacted with WRKY45, a transcription factor involved in induced resistance via the salicylic acid signaling pathway that is regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system| Pb1-mediated panicle blast resistance was largely compromised when WRKY45 was knocked down in a Pb1-containing rice cultivar| Leaf-blast resistance by Pb1 overexpression (Pb1-ox) was also compromised in WRKY45 knockdown/Pb1-ox rice| Blast infection induced higher accumulation of WRKY45 in Pb1-ox than in control Nipponbare rice| Overexpression of Pb1-Quad, a coiled-coil domain mutant that had weak interaction with WRKY45, resulted in significantly weaker blast resistance than that of wild-type Pb1| These results suggest that the blast resistance of Pb1 depends on its interaction with WRKY45 in the nucleus| In a transient system using rice protoplasts, coexpression of Pb1 enhanced WRKY45 accumulation and increased WRKY45-dependent transactivation activity, suggesting that protection of WRKY45 from ubiquitin proteasome system degradation is possibly involved in Pb1-dependent blast resistance|Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein Pb1 is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction
