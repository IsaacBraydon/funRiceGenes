OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Pb1	Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein Pb1 is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction	The Pb1 protein interacted with WRKY45, a transcription factor involved in induced resistance via the salicylic acid signaling pathway that is regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system
OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Pb1	Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein Pb1 is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction	Pb1-mediated panicle blast resistance was largely compromised when WRKY45 was knocked down in a Pb1-containing rice cultivar
OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Pb1	Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein Pb1 is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction	Leaf-blast resistance by Pb1 overexpression (Pb1-ox) was also compromised in WRKY45 knockdown/Pb1-ox rice
OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Pb1	Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein Pb1 is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction	Blast infection induced higher accumulation of WRKY45 in Pb1-ox than in control Nipponbare rice
OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Pb1	Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein Pb1 is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction	Overexpression of Pb1-Quad, a coiled-coil domain mutant that had weak interaction with WRKY45, resulted in significantly weaker blast resistance than that of wild-type Pb1
OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Pb1	Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein Pb1 is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction	These results suggest that the blast resistance of Pb1 depends on its interaction with WRKY45 in the nucleus
OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Pb1	Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein Pb1 is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction	In a transient system using rice protoplasts, coexpression of Pb1 enhanced WRKY45 accumulation and increased WRKY45-dependent transactivation activity, suggesting that protection of WRKY45 from ubiquitin proteasome system degradation is possibly involved in Pb1-dependent blast resistance
OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Pb1	Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein Pb1 is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction	Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein Pb1 is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction
OsFBK1	Pb1	Analysis of drought-responsive signalling network in two contrasting rice cultivars using transcriptome-based approach.	OsFBK1 was also functionally validated in susceptible PB1 rice cultivar and Arabidopsis for providing drought tolerance
OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Pb1	Panicle blast 1 (Pb1) resistance is dependent on at least four QTLs in the rice genome.	We found that the expression of WRKY45 gene downstream of Pb1 was weakly induced by rice blast inoculation at the full heading stage in K209
OsCBSCBSPB4	Pb1	OsCBSCBSPB4 is a Two Cystathionine-¦Â-Synthase Domain-containing Protein from Rice that Functions in Abiotic Stress Tolerance.	 Here, we report the cloning, characterization and functional validation of a CBS domain containing protein, OsCBSCBSPB4 from rice, which pos-sesses two CBS domains and one PB1 domain
OsFBX267	Pb1	Loss of Function of OsFBX267 and OsGA20ox2 in Rice Promotes Early Maturing and Semi-Dwarfism in ¦Ã-Irradiated IWP and Genome-Edited Pusa Basmati-1	 The loss of function of OsGA20ox2 and OsFBX267 in WP-22-2 resulted in reduced plant height as well as early flowering, and the same has been confirmed by editing OsGA20ox2 in the rice variety Pusa Basmati1 (PB1) using the CRISPR-Cas9 approach
