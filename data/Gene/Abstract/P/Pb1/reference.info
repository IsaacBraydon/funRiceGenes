50_183.pdf	Identification of a RFLP Marker Tightly Linked to the Panicle Blast Resistance Gene, Pb1, in Rice	2000	Breeding Science	Aichi Prefectural Agriculture Research Center (AARC) 	We precisely mapped the Pb1 locus for the panicle blast resistence of a quantitative nature on rice chromosome 11 using RFLP markers. Based on the cosegregation of the resistant genotypes of Pb1 and Stvb-i, a rice stripe virus (RSV) resistance gene derived from an Indica cultivar Modan, we examined the linkage relationships between Pb1 and 13 Stvb-i-linked RFLP markers located on the long arm of chromosome 11. The Pb1 locus was mapped in the Modan-derived chromosomal region in the middle part of the long arm of chromosome 11. Pb1 was located on the telomere side in relation to the Stvb-i locus. The Pb1 gene was closely located at 1.2cM from three RFLP markers: S723, CDO226, C189. Then, we examined the graphical genotypes of 34 Modan-derived RSV-resistant cultivars with or without panicle blast resistance, and 12 susceptible Japonica cultivars, using 21 RFLP markers. Among them, cultivars with panicle blast resistance were classified into four types: A, B, C and D, and those without it into six types: E, F, G, H, I and J. In all of the panicle blast-resistant cultivars, the Modan-type bands were observed in S723, CDO226 and C189. On the other hand, in all the panicle blast-susceptible cultivars, the Japonica-type band was observed in S723, whereas the Modan-type bands were noticed in CDO226 and C189 in Type E cultivars. Consequently, only the genotypes of the S723 locus completely coincided with the genotypes of the Pb1 locus. Although, it was determined, based on linkage analysis, that S723, CDO226 and C189 were located at the same locus, graphical genotyping analysis, using many progeny cultivars derived from Modan, revealed that S723 was the closest marker to Pb1 among the three.

Rice blast is one of the most widespread and destructive plant diseases worldwide. Breeders have used disease resistance (R) genes that mediate fungal race-specific 'gene-for-gene' resistance to manage rice blast, but the resistance is prone to breakdown due to high pathogenic variability of blast fungus. Panicle blast 1 (Pb1) is a blast-resistance gene derived from the indica cultivar 'Modan'. Pb1-mediated resistance, which is characterized by durability of resistance and adult/panicle blast resistance, has been introduced into elite varieties for commercial cultivation. We isolated the Pb1 gene by map-based cloning. It encoded a coiled-coil-nucleotide-binding-site-leucine-rich repeat (CC-NBS-LRR) protein. The Pb1 protein sequence differed from previously reported R-proteins, particularly in the NBS domain, in which the P-loop was apparently absent and some other motifs were degenerated. Pb1 was located within one of tandemly repeated 60-kb units, which presumably arose through local genome duplication. Pb1 transcript levels increased during the development of Pb1+ cultivars; this expression pattern accounts for their adult/panicle resistance. Promoter:GUS analysis indicated that genome duplication played a crucial role in the generation of Pb1 by placing a promoter sequence upstream of its coding sequence, thereby conferring a Pb1-characteristic expression pattern to a transcriptionally inactive 'sleeping' resistance gene. We discuss possible determinants for the durability of Pb1-mediated blast resistance.
PNAS-2013-Inoue-1222155110.pdf	Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein Pb1 is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Disease Resistant Crops Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba 305-8602, Japan.	Panicle blast 1 (Pb1) is a panicle blast resistance gene derived from the indica rice cultivar "Modan." Pb1 encodes a coiled-coil-nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR) protein and confers durable, broad-spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae races. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying Pb1-mediated blast resistance. The Pb1 protein interacted with WRKY45, a transcription factor involved in induced resistance via the salicylic acid signaling pathway that is regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Pb1-mediated panicle blast resistance was largely compromised when WRKY45 was knocked down in a Pb1-containing rice cultivar. Leaf-blast resistance by Pb1 overexpression (Pb1-ox) was also compromised in WRKY45 knockdown/Pb1-ox rice. Blast infection induced higher accumulation of WRKY45 in Pb1-ox than in control Nipponbare rice. Overexpression of Pb1-Quad, a coiled-coil domain mutant that had weak interaction with WRKY45, resulted in significantly weaker blast resistance than that of wild-type Pb1. Overexpression of Pb1 with a nuclear export sequence failed to confer blast resistance to rice. These results suggest that the blast resistance of Pb1 depends on its interaction with WRKY45 in the nucleus. In a transient system using rice protoplasts, coexpression of Pb1 enhanced WRKY45 accumulation and increased WRKY45-dependent transactivation activity, suggesting that protection of WRKY45 from ubiquitin proteasome system degradation is possibly involved in Pb1-dependent blast resistance.
NA	Panicle blast 1 (Pb1) resistance is dependent on at least four QTLs in the rice genome.	2017	Rice (N Y)	NARO Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (NIAS), 2-1-2 Kan-nondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602, Japan. haruhiko@affrc.go.jp.	Rice blast is the most serious disease afflicting rice and there is an urgent need for the use of disease resistance (R) genes in blast tolerance breeding programs. Pb1 is classified as a quantitative resistance gene and it does not have fungal specificity. Pb1-mediated resistance develops in the latter stages of growth. However, some cultivars, such as Kanto209 (K209), cultivar name Satojiman, despite possessing Pb1, do not exert resistance to rice blast during the reproductive stage.We found that the expression of WRKY45 gene downstream of Pb1 was weakly induced by rice blast inoculation at the full heading stage in K209. Genetic analysis using the SNP-based Golden Gate assay of K209 crossing with Koshihikari Aichi SBL (KASBL) found at least four regions related to the resistance in the rice genome (Chr8, Chr9, Chr7, Chr11). Mapping of QTL related to Chr7 confirmed the existence of factors that were required for the resistance of Pb1 in the 22 to 23 Mbp region of the rice genome.We clarified how the K209 cultivar is vulnerable to the blast disease despite possessing Pb1 and found the DNA marker responsible for the quantitative resistance of Pb1. We identified the QTL loci required for Pb1-mediated resistance to rice panicle blast. Pb1 was negatively dependent on at least three QTLs, 7, 9 and 11, and positively dependent on one, QTL 8, in the K209 genome. This finding paves the way for creating a line to select optimal QTLs in order to make use of Pb1-mediated resistance more effectively.
