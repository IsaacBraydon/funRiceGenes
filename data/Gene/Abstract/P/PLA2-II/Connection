PLA2-I	PLA2-II	Plant low-molecular-weight phospholipase A2s (PLA2s) are structurally related to the animal secretory PLA2s and are present as a family of isoforms in rice (Oryza sativa)	 These encode mature proteins of 119 amino acids (PLA2-I, preceded by a 19 amino acid signal peptide) and 128 amino acids (PLA2-II, preceded by a 25 amino acid signal peptide), and were derived from four expressed sequence tag (EST) clones
PLA2-I	PLA2-II	Plant low-molecular-weight phospholipase A2s (PLA2s) are structurally related to the animal secretory PLA2s and are present as a family of isoforms in rice (Oryza sativa)	 This sequence was different from but homologous to the PLA2-I and PLA2-II sequences
