Satoh-2008-Mutation of the plas.pdf	Mutation of the plastidial alpha-glucan phosphorylase gene in rice affects the synthesis and structure of starch in the endosperm	2008	Plant Cell	Plant Genetic Resources, Institute of Genetic Resources, Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan. hsatoh@agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp	Plastidial phosphorylase (Pho1) accounts for approximately 96% of the total phosphorylase activity in developing rice (Oryza sativa) seeds. From mutant stocks induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea treatment, we identified plants with mutations in the Pho1 gene that are deficient in Pho1. Strikingly, the size of mature seeds and the starch content in these mutants showed considerable variation, ranging from shrunken to pseudonormal. The loss of Pho1 caused smaller starch granules to accumulate and modified the amylopectin structure. Variation in the morphological and biochemical phenotype of individual seeds was common to all 15 pho1-independent homozygous mutant lines studied, indicating that this phenotype was caused solely by the genetic defect. The phenotype of the pho1 mutation was temperature dependent. While the mutant plants grown at 30 degrees C produced mainly plump seeds at maturity, most of the seeds from plants grown at 20 degrees C were shrunken, with a significant proportion showing severe reduction in starch accumulation. These results strongly suggest that Pho1 plays a crucial role in starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm at low temperatures and that one or more other factors can complement the function of Pho1 at high temperatures.
NA	Rice endosperm starch phosphorylase (Pho1) assembles with disproportionating enzyme (Dpe1) to form a protein complex that enhances synthesis of malto-oligosaccharides.	2016	J Biol Chem	Washington State University, United States;	Starch synthesis in cereal grain endosperm is dependent on the concerted actions of many enzymes. The starch plastidial phosphorylase (Pho1) plays an important role in the initiation of starch synthesis and in the maturation of starch granule in developing rice seeds. Prior evidence has suggested that the rice enzyme, OsPho1, may have a physical/functional interaction with other starch biosynthetic enzymes. Pull-down experiments showed that OsPho1 as well as OsPho1 devoid of its L80 region, a peptide unique to higher plant phosphorylases, captures disproportionating enzyme (OsDpe1). Interaction of the latter enzyme form with OsDpe1 indicates that the putative regulatory L80 is not responsible for multi-enzyme assembly. This heterotypic enzyme complex, determined at a molar ratio of 1:1, was validated by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation studies of native seed proteins and by co-elution chromatographic and co-migration electrophoretic patterns of these enzymes in rice seed extracts. The OsPho1-OsDpe1 complex utilized a broader range of substrates for enhanced synthesis of larger malto-oligosaccharides than each individual enzyme and significantly elevated the substrate affinities of OsPho1 at 30oC. Moreover, the assembly with OsDpe1 enables OsPho1 to utilize products of transglycosylation reactions involving G1 and G3, sugars that it cannot catalyze directly.
NA	Modulation of Shoot Phosphate Level and Growth by PHOSPHATE1 Upstream Open Reading Frame 	2020	Plant Physiol	  Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.	Inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) is an essential nutrient for plant growth, and its availability strongly impacts crop yield. PHOSPHATE1 (PHO1) transfers Pi from root to shoot via Pi export into root xylem vessels. In this work, we demonstrate that an upstream open reading frame (uORF) present in the 5' untranslated region of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) PHO1 inhibits its translation and influences Pi homeostasis. The presence of the uORF strongly inhibited the translation of a PHO1 5'UTR-luciferase construct in protoplasts. A point mutation removing the PHO1 uORF (¦¤uORF) in transgenic Arabidopsis resulted in increased association of its mRNA with polysomes and led to higher PHO1 protein levels, independent of Pi availability. Interestingly, deletion of the uORF led to higher shoot Pi content and was associated with improved shoot growth under low external Pi supply and no deleterious effects under Pi-sufficient conditions. We further show that natural accessions lacking the PHO1 uORF exhibit higher PHO1 protein levels and shoot Pi content. Increased shoot Pi content was linked to the absence of the PHO1 uORF in a population of F2 segregants. We identified the PHO1 uORF in genomes of crops such as rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and wheat (Triticum aesativum), and we verified the inhibitory effect of the rice PHO1 uORF on translation in protoplasts. Our work suggests that regulation of PHO1 expression via its uORF might be a genetic resource useful-both in natural populations and in the context of genome editing-toward improving plant growth under Pi-deficient conditions. 
NA	Pho1 cooperates with DPE1 to control short maltooligosaccharide mobilization during starch synthesis initiation in rice endosperm.	2023	Theor Appl Genet	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China.	Plastidial Î±-glucan phosphorylase is a key factor that cooperates with plastidial disproportionating enzyme to control short maltooligosaccharide mobilization during the initiation process of starch molecule synthesis in developing rice endosperm. Storage starch synthesis is essential for grain filling. However, little is known about how cereal endosperm controls starch synthesis initiation. One of core events for starch synthesis initiation is short maltooligosaccharide (MOS) mobilization consisting of long MOS primer production and excess MOS breakdown. By mutant analyses and biochemical investigations, we present here functional identifications of plastidial Î±-glucan phosphorylase (Pho1) and disproportionating enzyme (DPE1) during starch synthesis initiation in rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm. Pho1 deficiency impaired MOS mobilization, triggering short MOS accumulation and starch synthesis reduction during early seed development. The mutant seeds differed significantly in MOS level and starch content at 15Â days after flowering and exhibited diverse endosperm phenotypes during mid-late seed development: ranging from pseudonormal to shrunken (Shr), severely or excessively Shr. The level of DPE1 was almost normal in the PN seeds but significantly reduced in the Shr seeds. Overexpression of DPE1 in pho1 resulted in plump seeds only. DPE1 deficiency had no obvious effects on MOS mobilization. Knockout of DPE1 in pho1 completely blocked MOS mobilization, resulting in severely and excessively Shr seeds only. These findings show that Pho1 cooperates with DPE1 to control short MOS mobilization during starch synthesis initiation in rice endosperm.
