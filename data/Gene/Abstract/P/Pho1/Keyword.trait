Pho1	starch	Mutation of the plastidial alpha-glucan phosphorylase gene in rice affects the synthesis and structure of starch in the endosperm	The loss of Pho1 caused smaller starch granules to accumulate and modified the amylopectin structure
Pho1	starch	Mutation of the plastidial alpha-glucan phosphorylase gene in rice affects the synthesis and structure of starch in the endosperm	These results strongly suggest that Pho1 plays a crucial role in starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm at low temperatures and that one or more other factors can complement the function of Pho1 at high temperatures
Pho1	starch biosynthesis	Mutation of the plastidial alpha-glucan phosphorylase gene in rice affects the synthesis and structure of starch in the endosperm	These results strongly suggest that Pho1 plays a crucial role in starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm at low temperatures and that one or more other factors can complement the function of Pho1 at high temperatures
Pho1	temperature	Mutation of the plastidial alpha-glucan phosphorylase gene in rice affects the synthesis and structure of starch in the endosperm	The phenotype of the pho1 mutation was temperature dependent
Pho1	temperature	Mutation of the plastidial alpha-glucan phosphorylase gene in rice affects the synthesis and structure of starch in the endosperm	These results strongly suggest that Pho1 plays a crucial role in starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm at low temperatures and that one or more other factors can complement the function of Pho1 at high temperatures
Pho1	seed	Mutation of the plastidial alpha-glucan phosphorylase gene in rice affects the synthesis and structure of starch in the endosperm	Plastidial phosphorylase (Pho1) accounts for approximately 96% of the total phosphorylase activity in developing rice (Oryza sativa) seeds
Pho1	seed	Mutation of the plastidial alpha-glucan phosphorylase gene in rice affects the synthesis and structure of starch in the endosperm	Variation in the morphological and biochemical phenotype of individual seeds was common to all 15 pho1-independent homozygous mutant lines studied, indicating that this phenotype was caused solely by the genetic defect
Pho1	endosperm	Mutation of the plastidial alpha-glucan phosphorylase gene in rice affects the synthesis and structure of starch in the endosperm	These results strongly suggest that Pho1 plays a crucial role in starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm at low temperatures and that one or more other factors can complement the function of Pho1 at high temperatures
Pho1	growth	Modulation of Shoot Phosphate Level and Growth by PHOSPHATE1 Upstream Open Reading Frame 	 Our work suggests that regulation of PHO1 expression via its uORF might be a genetic resource useful-both in natural populations and in the context of genome editing-toward improving plant growth under Pi-deficient conditions
Pho1	shoot	Modulation of Shoot Phosphate Level and Growth by PHOSPHATE1 Upstream Open Reading Frame 	 We further show that natural accessions lacking the PHO1 uORF exhibit higher PHO1 protein levels and shoot Pi content
Pho1	shoot	Modulation of Shoot Phosphate Level and Growth by PHOSPHATE1 Upstream Open Reading Frame 	 Increased shoot Pi content was linked to the absence of the PHO1 uORF in a population of F2 segregants
Pho1	homeostasis	Modulation of Shoot Phosphate Level and Growth by PHOSPHATE1 Upstream Open Reading Frame 	 In this work, we demonstrate that an upstream open reading frame (uORF) present in the 5' untranslated region of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) PHO1 inhibits its translation and influences Pi homeostasis

Pho1	Pi	Modulation of Shoot Phosphate Level and Growth by PHOSPHATE1 Upstream Open Reading Frame 	 A point mutation removing the PHO1 uORF (¦¤uORF) in transgenic Arabidopsis resulted in increased association of its mRNA with polysomes and led to higher PHO1 protein levels, independent of Pi availability
Pho1	Pi	Modulation of Shoot Phosphate Level and Growth by PHOSPHATE1 Upstream Open Reading Frame 	 We further show that natural accessions lacking the PHO1 uORF exhibit higher PHO1 protein levels and shoot Pi content
