Pikp-1	blast resistance	The Pik-p resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice is mediated by a pair of closely linked CC-NBS-LRR genes	The Pik-p resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice is mediated by a pair of closely linked CC-NBS-LRR genes
Pikp-1	cell death	The rice NLR pair Pikp-1/Pikp-2 initiates cell death through receptor cooperation rather than negative regulation	 We found that any domain truncation, in either Pikp-1 or Pikp-2, prevented cell death in the presence of AVR-PikD, revealing that all domains are required for activity
Pikp-1	cell death	The rice NLR pair Pikp-1/Pikp-2 initiates cell death through receptor cooperation rather than negative regulation	 Further, expression of individual Pikp-1 or Pikp-2 domains did not result in cell death
Pikp-1	cell death	The rice NLR pair Pikp-1/Pikp-2 initiates cell death through receptor cooperation rather than negative regulation	 Mutations in the conserved P-loop and MHD sequence motifs in both Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 prevented cell death activation, demonstrating that these motifs are required for the function of the two partner NLRs
