Pikp-1	 Further, expression of individual Pikp-1 or Pikp-2 domains did not result in cell death |  Finally, we showed that Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 associate to form homo- and hetero-complexes in planta in the absence of AVR-PikD; on co-expression the effector binds to Pikp-1 generating a tri-partite complex
