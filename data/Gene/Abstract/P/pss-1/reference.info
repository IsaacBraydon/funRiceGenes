During routine seed increase procedures in rice, semi-sterile plants are common; however, such semi-sterility mutants in rice varieties have been only rarely analyzed genetically. W207-2 is a semi-sterile selection from the japonica rice variety Nipponbare. In this report, we found the female gamete of W207-2 was normal, and its semi-sterility was unaffected by growth duration but was conditioned by a recessive nuclear gene whose action leads to pollen semi-sterility and anther indehiscence, and the gene was named as pss1 (pollen semi-sterile). Using an F(2) population derived from the two parents W207-2 and Dular and a pooled DNA strategy, pss1 was mapped to an interval on chromosome 8 defined by the two SSR loci RM6356 and RS41. The position of pss1 was confirmed in another F(2) population derived from the cross W207-2 x Nipponbare. Over 2,000 homozygous pss1 segregants from the large W207-2 x Dular F(2) population were used to fine map pss1 to a 0.04 cM segment flanked by a CAPs marker L2 and a dCAPs L3 marker. Sequences for both markers are present on a single PAC clone, and the physical distance between them is about 28 kb. Analysis of the PAC sequence predicts the presence of five open reading frames, they are as follows: putative ribonuclease PH, putative avr9 elicitor response protein, kinesin1-like protein, putative protein RNP-D precursor and putative 40S ribosomal protein S13. This result would be helpful in cloning the pss1 gene.
111.pdf	Pollen semi-sterility1 encodes a kinesin-1-like protein important for male meiosis, anther dehiscence, and fertility in rice	2011	Plant Cell	National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	In flowering plants, male meiosis produces four microspores, which develop into pollen grains and are released by anther dehiscence to pollinate female gametophytes. The molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating male meiosis in rice (Oryza sativa) remain poorly understood. Here, we describe a rice pollen semi-sterility1 (pss1) mutant, which displays reduced spikelet fertility (~40%) primarily caused by reduced pollen viability (~50% viable), and defective anther dehiscence. Map-based molecular cloning revealed that PSS1 encodes a kinesin-1-like protein. PSS1 is broadly expressed in various organs, with highest expression in panicles. Furthermore, PSS1 expression is significantly upregulated during anther development and peaks during male meiosis. The PSS1-green fluorescent protein fusion is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of rice protoplasts. Substitution of a conserved Arg (Arg-289) to His in the PSS1 motor domain nearly abolishes its microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity. Consistent with this, lagging chromosomes and chromosomal bridges were found at anaphase I and anaphase II of male meiosis in the pss1 mutant. Together, our results suggest that PSS1 defines a novel member of the kinesin-1 family essential for male meiotic chromosomal dynamics, male gametogenesis, and anther dehiscence in rice.
