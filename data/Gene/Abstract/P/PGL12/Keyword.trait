PGL12	chloroplast	PALE-GREEN LEAF12 Encodes A Novel Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Required for Chloroplast Development and 16S rRNA processing in Rice.	 We also showed that the transcript levels of several nuclear- and plastid-encoded genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis were significantly altered in pgl12 mutants
PGL12	chloroplast	PALE-GREEN LEAF12 Encodes A Novel Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Required for Chloroplast Development and 16S rRNA processing in Rice.	 Our results indicate that PGL12 is a new PLS-type PPR protein required for proper chloroplast development and 16S rRNA processing in rice
PGL12	temperature	PALE-GREEN LEAF12 Encodes A Novel Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Required for Chloroplast Development and 16S rRNA processing in Rice.	 The pgl12 mutant had significantly reduced chlorophyll contents and increased sensitivity to changes in temperature
PGL12	seedling	PALE-GREEN LEAF12 Encodes A Novel Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Required for Chloroplast Development and 16S rRNA processing in Rice.	 In this study, we identified and characterized a rice mutant, pale-green leaf12 (pgl12); at the seedling stage, pgl12 mutants had yellow-green leaves, which gradually turned pale green as the plants grew
PGL12	development	PALE-GREEN LEAF12 Encodes A Novel Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Required for Chloroplast Development and 16S rRNA processing in Rice.	 We also showed that the transcript levels of several nuclear- and plastid-encoded genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis were significantly altered in pgl12 mutants
PGL12	development	PALE-GREEN LEAF12 Encodes A Novel Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Required for Chloroplast Development and 16S rRNA processing in Rice.	 Our results indicate that PGL12 is a new PLS-type PPR protein required for proper chloroplast development and 16S rRNA processing in rice
PGL12	map-based cloning	PALE-GREEN LEAF12 Encodes A Novel Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Required for Chloroplast Development and 16S rRNA processing in Rice.	 Map-based cloning of PGL12, including a transgenic complementation test, confirmed the presence of a base substitution (C to T), generating a stop codon, within LOC_Os12g10184 in the pgl12 mutant
PGL12	photosynthesis	PALE-GREEN LEAF12 Encodes A Novel Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Required for Chloroplast Development and 16S rRNA processing in Rice.	 We also showed that the transcript levels of several nuclear- and plastid-encoded genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis were significantly altered in pgl12 mutants
PGL12	R protein	PALE-GREEN LEAF12 Encodes A Novel Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Required for Chloroplast Development and 16S rRNA processing in Rice.	 Our results indicate that PGL12 is a new PLS-type PPR protein required for proper chloroplast development and 16S rRNA processing in rice
PGL12	chloroplast development	PALE-GREEN LEAF12 Encodes A Novel Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Required for Chloroplast Development and 16S rRNA processing in Rice.	 We also showed that the transcript levels of several nuclear- and plastid-encoded genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis were significantly altered in pgl12 mutants
PGL12	chloroplast development	PALE-GREEN LEAF12 Encodes A Novel Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Required for Chloroplast Development and 16S rRNA processing in Rice.
