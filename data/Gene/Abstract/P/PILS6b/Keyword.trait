PILS6b	auxin	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.
PILS6b	auxin	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.	 Taken together, our findings suggested that OsSPL14 can control axillary bud outgrowth and tiller number by activating the expression of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to fine-tune auxin transport in rice
PILS6b	tiller	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.	 Loss of function of OsPIN1b or PILS6b increased the tiller number of rice
PILS6b	tiller	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.	 Taken together, our findings suggested that OsSPL14 can control axillary bud outgrowth and tiller number by activating the expression of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to fine-tune auxin transport in rice
PILS6b	auxin transport	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.
PILS6b	auxin transport	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.	 Taken together, our findings suggested that OsSPL14 can control axillary bud outgrowth and tiller number by activating the expression of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to fine-tune auxin transport in rice
PILS6b	tiller number	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.	 Loss of function of OsPIN1b or PILS6b increased the tiller number of rice
PILS6b	tiller number	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.	 Taken together, our findings suggested that OsSPL14 can control axillary bud outgrowth and tiller number by activating the expression of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to fine-tune auxin transport in rice
