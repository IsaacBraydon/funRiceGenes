OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	PILS6b	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	PILS6b	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.	 Further analysis revealed that OsSPL14 directly binds to the promoter of PIN-FORMED 1b (OsPIN1b) and PIN-LIKE6b (PILS6b) to positively regulate their expression
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	PILS6b	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.	 OsPIN1b and PILS6b were highly expressed in axillary buds and proved to be involved in bud outgrowth
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	PILS6b	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.	 Loss of function of OsPIN1b or PILS6b increased the tiller number of rice
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	PILS6b	OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.	 Taken together, our findings suggested that OsSPL14 can control axillary bud outgrowth and tiller number by activating the expression of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to fine-tune auxin transport in rice
