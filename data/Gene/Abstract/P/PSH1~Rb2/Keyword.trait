PSH1|Rb2	leaf	Dominant complementary interaction between OsC1 and two tightly linked genes, Rb1 and Rb2, controls the purple leaf sheath in rice.	 Here, PSH1 (purple leaf sheath 1) was mapped to chromosome 1 using an F(2) and a RIL population
PSH1|Rb2	sheath	Dominant complementary interaction between OsC1 and two tightly linked genes, Rb1 and Rb2, controls the purple leaf sheath in rice.	 Here, PSH1 (purple leaf sheath 1) was mapped to chromosome 1 using an F(2) and a RIL population
PSH1|Rb2	map-based cloning	Dominant complementary interaction between OsC1 and two tightly linked genes, Rb1 and Rb2, controls the purple leaf sheath in rice.	 Map-based cloning and transformation assays further divided PSH1 as two tightly linked bHLH genes, Rb1 and Rb2
