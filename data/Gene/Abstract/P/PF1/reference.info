The DNA-binding proteins PF1 and GT-2 are factors that bind to different functionally defined, positively acting cis-elements in the PHYA genes of oat and rice, respectively. PF1 is an HMG-I/Y protein, with its cognate cis-element being an AT-rich sequence, designated PE1, whereas GT-2 is a transcriptional activator with twin DNA binding domains that recognize a triplet of GT-boxes in a complex motif designated GTE. To further define the DNA-binding activity of PF1 and to explore potential inter-relationships between the two factors, we have performed a series of in vitro DNA-binding experiments with both PE1 and GTE target sites. The data show that, consistent with its membership of the HMG-I/Y protein family, PF1 can bend DNA when bound to PE1. In addition, PF1 can bind promiscuously, with varying affinity, to other AT-containing motifs, including GTE. When co-incubated with GT-2, PF1 enhances the specific DNA-binding activity of GT-2 toward GTE, the first report of such activity for a plant HMG-I/Y protein. This enhancement takes place without demonstrable physical contact between the two proteins, suggesting the possibility of a novel, indirect mechanism of recruitment involving DNA target-site pre-conditioning. The evidence indicates therefore that PF1 and GT-2 do not perform functionally equivalent roles in positively regulating oat and rice PHYA gene expression. However, the data suggest the possibility that PF1 may act as an architectural factor, promiscuously recognizing a spectrum of AT-containing elements in plant promoters, with the general function of catalyzing enhanced binding of conventional cognate transcriptional regulators to these elements via DNA bending.
Plant Cell-1994-Nieto-Sotelo-287-301.pdf	PF1: an A-T hook-containing DNA binding protein from rice that interacts with a functionally defined d(AT)-rich element in the oat phytochrome A3 gene promoter	1994	Plant Cell	University of California-Berkeley/United States Department of Agriculture, Plant Gene Expression Center, Albany 94710.	Phytochrome-imposed down-regulation of the expression of its own phytochrome A gene (PHYA) is one of the fastest light-induced effects on transcription reported in plants to date. Functional analysis of the oat PHYA3 promoter in a transfection assay has revealed two positive elements, PE1 and PE3, that function synergistically to support high levels of transcription in the absence of light. We have isolated a rice cDNA clone (pR4) encoding a DNA binding protein that binds to the AT-rich PE1 element. We tested the selectivity of the pR4-encoded DNA binding activity using linker substitution mutations of PE1 that are known to disrupt positive expression supported by the PHYA3 promoter in vivo. Binding to these linker substitution mutants was one to two orders of magnitude less than to the native PE1 element. Because this is the behavior expected of positive factor 1 (PF1), the presumptive nuclear transcription factor that acts in trans at the PE1 element in vivo, the data support the conclusion that the protein encoded by pR4 is in fact rice PF1. The PF1 polypeptide encoded by pR4 is 213 amino acids long and contains four repeats of the A-T hook DNA binding motif found in high-mobility group I-Y (HMGI-Y) proteins. In addition, PF1 contains an 11-amino acid-long hydrophobic region characteristic of HMG I proteins, its N-terminal region shows strong similarities to a pea H1 histone sequence and a short peptide sequence from wheat HMGa, and it shows a high degree of similarity along its entire length to the HMG Y-like protein encoded by a soybean cDNA, SB16. In vitro footprinting and quantitative gel shift analyses showed that PF1 binds preferentially to the PE1 element but also at lower affinity to two other AT-rich regions upstream of PE1. This feature is consistent with the binding characteristics of HMG I-Y proteins that are known to bind to most runs of six or more AT base pairs. Taken together, the properties of PF1 suggest that it belongs to a newly described family of nuclear proteins containing both histone H1 domains and A-T hook DNA binding domains.
