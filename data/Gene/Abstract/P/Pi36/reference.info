Interaction between the coiled-coil domain of rice blast resistance protein Pi36 and methyl-jasmonate (MeJA) was studied by fluorescence and UV-vis spectroscopic techniques. The quenching mechanism of fluorescence of MeJA by this domain was discussed to be a static quenching procedure. Fluorescence quenching was explored to measure the number of binding sites n and apparent binding constants K. The thermodynamics parameters DeltaH, DeltaG, DeltaS were also calculated. The results indicate the binding reaction was not entropy-driven but enthalpy-driven, and hydrophobic binding played major role in the interaction. The binding sites of MeJA with the coiled-coil structural domain of rice blast resistance protein Pi36 were found to approach the microenvironment of both Tyr and Trp by the synchronous fluorescence spectrometry. The distance r between donor (the coiled-coil domain of rice blast resistance protein Pi36) and acceptor (MeJA) was obtained according to Forster theory of non-radioactive energy transfer.
GEN17642541.pdf	The in silico map-based cloning of Pi36, a rice coiled-coil nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat gene that confers race-specific resistance to the blast fungus	2007	Genetics	Laboratory of Plant Resistasnce and Genetics, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.	The indica rice variety Kasalath carries Pi36, a gene that determines resistance to Chinese isolates of rice blast and that has been located to a 17-kb interval on chromosome 8. The genomic sequence of the reference japonica variety Nipponbare was used for an in silico prediction of the resistance (R) gene content of the interval and hence for the identification of candidate gene(s) for Pi36. Three such sequences, which all had both a nucleotide-binding site and a leucine-rich repeat motif, were present. The three candidate genes were amplified from the genomic DNA of a number of varieties by long-range PCR, and the resulting amplicons were inserted into pCAMBIA1300 and/or pYLTAC27 vectors to determine sequence polymorphisms correlated to the resistance phenotype and to perform transgenic complementation tests. Constructs containing each candidate gene were transformed into the blast-susceptible variety Q1063, which allowed the identification of Pi36-3 as the functional gene, with the other two candidates being probable pseudogenes. The Pi36-encoded protein is composed of 1056 amino acids, with a single substitution event (Asp to Ser) at residue 590 associated with the resistant phenotype. Pi36 is a single-copy gene in rice and is more closely related to the barley powdery mildew resistance genes Mla1 and Mla6 than to the rice blast R genes Pita, Pib, Pi9, and Piz-t. An RT-PCR analysis showed that Pi36 is constitutively expressed in Kasalath.
panqinghua-10.pdf	Genetic and physical mapping of Pi36(t), a novel rice blast resistance gene located on rice chromosome 8	2005	Mol Genet Genomics	Laboratory of Plant Resistance and Genetics, College of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Blast resistance in the indica cultivar (cv.) Q61 was inherited as a single dominant gene in two F2 populations, F2-1 and F2-2, derived from crosses between the donor cv. and two susceptible japonica cvs. Aichi Asahi and Lijiangxintuanheigu (LTH), respectively. To rapidly determine the chromosomal location of the resistance (R) gene detected in Q61, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was performed in the F2-1 population using bulked-segregant analysis (BSA) in combination with recessive-class analysis (RCA). One of the three linked markers identified, BA1126(550), was cloned and sequenced. The R gene locus was roughly mapped on rice chromosome 8 by comparison of the BA1126(550) sequence with rice sequences in the databases (chromosome landing). To confirm this finding, seven known markers, including four sequence-tagged-site (STS) markers and three simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers flanking BA1126(550) on chromosome 8, were subjected to linkage analysis in the two F2 populations. The locus was mapped to a 5.8 cM interval bounded by RM5647 and RM8018 on the short arm of chromosome 8. This novel R gene is therefore tentatively designated as Pi36(t). For fine mapping of the Pi36(t) locus, five additional markers including one STS marker and four candidate resistance gene (CRG) markers were developed in the target region, based on the genomic sequence of the corresponding region of the reference japonica cv. Nipponbare. The Pi36(t) locus was finally localized to an interval of about 0.6 cM flanked by the markers RM5647 and CRG2, and co-segregated with the markers CRG3 and CRG4. To physically map this locus, the Pi36(t)-linked markers were mapped by electronic hybridization to bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) or P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) clones of Nipponbare, and a contig map was constructed in silico through Pairwise BLAST analysis. The Pi36(t) locus was physically delimited to an interval of about 17.0 kb, based on the genomic sequence of Nipponbare.

Quantitative real time RT-PCR was used to investigate the expression profiles of various resistance-related genes in both the Pi36/AvPi36 incompatible interactions. Among 17 members of the OsMAPK family, OsMAPK2, OsMAPK4, OsMAPK8 and OsMAPK15 were differentially expressed, as were OsWRKY30, OsWRKY32, OsWRKY64 and OsWRKY67 among the 13 OsWRKY members studied. The induction of the expression of genes from both of these families suggests that both the JA and SA pathways are involved in Pi36-mediated defence. Other genes differentially expressed included the OsbZIP transcription factors, OsNIF1 and OsNIF2, and the NPR1 homologue OsNH2, all of which were reported in the rice blast pathosystem. The involvement of these genes illustrates the complexity of the downstream signalling pathways involved in the Pi36/AvrPi36 interaction.
