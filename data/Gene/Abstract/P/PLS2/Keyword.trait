PLS2	leaf	Rice Premature Leaf Senescence 2, Encoding a Glycosyltransferase (GT), Is Involved in Leaf Senescence.	 PLS2 expression was detected in all tissues surveyed, but predominantly in leaf mesophyll cells
PLS2	leaf	Rice Premature Leaf Senescence 2, Encoding a Glycosyltransferase (GT), Is Involved in Leaf Senescence.	 These data suggested that the PLS2 allele is essential for normal leaf senescence and its mutation resulted in PLS
PLS2	leaf senescence	Rice Premature Leaf Senescence 2, Encoding a Glycosyltransferase (GT), Is Involved in Leaf Senescence.	 These data suggested that the PLS2 allele is essential for normal leaf senescence and its mutation resulted in PLS
PLS2	senescence	Rice Premature Leaf Senescence 2, Encoding a Glycosyltransferase (GT), Is Involved in Leaf Senescence.	 These data suggested that the PLS2 allele is essential for normal leaf senescence and its mutation resulted in PLS
PLS2	sucrose	Rice Premature Leaf Senescence 2, Encoding a Glycosyltransferase (GT), Is Involved in Leaf Senescence.	 The pls2 mutant accumulated higher levels of sucrose together with decreased expression of sucrose metabolizing genes compared with wild type
