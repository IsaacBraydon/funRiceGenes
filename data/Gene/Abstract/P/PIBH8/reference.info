Wang-1999-The Pib gene for ric.pdf	The Pib gene for rice blast resistance belongs to the nucleotide binding and leucine-rich repeat class of plant disease resistance genes	1999	Plant J	Rice Genome Research Program, Institute of the Society for Techno-Innovation of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, is one of the most serious diseases of rice. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of Pib, one of the rice blast resistance genes. The Pib gene was isolated by a map-based cloning strategy. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Pib gene product contains a nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs); thus, Pib is a member of the NBS-LRR class of plant disease resistance genes. Interestingly, a duplication of the kinase 1a, 2 and 3a motifs of the NBS region was found in the N-terminal half of the Pib protein. In addition, eight cysteine residues are clustered in the middle of the LRRs, a feature which has not been reported for other R genes. Pib gene expression was induced upon altered environmental conditions, such as altered temperatures and darkness.
Wang-2001-Expression of the Pi.pdf	Expression of the Pib rice-blast-resistance gene family is up-regulated by environmental conditions favouring infection and by chemical signals that trigger secondary plant defences	2001	Plant Mol Biol	Institute of the Society for Techno-Innovation of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Ippaizuka 446-1, Kamiyokoba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0854, Japan	The rice blast resistance gene Pib is a member of the nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) class of plant disease resistance (R) genes and belongs to a small gene family. We describe here the isolation and characterization of a Pib homologue (PibH8), and extensive investigation of the expression of the Pib gene family (Pib, PibH8, HPibH8-1, HPibH8-2) under various environmental and chemical treatments. PibH8 shows 42% identity and 60% similarity to Pib and, like Pib, has a duplication of the kinase 1a, 2, and 3a motifs of the NBS region in the N-terminal half of the protein. Interestingly, genes of the Pib family exhibit a diurnal rhythm of expression. RNA gel blot analysis revealed that their expression was regulated dramatically by environmental signals, such as temperature, light and water availability. Their expression was also induced by chemical treatments, such as jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, ethylene and probenazole. Our findings suggest that expression of the Pib gene family is up-regulated by environmental conditions that would favour pathogen infection. This may reflect the evolution of anticipatory control of R gene expression.
