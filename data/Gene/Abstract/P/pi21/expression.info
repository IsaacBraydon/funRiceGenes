Pi21	 The expression levels of brassinolide-insensitive 1, flagellin sensitive 2, and elongation factor Tu receptor, ethylene (ET) biosynthesis and signaling genes, were higher in the Pi21-RNAi line than Nipponbare	 In this study, comparative transcriptome profiling of the Pi21-RNAi transgenic rice line and Nipponbare with M |  In total, 1109 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the Pi21-RNAi line and Nipponbare with M |  The expression levels of brassinolide-insensitive 1, flagellin sensitive 2, and elongation factor Tu receptor, ethylene (ET) biosynthesis and signaling genes, were higher in the Pi21-RNAi line than Nipponbare |  This suggested that there was a more robust PTI response in Pi21-RNAi plants and that ET signaling was important to rice blast resistance
