OsHIPP28	Pi21	A small secreted protein, RsMf8HN, in Rhizoctonia solani triggers plant immune response, which interacts with rice OsHIPP28.	 We confirmed the occurrence of in vivo cross-interactions of RsMf8HN with a rice molecule, the heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein OsHIPP28, which is a protein related to the disease susceptibility factor Pi21
OsSULTR3;6	Pi21	Improvement of resistance to rice blast and bacterial leaf streak by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of Pi21 and OsSULTR3;6 in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	Improvement of resistance to rice blast and bacterial leaf streak by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of Pi21 and OsSULTR3;6 in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
OsSULTR3;6	Pi21	Improvement of resistance to rice blast and bacterial leaf streak by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of Pi21 and OsSULTR3;6 in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 In this study, susceptible material 58B was edited by CRISPR/Cas9, targeting a target of the Pi21 gene and a target of the effector-binding element (EBE) of the OsSULTR3;6 gene, and the mutants 58b were obtained by Agrobacterium-mediated method
OsSULTR3;6	Pi21	Improvement of resistance to rice blast and bacterial leaf streak by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of Pi21 and OsSULTR3;6 in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 The expression of the edited pi21 and EBE of Ossultr3;6 was significantly reduced, and the expression of defense responsive genes was significantly upregulated after infected with rice blast
