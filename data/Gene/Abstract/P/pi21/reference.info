To identify the genes for field resistance to rice blast, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring field resistance to rice blast in Japanese upland rice were detected and mapped using RFLP and SSR markers. QTL analysis was carried out in F4 progeny lines from the cross between Nipponbare (moderately susceptible, lowland) and Owarihatamochi (resistant, upland). Two QTLs were detected on chromosome 4 and one QTL was detected on each of chromosomes 9 and 12. The phenotypic variation explained by each QTL ranged from 7.9 to 45.7% and the four QTLs explained 66.3% of the total phenotypic variation. Backcrossed progeny lines were developed to transfer the QTL with largest effect using the susceptible cultivar Aichiasahi as a recurrent parent. Among 82 F3 lines derived from the backcross, resistance segregated in the expected ratio of resistant 1 : heterozygous 2 : susceptible 1. The average score for blast resistance measured in the field was 4.2 ± 0.67, 7.5 ± 0.51and 8.2 ± 0.66, for resistant, heterozygous and susceptible groups, respectively. The resistance gene, designated pi21, was mapped on chromosome 4 as a single recessive gene between RFLP marker loci G271 and G317 at a distance of 5.0 cM and 8.5 cM, respectively. The relationship to previously reported major genes and QTLs conferring resistance to blasts, and the significance of marker-assisted selection to improve field resistance, are discussed.

Race-specific resistance to blast disease has usually not been durable. Here, we report the cloning of a previously unknown type of gene that confers non-race-specific resistance and its successful use in breeding. Pi21 encodes a proline-rich protein that includes a putative heavy metal-binding domain and putative protein-protein interaction motifs. Wild-type Pi21 appears to slow the plant's defense responses, which may support optimization of defense mechanisms. Deletions in its proline-rich motif inhibit this slowing. Pi21 is separable from a closely linked gene conferring poor flavor. The resistant pi21 allele, which is found in some strains of japonica rice, could improve blast resistance of rice worldwide.
NA	Transcriptome Analysis Highlights Defense and Signaling Pathways Mediated by Rice pi21 Gene with Partial Resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae.	2016	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory Breeding Base for Zhejiang Sustainable Pest and Disease Control, Institute of Virology and Biotechnology, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences Hangzhou, China.	Rice blast disease is one of the most destructive rice diseases worldwide. The pi21 gene confers partial and durable resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms of resistance mediated by the loss-of-function of Pi21. In this study, comparative transcriptome profiling of the Pi21-RNAi transgenic rice line and Nipponbare with M. oryzae infection at different time points (0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hpi) were investigated using RNA sequencing. The results generated 43,222 unique genes mapped to the rice genome. In total, 1109 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the Pi21-RNAi line and Nipponbare with M. oryzae infection, with 103, 281, 209, 69, and 678 DEGs at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hpi, respectively. Functional analysis showed that most of the DEGs were involved in metabolism, transport, signaling, and defense. Among the genes assigned to plant-pathogen interaction, we identified 43 receptor kinase genes associated with pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition and calcium ion influx. The expression levels of brassinolide-insensitive 1, flagellin sensitive 2, and elongation factor Tu receptor, ethylene (ET) biosynthesis and signaling genes, were higher in the Pi21-RNAi line than Nipponbare. This suggested that there was a more robust PTI response in Pi21-RNAi plants and that ET signaling was important to rice blast resistance. We also identified 53 transcription factor genes, including WRKY, NAC, DOF, and ERF families that show differential expression between the two genotypes. This study highlights possible candidate genes that may serve a function in the partial rice blast resistance mediated by the loss-of-function of Pi21 and increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in partial resistance against M. oryzae.
