OsRac1	Pi25|Pid3	Importance of OsRac1 and RAI1 in signalling of NLR protein-mediated resistance to rice blast disease.	 We also identified RAI1, a transcriptional activator, as a PID3 interactor required for PID3-mediated blast resistance and showed that RAI1 expression is induced by PID3 via a process mediated by OsRac1
