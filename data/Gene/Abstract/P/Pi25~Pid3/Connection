OsRac1	Pi25|Pid3	Importance of OsRac1 and RAI1 in signalling of NLR protein-mediated resistance to rice blast disease.	 We also identified RAI1, a transcriptional activator, as a PID3 interactor required for PID3-mediated blast resistance and showed that RAI1 expression is induced by PID3 via a process mediated by OsRac1
OsSPK1	Pi25|Pid3	The OsSPK1-OsRac1-RAI1 defense signaling pathway is shared by two distantly related NLR proteins in rice blast resistance.	 We found that in blast resistance mediated by the NLR PIRICULARIA ORYZAE RESISTANCE IN DIGU 3 (PID3), the guanine nucleotide exchange factor OsSPK1 works downstream of PID3
