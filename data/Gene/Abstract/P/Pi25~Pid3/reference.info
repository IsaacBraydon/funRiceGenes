Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases. Using map-based strategy and in silico approach we isolated a new rice (Oryza sativa L.) blast resistance allele of Pid3, designated Pi25, from a stable blast resistance cultivar Gumei2. Over-expression analysis and complementation test showed that Pi25 conferred blast resistance to M. oryzae isolate js001-20. Sequence analysis showed that Pi25 was an intronless gene of 2,772 nucleotides with single nucleotide substitution in comparison to Pid3 at the nucleotide position 459 and predicatively encoded a typical coiled coil--nucleotide binding site--leucine rich repeat (CC--NBS--LRR) protein of 924 amino acid residuals with 100% identity to Pid3 putative protein. The susceptible allele pi25 in Nipponbare contained a nonsense mutation at the nucleotide position 2,209 resulting in a truncated protein with 736 amino acid residuals. In addition, 14 nucleotide substitutions resulting in 10 amino acid substitutions were identified between Pi25 and pi25 upstream the premature stop codon in the susceptible allele. Although the mechanism of Pi25/Pid3-mediated resistance needs to be further investigated, the isolation of the allele would facilitate the utilization of Pi25/Pid3 in rice blast resistance breeding program via transgenic approach and marker assisted selection.
10.1023-A-1021272710294.pdf	Mapping of leaf and neck blast resistance genes with resistance gene analog, RAPD and RFLP in rice	2002	Euphytica	China National Rice Research Institute, National Center for Rice Improvement, Hangzhou, 310006, China	An F-8 recombinant inbred population was constructed using a commercial indica rice variety Zhong 156 as the female parent and a semidwarf indica variety Gumei 2 with durable resistance to rice blast as the male parent. Zhong 156 is resistant to the fungus race ZC(15) at the seedling stage but susceptible to the same race at the flowering stage. Gumei 2 is resistant to ZC15 at both stages. The blast resistance of 148 recombinant inbred lines was evaluated using the blast race ZC15. Genetic analysis indicated that the resistance to leaf blast was controlled by three genes and the presence of resistant alleles at any loci would result in resistance. One of the three genes did not have effects at the flowering stage. Two genes, tentatively assigned as Pi24(t) and Pi25(t), were mapped onto chromosome 12 and 6, respectively, based on RGA (resistance gene analog), RFLP and RAPD markers. Pi24( t) conferred resistance to leaf blast only, and its resistance allele was from Zhong 156. Pi25( t) conferred resistance to both leaf and neck blast, and its resistance allele was from Gumei 2. In a natural infection test in a blast hot-spot, Pi25(t) exhibited high resistance to neck blast, while Pi24(t) showed little effect.
GEN18241303.pdf	Identification of a new rice blast resistance gene, Pid3, by genomewide comparison of paired nucleotide-binding site--leucine-rich repeat genes and their pseudogene alleles between the two sequenced rice genomes	2009	Genetics	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Plant Gene Research Centre, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases. The two major subspecies of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.), indica and japonica, have shown obvious differences in rice blast resistance, but the genomic basis that underlies the difference is not clear. We performed a genomewide comparison of the major class of resistant gene family, the nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) gene family, between 93-11 (indica) and Nipponbare (japonica) with a focus on their pseudogene members. We found great differences in either constitution or distribution of pseudogenes between the two genomes. According to this comparison, we designed the PCR-based molecular markers specific to the Nipponbare NBS-LRR pseudogene alleles and used them as cosegregation markers for blast susceptibility in a segregation population from a cross between a rice blast-resistant indica variety and a susceptible japonica variety. Through this approach, we identified a new blast resistance gene, Pid3, in the indica variety, Digu. The allelic Pid3 loci in most of the tested japonica varieties were identified as pseudogenes due to a nonsense mutation at the nucleotide position 2208 starting from the translation initiation site. However, this mutation was not found in any of the tested indica varieties, African cultivated rice varieties, or AA genome-containing wild rice species. These results suggest that the pseudogenization of Pid3 in japonica occurred after the divergence of indica and japonica.

To further our understanding of the genetic control of blast resistance in rice cultivar Gumei 2 and, consequently, to facilitate the utilization of this durably blast-resistant cultivar, we studied 304 recombinant inbred lines of indica rice cross Zhong 156/Gumei 2 and a linkage map comprising 181 markers. An analysis of segregation for resistance against five isolates of rice blast suggested that one gene cluster and three additional major genes that are independently inherited are responsible for the complete resistance of Gumei 2. The gene cluster was located to chromosome 6 and includes two genes mapped previously, Pi25(t), against Chinese rice blast isolate 92-183 (race ZC15) and Pi26(t) against Philippine rice blast isolate Ca89 (lineage 4), and a gene for resistance against Philippine rice blast isolate 92330-5 (lineage 17). Of the two genes conferring resistance against the Philippine isolates V86013 (lineage 15) and C923-39 (lineage 46), we identified one as Pi26(t) and mapped the other onto the distal end of chromosome 2 where Pib is located. We used three components of partial blast resistance, percentage diseased leaf area (DLA), lesion number and lesion size, all measured in the greenhouse, to measure the degree of susceptibility to isolates Ca89 and C923-39 and subsequently identified nine and eight quantitative trait loci (QTLs), respectively. Epistasis was determined to play an important role in partial resistance against Ca89. Using DLA measured on lines susceptible in a blast nursery, we detected six QTLs. While different QTLs were detected for partial resistance to Ca89 and C923-39, respectively, most were involved in the partial resistance in the field. Our results suggest that the blast resistance in Gumei 2 is controlled by multiple major genes and minor genes with epistatic effects.
NA	Allelic variation of the rice blast resistance gene Pid3 in cultivated rice worldwide.	2017	Sci Rep	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Center, Changsha, 410125, China.	In this study, the re-sequencing data from 3,000 rice genomes project (3â€‰K RGP) was used to analyze the allelic variation at the rice blast resistance (R) Pid3 locus. A total of 40 haplotypes were identified based on 71 nucleotide polymorphic sites among 2621 Pid3 homozygous alleles in the 3k genomes. Pid3 alleles in most japonica rice accessions were pseudogenes due to premature stop mutations, while those in most indica rice accessions were identical to the functional haplotype Hap_6, which had a similar resistance spectrum as the previously reported Pid3 gene. By sequencing and CAPS marker analyzing the Pid3 alleles in widespread cultivars in China, we verified that Hap_6 had been widely deployed in indica rice breeding of China. Thus, we suggest that the priority for utilization of the Pid3 locus in rice breeding should be on introducing the functional Pid3 alleles into japonica rice cultivars and the functional alleles of non-Hap_6 haplotypes into indica rice cultivars for increasing genetic diversity.
