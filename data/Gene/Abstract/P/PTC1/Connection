OsTDF1	PTC1|OsMS1	The functional analysis of OsTDF1 reveals a conserved genetic pathway for tapetal development between rice and Arabidopsis	The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that OsTDF1 acts downstream of UDT1 and upstream of TDR, EAT1, OsMYB103 and PTC1 in rice, suggesting that the genetic pathway for tapetum development is generally conserved between rice and Arabidopsis
AP37|OsERF3	PTC1|OsMS1	OsMS1 functions as a transcriptional activator to regulate programmed tapetum development and pollen exine formation in rice.	 Results of qPCR suggested that the expression of the genes associated with tapetal PCD and pollen wall biosynthesis, such as EAT1, AP37, AP25, OsC6 and OsC4, were significantly reduced in osms1 mutant

Results of qPCR suggested that the expression of the genes associated with tapetal PCD and pollen wall biosynthesis, such as EAT1, AP37, AP25, OsC6 and OsC4, were significantly reduced in osms1 mutant
OSC4	PTC1|OsMS1	OsMS1 functions as a transcriptional activator to regulate programmed tapetum development and pollen exine formation in rice.	 Results of qPCR suggested that the expression of the genes associated with tapetal PCD and pollen wall biosynthesis, such as EAT1, AP37, AP25, OsC6 and OsC4, were significantly reduced in osms1 mutant
OsC6	PTC1|OsMS1	OsMS1 functions as a transcriptional activator to regulate programmed tapetum development and pollen exine formation in rice.	 Results of qPCR suggested that the expression of the genes associated with tapetal PCD and pollen wall biosynthesis, such as EAT1, AP37, AP25, OsC6 and OsC4, were significantly reduced in osms1 mutant
