In higher plants, timely degradation of tapetal cells, the innermost sporophytic cells of the anther wall layer, is a prerequisite for the development of viable pollen grains. However, relatively little is known about the mechanism underlying programmed tapetal cell development and degradation. Here, we report a key regulator in monocot rice (Oryza sativa), PERSISTANT TAPETAL CELL1 (PTC1), which controls programmed tapetal development and functional pollen formation. The evolutionary significance of PTC1 was revealed by partial genetic complementation of the homologous mutation MALE STERILITY1 (MS1) in the dicot Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). PTC1 encodes a PHD-finger (for plant homeodomain) protein, which is expressed specifically in tapetal cells and microspores during anther development in stages 8 and 9, when the wild-type tapetal cells initiate a typical apoptosis-like cell death. Even though ptc1 mutants show phenotypic similarity to ms1 in a lack of tapetal DNA fragmentation, delayed tapetal degeneration, as well as abnormal pollen wall formation and aborted microspore development, the ptc1 mutant displays a previously unreported phenotype of uncontrolled tapetal proliferation and subsequent commencement of necrosis-like tapetal death. Microarray analysis indicated that 2,417 tapetum- and microspore-expressed genes, which are principally associated with tapetal development, degeneration, and pollen wall formation, had changed expression in ptc1 anthers. Moreover, the regulatory role of PTC1 in anther development was revealed by comparison with MS1 and other rice anther developmental regulators. These findings suggest a diversified and conserved switch of PTC1/MS1 in regulating programmed male reproductive development in both dicots and monocots, which provides new insights in plant anther development.
NA	OsMS1 functions as a transcriptional activator to regulate programmed tapetum development and pollen exine formation in rice.	2019	Plant Mol Biol	Key Laboratory for Zhejiang Super Rice Research &amp; State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, China.	OsMS1 functions as a transcriptional activator and interacts with known tapetal regulatory factors through its plant homeodomain (PHD) regulating tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) and pollen exine formation in rice. The tapetum, a hallmark tissue in the stamen, undergoes degradation triggered by PCD during post-meiotic anther development. This degradation process is indispensable for anther cuticle and pollen exine formation. Previous study has shown that PTC1 plays a critical role in the regulation of tapetal PCD. However, it remained unclear how this occurs. To further investigate the role of this gene in rice, we used CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate the homozygous mutant named as osms1, which showed complete male sterility with slightly yellow and small anthers, as well as invisible pollen grains. In addition, cytological observation revealed delayed tapetal PCD, defective pollen exine formation and a lack of DNA fragmentation according to a TUNEL analysis in the anthers of osms1 mutant. OsMS1, which encodes a PHD finger protein, was located in the nucleus of rice protoplasts and functioned as a transcription factor with transcriptional activation activity. Y2H and BiFC assays demonstrated that OsMS1 can interact with OsMADS15 and TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 (TIP2). It has been reported that TIP2 coordinated with TDR to modulate the expression of EAT1 and further regulated tapetal PCD in rice. Results of qPCR suggested that the expression of the genes associated with tapetal PCD and pollen wall biosynthesis, such as EAT1, AP37, AP25, OsC6 and OsC4, were significantly reduced in osms1 mutant. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the interaction of OsMS1 with known tapetal regulatory factors through its PHD finger regulates tapetal PCD and pollen exine formation in rice.
NA	OsMS188 Is a Key Regulator of Tapetum Development and Sporopollenin Synthesis in Rice	2021	Rice (N Y)	Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, 100 Guilin Road, Shanghai, 200234, China.	Background: During anther development, the tapetum provides essential nutrients and materials for pollen development. In rice, multiple transcription factors and enzymes essential for tapetum development and pollen wall formation have been cloned from male-sterile lines.  Results: In this study, we obtained several lines in which the MYB transcription factor OsMS188 was knocked out through the CRISPR-Cas9 approach. The osms188 lines exhibited a male-sterile phenotype with aberrant development and degeneration of tapetal cells, absence of the sexine layer and defective anther cuticles. CYP703A3, CYP704B2, OsPKS1, OsPKS2, DPW and ABCG15 are sporopollenin synthesis and transport-related genes in rice. Plants with mutations in these genes are male sterile, with a defective sexine layer and anther cuticle. Further biochemical assays demonstrated that OsMS188 binds directly to the promoters of these genes to regulate their expression. UDT1, OsTDF1, TDR, bHLH142 and EAT1 are upstream regulators of rice tapetum development. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and activation assays revealed that TDR directly regulates OsMS188 expression. Additionally, protein interaction assays indicated that TDR interacts with OsMS188 to regulate downstream gene expression.  Conclusion: Overall, OsMS188 is a key regulator of tapetum development and pollen wall formation. The gene regulatory network established in this work may facilitate future investigations of fertility regulation in rice and in other crop species.
