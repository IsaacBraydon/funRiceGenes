PACP	transcription factor	A coiled-coil protein associates Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 with KNOX/BELL transcription factors to maintain silencing of cell differentiation-promoting genes in the shoot apex.	 PACP is involved in the recruitment or stabilization of PRC2 to genes targeted by KNOX/BELL transcription factors to maintain H3K27me3 and gene repression in dividing cells of the shoot apex
PACP	shoot	A coiled-coil protein associates Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 with KNOX/BELL transcription factors to maintain silencing of cell differentiation-promoting genes in the shoot apex.	 We show that PACP is required for the repression of cell differentiation-promoting genes targeted by a rice KNOX1 protein in the shoot apical meristem
