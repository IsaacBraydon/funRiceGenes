OsEMF2b	PACP	A coiled-coil protein associates Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 with KNOX/BELL transcription factors to maintain silencing of cell differentiation-promoting genes in the shoot apex	A loss-of-function mutation of PACP resulted in differential gene expression similar to that observed in PRC2 gene knockdown plants, reduced H3K27me3 levels, and reduced genome-wide binding of the PRC2 core component EMF2b.
