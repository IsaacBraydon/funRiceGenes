We identified two new members of the GRAS gene family from rice, CIGR1 and CIGR2, which are rapidly induced upon N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor perception. The predicated proteins encoded by CIGR1 and CIGR2 possess significant sequence similarity with previously identified members of the GRAS family, such as Arabidopsis SCARECROW, GAI, RGA, tomato Lateral suppressor, and rice SLR1, all of which have VHIID regions, likely to play a role in cellular signaling. Fusions of CIGR1 and CIGR2 with Green Fluorescent Protein were detected exclusively in the nuclei of onion epidermal cells. The expression of CIGR1 and CIGR2 was dependent on the structure of N-acetylchitooligosaccharides, which parallels the structural specificity for chitin binding to the plasma membrane-localized chitin-binding protein, and independent of de novo protein synthesis. Co-cultivation of rice cells with rice blast fungus strongly induced the expression of CIGR1 and CIGR2, whereas inoculation of suspension cells with phytopathogenic bacteria did not. We hypothesize that CIGR1 and CIGR2 act as transcriptional regulators in the early events of the elicitor-induced defense response in rice.
GEN18042267.pdf	Two adjacent nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat class genes are required to confer Pikm-specific rice blast resistance	2008	Genetics	QTL Genomics Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan. ashikawa@affrc.go.jp	The rice blast resistance gene Pikm was cloned by a map-based cloning strategy. High-resolution genetic mapping and sequencing of the gene region in the Pikm-containing cultivar Tsuyuake narrowed down the candidate region to a 131-kb genomic interval. Sequence analysis predicted two adjacently arranged resistance-like genes, Pikm1-TS and Pikm2-TS, within this candidate region. These genes encoded proteins with a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and were considered the most probable candidates for Pikm. However, genetic complementation analysis of transgenic lines individually carrying these two genes negated the possibility that either Pikm1-TS or Pikm2-TS alone was Pikm. Instead, it was revealed that transgenic lines carrying both of these genes expressed blast resistance. The results of the complementation analysis and an evaluation of the resistance specificity of the transgenic lines to blast isolates demonstrated that Pikm-specific resistance is conferred by cooperation of Pikm1-TS and Pikm2-TS. Although these two genes are not homologous with each other, they both contain all the conserved motifs necessary for an NBS-LRR class gene to function independently as a resistance gene.
s11032-007-9118-6.pdf	The Pik m gene, conferring stable resistance to isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae, was finely mapped in a crossover-cold region on rice chromosome 11	2007	Molecular Breeding	Laboratory of Plant Resistance and Genetics, College of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China	The Pik m gene in rice confers a high and stable resistance to many isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae collected from southern China. This gene locus was roughly mapped to the long arm of rice chromosome 11 with restriction fragment length polymorphic (RFLP) markers in the previous study. To effectively utilize the resistance, a linkage analysis was performed in a mapping population consisting of 659 highly susceptible plants collected from four F2 populations using the publicly available simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The result showed that the locus was linked to the six SSR markers and defined by RM254 and RM144 with â‰<U+383C><U+3E38>13.4 and â‰<U+383C><U+3E38>1.2 cM, respectively. To fine map this locus, additional 10 PCR-based markers were developed in a region flanked by RM254 and RM144 through bioinformatics analysis (BIA) using the reference sequence of cv. Nipponbare. The linkage analysis with these 10 markers showed that the locus was further delimited to a 0.3-cM region flanked by K34 and K10, in which three markers, K27, K28, and K33, completely co-segregated with the locus. To physically map the locus, the Pik m -linked markers were anchored to bacterial artificial chromosome clones of the reference cv. Nipponbare by BIA. A physical map spanning â‰<U+383C><U+3E38>278 kb in length was constructed by alignment of sequences of the clones anchored by BIA, in which only six candidate genes having the R gene conserved structure, protein kinase, were further identified in an 84-kb segment.
