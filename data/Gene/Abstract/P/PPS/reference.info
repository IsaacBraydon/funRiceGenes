DNA Res-2001-Raghuvanshi-73-9.pdf	Isolation and Molecular Characterization of the COP1 Gene Homolog from Rice,OryzasativaL. subsp.Indicavar. Pusa Basmati	2001	DNA Res	Centre for Plant Molecular Biology and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India.	The COP1 (CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1) gene has been identified earlier from dicot species namely Arabidopsis, tomato and pea. The protein encoded by this gene acts as a molecular switch that negatively regulates the transition from the skotomorphogenic to the photomorphogenic mode of plant development. We have isolated and characterized the COP1 homolog from a monocot species, i.e. rice (var. Pusa Basmati 1). All the functional domains (Zn-binding RING finger motif, coiled-coil region, WD-40 repeats, cytoplasmic/nuclear localization sequences and protein-protein interaction domains) that are known in the COP1 proteins from dicots are conserved in COP1 from rice as well. The transcript levels of COP1 vary in various tissues of the rice plant. These variations were found to be development-dependent and do not solely depend on the light conditions.
Plant Cell-2011-Tanaka-2143-54.pdf	The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice	2011	Plant Cell	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Because plant reproductive development occurs only in adult plants, the juvenile-to-adult phase change is an indispensable part of the plant life cycle. We identified two allelic mutants, peter pan syndrome-1 (pps-1) and pps-2, that prolong the juvenile phase in rice (Oryza sativa) and showed that rice PPS is an ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1. The pps-1 mutant exhibits delayed expression of miR156 and miR172 and the suppression of GA biosynthetic genes, reducing the GA(3) content in this mutant. In spite of its prolonged juvenile phase, the pps-1 mutant flowers early, and this is associated with derepression of RAP1B expression in pps-1 plants independently of the Hd1-Hd3a/RFT1 photoperiodic pathway. PPS is strongly expressed in the fourth and fifth leaves, suggesting that it regulates the onset of the adult phase downstream of MORI1 and upstream of miR156 and miR172. Its ability to regulate the vegetative phase change and the time of flowering suggests that rice PPS acquired novel functions during the evolution of rice/monocots.
psb-7-50.pdf	Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth	2012	Plant Signal Behav	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.	The rice peter pan syndrome-1 (pps-1) mutant shows a prolonged juvenile phase and early flowering. Although the early vegetative phase and flowering time of pps-1 have been closely examined, the phenotypes in the late vegetative and reproductive phases are not yet well understood. In the ninth leaf blade of pps-1, the relative length of the midrib was comparable to the sixth leaf blade of wild-type. Moreover, pps-1 had a small inflorescence meristem and small panicles. These phenotypes indicate that in pps-1 the juvenile phase coexists with the late vegetative phase, resulting in small panicles. Gibberellin is known to promote the juvenile-adult phase transition. d18-k is dwarf and has a prolonged juvenile phase. Double mutant (d18-k pps-1) showed the same phenotype as the pps-1, indicating that PPS is upstream of GA biosynthetic genes.
