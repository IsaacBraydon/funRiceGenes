DNA Res-2001-Raghuvanshi-73-9.pdf	Isolation and Molecular Characterization of the COP1 Gene Homolog from Rice,OryzasativaL. subsp.Indicavar. Pusa Basmati	2001	DNA Res	Centre for Plant Molecular Biology and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India.	The COP1 (CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1) gene has been identified earlier from dicot species namely Arabidopsis, tomato and pea. The protein encoded by this gene acts as a molecular switch that negatively regulates the transition from the skotomorphogenic to the photomorphogenic mode of plant development. We have isolated and characterized the COP1 homolog from a monocot species, i.e. rice (var. Pusa Basmati 1). All the functional domains (Zn-binding RING finger motif, coiled-coil region, WD-40 repeats, cytoplasmic/nuclear localization sequences and protein-protein interaction domains) that are known in the COP1 proteins from dicots are conserved in COP1 from rice as well. The transcript levels of COP1 vary in various tissues of the rice plant. These variations were found to be development-dependent and do not solely depend on the light conditions.
Plant Cell-2011-Tanaka-2143-54.pdf	The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice	2011	Plant Cell	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Because plant reproductive development occurs only in adult plants, the juvenile-to-adult phase change is an indispensable part of the plant life cycle. We identified two allelic mutants, peter pan syndrome-1 (pps-1) and pps-2, that prolong the juvenile phase in rice (Oryza sativa) and showed that rice PPS is an ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1. The pps-1 mutant exhibits delayed expression of miR156 and miR172 and the suppression of GA biosynthetic genes, reducing the GA(3) content in this mutant. In spite of its prolonged juvenile phase, the pps-1 mutant flowers early, and this is associated with derepression of RAP1B expression in pps-1 plants independently of the Hd1-Hd3a/RFT1 photoperiodic pathway. PPS is strongly expressed in the fourth and fifth leaves, suggesting that it regulates the onset of the adult phase downstream of MORI1 and upstream of miR156 and miR172. Its ability to regulate the vegetative phase change and the time of flowering suggests that rice PPS acquired novel functions during the evolution of rice/monocots.
psb-7-50.pdf	Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth	2012	Plant Signal Behav	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.	The rice peter pan syndrome-1 (pps-1) mutant shows a prolonged juvenile phase and early flowering. Although the early vegetative phase and flowering time of pps-1 have been closely examined, the phenotypes in the late vegetative and reproductive phases are not yet well understood. In the ninth leaf blade of pps-1, the relative length of the midrib was comparable to the sixth leaf blade of wild-type. Moreover, pps-1 had a small inflorescence meristem and small panicles. These phenotypes indicate that in pps-1 the juvenile phase coexists with the late vegetative phase, resulting in small panicles. Gibberellin is known to promote the juvenile-adult phase transition. d18-k is dwarf and has a prolonged juvenile phase. Double mutant (d18-k pps-1) showed the same phenotype as the pps-1, indicating that PPS is upstream of GA biosynthetic genes.
NA	Screening of rice mutants with improved saccharification efficiency results in the identification of CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 and GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE 1.	2017	Planta	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi, 464-8601, Japan. khirano@nuagr1.agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp.	The screening of rice mutants with improved cellulose to glucose saccharification efficiency (SE) identifies reduced xylan and/or ferulic acid, and a qualitative change of lignin to impact SE. To ensure the availability of sustainable energy, considerable effort is underway to utilize lignocellulosic plant biomass as feedstock for the production of biofuels. However, the high cost of degrading plant cell wall components to fermentable sugars (saccharification) has been problematic. One way to overcome this barrier is to develop plants possessing cell walls that are amenable to saccharification. In this study, we aimed to identify new molecular factors that influence saccharification efficiency (SE) in rice. By screening 22 rice mutants, we identified two lines, 122 and 108, with improved SE. Reduced xylan and ferulic acid within the cell wall of line 122 were probable reasons of improved SE. Line 108 showed reduced levels of thioglycolic-released lignin; however, the amount of Klason lignin was comparable to the wild-type, indicating that structural changes had occurred in the 108 lignin polymer which resulted in improved SE. Positional cloning revealed that the genes responsible for improved SE in 122 and 108 were rice CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (OsCOP1) and GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE 1 (GH1), respectively, which have not been previously reported to influence SE. The screening of mutants for improved SE is an efficient approach to identify novel genes that affect SE, which is relevant in the development of crops as biofuel sources.
NA	OsCOP1 regulates embryo development and flavonoid biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.) 	2021	Theor Appl Genet	Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Bioresources, Research Institute for Agriculture and Life Sciences, and Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Republic of Korea.	Novel mutations of OsCOP1 were identified to be responsible for yellowish pericarp and embryo lethal phenotype, which revealed that OsCOP1 plays a crucial role in flavonoid biosynthesis and embryogenesis in rice seed. Successful production of viable seeds is a major component of plant life cycles, and seed development is a complex, highly regulated process that affects characteristics such as seed viability and color. In this study, three yellowish-pericarp embryo lethal (yel) mutants, yel-hc, yel-sk, and yel-cc, were produced from three different japonica cultivars of rice (Oryza sativa L). Mutant seeds had yellowish pericarps and exhibited embryonic lethality, with significantly reduced grain size and weight. Morphological aberrations were apparent by 5 days after pollination, with abnormal embryo development and increased flavonoid accumulation observed in the yel mutants. Genetic analysis and mapping revealed that the phenotype of the three yel mutants was controlled by a single recessive gene, LOC_Os02g53140, an ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1). The yel-hc, yel-sk, and yel-cc mutants carried mutations in the RING finger, coiled-coil, and WD40 repeat domains, respectively, of OsCOP1. CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis was used to knock out OsCOP1 by targeting its functional domains, and transgenic seed displayed the yel mutant phenotype. Overexpression of OsCOP1 in a homozygous yel-hc mutant background restored pericarp color, and the aberrant flavonoid accumulation observed in yel-hc mutant was significantly reduced in the embryo and endosperm. These results demonstrate that OsCOP1 is associated with embryo development and flavonoid biosynthesis in rice grains. This study will facilitate a better understanding of the functional roles of OsCOP1 involved in early embryogenesis and flavonoid biosynthesis in rice seeds.
