cr201228a.pdf	Photoperiod- and thermo-sensitive genic male sterility in rice are caused by a point mutation in a novel noncoding RNA that produces a small RNA	2012	Cell Res	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.	Photoperiod- and thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (PGMS and TGMS) are the core components for hybrid breeding in crops. Hybrid rice based on the two-line system using PGMS and TGMS lines has been successfully developed and applied widely in agriculture. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the control of PGMS and TGMS remains obscure. In this study, we mapped and cloned a major locus, p/tms12-1 (photo- or thermo-sensitive genic male sterility locus on chromosome 12), which confers PGMS in the japonica rice line Nongken 58S (NK58S) and TGMS in the indica rice line Peiai 64S (PA64S, derived from NK58S). A 2.4-kb DNA fragment containing the wild-type allele P/TMS12-1 was able to restore the pollen fertility of NK58S and PA64S plants in genetic complementation. P/TMS12-1 encodes a unique noncoding RNA, which produces a 21-nucleotide small RNA that we named osa-smR5864w. A substitution of C-to-G in p/tms12-1, the only polymorphism relative to P/TMS12-1, is present in the mutant small RNA, namely osa-smR5864m. Furthermore, overexpression of a 375-bp sequence of P/TMS12-1 in transgenic NK58S and PA64S plants also produced osa-smR5864w and restored pollen fertility. The small RNA was expressed preferentially in young panicles, but its expression was not markedly affected by different day lengths or temperatures. Our results reveal that the point mutation in p/tms12-1, which probably leads to a loss-of-function for osa-smR5864m, constitutes a common cause for PGMS and TGMS in the japonica and indica lines, respectively. Our findings thus suggest that this noncoding small RNA gene is an important regulator of male development controlled by cross-talk between the genetic networks and environmental conditions.
luqing_mgg.pdf	Localization of pms3, a gene for photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterility, to a 28.4-kb DNA fragment	2005	Mol Genet Genomics	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research Wuhan, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Photoperiod-sensitive genic male-sterile (PSGMS) rice, in which pollen fertility is regulated by day-length, originally arose as a natural mutant in the rice cultivar Nongken 58 (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica). Previous studies identified pms3 on chromosome 12 as the locus of the original PSGMS mutation. In this study we have assigned the pms3 locus to a 28.4-kb DNA fragment by genetic and physical mapping. A cross between Nongken 58S (PSGMS line) and DH80 was used to produce an F2 population of about 7000 plants, from which 892 highly sterile individuals were obtained for recombination analysis. By analyzing recombination events in the sterile individuals using a total of 157 RFLP probes from a BAC contig covering the pms3 region, the pms3 locus was localized to a sub-region of less than 1.7 cM. Further analysis of recombination events using 49 additional probes isolated from this sub-region identified markers flanking the pms3 region on each side; these markers are only 28.4-kb apart. Sequence analysis of this fragment predicted the presence of five ORFs, found high homology with two ESTs in public databases, and detected three SNPs between the mutant and the wild-type parents, which may be helpful for identifying a candidate gene for pms3.
PNAS-2012-Ding-1121374109.pdf	A long noncoding RNA regulates photoperiod-sensitive male sterility, an essential component of hybrid rice	2012	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Centre of Plant Gene Research, Huazhong Agriculture University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Hybrid rice has greatly contributed to the global increase of rice productivity. A major component that facilitated the development of hybrids was a mutant showing photoperiod-sensitive male sterility (PSMS) with its fertility regulated by day length. Transcriptome studies have shown that large portions of the eukaryotic genomic sequences are transcribed to long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, the potential roles for only a few lncRNAs have been brought to light at present. Thus, great efforts have to be invested to understand the biological functions of lncRNAs. Here we show that a lncRNA of 1,236 bases in length, referred to as long-day-specific male-fertility-associated RNA (LDMAR), regulates PSMS in rice. We found that sufficient amount of the LDMAR transcript is required for normal pollen development of plants grown under long-day conditions. A spontaneous mutation causing a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) between the wild-type and mutant altered the secondary structure of LDMAR. This change brought about increased methylation in the putative promoter region of LDMAR, which reduced the transcription of LDMAR specifically under long-day conditions, resulting in premature programmed cell death (PCD) in developing anthers, thus causing PSMS. Thus, a lncRNA could directly exert a major effect on a trait like a structure gene, and a SNP could alter the function of a lncRNA similar to amino acid substitution in structural genes. Molecular elucidating of PSMS has important implications for understanding molecular mechanisms of photoperiod regulation of many biological processes and also for developing male sterile germplasms for hybrid crop breeding.
