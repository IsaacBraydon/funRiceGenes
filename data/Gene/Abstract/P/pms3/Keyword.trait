pms3	sterile	Localization of pms3, a gene for photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterility, to a 28.4-kb DNA fragment	 By analyzing recombination events in the sterile individuals using a total of 157 RFLP probes from a BAC contig covering the pms3 region, the pms3 locus was localized to a sub-region of less than 1
