The Arabidopsis WUSCHEL (WUS) protein, which plays an important role in the specification of the stem cells in the shoot apical meristem (SAM), contains an 'atypical' homeodomain (HD) with extra residues in its loop and turn regions. We speculated that a WUS-type atypical HD protein might also be involved in the specification and maintenance of the root apical meristem (RAM) stem cells of rice. To investigate this possibility, we isolated and characterized a rice WUS-type homeobox gene designated quiescent-center-specific homeobox (QHB) gene. Using transformants carrying the QHB promoter-GUS and in situ hybridization, we found that QHB was specifically expressed in the central cells of a quiescent center (QC) of the root. During embryogenesis and crown root formation, QHB expression was observed prior to the morphological differentiation of the root. However, we detected different QHB expression patterns in the process of the RAM development, specifically between radicle and crown root formation, suggesting that the cell-fate determination of the QC may be controlled by different mechanisms. We also produced transformants that overexpress QHB or Arabidopsis WUS. These transformants did not form crown roots, but developed multiple shoots from ectopic SAMs with malformed leaves. On the basis of these observations, we propose that the WUS-type homeobox gene is involved in the specification and maintenance of the stem cells (QC cells) in the RAM, by a mechanism similar to that for WUS in the SAM.
NA	Transcriptome comparison between pluripotent and non-pluripotent calli derived from mature rice seeds	2020	Sci Rep	Department of Chemistry, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Korea.	In vitro plant regeneration involves a two-step practice of callus formation and de novo organogenesis. During callus formation, cellular competence for tissue regeneration is acquired, but it is elusive what molecular processes and genetic factors are involved in establishing cellular pluripotency. To explore the mechanisms underlying pluripotency acquisition during callus formation in monocot plants, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on the pluripotent and non-pluripotent rice calli using RNA-seq. We obtained a dataset of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which accounts for molecular processes underpinning pluripotency acquisition and maintenance. Core regulators establishing root stem cell niche were implicated in pluripotency acquisition in rice callus, as observed in Arabidopsis. In addition, KEGG analysis showed that photosynthetic process and sugar and amino acid metabolism were substantially suppressed in pluripotent calli, whereas lipid and antioxidant metabolism were overrepresented in up-regulated DEGs. We also constructed a putative coexpression network related to cellular pluripotency in rice and proposed potential candidates conferring pluripotency in rice callus. Overall, our transcriptome-based analysis can be a powerful resource for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms establishing cellular pluripotency in rice callus.
