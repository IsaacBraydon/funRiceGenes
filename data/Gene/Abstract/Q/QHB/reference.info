The Arabidopsis WUSCHEL (WUS) protein, which plays an important role in the specification of the stem cells in the shoot apical meristem (SAM), contains an 'atypical' homeodomain (HD) with extra residues in its loop and turn regions. We speculated that a WUS-type atypical HD protein might also be involved in the specification and maintenance of the root apical meristem (RAM) stem cells of rice. To investigate this possibility, we isolated and characterized a rice WUS-type homeobox gene designated quiescent-center-specific homeobox (QHB) gene. Using transformants carrying the QHB promoter-GUS and in situ hybridization, we found that QHB was specifically expressed in the central cells of a quiescent center (QC) of the root. During embryogenesis and crown root formation, QHB expression was observed prior to the morphological differentiation of the root. However, we detected different QHB expression patterns in the process of the RAM development, specifically between radicle and crown root formation, suggesting that the cell-fate determination of the QC may be controlled by different mechanisms. We also produced transformants that overexpress QHB or Arabidopsis WUS. These transformants did not form crown roots, but developed multiple shoots from ectopic SAMs with malformed leaves. On the basis of these observations, we propose that the WUS-type homeobox gene is involved in the specification and maintenance of the stem cells (QC cells) in the RAM, by a mechanism similar to that for WUS in the SAM.
NA	Transcriptome comparison between pluripotent and non-pluripotent calli derived from mature rice seeds	2020	Sci Rep	Department of Chemistry, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Korea.	In vitro plant regeneration involves a two-step practice of callus formation and de novo organogenesis. During callus formation, cellular competence for tissue regeneration is acquired, but it is elusive what molecular processes and genetic factors are involved in establishing cellular pluripotency. To explore the mechanisms underlying pluripotency acquisition during callus formation in monocot plants, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on the pluripotent and non-pluripotent rice calli using RNA-seq. We obtained a dataset of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which accounts for molecular processes underpinning pluripotency acquisition and maintenance. Core regulators establishing root stem cell niche were implicated in pluripotency acquisition in rice callus, as observed in Arabidopsis. In addition, KEGG analysis showed that photosynthetic process and sugar and amino acid metabolism were substantially suppressed in pluripotent calli, whereas lipid and antioxidant metabolism were overrepresented in up-regulated DEGs. We also constructed a putative coexpression network related to cellular pluripotency in rice and proposed potential candidates conferring pluripotency in rice callus. Overall, our transcriptome-based analysis can be a powerful resource for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms establishing cellular pluripotency in rice callus.
NA	OsQHB Improves Salt Tolerance by Scavenging Reactive Oxygen Species in Rice.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Soil salinity is a major environmental stress that restricts the growth and yield of crops. Mining the key genes involved in the balance of rice salt tolerance and yield will be extremely important for us to cultivate salt-tolerance rice varieties. In this study, we report a WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) gene, quiescent-center-specific homeobox (OsQHB), positively regulates yield-related traits and negatively regulates salt tolerance in rice. Mutation in OsQHB led to a decrease in plant height, tiller number, panicle length, grain length and grain width, and an increase in salt tolerance. Transcriptome and qPCR analysis showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging-related genes were regulated by OsQHB. Moreover, the osqhb mutants have higher ROS-scavenging enzymes activities and lower accumulation of ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) under salt stress. Thus, our findings provide new insights into the role of rice WOX gene family in rice development and salt tolerance, and suggest that OsQHB is a valuable target for improving rice production in environments characterized by salt stress.
NA	Ectopic expression of WOX5 promotes cytokinin signaling and de novo shoot regeneration.	2022	Plant Cell Rep	Department of Chemistry, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Korea.	WOX5 has a potential in activating cytokinin signaling and shoot regeneration, in addition to its role in pluripotency acquisition. Thus, overexpression of WOX5 maximizes plant regeneration capacity during tissue culture. In vitro plant regeneration involves two steps: callus formation and de novo shoot organogenesis. The WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 5 (WOX5) homeodomain transcription factor is known to be mainly expressed during incubation on callus-inducing medium (CIM) and involved in pluripotency acquisition in callus, but whether WOX5 also affects de novo shoot regeneration on cytokinin-rich shoot-inducing medium (SIM) remains unknown. Based on the recent finding that WOX5 promotes cytokinin signaling, we hypothesized that ectopic expression of WOX5 beyond CIM would further enhance overall plant regeneration capacity, because intense cytokinin signaling is particularly required for shoot regeneration on SIM. Here, we found that overexpression of the WOX5 gene on SIM drastically promoted de novo shoot regeneration from callus with the repression of type-A ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR) genes, negative regulators of cytokinin signaling. The enhanced shoot regeneration phenotypes were indeed dependent on cytokinin signaling, which were partially suppressed in the progeny derived from crossing WOX5-overexpressing plants with cytokinin-insensitive 35S:ARR7 plants. The function of WOX5 in enhancing cytokinin-dependent shoot regeneration is evolutionarily conserved, as conditional overexpression of OsWOX5 on SIM profoundly enhanced shoot regeneration in rice callus. Overall, our results provide the technical advance that maximizes in vitro plant regeneration by constitutively expressing WOX5, which unequivocally promotes both callus pluripotency and de novo shoot regeneration.
