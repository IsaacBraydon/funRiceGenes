Low-temperature is one of the most common environmental stress factors that affect plant growth and development and places a major limit on crop productivity in cultivated areas. Previously, qLTG3-1, a major quantitative trait locus controlling low-temperature tolerance at the germination stage in rice (called low-temperature germinability) was identified, which encodes a protein of unknown function. To identify genes targeted by qLTG3-1, a genome-wide expression profiling analysis using the 44 K Rice Oligo microarray was performed. Because the expression of qLTG3-1 was dramatically increased at 1 day after incubation, the expression profiles at this time were compared between Hayamasari, which has a loss-of-function qLTG3-1 allele, and a near isogenic line with a functional allele. A total of 4,587 genes showed significant differences between their expression levels in the two lines. Most of these genes might be involved in the process of seed germination itself, and then a focus was made on qLTG3-1 dependently induced or suppressed genes, defined as 'qLTG3-1 dependent' genes. Twenty-nine 'qLTG3-1 dependent' genes with diverse functions were categorized, implying that disruption of cellular homeostasis leads to a wide range of metabolic alterations and diverse cross-talk between various signaling pathways. In particular, genes involved in defense responses were up-regulated by qLTG3-1, indicating that qLTG3-1 expression is required for the expression of defense response genes in low-temperature germinability in rice.
PNAS-2008-Fujino-12623-8.pdf	Molecular identification of a major quantitative trait locus, qLTG3-1, controlling low-temperature germinability in rice	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Plant Breeding and Production Division, Agricultural Research Institute, HOKUREN Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives, Naganuma, Hokkaido 0691317, Japan. fujino-kenji@hokuren.jp	Tolerance to abiotic stress is an important agronomic trait in crops and is controlled by many genes, which are called quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Identification of these QTLs will contribute not only to the understanding of plant biology but also for plant breeding, to achieve stable crop production around the world. Previously, we mapped three QTLs controlling low-temperature tolerance at the germination stage (called low-temperature germinability). To understand the molecular basis of one of these QTLs, qLTG3-1 (quantitative trait locus for low-temperature germinability on chromosome 3), map-based cloning was performed, and this QTL was shown to be encoded by a protein of unknown function. The QTL qLTG3-1 is strongly expressed in the embryo during seed germination. Before and during seed germination, specific localization of beta-glucuronidase staining in the tissues covering the embryo, which involved the epiblast covering the coleoptile and the aleurone layer of the seed coat, was observed. Expression of qLTG3-1 was tightly associated with vacuolation of the tissues covering the embryo. This may cause tissue weakening, resulting in reduction of the mechanical resistance to the growth potential of the coleoptile. These phenomena are quite similar to the model system of seed germination presented by dicot plants, suggesting that this model may be conserved in both dicot and monocot plants.
NA	Characterization of a New qLTG3-1 Allele for Low-temperature Germinability in Rice<U+00A0>from the<U+00A0>Wild Species Oryza rufipogon.	2020	Rice (N Y)	Department of Agronomy, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, 34134, South Korea.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is generally sensitive to low temperatures, and in production systems that use direct-seeding, low-temperature germinability (LTG) is a desired trait. Previously, the QTLs, qLTG1 and qLTG3, that control LTG, were mapped using the BC4F8 population, which is a cross of Korean elite cultivar Hwaseong and O. rufipogon (IRGC 105491). We have characterized and analyzed the interaction between the two QTLs, by crossing TR20 that has O. rufipogon alleles at qLTG1 and qLTG3 in a Hwaseong background, with Hwaseong, to develop an F2 population.The F2 plants with both qLTG1 and qLTG3 alleles from O. rufipogon showed higher LTG scores, than the plants with only qLTG1 or qLTG3. No significant interaction between the qLTG1 and qLTG3 was observed, indicating that they may regulate LTG via different pathways. Based on its location, qLTG3 appears to be allelic with qLTG3-1, a major QTL known to control LTG. To investigate the genetic differences between the two parents, that were controlling LTG, we compared their qLTG3-1 sequences. In the coding region, three sequence variations leading to amino acid changes were identified between the Hwaseong and O. rufipogon. Of these, a non-synonymous substitution at the 62nd amino acid site, had not previously been reported. To understand the cause of the LTG variations between the parents, we genotyped three sequence variations of qLTG3-1, that were identified in 98 Asian cultivated rice accessions (Oryza sativa L.). The 98 accessions were classified into 5 haplotypes, based on three variations and a 71-bp deletion. Mean low-temperature germination rates were compared among the haplotypes, and haplotype 5 (O. rufipogon-type) showed a significantly higher germination rate than haplotype 2 (Nipponbare-type), and haplotype 3 (Italica Livorno-type).The O. rufipogon qLTG3-1 allele can be utilized for the improvement of LTG in rice breeding programs. Nearly isogenic lines harboring both qLTG1 and qLTG3-1 alleles from O. rufipogon, showed higher LTG scores than the NILs with qLTG1 or qLTG3-1 alone, and the two QTLs regulate LTG via different pathways. To our knowledge, this is the first report to detect a new qLTG3-1 allele and analyze the interaction of the two LTG QTLs in a nearly isogenic background.
