MAS	qCTS-9	A novel functional gene associated with cold tolerance at the seedling stage in rice.	Identification of the functional gene underlying qCTS-9 and development of the gene-specific marker will facilitate molecular breeding for cold tolerance at the seedling stage in rice through transgenic approach and marker-assisted selection (MAS)
