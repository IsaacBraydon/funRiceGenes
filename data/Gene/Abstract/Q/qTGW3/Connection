OsARF21	qTGW3|TGW3|GL3.3|OsGSK5|OsSK41	Auxin signaling module OsSK41-OsIAA10-OsARF regulates grain yield traits in rice.	 To investigate how rice grain yield traits are regulated by auxin signaling pathways and to facilitate their application in rice improvement, we validated the functional relationships among regulatory genes such as OsIAA10, OsSK41, and OsARF21 that are involved in one of the auxin (OsIAA10) signaling pathways
OsARF21	qTGW3|TGW3|GL3.3|OsGSK5|OsSK41	Auxin signaling module OsSK41-OsIAA10-OsARF regulates grain yield traits in rice.	 Based on the results, we constructed a model that showed how grain yield traits were regulated by OsIAA10 and OsTIR1, OsAFB2, and OsSK41 and OsmiR393 in the OsSK41-OsIAA10-OsARF module and by OsARF21 in the transcriptional regulation of downstream auxin response genes in the OsSK41-OsIAA10-OsARF module
OsEBP-89|OsEBP89	qTGW3|TGW3|GL3.3|OsGSK5|OsSK41	The kinase OsSK41/OsGSK5 negatively regulates amylose content in rice endosperm by affecting the interaction between OsEBP89 and OsBP5.	 Here, we determined that the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 5 (OsGSK5, also named SHAGGY-like kinase 41 [OsSK41]) inhibits the transcriptional activation activity of OsEBP89 in rice grains during amylose biosynthesis
