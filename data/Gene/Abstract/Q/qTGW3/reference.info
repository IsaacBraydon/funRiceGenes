NA	A Novel QTL qTGW3 Encodes the GSK3/SHAGGY-Like Kinase OsGSK5/OsSK41 that Interacts with OsARF4 to Negatively Regulate Grain Size and Weight in Rice.	2018	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Crop Physiology, Ecology and Genetic; Jiangxi Super Rice Engineering Technology Research Center, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang 330045, China.	Grain size and shape are important determinants of grain weight and yield in rice. Here, we report a new major quantitative trait locus (QTL), qTGW3, that controls grain size and weight in rice. This locus, qTGW3, encodes OsSK41 (also known as OsGSK5) in the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 3/SHAGGY-like family. Rice near isogenic lines carrying the loss-of-function allele of OsSK41 have increased grain length and weight. We demonstrate that OsSK41 interacts with and phosphorylates AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 4 (OsARF4). Co-expression of OsSK41 with OsARF4 increases the accumulation of OsARF4 in rice protoplasts. Loss-of-function mutation of OsARF4 confers larger rice grains. RNA-Seq analysis suggests that OsARF4 and OsSK41 repress the expression of a common set of downstream genes, including some auxin-responsive genes, during rice grain development. The loss-of-function form of OsSK41 at qTGW3 represents a rare allele that has not been extensively utilized in rice breeding. Suppression of OsSK41 function by either targeted gene editing or QTL pyramiding enhances rice grain size and weight. Thus, our study reveals the important roles of OsSK41 in rice grain development, and provides new candidate genes for genetic improvement of grain yield in rice and perhaps in other cereal crops.
NA	How rice Glycogen Synthase Kinase-like 5 (OsGSK5) integrates salinity stress response to source-sink adaptation: a proposed model.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	a Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science , Khon Kaen University , Khon Kaen 40002 , Thailand.	We have previously shown that overexpression of GSK3-like kinase 5 in rice (OsGSK5) was associated with higher starch accumulation and better growth under severe salinity stress. Short-term (14)CO2 feeding experiments suggested that OsGSK5 promoted higher flux to starch accumulation in the roots under this condition and that this mechanism may help to underscore the better growth characteristics observed. Here, we expand upon this hypothesis and consider (i) how OsGSK5 action could fit into a signaling model that integrates salinity stress to changes in starch metabolism, and (ii) how this would facilitate whole plant physiological adaptions in source-to-sink partitioning. We also discuss additional functions of OsGSK5, necessary to support this adaptive mechanism.
NA	Identification of a novel QTL and candidate gene associated with grain size using chromosome segment substitution lines in rice	2021	Sci Rep	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Rice is one of the staple crops in the world. Grain size is an important determinant of rice grain yield, but the genetic basis of the grain size remains unclear. Here, we report a set of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSL) developed in the genetic background of the genome-sequenced indica cultivar Zhenshan 97. Genotyping of the CSSLs by single nucleotide polymorphism array shows that most carry only one or two segments introduced from the genome-sequenced japonica cultivar Nipponbare. Using this population and the high-density markers, a total of 43 quantitative trait loci were identified for seven panicle- and grain-related traits. Among these loci, the novel locus qGL11 for grain length and thousand-grain weight was validated in a CSSL-derived segregating population and finely mapped to a 25-kb region that contains an IAA-amido synthetase gene OsGH3.13, This gene exhibited a significant expression difference in the young panicle between the near-isogenic lines that carry the contrasting Zhenshan 97 and Nipponbare alleles at qGL11. Expression and sequence analyses suggest that this gene is the most likely candidate for qGL11. Furthermore, several OsGH3.13 mutants induced by a CRISPR/Cas9 approach in either japonica or indica exhibit an increased grain length and thousand-grain weight, thus enhancing the final grain yield per plant. These findings provide insights into the genetic basis of grain size for the improvement of yield potential in rice breeding programs.
NA	The kinase OsSK41/OsGSK5 negatively regulates amylose content in rice endosperm by affecting the interaction between OsEBP89 and OsBP5.	2023	J Integr Plant Biol	Key Laboratory of Germplasm Innovation and Genetic Improvement of Grain and Oil Crops (Co-construction by Ministry and Province), Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shanghai, 201403, China.	Amylose content (AC) is the main factor determining the palatability, viscosity, transparency, and digestibility of rice (Oryza sativa) grains. AC in rice grains is mainly controlled by different alleles of the Waxy (Wx) gene. The AP2/EREBP transcription factor OsEBP89 interacts with the MYC-like protein OsBP5 to synergistically regulate the expression of Wx. Here, we determined that the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 5 (OsGSK5, also named SHAGGY-like kinase 41 [OsSK41]) inhibits the transcriptional activation activity of OsEBP89 in rice grains during amylose biosynthesis. The loss of OsSK41 function enhanced Wx expression and increased AC in rice grains. By contrast, the loss of function of OsEBP89 reduced Wx expression and decreased AC in rice grains. OsSK41 interacts with OsEBP89 and phosphorylates four of its sites (Thr-28, Thr-30, Ser-238, and Thr-257), which makes OsEBP89 unstable and attenuates its interaction with OsBP5. Wx promoter activity was relatively weak when regulated by the phosphomimic variant OsEBP89(E) -OsBP5 but relatively strong when regulated by the nonphosphorylatable variant OsEBP89(A) -OsBP5. Therefore, OsSK41-mediated phosphorylation of OsEBP89 represents an additional layer of complexity in the regulation of amylose biosynthesis during rice grain development. In addition, our findings provide four possible sites for regulating rice grain AC via precise gene editing.
NA	Control of grain size in rice by TGW3 phosphorylation of OsIAA10 through potentiation of OsIAA10-OsARF4-mediated auxin signaling.	2023	Cell Rep	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China; College of Advanced Agricultural Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.	Grain size is a key component of grain yield and quality in crops. Several core players of auxin signaling have been revealed to modulate grain size; however, to date, few genetically defined pathways have been reported, and whether phosphorylation could boost degradation of Aux/IAA proteins is uncertain. Here, we show that TGW3 (also called OsGSK5) interacts with and phosphorylates OsIAA10. Phosphorylation of OsIAA10 facilitates its interaction with OsTIR1 and subsequent destabilization, but this modification hinders its interaction with OsARF4. Our genetic and molecular evidence identifies an OsTIR1-OsIAA10-OsARF4 axis as key for grain size control. In addition, physiological and molecular studies suggest that TGW3 mediates the brassinosteroid response, the effect of which can be relayed through the regulatory axis. Collectively, these findings define a auxin signaling pathway to regulate grain size, in which phosphorylation of OsIAA10 enhances its proteolysis and potentiates OsIAA10-OsARF4-mediated auxin signaling.
