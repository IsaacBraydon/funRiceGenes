NA	A Novel QTL qTGW3 Encodes the GSK3/SHAGGY-Like Kinase OsGSK5/OsSK41 that Interacts with OsARF4 to Negatively Regulate Grain Size and Weight in Rice.	2018	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Crop Physiology, Ecology and Genetic; Jiangxi Super Rice Engineering Technology Research Center, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang 330045, China.	Grain size and shape are important determinants of grain weight and yield in rice. Here, we report a new major quantitative trait locus (QTL), qTGW3, that controls grain size and weight in rice. This locus, qTGW3, encodes OsSK41 (also known as OsGSK5) in the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 3/SHAGGY-like family. Rice near isogenic lines carrying the loss-of-function allele of OsSK41 have increased grain length and weight. We demonstrate that OsSK41 interacts with and phosphorylates AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 4 (OsARF4). Co-expression of OsSK41 with OsARF4 increases the accumulation of OsARF4 in rice protoplasts. Loss-of-function mutation of OsARF4 confers larger rice grains. RNA-Seq analysis suggests that OsARF4 and OsSK41 repress the expression of a common set of downstream genes, including some auxin-responsive genes, during rice grain development. The loss-of-function form of OsSK41 at qTGW3 represents a rare allele that has not been extensively utilized in rice breeding. Suppression of OsSK41 function by either targeted gene editing or QTL pyramiding enhances rice grain size and weight. Thus, our study reveals the important roles of OsSK41 in rice grain development, and provides new candidate genes for genetic improvement of grain yield in rice and perhaps in other cereal crops.
NA	How rice Glycogen Synthase Kinase-like 5 (OsGSK5) integrates salinity stress response to source-sink adaptation: a proposed model.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	a Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science , Khon Kaen University , Khon Kaen 40002 , Thailand.	We have previously shown that overexpression of GSK3-like kinase 5 in rice (OsGSK5) was associated with higher starch accumulation and better growth under severe salinity stress. Short-term (14)CO2 feeding experiments suggested that OsGSK5 promoted higher flux to starch accumulation in the roots under this condition and that this mechanism may help to underscore the better growth characteristics observed. Here, we expand upon this hypothesis and consider (i) how OsGSK5 action could fit into a signaling model that integrates salinity stress to changes in starch metabolism, and (ii) how this would facilitate whole plant physiological adaptions in source-to-sink partitioning. We also discuss additional functions of OsGSK5, necessary to support this adaptive mechanism.
