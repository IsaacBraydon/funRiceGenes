GW7|GL7|SLG7	qGW8|OsSPL16|GW8	The OsSPL16-GW7 regulatory module determines grain shape and simultaneously improves rice yield and grain quality.	OsSPL16 (GW8), an SBP-domain transcription factor that regulates grain width, bound directly to the GW7 promoter and repressed its expression
OsMADS34|PAP2	qGW8|OsSPL16|GW8	Regulatory Role of OsMADS34 in the Determination of Glumes Fate, Grain Yield, and Quality in Rice.	Interesting, transcriptional activity analysis revealed that OsMADS34 protein was a transcription repressor and it may influence grain yield by suppressing the expressions of BG1, GW8, GW2, and GL7 in the m34-z mutant
