GW7|GL7|SLG7	qGW8|OsSPL16|GW8	The OsSPL16-GW7 regulatory module determines grain shape and simultaneously improves rice yield and grain quality.	OsSPL16 (GW8), an SBP-domain transcription factor that regulates grain width, bound directly to the GW7 promoter and repressed its expression
OsMADS34|PAP2	qGW8|OsSPL16|GW8	Regulatory Role of OsMADS34 in the Determination of Glumes Fate, Grain Yield, and Quality in Rice.	Interesting, transcriptional activity analysis revealed that OsMADS34 protein was a transcription repressor and it may influence grain yield by suppressing the expressions of BG1, GW8, GW2, and GL7 in the m34-z mutant
OsNF-YC10	qGW8|OsSPL16|GW8	OsNF-YC10, a seed preferentially expressed gene regulates grain width by affecting cell proliferation in rice.	 OsNF-YC10 was further revealed to influence the expression of GW8 (a positive regulator of grain width), GW7 (a negative regulator of grain width) and cell cycle-regulated genes CYCD4, CYCA2
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	qGW8|OsSPL16|GW8	MiR529a controls plant height, tiller number, panicle architecture and grain size by regulating SPL target genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 And panicle architecture and grain size were controlled by miR529a through altering the expression of all five target genes OsSPL2, OsSPL7, OsSPL14, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18
OsSPL18	qGW8|OsSPL16|GW8	MiR529a controls plant height, tiller number, panicle architecture and grain size by regulating SPL target genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 And panicle architecture and grain size were controlled by miR529a through altering the expression of all five target genes OsSPL2, OsSPL7, OsSPL14, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18
OsSPL7	qGW8|OsSPL16|GW8	MiR529a controls plant height, tiller number, panicle architecture and grain size by regulating SPL target genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 And panicle architecture and grain size were controlled by miR529a through altering the expression of all five target genes OsSPL2, OsSPL7, OsSPL14, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18
DEP3	qGW8|OsSPL16|GW8	OrMKK3 Influences Morphology and Grain Size in Rice	 Overexpression of OrMKK3 influenced the expression levels of the grain size-related genes SMG1, GW8, GL3, GW2, and DEP3
GW2|OsGW2	qGW8|OsSPL16|GW8	OrMKK3 Influences Morphology and Grain Size in Rice	 Overexpression of OrMKK3 influenced the expression levels of the grain size-related genes SMG1, GW8, GL3, GW2, and DEP3
GIF1|OsCIN2|OsGIF1|WB1	qGW8|OsSPL16|GW8	Natural Variation in OsMKK3 Contributes to Grain Size and Chalkiness in Rice.	 We showed that OsSPL16, GS5, and GIF1 have a substantial effect on the OsMKK3-regulated grain size pathway
GS5	qGW8|OsSPL16|GW8	Natural Variation in OsMKK3 Contributes to Grain Size and Chalkiness in Rice.	 We showed that OsSPL16, GS5, and GIF1 have a substantial effect on the OsMKK3-regulated grain size pathway
HOS59	qGW8|OsSPL16|GW8	KNOX II transcription factor HOS59 functions in regulating rice grain size.	 Meanwhile, our IP-MS datasets showed that HOS59 was closely associated with BELL family proteins, some grain size regulators (OsSPL13, OsSPL16, OsSPL18, SLG, etc
