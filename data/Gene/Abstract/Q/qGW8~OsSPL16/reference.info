Grain size and shape are important components of grain yield and quality and have been under selection since cereals were first domesticated. Here, we show that a quantitative trait locus GW8 is synonymous with OsSPL16, which encodes a protein that is a positive regulator of cell proliferation. Higher expression of this gene promotes cell division and grain filling, with positive consequences for grain width and yield in rice. Conversely, a loss-of-function mutation in Basmati rice is associated with the formation of a more slender grain and better quality of appearance. The correlation between grain size and allelic variation at the GW8 locus suggests that mutations within the promoter region were likely selected in rice breeding programs. We also show that a marker-assisted strategy targeted at elite alleles of GS3 and OsSPL16 underlying grain size and shape can be effectively used to simultaneously improve grain quality and yield.
NA	MiR529a controls plant height, tiller number, panicle architecture and grain size by regulating SPL target genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2021	Plant Sci	Institute of Crop Science, Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Crop Germplasm, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world. Breeding high-yield, multi-resistant and high-quality varieties has always been the goal of rice breeding. Rice tiller, panicle architecture and grain size are the constituent factors of yield, which are regulated by both genetic and environmental factors, including miRNAs, transcription factors, and downstream target genes. Previous studies have shown that SPL (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING-LIKE) transcription factors can control rice tiller, panicle architecture and grain size, which were regulated by miR156, miR529 and miR535. In this study, we obtained miR529a target mimicry (miR529a-MIMIC) transgenic plants to investigate plant phenotypes, physiological and molecular characteristics together with miR529a overexpression (miR529a-OE) and wild type (WT) to explore the function of miR529a and its SPL target genes in rice. We found that OsSPL2, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18 at seedling stage were regulated by miR529a, but there had complicated mechanism to control plant height. OsSPL2, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and SPL18 at tillering stage were regulated by miR529a to control plant height and tiller number. And panicle architecture and grain size were controlled by miR529a through altering the expression of all five target genes OsSPL2, OsSPL7, OsSPL14, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18. Our study suggested that miR529a might control rice growth and development by regulating different SPL target genes at different stages, which could provide a new method to improve rice yield by regulating miR529a and its SPL target genes.
NA	OrMKK3 Influences Morphology and Grain Size in Rice	2021	J Plant Biol	Rice Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences/Guangxi Key Laboratory of Rice Genetics and Breeding, Nanning, 530007 China.	Although morphology and grain size are important to rice growth and yield, the identity of abundant natural allelic variations that determine agronomically important differences in crops is unknown. Here, we characterized the function of mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 from Oryza officinalis Wall. ex Watt encoded by OrMKK3. Different alternative splicing variants occurred in OrMKK3. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-OrMKK3 fusion proteins localized to the cell membrane and nuclei of rice protoplasts. Overexpression of OrMKK3 influenced the expression levels of the grain size-related genes SMG1, GW8, GL3, GW2, and DEP3. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OrMKK3 is well conserved in plants while showing large amounts of variation between indica, japonica, and wild rice. In addition, OrMKK3 slightly influenced brassinosteroid (BR) responses and the expression levels of BR-related genes. Our findings thus identify a new gene, OrMKK3, influencing morphology and grain size and that represents a possible link between mitogen-activated protein kinase and BR response pathways in grain growth.
NA	Bin-based genome-wide association studies reveal superior alleles for improvement of appearance quality using a 4-way MAGIC population in rice	2020	J Adv Res	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agriculture University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Introduction: The multiparental population provides us the chance to identify superior alleles controlling a trait for genetic improvement. Genome wide association studies at bin level (bin-GWAS) are expected to be more power in QTL mapping than GWAS at SNP level (SNP-GWAS).  Objectives: This study is to estimate genetic effects of QTL conferring grain appearance quality in rice by SNP-GWAS and bin-GWAS, compare their power in QTL mapping and identify the superior alleles of all detected QTL from 4 parents for genetic improvement.  Methods: A 4-way MAGIC population and its four founders were cultivated in two environments to dissect the genetic basis of rice grain appearance quality. Both SNP-GWAS and bin-GWAS were conducted for QTL mapping. Multiple comparison among 4 parental bin/alleles was used to identify the superior alleles.  Results: A total of 16 and 20 QTL associated with grain appearance quality were identified by SNP- and bin-GWAS, respectively. A minor chalkiness QTL qPGWC8.2/qDEC8 was assigned to a 30-kb genomic region, in which OsMH_08T0121900 is the potential candidate gene because its encoded protein, glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase precursor is involved in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway. The superior parental alleles for GS3, GL3.1, GW5, GW7, and Chalk5 and two QTLs were almost carried by the high-quality parents Cypress and Yuejingsimiao (YJSM), while the poor-quality parent Guichao-2 (GC2) always carried the inferior alleles. The top five recombinant inbred lines with the highest quality of grain shape and chalkiness traits all carried gene combinations of superior alleles.  Conclusions: Both SNP- and bin-GWAS methods are encouraged for joint QTL mapping with MAGIC population. qPGWC8.2/qDEC8 is a novel candidate gene strongly associated with chalkiness. The superior alleles of GS3, GW5, GL3.1, GW7, Chalk5 and qPGWC8.2 were identified, and the pyramiding of these superior alleles is helpful to improve rice appearance quality.
NA	Programmed Editing of Rice ( Oryza sativa L.) OsSPL16 Gene Using CRISPR/Cas9 Improves Grain Yield by Modulating the Expression of Pyruvate Enzymes and Cell Cycle Proteins	2020	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, College of Agriculture, Guangxi University, Nanning 530004, China.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the major crops in the world and significant increase in grain yield is constant demand for breeders to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population. The size of grains is one of major components determining rice yield and a vital trait for domestication and breeding. To increase the grain size in rice, OsSPL16/qGW8 was mutagenized through CRISPR/Cas9, and proteomic analysis was performed to reveal variations triggered by mutations. More specifically, mutants were generated with two separate guide RNAs targeting recognition sites on opposite strands and genomic insertions and deletions were characterized. Mutations followed Mendelian inheritance and homozygous and heterozygous mutants lacking any T-DNA and off-target effects were screened. The mutant lines showed a significant increase in grain yield without any change in other agronomic traits in T0, T1, and T2 generations. Proteomic screening found a total of 44 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), out of which 33 and 11 were up and downregulated, respectively. Most of the DEPs related to pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and cell division and proliferation were upregulated in the mutant plants. Pathway analysis revealed that DEPs were enriched in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, carbon metabolism, ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis, and citrate cycle. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis presented that most of the DEPs were involved in the pyruvate metabolic process and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Proteins related to pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit alpha-1 displayed higher interaction in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Thus, the overall results revealed that CRISPR/Cas9-guided OsSPL16 mutations have the potential to boost the grain yield of rice. Additionally, global proteome analysis has broad applications for discovering molecular components and dynamic regulation underlying the targeted gene mutations.
NA	Natural Variation in OsMKK3 Contributes to Grain Size and Chalkiness in Rice.	2021	Front Plant Sci	Guangxi Key Laboratory of Rice Genetics and Breeding, Rice Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanning, China.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important staple food crop for more than half of the world&#39;s population. Enhancing the grain quality and yield of rice to meet growing demand remains a major challenge. Here, we show that OsMKK3 encode a MAP kinase kinase that controls grain size and chalkiness by affecting cell proliferation in spikelet hulls. We showed that OsSPL16, GS5, and GIF1 have a substantial effect on the OsMKK3-regulated grain size pathway. OsMKK3 has experienced strong directional selection in indica and japonica. Wild rice accessions contained four OsMKK3 haplotypes, suggesting that the OsMKK3 haplotypes present in cultivated rice likely originated from different wild rice accessions during rice domestication. OsMKK3-Hap1, gs3, and gw8 were polymerized to enhance the grain length. Polymerization of beneficial alleles, such as OsMKK3-Hap1, gs3, gw8, fgr, alk, chalk5, and wx, also improved the quality of hybrid rice. Overall, the results indicated that beneficial OsMKK3 alleles could be used for genomic-assisted breeding for rice cultivar improvement and be polymerized with other beneficial alleles.
