qSH1|RIL1	shattering	Selection on grain shattering genes and rates of rice domestication	Here, we studied nucleotide variation at the shattering loci, sh4 and qSH1, for cultivated rice, Oryza sativa ssp
qSH1|RIL1	shattering	An SNP caused loss of seed shattering during rice domestication	We revealed that the qSH1 gene, a major quantitative trait locus of seed shattering in rice, encodes a BEL1-type homeobox gene and demonstrated that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5' regulatory region of the qSH1 gene caused loss of seed shattering owing to the absence of abscission layer formation

qSH1|RIL1	 awn 	Genomewide association analysis for awn length linked to the seed shattering gene qSH1 in rice.	Genomewide association analysis for awn length linked to the seed shattering gene qSH1 in rice.
qSH1|RIL1	seed	Genomewide association analysis for awn length linked to the seed shattering gene qSH1 in rice.	Genomewide association analysis for awn length linked to the seed shattering gene qSH1 in rice.
qSH1|RIL1	seed	Genomewide association analysis for awn length linked to the seed shattering gene qSH1 in rice.	Special interest was the detection of the most significant association SNP, sf0136352825, which was less than 95 kb from the seed shattering gene qSH1

qSH1|RIL1	shoot	BELL1-like homeobox genes regulate inflorescence architecture and meristem maintenance in rice.	 In addition, both RI and RIL1 seem to be involved in meristem maintenance, because the ri ril1 double mutant failed to establish or maintain the shoot apical meristem during embryogenesis
qSH1|RIL1	meristem	BELL1-like homeobox genes regulate inflorescence architecture and meristem maintenance in rice.	 In addition, both RI and RIL1 seem to be involved in meristem maintenance, because the ri ril1 double mutant failed to establish or maintain the shoot apical meristem during embryogenesis
qSH1|RIL1	shoot apical meristem	BELL1-like homeobox genes regulate inflorescence architecture and meristem maintenance in rice.	 In addition, both RI and RIL1 seem to be involved in meristem maintenance, because the ri ril1 double mutant failed to establish or maintain the shoot apical meristem during embryogenesis
