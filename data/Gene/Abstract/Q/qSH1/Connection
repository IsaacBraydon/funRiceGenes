qSH1|RIL1	sh4|SHA1|SG5	Selection on grain shattering genes and rates of rice domestication	Here, we studied nucleotide variation at the shattering loci, sh4 and qSH1, for cultivated rice, Oryza sativa ssp
qSH1|RIL1	SH5|RI	The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis	Os05 g38120 (SH5) on chromosome 5 is highly homologous to qSH1
D6|OSH15|Oskn3|RLB	qSH1|RIL1	KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes.	 Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that OSH15 interacts with SH5 and qSH1, two proteins in the BELL homeobox family
OsSh1	qSH1|RIL1	Direct identification of a mutation in OsSh1 causing non-shattering in a rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant cultivar using whole-genome resequencing	 Furthermore, gene expression analysis suggests that OsSh1 may function downstream of qSH1, a known key gene involved in abscission zone differentiation
qSH1|RIL1	RHS1	A Novel RHS1 Locus in Rice Attributes Seed-Pod Shattering by the Regulation of Endogenous S-Nitrosothiols.	 Interestingly, the basal expression levels of QSH1 and SHAT1 genes (transcription factors that regulate seed-pod shattering in rice) were significantly lower in these plants than in wild-type plants; however, nitrosative stress negatively regulated the expression of QSH1 and SHAT1 in both WT and rhs1 plants, but positively regulated QSH4 expression in rhs1 plants alone
