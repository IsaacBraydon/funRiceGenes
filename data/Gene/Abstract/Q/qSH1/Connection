qSH1	sh4|SHA1	Selection on grain shattering genes and rates of rice domestication	Here, we studied nucleotide variation at the shattering loci, sh4 and qSH1, for cultivated rice, Oryza sativa ssp
qSH1	SH5|RI	The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis	Os05 g38120 (SH5) on chromosome 5 is highly homologous to qSH1
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	qSH1	KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes.	 Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that OSH15 interacts with SH5 and qSH1, two proteins in the BELL homeobox family
