qSH1	sh4|SHA1	Selection on grain shattering genes and rates of rice domestication	 Here, we studied nucleotide variation at the shattering loci, sh4 and qSH1, for cultivated rice, Oryza sativa ssp
qSH1	SH5	The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis	Os05 g38120 (SH5) on chromosome 5 is highly homologous to qSH1
