1392.full.pdf	An SNP caused loss of seed shattering during rice domestication	2006	Science	Institute of the Society for Techno-Innovation of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, 446-1 Ippaizuka, Kamiyokoba Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0854, Japan.	Loss of seed shattering was a key event in the domestication of major cereals. We revealed that the qSH1 gene, a major quantitative trait locus of seed shattering in rice, encodes a BEL1-type homeobox gene and demonstrated that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5' regulatory region of the qSH1 gene caused loss of seed shattering owing to the absence of abscission layer formation. Haplotype analysis and association analysis in various rice collections revealed that the SNP was highly associated with shattering among japonica subspecies of rice, implying that it was a target of artificial selection during rice domestication.

Molecular cloning of major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for the reduction of rice grain shattering, a hallmark of cereal domestication, provided opportunities for in-depth investigation of domestication processes. Here, we studied nucleotide variation at the shattering loci, sh4 and qSH1, for cultivated rice, Oryza sativa ssp. indica and Oryza sativa ssp. japonica, and the wild progenitors, Oryza nivara andOryza rufipogon. The nonshattering sh4 allele was fixed in all rice cultivars, with levels of sequence polymorphism significantly reduced in both indica and japonica cultivars relative to the wild progenitors. The sh4 phylogeny together with the neutrality tests and coalescent simulations suggested that sh4 had a single origin and was fixed by artificial selection during the domestication of rice. Selection on qSH1 was not detected in indica and remained unclear in japonica. Selection on sh4 could be strong enough to have driven its fixation in a population of cultivated rice within a period of c. 100 yr. The slow fixation of the nonshattering phenotype observed at the archeological sites might be a result of relatively weak selection on mutations other than sh4 in early rice cultivation. The fixation of sh4 could have been achieved later through strong selection for the optimal phenotype.
NA	Genomewide association analysis for awn length linked to the seed shattering gene qSH1 in rice.	2016	J Genet	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, People's Republic of China.a020809@webmail.hzau.edu.cn.	Awn is one of the most important domesticated traits in rice (Oryza sativa). Understanding the genetic basis of awn length is important for grain harvest and production, because long awn length is disadvantageous for both grain harvest and milling. We investigated the awn length of 529 rice cultivars and performed a Genomewide association studies (GWAS) in the indica and japonica subpopulations, and the whole population. In total, we found 17 loci associated with awn length. Of these loci, seven were linked to previously reported quantitative trait loci, and one was linked to the awn gene An-1. Nine novel loci were repeatedly identified in different environments. One of the nine associations was identified in both the whole and japonica populations. Special interest was the detection of the most significant association SNP, sf0136352825, which was less than 95 kb from the seed shattering gene qSH1. These results may provide potentially favourable haplotypes for molecular breeding in rice.
NA	BELL1-like homeobox genes regulate inflorescence architecture and meristem maintenance in rice.	2019	Plant J	Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan.	Inflorescence architecture is diverse in angiosperms and is mainly determined by the arrangement of the branches and flowers, known as phyllotaxy. In rice (Oryza sativa), the main inflorescence axis, called the rachis, generates primary branches in a spiral phyllotaxy, and flowers (spikelets) are formed on these branches. Here, we have studied a classical mutant, named verticillate rachis (ri), which produces branches in a partially whorled phyllotaxy. Gene isolation revealed that RI encodes a BELL1-type homeodomain transcription factor, similar to Arabidopsis PENNYWISE/ BELLRINGER/REPLUMLESS, and is expressed in the specific regions within the inflorescence and branch meristems where their descendant meristems would soon initiate. Genetic combination of an ri homozygote and a mutant allele of RI-LIKE1 (RIL1) (designated ri ril1/+ plant), a close paralog of RI, enhanced the ri inflorescence phenotype, including the abnormalities in branch phyllotaxy and rachis internode patterning. During early inflorescence development, the timing and arrangement of primary branch meristem (pBM) initiation was disturbed in both ri and ri ril1/+ plants. These findings suggest that RI and RIL1 involved in regulating the phyllotactic pattern of the pBMs to form normal inflorescences. In addition, both RI and RIL1 seem to be involved in meristem maintenance, because the ri ril1 double mutant failed to establish or maintain the shoot apical meristem during embryogenesis.
