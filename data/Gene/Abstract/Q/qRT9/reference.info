Breeding for strong root systems is an important strategy for improving drought avoidance in rice. To clone genes responsible for strong root traits, an upland rice introgression line IL392 with thicker and longer roots than the background parent lowland rice Yuefu was selected. A quantitative trait locus (QTL), qRT9, controlling root thickness and root length was detected under hydroponic culture using 203 F2:3 populations derived from a cross between Yuefu and IL392. The qRT9 locus explained 32.5% and 28.1% of the variance for root thickness and root length, respectively. Using 3185 F2 plants, qRT9 was ultimately narrowed down to an 11.5kb region by substitution mapping. One putative basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor gene, LOC_Os09g28210 (named OsbHLH120), is annotated in this region. Sequences of OsbHLH120 in 11 upland rice and 13 lowland rice indicated that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 82 and an insertion/deletion (Indel) at position 628-642 cause amino acid changes and are conserved between upland rice and lowland rice. Phenotypic analysis indicated that the two polymorphisms were significantly associated with root thickness and root length under hydroponic culture. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that OsbHLH120 was strongly induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG), salt, and abscisic acid, but higher expression was present in IL392 roots than in Yuefu under PEG and salt stress. The successfully isolated locus, qRT9, enriches our knowledge of the genetic basis for drought avoidance and provides an opportunity for breeding drought avoidance varieties by utilizing valuable genes in the upland rice germplasm.
