qCdT7|OsHMA3	Overexpression of OsHMA3 enhances Cd tolerance and expression of Zn transporter genes in rice. |  Overexpression of OsHMA3 selectively reduces Cd accumulation in the grain |  Further characterization in the present study revealed that overexpression of OsHMA3 also enhances the tolerance to toxic Cd |  The overexpressed line showed higher Cd concentration in the roots, but lower Cd concentration in the shoots compared with the wild-type rice and vector control line, indicating that overexpression of OsHMA3 enhanced vacuolar sequestration of Cd in the roots |  Taken together, overexpression of OsHMA3 is an efficient way to reduce Cd accumulation in the grain and to enhance Cd tolerance in rice	Overexpression of OsHMA3 enhances Cd tolerance and expression of Zn transporter genes in rice. |  Overexpression of OsHMA3 selectively reduces Cd accumulation in the grain |  Further characterization in the present study revealed that overexpression of OsHMA3 also enhances the tolerance to toxic Cd |  The overexpressed line showed higher Cd concentration in the roots, but lower Cd concentration in the shoots compared with the wild-type rice and vector control line, indicating that overexpression of OsHMA3 enhanced vacuolar sequestration of Cd in the roots |  Taken together, overexpression of OsHMA3 is an efficient way to reduce Cd accumulation in the grain and to enhance Cd tolerance in rice
qCdT7|OsHMA3	 Overexpression of functional OsHMA3 in rice greatly alleviated the inhibitory effect of Cd, but the protective effect of OsHMA3 was abolished by the auxin polar transport inhibitor 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid	 Overexpression of functional OsHMA3 in rice greatly alleviated the inhibitory effect of Cd, but the protective effect of OsHMA3 was abolished by the auxin polar transport inhibitor 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid
