1-s2.0-S0014579314000660-main.pdf	Functional analysis of the C-terminal region of the vacuolar cadmium-transporting rice OsHMA3	2014	FEBS Lett	Graduate School of Bioresource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University, Kaidoubata-Nishi 241-438, Shimoshinjyo-Nakano, Akita 010-0195, Japan.	Rice OsHMA3 is a vacuolar cadmium (Cd) transporter belonging to the P1B-ATPase family and has a long (273aa) C-terminal region. We analyzed the function of the region related to Cd using the transgenic Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype, which is sensitive to Cd. The OsHMA3 variant containing a truncated (58aa) C-terminal region did not confer Cd tolerance, whereas an OsHMA3 variant containing a longer truncated (105aa) C-terminal region conferred Cd tolerance to transgenic Arabidopsis. We conclude that the C-terminal region, particularly the region containing the first 105aa, has an important role in OsHMA3 activity.
1-s2.0-S1360138505002050-main.pdf	P(1B)-ATPases--an ancient family of transition metal pumps with diverse functions in plants	2005	Trends Plant Sci	School of Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK SO16 7PX. lew@soton.ac.uk	P(1B)-ATPases form a distinct evolutionary sub-family of P-type ATPases, transporting transition metals such as Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb and Co across membranes in a wide range of organisms, including plants. Structurally they are distinct from other P-types, possessing eight transmembrane helices, a CPx/SPC motif in transmembrane domain six, and putative transition metal-binding domains at the N- and/or C-termini. Arabidopsis has eight P(1B)-ATPases (AtHMA1-AtHMA8), which differ in their structure, function and regulation. They perform a variety of important physiological tasks relating to transition metal transport and homeostasis. The crucial roles of plant P(1B)-ATPases in micronutrient nutrition, delivery of essential metals to target proteins, and toxic metal detoxification are discussed.
55512192.pdf	OsHMA3, a P1B-type of ATPase affects root-to-shoot cadmium translocation in rice by mediating efflux into vacuoles	2011	New Phytol	Department of Biological Production, Faculty of Bioresource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University, Shimoshinjyo-Nakano, Akita, Japan.	* The cadmium (Cd) over-accumulating rice (Oryza sativa) cv Cho-Ko-Koku was previously shown to have an enhanced rate of root-to-shoot Cd translocation. This trait is controlled by a single recessive allele located at qCdT7. * In this study, using positional cloning and transgenic strategies, heavy metal ATPase 3 (OsHMA3) was identified as the gene that controls root-to-shoot Cd translocation rates. The subcellular localization and Cd-transporting activity of the gene products were also investigated. * The allele of OsHMA3 that confers high root-to-shoot Cd translocation rates (OsHMA3mc) encodes a defective P(1B) -ATPase transporter. OsHMA3 fused to green fluorescent protein was localized to vacuolar membranes in plants and yeast. An OsHMA3 transgene complemented Cd sensitivity in a yeast mutant that lacks the ability to transport Cd into vacuoles. By contrast, OsHMA3mc did not complement the Cd sensitivity of this yeast mutant, indicating that the OsHMA3mc transport function was lost. * We propose that the root cell cytoplasm of Cd-overaccumulating rice plants has more Cd available for loading into the xylem as a result of the lack of OsHMA3-mediated transportation of Cd to the vacuoles. This defect results in Cd translocation to the shoots in higher concentrations. These data demonstrate the importance of vacuolar sequestration for Cd accumulation in rice.
J. Exp. Bot.-2011-Ueno-2265-72.pdf	Physiological, genetic, and molecular characterization of a high-Cd-accumulating rice cultivar, Jarjan	2011	J Exp Bot	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Chuo 2-20-1, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan.	Cadmium (Cd) in rice is a major source of Cd intake for people on a staple rice diet. The mechanisms underlying Cd accumulation in rice plant are still poorly understood. Here, we characterized the physiology and genetics of Cd transport in a high-Cd-accumulating cultivar (Jarjan) of rice (Oryza sativa). Jarjan showed 5- to 34-fold higher Cd accumulation in the shoots and grains than the cultivar Nipponbare, when it was grown in either a non-Cd-contaminated or a Cd-contaminated soil. A short-term uptake experiment showed no significant difference in Cd uptake by the roots between the two cultivars. However, Jarjan translocated 49% of the total Cd taken up to the shoots, whereas Nipponbare retained most of the Cd in the roots. In both concentration- and time-dependent experiments, Jarjan showed a superior capacity for root-to-shoot translocation of Cd. These results indicate that the high-Cd-accumulation phenotype in Jarjan results from efficient translocation of Cd from roots to shoots. Genetic analysis using an F(2) population derived from Jarjan and Nipponbare revealed that plants showing high- and low-Cd-accumulation phenotypes segregated in a 1:3 ratio, indicating that high accumulation in Jarjan is controlled by a single recessive gene. Furthermore, we isolated OsHMA3, a gene encoding a tonoplast-localized Cd transporter from Jarjan. The OsHMA3 protein was localized in all roots cells, but the sequence has a mutation leading to loss of function. Therefore, failure to sequester Cd into the root vacuoles by OsHMA3 is probably responsible for high Cd accumulation in Jarjan.
PNAS-2010-Ueno-16500-5.pdf	Gene limiting cadmium accumulation in rice	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan.	Intake of toxic cadmium (Cd) from rice caused Itai-itai disease in the past and it is still a threat for human health. Therefore, control of the accumulation of Cd from soil is an important food-safety issue, but the molecular mechanism for the control is unknown. Herein, we report a gene (OsHMA3) responsible for low Cd accumulation in rice that was isolated from a mapping population derived from a cross between a high and low Cd-accumulating cultivar. The gene encodes a transporter belonging to the P(1B)-type ATPase family, but shares low similarity with other members. Heterologous expression in yeast showed that the transporter from the low-Cd cultivar is functional, but the transporter from the high-Cd cultivar had lost its function, probably because of the single amino acid mutation. The transporter is mainly expressed in the tonoplast of root cells at a similar level in both the low and high Cd-accumulating cultivars. Overexpression of the functional gene from the low Cd-accumulating cultivar selectively decreased accumulation of Cd, but not other micronutrients in the grain. Our results indicated that OsHMA3 from the low Cd-accumulating cultivar limits translocation of Cd from the roots to the above-ground tissues by selectively sequestrating Cd into the root vacuoles.

The heavy metal cadmium (Cd) is highly toxic to humans and can enter food chains from contaminated crop fields. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of Cd accumulation in crop species will aid production of safe Cd-free food. Here, we identified a single recessive gene that allowed higher Cd translocation in rice, and also determined the chromosomal location of the gene. The Cd hyperaccumulator rice variety Cho-Ko-Koku showed 3.5-fold greater Cd translocation than the no-accumulating variety Akita 63 under hydroponics. Analysis of an F(2) population derived from these cultivars gave a 1:3 segregation ratio for high:low Cd translocation. This indicates that a single recessive gene controls the high Cd translocation phenotype. A QTL analysis identified a single QTL, qCdT7, located on chromosome 7. On a Cd-contaminated field, Cd accumulation in the F(2) population showed continuous variation with considerable transgression. Three QTLs for Cd accumulation were identified and the peak of the most effective QTL mapped to the same region as qCdT7. Our data indicate that Cd translocation mediated by the gene on qCdT7 plays an important role in Cd accumulation on contaminated soil.
