DRO1	qSOR1	Root angle modifications by the DRO1 homolog improve rice yields in saline paddy fields	 qSOR1 was found to be a homolog of DRO1 (DEEPER ROOTING 1), which is known to control RGA
DRO1	qSOR1	Root angle modifications by the DRO1 homolog improve rice yields in saline paddy fields	 Introgression lines with combinations of gain-of-function and loss-of-function alleles in qSOR1 and DRO1 demonstrated four different RSAs (ultra-shallow, shallow, intermediate, and deep rooting), suggesting that natural alleles of the DRO1 homologs could be utilized to control RSA variations in rice
