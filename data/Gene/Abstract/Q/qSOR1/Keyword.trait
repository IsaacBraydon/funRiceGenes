qSOR1	gravitropic response	Root angle modifications by the DRO1 homolog improve rice yields in saline paddy fields	 qSOR1 is negatively regulated by auxin, predominantly expressed in root columella cells, and involved in the gravitropic responses of roots
qSOR1	root	Root angle modifications by the DRO1 homolog improve rice yields in saline paddy fields	 Here, we have demonstrated, through the cloning and characterization of qSOR1 (quantitative trait locus for SOIL SURFACE ROOTING 1), that a shallower root growth angle (RGA) could enhance rice yields in saline paddies
