Z15	temperature	Zebra leaf 15, a receptor-like protein kinase involved in moderate low temperature signaling pathway in rice.	 The expression of Z15 is induced by moderate low temperature (18<U+2009>°„C)
Z15	temperature	Zebra leaf 15, a receptor-like protein kinase involved in moderate low temperature signaling pathway in rice.	 The mutation of Z15 influenced the expression of two downstream genes, OsWRKY71 and OsMYB4, that were responsive to moderate low temperature
Z15	temperature	Zebra leaf 15, a receptor-like protein kinase involved in moderate low temperature signaling pathway in rice.	 The results show that Z15 plays a crucial role in the early stages of the response to moderate low temperature in rice
Z15	temperature	Zebra leaf 15, a receptor-like protein kinase involved in moderate low temperature signaling pathway in rice.	 Further study indiceted that Z15 plays a crucial role in the early stages of the response to moderate low temperature in rice
Z15	plasma membrane	Zebra leaf 15, a receptor-like protein kinase involved in moderate low temperature signaling pathway in rice.	 Subcellular localization analysis indicates that Z15 and z15 are localized on the plasma membrane
