ZFP179	salt stress	Functional analysis of a novel Cys2/His2-type zinc finger protein involved in salt tolerance in rice	" The ZFP179 transgenic rice exhibited significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging ability, and expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including OsDREB2A, OsP5CS OsProT, and OsLea3 under salt stress
ZFP179	salt stress	Functional analysis of a novel Cys2/His2-type zinc finger protein involved in salt tolerance in rice	 Our studies suggest that ZFP179 plays a crucial role in the plant response to salt stress, and is useful in developing transgenic crops with enhanced tolerance to salt stress"
ZFP179	 ABA 	Functional analysis of a novel Cys2/His2-type zinc finger protein involved in salt tolerance in rice	 The real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that ZFP179 was highly expressed in immature spikes, and markedly induced in the seedlings by NaCl, PEG 6000, and ABA treatments
ZFP179	seedling	Functional analysis of a novel Cys2/His2-type zinc finger protein involved in salt tolerance in rice	 Through microarray analysis, a salt-responsive zinc finger protein gene ZFP179 was identified and subsequently cloned from rice seedlings
