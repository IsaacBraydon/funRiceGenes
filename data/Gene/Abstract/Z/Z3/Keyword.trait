Z3	leaf	The rice zebra3 (z3) mutation disrupts citrate distribution and produces transverse dark-green/green variegation in mature leaves.	These results suggest that leaf variegation in the z3 mutant is caused by an unbalanced accumulation of citrate in a transverse pattern in the leaves
Z3	leaf	The rice zebra3 (z3) mutation disrupts citrate distribution and produces transverse dark-green/green variegation in mature leaves.	 Taking these results together, we propose that Z3 plays an important role in citrate transport and distribution during leaf development and is a possible candidate for a CitMHS family member in plants

Z3	map-based cloning	The rice zebra3 (z3) mutation disrupts citrate distribution and produces transverse dark-green/green variegation in mature leaves.	Map-based cloning revealed that the Z3 locus encodes a putative citrate transporter that belongs to the citrate-metal hydrogen symport (CitMHS) family
Z3	transporter	The rice zebra3 (z3) mutation disrupts citrate distribution and produces transverse dark-green/green variegation in mature leaves.	Map-based cloning revealed that the Z3 locus encodes a putative citrate transporter that belongs to the citrate-metal hydrogen symport (CitMHS) family
Z3	transporter	The rice zebra3 (z3) mutation disrupts citrate distribution and produces transverse dark-green/green variegation in mature leaves.	 To investigate whether Z3 acts as a citrate transporter in rice, we measured citrate levels in wild-type leaves and in the dark-green and green sectors of the leaves of z3 mutants
