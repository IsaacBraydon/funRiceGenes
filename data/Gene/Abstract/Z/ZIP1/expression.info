OsZIP1	 Expression of OsZIP-GFP fusion in rice protoplasts and tobacco leaves shows that OsZIP1 resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) |  The yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) complementation test shows that expression of OsZIP1 reduced Zn accumulation	 In contrast, both oszip1 mutant and RNA interference (RNAi) lines accumulated more metal in roots and contributed to metal sensitive phenotypes
