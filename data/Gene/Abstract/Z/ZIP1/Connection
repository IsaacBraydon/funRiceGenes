OsZIP1	ZN	OsZIP1 functions as a metal efflux transporter limiting excess zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation in rice.	In this report, we provided evidence that OsZIP1 is a metal-detoxified transporter through preventing excess Zn, Cu and Cd accumulation in rice
OsZIP1	ZN	OsZIP1 functions as a metal efflux transporter limiting excess zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation in rice.	 OsZIP1 is abundantly expressed in roots throughout the life span and sufficiently induced by excess Zn, Cu and Cd but not by Mn and Fe at transcriptional and translational levels
OsZIP1	ZN	OsZIP1 functions as a metal efflux transporter limiting excess zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation in rice.	 The yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) complementation test shows that expression of OsZIP1 reduced Zn accumulation
OsZIP1	ZN	OsZIP1 functions as a metal efflux transporter limiting excess zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation in rice.	 These results suggest OsZIP1 is able to function as a metal exporter in rice when Zn, Cu and Cd are excess in environment
OsZIP1	ZN	OsZIP1 functions as a metal efflux transporter limiting excess zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation in rice.	OsZIP1 is a transporter that is required for detoxification of excess Zn, Cu and Cd in rice
