OsZIP1	stress	OsZIP1 functions as a metal efflux transporter limiting excess zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation in rice.	 Transgenic rice overexpressing OsZIP1 grew better under excess metal stress but accumulated less of the metals in plants
OsZIP1	stress	OsZIP1 functions as a metal efflux transporter limiting excess zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation in rice.	 We further identified the DNA methylation of histone H3K9me2 of OsZIP1 and found that OsZIP1 locus, whose transcribed regions imbed a 242â€‰bp sequence, is demethylated, suggesting that epigenetic modification is likely associated with OsZIP1 function under Cd stress
OsZIP1	transporter	OsZIP1 functions as a metal efflux transporter limiting excess zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation in rice.	OsZIP1 functions as a metal efflux transporter limiting excess zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation in rice.
OsZIP1	transporter	OsZIP1 functions as a metal efflux transporter limiting excess zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation in rice.	In this report, we provided evidence that OsZIP1 is a metal-detoxified transporter through preventing excess Zn, Cu and Cd accumulation in rice
OsZIP1	transporter	OsZIP1 functions as a metal efflux transporter limiting excess zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation in rice.	OsZIP1 is a transporter that is required for detoxification of excess Zn, Cu and Cd in rice
OsZIP1	plasma membrane	OsZIP1 functions as a metal efflux transporter limiting excess zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation in rice.	 Expression of OsZIP-GFP fusion in rice protoplasts and tobacco leaves shows that OsZIP1 resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM)
OsZIP1	cadmium	OsZIP1 functions as a metal efflux transporter limiting excess zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation in rice.	OsZIP1 functions as a metal efflux transporter limiting excess zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation in rice.
OsZIP1	copper	OsZIP1 functions as a metal efflux transporter limiting excess zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation in rice.	OsZIP1 functions as a metal efflux transporter limiting excess zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation in rice.
OsZIP1	stress	Zinc induced regulation of PCR1 gene for cadmium stress resistance in rice roots.	 Collectively, results point mediated cross-tolerance against Cd stress via by modulating uptake of Cd and Zn and expression of OsZIP1 and OsPCR1, and ROS homeostasis due to fine tuning of ascorbate-glutathione cycle which finally lessened oxidative stress in rice roots
OsZIP1	oxidative stress	Zinc induced regulation of PCR1 gene for cadmium stress resistance in rice roots.	 Collectively, results point mediated cross-tolerance against Cd stress via by modulating uptake of Cd and Zn and expression of OsZIP1 and OsPCR1, and ROS homeostasis due to fine tuning of ascorbate-glutathione cycle which finally lessened oxidative stress in rice roots
OsZIP1	oxidative	Zinc induced regulation of PCR1 gene for cadmium stress resistance in rice roots.	 Collectively, results point mediated cross-tolerance against Cd stress via by modulating uptake of Cd and Zn and expression of OsZIP1 and OsPCR1, and ROS homeostasis due to fine tuning of ascorbate-glutathione cycle which finally lessened oxidative stress in rice roots
OsZIP1	homeostasis	Zinc induced regulation of PCR1 gene for cadmium stress resistance in rice roots.	 Collectively, results point mediated cross-tolerance against Cd stress via by modulating uptake of Cd and Zn and expression of OsZIP1 and OsPCR1, and ROS homeostasis due to fine tuning of ascorbate-glutathione cycle which finally lessened oxidative stress in rice roots
