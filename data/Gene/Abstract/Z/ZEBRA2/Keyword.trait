OsCRTISO|ZEBRA2|MHZ5|MIT3	oxidative	Mutations of genes in synthesis of the carotenoid precursors of ABA lead to pre-harvest sprouting and photo-oxidation in rice	The greatly increased activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes, and reduced photosystem (PS) II core proteins CP43, CP47 and D1 in leaves of the Oscrtiso/phs3-1mutant and OsLCY RNAi transgenic rice indicated that photo-oxidative damage occurred in PS II, consistent with the accumulation of ROS in these plants
OsCRTISO|ZEBRA2|MHZ5|MIT3	photosynthesis	ZEBRA2, encoding a carotenoid isomerase, is involved in photoprotection in rice	Expression analysis via both RT-PCR and ZEBRA2-promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) transgenic rice indicates that ZEBRA2 is predominantly expressed in mesophyll cells of mature leaves where active photosynthesis occurs
OsCRTISO|ZEBRA2|MHZ5|MIT3	oxidative	ZEBRA2, encoding a carotenoid isomerase, is involved in photoprotection in rice	More severe phenotype of the zebra2 mutant under high light intensity indicates that ""zebra"" phenotype might be caused by photooxidative damages
OsCRTISO|ZEBRA2|MHZ5|MIT3	 ABA 	Ethylene Responses in Rice Roots and Coleoptiles Are Differentially Regulated by a Carotenoid Isomerase-Mediated Abscisic Acid Pathway.	We found that MHZ5 encodes a carotenoid isomerase and that the mutation in mhz5 blocks carotenoid biosynthesis, reduces ABA accumulation, and promotes ethylene production in etiolated seedlings
OsCRTISO|ZEBRA2|MHZ5|MIT3	 ABA 	Ethylene Responses in Rice Roots and Coleoptiles Are Differentially Regulated by a Carotenoid Isomerase-Mediated Abscisic Acid Pathway.	ABA can largely rescue the ethylene response of the mhz5 mutant
OsCRTISO|ZEBRA2|MHZ5|MIT3	 ABA 	Ethylene Responses in Rice Roots and Coleoptiles Are Differentially Regulated by a Carotenoid Isomerase-Mediated Abscisic Acid Pathway.	Ethylene induces MHZ5 expression, the production of neoxanthin, an ABA biosynthesis precursor, and ABA accumulation in roots
