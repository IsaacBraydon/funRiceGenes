OsCRTISO|ZEBRA2	oxidative	Mutations of genes in synthesis of the carotenoid precursors of ABA lead to pre-harvest sprouting and photo-oxidation in rice	" The greatly increased activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes, and reduced photosystem (PS) II core proteins CP43, CP47 and D1 in leaves of the Oscrtiso/phs3-1mutant and OsLCY RNAi transgenic rice indicated that photo-oxidative damage occurred in PS II, consistent with the accumulation of ROS in these plants"
OsCRTISO|ZEBRA2	photosynthesis	ZEBRA2, encoding a carotenoid isomerase, is involved in photoprotection in rice	 Expression analysis via both RT-PCR and ZEBRA2-promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) transgenic rice indicates that ZEBRA2 is predominantly expressed in mesophyll cells of mature leaves where active photosynthesis occurs
OsCRTISO|ZEBRA2	oxidative	"ZEBRA2, encoding a carotenoid isomerase, is involved in photoprotection in rice"	" More severe phenotype of the zebra2 mutant under high light intensity indicates that ""zebra"" phenotype might be caused by photooxidative damages"
