ZEP1|OsZEP	meiotic	OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice	In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes
ZEP1|OsZEP	drought	The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages	The expression levels of the drought-responsive genes RD22, SODA1, bZIP46 and POD, as well as the ABA synthetic gene ZEP1 were up-regulated in the OsDIL-overexpression lines but the ABA degradation gene ABAOX3 was down-regulated
ZEP1|OsZEP	microspore	The central element protein ZEP1 of the synaptonemal complex regulates the number of crossovers during meiosis in rice	In addition, ZEP1 is reloaded onto chromosomes in early microspores as the chromosome decondense, suggesting that ZEP1 might have other biological functions during this process
ZEP1|OsZEP	meiosis	The central element protein ZEP1 of the synaptonemal complex regulates the number of crossovers during meiosis in rice	The central element protein ZEP1 of the synaptonemal complex regulates the number of crossovers during meiosis in rice
ZEP1|OsZEP	meiotic	OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis	Finally, we found that the centromeric localization of OsSGO1 depends on OsAM1, not other meiotic proteins such as OsREC8, PAIR2, OsMER3, or ZEP1
ZEP1|OsZEP	meiotic	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
ZEP1|OsZEP	meiotic	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
ZEP1|OsZEP	 ABA 	The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages	The expression levels of the drought-responsive genes RD22, SODA1, bZIP46 and POD, as well as the ABA synthetic gene ZEP1 were up-regulated in the OsDIL-overexpression lines but the ABA degradation gene ABAOX3 was down-regulated
ZEP1|OsZEP	meiosis	OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice	In contrast, in pair2, Osmer3 and zep1 mutants, OsAM1 could be loaded normally, suggesting that OsAM1 plays a fundamental role in building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis
