In budding yeast, the ZMM complex is closely associated with class I crossovers and synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. However, the relationship between the ZMM genes remains unclear in most higher eukaryotes. Here, we identify the rice ZIP4 homolog, a member of the ZMM gene group, and explore its relationship with two other characterized ZMM genes, MER3 and ZEP1. Our results show that in the rice zip4 mutant, the chiasma frequency is greatly reduced, although synapsis proceeds with only mild defects. Immunocytological analyses of wild-type rice reveal that ZIP4 presents as punctuate foci and colocalizes with MER3 in prophase I meiocytes. Additionally, ZIP4 is essential for the loading of MER3 onto chromosomes, but not vice versa. Double-mutant analyses show that zip4 mer3 displays a greater decrease in the mean number of chiasmata than either of the zip4 or mer3 single mutants, suggesting that ZIP4 and MER3 work cooperatively to promote CO formation but their individual contributions are not completely identical in rice. Although zep1 alone gives an increased chiasma number, both zip4 zep1 and mer3 zep1 show a much lower chiasma number than the zip4 or mer3 single mutants. These results imply that the normal functions of ZIP4 and MER3 are required for the regulation of COs by ZEP1.
Mol. Plant-2013-Luo-729-42.pdf	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	2013	Mol Plant	College of Plant Protection, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China.	MSH5, a meiosis-specific member of the MutS-homolog family, is required for normal level of recombination in budding yeast, mice, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Arabidopsis. Here, we report the identification and characterization of its rice homolog, OsMSH5, and demonstrate its function in rice meiosis. Five independent Osmsh5 mutants exhibited normal vegetative growth and severe sterility. The synaptonemal complex is well installed in Osmsh5, while the chiasma frequency is greatly reduced to approximately 10% of that observed in the wild-type, leading to the homologous non-disjunction and complete sterile phenotype. OsMSH5 is predominantly expressed in panicles. Immunofluorescence studies indicate that OsMSH5 chromosomal localization is limited to the early meiotic prophase I. OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10. However, those ZMM proteins cannot be localized normally in the absence of OsMSH5. Furthermore, the residual chiasmata were shown to be the least frequent among the zmm mutants, including Osmer3, Oszip4, hei10, and Osmsh5. Taken together, we propose that OsMSH5 functions upstream of OsZIP4, OsMER3, and HEI10 in class I crossover formation.
