ZL16	leaf	Identification and Phenotypic Characterization of ZEBRA LEAF16 Encoding a ¦Â-Hydroxyacyl-ACP Dehydratase in Rice.	 ZL16 was ubiquitously expressed in various plant organs, with a pronounced level in the young leaf
ZL16	seedlings	Identification and Phenotypic Characterization of ZEBRA LEAF16 Encoding a ¦Â-Hydroxyacyl-ACP Dehydratase in Rice.	 The zl16 mutant showed chlorotic abnormalities in the transverse sectors of the young leaves of seedlings
ZL16	chloroplast	Identification and Phenotypic Characterization of ZEBRA LEAF16 Encoding a ¦Â-Hydroxyacyl-ACP Dehydratase in Rice.	 The use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that dramatic defects occurred in variegated zl16 leaves during the early development of a chloroplast
ZL16	chloroplast	Identification and Phenotypic Characterization of ZEBRA LEAF16 Encoding a ¦Â-Hydroxyacyl-ACP Dehydratase in Rice.	 A subcellular localization experiment indicated that ZL16 was targeted in the chloroplast
ZL16	chloroplast	Identification and Phenotypic Characterization of ZEBRA LEAF16 Encoding a ¦Â-Hydroxyacyl-ACP Dehydratase in Rice.	 Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of some nuclear genes involved in chloroplast development, and found they were altered in the zl16 mutant
ZL16	development	Identification and Phenotypic Characterization of ZEBRA LEAF16 Encoding a ¦Â-Hydroxyacyl-ACP Dehydratase in Rice.	 The use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that dramatic defects occurred in variegated zl16 leaves during the early development of a chloroplast
ZL16	map-based cloning	Identification and Phenotypic Characterization of ZEBRA LEAF16 Encoding a ¦Â-Hydroxyacyl-ACP Dehydratase in Rice.	 Map-based cloning revealed that ZL16 encodes a ¦Â-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (HAD) involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis
ZL16	chloroplast development	Identification and Phenotypic Characterization of ZEBRA LEAF16 Encoding a ¦Â-Hydroxyacyl-ACP Dehydratase in Rice.	 Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of some nuclear genes involved in chloroplast development, and found they were altered in the zl16 mutant
