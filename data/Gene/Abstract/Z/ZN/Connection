OsMTP11	ZN	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.	 Real time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated OsMTP11 expression was substantially enhanced following 4 h under Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn treatments, suggesting possible roles of OsMTP11 involvement in heavy metal stress responses
OsMTP11	ZN	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.	 DNA methylation assays of genomic DNA in rice treated with Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn revealed that decreased DNA methylation levels were present in the OsMTP11 promoter region, which was consistent with OsMTP11 induced-expression patterns resulting from heavy metal stress
OsMTP11	ZN	OsMTP11 is localised at the Golgi and contributes to Mn tolerance.	 OsMTP11 partially rescues the Mn-hypersensitivity of the pmr1 yeast mutant but only slightly alleviates the Zn sensitivity of the zrc1 cot1 yeast mutant
OsMTP11	ZN	OsMTP11 is localised at the Golgi and contributes to Mn tolerance.	 Overall, these results suggest that OsMTP11 predominantly functions as a Mn-transporting CDF with lower affinity for Zn
OsZIP7a|OsZIP7	ZN	Elemental Profiling of Rice FOX Lines Leads to Characterization of a New Zn Plasma Membrane Transporter, OsZIP7.	Elemental Profiling of Rice FOX Lines Leads to Characterization of a New Zn Plasma Membrane Transporter, OsZIP7.
OsZIP7a|OsZIP7	ZN	Elemental Profiling of Rice FOX Lines Leads to Characterization of a New Zn Plasma Membrane Transporter, OsZIP7.	 OsZIP7 expression in Arabidopsis resulted in a 25% increase in shoot Zn concentrations compared to non-transformed plants
OsZIP7a|OsZIP7	ZN	Elemental Profiling of Rice FOX Lines Leads to Characterization of a New Zn Plasma Membrane Transporter, OsZIP7.	 We further characterized OsZIP7 and showed that it is localized to the plasma membrane and is able to complement Zn transport defective (but not Fe defective) yeast mutants
OsZIP7a|OsZIP7	ZN	Elemental Profiling of Rice FOX Lines Leads to Characterization of a New Zn Plasma Membrane Transporter, OsZIP7.	 Our results indicate that OsZIP7 is a good candidate for developing Zn biofortified rice
