We previously identified a salt and drought stress-responsive TFIIIA-type zinc finger protein gene ZFP252 from rice. Here we report the functional analysis of ZFP252 using gain- and loss-of-function strategies. We found that overexpression of ZFP252 in rice increased the amount of free proline and soluble sugars, elevated the expression of stress defense genes and enhanced rice tolerance to salt and drought stresses, as compared with ZFP252 antisense and non-transgenic plants. Our findings suggest that ZFP252 plays an important role in rice response to salt and drought stresses and is useful in engineering crop plants with enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stresses.
Cloning and characterization of RZF71 encoding a C2H2-type zinc finger protein from rice.pdf	Cloning and characterization of RZF71 encoding a C2H2-type zinc	2007	Hereditas	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	A rice zinc-finger protein gene, RZF71, encoding the C2H2-type zinc-finger transcription factor was isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L. subs. Japonica) by RT-PCR approach. Gene RZF71 encodes a 25 kDa protein with 250 amino acids, which contains two typical C2H2 zinc finger domains. The expression profiling showed that RZF71 was constitutively expressed in roots, culms, leaves, and flowering spikes. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay showed RZF71 was strongly induced by high-salinity and 20% PEG6000 treatments, but not regulated by low temperature and ABA (abscisic acid) treatments. Tran-sient expression of the RZF71-GFP protein in onion epidermal cell showed that RZF71 was localized in cell nuclei. These results indicated that the RZF71 may play an important role in rice responses to salt and osmotic stresses as a transcription factor.
