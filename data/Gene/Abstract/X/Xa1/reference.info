10.1007-BF00225736.pdf	Identification of a YAC clone carrying the Xa-1 allele, a bacterial blight resistance gene in rice	1996	Theor Appl Genet	Department of Agriculture, Kyushu University, 6-10-1, Hakozaki, Higashiku, 812, Fukuoka, Japan.	Map-based cloning methods have been applied for isolation of Xa-1, one of the bacterial blight resistance genes in rice.Xa-1 was previously mapped on chromosome 4 using molecular markers. For positional cloning of Xa-1, a high-resolution genetic map was made for theXa-1 region using an F2 population of 402 plants and additional molecular markers. Three restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers, XNpb235, XNpb264 and C600 were found to be linked tightly to Xa-1, with no recombinants, and U08 750 was mapped 1.5 cM from Xa-1. The screening of a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) library using theseXa-1-linked RFLP markers resulted in the identification of ten contiguous YAC clones. Among these, one YAC clone, designated Y5212, with an insert of 340 kb, hybridized with all three tightly linked markers. This YAC was confirmed to possess the Xa-1 allele by mapping the Xa-1 gene between both end clones of this YAC (Y5212R and Y5212L).
PNAS-1998-Yoshimura-1663-8.pdf	Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation	1998	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Rice Genome Research Program, National Institute of Agrobiological Resources/Society for Techno-innovation of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan.	The Xa1 gene in rice confers resistance to Japanese race 1 of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal pathogen of bacterial blight (BB). We isolated the Xa1 gene by a map-based cloning strategy. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Xa1 gene product contains nucleotide binding sites (NBS) and a new type of leucine-rich repeats (LRR); thus, Xa1 is a member of the NBS-LRR class of plant disease-resistance genes, but quite different from Xa21, another BB-resistance gene isolated from rice. Interestingly, Xa1 gene expression was induced on inoculation with a bacterial pathogen and wound, unlike other isolated resistance genes in plants, which show constitutive expression. The induced expression may be involved in enhancement of resistance against the pathogen.
NA	Interfering TAL effectors of Xanthomonas oryzae neutralize R-gene-mediated plant disease resistance.	2016	Nat Commun	School of Agriculture and Biology/State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.	Plant pathogenic bacteria of the genus Xanthomonas possess transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) that activate transcription of disease susceptibility genes in the host, inducing a state of disease. Here we report that some isolates of the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae use truncated versions of TALEs (which we term interfering TALEs, or iTALEs) to overcome disease resistance. In comparison with typical TALEs, iTALEs lack a transcription activation domain but retain nuclear localization motifs and are expressed from genes that were previously considered pseudogenes. We show that the rice gene Xa1, encoding a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein, confers resistance against X. oryzae isolates by recognizing multiple TALEs. However, the iTALEs present in many isolates interfere with the otherwise broad-spectrum resistance conferred by Xa1. Our findings illustrate how bacterial effectors that trigger disease resistance in the host can evolve to interfere with the resistance process and, thus, promote disease.
