RGAf	Xa1	Multiple Alleles Encoding Atypical NLRs with Unique Central Tandem Repeats in Rice Confer Resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae	 XA1, XA1-2, XA14, and non-resistant RGAF differed mainly in the substructure of the leucine-rich repeat domain
Xa1	XA10	Rapid genotyping of bacterial leaf blight resistant genes of rice using loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay	, Xa1, Xa3, Xa4, Xa7, Xa10, Xa11, and Xa21 in rice
Xa1	xa21	Rapid genotyping of bacterial leaf blight resistant genes of rice using loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay	, Xa1, Xa3, Xa4, Xa7, Xa10, Xa11, and Xa21 in rice
Xa1	Xa26|Xa3	Rapid genotyping of bacterial leaf blight resistant genes of rice using loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay	, Xa1, Xa3, Xa4, Xa7, Xa10, Xa11, and Xa21 in rice
Xa1	Xa4	Rapid genotyping of bacterial leaf blight resistant genes of rice using loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay	, Xa1, Xa3, Xa4, Xa7, Xa10, Xa11, and Xa21 in rice
OsWRKY6	Xa1	The OsWRKY6 transcriptional cascade functions in basal defense and Xa1-mediated defense of rice against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	 Here, we characterized a transcriptional cascade triggered by OsWRKY6 that regulated defense against Xoo infection mediated by the NBS-LRR protein Xa1
