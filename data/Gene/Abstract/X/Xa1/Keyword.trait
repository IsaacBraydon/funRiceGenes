Xa1	bacterial blight	Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation	Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation
Xa1	blight	Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation	Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation
Xa1	disease	Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation	The deduced amino acid sequence of the Xa1 gene product contains nucleotide binding sites (NBS) and a new type of leucine-rich repeats (LRR); thus, Xa1 is a member of the NBS-LRR class of plant disease-resistance genes, but quite different from Xa21, another BB-resistance gene isolated from rice
Xa1	resistance	Interfering TAL effectors of Xanthomonas oryzae neutralize R-gene-mediated plant disease resistance.	However, the iTALEs present in many isolates interfere with the otherwise broad-spectrum resistance conferred by Xa1
Xa1	resistance	Multiple Alleles Encoding Atypical NLRs with Unique Central Tandem Repeats in Rice Confer Resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae	 Although Xa1-2 and Xa14 conferred different resistance spectra, their performance could be attenuated by iTALEs, as has previously been reported for Xa1
Xa1	blight	Multiple Alleles Encoding Atypical NLRs with Unique Central Tandem Repeats in Rice Confer Resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae	 Here, we report the isolation of three new bacterial blight R genes in rice, Xa1-2, Xa14, and Xa31(t), which were allelic to Xa1 and encoded atypical NLRs with unique central tandem repeats (CTRs)
Xa1	bacterial blight	Multiple Alleles Encoding Atypical NLRs with Unique Central Tandem Repeats in Rice Confer Resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae	 Here, we report the isolation of three new bacterial blight R genes in rice, Xa1-2, Xa14, and Xa31(t), which were allelic to Xa1 and encoded atypical NLRs with unique central tandem repeats (CTRs)
