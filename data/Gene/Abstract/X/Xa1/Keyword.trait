Xa1	bacterial blight	Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation	Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation
Xa1	blight	Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation	Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation
Xa1	disease	Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation	 The deduced amino acid sequence of the Xa1 gene product contains nucleotide binding sites (NBS) and a new type of leucine-rich repeats (LRR); thus, Xa1 is a member of the NBS-LRR class of plant disease-resistance genes, but quite different from Xa21, another BB-resistance gene isolated from rice
