Os8N3|xa13|OsSWEET11	This study investigated the role of sugar transporter OsSWEET11 during the early stage of rice caryopsis development using the Î²-glucoronidase (GUS)-represented expression, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout, cross-fertilization, and RNA-seq analyses
Os8N3|xa13|OsSWEET11	 solani infection significantly enhanced OsSWEET11 expression in leaves among the clade III SWEET members |  solani might acquire sugar from rice leaves by activating OsSWEET11 expression |  The plants can be protected from infection by manipulating the expression of OsSWEET11 without affecting the crop yield
