Os8N3|xa13	xa21	Identification of Resistance Genes Effective Against Rice Bacterial Blight Pathogen in Eastern India	 Representative pathotypes were used to evaluate seven near-isogenic lines carrying individual bacterial blight resistance genes (Xa3, Xa4, xa5, Xa7, Xa10, xa13, and Xa21) and gene pyramids
Os11N3	Os8N3|xa13	Rice xa13 recessive resistance to bacterial blight is defeated by induction of the disease susceptibility gene Os-11N3	 The finding that Os-8N3 and Os-11N3 encode closely related proteins also provides evidence that N3 proteins have a specific function in facilitating bacterial blight disease|Rice xa13 recessive resistance to bacterial blight is defeated by induction of the disease susceptibility gene Os-11N3
