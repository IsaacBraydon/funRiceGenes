Os8N3|xa13|OsSWEET11	OsSAC1	Mutation of the OsSAC1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum protein with an unknown function, causes sugar accumulation in rice leaves.	 Extremely more OsAGPL1 and OsAGPS1 (responsible for starch synthesis) expression and significantly less OscFBP1, OscFBP2, OsSPS1, and OsSPS11 (responsible for sucrose synthesis) and OsSWEET11, OsSWEET14, and OsSUT1 (responsible for sucrose loading) expression occurred in ossac1 source leaves than in WT source leaves
