NA	Improvement of multiple agronomic traits by a disease resistance gene via cell wall reinforcement.	2017	Nat Plants	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Centre of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	The major disease resistance gene Xa4 confers race-specific durable resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, which causes the most damaging bacterial disease in rice worldwide. Although Xa4 has been one of the most widely exploited resistance genes in rice production worldwide, its molecular nature remains unknown. Here we show that Xa4, encoding a cell wall-associated kinase, improves multiple traits of agronomic importance without compromising grain yield by strengthening the cell wall via promoting cellulose synthesis and suppressing cell wall loosening. Strengthening of the cell wall by Xa4 enhances resistance to bacterial infection, and also increases mechanical strength of the culm with slightly reduced plant height, which may improve lodging resistance of the rice plant. The simultaneous improvement of multiple agronomic traits conferred by Xa4 may account for its widespread and lasting utilization in rice breeding programmes globally.
