NA	Improvement of multiple agronomic traits by a disease resistance gene via cell wall reinforcement.	2017	Nat Plants	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Centre of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	The major disease resistance gene Xa4 confers race-specific durable resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, which causes the most damaging bacterial disease in rice worldwide. Although Xa4 has been one of the most widely exploited resistance genes in rice production worldwide, its molecular nature remains unknown. Here we show that Xa4, encoding a cell wall-associated kinase, improves multiple traits of agronomic importance without compromising grain yield by strengthening the cell wall via promoting cellulose synthesis and suppressing cell wall loosening. Strengthening of the cell wall by Xa4 enhances resistance to bacterial infection, and also increases mechanical strength of the culm with slightly reduced plant height, which may improve lodging resistance of the rice plant. The simultaneous improvement of multiple agronomic traits conferred by Xa4 may account for its widespread and lasting utilization in rice breeding programmes globally.
NA	Rice pyramided line IRBB67 (Xa4/Xa7) homeostasis under combined stress of high temperature and bacterial blight.	2020	Sci Rep	International Rice Research Institute, Los Ba<U+00F1>os, Philippines. g.dossa@hotmail.com.	Rice bacterial blight (BB) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) implies substantial yield loss to rice. In times of climate change, increasing temperatures are observed and further acceleration is expected worldwide. Increasing temperature often turns into inhibition of host plant defense to pathogens. Recently, a reduced resistance in rice IRBB4 carrying Xa4, but an increase in resistance in IRBB7 carrying Xa7 resistance by increasing temperature has been reported. Influence of high temperature on both R genes (Xa4+Xa7) combined in IRBB67 was analyzed under growth chamber conditions and transcriptomic analysis performed. The pyramided line IRBB67 showed no differences in lesion length between both temperature regimes, demonstrating that non-effectiveness of Xa4 at high temperature did not affect IRBB67 resistance. Moreover, Xa4 complements Xa7 resistance with no Xoo spread in planta beyond the symptomatic area under both temperature regimes in IRBB67. Time course transcriptomic analysis revealed that temperature enhanced IRBB67 resistance to combined heat and Xoo. Our findings highlight altered cellular compartments and point at a role of the cell wall involved in Xoo resistance and heat stress tolerance in both susceptible (IR24) and the resistant (IRBB67) NILs. Interestingly, up-regulation of trehalose-6-phosphatase gene and low affinity cation transporter in IRBB67 suggest that IRBB67 maintained a certain homeostasis under high temperature which may have enhanced its resistance. The interplay of both heat stress and Xoo responses as determined by up-regulated and down-regulated genes demonstrates how resistant plants cope with combined biotic and abiotic stresses.
NA	Rapid genotyping of bacterial leaf blight resistant genes of rice using loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay	2021	Mol Biol Rep	Department of Plant Pathology, University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore, India. babu_prasanna@rediffmail.com	The use of resistant (R) genes is the most effective strategy to manage bacterial leaf blight (BLB) disease of rice. Several attempts were made to incorporate R genes into susceptible rice cultivars using marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB). However, MABB relies exclusively on PCR for foreground selection of R genes, which requires expensive equipment for thermo-cycling and visualization of results; hence, it is limited to sophisticated research facilities. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification techniques such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay do not require thermo-cycling during the assay. Therefore, it will be the best alternative to PCR-based genotyping. In this study, we have developed a LAMP assay for the specific and sensitive genotyping of seven BLB resistance (R) genes viz., Xa1, Xa3, Xa4, Xa7, Xa10, Xa11, and Xa21 in rice. Gene-specific primers were designed for the LAMP assay. The LAMP assay was optimized for time, temperature, and template DNA concentration. For effective detection, incubation at 60 °„C for 30 min was optimum for all seven R genes. A DNA intercalating dye ethidium bromide and a calorimetric dye hydroxynaphthol blue was used for result visualization. Further, sensitivity assay revealed that the LAMP assay could detect R genes at 100 fg of template DNA compared to 1 ng and 10 pg, respectively, in conventional PCR and q-PCR assays. The LAMP assay developed in this study provides a simple, specific, sensitive, robust, and cost-effective method for foreground selection of R genes in the resistance breeding programs of resource-poor laboratory.
