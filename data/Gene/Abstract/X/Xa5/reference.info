0004v107p62.pdf	High resolution genetic mapping and candidate gene identification at the xa5 locus for bacterial blight resistance in rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	2003	Theor Appl Genet	Department of Plant Breeding, 240 Emerson Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853-1901, USA.	The xa5 resistance gene from rice provides recessive, race-specific resistance to bacterial blight of rice caused by the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. A high-resolution genetic map of the chromosomal region surrounding xa5 was developed by placing 44 DNA markers on the distal end of rice chromosome 5. The basis for mapping was a PCR-based screening of 1,016 F(2) individuals derived from a cross between a near-isogenic line (NIL) and its corresponding recurrent parent to identify recombinants in the region. Recombinant F(2) individuals were progeny tested using F(3) families inoculated with the Philippine strain PXO 61 of bacterial blight pathogen. The xa5 gene was mapped to a 0.5-cM interval between the markers RS7 and RM611, which spanned an interval of approximately 70 kb and contained a total of 11 open reading frames. Sequence data for the locus was generated from an Indica (the IR24 isoline, IRBB21) BAC covering part of the region and compared to other overlapping Indica (cv 93-11) and Japonica (cv Nipponbare) sequences. Candidate-gene analysis revealed that a basal transcription factor (TFIIa), an ABC transporter, a tRNA synthase, a MAP kinase and a cysteine protease, as well as four unknown, hypothetical or putative proteins, are encoded at the locus and could be potential candidates for the resistance gene product. The mechanism by which these genes could provide recessive, race-specific resistance will be elucidated by map-based cloning of the xa5 gene.
10.1007-s001220050545.pdf	Microsatellite and sequence-tagged site markers diagnostic for the rice bacterial leaf blight resistance gene xa-5	1997	TAG Theoretical and Applied Genetics	Department of Plant Breeding, 252 Emerson Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853-1901, USA, US	Microsatellite and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers tightly linked to the bacterial leaf blight (BLB) resistance gene xa-5 were identified in this study. A survey was conducted to find molecular markers that detected polymorphisms between the resistant (IRBB5) and susceptible (â€˜IR24â€<U+393C><U+3E39>) nearly isogenic lines for xa-5, and between Chinsurah Boro II (CBII), an alternative source of xa-5, and a widely planted variety (â€˜IR64â€<U+393C><U+3E39>) that lacks xa-5. Two F2 populations, from the crosses â€˜IR24â€™Ã—IRBB5 and CBIIÃ—â€˜IR64â€<U+393C><U+3E39>, were used to estimate linkage based on marker genotype and reaction to disease inoculation with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Two RFLP clones, RZ390 and RG556, were found to co-segregate with xa-5 and were converted into STS markers. A microsatellite marker, RM390, was developed based on a simple sequence repeat in the 5â€‘ù<U+3E32> untranslated region of the cDNA probe, RZ390, and found to co-segregate with resistance. Two other microsatellites, RM122 and RM13, were located 0.4â€…cM and 14.1 cM away from xa-5. A germplasm survey of diverse lines containing BLB resistance genes using automated fluorescent detection indicated the range of allelic diversity for each of the microsatellite loci linked to xa-5 and confirmed their usefulness in following genes through the narrow crosses typical of a breeding program. The limited number of alleles observed at the microsatellite loci linked to the resistance gene in 35 xa-5-containing accessions suggested either a single ancestral origin or a few independent origins of the xa-5 gene. PCR-based markers, like the ones developed in this study, are economical and easy to use, and have applicability in efforts to pyramid the recessive xa-5 gene with other BLB resistance genes.
10.1007-s001220050999.pdf	Construction of a BAC contig containing the xa5 locus in rice	1998	TAG Theoretical and Applied Genetics	International Rice Research Institute, P.O. Box 933, 1099 Manila, The Philippines, XX	The recessive gene xa5 confers resistance to bacterial blight in rice. To generate a physical map of the xa5 locus, three RFLP markers RG556, RG207 and RZ390, closely linked to xa5, were used to screen a rice bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library. The identified overlapping BAC clones formed two small contigs which were extended to both sides by chromosome walking. The final physical map consisted of 14 BAC clones and covered 550â€…kb. Genetic analysis with an F2 population showed that two RFLP markers 28N22R and 40F20R, derived from the BAC clones in the contig, flanked the xa5 locus. To further delimit the location of the xa5 locus, RFLP markers RG556 and RG207 were converted to sequence tagged sites and used to perform genetic analysis. The results indicated that the xa5 locus was most likely located between RG207 and RG556. Among the BAC clones in the contig, one clone, 44B4, hybridized to both RG207 and RG556. This suggests that BAC clone 44B4 carried the xa5 locus.
10.1007-s00438-005-0091-7.pdf	Testifying the rice bacterial blight resistance gene xa5 by genetic complementation and further analyzing xa5 (Xa5) in comparison with its homolog TFIIAgamma1	2006	Mol Genet Genomics	Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100101 Beijing, China.	The recessive gene xa5 for resistance to bacterial blight resistance of rice is located on chromosome 5, and evidence based on genetic recombination has been shown to encode a small subunit of the basal transcription factor IIA (Iyer and McCouch in MPMI 17(12):1348-1354, 2004). However, xa5 has not been demonstrated by a complementation test. In this study, we introduced the dominant allele Xa5 into a homozygous xa5-line, which was developed from a cross between IRBB5 (an indica variety with xa5) and Nipponbare (a japonica variety with Xa5). Transformation of Xa5 and subsequent segregation analysis confirmed that xa5 is a V39E substitution variant of the gene for TFIIAgamma on chromosome 5 (TFIIAgamma5 or Xa5). The rice has an addition gene for TFIIAgamma exists on chromosome 1 (TFIIAgamma1). Analysis of the expression patterns of Xa5 (TFIIAgamma5)/xa5 and TFIIAgamma1 revealed that both the genes are constitutively expressed in different rice organs. However, no expression of TFIIAgamma1 could be detected in the panicle by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. To compare the structural difference between the Xa5/xa5 and TFIIAgamma1 proteins, 3-D structures were predicted using computer-aided modeling techniques. The modeled structures of Xa5 (xa5) and TFIIAgamma1 fit well with the structure of TFIIA small subunit from human, suggesting that they may all act as a small subunit of TFIIA. The E39V substitution in the xa5 protein occurs in the alpha-helix domain, a supposed conservative substitutable site, which should not affect the basal transcription function of TFIIAgamma. The structural analysis indicates that xa5 and Xa5 potentially retain their basic transcription factor function, which, in turn, may mediate the novel pathway for bacterial blight resistance and susceptibility, respectively.
PHYTO-98-3-0289.pdf	Genetic and functional characterization of the rice bacterial blight disease resistance gene xa5	2008	Phytopathology	Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is the causal agent of rice bacterial blight, a destructive rice disease worldwide. The gene xa5 provides race-specific resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae, and encodes the small subunit of transcription factor IIA. How xa5 functions in bacterial blight resistance is not well understood, and its recessive gene action is disputed. Here we show that xa5 is inherited in a completely recessive manner and the susceptible allele Xa5 is fully dominant. In accordance with this, bacterial growth in heterozygous and homozygous susceptible lines is not significantly different. Further, one allele of Xa5 is sufficient to promote disease in previously resistant plants; additional copies are not predictive of increased lesion length. Surprisingly, a resistant nearly isogenic line (NIL) of an indica variety sustains high levels of bacterial populations compared to the susceptible NIL, yet the resistant plants restrict symptom expression. In contrast, in japonica NILs, bacterial population dynamics differ in resistant and susceptible genotypes. However, both resistant indica and japonica plants delay bacterial movement down the leaf. These results support a model in which xa5-mediated recessive resistance is the result of restricted bacterial movement, but not restricted multiplication.
NA	An xa5 Resistance Gene-Breaking Indian Strain of the Rice Bacterial Blight Pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae Is Nearly Identical to a Thai Strain	2020	Front Microbiol	Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology Section, School of Integrative Plant Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States.	The rice bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) constrains production in major rice growing countries of Asia. Xoo injects transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) that bind to and activate host "susceptibility" (S) genes that are important for disease. The bacterial blight resistance gene xa5, which reduces TALE activity generally, has been widely deployed. However, strains defeating xa5 have been reported in India and recently also in Thailand. We completely sequenced and compared the genomes of one such strain from each country and examined the encoded TALEs. The two genomes are nearly identical, including the TALE genes, and belong to a previously identified, highly clonal lineage. Each strain harbors a TALE known to activate the major S gene SWEET11 strongly enough to be effective even when diminished by xa5. The findings suggest international migration of the xa5-compatible pathotype and highlight the utility of whole genome sequencing and TALE analysis for understanding and responding to breakdown of resistance.
