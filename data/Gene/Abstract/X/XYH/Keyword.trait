XYH	seed	Expression dynamics of metabolic and regulatory components across stages of panicle and seed development in indica rice	We validated the stage-specificity of regulatory regions of three panicle-specific genes, OsAGO3, OsSub42, and RTS, and an early seed-specific gene, XYH, in transgenic rice
