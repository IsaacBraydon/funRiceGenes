Xa10-Ni	leaf	Induction of Xa10-like genes in rice cultivar Nipponbare confers disease resistance to rice bacterial blight.	 Like XA10, both XA10-Ni and XA23-Ni locate to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, show self-interaction and induce ER Ca2+ depletion in leaf cells of N
Xa10-Ni	resistance	Induction of Xa10-like genes in rice cultivar Nipponbare confers disease resistance to rice bacterial blight.	 Here we designated the two Xa10-like genes as Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni and characterized their function for disease resistance to rice bacterial blight
