NA	Induction of Xa10-like genes in rice cultivar Nipponbare confers disease resistance to rice bacterial blight.	2017	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory Ltd, 68741, Singapore, Singapore.	Bacterial blight of rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, is one of the most destructive bacterial diseases throughout the major rice growing regions in the world. The rice disease resistance (R) genes Xa10 confers race-specific disease resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains that deliver the corresponding transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors AvrXa10. Upon bacterial infection, AvrXa10 binds specifically to the effector binding element (EBE) in the promoter of the R gene and activates its expression. Xa10 encodes an executor R protein that triggers hypersensitive response and activates disease resistance. Rice cultivar Nipponbare carries two Xa10-like genes in its genome, of which one is the susceptible allele of the Xa23 gene, a Xa10-like TAL effector-dependent executor R gene isolated recently from rice cultivar CBB23. However, the function of the two Xa10-like genes in disease resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains has not been investigated. Here we designated the two Xa10-like genes as Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni and characterized their function for disease resistance to rice bacterial blight. Both Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni provided disease resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains that deliver the matching artificially designed TAL effectors (dTALEs). Transgenic rice plants containing Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni under the Xa10 promoter provided specific disease resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains that deliver AvrXa10. Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni knock-out mutants abolished dTALE-dependent disease resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae. Heterologous expression of Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni in Nicotiana benthamiana triggered cell death. The 19-amino acid residues at the N-terminal regions of XA10 or XA10-Ni are dispensable for their function in inducing cell death in N. benthamiana and the C-terminal regions of XA10, XA10-Ni and XA23-Ni are interchangeable among each other without affecting their function. Like XA10, both XA10-Ni and XA23-Ni locate to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, show self-interaction and induce ER Ca2+ depletion in leaf cells of N. benthamiana. The results indicate that Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni in Nipponbare encode functional executor R proteins, which induce cell death in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants and have potential of being engineered to provide broad-spectrum disease resistance to plant pathogenic Xanthomonas species.
