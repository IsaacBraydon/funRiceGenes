NA	A receptor like kinase gene with expressional responsiveness on Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is essential for Xa21-mediated disease resistance.	2015	Rice (N Y)	Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University at Wenjiang, Chengdu, Sichuan, 611130, China, 1175091678@qq.com.	Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) represent a large class of proteins in regulating plant development and immunity. The LRR-RLK XA21 confers resistance to the bacterial disease caused by the pathogen of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Several XA21 binding proteins have been characterized, however the early events governing XA21 signaling have not been fully elucidated.Here we report the identification of one LRR-RLK gene (XIK1) whose expression is induced rapidly upon the infection with the pathogen of Xoo. Expression pattern analysis reveals that XIK1 is preferentially expressed in reproductive leaves and panicles, and that expression is associated with plant development. By using RNA interference (RNAi), we silenced the expression of XIK1 in rice with Xa21 and found that reduced expression of XIK1 compromised disease resistance mediated by XA21. In addition, we found that the expression of the downstream marker genes of pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity (PTI) in rice was compromised in Xa21 plants silenced for XIK1.Our study reveals that the LRR-RLK gene XIK1 is Xoo-responsive and positively regulates Xa21-mediated disease resistance.
