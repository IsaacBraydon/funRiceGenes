Xa26|Xa3	 We performed simultaneous genome-wide analyses of the expression of sRNAs and genes during early defense responses of rice to Xoo mediated by a major disease resistance gene, Xa3/Xa26, which confers durable and race-specific qualitative resistance |  A large number of sRNAs and genes showed differential expression in Xa3/Xa26-mediated resistance
