XA10	bacterial blight	The rice TAL effector-dependent resistance protein XA10 triggers cell death and calcium depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum	 Here, we report the cloning and characterization of Xa10, a transcription activator-like (TAL) effector-dependent R gene for resistance to bacterial blight in rice (Oryza sativa)
XA10	cell death	The rice TAL effector-dependent resistance protein XA10 triggers cell death and calcium depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum	 Expression of Xa10 induces programmed cell death in rice, Nicotiana benthamiana, and mammalian HeLa cells| XA10 variants that abolish programmed cell death and ER Ca(2+) depletion in N| We propose that XA10 is an inducible, intrinsic terminator protein that triggers programmed cell death by a conserved mechanism involving disruption of the ER and cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis|The rice TAL effector-dependent resistance protein XA10 triggers cell death and calcium depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum
XA10	homeostasis	The rice TAL effector-dependent resistance protein XA10 triggers cell death and calcium depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum	 We propose that XA10 is an inducible, intrinsic terminator protein that triggers programmed cell death by a conserved mechanism involving disruption of the ER and cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis
