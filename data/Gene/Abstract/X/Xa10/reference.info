Plant Cell-2014-Tian-tpc.113.119255.pdf	The rice TAL effector-dependent resistance protein XA10 triggers cell death and calcium depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum	2014	Plant Cell	Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117604, Republic of Singapore.	The recognition between disease resistance (R) genes in plants and their cognate avirulence (Avr) genes in pathogens can produce a hypersensitive response of localized programmed cell death. However, our knowledge of the early signaling events of the R gene-mediated hypersensitive response in plants remains limited. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of Xa10, a transcription activator-like (TAL) effector-dependent R gene for resistance to bacterial blight in rice (Oryza sativa). Xa10 contains a binding element for the TAL effector AvrXa10 (EBEAvrXa10) in its promoter, and AvrXa10 specifically induces Xa10 expression. Expression of Xa10 induces programmed cell death in rice, Nicotiana benthamiana, and mammalian HeLa cells. The Xa10 gene product XA10 localizes as hexamers in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is associated with ER Ca(2+) depletion in plant and HeLa cells. XA10 variants that abolish programmed cell death and ER Ca(2+) depletion in N. benthamiana and HeLa cells also abolish disease resistance in rice. We propose that XA10 is an inducible, intrinsic terminator protein that triggers programmed cell death by a conserved mechanism involving disruption of the ER and cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis.

Many pathovars of plant pathogenic bacteria Xanthomonas species inject transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors into plant host cells to promote disease susceptibility or trigger disease resistance. The rice TAL effector-dependent disease resistance gene Xa10 confers narrow-spectrum race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent of bacterial blight disease in rice. To generate broad-spectrum and durable resistance to Xoo, we developed a modified Xa10 gene, designated as Xa10(E5) . Xa10(E5) has an EBE-amended promoter containing 5 tandemly arranged EBEs each responding specifically to a corresponding virulent or avirulent TAL effector and a stable transgenic rice line containing Xa10(E5) was generated in the cultivar Nipponbare. The Xa10(E5) gene was specifically induced by Xoo strains that harbour the corresponding TAL effectors and conferred TAL effector-dependent resistance to the pathogens at all developmental stages of rice. Further disease evaluation demonstrated that the Xa10(E5) gene in either Nipponbare or 9311 genetic backgrounds provided broad-spectrum disease resistance to 27 of the 28 Xoo strains collected from 11 countries. The development of Xa10(E5) and transgenic rice lines provides new genetic materials for molecular breeding of rice for broad-spectrum and durable disease resistance to bacterial blight.
NA	Induction of Xa10-like genes in rice cultivar Nipponbare confers disease resistance to rice bacterial blight.	2017	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory Ltd, 68741, Singapore, Singapore.	Bacterial blight of rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, is one of the most destructive bacterial diseases throughout the major rice growing regions in the world. The rice disease resistance (R) genes Xa10 confers race-specific disease resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains that deliver the corresponding transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors AvrXa10. Upon bacterial infection, AvrXa10 binds specifically to the effector binding element (EBE) in the promoter of the R gene and activates its expression. Xa10 encodes an executor R protein that triggers hypersensitive response and activates disease resistance. Rice cultivar Nipponbare carries two Xa10-like genes in its genome, of which one is the susceptible allele of the Xa23 gene, a Xa10-like TAL effector-dependent executor R gene isolated recently from rice cultivar CBB23. However, the function of the two Xa10-like genes in disease resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains has not been investigated. Here we designated the two Xa10-like genes as Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni and characterized their function for disease resistance to rice bacterial blight. Both Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni provided disease resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains that deliver the matching artificially designed TAL effectors (dTALEs). Transgenic rice plants containing Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni under the Xa10 promoter provided specific disease resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains that deliver AvrXa10. Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni knock-out mutants abolished dTALE-dependent disease resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae. Heterologous expression of Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni in Nicotiana benthamiana triggered cell death. The 19-amino acid residues at the N-terminal regions of XA10 or XA10-Ni are dispensable for their function in inducing cell death in N. benthamiana and the C-terminal regions of XA10, XA10-Ni and XA23-Ni are interchangeable among each other without affecting their function. Like XA10, both XA10-Ni and XA23-Ni locate to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, show self-interaction and induce ER Ca2+ depletion in leaf cells of N. benthamiana. The results indicate that Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni in Nipponbare encode functional executor R proteins, which induce cell death in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants and have potential of being engineered to provide broad-spectrum disease resistance to plant pathogenic Xanthomonas species.
NA	Rapid genotyping of bacterial leaf blight resistant genes of rice using loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay	2021	Mol Biol Rep	Department of Plant Pathology, University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore, India. babu_prasanna@rediffmail.com	The use of resistant (R) genes is the most effective strategy to manage bacterial leaf blight (BLB) disease of rice. Several attempts were made to incorporate R genes into susceptible rice cultivars using marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB). However, MABB relies exclusively on PCR for foreground selection of R genes, which requires expensive equipment for thermo-cycling and visualization of results; hence, it is limited to sophisticated research facilities. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification techniques such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay do not require thermo-cycling during the assay. Therefore, it will be the best alternative to PCR-based genotyping. In this study, we have developed a LAMP assay for the specific and sensitive genotyping of seven BLB resistance (R) genes viz., Xa1, Xa3, Xa4, Xa7, Xa10, Xa11, and Xa21 in rice. Gene-specific primers were designed for the LAMP assay. The LAMP assay was optimized for time, temperature, and template DNA concentration. For effective detection, incubation at 60 °„C for 30 min was optimum for all seven R genes. A DNA intercalating dye ethidium bromide and a calorimetric dye hydroxynaphthol blue was used for result visualization. Further, sensitivity assay revealed that the LAMP assay could detect R genes at 100 fg of template DNA compared to 1 ng and 10 pg, respectively, in conventional PCR and q-PCR assays. The LAMP assay developed in this study provides a simple, specific, sensitive, robust, and cost-effective method for foreground selection of R genes in the resistance breeding programs of resource-poor laboratory.
