XA10	Xa10-Ni	Induction of Xa10-like genes in rice cultivar Nipponbare confers disease resistance to rice bacterial blight.	 Transgenic rice plants containing Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni under the Xa10 promoter provided specific disease resistance to X
XA10	Xa10-Ni	Induction of Xa10-like genes in rice cultivar Nipponbare confers disease resistance to rice bacterial blight.	 The 19-amino acid residues at the N-terminal regions of XA10 or XA10-Ni are dispensable for their function in inducing cell death in N
XA10	Xa10-Ni	Induction of Xa10-like genes in rice cultivar Nipponbare confers disease resistance to rice bacterial blight.	 benthamiana and the C-terminal regions of XA10, XA10-Ni and XA23-Ni are interchangeable among each other without affecting their function
XA10	Xa10-Ni	Induction of Xa10-like genes in rice cultivar Nipponbare confers disease resistance to rice bacterial blight.	 Like XA10, both XA10-Ni and XA23-Ni locate to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, show self-interaction and induce ER Ca2+ depletion in leaf cells of N
Xa1	XA10	Rapid genotyping of bacterial leaf blight resistant genes of rice using loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay	, Xa1, Xa3, Xa4, Xa7, Xa10, Xa11, and Xa21 in rice
XA10	Xa26|Xa3	Rapid genotyping of bacterial leaf blight resistant genes of rice using loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay	, Xa1, Xa3, Xa4, Xa7, Xa10, Xa11, and Xa21 in rice
XA10	Xa4	Rapid genotyping of bacterial leaf blight resistant genes of rice using loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay	, Xa1, Xa3, Xa4, Xa7, Xa10, Xa11, and Xa21 in rice
