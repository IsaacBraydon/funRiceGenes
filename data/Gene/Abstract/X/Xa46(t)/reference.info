Rice bacterial leaf blight is caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and produces substantial losses in rice yields. Resistance breeding is an effective method for controlling bacterial leaf blight disease. The mutant line H120 derived from the japonica line Lijiangxintuanheigu is resistant to all Chinese Xoo races. To identify and map the Xoo resistance gene(s) of H120, we examined the association between phenotypic and genotypic variations in two F2 populations derived from crosses between H120/CO39 and H120/IR24. The segregation ratios of F2 progeny consisted with the action of a single dominant resistance gene, which we named Xa46(t). Xa46(t) was mapped between the markers RM26981 and RM26984 within an approximately 65.34-kb region on chromosome 11. The 12 genes predicted within the target region included two candidate genes encoding the serine/threonine-protein kinase Doa (Loc_Os11g37540) and Calmodulin-2/3/5 (Loc_Os11g37550). Differential expression of H120 was analyzed by RNA-seq. Four genes in the Xa46(t) target region were differentially expressed after inoculation with Xoo. Mapping and expression data suggest that Loc_Os11g37540 allele is most likely to be Xa46(t). The sequence comparison of Xa23 allele between H120 and CBB23 indicated that the Xa46(t) gene is not identical to Xa23.
