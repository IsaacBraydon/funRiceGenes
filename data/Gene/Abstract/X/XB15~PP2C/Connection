OsSIPP2C1|OsPP2C68|OsPP108	XB15|PP2C	ABA inducible rice protein phosphatase 2C confers ABA insensitivity and abiotic stress tolerance in Arabidopsis.	We have identified a group A PP2C from rice (OsPP108), which is highly inducible under ABA, salt and drought stresses and localized predominantly in the nucleus
OsBIERF1|OsPP2C34	XB15|PP2C	Isolation of a novel protein phosphatase2C in rice and its response to gibberellin.	 Here, we identified a novel PP2C from rice (OsPP2C34), which is highly inducible by gibberellin (GA) and expressed in various tissues
SERK2|OsSERK2	XB15|PP2C	Four tyrosine residues of the rice immune receptor XA21 are not required for interaction with the co-receptor OsSERK2 or resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	 Four of the XA21JKYF variants maintain interaction with OsSERK2 as well as the XA21 binding (XB) proteins XB3 and XB15 in yeast, suggesting that these four tyrosine residues are not required for their interaction
OsPP2C09|OsPP15|OsPYL2	XB15|PP2C	OsPP2C09, a negative regulatory factor in abscisic acid signaling, plays an essential role in balancing plant growth and drought tolerance in rice.	 The OsPP2C09 protein interacted with the core components of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and showed PP2C phosphatase activity in vitro
OsPP95	XB15|PP2C	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE95 Regulates Phosphate Homeostasis by Affecting Phosphate Transporter Trafficking in Rice[OPEN]	 We demonstrate that the protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C) protein phosphatase OsPP95 interacts with OsPT2 and OsPT8 and dephosphorylates OsPT8 at Ser-517
