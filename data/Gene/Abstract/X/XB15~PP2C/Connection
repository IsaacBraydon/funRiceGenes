xa21	XB15|PP2C	Rice XB15, a protein phosphatase 2C, negatively regulates cell death and XA21-mediated innate immunity	 A yeast two-hybrid screen using the intracellular portion of XA21, including the juxtamembrane (JM) and kinase domain as bait, identified a protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), called XA21 binding protein 15 (XB15)| The interaction of XA21 and XB15 was confirmed in vitro and in vivo by glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, respectively| Autophosphorylated XA21 can be dephosphorylated by XB15 in a temporal- and dosage-dependent manner| A serine residue in the XA21 JM domain is required for XB15 binding| Xb15 mutants display a severe cell death phenotype, induction of pathogenesis-related genes, and enhanced XA21-mediated resistance| Overexpression of Xb15 in an XA21 rice line compromises resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv| These results demonstrate that Xb15 encodes a PP2C that negatively regulates the XA21-mediated innate immune response|Rice XB15, a protein phosphatase 2C, negatively regulates cell death and XA21-mediated innate immunity
