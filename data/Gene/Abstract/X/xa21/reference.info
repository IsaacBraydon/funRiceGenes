1-s2.0-S0168945213001118-main.pdf	The endoplasmic reticulum-quality control component SDF2 is essential for XA21-mediated immunity in rice	2013	Plant Sci	Department of Plant Pathology and The Genome Center, University of California Davis, Davis, CA, United States.	Plant genomes contain large number of plasma membrane (PM)-localized immune receptors, also called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then translocated to the PM, where they recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and activate innate immune response. The rice XA21 immune receptor confers resistance to the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). To identify components that mediate XA21-mediated signaling, we performed co-purification experiments using C-terminal GFP tagged XA21 protein. Several endoplasmic reticulum-quality control (ER-QC) proteins including stromal-derived factor 2 (SDF2) co-purified with XA21. Silencing of the SDF2 genes in the XA21 rice genetic background compromises resistance to Xoo but does not affect plant growth and development.
Chen F-MP 2010.pdf	Plasma membrane localization and potential endocytosis of constitutively expressed XA21 proteins in transgenic rice	2010	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200032, China.	The rice pattern recognition receptor (PRR) XA21 confers race-specific resistance in leaf infection by bacterial blight Xathomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), and was shown to be primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when expressed with its native promoter or overexpressed in the protoplast. However, whether the protein is still ER-localization in the intact cell when overexpressed remains to be identified. Here, we showed that XA21, its kinase-dead mutant XA21P(K736EP), and the triple autophosphorylation mutant XA21P(S686A/T688A/S699A) GFP fusions were primarily localized to the plasma membrane (PM) when overexpressed in the intact transgenic rice cell, and also localized to the ER in the transgenic protoplast. The transgenic plants constitutively expressing the wild-type XA21 or its GFP fusion displayed race-specific resistance to Xoo at the adult and seedling stages. XA21 and XA21P(K736EP) could be internalized probably via the SCAMP-positive early endosomal compartment in the protoplast, suggesting that XA21 might be endocytosed to initiate resistance responses during pathogen infection. We also established a root infection system and demonstrated that XA21 also mediated race-specific resistance responses to Xoo in the root. Our current study provides an insight into the nature of the XA21-mediated resistance and a practical approach using the root cell system to further dissect the cellular signaling of the PRR during the rice-Xoo interaction.
J. Biol. Chem.-2002-Liu-20264-9.pdf	Biochemical characterization of the kinase domain of the rice disease resistance receptor-like kinase XA21	2002	J Biol Chem	Department of Plant Pathology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611, USA.	The rice disease resistance gene, Xa21, encodes a receptor kinase-like protein consisting of leucine-rich repeats in the putative extracellular domain and a serine/threonine kinase in the putative intracellular domain. The putative XA21 kinase domain was expressed as maltose-binding and glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. The fusion proteins are capable of autophosphorylation. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein indicates that only serine and threonine residues are phosphorylated. The relative phosphorylation rate of the XA21 kinase against increasing enzyme concentrations follows a first-order rather than second-order kinetics, indicating an intramolecular phosphorylation mechanism. Moreover, the active XA21 kinase cannot phosphorylate a kinase-deficient mutant of XA21 kinase. The enzymatic activity of the XA21 kinase in a buffer containing Mn(2+) is at least 15 times higher than that with Mg(2+). The K(m) and V(max) of XA21 kinase for ATP are 0.3 microm and 8.4 nmol/mg/min, respectively. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping reveals that multiple sites on the XA21 kinase are phosphorylated. Finally, our data suggest that the region of XA21 kinase corresponding to the RD kinase activation domain is not phosphorylated, revealing a distinct mode of action compared with the tomato Pto serine/threonine kinase conferring disease resistance.
j.1744-7909.2011.01032.x.pdf	Transcriptional characteristics of Xa21-mediated defense responses in rice	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is the most destructive bacterial disease of rice. The cloned rice gene Xa21 confers resistance to a broad spectrum of Xoo races. To identify genes involved in Xa21-mediated immunity, a whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray of rice was used to profile the expression of rice genes between incompatible interactions and mock treatments at 0, 4, 8, 24, 72 and 120 h post inoculation (hpi) or between incompatible and compatible interactions at 4 hpi, respectively. A total of 441 differentially expressed genes, designated as XDGs (Xa21 mediated differentially expressed genes), were identified. Based on their functional annotations, the XDGs were assigned to 14 categories, including defense-related, signaling, transcriptional regulators. Most of the defense-related genes belonged to the pathogenesis-related gene family, which was induced dramatically at 72 and 120 hpi. Interestingly, most signaling and transcriptional regulator genes were downregulated at 4 and 8 hpi, suggesting that negative regulation of cellular signaling may play a role in the Xa21-mediated defense response. Comparison of expression profiles between Xa21- and other R gene-mediated defense systems revealed interesting common responses. Representative XDGs with supporting evidences were also discussed.
Microbe09-850.pdf	The cloned gene, Xa21, confers resistance to multiple Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae isolates in transgenic plants	1996	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Department of Plant Pathology, University of California, Davis 95616, USA.	The cloned rice gene, Xa21, confers resistance to multiple pathogen isolates of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in transgenic plants. The resistance phenotype was stably transmitted to T1 progeny and inherited as a single locus. The T1 progeny were tested for resistance to 32 X. oryzae pv. oryzae isolates from eight countries. Both the engineered line and the donor line showed resistance to 29 isolates and susceptibility to three isolates. The identical resistance spectrum of both lines indicates that the presence of a single member of a multigene family, Xa21, is sufficient to confer multi-isolate resistance. The results presented here have important implications for engineering disease resistance in crop plants.
Mol. Plant-2008-Peng-446-58.pdf	OsWRKY62 is a negative regulator of basal and Xa21-mediated defense against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in rice	2008	Mol Plant	Department of Plant Pathology, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.	The rice Xa21 gene, which confers resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), encodes a receptor-like kinase. Few components involved in transducing the Xa21-mediated defense response have yet been identified. Here, we report that XA21 binds to a WRKY transcription factor, called OsWRKY62. The OsWRKY62 gene encodes two splice variants (OsWRKY62.1 and OsWRKY62.2). OsWRKY62.1:smGFP2 and OsWRKY62.2:smGFP2 fusion proteins partially localize to the nucleus. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsWRKY62.1 are compromised in basal defense and Xa21-mediated resistance to Xoo. Furthermore, overexpression of OsWRKY62.1 suppresses the activation of defense-related genes. These results imply that OsWRKY62 functions as a negative regulator of innate immunity in rice, and serves as a critical mediator of both basal and race-specific defense responses.
Mol. Plant-2014-Chen-mp-ssu003.pdf	An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors	2014	Mol Plant	Department of Plant Pathology and the Genome Center, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.	The rice XA21 immune receptor kinase and the structurally related XA3 receptor confer immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent of bacterial leaf blight. Here we report the isolation of OsSERK2 (rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2) and demonstrate that OsSERK2 positively regulates immunity mediated by XA21 and XA3 as well as the rice immune receptor FLS2 (OsFLS2). Rice plants silenced for OsSerk2 display altered morphology and reduced sensitivity to the hormone brassinolide. OsSERK2 interacts with the intracellular domains of each immune receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system in a kinase activity-dependent manner. OsSERK2 undergoes bidirectional transphosphorylation with XA21 in vitro and forms a constitutive complex with XA21 in vivo. These results demonstrate an essential role for OsSERK2 in the function of three rice immune receptors and suggest that direct interaction with the rice immune receptors is critical for their function. Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanism of OsSERK2-meditated regulation of rice XA21, XA3, and FLS2 differs from that of AtSERK3/BAK1-mediated regulation of Arabidopsis FLS2 and EFR.
ncomms1932.pdf	Cleavage and nuclear localization of the rice XA21 immune receptor	2012	Nat Commun	Department of Plant Pathology and the Genome Center, University of California Davis, Davis, California 95616, USA.	Plants and animals carry specific receptors that recognize invading pathogens and respond by activating an immune response. The rice XA21 receptor confers broad-spectrum immunity to the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae upon recognition of a small protein, Ax21, that is conserved in all Xanthomonas species and related genera. Here we demonstrate that XA21 is cleaved to release the intracellular kinase domain and that this intracellular domain carries a functional nuclear localization sequence. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays indicate that the XA21 intracellular domain interacts with the OsWRKY62 transcriptional regulator exclusively in the nucleus of rice protoplasts. In vivo cleavage of XA21 and translocalization of the intracellular kinase domain to the nucleus is required for the XA21-mediated immune response. These results suggest a new model for immune receptor function: on receptor recognition of conserved microbial signatures, the associated kinase translocates to the nucleus where it directly interacts with transcriptional regulators.
nihms233030.pdf	Ectopic expression of rice Xa21 overcomes developmentally controlled resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae	2010	Plant Sci	Department of Plant Pathology, University of California Davis, Davis, California, United States of America.	Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) activates the innate immune response. The rice PRR, XA21, confers robust resistance at adult stages to most strains of the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Seedlings are still easily infected by Xoo, causing severe yield losses. Here we report that Xa21 is induced by Xoo infection and that ectopic expression of Xa21 confers resistance at three leaf stage (three-week-old), overcoming the developmental limitation of XA21-mediated resistance. Ectopic expression of Xa21 also up-regulates a larger set of defense-related genes as compared to Xa21 driven by the native promoter. These results indicate that altered regulation of Xa21 expression is useful for developing enhanced resistance to Xoo at multiple developmental stages.
pbio.0060231.pdf	Rice XB15, a protein phosphatase 2C, negatively regulates cell death and XA21-mediated innate immunity	2008	PLoS Biol	Department of Plant Pathology, University of California Davis, Davis, California, USA.	Perception of extracellular signals by cell surface receptors is of central importance to eukaryotic development and immunity. Kinases that are associated with the receptors or are part of the receptors themselves modulate signaling through phosphorylation events. The rice (Oryza sativa L.) XA21 receptor kinase is a key recognition and signaling determinant in the innate immune response. A yeast two-hybrid screen using the intracellular portion of XA21, including the juxtamembrane (JM) and kinase domain as bait, identified a protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), called XA21 binding protein 15 (XB15). The interaction of XA21 and XB15 was confirmed in vitro and in vivo by glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, respectively. XB15 fusion proteins purified from Escherichia coli and from transgenic rice carry PP2C activity. Autophosphorylated XA21 can be dephosphorylated by XB15 in a temporal- and dosage-dependent manner. A serine residue in the XA21 JM domain is required for XB15 binding. Xb15 mutants display a severe cell death phenotype, induction of pathogenesis-related genes, and enhanced XA21-mediated resistance. Overexpression of Xb15 in an XA21 rice line compromises resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. These results demonstrate that Xb15 encodes a PP2C that negatively regulates the XA21-mediated innate immune response.
pcp077.pdf	Proteome analysis of detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) associated with OsRac1-mediated innate immunity in rice	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Plant Protein Analysis, Plant Education Unit, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Takayama, Ikoma, Japan.	OsRac1, a member of the Rac/Rop GTPase family, plays important roles as a molecular switch in rice innate immunity, and the active form of OsRac1 functions in the plasma membrane (PM). To study the precise localization of OsRac1 in the PM and its possible association with other signaling components, we performed proteomic analysis of DRMs (detergent-resistant membranes) isolated from rice suspension-cultured cells transformed with myc-tagged constitutively active (CA) OsRac1. DRMs are regions of the PM that are insoluble after Triton X-100 treatment under cold conditions and are thought to be involved in various signaling processes in animal, yeast and plant cells. We identified 192 proteins in DRMs that included receptor-like kinases (RLKs) such as Xa21, nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR)-type disease resistance proteins, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, syntaxin, NADPH oxidase, a WD-40 repeat family protein and various GTP-binding proteins. Many of these proteins have been previously identified in the DRMs isolated from other plant species, and animal and yeast cells, validating the methods used in our study. To examine the possible association of DRMs and OsRac1-mediated innate immunity, we used rice suspension-cultured cells transformed with myc-tagged wild-type (WT) OsRac1 and found that OsRac1 and RACK1A, an effector of OsRac1, shifted to the DRMs after chitin elicitor treatment. These results suggest that OsRac1-mediated innate immunity is associated with DRMs in the PM.
pnas.200912311.pdf	An ATPase promotes autophosphorylation of the pattern recognition receptor XA21 and inhibits XA21-mediated immunity	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Plant Pathology, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.	Cell-surface pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are key components of the innate immune response in animals and plants. These receptors typically carry or associate with non-RD kinases to control early events of innate immunity signaling. Despite their importance, the mode of regulation of PRRs is largely unknown. Here we show that the rice PRR, XA21, interacts with XA21 binding protein 24 (XB24), a previously undescribed ATPase. XB24 promotes autophosphorylation of XA21 through its ATPase activity. Rice lines silenced for Xb24 display enhanced XA21-mediated immunity, whereas rice lines overexpressing XB24 are compromised for immunity. XB24 ATPase enzyme activity is required for XB24 function. XA21 is degraded in the presence of the pathogen-associated molecular pattern Ax21 when XB24 is overexpressed. These results demonstrate a function for this large class of broadly conserved ATPases in PRR-mediated immunity.
pone.0009262.pdf	Overexpression of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP3 regulates XA21-mediated innate immunity in rice	2010	PLoS One	Department of Plant Pathology, University of California Davis, Davis, California, United States of America.	Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) activates the innate immune response. Although PRR-mediated signaling events are critical to the survival of plants and animals, secretion and localization of PRRs have not yet been clearly elucidated. Here we report the in vivo interaction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone BiP3 with the rice XA21 PRR, which confers resistance to the Gram negative bacterium, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). We show that XA21 is glycosylated and is primarily localized to the ER and also to the plasma membrane (PM). In BiP3-overexpressing rice plants, XA21-mediated immunity is compromised, XA21 stability is significantly decreased, and XA21 proteolytic cleavage is inhibited. BiP3 overexpression does not affect the general rice defense response, cell death or brassinolide-induced responses. These results indicate that BiP3 regulates XA21 protein stability and processing and that this regulation is critical for resistance to Xoo.
r0004.pdf	Short communication: developmental control of Xa21-mediated disease resistance in rice	1999	Plant J	Department of Biology, San Francisco State University, CA 94132, USA.	The rice resistance gene Xa21 confers resistance against the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The molecular genetic mechanism controlling the integration of the Xa21-mediated disease resistance response with the developmental program in rice is under study in this model system. Reproducible means of infecting plants at certain developmental stages were designed based on the timing of full expansion of the leaf. Xa21-resistance progressively increases from the susceptible juvenile leaf 2 stage through later stages, with 100% resistance at the adult leaf 9/10 stage. We found that Xa21 expression is independent of plant developmental stage, infection with Xoo, or wounding. Expression of the Xa21 gene transcript is not correlated with expression of Xa21 disease resistance indicating that the developmental regulation of Xa21-resistance is either controlled post-transcriptionally or by other factors.
r9501.pdf	A receptor kinase-like protein encoded by the rice disease resistance gene, Xa21	1995	Science	Department of Plant Pathology, University of California, Davis 95616, USA.	The rice Xa21 gene, which confers resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae race 6, was isolated by positional cloning. Fifty transgenic rice plants carrying the cloned Xa21 gene display high levels of resistance to the pathogen. The sequence of the predicted protein, which carries both a leucine-rich repeat motif and a serine-threonine kinase-like domain, suggests a role in cell surface recognition of a pathogen ligand and subsequent activation of an intracellular defense response. Characterization of Xa21 should facilitate understanding of plant disease resistance and lead to engineered resistance in rice.
r9805.pdf	Xa21D Encodes a Receptor-like Molecule with a Leucine-Rich Repeat Domain That Determines Race-Specific Recognition and Is Subject to Adaptive Evolution	1998	The Plant Cell Online	Department of Plant Pathology, University of California at Davis, 1 Shields Avenue, Davis, California 95616, USA.	The rice Xa21 gene confers resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae in a race-specific manner. Analysis of the inheritance patterns and resistance spectra of transgenic plants carrying six Xa21 gene family members indicated that one member, designated Xa21D, displayed a resistance spectrum identical to that observed for Xa21 but conferred only partial resistance. Xa21D encodes a receptor-like protein carrying leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs in the presumed extracellular domain. The Xa21D transcript terminates shortly after the stop codon introduced by the retrotransposon Retrofit. Comparison of nucleotide substitutions in the LRR coding regions of Xa21 and Xa21D provided evidence of adaptive selection. Both functional and evolutionary evidence indicates that the Xa21D LRR domain controls race-specific pathogen recognition.
Ronald_MolGenGenet_1992.pdf	Genetic and physical analysis of the rice bacterial blight disease resistance locus, Xa21	1992	Mol Gen Genet	Department of Plant Breeding and Biometry, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853.	Nearly isogenic lines (NILs) of rice (Oryza sativa) differing at a locus conferring resistance to the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae were surveyed with 123 DNA markers and 985 random primers using restriction fragment length plymorphism (RFLP) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. One chromosome 11 marker (RG103) detected polymorphism between the NILs that cosegregated with Xa21. All other chromosome 11 DNA markers tested were monomorphic between the NILs, localizing the Xa21 introgressed region to an 8.3 cM interval on chromosome 11. Furthermore, we identified two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products (RAPD2148 and RAPD818) that detected polymorphisms between the NILs. Genomic sequences hybridizing with RAPD818, RAPD248 and RG103 were duplicated specifically in the Xa21 NIL. All three markers cosegregated with the resistance locus, Xa21, in a F2 population of 386 progeny. Based on the frequency with which we recovered polymorphic Xa21-linked markers, we estimated the physical size of the introgressed region to be approximately 800 kb. This estimation was supported by physical mapping (using pulsed field gel electrophoresis) of the sequences hybridizing with the three Xa21-linked DNA markers. The results showed that the three Xa21-linked markers are physically close to each other, with one copy of the RAPD818 sequences located within 60 kb of RAPD248 and the other copy within 270 kb of RG103. None of the enzymes tested generated a DNA fragment that hybridized with all three of the markers indicating that the introgressed region containing the resistance locus Xa21 is probably larger than 270 kb.
tpc1803635.pdf	Rice XA21 binding protein 3 is a ubiquitin ligase required for full Xa21-mediated disease resistance	2006	Plant Cell	Department of Plant Pathology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611, USA.	XA21 is a receptor-like kinase protein in rice (Oryza sativa) that confers gene-for-gene resistance to specific races of the causal agent of bacterial blight disease, Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. We identified XA21 binding protein 3 (XB3), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a substrate for the XA21 Ser and Thr kinase. The interaction between XB3 and the kinase domain of XA21 has been shown in yeast and in vitro, and the physical association between XB3 and XA21 in vivo has also been confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays. XB3 contains an ankyrin repeat domain and a RING finger motif that is sufficient for its interaction with the kinase domain of XA21 and for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, respectively. Transgenic plants with reduced expression of the Xb3 gene are compromised in resistance to the avirulent race of X. oryzae pv oryzae. Furthermore, reduced levels of Xb3 lead to decreased levels of the XA21 protein. These results indicate that Xb3 is necessary for full accumulation of the XA21 protein and for Xa21-mediated resistance.
tpj12076.pdf	The XA21 binding protein XB25 is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance	2013	Plant J	Department of Plant Pathology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.	Plant genomes encode a large number of proteins that potentially function as immune receptors in the defense against pathogen invasion. As a well-characterized receptor kinase consisting of 23 tandem leucine-rich repeats, a transmembrane domain and a serine/threonine kinase, the rice (Oryza sativa) protein XA21 confers resistance to a broad spectrum of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) races that cause bacterial blight disease. We report here that XA21 binding protein 25 (XB25) belongs to the plant-specific ankyrin-repeat (PANK) family. XB25 physically interacts, in vitro, with the transmembrane domain of XA21 through its N-terminal binding to transmembrane and positively charged domain (BTMP) repeats. In addition, XB25 associates with XA21 in planta. The downregulation of Xb25 results in reduced levels of XA21 and compromised XA21-mediated disease resistance at the adult stage. Moreover, the accumulation of XB25 is induced by Xoo infection. Taken together, these results indicate that XB25 is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance.
PDIS%2E2001%2E85%2E5%2E506.pdf	Identification of Resistance Genes Effective Against Rice Bacterial Blight Pathogen in Eastern India	2001	Plant Disease	Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI), Cuttack 753 006, India	Breeding for bacterial blight resistance in rice requires an understanding of the contemporary pathogen populations in the locations where resistance genes are to be deployed. We characterized 450 strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae collected from three states of India using polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting and virulence analysis. This pathogen collection was differentiated into 17 haplotypes (12 lineages at 80% similarity level). Significant differences in the distribution of haplotypes were observed among regions. Virulence analysis of the pathogen collection revealed nine pathotypes. Among the populations from three regions, the Orissa population was the most diverse, consisting of 11 out of 17 haplotypes and five out of nine pathotypes detected in the total collection. Representative pathotypes were used to evaluate seven near-isogenic lines carrying individual bacterial blight resistance genes (Xa3, Xa4, xa5, Xa7, Xa10, xa13, and Xa21) and gene pyramids. Pathogen strains compatible to individual genes were present in detectable frequencies, although no single strain could overcome all resistance genes. Gene combinations Xa4 + xa5, xa5 + Xa21, and Xa4 + xa5 + Xa21 conferred a broad spectrum of resistance to all the strains evaluated, supporting the strategy of pyramiding appropriate resistance genes.
NA	Rice Xa21 primed genes and pathways that are critical for combating bacterial blight infection.	2015	Sci Rep	Institute for Systems Biology, Jianghan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430056, China.	Rice bacterial blight (BB) is a devastating rice disease. The Xa21 gene confers a broad and persistent resistance against BB. We introduced Xa21 into Oryza sativa L ssp indica (rice 9311), through multi-generation backcrossing, and generated a nearly isogenic, blight-resistant 9311/Xa21 rice. Using next-generation sequencing, we profiled the transcriptomes of both varieties before and within four days after infection of bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The identified differentially expressed (DE) genes and signaling pathways revealed insights into the functions of Xa21. Surprisingly, before infection 1,889 genes on 135 of the 316 signaling pathways were DE between the 9311/Xa21 and 9311 plants. These Xa21-mediated basal pathways included mainly those related to the basic material and energy metabolisms and many related to phytohormones such as cytokinin, suggesting that Xa21 triggered redistribution of energy, phytohormones and resources among essential cellular activities before invasion. Counter-intuitively, after infection, the DE genes between the two plants were only one third of that before the infection; other than a few stress-related pathways, the affected pathways after infection constituted a small subset of the Xa21-mediated basal pathways. These results suggested that Xa21 primed critically important genes and signaling pathways, enhancing its resistance against bacterial infection.
NA	The rice immune receptor XA21 recognizes a tyrosine-sulfated protein from a Gram-negative bacterium.	2015	Sci Adv	Department of Plant Pathology and the Genome Center, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA. ; Joint BioEnergy Institute and Physical Biosciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.	Surveillance of the extracellular environment by immune receptors is of central importance to eukaryotic survival. The rice receptor kinase XA21, which confers robust resistance to most strains of the Gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is representative of a large class of cell surface immune receptors in plants and animals. We report the identification of a previously undescribed Xoo protein, called RaxX, which is required for activation of XA21-mediated immunity. Xoo strains that lack RaxX, or carry mutations in the single RaxX tyrosine residue (Y41), are able to evade XA21-mediated immunity. Y41 of RaxX is sulfated by the prokaryotic tyrosine sulfotransferase RaxST. Sulfated, but not nonsulfated, RaxX triggers hallmarks of the plant immune response in an XA21-dependent manner. A sulfated, 21-amino acid synthetic RaxX peptide (RaxX21-sY) is sufficient for this activity. Xoo field isolates that overcome XA21-mediated immunity encode an alternate raxX allele, suggesting that coevolutionary interactions between host and pathogen contribute to RaxX diversification. RaxX is highly conserved in many plant pathogenic Xanthomonas species. The new insights gained from the discovery and characterization of the sulfated protein, RaxX, can be applied to the development of resistant crop varieties and therapeutic reagents that have the potential to block microbial infection of both plants and animals.
NA	XA21-specific induction of stress-related genes following Xanthomonas infection of detached rice leaves.	2016	PeerJ	Department of Plant Pathology and the Genome Center, University of California, Davis, CA, United States; Joint BioEnergy Institute, Emeryville, CA, United States.	The rice XA21 receptor kinase confers robust resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzaepv. oryzae (Xoo). We developed a detached leaf infection assay to quickly and reliably measure activation of the XA21-mediated immune response using genetic markers. We used RNA sequencing of elf18 treated EFR:XA21:GFP plants to identify candidate genes that could serve as markers for XA21 activation. From this analysis, we identified eight genes that are up-regulated in both in elf18 treated EFR:XA21:GFP rice leaves and Xoo infected XA21 rice leaves. These results provide a rapid and reliable method to assess bacterial-rice interactions.
NA	Mutation of the rice XA21 predicted nuclear localization sequence does not affect resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2016	PeerJ	Department of Plant Pathology and the Genome Center, University of California, Davis, CA, United States; Feedstocks Division, Joint BioEnergy Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, United States; Biological Systems and Engineering Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, United States.	The rice receptor kinase XA21 confers robust resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzaepv. oryzae(Xoo). We previously reported that XA21 is cleaved in transgenic plants overexpressing XA21 with a GFP tag (Ubi-XA21-GFP) and that the released C-terminal domain is localized to the nucleus. XA21 carries a predicted nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that directs the C-terminal domain to the nucleus in transient assays, whereas alanine substitutions in the NLS disrupt the nuclear localization.To determine if the predicted NLS is required for XA21-mediated immunity in planta, we generated transgenic plants overexpressing an XA21 variant carrying the NLS with the same alanine substitutions (Ubi-XA21nls-GFP).Ubi-XA21nls-GFP plants displayed slightly longer lesion lengths, higher Xoobacterial populations after inoculation and lower levels of reactive oxygen species production compared with the Ubi-XA21-GFP control plants. However, the Ubi-XA21nls-GFP plants express lower levels of protein than that observed in Ubi-XA21-GFP.These results demonstrate that the predicted NLS is not required for XA21-mediated immunity.
NA	Biosynthesis and secretion of the microbial sulfated peptide RaxX and binding to the rice XA21 immune receptor.	2019	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Plant Pathology, University of California, Davis, CA 95616.	The rice immune receptor XA21 is activated by the sulfated microbial peptide required for activation of XA21-mediated immunity X (RaxX) produced by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Mutational studies and targeted proteomics revealed that the RaxX precursor peptide (proRaxX) is processed and secreted by the protease/transporter RaxB, the function of which can be partially fulfilled by a noncognate peptidase-containing transporter component B (PctB). proRaxX is cleaved at a Gly-Gly motif, yielding a mature peptide that retains the necessary elements for RaxX function as an immunogen and host peptide hormone mimic. These results indicate that RaxX is a prokaryotic member of a previously unclassified and understudied group of eukaryotic tyrosine sulfated ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs). We further demonstrate that sulfated RaxX directly binds XA21 with high affinity. This work reveals a complete, previously uncharacterized biological process: bacterial RiPP biosynthesis, secretion, binding to a eukaryotic receptor, and triggering of a robust host immune response.
NA	Rice immune sensor XA21 differentially enhances plant growth and survival under distinct levels of drought	2020	Sci Rep	Department of Plant Pathology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, USA.	Drought is a complex stress that limits plant growth and crop production worldwide. The mechanisms by which plants coordinately respond to distinct levels of water deficits (e.g., mild, moderate or severe drought) remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that the rice immune sensor XA21 promotes survival of rice seedlings during dehydration stress. XA21 expression increases deposition of lignin and cellulose in the xylem vessels and their surrounding cells. Inhibition of aquaporin water channels by mercuric chloride eliminates XA21-mediated dehydration survival, suggesting that XA21 enables plant survival during drought, probably by protecting xylem functionality. In contrast to prevailing observations of stress tolerance genes, XA21 is also capable of enhancing rice growth during moderate drought. Thus, XA21 acts as a mediator for stress protection and plant growth under water-limiting conditions.
NA	Gene Pyramiding for Achieving Enhanced Resistance to Bacterial Blight, Blast, and Sheath Blight Diseases in Rice	2020	Front Plant Sci	Centre of Excellence for Innovations, Department of Biotechnology, Agricultural College and Research Institute, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Madurai, India.	Bacterial blight, blast, and sheath blight are the commonest diseases causing substantial yield loss in rice around the world. Stacking of broad-spectrum resistance genes/QTLs into popular cultivars is becoming a major objective of any disease resistance breeding program. The varieties ASD 16 and ADT 43 are the two popular, high yielding, and widely grown rice cultivars of South India, which are susceptible to bacterial blight (BB), blast, and sheath blight diseases. The present study was carried out to improve the cultivars (ASD 16 and ADT 43) through introgression of bacterial blight (xa5, xa13, and Xa21), blast (Pi54), and sheath blight (qSBR7-1, qSBR11-1, and qSBR11-2) resistance genes/QTLs by MABB (marker-assisted backcross breeding). IRBB60 (xa5, xa13, and Xa21) and Tetep (Pi54; qSBR7-1, qSBR11-1, and qSBR11-2) were used as donors to introgress BB, blast, and sheath blight resistance into the recurrent parents (ASD 16 and ADT 43). Homozygous (BC3F3 generation), three-gene bacterial blight pyramided (xa5 + xa13 + Xa21) lines were developed, and these lines were crossed with Tetep to combine blast (Pi54) and sheath blight (qSBR7-1, qSBR11-1, and qSBR11-2) resistance. In BC3F3 generation, the improved pyramided lines carrying a total of seven genes/QTLs (xa5 + xa13 + Xa21 + Pi54 + qSBR7-1 + qSBR11-1 + qSBR11-2) were selected through molecular and phenotypic assay, and these were evaluated for resistance against bacterial blight, blast, and sheath blight pathogens under greenhouse conditions. We have selected nine lines in ASD 16 background and 15 lines in ADT 43 background, exhibiting a high degree of resistance to BB, blast, and sheath blight diseases and also possessing phenotypes of recurrent parents. The improved pyramided lines are expected to be used as improved varieties or used as a potential donor in breeding programs. The present study successfully introgressed Pi54, and qSBR QTLs (qSBR7-1, qSBR11-1, and qSBR11-2) from Tetep and major effective BB-resistant genes (xa5, xa13, and Xa21) from IRBB60 into the commercial varieties for durable resistance to multiple diseases.
