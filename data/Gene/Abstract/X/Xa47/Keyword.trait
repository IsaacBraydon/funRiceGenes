Xa47	resistance	A new NLR disease resistance gene Xa47 confers durable and broad-spectrum resistance to bacterial blight in rice.	A new NLR disease resistance gene Xa47 confers durable and broad-spectrum resistance to bacterial blight in rice.
Xa47	resistance	A new NLR disease resistance gene Xa47 confers durable and broad-spectrum resistance to bacterial blight in rice.	 By contrast, overexpression of Xa47 in the susceptible rice material JG30 increased BB resistance
Xa47	resistance	A new NLR disease resistance gene Xa47 confers durable and broad-spectrum resistance to bacterial blight in rice.	 Consequently, Xa47 may have application potential in the genetic improvement of plant disease resistance
Xa47	stress	A new NLR disease resistance gene Xa47 confers durable and broad-spectrum resistance to bacterial blight in rice.	 The findings indicate that Xa47 positively regulates the Xoo stress response
