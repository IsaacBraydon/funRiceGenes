xa21	XB24	An ATPase promotes autophosphorylation of the pattern recognition receptor XA21 and inhibits XA21-mediated immunity	Here we show that the rice PRR, XA21, interacts with XA21 binding protein 24 (XB24), a previously undescribed ATPase
xa21	XB24	An ATPase promotes autophosphorylation of the pattern recognition receptor XA21 and inhibits XA21-mediated immunity	XB24 promotes autophosphorylation of XA21 through its ATPase activity
xa21	XB24	An ATPase promotes autophosphorylation of the pattern recognition receptor XA21 and inhibits XA21-mediated immunity	Rice lines silenced for Xb24 display enhanced XA21-mediated immunity, whereas rice lines overexpressing XB24 are compromised for immunity
xa21	XB24	An ATPase promotes autophosphorylation of the pattern recognition receptor XA21 and inhibits XA21-mediated immunity	XA21 is degraded in the presence of the pathogen-associated molecular pattern Ax21 when XB24 is overexpressed
SnRK1A|OsSnRK1a|OsSnRK1A1	XB24	SnRK1A-mediated phosphorylation of a cytosolic ATPase positively regulates rice innate immunity and is inhibited by Ustilaginoidea virens effector SCRE1.	 As a central mediator of energy signaling, SnRK1A interacts with and phosphorylates XB24 at Thr83 residue to promote ATPase activity
SnRK1A|OsSnRK1a|OsSnRK1A1	XB24	SnRK1A-mediated phosphorylation of a cytosolic ATPase positively regulates rice innate immunity and is inhibited by Ustilaginoidea virens effector SCRE1.	 Meanwhile, SCRE1 outcompetes SnRK1A for XB24 binding, and thereby suppresses SnRK1A-mediated phosphorylation and ATPase activity of XB24
