XB24	immunity	An ATPase promotes autophosphorylation of the pattern recognition receptor XA21 and inhibits XA21-mediated immunity	Rice lines silenced for Xb24 display enhanced XA21-mediated immunity, whereas rice lines overexpressing XB24 are compromised for immunity.
XB24	resistance	An ATPase promotes autophosphorylation of the pattern recognition receptor XA21 and inhibits XA21-mediated immunity	Silencing of Xb24 Enhances Xa21-Mediated Resistance.
XB24	resistance	An ATPase promotes autophosphorylation of the pattern recognition receptor XA21 and inhibits XA21-mediated immunity	Our initial results indicated that silencing of Xb24 enhanced resistance
XB24	resistance	An ATPase promotes autophosphorylation of the pattern recognition receptor XA21 and inhibits XA21-mediated immunity	These results demonstrate that silencing of Xb24 expression enhances XA21-mediated disease resistance.
XB24	disease resistance	An ATPase promotes autophosphorylation of the pattern recognition receptor XA21 and inhibits XA21-mediated immunity	These results demonstrate that silencing of Xb24 expression enhances XA21-mediated disease resistance.
