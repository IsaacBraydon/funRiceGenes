ChenHL et al.Phytopathol.pdf	New gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice located on chromosome 12 identified from minghui 63, an elite restorer line	2002	Phytopathology	None	Bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, is a serious disease of rice worldwide. A new dominant gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice, Xa25(t), was identified from Minghui 63, a restorer line for a number of rice hybrids that are widely cultivated in China. This gene conferred resistance to Philippine race 9 (PXO339) of X. oryzae pv. oryzae in both seedling and adult stages. It was mapped to the centromeric region of chromosome 12, 2.5 cM from a disease resistance gene-homologous sequence, NBS109, and 7.3 cM from a restriction fragment length polymorphism marker, G1314. The genomic location of this gene is similar to the previously identified blast resistance genes, Pi-ta and Pi-ta2.
j.1365-3040.2011.02391.x.pdf	A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice	2011	Plant Cell Environ	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Approximately one third of the identified 34 rice major disease resistance (R) genes conferring race-specific resistance to different strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes rice bacterial blight disease, are recessive genes. However, only two of the recessive resistance genes have been characterized thus far. Here we report the characterization of another recessive resistance gene, xa25, for Xoo resistance. The xa25, localized in the centromeric region of chromosome 12, mediates race-specific resistance to Xoo strain PXO339 at both seedling and adult stages by inhibiting Xoo growth. It encodes a protein of the MtN3/saliva family, which is prevalent in eukaryotes, including mammals. Transformation of the dominant Xa25 into a resistant rice line carrying the recessive xa25 abolished its resistance to PXO339. The encoding proteins of recessive xa25 and its dominant allele Xa25 have eight amino acid differences. The expression of dominant Xa25 but not recessive xa25 was rapidly induced by PXO339 but not other Xoo strain infections. The nature of xa25-encoding protein and its expression pattern in comparison with its susceptible allele in rice-Xoo interaction indicate that the mechanism of xa25-mediated resistance appears to be different from that conferred by most of the characterized R proteins.
NA	Natural variations in the promoter of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET14 expand the range of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2018	PLoS One	Agriculture Biotechnology Division, National Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering (NIBGE), Jhang road, Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan.	Bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is one of the major diseases that impact rice production in Asia. The bacteria use transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) to hijack the host transcription machinery and activate key susceptibility (S) genes, specifically members of the SWEET sucrose uniporters through the recognition of effector-binding element (EBEs) in the promoter regions. However, natural variations in the EBEs that alter the binding affinity of TALEs usually prevent sufficient induction of SWEET genes, leading to resistance phenotypes. In this study, we identified candidate resistance alleles by mining a rice diversity panel for mutations in the promoter of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET14, which are direct targets of three major TALEs PthXo2, PthXo3 and AvrXa7. We found natural variations at the EBE of both genes, which appeared to have emerged independently in at least three rice subspecies. For OsSWEET13, a 2-bp deletion at the 5th and 6th positions of the EBE, and a substitution at the 17th position appear to be sufficient to prevent activation by PthXo2. Similarly, a single nucleotide substitution at position 10 compromised the induction of OsSWEET14 by AvrXa7. These findings might increase our opportunities to reduce pathogen virulence by preventing the induction of SWEET transporters. Pyramiding variants along with other resistance genes may provide durable and broad-spectrum resistance to the disease.
NA	Engineering Broad-Spectrum Bacterial Blight Resistance by Simultaneously Disrupting Variable TALE-binding Elements of Multiple Susceptibility Genes in Rice.	2019	Mol Plant	School of Agriculture and Biology/State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent of bacterial blight of rice, recruits transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) to induce expression of OsSWEET genes, which function in sugar transport and disease susceptibility (S). To engineer broad-spectrum bacterial blight resistance, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to disrupt the TALE-binding elements (EBEs) of two S genes, OsSWEET11 and OsSWEET14, in rice cv. Kitaake, which harbors recessive resistance allele of Xa25/OsSWEET13. The engineered rice line MS14K exhibited broad-spectrum resistance to most Xoo strains with a few exceptions, suggesting that the compatible strains may contain new TALEs. We identified Tal5LN18 and Tal7PXO61, two types of PthXo2-like TALEs, as major virulence factors in the compatible Xoo strains LN18 and PXO61, respectively, and found that Xoo encodes at least five types of PthXo2-like effectors. Given that PthXo2/PthXo2.1 target OsSWEET13 for transcriptional activation, the genomes of 3000 rice varieties were analyzed for EBE variations in OsSWEET13 promoters, and ten Xa25-like haplotypes were identified. Tal5LN18 and Tal7PXO61 were shown to bind slightly different EBE sequences in the OsSWEET13 promoter and activated its expression. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was then used to generate InDels in the EBE of the OsSWEET13 promoter in the mutant MS14K. This resulted in the creation of new germplasm with three edited OsSWEET EBEs and broad-spectrum resistance against all Xoo strains tested. Our findings illustrate how to disarm TALE-S co-evolved loci to generate broad-spectrum resistance through the loss of effector-triggered susceptibility in plants.
