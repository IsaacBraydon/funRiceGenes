ChenHL et al.Phytopathol.pdf	New gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice located on chromosome 12 identified from minghui 63, an elite restorer line	2002	Phytopathology	None	Bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, is a serious disease of rice worldwide. A new dominant gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice, Xa25(t), was identified from Minghui 63, a restorer line for a number of rice hybrids that are widely cultivated in China. This gene conferred resistance to Philippine race 9 (PXO339) of X. oryzae pv. oryzae in both seedling and adult stages. It was mapped to the centromeric region of chromosome 12, 2.5 cM from a disease resistance gene-homologous sequence, NBS109, and 7.3 cM from a restriction fragment length polymorphism marker, G1314. The genomic location of this gene is similar to the previously identified blast resistance genes, Pi-ta and Pi-ta2.

Approximately one third of the identified 34 rice major disease resistance (R) genes conferring race-specific resistance to different strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes rice bacterial blight disease, are recessive genes. However, only two of the recessive resistance genes have been characterized thus far. Here we report the characterization of another recessive resistance gene, xa25, for Xoo resistance. The xa25, localized in the centromeric region of chromosome 12, mediates race-specific resistance to Xoo strain PXO339 at both seedling and adult stages by inhibiting Xoo growth. It encodes a protein of the MtN3/saliva family, which is prevalent in eukaryotes, including mammals. Transformation of the dominant Xa25 into a resistant rice line carrying the recessive xa25 abolished its resistance to PXO339. The encoding proteins of recessive xa25 and its dominant allele Xa25 have eight amino acid differences. The expression of dominant Xa25 but not recessive xa25 was rapidly induced by PXO339 but not other Xoo strain infections. The nature of xa25-encoding protein and its expression pattern in comparison with its susceptible allele in rice-Xoo interaction indicate that the mechanism of xa25-mediated resistance appears to be different from that conferred by most of the characterized R proteins.
