Xa25	resistant	A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice	 Transformation of the dominant Xa25 into a resistant rice line carrying the recessive xa25 abolished its resistance to PXO339
Xa25	blight	New gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice located on chromosome 12 identified from minghui 63, an elite restorer line	 A new dominant gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice, Xa25(t), was identified from Minghui 63, a restorer line for a number of rice hybrids that are widely cultivated in China
Xa25	growth	A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice	 The xa25, localized in the centromeric region of chromosome 12, mediates race-specific resistance to Xoo strain PXO339 at both seedling and adult stages by inhibiting Xoo growth
Xa25	bacterial blight	New gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice located on chromosome 12 identified from minghui 63, an elite restorer line	 A new dominant gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice, Xa25(t), was identified from Minghui 63, a restorer line for a number of rice hybrids that are widely cultivated in China
Xa25	seedling	A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice	 The xa25, localized in the centromeric region of chromosome 12, mediates race-specific resistance to Xoo strain PXO339 at both seedling and adult stages by inhibiting Xoo growth
Xa25	 xoo 	A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice	 Here we report the characterization of another recessive resistance gene, xa25, for Xoo resistance
Xa25	 xoo 	A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice	 The xa25, localized in the centromeric region of chromosome 12, mediates race-specific resistance to Xoo strain PXO339 at both seedling and adult stages by inhibiting Xoo growth
Xa25	 xoo 	A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice	 The expression of dominant Xa25 but not recessive xa25 was rapidly induced by PXO339 but not other Xoo strain infections
