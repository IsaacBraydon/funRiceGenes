OsBIANK1|XB25	 xoo 	The XA21 binding protein XB25 is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance	 Moreover, the accumulation of XB25 is induced by Xoo infection
OsBIANK1|XB25	disease resistance	The XA21 binding protein XB25 is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance	 The downregulation of Xb25 results in reduced levels of XA21 and compromised XA21-mediated disease resistance at the adult stage
