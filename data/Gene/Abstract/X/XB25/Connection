OsBIANK1|XB25	xa21	The XA21 binding protein XB25 is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance	 We report here that XA21 binding protein 25 (XB25) belongs to the plant-specific ankyrin-repeat (PANK) family| XB25 physically interacts, in vitro, with the transmembrane domain of XA21 through its N-terminal binding to transmembrane and positively charged domain (BTMP) repeats| In addition, XB25 associates with XA21 in planta| The downregulation of Xb25 results in reduced levels of XA21 and compromised XA21-mediated disease resistance at the adult stage| Taken together, these results indicate that XB25 is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance|The XA21 binding protein XB25 is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance
