NA	A Nucleus-Encoded Chloroplast Protein YL1 Is Involved in Chloroplast Development and Efficient Biogenesis of Chloroplast ATP Synthase in Rice.	2016	Sci Rep	College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou 310036, China.	Chloroplast ATP synthase (cpATPase) is an importance thylakoid membrane-associated photosynthetic complex involved in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. In this study, we isolated and characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant yellow leaf 1 (yl1), which exhibits chlorotic leaves throughout developmental stages. The YL1 mutation showed reduced chlorophyll contents, abnormal chloroplast morphology, and decreased photochemical efficiency. Moreover, YL1 deficiency disrupts the expression of genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis. Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that YL1 is a nucleus-encoded protein with a predicted transmembrane domain in its carboxyl-terminus that is conserved in the higher plant kingdom. YL1 localizes to chloroplasts and is preferentially expressed in green tissues containing chloroplasts. Immunoblot analyses showed that inactivation of YL1 leads to drastically reduced accumulation of AtpA (α) and AtpB (β), two core subunits of CF1αβ subcomplex of cpATPase, meanwhile, a severe decrease (ca. 41.7%) in cpATPase activity was observed in the yl1-1 mutant compared with the wild type. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays revealed a specific interaction between YL1 and AtpB subunit of cpATPase. Taken together, our results suggest that YL1 is a plant lineage-specific auxiliary factor involved in the biogenesis of the cpATPase complex, possibly via interacting with the β-subunit.
NA	Map-based cloning and characterization of the novel yellow-green leaf gene ys83 in rice (Oryza sativa)	2016	Plant Physiology and Biochemistry	Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China	Leaf-color mutants have been extensively studied in rice, and many corresponding genes have been identified up to now. However, leaf-color mutation mechanisms are diverse and still need further research through identification of novel genes. In the present paper, we isolated a leaf-color mutant, ys83, in rice (Oryza sativa). The mutant displayed a yellow-green leaf phenotype at seedling stage, and then slowly turned into light-green leaf from late tillering stage. In its yellow leaves, photosynthetic pigment contents significantly decreased and the chloroplast development was retarded. The mutant phenotype was controlled by a recessive mutation in a nuclear gene on the short arm of rice chromosome 2. Map-based cloning and sequencing analysis suggested that the candidate gene was YS83 (LOC_Os02g05890) encoding a protein containing 165 amino acid residues. Gene YS83 was expressed in a wide range of tissues, and its encoded protein was targeted to the chloroplast. In the mutant, a T-to-A substitution occurred in coding sequence of gene YS83, which caused a premature translation of its encoded product. By introduction of the wild-type gene, the ys83 mutant recovered to normal green-leaf phenotype. Taken together, we successfully identified a novel yellow-green leaf gene YS83. In addition, number of productive panicles per plant and number of spikelets per panicle only reduced by 6.7% and 7.6%, respectively, meanwhile its seed setting rate and 1000-grain weight (seed size) were not significantly affected in the mutant, so leaf-color mutant gene ys83 could be used as a trait marker gene in commercial hybrid rice production.
