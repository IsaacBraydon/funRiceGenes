The import of nuclear proteins into nuclei begins with recognition of nuclear localization signal-harboring proteins and binding to a nuclear pore targeting complex. A cDNA for an importin-alpha protein, a subunit of the complex, was isolated from rice plants. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA exhibited a high homology to those of importin-alpha proteins from many organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, human, mouse, Xenopus laevis and Drosophila melanogaster. Down-regulation of the transcription by light was shown in the leaves of light- and dark-grown seedlings by RNA blot analysis. The down-regulation was specific to leaves, whereas no light effect was observed in root tissues or calli, in which higher levels of the transcript were detected.
J. Biol. Chem.-2001-Jiang-9322-9.pdf	Molecular cloning of a novel importin alpha homologue from rice, by which constitutive photomorphogenic 1 (COP1) nuclear localization signal (NLS)-protein is preferentially nuclear imported	2001	J Biol Chem	National Institute of Agrobiological Resources, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan. cjjiang@abr.affrc.go.jp	Nuclear import of proteins that contain classical nuclear localization signals (NLS) is initiated by importin alpha, a protein that recognizes and binds to the NLS in the cytoplasm. In this paper, we have cloned a cDNA for a novel importin alpha homologue from rice which is in addition to our previously isolated rice importin alpha1a and alpha2, and we have named it rice importin alpha1b. In vitro binding and nuclear import assays using recombinant importin alpha1b protein demonstrate that rice importin alpha1b functions as a component of the NLS-receptor in plant cells. Analysis of the transcript levels for all three rice importin alpha genes revealed that the genes were not only differentially expressed but that they also responded to dark-adaptation in green leaves. Furthermore, we also show that the COP1 protein bears a bipartite-type NLS and its nuclear import is mediated preferentially by the rice importin alpha1b. These data suggest that each of the different rice importin alpha proteins carry distinct groups of nuclear proteins, such that multiple isoforms of importin alpha contribute to the regulation of plant nuclear protein transport.
