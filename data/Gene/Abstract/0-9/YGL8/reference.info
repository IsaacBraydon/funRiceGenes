NA	Map-based cloning and functional analysis of YGL8, which controls leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa).	2016	BMC Plant Biol	Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, Rice Research Institute of Southwest University, Chongqing, 400716, China.	As the indispensable part of plant, leaf blade mainly functions as the production workshops where organic substance is produced by photosynthesis. Leaf colour mutation is a genetic phenomenon that has a high frequency and is easily identified. The mutations always exhibit negative impact on the development of plants in any of the different stages of growth. Up to now, numerous genes involved in leaf colour mutations have been cloned.In this study, a yellow-green leaf mutant, yellow-green leaf 8 (ygl8), with stable genetic phenotype, has been screened out in the progeny of an excellent indica restorer line Jinhui 10 with seeds treated by EMS. The levels of Chl a, Chl b and total chlorophyll were significantly lower in ygl8 than those in the WT throughout the whole growth period, while no clear change was noted in the Chl a/b ratio. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the lamellae were clearly intumescent and intricately stacked in ygl8. Furthermore, compared with those of the WT, the stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate of ylg8 were all significantly lower. Map-based cloning results showed that Loc_Os01g73450, encoding a chloroplast-targeted UMP kinase, corresponded to Ygl8 and played an important role in regulating leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa). Complementation of ygl8 with the WT DNA sequence of Loc_Os01g73450 led to restoration of the normal phenotype, and transgenic RNA interference plants showed a yellow-green colour. Analysis of the spatial and temporal expression of Ygl8 indicated that it was highly expressed in leaf blades and weakly expressed in other tissues. qRT-PCR also showed that the expression levels of the major Photosystem I core subunits plastome-encoded PsaA, PsaB and PsbC were significantly reduced in ygl8. The expression levels of nuclear-encoded gene involved in Chl biosynthesis HEMC, HEME, and PORA were also decreased when compared with the wild-type.Independent of Chl biosynthesis and photosystem, YGL8 may affect the structure and function of chloroplasts grana lamellae by regulating plastid genome encoded thylakoid membrane constitutive gene expression and indirectly influences Chl biosynthesis.
NA	UMP kinase activity is involved in proper chloroplast development in rice.	2018	Photosynth Res	College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University, Zhejiang, China.	Isolation of leaf-color mutants is important in understanding the mechanisms of chloroplast biogenesis and development. In this study, we identified and characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, yellow leaf 2 (yl2), exhibiting pale yellow leaves with a few longitudinal white stripes at the early seedling stage then gradually turning yellow. Genetic analyses revealed that YL2 encodes a thylakoid membrane-localized protein with significant sequence similarity to UMP kinase proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Prokaryotic UMP kinase activity was subsequently confirmed, with YL2 deficiency causing a significant reduction in chlorophyll accumulation and photochemical efficiency. Moreover, YL2 is also light dependent and preferentially expressed in green tissues. Chloroplast development was abnormal in the yl2 mutant, possibly due to reduced accumulation of thylakoid membranes and a lack of normal stroma lamellae. 2D Blue-Native SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses revealed a reduction in several subunits of photosynthetic complexes, in particular, the AtpB subunit of ATP synthase, while mRNA levels of corresponding genes were unchanged or increased compared with the wild type. In addition, we observed a significant decrease (ca. 36.3%) in cpATPase activity in the yl2 mutant compared with the wild type. Taken together, our results suggest that UMP kinase activity plays an essential role in chloroplast development and regulating cpATPase biogenesis in rice.
