YGL8|YL2	leaf	Map-based cloning and functional analysis of YGL8, which controls leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa).	Map-based cloning results showed that Loc_Os01g73450, encoding a chloroplast-targeted UMP kinase, corresponded to Ygl8 and played an important role in regulating leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa)
YGL8|YL2	leaf	Map-based cloning and functional analysis of YGL8, which controls leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa).	Analysis of the spatial and temporal expression of Ygl8 indicated that it was highly expressed in leaf blades and weakly expressed in other tissues
YGL8|YL2	growth	Map-based cloning and functional analysis of YGL8, which controls leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa).	The levels of Chl a, Chl b and total chlorophyll were significantly lower in ygl8 than those in the WT throughout the whole growth period, while no clear change was noted in the Chl a/b ratio
YGL8|YL2	map-based cloning	Map-based cloning and functional analysis of YGL8, which controls leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa).	Map-based cloning results showed that Loc_Os01g73450, encoding a chloroplast-targeted UMP kinase, corresponded to Ygl8 and played an important role in regulating leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa)
YGL8|YL2	Chl biosynthesis	Map-based cloning and functional analysis of YGL8, which controls leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa).	Independent of Chl biosynthesis and photosystem, YGL8 may affect the structure and function of chloroplasts grana lamellae by regulating plastid genome encoded thylakoid membrane constitutive gene expression and indirectly influences Chl biosynthesis
YGL8|YL2	chloroplast	UMP kinase activity is involved in proper chloroplast development in rice.	 Chloroplast development was abnormal in the yl2 mutant, possibly due to reduced accumulation of thylakoid membranes and a lack of normal stroma lamellae
YGL8|YL2	development	UMP kinase activity is involved in proper chloroplast development in rice.	 Chloroplast development was abnormal in the yl2 mutant, possibly due to reduced accumulation of thylakoid membranes and a lack of normal stroma lamellae
YGL8|YL2	Kinase	UMP kinase activity is involved in proper chloroplast development in rice.	 Genetic analyses revealed that YL2 encodes a thylakoid membrane-localized protein with significant sequence similarity to UMP kinase proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes
YGL8|YL2	Kinase	UMP kinase activity is involved in proper chloroplast development in rice.	 Prokaryotic UMP kinase activity was subsequently confirmed, with YL2 deficiency causing a significant reduction in chlorophyll accumulation and photochemical efficiency
YGL8|YL2	stroma	UMP kinase activity is involved in proper chloroplast development in rice.	 Chloroplast development was abnormal in the yl2 mutant, possibly due to reduced accumulation of thylakoid membranes and a lack of normal stroma lamellae
YGL8|YL2	chloroplast development	UMP kinase activity is involved in proper chloroplast development in rice.	 Chloroplast development was abnormal in the yl2 mutant, possibly due to reduced accumulation of thylakoid membranes and a lack of normal stroma lamellae
