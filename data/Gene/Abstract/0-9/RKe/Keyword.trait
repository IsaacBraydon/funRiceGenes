RKe	temperature	A pair of orthologs of a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase-like disease resistance gene family regulates rice response to raised temperature	Transcriptional activation of NRKe or 9RKe resulted in the formation of temperature-sensitive lesion mimics, which were spots of dead cells associated with accumulation of superoxides, in different organs of the transgenic plants
RKe	temperature	A pair of orthologs of a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase-like disease resistance gene family regulates rice response to raised temperature	CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the RKe locus is involved in rice response to raised temperature
RKe	temperature	A pair of orthologs of a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase-like disease resistance gene family regulates rice response to raised temperature	The LRR domain of RKe protein appears to be important to sense increased temperature
RKe	temperature	A pair of orthologs of a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase-like disease resistance gene family regulates rice response to raised temperature	The RKe-involved temperature-related pathway and Xa3/Xa26-mediated disease-resistance pathway may partially overlap
RKe	disease	A pair of orthologs of a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase-like disease resistance gene family regulates rice response to raised temperature	The RKe-involved temperature-related pathway and Xa3/Xa26-mediated disease-resistance pathway may partially overlap
