YSS1	seedlings	Young Seedling Stripe1 encodes a chloroplast nucleoid-associated protein required for chloroplast development in rice seedlings.	Furthermore, levels of chloroplast proteins are mostly reduced in yss1 seedlings
YSS1	seedling	Young Seedling Stripe1 encodes a chloroplast nucleoid-associated protein required for chloroplast development in rice seedlings.	Together, our findings identify YSS1 as a novel regulator of PEP activity essential for chloroplast development at rice seedling stage
YSS1	chloroplast	Young Seedling Stripe1 encodes a chloroplast nucleoid-associated protein required for chloroplast development in rice seedlings.	YSS1 encodes a chloroplast nucleoid-localized protein belonging to the DUF3727 superfamily
YSS1	chloroplast	Young Seedling Stripe1 encodes a chloroplast nucleoid-associated protein required for chloroplast development in rice seedlings.	Furthermore, levels of chloroplast proteins are mostly reduced in yss1 seedlings
YSS1	chloroplast	Young Seedling Stripe1 encodes a chloroplast nucleoid-associated protein required for chloroplast development in rice seedlings.	Together, our findings identify YSS1 as a novel regulator of PEP activity essential for chloroplast development at rice seedling stage
