WLP1	photosynthesis	The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions	 The transcription pattern of a number of genes involved in plastidial transcription/translation and in photosynthesis was altered in the wlp1 mutants
WLP1	chloroplast	The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions	 The WLP1 protein localized to the chloroplast| These results reveal that WLP1 is required for normal chloroplast development, especially under low temperature conditions|The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions
WLP1	panicle	The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions	 Here we describe a rice mutant named wlp1 (white leaf and panicles 1) selected from a population of tissue culture regenerants
WLP1	leaf	The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions	 Here we describe a rice mutant named wlp1 (white leaf and panicles 1) selected from a population of tissue culture regenerants
WLP1	seedling	The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions	 WLP1 was mainly transcribed in green tissues and particularly abundantly in the early seedling leaves
WLP1	temperature	The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions	" In addition, the expression level of WLP1 was induced by the low temperature| These results reveal that WLP1 is required for normal chloroplast development, especially under low temperature conditions|The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions"
