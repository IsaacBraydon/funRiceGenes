WP1|OsValRS2	chloroplast	WHITE PANICLE1, a Val-tRNA synthetase regulating chloroplast ribosome biogenesis in rice, is essential for early chloroplast development.	Chlorophyll autofluorescence observations and transmission electron microscopy analyses indicated that wp1 mutants are defective in early chloroplast development
WP1|OsValRS2	chloroplast	WHITE PANICLE1, a Val-tRNA synthetase regulating chloroplast ribosome biogenesis in rice, is essential for early chloroplast development.	Western blot analyses of chloroplast-encoded proteins showed that wp1 mutants were defective in chloroplast protein synthesis, although transcription of some genes was higher in wp1 than in wild type
WP1|OsValRS2	chloroplast	WHITE PANICLE1, a Val-tRNA synthetase regulating chloroplast ribosome biogenesis in rice, is essential for early chloroplast development.	We found that wp1 was impaired in chloroplast ribosome biogenesis
