Chloroplast development is a complex process that is critical for the growth and development of plants. Pentapeptide repeat (PPR) proteins contain large members but only few of them have been characterized in rice. In this study, we identified a new PLS-type protein, WAL3 (Whole Albino Leaf on Chromosome 3), playing important roles in plant chloroplast development. Knockout of WAL3 gene in Nipponbare variety caused abnormal chloroplast development and showed an albino lethal phenotype. Expression analysis showed that WAL3 gene was constitutively expressed with the highest expression in leaves. The WAL3 protein localized in chloroplasts and affected the splicing of multiple group II introns. Transcriptome sequencing showed that WAL3 involved in multiple metabolic pathways including the chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthetic related metabolic pathways. The decreased abundance of photosynthesis-related proteins in wal3 mutants indicated WAL3 influence photosynthesis. In summary, our study revealed that WAL3 is essential for chloroplast development in rice.
