WSL4|CUT1L|HMS1	pollen	HMS1 Interacts with HMS1I to Regulate Very-long-chain Fatty Acid Biosynthesis and the Humidity-sensitive Genic Male Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa).	 HMS1 catalyzed the biosynthesis of the C26 and C28 VLCFAs, contributing to the formation of bacula and tryphine in the pollen wall, which protect the pollen from dehydration
WSL4|CUT1L|HMS1	pollen	HMS1 Interacts with HMS1I to Regulate Very-long-chain Fatty Acid Biosynthesis and the Humidity-sensitive Genic Male Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa).	 Under low-humidity, hms1 pollen showed poor adhesion and reduced germination on the stigmas, which could be rescued by increasing humidity
WSL4|CUT1L|HMS1	sterility	HMS1 Interacts with HMS1I to Regulate Very-long-chain Fatty Acid Biosynthesis and the Humidity-sensitive Genic Male Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa).	HMS1 Interacts with HMS1I to Regulate Very-long-chain Fatty Acid Biosynthesis and the Humidity-sensitive Genic Male Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa).
WSL4|CUT1L|HMS1	seed	HMS1 Interacts with HMS1I to Regulate Very-long-chain Fatty Acid Biosynthesis and the Humidity-sensitive Genic Male Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa).	 The hms1 mutant displayed decreased seed setting at low-humidity, but normal seed setting at high-humidity
WSL4|CUT1L|HMS1	breeding	HMS1 Interacts with HMS1I to Regulate Very-long-chain Fatty Acid Biosynthesis and the Humidity-sensitive Genic Male Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa).	 Furthermore, both japonica and indica rice varieties with defective HMS1 exhibited HGMS, suggesting that hms1 could potentially be used in hybrid breeding
WSL4|CUT1L|HMS1	male sterility	HMS1 Interacts with HMS1I to Regulate Very-long-chain Fatty Acid Biosynthesis and the Humidity-sensitive Genic Male Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa).	HMS1 Interacts with HMS1I to Regulate Very-long-chain Fatty Acid Biosynthesis and the Humidity-sensitive Genic Male Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa).
WSL4|CUT1L|HMS1	pollen wall	HMS1 Interacts with HMS1I to Regulate Very-long-chain Fatty Acid Biosynthesis and the Humidity-sensitive Genic Male Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa).	 HMS1 catalyzed the biosynthesis of the C26 and C28 VLCFAs, contributing to the formation of bacula and tryphine in the pollen wall, which protect the pollen from dehydration
