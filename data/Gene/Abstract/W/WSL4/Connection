OsCER2|OsHMS1I	WSL4|CUT1L|HMS1	A beta-ketoacyl-CoA synthase is Involved in Rice Leaf Cuticular Wax Synthesis and requires a CER2-LIKE Protein as a Cofactor	We further isolated a cofactor of WSL4, OsCER2, a homolog of Arabidopsis CER2, by coimmunoprecipitation, and confirmed their physical interaction by split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid experiments
OsCER2|OsHMS1I	WSL4|CUT1L|HMS1	A beta-ketoacyl-CoA synthase is Involved in Rice Leaf Cuticular Wax Synthesis and requires a CER2-LIKE Protein as a Cofactor	Coexpression of WSL4 and OsCER2 in elo3 yeast cells yielded fatty acids up to C30
OsCER2|OsHMS1I	WSL4|CUT1L|HMS1	A beta-ketoacyl-CoA synthase is Involved in Rice Leaf Cuticular Wax Synthesis and requires a CER2-LIKE Protein as a Cofactor	These results demonstrated that WSL4 was involved in VLCFA elongation beyond C22 and that elongation beyond C24 required the participation of OsCER2
