NA	A beta-ketoacyl-CoA synthase is Involved in Rice Leaf Cuticular Wax Synthesis and requires a CER2-LIKE Protein as a Cofactor.	2016	Plant Physiol	Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences CITY: Beijing China [CN].	Cuticular waxes are complex mixtures of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and their derivatives, forming a natural barrier on aerial surfaces of terrestrial plants against biotic and abiotic stresses. In VLCFA biosynthesis, beta-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS) is the key enzyme, catalyzing the first reaction in fatty acid elongation and determining substrate specificity. We isolated a rice (Oryza sativa L.) wax crystal-sparse leaf 4 (WSL4) gene using a map-based cloning strategy. WSL4 is predicted to encode a KCS, a homolog of Arabidopsis CER6. Complementation of the mutant wsl4-1 with WSL4 genomic DNA rescued the cuticular wax-deficient phenotype, confirming the function of WSL4. The load of wax components longer than 30 carbons (C30) and C28 were reduced markedly in wsl4-1 and wsl4-2 mutants, respectively. Overexpression of WSL4 increased the cuticular wax load in rice leaves. We further isolated a cofactor of WSL4, OsCER2, a homolog of Arabidopsis CER2, by coimmunoprecipitation, and confirmed their physical interaction by split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid experiments. Expression of WSL4 alone in elo3 yeast cells resulted in increased C24 but did not produce VLCFAs of greater length, whereas expressing OsCER2 alone showed no effect. Coexpression of WSL4 and OsCER2 in elo3 yeast cells yielded fatty acids up to C30. OsCER2 with a mutated HxxxD motif (H172E, D176A, and D176H) interrupted its interaction with WSL4 and failed to elongate VLCFAs past C24 when expressed with WSL4 in elo3 yeast cells. These results demonstrated that WSL4 was involved in VLCFA elongation beyond C22 and that elongation beyond C24 required the participation of OsCER2.
NA	Ethylene Biosynthesis Is Promoted by Very-Long-Chain Fatty Acids during Lysigenous Aerenchyma Formation in Rice Roots.	2015	Plant Physiol	Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan (T.Y., A.F., H.M., Mik.N.);Department of Bioscience, Fukui Prefectural University, Eiheiji-cho, Yoshida, Fukui 910-1195, Japan (K.S.);Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saitama University, Sakura-ku, Saitama 338-8570, Japan (Min.N., M.K.-Y.);Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan (M.A., N.K.N., N.T.);Graduate School of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-8589, Japan (I.T.);Research Institute for Bioresources and Biotechnology, Ishikawa Prefectural University, Ishikawa 921-8836, Japan (N.K.N.); andDepartment of Crop Science, Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, Obihiro, Hokkaido 080-8555, Japan (K.K.).	In rice (Oryza sativa) roots, lysigenous aerenchyma, which is created by programmed cell death and lysis of cortical cells, is constitutively formed under aerobic conditions, and its formation is further induced under oxygen-deficient conditions. Ethylene is involved in the induction of aerenchyma formation. reduced culm number1 (rcn1) is a rice mutant in which the gene encoding the ATP-binding cassette transporter RCN1/OsABCG5 is defective. Here, we report that the induction of aerenchyma formation was reduced in roots of rcn1 grown in stagnant deoxygenated nutrient solution (i.e. under stagnant conditions, which mimic oxygen-deficient conditions in waterlogged soils). 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) is a key enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis. Stagnant conditions hardly induced the expression of ACS1 in rcn1 roots, resulting in low ethylene production in the roots. Accumulation of saturated very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) of 24, 26, and 28 carbons was reduced in rcn1 roots. Exogenously supplied VLCFA (26 carbons) increased the expression level of ACS1 and induced aerenchyma formation in rcn1 roots. Moreover, in rice lines in which the gene encoding a fatty acid elongase, CUT1-LIKE (CUT1L; a homolog of the gene encoding Arabidopsis CUT1, which is required for cuticular wax production), was silenced, both ACS1 expression and aerenchyma formation were reduced. Interestingly, the expression of ACS1, CUT1L, and RCN1/OsABCG5 was induced predominantly in the outer part of roots under stagnant conditions. These results suggest that, in rice under oxygen-deficient conditions, VLCFAs increase ethylene production by promoting 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid biosynthesis in the outer part of roots, which, in turn, induces aerenchyma formation in the root cortex.
NA	HMS1 Interacts with HMS1I to Regulate Very-long-chain Fatty Acid Biosynthesis and the Humidity-sensitive Genic Male Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa).	2019	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, Instrumental Analysis and Research Center, College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Environment-sensitive male sterility (EGMS) lines are widely used in two-line hybrid breeding in rice (Oryza sativa). At present, photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterility (PGMS) lines and thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) lines are predominantly used in two-line hybrid rice, with humidity-sensitive genic male sterility (HGMS) lines rarely being reported. Here, we showed that HUMIDITY-SENSITIVE GENIC MALE STERILITY 1 (HMS1), encoding a ¦Â-ketoacyl-CoA synthase, plays key roles in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and HGMS in rice. The hms1 mutant displayed decreased seed setting at low-humidity, but normal seed setting at high-humidity. HMS1 catalyzed the biosynthesis of the C26 and C28 VLCFAs, contributing to the formation of bacula and tryphine in the pollen wall, which protect the pollen from dehydration. Under low-humidity, hms1 pollen showed poor adhesion and reduced germination on the stigmas, which could be rescued by increasing humidity. HMS1-INTERACTING PROTEIN (HMS1I) interacted with HMS1 to co-regulate HGMS. Furthermore, both japonica and indica rice varieties with defective HMS1 exhibited HGMS, suggesting that hms1 could potentially be used in hybrid breeding. Our results reveal the novel mechanism of VLCFA-mediated pollen wall formation, which protects pollen from low-humidity stress in rice, and has a potential use in hybrid crop breeding.
