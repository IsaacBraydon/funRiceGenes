NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	NAL3	The rice narrow leaf2 and narrow leaf3 loci encode WUSCHEL-related homeobox 3A (OsWOX3A) and function in leaf, spikelet, tiller and lateral root development	 In order to understand the molecular genetic mechanisms of rice (Oryza sativa) organ development, we studied the narrow leaf2 narrow leaf3 (nal2 nal3; hereafter nal2/3) double mutant, which produces narrow-curly leaves, more tillers, fewer lateral roots, opened spikelets and narrow-thin grains
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	NAL3	The rice narrow leaf2 and narrow leaf3 loci encode WUSCHEL-related homeobox 3A (OsWOX3A) and function in leaf, spikelet, tiller and lateral root development	 Map-based cloning revealed that NAL2 and NAL3 are paralogs that encode an identical OsWOX3A (OsNS) transcriptional activator, homologous to NARROW SHEATH1 (NS1) and NS2 in maize and PRESSED FLOWER in Arabidopsis
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	NAL3	Two WUSCHEL-related homeobox genes, narrow leaf2 and narrow leaf3, control leaf width in rice	 The narrow-leaf phenotype of FL90 shows a two-factor recessive inheritance and is caused by the loss of function of two WUSCHEL-related homeobox genes, NAL2 and NAL3 (NAL2/3), which are duplicate genes orthologous to maize NS1 and NS2 and to Arabidopsis PRS
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene represses a YABBY gene expression required for rice leaf development	 Here, we report the characterization of functional relationship between rice (Oryza sativa) YAB3 and WOX3 in rice leaf development
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene represses a YABBY gene expression required for rice leaf development	 Rice YAB3 is closely related to maize (Zea mays) ZmYAB14 and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL), whereas rice WOX3 is highly conserved with maize narrow sheath1 (NS1) and NS2 and Arabidopsis PRESSED FLOWER (PRS)
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene represses a YABBY gene expression required for rice leaf development	 Overexpression of WOX3 repressed YAB3 and showed a YAB3 RNAi phenotype
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene represses a YABBY gene expression required for rice leaf development	 The expression of class I KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX (KNOX) genes was ectopically induced in leaves of YAB3 RNAi or WOX3 overexpression plants
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene represses a YABBY gene expression required for rice leaf development	 Data from inducible WOX3 expression and DNA-protein interaction assays suggested that WOX3 acted as a transcriptional repressor of YAB3
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene represses a YABBY gene expression required for rice leaf development	 These data reveal a regulatory network involving YAB3, WOX3, and KNOX genes required for rice leaf development
KAO	NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsWOX3A is involved in negative feedback regulation of the gibberellic acid biosynthetic pathway in rice (Oryza sativa).	 Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that OsWOX3A directly interacts with the KAO promoter
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	NAL3	OsWOX3A is involved in negative feedback regulation of the gibberellic acid biosynthetic pathway in rice (Oryza sativa).	 Among the rice (Oryza sativa) WOX proteins, a loss of OsWOX3A function in narrow leaf2 (nal2) nal3 double mutants (termed nal2/3) causes pleiotropic effects, such as narrow and curly leaves, opened spikelets, narrow grains, more tillers, and fewer lateral roots, but almost normal plant height
