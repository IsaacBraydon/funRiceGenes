NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	NAL3	Two WUSCHEL-related homeobox genes, narrow leaf2 and narrow leaf3, control leaf width in rice	The narrow-leaf phenotype of FL90 shows a two-factor recessive inheritance and is caused by the loss of function of two WUSCHEL-related homeobox genes, NAL2 and NAL3 (NAL2/3), which are duplicate genes orthologous to maize NS1 and NS2 and to Arabidopsis PRS

NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene represses a YABBY gene expression required for rice leaf development	Rice YAB3 is closely related to maize (Zea mays) ZmYAB14 and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL), whereas rice WOX3 is highly conserved with maize narrow sheath1 (NS1) and NS2 and Arabidopsis PRESSED FLOWER (PRS)
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene represses a YABBY gene expression required for rice leaf development	Overexpression of WOX3 repressed YAB3 and showed a YAB3 RNAi phenotype
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene represses a YABBY gene expression required for rice leaf development	The expression of class I KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX (KNOX) genes was ectopically induced in leaves of YAB3 RNAi or WOX3 overexpression plants
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsYABBY5|OsYAB3|TOB1	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene represses a YABBY gene expression required for rice leaf development	Data from inducible WOX3 expression and DNA-protein interaction assays suggested that WOX3 acted as a transcriptional repressor of YAB3

KAO	NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsWOX3A is involved in negative feedback regulation of the gibberellic acid biosynthetic pathway in rice (Oryza sativa).	Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that OsWOX3A directly interacts with the KAO promoter
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	NAL3	OsWOX3A is involved in negative feedback regulation of the gibberellic acid biosynthetic pathway in rice (Oryza sativa).	Among the rice (Oryza sativa) WOX proteins, a loss of OsWOX3A function in narrow leaf2 (nal2) nal3 double mutants (termed nal2/3) causes pleiotropic effects, such as narrow and curly leaves, opened spikelets, narrow grains, more tillers, and fewer lateral roots, but almost normal plant height
KAO	NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	Regulatory role of the OsWOX3A transcription factor in rice root development.	In a recent study, we demonstrated that OsWOX3A directly binds to the promoter of the KAO gene, which encodes ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase, an enzyme involved in GA biosynthesis, and represses KAO expression
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7	Genetic analysis of rice mutants responsible for narrow leaf phenotype and reduced vein number.	In this paper, we examined the function of four genes that regulate the width of the leaf blade and the vein number: NARROW LEAF1 (NAL1), NAL2, NAL3 and NAL7
NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7	Genetic analysis of rice mutants responsible for narrow leaf phenotype and reduced vein number.	The nal7 mutation showed additive effects on both leaf width and vein number, when combined with the nal1 single or the nal2 nal3 double mutation

In this study, we show that a WOX3 gene, LEAF LATERAL SYMMETRY1 (LSY1), regulates lateral leaf development in a different manner than that of other duplicated paralogs of WOX3, NARROW LEAF2 (NAL2)/NAL3, in rice
GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	LEAF LATERAL SYMMETRY1, a member of the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX3 gene family, regulates lateral outgrowth of leaves in rice.
