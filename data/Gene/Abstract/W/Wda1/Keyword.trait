WDA1	cuticle	The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice	Two genes CYP704B2 and WDA1, involved in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids for the establishment of the anther cuticle and pollen exine, were downregulated in osabcg15 mutant, suggesting that OsABCG15 may play a key function in the processes related to sporopollenin biosynthesis or sporopollenin transfer from tapetal cells to anther locules
WDA1	tapetum	Wax-deficient anther1 is involved in cuticle and wax production in rice anther walls and is required for pollen development	These biochemical and developmental defects in tapetum found in wda1 mutants are earlier events than those in other male-sterile mutants, which showed defects of lipidic molecules in exine
WDA1	pollen	The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice	Two genes CYP704B2 and WDA1, involved in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids for the establishment of the anther cuticle and pollen exine, were downregulated in osabcg15 mutant, suggesting that OsABCG15 may play a key function in the processes related to sporopollenin biosynthesis or sporopollenin transfer from tapetal cells to anther locules
WDA1	tapetal	The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice	Two genes CYP704B2 and WDA1, involved in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids for the establishment of the anther cuticle and pollen exine, were downregulated in osabcg15 mutant, suggesting that OsABCG15 may play a key function in the processes related to sporopollenin biosynthesis or sporopollenin transfer from tapetal cells to anther locules
WDA1	sterile	Wax-deficient anther1 is involved in cuticle and wax production in rice anther walls and is required for pollen development	These biochemical and developmental defects in tapetum found in wda1 mutants are earlier events than those in other male-sterile mutants, which showed defects of lipidic molecules in exine
WDA1	anther	Wax-deficient anther1 is involved in cuticle and wax production in rice anther walls and is required for pollen development	Here, we report the characterization of a T-DNA insertional mutant in the Wax-deficient anther1 (Wda1) gene of rice (Oryza sativa), which shows significant defects in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids in both layers
WDA1	anther	The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice	Two genes CYP704B2 and WDA1, involved in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids for the establishment of the anther cuticle and pollen exine, were downregulated in osabcg15 mutant, suggesting that OsABCG15 may play a key function in the processes related to sporopollenin biosynthesis or sporopollenin transfer from tapetal cells to anther locules
