OsMPK6|OsMPK4	WRKY70|OsWRKY70	Molecular dissection of early defense signaling underlying volatile-mediated defense regulation and herbivore resistance in rice.	 Using transgenic plants defective in early signaling, we show that OsMPK3 is required, and that OsMPK6 and OsWRKY70 contribute to indole-mediated defense priming of JA-dependent herbivore resistance

Silencing OsI-BAK1 (ir-ibak1) in rice enhanced the BPH-induced transcript levels of three defense-related WRKY genes (OsWRKY24, OsWRKY53 and OsWRKY70) but decreased the induced levels of ethylene
