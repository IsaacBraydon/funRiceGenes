NA	Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.	2015	Elife	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Plants generally respond to herbivore attack by increasing resistance and decreasing growth. This prioritization is achieved through the regulation of phytohormonal signaling networks. However, it remains unknown how this prioritization affects resistance against non-target herbivores. In this study, we identify WRKY70 as a specific herbivore-induced, mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated rice transcription factor that physically interacts with W-box motives and prioritizes defence over growth by positively regulating jasmonic acid (JA) and negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis upon attack by the chewing herbivore Chilo suppressalis. WRKY70-dependent JA biosynthesis is required for proteinase inhibitor activation and resistance against C. suppressalis. In contrast, WRKY70 induction increases plant susceptibility against the rice brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens. Experiments with GA-deficient rice lines identify WRKY70-dependent GA signaling as the causal factor in N. lugens susceptibility. Our study shows that prioritizing defence over growth leads to a significant resistance trade-off with important implications for the evolution and agricultural exploitation of plant immunity.
NA	Molecular dissection of early defense signaling underlying volatile-mediated defense regulation and herbivore resistance in rice.	2019	Plant Cell	University of Bern CITY: Bern Switzerland [CH].	Herbivore-induced plant volatiles prime plant defenses and resistance. How volatiles are integrated into early defense signaling is not well understood. Furthermore, whether there is a causal relationship between volatile defense priming and herbivore resistance is unclear. Here, we investigated the impact of indole, a common herbivore-induced plant volatile and known modulator of a wide range of physiological processes in plants, bacteria and animals, on early defense signaling and herbivore resistance in rice. We show that rice plants infested by Spodoptera frugiperda caterpillars release indole up to 25 ng*h-1. Exposure to equal doses of exogenous indole enhances rice resistance to S. frugiperda. Screening of early signaling components reveals that indole pre-exposure directly enhances the expression of the receptor like kinase OsLRR-RLK1. Furthermore, indole-pre exposure followed by simulated herbivory increases (i.e. primes) the transcription, accumulation and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase OsMPK3 as well as the expression of the downstream WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY70 and several jasmonate biosynthesis genes, resulting in a higher accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA). Using transgenic plants defective in early signaling, we show that OsMPK3 is required, and that OsMPK6 and OsWRKY70 contribute to indole-mediated defense priming of JA-dependent herbivore resistance. We conclude that herbivore-induced plant volatiles can increase herbivore resistance of plants through positive regulation of early defense signaling components.
NA	Salicylic acid application alleviates cadmium accumulation in brown rice by modulating its shoot to grain translocation in rice	2021	Chemosphere	Key Laboratory of Marine Food Quality and Hazard Controlling Technology of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, 310018, China. Electronic address: wfj0311@cjlu.edu.cn.	Cadmium (Cd) contamination, which poses a serious threat to human health, has been recognized as a major threat to the agricultural system and crop production. Salicylic acid (SA) is a signaling molecule that plays an important role in against Cd toxicity. Previously, we found that spraying rice with SA could reduce the Cd accumulation in rice grains grown in Cd-contaminated soil. In this study, we studied the specific mechanism of SA spray on reducing Cd accumulation in rice grain. The results showed that treatment with SA could alleviate Cd toxicity in rice by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes that reduce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation, but not by changing the pH, or total or available Cd of the soil. The key factor by which SA treatment reduced Cd accumulation in rice grains was by decreasing the Cd content in rice leaves at the flowering stage. This indicated that SA could modulate the Cd accumulation in shoots, reducing the Cd translocation to rice grains. Furthermore, SA could increase the H2O2 content, activating the SA-signaling pathway and modulating the expression levels of Cd transporters (OsLCT1 and OsLCD) in rice leaves to increase Cd tolerance and reduce Cd accumulation in the rice grain. Thus, spraying rice with SA may be effective measure to cope with Cd contamination in paddy soils.
NA	Silencing a Simple Extracellular Leucine-Rich Repeat Gene OsI-BAK1 Enhances the Resistance of Rice to Brown Planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.	2021	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology &amp; Ministry of Agriculture Key Lab of Agricultural Entomology, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Many plant proteins with extracellular leucine-rich repeat (eLRR) domains play an important role in plant immunity. However, the role of one class of eLRR plant proteins-the simple eLRR proteins-in plant defenses against herbivores remains largely unknown. Here, we found that a simple eLRR protein OsI-BAK1 in rice localizes to the plasma membrane. Its expression was induced by mechanical wounding, the infestation of gravid females of brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens or white-backed planthopper Sogatella furcifera and treatment with methyl jasmonate or abscisic acid. Silencing OsI-BAK1 (ir-ibak1) in rice enhanced the BPH-induced transcript levels of three defense-related WRKY genes (OsWRKY24, OsWRKY53 and OsWRKY70) but decreased the induced levels of ethylene. Bioassays revealed that the hatching rate was significantly lower in BPH eggs laid on ir-ibak1 plants than wild-type (WT) plants; moreover, gravid BPH females preferred to oviposit on WT plants over ir-ibak1 plants. The exogenous application of ethephon on ir-ibak1 plants eliminated the BPH oviposition preference between WT and ir-ibak1 plants but had no effect on the hatching rate of BPH eggs. These findings suggest that OsI-BAK1 acts as a negative modulator of defense responses in rice to BPH and that BPH might exploit this modulator for its own benefit.
