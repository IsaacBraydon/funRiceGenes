WRKY70	growth	Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.	 In this study, we identify WRKY70 as a specific herbivore-induced, mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated rice transcription factor that physically interacts with W-box motives and prioritizes defence over growth by positively regulating jasmonic acid (JA) and negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis upon attack by the chewing herbivore Chilo suppressalis
WRKY70	gibberellin	Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.	 In this study, we identify WRKY70 as a specific herbivore-induced, mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated rice transcription factor that physically interacts with W-box motives and prioritizes defence over growth by positively regulating jasmonic acid (JA) and negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis upon attack by the chewing herbivore Chilo suppressalis
WRKY70	transcription factor	Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.	 In this study, we identify WRKY70 as a specific herbivore-induced, mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated rice transcription factor that physically interacts with W-box motives and prioritizes defence over growth by positively regulating jasmonic acid (JA) and negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis upon attack by the chewing herbivore Chilo suppressalis
WRKY70	brown planthopper	Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.	 In contrast, WRKY70 induction increases plant susceptibility against the rice brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens
