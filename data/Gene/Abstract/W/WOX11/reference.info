10.1007-s11105-012-0468-9.pdf	Overexpression of a Transcription Factor OsMADS15 Modifies Plant Architecture and Flowering Time in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2012	Plant Molecular Biology Reporter	Institute of Crop Science, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Yuhangtang Road 866, Hangzhou, 310058, China	The MADS-box gene family encodes conserved transcription factors and functions not only in reproductive development, but also in vegetative growth. In this study, a rice MADS-box gene OsMADS15, an ortholog of Arabidopsis AP1 gene, has been functionally characterized. Rice seedlings overexpressing OsMADS15 showed precocious phenotypes of early internode elongation, shoot-borne crown root development, reduced plant height and early flowering. The axillary buds developments in OsMADS15 overexpressors were accelerated, and the buds frequently grew into effective tillers. The panicles of OsMADS15 transgenic rice plants were largely compromised for growth and branching in comparison with wild type. In the tillering stage, the OsMADS15 overexpression rice plants tillered later and less than the wild type, and in the maturity stage, the culms of the overexpression lines bore more stem nodes. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results showed that expression levels of WUSCHEL-related Homeobox (WOX) gene, WOX11, and some flowering regulators were promoted in the OsMADS15 overexpression transgenic plants, indicating that OsMADS15 had a wide range of regulations. These results clearly indicate that OsMADS15 plays important roles not only in transition to reproductive development, but also in crown root development.
Plant Cell-2009-Zhao-tpc.108.061655.pdf	The WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene WOX11 is required to activate shoot-borne crown root development in rice	2009	Plant Cell	National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, 430070 Wuhan, China.	In rice (Oryza sativa), the shoot-borne crown roots are the major root type and are initiated at lower stem nodes as part of normal plant development. However, the regulatory mechanism of crown root development is poorly understood. In this work, we show that a WUSCHEL-related Homeobox (WOX) gene, WOX11, is involved in the activation of crown root emergence and growth. WOX11 was found to be expressed in emerging crown roots and later in cell division regions of the root meristem. The expression could be induced by exogenous auxin or cytokinin. Loss-of-function mutation or downregulation of the gene reduced the number and the growth rate of crown roots, whereas overexpression of the gene induced precocious crown root growth and dramatically increased the root biomass by producing crown roots at the upper stem nodes and the base of florets. The expressions of auxin- and cytokinin-responsive genes were affected in WOX11 overexpression and RNA interference transgenic plants. Further analysis showed that WOX11 directly repressed RR2, a type-A cytokinin-responsive regulator gene that was found to be expressed in crown root primordia. The results suggest that WOX11 may be an integrator of auxin and cytokinin signaling that feeds into RR2 to regulate cell proliferation during crown root development.
NA	Improving rice tolerance to potassium deficiency by enhancing OsHAK16p:WOX11-controlled root development.	2015	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Lower-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Potassium (K) deficiency in plants confines root growth and decreases root-to-shoot ratio, thus limiting root K acquisition in culture medium. A WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) gene, WOX11, has been reported as an integrator of auxin and cytokinin signalling that regulates root cell proliferation. Here, we report that ectopic expression of WOX11 gene driven by the promoter of OsHAK16 encoding a low-K-enhanced K transporter led to an extensive root system and adventitious roots and more effective tiller numbers in rice. The WOX11-regulated root and shoot phenotypes in the OsHAK16p:WOX11 transgenic lines were supported by K-deficiency-enhanced expression of several RR genes encoding type-A cytokinin-responsive regulators, PIN genes encoding auxin transporters and Aux/IAA genes. In comparison with WT, the transgenic lines showed increases in root biomass, root activity and K concentrations in the whole plants, and higher soluble sugar concentrations in roots particularly under low K supply condition. The improvement of sugar partitioning to the roots by the expression of OsHAK16p:WOX11 was further indicated by increasing the expression of OsSUT1 and OsSUT4 genes in leaf blades and several OsMSTs genes in roots. Expression of OsHAK16p:WOX11 in the rice grown in moderate K-deficient soil increased total K uptake by 72% and grain yield by 24%-32%. The results suggest that enlarging root growth and development by the expression of WOX11 in roots could provide a useful option for increasing K acquisition efficiency and cereal crop productivity in low K soil.
NA	The Interaction between Rice ERF3 and WOX11 Promotes Crown Root Development by Regulating Gene Expression Involved in Cytokinin Signaling.	2015	Plant Cell	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, 430070 Wuhan, China zhaoyu@mail.hzau.edu.cn.	Crown roots are the main components of the fibrous root system in rice (Oryza sativa). WOX11, a WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene specifically expressed in the emerging crown root meristem, is a key regulator in crown root development. However, the nature of WOX11 function in crown root development has remained elusive. Here, we identified a rice AP2/ERF protein, ERF3, which interacts with WOX11 and was expressed in crown root initials and during crown root growth. Functional analysis revealed that ERF3 was essential for crown root development and acts in auxin- and cytokinin-responsive gene expression. Downregulation of ERF3 in wox11 mutants produced a more severe root phenotype. Also, increased expression of ERF3 could partially complement wox11, indicating that the two genes functioned cooperatively to regulate crown root development. ERF3 and WOX11 shared a common target, the cytokinin-responsive gene RR2. The expression of ERF3 and WOX11 only partially overlapped, underlining a spatio-temporal control of RR2 expression and crown root development. Furthermore, ERF3-regulated RR2 expression was involved in crown root initiation, while the ERF3/WOX11 interaction likely repressed RR2 during crown root elongation. These results define a mechanism regulating gene expression involved in cytokinin signaling during different stages of crown root development in rice.
NA	WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene WOX11 increases rice drought resistance by controlling root hair formation and root system development.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	a National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University , 430070 , Wuhan , China.	Roots are essential organs for anchoring plants, exploring and exploiting soil resources, and establishing plant-microorganisms communities in vascular plants. Rice has a complex root system architecture consisting of several root types, including primary roots, lateral roots, and crown roots. Crown roots constitute the major part of the rice root system and play important roles during the growing period. Recently, we have refined a mechanism that involves ERF3/WOX11 interaction is required to regulate the expression of genes in the cytokinin signaling pathway during the different stages of crown roots development in rice. In this study, we further analyzed the root phenotypes of WOX11 transgenic plants and revealed that WOX11 also actes in controlling root hair development and enhancing rice drought resistance, in addition to its roles in regulating crown root and lateral root development. Based on this new finding, we proposed the mechanism of that WOX11 is involved in drought resistance by modulating rice root system development.
NA	Rice Homeodomain Protein WOX11 Recruits a Histone Acetyltransferase Complex to Establish Programs of Cell Proliferation of Crown Root Meristem.	2017	Plant Cell	Huazhong Agricultural University CITY: Wuhan China [CN].	Shoot-borne crown roots are the major root system in cereals. Previous work has shown that the Wuschel-related homeobox gene WOX11 is necessary and sufficient to promote rice (Oryza sativa) crown root emergence and elongation. Here, we show that WOX11 recruits the ADA2-GCN5 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) module to activate downstream target genes in crown root meristem. Rice ADA2 and GCN5 genes are highly expressed in root meristem and are shown to be essential for cell division and growth. WOX11 and ADA2-GCN5 commonly target and regulate a set of root-specific genes involved in energy metabolism, cell wall biosynthesis, and hormone response, some of which are known to be important for root development. The results indicate that the recruitment of ADA2-GCN5 by WOX11 establishes gene expression programs of crown root meristem cell division and suggest that permissive chromatin modification involving histone acetylation is a strategy for WOX11 to stimulate root meristem development.
NA	Transcriptional regulatory network of WOX11 is involved in the control of crown root development, cytokinin signals, and redox in rice.	2017	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, 430070 Wuhan, China.	The rice root system is mainly composed of post-embryonic shoot-borne roots called crown roots. WOX11, encoding a WUSCHEL-related homeobox domain transcription factor, is a key regulator of crown root growth and development in rice (Oryza sativa. L). In addition to specifically activating crown root development, WOX11 is also involved in lateral root initiation, root hair formation, and abiotic stresses. However, the gene regulatory network downstream of WOX11 remains largely unknown. Here, we studied the transcriptome of wox11 root tips by RNA-Seq and determined direct WOX11-binding targets by bioinformatic and biochemical analysis. The transcriptomic analysis revealed 664 differentially expressed genes, which covered a wide range of functions related to root development, cytokinin homeostasis/signaling, stress response, and redox metabolic processes. Bioinformatic analysis also revealed that the WOX11-binding motif was distributed over 41% (273/664) of the differentially expressed genes, and was mostly enriched in the promoter and intron regions. We used qRT-PCR and/or in situ hybridization to confirm co-expression of some of the WOX11-regulated genes in crown root development. We also used electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-WOX11 antibody to validate direct regulation of these genes by WOX11. The analysis identified several genes that acted downstream of WOX11 in controlling crown root formation, cytokinin signaling, stress response, and redox metabolism. This work built a hierarchical regulatory model of WOX11 in rice crown root development.
NA	WOX11 recruits a histone H3K27me3 demethylase to promote gene expression during shoot development in rice.	2018	Nucleic Acids Res	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, 430070 Wuhan, China.	WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) genes are key regulators of meristem activity and plant development, the chromatin mechanism of which to reprogram gene expression remains unclear. Histone H3K27me3 is a chromatin mark of developmentally repressed genes. How the repressive mark is removed from specific genes during plant development is largely unknown. Here, we show that WOX11 interacts with the H3K27me3 demethylase JMJ705 to activate gene expression during shoot development in rice. Genetic analysis indicates that WOX11 and JMJ705 cooperatively control shoot growth and commonly regulate the expression of a set of genes involved in meristem identity, chloroplast biogenesis, and energy metabolism in the shoot apex. Loss of WOX11 led to increased H3K27me3 and overexpression of JMJ705 decreased the methylation levels at a subset of common targets. JMJ705 is associated with most of the WOX11-binding sites found in the tested common targets in vivo, regardless of presence or absence of the JMJ705-binding motif. Furthermore, wox11 mutation reduced JMJ705-binding to many targets genome-wide. The results suggest that recruitment of JMJ705 to specific developmental pathway genes is promoted by DNA-binding transcription factors and that WOX11 functions to stimulate shoot growth through epigenetic reprogramming of genes involved in meristem development and energy-generating pathways.
NA	The YUCCA-Auxin-WOX11 Module Controls Crown Root Development in Rice.	2018	Front Plant Sci	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	A well-developed root system in rice and other crops can ensure plants to efficiently absorb nutrients and water. Auxin is a key regulator for various aspect of root development, but the detailed molecular mechanisms by which auxin controls crown root development in rice are not understood. We show that overexpression of a YUC gene, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in auxin biosynthesis, causes massive proliferation of crown roots. On the other hand, we find that disruption of TAA1, which functions upstream of YUC genes, greatly reduces crown root development. We find that YUC overexpression-induced crown root proliferation requires the presence of the transcription factor WOX11. Moreover, the crown rootless phenotype of taa1 mutants was partially rescued by overexpression of WOX11. Furthermore, we show that WOX11 expression is induced in OsYUC1 overexpression lines, but is repressed in the taa1 mutants. Our results indicate that auxin synthesized by the TAA/YUC pathway is necessary and sufficient for crown root development in rice. Auxin activates WOX11 transcription, which subsequently drives crown root initiation and development, establishing the YUC-Auxin-WOX11 module for crown root development in rice.
NA	A Non-canonical MITE in WOX11 Promoter is Associated With Robust Crown Root in Rice.	2022	Plant Cell Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	The formation of tissues and organs in multicellular organisms are tightly controlled by transcriptional programs determined by temporal and spatial patterns of gene expression. As an important regulator of rice crown root development, WOX11 is essential for crown root formation and its transcript level is positively correlated with crown roots biomass. However, how WOX11 is regulated during crown root primordium emergence and outgrowth still remains unknown. In this study, variations of WOX11 genomic sequence were analyzed, and the highest genetic diversity was found within its promoter, which contained a non-canonical miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (ncMITE) sequence. Analysis of WOX11 promoter driven reporter gene GUS (β-glucuronidase) transgenic plants pWOX11(ncMITE+):GUS and pWOX11(ncMITE-):GUS uncovered higher GUS expression level in crown roots of pWOX11(ncMITE+):GUS plants. Furthermore, pWOX11(ncMITE+):WOX11-FLAG in wox11 background could complement crown root number and length compared to those of wild type (WT), while pWOX11(ncMITE-):WOX11-FLAG could not. These results suggested that the ncMITE was positively associated WOX11 transcripts in rice crown roots. In addition, DNA methylation nearby ncMITE region attenuated the activation effect of the ncMITE on WOX11 expression, which might be also the cause conferred to the root-specific expression of WOX11. This work provides novel insight into WOX11 expression regulation and reveals a promising target for genetic improvement of root architecture in rice.
NA	ROS-stimulated protein lysine acetylation is required for crown root development in rice.	2022	J Adv Res	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Hubei Hongshan Laboratory, Huazhong Agricultural University, 430070 Wuhan, China.	INTRODUCTION: As signal molecules in aerobic organisms, locally accumulated ROS have been reported to balance cell division and differentiation in the root meristem. Protein posttranslational modifications such as lysine acetylation play critical roles in controlling a variety of cellular processes. However, the mechanism by which ROS regulate root development is unknown. In addition, how protein lysine acetylation is regulated and whether cellular ROS levels affect protein lysine acetylation remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to elucidate the relationship between ROS and protein acetylation by exploring a rice mutant plant that displays a decreased level of ROS in postembryonic crown root (CR) cells and severe defects in CR development. METHODS: First, proteomic analysis was used to find candidate proteins responsible for the decrease of ROS detected in the wox11 mutant. Then, biochemical, molecular, and genetic analyses were used to study WOX11-regulated genes involved in ROS homeostasis. Finally, acetylproteomic analysis of wild type and wox11 roots treated with or without potassium iodide (KI) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) was used to study the effects of ROS on protein acetylation in rice CR cells. RESULTS: We demonstrated that WOX11 was required to maintain ROS homeostasis by upregulating peroxidase genes in the crown root meristem. Acetylproteomic analysis revealed that WOX11-dependent hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) levels in CR cells promoted lysine acetylation of many non-histone proteins enriched for nitrogen metabolism and peptide/protein synthesis pathways. Further analysis revealed that the redox state affected histone deacetylases (HDACs) activity, which was likely related to the high levels of protein lysine acetylation in CR cells. CONCLUSION: WOX11-controlled ROS level in CR meristem cells is required for protein lysine acetylation which represents a mechanism of ROS-promoted CR development in rice.
NA	WOX11 and CRL1 act synergistically to promote crown root development by maintaining cytokinin homeostasis in rice.	2022	New Phytol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Hubei Hongshan Laboratory, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Crown root morphogenesis is critical for normal growth and nutrition absorption in cereals. In rice, WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX11 (WOX11) and CROWN ROOTLESS1 (CRL1) play vital roles in controlling crown root development. Despite their importance, it remains unclear whether and how the two regulators coordinate crown root formation. Eletrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), transient expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) suggested that WOX11 and CRL1 directly bind to OsCKX4 to regulate its expression during crown root development. CRL1 enhances OsCKX4 activation through direct interaction with WOX11 at root emergence and elongation stages. Genetic dissection showed that wox11/crl1 double mutant exhibits a more severe root phenotype. OsCKX4 knock-out plants generated by CRISPR/Cas9 exhibited fewer crown roots number and higher cytokinin levels in root meristem. Increased expression of OsCKX4 could partially complement the crown root phenotypes of both crl1 and wox11 mutants. Furthermore, cytokinin can promote WOX11 protein accumulation in root meristem. Together, these findings show that cytokinin accumulation is tightly regulated by the WOX11-CRL1 complex during crown root elongation by counter-acting on the negative regulatory effects of cytokinin on root development. Importantly, these results reveal an intrinsic link between WOX11 protein accumulation and cytokinin to maintain crown root growth.
