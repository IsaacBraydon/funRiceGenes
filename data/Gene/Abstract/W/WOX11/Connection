OsMADS15|DEP	WOX11	Overexpression of a Transcription Factor OsMADS15 Modifies Plant Architecture and Flowering Time in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results showed that expression levels of WUSCHEL-related Homeobox (WOX) gene, WOX11, and some flowering regulators were promoted in the OsMADS15 overexpression transgenic plants, indicating that OsMADS15 had a wide range of regulations
OsHAK16	WOX11	Improving rice tolerance to potassium deficiency by enhancing OsHAK16p:WOX11-controlled root development.	 Here, we report that ectopic expression of WOX11 gene driven by the promoter of OsHAK16 encoding a low-K-enhanced K transporter led to an extensive root system and adventitious roots and more effective tiller numbers in rice
OsSUT1	WOX11	Improving rice tolerance to potassium deficiency by enhancing OsHAK16p:WOX11-controlled root development	The improvement of sugar partitioning to the roots by the expression of OsHAK16p:WOX11 was further indicated by increasing the expression of OsSUT1 and OsSUT4 genes in leaf blades and several OsMSTs genes in roots.
OsSUT4	WOX11	Improving rice tolerance to potassium deficiency by enhancing OsHAK16p:WOX11-controlled root development	The improvement of sugar partitioning to the roots by the expression of OsHAK16p:WOX11 was further indicated by increasing the expression of OsSUT1 and OsSUT4 genes in leaf blades and several OsMSTs genes in roots.
