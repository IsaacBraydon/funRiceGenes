Symbol	Expression
WFSL1	 WFSL1 was targeted to the chloroplasts and had higher expression in mature leaves and sheaths
WFSL1|STRIPE3|WSL214	 Based on the mapping cloning, we discovered that WSL214 had a single base mutation (C to T) in the third exon, resulting in decreased expression of wsl214 |  First, WSL214 increased the expression of the catalase gene OsCATC, making the intracellular ROS scavenging enzyme more active
