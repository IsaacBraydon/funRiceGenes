NA	Single-point Mutation of an Histidine-aspartic Domain-containing Gene involving in Chloroplast Ribosome Biogenesis Leads to White Fine Stripe Leaf in Rice.	2017	Sci Rep	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, China.	Plant leaves are a crucial organ associated closely with chloroplast development, photosynthesis rate and crop productivity. In this study, a white fine stripe leaf 1 (wfsl1) mutant was isolated and characterized from the japonica rice Zhonghua11 (ZH11) after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis. The wfsl1 displayed white fine stripe leaves since tillering stage and abnormal chloroplast structure. Map-based cloning and Bioinformatic analysis indicated that WFSL1 on chromosome 1 contains an &quot;A&quot; to &quot;T&quot; substitution in protein coding region, and encodes a putative metal-dependent phosphohydrolase with HD domain at the N-terminus. WFSL1 was targeted to the chloroplasts and had higher expression in mature leaves and sheaths. RNA-seq analysis revealed that chloroplast development and photosynthesis genes were significantly affected in wfsl1 plants. Levels of WFSL1 and chloroplast encoded proteins were decreased in wfsl1 mutants via western blot analysis. Compared with WT, wfsl1 exhibits lower Chl content and defective in biogenesis of chloroplast ribosomes, which resulted in reduced grain yield. Taken together, our results show that WFSL1 is critical for chloroplast development, ribosome biogenesis, and light energy utilization, finally affects grain yield.
NA	STRIPE3, encoding a human dNTPase SAMHD1 homolog, regulates chloroplast development in rice.	2022	Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Key Laboratory for Zhejiang Super Rice Research, China National Center for Rice Improvement, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 311401 China.	Chloroplast is an important organelle for photosynthesis and numerous essential metabolic processes, thus ensuring plant fitness or survival. Although many genes involved in chloroplast development have been identified, mechanisms underlying such development are not fully understood. Here, we isolated and characterized the stripe3 (st3) mutant which exhibited white-striped leaves with reduced chlorophyll content and abnormal chloroplast development during the seedling stage, but gradually produced nearly normal green leaves as it developed. Map-based cloning and transgenic tests demonstrated that a splicing mutation in ST3, encoding a human deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase (dNTPase) SAMHD1 homolog, was responsible for st3 phenotypes. ST3 is highly expressed in the third leaf at three-leaf stage and expressed constitutively in root, stem, leaf, sheath, and panicle, and the encoded protein, OsSAMHD1, is localized to the cytoplasm. The st3 mutant showed more severe albino leaf phenotype under exogenous 1-mM dATP/dA, dCTP/dC, and dGTP/dG treatments compared with the control conditions, indicating that ST3 is involved in dNTP metabolism. This study reveals a gene associated with dNTP catabolism, and propose a model in which chloroplast development in rice is regulated by the dNTP pool, providing a potential application of these results to hybrid rice breeding.
