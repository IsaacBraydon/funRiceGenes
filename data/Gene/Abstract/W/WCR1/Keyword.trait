WCR1	cell death	Natural variation in WHITE-CORE RATE 1 regulates redox homeostasis in rice endosperm to affect grain quality.	 WCR1 positively affects the transcription of the metallothionein gene MT2b and interacts with MT2b to inhibit its 26S proteasome-mediated degradation, leading to decreased reactive oxygen species production and delayed programmed cell death in rice endosperm
