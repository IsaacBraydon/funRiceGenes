NA	Natural variation in WHITE-CORE RATE 1 regulates redox homeostasis in rice endosperm to affect grain quality.	2021	Plant Cell	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and Hubei Hongshan Laboratory, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, Hubei 430070, China.	Grain chalkiness reduces the quality of rice (Oryza sativa) and is a highly undesirable trait for breeding and marketing. However, the underlying molecular cause of chalkiness remains largely unknown. Here, we cloned the F-box gene WHITE-CORE RATE 1 (WCR1), which negatively regulates grain chalkiness and improves grain quality in rice. A functional A/G variation in the promoter region of WCR1 generates the alleles WCR1A and WCR1G, which originated from tropical japonica and wild rice Oryza ruÔ¨Åpogon, respectively. OsDOF17 is a transcriptional activator that binds to the AAAAG cis-element in the WCR1A promoter. WCR1 positively affects the transcription of the metallothionein gene MT2b and interacts with MT2b to inhibit its 26S proteasome-mediated degradation, leading to decreased reactive oxygen species production and delayed programmed cell death in rice endosperm. This, in turn, leads to reduced chalkiness. Our findings uncover a molecular mechanism underlying rice chalkiness and identify the promising natural variant WCR1A, with application potential for rice breeding.
