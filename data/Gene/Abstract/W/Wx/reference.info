1-s2.0-S0733521007000380-main.pdf	Potential of Waxy gene microsatellite and single-nucleotide polymorphisms to develop japonica varieties with desired amylose levels in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2007	Journal of Cereal Science	Laboratory of Plant Genetic Engineering, Instituto de Tecnologia QuÃ­mica e BiolÃ³gica (ITQB)/Instituto de Biologia Experimental e TecnolÃ³gica (IBET), Quinta do MarquÃªs, 2784-505 Oeiras, Portugal	The Waxy (Wx) gene is responsible for the synthesis of amylose, a key determinant of the cooking and processing qualities of rice. Polymorphisms of CT-microsatellite and Gâ€“T single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Wx gene and their relationship to amylose content (Ac) were explored using 178 non-waxy rice genotypes. Nine Wx microsatellite alleles, namely (CT)10 and 11, and (CT)14â€<U+393C><U+3E33>20 were identified and 11 haplotypes were recognised by different combinations of CT-microsatellite and Gâ€“T SNP. Amylose content analysed in a random set of 39 genotypes was correlated with different microsatellite alleles/haplotypes. The highest Ac levels (>30%) correlated with (CT)10 and 16, high (26â€<U+393C><U+3E33>30%) with (CT)11, 15 and 20, and intermediate (21â€<U+393C><U+3E33>25%) with (CT)14, in all cases with G at the Gâ€“T SNP. The CT-classes (CT)17 and 18 (mean Ac value of 21%), could be subdivided into low amylose haplotypes (16â€<U+393C><U+3E33>20%) for 17T and 18T and intermediate amylose haplotypes (21â€<U+393C><U+3E33>25%) for 17G and 18G. The use of haplotypes proved to discriminate between intermediate and low amylose accessions within the same microsatellite class. Analyses of a segregating population of a cross between low and high Ac parents showed that CT-microsatellite may help to classify breeding lines and identify pollen contamination. We suggest that CT-microsatellite together with Gâ€“T SNP may be used as molecular marker by breeders to develop varieties with desired amylose levels.
10.1007-BF00028534.pdf	Genetic studies of speciation in cultivated rice. 5. Inter- and intraspecific differentiation in the waxy gene expression of rice	1986	Euphytica	National Institute of Genetics, 411, Misima, Japan	To get an insight in the gene regulation at the waxy locus of rice, the Wx gene product (Wx protein) controlling the synthesis of amylose was examined by electrophoretic techniques. Among nonwaxy rice strains, two different alleles, Wx a and Wx b, were found at the waxy locus. Wx a drastically enhanced the quantitative level of Wx protein as well as the amylose content in endosperm starch as compared with Wx b. The alleles acted additively in triploid endosperms. This implies that regulatory elements responsible for the Wx gene expression are on the same chromosome. The distribution patterns of Wx a and Wx b in five species of Oryza revealed that the regulatory changes are closely related to racial differentiation within a common rice species (O. sativa), suggesting that Wx b might have been selected for through the difference in grain quality during domestication.
10.1007-BF00254822.pdf	Differential regulation of waxy gene expression in rice endosperm	1984	Theor Appl Genet	National Institute of Genetics, 411, Misima, Japan.	In order to examine the effects of different alleles on the gene expression at the waxy locus, the Wx gene product which controls the synthesis of amylose was isolated from endosperm starch of rice plants and analysed by electrophoretic techniques. The major protein bound to starch granules was absent in most of waxy strains and increased with the number of Wx alleles in triploid endosperms, suggesting that the major protein is the Wx gene product. In addition to wx alleles which result in the absence or drastic reduction of the Wx gene product and amylose, differentiation of Wx alleles seemed to have occurred among nonwaxy rice strains. At least two Wx alleles with different efficiencies in the production of the major protein as well as amylose were detected. These alleles are discussed in relation to regulation of the gene expression.
10.1007-s00122-011-1632-6.pdf	Map-based cloning proves qGC-6, a major QTL for gel consistency of japonica/indica cross, responds by Waxy in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2011	Theor Appl Genet	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, 31006, Hangzhou, China.	In this study, one major QTL affecting gel consistency (GC) of japonica/indica cross was identified on chromosome 6 using a DH population. To understand the molecular mechanism that regulates GC in rice grains, the major QTL (qGC-6) was isolated through a map-based cloning approach utilizing chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs). Using 64 plants with extremely soft GC that were selected on recombinant break points between two SSR markers, RM540 and RM8200 in a BC4F2 population, qGC-6 was mapped to a 60-kb DNA region between two STS markers, S26 and S27. These two markers were then used to further identify recombination break points. Finally, qGC-6 was delimited in an interval of a 11-kb region. Gene prediction analysis of the 11-kb DNA sequence containing qGC-6 identified only one putative ORF, which encodes granule-bound starch synthesis protein (Wx protein). Results of sequencing analysis and complementation experiment confirmed that this candidate ORF is responsible for rice GC. Genetic evidences revealed that Wx might contribute equally to the grain amylose content-controlling gene as well as gel consistency. This new information is important to breed rice varieties with improved grain quality.
10.1023-A-1003457209225.pdf	Altered tissue-specific expression at the Wx gene of the opaque mutants in rice	1999	Euphytica	Laboratory of Plant Breeding, Faculty of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-8589, Japan	Amylose content is a major determinant of the eating quality in rice. To elucidate the allelic diversity at the Waxy (Wx) gene which controls the amylose synthesis, two cultivated strains having opaque endosperms were studied. The gene responsible for opaque endosperms was introduced into the genetic background of the Japonica type of rice by successive backcrosses, and the two near-isogenic lines (NILs) were selected from the B5 generation. The genetic experiments revealed that an allele, Wxop, controls opaque endosperms which show chalky as wx endosperms in spite of the production of amylose. Immunoblotting analysis was carried out to compare the gene expression by using the NILs with 4 different alleles (Wxa, Wxb, Wxop and wx). The level of the gene product bound to starch granules was slightly lower in the NILs with Wxop than that with Wxb, showing a positive correlation with amylose content in the endosperm. Extracts from mature anthers indicated that the gene product was markedly reduced in the NILs with Wxop as well as that with wx, showing an altered expression in the tissue specificity in the Wxop lines. Sequence analysis suggested that the Wxop had been derived from Wxa, independently of the origin of Wxb. The importance of the gene regulation was discussed in relation to diversified phenotypes established during the domestication process.
1471-2229-12-230.pdf	Molecular insights into how a deficiency of amylose affects carbon allocation--carbohydrate and oil analyses and gene expression profiling in the seeds of a rice waxy mutant	2012	BMC Plant Biol	College of Life Science, China JiLiang University, Hangzhou 310018, China.	BACKGROUND: Understanding carbon partitioning in cereal seeds is of critical importance to develop cereal crops with enhanced starch yields for food security and for producing specified end-products high in amylose, beta-glucan, or fructan, such as functional foods or oils for biofuel applications. Waxy mutants of cereals have a high content of amylopectin and have been well characterized. However, the allocation of carbon to other components, such as beta-glucan and oils, and the regulation of the altered carbon distribution to amylopectin in a waxy mutant are poorly understood. In this study, we used a rice mutant, GM077, with a low content of amylose to gain molecular insight into how a deficiency of amylose affects carbon allocation to other end products and to amylopectin. We used carbohydrate analysis, subtractive cDNA libraries, and qPCR to identify candidate genes potentially responsible for the changes in carbon allocation in GM077 seeds. RESULTS: Carbohydrate analysis indicated that the content of amylose in GM077 seeds was significantly reduced, while that of amylopectin significantly rose as compared to the wild type BP034. The content of glucose, sucrose, total starch, cell-wall polysaccharides and oil were only slightly affected in the mutant as compared to the wild type. Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) experiments generated 116 unigenes in the mutant on the wild-type background. Among the 116 unigenes, three, AGP, ISA1 and SUSIBA2-like, were found to be directly involved in amylopectin synthesis, indicating their possible roles in redirecting carbon flux from amylose to amylopectin. A bioinformatics analysis of the putative SUSIBA2-like binding elements in the promoter regions of the upregulated genes indicated that the SUSIBA2-like transcription factor may be instrumental in promoting the carbon reallocation from amylose to amylopectin. CONCLUSION: Analyses of carbohydrate and oil fractions and gene expression profiling on a global scale in the rice waxy mutant GM077 revealed several candidate genes implicated in the carbon reallocation response to an amylose deficiency, including genes encoding AGPase and SUSIBA2-like. We believe that AGP and SUSIBA2 are two promising targets for classical breeding and/or transgenic plant improvement to control the carbon flux between starch and other components in cereal seeds.
21026929.pdf	Du1, encoding a novel Prp1 protein, regulates starch biosynthesis through affecting the splicing of Wxb pre-mRNAs in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2007	Plant Mol Biol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Starch is the major component of cereal grains. In rice, starch properties determine the eating and cooking quality. The dull endosperm of rice grains is a classical morphological and agronomical trait that has long been exploited for breeding and genetics study. To understand the molecular mechanism that regulates the starch biosynthesis in rice grains, we characterized a classic rice mutant dull endosperm1 (du1) and isolated Du1 through a map-based cloning approach. Du1, encoding a member of pre-mRNA processing (Prp1) family, is expressed mainly in panicles. Du1 specifically affects the splicing efficiency of Wx(b) and regulates starch biosynthesis by mediating the expression of starch biosynthesis genes. Analysis of du1wx shows that Du1 acts upstream of Wx(b). These results strongly suggest that Du1 may function as a regulator of the starch biosynthesis by affecting the splicing of Wx(b) and the expression of other genes involved in the rice starch biosynthetic pathways.
52_131.pdf	Molecular Characterization of Wx-mq, a Novel Mutant Gene for Low-amylose Content in Endosperm of Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2002	Breeding Science	National Institute of Crop Science	In this paper, we characterized the Wx-mq gene for low amylose content in a rice variety, Milky Queen, at the molecular level. The Wx-mq gene was cloned by RT-PCR, and a nearly full-length cDNA sequence of the gene was determined. Sequence comparison between the Wx-mq gene and the wild type allele (Wx-b), cloned from cv. Koshihikari, revealed that two base changes existed within the coding region; a G to A base change at nucleotide position 497 and a T to C base change at nucleotide position 595. Each nucleotide substitution should generate a missense base change (an Arg-158 to His-158 change in exon4, and a Tyr-191 to His-191 change in exon5). However, it is not known which missense mutation is essential for the activity of the WX protein. To identify rice varieties and lines, which harbored the Wx-mq gene, PCR primers were designed at the gene level. These primers were able to amplify the Wx-mq specific 741 bp band in Milky Queen, and in other rice variety and lines, Milky Princess, Joiku 436 and Etsunan 190, all of which have the same pedigree as that of Milky Queen. On the other hand, no 741 bp band was amplified with the primers in Koshihikari which harbored the wild type allele (Wx-b), and the other low-amylose content variety and line, Snow Pearl and NM391, which do not have the pedigree. Thus, it is possible to detect the Wx-mq gene by PCR.
E070203.pdf	Genetic Polymorphism of Wx Gene and Its Correlation with Main Grain Quality Characteristics in Rice	2007	Rice Science	Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Wenjiang 611130, China	The allelic variation of the Wx gene in 50 non-glutinous rice varieties (lines) was analyzed by using the microsatellite marker RM190 [for (CT)n simple sequence repeat (SSR)] and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence(CAPS) marker 484/W2R-ACC?[for G/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)]. Six homozygous (CT)n types, namely (CT)20, (CT)19, (CT)18, (CT)17, (CT)16, (CT)14, (CT)11 and (CT)10, and a heterozygous genotype (CT)11/(CT)18 were detected for RM190, of which (CT)11 and (CT)18 were predominant. Two homozygous Wx genotypes (G/G and T/T) and one heterozygous (G/T) were detected using 484/W2R-ACC?. Most of the materials with a RM190 of (CT)11 were G/G for SNP of 484/W2R-ACC I, while T/T for SNP was predominantly appeared in materials with (CT)18. The materials tested could be grouped into 10 categories using the two markers together. Results indicated that 59.3% variance of amylose content was attributed to the polymorphism of Wx gene revealed by RM190, while 56.1% and 24.6% of the variances in amylose content and gel consistency were respectively to the polymorphism of Wx gene revealed by 484/W2R-ACC I. Furthermore, with both SSR and CAPS markers, 72.4% of the variance in amylose content could be explained. In addition, the application prospects of the two markers in breeding were also discussed.
ert187.pdf	OsbZIP58, a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, regulates starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm	2013	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, PR China.	Starch composition and the amount in endosperm, both of which contribute dramatically to seed yield, cooking quality, and taste in cereals, are determined by a series of complex biochemical reactions. However, the mechanism regulating starch biosynthesis in cereal seeds is not well understood. This study showed that OsbZIP58, a bZIP transcription factor, is a key transcriptional regulator controlling starch synthesis in rice endosperm. OsbZIP58 was expressed mainly in endosperm during active starch synthesis. osbzip58 null mutants displayed abnormal seed morphology with altered starch accumulation in the white belly region and decreased amounts of total starch and amylose. Moreover, osbzip58 had a higher proportion of short chains and a lower proportion of intermediate chains of amylopectin. Furthermore, OsbZIP58 was shown to bind directly to the promoters of six starch-synthesizing genes, OsAGPL3, Wx, OsSSIIa, SBE1, OsBEIIb, and ISA2, and to regulate their expression. These findings indicate that OsbZIP58 functions as a key regulator of starch synthesis in rice seeds and provide new insights into seed quality control.
j.1365-313X.1998.00189.x.pdf	A naturally occurring functional allele of the rice waxy locus has a GT to TT mutation at the 5' splice site of the first intron	1998	The Plant Journal	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Takayama, Japan.	In cultivated rice two wild-type alleles, Wxa and Wxb, predominate at the waxy locus, which encodes granule-bound starch synthase. The activity of Wxa is 10-fold higher than that of Wxb at the level of both protein and mRNA. Wxb has a +1G to T mutation at the 5' splice site of the first intron. Sequence analysis of Wxb transcripts revealed that splicing occurs at the mutant AG/UU site and at two cryptic sites: the first is A/GUU, one base upstream of the original site and the second is AG/GU found approximately 100 bases upstream of the mutant splice site. We introduced single base mutations to the 5' splice sites of both Wxa and Wxb, fused with the gus reporter gene and introduced them into rice protoplasts. Analysis of GUS activities and transcripts indicated that a G to T mutation in Wxa reduced GUS activity and the level of spliced RNA. Conversely, a T to G mutation of Wxb restored GUS activity and the level of spliced RNA to that of wild-type Wxa. These results demonstrated that the low level expression of Wxb results from a single base mutation at the 5' splice site of the first intron. It is of interest that the Wxb allele of rice carrying the G to T mutation of intron 1 has been conserved in the history of rice cultivation because there is a low amylose content of the seed caused by this mutation.
Mol Biol Evol-1998-Hirano-978-87.pdf	A single base change altered the regulation of the Waxy gene at the posttranscriptional level during the domestication of rice	1998	Mol Biol Evol	National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan. ahirano@hongo.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp	The rice waxy (wx) locus has two functional alleles, Wxa and Wxb, which are defined by a large difference in the amount of the gene product, called Wx protein, that accumulates in mature seeds. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying this difference and to identify the base change causing the alteration of the regulation of the Wx gene during rice evolution, we determined the nucleotide sequences of the regulatory region of Wx alleles and analyzed their function in a transient assay system using rice protoplasts. All Wxa alleles from Oryza sativa Indica, O. rufipogon, and O. glaberrima have a normal sequence of GT at the 5' splice junction of the first intron, representing a high expression level of the Wx transcripts in the endosperm and a high beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity in protoplasts. On the other hand, Wxb alleles from two strains of O. sativa Japonica have TT at the 5' splice junction, representing a low expression level of the mature transcripts and a low GUS activity. Northern blot analysis also indicated that a larger transcript, consisting of the unspliced first intron, is closely correlated with the function of the Wxb allele. These results suggest that a single base change at the 5' splice junction causes inefficient splicing and, as a result, reduces the level of mature transcript and the GUS activity in the Wxb allele. The Wxb allele in O. saativa Japonica may have been differentiated from the Wxa allele of O. rufipogon, its wild progenitor, by this mutation, and, therefore, a single base change that has altered the regulation of the Wx gene at the posttranscriptional level probably occurred during the domestication of rice.
Plant Cell Physiol-2008-Hanashiro-925-33.pdf	Granule-bound starch synthase I is responsible for biosynthesis of extra-long unit chains of amylopectin in rice	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	Faculty of Agriculture, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima 890-0065 Japan.	A rice Wx gene encoding a granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) was introduced into the null-mutant waxy (wx) rice, and its effect on endosperm starches was examined. The apparent amylose content was increased from undetectable amounts for the non-transgenic wx cultivars to 21.6-22.2% of starch weight for the transgenic lines. The increase was in part due to a significant amount of extra-long unit chains (ELCs) of amylopectin (7.5-8.4% of amylopectin weight), that were absent in the non-transgenic wx cultivars. Thus, actual amylose content was calculated to be 14.9-16.0% for the transgenic lines. Only slight differences were found in chain-length distribution for the chains other than ELCs, indicating that the major effect of the Wx transgene on amylopectin structure was ELC formation. ELCs isolated from debranched amylopectin exhibited structures distinct from amylose. Structures of amylose from the transgenic lines were slightly different from those of cv. Labelle (Wx(a)) in terms of a higher degree of branching and size distribution. The amylose and ELC content of starches of the transgenic lines resulted in the elevation of pasting temperature, a 50% decrease in peak viscosity, a large decrease in breakdown and an increase in setback. As yet undetermined factors other than the GBSSI activity are thought to be involved in the control of formation and/or the amount of ELCs. Structural analysis of the Wx gene suggested that the presence of a tyrosine residue at position 224 of GBSSI correlates with the formation of large amounts of ELCs in cultivars carrying Wx(a).
PNAS-2009-Tian-21760-5.pdf	Allelic diversities in rice starch biosynthesis lead to a diverse array of rice eating and cooking qualities	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	More than half of the world's population uses rice as a source of carbon intake every day. Improving grain quality is thus essential to rice consumers. The three main properties that determine rice eating and cooking quality--amylose content, gel consistency, and gelatinization temperature--correlate with one another, but the underlying mechanism of these properties remains unclear. Through an association analysis approach, we found that genes related to starch synthesis cooperate with each other to form a fine regulating network that controls the eating and cooking quality and defines the correlation among these three properties. Genetic transformation results verified the association findings and also suggested the possibility of developing elite cultivars through modification with selected major and/or minor starch synthesis-related genes.
Yamanaka2.pdf	Identification of SNPs in the waxy gene among glutinous rice cultivars and their evolutionary significance during the domestication process of rice	2004	Theor Appl Genet	Gene Research Center, Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tennodai 1-1-1, 305-8572 Tsukuba, Japan.	Common non-waxy ( Wx) rice cultivars contain two different alleles at the waxy locus, designated Wx(a) and Wx(b), which encode different levels of granule-bound starch synthases and are hence involved in the control of endosperm amylose content. The Wx(a) allele was predominant in non-waxy indica cultivars, whereas the Wx(b) allele was common to the non-waxy japonica variety. Recently, some of the molecular mechanisms underlying the differentiation of Wx(a) from Wx(b) have been characterized. One structural difference between these two alleles was shown to be due to alternative splicing caused by a single-base substitution (AG GT to AG TT) at a donor site of the first intron within the Wx gene. In the case of waxy ( wx) rice, it was not possible to distinguish whether the each wx allele was derived from Wx(a) or Wx(b) alleles by phenotypic analysis. However, we succeeded in developing a derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) marker for the detection of the one-base splicing mutation without the need for sequencing. A mismatch primer was used to generate a restriction site in the Wx(a) allele (AGGT) but not in the Wx(b) allele (AGTT). Three hundred fifty-three waxy rice strains that are widely found in Asia were then employed for analysis using this dCAPS marker. Our findings suggested that waxy rice strains have both Wx(a)- and Wx(b)-derived alleles, but that the Wx(b)-derived allele was predominant, and its distribution was independent of indica- japonica differentiation. The wild relatives of cultivated rice all possessed the AGGT allele. It was concluded that the waxy mutations, and the corresponding rice cultivation, originated from japonica during the evolution and domestication process of rice and was preferentially selected by most Asian peoples.

DNA polymorphism of the Wx gene in glutinous rice cultivars was investigated by PCR-RF-SSCP and heteroduplex cleavage analysis using Brassica petiole extract, and the nucleotide sequence variations were identified. Most japonica-type glutinous rice was found to have a 23-bp duplication in the second exon, which causes loss of the function of granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) encoded by the Wx gene. Without the 23-bp duplication, there was an insertion of 7,764 bp in the ninth exon of the wx allele of 'Oragamochi'. Expression analysis of the wx allele using RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis revealed that transcripts of the 'Oragamochi' wx allele are about 1-kb shorter and that the deduced amino acid sequence of the transcript lacks a motif important for GBSS. Therefore, this insertion was considered to be the cause of the glutinous trait of 'Oragamochi'. This 7,764-bp insertion had long terminal repeats, a primer binding site, and a polypurine tract, but no sequence homologous with gag and pol, suggesting that it is a non-autonomous element. Furthermore, it had a structure similar to Dasheng and may be a member of Dasheng.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs00122-011-1604-x.pdf	A single nucleotide polymorphism in the Waxy gene explains a significant component of gel consistency	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Grain Quality and Nutrition Centre, International Rice Research Institute, DAPO 7777, Manila, Metro Manila, Philippines.	Gel consistency (GC) is a standard assay used in rice improvement programmes to determine whether rice cultivars/breeding lines of high amylose content are soft or firm textured when cooked. In this study, we show that sequence variation in exon 10 of the Waxy (Wx) gene associates with GC using RILs derived from parents with high amylose content that differ in GC. The association was validated using a diverse set of traditional varieties, selected on the basis of amylose content, from the generation challenge programme. Structural investigations to explain how the mutation leads to differences in GC showed a strong association between GC and the proportion of amylose that leaches. It was shown that cooked rices of hard GC do not change in hardness over 24 h, whereas rices of soft GC retrograde significantly over 24 h. This leads to the conclusion that the mutation on exon 10 of the Wx gene affects the proportion of amylose bound to amylopectin and the proportion able to leach, and these structural differences alter the composition of the gel, which affects the amount of time the gel takes to reach a final hardness. The SNP described here completes the set of markers required to genotype for the current traits of cooking quality, but selecting the allele for soft texture has the negative result of also selecting for retrogradation potential.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs11103-009-9544-4.pdf	Identification and characterization of a novel Waxy allele from a Yunnan rice landrace	2009	Plant Mol Biol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics & Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Provincial Center of Plant Gene Engineering, Nanjing Agricultural University, Weigang 1, 210095 Nanjing, China.	Low amylose content (AC) is a desirable trait for rice (Oryza sativa L.) cooking quality and is selected in soft rice breeding. To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism controlling AC formation, we screened 83 Yunnan rice landraces in China and identified a rice variety, Haopi, with low AC. Genetic analyses and transgenic experiments revealed that low AC in Haopi was controlled by a novel allele of the Wx locus, Wx(hp), encoding a granule-bound starch synthase (GBSSI). Sequence comparisons of Wx(hp) and Wx(b) alleles (from Nipponbare) showed several nucleotide changes in the upstream regulatory regions (including the promoter, 5'-untranslated region, and first intron 5' splicing junction site). Interestingly, these changes had no obvious effect on the expression level and splicing efficiency of Wx transcripts. In addition, an examination of the coding region revealed that the Wx(hp) allele carries an A-to-G change at nucleotide position +497 from the start codon, resulting in an Asp(165)/Gly(165) substitution. The amino acid substitution had no detectable effects on GBSSI activity in vitro; however, it notably reduced the binding of GBSSI to starch granules, resulting in a reduction of AC in rice seeds. Moreover, three other Yunnan landraces with low AC also carry a nucleotide substitution identical to Haopi at the +497 position of the Wx gene, suggesting common ancestry. Based on the single-nucleotide polymorphism, we have developed a new derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker for use in breeding practice to manipulate AC in rice endosperm.
NA	Effects of Wx and Its Interaction With SSIII-2 on Rice Eating and Cooking Qualities.	2018	Front Plant Sci	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics and Breeding, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang, China.	The Wx gene encodes a granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) and plays a key role in determining rice eating and cooking qualities (ECQs). SSIII-2 (SSIIIa), a member of the soluble starch synthases, is responsible for the synthesis of long chains of amylopectin. To investigate the effects of Wx and its interaction with SSIII-2 on grain ECQs, a population from a hybrid combination was established as a research material. The genotypes of SSIII-2 and the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on intron1, exon6, and exon10 of Wx, and the physicochemical indicators and rapid visco analyzer (RVA) profile characteristics were analyzed. The results revealed various effects of SSIII-2 on rice quality under different backgrounds of Wx alleles. There was no obvious difference between different SSIII-2 alleles under the same background of Wxa , whereas there was a significant diversity under the same background of Wxb . Wxa had a dominant epistasis to SSIII-2 because the effect of SSIII-2 was masked by the massive synthesis of GBSS under Wxa . The apparent amylose content (AAC) was mainly controlled by the In1G/T SNP, and rice gel consistency (GC) was regulated by the Ex10C/T SNP. The combined effects of three SNPs had a significant influence on all ECQs and RVA profile parameters, except for gelatinization temperature. In1T-Ex6A-Ex10C and In1T-Ex6A-Ex10T were classified as being low AAC type. TT-AA-CC and TT-AA-TT had a low AAC and a soft GC. The combined effects of different SNPs of Wx are very important for rice quality breeding.
NA	CRISPR/Cas9 mutations in the rice Waxy/GBSSI gene induce allele-specific and zygosity-dependent feedback effects on endosperm starch biosynthesis.	2019	Plant Cell Rep	Department of Plant Production and Forestry Science, School of Agrifood and Forestry Science and Engineering (ETSEA), University of Lleida-Agrotecnio Center, Av. Alcalde Rovira Roure 191, 25198, Lleida, Spain.	Induced mutations in the waxy locus in rice endosperm did not abolish GBSS activity completely. Compensatory mechanisms in endosperm and leaves caused a major reprogramming of the starch biosynthetic machinery. The mutation of genes in the starch biosynthesis pathway has a profound effect on starch quality and quantity and is an important target for plant breeders. Mutations in endosperm starch biosynthetic genes may impact starch metabolism in vegetative tissues such as leaves in unexpected ways due to the complex feedback mechanisms regulating the pathway. Surprisingly this aspect of global starch metabolism has received little attention. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce mutations affecting the Waxy (Wx) locus encoding granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) in rice endosperm. Our specific objective was to develop a mechanistic understanding of how the endogenous starch biosynthetic machinery might be affected at the transcriptional level following the targeted knock out of GBSSI in the endosperm. We found that the mutations reduced but did not abolish GBSS activity in seeds due to partial compensation caused by the upregulation of GBSSII. The GBSS activity in the mutants was 61-71% of wild-type levels, similarly to two irradiation mutants, but the amylose content declined to 8-12% in heterozygous seeds and to as low as 5% in homozygous seeds, accompanied by abnormal cellular organization in the aleurone layer and amorphous starch grain structures. Expression of many other starch biosynthetic genes was modulated in seeds and leaves. This modulation of gene expression resulted in changes in AGPase and sucrose synthase activity that explained the corresponding levels of starch and soluble sugars.
NA	Wxlv, the ancestral allele of rice Waxy gene.	2019	Mol Plant	Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics of the Ministry of Education / Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genomics and Molecular Breeding, College of Agriculture, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, China; Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops of Jiangsu Province / Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology of Jiangsu Province, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, China.	In rice grains, the Waxy (Wx) gene is responsible for the synthesis of amylose, the most important determinant for eating and cooking quality. Up to now, several Wx alleles have been elucidated on their effects of amylose content as well as the taste of cooked rice. However, the relationships between artificial selection and the evolution as well as distribution of various Wx alleles remain unclear. Herein, we report the cloning of the ancestral allele Wxlv of the Wx locus, which dramatically affects the mouthfeel of rice grains by modulating the size of amylose molecules. We demonstrated that Wxlv originated directly from wild rice, and the three major Wx alleles in cultivated rice (Wxb, Wxa, and Wxin) differentiated after the substitution of one base pair at the functional sites. These data indicate that the Wxlv allele played an important role in artificial selection and domestication. The findings also shed light on the evolution of various Wx alleles, which have greatly contributed to improving the eating and cooking quality of rice.
