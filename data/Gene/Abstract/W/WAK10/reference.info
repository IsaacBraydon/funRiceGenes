NA	A receptor-like kinase controls the amplitude of secondary cell wall synthesis in rice.	2023	Curr Biol	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic and Developmental Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 20040, China; State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning 530004, China.	Cell wall expansion is a key element in determining plant morphology and growth, and cell wall integrity changes are relayed to the cell to fine-tune growth responses. Here, we show that variations in the ectodomain of a cell wall-associated receptor-like kinase, WAK10, in temperate Oryza japonica accessions differentially amplify fluctuations in cell wall integrity to control rice stem height. Mutation in the WAK10 gene exhibited increased cell wall thickening in stem sclerenchyma and reduced cell expansion in the stem. Two WAK10 ectodomain variants bound pectic oligosaccharides with different affinities. The pectic oligosaccharide binding regulated WAK10 phosphorylation activity, the amplitude of secondary wall deposition, and ultimately, stem height. Rice population analyses revealed active enrichment of the short-stem WAK10 ectodomain alleles in japonica subspecies during domestication. Our study outlines not only a mechanism for how variations in ligand affinities of a receptor kinase control cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth, but it also provides breeding targets for new semi-dwarf rice cultivars.
