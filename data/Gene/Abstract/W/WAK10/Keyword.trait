WAK10	stem	A receptor-like kinase controls the amplitude of secondary cell wall synthesis in rice.	 Mutation in the WAK10 gene exhibited increased cell wall thickening in stem sclerenchyma and reduced cell expansion in the stem
WAK10	stem	A receptor-like kinase controls the amplitude of secondary cell wall synthesis in rice.	 The pectic oligosaccharide binding regulated WAK10 phosphorylation activity, the amplitude of secondary wall deposition, and ultimately, stem height
WAK10	domestication	A receptor-like kinase controls the amplitude of secondary cell wall synthesis in rice.	 Rice population analyses revealed active enrichment of the short-stem WAK10 ectodomain alleles in japonica subspecies during domestication
WAK10	cell wall	A receptor-like kinase controls the amplitude of secondary cell wall synthesis in rice.	 Mutation in the WAK10 gene exhibited increased cell wall thickening in stem sclerenchyma and reduced cell expansion in the stem
WAK10	height	A receptor-like kinase controls the amplitude of secondary cell wall synthesis in rice.	 The pectic oligosaccharide binding regulated WAK10 phosphorylation activity, the amplitude of secondary wall deposition, and ultimately, stem height
WAK10	cell expansion	A receptor-like kinase controls the amplitude of secondary cell wall synthesis in rice.	 Mutation in the WAK10 gene exhibited increased cell wall thickening in stem sclerenchyma and reduced cell expansion in the stem
