WGL2	chloroplast	The rice white green leaf 2 gene causes defects in chloroplast development and affects the plastid ribosomal protein S9.	 WGL2 encodes a conserved ribosomal protein, which localizes to the chloroplast
WGL2	chloroplast	The rice white green leaf 2 gene causes defects in chloroplast development and affects the plastid ribosomal protein S9.	 WGL2 is preferentially expressed in the leaf, and mutating WGL2 led to obvious changes in the expression of genes related to chlorophyll biosynthesis, photosynthesis, chloroplast development, and ribosome development compared with wild-type
WGL2	chloroplast	The rice white green leaf 2 gene causes defects in chloroplast development and affects the plastid ribosomal protein S9.	WGL2 encodes a conserved ribosomal protein, which localizes to the chloroplast
WGL2	chloroplast	The rice white green leaf 2 gene causes defects in chloroplast development and affects the plastid ribosomal protein S9.	 WGL2 is essential for early chloroplast development in rice
WGL2	development	The rice white green leaf 2 gene causes defects in chloroplast development and affects the plastid ribosomal protein S9.	 WGL2 is preferentially expressed in the leaf, and mutating WGL2 led to obvious changes in the expression of genes related to chlorophyll biosynthesis, photosynthesis, chloroplast development, and ribosome development compared with wild-type
WGL2	development	The rice white green leaf 2 gene causes defects in chloroplast development and affects the plastid ribosomal protein S9.	 WGL2 is essential for early chloroplast development in rice
WGL2	map-based cloning	The rice white green leaf 2 gene causes defects in chloroplast development and affects the plastid ribosomal protein S9.	 Map-based cloning and DNA sequencing analyses of wgl2 revealed a single-nucleotide substitution (G to T) in the first exon of LOC_Os03g55930, which resulted in a substitution of glycine 92 to valine (G92<U+00A0>V)
WGL2	chloroplast development	The rice white green leaf 2 gene causes defects in chloroplast development and affects the plastid ribosomal protein S9.	 WGL2 is preferentially expressed in the leaf, and mutating WGL2 led to obvious changes in the expression of genes related to chlorophyll biosynthesis, photosynthesis, chloroplast development, and ribosome development compared with wild-type
WGL2	chloroplast development	The rice white green leaf 2 gene causes defects in chloroplast development and affects the plastid ribosomal protein S9.	 WGL2 is essential for early chloroplast development in rice
