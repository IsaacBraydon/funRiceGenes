FCP1|OsCLE402	OsWOX4	WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice	Consistent with similarities in the shoot apical meristem phenotypes caused by overexpression of FCP1 and downregulation of WOX4, expression of WOX4 was negatively regulated by FCP1 (FCP2)
FCP1|OsCLE402	OsWOX4	WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice	Thus, FCP1/2 and WOX4 are likely to be involved in maintenance of the vegetative meristem in rice
FCP2	OsWOX4	WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice	Consistent with similarities in the shoot apical meristem phenotypes caused by overexpression of FCP1 and downregulation of WOX4, expression of WOX4 was negatively regulated by FCP1 (FCP2)
OsAUX1	OsWOX4	The WUSCHEL-related homeobox transcription factor OsWOX4 controls the primary root elongation by activating OsAUX1 in rice	The WUSCHEL-related homeobox transcription factor OsWOX4 controls the primary root elongation by activating OsAUX1 in rice
OsAUX1	OsWOX4	The WUSCHEL-related homeobox transcription factor OsWOX4 controls the primary root elongation by activating OsAUX1 in rice	 Transient transcriptional activation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that OsWOX4 directly regulated the transcription of OsAUX1 through binding to its promoter region
