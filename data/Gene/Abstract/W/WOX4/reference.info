Plant Cell-2013-Ohmori-229-41.pdf	WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice	2013	Plant Cell	Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8654, Japan.	The shoot apical meristem is the ultimate source of the cells that constitute the entire aboveground portion of the plant body. In Arabidopsis thaliana, meristem maintenance is regulated by the negative feedback loop of WUSCHEL-CLAVATA (WUS-CLV). Although CLV-like genes, such as FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER1 (FON1) and FON2, have been shown to be involved in maintenance of the reproductive meristems in rice (Oryza sativa), current understanding of meristem maintenance remains insufficient. In this article, we demonstrate that the FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1) and FCP2 genes encoding proteins with similar CLE domains are involved in negative regulation of meristem maintenance in the vegetative phase. In addition, we found that WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 (WOX4) promotes the undifferentiated state of the meristem in rice and that WOX4 function is associated with cytokinin action. Consistent with similarities in the shoot apical meristem phenotypes caused by overexpression of FCP1 and downregulation of WOX4, expression of WOX4 was negatively regulated by FCP1 (FCP2). Thus, FCP1/2 and WOX4 are likely to be involved in maintenance of the vegetative meristem in rice.
NA	WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 acts as a key regulator in early leaf development in rice.	2018	PLoS Genet	Department of Biological Sciences, School of Science, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.	Rice (Oryza sativa) has long and narrow leaves with parallel veins, similar to other grasses. Relative to Arabidopsis thaliana which has oval-shaped leaves, our understanding of the mechanism of leaf development is insufficient in grasses. In this study, we show that OsWOX4, a member of the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX gene family, plays important roles in early leaf development in rice. Inducible downregulation of OsWOX4 resulted in severe defects in leaf development, such as an arrest of vascular differentiation, a partial defect in the early cell proliferation required for midrib formation, and a failure to maintain cellular activity in general parenchyma cells. In situ analysis showed that knockdown of OsWOX4 reduced the expression of two LONELY GUY genes, which function in the synthesis of active cytokinin, in developing vascular bundles. Consistent with this, cytokinin levels were downregulated by OsWOX4 knockdown. Transcriptome analysis further showed that OsWOX4 regulates multiple genes, including those responsible for cell cycle progression and hormone action, consistent with the effects of OsWOX4 downregulation on leaf phenotypes. Collectively, these results suggest that OsWOX4 acts as a key regulator at an early stage of leaf development. Our previous work revealed that OsWOX4 is involved in the maintenance of shoot apical meristem in rice, whereas AtWOX4 is specifically associated with the maintenance of vascular stem cells in Arabidopsis. Thus, the function of the two orthologous genes seems to be diversified between rice and Arabidopsis.
NA	The WUSCHEL-related homeobox transcription factor OsWOX4 controls the primary root elongation by activating OsAUX1 in rice	2020	Plant Science	Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Bioengineering College, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400030, PR China.	Primary root is the basic component of root system and plays a key role in early seedling growth and survival in rice. However, the molecular mechanism of primary root elongation still needs to be well understood. Here, we showed that OsWOX4, a WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) transcription factor, was involved in the primary root elongation in rice. Silencing of OsWOX4 by RNA interference (RNAi) greatly increased the primary root length, whereas its overexpression reduced primary root elongation significantly. Moreover, the size of meristem zone and epidermal cell length of mature zone in RNAi root tips were drastically enhanced, while they were reduced markedly in overexpression lines, in comparison with that of wild type. Further analysis showed that the accumulation of free IAA was slightly increased in RNAi roots, but drastically reduced in plants overexpressing OsWOX4. The expression of genes responsible for auxin biosynthesis and transport was also changed in OsWOX4 transgenic lines. Transient transcriptional activation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that OsWOX4 directly regulated the transcription of OsAUX1 through binding to its promoter region. Collectively, our results indicated that OsWOX4 played a crucial role in the primary root elongation by regulating auxin transport, suggesting its importance in rice root system architecture.
