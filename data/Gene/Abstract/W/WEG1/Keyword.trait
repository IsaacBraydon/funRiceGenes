WEG1	root	WEG1, which encodes a cell wall hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein, is essential for parental root elongation controlling lateral root formation in rice.	 Consistent with this phenotype, was the expression of the WEG1 gene, which encodes a putative member of the hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein family that regulates cell wall extensibility, in the root elongation zone
WEG1	root	WEG1, which encodes a cell wall hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein, is essential for parental root elongation controlling lateral root formation in rice.	 These results suggest that the MNU-induced weg1 mutated gene regulates the auxin-independent parental root elongation that controls the number of likely auxin-induced L-type LRs, thus reflecting its importance in improving rice root architecture
