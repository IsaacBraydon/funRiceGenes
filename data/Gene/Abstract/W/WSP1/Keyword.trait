WSP1	leaf	The RNA editing factor WSP1 is essential for chloroplast development in rice.	 The ribosome biogenesis defect and plastid-encoded RNA polymerase complex activity impairment in wsp1 potentially account for the stripe leaf in the seedling and white panicle in the heading stage
WSP1	panicle	The RNA editing factor WSP1 is essential for chloroplast development in rice.	 The ribosome biogenesis defect and plastid-encoded RNA polymerase complex activity impairment in wsp1 potentially account for the stripe leaf in the seedling and white panicle in the heading stage
WSP1	seedling	The RNA editing factor WSP1 is essential for chloroplast development in rice.	 The ribosome biogenesis defect and plastid-encoded RNA polymerase complex activity impairment in wsp1 potentially account for the stripe leaf in the seedling and white panicle in the heading stage
WSP1	chloroplast	The RNA editing factor WSP1 is essential for chloroplast development in rice.	The RNA editing factor WSP1 is essential for chloroplast development in rice.
WSP1	chloroplast	The RNA editing factor WSP1 is essential for chloroplast development in rice.	 Transmission electron microscopy and chlorophyll content measurements revealed a chloroplast developmental defect and a reduced and low rate of chlorophyll accumulation in wsp1
WSP1	chloroplast	The RNA editing factor WSP1 is essential for chloroplast development in rice.	 Owing to plastid RNA factor editing defect, chloroplast ribosome biogenesis and ndhA splicing were also impaired in wsp1
WSP1	chloroplast	The RNA editing factor WSP1 is essential for chloroplast development in rice.	 Together, this is the first study to demonstrate the importance of a rice WSP1 protein in chloroplast development and to broaden our knowledge about MORF family members (WSP1) in rice
