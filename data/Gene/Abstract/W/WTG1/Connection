OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	WTG1|OsOTUB1	Non-canonical regulation of SPL transcription factors by a human OTUB1-like deubiquitinase defines a new plant type rice associated with higher grain yield.	 OsOTUB1 interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating protein OsUBC13 and the squamosa promoter-binding protein-like transcription factor OsSPL14
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	WTG1|OsOTUB1	Non-canonical regulation of SPL transcription factors by a human OTUB1-like deubiquitinase defines a new plant type rice associated with higher grain yield.	 OsOTUB1 and OsSPL14 share common target genes, and their physical interaction limits K63-linked ubiquitination (K63Ub) of OsSPL14, which in turn promotes K48Ub-dependent proteasomal degradation of OsSPL14
OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	WTG1|OsOTUB1	Non-canonical regulation of SPL transcription factors by a human OTUB1-like deubiquitinase defines a new plant type rice associated with higher grain yield.	 Conversely, loss-of-function of OsOTUB1 is correlated with the accumulation of high levels of OsSPL14, resulting in the NPT architecture
OsUBC13	WTG1|OsOTUB1	Non-canonical regulation of SPL transcription factors by a human OTUB1-like deubiquitinase defines a new plant type rice associated with higher grain yield.	 OsOTUB1 interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating protein OsUBC13 and the squamosa promoter-binding protein-like transcription factor OsSPL14
