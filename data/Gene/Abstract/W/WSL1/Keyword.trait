WSL1	sheath	Wax Crystal-Sparse Leaf1 encodes a beta-ketoacyl CoA synthase involved in biosynthesis of cuticular waxes on rice leaf	 Qualitative and quantitative wax composition analyses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) demonstrated a marked reduction of total cuticular wax load on wsl1 leaf blades and sheaths, and VLCFA precursors of C20-C24 decreased in both
WSL1	growth	Wax Crystal-Sparse Leaf1 encodes a beta-ketoacyl CoA synthase involved in biosynthesis of cuticular waxes on rice leaf	 Moreover, ubiquitous expression of the WSL1 gene gave a hint that WSL1-catalyzed elongation of VLCFAs might participate in a wide range of rice growth and development processes beyond biosynthesis of cuticular waxes
WSL1	leaf	Wax Crystal-Sparse Leaf1 encodes a beta-ketoacyl CoA synthase involved in biosynthesis of cuticular waxes on rice leaf	 Further analysis indicated that T-DNA was inserted in the 5'-UTR intron of the affected gene, Wax Crystal-Sparse Leaf1 (WSL1), and abnormal transcript caused the loss-of-function of WSL1 gene| Qualitative and quantitative wax composition analyses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) demonstrated a marked reduction of total cuticular wax load on wsl1 leaf blades and sheaths, and VLCFA precursors of C20-C24 decreased in both
