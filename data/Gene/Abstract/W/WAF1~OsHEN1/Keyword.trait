WAF1|OsHEN1	floral	WAVY LEAF1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, regulates shoot development by maintaining MicroRNA and trans-acting small interfering RNA accumulation in rice	About half of the waf1 mutants showed seedling lethality due to defects in SAM maintenance, but the rest survived to the reproductive phase and exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes in leaf morphology and floral development
WAF1|OsHEN1	leaf	WAVY LEAF1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, regulates shoot development by maintaining MicroRNA and trans-acting small interfering RNA accumulation in rice	The rice wavy leaf1 (waf1) mutant has been identified as an embryonic mutant resembling shoot organization1 (sho1) and sho2, homologs of a loss-of-function mutant of DICER-LIKE4 and a hypomorphic mutant of ARGONAUTE7, respectively, which both act in the ta-siRNA production pathway
WAF1|OsHEN1	leaf	WAVY LEAF1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, regulates shoot development by maintaining MicroRNA and trans-acting small interfering RNA accumulation in rice	About half of the waf1 mutants showed seedling lethality due to defects in SAM maintenance, but the rest survived to the reproductive phase and exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes in leaf morphology and floral development
WAF1|OsHEN1	leaf	WAVY LEAF1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, regulates shoot development by maintaining MicroRNA and trans-acting small interfering RNA accumulation in rice	Our results indicate that stabilization of small RNAs by WAF1 is indispensable for rice development, especially for SAM maintenance and leaf morphogenesis governed by the ta-siRNA pathway
WAF1|OsHEN1	reproductive	WAVY LEAF1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, regulates shoot development by maintaining MicroRNA and trans-acting small interfering RNA accumulation in rice	About half of the waf1 mutants showed seedling lethality due to defects in SAM maintenance, but the rest survived to the reproductive phase and exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes in leaf morphology and floral development
WAF1|OsHEN1	shoot	WAVY LEAF1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, regulates shoot development by maintaining MicroRNA and trans-acting small interfering RNA accumulation in rice	The rice wavy leaf1 (waf1) mutant has been identified as an embryonic mutant resembling shoot organization1 (sho1) and sho2, homologs of a loss-of-function mutant of DICER-LIKE4 and a hypomorphic mutant of ARGONAUTE7, respectively, which both act in the ta-siRNA production pathway
WAF1|OsHEN1	seedling	WAVY LEAF1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, regulates shoot development by maintaining MicroRNA and trans-acting small interfering RNA accumulation in rice	About half of the waf1 mutants showed seedling lethality due to defects in SAM maintenance, but the rest survived to the reproductive phase and exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes in leaf morphology and floral development
