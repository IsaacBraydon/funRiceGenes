NA	WSL5, a Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein, is Essential for Chloroplast Biogenesis in Rice Under Cold Stress.	2018	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Chloroplasts play an essential role in plant growth and development, and cold conditions affect chloroplast development. Although many genes or regulators involved in chloroplast biogenesis and development have been isolated and characterized, many components affecting chloroplast biogenesis under cold conditions have not been characterized. Here, we report the functional characterization of a white stripe leaf 5 (wsl5) mutant in rice. The mutant develops white-striped leaves during early leaf development and is albinic when planted under cold stress. Genetic and molecular analysis revealed that WSL5 encodes a novel chloroplast-targeted pentatricopeptide repeat protein. RNA-seq analysis showed that expression of nuclear-encoded photosynthetic genes in the mutant was significantly repressed, and expression of many chloroplast-encoded genes was also significantly changed. Notably, the wsl5 mutation causes defects in editing of rpl2 and atpA, and splicing of rpl2 and rps12. wsl5 was impaired in chloroplast ribosome biogenesis under cold stress. We propose that the WSL5 allele is required for normal chloroplast development in maintaining retrograde signaling from plastids to the nucleus under cold stress.
NA	The coordinated action of PPR4 and EMB2654 on each intron half mediates trans-splicing of rps12 transcripts in plant chloroplasts.	2019	Plant J	Department of Applied Biology, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, 61186, Korea.	The pentatricopeptide repeat proteins PPR4 and EMB2654 have been shown previously to be required for trans-splicing of plastid rps12 transcripts in maize and Arabidopsis, respectively, but their roles in this process are not well understood. We investigated the functions of the arabidopsis and rice orthologs of PPR4, designated AtPPR4 (At5g04810) and OsPPR4 (Os4g58780). Arabidopsis atppr4 and rice osppr4 mutants are embryo-lethal and seedling-lethal 3 weeks after germination, respectively, showing that PPR4 is essential in the development of both dicot and monocot plants. Artificial microRNA-mediated mutants of AtPPR4 displayed a specific defect in rps12 trans-splicing with pale-green, yellowish, or albino phenotypes according to the degree of knockdown of AtPPR4 expression. Comparison of RNA footprints in atppr4 and emb2654 mutants showed a similar concordant loss of extensive footprints at the 3' end of intron 1a and the 5' end of intron 1b in both cases. EMB2654 is known to bind within the footprint region in intron 1a and we show that AtPPR4 binds to the footprint region in intron 1b, via its PPR motifs. Binding of both PPR4 and EMB2654 is essential to juxtapose the two intron halves and to maintain the RNAs in a splicing-competent structure for efficient trans-splicing of rps12 intron1, which is crucial for chloroplast biogenesis and plant development. The similarity of EMB2654 and PPR4 orthologues and their respective binding sites across land plant phylogeny indicates that their coordinate function in rps12 trans-splicing has probably been conserved for 500 million years.
