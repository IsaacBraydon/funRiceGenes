WSL5|OsPPR4	chloroplast	WSL5, a Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein, is Essential for Chloroplast Biogenesis in Rice Under Cold Stress.	 wsl5 was impaired in chloroplast ribosome biogenesis under cold stress
WSL5|OsPPR4	chloroplast	WSL5, a Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein, is Essential for Chloroplast Biogenesis in Rice Under Cold Stress.	 We propose that the WSL5 allele is required for normal chloroplast development in maintaining retrograde signaling from plastids to the nucleus under cold stress

WSL5|OsPPR4	nucleus	WSL5, a Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein, is Essential for Chloroplast Biogenesis in Rice Under Cold Stress.	 We propose that the WSL5 allele is required for normal chloroplast development in maintaining retrograde signaling from plastids to the nucleus under cold stress
WSL5|OsPPR4	chloroplast development	WSL5, a Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein, is Essential for Chloroplast Biogenesis in Rice Under Cold Stress.	 We propose that the WSL5 allele is required for normal chloroplast development in maintaining retrograde signaling from plastids to the nucleus under cold stress
WSL5|OsPPR4	development	The coordinated action of PPR4 and EMB2654 on each intron half mediates trans-splicing of rps12 transcripts in plant chloroplasts.	 Arabidopsis atppr4 and rice osppr4 mutants are embryo-lethal and seedling-lethal 3 weeks after germination, respectively, showing that PPR4 is essential in the development of both dicot and monocot plants
