WSL5|OsPPR4	chloroplast	WSL5, a Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein, is Essential for Chloroplast Biogenesis in Rice Under Cold Stress.	 wsl5 was impaired in chloroplast ribosome biogenesis under cold stress
WSL5|OsPPR4	chloroplast	WSL5, a Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein, is Essential for Chloroplast Biogenesis in Rice Under Cold Stress.	 We propose that the WSL5 allele is required for normal chloroplast development in maintaining retrograde signaling from plastids to the nucleus under cold stress
