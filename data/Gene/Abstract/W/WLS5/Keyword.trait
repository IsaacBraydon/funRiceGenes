WLS5	stomatal	A 3-bp deletion of WLS5 gene leads to weak growth and early leaf senescence in rice.	 The wls5 mutants also exhibited significantly higher stomatal density and altered phytohormone contents compared with wild-type plants
WLS5	phytohormone	A 3-bp deletion of WLS5 gene leads to weak growth and early leaf senescence in rice.	 The wls5 mutants also exhibited significantly higher stomatal density and altered phytohormone contents compared with wild-type plants
WLS5	reactive oxygen species	A 3-bp deletion of WLS5 gene leads to weak growth and early leaf senescence in rice.	 Physiological analysis and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the wls5 cells had abnormal chloroplasts, and the mutants underwent chlorophyll degradation triggered by accumulation of reactive oxygen species
