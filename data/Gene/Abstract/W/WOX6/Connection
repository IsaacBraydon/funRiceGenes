WOX11	WOX6	A Core Regulatory Pathway Controlling Rice Tiller Angle Mediated by the LAZY1-dependent Asymmetric Distribution of Auxin.	 We also show that two functionally redundant transcription factor genes, WUSCHEL RELATED HOMEOBOX6 (WOX6) and WOX11, are expressed asymmetrically in response to auxin to connect gravitropism responses with the control of rice tiller angle
OsHOX28	WOX6	OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 Redundantly Shape Rice Tiller Angle by Reducing HSFA2D Expression and Auxin Content	 In contrast to HSFA2D and LA1, OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 attenuated lateral auxin transport, thus repressing the expression of WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 6 (WOX6) and WOX11 in the lower side of the shoot base of plants subjected to gravistimulation
