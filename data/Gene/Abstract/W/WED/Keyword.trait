WED	defense	Mutation of a Nucleotide-Binding Leucine-Rich Repeat Immune Receptor-Type Protein Disrupts Immunity to Bacterial Blight.	 Intriguingly, besides pattern-triggered immunity, effector-triggered immunity conferred by different R proteins, including Xa3/Xa26, Xa4, and Xa21, was also disturbed by wed to a certain extent, indicating the existence of shared regulatory mechanisms for various defense systems
WED	salicylic acid	Mutation of a Nucleotide-Binding Leucine-Rich Repeat Immune Receptor-Type Protein Disrupts Immunity to Bacterial Blight.	 The unexpected accumulation of salicylic acid (SA), along with downregulation of NONEXPRESSOR OF PR1 (NPR1), in wed indicates the potential presence of a feedback regulation loop of SA biosynthesis in rice
WED	R protein	Mutation of a Nucleotide-Binding Leucine-Rich Repeat Immune Receptor-Type Protein Disrupts Immunity to Bacterial Blight.
