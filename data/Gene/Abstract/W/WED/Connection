OsRac1	WED	Mutation of a Nucleotide-Binding Leucine-Rich Repeat Immune Receptor-Type Protein Disrupts Immunity to Bacterial Blight.	 Epistasis analyses illustrated that SA accumulation and the NLR-associated components RAR1, OsRac1, and PhyB are indispensable for the wed phenotypes
PHYB|OsphyB	WED	Mutation of a Nucleotide-Binding Leucine-Rich Repeat Immune Receptor-Type Protein Disrupts Immunity to Bacterial Blight.	 Epistasis analyses illustrated that SA accumulation and the NLR-associated components RAR1, OsRac1, and PhyB are indispensable for the wed phenotypes
WED	xa21	Mutation of a Nucleotide-Binding Leucine-Rich Repeat Immune Receptor-Type Protein Disrupts Immunity to Bacterial Blight.	 Intriguingly, besides pattern-triggered immunity, effector-triggered immunity conferred by different R proteins, including Xa3/Xa26, Xa4, and Xa21, was also disturbed by wed to a certain extent, indicating the existence of shared regulatory mechanisms for various defense systems
WED	Xa4	Mutation of a Nucleotide-Binding Leucine-Rich Repeat Immune Receptor-Type Protein Disrupts Immunity to Bacterial Blight.	 Intriguingly, besides pattern-triggered immunity, effector-triggered immunity conferred by different R proteins, including Xa3/Xa26, Xa4, and Xa21, was also disturbed by wed to a certain extent, indicating the existence of shared regulatory mechanisms for various defense systems
