OsGL1-1|WSL2	drought	Rice OsGL1-1 is involved in leaf cuticular wax and cuticle membrane	 Compared to the wild-type, the osgl1-1 mutant showed decreased cuticular wax deposition, thinner cuticular membrane, decreased chlorophyll leaching, increased rate of water loss, and enhanced sensitivity to drought
OsGL1-1|WSL2	leaf	Rice OsGL1-1 is involved in leaf cuticular wax and cuticle membrane	In the present study, we characterized a rice leaf wax-deficient mutant osgl1-1 derived from a spontaneous mutation, which exhibited a wax-deficient and highly hydrophilic leaf phenotype
OsGL1-1|WSL2	leaf	Rice OsGL1-1 is involved in leaf cuticular wax and cuticle membrane	Rice OsGL1-1 is involved in leaf cuticular wax and cuticle membrane
OsGL1-1|WSL2	cuticle	Rice OsGL1-1 is involved in leaf cuticular wax and cuticle membrane	Rice OsGL1-1 is involved in leaf cuticular wax and cuticle membrane
