NA	Genome-wide association study using whole-genome sequencing rapidly identifies new genes influencing agronomic traits in rice.	2016	Nat Genet	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan.	A genome-wide association study (GWAS) can be a powerful tool for the identification of genes associated with agronomic traits in crop species, but it is often hindered by population structure and the large extent of linkage disequilibrium. In this study, we identified agronomically important genes in rice using GWAS based on whole-genome sequencing, followed by the screening of candidate genes based on the estimated effect of nucleotide polymorphisms. Using this approach, we identified four new genes associated with agronomic traits. Some genes were undetectable by standard SNP analysis, but we detected them using gene-based association analysis. This study provides fundamental insights relevant to the rapid identification of genes associated with agronomic traits using GWAS and will accelerate future efforts aimed at crop improvement.
NA	Loss of function at RAE2, a previously unidentified EPFL, is required for awnlessness in cultivated Asian rice.	2016	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa, Nagoya, Aichi 464-8601, Japan;	Domestication of crops based on artificial selection has contributed numerous beneficial traits for agriculture. Wild characteristics such as red pericarp and seed shattering were lost in both Asian (Oryza sativa) and African (Oryza glaberrima) cultivated rice species as a result of human selection on common genes. Awnedness, in contrast, is a trait that has been lost in both cultivated species due to selection on different sets of genes. In a previous report, we revealed that at least three loci regulate awn development in rice; however, the molecular mechanism underlying awnlessness remains unknown. Here we isolate and characterize a previously unidentified EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE (EPFL) family member named REGULATOR OF AWN ELONGATION 2 (RAE2) and identify one of its requisite processing enzymes, SUBTILISIN-LIKE PROTEASE 1 (SLP1). The RAE2 precursor is specifically cleaved by SLP1 in the rice spikelet, where the mature RAE2 peptide subsequently induces awn elongation. Analysis of RAE2 sequence diversity identified a highly variable GC-rich region harboring multiple independent mutations underlying protein-length variation that disrupt the function of the RAE2 protein and condition the awnless phenotype in Asian rice. Cultivated African rice, on the other hand, retained the functional RAE2 allele despite its awnless phenotype. Our findings illuminate the molecular function of RAE2 in awn development and shed light on the independent domestication histories of Asian and African cultivated rice.
NA	GAD1 Encodes a Secreted Peptide That Regulates Grain Number, Grain Length and Awn Development in Rice Domestication.	2016	Plant Cell	China Agricultural University CITY: Beijing China [CN].	Cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) was domesticated from wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.), which typically displays fewer grains per panicle and longer grains than cultivated rice. In addition, wild rice has long awns, whereas cultivated rice has short awns or lacks them altogether. These changes represent critical events in rice domestication. Here, we identified a major gene, GRAIN NUMBER, GRAIN LENGTH AND AWN DEVELOPMENT 1 (GAD1), that regulates those critical changes during rice domestication. GAD1 is located on chromosome 8 and is predicted to encode a small secretary signal peptide belonging to the EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE family. A frame-shift insertion in gad1 destroyed the conserved cysteine residues of the peptide, resulting in a loss of function, and causing the increased number of grains per panicle, shorter grains and awnless phenotype characteristic of cultivated rice. Our findings provide a useful paradigm for revealing functions of peptide signal molecules in plant development and helps elucidate the molecular basis of rice domestication.
NA	Explore the genetics of weedy traits using rice 3K database	2021	Bot Stud	Department of Agronomy, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Rd, Da'an Dist., Taipei, 10617, Taiwan.	Background: Weedy rice, a conspecific weedy counterpart of the cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.), has been problematic in rice-production area worldwide. Although we started to know about the origin of some weedy traits for some rice-growing regions, an overall assessment of weedy trait-related loci was not yet available. On the other hand, the advances in sequencing technologies, together with community efforts, have made publicly available a large amount of genomic data. Given the availability of public data and the need of "weedy" allele mining for a better management of weedy rice, the objective of the present study was to explore the genetic architecture of weedy traits based on publicly available data, mainly from the 3000 Rice Genome Project (3K-RGP).  Results: Based on the results of population structure analysis, we have selected 1378 individuals from four sub-populations (aus, indica, temperate japonica, tropical japonica) without admixed genomic composition for genome-wide association analysis (GWAS). Five traits were investigated: awn color, seed shattering, seed threshability, seed coat color, and seedling height. GWAS was conducted for each sub-population ¡Á trait combination and we have identified 66 population-specific trait-associated SNPs. Eleven significant SNPs fell into an annotated gene and four other SNPs were close to a putative candidate gene (¡À 25 kb). SNPs located in or close to Rc were particularly predictive of the occurrence of seed coat color and our results showed that different sub-populations required different SNPs for a better seed coat color prediction. We compared the data of 3K-RGP to a publicly available weedy rice dataset. The profile of allele frequency, phenotype-genotype segregation of target SNP, as well as GWAS results for the presence and absence of awns diverged between the two sets of data.  Conclusions: The genotype of trait-associated SNPs identified in this study, especially those located in or close to Rc, can be developed to diagnostic SNPs to trace the origin of weedy trait occurred in the field. The difference of results from the two publicly available datasets used in this study emphasized the importance of laboratory experiments to confirm the allele mining results based on publicly available data.
