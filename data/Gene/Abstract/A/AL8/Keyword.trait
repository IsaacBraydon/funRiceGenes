AL8|RAE2	domestication	Loss of function at RAE2, a previously unidentified EPFL, is required for awnlessness in cultivated Asian rice.	 Our findings illuminate the molecular function of RAE2 in awn development and shed light on the independent domestication histories of Asian and African cultivated rice

AL8|RAE2	 awn 	Loss of function at RAE2, a previously unidentified EPFL, is required for awnlessness in cultivated Asian rice.	 The RAE2 precursor is specifically cleaved by SLP1 in the rice spikelet, where the mature RAE2 peptide subsequently induces awn elongation
