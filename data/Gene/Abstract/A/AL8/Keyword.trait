AL8|RAE2|GAD1	domestication	Loss of function at RAE2, a previously unidentified EPFL, is required for awnlessness in cultivated Asian rice.	 Our findings illuminate the molecular function of RAE2 in awn development and shed light on the independent domestication histories of Asian and African cultivated rice
AL8|RAE2|GAD1	development	Loss of function at RAE2, a previously unidentified EPFL, is required for awnlessness in cultivated Asian rice.	 Our findings illuminate the molecular function of RAE2 in awn development and shed light on the independent domestication histories of Asian and African cultivated rice
AL8|RAE2|GAD1	 awn 	Loss of function at RAE2, a previously unidentified EPFL, is required for awnlessness in cultivated Asian rice.	 The RAE2 precursor is specifically cleaved by SLP1 in the rice spikelet, where the mature RAE2 peptide subsequently induces awn elongation
AL8|RAE2|GAD1	 awn 	Loss of function at RAE2, a previously unidentified EPFL, is required for awnlessness in cultivated Asian rice.	 Our findings illuminate the molecular function of RAE2 in awn development and shed light on the independent domestication histories of Asian and African cultivated rice
AL8|RAE2|GAD1	grain	GAD1 Encodes a Secreted Peptide That Regulates Grain Number, Grain Length and Awn Development in Rice Domestication.	GAD1 Encodes a Secreted Peptide That Regulates Grain Number, Grain Length and Awn Development in Rice Domestication.
AL8|RAE2|GAD1	development	GAD1 Encodes a Secreted Peptide That Regulates Grain Number, Grain Length and Awn Development in Rice Domestication.	GAD1 Encodes a Secreted Peptide That Regulates Grain Number, Grain Length and Awn Development in Rice Domestication.
AL8|RAE2|GAD1	 awn 	GAD1 Encodes a Secreted Peptide That Regulates Grain Number, Grain Length and Awn Development in Rice Domestication.	GAD1 Encodes a Secreted Peptide That Regulates Grain Number, Grain Length and Awn Development in Rice Domestication.
AL8|RAE2|GAD1	grains per panicle	GAD1 Encodes a Secreted Peptide That Regulates Grain Number, Grain Length and Awn Development in Rice Domestication.	 A frame-shift insertion in gad1 destroyed the conserved cysteine residues of the peptide, resulting in a loss of function, and causing the increased number of grains per panicle, shorter grains and awnless phenotype characteristic of cultivated rice
