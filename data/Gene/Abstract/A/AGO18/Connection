AGO18|OsAGO18	miR528	Jasmonate Signaling Enhances RNA Silencing and Antiviral Defense in Rice.	 Here, we show that jasmonate (JA) signaling transcriptionally activates Argonaute 18 (AGO18), a core RNA silencing component that promotes rice antiviral defense through sequestering miR168 and miR528, which repress key antiviral defense proteins

AGO18|OsAGO18	JAmyb|OsJAmyb|OsMYB21	Jasmonate Signaling Enhances RNA Silencing and Antiviral Defense in Rice.	 Mechanistically, the JA-responsive transcription factor JAMYB directly binds to the AGO18 promoter to activate AGO18 transcription
AGO18|OsAGO18	OsMIR168a	CRISPR-Cas9 mediated OsMIR168a knockout reveals its pleiotropy in rice.	 Intriguingly, OsAGO18, a member of a new AGO clade that is conserved in monocots, was confirmed to be a target of OsMIR168a not only by informatic prediction but also by expression analysis and a cell-based cleavage assay in the OsMIR168a mutants
AGO18|OsAGO18	OsMIR168a	CRISPR-Cas9 mediated OsMIR168a knockout reveals its pleiotropy in rice.	 Many protein-coding genes and miRNAs showed differential expression in the OsMIR168a mutants, suggesting OsMIR168a exerts a major transcriptional regulatory role, likely through its potential target genes such as OsAGO1s and OsAGO18
