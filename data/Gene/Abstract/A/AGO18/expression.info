AGO18	 Expression of miR168-resistant AGO1a in ago18 background rescues or increases rice antiviral activity |  Notably, stable transgenic expression of AGO18 confers broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice	 Genetic studies reveal that the antiviral function of AGO18 depends on its activity to sequester microRNA168 (miR168) to alleviate repression of rice AGO1 essential for antiviral RNAi
