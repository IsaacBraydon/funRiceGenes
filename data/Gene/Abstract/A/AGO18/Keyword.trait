AGO18|OsAGO18	resistance	Viral-inducible Argonaute18 confers broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice by sequestering a host microRNA.	Notably, stable transgenic expression of AGO18 confers broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice
AGO18|OsAGO18	antiviral immunity	Viral-inducible Argonaute18 confers broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice by sequestering a host microRNA	AGO18 is specifically induced by viral infection and required for antiviral immunity
AGO18|OsAGO18	development	Loss of function of Oryza sativa Argonaute 18 induces male sterility and reduction in phased small RNAs.	In this manuscript, we show that Oryza sativa indica Argonaute protein AGO18 is required for male gametophyte development likely to through a small RNA-mediated mechanism
AGO18|OsAGO18	development	Loss of function of Oryza sativa Argonaute 18 induces male sterility and reduction in phased small RNAs.	 Although expression of rice AGO18 in specific stages of male gametogenesis has been documented, its major functions in plant development remain poorly understood
AGO18|OsAGO18	development	Loss of function of Oryza sativa Argonaute 18 induces male sterility and reduction in phased small RNAs.	 Here, we show that Oryza sativa indica AGO18 is involved in male gametophyte development
AGO18|OsAGO18	plant development	Loss of function of Oryza sativa Argonaute 18 induces male sterility and reduction in phased small RNAs.	 Although expression of rice AGO18 in specific stages of male gametogenesis has been documented, its major functions in plant development remain poorly understood
AGO18|OsAGO18	fertility	Loss of function of Oryza sativa Argonaute 18 induces male sterility and reduction in phased small RNAs.	 Our results indicate a distinct role for rice AGO18 in male fertility
