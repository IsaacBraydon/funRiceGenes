APIP4	resistance	A Fungal Effector and a Rice NLR Protein Have Antagonistic Effects on a Bowman-Birk Trypsin Inhibitor.	 Knock-out of APIP4 in rice enhanced susceptibility and overexpression of APIP4 increased resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae
APIP4	magnaporthe oryzae	A Fungal Effector and a Rice NLR Protein Have Antagonistic Effects on a Bowman-Birk Trypsin Inhibitor.	 Knock-out of APIP4 in rice enhanced susceptibility and overexpression of APIP4 increased resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae
APIP4	R protein	A Fungal Effector and a Rice NLR Protein Have Antagonistic Effects on a Bowman-Birk Trypsin Inhibitor.	 By contrast, the rice NLR protein Piz-t interacted with APIP4£¬enhancing APIP4 transcript and protein levels, and protease inhibitor activity
APIP4	immunity	A Fungal Effector and a Rice NLR Protein Have Antagonistic Effects on a Bowman-Birk Trypsin Inhibitor.	 Here, we show that the rice (Oryza sativa) BBI protein APIP4 is  a common target of a fungal effector and an NLR receptor for innate immunity
APIP4	innate immunity	A Fungal Effector and a Rice NLR Protein Have Antagonistic Effects on a Bowman-Birk Trypsin Inhibitor.	 Here, we show that the rice (Oryza sativa) BBI protein APIP4 is  a common target of a fungal effector and an NLR receptor for innate immunity
APIP4	pathogen	A Fungal Effector and a Rice NLR Protein Have Antagonistic Effects on a Bowman-Birk Trypsin Inhibitor.	 Knock-out of APIP4 in rice enhanced susceptibility and overexpression of APIP4 increased resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae
