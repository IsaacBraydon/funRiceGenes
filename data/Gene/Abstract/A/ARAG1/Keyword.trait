ARAG1	drought tolerance	ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice	ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice
ARAG1	inflorescence	ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice	KEY RESULTS: ARAG1 was expressed in inflorescences, roots, immature embryos and germinating seeds, but not in coleoptiles, leaves or mature embryos
ARAG1	 ABA 	ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice	ARAG1 knockdown line was hypersensitive to ABA application during seed germination and seedling growth
ARAG1	 ABA 	ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice	CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ARAG1 was involved in the ABA signalling and stress responsive pathways
ARAG1	root	ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice	KEY RESULTS: ARAG1 was expressed in inflorescences, roots, immature embryos and germinating seeds, but not in coleoptiles, leaves or mature embryos
ARAG1	growth	ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice	ARAG1 knockdown line was hypersensitive to ABA application during seed germination and seedling growth
ARAG1	seed germination	ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice	ARAG1 knockdown line was hypersensitive to ABA application during seed germination and seedling growth
ARAG1	seed germination	ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice	ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice
ARAG1	drought	ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice	 Knockdown of ARAG1 weakened tolerance of the transgenic seedlings to drought stress, while over-expression of it increased the tolerance slightly
