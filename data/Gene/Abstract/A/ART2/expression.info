ART2	 We functionally characterized one of the ART1 homologs, ART2, in terms of tissue and spatial expression, subcellular localization, transcriptional activation activity, and phenotypic analysis of the knockout lines |  ART2 was mainly expressed in the roots, but the expression level was much lower than that of ART1 |  The ART2 expression was rapidly induced by Al in the roots of the wild-type rice, but not in art1 mutant |  Expression profile analysis by RNA-sequencing showed that ART2 was not involved in activation of genes regulated by ART1; however, four genes seems to be regulated by ART2, which are implicated in Al tolerance
