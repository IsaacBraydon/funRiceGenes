ART1	ART2	Functional characterization of an aluminum (Al)-inducible transcription factor, ART2, revealed a different pathway for Al tolerance in rice.	 We functionally characterized one of the ART1 homologs, ART2, in terms of tissue and spatial expression, subcellular localization, transcriptional activation activity, and phenotypic analysis of the knockout lines
ART1	ART2	Functional characterization of an aluminum (Al)-inducible transcription factor, ART2, revealed a different pathway for Al tolerance in rice.	 ART2 was mainly expressed in the roots, but the expression level was much lower than that of ART1
ART1	ART2	Functional characterization of an aluminum (Al)-inducible transcription factor, ART2, revealed a different pathway for Al tolerance in rice.	 The ART2 expression was rapidly induced by Al in the roots of the wild-type rice, but not in art1 mutant
ART1	ART2	Functional characterization of an aluminum (Al)-inducible transcription factor, ART2, revealed a different pathway for Al tolerance in rice.	 These results indicate that ART1 and ART2 regulate different pathways leading to Al tolerance, and ATR2 plays a supplementary role in Al tolerance in rice
