AID1|OsMYBR57	 We found that OsMYBR57, an MYB-related protein, directly regulates the expression of several key drought-related OsbZIPs in response to drought treatment |  We further demonstrate that OsFTIP6 interacts with OsHB22 and promotes the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of OsHB22 into the nucleus, where OsHB22 cooperates with OsMYBR57 to regulate the expression of drought-responsive genes |  The OsFTIP6-mediated OsHB22 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and OsMYBR57-OsHB22 regulation of OsbZIPÂ transcription ensure precise control of expression of OsLEA3 and Rab21, and thereby regulate the response to water deficiency in rice
