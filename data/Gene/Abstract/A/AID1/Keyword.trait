AID1|OsMYBR57	flower	The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice	In addition, aid1 mutant plants had fewer tillers and flowered 10 to 15 d later than the wild type
AID1|OsMYBR57	pollen	The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice	Spikelets of the aid1 mutant could be classified into three types based on the viability of pollen grains and the extent of anther dehiscence
AID1|OsMYBR57	panicle	The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice	AID1 was expressed in both the leaves and panicles of wild-type plants, but not in mutant plants
AID1|OsMYBR57	spikelet	The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice	cv Nipponbare) recessive mutant, anther indehiscence1 (aid1), showing partial to complete spikelet sterility
AID1|OsMYBR57	spikelet	The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice	Spikelets of the aid1 mutant could be classified into three types based on the viability of pollen grains and the extent of anther dehiscence
AID1|OsMYBR57	grain	The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice	Spikelets of the aid1 mutant could be classified into three types based on the viability of pollen grains and the extent of anther dehiscence
AID1|OsMYBR57	tiller	The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice	In addition, aid1 mutant plants had fewer tillers and flowered 10 to 15 d later than the wild type
AID1|OsMYBR57	anther	The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice	cv Nipponbare) recessive mutant, anther indehiscence1 (aid1), showing partial to complete spikelet sterility
AID1|OsMYBR57	anther	The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice	Spikelets of the aid1 mutant could be classified into three types based on the viability of pollen grains and the extent of anther dehiscence
AID1|OsMYBR57	sterility	The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice	cv Nipponbare) recessive mutant, anther indehiscence1 (aid1), showing partial to complete spikelet sterility
AID1|OsMYBR57	transcription factor	The OsFTIP6-OsHB22-OsMYBR57 module regulates drought response in rice.	 Further studies revealed that OsMYBR57 interacts with a homeodomain transcription factor, OsHB22, which also plays a positive role in drought signaling
AID1|OsMYBR57	drought	The OsFTIP6-OsHB22-OsMYBR57 module regulates drought response in rice.	 In this study, we isolated an Osmybr57 mutant that displays a drought-sensitive phenotype through a genetic screen for drought stress sensitivity
