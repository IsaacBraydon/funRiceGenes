Plant Physiol.-2004-Zhu-1514-25.pdf	The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice	2004	Plant Physiol	CSIRO Plant Industry, Canberra, Australian Capital Territories 2601, Australia.	Using a two-element iAc/Ds transposon-tagging system, we identified a rice (Oryza sativa L. cv Nipponbare) recessive mutant, anther indehiscence1 (aid1), showing partial to complete spikelet sterility. Spikelets of the aid1 mutant could be classified into three types based on the viability of pollen grains and the extent of anther dehiscence. Type 1 spikelets (approximately 25%) were sterile due to a failure in accumulation of starch in pollen grains. Type 2 spikelets (approximately 55%) had viable pollen grains, but anthers failed to dehisce and/or synchronize with anthesis due to failure in septum degradation and stomium breakage, resulting in sterility. Type 3 spikelets (approximately 20%) had normal fertility. In addition, aid1 mutant plants had fewer tillers and flowered 10 to 15 d later than the wild type. The Ds insertion responsible for the aid1 mutation was mapped within the coding region of the AID1 gene on chromosome 6, which is predicted to encode a novel protein of 426 amino acids with a single MYB domain. The MYB domain of AID1 is closely related to that of the telomere-binding proteins of human, mouse, and Arabidopsis, and of single MYB domain transcriptional regulators in plants such as PcMYB1 and ZmIBP1. AID1 was expressed in both the leaves and panicles of wild-type plants, but not in mutant plants.
NA	The OsFTIP6-OsHB22-OsMYBR57 module regulates drought response in rice.	2022	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Resources, Institute of Crop Science, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Plants have evolved a sophisticated set of mechanisms to adapt to drought stress. Transcription factors play crucial roles in plant responses to various environmental stimuli by modulating the expression of numerous stress-responsive genes. However, how the crosstalk between different transcription factor families orchestrates initiation of the key transcriptional network and the role of posttranscriptional modification of transcription factors, especially in cellular localization/trafficking in response to stress in rice, remain still largely unknown. In this study, we isolated an Osmybr57 mutant that displays a drought-sensitive phenotype through a genetic screen for drought stress sensitivity. We found that OsMYBR57, an MYB-related protein, directly regulates the expression of several key drought-related OsbZIPs in response to drought treatment. Further studies revealed that OsMYBR57 interacts with a homeodomain transcription factor, OsHB22, which also plays a positive role in drought signaling. We further demonstrate that OsFTIP6 interacts with OsHB22 and promotes the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of OsHB22 into the nucleus, where OsHB22 cooperates with OsMYBR57 to regulate the expression of drought-responsive genes. Our findings have revealed a mechanistic framework underlying the OsFTIP6-OsHB22-OsMYBR57 module-mediated regulation of drought response in rice. The OsFTIP6-mediated OsHB22 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and OsMYBR57-OsHB22 regulation of OsbZIP transcription ensure precise control of expression of OsLEA3 and Rab21, and thereby regulate the response to water deficiency in rice.
