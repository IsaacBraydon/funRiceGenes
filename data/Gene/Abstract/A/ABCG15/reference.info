jipb12053.pdf	The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice	2013	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.	Plant male reproductive development is a complex biological process, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, we characterized a rice (Oryza sativa L.) male sterile mutant. Based on map-based cloning and sequence analysis, we identified a 1,459-bp deletion in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene, OsABCG15, causing abnormal anthers and male sterility. Therefore, we named this mutant osabcg15. Expression analysis showed that OsABCG15 is expressed specifically in developmental anthers from stage 8 (meiosis II stage) to stage 10 (late microspore stage). Two genes CYP704B2 and WDA1, involved in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids for the establishment of the anther cuticle and pollen exine, were downregulated in osabcg15 mutant, suggesting that OsABCG15 may play a key function in the processes related to sporopollenin biosynthesis or sporopollenin transfer from tapetal cells to anther locules. Consistently, histological analysis showed that osabcg15 mutants developed obvious abnormality in postmeiotic tapetum degeneration, leading to rapid degredation of young microspores. The results suggest that OsABCG15 plays a critical role in exine formation and pollen development, similar to the homologous gene of AtABCG26 in Arabidopsis. This work is helpful to understand the regulatory network in rice anther development.
Plant Cell Physiol-2013-Qin-138-54.pdf	ABCG15 encodes an ABC transporter protein, and is essential for post-meiotic anther and pollen exine development in rice	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	Rice Research Institute of Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu Wenjiang, Sichuan, 611130, PR China.	In flowering plants, anther and pollen development is critical for male reproductive success. The anther cuticle and pollen exine play an essential role, and in many cereals, such as rice, orbicules/ubisch bodies are also thought to be important for pollen development. The formation of the anther cuticle, exine and orbicules is associated with the biosynthesis and transport of wax, cutin and sporopollenin components. Recently, progress has been made in understanding the biosynthesis of sporopollenin and cutin components in Arabidopsis and rice, but less is known about the mechanisms by which they are transported to the sites of deposition. Here, we report that the rice ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCG15, is essential for post-meiotic anther and pollen development, and is proposed to play a role in the transport of rice anther cuticle and sporopollenin precursors. ABCG15 is highly expressed in the tapetum at the young microspore stage, and the abcg15 mutant exhibits small, white anthers lacking mature pollen, lipidic cuticle, orbicules and pollen exine. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the abcg15 anther cuticle revealed significant reductions in a number of wax components and aliphatic cutin monomers. The expression level of genes involved in lipid metabolism in the abcg15 mutant was significantly different from their levels in the wild type, possibly due to perturbations in the homeostasis of anther lipid metabolism. Our study provides new insights for understanding the molecular mechanism of the formation of the anther cuticle, orbicules and pollen wall, as well as the machinery for lipid metabolism in rice anthers.
NA	OsABCG15 encodes a membrane protein that plays an important role in anther cuticle and pollen exine formation in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, China.	An ABC transporter gene ( OsABCG15 ) was proven to be involved in pollen development in rice. The corresponding protein was localized on the plasma membrane using subcellular localization. Wax, cutin, and sporopollenin are important for normal development of the anther cuticle and pollen exine, respectively. Their lipid soluble precursors, which are produced in the tapetum, are then secreted and transferred to the anther and microspore surface for polymerization. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the transport of these precursors. Here, we identified and characterized a member of the G subfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, OsABCG15, which is required for the secretion of these lipid-soluble precursors in rice. Using map-based cloning, we found a spontaneous A-to-C transition in the fourth exon of OsABCG15 that caused an amino acid substitution of Thr-to-Pro in the predicted ATP-binding domain of the protein sequence. This osabcg15 mutant failed to produce any viable pollen and was completely male sterile. Histological analysis indicated that osabcg15 exhibited an undeveloped anther cuticle, enlarged middle layer, abnormal Ubisch body development, tapetum degeneration with a falling apart style, and collapsed pollen grains without detectable exine. OsABCG15 was expressed preferentially in the tapetum, and the fused GFP-OsABCG15 protein was localized to the plasma membrane. Our results suggested that OsABCG15 played an essential role in the formation of the rice anther cuticle and pollen exine. This role may include the secretion of the lipid precursors from the tapetum to facilitate the transfer of precursors to the surface of the anther epidermis as well as to microspores.
