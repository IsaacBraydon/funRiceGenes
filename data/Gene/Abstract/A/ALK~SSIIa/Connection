ALK|SSIIa	OsSSIIIa|Flo5	Double repression of soluble starch synthase genes SSIIa and SSIIIa in rice (Oryza sativa L.) uncovers interactive effects on the physicochemical properties of starch	To study the potential functional interactions of SS genes, we generated SSIIa/SSIIIa double repression lines whose kernels displayed a chalky kernel appearance and had increased amylose levels, increased pasting temperatures, and decreased viscosities
ALK|SSIIa	OsSSIIIa|Flo5	Double repression of soluble starch synthase genes SSIIa and SSIIIa in rice (Oryza sativa L.) uncovers interactive effects on the physicochemical properties of starch	Consistent with their expression domains, RNAi repression of genes that encode isozymes SSI, SSIIa, and SSIIIa had strong effects on grain development, whereas no obvious phenotypic changes were observed in transgenic plants with the other SS genes being RNAi repressed, indicating functional redundancies among the genes
ALK|SSIIa	OsSSIIIa|Flo5	Double repression of soluble starch synthase genes SSIIa and SSIIIa in rice (Oryza sativa L.) uncovers interactive effects on the physicochemical properties of starch	The nonadditive nature of the double mutation line suggests that SSIIa and SSIIIa interact with each other during starch synthesis
ALK|SSIIa	OsSSIIIa|Flo5	Double repression of soluble starch synthase genes SSIIa and SSIIIa in rice (Oryza sativa L.) uncovers interactive effects on the physicochemical properties of starch	Collectively, the data showed that SSIIa and SSIIIa play distinctive, but partially overlapping, roles during rice grain starch synthesis
ALK|SSIIa	OsSSIIIa|Flo5	Double repression of soluble starch synthase genes SSIIa and SSIIIa in rice (Oryza sativa L.) uncovers interactive effects on the physicochemical properties of starch	Double repression of soluble starch synthase genes SSIIa and SSIIIa in rice (Oryza sativa L.) uncovers interactive effects on the physicochemical properties of starch

ALK|SSIIa	Wx	Genomic Regions Involved in Differences in Eating and Cooking Quality Other than Wx and Alk Genes between indica and japonica Rice Cultivars	 These QTLs appear to be widely distributed among indica cultivars and to be novel genetic factors for eating quality traits because their chromosome regions differed from those of the GBSSI (Wx) and SSIIa (Alk) genes
