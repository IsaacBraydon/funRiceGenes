To analyze their interest for rice breeding for water-limited environments, this gene family was characterized further. Genomic organization of the gene family reveals six members located on four different chromosomes and with the same exon-intron structure. The maintenance of six members of the Asr gene family, which are the result of combination between tandem duplication and whole genome duplication, and their differential regulation under water stress, involves probably some sub-functionalization. The polymorphism of four members was studied in a worldwide collection of 204 accessions of Oryza sativa L. and 14 accessions of wild relatives (O. rufipogon and O. nivara). The nucleotide diversity of the Asr genes was globally low, but contrasted for the different genes, leading to different shapes of haplotype networks. Statistical tests for neutrality were used and compared to their distribution in a set of 111 reference genes spread across the genome, derived from another published study. Asr3 diversity exhibited a pattern concordant with a balancing selection at the species level and with a directional selection in the tropical japonica sub-group. This study provides a thorough description of the organization of the Asr family, and the nucleotide and haplotype diversity of four Asr in Oryza sativa species. Asr3 stood out as the best potential candidate. The polymorphism detected here represents a first step towards an association study between genetic polymorphisms of this gene family and variation in drought tolerance traits.
pce2553.pdf	Involvement of ASR genes in aluminium tolerance mechanisms in rice	2013	Plant Cell Environ	Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Genetica e Biologia Molecular Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Biologia Celular e Molecular, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.	Among cereal crops, rice is considered the most tolerant to aluminium (Al). However, variability among rice genotypes leads to remarkable differences in the degree of Al tolerance for distinct cultivars. A number of studies have demonstrated that rice plants achieve Al tolerance through an unknown mechanism that is independent of root tip Al exclusion. We have analysed expression changes of the rice ASR gene family as a function of Al treatment. The gene ASR5 was differentially regulated in the Al-tolerant rice ssp. Japonica cv. Nipponbare. However, ASR5 expression did not respond to Al exposure in Indica cv. Taim rice roots, which are highly Al sensitive. Transgenic plants carrying RNAi constructs that targeted the ASR genes were obtained, and increased Al susceptibility was observed in T1 plants. Embryogenic calli of transgenic rice carrying an ASR5-green fluorescent protein fusion revealed that ASR5 was localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Using a proteomic approach to compare non-transformed and ASR-RNAi plants, a total of 41 proteins with contrasting expression patterns were identified. We suggest that the ASR5 protein acts as a transcription factor to regulate the expression of different genes that collectively protect rice cells from Al-induced stress responses.
NA	PGPR-induced OsASR6 improves plant growth and yield by altering root auxin sensitivity and the xylem structure in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana.	2019	J Plant Physiol	Plant Gene Expression Lab, CSIR- National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow, 226001, India; Integral University, Lucknow, India.	Plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) improve plant growth by altering the root architecture, although the mechanisms underlying this alteration have yet to be unravelled. Through microarray analysis of PGPR-treated rice roots, a large number of differentially regulated genes were identified. Ectopic expression of one of these genes, OsASR6 (ABA STRESS RIPENING6), had a remarkable effect on plant growth in Arabidopsis. Transgenic lines over-expressing OsASR6 had larger leaves, taller inflorescence bolts and greater numbers of siliques and seeds. The most prominent effect was observed in root growth, with the root biomass increasing four-fold compared with the shoot biomass increase of 1.7-fold. Transgenic OsASR6 over-expressing plants showed higher conductance, transpiration and photosynthesis rates, leading to an Ëœ30% higher seed yield compared with the control. Interestingly, OsASR6 expression led to alterations in the xylem structure, an increase in the xylem vessel size and altered lignification, which correlated with higher conductance. OsASR6 is activated by auxin and, in turn, increases auxin responses and root auxin sensitivity, as observed by the increased expression of auxin-responsive genes, such as SAUR32 and PINOID, and the key auxin transcription factor, ARF5. Collectively, these phenomena led to an increased root density. The effects of OsASR6 expression largely mimic the beneficial effects of PGPRs in rice, indicating that OsASR6 activation may be a key factor governing PGPR-mediated changes in rice. OsASR6 is a potential candidate for the manipulation of rice for improved productivity.
