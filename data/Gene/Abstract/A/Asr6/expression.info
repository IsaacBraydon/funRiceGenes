Asr6|OsASR6	 Ectopic expression of one of these genes, OsASR6 (ABA STRESS RIPENING6), had a remarkable effect on plant growth in Arabidopsis |  Interestingly, OsASR6 expression led to alterations in the xylem structure, an increase in the xylem vessel size and altered lignification, which correlated with higher conductance |  OsASR6 is activated by auxin and, in turn, increases auxin responses and root auxin sensitivity, as observed by the increased expression of auxin-responsive genes, such as SAUR32 and PINOID, and the key auxin transcription factor, ARF5 |  The effects of OsASR6 expression largely mimic the beneficial effects of PGPRs in rice, indicating that OsASR6 activation may be a key factor governing PGPR-mediated changes in rice
