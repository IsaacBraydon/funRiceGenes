AL2	seedling	Albino Leaf 2 is involved in the splicing of chloroplast group I and II introns in rice.	 Phenotypic analysis revealed that the al2 mutation caused obvious albino leaves at the early developmental stage, eventually leading to al2 seedling death
AL2	chloroplast	Albino Leaf 2 is involved in the splicing of chloroplast group I and II introns in rice.	 Electron microscopy investigations indicated that the chloroplast structure was disrupted in the al2 mutants at an early developmental stage and subsequently resulted in the breakdown of the entire chloroplast
AL2	chloroplast	Albino Leaf 2 is involved in the splicing of chloroplast group I and II introns in rice.	 Molecular cloning illustrated that AL2 encodes a chloroplast group IIA intron splicing facilitator (CRS1) in rice, which was confirmed by a genetic complementation experiment
AL2	chloroplast	Albino Leaf 2 is involved in the splicing of chloroplast group I and II introns in rice.	 Interestingly, we found that the expression levels of a subset of chloroplast genes that contain group IIA and IIB introns were significantly reduced in the al2 mutant compared to that in the wild type, suggesting that AL2 is a functional CRS1 in rice
AL2	chloroplast	Albino Leaf 2 is involved in the splicing of chloroplast group I and II introns in rice.	 Differing from the orthologous CRS1 in maize and Arabidopsis that only regulates splicing of the chloroplast group II intron, our results demonstrated that the AL2 gene is also likely to be involved in the splicing of the chloroplast group I intron
AL2	chloroplast	Albino Leaf 2 is involved in the splicing of chloroplast group I and II introns in rice.	 They also showed that disruption of AL2 results in the altered expression of chloroplast-associated genes, including chlorophyll biosynthetic genes, plastid-encoded polymerases and nuclear-encoded chloroplast genes
AL2	seedling death	Albino Leaf 2 is involved in the splicing of chloroplast group I and II introns in rice.	 Phenotypic analysis revealed that the al2 mutation caused obvious albino leaves at the early developmental stage, eventually leading to al2 seedling death
