AMD1|PWA1	DPW	Grass-specific ABERRANT MICROSPORE DEVELOPMENT 1 is required for maintaining pollen fertility in rice.	 Further biochemical assays indicate that AMD1 directly activates the transcription of DEFECTIVE POLLEN WALL (DPW) and POLYKETIDE SYNTHASE2 (OsPKS2), which are both implicated in sporopollenin biosynthesis during exine formation
AMD1|PWA1	OsPKS2	Grass-specific ABERRANT MICROSPORE DEVELOPMENT 1 is required for maintaining pollen fertility in rice.	 Further biochemical assays indicate that AMD1 directly activates the transcription of DEFECTIVE POLLEN WALL (DPW) and POLYKETIDE SYNTHASE2 (OsPKS2), which are both implicated in sporopollenin biosynthesis during exine formation
AMD1|PWA1	TDR	Grass-specific ABERRANT MICROSPORE DEVELOPMENT 1 is required for maintaining pollen fertility in rice.	 Additionally, AMD1 directly interacts with TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION (TDR), a key TF involved in the regulation of tapetum degradation and exine formation
AMD1|PWA1	DPW	POLLEN WALL ABORTION 1 is essential for pollen wall development in rice.	 In this study, we isolated and characterized the rice male-sterile mutant pollen wall abortion 1 (pwa1), which exhibits a defective pollen wall (DPW) structure and has sterile pollen
AMD1|PWA1	Os12BGlu38	POLLEN WALL ABORTION 1 is essential for pollen wall development in rice.	 Further studies suggested that PWA1 has transcriptional activation activity and participates in pollen intine development through the Î²-glucosidase Os12BGlu38
AMD1|PWA1	TIP2|bHLH142	POLLEN WALL ABORTION 1 is essential for pollen wall development in rice.	 PWA1 interacted with the transcription factor TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION (TDR)-INTERACTING PROTEIN2 (TIP2, also named bHLH142) in vivo and in vitro
