NA	Grass-specific ABERRANT MICROSPORE DEVELOPMENT 1 is required for maintaining pollen fertility in rice.	2022	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, 611130, China.	Pollen development includes a series of biological events that require precise gene regulation. Although several transcription factors (TFs) have been shown to play roles in maintaining pollen fertility, the major regulatory networks underlying tapetum development and pollen wall formation are largely unknown. Herein, we report that ABERRANT MICROSPORE DEVELOPMENT1 (AMD1), a protein annotated previously as unknown protein, is required for tapetum development and pollen exine patterning in rice (Oryza sativa L.). AMD1 encodes a grass-specific protein exhibiting transactivation activity in the nucleus and is spatiotemporally expressed in the tapetum and microspores during pollen development. Further biochemical assays indicate that AMD1 directly activates the transcription of DEFECTIVE POLLEN WALL (DPW) and POLYKETIDE SYNTHASE2 (OsPKS2), which are both implicated in sporopollenin biosynthesis during exine formation. Additionally, AMD1 directly interacts with TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION (TDR), a key TF involved in the regulation of tapetum degradation and exine formation. Taken together, we demonstrate that AMD1 is an important regulatory component involved in the TDR-mediated regulatory pathway to regulate sporopollenin biosynthesis, tapetum degradation, and exine formation for pollen development. Our work provides insights into the regulatory network of rice sexual reproduction and a useful target for genetic engineering of new male-sterile lines for hybrid rice breeding. AMD1, a protein annotated previously as unknown protein, may serve as a key regulatory component in rice pollen development.
NA	POLLEN WALL ABORTION 1 is essential for pollen wall development in rice.	2022	Plant Physiol	Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.	The integrity of pollen wall structures is essential for pollen development and maturity in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In this study, we isolated and characterized the rice male-sterile mutant pollen wall abortion 1 (pwa1), which exhibits a defective pollen wall (DPW) structure and has sterile pollen. Map-based cloning, genetic complementation, and gene knockout experiments revealed that PWA1 corresponds to the gene LOC_Os01g55094 encoding a coiled-coil domain-containing protein. PWA1 localized to the nucleus, and PWA1 was expressed in the tapetum and microspores. PWA1 interacted with the transcription factor TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION (TDR)-INTERACTING PROTEIN2 (TIP2, also named bHLH142) in vivo and in vitro. The tip2-1 mutant, which we obtained by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9-mediated gene editing, showed delayed tapetum degradation, sterile pollen, and DPWs. We determined that TIP2/bHLH142 regulates PWA1 expression by binding to its promoter. Analysis of the phenotype of the tip2-1 pwa1 double mutant indicated that TIP2/bHLH142 functions upstream of PWA1. Further studies suggested that PWA1 has transcriptional activation activity and participates in pollen intine development through the Î²-glucosidase Os12BGlu38. Therefore, we identified a sterility factor, PWA1, and uncovered a regulatory network underlying the formation of the pollen wall and mature pollen in rice.
