NA	Grass-specific ABERRANT MICROSPORE DEVELOPMENT 1 is required for maintaining pollen fertility in rice.	2022	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, 611130, China.	Pollen development includes a series of biological events that require precise gene regulation. Although several transcription factors (TFs) have been shown to play roles in maintaining pollen fertility, the major regulatory networks underlying tapetum development and pollen wall formation are largely unknown. Herein, we report that ABERRANT MICROSPORE DEVELOPMENT1 (AMD1), a protein annotated previously as unknown protein, is required for tapetum development and pollen exine patterning in rice (Oryza sativa L.). AMD1 encodes a grass-specific protein exhibiting transactivation activity in the nucleus and is spatiotemporally expressed in the tapetum and microspores during pollen development. Further biochemical assays indicate that AMD1 directly activates the transcription of DEFECTIVE POLLEN WALL (DPW) and POLYKETIDE SYNTHASE2 (OsPKS2), which are both implicated in sporopollenin biosynthesis during exine formation. Additionally, AMD1 directly interacts with TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION (TDR), a key TF involved in the regulation of tapetum degradation and exine formation. Taken together, we demonstrate that AMD1 is an important regulatory component involved in the TDR-mediated regulatory pathway to regulate sporopollenin biosynthesis, tapetum degradation, and exine formation for pollen development. Our work provides insights into the regulatory network of rice sexual reproduction and a useful target for genetic engineering of new male-sterile lines for hybrid rice breeding. AMD1, a protein annotated previously as unknown protein, may serve as a key regulatory component in rice pollen development.
