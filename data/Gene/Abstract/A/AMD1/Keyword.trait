AMD1|PWA1	development	Grass-specific ABERRANT MICROSPORE DEVELOPMENT 1 is required for maintaining pollen fertility in rice.	 AMD1 encodes a grass-specific protein exhibiting transactivation activity in the nucleus and is spatiotemporally expressed in the tapetum and microspores during pollen development
AMD1|PWA1	development	Grass-specific ABERRANT MICROSPORE DEVELOPMENT 1 is required for maintaining pollen fertility in rice.	 Taken together, we demonstrate that AMD1 is an important regulatory component involved in the TDR-mediated regulatory pathway to regulate sporopollenin biosynthesis, tapetum degradation, and exine formation for pollen development
AMD1|PWA1	pollen	Grass-specific ABERRANT MICROSPORE DEVELOPMENT 1 is required for maintaining pollen fertility in rice.
