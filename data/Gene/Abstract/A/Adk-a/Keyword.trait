Adk-a|OsAK3	temperature	Molecular characterization of cDNA encoding for adenylate kinase of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	In order to examine the enzyme activity of the protein encoded by the rice cDNA, Adk-a was cloned into an expression vector, pUC119, which was introduced into Escherichia coli strain CV2, a temperature-sensitive mutant of adenylate kinase
Adk-a|OsAK3	temperature	Molecular characterization of cDNA encoding for adenylate kinase of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	We found that the transformant carrying the rice Adk-a gene in the sense orientation recovered cell growth at non-permissive high temperature (42 degrees C) and expressed enzyme activities higher than the untransformed CV2 and the transformant possessing Adk-a cDNA in the antisense orientation
Adk-a|OsAK3	growth	Molecular characterization of cDNA encoding for adenylate kinase of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	We found that the transformant carrying the rice Adk-a gene in the sense orientation recovered cell growth at non-permissive high temperature (42 degrees C) and expressed enzyme activities higher than the untransformed CV2 and the transformant possessing Adk-a cDNA in the antisense orientation
Adk-a|OsAK3	adenylate kinase	Molecular characterization of cDNA encoding for adenylate kinase of rice (Oryza sativa L.) 	Two types of genes (Adk-a, and Adk-b) encoding for adenylate kinase (AK, EC 2.7.4.3.) were isolated from the cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of rice (Oryza sativa L.).
