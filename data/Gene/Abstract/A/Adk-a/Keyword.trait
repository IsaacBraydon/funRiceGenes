Adk-a	temperature	Molecular characterization of cDNA encoding for adenylate kinase of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 In order to examine the enzyme activity of the protein encoded by the rice cDNA, Adk-a was cloned into an expression vector, pUC119, which was introduced into Escherichia coli strain CV2, a temperature-sensitive mutant of adenylate kinase
Adk-a	temperature	Molecular characterization of cDNA encoding for adenylate kinase of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	We found that the transformant carrying the rice Adk-a gene in the sense orientation recovered cell growth at non-permissive high temperature (42 degrees C) and expressed enzyme activities higher than the untransformed CV2 and the transformant possessing Adk-a cDNA in the antisense orientation
