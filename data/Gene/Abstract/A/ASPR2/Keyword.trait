ASPR2|OsTPR2	zinc	Structural basis for recognition of diverse transcriptional repressors by the TOPLESS family of corepressors.	The OsTPR2 TPD adopts a new fold of nine helices, followed by a zinc finger, which are arranged into a disc-like tetramer
ASPR2|OsTPR2	growth	Serine protease NAL1 exerts pleiotropic functions through degradation of TOPLESS-related corepressor in rice.	 Moreover, we identified TOPLESS-related corepressor OsTPR2 involved in multiple growth and development processes as the substrate of NAL1
ASPR2|OsTPR2	development	Serine protease NAL1 exerts pleiotropic functions through degradation of TOPLESS-related corepressor in rice.	 Moreover, we identified TOPLESS-related corepressor OsTPR2 involved in multiple growth and development processes as the substrate of NAL1
