ASPR2|OsTPR2	NAL1|qFLW4|LVPA4	Serine protease NAL1 exerts pleiotropic functions through degradation of TOPLESS-related corepressor in rice.	 Moreover, we identified TOPLESS-related corepressor OsTPR2 involved in multiple growth and development processes as the substrate of NAL1
ASPR2|OsTPR2	NAL1|qFLW4|LVPA4	Serine protease NAL1 exerts pleiotropic functions through degradation of TOPLESS-related corepressor in rice.	 We found that NAL1 degraded OsTPR2, thus modulating the expression of downstream genes related to hormone signalling pathways, eventually achieving its pleiotropic physiological function
