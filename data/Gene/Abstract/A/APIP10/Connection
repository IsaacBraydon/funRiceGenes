APIP10	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	The E3 Ligase APIP10 Connects the Effector AvrPiz-t to the NLR Receptor Piz-t in Rice.	The E3 Ligase APIP10 Connects the Effector AvrPiz-t to the NLR Receptor Piz-t in Rice.
APIP10	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	The E3 Ligase APIP10 Connects the Effector AvrPiz-t to the NLR Receptor Piz-t in Rice.	Conversely, silencing of APIP10 in the Piz-t background causes cell death, significant accumulation of Piz-t, and enhanced resistance to M
APIP10	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	The E3 Ligase APIP10 Connects the Effector AvrPiz-t to the NLR Receptor Piz-t in Rice.	oryzae, suggesting that APIP10 is a negative regulator of Piz-t
APIP10	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	The E3 Ligase APIP10 Connects the Effector AvrPiz-t to the NLR Receptor Piz-t in Rice.	We show that APIP10 promotes degradation of Piz-t via the 26S proteasome system
APIP10	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	The E3 Ligase APIP10 Connects the Effector AvrPiz-t to the NLR Receptor Piz-t in Rice.	Together, our results show that APIP10 is a novel E3 ligase that functionally connects the fungal effector AvrPiz-t to its NLR receptor Piz-t in rice
APIP10	OsVOZ1	Two VOZ transcription factors link an E3 ligase and an NLR immune receptor to modulate immunity in rice.	 In this study, we found that APIP10 interacts with two rice transcription factors, VASCULAR PLANT ONE-ZINC FINGER 1 (OsVOZ1) and OsVOZ2, and promotes their degradation through the 26S proteasome pathway
