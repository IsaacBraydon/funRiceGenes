Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most aluminum (Al)-tolerant species among small-grain cereals. Recent identification of a transcription factor AL RESISTANCE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (ART1) revealed that this high Al tolerance in rice is achieved by multiple genes involved in detoxification of Al at different cellular levels. ART1 is a C2H2-type zinc-finger transcription factor and regulates the expression of 31 genes in the downstream. In this study, we attempted to identify a cis-acting element of ART1. We used the promoter region of SENSITIVE TO AL RHIZOTOXICITY1, an Al tolerance gene in the downstream of ART1. With the help of gel-shift assay, we were able to identify the cis-acting element as GGN(T/g/a/C)V(C/A/g)S(C/G). This element was found in the promoter region of 29 genes among 31 ART1-regulated genes. To confirm this cis-acting element in vivo, we transiently introduced this element one or five times tandemly repeated sequence with 35S minimal promoter and green fluorescent protein reporter together with or without ART1 gene in the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) mesophyll protoplasts. The results showed that the expression of green fluorescent protein reporter responded to ART1 expression. Furthermore, the expression increased with repetition of the cis-acting element. Our results indicate that the five nucleotides identified are the target DNA-binding sequence of ART1.

A number of plant species, including rice, secretes citrate from roots in response to Al stress. Here we characterized the functions of a gene, OsFRDL4 (Os01g0919100) that belongs to the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family in rice (Oryza sativa). Heterologous expression in Xenopus oocyte showed that the OsFRDL4 protein was able to transport citrate and was activated by Al. The expression level of the OsFRDL4 gene in roots was very low in the absence of Al, but was greatly enhanced by Al after short exposure. Furthermore, the OsFRDL4 expression was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor for Al tolerance. Transient expression of OsFRDL4 in onion epidermal cells showed that it localized to the plasma membrane. Immunostaining showed that OsFRDL4 was localized in all cells in the root tip. These expression patterns and cell specificity of localization of OsFRDL4 are different from other MATE members identified previously. Knockout of OsFRDL4 resulted in decreased Al tolerance and decreased citrate secretion compared with the wild-type rice, but did not affect citrate concentration in the xylem sap. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between OsFRDL4 expression level and the amount of citrate secretion in rice cultivars that are differing in Al tolerance. Taken together, our results show that OsFRDL4 is an Al-induced citrate transporter localized at the plasma membrane of rice root cells and is one of the components of high Al tolerance in rice.
Plant Cell-2009-Yamaji-3339-49.pdf	A zinc finger transcription factor ART1 regulates multiple genes implicated in aluminum tolerance in rice	2009	Plant Cell	Research Institute for Bioresources, Okayama University, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan.	Aluminum (Al) toxicity is the major limiting factor of crop production on acid soils, but some plant species have evolved ways of detoxifying Al. Here, we report a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor ART1 (for Al resistance transcription factor 1), which specifically regulates the expression of genes related to Al tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa). ART1 is constitutively expressed in the root, and the expression level is not affected by Al treatment. ART1 is localized in the nucleus of all root cells. A yeast one-hybrid assay showed that ART1 has a transcriptional activation potential and interacts with the promoter region of STAR1, an important factor in rice Al tolerance. Microarray analysis revealed 31 downstream transcripts regulated by ART1, including STAR1 and 2 and a couple of homologs of Al tolerance genes in other plants. Some of these genes were implicated in both internal and external detoxification of Al at different cellular levels. Our findings shed light on comprehensively understanding how plants detoxify aluminum to survive in an acidic environment.
pnas.201004949.pdf	Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Institute for Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan.	Aluminum (Al) is the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, but its trivalent ionic form is highly toxic to all organisms at low concentrations. How Al enters cells has not been elucidated in any organisms. Herein, we report a transporter, Nrat1 (Nramp aluminum transporter 1), specific for trivalent Al ion in rice. Nrat1 belongs to the Nramp (natural resistance-associated macrophage protein) family, but shares a low similarity with other Nramp members. When expressed in yeast, Nrat1 transports trivalent Al ion, but not other divalent ions, such as manganese, iron, and cadmium, or the Al-citrate complex. Nrat1 is localized at the plasma membranes of all cells of root tips except epidermal cells. Knockout of Nrat1 resulted in decreased Al uptake, increased Al binding to cell wall, and enhanced Al sensitivity, but did not affect the tolerance to other metals. Expression of Nrat1 is up-regulated by Al in the roots and regulated by a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor (ART1). We therefore concluded that Nrat1 is a plasma membrane-localized transporter for trivalent Al, which is required for a prior step of final Al detoxification through sequestration of Al into vacuoles.
