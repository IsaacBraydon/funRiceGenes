ART1	OsFRDL4	An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice	 Furthermore, the OsFRDL4 expression was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor for Al tolerance
ART1	STAR1	A zinc finger transcription factor ART1 regulates multiple genes implicated in aluminum tolerance in rice	 A yeast one-hybrid assay showed that ART1 has a transcriptional activation potential and interacts with the promoter region of STAR1, an important factor in rice Al tolerance| Microarray analysis revealed 31 downstream transcripts regulated by ART1, including STAR1 and 2 and a couple of homologs of Al tolerance genes in other plants
ART1	Nrat1	Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice	 Expression of Nrat1 is up-regulated by Al in the roots and regulated by a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor (ART1)
ART1	OsCDT3	A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance	A transcription factor for Al tolerance, ART1, regulates the expression of at least 30 genes in rice. Here we functionally characterized one of the downstream genes, OsCDT3, which encodes a predicted peptide of only 53 amino acid residues rich in cysteine.
