ART1	OsFRDL4	An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice	Furthermore, the OsFRDL4 expression was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor for Al tolerance
ART1	STAR1	A zinc finger transcription factor ART1 regulates multiple genes implicated in aluminum tolerance in rice	A yeast one-hybrid assay showed that ART1 has a transcriptional activation potential and interacts with the promoter region of STAR1, an important factor in rice Al tolerance
ART1	STAR1	A zinc finger transcription factor ART1 regulates multiple genes implicated in aluminum tolerance in rice	Microarray analysis revealed 31 downstream transcripts regulated by ART1, including STAR1 and 2 and a couple of homologs of Al tolerance genes in other plants
ART1	Nrat1	Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice	Expression of Nrat1 is up-regulated by Al in the roots and regulated by a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor (ART1)
ART1	OsCDT3	A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance	A transcription factor for Al tolerance, ART1, regulates the expression of at least 30 genes in rice. Here we functionally characterized one of the downstream genes, OsCDT3, which encodes a predicted peptide of only 53 amino acid residues rich in cysteine.
ART1	OsFRDL2	Functional analysis of a MATE gene OsFRDL2 revealed its involvement in Al-induced secretion of citrate, but less contribution to Al tolerance in rice.	Furthermore, the expression of OsFRDL2 was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type Zn-finger transcription factor for Al tolerance
ART1	OsEXPA10	An Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10 is involved in root cell elongation of rice.	Here, we functionally characterized an Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10, which is regulated by a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor, ART1 in rice
ART1	OsFRDL4	Retrotransposon-mediated aluminum tolerance through enhanced expression of the citrate transporter OsFRDL4.	2-kb insertion in the OsFRDL4 promoter region in japonica subspecies is responsible for their higher expression level of OsFRDL4 due to the increased number of cis-acting elements of ART1
