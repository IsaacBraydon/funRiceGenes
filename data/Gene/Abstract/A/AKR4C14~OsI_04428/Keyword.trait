AKR4C14|OsI_04428|OsAKR2	mature leaves	Cloning and characterization of AKR4C14, a rice aldo-keto reductase, from Thai Jasmine rice	Expression level of AKR4C14 normalized to the level of Actin-1. Green tissues (i.e. mature leaves, stems, and seedling leaves) have high expression levels. 
AKR4C14|OsI_04428|OsAKR2	stems	Cloning and characterization of AKR4C14, a rice aldo-keto reductase, from Thai Jasmine rice	Expression level of AKR4C14 normalized to the level of Actin-1. Green tissues (i.e. mature leaves, stems, and seedling leaves) have high expression levels. 
AKR4C14|OsI_04428|OsAKR2	seedling leaves	Cloning and characterization of AKR4C14, a rice aldo-keto reductase, from Thai Jasmine rice	Expression level of AKR4C14 normalized to the level of Actin-1. Green tissues (i.e. mature leaves, stems, and seedling leaves) have high expression levels.
