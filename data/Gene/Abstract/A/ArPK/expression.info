Symbol	Expression
ArPK	 ArPK expression was induced by a relatively longer exposure to high Al concentration in the roots |  The result of RNA-sequencing indicated the functional disorder in arginine metabolism pathway with downregulation of N-acetylornithine deacetylase (NAOD) expression and upregulation of Ornithine decarboxylase1 (ODC1) expression in arpk mutant |  Al specifically and rapidly upregulated ODC1 expression and causes overaccumulation of putrescine (Put), whereas the ODC inhibitor difluoromethylornithine reverted Al-sensitive phenotype of arpk, suggesting that overaccumulation of endogenous Put might be harmful for root growth, and that ArPK seems to act as an endogenous inhibitor of ODC1 action to maintain suitable endogenous Put level under Al treatment
