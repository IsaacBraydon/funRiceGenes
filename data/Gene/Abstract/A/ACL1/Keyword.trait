ACL1	leaf	Overexpression of ACL1 (abaxially curled leaf 1) increased Bulliform cells and induced Abaxial curling of leaf blades in rice	 The T-DNA was inserted in the promoter of a novel gene, ACL1 (Abaxially Curled Leaf 1), and led to overexpression of this gene in BY240| Overexpression of ACL1 in wild-type rice also resulted in abaxial leaf curling| Overexpression of ACL2, the only homolog of ACL1 in rice, also induced abaxial leaf curling|Overexpression of ACL1 (abaxially curled leaf 1) increased Bulliform cells and induced Abaxial curling of leaf blades in rice
