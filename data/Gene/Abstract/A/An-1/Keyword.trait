An-1	grains per panicle	An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice	The nearly-isogenic line (NIL-An-1) carrying a wild allele An-1 in the genetic background of the awnless indica Guangluai4 produces long awns and longer grains, but significantly fewer grains per panicle compared with Guangluai4
An-1	grain yield	An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice	Thus, we propose that awn loss was favored and strongly selected by humans, as genetic variations at the An-1 locus that cause awn loss would increase grain numbers and subsequently improve grain yield in cultivated rice
An-1	grain number	An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice	Transgenic studies confirmed that An-1 positively regulates awn elongation, but negatively regulates grain number per panicle
An-1	grain number	An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice	Thus, we propose that awn loss was favored and strongly selected by humans, as genetic variations at the An-1 locus that cause awn loss would increase grain numbers and subsequently improve grain yield in cultivated rice

An-1	 awn 	Natural alleles of GLA for grain length and awn development were differently domesticated in rice subspecies japonica and indica.	 Analyses of minimum spanning trees and introgression regions demonstrated that An-1, an important gene for awn formation, was preferentially domesticated, and its mutation to an-1 was followed by GLA and An-2
