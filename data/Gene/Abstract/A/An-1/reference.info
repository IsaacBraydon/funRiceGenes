3360.pdf	An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice	2013	Plant Cell	National Center for Gene Research, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China.	Long awns are important for seed dispersal in wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), but are absent in cultivated rice (Oryza sativa). The genetic mechanism involved in loss-of-awn in cultivated rice remains unknown. We report here the molecular cloning of a major quantitative trait locus, An-1, which regulates long awn formation in O. rufipogon. An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein, which regulates cell division. The nearly-isogenic line (NIL-An-1) carrying a wild allele An-1 in the genetic background of the awnless indica Guangluai4 produces long awns and longer grains, but significantly fewer grains per panicle compared with Guangluai4. Transgenic studies confirmed that An-1 positively regulates awn elongation, but negatively regulates grain number per panicle. Genetic variations in the An-1 locus were found to be associated with awn loss in cultivated rice. Population genetic analysis of wild and cultivated rice showed a significant reduction in nucleotide diversity of the An-1 locus in rice cultivars, suggesting that the An-1 locus was a major target for artificial selection. Thus, we propose that awn loss was favored and strongly selected by humans, as genetic variations at the An-1 locus that cause awn loss would increase grain numbers and subsequently improve grain yield in cultivated rice.
NA	Natural alleles of GLA for grain length and awn development were differently domesticated in rice subspecies japonica and indica.	2019	Plant Biotechnol J	Key Laboratory of Crop Heterosis and Utilization, Ministry of Education/Beijing Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Department of Plant Genetics and Breeding, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars harbor morphological and physiological traits different from those of wild rice (O. rufipogon Griff.), but the molecular mechanisms underlying domestication remain controversial. Here, we show that awn and long grain traits in the near-isogenic NIL-GLA are separately controlled by variations within the GLA (Grain Length and Awn Development) gene, a new allele of GAD1/RAE2, which encodes one member of the EFPL (epidermal patterning factor-like protein) family. Haplotype analyses and transgenic studies revealed that InDel1 (variation for grain length, VGL) in the promoter region of GLA (GLAVGL ) increases grain length by promoting transcription of GLA. Absence of InDel3 (variation for awn formation, VA) in the coding region (CDS) of GLA (GLAva ) results in short awn, or no awn, phenotypes. Analyses of minimum spanning trees and introgression regions demonstrated that An-1, an important gene for awn formation, was preferentially domesticated, and its mutation to an-1 was followed by GLA and An-2. Gene flow then occurred between the evolved japonica and indica populations. Quality analysis showed that GLA causes poor grain quality. During genetic improvement, awnlessness was selected in ssp. indica, whereas short grained and awnless phenotypes with good quality were selected in japonica. Our findings facilitate an understanding of rice domestication and provide a favorable allele for rice breeding. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
