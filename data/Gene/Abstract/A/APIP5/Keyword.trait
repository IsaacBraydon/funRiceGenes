APIP5|OsbZIP53	transcription factor	Immunity to Rice Blast Disease by Suppression of Effector-Triggered Necrosis.	<U+00A0>oryzae effector AvrPiz-t interacts with the bZIP-type transcription factor APIP5 in the cytoplasm and suppresses its transcriptional activity and protein accumulation at the necrotrophic stage
APIP5|OsbZIP53	cell death	Immunity to Rice Blast Disease by Suppression of Effector-Triggered Necrosis.	 Silencing of APIP5 in transgenic rice leads to cell death, and the<U+00A0>phenotype is enhanced by the expression of AvrPiz-t
APIP5|OsbZIP53	cytoplasm	Immunity to Rice Blast Disease by Suppression of Effector-Triggered Necrosis.	<U+00A0>oryzae effector AvrPiz-t interacts with the bZIP-type transcription factor APIP5 in the cytoplasm and suppresses its transcriptional activity and protein accumulation at the necrotrophic stage
