APIP5	transcription factor	Immunity to Rice Blast Disease by Suppression of Effector-Triggered Necrosis.	<U+00A0>oryzae effector AvrPiz-t interacts with the bZIP-type transcription factor APIP5 in the cytoplasm and suppresses its transcriptional activity and protein accumulation at the necrotrophic stage
APIP5	cell death	Immunity to Rice Blast Disease by Suppression of Effector-Triggered Necrosis.	 Silencing of APIP5 in transgenic rice leads to cell death, and the<U+00A0>phenotype is enhanced by the expression of AvrPiz-t
APIP5	cytoplasm	Immunity to Rice Blast Disease by Suppression of Effector-Triggered Necrosis.	<U+00A0>oryzae effector AvrPiz-t interacts with the bZIP-type transcription factor APIP5 in the cytoplasm and suppresses its transcriptional activity and protein accumulation at the necrotrophic stage
