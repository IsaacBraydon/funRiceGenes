ARF8	OsGH3-2|OsGH3.2	'Evidence of an auxin signal pathway, microRNA167-ARF8-GH3, and its response to exogenous auxin in cultured rice cells'	It was also shown that expression of OsGH3-2, an rice IAA-conjugating enzyme, was positively regulated by ARF8
ARF8	OsGH3-2|OsGH3.2	'Evidence of an auxin signal pathway, microRNA167-ARF8-GH3, and its response to exogenous auxin in cultured rice cells'	Delivery of synthesized miR167 into cells led to decrease of both ARF8 mRNA and OsGH3-2 mRNA
ARF8	OsGH3-2|OsGH3.2	'Evidence of an auxin signal pathway, microRNA167-ARF8-GH3, and its response to exogenous auxin in cultured rice cells'	This study provides an evidence in which the exogeneous auxin signal is transduced to OsGH3-2 through miR167 and ARF8 in sequence
ARF8	OsGH3-2|OsGH3.2	'Evidence of an auxin signal pathway, microRNA167-ARF8-GH3, and its response to exogenous auxin in cultured rice cells'	This proposed auxin signal transduction pathway, auxin-miR167-ARF8-OsGH3-2, could be, in conjunction with the other microRNA-mediated auxin signals, an important one for responding to exogeneous auxin and for determining the cellular free auxin level which guides appropriate auxin responses
ARF8	OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Osa-miR160a confers broad-spectrum resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens in rice.	 ARF8 protein binds directly to the promoter and suppresses the expression of WRKY45, which acts as a positive regulator of rice immunity
ARF8	OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Osa-miR160a confers broad-spectrum resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens in rice.	 Mutation of WRKY45 compromises the enhanced blast resistance and bacterial leaf blight resistance conferred by arf8 mutant
