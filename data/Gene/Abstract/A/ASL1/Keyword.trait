ASL1	chloroplast	Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality	Map-based cloning revealed that ASL1 encodes PRP S20 (PRPS20), which localizes to the chloroplast
ASL1	chloroplast	Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality	The transcript levels of nuclear genes for Chl biosynthesis and chloroplast development were strongly affected in asl1 mutants; transcripts of some plastid genes for photosynthesis were undetectable
ASL1	photosynthesis	Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality	The transcript levels of nuclear genes for Chl biosynthesis and chloroplast development were strongly affected in asl1 mutants; transcripts of some plastid genes for photosynthesis were undetectable
ASL1	seedling	Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality	This study identifies the first rice PRP mutant, asl1 (albino seedling lethality1), which exhibits an albino lethal phenotype at the seedling stage
ASL1	seedling	Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality	ASL1 showed tissue-specific expression, as it was highly expressed in plumule and young seedlings but expressed at much lower levels in other tissues
