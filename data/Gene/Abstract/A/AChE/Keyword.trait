AChE	seedlings	Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism.	This result clearly suggests that the function of the rice AChE relate to positive regulation of gravitropic response in rice seedlings
AChE	acetylcholinesterase	Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism	Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism
AChE	shoot gravitropism	Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism	Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism
AChE	gravitropic response	Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism	Finally, by comparing AChE up-regulated plants with wild-type, we found that AChE overexpression causes an enhanced gravitropic response.
