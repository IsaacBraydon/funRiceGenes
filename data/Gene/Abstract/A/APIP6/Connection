APIP6	OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	OsELF3-2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis ELF3, interacts with the E3 ligase APIP6 and negatively regulates immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice	OsELF3-2 interacts with APIP6 and negatively regulates basal resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae.
APIP12	APIP6	The Nup98 Homolog APIP12 Targeted by the Effector AvrPiz-t is Involved in Rice Basal Resistance Against Magnaporthe oryzae.	APIP12 significantly bound to AvrPiz-t and APIP6 in its middle portion and N-terminus, respectively, in yeast two-hybrid assay
APIP12	APIP6	The Nup98 Homolog APIP12 Targeted by the Effector AvrPiz-t is Involved in Rice Basal Resistance Against Magnaporthe oryzae.	Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay further verified the interactions of APIP12 with AvrPiz-t and APIP6
APIP6	OsUBC26	Rice ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme OsUBC26 is essential for immunity to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae	 Moreover, OsUBC26 working with APIP6 ubiquitinateds AvrPiz-t, an avirulence effector of M
APIP6	OsUBC26	Rice ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme OsUBC26 is essential for immunity to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae	 In summary, OsUBC26 plays important roles in rice disease resistance by regulating WRKY45 expression and working with E3 ligases such as APIP6 to counteract the effector protein AvrPiz-t from M
APIP6	UCIP2	Rice ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme OsUBC26 is essential for immunity to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae	 Yeast two-hybrid screening using UCIP2 as bait revealed that APIP6 is a binding partner of UCIP2
APIP6	OsCATC|noe1	Rice catalase OsCATC is degraded by E3 ligase APIP6 to negatively regulate immunity	Rice catalase OsCATC is degraded by E3 ligase APIP6 to negatively regulate immunity
