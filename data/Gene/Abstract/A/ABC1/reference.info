NA	Rice Ferredoxin-Dependent Glutamate Synthase Regulates Nitrogen-Carbon Metabolomes and Is Genetically Differentiated between japonica and indica Subspecies	2016	Molecular plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Plant Gene Research Center (Beijing), CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China	Plants assimilate inorganic nitrogen absorbed from soil into organic forms as Gln and Glu through the glutamine synthetase/glutamine:2-oxoglutarate amidotransferase (GS/GOGAT) cycle. Whereas GS catalyzes the formation of Gln from Glu and ammonia, GOGAT catalyzes the transfer of an amide group from Gln to 2-oxoglutarate to produce two molecules of Glu. However, the regulatory role of the GS/GOGAT cycle in the carbon-nitrogen balance is not well understood. Here, we report the functional characterization of the rice ABNORMAL CYTOKININ RESPONSE 1 (ABC1) gene that encodes an Fd-GOGAT. Whereas the weak mutant allele abc1-1 mutant shows a typical nitrogen-deficient syndrome, the T-DNA insertional mutant abc1-2 is seedling lethal. Metabolomics analysis revealed the accumulation of excessive amount of amino acids with high N/C ratio (Gln and Asn) and several intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle in abc1-1, suggesting that ABC1 plays a critical role in regulating nitrogen assimilation and carbon-nitrogen balance. Five non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in the ABC1 coding region and characterized as 3 distinct haplotypes, which have been highly and specifically differentiated between japonica and indica subspecies. These results suggest that ABC1/OsFd-GOGAT is essential for plant growth and development by modulating nitrogen assimilation and the carbon-nitrogen balance.
