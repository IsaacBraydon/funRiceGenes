NA	Rice Ferredoxin-Dependent Glutamate Synthase Regulates Nitrogen-Carbon Metabolomes and Is Genetically Differentiated between japonica and indica Subspecies	2016	Molecular plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Plant Gene Research Center (Beijing), CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China	Plants assimilate inorganic nitrogen absorbed from soil into organic forms as Gln and Glu through the glutamine synthetase/glutamine:2-oxoglutarate amidotransferase (GS/GOGAT) cycle. Whereas GS catalyzes the formation of Gln from Glu and ammonia, GOGAT catalyzes the transfer of an amide group from Gln to 2-oxoglutarate to produce two molecules of Glu. However, the regulatory role of the GS/GOGAT cycle in the carbon-nitrogen balance is not well understood. Here, we report the functional characterization of the rice ABNORMAL CYTOKININ RESPONSE 1 (ABC1) gene that encodes an Fd-GOGAT. Whereas the weak mutant allele abc1-1 mutant shows a typical nitrogen-deficient syndrome, the T-DNA insertional mutant abc1-2 is seedling lethal. Metabolomics analysis revealed the accumulation of excessive amount of amino acids with high N/C ratio (Gln and Asn) and several intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle in abc1-1, suggesting that ABC1 plays a critical role in regulating nitrogen assimilation and carbon-nitrogen balance. Five non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in the ABC1 coding region and characterized as 3 distinct haplotypes, which have been highly and specifically differentiated between japonica and indica subspecies. These results suggest that ABC1/OsFd-GOGAT is essential for plant growth and development by modulating nitrogen assimilation and the carbon-nitrogen balance.
NA	The ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase (OsFd-GOGAT) participates in leaf senescence and the nitrogen remobilization in rice.	2016	Mol Genet Genomics	Department of Agronomy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase (Fd-GOGAT, EC 1.4.7.1) plays major roles in photorespiration and primary nitrogen assimilation. However, due to no mutant or knockdown lines of OsFd-GOGAT have been reported in rice (Oryza sativa L.), the contribution of OsFd-GOGAT to rice foliar nitrogen metabolism remains little up-to-date. Here, we isolated a rice premature leaf senescence mutant named gogat1, which was reduced in 67% of the total GOGAT enzyme activity in leaves. The gogat1 mutant exhibited chlorosis under natural condition, while showed less extent premature leaf senescence under low light treatment. The gogat1 locus was mapped to a 54.1Â kb region on chromosome 7, and the sequencing of OsFd-GOGAT showed one substitution (A to T) at the 3017th nucleotide of the open reading frame, leading to the amino-acid substitution of leucine changed to histidine. The gogat1 mutant showed reduced seed setting rate, while the grain protein content in gogat1 mutant was significantly higher than that in wild type. Meanwhile, during the grain-filling stage, total amino acids in the up three leaves and the upmost internode were increased dramatically. The results in this study suggested that OsFd-GOGAT might participate in nitrogen remobilization during leaf senescence, which provides a potential way to improve nitrogen use efficiency in rice.
NA	Isolation and characterization of a spotted leaf 32 mutant with early leaf senescence and enhanced defense response in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Leaf senescence is a complex biological process and defense responses play vital role for rice development, their molecular mechanisms, however, remain elusive in rice. We herein reported a rice mutant spotted leaf 32 (spl32) derived from a rice cultivar 9311 by radiation. The spl32 plants displayed early leaf senescence, identified by disintegration of chloroplasts as cellular evidence, dramatically decreased contents of chlorophyll, up-regulation of superoxide dismutase enzyme activity and malondialdehyde, as physiological characteristic, and both up-regulation of senescence-induced STAY GREEN gene and senescence-associated transcription factors, and down-regulation of photosynthesis-associated genes, as molecular indicators. Positional cloning revealed that SPL32 encodes a ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase (Fd-GOGAT). Compared to wild type, enzyme activity of GOGAT was significantly decreased, and free amino acid contents, particularly for glutamate and glutamine, were altered in spl32 leaves. Moreover, the mutant was subjected to uncontrolled oxidative stress due to over-produced reactive oxygen species and damaged scavenging pathways, in accordance with decreased photorespiration rate. Besides, the mutant showed higher resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae than its wild type, coupled with up-regulation of four pathogenesis-related marker genes. Taken together, our results highlight Fd-GOGAT is associated with the regulation of leaf senescence and defense responses in rice.
NA	ES7, encoding a ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase, functions in nitrogen metabolism and impacts leaf senescence in rice	2017	Plant Science	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, China	Glutamate synthase (GOGAT) is a key enzyme for nitrogen metabolism and ammonium assimilation in plants. In this study, an early senescence 7 (es7) mutant was identified and characterized. The leaves of the es7 mutant begin to senesce at the tillering stage about 60 day after sowing, and become increasingly senescent as the plants develop at the heading stage. When es7 plants are grown under photorespiration-suppressed conditions (high CO2), the senescence phenotype and chlorophyll content are rescued. qRT-PCR analysis showed that senescence-  associated genes were up-regulated significantly in es7. A map-based cloning strategy was used to identify ES7, which encodes a ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase (Fd-GOGAT). ES7 was expressed constitutively, and the ES7 protein was localized in chloroplast. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that several genes related to nitrogen metabolism were differentially expressed in es7. Further, we also demonstrated that chlorophyll synthesis-associated genes were significantly down-regulated in es7. In addition, when seedlings are grown under increasing nitrogen concentrations (NH4NO3) for 15 days, the contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll were significantly lower in es7. Our results demonstrated that ES7 is involved in nitrogen metabolism, effects chlorophyll synthesis, and may also associated with photorespiration, impacting leaf senescence in rice.
NA	Nitrogen Mediates Flowering Time and Nitrogen Use Efficiency via Floral Regulators in Rice	2020	Curr Biol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	High nitrogen (N) fertilization for maximizing crop yield commonly leads to postponed flowering time (heading date in rice) and ripening, thus affecting resources use efficiency and followed planting time. We found that N-mediated heading date-1 (Nhd1) can directly activate florigen gene OsHd3a in rice. Inactivation of either Nhd1 or OsHd3a results in delay and insensitivity to N supply of flowering time. Knockout of Nhd1 increases N uptake and utilization efficiency at low-to-moderate N level under both short- and long-day field conditions. Increasing glutamine, the product of N assimilation, can upregulate expression of Nhd1, which in turn downregulates OsFd-GOGAT expression and OsFd-GOGAT activity, displaying a Nhd1-controlled negative feedback regulatory pathway of N assimilation. Moreover, N fertilization effect on rice flowering time shows genetically controlled diversity, and single-nucleotide polymorphism in Nhd1 promoter may relate to different responses of flowering time to N application. Nhd1 thus balances flowering time and N use efficiency in addition to photoperiod in rice.
