AlaAT	nitrogen	Molecular characterization of a gene for alanine aminotransferase from rice (Oryza sativa)	 These results suggest that AlaAT is involved in nitrogen metabolism during the maturation of rice seed
AlaAT	seed	Molecular characterization of a gene for alanine aminotransferase from rice (Oryza sativa)	A cDNA clone encoding alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) has isolated from randomly sequenced clones derived from a cDNA library of maturing rice seeds by comparison to previously identified genes| These results suggest that AlaAT is involved in nitrogen metabolism during the maturation of rice seed
