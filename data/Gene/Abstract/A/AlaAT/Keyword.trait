AlaAT|OsAlaAT1	nitrogen	Molecular characterization of a gene for alanine aminotransferase from rice (Oryza sativa)	 These results suggest that AlaAT is involved in nitrogen metabolism during the maturation of rice seed
AlaAT|OsAlaAT1	seed	Molecular characterization of a gene for alanine aminotransferase from rice (Oryza sativa)	A cDNA clone encoding alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) has isolated from randomly sequenced clones derived from a cDNA library of maturing rice seeds by comparison to previously identified genes
AlaAT|OsAlaAT1	seed	Molecular characterization of a gene for alanine aminotransferase from rice (Oryza sativa)	 These results suggest that AlaAT is involved in nitrogen metabolism during the maturation of rice seed
AlaAT|OsAlaAT1	starch	Alanine aminotransferase 1 (OsAlaAT1) plays an essential role in the regulation of starch storage in rice endosperm.	 OsAlaAT1 is predominantly expressed in developing seeds during active starch synthesis
AlaAT|OsAlaAT1	starch	Alanine aminotransferase 1 (OsAlaAT1) plays an essential role in the regulation of starch storage in rice endosperm.	 Thus, our observations suggest that OsAlaAT1 plays an essential role in starch synthesis in developing seeds that are exposed to low concentrations of oxygen
