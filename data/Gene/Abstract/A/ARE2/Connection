ABC1|OsFd-GOGAT|SPL32|ES7	ARE2	Regulation of nitrogen starvation responses by the alarmone (p)ppGpp in rice.	 Here, we show that ARE2 (for ABC1 REPRESSOR2) is a key regulator of nitrogen starvation responses in rice
ABC1|OsFd-GOGAT|SPL32|ES7	ARE2	Regulation of nitrogen starvation responses by the alarmone (p)ppGpp in rice.	 The are2 mutations partially rescue the nitrogen-deficient phenotype of abc1 and the are2 mutants show enhanced tolerance to nitrogen deficiency, suggesting that ARE2 genetically interacts with ABC1/Fd-GOGAT
