Fujii-2007-Retrograde regulatio.pdf	Retrograde regulation of nuclear gene expression in CW-CMS of rice	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Laboratory of Environmental Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, 1-1 Tsutumidori-Amamiyamachi, Aoba-ku, Sendai 981-8555, Japan.	The CW-cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) line has the cytoplasm of Oryza rufipogon Griff, and mature pollen is morphologically normal under an optical microscope but lacks the ability to germinate; restorer gene Rf17 has been identified as restoring this ability. The difference between nuclear gene expression in mature anthers was compared for the CW-CMS line, [cms-CW] rf17rf17, and a maintainer line with normal cytoplasm of Oryza sativa L., [normal] rf17rf17. Using a 22-k rice oligoarray we detected 58 genes that were up-regulated more than threefold in the CW-CMS line. Expression in other organs was further investigated for 20 genes using RT-PCR. Five genes, including genes for alternative oxidase, were found to be preferentially expressed in [cms-CW] rf17rf17 but not in [normal] rf17rf17 or [cms-CW] Rf17Rf17. Such [cms-CW] rf17rf17-specific gene expression was only observed in mature anthers but not in leaves, stems, or roots, indicating the presence of anther-specific mitochondrial retrograde regulation of nuclear gene expression, and that Rf17 has a role in restoring the ectopic gene expression. We also used a proteomic approach to discover the retrograde regulated proteins and identified six proteins that were accumulated differently. These results reveal organ-specific induced mitochondrial retrograde pathways affecting nuclear gene expression possibly related to CMS.
Li-2013-Unravelling mitochon.pdf	Unravelling mitochondrial retrograde regulation in the abiotic stress induction of rice ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE 1 genes	2013	Plant Cell Environ	Institute of Rice Research, Anhui Academy of Agricultural Science, Hefei 230031, China.	Mitochondrial retrograde regulation (MRR) is the transduction of mitochondrial signals to mediate nuclear gene expression. It is not clear whether MRR is a common regulation mechanism in plant abiotic stress response. In this study, we analysed the early abiotic stress response of the rice OsAOX1 genes, and the induction of OsAOX1a and OsAOX1b (OsAOX1a/b) was selected as a working model for the stress-induced MRR studies. We found that the induction mediated by the superoxide ion (O2.(-) )-generating chemical methyl viologen was stronger than that of hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ). The addition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers demonstrated that the stress induction was reduced by eliminating O2.(-) . Furthermore, the stress induction did not rely on chloroplast- or cytosol-derived O2.(-) . Next, we generated transgenic plants overexpressing the superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene at different subcellular locations. The results suggest that only the mitochondrial SOD, OsMSD, attenuated the stress induction of OsAOX1a/b specifically. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that abiotic stress initiates the MRR on OsAOX1a/b and that mitochondrial O2.(-) is involved in the process.
Saika-2002-AOX1c, a novel rice.pdf	AOX1c, a novel rice gene for alternative oxidase; comparison with rice AOX1a and AOX1b	2002	Genes Genet Syst	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Japan.	A novel gene for alternative oxidase (AOX) was isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) and characterized. The deduced amino acid sequence of the novel AOX gene contains features that are conserved among other AOXs. This AOX gene was designated AOX1c based on a phylogenetic analysis of the AOX genes. Northern hybridization analyses revealed that AOX1c and AOX1a/AOX1b transcripts accumulated differently in various rice organs and rice seedlings under low temperature conditions. AOX1c mRNA was mainly present in young leaves under constant light, mature leaves and panicles after heading, but it was not detected in young etiolated leaves and young roots of seedlings or young panicles. On the other hand, the mRNAs of the rice AOX1a and AOX1b genes were mainly present in young roots and mature leaves. Under low temperature conditions, the steady-state mRNA levels of the rice AOX1a and AOX1b genes clearly increased with time but the rice AOX1c gene was apparently not responsive to low temperature. The rice AOX gene family and differences in their regulation are discussed.
NA	OsPPR939, a nad5 splicing factor, is essential for plant growth and pollen development in rice	2021	Theor Appl Genet	Institute of Crop Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	P-subfamily PPR protein OsPPR939, which can be phosphorylated by OsS6K1, regulates plant growth and pollen development by involving in the splicing of mitochondrial nad5 introns 1, 2, and 3. In land plants, pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins play key roles in mitochondrial group II intron splicing, but how these nucleus-encoded proteins are imported into mitochondria is unknown. To date, a few PPR proteins have been characterized in rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we demonstrate that the mitochondrion-localized P-subfamily PPR protein OsPPR939 is required for the splicing of nad5 introns 1, 2, and 3 in rice. Complete knockout or partial disruption of OsPPR939 function resulted in different degrees of growth retardation and pollen sterility. The dramatically reduced splicing efficiency of these introns in osppr939-4 and osppr939-5 led to reduced mitochondrial complex I abundance and activity and enhanced expression of alternative respiratory pathway genes. Complementation with OsPPR939 rescued the defective plant morphology of osppr939-4 and restored its decreased splicing efficiency of nad5 introns 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, OsPPR939 plays crucial roles in plant growth and pollen development by splicing mitochondrial nad5 introns 1, 2, and 3. More importantly, the 12th amino acid Ser in the N-terminal targeting sequence of OsPPR939 is phosphorylated by OsS6K1, and truncated OsPPR939 with a non-phosphorylatable S12A mutation in its presequence could not be imported into mitochondria, suggesting that phosphorylation of this amino acid plays an important role in the mitochondrial import of OsPPR939. To our knowledge, the 12th residue Ser on OsPPR939 is the first experimentally proven phosphorylation site in PPR proteins. Our results provide a basis for investigating the regulatory mechanism of PPR proteins at the post-translational level.
