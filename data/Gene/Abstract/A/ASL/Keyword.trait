ASL	nitrogen	Plastid-localized amino acid metabolism coordinates rice ammonium tolerance and nitrogen use efficiency.	 Finally, we show that ASL expression positively correlates with root ammonium tolerance and that nitrogen use efficiency and yield can be improved through a gain-of-function approach
ASL	root	Plastid-localized amino acid metabolism coordinates rice ammonium tolerance and nitrogen use efficiency.	 ASL alleviates ammonium-inhibited root elongation by converting the excessive glutamine to arginine
ASL	root	Plastid-localized amino acid metabolism coordinates rice ammonium tolerance and nitrogen use efficiency.	 Furthermore, we identified natural variation in the ASL allele between japonica and indica subspecies explaining their different root sensitivity towards ammonium
