AET1	temperature	Translational Regulation of Plant Response to High Temperature by a Dual Function tRNAHis Guanylyltransferase in Rice.	 Furthermore, polysome profiling assays suggest that the translational status remains unaffected in the aet1 mutant, but that the translational efficiency of OsARF19 and OsARF23 is reduced; moreover, the OsARF23 protein levels are obviously decreased in the aet1 mutant under high temperature, implying that AET1 regulates auxin signaling in response to high temperature
AET1	temperature	Translational Regulation of Plant Response to High Temperature by a Dual Function tRNAHis Guanylyltransferase in Rice.	 Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that AET1 plays a dual function in tRNA modification and translational control involved in the regulation of the environmental temperature response in rice
AET1	auxin	Translational Regulation of Plant Response to High Temperature by a Dual Function tRNAHis Guanylyltransferase in Rice.	 Furthermore, polysome profiling assays suggest that the translational status remains unaffected in the aet1 mutant, but that the translational efficiency of OsARF19 and OsARF23 is reduced; moreover, the OsARF23 protein levels are obviously decreased in the aet1 mutant under high temperature, implying that AET1 regulates auxin signaling in response to high temperature
