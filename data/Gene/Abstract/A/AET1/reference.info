Plants are sessile organisms, and have thus evolved numerous strategies to acclimate to changes in environmental temperature. There is emerging evidence to describe the molecular basis of this acclimation. In this study, we identified a tRNAHis guanylyltransferase, AET1, that contributes to the modification of pre-tRNAHis and is required for normal growth under high temperature conditions in rice. Interestingly, AET1 possibly interacts with both RACK1A and eIF3h in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum). Notably, AET1 can directly bind to the OsARF mRNAs including the uORFs of OsARF19 and OsARF23, indicating that AET1 is associated with translation regulation. Furthermore, polysome profiling assays suggest that the translational status remains unaffected in the aet1 mutant, but that the translational efficiency of OsARF19 and OsARF23 is reduced; moreover, the OsARF23 protein levels are obviously decreased in the aet1 mutant under high temperature, implying that AET1 regulates auxin signaling in response to high temperature. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that AET1 plays a dual function in tRNA modification and translational control involved in the regulation of the environmental temperature response in rice.
