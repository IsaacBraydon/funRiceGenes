APIP12	 The expression of some pathogenesis-related (PR) genes was reduced in both knockout and knockdown mutants, suggesting that APIP12 is required for the accumulation of transcripts of PR genes upon the infection |  It is worth noting that neither knockout/knockdown nor overexpression of APIP12 attenuates Piz-t resistance	 It is worth noting that neither knockout/knockdown nor overexpression of APIP12 attenuates Piz-t resistance
