Kawai-1992-Molecular characteri.pdf	Molecular characterization of cDNA encoding for adenylate kinase of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	1992	Plant J	Institute of Applied Microbiology, University of Tokyo, Japan.	Two types of genes (Adk-a, and Adk-b) encoding for adenylate kinase (AK, EC 2.7.4.3.) were isolated from the cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Two cDNAs were heterogeneous at 5' and 3' ends of non-coding sequences and had possible polyadenylation signals. One of the genes, Adk-a, had 1154 bp sequences encoding 241 amino acid residues, while the other type, Adk-b, contained 1085 bp sequences encoding for 243 amino acid residues. Homology between Adk-a and Adk-b was 73.7% in nucleotide sequences, and 90.8% in amino acid level. Two genes showed about 53% homology to bovine mitochondrial adenylate kinase (AK2) at nucleotide and amino acid levels. Concerning the codon usage of rice AK genes, T was abundant at the third position of a codon in the reading frames. In order to examine the enzyme activity of the protein encoded by the rice cDNA, Adk-a was cloned into an expression vector, pUC119, which was introduced into Escherichia coli strain CV2, a temperature-sensitive mutant of adenylate kinase. We found that the transformant carrying the rice Adk-a gene in the sense orientation recovered cell growth at non-permissive high temperature (42 degrees C) and expressed enzyme activities higher than the untransformed CV2 and the transformant possessing Adk-a cDNA in the antisense orientation. These observations suggest that rice Adk-a codes a biologically active enzyme. Furthermore, sucrose was found to regulate the transcription of AK genes in rice cell cultures. Organ related accumulation of mRNA in whole plants was also found.
NA	An Adenylate Kinase OsAK3 Involves Brassinosteroid Signaling and Grain Length in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2021	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	BACKGROUND: Grain size is one of the major determinants of cereal crop yield. As a class of plant polyhydroxysteroids, brassinosteroids (BRs) play essential roles in the regulation of grain size and plant architecture in rice. In a previous research, we cloned qGL3/OsPPKL1 encoding a protein phosphatase with Kelch-like repeat domains, which negatively regulates BR signaling and grain length in rice. RESULTS: Here, we screened qGL3-interacting proteins (GIPs) via yeast two-hybrid assay and analyzed the phenotypes of the T-DNA insertion mutants of GIPs. Among these mutants, mutant osak3 presents shorter grain length and dwarfing phenotype. OsAK3 encodes an adenylate kinase, which regulates grain size by controlling cell expansion of rice spikelet glume. Overexpression of OsAK3 resulted in longer grain length. OsAK3 interacts with qGL3 in vivo and in vitro. Lamina inclination, coleoptile elongation and root inhibition experiments showed that the osak3 mutant was less sensitive to exogenous brassinolide (BL) treatment. The transcriptional level of OsAK3 was up-regulated under BL induction. In addition, RNA-Seq data indicate that OsAK3 is involved in a variety of biological processes that regulate BR signaling and grain development in rice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a novel BR signaling component OsAK3 in the regulation of grain length, and provides novel clues for uncovering the potential functions of OsAK3 in rice growth and development.
