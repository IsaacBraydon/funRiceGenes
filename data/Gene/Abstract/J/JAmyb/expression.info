JAmyb|OsJAmyb	 The expression of OsJAMyb gene was detected in the root, stem, leaf, sheath, immature panicle and flowering panicle of rice, with highest expression in the leaf |  After inoculation with the blast isolate Hoku1, the expression of OsJAMyb was more rapidly and strongly induced in the seedlings of blast-resistant Heikezijing compared with that in the blast-susceptible landrace Suyunuo
JAmyb|OsJAmyb|OsMYB21	Genome-Wide Association Mapping and Gene Expression Analysis Reveal the Negative Role of OsMYB21 in Regulating Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice |  Through combined analysis of differential expression and annotations of the predicted genes within qBBR11-4 between two sets of rice accessions selected based on haplotypes and disease phenotypes, we identified the transcription factor OsMYB21 as the candidate gene for qBBR11-4
