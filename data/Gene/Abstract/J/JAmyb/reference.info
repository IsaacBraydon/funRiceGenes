Plants have developed certain adaptive responses to environmental stresses that cause adverse effects on growth. To identify genes involved in the adaptive mechanisms, we constructed a large population of transgenic Arabidopsis expressing rice full-length cDNAs, and performed gain-of-function screening under high-salinity stress. In this study, we identified a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor gene, JAmyb, as a gene whose overexpression causes tolerance to high salinity. JAmyb overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis improved tolerance to high-salinity stress during seed germination, seedling growth, and root elongation. In rice seedlings, JAmyb expression was induced by high-salinity and high-osmotic stresses and reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that JAmyb is responsible for abiotic stress response. Microarray analysis showed that the overexpression of JAmyb stimulates the expression of several defense-associated genes, some of which have been predicted to be involved in osmotic adjustment, ROS removal, and ion homeostasis. Several transcription factors involved in the jasmonate (JA)-mediated stress response are also regulated by JAmyb. JAmyb has been reported to be associated with disease response. Our observations suggest that JAmyb plays a role in JA-mediated abiotic stress response in addition to biotic stress response in rice.
NA	OsJAMyb, a R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, enhanced blast resistance in transgenic rice	2015	Physiological and Molecular Plant Pathology	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China	MYB transcription factors have various regulatory roles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. In this study we identified one MYB transcription factor gene OsJAMyb from rice landrace Heikezijing, which encodes a protein with 283 amino-acid residues belonging to R2R3-type MYB transcription factor family. The expression of OsJAMyb gene was detected in the root, stem, leaf, sheath, immature panicle and flowering panicle of rice, with highest expression in the leaf. After inoculation with the blast isolate Hoku1, the expression of OsJAMyb was more rapidly and strongly induced in the seedlings of blast-resistant Heikezijing compared with that in the blast-susceptible landrace Suyunuo. The OsJAMyb overexpressing transgenic lines (T3 generation) in Suyunuo showed increased resistance to blast infection with less lesion number in inoculated leaves compared with non-transgenic control plants. The results indicate that OsJAMyb might be involved in the resistance to blast infection in rice.
