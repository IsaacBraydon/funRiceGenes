Plants have developed certain adaptive responses to environmental stresses that cause adverse effects on growth. To identify genes involved in the adaptive mechanisms, we constructed a large population of transgenic Arabidopsis expressing rice full-length cDNAs, and performed gain-of-function screening under high-salinity stress. In this study, we identified a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor gene, JAmyb, as a gene whose overexpression causes tolerance to high salinity. JAmyb overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis improved tolerance to high-salinity stress during seed germination, seedling growth, and root elongation. In rice seedlings, JAmyb expression was induced by high-salinity and high-osmotic stresses and reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that JAmyb is responsible for abiotic stress response. Microarray analysis showed that the overexpression of JAmyb stimulates the expression of several defense-associated genes, some of which have been predicted to be involved in osmotic adjustment, ROS removal, and ion homeostasis. Several transcription factors involved in the jasmonate (JA)-mediated stress response are also regulated by JAmyb. JAmyb has been reported to be associated with disease response. Our observations suggest that JAmyb plays a role in JA-mediated abiotic stress response in addition to biotic stress response in rice.
