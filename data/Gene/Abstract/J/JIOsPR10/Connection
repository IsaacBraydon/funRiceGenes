JIOsPR10|OsPR10	OsPAL	Endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris B3 induces rice resistance to RSRD caused by Fusarium proliferatum and promotes plant growth	 This was related to enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, and to significantly upregulated expression levels of OsAOX, OsLOX, OsPAL, and OsPR10 in rice
JIOsPR10|OsPR10	OsHBP1b|OsTGA5	Phosphorylation of OsTGA5 by casein kinase II compromises its suppression of defense-related gene transcription in rice.	 Importantly, we showed that the nucleus-localized casein kinase II (CK2) complex interacts with and phosphorylates OsTGA5 on Ser-32, which reduces the affinity of OsTGA5 for the JIOsPR10 promoter, thereby alleviating the repression of JIOsPR10 transcription and increasing rice resistance
