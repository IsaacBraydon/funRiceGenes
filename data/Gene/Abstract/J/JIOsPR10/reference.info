1-s2.0-S0006291X0195507X-main.pdf	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel Jasmonate inducible pathogenesis-related class 10 protein gene, JIOsPR10, from rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedling leaves	2001	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Department of Molecular Biology, Sejong University, Seoul, 143-747, Korea.	A novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene, homologous to a sorghum pathogenesis-related class 10 protein gene, was cloned from a cDNA library prepared from 2-week-old jasmonic acid-treated rice seedling leaves, and named as JIOsPR10 (jasmonate inducible). JIOsPR10 encoded a 160-amino-acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 17,173.23 Da and a pI of 5.84. JIOsPR10 was highly similar (77%) to the sorghum PR10 protein, but showed less than 55% similarity with other identified PR10s at the amino acid level. Genomic Southern analyses indicated the presence of related genes in the rice genome. The JIOsPR10 transcript was not detected in the healthy leaves, and was not induced after cut. Further expression analysis revealed that the signaling components of defense/stress pathways, jasmonate, salicylate, and H(2)O(2) significantly up-regulated the JIOsPR10 mRNA over the cut control, whereas two other stress regulators, ethylene and abscisic acid, failed to induce its expression. Interestingly the protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitors, cantharidin, endothall, and okadaic acid, rapidly and potently up-regulated the JIOsPR10 expression, suggesting involvement of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events. Additionally, the inducible expression of the JIOsPR10 gene was influenced by light signal(s). Finally, the blast pathogen (Magnaporthe grisea) also specifically elicited the accumulation of JIOsPR10 mRNA in leaves. Induction of the JIOsPR10 gene expression by signaling molecules, PP inhibitors and pathogen attack, strongly indicate a role for this novel gene in rice self-defense/stress response(s).
10.1007-s00299-007-0485-6.pdf	The rice pathogen-related protein 10 (JIOsPR10) is induced by abiotic and biotic stresses and exhibits ribonuclease activity	2008	Plant Cell Rep	Environmental Biotechnology National Core Research Center, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Korea.	We previously reported that rice blast fungus or jasmonic acid induced the expression of rice pathogenesis-related class 10 (JIOsPR10) proteins (Kim et al. 2003, 2004). However, no further studies have been carried out to examine the expression, localization, and enzymatic activity of this protein in either developmental tissues or in tissues under abiotic stress conditions. In this study, rice JIOsPR10 was examined by Western blot analysis, immunolocalization, and biochemical assays. Western blots revealed that the JIOsPR10 protein was expressed in developmental tissues, including in flower and root. The protein was also expressed under abiotic stresses, such as occurs during senescence and wounding. Using immunohistochemical techniques, we determined that expression of JIOsPR10 was localized to the palea of flower, in the exodermis, and inner part of the endodermis of the root. In senescencing tissues of leaf and coleoptiles, its expression was localized in vascular bundles. The RNase activity using JIOsPR10 recombinant protein was determined and abolished after treatment with DTT in a native in-gel assay. To test this, we created JIOsPR10 mutant proteins containing serine substitutions of amino acids C81S, C83S, or both and examined their RNase activities. The activity of the C83S mutant was decreased in the agarose gel assay compared to the wild type. Taken together, we hypothesize that the JIOsPR10 protein possesses RNase activity that is sensitive to DTT, suggesting the importance of the disulfide bonding between cysteine residues and that it might play a role in constitutive self-defense mechanisms in plants against biotic and abiotic stresses.
NA	Overexpression of a Pathogenesis-Related Protein 10 Enhances Biotic and Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Rice.	2016	Plant Pathol J	Department of Plant Microbe Interactions, Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Cologne 50829, Germany; Division of Applied Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.	Pathogenesis-related proteins play multiple roles in plant development and biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. Here, we characterize a rice defense related gene named &quot;jasmonic acid inducible pathogenesis-related class 10&quot; (JIOsPR10) to gain an insight into its functional properties. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed up-regulation of JIOsPR10 under salt and drought stress conditions. Constitutive over-expression JIOsPR10 in rice promoted shoot and root development in transgenic plants, however, their productivity was unaltered. Further experiments exhibited that the transgenic plants showed reduced susceptibility to rice blast fungus, and enhanced salt and drought stress tolerance as compared to the wild type. A comparative proteomic profiling of wild type and transgenic plants showed that overexpression of JIOsPR10 led to the differential modulation of several proteins mainly related with oxidative stresses, carbohydrate metabolism, and plant defense. Taken together, our findings suggest that JIOsPR10 plays important roles in biotic and abiotic stresses tolerance probably by activation of stress related proteins.
NA	Magnaporthe oryzae systemic defense trigger 1 (MoSDT1)-mediated metabolites regulate defense response in Rice	2021	BMC Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China.	Background: Some of the pathogenic effector proteins play an active role in stimulating the plant defense system to strengthen plant resistance.  Results: In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS) was implemented to identify altered metabolites in transgenic rice containing over-expressed M. oryzae Systemic Defense Trigger 1 (MoSDT1) that was infected at three-time points. The characterized dominating metabolites were organic acids and their derivatives, organic oxygen compounds, lipids, and lipid-like molecules. Among the identified metabolites, shikimate, galactinol, trehalose, D-mannose, linolenic acid, dopamine, tyramine, and L-glutamine are precursors for the synthesis of many secondary defense metabolites Carbohydrate, as well as amino acid metabolic, pathways were revealed to be involved in plant defense responses and resistance strengthening.  Conclusion: The increasing salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) content enhanced interactions between JA synthesis/signaling gene, SA synthesis/receptor gene, raffinose/fructose/sucrose synthase gene, and cell wall-related genes all contribute to defense response in rice. The symptoms of rice after M. oryzae infection were significantly alleviated when treated with six identified metabolites, i.e., galactol, tyramine, L-glutamine, L-tryptophan, ¦Á-terpinene, and dopamine for 72 h exogenously. Therefore, these metabolites could be utilized as an optimal metabolic marker for M. oryzae defense.
NA	Endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris B3 induces rice resistance to RSRD caused by Fusarium proliferatum and promotes plant growth	2020	J Sci Food Agric	Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Microbes and Functional Genomics, Jiangsu Engineering and Technology Research Center for Industrialization of Microbial Resources, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China.	Background: Rice spikelet rot disease (RSRD) is an emerging disease that significantly reduces rice yield and quality. In this study, we evaluated the potential use of the broad-spectrum endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris B3 as a biocontrol agent against RSRD. We also compared the control effects of different treatments, including chemical fungicides and treatment with multiple strains and single strains in combination or individually, against RSRD. The objective of this study was to find an effective and environmentally friendly control strategy to reduce the occurrence of RSRD and improve the rice yield.  Results: In pot experiments, the effect of B3 alone was better than that of fungicide or combined measures. The results showed that root colonization by B3 significantly reduced the incidence and disease index of RSRD by 41.0% and 53.8%, respectively. This was related to enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, and to significantly upregulated expression levels of OsAOX, OsLOX, OsPAL, and OsPR10 in rice. Moreover, B3 improved the diversity of the bacterial community rather than the fungal community in the rice rhizosphere. It also led to a decrease in Fusarium proliferatum colonization and fumonisin content in the grain. Finally, root development was markedly promoted after B3 inoculation, and the yield improved by 48.60%. The result of field experiments showed that the incidence of RSRD and the fumonisin content were observably reduced in rice receiving B3, by 24.41% and 37.87%, respectively.  Conclusion: The endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris B3 may become an effective tool to relieve rice spikelet rot disease.
