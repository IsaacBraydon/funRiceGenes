1-s2.0-S0006291X0195507X-main.pdf	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel Jasmonate inducible pathogenesis-related class 10 protein gene, JIOsPR10, from rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedling leaves	2001	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Department of Molecular Biology, Sejong University, Seoul, 143-747, Korea.	A novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene, homologous to a sorghum pathogenesis-related class 10 protein gene, was cloned from a cDNA library prepared from 2-week-old jasmonic acid-treated rice seedling leaves, and named as JIOsPR10 (jasmonate inducible). JIOsPR10 encoded a 160-amino-acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 17,173.23 Da and a pI of 5.84. JIOsPR10 was highly similar (77%) to the sorghum PR10 protein, but showed less than 55% similarity with other identified PR10s at the amino acid level. Genomic Southern analyses indicated the presence of related genes in the rice genome. The JIOsPR10 transcript was not detected in the healthy leaves, and was not induced after cut. Further expression analysis revealed that the signaling components of defense/stress pathways, jasmonate, salicylate, and H(2)O(2) significantly up-regulated the JIOsPR10 mRNA over the cut control, whereas two other stress regulators, ethylene and abscisic acid, failed to induce its expression. Interestingly the protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitors, cantharidin, endothall, and okadaic acid, rapidly and potently up-regulated the JIOsPR10 expression, suggesting involvement of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events. Additionally, the inducible expression of the JIOsPR10 gene was influenced by light signal(s). Finally, the blast pathogen (Magnaporthe grisea) also specifically elicited the accumulation of JIOsPR10 mRNA in leaves. Induction of the JIOsPR10 gene expression by signaling molecules, PP inhibitors and pathogen attack, strongly indicate a role for this novel gene in rice self-defense/stress response(s).

We previously reported that rice blast fungus or jasmonic acid induced the expression of rice pathogenesis-related class 10 (JIOsPR10) proteins (Kim et al. 2003, 2004). However, no further studies have been carried out to examine the expression, localization, and enzymatic activity of this protein in either developmental tissues or in tissues under abiotic stress conditions. In this study, rice JIOsPR10 was examined by Western blot analysis, immunolocalization, and biochemical assays. Western blots revealed that the JIOsPR10 protein was expressed in developmental tissues, including in flower and root. The protein was also expressed under abiotic stresses, such as occurs during senescence and wounding. Using immunohistochemical techniques, we determined that expression of JIOsPR10 was localized to the palea of flower, in the exodermis, and inner part of the endodermis of the root. In senescencing tissues of leaf and coleoptiles, its expression was localized in vascular bundles. The RNase activity using JIOsPR10 recombinant protein was determined and abolished after treatment with DTT in a native in-gel assay. To test this, we created JIOsPR10 mutant proteins containing serine substitutions of amino acids C81S, C83S, or both and examined their RNase activities. The activity of the C83S mutant was decreased in the agarose gel assay compared to the wild type. Taken together, we hypothesize that the JIOsPR10 protein possesses RNase activity that is sensitive to DTT, suggesting the importance of the disulfide bonding between cysteine residues and that it might play a role in constitutive self-defense mechanisms in plants against biotic and abiotic stresses.
