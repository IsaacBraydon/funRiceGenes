JMJ704	JMJ705	JMJ704 positively regulates rice defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae infection via reducing H3K4me2/3 associated with negative disease resistance regulators.	JMJ704 positively regulates rice defense by epigenetically suppressing master negative defense regulators, presenting a novel mechanism distinct from its homolog JMJ705 which also positively regulates rice defense but via activating positive defense regulators
JMJ705	WOX11	WOX11 recruits a histone H3K27me3 demethylase to promote gene expression during shoot development in rice.	 Here, we show that WOX11 interacts with the H3K27me3 demethylase JMJ705 to activate gene expression during shoot development in rice
JMJ705	WOX11	WOX11 recruits a histone H3K27me3 demethylase to promote gene expression during shoot development in rice.	 Genetic analysis indicates that WOX11 and JMJ705 cooperatively control shoot growth and commonly regulate the expression of a set of genes involved in meristem identity, chloroplast biogenesis, and energy metabolism in the shoot apex
JMJ705	WOX11	WOX11 recruits a histone H3K27me3 demethylase to promote gene expression during shoot development in rice.	 Loss of WOX11 led to increased H3K27me3 and overexpression of JMJ705 decreased the methylation levels at a subset of common targets
JMJ705	WOX11	WOX11 recruits a histone H3K27me3 demethylase to promote gene expression during shoot development in rice.	 The results suggest that recruitment of JMJ705 to specific developmental pathway genes is promoted by DNA-binding transcription factors and that WOX11 functions to stimulate shoot growth through epigenetic reprogramming of genes involved in meristem development and energy-generating pathways
