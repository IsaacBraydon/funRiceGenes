JMJ703|OsJMJ703	panicle	Regulation of Histone Methylation and Reprogramming of Gene Expression in the Rice Inflorescence Meristem.	Double knockdown/knockout of SDG711 and JMJ703 further reduced panicle size
JMJ703|OsJMJ703	panicle size	Regulation of Histone Methylation and Reprogramming of Gene Expression in the Rice Inflorescence Meristem.	Double knockdown/knockout of SDG711 and JMJ703 further reduced panicle size
JMJ703|OsJMJ703	drought	OsJMJ703, a rice histone demethylase gene, plays key roles in plant development and responds to drought stress.	 Transgenic rice of over-expressing OsJMJ703 is sensitive to drought stress, whereas knocking down OsJMJ703 enhances the tolerance to drought stress
JMJ703|OsJMJ703	tolerance	OsJMJ703, a rice histone demethylase gene, plays key roles in plant development and responds to drought stress.	 Transgenic rice of over-expressing OsJMJ703 is sensitive to drought stress, whereas knocking down OsJMJ703 enhances the tolerance to drought stress
JMJ703|OsJMJ703	abiotic stress	OsJMJ703, a rice histone demethylase gene, plays key roles in plant development and responds to drought stress.	 In addition, OsJMJ703 is involved in abiotic stress
JMJ703|OsJMJ703	stress	OsJMJ703, a rice histone demethylase gene, plays key roles in plant development and responds to drought stress.	 In addition, OsJMJ703 is involved in abiotic stress
JMJ703|OsJMJ703	stress	OsJMJ703, a rice histone demethylase gene, plays key roles in plant development and responds to drought stress.	 Transgenic rice of over-expressing OsJMJ703 is sensitive to drought stress, whereas knocking down OsJMJ703 enhances the tolerance to drought stress
JMJ703|OsJMJ703	biotic stress	OsJMJ703, a rice histone demethylase gene, plays key roles in plant development and responds to drought stress.	 In addition, OsJMJ703 is involved in abiotic stress
JMJ703|OsJMJ703	flowering time	OsJMJ703, a rice histone demethylase gene, plays key roles in plant development and responds to drought stress.	 Furthermore, over-expression of OsJMJ703 influenced the type of rice panicle, and knock-down of the expression of OsJMJ703 showed an earlier flowering time in rice
JMJ703|OsJMJ703	drought stress	OsJMJ703, a rice histone demethylase gene, plays key roles in plant development and responds to drought stress.	 Transgenic rice of over-expressing OsJMJ703 is sensitive to drought stress, whereas knocking down OsJMJ703 enhances the tolerance to drought stress
