Transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitously present in plant genomes and often account for significant fractions of the nuclear DNA. For example, roughly 40% of the rice genome consists of TEs, many of which are retrotransposons, including 14% LTR- and approximately 1% non-LTR retrotransposons. Despite their wide distribution and abundance, very few TEs have been found to be transpositional, indicating that TE activities may be tightly controlled by the host genome to minimize the potentially mutagenic effects associated with active transposition. Consistent with this notion, a growing body of evidence suggests that epigenetic silencing pathways such as DNA methylation, RNA interference, and H3K9me2 function collectively to repress TE activity at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. It is not yet clear, however, whether the removal of histone modifications associated with active transcription is also involved in TE silencing. Here, we show that the rice protein JMJ703 is an active H3K4-specific demethylase required for TEs silencing. Impaired JMJ703 activity led to elevated levels of H3K4me3, the misregulation of numerous endogenous genes, and the transpositional reactivation of two families of non-LTR retrotransposons. Interestingly, loss of JMJ703 did not affect TEs (such as Tos17) previously found to be silenced by other epigenetic pathways. These results indicate that the removal of active histone modifications is involved in TE silencing and that different subsets of TEs may be regulated by distinct epigenetic pathways.
NA	Regulation of Histone Methylation and Reprogramming of Gene Expression in the Rice Inflorescence Meristem.	2015	Plant Cell	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, 430070 Wuhan, China.	Rice inflorescence meristem (IM) activity is essential for panicle development and grain production. How chromatin and epigenetic mechanisms regulate IM activity remains unclear. Genome-wide analysis revealed that in addition to genes involved in the vegetative to reproductive transition, many metabolic and protein synthetic genes were activated in IM compared with shoot apical meristem and that a change in the H3K27me3/H3K4me3 ratio was an important factor for the differential expression of many genes. Thousands of genes gained or lost H3K27me3 in IM, and downregulation of the H3K27 methyltransferase gene SET DOMAIN GROUP 711 (SDG711) or mutation of the H3K4 demethylase gene JMJ703 eliminated the increase of H3K27me3 in many genes. SDG711-mediated H3K27me3 repressed several important genes involved in IM activity and many genes that are silent in the IM but activated during floral organogenesis or other developmental stages. SDG711 overexpression augmented IM activity and increased panicle size; suppression of SDG711 by RNA interference had the opposite effect. Double knockdown/knockout of SDG711 and JMJ703 further reduced panicle size. These results suggest that SDG711 and JMJ703 have agonistic functions in reprogramming the H3K27me3/H3K4me3 ratio and modulating gene expression in the IM.
NA	OsJMJ703, a rice histone demethylase gene, plays key roles in plant development and responds to drought stress.	2018	Plant Physiol Biochem	Hebei Key Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Hebei Normal University, Hebei Collaboration Innovation Center for Cell Signaling, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, 050024, China.	JmjC-domain-containing (JmjC) protein, an important kind of histone demethylase in plants, plays key roles in multiple growth and development processes and in adversity resistance. In this study, we found that OsJMJ703, a known histone demethylase, is expressed in various tissues. Furthermore, over-expression of OsJMJ703 influenced the type of rice panicle, and knock-down of the expression of OsJMJ703 showed an earlier flowering time in rice. In addition, OsJMJ703 is involved in abiotic stress. Transgenic rice of over-expressing OsJMJ703 is sensitive to drought stress, whereas knocking down OsJMJ703 enhances the tolerance to drought stress. This study provides a theoretical basis of the biological function of JmjC protein and further promotes the study of drought resistance.
NA	A Chromodomain-Helicase-DNA-like Binding Factor Functions in Chromatin Modification and Gene Regulation.	2020	Plant Physiol.	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University CITY: Wuhan city POSTAL_CODE: 430070 China	Proteins in the chromodomain-helicase/ATPase-DNA-binding domain (CHD) family are divided into three groups. The function of group I CHD proteins in nucleosome positioning is well established, while that of group II members (represented by CHD3/Mi2) remains unclear. Using high-throughput approaches, we investigated the function of the group II rice (Oryza sativa) CHD protein CHR729 in nucleosome positioning, gene expression, histone methylation, and binding. Our data revealed that the chr729 mutation led to increased nucleosome occupancy in the rice genome and altered the expression and histone H3K4me3 modification of many, mainly underexpressed, genes. Further analysis showed that the mutation affected both deposition and depletion of H3K4me3 in distinct chromatin regions with concomitant changes in H3K27me3 modification. Genetic and genomic analysis revealed that CHR729 and JMJ703, an H3K4 demethylase, had agonistic, antagonistic and independent functions in modulating H3K4me3 and expression of subsets of genes. In addition, CHR729 binding was enriched in H3K4me3-marked genic and H3K27me3-marked intergenic regions. The results indicate that CHR729 has distinct functions in regulating H3K4me3 and H3K27me3modifications, and gene expression at different chromatin domains and provide insight into chromatin regulation of 'bivalent' genes marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3.
