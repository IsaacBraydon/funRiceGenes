JMJ703	 These results suggest that SDG711 and JMJ703 have agonistic functions in reprogramming the H3K27me3/H3K4me3 ratio and modulating gene expression in the IM
JMJ703|OsJMJ703	 Furthermore, over-expression of OsJMJ703 influenced the type of rice panicle, and knock-down of the expression of OsJMJ703 showed an earlier flowering time in rice
JMJ703|OsJMJ703	 Genetic and genomic analysis revealed that CHR729 and JMJ703, an H3K4 demethylase, had agonistic, antagonistic and independent functions in modulating H3K4me3 and expression of subsets of genes
