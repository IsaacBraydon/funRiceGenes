JMJ703|OsJMJ703	OsCLF|SDG711	Regulation of Histone Methylation and Reprogramming of Gene Expression in the Rice Inflorescence Meristem.	Thousands of genes gained or lost H3K27me3 in IM, and downregulation of the H3K27 methyltransferase gene SET DOMAIN GROUP 711 (SDG711) or mutation of the H3K4 demethylase gene JMJ703 eliminated the increase of H3K27me3 in many genes
JMJ703|OsJMJ703	OsCLF|SDG711	Regulation of Histone Methylation and Reprogramming of Gene Expression in the Rice Inflorescence Meristem.	Double knockdown/knockout of SDG711 and JMJ703 further reduced panicle size
JMJ703|OsJMJ703	OsCLF|SDG711	Regulation of Histone Methylation and Reprogramming of Gene Expression in the Rice Inflorescence Meristem.	These results suggest that SDG711 and JMJ703 have agonistic functions in reprogramming the H3K27me3/H3K4me3 ratio and modulating gene expression in the IM
JMJ703|OsJMJ703	OsCLF|SDG711	Histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 regulatory genes control stable transmission of an epimutation in rice.	Here we show that maintenance of a stably hypomethylated active epiallele in rice required a CHD3 protein (CHR729) and that over-expression of an H3K4me3 demethylase (JMJ703) or H3K27me3 methyltransferase (SDG711) could stably resilence the epiallele
CHR729|OsCHD3|CRL6|RFS	JMJ703|OsJMJ703	A Chromodomain-Helicase-DNA-like Binding Factor Functions in Chromatin Modification and Gene Regulation.	 Genetic and genomic analysis revealed that CHR729 and JMJ703, an H3K4 demethylase, had agonistic, antagonistic and independent functions in modulating H3K4me3 and expression of subsets of genes
