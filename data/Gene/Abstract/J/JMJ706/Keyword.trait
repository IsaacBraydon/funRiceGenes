JMJ706|OsJMJ706	floral	Rice jmjC domain-containing gene JMJ706 encodes H3K9 demethylase required for floral organ development	Rice jmjC domain-containing gene JMJ706 encodes H3K9 demethylase required for floral organ development
JMJ706|OsJMJ706	flower	Rice jmjC domain-containing gene JMJ706 encodes H3K9 demethylase required for floral organ development	 Gene expression and histone modification analysis indicates that JMJ706 regulates a subset of flower development regulatory genes
JMJ706|OsJMJ706	flower	Rice jmjC domain-containing gene JMJ706 encodes H3K9 demethylase required for floral organ development	 Taken together, our data suggest that rice JMJ706 encodes a heterochromatin-associated H3K9 demethylase involved in the regulation of flower development in rice
