JMJ704	JMJ705	JMJ704 positively regulates rice defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae infection via reducing H3K4me2/3 associated with negative disease resistance regulators.	JMJ704 positively regulates rice defense by epigenetically suppressing master negative defense regulators, presenting a novel mechanism distinct from its homolog JMJ705 which also positively regulates rice defense but via activating positive defense regulators
JMJ704	OsWRKY62	JMJ704 positively regulates rice defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv.  oryzae infection via reducing H3K4me2/3 associated with negative disease resistance regulators	Moreover, JMJ704 suppressed the transcription of the rice defense negative regulator genes, such as NRR, OsWRKY62 and Os-11N3, by reducing the activation marks H3K4me2/3 on them
JMJ704	Os11N3|OsSWEET14	JMJ704 positively regulates rice defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv.  oryzae infection via reducing H3K4me2/3 associated with negative disease resistance regulators	Moreover, JMJ704 suppressed the transcription of the rice defense negative regulator genes, such as NRR, OsWRKY62 and Os-11N3, by reducing the activation marks H3K4me2/3 on them
