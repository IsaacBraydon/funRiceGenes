JMJ710	drought	H3K36 demethylase JMJ710 negatively regulates drought tolerance by suppressing MYB48-1 expression in rice.	H3K36 demethylase JMJ710 negatively regulates drought tolerance by suppressing MYB48-1 expression in rice.
JMJ710	drought	H3K36 demethylase JMJ710 negatively regulates drought tolerance by suppressing MYB48-1 expression in rice.	 Overexpression of JMJ710 causes a drought-sensitive phenotype, while RNAi and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-knockout mutant lines show drought tolerance
JMJ710	drought	H3K36 demethylase JMJ710 negatively regulates drought tolerance by suppressing MYB48-1 expression in rice.	 Under drought stress, JMJ710 is downregulated and the expression of MYB48-1 increases, and the subsequent activation of its downstream drought-responsive genes leads to drought tolerance
JMJ710	tolerance	H3K36 demethylase JMJ710 negatively regulates drought tolerance by suppressing MYB48-1 expression in rice.	H3K36 demethylase JMJ710 negatively regulates drought tolerance by suppressing MYB48-1 expression in rice.

Under drought stress, JMJ710 is downregulated and the expression of MYB48-1 increases, and the subsequent activation of its downstream drought-responsive genes leads to drought tolerance
JMJ710	drought tolerance	H3K36 demethylase JMJ710 negatively regulates drought tolerance by suppressing MYB48-1 expression in rice.	H3K36 demethylase JMJ710 negatively regulates drought tolerance by suppressing MYB48-1 expression in rice.
