JMJ710	H3K36 demethylase JMJ710 negatively regulates drought tolerance by suppressing MYB48-1 expression in rice. |  Overexpression of JMJ710 causes a drought-sensitive phenotype, while RNAi and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-knockout mutant lines show drought tolerance |  Under drought stress, JMJ710 is downregulated and the expression of MYB48-1 increases, and the subsequent activation of its downstream drought-responsive genes leads to drought tolerance	 Overexpression of JMJ710 causes a drought-sensitive phenotype, while RNAi and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-knockout mutant lines show drought tolerance	 Overexpression of JMJ710 causes a drought-sensitive phenotype, while RNAi and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-knockout mutant lines show drought tolerance
