We have identified and analyzed cDNAs corresponding to a single-copy gene from rice, designated lir1, whose expression exhibits dramatic diurnal fluctuations. The cDNAs encode a putative protein of 128 amino acids with no homology to known proteins. Lir1 mRNA accumulates in the light, reaching maximum and minimum steady-state levels at the end of the light and dark period, respectively. The oscillations of lir1 mRNA abundance persist after the plants have been transferred to continuous light or darkness. Plants germinated in the dark have very low levels of lir1 mRNA, whereas plants germinated in continuous light express lir1 at an intermediate but constant level. These results indicate that lir1 expression is controlled by light and a circadian clock.
