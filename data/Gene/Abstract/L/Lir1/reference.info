We have identified and analyzed cDNAs corresponding to a single-copy gene from rice, designated lir1, whose expression exhibits dramatic diurnal fluctuations. The cDNAs encode a putative protein of 128 amino acids with no homology to known proteins. Lir1 mRNA accumulates in the light, reaching maximum and minimum steady-state levels at the end of the light and dark period, respectively. The oscillations of lir1 mRNA abundance persist after the plants have been transferred to continuous light or darkness. Plants germinated in the dark have very low levels of lir1 mRNA, whereas plants germinated in continuous light express lir1 at an intermediate but constant level. These results indicate that lir1 expression is controlled by light and a circadian clock.
NA	LIGHT-INDUCED RICE1 regulates light-dependent attachment of LEAF-TYPE FERREDOXIN-NADP+ OXIDOREDUCTASE to the thylakoid membrane in rice and Arabidopsis.	2016	Plant Cell	Zhejiang University CITY: Hangzhou China [CN].	LIR1 (LIGHT-INDUCED RICE1) encodes a 13-kDa chloroplast targeted protein containing two nearly identical motifs of unknown function. LIR1 is present in the genomes of vascular plants, mosses, liverworts and algae, but not in cyanobacteria. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays, pull-down assays, and yeast two-hybrid analysis, we showed that LIR1 interacts with LEAF-TYPE FERREDOXIN-NADP+ OXIDOREDUCTASE (LFNR), an essential chloroplast enzyme functioning in the last step of photosynthetic linear electron transfer. LIR1 and LFNR formed high molecular weight thylakoid protein complexes with the TIC62 and TROL proteins, previously shown to anchor LFNR to the membrane. We further showed that LIR1 increases the affinity of LFNRs for TIC62, and that the rapid light-triggered degradation of the LIR1 coincides with the release of the LFNR from the thylakoid membrane. Loss of LIR1 resulted in a marked decrease in the accumulation of LFNR-containing thylakoid protein complexes without a concomitant decrease in total LFNR content. In rice (Oryza sativa), photosynthetic capacity of the lir1 mutant plants was slightly impaired, whereas no such effect was observed in Arabidopsis thaliana knock-out mutants. The consequences of LIR1 deficiency in different species are discussed.
