LRK1	OsWDR5a|OsWDR5	Overexpressing lncRNA LAIR increases grain yield and regulates neighbouring gene cluster expression in rice.	 LAIR binds histone modification proteins OsMOF and OsWDR5 in rice cells, which are enriched in LRK1 gene region
LRK1	OsHAM701|OsMOF	Overexpressing lncRNA LAIR increases grain yield and regulates neighbouring gene cluster expression in rice.	 LAIR binds histone modification proteins OsMOF and OsWDR5 in rice cells, which are enriched in LRK1 gene region
LAIR	LRK1	Overexpressing lncRNA LAIR increases grain yield and regulates neighbouring gene cluster expression in rice.	 LAIR binds histone modification proteins OsMOF and OsWDR5 in rice cells, which are enriched in LRK1 gene region
LAIR	LRK1	Overexpressing lncRNA LAIR increases grain yield and regulates neighbouring gene cluster expression in rice.	 Moreover, LAIR is demonstrated to bind 5' and 3' untranslated regions of LRK1 gene
