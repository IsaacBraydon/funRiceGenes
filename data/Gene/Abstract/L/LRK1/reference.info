In rice (Oryza sativa L.), the number of panicles, spikelets per panicle and grain weight are important components of grain yield. These characteristics are controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and are derived from variation inherent in crops. As a result of the complex genetic basis of these traits, only a few genes involved in their control have been cloned and characterized. We have previously map-cloned a gene cluster including eight leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRK) genes in Dongxiang wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.), which increased the grain yield by 16%. In the present study, we characterized the LRK1 gene, which was contained in the donor parent (Dongxiang wild rice) genome and absent from the recurrent parent genome (Guichao2, Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica). Our data showed that rice LRK1 is a plasma membrane protein expressed constitutively in leaves, young panicles, roots and culms. The over-expression of rice LRK1 results in increased panicles, spikelets per panicle, weight per grain and enhanced cellular proliferation, leading to a 27.09% increase in total grain yield per plant. The increased number of panicles and spikelets per panicle are associated with increased branch number. Our data suggest that rice LRK1 regulates rice branch number by enhancing cellular proliferation. The functional characterization of rice LRK1 facilitates an understanding of the mechanisms involved in cereal crop yield, and may have utility in improving grain yield in cereal crops.

Gibberellin is involved in internode elongation. Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) are the largest subfamily of transmembrane receptor-like kinases in plants. LRR-RLKs play important functions in mediating a variety of cellular processes and regulating responses to environmental signals. LRK1, a PSK receptor homolog, is a member of the LRR-RLK family. In the present study, differences in ectopic expression of LRK1 were consistent with extent of rice internode elongation. Analyses of gene expression demonstrated that LRK1 restricts gibberellin biosynthesis during the internode elongation process by down-regulation of the gibberellin biosynthetic gene coding for ent-kaurene oxidase.
NA	Genome-Wide Association Study Unravels LRK1 as a Dark Respiration Regulator in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.) 	2020	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China.	Respiration is a major plant physiological process that generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to support the various pathways involved in the plant growth and development. After decades of focused research on basic mechanisms of respiration, the processes and major proteins involved in respiration are well elucidated. However, much less is known about the natural variation of respiration. Here we conducted a survey on the natural variation of leaf dark respiration (Rd) in a global rice minicore diversity panel and applied a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) to determine candidate loci associated with Rd. This rice minicore diversity panel consists of 206 accessions, which were grown under both growth room (GR) and field conditions. We found that Rd shows high single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability under GR and it is significantly affected by genotype-environment interactions. Rd also exhibits strong positive correlation to the leaf thickness and chlorophyll content. GWAS results of Rd collected under GR and field show an overlapped genomic region in the chromosome 3 (Chr.3), which contains a lead SNP (3m29440628). There are 12 candidate genes within this region; among them, three genes show significantly higher expression levels in accessions with high Rd. Particularly, we observed that the LRK1 gene, annotated as leucine rich repeat receptor kinase, was up-regulated four times. We further found that a single significantly associated SNPs at the promoter region of LRK1, was strongly correlated with the mean annual temperature of the regions from where minicore accessions were collected. A rice lrk1 mutant shows only ~37% Rd of that of WT and retarded growth following exposure to 35 °„C for 30 days, but only 24% reduction in growth was recorded under normal temperature (25 °„C). This study demonstrates a substantial natural variation of Rd in rice and that the LRK1 gene can regulate leaf dark respiratory fluxes, especially under high temperature.
