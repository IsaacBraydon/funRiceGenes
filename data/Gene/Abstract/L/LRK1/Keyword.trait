LRK1	panicle	Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components	 Our data showed that rice LRK1 is a plasma membrane protein expressed constitutively in leaves, young panicles, roots and culms| The over-expression of rice LRK1 results in increased panicles, spikelets per panicle, weight per grain and enhanced cellular proliferation, leading to a 27
LRK1	spikelet	Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components	 The over-expression of rice LRK1 results in increased panicles, spikelets per panicle, weight per grain and enhanced cellular proliferation, leading to a 27
LRK1	culm	Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components	 Our data showed that rice LRK1 is a plasma membrane protein expressed constitutively in leaves, young panicles, roots and culms
LRK1	yield	Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components	 The functional characterization of rice LRK1 facilitates an understanding of the mechanisms involved in cereal crop yield, and may have utility in improving grain yield in cereal crops|Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components
LRK1	gibberellin	Overexpression of rice LRK1 restricts internode elongation by down-regulating OsKO2	 Analyses of gene expression demonstrated that LRK1 restricts gibberellin biosynthesis during the internode elongation process by down-regulation of the gibberellin biosynthetic gene coding for ent-kaurene oxidase
LRK1	root	Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components	 Our data showed that rice LRK1 is a plasma membrane protein expressed constitutively in leaves, young panicles, roots and culms
