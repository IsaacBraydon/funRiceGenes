LOG	shoot	Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme	 The LONELY GUY (LOG) gene of rice is required to maintain meristem activity and its loss of function causes premature termination of the shoot meristem
LOG	shoot	Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme	 LOG messenger RNA is specifically localized in shoot meristem tips, indicating the activation of cytokinins in a specific developmental domain
LOG	meristem	Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme	 The LONELY GUY (LOG) gene of rice is required to maintain meristem activity and its loss of function causes premature termination of the shoot meristem
LOG	meristem	Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme	 LOG messenger RNA is specifically localized in shoot meristem tips, indicating the activation of cytokinins in a specific developmental domain
LOG	cytokinin	Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme	 LOG encodes a novel cytokinin-activating enzyme that works in the final step of bioactive cytokinin synthesis
LOG	cytokinin	Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme	 Revising the long-held idea of multistep reactions, LOG directly converts inactive cytokinin nucleotides to the free-base forms, which are biologically active, by its cytokinin-specific phosphoribohydrolase activity
LOG	cytokinin	Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme	 LOG messenger RNA is specifically localized in shoot meristem tips, indicating the activation of cytokinins in a specific developmental domain
