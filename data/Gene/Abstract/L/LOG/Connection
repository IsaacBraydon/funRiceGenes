LOG	RGN1	RGN1 controls grain number and shapes panicle architecture in rice	 We demonstrated that RGN1 controls lateral grain formation by regulation of LONELY GUY (LOG) expression, thus controlling grain number and shaping panicle architecture
LOG	OsDES1	Mutation of DEFECTIVE EMBRYO SAC1 results in a low seed-setting rate in rice by regulating embryo sac development.	 OsDES1 interacts with LONELY GUY (LOG), a cytokinin-activating enzyme that acts in the final step of cytokinin synthesis; mutation of LOG led to defective female reproductive organ development
