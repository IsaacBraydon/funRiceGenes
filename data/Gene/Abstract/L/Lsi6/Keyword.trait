Lsi6	root	A transporter regulating silicon distribution in rice shoots	 Lsi6 is expressed in the leaf sheath and leaf blades as well as in the root tips
Lsi6	root	A transporter regulating silicon distribution in rice shoots	 Knockdown of Lsi6 did not affect the uptake of Si by the roots but resulted in disordered deposition of silica in the shoots and increased excretion of Si in the guttation fluid
Lsi6	panicle	A transporter at the node responsible for intervascular transfer of silicon in rice	 Lsi6 is a silicon transporter in rice (Oryza sativa), and its expression in node I below the panicles is greatly enhanced when the panicle is completely emerged
Lsi6	panicle	A transporter at the node responsible for intervascular transfer of silicon in rice	 Knockout of Lsi6 decreased Si accumulation in the panicles but increased Si accumulation in the flag leaf
Lsi6	vascular bundle	A transporter at the node responsible for intervascular transfer of silicon in rice	 Lsi6 is mainly localized at the xylem transfer cells located at the outer boundary region of the enlarged large vascular bundles in node I
Lsi6	transporter	A transporter at the node responsible for intervascular transfer of silicon in rice	 Herein, we report on a transporter (Lsi6) responsible for the redirection of a plant nutrient at the node
Lsi6	transporter	A transporter at the node responsible for intervascular transfer of silicon in rice	 Lsi6 is a silicon transporter in rice (Oryza sativa), and its expression in node I below the panicles is greatly enhanced when the panicle is completely emerged
