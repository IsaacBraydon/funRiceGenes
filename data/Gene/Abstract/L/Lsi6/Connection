Lsi3	Lsi6	Orchestration of three transporters and distinct vascular structures in node for intervascular transfer of silicon in rice.	 We found that three transporters (Lsi2, Lsi3, and Lsi6) located at the node are involved in the intervascular transfer, which is required for the preferential distribution of Si
Lsi3	Lsi6	Orchestration of three transporters and distinct vascular structures in node for intervascular transfer of silicon in rice.	 Similar to Lsi6, knockout of Lsi2 and Lsi3 also resulted in decreased distribution of Si to the panicles but increased Si to the flag leaf
