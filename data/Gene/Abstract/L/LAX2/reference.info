Spikelets on the primary and secondary branches determine the grain number per-panicle in rice. In this study, we identified a natural mutant, gnp4, lack of lateral spikelet on the secondary branches in the field condition. In addition, the Gnp4 and Lax1-1 double mutant showed dramatically reduced secondary branches and spikelets in panicle at reproductive stage, and tillers at vegetative stage. By map-based cloning approach, and using four F2 segregating populations, the Gnp4 gene was finally mapped to a 10.7-kb region on the long arm of chromosome 4 in rice. In this region, only one gene was predicted, and genomic DNA sequencing of the 10.7-kb region showed no nucleotide differences between the mutant and wild type. Interestingly, we found that the methylation level of several cytosines in the promoter CpG islands region of the predicted gene in gnp4 were different from the wild type. Thus, we propose that the DNA methylation changes at these sites may induce to decrease expression level of Gnp4, consequently, resulting in phenotypic variation.
Plant Cell-2011-Tabuchi-3276-87.pdf	LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems	2011	Plant Cell	Crop Development Division, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization Agricultural Research Center, Niigata 943-0193, Japan.	Aerial architecture in higher plants is dependent on the activity of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and axillary meristems (AMs). The SAM produces a main shoot and leaf primordia, while AMs are generated at the axils of leaf primordia and give rise to branches and flowers. Therefore, the formation of AMs is a critical step in the construction of plant architecture. Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) lax panicle2 (lax2) mutant, which has altered AM formation. LAX2 regulates the branching of the aboveground parts of a rice plant throughout plant development, except for the primary branch in the panicle. The lax2 mutant is similar to lax panicle1 (lax1) in that it lacks an AM in most of the lateral branching of the panicle and has a reduced number of AMs at the vegetative stage. The lax1 lax2 double mutant synergistically enhances the reduced-branching phenotype, indicating the presence of multiple pathways for branching. LAX2 encodes a nuclear protein that contains a plant-specific conserved domain and physically interacts with LAX1. We propose that LAX2 is a novel factor that acts together with LAX1 in rice to regulate the process of AM formation.
NA	Gnp4/LAX2, a RAWUL protein, interferes with the OsIAA3-OsARF25 interaction to regulate grain length via the auxin signaling pathway in rice.	2018	J Exp Bot	Key Laboratory of Crop Heterosis and Utilization, the Ministry of Education/Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Beijing Municipality/ College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.	Grain length is one of the determinants of yield in rice and auxin plays an important role in regulating it by mediating cell growth. Although several genes in the auxin pathway are involved in regulating grain length, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study we identify a RING-finger and wd40-associated ubiquitin-like (RAWUL) domain-containing protein, Gnp4/LAX2, with a hitherto unknown role in regulation of grain length by its influence on cell expansion. Gnp4/LAX2 is broadly expressed in the plant and subcellular localization analysis shows that it encodes a nuclear protein. Overexpression of Gnp4/LAX2 can significantly increase grain length and thousand-kernel weight. Moreover, Gnp4/LAX2 physically interacts with OsIAA3 and consequently interferes with the OsIAA3-OsARF25 interaction in vitro and in vivo. OsIAA3 RNAi plants consistently exhibit longer grains, while the mutant osarf25 has small grains. In addition, OsARF25 binds to the promoter of OsERF142/SMOS1, a regulator of organ size, and positively regulates its expression. Taken together, the results reveal that Gnp4/LAX2 functions as a regulator of grain length through participation in the OsIAA3-OsARF25-OsERF142 pathway and that it has potential value for molecular breeding in rice.
