Gnp4|LAX2	LAX1|BOS1	LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems	The lax2 mutant is similar to lax panicle1 (lax1) in that it lacks an AM in most of the lateral branching of the panicle and has a reduced number of AMs at the vegetative stage
Gnp4|LAX2	LAX1|BOS1	LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems	The lax1 lax2 double mutant synergistically enhances the reduced-branching phenotype, indicating the presence of multiple pathways for branching
Gnp4|LAX2	LAX1|BOS1	LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems	LAX2 encodes a nuclear protein that contains a plant-specific conserved domain and physically interacts with LAX1
Gnp4|LAX2	LAX1|BOS1	LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems	We propose that LAX2 is a novel factor that acts together with LAX1 in rice to regulate the process of AM formation
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7|PAA7	Gnp4|LAX2	Panicle Apical Abortion 7 Regulates Panicle Development in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Moreover, the severe damage for panicle phenotype in paa7/lax2 double mutant indicated that PAA7 could crosstalk with Lax Panicle 2 (LAX2)
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7|PAA7	Gnp4|LAX2	Panicle Apical Abortion 7 Regulates Panicle Development in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 These findings suggest that PAA7 regulates the development of apical spikelets and interacts with LAX2 to regulate panicle development in rice
