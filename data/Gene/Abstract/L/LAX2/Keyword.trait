Gnp4|LAX2	reproductive	Fine Mapping and Cloning of the Grain Number Per-Panicle Gene (Gnp4) on Chromosome 4 in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	In addition, the Gnp4 and Lax1-1 double mutant showed dramatically reduced secondary branches and spikelets in panicle at reproductive stage, and tillers at vegetative stage
Gnp4|LAX2	grain number	Fine Mapping and Cloning of the Grain Number Per-Panicle Gene (Gnp4) on Chromosome 4 in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Fine Mapping and Cloning of the Grain Number Per-Panicle Gene (Gnp4) on Chromosome 4 in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)
Gnp4|LAX2	vegetative	Fine Mapping and Cloning of the Grain Number Per-Panicle Gene (Gnp4) on Chromosome 4 in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	In addition, the Gnp4 and Lax1-1 double mutant showed dramatically reduced secondary branches and spikelets in panicle at reproductive stage, and tillers at vegetative stage
Gnp4|LAX2	branching	LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems	LAX2 regulates the branching of the aboveground parts of a rice plant throughout plant development, except for the primary branch in the panicle
Gnp4|LAX2	branching	LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems	The lax2 mutant is similar to lax panicle1 (lax1) in that it lacks an AM in most of the lateral branching of the panicle and has a reduced number of AMs at the vegetative stage
Gnp4|LAX2	branching	LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems	The lax1 lax2 double mutant synergistically enhances the reduced-branching phenotype, indicating the presence of multiple pathways for branching
Gnp4|LAX2	vegetative	LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems	The lax2 mutant is similar to lax panicle1 (lax1) in that it lacks an AM in most of the lateral branching of the panicle and has a reduced number of AMs at the vegetative stage
Gnp4|LAX2	grain	Fine Mapping and Cloning of the Grain Number Per-Panicle Gene (Gnp4) on Chromosome 4 in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Fine Mapping and Cloning of the Grain Number Per-Panicle Gene (Gnp4) on Chromosome 4 in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)
Gnp4|LAX2	tiller	Fine Mapping and Cloning of the Grain Number Per-Panicle Gene (Gnp4) on Chromosome 4 in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)
