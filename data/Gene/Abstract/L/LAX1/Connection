Gnp4|LAX2	LAX1	LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems	The lax2 mutant is similar to lax panicle1 (lax1) in that it lacks an AM in most of the lateral branching of the panicle and has a reduced number of AMs at the vegetative stage
Gnp4|LAX2	LAX1	LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems	The lax1 lax2 double mutant synergistically enhances the reduced-branching phenotype, indicating the presence of multiple pathways for branching
Gnp4|LAX2	LAX1	LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems	LAX2 encodes a nuclear protein that contains a plant-specific conserved domain and physically interacts with LAX1
Gnp4|LAX2	LAX1	LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems	We propose that LAX2 is a novel factor that acts together with LAX1 in rice to regulate the process of AM formation
LAX1	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.	We show that RFL promotes AM specification through its effects on LAX1 and CUC genes, as their expression was modulated on RFL knockdown, on induction of RFL:GR fusion protein, and by a repressive RFL-EAR fusion protein
LAX1	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.	Together, we have found that RFL regulates the LAX1 and CUC genes during AM specification, and positively influences the outgrowth of AMs though its effects on auxin transport
LAX1	OsMADS34|PAP2	Regulatory network and genetic interactions established by OsMADS34 in rice inflorescence and spikelet morphogenesis.	 Genetic analysis revealed that OsMADS34 controls different aspects of inflorescence structure, branching and meristem activity synergistically with LAX PANICLE1 (LAX1) and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER4 (FON4), as evidenced by the enhanced phenotypes of osmads34 lax1 and osmads34 fon4 compared with the single mutants
LAX1	OsRA2	OsRAMOSA2 Shapes Panicle Architecture through Regulating Pedicel Length.	 Genetic analysis revealed that OsRA2 may control panicle architecture using the same pathway as that of the axillary meristem gene LAX1 (LAX PANICLE1)
LAX1	OsPID|OsPINOID	PINOID regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin transport and interacts with MADS16 in rice.	 Together, we propose a model that OsPID regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin polar transport and interaction with OsMADS16 and/or LAX1 in rice
LAX1	OsPIN1c	Auxin Efflux Transporters OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d Function Redundantly in Regulating Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Panicle Development.	 Additionally, several critical regulators of reproductive development, such as OsPID, LAX1, OsMADS1, and OsSPL14/IPA1, were differentially expressed in ospin1c-1 ospin1d-1, supporting the hypothesis that OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d are involved in regulating panicle development
LAX1	OsPIN1d	Auxin Efflux Transporters OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d Function Redundantly in Regulating Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Panicle Development.	 Additionally, several critical regulators of reproductive development, such as OsPID, LAX1, OsMADS1, and OsSPL14/IPA1, were differentially expressed in ospin1c-1 ospin1d-1, supporting the hypothesis that OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d are involved in regulating panicle development
LAX1	OsbHLH067	OsbHLH067, OsbHLH068, and OsbHLH069 redundantly regulate inflorescence axillary meristem formation in rice.	 OsbHLH067, OsbHLH068, and OsbHLH069 were preferentially expressed in the developing inflorescence AMs and their proteins could physically interact with LAX1
LAX1	OsbHLH068	OsbHLH067, OsbHLH068, and OsbHLH069 redundantly regulate inflorescence axillary meristem formation in rice.	 OsbHLH067, OsbHLH068, and OsbHLH069 were preferentially expressed in the developing inflorescence AMs and their proteins could physically interact with LAX1
