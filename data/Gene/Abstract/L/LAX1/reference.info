1-s2.0-S0012160600999883-main.pdf	The LAX1 and FRIZZY PANICLE 2 genes determine the inflorescence architecture of rice by controlling rachis-branch and spikelet development	2001	Dev Biol	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5, Takayama, Ikoma, 630-0101, Japan	We have analyzed two mutants that exhibit altered panicle architecture in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In lax1-2, which is a new and stronger allele of the previously reported lax mutant, initiation and/or maintenance of rachis-branches, lateral spikelets, and terminal spikelets was severely prevented. In situ hybridization analysis using OSH1, a rice knotted1 (kn1) ortholog, confirmed the absence of lateral meristems in lax1-2 panicles. These defects indicate that the LAX1 gene is required for the initiation/maintenance of axillary meristems in the rice panicle. In addition to its role in forming lateral meristems, the wild-type LAX1 gene acts as a floral meristem identity gene which specifies the terminal spikelet meristem. A comparison of the defects in lax1-1 and lax1-2 plants suggested that the sensitivities to reduced LAX1 activity were not uniform among different types of meristems. In the fzp2 mutant panicle, the basic branching pattern of the panicle was indistinguishable from that of the wild type; however, specification of both terminal and lateral spikelet meristems was blocked, and sequential rounds of branching occurred at the point where the spikelet meristems are initiated in the wild-type panicle. This resulted in the generation of a panicle composed of excessive ramification of rachis-branches. The lax1-1 fzp2 double mutants exhibited a novel, basically additive, phenotype, which suggests that LAX1 and FZP2 function in genetically independent pathways.
Plant Cell-2009-Oikawa-1095-108.pdf	Two-Step Regulation of LAX PANICLE1 Protein Accumulation in Axillary Meristem Formation in Rice	2009	Plant Cell	Graduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Yayoi, Bunkyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Axillary meristem (AM) formation is an important determinant of plant architecture. In rice (Oryza sativa), LAX PANICLE1 (LAX1) function is required for the generation of AM throughout the plant's lifespan. Here, we show a close relationship between AM initiation and leaf development; specifically, the plastochron 4 (P4) stage of leaf development is crucial for the proliferation of meristematic cells. Coincident with this, LAX1 expression starts in the axils of leaves at P4 stage. LAX1 mRNA accumulates in two to three layers of cells in the boundary region between the initiating AM and the shoot apical meristem. In lax1 mutants, the proliferation of meristematic cells is initiated but fails to progress into the formation of AM. The difference in sites of LAX1 mRNA expression and its action suggests non-cell-autonomous characteristics of LAX1 function. We found that LAX1 protein is trafficked to AM in a stage- and direction-specific manner. Furthermore, we present evidence that LAX1 protein movement is required for the full function of LAX1. Thus, we propose that LAX1 protein accumulates transiently in the initiating AM at P4 stage by a strict regulation of mRNA expression and a subsequent control of protein trafficking. This two-step regulation is crucial to the establishment of the new AM.
Plant Cell-2011-Tabuchi-3276-87.pdf	LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems	2011	Plant Cell	Crop Development Division, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization Agricultural Research Center, Niigata 943-0193, Japan.	Aerial architecture in higher plants is dependent on the activity of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and axillary meristems (AMs). The SAM produces a main shoot and leaf primordia, while AMs are generated at the axils of leaf primordia and give rise to branches and flowers. Therefore, the formation of AMs is a critical step in the construction of plant architecture. Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) lax panicle2 (lax2) mutant, which has altered AM formation. LAX2 regulates the branching of the aboveground parts of a rice plant throughout plant development, except for the primary branch in the panicle. The lax2 mutant is similar to lax panicle1 (lax1) in that it lacks an AM in most of the lateral branching of the panicle and has a reduced number of AMs at the vegetative stage. The lax1 lax2 double mutant synergistically enhances the reduced-branching phenotype, indicating the presence of multiple pathways for branching. LAX2 encodes a nuclear protein that contains a plant-specific conserved domain and physically interacts with LAX1. We propose that LAX2 is a novel factor that acts together with LAX1 in rice to regulate the process of AM formation.
PNAS-2003-Komatsu-11765-70.pdf	LAX and SPA: major regulators of shoot branching in rice	2003	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Graduate School of Agriculture and Life Science, University of Tokyo, Yayoi 1-1-1, Bunkyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	The aerial architecture of plants is determined primarily by the pattern of shoot branching. Although shoot apical meristem initiation during embryogenesis has been extensively studied by molecular genetic approaches using Arabidopsis, little is known about the genetic mechanisms controlling axillary meristem initiation, mainly because of the insufficient number of mutants that specifically alter it. We identified the LAX PANICLE (LAX) and SMALL PANICLE (SPA) genes as the main regulators of axillary meristem formation in rice. LAX encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor and is expressed in the boundary between the shoot apical meristem and the region of new meristem formation. This pattern of LAX expression was repeatedly observed in every axillary meristem, consistent with our observation that LAX is involved in the formation of all types of axillary meristems throughout the ontogeny of a rice plant. Ectopic LAX expression in rice caused pleiotropic effects, including dwarfing, an altered pattern of stem elongation, darker color, bending of the lamina joint, absence of the midribs of leaves, and severe sterility.
NA	OsMADS32 Regulates Rice Floral Patterning through Interactions with Multiple Floral Homeotic Genes	2020	J Exp Bot	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University-University of Adelaide Joint Centre for Agriculture and Health, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.	Floral patterning is regulated by intricate networks of floral identity genes. The peculiar MADS32 subfamily genes, absent in eudicots but prevalent in monocots, regulate floral organ identity. However, how the MADS32 family genes interact with other floral homeotic genes during flower development is mostly unknown. We show here that the rice homeotic transcription factor OsMADS32 regulates floral patterning by interacting synergistically with E class protein OsMADS6 in a dosage-dependent manner. Furthermore, our results indicate important roles of OsMADS32 in defining stamen, pistil and ovule development through physical and genetic interactions with OsMADS1, OsMADS58 and OsMADS13, and in specifying floral meristem identity with OsMADS6, OsMADS3 and OsMADS58 respectively. Our findings suggest that OsMADS32 is an important factor for floral meristem identity maintenance and that it integrates the action of other MADS-box homeotic proteins to sustain floral organ specification and development in rice. Given that OsMADS32 is an orphan gene and absent in eudicots, our data substantially expand our understanding of flower development in plants.
NA	BOS1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor involved in regulating panicle development in rice.	2023	Front Plant Sci	Rice Research Institute, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China.	Panicle development is crucial to increase the grain yield of rice (Oryza sativa). The molecular mechanisms of the control of panicle development in rice remain unclear. In this study, we identified a mutant with abnormal panicles, termed branch one seed 1-1 (bos1-1). The bos1-1 mutant showed pleiotropic defects in panicle development, such as the abortion of lateral spikelets and the decreased number of primary panicle branches and secondary panicle branches. A combined map-based cloning and MutMap approach was used to clone BOS1 gene. The bos1-1 mutation was located in chromosome 1.Â A T-to-A mutation in BOS1 was identified, which changed the codon from TAC to AAC, resulting in the amino acid change from tyrosine to asparagine. BOS1 gene encoded a grass-specific basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, which is a novel allele of the previously cloned LAX PANICLE 1 (LAX1) gene. Spatial and temporal expression profile analyses showed that BOS1 was expressed in young panicles and was induced by phytohormones. BOS1 protein was mainly localized in the nucleus. The expression of panicle development-related genes, such as OsPIN2, OsPIN3, APO1, and FZP, was changed by bos1-1 mutation, suggesting that the genes may be the direct or indirect targets of BOS1 to regulate panicle development. The analysis of BOS1 genomic variation, haplotype, and haplotype network showed that BOS1 gene had several genomic variations and haplotypes. These results laid the foundation for us to further dissect the functions of BOS1.
NA	LAX1, functioning with MADS-box genes, determines normal palea development in rice.	2023	Gene	College of Agriculture, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei 230036, China.	Normal floral organ development in rice is necessary for grain formation. Many MADS-box family genes that belong to ABCDE model have been widely implicated in rice flower development. The LAX1 allele encodes a plant-specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, which is the main regulator of axillary meristem formation in rice. However, the molecular mechanisms of LAX1 allele together with MADS-box family genes underlying palea development have not been reported. We found a short palea mutant plant in a population of indica rice variety 9311 treated with cobalt 60. We report the map-based cloning and characterization of lax1-7, identified as a new mutant allele of the LAX1 locus, and the role of its wild-type allele LAX1 in rice palea development. Through complementary experiments, combined with genetic and molecular biological analyses, the function of the LAX1 allele was determined. We showed that LAX1 allele is expressed specifically in young spikelets and encodes a nucleus-localized protein. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that the LAX1 protein physically interacts with OsMADS1, OsMADS6 and OsMADS7. The LAX1 allele is pleiotropic for the maintenance of rice palea identity via cooperation with MADS-box genes and other traits, including axillary meristem initiation, days to heading, plant height, panicle length and spikelet fertility.
