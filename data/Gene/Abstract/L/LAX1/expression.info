LAX1|BOS1	 Spatial and temporal expression profile analyses showed that BOS1 was expressed in young panicles and was induced by phytohormones |  The expression of panicle development-related genes, such as OsPIN2, OsPIN3, APO1, and FZP, was changed by bos1-1 mutation, suggesting that the genes may be the direct or indirect targets of BOS1 to regulate panicle development
