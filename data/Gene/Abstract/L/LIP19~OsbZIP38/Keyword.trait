LIP19|OsbZIP38	temperature	Low-temperature-dependent expression of a rice gene encoding a protein with a leucine-zipper motif	Expression of lip19 is positively regulated by low temperature, but not affected by high (40 degrees C) temperature
LIP19|OsbZIP38	temperature	Low-temperature-dependent expression of a rice gene encoding a protein with a leucine-zipper motif	The possibility is suggested that Lip19 is a transcriptional factor that is positively controlled by low temperature
LIP19|OsbZIP38	temperature	LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants	The rice low-temperature-induced lip19 gene encodes a 148-amino-acid basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) protein, termed LIP19
LIP19|OsbZIP38	temperature	LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants	Whereas the expression patterns of lip19 and OsOBF1 in response to low temperatures were totally opposite, the locations of their expression were almost identical
LIP19|OsbZIP38	temperature	LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants	Based upon the presented data, we propose a model describing the low-temperature signal switching mediated by LIP19 in rice
