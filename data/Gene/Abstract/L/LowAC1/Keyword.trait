LowAC1	starch	A novel rice dull gene, LowAC1, encodes an RNA recognition motif protein affecting Waxy(b) pre-mRNA splicing.	 Overall, our data suggest that LowAC1 is a novel regulatory factor for starch synthesis in rice
LowAC1	amylose content	A novel rice dull gene, LowAC1, encodes an RNA recognition motif protein affecting Waxy(b) pre-mRNA splicing.	 Aside from low amylose content, lowac1 seeds included an amylopectin structure reducing short chains compared to that of WT seeds
