LC3	LIP1	SPOC domain-containing protein Leaf inclination3 interacts with LIP1 to regulate  rice leaf inclination through auxin signaling	Here we report the functional characterization of rice leaf inclination3 (LC3), a SPOC domain-containing transcription suppressor,  in regulating leaf inclination through interacting with LIP1 (LC3-interacting protein 1), a HIT zinc finger domain-containing protein.
LC3	OsRIP1|OsjRIP1.1	The type-1 ribosome inactivating protein OsRIP1 triggers caspase-independent apoptotic-like death in HeLa cells.	 OsRIP1 provoked HeLa cells to undergo caspase-independent cell death, associated with a significant transcriptional upregulation of the apoptotic gene PUMA, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and the autophagy-related marker LC3
