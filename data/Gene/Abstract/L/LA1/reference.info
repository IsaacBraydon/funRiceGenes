Tiller angle of rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important agronomic trait that contributes to grain production, and has long attracted attentions of breeders for achieving ideal plant architecture to improve grain yield. Although enormous efforts have been made over the past decades to study mutants with extremely spreading or compact tillers, the molecular mechanism underlying the control of tiller angle of cereal crops remains unknown. Here we report the cloning of the LAZY1 (LA1) gene that regulates shoot gravitropism by which the rice tiller angle is controlled. We show that LA1, a novel grass-specific gene, is temporally and spatially expressed, and plays a negative role in polar auxin transport (PAT). Loss-of-function of LA1 enhances PAT greatly and thus alters the endogenous IAA distribution in shoots, leading to the reduced gravitropism, and therefore the tiller-spreading phenotype of rice plants.

Crop architecture parameters such as tiller number, angle and plant height are important agronomic traits that have been considered for breeding programmes. Auxin distribution within the plant has long been recognized to alter architecture. The rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome contains 12 putative PIN genes encoding auxin efflux transporters, including four PIN1 and one PIN2 genes. Here, we report that over-expression of OsPIN2 through a transgenic approach in rice (Japonica cv. Nipponbare) led to a shorter plant height, more tillers and a larger tiller angle when compared with wild type (WT). The expression patterns of the auxin reporter DR5::GUS and quantification of auxin distribution showed that OsPIN2 over-expression increased auxin transport from the shoot to the root-shoot junction, resulting in a non-tissue-specific accumulation of more free auxin at the root-shoot junction relative to WT. Over-expression of OsPIN2 enhanced auxin transport from shoots to roots, but did not alter the polar auxin pattern in the roots. Transgenic plants were less sensitive to N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, an auxin transport inhibitor, than WT in their root growth. OsPIN2-over-expressing plants had suppressed the expression of a gravitropism-related gene OsLazy1 in the shoots, but unaltered expression of OsPIN1b and OsTAC1, which were reported as tiller angle controllers in rice. The data suggest that OsPIN2 has a distinct auxin-dependent regulation pathway together with OsPIN1b and OsTAC1 controlling rice shoot architecture. Altering OsPIN2 expression by genetic transformation can be directly used for modifying rice architecture.
Plant Cell Physiol-2007-Yoshihara-678-88.pdf	Identification of the gravitropism-related rice gene LAZY1 and elucidation of LAZY1-dependent and -independent gravity signaling pathways	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Botanical Gardens, Graduate School of Science, Osaka City University, Kisaichi, Katano-shi, Osaka, 576-0004 Japan.	We identified the gene responsible for three allelic lazy1 mutations of Japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) by map-based cloning, complementation and RNA interference. Sequence analysis and database searches indicated that the wild-type gene (LAZY1) encodes a novel and unique protein (LAZY1) and that rice has no homologous gene. Two lazy1 mutants were LAZY1 null. Confirming and advancing the previously reported results on lazy1 mutants, we found the following. (i) Gravitropism is impaired, but only partially, in lazy1 coleoptiles. (ii) Circumnutation, observed in dark-grown coleoptiles, is totally absent from lazy1 coleoptiles. (iii) Primary roots of lazy1 mutants show normal gravitropism and circumnutation. (iv) LAZY1 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner in gravity-sensitive shoot tissues (i.e. coleoptiles, leaf sheath pulvini and lamina joints) and is little expressed in roots. (v) The gravitropic response of lazy1 coleoptiles is kinetically separable from that absent from lazy1 coleoptiles. (vi) Gravity-induced lateral translocation of auxin, found in wild-type coleoptiles, does not occur in lazy1 coleoptiles. Based on the genetic and physiological evidence obtained, it is concluded that LAZY1 is specifically involved in shoot gravitropism and that LAZY1-dependent and -independent signaling pathways occur in coleoptiles. It is further concluded that, in coleoptiles, only the LAZY1-dependent gravity signaling involves asymmetric distribution of auxin between the two lateral halves and is required for circumnutation.
Plant Physiol.-2013-Wu-317-29.pdf	Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice	2013	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Tiller angle and leaf angle are two important components of rice (Oryza sativa) plant architecture that play a crucial role in determining grain yield. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of the Loose Plant Architecture1 (LPA1) gene in rice, the functional ortholog of the AtIDD15/SHOOT GRAVITROPISM5 (SGR5) gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). LPA1 regulates tiller angle and leaf angle by controlling the adaxial growth of tiller node and lamina joint. LPA1 was also found to affect shoot gravitropism. Expression pattern analysis suggested that LPA1 influences plant architecture by affecting the gravitropism of leaf sheath pulvinus and lamina joint. However, LPA1 only influences gravity perception or signal transduction in coleoptile gravitropism by regulating the sedimentation rate of amyloplasts, distinct from the actions of LAZY1. LPA1 encodes a plant-specific INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein and defines a novel subfamily of 28 INDETERMINATE DOMAIN proteins with several unique conserved features. LPA1 is localized in the nucleus and functions as an active transcriptional repressor, an activity mainly conferred by a conserved ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression-like motif. Further analysis suggests that LPA1 participates in a complicated transcriptional and protein interaction network and has evolved novel functions distinct from SGR5. This study not only facilitates the understanding of gravitropism mechanisms but also generates a useful genetic material for rice breeding.
NA	LAZY genes mediate the effects of gravity on auxin gradients and plant architecture.	2017	Plant Physiol	University of Wisconsin CITY: Madison STATE: Wisconsin United States Of America [US].	A rice mutant led to the discovery of a plant-specific LAZY1 protein that controls the orientation of shoots. Arabidopsis thaliana possesses six LAZY genes having spatially distinct expression patterns. Branch angle phenotypes previously associated with single LAZY genes were here studied in roots and shoots of single and higher-order atlazy mutants. The results identify the major contributors to root and shoot branch angles and gravitropic behavior of seedling hypocotyls and primary roots. AtLAZY1 is the principal determinant of inflorescence branch angle. The weeping inflorescence phenotype of atlazy1,2,4 mutants may be due at least in part to a reversal in the gravitropism mechanism. AtLAZY2 and AtLAZY4 determined lateral root branch angle. Lateral roots of the atlazy2,4 double mutant emerged slightly upward, approximately ten degrees greater than perpendicular to the primary root axis, and they were agravitropic. Etiolated hypocotyls of the quadruple atlazy1,2,3,4 mutant were essentially agravitropic, though their phototropic response was robust. In light-grown seedlings, the root of the atlazy2,3,4 mutant was also agravitropic but when adapted to dim red light it displayed a reversed gravitropic response. A reversed auxin gradient across the root visualized by a fluorescent signaling reporter explained the reversed, upward bending response. We propose that AtLAZY proteins control plant architecture by coupling gravity sensing to the formation of auxin gradients that override a LAZY-independent mechanism that creates an opposing gravity-induced auxin gradient.
