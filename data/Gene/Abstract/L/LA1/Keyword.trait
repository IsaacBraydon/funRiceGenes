LA1	auxin	LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport	 We show that LA1, a novel grass-specific gene, is temporally and spatially expressed, and plays a negative role in polar auxin transport (PAT)
LA1	tiller	LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport	 Here we report the cloning of the LAZY1 (LA1) gene that regulates shoot gravitropism by which the rice tiller angle is controlled
LA1	tiller	LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport	 Loss-of-function of LA1 enhances PAT greatly and thus alters the endogenous IAA distribution in shoots, leading to the reduced gravitropism, and therefore the tiller-spreading phenotype of rice plants
LA1	iaa	LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport	 Loss-of-function of LA1 enhances PAT greatly and thus alters the endogenous IAA distribution in shoots, leading to the reduced gravitropism, and therefore the tiller-spreading phenotype of rice plants
LA1	shoot	LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport	 Here we report the cloning of the LAZY1 (LA1) gene that regulates shoot gravitropism by which the rice tiller angle is controlled
LA1	shoot	LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport	 Loss-of-function of LA1 enhances PAT greatly and thus alters the endogenous IAA distribution in shoots, leading to the reduced gravitropism, and therefore the tiller-spreading phenotype of rice plants
LA1	tiller angle	LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport	 Here we report the cloning of the LAZY1 (LA1) gene that regulates shoot gravitropism by which the rice tiller angle is controlled
