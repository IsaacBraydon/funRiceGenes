LA1|LAZY1	OsBRXL4	OsBRXL4 Regulates Shoot Gravitropism and Rice Tiller Angle through Affecting LAZY1 Nuclear Localization.	 We showed that the interaction between OsBRXL4 and LA1 occurs at the plasma membrane and that their interaction determines LA1 nuclear localization
LA1|LAZY1	OsBRXL4	OsBRXL4 Regulates Shoot Gravitropism and Rice Tiller Angle through Affecting LAZY1 Nuclear Localization.	 Further genetic evidence confirmed that OsBRXL4 controls rice tiller angle by affecting LA1 nuclear localization
LA1|LAZY1	OsBRXL4	OsBRXL4 Regulates Shoot Gravitropism and Rice Tiller Angle through Affecting LAZY1 Nuclear Localization.	 Consistent with this, OsBRXL4 regulates the shoot gravitropism through affecting polar auxin transport as did LA1
LA1|LAZY1	OsBRXL4	OsBRXL4 Regulates Shoot Gravitropism and Rice Tiller Angle through Affecting LAZY1 Nuclear Localization.	OsBRXL4 Regulates Shoot Gravitropism and Rice Tiller Angle through Affecting LAZY1 Nuclear Localization.
