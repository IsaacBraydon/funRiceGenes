NA	The OsRR24/LEPTO1 Type-B Response Regulator is Essential for the Organization of Leptotene Chromosomes in Rice Meiosis.	2018	Plant Cell	Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology,Chinese Academy of Sciences CITY: Beijing China [CN].	Response regulators play significant roles in controlling various biological processes; however, their roles in plant meiosis remain unclear. Here, we report the identification of OsRR24/LEPTOTENE1 (LEPTO1), a rice (Oryza sativa) type-B response regulator that participates in the establishment of key molecular and morphological features of chromosomes in leptotene, an early stage of prophase I in meiosis. Although meiosis initiates normally, as indicated by staining of the centromere-specific histone CENH3, the meiotic chromosomes in lepto1 mutant pollen mother cells (PMCs) fail to form the thin thread-like structures that are typical of leptotene chromosomes in wild-type PMCs. Furthermore, lepto1 mutants fail to form chromosomal double-strand breaks, do not recruit meiosis-specific proteins to the meiotic chromosomes, and show disrupted callose deposition. LEPTO1 is also essential for programmed cell death in tapetal cells. LEPTO1 contains a conserved signal receiver domain (DDK) and a myb-like DNA binding domain (MYB) at the N terminus. LEPTO1 interacts with two authentic histidine phosphotransfer (AHP) proteins, OsAHP1 and OsAHP2, via the DDK domain, and a phosphomimetic mutation of the DDK domain relieves its repression of LEPTO1 transactivation activity. Collectively, our results show that OsRR24/LEPTO1 plays a significant role in the leptotene phase of meiotic prophase I.
NA	Defective Leptotene Chromosome 1 (DLC1) encodes a type-B response regulator and is required for rice meiosis.	2019	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, 611130, China.	Meiosis is critical for sexual reproduction and the generation of new allelic variations in most eukaryotes. In this study, we report the isolation of a meiotic gene, DLC1, using a map-based cloning strategy. The dlc1 mutant is sterile in both male and female gametophytes due to an earlier defect in the leptotene chromosome and subsequent abnormalities at later stages. DLC1 is strongly expressed in the pollen mother cells (PMCs) and tapetum and encodes a nucleus-located rice type-B response regulator (RR) with transcriptional activity. Further investigations show that DLC1 interacts with all five putative rice histidine phosphotransfer proteins (HPs) in yeast and planta cells, suggesting a possible participation of the two-component signalling systems (TCS) in rice meiosis. Our results demonstrate that DLC1 is required for rice meiosis and fertility, providing useful information for the role of TCS in rice meiosis. This article is protected by copyright.
