CENH3	LEPTO1|OsRR24	The OsRR24/LEPTO1 Type-B Response Regulator is Essential for the Organization of Leptotene Chromosomes in Rice Meiosis.	 Although meiosis initiates normally, as indicated by staining of the centromere-specific histone CENH3, the meiotic chromosomes in lepto1 mutant pollen mother cells (PMCs) fail to form the thin thread-like structures that are typical of leptotene chromosomes in wild-type PMCs
LEPTO1|OsRR24	OHP1|OsAHP1	The OsRR24/LEPTO1 Type-B Response Regulator is Essential for the Organization of  Leptotene Chromosomes in Rice Meiosis	LEPTO1 interacts with two authentic histidine phosphotransfer (AHP) proteins, OsAHP1 and OsAHP2, via the DDK domain, and a phosphomimetic mutation of the DDK domain relieves its repression of LEPTO1 transactivation activity.
