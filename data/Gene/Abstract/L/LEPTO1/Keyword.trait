LEPTO1|OsRR24	pollen	The OsRR24/LEPTO1 Type-B Response Regulator is Essential for the Organization of Leptotene Chromosomes in Rice Meiosis.	 Although meiosis initiates normally, as indicated by staining of the centromere-specific histone CENH3, the meiotic chromosomes in lepto1 mutant pollen mother cells (PMCs) fail to form the thin thread-like structures that are typical of leptotene chromosomes in wild-type PMCs
LEPTO1|OsRR24	cell death	The OsRR24/LEPTO1 Type-B Response Regulator is Essential for the Organization of Leptotene Chromosomes in Rice Meiosis.	 LEPTO1 is also essential for programmed cell death in tapetal cells

Although meiosis initiates normally, as indicated by staining of the centromere-specific histone CENH3, the meiotic chromosomes in lepto1 mutant pollen mother cells (PMCs) fail to form the thin thread-like structures that are typical of leptotene chromosomes in wild-type PMCs
LEPTO1|OsRR24	tapetal	The OsRR24/LEPTO1 Type-B Response Regulator is Essential for the Organization of Leptotene Chromosomes in Rice Meiosis.	 LEPTO1 is also essential for programmed cell death in tapetal cells
LEPTO1|OsRR24	meiotic	The OsRR24/LEPTO1 Type-B Response Regulator is Essential for the Organization of Leptotene Chromosomes in Rice Meiosis.

LEPTO1|OsRR24	meiotic	The OsRR24/LEPTO1 Type-B Response Regulator is Essential for the Organization of Leptotene Chromosomes in Rice Meiosis.	 Furthermore, lepto1 mutants fail to form chromosomal double-strand breaks, do not recruit meiosis-specific proteins to the meiotic chromosomes, and show disrupted callose deposition
