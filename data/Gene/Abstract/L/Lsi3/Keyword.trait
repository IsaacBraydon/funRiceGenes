Lsi3	leaf	Orchestration of three transporters and distinct vascular structures in node for intervascular transfer of silicon in rice.	Similar to Lsi6, knockout of Lsi2 and Lsi3 also resulted in decreased distribution of Si to the panicles but increased Si to the flag leaf
Lsi3	vascular bundle	Orchestration of three transporters and distinct vascular structures in node for intervascular transfer of silicon in rice.	Lsi3 was located in the parenchyma tissues between enlarged vascular bundles and diffuse vascular bundles
Lsi3	silicon	Orchestration of three transporters and distinct vascular structures in node for  intervascular transfer of silicon in rice	Orchestration of three transporters and distinct vascular structures in node for  intervascular transfer of silicon in rice
Lsi3	silicon transporter	Orchestration of three transporters and distinct vascular structures in node for  intervascular transfer of silicon in rice	Orchestration of three transporters and distinct vascular structures in node for  intervascular transfer of silicon in rice
