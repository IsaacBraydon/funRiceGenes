LFS	 LFS showed diurnal expression peaking at dawn, and transcript levels increased gradually until heading |  Expression of the LD-specific floral repressor gene LEAFY COTYLEDON2 AND FUSCA3-LIKE 1 (OsLFL1) was upregulated in lfs knockout mutants, and LFS bound directly to the GCC-rich motif in the OsLFL1 promoter, repressing OsLFL1 expression |  LFS did not affect the expression of other OsLFL1 regulators, including OsMADS50, OsMADS56, VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE3-LIKE 2, and GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, or interact with them
