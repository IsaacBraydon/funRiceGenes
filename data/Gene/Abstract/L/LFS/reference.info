The vegetative-to-reproductive transition requires the complex, coordinated activities of many transcriptional regulators. Rice (Oryza sativa), a facultative short-day (SD) plant, flowers early under SD (≤10 h light/day) and late under long-day (LD; ≥14 h light/day) conditions. Here, we demonstrate that rice LATE FLOWERING SEMI-DWARF (LFS) encodes an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) transcription factor that promotes flowering under non-inductive LD conditions. LFS showed diurnal expression peaking at dawn, and transcript levels increased gradually until heading. Mutation of LFS delayed flowering under LD but not SD conditions. Expression of the LD-specific floral repressor gene LEAFY COTYLEDON2 AND FUSCA3-LIKE 1 (OsLFL1) was upregulated in lfs knockout mutants, and LFS bound directly to the GCC-rich motif in the OsLFL1 promoter, repressing OsLFL1 expression. This suggests that increased LFS activity during vegetative growth gradually attenuates OsLFL1 activity. Subsequent increases in Early heading date 1, Heading date 3a, and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 expression result in flowering under non-inductive LD conditions. LFS did not affect the expression of other OsLFL1 regulators, including OsMADS50, OsMADS56, VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE3-LIKE 2, and GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, or interact with them. Our results demonstrate the novel roles of LFS in inducing flowering under natural LD conditions.
