LFS	growth	The AP2/ERF transcription factor LATE FLOWERING SEMI-DWARF suppresses long-day-dependent repression of flowering.	 This suggests that increased LFS activity during vegetative growth gradually attenuates OsLFL1 activity
LFS	vegetative	The AP2/ERF transcription factor LATE FLOWERING SEMI-DWARF suppresses long-day-dependent repression of flowering.	 This suggests that increased LFS activity during vegetative growth gradually attenuates OsLFL1 activity
LFS	floral	The AP2/ERF transcription factor LATE FLOWERING SEMI-DWARF suppresses long-day-dependent repression of flowering.	 Expression of the LD-specific floral repressor gene LEAFY COTYLEDON2 AND FUSCA3-LIKE 1 (OsLFL1) was upregulated in lfs knockout mutants, and LFS bound directly to the GCC-rich motif in the OsLFL1 promoter, repressing OsLFL1 expression
LFS	flowering	The AP2/ERF transcription factor LATE FLOWERING SEMI-DWARF suppresses long-day-dependent repression of flowering.	 Mutation of LFS delayed flowering under LD but not SD conditions
LFS	flowering	The AP2/ERF transcription factor LATE FLOWERING SEMI-DWARF suppresses long-day-dependent repression of flowering.	 Our results demonstrate the novel roles of LFS in inducing flowering under natural LD conditions
LFS	vernalization	The AP2/ERF transcription factor LATE FLOWERING SEMI-DWARF suppresses long-day-dependent repression of flowering.	 LFS did not affect the expression of other OsLFL1 regulators, including OsMADS50, OsMADS56, VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE3-LIKE 2, and GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, or interact with them
