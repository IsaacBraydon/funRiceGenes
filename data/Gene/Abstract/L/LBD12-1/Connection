LBD12-1	SaM	The LBD12-1 transcription factor suppresses apical meristem size by repressing Argonaute 10 expression.	 In this research we showed that transgenic rice plants overexpressing LBD12-1, an LBD family transcription factor, exhibited stunted growth, twisted leaves, abnormal anthers, and reduced SAM size
LBD12-1	SaM	The LBD12-1 transcription factor suppresses apical meristem size by repressing Argonaute 10 expression.	 lbd12-1 loss-of-function mutants showed similar phenotypes and SAM size to WT under normal conditions, but lbd12-1 had a larger SAM under salt stress
