LBD12-1	growth	The LBD12-1 transcription factor suppresses apical meristem size by repressing Argonaute 10 expression.	Overexpression of AGO10 in an LBD12-1 overexpression background rescued the growth defect phenotype of LBD12-1 overexpressing plants
LBD12-1	salt	The LBD12-1 transcription factor suppresses apical meristem size by repressing Argonaute 10 expression.	lbd12-1 loss-of-function mutants showed similar phenotypes and SAM size to WT under normal conditions, but lbd12-1 had a larger SAM under salt stress
LBD12-1	transcription factor	The LBD12-1 transcription factor suppresses apical meristem size by repressing Argonaute 10 expression.	The LBD12-1 transcription factor suppresses apical meristem size by repressing Argonaute 10 expression.
LBD12-1	salt stress	The LBD12-1 transcription factor suppresses apical meristem size by repressing Argonaute 10 expression.	lbd12-1 loss-of-function mutants showed similar phenotypes and SAM size to WT under normal conditions, but lbd12-1 had a larger SAM under salt stress
LBD12-1	meristem	The LBD12-1 transcription factor suppresses apical meristem size by repressing Argonaute 10 expression.	The LBD12-1 transcription factor suppresses apical meristem size by repressing Argonaute 10 expression.
LBD12-1	stress	The LBD12-1 transcription factor suppresses apical meristem size by repressing Argonaute 10 expression.	The expression of LBD12-1 and its binding ability to the AGO10 promoter is induced by stress
LBD12-1	stress	The LBD12-1 transcription factor suppresses apical meristem size by repressing Argonaute 10 expression.	lbd12-1 loss-of-function mutants showed similar phenotypes and SAM size to WT under normal conditions, but lbd12-1 had a larger SAM under salt stress
