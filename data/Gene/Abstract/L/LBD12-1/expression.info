LBD12-1	The LBD12-1 transcription factor suppresses apical meristem size by repressing Argonaute 10 expression. |  Further research revealed that LBD12-1 directly binds to the promotor region and represses the expression of AGO10 |  Overexpression of AGO10 in an LBD12-1 overexpression background rescued the growth defect phenotype of LBD12-1 overexpressing plants |  The expression of LBD12-1 and its binding ability to the AGO10 promoter is induced by stress	 Overexpression of AGO10 in an LBD12-1 overexpression background rescued the growth defect phenotype of LBD12-1 overexpressing plants
