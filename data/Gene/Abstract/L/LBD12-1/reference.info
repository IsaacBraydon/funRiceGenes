NA	The LBD12-1 transcription factor suppresses apical meristem size by repressing Argonaute 10 expression.	2016	Plant Physiol	Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences CITY: Beijing China [CN].	The shoot apical meristem (SAM) consists of a population of multipotent cells that generate all aerial structures and regenerates itself. SAM maintenance and lateral organ development are regulated by several complex signaling pathways, in which the Argonaute gene mediated pathway plays a key role. One Argonaute gene, AGO10, functions as a miRNA locker that attenuates miR165/166 activity and positively regulates shoot apical meristem development, but little is known about when and how AGO10 is regulated at the transcriptional level. In this research we showed that transgenic rice plants overexpressing LBD12-1, an LBD family transcription factor, exhibited stunted growth, twisted leaves, abnormal anthers, and reduced SAM size. Further research revealed that LBD12-1 directly binds to the promotor region and represses the expression of AGO10. Overexpression of AGO10 in an LBD12-1 overexpression background rescued the growth defect phenotype of LBD12-1 overexpressing plants. The expression of LBD12-1 and its binding ability to the AGO10 promoter is induced by stress. lbd12-1 loss-of-function mutants showed similar phenotypes and SAM size to WT under normal conditions, but lbd12-1 had a larger SAM under salt stress. Our findings provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanism of AGO10 by which SAM size is controlled under stress conditions.
