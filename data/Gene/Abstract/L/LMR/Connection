LRD6-6|LMR	MEL1	Histone H3 modifications are widely reprogrammed during male meiosis I in rice dependently on MEL1 Argonaute protein.	 LMR occurred dependently on a rice Argonaute protein, MEIOSIS ARRESTED AT LEPTOTENE1 (MEL1), which is specifically expressed in germ cells prior to meiosis, because LMR was depleted severely in mel1 mutant anthers
LRD6-6|LMR	MEL1	Histone H3 modifications are widely reprogrammed during male meiosis I in rice dependently on MEL1 Argonaute protein.	 Interestingly, opposed to the LMR loss in most chromosomal regions, aberrant meiotic protein loading and hyper H3K9me2 accumulation emerged on the nucleolar organizing region in the mel1 PMCs
LRD6-6|LMR	MEL1	Histone H3 modifications are widely reprogrammed during male meiosis I in rice dependently on MEL1 Argonaute protein.	 These results suggest that MEL1 plays important roles in epigenetic LMR to promote faithful homologous recombination and synapsis in rice meiosis
