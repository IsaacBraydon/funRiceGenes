LSSR1	pollen	LSSR1 facilitates seed setting rate by promoting fertilization in rice.	 LSSR1 is predominantly expressed in anthers during the microsporogenesis stage, and its encoded protein contains a signal peptide at the N-terminal, which may be a secretory protein that stores in pollen grains and functions during rice fertilization
LSSR1	pollen	LSSR1 facilitates seed setting rate by promoting fertilization in rice.	 In addition, lssr1 pollen grains could be normally stained by I2-KI solution
LSSR1	pollen	LSSR1 facilitates seed setting rate by promoting fertilization in rice.	 Cytological results demonstrate that the blockage of fertilization mostly accounted for the low seed setting rate in lssr1 mutant lines, which was most likely caused by abnormal pollen grain germination, failed pollen tube penetration, and retarded pollen tube elongation
LSSR1	grain	LSSR1 facilitates seed setting rate by promoting fertilization in rice.	 Cytological results demonstrate that the blockage of fertilization mostly accounted for the low seed setting rate in lssr1 mutant lines, which was most likely caused by abnormal pollen grain germination, failed pollen tube penetration, and retarded pollen tube elongation
LSSR1	seed	LSSR1 facilitates seed setting rate by promoting fertilization in rice.	LSSR1 facilitates seed setting rate by promoting fertilization in rice.
LSSR1	seed	LSSR1 facilitates seed setting rate by promoting fertilization in rice.	 To explore the physiological function of LSSR1 in rice, loss-of-function mutants of LSSR1 were created through the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which showed a significant decrease in rice seed setting rate
LSSR1	seed	LSSR1 facilitates seed setting rate by promoting fertilization in rice.	 Cytological results demonstrate that the blockage of fertilization mostly accounted for the low seed setting rate in lssr1 mutant lines, which was most likely caused by abnormal pollen grain germination, failed pollen tube penetration, and retarded pollen tube elongation
LSSR1	seed	LSSR1 facilitates seed setting rate by promoting fertilization in rice.	 Together, our results suggest that LSSR1 plays an important role in rice fertilization, which in turn is vital for maintaining rice seed setting rate
LSSR1	vegetative	LSSR1 facilitates seed setting rate by promoting fertilization in rice.	 However, the morphology of the vegetative and reproductive organs appears normal in lssr1 mutant lines
LSSR1	reproductive	LSSR1 facilitates seed setting rate by promoting fertilization in rice.	 However, the morphology of the vegetative and reproductive organs appears normal in lssr1 mutant lines
