L-2	seedling	cDNA cloning of rice lipoxygenase L-2 and characterization using an active enzyme expressed from the cDNA in Escherichia coli	A full-length cDNA of rice lipoxygenase L-2 was cloned from 3-day old seedlings
L-2	seedling	cDNA cloning of rice lipoxygenase L-2 and characterization using an active enzyme expressed from the cDNA in Escherichia coli	The enzyme had the same properties as the L-2 enzyme that was isolated from seedlings, but differed from the lipoxygenase L-3 isolated from mature plants
