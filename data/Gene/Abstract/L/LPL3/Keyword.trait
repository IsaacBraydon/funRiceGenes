LPL3|DS8	epidermal cell morphogenesis	Homologs of SCAR/WAVE complex components are required for epidermal cell morphogenesis in rice.	Collectively, the results indicate that LPL2 and LPL3 are two functionally conserved homologs of the SCAR/WAVE complex components, and that they play an important role in controlling epidermal cell morphogenesis in rice by organising F-actin.
