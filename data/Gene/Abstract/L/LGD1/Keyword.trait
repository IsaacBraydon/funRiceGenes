LGD1	grain yield	Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters	 The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield
LGD1	vegetative	Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters	 Our results demonstrated that LGD1 pleiotropically regulated rice vegetative growth and development through both the distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns of its multiple transcripts and RNA binding activity
