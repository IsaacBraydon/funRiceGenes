Ltp1	disease	Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene	The Ltp1 transcripts were found to strongly accumulate in response to inoculation with the fungal agent of the blast disease, Magnaporthe grisea, in two rice cultivars exhibiting compatible or incompatible host-pathogen interactions
Ltp1	stomata	Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene	Analysis of pdelta1176Gus leaf samples inoculated with the blast fungus demonstrated that the Ltp1 promoter is induced in all cell types of tissues surrounding the lesion and notably in stomata guard cells
Ltp1	vegetative	Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene	Histochemical and fluorometric GUS assays and in situ detection of uidA transcripts in transgenic homozygous lines harbouring the pdelta1176Gus construct demonstrated that the Ltp1 promoter is preferentially active in aerial vegetative and reproductive organs and that both specificity and level of expression are regulated during organ development
Ltp1	reproductive	Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene	Histochemical and fluorometric GUS assays and in situ detection of uidA transcripts in transgenic homozygous lines harbouring the pdelta1176Gus construct demonstrated that the Ltp1 promoter is preferentially active in aerial vegetative and reproductive organs and that both specificity and level of expression are regulated during organ development
