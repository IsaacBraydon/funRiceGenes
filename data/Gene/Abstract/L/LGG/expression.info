LGG	 CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout and overexpression of LGG led to longer and shorter grains than wild type, respectively, showing that LGG regulates spikelet hull length |  Expression of LGG was highest in the 0 |  RNA-Seq analysis of 1-mm-long young panicles from LGG knockout and overexpressing plants revealed that the expressions of many cell cycle-related genes were reduced in knockout plants relative to LGG-overexpressing plants and wild type, whereas some genes for cell proliferation were highly expressed in knockout plants	 CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout and overexpression of LGG led to longer and shorter grains than wild type, respectively, showing that LGG regulates spikelet hull length
