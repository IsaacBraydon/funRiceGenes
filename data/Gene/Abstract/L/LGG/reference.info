NA	CO2 Responsive CCT Protein Stimulates the Ectopic Expression of Particular Starch Biosynthesis-Related Enzymes, which Markedly Change the Structure of Starch in the Leaf Sheaths of Rice.	2019	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Tropical Crop Science, Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Kobe University, Kobe, 657-8501 Japan.	CO2 Responsive CCT protein (CRCT) is suggested to be a positive regulator of starch biosynthesis in the leaf sheaths of rice, regulating the expression levels of starch biosynthesis related genes. In this study, the effects of CRCT expression levels on the expression of starch biosynthesis related enzymes and the quality of starch were studied. Using native-PAGE/activity staining and immunoblotting, we found that the protein levels of starch synthase I, branching enzyme I, branching enzyme IIa, isoamylase 1 and phosphorylase 1 were largely correlated with the CRCT expression levels in the leaf sheaths of CRCT transgenic lines. In contrast, the CRCT expression levels largely did not affect the expression levels and/or activities of starch biosynthesis related enzymes in the leaf blades and endosperm tissues. The analysis of the chain-length distribution of starch in the leaf sheaths showed that short chains with a degree of polymerization from 5 to 14 were increased in the overexpression lines, but decreased in the knockdown lines. The amylose content of starch in the leaf sheath was greatly increased in the overexpression lines. In contrast, the molecular weight of the amylopectin of starch in the leaf sheath of overexpression lines did not change compared with those of the nontransgenic rice. These results suggest that CRCT can control the quality as well as quantity of starch in the leaf sheath by regulating the expression of particular starch biosynthesis-related enzymes.
NA	LARGE GRAIN encodes a putative RNA-binding protein that regulates spikelet hull length in rice.	2019	Plant Cell Physiol	Graduate School of Environmental and Life Science, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan.	Grain size is a key determiner of grain weight, one of the yield components in rice (Oryza sativa). Therefore, to increase grain yield, it is important to elucidate the detailed mechanisms regulating grain size. The Large grain (Lgg) mutant, found in the nDart1-tagged lines of Koshihikari, is caused by a truncated nDart1-3 and 355<U+2009>bp deletion in the 5' UTR of LGG, which encodes a putative RNA-binding protein, through transposon display and cosegregation analysis between grain length and LGG genotype in F2 and F3. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout and overexpression of LGG led to longer and shorter grains than wild type, respectively, showing that LGG regulates spikelet hull length. Expression of LGG was highest in the 0.6-mm-long young panicle and gradually decreased as the panicle elongated. LGG was also expressed in roots and leaves. These results show that LGG functions at the very early stage of panicle development. Longitudinal cell numbers of spikelet hulls of Lgg, knockout and overexpressed plants were significantly different from those of the wild type, suggesting that LGG might regulate longitudinal cell proliferation in the spikelet hull. RNA-Seq analysis of 1-mm-long young panicles from LGG knockout and overexpressing plants revealed that the expressions of many cell cycle-related genes were reduced in knockout plants relative to LGG-overexpressing plants and wild type, whereas some genes for cell proliferation were highly expressed in knockout plants. Taken together, these results suggest that LGG might be a regulator of cell cycle and cell division in the rice spikelet hull.
