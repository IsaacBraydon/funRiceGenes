Symbol	Keyword	Title	Evidence
LP2	reproductive	The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice	 Low or undetectable levels of LP2 transcript and LP2-mediated reporter gene expression were observed in roots, mature seeds, and reproductive tissues
LP2	seed	The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice	 Low or undetectable levels of LP2 transcript and LP2-mediated reporter gene expression were observed in roots, mature seeds, and reproductive tissues| The LP2 promoter is highly responsive to light and only weak expression was detected in etiolated rice seedlings
LP2	panicle	The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice	 We have isolated and characterized the promoter of the rice Leaf Panicle 2 gene (LP2, Os02g40240)
LP2	seedling	The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice	 The LP2 promoter is highly responsive to light and only weak expression was detected in etiolated rice seedlings
LP2	root	The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice	 Low or undetectable levels of LP2 transcript and LP2-mediated reporter gene expression were observed in roots, mature seeds, and reproductive tissues
LP2	leaf	The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice	 We have isolated and characterized the promoter of the rice Leaf Panicle 2 gene (LP2, Os02g40240)
