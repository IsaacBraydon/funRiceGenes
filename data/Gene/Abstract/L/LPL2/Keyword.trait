LPL2	plant height	Homologs of SCAR/WAVE complex components are required for epidermal cell morphogenesis in rice	The lpl2-1 also exhibited irregular stomata patterns, reduced plant height, and short panicles and roots.
LPL2	panicle	Homologs of SCAR/WAVE complex components are required for epidermal cell morphogenesis in rice	The lpl2-1 also exhibited irregular stomata patterns, reduced plant height, and short panicles and roots.
LPL2	root	Homologs of SCAR/WAVE complex components are required for epidermal cell morphogenesis in rice	The lpl2-1 also exhibited irregular stomata patterns, reduced plant height, and short panicles and roots.
LPL2	epidermal cell morphogenesis	Homologs of SCAR/WAVE complex components are required for epidermal cell morphogenesis in rice	Collectively, the results indicate that LPL2 and LPL3 are two functionally conserved homologs of the SCAR/WAVE complex components, and that they play an important role in controlling epidermal cell morphogenesis in rice by organising F-actin.
LPL2	development	Homologs of SCAR/WAVE complex components are required for epidermal cell morphogenesis in rice	lpl2-1 exhibits severe defects in epidermal PC lobe development
