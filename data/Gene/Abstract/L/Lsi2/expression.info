Lsi2|OsLsi2	 Herein we investigated the mechanism underlying regulation of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 expression |  There was a negative correlation between the expression level of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 and shoot Si accumulation when the rice seedlings were exposed to different Si supply conditions |  A split root experiment showed that the expression of both OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 was also down-regulated in half the roots without direct Si exposure when the other half of the roots were exposed to Si
