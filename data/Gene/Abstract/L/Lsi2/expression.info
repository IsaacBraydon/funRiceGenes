Lsi2|OsLsi2	 Herein we investigated the mechanism underlying regulation of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 expression |  There was a negative correlation between the expression level of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 and shoot Si accumulation when the rice seedlings were exposed to different Si supply conditions |  A split root experiment showed that the expression of both OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 was also down-regulated in half the roots without direct Si exposure when the other half of the roots were exposed to Si
Lsi2|OsLsi2	 The expression level of some transporter genes including OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 for Si uptake and OsNramp5 for Mn uptake was significantly decreased in the mutant compared with the wild-type rice
Lsi2|OsLsi2	 Moreover, results obtained from root split experiment using lsi1 WT showed down-regulated expression of Si transport genes (OsLsi1 and OsLsi2) in root accelerated Si deposition at root endodermis |  In summary, our results reveal that Si deposition at root endodermis and its resultant reduction of Na+ bypass flow is modulated by OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 and regulated by the expression of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2, implying that root Si deposition could be an active and physiologically-regulated process in rice
