Lsi1|OsNIP2;1	Lsi2|OsLsi2	An efflux transporter of silicon in rice	 Here we describe a previously uncharacterized gene, low silicon rice 2 (Lsi2), which has no similarity to Lsi1| The protein encoded by this gene is localized, like Lsi1, on the plasma membrane of cells in both the exodermis and the endodermis, but in contrast to Lsi1, which is localized on the distal side, Lsi2 is localized on the proximal side of the same cells
Lsi1|OsNIP2;1	Lsi2|OsLsi2	Genotypic difference in silicon uptake and expression of silicon transporter genes in rice	 The expression of two Si transporter genes (Low silicon rice 1 [Lsi1] and Lsi2) investigated using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed higher expression of both genes in Nipponbare than in Kasalath| Immunostaining with Lsi1 and Lsi2 antibodies revealed a similar pattern of subcellular localization of these two Si transporters in both varieties; Lsi1 and Lsi2 were localized at the distal and proximal sides, respectively, of both exodermis and endodermis of the roots
Lsi1|OsNIP2;1	Lsi2|OsLsi2	The rice aquaporin Lsi1 mediates uptake of methylated arsenic species	 Recent studies have shown that arsenite is taken up by rice (Oryza sativa) roots through two silicon transporters, Lsi1 (the aquaporin NIP2;1) and Lsi2 (an efflux carrier)| The rice lsi1 mutant lost about 80% and 50% of the uptake capacity for MMA(V) and DMA(V), respectively, compared with the wild-type rice, whereas Lsi2 mutation had little effect
Lsi1|OsNIP2;1	Lsi2|OsLsi2	Transporters of arsenite in rice and their role in arsenic accumulation in rice grain	 Mutation in Lsi2 had a much greater impact on arsenic accumulation in shoots and grain in field-grown rice than Lsi1
Lsi2|OsLsi2	Lsi3	Orchestration of three transporters and distinct vascular structures in node for intervascular transfer of silicon in rice.	 We found that three transporters (Lsi2, Lsi3, and Lsi6) located at the node are involved in the intervascular transfer, which is required for the preferential distribution of Si
Lsi2|OsLsi2	Lsi3	Orchestration of three transporters and distinct vascular structures in node for intervascular transfer of silicon in rice.	 Similar to Lsi6, knockout of Lsi2 and Lsi3 also resulted in decreased distribution of Si to the panicles but increased Si to the flag leaf
