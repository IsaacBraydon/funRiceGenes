NA	LABA1, a Domestication Gene Associated with Long, Barbed Awns in Wild Rice.	2015	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, National Center for Evaluation of Agricultural Wild Plants (Rice), Beijing Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Department of Plant Genetics and Breeding, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.	Common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), the wild relative of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa), flaunts long, barbed awns, which are necessary for efficient propagation and dissemination of seeds. By contrast, O. sativa cultivars have been selected to be awnless or to harbor short, barbless awns, which facilitate seed processing and storage. The transition from long, barbed awns to short, barbless awns was a crucial event in rice domestication. Here, we show that the presence of long, barbed awns in wild rice is controlled by a major gene on chromosome 4, LONG AND BARBED AWN1 (LABA1), which encodes a cytokinin-activating enzyme. A frame-shift deletion in LABA1 of cultivated rice reduces the cytokinin concentration in awn primordia, disrupting barb formation and awn elongation. Sequencing analysis demonstrated low nucleotide diversity and a selective sweep encompassing an âˆ¼800-kb region around the derived laba1 allele in cultivated rice. Haplotype analysis revealed that the laba1 allele originated in the japonica subspecies and moved into the indica gene pool via introgression, suggesting that humans selected for this locus in early rice domestication. Identification of LABA1 provides new insights into rice domestication and also sheds light on the molecular mechanism underlying awn development.
NA	An-2 Encodes a Cytokinin Synthesis Enzyme That Regulates Awn Length and Grain Production in Rice.	2015	Mol Plant	National Center for Gene Research, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China.	A wide range of morphological and physiological traits have been changed between cultivated rice Oryza sativa and wild rice Oryza rufipogon under domestication. Here we report the cloning of An-2 gene, encoding a Lonely Guy Like protein 6 (OsLOGL6), which catalyzes the final step of cytokinin synthesis in O.rufipogon. The near-isogenic line harboring a wild allele An-2 in the genetic background of the awnless indica Guangluai 4 shows that An-2 promote awn elongation by enhancing cell division, but decreases grain production by reducing grains per panicle and tillers per plant. We reveal that a genetic variation in the An-2 locus has a large impact on reducing awn length and increasing tiller and grain numbers in domesticated rice. Expressional analysis demonstrates that An-1 regulates the formation of awn primordial, and An-2 promotes awn elongation. Nucleotide diversity of An-2 locus in cultivated rice was found to be significantly reduced compared to that of wild rice, suggesting that An-2 locus was subjected to artificial selection. We therefore proposed that the selection of the genetic variation in An-2 was due to reduced awn length and increased grain yield in cultivated rice.
