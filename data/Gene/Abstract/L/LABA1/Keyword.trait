LABA1|OsLOGL6|An-2	domestication	LABA1, a Domestication Gene Associated with Long, Barbed Awns in Wild Rice.	 Haplotype analysis revealed that the laba1 allele originated in the japonica subspecies and moved into the indica gene pool via introgression, suggesting that humans selected for this locus in early rice domestication
LABA1|OsLOGL6|An-2	domestication	LABA1, a Domestication Gene Associated with Long, Barbed Awns in Wild Rice.	 Identification of LABA1 provides new insights into rice domestication and also sheds light on the molecular mechanism underlying awn development
LABA1|OsLOGL6|An-2	development	LABA1, a Domestication Gene Associated with Long, Barbed Awns in Wild Rice.	 Identification of LABA1 provides new insights into rice domestication and also sheds light on the molecular mechanism underlying awn development
LABA1|OsLOGL6|An-2	 awn 	LABA1, a Domestication Gene Associated with Long, Barbed Awns in Wild Rice.	 A frame-shift deletion in LABA1 of cultivated rice reduces the cytokinin concentration in awn primordia, disrupting barb formation and awn elongation
LABA1|OsLOGL6|An-2	 awn 	LABA1, a Domestication Gene Associated with Long, Barbed Awns in Wild Rice.	 Identification of LABA1 provides new insights into rice domestication and also sheds light on the molecular mechanism underlying awn development
LABA1|OsLOGL6|An-2	cytokinin	LABA1, a Domestication Gene Associated with Long, Barbed Awns in Wild Rice.	 A frame-shift deletion in LABA1 of cultivated rice reduces the cytokinin concentration in awn primordia, disrupting barb formation and awn elongation
