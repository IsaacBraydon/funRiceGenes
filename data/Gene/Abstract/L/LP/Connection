EP3|LP	Gn1a|OsCKX2	Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice	Quantitative real-time PCR results show that OsCKX2, which encodes cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase, is down-regulated evidently in mutants, implying that LP might be involved in modulating cytokinin level in plant tissues
