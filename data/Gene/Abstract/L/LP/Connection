EP3|LP	Gn1a|OsCKX2	Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice	Quantitative real-time PCR results show that OsCKX2, which encodes cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase, is down-regulated evidently in mutants, implying that LP might be involved in modulating cytokinin level in plant tissues
EP3|LP	OsPIN2|LRA1	Overexpression of OsPIN2 Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice.	 In this study, phenotypic and genetic analyses were undertaken to explore the role of OsPIN2, an auxin efflux transporter, in regulating the growth and development of rice roots under normal nutrition condition (control) and low-phosphate condition (LP)
EP3|LP	OsPIN2|LRA1	Overexpression of OsPIN2 Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice.	 Higher expression of OsPIN2 was observed in rice plants under LP compared to the control
EP3|LP	OsPIN2|LRA1	Overexpression of OsPIN2 Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice.	 Compared to WT plants, overexpression of OsPIN2 had a shorter root length through decreased root cell elongation under control and LP
EP3|LP	OsPIN2|LRA1	Overexpression of OsPIN2 Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice.	 Surprisingly, overexpression of OsPIN2 might increase auxin distribution in epidermis of root, resulting in greater RH formation but less LR development in OE plants than in WT plants in the control condition but levels similar of these under LP
EP3|LP	OsPIN2|LRA1	Overexpression of OsPIN2 Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice.	 These results suggest that higher OsPIN2 expression regulates rice root growth and development maybe by changing auxin distribution in roots under LP condition
