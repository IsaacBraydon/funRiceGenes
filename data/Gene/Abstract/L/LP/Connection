EP3|LP	Gn1a|OsCKX2	Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice	Quantitative real-time PCR results show that OsCKX2, which encodes cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase, is down-regulated evidently in mutants, implying that LP might be involved in modulating cytokinin level in plant tissues
EP3|LP	OsPIN2|LRA1	Overexpression of OsPIN2 Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice.	 In this study, phenotypic and genetic analyses were undertaken to explore the role of OsPIN2, an auxin efflux transporter, in regulating the growth and development of rice roots under normal nutrition condition (control) and low-phosphate condition (LP)
EP3|LP	OsPIN2|LRA1	Overexpression of OsPIN2 Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice.	 Higher expression of OsPIN2 was observed in rice plants under LP compared to the control
EP3|LP	OsPIN2|LRA1	Overexpression of OsPIN2 Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice.	 Compared to WT plants, overexpression of OsPIN2 had a shorter root length through decreased root cell elongation under control and LP
EP3|LP	OsPIN2|LRA1	Overexpression of OsPIN2 Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice.	 Surprisingly, overexpression of OsPIN2 might increase auxin distribution in epidermis of root, resulting in greater RH formation but less LR development in OE plants than in WT plants in the control condition but levels similar of these under LP
EP3|LP	OsPIN2|LRA1	Overexpression of OsPIN2 Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice.	 These results suggest that higher OsPIN2 expression regulates rice root growth and development maybe by changing auxin distribution in roots under LP condition
EP3|LP	GF14b|OsGF14b	Rice G protein ¦Ã subunit qPE9-1 modulates root elongation for phosphorus uptake by involving 14-3-3 protein OsGF14b and plasma membrane H + -ATPase	 Moreover, the overexpression of OsGF14b in WYJ8 (carrying the qpe9-1 allele) partially increased primary root length under LP conditions
EP3|LP	OsFBK1	The Rice EP3 and OsFBK1 E3 ligases alter plant architecture and flower development, and affect transcript accumulation of microRNA pathway genes and their targets.	The Rice EP3 and OsFBK1 E3 ligases alter plant architecture and flower development, and affect transcript accumulation of microRNA pathway genes and their targets.
EP3|LP	OsFBK1	The Rice EP3 and OsFBK1 E3 ligases alter plant architecture and flower development, and affect transcript accumulation of microRNA pathway genes and their targets.	ERECTA PANICLE 3 (EP3) and ORYZA SATIVA F-BOX KELCH 1 (OsFBK1) proteins share 57% and 54% sequence identity with the Arabidopsis F-box protein HAWAIIAN SKIRT (HWS)
EP3|LP	OsFBK1	The Rice EP3 and OsFBK1 E3 ligases alter plant architecture and flower development, and affect transcript accumulation of microRNA pathway genes and their targets.	 Here we demonstrate that OsFBK1 is another functional orthologue of HWS and show the complexity of interaction between EP3 and OsFBK1 genes at different developmental stages of the plant
EP3|LP	OsFBK1	The Rice EP3 and OsFBK1 E3 ligases alter plant architecture and flower development, and affect transcript accumulation of microRNA pathway genes and their targets.	 qRT-PCR expression analyses and studies of EP3-GFP and OsFBK1-RFP promoter reporter lines demonstrate that although EP3 and OsFBK1 expression can be detected in the same tissues some cells exclusively express EP3 or OsFBK1 whilst others co-express both genes
EP3|LP	OsFBK1	The Rice EP3 and OsFBK1 E3 ligases alter plant architecture and flower development, and affect transcript accumulation of microRNA pathway genes and their targets.	 Loss, reduction or gain of function lines for EP3 and OsFBK1, show that EP3 and OsFBK1 affect plant architecture, organ size, floral organ number and size, floral morphology, pollen viability, grain size and weight
EP3|LP	OsFBK1	The Rice EP3 and OsFBK1 E3 ligases alter plant architecture and flower development, and affect transcript accumulation of microRNA pathway genes and their targets.	 We have identified the putative orthologue genes of the rice microRNA pathway for ORYZA SATIVA DAWDLE (OsDDL) and ORYZA SATIVA SERRATE (OsSE), and demonstrated that EP3 and OsFBK1 affect their transcript levels as well as those of CROWN ROOT DEFECT 1/ORYZA SATIVA Exportin-5 HASTY (CRD1/OsHST), ORYZA SATIVA DICER-LIKE 1 (OsDCL) and ORYZA SATIVA WEAVY LEAF1 (OsWAF1)
EP3|LP	OsFBK1	The Rice EP3 and OsFBK1 E3 ligases alter plant architecture and flower development, and affect transcript accumulation of microRNA pathway genes and their targets.	 OsNAC1 transcripts are modified by OsFBK1, suggesting two independent regulatory pathways, one via EP3 and OsMIR164 and the other via OsFBK1
EP3|LP	OsFBK1	The Rice EP3 and OsFBK1 E3 ligases alter plant architecture and flower development, and affect transcript accumulation of microRNA pathway genes and their targets.	 Our data propose EP3 and OsFBK1 conjointly play similar roles in rice as HWS does in Arabidopsis
