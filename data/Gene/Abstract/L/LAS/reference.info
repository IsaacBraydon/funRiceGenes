NA	Lethal albinic seedling, encoding a threonyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in development of plastid protein synthesis system in rice.	2017	Plant Cell Rep	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	An albinic rice is caused by mutation of threonyl-tRNA synthetase, which is essential for plant development by stabilizing of NEP and PEP gene expressions and chloroplast protein synthesis. Chloroplast biogenesis and development depend on complex genetic mechanisms. Apart from their function in translation, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) play additional role in gene expression regulation, RNA splicing, and cytokine activity. However, their detailed functions in plant development are still poorly understood. We isolated a lethal albinic seedling (las) mutant in rice. Physiological and ultrastructural analysis of las mutant plants revealed weak chlorophyll fluorescence, negligible chlorophyll accumulation, and defective thylakoid membrane development. By map based cloning we determined that the LAS allele gene encodes threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS). LAS was constitutively expressed with relatively high level in leaves. NEP-dependent gene transcripts accumulated in the developing chloroplasts, while PEP-dependent transcripts were reduced in the las mutant. This result indicated that PEP activity was impaired. Chloroplast-encoded protein levels were sharply reduced in the las mutant. Biogenesis of chloroplast rRNAs (16S and 23S rRNA) was arrested, leading to impaired translation and protein synthesis. Together, our findings indicated that LAS is essential not only for chloroplast development by stabilizing the NEP and PEP gene expression, but also for protein synthesis and construction of the ribosome system in rice chloroplasts.
NA	Rice TSV2 encoding threonyl-tRNA synthetase is needed for early chloroplast development and seedling growth under cold stress.	College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China.	G3 (Bethesda)	Threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS), one of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs), plays a crucial role in protein synthesis. However, the AARS functions on rice chloroplast development and growth were not fully appraised. In this study, a thermo-sensitive virescent mutant tsv2, which showed albino phenotype and lethal after the 4-leaf stage at 20°C but recovered to normal when the temperatures rose, was identified and characterized. Map-based cloning and complementation tests showed that TSV2 encoded a chloroplast-located ThrRS protein in rice. The Lys-to-Arg mutation in the anticodon-binding domain hampered chloroplast development under cold stress, while the loss of function of the ThrRS core domain in TSV2 fatally led to seedling death regardless of growing temperatures. In addition, TSV2 had a specific expression in early leaves. Its disruption obviously resulted in the downregulation of certain genes associated with chlorophyll biosynthesis, photosynthesis, and chloroplast development at cold conditions. Our observations revealed that rice nuclear-encoded TSV2 plays an important role in chloroplast development at the early leaf stage under cold stress.	NA
