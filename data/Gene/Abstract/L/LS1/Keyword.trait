LS1	leaf	DNA damage and reactive oxygen species cause cell death in the rice local lesions 1 mutant under high light and high temperature.	 DNA damage caused by HLHT stress induces ROS accumulation, which causes the injury and apoptosis of leaf cells in the ls1 mutant
LS1	map-based cloning	DNA damage and reactive oxygen species cause cell death in the rice local lesions 1 mutant under high light and high temperature.	 <U+2022> We characterized and cloned LS1 by map-based cloning and genetic complementation
LS1	stress	DNA damage and reactive oxygen species cause cell death in the rice local lesions 1 mutant under high light and high temperature.	 TUNEL and comet assays indicated that mutation of LS1 led to severe DNA damage under HLHT stress
LS1	stress	DNA damage and reactive oxygen species cause cell death in the rice local lesions 1 mutant under high light and high temperature.	 Furthermore, we found excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in the ls1 mutant under HLHT stress
LS1	stress	DNA damage and reactive oxygen species cause cell death in the rice local lesions 1 mutant under high light and high temperature.	 DNA damage caused by HLHT stress induces ROS accumulation, which causes the injury and apoptosis of leaf cells in the ls1 mutant
LS1	reactive oxygen species	DNA damage and reactive oxygen species cause cell death in the rice local lesions 1 mutant under high light and high temperature.	 Furthermore, we found excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in the ls1 mutant under HLHT stress
