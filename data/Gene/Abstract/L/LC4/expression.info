LC4	 Suppressed expression of miR394, or enhanced expression of LC4, results in enlarged leaf angles, whereas reducing LC4 expression by CRISPR/Cas9 leads to reduced leaf inclination, suggesting LC4 as candidate for use in rice architecture improvement |  Rice plants with altered expression of miR394 or LC4 have altered auxin responses, indicating that the miR394-LC4 module mediates auxin effects important for determining rice leaf inclination and architecture
