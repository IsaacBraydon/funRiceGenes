LC4	leaf	Rice miR394 suppresses leaf inclination through targeting an F-box gene, LEAF INCLINATION 4.	 We show that miR394 and LC4 work, antagonistically, to regulate leaf lamina joint development and rice architecture, by modulating expansion and elongation of adaxial parenchyma cells
LC4	leaf	Rice miR394 suppresses leaf inclination through targeting an F-box gene, LEAF INCLINATION 4.	 Suppressed expression of miR394, or enhanced expression of LC4, results in enlarged leaf angles, whereas reducing LC4 expression by CRISPR/Cas9 leads to reduced leaf inclination, suggesting LC4 as candidate for use in rice architecture improvement
LC4	leaf	Rice miR394 suppresses leaf inclination through targeting an F-box gene, LEAF INCLINATION 4.	 Rice plants with altered expression of miR394 or LC4 have altered auxin responses, indicating that the miR394-LC4 module mediates auxin effects important for determining rice leaf inclination and architecture
LC4	auxin	Rice miR394 suppresses leaf inclination through targeting an F-box gene, LEAF INCLINATION 4.	 LC4 interacts with SKP1, a component of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and transcription of both miR394 and LC4 are regulated by auxin
LC4	auxin	Rice miR394 suppresses leaf inclination through targeting an F-box gene, LEAF INCLINATION 4.	 Rice plants with altered expression of miR394 or LC4 have altered auxin responses, indicating that the miR394-LC4 module mediates auxin effects important for determining rice leaf inclination and architecture
LC4	development	Rice miR394 suppresses leaf inclination through targeting an F-box gene, LEAF INCLINATION 4.	 We show that miR394 and LC4 work, antagonistically, to regulate leaf lamina joint development and rice architecture, by modulating expansion and elongation of adaxial parenchyma cells
LC4	architecture	Rice miR394 suppresses leaf inclination through targeting an F-box gene, LEAF INCLINATION 4.	 Suppressed expression of miR394, or enhanced expression of LC4, results in enlarged leaf angles, whereas reducing LC4 expression by CRISPR/Cas9 leads to reduced leaf inclination, suggesting LC4 as candidate for use in rice architecture improvement

LC4	lamina	Rice miR394 suppresses leaf inclination through targeting an F-box gene, LEAF INCLINATION 4.	 We show that miR394 and LC4 work, antagonistically, to regulate leaf lamina joint development and rice architecture, by modulating expansion and elongation of adaxial parenchyma cells
LC4	Ubiquitin	Rice miR394 suppresses leaf inclination through targeting an F-box gene, LEAF INCLINATION 4.	 LC4 interacts with SKP1, a component of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and transcription of both miR394 and LC4 are regulated by auxin
LC4	lamina joint	Rice miR394 suppresses leaf inclination through targeting an F-box gene, LEAF INCLINATION 4.	 We show that miR394 and LC4 work, antagonistically, to regulate leaf lamina joint development and rice architecture, by modulating expansion and elongation of adaxial parenchyma cells
LC4	leaf angle	Rice miR394 suppresses leaf inclination through targeting an F-box gene, LEAF INCLINATION 4.	 Suppressed expression of miR394, or enhanced expression of LC4, results in enlarged leaf angles, whereas reducing LC4 expression by CRISPR/Cas9 leads to reduced leaf inclination, suggesting LC4 as candidate for use in rice architecture improvement
