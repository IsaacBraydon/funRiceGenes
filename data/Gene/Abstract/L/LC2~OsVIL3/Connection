LC2|OsVIL3	OsLF	LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF	 Interestingly, LC2 binds to the promoter region of a floral repressor OsLF and represses the OsLF expression via H3K27 tri-methylation modification|LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF
LC2|OsVIL3	OsVIL2	LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF	 Here we demonstrated that rice LC2 (OsVIL3) and OsVIL2 (two OsVILs, possible components of PRC2 complex) promote rice flowering| Our results showed that expressions of LC2 and OsVIL2 are induced by SD (short-day) conditions and both lc2 mutant and OsVIL2-RNAi lines display delayed heading date, consistent with the reduced expression levels of Hd1 and Hd3a|LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF
