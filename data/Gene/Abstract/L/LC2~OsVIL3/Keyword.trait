LC2|OsVIL3	leaf development	Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar	 LC2 is mainly expressed in the lamina joint during leaf development, and particularly, is induced by the phytohormones abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, auxin, and brassinosteroids
LC2|OsVIL3	brassinosteroid	Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar	 LC2 is mainly expressed in the lamina joint during leaf development, and particularly, is induced by the phytohormones abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, auxin, and brassinosteroids
LC2|OsVIL3	vernalization	Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar	 The LC2 gene was isolated through positional cloning, and encodes a vernalization insensitive 3-like protein
LC2|OsVIL3	phytohormone	Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar	 LC2 is mainly expressed in the lamina joint during leaf development, and particularly, is induced by the phytohormones abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, auxin, and brassinosteroids
LC2|OsVIL3	flower	LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF	 Here we demonstrated that rice LC2 (OsVIL3) and OsVIL2 (two OsVILs, possible components of PRC2 complex) promote rice flowering
LC2|OsVIL3	floral	LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF	 Interestingly, LC2 binds to the promoter region of a floral repressor OsLF and represses the OsLF expression via H3K27 tri-methylation modification
LC2|OsVIL3	auxin	Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar	 LC2 is mainly expressed in the lamina joint during leaf development, and particularly, is induced by the phytohormones abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, auxin, and brassinosteroids
LC2|OsVIL3	flower	LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF	 Here we demonstrated that rice LC2 (OsVIL3) and OsVIL2 (two OsVILs, possible components of PRC2 complex) promote rice flowering| These results first demonstrated that the putative PRC2 in rice is involved in photoperiod flowering regulation, which is different from that of Arabidopsis, and revealed that LC2 binds the promoter region of target gene, presenting a possible mechanism of the recruitment process of PRC2 complex to its target genes|LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF
LC2|OsVIL3	leaf	Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar	 To understand the molecular mechanism controlling rice leaf angles, one rice leaf inclination2 (lc2, three alleles) mutant was identified and functionally characterized| Compared to wild-type plants, lc2 mutants have enlarged leaf angles due to increased cell division in the adaxial epidermis of lamina joint| Complementary expression of LC2 reversed the enlarged leaf angles of lc2 plants, confirming its role in controlling leaf inclination| LC2 is mainly expressed in the lamina joint during leaf development, and particularly, is induced by the phytohormones abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, auxin, and brassinosteroids| LC2 is localized in the nucleus and defects of LC2 result in altered expression of cell division and hormone-responsive genes, indicating an important role of LC2 in regulating leaf inclination and mediating hormone effects
LC2|OsVIL3	cell division	Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar	 Compared to wild-type plants, lc2 mutants have enlarged leaf angles due to increased cell division in the adaxial epidermis of lamina joint| LC2 is localized in the nucleus and defects of LC2 result in altered expression of cell division and hormone-responsive genes, indicating an important role of LC2 in regulating leaf inclination and mediating hormone effects
LC2|OsVIL3	heading date	LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF	 Our results showed that expressions of LC2 and OsVIL2 are induced by SD (short-day) conditions and both lc2 mutant and OsVIL2-RNAi lines display delayed heading date, consistent with the reduced expression levels of Hd1 and Hd3a
LC2|OsVIL3	lamina	Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar	 Compared to wild-type plants, lc2 mutants have enlarged leaf angles due to increased cell division in the adaxial epidermis of lamina joint| LC2 is mainly expressed in the lamina joint during leaf development, and particularly, is induced by the phytohormones abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, auxin, and brassinosteroids
