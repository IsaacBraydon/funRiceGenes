Lsi1|OsNIP2;1|OsLsi1	 High S treatment also reduced the expression of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2, the potent transporters of As in rice
Lsi1|OsNIP2;1|OsLsi1	 Herein we investigated the mechanism underlying regulation of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 expression |  There was a negative correlation between the expression level of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 and shoot Si accumulation when the rice seedlings were exposed to different Si supply conditions |  A split root experiment showed that the expression of both OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 was also down-regulated in half the roots without direct Si exposure when the other half roots were exposed to Si |  Analysis with transgenic rice carrying different lengths of OsLsi1 promoter regions fused with GFP as a reporter gene revealed that the region responsible for Si response of OsLsi1 expression is present between -327 to -292 in the promoter |  In conclusion, the Si-induced down-regulation of Si transporter genes is controlled by shoot Si, not root Si, and that the region between -327 to -292 in the OsLsi1 promoter is involved in this regulation of OsLsi1 expression in rice

Lsi1|OsNIP2;1|OsLsi1	 Interestingly, NsLsi1P125F displayed a significant gain of function (threefold increase in Si influx relative to NsLsi1WT), which coincided with a threefold increase in plasma membrane localization in planta, as measured by transient expression of GFP constructs in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves
Lsi1|OsNIP2;1|OsLsi1	 The expression level of some transporter genes including OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 for Si uptake and OsNramp5 for Mn uptake was significantly decreased in the mutant compared with the wild-type rice
Lsi1|OsNIP2;1|OsLsi1	 Moreover, results obtained from root split experiment using lsi1 WT showed down-regulated expression of Si transport genes (OsLsi1 and OsLsi2) in root accelerated Si deposition at root endodermis |  In summary, our results reveal that Si deposition at root endodermis and its resultant reduction of Na+ bypass flow is modulated by OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 and regulated by the expression of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2, implying that root Si deposition could be an active and physiologically-regulated process in rice
