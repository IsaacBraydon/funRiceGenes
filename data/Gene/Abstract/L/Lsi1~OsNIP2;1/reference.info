The rice (Oryza sativa) silicon transporter Lsi1 (OsNIP2;1, an aquaporin channel) is the major entry route of arsenite into rice roots. Whether Lsi1 also mediates arsenite efflux was investigated. *Expression of Lsi1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes enhanced arsenite efflux, indicating that Lsi1 facilitates arsenite transport bidirectionally. *Arsenite was the predominant arsenic species in arsenate-exposed rice plants. During 24-h exposure to 5 mum arsenate, rice roots extruded arsenite to the external medium rapidly, accounting for 60-90% of the arsenate uptake. A rice mutant defective in Lsi1 (lsi1) extruded significantly less arsenite than the wild-type rice and, as a result, accumulated more arsenite in the roots. By contrast, Lsi2 mutation had little effect on arsenite efflux to the external medium. *We conclude that Lsi1 plays a role in arsenite efflux in rice roots exposed to arsenate. However, this pathway accounts for only 15-20% of the total efflux, suggesting the existence of other efflux transporters.
nature04590.pdf	A silicon transporter in rice	2006	Nature	Research Institute for Bioresources, Okayama University, Chuo 2-20-1, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan. maj@rib.okayama-u.ac.jp	Silicon is beneficial to plant growth and helps plants to overcome abiotic and biotic stresses by preventing lodging (falling over) and increasing resistance to pests and diseases, as well as other stresses. Silicon is essential for high and sustainable production of rice, but the molecular mechanism responsible for the uptake of silicon is unknown. Here we describe the Low silicon rice 1 (Lsi1) gene, which controls silicon accumulation in rice, a typical silicon-accumulating plant. This gene belongs to the aquaporin family and is constitutively expressed in the roots. Lsi1 is localized on the plasma membrane of the distal side of both exodermis and endodermis cells, where casparian strips are located. Suppression of Lsi1 expression resulted in reduced silicon uptake. Furthermore, expression of Lsi1 in Xenopus oocytes showed transport activity for silicon only. The identification of a silicon transporter provides both an insight into the silicon uptake system in plants, and a new strategy for producing crops with high resistance to multiple stresses by genetic modification of the root's silicon uptake capacity.
nature05964.pdf	An efflux transporter of silicon in rice	2007	Nature	Research Institute for Bioresources, Okayama University, Chuo 2-20-1, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan. maj@rib.okayama-u.ac.jp	Silicon is an important nutrient for the optimal growth and sustainable production of rice. Rice accumulates up to 10% silicon in the shoot, and this high accumulation is required to protect the plant from multiple abiotic and biotic stresses. A gene, Lsi1, that encodes a silicon influx transporter has been identified in rice. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized gene, low silicon rice 2 (Lsi2), which has no similarity to Lsi1. This gene is constitutively expressed in the roots. The protein encoded by this gene is localized, like Lsi1, on the plasma membrane of cells in both the exodermis and the endodermis, but in contrast to Lsi1, which is localized on the distal side, Lsi2 is localized on the proximal side of the same cells. Expression of Lsi2 in Xenopus oocytes did not result in influx transport activity for silicon, but preloading of the oocytes with silicon resulted in a release of silicon, indicating that Lsi2 is a silicon efflux transporter. The identification of this silicon transporter revealed a unique mechanism of nutrient transport in plants: having an influx transporter on one side and an efflux transporter on the other side of the cell to permit the effective transcellular transport of the nutrients.
Plant Physiol.-2007-Ma-919-24.pdf	Genotypic difference in silicon uptake and expression of silicon transporter genes in rice	2007	Plant Physiol	Research Institute for Bioresources, Okayama University, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan. maj@rib.okayama-u.ac.jp	Rice (Oryza sativa) is a highly silicon (Si)-accumulating species that shows genotypic differences in Si accumulation. We investigated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in the genotypic difference in Si uptake between the japonica var. Nipponbare and the indica var. Kasalath. Both the Si concentration in the shoot and the Si uptake per root dry weight were higher in Nipponbare than in Kasalath grown in either soil or nutrient solution. The Si uptake by a single root was also higher in Nipponbare than in Kasalath. A kinetics study showed that Nipponbare and Kasalath had a similar K(m) value, whereas the V(max) was higher in Nipponbare. The expression of two Si transporter genes (Low silicon rice 1 [Lsi1] and Lsi2) investigated using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed higher expression of both genes in Nipponbare than in Kasalath. Immunostaining with Lsi1 and Lsi2 antibodies revealed a similar pattern of subcellular localization of these two Si transporters in both varieties; Lsi1 and Lsi2 were localized at the distal and proximal sides, respectively, of both exodermis and endodermis of the roots. These results revealed that the genotypic difference in the Si accumulation results from the difference in abundance of Si transporters in rice roots.
Plant Physiol.-2007-Yamaji-1306-13.pdf	Spatial distribution and temporal variation of the rice silicon transporter Lsi1	2007	Plant Physiol	Research Institute for Bioresources, Okayama University, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan.	Rice (Oryza sativa) is a typical silicon (Si) accumulator and requires a large amount of Si for high-yield production. Recently, a gene (Low silicon rice1 [Lsi1]) encoding a Si transporter was identified in rice roots. Here, we characterized Lsi1 in terms of spatial distribution and temporal variation using both physiological and molecular approaches. Results from a multicompartment transport box experiment showed that the major site for Si uptake was located at the basal zone (>10 mm from the root tip) of the roots rather than at the root tips (<10 mm from the root tip). Consistent with the Si uptake pattern, Lsi1 expression and distribution of the Lsi1 protein were found only in the basal zone of roots. In the basal zones of the seminal, crown, and lateral roots, the Lsi1 protein showed a polar localization at the distal side of both the exodermis and endodermis, where the Casparian bands are formed. This indicates that Lsi1 is required for the transport of Si through the cells of the exodermis and endodermis. Expression of Lsi1 displayed a distinct diurnal pattern. Furthermore, expression was transiently enhanced around the heading stage, which coincides with a high Si requirement during this growth stage. Expression was down-regulated by dehydration stress and abscisic acid, suggesting that expression of Lsi1 may be regulated by abscisic acid.
Plant Physiol.-2009-Li-2071-80.pdf	The rice aquaporin Lsi1 mediates uptake of methylated arsenic species	2009	Plant Physiol	Rothamsted Research, Harpenden, Hertfordshire AL5 2JQ, United Kingdom.	Pentavalent methylated arsenic (As) species such as monomethylarsonic acid [MMA(V)] and dimethylarsinic acid [DMA(V)] are used as herbicides or pesticides, and can also be synthesized by soil microorganisms or algae through As methylation. The mechanism of MMA(V) and DMA(V) uptake remains unknown. Recent studies have shown that arsenite is taken up by rice (Oryza sativa) roots through two silicon transporters, Lsi1 (the aquaporin NIP2;1) and Lsi2 (an efflux carrier). Here we investigated whether these two transporters also mediate the uptake of MMA(V) and DMA(V). MMA(V) was partly reduced to trivalent MMA(III) in rice roots, but only MMA(V) was translocated to shoots. DMA(V) was stable in plants. The rice lsi1 mutant lost about 80% and 50% of the uptake capacity for MMA(V) and DMA(V), respectively, compared with the wild-type rice, whereas Lsi2 mutation had little effect. The short-term uptake kinetics of MMA(V) can be described by a Michaelis-Menten plus linear model, with the wild type having 3.5-fold higher V(max) than the lsi1 mutant. The uptake kinetics of DMA(V) were linear with the slope being 2.8-fold higher in the wild type than the lsi1 mutant. Heterologous expression of Lsi1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes significantly increased the uptake of MMA(V) but not DMA(V), possibly because of a very limited uptake of the latter. Uptake of MMA(V) and DMA(V) by wild-type rice was increased as the pH of the medium decreased, consistent with an increasing proportion of the undissociated species. The results demonstrate that Lsi1 mediates the uptake of undissociated methylated As in rice roots.
Plant Physiol.-2010-Zhao-pp.110.157867.pdf	Involvement of silicon influx transporter OsNIP2;1 in selenite uptake in rice	2010	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 210008 Nanjing, China.	Rice (Oryza sativa) as a staple food, provides a major source of dietary selenium (Se) for humans, which essentially requires Se, however, the molecular mechanism for Se uptake is still poorly understood. Herein, we show evidence that the uptake of selenite, a main bioavailable form of Se in paddy soils, is mediated by a silicon (Si) influx transporter Lsi1 (OsNIP2;1) in rice. Defect of OsNIP2;1 resulted in a significant decrease in the Se concentration of the shoots and xylem sap when selenite was given. However, there was no difference in the Se concentration between the wild-type rice and mutant of OsNIP2;1 when selenate was supplied. A short-term uptake experiment showed that selenite uptake greatly increased with decreasing pH in the external solution. Si as silicic acid did not inhibit the Se uptake from selenite in both rice and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) at low pHs. Expression of OsNIP2;1 in yeast enhanced the selenite uptake at pH 3.5 and 5.5 but not at pH 7.5. On the other hand, defect of Si efflux transporter Lsi2 did not affect the uptake of Se either from selenite or selenate. Taken together, our results indicate that Si influx transporter OsNIP2;1 is permeable to selenite.
PNAS-2008-Ma-9931-5.pdf	Transporters of arsenite in rice and their role in arsenic accumulation in rice grain	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Research Institute for Bioresources, Okayama University, Chuo 2-20-1, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan. maj@rib.okayama-u.ac.jp	Arsenic poisoning affects millions of people worldwide. Human arsenic intake from rice consumption can be substantial because rice is particularly efficient in assimilating arsenic from paddy soils, although the mechanism has not been elucidated. Here we report that two different types of transporters mediate transport of arsenite, the predominant form of arsenic in paddy soil, from the external medium to the xylem. Transporters belonging to the NIP subfamily of aquaporins in rice are permeable to arsenite but not to arsenate. Mutation in OsNIP2;1 (Lsi1, a silicon influx transporter) significantly decreases arsenite uptake. Furthermore, in the rice mutants defective in the silicon efflux transporter Lsi2, arsenite transport to the xylem and accumulation in shoots and grain decreased greatly. Mutation in Lsi2 had a much greater impact on arsenic accumulation in shoots and grain in field-grown rice than Lsi1. Arsenite transport in rice roots therefore shares the same highly efficient pathway as silicon, which explains why rice is efficient in arsenic accumulation. Our results provide insight into the uptake mechanism of arsenite in rice and strategies for reducing arsenic accumulation in grain for enhanced food safety.
NA	Reduced arsenic accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa L.) shoot involves sulfur mediated improved thiol metabolism, antioxidant system and altered arsenic transporters.	2015	Plant Physiol Biochem	CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow 226001, Uttar Pradesh, India.	Arsenic (As) contamination in rice is at alarming level as majority of rice growing regions are As contaminated such as South East Asia. Restricting the As in aerial parts of rice plant may be an effective strategy to reduce As contamination in food chain. Sulfur (S), an essential element for plant growth and development, plays a crucial role in diminishing heavy metal toxicity. Current study is designed to investigate the role of S to mitigate As toxicity in rice under different S regimes. High S (5 mM) treatment resulted in enhanced root As accumulation as well as prevented its entry in to shoot. Results of thiol metabolism indicate that As was complexed in plant roots through enhanced synthesis of phytochelatins. High S treatment also reduced the expression of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2, the potent transporters of As in rice. High S treatment enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes and mitigated the As induced oxidative stress. Thus from present study it is evident that proper supply of S nutrition may be helpful in prevention of As accumulation in aerial parts of plant as well as As induced toxicity.
NA	High silicon accumulation in the shoot is required for down-regulating the expression of Si transporter genes in rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Chuo 2-20-1, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan.	Rice requires high silicon (Si) for its high and sustainable yield. The efficient uptake of Si in rice is mediated by two transporters OsLsi1 and OsLsi2, which function as influx and efflux transporters, respectively. Our previous studies showed that the mRNA expression levels of these transporter genes were down-regulated by Si. Herein we investigated the mechanism underlying regulation of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 expression. There was a negative correlation between the expression level of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 and shoot Si accumulation when the rice seedlings were exposed to different Si supply conditions. A split root experiment showed that the expression of both OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 was also down-regulated in half the roots without direct Si exposure when the other half roots were exposed to Si. Analysis with transgenic rice carrying different lengths of OsLsi1 promoter regions fused with GFP as a reporter gene revealed that the region responsible for Si response of OsLsi1 expression is present between -327 to -292 in the promoter. However, this region was not associated with the tissue and cellular localization of OsLsi1. In conclusion, the Si-induced down-regulation of Si transporter genes is controlled by shoot Si, not root Si, and that the region between -327 to -292 in the OsLsi1 promoter is involved in this regulation of OsLsi1 expression in rice.

NA	Overexpression of Lsi1 in cold-sensitive rice mediates transcriptional regulatory networks and enhances resistance to chilling stress	2017	Plant Science	Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Agroecological Processing and Safety Monitoring, College of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 35002, PR China	Frequent cold spells in late spring can damage early rice seedlings. However, overexpression of the silicon-uptake gene Lsi1 (Lsi1-OX) in cold-sensitive rice (Oryza sativa L., accession: Dular) notably enhances its chilling resistance. In this study, we found that continual chilling led to chlorophyll and RNA degradation in wild-type Dular leaves, whereas leaves from a Lsi1-OX line exhibited no obvious changes. A comparison of the global mRNA expression between the two rice lines showed that genes encoding photosynthesis-antenna proteins were downregulated and those encoding the proteasome were upregulated in the wild-type organism. Moreover, the differential responses of the two rice lines to chilling stress were found to correlate with the transcription factor OsWRKY53, which was predicted target of the respective microRNA (miRNA) novel-m0586-5p. In addition, miRNAs that targeted genes involved in the process of reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism were differentially expressed in the two rice lines after chilling stress, when comparative analysis of the outcomes of RNA sequencing on the two rice lines. Our results suggest that when overexpressed Lsi1 in cold-sensitive rice, it possibility regulates the transcription factor OsWRKY53 in addition to the genes involved in the ROS metabolism, thus mediating resistance to chilling stress.
