Lsi1|OsNIP2;1|OsLsi1	Lsi2|OsLsi2	An efflux transporter of silicon in rice	The protein encoded by this gene is localized, like Lsi1, on the plasma membrane of cells in both the exodermis and the endodermis, but in contrast to Lsi1, which is localized on the distal side, Lsi2 is localized on the proximal side of the same cells
Lsi1|OsNIP2;1|OsLsi1	Lsi2|OsLsi2	Genotypic difference in silicon uptake and expression of silicon transporter genes in rice	The expression of two Si transporter genes (Low silicon rice 1 [Lsi1] and Lsi2) investigated using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed higher expression of both genes in Nipponbare than in Kasalath
