OsLOX3|LOX3	Antisense suppression of LOX3 gene expression in rice endosperm enhances seed longevity. |  The molecular mechanism by which LOX3 expression is regulated during endosperm development remains unclear | ) plants to down-regulate LOX3 expression in rice endosperm |  The suppression of LOX3 expression in rice endosperm increased grain storability |  To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that decreased LOX3 expression can preserve rice grain quality during storage with no impact on grain yield, suggesting potential applications in agricultural production
