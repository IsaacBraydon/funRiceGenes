OsLOX3|LOX3	grain	Antisense suppression of LOX3 gene expression in rice endosperm enhances seed longevity.	Previous reports showed that grain from the rice variety DawDam in which the LOX3 gene was deleted had less stale flavour after grain storage than normal rice
OsLOX3|LOX3	grain	Antisense suppression of LOX3 gene expression in rice endosperm enhances seed longevity.	The suppression of LOX3 expression in rice endosperm increased grain storability
OsLOX3|LOX3	grain	Antisense suppression of LOX3 gene expression in rice endosperm enhances seed longevity.	To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that decreased LOX3 expression can preserve rice grain quality during storage with no impact on grain yield, suggesting potential applications in agricultural production
