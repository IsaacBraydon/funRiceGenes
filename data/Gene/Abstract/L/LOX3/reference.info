Marla-2012-LOX genes in blast f.pdf	LOX genes in blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) resistance in rice	2012	Funct Integr Genomics	Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering, G.B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar, India. soma.marla@nbpgr.ernet.in	Plant Lipoxygenases (LOX) are known to play major role in plant immunity by providing front-line defense against pathogen-induced injury. To verify this, we isolated a full-length OsLOX3 gene and also 12 OsLOX cDNA clones from Oryza sativa indica (cultivar Pusa Basmati 1). We have examined the role played by LOXs in plant development and during attack by blast pathogen Magnaporthe grisea. Gene expression, promoter region analysis, and biochemical and protein structure analysis of isolated OsLOX3 revealed significant homology with LOX super family. Protein sequence comparison of OsLOXs revealed high levels of homology when compared with japonica rice (up to100%) and Arabidopsis (up to 64%). Isolated LOX3 gene and 12 OsLOX cDNAs contained the catalytic LOX domains much required for oxygen binding and synthesis of oxylipins. Amino acid composition, protein secondary structure, and promoter region analysis (with abundance of motifs CGTCA and TGACG) support the role of OsLOX3 gene in providing resistance to diseases in rice plants. OsLOX3 gene expression analysis of root, shoot, flag leaf, and developing and mature seed revealed organ specific patterns during rice plant development and gave evidence to association between tissue location and physiological roles played by individual OsLOXs. Increased defense activity of oxylipins was observed as demonstrated by PCR amplification of OsLOX3 gene and upon inoculation with virulent strains of M. grisea and ectopic application of methyl jasmonate in the injured leaf tissue in adult rice plants.
NA	Antisense suppression of LOX3 gene expression in rice endosperm enhances seed longevity.	2014	Plant Biotechnol J	Rice Research Institute, Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Fuzhou, China; Incubator of National Key Laboratory of Fujian Crop Germplasm Innovation and Molecular Breeding between Fujian and Ministry of Sciences and Technology, Fuzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Germplasm Innovation and Molecular Breeding of Hybrid Rice for South China, Ministry of Agriculture, Fuzhou, China; South-China Base of National Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice of China, Fuzhou, China; National Engineering Laboratory of Rice, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.	Lipid peroxidation plays a major role in seed longevity and viability. In rice grains, lipid peroxidation is catalyzed by the enzyme lipoxygenase 3 (LOX3). Previous reports showed that grain from the rice variety DawDam in which the LOX3 gene was deleted had less stale flavour after grain storage than normal rice. The molecular mechanism by which LOX3 expression is regulated during endosperm development remains unclear. In this study, we expressed a LOX3 antisense construct in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants to down-regulate LOX3 expression in rice endosperm. The transgenic plants exhibited a marked decrease in LOX mRNA levels, normal phenotypes and a normal life cycle. We showed that LOX3 activity and its ability to produce 9-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (9-HPOD) from linoleic acid were significantly lower in transgenic seeds than in wild-type seeds by measuring the ultraviolet absorption of 9-HPOD at 234 nm and by high-performance liquid chromatography. The suppression of LOX3 expression in rice endosperm increased grain storability. The germination rate of TS-91 (antisense LOX3 transgenic line) was much higher than the WT (29% higher after artificial ageing for 21 days, and 40% higher after natural ageing for 12 months). To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that decreased LOX3 expression can preserve rice grain quality during storage with no impact on grain yield, suggesting potential applications in agricultural production.
NA	Marker-assisted breeding of a LOX-3-null rice line with improved storability and resistance to preharvest sprouting.	2015	Theor Appl Genet	NARO, Institute of Crop Science, 2-1-18 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8518, Japan, suzuyasu@affrc.go.jp.	Breakage of the tight linkage between rice seed lipoxygenase - 3 and easy preharvest sprouting trait led to breeding of lines with few stale flavors after long storage and desirable preharvest sprouting resistance. Lipoxygenase-3 (LOX-3) is involved in the production of volatile constituents in stored rice, and the development of stale flavor is delayed in LOX-3 null rice. In the process of breeding new LOX-3-null lines with long storability, we found a close association between LOX-3 and preharvest sprouting resistance. To determine whether this relationship was due to the tight linkage of two genes or the pleiotropic effect of LOX-3, we performed marker-assisted selection using a BC3F3 population derived from crosses between LOX-3-present/preharvest sprouting-resistant lines and LOX-3-null/preharvest susceptible lines. In one individual, a recombination event occurred 13 kb downstream of LOX-3 (RM15750) and a significant quantitative trait locus, namely qPHS3, for easy preharvest sprouting trait (LOD = 10.4) was detected in an 842-kb region between RM15711 and RM15768. Using BC3F4 and BC3F5 populations, we succeeded in selecting LOX-3-absent and preharvest sprouting-resistant lines with only a 393-kb introgressed chromosome segment from the donor line for LOX-3-null at the LOX-3 locus on chromosome 3. This result indicated that the LOX-3 gene and the locus affecting preharvest sprouting are distinct. The selected line was named 'Hokuriku 244'. Sensory testing of rice grains with and without LOX-3 confirmed that stale flavor production in LOX-3-null rice during storage was lower than in normal LOX-3 rice. These results indicated that rice varieties with little stale flavor after long storage and preharvest sprouting resistance had been selected.
