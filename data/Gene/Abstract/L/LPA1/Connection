LPA1	ONAC106	Rice ONAC106 inhibits leaf senescence and increases salt tolerance and tiller angle.	Using yeast one-hybrid assays, we found that ONAC106 binds to the promoter regions of SGR, NYC1, OsNAC5, and LPA1
D2|CYP90D2|SMG11|OsD2	LPA1	Loose Plant Architecture1 (LPA1) determines lamina joint bending by suppressing auxin signalling that interacts with C-22-hydroxylated and 6-deoxo brassinosteroids in rice.	A strong synergic effect is detected between lpa1 and d2 (the defective mutant for catalysis of C-23-hydroxylated BRs) during IAA-mediated lamina inclination
D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	LPA1	Loose Plant Architecture1 (LPA1) determines lamina joint bending by suppressing auxin signalling that interacts with C-22-hydroxylated and 6-deoxo brassinosteroids in rice.	Genetic and biochemical data indicate that LPA1 suppresses the auxin signalling that interacts with C-22-hydroxylated and 6-deoxo BRs, which regulates lamina inclination independently of OsBRI1
D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	LPA1	Loose Plant Architecture1 (LPA1) determines lamina joint bending by suppressing auxin signalling that interacts with C-22-hydroxylated and 6-deoxo brassinosteroids in rice.	No significant interaction between LPA1 and OsBRI1 was identified
LPA1	OsMRP5	Mutations of the multi-drug resistance-associated protein ABC transporter gene 5 result in reduction of phytic acid in rice seeds.	In this study, we mapped the XS-lpa2-1 gene to a region on chromosome 3 between microsatellite markers RM14360 and RM1332, where the rice orthologue (OsMRP5) of the maize lpa1 gene is located
D2|CYP90D2|SMG11|OsD2	LPA1	Narrow lpa1 Metaxylems Enhance Drought Tolerance and Optimize Water Use for Grain Filling in Dwarf Rice.	 However, the genetic combination of lpa1 with semi-dwarf mutant (dep1-ko or d2) offer optimal water supply and drought resistance without impacting grain-filling rates
