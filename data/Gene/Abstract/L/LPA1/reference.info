Plant Physiol.-2013-Wu-317-29.pdf	Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice	2013	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Tiller angle and leaf angle are two important components of rice (Oryza sativa) plant architecture that play a crucial role in determining grain yield. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of the Loose Plant Architecture1 (LPA1) gene in rice, the functional ortholog of the AtIDD15/SHOOT GRAVITROPISM5 (SGR5) gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). LPA1 regulates tiller angle and leaf angle by controlling the adaxial growth of tiller node and lamina joint. LPA1 was also found to affect shoot gravitropism. Expression pattern analysis suggested that LPA1 influences plant architecture by affecting the gravitropism of leaf sheath pulvinus and lamina joint. However, LPA1 only influences gravity perception or signal transduction in coleoptile gravitropism by regulating the sedimentation rate of amyloplasts, distinct from the actions of LAZY1. LPA1 encodes a plant-specific INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein and defines a novel subfamily of 28 INDETERMINATE DOMAIN proteins with several unique conserved features. LPA1 is localized in the nucleus and functions as an active transcriptional repressor, an activity mainly conferred by a conserved ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression-like motif. Further analysis suggests that LPA1 participates in a complicated transcriptional and protein interaction network and has evolved novel functions distinct from SGR5. This study not only facilitates the understanding of gravitropism mechanisms but also generates a useful genetic material for rice breeding.
NA	Loose Plant Architecture1 (LPA1) determines lamina joint bending by suppressing auxin signalling that interacts with C-22-hydroxylated and 6-deoxo brassinosteroids in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 Program), Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Research Center (PMBBRC), Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 660-701, Republic of Korea.	Lamina inclination is a key agronomical character that determines plant architecture and is sensitive to auxin and brassinosteroids (BRs). Loose Plant Architecture1 (LPA1) in rice (Oryza sativa) and its Arabidopsis homologues (SGR5/AtIDD15) have been reported to control plant architecture and auxin homeostasis. This study explores the role of LPA1 in determining lamina inclination in rice. LPA1 acts as a positive regulator to suppress lamina bending. Genetic and biochemical data indicate that LPA1 suppresses the auxin signalling that interacts with C-22-hydroxylated and 6-deoxo BRs, which regulates lamina inclination independently of OsBRI1. Mutant lpa1 plants are hypersensitive to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) during the lamina inclination response, which is suppressed by the brassinazole (Brz) inhibitor of C-22 hydroxylase involved in BR synthesis. A strong synergic effect is detected between lpa1 and d2 (the defective mutant for catalysis of C-23-hydroxylated BRs) during IAA-mediated lamina inclination. No significant interaction between LPA1 and OsBRI1 was identified. The lpa1 mutant is sensitive to C-22-hydroxylated and 6-deoxo BRs in the d61-1 (rice BRI1 mutant) background. We present evidence verifying that two independent pathways function via either BRs or BRI1 to determine IAA-mediated lamina inclination in rice. RNA sequencing analysis and qRT-PCR indicate that LPA1 influences the expression of three OsPIN genes (OsPIN1a, OsPIN1c and OsPIN3a), which suggests that auxin flux might be an important factor in LPA1-mediated lamina inclination in rice.
NA	Overexpression of Loose Plant Architecture 1 increases planting density and resistance to sheath blight disease via activation of PIN-FORMED 1a in rice.	2019	Plant Biotechnol J	College of Plant Protection, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, 110866, China.	Increasing yield and resistance to pathogens are important objectives in plant breeding. However, difficulties in breeding are encountered due to the antagonistic relationship between crop yield production and immunity pathways (Ning et<U+00A0>al., 2017). Planting density and plant architecture are key factors determining crop yields in a given area. The plant traits of tiller and lamina joint angles have long attracted the attention of breeders due their significant contributions to plant architecture by enhancing photosynthetic efficiency and facilitating enhanced planting density (Sakamoto et<U+00A0>al., 2006; Wang and Li, 2008).

NA	Novel allelic variant of Lpa1 gene associated with a significant reduction in seed phytic acid content in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2019	PLoS One	Department of Plant Science, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, and Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.	In plants, myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (InsP6), also known as phytic acid (PA), is a major component of organic phosphorus (P), and accounts for up to 85% of the total P in seeds. In rice (Oryza sativa L.), PA mainly accumulates in rice bran, and chelates mineral cations, resulting in mineral deficiencies among brown rice consumers. Therefore, considerable efforts have been focused on the development of low PA (LPA) rice cultivars. In this study, we performed genetic and molecular analyses of OsLpa1, a major PA biosynthesis gene, in Sanggol, a low PA mutant variety developed via chemical mutagenesis of Ilpum rice cultivar. Genetic segregation and sequencing analyses revealed that a recessive allele, lpa1-3, at the OsLpa1 locus (Os02g0819400) was responsible for a significant reduction in seed PA content in Sanggol. The lpa1-3 gene harboured a point mutation (C623T) in the fourth exon of the predicted coding region, resulting in threonine (Thr) to isoleucine (Ile) amino acidsubstitution at position 208 (Thr208Ile). Three-dimensional analysis of Lpa1 protein structure indicated that myo-inositol 3-monophosphate [Ins(3)P1] could bind to the active site of Lpa1, with ATP as a cofactor for catalysis. Furthermore, the presence of Thr208 in the loop adjacent to the entry site of the binding pocket suggests that Thr208Ile substitution is involved in regulating enzyme activity via phosphorylation. Therefore, we propose that Thr208Ile substitution in lpa1-3 reduces Lpa1 enzyme activity in Sanggol, resulting in reduced PA biosynthesis.
