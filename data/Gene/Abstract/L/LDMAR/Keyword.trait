LDMAR	development	A long noncoding RNA regulates photoperiod-sensitive male sterility, an essential component of hybrid rice.	 We found that sufficient amount of the LDMAR transcript is required for normal pollen development of plants grown under long-day conditions
LDMAR	pollen	A long noncoding RNA regulates photoperiod-sensitive male sterility, an essential component of hybrid rice.	 We found that sufficient amount of the LDMAR transcript is required for normal pollen development of plants grown under long-day conditions
LDMAR	cell death	A long noncoding RNA regulates photoperiod-sensitive male sterility, an essential component of hybrid rice.	 This change brought about increased methylation in the putative promoter region of LDMAR, which reduced the transcription of LDMAR specifically under long-day conditions, resulting in premature programmed cell death (PCD) in developing anthers, thus causing PSMS

LDMAR	programmed cell death	A long noncoding RNA regulates photoperiod-sensitive male sterility, an essential component of hybrid rice.	 This change brought about increased methylation in the putative promoter region of LDMAR, which reduced the transcription of LDMAR specifically under long-day conditions, resulting in premature programmed cell death (PCD) in developing anthers, thus causing PSMS
