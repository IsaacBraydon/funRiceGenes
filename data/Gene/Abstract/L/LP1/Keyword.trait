LP1	panicle	Identification of a Candidate Gene for Panicle Length in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Via Association and Linkage Analysis.	 Sequencing analysis of LP1 in two parents and 103 rice accessions indicated that SNP1 is associated with panicle length
LP1	panicle	Identification of a Candidate Gene for Panicle Length in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Via Association and Linkage Analysis.	 The LP1 allele of Xiushui79 leads to reduced panicle length, whereas the allele of C-bao relieves the suppression of panicle length
LP1	panicle	Identification of a Candidate Gene for Panicle Length in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Via Association and Linkage Analysis.	 LP1 and the elite alleles can be used to improve panicle length in rice
