Edstam-2011-Evolutionary history.pdf	Evolutionary history of the non-specific lipid transfer proteins	2011	Mol Plant	IFM Molecular Genetics, Linkoping University, 581 83 Linkoping, Sweden.	The non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are small, basic proteins characterized by a tunnel-like hydrophobic cavity, capable of transferring various lipid molecules between lipid bilayers. Most nsLTPs are synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide that localizes the protein to the apoplastic space. The nsLTPs have only been identified in seed plants, where they are encoded by large gene families. We have initiated an analysis of the evolutionary history of the nsLTP family using genomic and EST information from non-seed land plants and green algae to determine: (1) when the nsLTP family arose, (2) how often new nsLTP subfamilies have been created, and (3) how subfamilies differ in their patterns of expansion and loss in different plant lineages. In this study, we searched sequence databases and found that genes and transcripts encoding nsLTPs are abundant in liverworts, mosses, and all other investigated land plants, but not present in any algae. The tertiary structures of representative liverwort and moss nsLTPs were further studied with homology modeling. The results indicate that the nsLTP family has evolved after plants conquered land. Only two of the four major subfamilies of nsLTPs found in flowering plants are present in mosses and liverworts. The additional subfamilies have arisen later, during land plant evolution. In this report, we also introduce a modified nsLTP classification system.
Garcia-Garrido-1998-Characterization of.pdf	Characterization of a gene encoding an abscisic acid-inducible type-2 lipid transfer protein from rice	1998	FEBS Lett	Laboratoire de Physiologie et Biologie Moleculaire Vegetales, UMR 5545 CNRS Universite de Perpignan, France.	The cloning and sequence analysis of a novel gene that encodes a type 2 non-specific lipid transfer-like protein (LTP) from rice is reported. Sequence analysis revealed an ORF encoding a protein showing characteristics of the LTP proteins. However, rice LTP2 is more similar to heterologous LTPs than to rice LTP1, supporting the existence of two distinct families of plant LTPs. Ltp2 mRNA is accumulated only in mature seeds. In vegetative tissues, mRNA was only detected after treatment with abscisic acid (ABA), mannitol or NaCl. Transient expression experiments that the 61 nucleotides upstream of the TATA box, containing two ACGT boxes and the motif I, are sufficient for ABA responsiveness of the Ltp gene.
Plant Physiol.-2010-Zhang-149-62.pdf	OsC6, encoding a lipid transfer protein, is required for postmeiotic anther development in rice	2010	Plant Physiol	School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.	Synthesis of lipidic components in anthers, including of the pollen exine, is essential for plant male reproductive development. Plant lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are small, abundant lipid-binding proteins that have the ability to exchange lipids between membranes in vitro. However, their biological role in male reproductive development remains less understood. Here, we report the crucial role of OsC6 in regulating postmeiotic anther development in rice (Oryza sativa). Found in monocots, OsC6 belongs to a distinct clade from previously identified LTP1 and LTP2 family members found in both dicots and monocots. OsC6 expression is mainly detectable in tapetal cells and weakly in microspores from stage 9 to stage 11 of anther development. Immunological assays indicated that OsC6 is widely distributed in anther tissues such as the tapetal cytoplasm, the extracellular space between the tapetum and middle layer, and the anther locule and anther cuticle. Biochemical assays indicated that recombinant OsC6 has lipid binding activity. Moreover, plants in which OsC6 was silenced had defective development of orbicules (i.e. Ubisch bodies) and pollen exine and had reduced pollen fertility. Furthermore, additional evidence is provided that the expression of OsC6 is positively regulated by a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Tapetum Degeneration Retardation (TDR). Extra granule-like structures were observed on the inner surface of the tdr tapetal layer when the expression of OsC6 was driven by the TDR promoter compared with the tdr mutant. These data suggest that OsC6 plays a crucial role in the development of lipidic orbicules and pollen exine during anther development in rice.
Samuel-2002-Solution structure o.pdf	Solution structure of plant nonspecific lipid transfer protein-2 from rice (Oryza sativa)	2002	J Biol Chem	Department of Life Sciences, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan 300, China.	The three-dimensional structure of rice nonspecific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP2) has been solved for the first time. The structure of nsLTP2 was obtained using 813 distance constraints, 30 hydrogen bond constraints, and 19 dihedral angle constraints. Fifteen of the 50 random simulated annealing structures satisfied all of the constraints and possessed good nonbonded contacts. The novel three-dimensional fold of rice nsLTP2 contains a triangular hydrophobic cavity formed by three prominent helices. The four disulfide bonds required for stabilization of the nsLTP2 structure show a different pattern of cysteine pairing compared with nsLTP1. The C terminus of the protein is very flexible and forms a cap over the hydrophobic cavity. Molecular modeling studies suggested that the hydrophobic cavity could accommodate large molecules with rigid structures, such as sterols. The positively charged residues on the molecular surface of nsLTP2 are structurally similar to other plant defense proteins.
NA	A novel biological role for nsLTP2 from Oriza sativa: Potential incorporation with anticancer agents, nucleosides and their analogues.	2015	Comput Biol Chem	Department of Biology, Division of Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Isfahan, Iran.	Development of a protein-based drug delivery system has major impact on the efficacy and bioavailability of unstable and water insoluble drugs. In the present study, the binding modes of a nonspecific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP2) from Oryza sativa with various nucleosides and analogous molecules were identified. The 3-D structure of the protein was designed and validated using modeler 9.13, Molegro virtual docker and procheck tool, respectively. The binding affinity and strength of interactions, key contributing residues and specificity toward the substrates were accomplished by computational docking and model prediction. The protein presented high affinity to acyclovir and vidarabine as purine-analogous drugs. Binding affinity is influenced by the core template and functional groups of the ligands which are structurally different cause the variation of interaction energies with nsLTP2. Nonetheless, all the evaluated analogous drugs occupy the proximity space at the nsLTP active site with high similarity in their binding modes. Our findings hold great promise for the future applications of nsLTPs in various aspects of pharmaceutical science and molecular biology.
