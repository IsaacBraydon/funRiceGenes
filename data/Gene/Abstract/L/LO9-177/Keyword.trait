LO9-177	cell elongation	Rice Leaf Angle and Grain Size Are Affected by the OsBUL1 Transcriptional Activator Complex.	 OsBUL1 COMPLEX1 (OsBC1) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional activator that interacts with OsBUL1 only in the presence of LO9-177 forming a possible trimeric complex for cell elongation in the lamina joint of rice
