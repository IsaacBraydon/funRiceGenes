LARGE2	panicle	The LARGE2-APO1/APO2 regulatory module controls panicle size and grain number in rice	 Here we report that LARGE2 encodes a HECT-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase OsUPL2 and regulates panicle size and grain number in rice
LARGE2	panicle	The LARGE2-APO1/APO2 regulatory module controls panicle size and grain number in rice	 LARGE2 regulates panicle size and grain number by repressing meristematic activity
LARGE2	panicle	The LARGE2-APO1/APO2 regulatory module controls panicle size and grain number in rice	 Biochemical analyses show that LARGE2 physically associates with ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (APO1) and APO2, two positive regulators of panicle size and grain number, and modulates their stabilities
LARGE2	panicle	The LARGE2-APO1/APO2 regulatory module controls panicle size and grain number in rice	 Genetic analyses support that LARGE2 functions with APO1 and APO2 in a common pathway to regulate panicle size and grain number
LARGE2	grain	The LARGE2-APO1/APO2 regulatory module controls panicle size and grain number in rice	 Here we report that LARGE2 encodes a HECT-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase OsUPL2 and regulates panicle size and grain number in rice
LARGE2	grain	The LARGE2-APO1/APO2 regulatory module controls panicle size and grain number in rice	 The loss of function large2 mutants produce large panicles with increased grain number, wide grains and leaves, and thick culms
