The cold tolerance of rice at the booting stage is a main factor determining sustainability and regional adaptability. However, relatively few cold tolerance genes have been identified that can be effectively used in breeding programmes. Here, we show that a point mutation in the low-temperature tolerance 1 (LTT1) gene improves cold tolerance by maintaining tapetum degradation and pollen development, by activation of systems that metabolize reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cold-induced ROS accumulation is therefore prevented in the anthers of the ltt1 mutants allowing correct development. In contrast, exposure to cold stress dramatically increases ROS accumulation in the wild type anthers, together with the expression of genes encoding proteins associated with programmed cell death and with the accelerated degradation of the tapetum that ultimately leads to pollen abortion. These results demonstrate that appropriate ROS management is critical for the cold tolerance of rice at the booting stage. Hence, the ltt1 mutation can significantly improve the seed setting ability of cold-sensitive rice varieties under low-temperature stress conditions, with little yield penalty under optimal temperature conditions. This study highlights the importance of a valuable genetic resource that may be applied in rice breeding programmes to enhance cold tolerance.
