LTT1	temperature	A point mutation in LTT1 enhances cold tolerance at the booting stage in rice.	 Hence, the ltt1 mutation can significantly improve the seed setting ability of cold-sensitive rice varieties under low-temperature stress conditions, with little yield penalty under optimal temperature conditions
LTT1	development	A point mutation in LTT1 enhances cold tolerance at the booting stage in rice.	 Cold-induced ROS accumulation is therefore prevented in the anthers of the ltt1 mutants allowing correct development
LTT1	seed	A point mutation in LTT1 enhances cold tolerance at the booting stage in rice.	 Hence, the ltt1 mutation can significantly improve the seed setting ability of cold-sensitive rice varieties under low-temperature stress conditions, with little yield penalty under optimal temperature conditions
LTT1	tolerance	A point mutation in LTT1 enhances cold tolerance at the booting stage in rice.	A point mutation in LTT1 enhances cold tolerance at the booting stage in rice.
LTT1	yield	A point mutation in LTT1 enhances cold tolerance at the booting stage in rice.	 Hence, the ltt1 mutation can significantly improve the seed setting ability of cold-sensitive rice varieties under low-temperature stress conditions, with little yield penalty under optimal temperature conditions
LTT1	cold tolerance	A point mutation in LTT1 enhances cold tolerance at the booting stage in rice.	A point mutation in LTT1 enhances cold tolerance at the booting stage in rice.
LTT1	stress	A point mutation in LTT1 enhances cold tolerance at the booting stage in rice.	 Hence, the ltt1 mutation can significantly improve the seed setting ability of cold-sensitive rice varieties under low-temperature stress conditions, with little yield penalty under optimal temperature conditions
LTT1	cold	A point mutation in LTT1 enhances cold tolerance at the booting stage in rice.	A point mutation in LTT1 enhances cold tolerance at the booting stage in rice.
