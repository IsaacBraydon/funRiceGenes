OscpSRP43|PGL3	YGL138(t)|OscpSRP54a	Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice	 Both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were able to interact with OscpSRP43, respectively
OscpSRP43|PGL3	YGL138(t)|OscpSRP54a	Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice	 In contrast, the transcript levels of OscpSRP54a, OscpSRP43 and OscpSRP54b were all significantly decreased in OscpSRP54b knockout lines
OscpSRP43|PGL3	YGL138(t)|OscpSRP54a	Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice	  Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were essential for normal chloroplast development by interacting with OscpSRP43 in rice
