YGL138(t)|OscpSRP54a|TSYL1	leaf	Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice	 The defective OscpSRP54a (LOC_Os11g05552) was responsible for the pale green leaf phenotype of the viable pale green leaf 14 (pgl14) mutant
YGL138(t)|OscpSRP54a|TSYL1	chloroplast	Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice	  Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were essential for normal chloroplast development by interacting with OscpSRP43 in rice
YGL138(t)|OscpSRP54a|TSYL1	chloroplast	Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice	 OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b might play distinct roles in transporting different chloroplast proteins into thylakoids through cpSRP-mediated pathway
YGL138(t)|OscpSRP54a|TSYL1	growth	Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice	 Both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were constitutively expressed mainly in shoots and leaves at the vegetative growth stage
YGL138(t)|OscpSRP54a|TSYL1	development	Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice	  Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were essential for normal chloroplast development by interacting with OscpSRP43 in rice
YGL138(t)|OscpSRP54a|TSYL1	vegetative	Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice	 Both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were constitutively expressed mainly in shoots and leaves at the vegetative growth stage
YGL138(t)|OscpSRP54a|TSYL1	chloroplast development	Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice	  Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were essential for normal chloroplast development by interacting with OscpSRP43 in rice
