Background: The chloroplast signal recognition particle 54 (cpSRP54) is known for targeting the light-harvesting complex proteins to thylakoids and plays a critical role for chloroplast development in Arabidopsis, but little is known in rice. Here, we reported two homologous cpSRP54s that affect chloroplast development and plant survival in rice.  Results: Two rice cpSRP54 homologues, OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b, were identified in present study. The defective OscpSRP54a (LOC_Os11g05552) was responsible for the pale green leaf phenotype of the viable pale green leaf 14 (pgl14) mutant. A single nucleotide substitution from G to A at the position 278, the first intron splicing site, was detected in LOC_Os11g05552 in pgl14. The wild type allele could rescue the mutant phenotype. Knockout lines of OscpSRP54b (LOC_Os11g05556) exhibited similar pale green phenotype to pgl14 with reduced chlorophyll contents and impaired chloroplast development, but showed apparently arrested-growth and died within 3 weeks. Both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were constitutively expressed mainly in shoots and leaves at the vegetative growth stage. Subcellular location indicated that both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were chloroplast-localized. Both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were able to interact with OscpSRP43, respectively. The transcript level of OscpSRP43 was significantly reduced while the transcript level of OscpSRP54b was apparently increased in pgl14. In contrast, the transcript levels of OscpSRP54a, OscpSRP43 and OscpSRP54b were all significantly decreased in OscpSRP54b knockout lines.  Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were essential for normal chloroplast development by interacting with OscpSRP43 in rice. OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b might play distinct roles in transporting different chloroplast proteins into thylakoids through cpSRP-mediated pathway.
