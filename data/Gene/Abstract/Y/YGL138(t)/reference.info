NA	Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice	2020	Rice	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, China.	Background: The chloroplast signal recognition particle 54 (cpSRP54) is known for targeting the light-harvesting complex proteins to thylakoids and plays a critical role for chloroplast development in Arabidopsis, but little is known in rice. Here, we reported two homologous cpSRP54s that affect chloroplast development and plant survival in rice.  Results: Two rice cpSRP54 homologues, OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b, were identified in present study. The defective OscpSRP54a (LOC_Os11g05552) was responsible for the pale green leaf phenotype of the viable pale green leaf 14 (pgl14) mutant. A single nucleotide substitution from G to A at the position 278, the first intron splicing site, was detected in LOC_Os11g05552 in pgl14. The wild type allele could rescue the mutant phenotype. Knockout lines of OscpSRP54b (LOC_Os11g05556) exhibited similar pale green phenotype to pgl14 with reduced chlorophyll contents and impaired chloroplast development, but showed apparently arrested-growth and died within 3 weeks. Both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were constitutively expressed mainly in shoots and leaves at the vegetative growth stage. Subcellular location indicated that both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were chloroplast-localized. Both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were able to interact with OscpSRP43, respectively. The transcript level of OscpSRP43 was significantly reduced while the transcript level of OscpSRP54b was apparently increased in pgl14. In contrast, the transcript levels of OscpSRP54a, OscpSRP43 and OscpSRP54b were all significantly decreased in OscpSRP54b knockout lines.  Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were essential for normal chloroplast development by interacting with OscpSRP43 in rice. OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b might play distinct roles in transporting different chloroplast proteins into thylakoids through cpSRP-mediated pathway.
NA	Identification and characterization of tsyl1, a thermosensitive chlorophyll-deficient mutant in rice (Oryza sativa).	2022	J Plant Physiol	Rice Research Institute, Jiangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330200, China; Nanchang Branch of Chinese National Center for Rice Improvement, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330200, China; National Engineering Research Center of Rice, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330200, China. Electronic address: 584217423@qq.com.	Chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis are affected by temperature. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains elusive. Here, we isolated and characterized a thermosensitive yellow-green leaf mutant named tsyl1 (thermosensitive yellow leaf 1) from an ethylmethylsulfone (EMS)-mutagenized pool of rice. The mutant exhibits a yellow-green leaf phenotype and decreased leaf chlorophyll contents throughout development. At the mature stage of the tsyl1 mutant, the plant height, tiller number, number of spikelets per panicle and 1000 seed weight were decreased significantly compared to those of wild-type plants, but the seed setting rate and panicle length were not. The mutant phenotype was controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene on the short arm of rice chromosome 11. Map-based cloning of TSYL1, followed by a complementation experiment, showed a G base deletion at the coding region of LOC_Os11g05552, leading to the yellow-green phenotype. The TSYL1 gene encodes a signal recognition particle 54Â kDa (SRP54) protein that is conserved in all organisms. The expression of tsyl1 was induced by high temperature. Furthermore, and chloroplast development-related genes was influenced in tsyl1 at different temperatures. These results indicated that the TSYL1 gene plays a key role in chlorophyll biosynthesis and is affected by temperature at the transcriptional level.
