Edstam-2011-Evolutionary history.pdf	Evolutionary history of the non-specific lipid transfer proteins	2011	Mol Plant	IFM Molecular Genetics, Linkoping University, 581 83 Linkoping, Sweden.	The non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are small, basic proteins characterized by a tunnel-like hydrophobic cavity, capable of transferring various lipid molecules between lipid bilayers. Most nsLTPs are synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide that localizes the protein to the apoplastic space. The nsLTPs have only been identified in seed plants, where they are encoded by large gene families. We have initiated an analysis of the evolutionary history of the nsLTP family using genomic and EST information from non-seed land plants and green algae to determine: (1) when the nsLTP family arose, (2) how often new nsLTP subfamilies have been created, and (3) how subfamilies differ in their patterns of expansion and loss in different plant lineages. In this study, we searched sequence databases and found that genes and transcripts encoding nsLTPs are abundant in liverworts, mosses, and all other investigated land plants, but not present in any algae. The tertiary structures of representative liverwort and moss nsLTPs were further studied with homology modeling. The results indicate that the nsLTP family has evolved after plants conquered land. Only two of the four major subfamilies of nsLTPs found in flowering plants are present in mosses and liverworts. The additional subfamilies have arisen later, during land plant evolution. In this report, we also introduce a modified nsLTP classification system.
Hihara-1996-Isolation and charac.pdf	Isolation and characterization of two cDNA clones for mRNAs that are abundantly expressed in immature anthers of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	1996	Plant Mol Biol	Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo, Yayoi 1-1-1, 113, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan	The relationship between the length of anthers and the stage of development of microspores was examined in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Hayayuki). Anthers of ‚âêı<U+3E34>2 mm and 2.1‚Ä<U+393C><U+3E33>2.2 mm in length and those ready to dehiscence were determined to be at the uninucleate, binucleate and trinucleate microspore stage, respectively. Two cDNAs (YY1 and YY2), representing genes that are specifically expressed in anthers at the uninucleate microspore stage, were isolated and characterized. YY1 cDNA encoded an open reading frame of 95 amino acids. Eight cysteine residues with the potential to form disulfide bridges were present in the amino acid sequence. There was a hydrophobic region at the N-terminus of the putative protein, suggesting that the YY1 protein might be secreted. This cysteine motif and the hydrophobic N-terminus are conserved among products of several anther-specific genes or cDNAs isolated from various plant species. These proteins are thought to form a superfamily of proteins that are confined to anthers. The YY1 transcript was localized in the tapetal cells and the peripheral cells of the vascular bundle. YY2 cDNA encoded an open reading frame of 389 amino acids and the deduced amino acid sequence exhibited substantial homology to that of chalcone synthase. Expression of YY2 mRNA was confined to the tapetal cells. The genes correspond to YY1 and YY2 cDNAs were shown to exist as single copies in the rice genome.
Plant Physiol.-2010-Zhang-149-62.pdf	OsC6, encoding a lipid transfer protein, is required for postmeiotic anther development in rice	2010	Plant Physiol	School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.	Synthesis of lipidic components in anthers, including of the pollen exine, is essential for plant male reproductive development. Plant lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are small, abundant lipid-binding proteins that have the ability to exchange lipids between membranes in vitro. However, their biological role in male reproductive development remains less understood. Here, we report the crucial role of OsC6 in regulating postmeiotic anther development in rice (Oryza sativa). Found in monocots, OsC6 belongs to a distinct clade from previously identified LTP1 and LTP2 family members found in both dicots and monocots. OsC6 expression is mainly detectable in tapetal cells and weakly in microspores from stage 9 to stage 11 of anther development. Immunological assays indicated that OsC6 is widely distributed in anther tissues such as the tapetal cytoplasm, the extracellular space between the tapetum and middle layer, and the anther locule and anther cuticle. Biochemical assays indicated that recombinant OsC6 has lipid binding activity. Moreover, plants in which OsC6 was silenced had defective development of orbicules (i.e. Ubisch bodies) and pollen exine and had reduced pollen fertility. Furthermore, additional evidence is provided that the expression of OsC6 is positively regulated by a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Tapetum Degeneration Retardation (TDR). Extra granule-like structures were observed on the inner surface of the tdr tapetal layer when the expression of OsC6 was driven by the TDR promoter compared with the tdr mutant. These data suggest that OsC6 plays a crucial role in the development of lipidic orbicules and pollen exine during anther development in rice.
