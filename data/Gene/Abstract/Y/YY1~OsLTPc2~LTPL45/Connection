OsPKS1|YY2	YY1|OsLTPc2|LTPL45	Isolation and characterization of two cDNA clones for mRNAs that are abundantly expressed in immature anthers of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Two cDNAs (YY1 and YY2), representing genes that are specifically expressed in anthers at the uninucleate microspore stage, were isolated and characterized
OsPKS1|YY2	YY1|OsLTPc2|LTPL45	Isolation and characterization of two cDNA clones for mRNAs that are abundantly expressed in immature anthers of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 The genes correspond to YY1 and YY2 cDNAs were shown to exist as single copies in the rice genome
