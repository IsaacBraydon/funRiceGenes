YY1|OsLTPc2|LTPL45	anther	Isolation and characterization of two cDNA clones for mRNAs that are abundantly expressed in immature anthers of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Two cDNAs (YY1 and YY2), representing genes that are specifically expressed in anthers at the uninucleate microspore stage, were isolated and characterized

Two cDNAs (YY1 and YY2), representing genes that are specifically expressed in anthers at the uninucleate microspore stage, were isolated and characterized
YY1|OsLTPc2|LTPL45	tapetal	Isolation and characterization of two cDNA clones for mRNAs that are abundantly expressed in immature anthers of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	The YY1 transcript was localized in the tapetal cells and the peripheral cells of the vascular bundle
YY1|OsLTPc2|LTPL45	vascular bundle	Isolation and characterization of two cDNA clones for mRNAs that are abundantly expressed in immature anthers of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	The YY1 transcript was localized in the tapetal cells and the peripheral cells of the vascular bundle
