YGL18	leaf	Impaired Magnesium Protoporphyrin IX Methyltransferase (ChlM) Impedes Chlorophyll Synthesis and Plant Growth in Rice.	 YGL18 is expressed in green tissues, especially in leaf organs, where it functions in chloroplasts
YGL18	growth	Impaired Magnesium Protoporphyrin IX Methyltransferase (ChlM) Impedes Chlorophyll Synthesis and Plant Growth in Rice.	 The retarded growth of ygl18 mutant plants was caused by the high light intensity
YGL18	growth	Impaired Magnesium Protoporphyrin IX Methyltransferase (ChlM) Impedes Chlorophyll Synthesis and Plant Growth in Rice.	 Based on these results, it is suggested that YGL18 plays essential roles in light-related chlorophyll synthesis and light intensity-involved plant growth
YGL18	map-based cloning	Impaired Magnesium Protoporphyrin IX Methyltransferase (ChlM) Impedes Chlorophyll Synthesis and Plant Growth in Rice.	 Map-based cloning of this mutant identified the YGL18 gene LOC_Os06g04150
YGL18	plant growth	Impaired Magnesium Protoporphyrin IX Methyltransferase (ChlM) Impedes Chlorophyll Synthesis and Plant Growth in Rice.	 Based on these results, it is suggested that YGL18 plays essential roles in light-related chlorophyll synthesis and light intensity-involved plant growth
