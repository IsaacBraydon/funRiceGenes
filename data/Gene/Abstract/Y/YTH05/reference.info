N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most widely distributed and most abundant type of mRNA modification in eukaryotic. It provides a posttranscriptional level regulation of gene expression by regulating pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA degradation, or mRNA translational efficiency etc. The function of m(6)A modification is decoded by binding proteins that can specially bind to m(6)A. YT521-B homology (YTH) family proteins are the most important m(6)A-binding proteins in mammals and Arabidopsis. However, their roles in growth and development remain unknown. Here, we demonstrated that the YTH family proteins YTH03, YTH05 and YTH10 specifically bind to m(6)A-containing RNAs. Knockout of YTH03, YTH05 or YTH10 causes reduced plant height. Further research showed that simultaneously knockout of YTH03, YTH05 and YTH10 shows severe dwarf phenotype, suggesting these three genes regulate rice plant height in a functionally redundant manner. Additional transcriptome study showed that the reduced plant height of the yth03/05/10 triple mutant may be due to the blocked of diterpenoid and brassinolide synthesis pathway. Overall, we demonstrate that YTH03, YTH05 and YTH10 are all the m(6)A readers in rice and redundantly regulate rice plant height through the hormonal related pathway.
