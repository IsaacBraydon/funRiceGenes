YTH10	dwarf	The N(6)-methyladenosine binding proteins YTH03/05/10 coordinately regulate rice plant height.	 Further research showed that simultaneously knockout of YTH03, YTH05 and YTH10 shows severe dwarf phenotype, suggesting these three genes regulate rice plant height in a functionally redundant manner
YTH10	height	The N(6)-methyladenosine binding proteins YTH03/05/10 coordinately regulate rice plant height.	 Knockout of YTH03, YTH05 or YTH10 causes reduced plant height
YTH10	height	The N(6)-methyladenosine binding proteins YTH03/05/10 coordinately regulate rice plant height.	 Further research showed that simultaneously knockout of YTH03, YTH05 and YTH10 shows severe dwarf phenotype, suggesting these three genes regulate rice plant height in a functionally redundant manner
YTH10	height	The N(6)-methyladenosine binding proteins YTH03/05/10 coordinately regulate rice plant height.	 Overall, we demonstrate that YTH03, YTH05 and YTH10 are all the m(6)A readers in rice and redundantly regulate rice plant height through the hormonal related pathway
