Se5|OsHY1|OsHO1|YGL2	 Interestingly, activity of L -DES, as well as the enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism was significantly increased in OsSE5-overexpression line (35S:OsSE5), whereas impaired in OsSE5-knockdown mutant (OsSE5-RNAi)	 Interestingly, activity of L -DES, as well as the enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism was significantly increased in OsSE5-overexpression line (35S:OsSE5), whereas impaired in OsSE5-knockdown mutant (OsSE5-RNAi)	 Interestingly, activity of L -DES, as well as the enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism was significantly increased in OsSE5-overexpression line (35S:OsSE5), whereas impaired in OsSE5-knockdown mutant (OsSE5-RNAi) |  Application of HT/PAG or H2 S donor could differentially block or rescue NH4 Cl-hyposensitivity or hypersensitivity phenotypes in 35S:OsSE5-1 or OsSE5-RNAi-1 plants, with a concomitant modulation of nitrogen assimilation
