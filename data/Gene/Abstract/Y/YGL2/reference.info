KEY MESSAGE: An insert mutation of YELLOW-GREEN LEAF2 , encoding Heme Oxygenase 1 , results in significant reduction of its transcript levels, and therefore impairs chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice. Heme oxygenase (HO) in higher plants catalyzes the degradation of heme to synthesize phytochrome precursor and its roles conferring the photoperiodic control of flowering in rice have been revealed. However, its involvement in regulating rice chlorophyll (Chl) synthesis is not fully explored. In this study, we isolated a rice mutant named yellow-green leaf 2 (ygl2) from a (60)Co-irradiated population. Normal grown ygl2 seedlings showed yellow-green leaves with reduced contents of Chl and tetrapyrrole intermediates whereas an increase of Chl a/b ratio. Ultrastructural analyses demonstrated grana were poorly stacked in ygl2 mutant, resulting in underdevelopment of chloroplasts. The ygl2 locus was mapped to chromosome 6 and isolated via map-based cloning. Sequence analysis indicated that it encodes the rice HO1 and its identity was verified by transgenic complementation test and RNA interference. A 7-Kb insertion was found in the first exon of YGL2/HO1, resulting in significant reduction of YGL2 expressions in the ygl2 mutant. YGL2 was constitutively expressed in a variety of rice tissues with the highest levels in leaves and regulated by temperature. In addition, we found expression levels of some genes associated with Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis were concurrently altered in ygl2 mutant. These results provide direct evidence that YGL2 has a vital function in rice Chl biosynthesis.

The photoperiodic sensitivity 5 (se5) mutant of rice, a short-day plant, has a very early flowering phenotype and is completely deficient in photoperiodic response. We have cloned the SE5 gene by candidate cloning and demonstrated that it encodes a putative heme oxygenase. Lack of responses of coleoptile elongation by light pulses and photoreversible phytochromes in crude extracts of se5 indicate that SE5 may function in phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis. Ectopic expression of SE5 cDNA by the CaMV 35S promoter restored the photoperiodic response in the se5 mutant. Our results indicate that phytochromes confer the photoperiodic control of flowering in rice. Comparison of se5 with hy1, a counterpart mutant of Arabidopsis, suggests distinct roles of phytochromes in the photoperiodic control of flowering in these two species.
Plant Physiol.-2009-Andr-681-90.pdf	Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 sheds light on the role of phytochromes in photoperiodic flowering in rice	2009	Plant Physiol	Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias, Carretera Moncada-Naquera Km 7.5, 46113 Moncada, Spain.	A great number of plants synchronize flowering with day length. In rice (Oryza sativa), photoperiod is the primary environmental cue that triggers flowering. Here, we show that the s73 mutant, identified in a gamma-irradiated Bahia collection, displays early flowering and photoperiodic insensitivity due to a null mutation in the PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 (SE5) gene, which encodes an enzyme implicated in phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis. s73 mutant plants show a number of alterations in the characteristic diurnal expression patterns of master genes involved in photoperiodic control of flowering, resulting in up-regulation of the floral integrator Heading date3a (Hd3a). Early heading date1 (Ehd1), an additional rice floral activator, was also highly expressed in the s73 mutant, suggesting that SE5 represses Ehd1 in wild-type plants. Silencing of Ehd1 in both Bahia and s73 backgrounds indicated that SE5 regulates Ehd1 expression. The data also indicate that SE5 confers photoperiodic sensitivity through regulation of Hd1. These results provide direct evidence that phytochromes inhibit flowering by affecting both Hd1 and Ehd1 flowering pathways.
psb-7-885.pdf	Heme oxygenase is involved in nitric oxide- and auxin-induced lateral root formation in rice	2012	Plant Cell Rep	Department of Agronomy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.	Lateral root (LR) development performs the essential tasks of providing water, nutrients, and physical support to plants. Therefore, understanding the regulation of LR development is of agronomic importance. In this study, we examined the effect of nitric oxide (NO), auxin, and hemin (Hm) on LR formation in rice. Treatment with Hm [a highly effective heme oxygenase (HO) inducer], sodium nitroprusside (SNP, an NO donor), or indole-3-butyric acid (IBA, a naturally occurring auxin) induced LR formation and HO activity. LR formation and HO activity induced by SNP and IBA but not Hm was reduced by the specific NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide. As well, Hm, SNP, and IBA could induce OsHO1 mRNA expression. Zn protoporphyrin IX (the specific inhibitor of HO) and hemoglobin (the carbon monoxide/NO scavenger) reduced LR number and HO activity induced by Hm, SNP, and IBA. Our data suggest that HO is required for Hm-, auxin-, and NO-induced LR formation in rice.

Plant heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzes the oxygenation of heme to biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO), and free iron (Fe(2+))-and Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa) HOs are involved in light signaling. Here, we identified that the rice PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY 5 (SE5) gene, which encoded a putative HO with high similarity to HO-1 from Arabidopsis (HY1), exhibited HO activity, and localized in the chloroplasts. Rice RNAi mutants silenced for SE5 were generated and displayed early flowering under long-day conditions, consistent with phenotypes of the null mutation in SE5 gene reported previously (se5 and s73). The herbicide methyl viologen (MV), which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), was applied to determine whether SE5 regulates oxidative stress response. Compared with wild-type, SE5 RNAi transgenic plants aggravated seedling growth inhibition, chlorophyll loss and ROS overproduction, and decreased the transcripts of some representative antioxidative genes. By contrast, administration of exogenous CO partially rescued corresponding MV hypersensitivity in the SE5 RNAi plants. Alleviation of seed germination inhibition, chlorophyll loss and ROS overproduction, as well as the induction of antioxidant defense were further observed when SE5 or HY1 was overexpressed in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, indicating that SE5 may be useful for molecular breeding designed to improve plant tolerance to oxidative stress.
NA	L -cysteine desulfhydrase-related H2 S production is involved in OsSE5-promoted ammonium tolerance in roots of Oryza sativa.	2017	Plant Cell Environ	Laboratory Center of Life Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Previous studies revealed that rice heme oxygenase PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY 5 (OsSE5) is involved in the regulation of tolerance to excess ammonium by enhancing antioxidant defence. In this study, the relationship between OsSE5 and hydrogen sulfide (H2 S), a well-known signalling molecule was investigated. Results showed that NH4 Cl triggered the induction of L -cysteine desulfhydrase (L -DES)-related H2 S production in rice seedling roots. A H2 S donor, not only alleviated the excess ammonium-triggered inhibition of root growth, but also reduced endogenous ammonium, both of which were aggravated by the hypotaurine (HT, a H2 S scavenger) or DL -propargylglycine (PAG, a L -DES inhibitor). Nitrogen-metabolism related enzymes were activated by H2 S, thus resulting in induction of amino acid synthesis and total nitrogen content. Interestingly, activity of L -DES, as well as the enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism was significantly increased in OsSE5-overexpression line (35S:OsSE5), whereas impaired in OsSE5-knockdown mutant (OsSE5-RNAi). Application of HT/PAG or H2 S donor could differentially block or rescue NH4 Cl-hyposensitivity or hypersensitivity phenotypes in 35S:OsSE5-1 or OsSE5-RNAi-1 plants, with a concomitant modulation of nitrogen assimilation. Taken together, these results illustrated that H2 S function as an indispensable positive regulator participated in OsSE5-promoted ammonium tolerance, in which nitrogen metabolism was facilitated.
NA	Map-Based Cloning and Functional Analysis of YE1 in Rice, Which Is Involved in Light-Dependent Chlorophyll Biogenesis and Photoperiodic Flowering Pathway.	2019	Int J Mol Sci	Rice Research Institute, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang 621010, China. youlinp@hotmail.com.	Light is one of the most important environmental factors that affect many aspects of plant growth, including chlorophyll (Chl) synthesis and flowering time. Here, we identified a rice mutant, yellow leaf and early flowering (ye1), and characterized the gene YE1 by using a map-based cloning method. YE1 encodes a heme oxygenase, which is localized to the chloroplasts. YE1 is expressed in various green tissues, especially in leaves, with a diurnal-rhythmic expression pattern, and its transcripts is also induced by light during leaf-greening. The mutant displays decreased Chl contents with less and disorderly thylakoid lamellar layers in chloroplasts, which reduced the photosynthesis rate. The early flowering phenotype of ye1 was not photoperiod-sensitive. Furthermore, the expression levels of Chl biosynthetic genes were downregulated in ye1 seedlings during de-etiolation responses to light. We also found that rhythmic expression patterns of genes involved in photoperiodic flowering were altered in the mutant. Based on these results, we infer that YE1 plays an important role in light-dependent Chl biogenesis as well as photoperiodic flowering pathway in rice.
NA	PE-1, Encoding Heme Oxygenase 1, Impacts Heading Date and Chloroplast Development in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.).	2019	J Agric Food Chem	College of Chemistry and Life Sciences , Zhejiang Normal University , Jinhua , Zhejiang 321004 , People's Republic of China.	The duration of the rice growth phase has always been an important target trait. The identification of mutations in rice that alter these processes and result in a shorter growth phase could have potential benefits for crop production. In this study, we isolated an early aging rice mutant, pe-1, with light green leaves, using γ-mutated indica rice cultivar and subsequent screening methods, which is known as the phytochrome synthesis factor Se5 that controls rice flowering. The pe-1 plant is accompanied by a decreased chlorophyll content, an enhanced photosynthesis, and a decreased pollen fertility. PE-1, a close homologue of HY1, is localized in the chloroplast. Expression pattern analysis indicated that PE-1 was mainly expressed in roots, stems, leaves, leaf sheaths, and young panicles. The knockout of PE-1 using the CRISPR/Cas9 system decreased the chlorophyll content and downregulated the expression of PE-1-related genes. Furthermore, the chloroplasts of pe-1 were filled with many large-sized starch grains, and the number of osmiophilic granules (a chloroplast lipid reservoir) was significantly decreased. Altogether, our findings suggest that PE-1 functions as a master regulator to mediate in chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthetic pathways.
