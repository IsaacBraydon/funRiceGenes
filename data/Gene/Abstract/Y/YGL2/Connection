Ehd1	Se5|OsHY1|OsHO1|YGL2|YE1	Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 sheds light on the role of phytochromes in photoperiodic flowering in rice	Early heading date1 (Ehd1), an additional rice floral activator, was also highly expressed in the s73 mutant, suggesting that SE5 represses Ehd1 in wild-type plants
Ehd1	Se5|OsHY1|OsHO1|YGL2|YE1	Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 sheds light on the role of phytochromes in photoperiodic flowering in rice	Silencing of Ehd1 in both Bahia and s73 backgrounds indicated that SE5 regulates Ehd1 expression
Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	Se5|OsHY1|OsHO1|YGL2|YE1	Genetic relationship between phytochromes and OsELF3-1 reveals the mode of regulation for the suppression of phytochrome signaling in rice.	 Here, we observed that the oself3-1 mutation suppresses the photoperiod-insensitive early flowering of photoperiod sensitivity5 (se5), which is a chromophore-deficient rice mutant
Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	Se5|OsHY1|OsHO1|YGL2|YE1	Genetic relationship between phytochromes and OsELF3-1 reveals the mode of regulation for the suppression of phytochrome signaling in rice.	 Although the oself3-1 mutation recovered Ghd7 expression in the se5 background, there was a lack of Ghd7 expression in the phyAphyBphyC triple mutant background
