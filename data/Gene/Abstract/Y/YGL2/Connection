Ehd1	Se5|OsHY1|OsHO1|YGL2|YE1|PE-1	Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 sheds light on the role of phytochromes in photoperiodic flowering in rice	Early heading date1 (Ehd1), an additional rice floral activator, was also highly expressed in the s73 mutant, suggesting that SE5 represses Ehd1 in wild-type plants
Ehd1	Se5|OsHY1|OsHO1|YGL2|YE1|PE-1	Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 sheds light on the role of phytochromes in photoperiodic flowering in rice	Silencing of Ehd1 in both Bahia and s73 backgrounds indicated that SE5 regulates Ehd1 expression
Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	Se5|OsHY1|OsHO1|YGL2|YE1|PE-1	Genetic relationship between phytochromes and OsELF3-1 reveals the mode of regulation for the suppression of phytochrome signaling in rice.	 Here, we observed that the oself3-1 mutation suppresses the photoperiod-insensitive early flowering of photoperiod sensitivity5 (se5), which is a chromophore-deficient rice mutant
Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	Se5|OsHY1|OsHO1|YGL2|YE1|PE-1	Genetic relationship between phytochromes and OsELF3-1 reveals the mode of regulation for the suppression of phytochrome signaling in rice.	 Although the oself3-1 mutation recovered Ghd7 expression in the se5 background, there was a lack of Ghd7 expression in the phyAphyBphyC triple mutant background
Ghd7	Se5|OsHY1|OsHO1|YGL2|YE1|PE-1	Posttranscriptional regulation of Ghd7 protein stability by phytochrome and OsGI in photoperiodic control of flowering in rice.	 We found that constitutive expression of Ghd7 delays flowering in the wild type background, but not in the se5 mutant background (deficient in functional phytochromes) under LD and that Ghd7 protein fails to accumulate in the se5 mutant
OsCOL4	Se5|OsHY1|OsHO1|YGL2|YE1|PE-1	A Combination of Long-Day Suppressor Genes Contributes to the Northward Expansion of Rice 	 Here, we report the analysis of genetic variation in eight long-day flowering suppressor genes (Hd1, DTH8, Ghd7, OsCOL4, DTH7, Hd6, Se5, and PhyB) and the phylogenetic relationship of eight genes
OsCOL4	Se5|OsHY1|OsHO1|YGL2|YE1|PE-1	A Combination of Long-Day Suppressor Genes Contributes to the Northward Expansion of Rice 	 Genetic variations in DTH8, Ghd7, Hd1, DTH7, PhyB, and OsCOL4 are correlated with differences in heading date and the correlation between the genetic diversity of Hd6 and Se5 and rice heading data are weak
