YLC3	chloroplast	The Rice Aspartyl-tRNA Synthetase YLC3 Regulates Amino Acid Homeostasis and Chloroplast Development Under Low Temperature.	The Rice Aspartyl-tRNA Synthetase YLC3 Regulates Amino Acid Homeostasis and Chloroplast Development Under Low Temperature.
YLC3	chloroplast	The Rice Aspartyl-tRNA Synthetase YLC3 Regulates Amino Acid Homeostasis and Chloroplast Development Under Low Temperature.	 Moreover, uncharged tRNA-Asp accumulation and phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α was detected in the mutant, suggesting that YLC3 regulates the homeostasis of amino acid metabolism and chloroplast thylakoid development through modulation of processes during protein synthesis
