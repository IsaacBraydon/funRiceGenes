YLWS	leaf	Young Leaf White Stripe encodes a P-type PPR protein required for chloroplast development.	 Our results suggest that YLWS participates in chloroplast RNA group II intron splicing and plays an important role in chloroplast development during early leaf development
YLWS	chloroplast	Young Leaf White Stripe encodes a P-type PPR protein required for chloroplast development.	 The ylws mutant was impaired in chloroplast ribosome biogenesis and chloroplast development under low-temperature conditions
