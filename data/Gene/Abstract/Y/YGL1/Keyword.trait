YGL1|OsCHLG	seedling	A chlorophyll-deficient rice mutant with impaired chlorophyllide esterification in chlorophyll biosynthesis	Moreover, the expression of some nuclear genes associated with Chl biosynthesis or chloroplast development was also affected in ygl1 seedlings
YGL1|OsCHLG	leaf	A chlorophyll-deficient rice mutant with impaired chlorophyllide esterification in chlorophyll biosynthesis	In this study, a rice (Oryza Sativa) Chl-deficient mutant, yellow-green leaf1 (ygl1), was isolated, which showed yellow-green leaves in young plants with decreased Chl synthesis, increased level of tetrapyrrole intermediates, and delayed chloroplast development
