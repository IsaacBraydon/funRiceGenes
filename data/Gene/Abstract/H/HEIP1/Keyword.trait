HEIP1|OsAGG1	meiosis	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.
HEIP1|OsAGG1	meiotic	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	 HEIP1 colocalizes with HEI10 in a dynamic fashion along the meiotic chromosomes and specially localizes onto crossover sites from late pachytene to diplotene
HEIP1|OsAGG1	crossover	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.
HEIP1|OsAGG1	crossover	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	 HEIP1 colocalizes with HEI10 in a dynamic fashion along the meiotic chromosomes and specially localizes onto crossover sites from late pachytene to diplotene
HEIP1|OsAGG1	meiotic	The plant-specific gene ABERRANT GAMETOGENESIS 1 is essential for meiosis in rice.	 Overall, our work showed that OsAGG1 is a novel and critical component for rice meiotic CO formation, thus expanding our understanding of meiotic progression
HEIP1|OsAGG1	crossover	The plant-specific gene ABERRANT GAMETOGENESIS 1 is essential for meiosis in rice.	 These results suggested that OsAGG1 played an important role in crossover (CO) formation
