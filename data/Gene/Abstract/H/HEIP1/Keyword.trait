HEIP1|OsAGG1	meiosis	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.
HEIP1|OsAGG1	meiotic	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	 HEIP1 colocalizes with HEI10 in a dynamic fashion along the meiotic chromosomes and specially localizes onto crossover sites from late pachytene to diplotene
HEIP1|OsAGG1	crossover	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.
HEIP1|OsAGG1	crossover	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	 HEIP1 colocalizes with HEI10 in a dynamic fashion along the meiotic chromosomes and specially localizes onto crossover sites from late pachytene to diplotene
HEIP1|OsAGG1	meiotic	The plant-specific gene ABERRANT GAMETOGENESIS 1 is essential for meiosis in rice.	 Overall, our work showed that OsAGG1 is a novel and critical component for rice meiotic CO formation, thus expanding our understanding of meiotic progression
HEIP1|OsAGG1	crossover	The plant-specific gene ABERRANT GAMETOGENESIS 1 is essential for meiosis in rice.	 These results suggested that OsAGG1 played an important role in crossover (CO) formation
HEIP1|OsAGG1	meiotic	HEIP1 is required for efficient meiotic crossover implementation and is conserved from plants to humans.	HEIP1 is required for efficient meiotic crossover implementation and is conserved from plants to humans.
HEIP1|OsAGG1	meiotic	HEIP1 is required for efficient meiotic crossover implementation and is conserved from plants to humans.	 Here, we establish and decipher the function of the Arabidopsis thaliana HEIP1 homolog in meiotic crossover formation and report its wide conservation in eukaryotes
HEIP1|OsAGG1	meiotic	HEIP1 is required for efficient meiotic crossover implementation and is conserved from plants to humans.	 We show that the loss of Arabidopsis HEIP1 elicits a marked reduction in meiotic COs and their redistribution toward chromosome ends
HEIP1|OsAGG1	crossover	HEIP1 is required for efficient meiotic crossover implementation and is conserved from plants to humans.	HEIP1 is required for efficient meiotic crossover implementation and is conserved from plants to humans.
HEIP1|OsAGG1	crossover	HEIP1 is required for efficient meiotic crossover implementation and is conserved from plants to humans.	 Here, we establish and decipher the function of the Arabidopsis thaliana HEIP1 homolog in meiotic crossover formation and report its wide conservation in eukaryotes
HEIP1|OsAGG1	crossover	HEIP1 is required for efficient meiotic crossover implementation and is conserved from plants to humans.	 Further, we show that HEIP1 acts both prior to crossover designation, as the number of MLH1 foci is reduced in heip1, and at the maturation step of MLH1-marked sites into COs
