HEI10	HEIP1|OsAGG1	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	 Here, through screening for HEI10-interacting proteins via a yeast two-hybrid system, we identify a CO protein HEI10 Interaction Protein 1 (HEIP1) in rice
HEI10	HEIP1|OsAGG1	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	 HEIP1 colocalizes with HEI10 in a dynamic fashion along the meiotic chromosomes and specially localizes onto crossover sites from late pachytene to diplotene
HEI10	HEIP1|OsAGG1	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	 Between these two proteins, HEI10 is required for the loading of HEIP1, but not vice versa
HEIP1|OsAGG1	MER3|RCK	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	 In addition, the loading of HEIP1 depends on ZIP4, but not on MER3, MSH4, or MSH5
HEIP1|OsAGG1	ZIP4|SPO22	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	 HEIP1 interacts directly with ZIP4 and MSH5
HEIP1|OsAGG1	ZIP4|SPO22	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	 In addition, the loading of HEIP1 depends on ZIP4, but not on MER3, MSH4, or MSH5
HEIP1|OsAGG1	OsMSH5	The plant-specific gene ABERRANT GAMETOGENESIS 1 is essential for meiosis in rice.	 Moreover, OsAGG1 was found to interact with ZMM proteins OsHEI10, OsZIP4 and OsMSH5
HEIP1|OsAGG1	OsZIP4	The plant-specific gene ABERRANT GAMETOGENESIS 1 is essential for meiosis in rice.	 Moreover, OsAGG1 was found to interact with ZMM proteins OsHEI10, OsZIP4 and OsMSH5
