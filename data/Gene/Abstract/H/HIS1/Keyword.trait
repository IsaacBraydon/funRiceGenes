HIS1	resistance	A rice gene that confers broad-spectrum resistance to Î²-triketone herbicides.	 Here we identify a rice gene, HIS1 (HPPD INHIBITOR SENSITIVE 1), that confers resistance to BBC and other Î²-triketone herbicides
HIS1	resistance	A rice gene that confers broad-spectrum resistance to Î²-triketone herbicides.	 Forced expression of HIS1 in Arabidopsis conferred resistance not only to BBC but also to four additional Î²-triketone herbicides
HIS1	breeding	A rice gene that confers broad-spectrum resistance to Î²-triketone herbicides.	 HIS1 may prove useful for breeding herbicide-resistant crops
HIS1	resistance	Exploring Natural Allelic Variations of the ¦Â-Triketone Herbicide Resistance Gene HIS1 for Application in indica Rice and Particularly in Two-Line Hybrid Rice	Exploring Natural Allelic Variations of the ¦Â-Triketone Herbicide Resistance Gene HIS1 for Application in indica Rice and Particularly in Two-Line Hybrid Rice
HIS1	resistance	Exploring Natural Allelic Variations of the ¦Â-Triketone Herbicide Resistance Gene HIS1 for Application in indica Rice and Particularly in Two-Line Hybrid Rice	  Results: By analyzing haplotypes of the bTHs broad-spectrum resistance gene HIS1 and phenotypes for BBC in 493 major indica rice accessions in China, we identified a novel non-functional allelic variant of HIS1 in addition to the previously reported 28-bp deletion
HIS1	seed	Exploring Natural Allelic Variations of the ¦Â-Triketone Herbicide Resistance Gene HIS1 for Application in indica Rice and Particularly in Two-Line Hybrid Rice	 Finally, allelic variations of the HIS1 gene may also play an important role in the mechanized seed production of hybrid rice
HIS1	sterile	Exploring Natural Allelic Variations of the ¦Â-Triketone Herbicide Resistance Gene HIS1 for Application in indica Rice and Particularly in Two-Line Hybrid Rice	 In addition, due to natural allelic variations of the HIS1 gene in the sterile and restorer lines, some two-line hybrid sterile lines were sensitive to bTHs, and the corresponding restorers were resistant
