HIS1	resistance	A rice gene that confers broad-spectrum resistance to β-triketone herbicides.	 Here we identify a rice gene, HIS1 (HPPD INHIBITOR SENSITIVE 1), that confers resistance to BBC and other β-triketone herbicides
HIS1	resistance	A rice gene that confers broad-spectrum resistance to β-triketone herbicides.	 Forced expression of HIS1 in Arabidopsis conferred resistance not only to BBC but also to four additional β-triketone herbicides
HIS1	breeding	A rice gene that confers broad-spectrum resistance to β-triketone herbicides.	 HIS1 may prove useful for breeding herbicide-resistant crops
