NA	A rice gene that confers broad-spectrum resistance to Î²-triketone herbicides.	2019	Science	Institute of Crop Science, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba 305-8518, Japan.	The genetic variation of rice cultivars provides a resource for further varietal improvement through breeding. Some rice varieties are sensitive to benzobicyclon (BBC), a Î²-triketone herbicide that inhibits 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD). Here we identify a rice gene, HIS1 (HPPD INHIBITOR SENSITIVE 1), that confers resistance to BBC and other Î²-triketone herbicides. We show that HIS1 encodes an Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase that detoxifies Î²-triketone herbicides by catalyzing their hydroxylation. Genealogy analysis revealed that BBC-sensitive rice variants inherited a dysfunctional his1 allele from an indica rice variety. Forced expression of HIS1 in Arabidopsis conferred resistance not only to BBC but also to four additional Î²-triketone herbicides. HIS1 may prove useful for breeding herbicide-resistant crops.
NA	Exploring Natural Allelic Variations of the ¦Â-Triketone Herbicide Resistance Gene HIS1 for Application in indica Rice and Particularly in Two-Line Hybrid Rice	2021	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Center, Changsha, China.	Background: Benzobicyclon (BBC) is a ¦Â-triketone herbicide (bTH) used in rice paddy fields. It has the advantages of high efficiency, low toxicity, high crop safety, and good environmental compatibility, and shows efficacy against paddy weeds resistant to other types of herbicides. However, as some important indica rice varieties are susceptible to BBC, BBC is currently only registered and applied in japonica rice cultivation areas.  Results: By analyzing haplotypes of the bTHs broad-spectrum resistance gene HIS1 and phenotypes for BBC in 493 major indica rice accessions in China, we identified a novel non-functional allelic variant of HIS1 in addition to the previously reported 28-bp deletion. Through detection with markers specific to the two non-functional mutations, it was clear that 25.4% of indica conventional varieties, 59.9% of fertility restorers, and 15.9% of sterile lines were susceptible to BBC. In addition, due to natural allelic variations of the HIS1 gene in the sterile and restorer lines, some two-line hybrid sterile lines were sensitive to bTHs, and the corresponding restorers were resistant. We showed the potential effectiveness of using bTHs to address the issue of two-line hybrid rice seed purity stemming from the self-crossing of sterile lines during hybrid rice seed production. Finally, allelic variations of the HIS1 gene may also play an important role in the mechanized seed production of hybrid rice.  Conclusions: Our findings offer guidance for the application of BBC in indica rice areas and provide a non-transgenic approach to address the seed purity issue of two-line hybrid rice.
