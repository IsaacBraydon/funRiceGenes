The genetic variation of rice cultivars provides a resource for further varietal improvement through breeding. Some rice varieties are sensitive to benzobicyclon (BBC), a β-triketone herbicide that inhibits 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD). Here we identify a rice gene, HIS1 (HPPD INHIBITOR SENSITIVE 1), that confers resistance to BBC and other β-triketone herbicides. We show that HIS1 encodes an Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase that detoxifies β-triketone herbicides by catalyzing their hydroxylation. Genealogy analysis revealed that BBC-sensitive rice variants inherited a dysfunctional his1 allele from an indica rice variety. Forced expression of HIS1 in Arabidopsis conferred resistance not only to BBC but also to four additional β-triketone herbicides. HIS1 may prove useful for breeding herbicide-resistant crops.
