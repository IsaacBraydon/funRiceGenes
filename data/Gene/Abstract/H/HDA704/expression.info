HDA704	 Overexpression of HDA704 in transgenic rice promoted stomatal closure, decreased the number of stomata and slowed down the rate of water loss, consequently resulting in increased drought and salt tolerance |  Our results showed that HDA704 directly binds to DST and ABIL2, repressing their expression via histone deacetylation modification |  Collectively, these findings reveal that HDA704 positively regulates drought and salt tolerance by repressing the expression of DST and ABIL2	 Overexpression of HDA704 in transgenic rice promoted stomatal closure, decreased the number of stomata and slowed down the rate of water loss, consequently resulting in increased drought and salt tolerance
