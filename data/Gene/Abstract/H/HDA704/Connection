DST|WL1|HST1	HDA704	Rice histone deacetylase HDA704 positively regulates drought and salt tolerance by controlling stomatal aperture and density.	 HDA704 negatively regulates stomatal aperture and density, repressing the transcription of DST and ABIL2 by histone deacetylation modification
DST|WL1|HST1	HDA704	Rice histone deacetylase HDA704 positively regulates drought and salt tolerance by controlling stomatal aperture and density.	 Our results showed that HDA704 directly binds to DST and ABIL2, repressing their expression via histone deacetylation modification
DST|WL1|HST1	HDA704	Rice histone deacetylase HDA704 positively regulates drought and salt tolerance by controlling stomatal aperture and density.	 Collectively, these findings reveal that HDA704 positively regulates drought and salt tolerance by repressing the expression of DST and ABIL2
HDA704	OsABIL2	Rice histone deacetylase HDA704 positively regulates drought and salt tolerance by controlling stomatal aperture and density	Our results showed that HDA704 directly binds to DST and ABIL2, repressing their expression via histone deacetylation modification.
HDA704	OsWR2	OsWR2 recruits HDA704 to regulate the deacetylation of H4K8ac in the promoter of OsABI5 in response to drought stress.	OsWR2 recruits HDA704 to regulate the deacetylation of H4K8ac in the promoter of OsABI5 in response to drought stress.
HDA704	OsWR2	OsWR2 recruits HDA704 to regulate the deacetylation of H4K8ac in the promoter of OsABI5 in response to drought stress.	 Moreover, HDA704 was recruited by a drought-resistant transcription factor, WAX SYNTHESIS REGULATORY 2 (OsWR2), and co-regulated the expression of the ABA biosynthesis genes NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE 3 (NCED3), NCED4, and NCED5 under drought stress
