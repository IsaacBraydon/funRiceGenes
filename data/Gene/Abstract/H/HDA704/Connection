DST	HDA704	Rice histone deacetylase HDA704 positively regulates drought and salt tolerance by controlling stomatal aperture and density.	 HDA704 negatively regulates stomatal aperture and density, repressing the transcription of DST and ABIL2 by histone deacetylation modification
DST	HDA704	Rice histone deacetylase HDA704 positively regulates drought and salt tolerance by controlling stomatal aperture and density.	 Our results showed that HDA704 directly binds to DST and ABIL2, repressing their expression via histone deacetylation modification
DST	HDA704	Rice histone deacetylase HDA704 positively regulates drought and salt tolerance by controlling stomatal aperture and density.	 Collectively, these findings reveal that HDA704 positively regulates drought and salt tolerance by repressing the expression of DST and ABIL2
