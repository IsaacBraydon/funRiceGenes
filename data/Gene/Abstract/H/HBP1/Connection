Ehd1	HBP1	Two interacting basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors control flowering time in rice.	 CRISPR/Cas9-generated knockout mutations of HBP1, but not POH1 mutations, promoted earlier flowering time; conversely, HBP1 and POH1 overexpression delayed flowering time in rice under long-day and short-day conditions by activating the expression of Hd1 and suppressing the expression of Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Heading date 3a (Hd3a), and Rice Flowering locus T 1 (RFT1), thus controlling flowering time in rice
HBP1	Hd1	Two interacting basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors control flowering time in rice.	 In this study, two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, Hd1 Binding Protein 1 (HBP1) and Partner of HBP1 (POH1) were identified as transcriptional regulators of Hd1
HBP1	Hd1	Two interacting basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors control flowering time in rice.	 Both HBP1 and POH1 bound directly to the cis-acting elements located in the promoter of Hd1 to activate its expression
