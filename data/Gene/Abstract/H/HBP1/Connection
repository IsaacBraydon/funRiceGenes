Ehd1	HBP1|OsbHLH111|OsSGI1	Two interacting basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors control flowering time in rice.	 CRISPR/Cas9-generated knockout mutations of HBP1, but not POH1 mutations, promoted earlier flowering time; conversely, HBP1 and POH1 overexpression delayed flowering time in rice under long-day and short-day conditions by activating the expression of Hd1 and suppressing the expression of Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Heading date 3a (Hd3a), and Rice Flowering locus T 1 (RFT1), thus controlling flowering time in rice
HBP1|OsbHLH111|OsSGI1	Hd1	Two interacting basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors control flowering time in rice.	 In this study, two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, Hd1 Binding Protein 1 (HBP1) and Partner of HBP1 (POH1) were identified as transcriptional regulators of Hd1
HBP1|OsbHLH111|OsSGI1	Hd1	Two interacting basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors control flowering time in rice.	 Both HBP1 and POH1 bound directly to the cis-acting elements located in the promoter of Hd1 to activate its expression

CRISPR/Cas9-generated knockout mutations of HBP1, but not POH1 mutations, promoted earlier flowering time; conversely, HBP1 and POH1 overexpression delayed flowering time in rice under long-day and short-day conditions by activating the expression of Hd1 and suppressing the expression of Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Heading date 3a (Hd3a), and Rice Flowering locus T 1 (RFT1), thus controlling flowering time in rice

CRISPR/Cas9-generated knockout mutations of HBP1, but not POH1 mutations, promoted earlier flowering time; conversely, HBP1 and POH1 overexpression delayed flowering time in rice under long-day and short-day conditions by activating the expression of Hd1 and suppressing the expression of Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Heading date 3a (Hd3a), and Rice Flowering locus T 1 (RFT1), thus controlling flowering time in rice

HBP1|OsbHLH111|OsSGI1	OsTPP7|AG1	Sugar starvation activates the OsSnRK1a-OsbHLH111/OsSGI1-OsTPP7 module to mediate growth inhibition of rice.	 Subsequently, OsSnRK1a-dependent phosphorylation of OsSGI1 enhanced the direct binding to the E-box of trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase 7 (OsTPP7) promoter, thus rose the transcription inhibition on OsTPP7, then elevated trehalose 6-phosphate (Tre6P) content but decreased sucrose content

Overall, we established the OsSGI1-OsTPP7-Tre6P loop with OsSnRK1a as center and OsSGI1 as forward, which is activated by sugar starvation to regulate sugar homeostasis and thus inhibits rice growth
