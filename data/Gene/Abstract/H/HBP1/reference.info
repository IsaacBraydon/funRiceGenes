NA	Two interacting basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors control flowering time in rice.	2022	Plant Physiol	Rice Research Institute, Shenyang Agricultural University, 120 Dongling Road, Shenhe District, Shenyang 110866, China.	Flowering time is one of the most important agronomic traits affecting the adaptation and yield of rice (Oryza sativa). Heading date 1 (Hd1) is a key factor in the photoperiodic control of flowering time. In this study, two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, Hd1 Binding Protein 1 (HBP1) and Partner of HBP1 (POH1) were identified as transcriptional regulators of Hd1. We generated knockout mutants of HBP1 and ectopically expressed transgenic lines of the two bHLH transcription factors and used these lines to investigate the roles of these two factors in regulating flowering time. HBP1 physically associated or heterodimers to perform their functions. Both HBP1 and POH1 bound directly to the cis-acting elements located in the promoter of Hd1 to activate its expression. CRISPR/Cas9-generated knockout mutations of HBP1, but not POH1 mutations, promoted earlier flowering time; conversely, HBP1 and POH1 overexpression delayed flowering time in rice under long-day and short-day conditions by activating the expression of Hd1 and suppressing the expression of Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Heading date 3a (Hd3a), and Rice Flowering locus T 1 (RFT1), thus controlling flowering time in rice. Our findings revealed a mechanism for flowering time control through transcriptional regulation of Hd1 and laid theoretical and practical foundations for improving the growth period, adaptation, and yield of rice.
NA	Sugar starvation activates the OsSnRK1a-OsbHLH111/OsSGI1-OsTPP7 module to mediate growth inhibition of rice.	2023	Plant Biotechnol J	College of Plant Protection, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.	Sugar deficiency is the persistent challenge for plants during development. Trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) is recognized as a key regulator in balancing plant sugar homeostasis. However, the underlying mechanisms by which sugar starvation limits plant development are unclear. Here, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor (OsbHLH111) was named starvation-associated growth inhibitor 1 (OsSGI1) and the focus is on the sugar shortage of rice. The transcript and protein levels of OsSGI1 were markedly increased during sugar starvation. The knockout mutants sgi1-1/2/3 exhibited increased grain size and promoted seed germination and vegetative growth, which were opposite to those of overexpression lines. The direct binding of OsSGI1 to sucrose non-fermenting-1 (SNF1)-related protein kinase 1a (OsSnRK1a) was enhanced during sugar shortage. Subsequently, OsSnRK1a-dependent phosphorylation of OsSGI1 enhanced the direct binding to the E-box of trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase 7 (OsTPP7) promoter, thus rose the transcription inhibition on OsTPP7, then elevated trehalose 6-phosphate (Tre6P) content but decreased sucrose content. Meanwhile, OsSnRK1a degraded phosphorylated-OsSGI1 by proteasome pathway to prevent the cumulative toxicity of OsSGI1. Overall, we established the OsSGI1-OsTPP7-Tre6P loop with OsSnRK1a as center and OsSGI1 as forward, which is activated by sugar starvation to regulate sugar homeostasis and thus inhibits rice growth.
