HBP1|OsbHLH111|OsSGI1	transcription factor	Two interacting basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors control flowering time in rice.	 In this study, two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, Hd1 Binding Protein 1 (HBP1) and Partner of HBP1 (POH1) were identified as transcriptional regulators of Hd1
HBP1|OsbHLH111|OsSGI1	transcription factor	Two interacting basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors control flowering time in rice.	 We generated knockout mutants of HBP1 and ectopically expressed transgenic lines of the two bHLH transcription factors and used these lines to investigate the roles of these two factors in regulating flowering time
HBP1|OsbHLH111|OsSGI1	heading date	Two interacting basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors control flowering time in rice.	 CRISPR/Cas9-generated knockout mutations of HBP1, but not POH1 mutations, promoted earlier flowering time; conversely, HBP1 and POH1 overexpression delayed flowering time in rice under long-day and short-day conditions by activating the expression of Hd1 and suppressing the expression of Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Heading date 3a (Hd3a), and Rice Flowering locus T 1 (RFT1), thus controlling flowering time in rice

HBP1|OsbHLH111|OsSGI1	transcriptional regulator	Two interacting basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors control flowering time in rice.	 In this study, two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, Hd1 Binding Protein 1 (HBP1) and Partner of HBP1 (POH1) were identified as transcriptional regulators of Hd1
