H2B	OsTrx1|SDG723	OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.	 Together, our results (i) reveal that OsHUB2 represses the function of OsTrx1 and H3K4me3 levels at Ehd1 and (ii) suggest that OsHUB2-mediated H2B ubiquitination plays critical roles together with H3K4me3 in rice heading date regulation
H2B	OsHUB2|FRRP1	OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.	 OsHUB2 directly bound to Ehd1 to ubiquitinate H2B at Ehd1, and H2B ubiquitination levels were reduced in oshub2-2 and oshub2-3 mutants

H2B	OsUBR7	Rice OsUBR7 modulates plant height by regulating histone H2B monoubiquitination and cell proliferation.	Rice OsUBR7 modulates plant height by regulating histone H2B monoubiquitination and cell proliferation.
H2B	OsUBR7	Rice OsUBR7 modulates plant height by regulating histone H2B monoubiquitination and cell proliferation.	 OsUBR7 interacts with histones and monoubiquitinates H2B (H2Bub1) at lysine148 with coordination of the E2 conjugase OsUBC18
