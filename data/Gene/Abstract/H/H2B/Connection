H2B	OsTrx1|SDG723	OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.	 Together, our results (i) reveal that OsHUB2 represses the function of OsTrx1 and H3K4me3 levels at Ehd1 and (ii) suggest that OsHUB2-mediated H2B ubiquitination plays critical roles together with H3K4me3 in rice heading date regulation
