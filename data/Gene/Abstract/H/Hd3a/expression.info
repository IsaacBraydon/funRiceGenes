Hd3a	Identification of the Regulatory Region Responsible for Vascular Tissue-Specific Expression in the RiceHd3aPromoter.
Hd3a	 We quantified the following: the expression of five major flowering genes in HH1, T1C-19, and MH63; florigen Hd3a protein expression levels in HH1 and MH63; interactions between Cry1Ab/c and the five main flowering proteins; and the effects of E3s ubiquitin ligase-mediated Cry1Ab/c expression on florigen Hd3a |  When Cry1Ab/c, Hd3a, and E3s fusion proteins were transiently co-expressed in tobacco cells, the Hd3a expression level was significantly lower than the level of Cry1Ab/c and Hd3a co-expression |  Thus, the downregulation of Hd3a expression and the interaction between Cry1Ab/c and Hd3a interfere with Hd3a protein expression and might cooperatively delay HH1 flowering time
Hd3a	 The triple complex of Ghd8-OsHAP5C-Ghd7 directly bound to the promotor of Hd3a and downregulated the expression of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1, and finally resulted in a delayed heading
