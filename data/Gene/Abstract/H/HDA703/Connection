Ghd7	HDA703	Ammonium protects rice against rice stripe virus by activating HDA703/OsBZR1-mediated BR signaling.	 Consistently, increase of the expression of HDA703 or decrease of the expression of Ghd7 enhances rice resistance to RSV
HDA703	OsBZR1|BZR1	Ammonium protects rice against rice stripe virus by activating HDA703/OsBZR1-mediated BR signaling.	 HDA703, a histone deacetylase and OsBZR1, a transcription factor, are two positive regulator of BR signaling and interact with each other
HDA703	OsBZR1|BZR1	Ammonium protects rice against rice stripe virus by activating HDA703/OsBZR1-mediated BR signaling.	 We also show that in contrast to NO(3)(-), NH(4)(+) does not affect BR biosynthesis but promotes BR signaling by upregulating the expression of HDA703 and promoting the accumulation of OsBZR1 in rice shoots
