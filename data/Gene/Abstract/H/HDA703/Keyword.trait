HDA703	BR	Ammonium protects rice against rice stripe virus by activating HDA703/OsBZR1-mediated BR signaling.	 We also show that in contrast to NO(3)(-), NH(4)(+) does not affect BR biosynthesis but promotes BR signaling by upregulating the expression of HDA703 and promoting the accumulation of OsBZR1 in rice shoots
HDA703	BR signaling	Ammonium protects rice against rice stripe virus by activating HDA703/OsBZR1-mediated BR signaling.	 We also show that in contrast to NO(3)(-), NH(4)(+) does not affect BR biosynthesis but promotes BR signaling by upregulating the expression of HDA703 and promoting the accumulation of OsBZR1 in rice shoots
HDA703	resistance	Ammonium protects rice against rice stripe virus by activating HDA703/OsBZR1-mediated BR signaling.	 Consistently, increase of the expression of HDA703 or decrease of the expression of Ghd7 enhances rice resistance to RSV
