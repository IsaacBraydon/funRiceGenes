Ammonium (NH(4)(+)) is a major inorganic nitrogen source for plants and also as a signal regulates plant growth and defense. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of steroid hormones that control plant developmental and physiological processes through its signaling pathway. Rice is a kind of NH(4)(+)-preferring plant which responds to virus infection involving in the regulation of BR biosynthesis and signaling. However, the BR-mediated regulatory mechanisms in rice-virus interactions are not fully understood. In addition, it remains unknown whether there is a direct link between NH(4)(+) and BRs in regulating rice response to virus. HDA703, a histone deacetylase and OsBZR1, a transcription factor, are two positive regulator of BR signaling and interact with each other. In this study, we show that rice plants grown with NH(4)(+) as the sole N source have enhanced resistance to rice stripe virus (RSV), one of the most devastating viruses of rice, than those grown with NO(3)(-) as the sole N source. We also show that in contrast to NO(3)(-), NH(4)(+) does not affect BR biosynthesis but promotes BR signaling by upregulating the expression of HDA703 and promoting the accumulation of OsBZR1 in rice shoots. We further show that BR biosynthesis and signaling is required for rice defense against RSV and BR-mediated resistance to RSV attributes to activating HDA703/OsBZR1 module, then decreasing the expression of Ghd7, a direct target of HDA703/OsBZR1. Consistently, increase of the expression of HDA703 or decrease of the expression of Ghd7 enhances rice resistance to RSV. Together, our study reveals that activation of HDA703/OsBZR1-Ghd7 signaling cascade is an undescribed mechanism conferring BR-mediated RSV resistance and NH(4)(+) protects rice against RSV by activating HDA703/OsBZR1-Ghd7-mediated BR signaling in rice.
