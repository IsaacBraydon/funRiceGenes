HDA703	 We also show that in contrast to NO(3)(-), NH(4)(+) does not affect BR biosynthesis but promotes BR signaling by upregulating the expression of HDA703 and promoting the accumulation of OsBZR1 in rice shoots |  We further show that BR biosynthesis and signaling is required for rice defense against RSV and BR-mediated resistance to RSV attributes to activating HDA703/OsBZR1 module, then decreasing the expression of Ghd7, a direct target of HDA703/OsBZR1 |  Consistently, increase of the expression of HDA703 or decrease of the expression of Ghd7 enhances rice resistance to RSV
