HOS59	transcription factor	KNOX II transcription factor HOS59 functions in regulating rice grain size.	KNOX II transcription factor HOS59 functions in regulating rice grain size.
HOS59	grain	KNOX II transcription factor HOS59 functions in regulating rice grain size.	KNOX II transcription factor HOS59 functions in regulating rice grain size.
HOS59	grain	KNOX II transcription factor HOS59 functions in regulating rice grain size.	 Meanwhile, our IP-MS datasets showed that HOS59 was closely associated with BELL family proteins, some grain size regulators (OsSPL13, OsSPL16, OsSPL18, SLG, etc
HOS59	grain	KNOX II transcription factor HOS59 functions in regulating rice grain size.	 Compared with wild-type plants, the hos59 mutants have longer grains and increased glume cell length, a loose plant architecture, and drooping leaves, while the overexpression lines showed smaller grain size, erect leaves, and lower plant height
HOS59	grain	KNOX II transcription factor HOS59 functions in regulating rice grain size.	 The qRT-PCR results showed that mutation of the HOS59 gene led to upregulation of some grain size-related genes such as OsSPL13, OsSPL18, and PGL2
HOS59	grain	KNOX II transcription factor HOS59 functions in regulating rice grain size.	 In summary, our results indicate that HOS59 may be a repressor of the downstream target genes, negatively regulating glume cell length, rice grain size, plant architecture, etc
