HOS59	 Furthermore, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 editing and transgenic approaches to generate hos59 mutants and overexpression lines, respectively |  Compared with wild-type plants, the hos59 mutants have longer grains and increased glume cell length, a loose plant architecture, and drooping leaves, while the overexpression lines showed smaller grain size, erect leaves, and lower plant height	 Furthermore, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 editing and transgenic approaches to generate hos59 mutants and overexpression lines, respectively |  Compared with wild-type plants, the hos59 mutants have longer grains and increased glume cell length, a loose plant architecture, and drooping leaves, while the overexpression lines showed smaller grain size, erect leaves, and lower plant height
