NA	A novel discovery of an LTR retrotransposon-induced hybrid weakness in rice.	2018	J Exp Bot	Rice Research Institute, Yunnan Agriculture University, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, China.	Hybrid weakness is a post-zygotic hybridization barrier frequently observed in plants, including rice. In this study, we describe the genomic variation among three temperate japonica rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) varieties 'Aranghyangchalbyeo' ('CH7'), 'Sanghaehyangheolua' ('CH8') and 'Shinseonchalbyeo' ('CH9'), carrying different hybrid weakness genes. The reciprocal progenies obtained from crossing any two varieties displayed characteristic hybrid weakness traits. We mapped and cloned a new locus, Hwc3 (hybrid weakness 3), on chromosome 4. Sequence analysis identified that an LTR retrotransposon was inserted into the promoter region of the Hwc3 gene in CH7. A 4-kb DNA fragment from CH7 containing the Hwc3 gene with the inserted LTR retrotransposon was able to induce hybrid weakness in hybrids with CH8 plants carrying the Hwc1 gene by genetic complementation. We investigated the differential gene expression profile of F1 plants exhibiting hybrid weakness and detected that the genes associated with energy metabolism were significantly down-regulated compared to the parents. Based on our results, we propose that LTR retrotransposons could be a potential cause of hybrid weakness in intra-subspecific hybrids in japonica rice. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying intra-subspecific hybrid weakness has significance for increasing our knowledge on reproductive isolation and could have significant implications for rice improvement and hybrid breeding.
NA	Multiple Alleles Encoding Atypical NLRs with Unique Central Tandem Repeats in Rice Confer Resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae	2020	Plant Commun	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Plants have developed various mechanisms for avoiding pathogen invasion, including resistance (R) genes. Most R genes encode nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing proteins (NLRs). Here, we report the isolation of three new bacterial blight R genes in rice, Xa1-2, Xa14, and Xa31(t), which were allelic to Xa1 and encoded atypical NLRs with unique central tandem repeats (CTRs). We also found that Xa31(t) was the same gene as Xa1-2. Although Xa1-2 and Xa14 conferred different resistance spectra, their performance could be attenuated by iTALEs, as has previously been reported for Xa1. XA1, XA1-2, XA14, and non-resistant RGAF differed mainly in the substructure of the leucine-rich repeat domain. They all contained unique CTRs and belonged to the CTR-NLRs, which existed only in Gramineae. We also found that interactions among these genes led to differing resistance performance. In conclusion, our results uncover a unique locus in rice consisting of at least three multiple alleles (Xa1, Xa1-2, and Xa14) that encode CTR-NLRs and confer resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo).
