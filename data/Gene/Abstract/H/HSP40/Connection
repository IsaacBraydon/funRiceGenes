HSP40	OsBAG4	Plasma membrane-localized Hsp40/DNAJ chaperone protein facilitates OsSUVH7-OsBAG4-OsMYB106 transcriptional complex formation for OsHKT1;5 activation.	 Overall, our results reveal a novel function of plasma membrane-localized Hsp40 protein in modulating, alongside chaperon regulator OsBAG4, transcriptional regulation under salinity stress tolerance
