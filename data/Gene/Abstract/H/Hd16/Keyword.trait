CKI|EL1|Hd16	gibberellin	Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing EL1	Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing EL1
CKI|EL1|Hd16	heading date	Genetic interactions involved in the inhibition of heading by heading date QTL, Hd2 in rice under long-day conditions	 In addition, QTLs near Hd2, Hd16, and Ghd7, which are involved in inhibition of heading under long-day conditions, function in the same pathway that controls heading date
CKI|EL1|Hd16	flower	Hd16, a gene for casein kinase I, is involved in the control of rice flowering time by modulating the day-length response	 Map-based cloning revealed that the rice flowering-time quantitative trait locus (QTL) Heading date 16 (Hd16) encodes a casein kinase-I protein| By using near-isogenic lines with functional or deficient alleles of several rice flowering-time genes, we observed significant digenetic interactions between Hd16 and four other flowering-time genes (Ghd7, Hd1, DTH8 and Hd2)| These results demonstrate that Hd16 acts as an inhibitor in the rice flowering pathway by enhancing the photoperiod response as a result of the phosphorylation of Ghd7|Hd16, a gene for casein kinase I, is involved in the control of rice flowering time by modulating the day-length response
CKI|EL1|Hd16	flower	Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing EL1	 In addition, HOX1a suppresses the transcription of early flowering1 (EL1), a negative regulator of GA signaling, and further electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that HOX1a directly bound to the promoter region of EL1 to suppress its expression and stimulate GA signaling
CKI|EL1|Hd16	flower	Rice early flowering1, a CKI, phosphorylates DELLA protein SLR1 to negatively regulate gibberellin signalling	Rice early flowering1, a CKI, phosphorylates DELLA protein SLR1 to negatively regulate gibberellin signalling
CKI|EL1|Hd16	heading date	Hd16, a gene for casein kinase I, is involved in the control of rice flowering time by modulating the day-length response	 Map-based cloning revealed that the rice flowering-time quantitative trait locus (QTL) Heading date 16 (Hd16) encodes a casein kinase-I protein
CKI|EL1|Hd16	flower	Rice early flowering1, a CKI, phosphorylates DELLA protein SLR1 to negatively regulate gibberellin signalling	 To study the relevant regulatory mechanisms, we isolated a rice mutant earlier flowering1, el1, which is deficient in a casein kinase I that has critical roles in both plants and animals
CKI|EL1|Hd16	transcription factor	Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing EL1	Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing EL1
CKI|EL1|Hd16	dwarf	Rice early flowering1, a CKI, phosphorylates DELLA protein SLR1 to negatively regulate gibberellin signalling	 Overexpression of SLR1 in wild-type plants caused a severe dwarf phenotype, which was significantly suppressed by EL1 deficiency, indicating the negative effect of SLR1 on GA signalling requires the EL1 function
CKI|EL1|Hd16	 ga 	Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing EL1	 In addition, HOX1a suppresses the transcription of early flowering1 (EL1), a negative regulator of GA signaling, and further electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that HOX1a directly bound to the promoter region of EL1 to suppress its expression and stimulate GA signaling| These results demonstrate that HOX1a functions as a positive regulator of GA signaling by suppressing EL1, providing informative hints on the study of GA signaling
CKI|EL1|Hd16	flowering time	Hd16, a gene for casein kinase I, is involved in the control of rice flowering time by modulating the day-length response	Hd16, a gene for casein kinase I, is involved in the control of rice flowering time by modulating the day-length response
CKI|EL1|Hd16	gibberellin	Rice early flowering1, a CKI, phosphorylates DELLA protein SLR1 to negatively regulate gibberellin signalling	Rice early flowering1, a CKI, phosphorylates DELLA protein SLR1 to negatively regulate gibberellin signalling
CKI|EL1|Hd16	 ga 	Rice early flowering1, a CKI, phosphorylates DELLA protein SLR1 to negatively regulate gibberellin signalling	 el1 had an enhanced GA response, consistent with the suppression of EL1 expression by exogenous GA(3)| Overexpression of SLR1 in wild-type plants caused a severe dwarf phenotype, which was significantly suppressed by EL1 deficiency, indicating the negative effect of SLR1 on GA signalling requires the EL1 function| This study shows EL1 a novel and key regulator of the GA response and provided important clues on casein kinase I activities in GA signalling and plant development
