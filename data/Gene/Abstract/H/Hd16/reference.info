Heading date is the one of the most important traits in rice breeding, because it defines where rice can be cultivated and influences the expression of various agronomic traits. To examine the inhibition of heading by Heading date 2 (Hd2), previously detected on the distal end of chromosome 7's long arm by quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, we developed backcross inbred lines (BILs) from Koshihikari, a leading Japanese cultivar, and Hayamasari, an extremely early heading cultivar. The BILs were cultivated under natural field conditions in Tsukuba Japan, and under long-day (14.5 h), extremely long-day (18 h), and short-day (10 h) conditions. Combinations of several QTLs near Hd1, Hd2, Ghd7, Hd5, and Hd16 were detected under these four conditions. Analysis of advanced backcross progenies revealed genetic interactions between Hd2 and Hd16 and between Hd2 and Ghd7. In the homozygous Koshihikari genetic background at Hd16, inhibition of heading by the Koshihikari allele at Hd2 was smaller than that with the Hayamasari Hd16 allele. Similarly, in the homozygous Koshihikari genetic background at Ghd7, the difference in heading date caused by different alleles at Hd2 was smaller than in plants homozygous for the Hayamasari Ghd7 allele. Based on these results, we conclude that Hd2 and its genetic interactions play an important role in controlling heading under long-day conditions. In addition, QTLs near Hd2, Hd16, and Ghd7, which are involved in inhibition of heading under long-day conditions, function in the same pathway that controls heading date.
201115131646738183.pdf	Rice early flowering1, a CKI, phosphorylates DELLA protein SLR1 to negatively regulate gibberellin signalling	2010	EMBO J	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, PR China.	The plant hormone gibberellin (GA) is crucial for multiple aspects of plant growth and development. To study the relevant regulatory mechanisms, we isolated a rice mutant earlier flowering1, el1, which is deficient in a casein kinase I that has critical roles in both plants and animals. el1 had an enhanced GA response, consistent with the suppression of EL1 expression by exogenous GA(3). Biochemical characterization showed that EL1 specifically phosphorylates the rice DELLA protein SLR1, proving a direct evidence for SLR1 phosphorylation. Overexpression of SLR1 in wild-type plants caused a severe dwarf phenotype, which was significantly suppressed by EL1 deficiency, indicating the negative effect of SLR1 on GA signalling requires the EL1 function. Further studies showed that the phosphorylation of SLR1 is important for maintaining its activity and stability, and mutation of the candidate phosphorylation site of SLR1 results in the altered GA signalling. This study shows EL1 a novel and key regulator of the GA response and provided important clues on casein kinase I activities in GA signalling and plant development.
67197378.pdf	Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing EL1	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China.	Homeobox transcription factors are involved in various aspects of plant development, including maintenance of the biosynthesis and signaling pathways of different hormones. However, few direct targets of homeobox proteins have been identified. We here show that overexpression of rice homeobox gene HOX1a resulted in enhanced gibberellin (GA) response, indicating a positive effect of HOX1a in GA signaling. HOX1a is induced by GA and encodes a homeobox transcription factor with transcription repression activity. In addition, HOX1a suppresses the transcription of early flowering1 (EL1), a negative regulator of GA signaling, and further electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that HOX1a directly bound to the promoter region of EL1 to suppress its expression and stimulate GA signaling. These results demonstrate that HOX1a functions as a positive regulator of GA signaling by suppressing EL1, providing informative hints on the study of GA signaling.
tpj12268.pdf	Hd16, a gene for casein kinase I, is involved in the control of rice flowering time by modulating the day-length response	2013	Plant J	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602, Japan.	The alteration of photoperiod sensitivity has let breeders diversify flowering time in Oryza sativa (rice) and develop cultivars adjusted to a range of growing season periods. Map-based cloning revealed that the rice flowering-time quantitative trait locus (QTL) Heading date 16 (Hd16) encodes a casein kinase-I protein. One non-synonymous substitution in Hd16 resulted in decreased photoperiod sensitivity in rice, and this substitution occurred naturally in an old rice cultivar. By using near-isogenic lines with functional or deficient alleles of several rice flowering-time genes, we observed significant digenetic interactions between Hd16 and four other flowering-time genes (Ghd7, Hd1, DTH8 and Hd2). In a near-isogenic line with the weak-photoperiod-sensitivity allele of Hd16, transcription levels of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 increased under long-day conditions, and transcription levels of Hd3a and RFT1 decreased under short-day conditions. Expression analysis under continuous light and dark conditions showed that Hd16 was not likely to be associated with circadian clock regulation. Biochemical characterization indicated that the functional Hd16 recombinant protein specifically phosphorylated Ghd7. These results demonstrate that Hd16 acts as an inhibitor in the rice flowering pathway by enhancing the photoperiod response as a result of the phosphorylation of Ghd7.
NA	The Rice Floral Repressor Early flowering1 Affects Spikelet Fertility By Modulating Gibberellin Signaling.	2015	Rice (N Y)	Department of Plant Science, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, and Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, 151-921, Republic of Korea, lifemir7@snu.ac.kr.	Gibberellic acid (GA; or gibberellin) affects the development of floral organs, especially anthers and pollen, and perturbation of development of male floral organs can cause sterility. Many studies of GA signaling have concentrated on anther development, but the effect of GA on grain production remains to be examined.Using a cross of 'Milyang23 (M23)', which has a functional allele of Early flowering1 (EL1), and 'H143', which has a nonfunctional el1 allele, we generated heterogeneous inbred family-near isogenic lines (HNILs) that are homozygous for EL1 [HNIL(M23)] or el1 [HNIL(H143)]. Here, we found that HNIL(H143) exhibited anther deformities and low pollen viability. The expression of GAMYB, a major activator of GA signaling, and its downstream genes CYP703A3 and KAR, mainly involved in pollen formation, increased abnormally during spikelet development; this activation of GA signaling may cause the sterility. To confirm the negative effect of the el1 mutation on spikelet fertility, we examined a line carrying a T-DNA insertion el1 mutant [hereafter ZH11(el1)] and its parental cultivar 'Zhonghua11 (ZH11)'. ZH11(el1) showed nearly identical defects in anther development and pollen viability as HNIL(H143), leading to decreased seed setting rate. However, the elite japonica cultivar Koshihikari, which has a nonfunctional el1 allele for early flowering in long days, produces fertile spikelets and normal grain yields, like other elite japonica cultivars. This indicates that as-yet-unknown regulator(s) that can overcome the male sterile phenotype of the el1 mutation must have been introduced into Koshihikari.The el1 mutation contributes to early flowering in japonica rice under long days but fails to limit GA signaling, thus negatively affecting spikelet fertility, which results in a loss of grain yield. Thus, EL1 is essential for photoperiod sensitivity in flowering as well as spikelet fertility in grain production.
NA	Fine-tuning of the setting of critical day length by two casein kinases in rice photoperiodic flowering.	2017	J Exp Bot	Functional Plant Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Japan.	Many short-day plants have a critical day length that fixes the schedule for flowering time, limiting the range of natural growth habitats (or growth and cultivation areas). Thus, fine-tuning of the critical day-length setting in photoperiodic flowering determines ecological niches within latitudinal clines; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling the fine-tuning of the critical day-length setting in plants. Previously, we determined that florigen genes are regulated by day length, and identified several key genes involved in setting the critical day length in rice. Using a set of chromosomal segment substitution lines with the genetic background of an elite temperate japonica cultivar, we performed a series of expression analyses of flowering-time genes to identify those responsible for setting the critical day-length in rice. Here, we identified two casein kinase genes, Hd16 and Hd6, which modulate the expression of florigen genes within certain restricted ranges of photoperiod, thereby fine-tuning the critical day length. In addition, we determined that Hd16 functions as an enhancer of the bifunctional action of Hd1 (the Arabidopsis CONSTANS ortholog) in rice. Utilization of the natural variation in Hd16 and Hd6 was only found among temperate japonica cultivars adapted to northern areas. Therefore, this fine-tuning of the setting of the critical day length may contribute to the potential northward expansion of rice cultivation areas.
NA	Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant. In addition to serving as a model plant for molecular genetic studies of monocots, rice is a staple crop for about half of the world population. Heading date is a critical agronomic trait, and many genes controlling heading date have been cloned during the last two decades. The mechanism of flowering in rice from recognition of day length by leaves to floral activation in the shoot apical meristem has been extensively studied. In this review, we summarize current progress on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice with emphasis on post-translational modifications of key regulators, including Heading Date 1 (Hd1), Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Grain Number, Plant Height, and Heading Date7 (Ghd7). The contribution of heading date genes to heterosis and the expansion of rice cultivation areas from low-latitude to high-latitude regions are also discussed. To overcome limitations of diverse genetic backgrounds used in heading date studies and to gain a clearer understanding of flowering in rice, we propose a systematic collection of genetic resources in a common genetic background. Strategies in breeding adapted cultivars by rational design are also discussed.
