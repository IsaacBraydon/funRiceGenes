CKI|EL1|Hd16|OsbHLH35	 Here, we identified two casein kinase genes, Hd16 and Hd6, which modulate the expression of florigen genes within certain restricted ranges of photoperiod, thereby fine-tuning the critical day length
CKI|EL1|Hd16|OsbHLH35	Tightly controlled expression of OsbHLH35 is critical for anther development in rice |  Transactivation assay showed that OsGRF11 negatively regulates OsbHLH35 expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts |  Our data suggest that OsbHLH35 plays an essential role in anther development in rice and the fine control of its expression is crucial to ensure proper seed production
