Ghd7	Hd6|CK2	OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice	On the other hand, mRNA levels of OsGI, Hd1, OsId1, OsDof12, Ghd7, Hd6 and SE5 were unchanged
Hd1	Hd6|CK2	OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice	On the other hand, mRNA levels of OsGI, Hd1, OsId1, OsDof12, Ghd7, Hd6 and SE5 were unchanged
Hd6|CK2	OsDof12|OsCDF1	OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice	On the other hand, mRNA levels of OsGI, Hd1, OsId1, OsDof12, Ghd7, Hd6 and SE5 were unchanged

Hd6|CK2	OsLHY|OsCCA1	The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution	This lack of control of the circadian clock by Hd6 CK2alpha might be due to the presence of glutamate in OsLHY (a CCA1 ortholog in rice) instead of the serine at the corresponding CK2 target site in CCA1
Hd6|CK2	OsLHY|OsCCA1	The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution	We also demonstrated that the other conserved CK2 target sites in OsLHY conferred robust rhythmic expression of OsLHY-LUC under diurnal conditions
Ghd7.1|Hd2|OsPRR37|DTH7	Hd6|CK2	Casein Kinases I and 2α Phosphorylate Oryza Sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator 37 (OsPRR37) in Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice	Casein Kinases I and 2α Phosphorylate Oryza Sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator 37 (OsPRR37) in Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice
CKI|EL1|Hd16	Hd6|CK2	Fine-tuning of the setting of critical day length by two casein kinases in rice photoperiodic flowering.	 Here, we identified two casein kinase genes, Hd16 and Hd6, which modulate the expression of florigen genes within certain restricted ranges of photoperiod, thereby fine-tuning the critical day length
CKI|EL1|Hd16	Hd6|CK2	Fine-tuning of the setting of critical day length by two casein kinases in rice photoperiodic flowering.	 Utilization of the natural variation in Hd16 and Hd6 was only found among temperate japonica cultivars adapted to northern areas
Hd6|CK2	OsCOL4	A Combination of Long-Day Suppressor Genes Contributes to the Northward Expansion of Rice 	 Here, we report the analysis of genetic variation in eight long-day flowering suppressor genes (Hd1, DTH8, Ghd7, OsCOL4, DTH7, Hd6, Se5, and PhyB) and the phylogenetic relationship of eight genes
Hd6|CK2	OsCOL4	A Combination of Long-Day Suppressor Genes Contributes to the Northward Expansion of Rice 	 Genetic variations in DTH8, Ghd7, Hd1, DTH7, PhyB, and OsCOL4 are correlated with differences in heading date and the correlation between the genetic diversity of Hd6 and Se5 and rice heading data are weak
