Hd6|CK2	flowering time	The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution	 In rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant, Heading date6 (Hd6) encodes a CK2alpha subunit that delays flowering time under long-day conditions| Here, we demonstrate that control of flowering time in rice by the Hd6 CK2alpha subunit requires a functional Hd1 gene (an Arabidopsis CONSTANS ortholog) and is independent of the circadian clock mechanism
Hd6|CK2	flower	The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution	 In rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant, Heading date6 (Hd6) encodes a CK2alpha subunit that delays flowering time under long-day conditions| Here, we demonstrate that control of flowering time in rice by the Hd6 CK2alpha subunit requires a functional Hd1 gene (an Arabidopsis CONSTANS ortholog) and is independent of the circadian clock mechanism
Hd6|CK2	flower	The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution	 The circadian clock component CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) is a CK2 target in Arabidopsis, where it influences photoperiodic flowering| In rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant, Heading date6 (Hd6) encodes a CK2alpha subunit that delays flowering time under long-day conditions| Here, we demonstrate that control of flowering time in rice by the Hd6 CK2alpha subunit requires a functional Hd1 gene (an Arabidopsis CONSTANS ortholog) and is independent of the circadian clock mechanism| These findings imply that the role of CK2 in flowering-time regulation in higher plants has diversified during evolution
Hd6|CK2	heading date	The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution	 In rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant, Heading date6 (Hd6) encodes a CK2alpha subunit that delays flowering time under long-day conditions
