HWH1|hwh1	transporter	Fine mapping and candidate gene analysis of hwh1 and hwh2, a set of complementary genes controlling hybrid breakdown in rice.	 A comparison of the sequences of candidate genes among both parents and HB plants revealed that hwh1 encoded a putative glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase with one amino acid change compared to Hwh1 and that hwh2 probably encoded a putative hexose transporter with a six amino acid insertion compared to Hwh2
