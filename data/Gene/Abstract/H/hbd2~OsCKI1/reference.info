One outcome of hybrid breakdown is poor growth, which we observed as a reduction in the number of panicles per plant and in culm length in an F(2) population derived from a cross between the genetically divergent rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars 'Sasanishiki' (japonica) and 'Habataki' (indica). Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of the two traits and two-way ANOVA of the detected QTLs suggested that the poor growth was due mainly to an epistatic interaction between genes at QTLs located on chromosomes 2 and 11. The poor growth was likely to result when a plant was homozygous for the 'Habataki' allele at the QTL on chromosome 2 and homozygous for the 'Sasanishiki' allele at the QTL on chromosome 11. The results suggest that the poor growth found in the F(2) population was due to hybrid breakdown of a set of complementary genes. To test this hypothesis and determine the precise chromosomal location of the genes causing the hybrid breakdown, we performed genetic analyses using a chromosome segment substitution line, in which a part of chromosome 2 from 'Habataki' was substituted into the genetic background of 'Sasanishiki'. The segregation patterns of poor growth in plants suggested that both of the genes underlying the hybrid breakdown were recessive. The gene on chromosome 2, designated hybrid breakdown 2 (hbd2), was mapped between simple sequence repeat markers RM3515 and RM3730. The gene on chromosome 11, hbd3, was mapped between RM5824 and RM1341.

Reproductive barriers are important for the maintenance of species identity. We discovered a reproductive barrier via hybrid breakdown among the progeny of a cross between the japonica rice cultivar Koshihikari and the indica rice cultivar Habataki. Genetic analysis indicated that the hybrid breakdown is regulated by the interaction of two recessive genes: hbd2 in Habataki and hbd3 in Koshihikari. Linkage mapping showed that hbd2 is located near the 100 cM region of chromosome 2 in Habataki, whereas hbd3 is located near the 60 cM region of chromosome 11 in Koshihikari. Construction of nearly isogenic lines for hbd2 and Hbd3 (NIL-hbd2 and NIL-Hbd3), as well as a pyramiding line (NIL-hbd2 + Hbd3), confirmed that the hybrid breakdown is induced by the interaction of these two recessive genes. Our results indicate that these genes are novel for the induction of hybrid breakdown in rice.

Reproductive isolation plays an important role in speciation as it restricts gene flow and accelerates genetic divergence between formerly interbreeding population. In rice, hybrid breakdown is a common reproductive isolation observed in both intra and inter-specific crosses. It is a type of post-zygotic reproductive isolation in which sterility and weakness are manifested in the F(2) and later generations. In this study, the physiological and molecular basis of hybrid breakdown caused by two recessive genes, hbd2 and hbd3, in a cross between japonica variety, Koshihikari, and indica variety, Habataki, were investigated. Fine mapping of hbd2 resulted in the identification of the causal gene as casein kinase I (CKI1). Further analysis revealed that hbd2-CKI1 allele gains its deleterious function that causes the weakness phenotype by a change of one amino acid. As for the other gene, hbd3 was mapped to the NBS-LRR gene cluster region. It is the most common class of R-gene that triggers the immune signal in response to pathogen attack. Expression analysis of pathogen response marker genes suggested that weakness phenotype in this hybrid breakdown can be attributed to an autoimmune response. So far, this is the first evidence linking autoimmune response to post-zygotic isolation in rice. This finding provides a new insight in understanding the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms establishing post-zygotic isolation in plants.

Casein kinases are critical in cell division and differentiation across species. A rice cDNA fragment encoding a putative casein kinase I (CKI) was identified via cDNA macroarray under brassinosteroid (BR) treatment, and a 1939-bp full-length cDNA, OsCKI1, was isolated and found to encode a putative 463-aa protein. RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis indicated that OsCKI1 was constitutively expressed in various rice tissues and upregulated by treatments with BR and abscisic acid (ABA). Enzymatic assay of recombinant OsCKI1 proteins expressed in Escherichia coli showed that the protein was capable of phosphorylating casein. The physiological roles of OsCKI1 were studied through antisense transgenic approaches, and homozygous transgenic plants showed abnormal root development, including fewer lateral and adventitious roots, and shortened primary roots as a result of reduced cell elongation. Treatment of wild-type plants with CKI-7, a specific inhibitor of CKI, also confirmed these functions of OsCKI1. Interestingly, in transgenic and CKI-7-treated plants, exogenously supplied IAA could restore normal root development, and measurement of free IAA content in CKI-deficient primary and adventitious roots revealed altered auxin content, indicating that OsCKI1 is involved in auxin metabolism or that it may affect auxin levels. Transgenic plants were less sensitive than control plants to ABA or BR treatment during germination, suggesting that OsCKI1 may be involved in various hormone-signaling pathways. OsCKI1-GFP fusion studies revealed the localization of OsCKI1 to the nucleus, suggesting a possible involvement in regulation of gene expression. In OsCKI1-deficient plants, differential gene expression was investigated using cDNA chip technology, and results indicated that genes related to signal transduction and hormone metabolism were indeed with altered expression.
