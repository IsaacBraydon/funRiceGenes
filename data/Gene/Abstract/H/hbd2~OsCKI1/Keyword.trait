hbd2|OsCKI1	adventitious root	Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity	 The physiological roles of OsCKI1 were studied through antisense transgenic approaches, and homozygous transgenic plants showed abnormal root development, including fewer lateral and adventitious roots, and shortened primary roots as a result of reduced cell elongation| Interestingly, in transgenic and CKI-7-treated plants, exogenously supplied IAA could restore normal root development, and measurement of free IAA content in CKI-deficient primary and adventitious roots revealed altered auxin content, indicating that OsCKI1 is involved in auxin metabolism or that it may affect auxin levels
hbd2|OsCKI1	brassinosteroid	Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity	 A rice cDNA fragment encoding a putative casein kinase I (CKI) was identified via cDNA macroarray under brassinosteroid (BR) treatment, and a 1939-bp full-length cDNA, OsCKI1, was isolated and found to encode a putative 463-aa protein
hbd2|OsCKI1	root development	Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity	 The physiological roles of OsCKI1 were studied through antisense transgenic approaches, and homozygous transgenic plants showed abnormal root development, including fewer lateral and adventitious roots, and shortened primary roots as a result of reduced cell elongation| Interestingly, in transgenic and CKI-7-treated plants, exogenously supplied IAA could restore normal root development, and measurement of free IAA content in CKI-deficient primary and adventitious roots revealed altered auxin content, indicating that OsCKI1 is involved in auxin metabolism or that it may affect auxin levels|Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity

hbd2|OsCKI1	iaa	Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity	 Interestingly, in transgenic and CKI-7-treated plants, exogenously supplied IAA could restore normal root development, and measurement of free IAA content in CKI-deficient primary and adventitious roots revealed altered auxin content, indicating that OsCKI1 is involved in auxin metabolism or that it may affect auxin levels
hbd2|OsCKI1	 ABA 	Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity	 Transgenic plants were less sensitive than control plants to ABA or BR treatment during germination, suggesting that OsCKI1 may be involved in various hormone-signaling pathways
hbd2|OsCKI1	primary root	Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity	 The physiological roles of OsCKI1 were studied through antisense transgenic approaches, and homozygous transgenic plants showed abnormal root development, including fewer lateral and adventitious roots, and shortened primary roots as a result of reduced cell elongation
hbd2|OsCKI1	auxin	Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity	 Interestingly, in transgenic and CKI-7-treated plants, exogenously supplied IAA could restore normal root development, and measurement of free IAA content in CKI-deficient primary and adventitious roots revealed altered auxin content, indicating that OsCKI1 is involved in auxin metabolism or that it may affect auxin levels
hbd2|OsCKI1	 BR 	Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity	 RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis indicated that OsCKI1 was constitutively expressed in various rice tissues and upregulated by treatments with BR and abscisic acid (ABA)| Transgenic plants were less sensitive than control plants to ABA or BR treatment during germination, suggesting that OsCKI1 may be involved in various hormone-signaling pathways
hbd2|OsCKI1	cell elongation	Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity	 The physiological roles of OsCKI1 were studied through antisense transgenic approaches, and homozygous transgenic plants showed abnormal root development, including fewer lateral and adventitious roots, and shortened primary roots as a result of reduced cell elongation
