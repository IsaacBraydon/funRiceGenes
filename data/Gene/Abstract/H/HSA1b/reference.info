NA	Two tightly linked genes at the hsa1 locus cause both F1 and F2 hybrid sterility in rice.	2015	Mol Plant	Plant genetics Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Shizuoka 411-8540, Japan; Department of Genetics, SOKENDAI (the Graduate University for Advanced Science), Mishima, Shizuoka 411-8540, Japan.

Previously, we characterized three unlinked epistatic loci, hybrid sterility-a1 (hsa1), hsa2 and hsa3, as responsible for the F2 sterility in a cross between Oryza sativa ssp. indica and japonica. In this study, we identified that the hsa1 locus contains two interacting genes, HSA1a and HSA1b, within a 30 kb region. HSA1a-j (japonica allele) encodes a highly conserved plant-specific domain of unknown function protein (DUF1618), whereas, the indica allele (HSA1a-i(s)) has two deletion mutations that cause disruption of domain structure. The second gene, HSA1b-i(s), encodes an uncharacterized protein with some similarity to a nucleotide binding protein. Homozygous introgression of indica HSA1a-i(s)-HSA1b-i(s) alleles into japonica showed female gamete abortion at early mitotic stage. The fact that the recombinant haplotype HSA1a-j-HSA1b-i(s) caused semi-sterility in the heterozygous state with the HSA1a-i(s)-HSA1b-i(s) haplotype suggests that the variation in the hsa1 locus is a possible cause of the wide spectrum of sterility barriers seen in F1 hybrids and successive generations in rice. We propose a simple genetic model to explain how a single causal mechanism can drive both F1 and F2 hybrid sterility.
