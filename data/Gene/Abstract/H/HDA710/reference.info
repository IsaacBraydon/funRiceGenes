Meiosis plays an essential role in the production of gametes and genetic diversity of posterities. The normal double-strand break (DSB) repair is vital to homologous recombination (HR) and occurrence of DNA fragment exchange, but the underlying molecular mechanism remain elusive. Here, we characterized a completely sterile Osmfs1 (male and female sterility 1) mutant which has its pollen and embryo sacs both aborted at the reproductive stage due to severe chromosome defection. Map-based cloning revealed that the OsMFS1 encodes a meiotic coiled-coil protein, and it is responsible for DSB repairing that acts as an important cofactor to stimulate the single strand invasion. Expression pattern analyses showed the OsMFS1 was preferentially expressed in meiosis stage. Subcellular localization analysis of OsMFS1 revealed its association with the nucleus exclusively. In addition, a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and pull-down assay showed that OsMFS1 could physically interact with OsHOP2 protein to form a stable complex to ensure faithful homologous recombination. Taken together, our results indicated that OsMFS1 is indispensable to the normal development of anther and embryo sacs in rice.
NA	OsHDA710-mediated Histone Deacetylation Regulates Callus Formation of Rice Mature Embryo	2020	Plant Cell Physiol.	Institute of Genetic and Regenerative Biology, Key Laboratory for Cell and Gene Engineering of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play important roles in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. The role of HDACs in specialized transcriptional regulation and biological processes is poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the global expression patterns of genes related to epigenetic modifications during callus initiation in rice. We found that the repression of HDAC activity by trichostatin A (TSA) or by OsHDA710 mutation (hda710) results in impaired callus formation of rice mature embryo and increased global histone H3 acetylation levels. The HDAC inhibition decreased auxin response and cell proliferation in callus formation. Meanwhile, the transcriptional repressors OsARF18 and OsARF22 were upregulated in the callus of hda710. The ChIP-qPCR analysis demonstrated that the callus of hda710 exhibited enhanced histone H3 acetylation levels at the chromatin regions of OsARF18 and OsARF22. Furthermore, we found that OsARF18 and OsARF22 were regulated through the OsHDA710 recruitment to their target loci. Additionally, overexpression of OsARF18 decreased the transcription of downstream genes PLT1 and PLT2, and inhibited callus formation of mature embryo. These results demonstrate that OsHDA710 regulates callus formation by suppressing repressive OsARFs via histone deacetylation during callus formation of rice mature embryo. This indicates that OsHDA710-mediated histone deacetylation is an epigenetic regulation pathway for maintaining auxin response during cell dedifferentiation. 
NA	Histone deacetylase HDA710 controls salt tolerance by regulating ABA signaling in rice	2020	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agriculture University, Wuhan, 430030, China.	Plants have evolved numerous mechanisms that assist them in withstanding environmental stresses. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play crucial roles in plant stress responses; however, their regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we explored the function of HDA710/OsHDAC2, a member of the HDAC RPD3/HDA1 family, in stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa). We established that HDA710 localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm and is involved in regulating the acetylation of histone H3 and H4, specifically targeting H4K5 and H4K16 under normal conditions. HDA710 transcript accumulation levels were strongly induced by abiotic stresses including drought and salinity, as well as by the phytohormones jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA). hda710 knockout mutant plants showed enhanced salinity tolerance and reduced ABA sensitivity, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing HDA710 displayed the opposite phenotypes. Moreover, ABA- and salt-stress-responsive genes, such as OsLEA3, OsABI5, OsbZIP72, and OsNHX1, were upregulated in hda710 compared with wild-type plants. These expression differences corresponded with higher levels of histone H4 acetylation in gene promoter regions in hda710 compared with the wild type under ABA and salt-stress treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that HDA710 is involved in regulating ABA- and salt-stress-responsive genes by altering H4 acetylation levels in their promoters.
