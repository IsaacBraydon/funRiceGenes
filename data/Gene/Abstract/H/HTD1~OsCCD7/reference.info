A rice htd-1 mutant, related to tillering and dwarfing, was characterized. We show that the htd-1 mutant increases its tiller number by releasing axillary buds from dormant stage rather than by initiating more axillary buds. The dwarf is caused by averagely reducing each internode and panicle. Based on this dwarfing pattern, the htd-1 mutant could be grouped into dn-type dwarf defined by Takeda (Gamma Field Symp 16:1, 1977). In addition, the dwarfing of the htd-1 mutant was found independent of GA based on the analyses of two GA-mediated processes. Based on the quantitative determination of IAA and ABA and application of the two hormones exogenously to the seedlings, we inferred that the high tillering capacity of the htd-1 mutant should not be attributed to a defect in the synthesis of IAA or ABA. The genetic analysis of the htd-1 mutant indicated that the phenotypes of high tillering and dwarf were controlled by a recessive gene, termed htd1. By map-based cloning, the htd1 gene was fine mapped in a 30-kb DNA region on chromosome 4. Sequencing the target DNA region and comparing the counterpart DNA sequences between the htd-1 mutant and other rice varieties revealed a nucleotide substitution corresponding to an amino acid substitution from prolin to leucine in a predicted rice gene, OsCCD7, the rice orthologous gene of AtMAX3/CCD7. With the evidence of the association between the presence of one amino acid change in OsCCD7 and the abnormal phenotypes of the htd-1 mutant, OsCCD7 was identified as the candidate of the HTD1 gene.
10.1007_s00425-009-0975-6.pdf	Identification and characterization of HTD2: a novel gene negatively regulating tiller bud outgrowth in rice	2009	Planta	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, 310006 Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. lwzzju@163.com	Tiller number is highly regulated by controlling the formation of tiller bud and its subsequent outgrowth in response to endogenous and environmental signals. Here, we identified a rice mutant htd2 from one of the 15,000 transgenic rice lines, which is characterized by a high tillering and dwarf phenotype. Phenotypic analysis of the mutant showed that the mutation did not affect formation of tiller bud, but promoted the subsequent outgrowth of tiller bud. To isolate the htd2 gene, a map-based cloning strategy was employed and 17 new insertions-deletions (InDels) markers were developed. A high-resolution physical map of the chromosomal region around the htd2 gene was made using the F(2) and F(3) population. Finally, the gene was mapped in 12.8 kb region between marker HT41 and marker HT52 within the BAC clone OSJNBa0009J13. Cloning and sequencing of the target region from the mutant showed that the T-DNA insertion caused a 463 bp deletion between the promoter and first exon of an esterase/lipase/thioesterase family gene in the 12.8 kb region. Furthermore, transgenic rice with reduced expression level of the gene exhibited an enhanced tillering and dwarf phenotype. Accordingly, the esterase/lipase/thioesterase family gene (TIGR locus Os03g10620) was identified as the HTD2 gene. HTD2 transcripts were expressed mainly in leaf. Loss of function of HTD2 resulted in a significantly increased expression of HTD1, D10 and D3, which were involved in the strigolactone biosynthetic pathway. The results suggest that the HTD2 gene could negatively regulate tiller bud outgrowth by the strigolactone pathway.
82_361.pdf	Rice tillering dwarf mutant dwarf3 has increased leaf longevity during darkness-induced senescence or hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death	2007	Genes Genet Syst	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo	Senescence or cell death in plant leaves is known to be inducible by darkness or H2O2. When the Arabidopsis gene MAX2/ORE9 is disrupted, leaf senescence or cell death in response to the above stimuli is delayed. Because the rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene DWARF3 (D3) is orthologous to MAX2/ORE9, we wished to know whether disruption of D3 also results in increased longevity in leaves. We found that darkness-induced senescence or H2O2-induced cell death in the third leaf [as measured by chlorophyll degradation, membrane ion leakage and expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs)] in a d3 rice mutant was delayed by 1â€<U+393C><U+3E33>3 d compared to that in its reference line Shiokari. Moreover, the mRNA levels of D3, HTD1 and D10, which are orthologs of Arabidopsis MAX2/ORE9, MAX3 and MAX4, respectively, increased during cell death. These results suggest that D3 protein in rice, like MAX2/ORE9 in Arabidopsis, is involved in leaf senescence or cell death.
j.1365-313X.2006.02916.x.pdf	The rice HIGH-TILLERING DWARF1 encoding an ortholog of Arabidopsis MAX3 is required for negative regulation of the outgrowth of axillary buds	2006	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Rice tillering is an important agronomic trait for grain production. The HIGH-TILLERING DWARF1 (HTD1) gene encodes an ortholog of Arabidopsis MAX3. Complementation analyses for HTD1 confirm that the defect in HTD1 is responsible for both high-tillering and dwarf phenotypes in the htd1 mutant. The rescue of the Arabidopsis max3 mutant phenotype by the introduction of Pro(35S):HTD1 indicates HTD1 is a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase that has the same function as MAX3 in synthesis of a carotenoid-derived signal molecule. The HTD1 gene is expressed in both shoot and root tissues. By evaluating Pro(HTD1):GUS expression, we found that the HTD1 gene is mainly expressed in vascular bundle tissues throughout the plant. Auxin induction of HTD1 expression suggests that auxin may regulate rice tillering partly through upregulation of HTD1 gene transcription. Restoration of dwarf phenotype after the removal of axillary buds indicates that the dwarfism of the htd1 mutant may be a consequence of excessive tiller production. In addition, the expression of HTD1, D3 and OsCCD8a in the htd1 and d3 mutants suggests a feedback mechanism may exist for the synthesis and perception of the carotenoid-derived signal in rice. Characterization of MAX genes in Arabidopsis, and identification of their orthologs in pea, petunia and rice indicates the existence of a conserved mechanism for shoot-branching regulation in both monocots and dicots.
j.1365-313X.2007.03210.x.pdf	DWARF10, an RMS1/MAX4/DAD1 ortholog, controls lateral bud outgrowth in rice	2007	Plant J	Graduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Yayoi, Bunkyo, Tokyo 113-0032, Japan.	Plant architecture is mostly determined by shoot branching patterns. Apical dominance is a well-known control mechanism in the development of branching patterns, but little is known regarding its role in monocots such as rice. Here, we show that the concept of apical dominance can be applied to tiller bud outgrowth of rice. In dwarf10 (d10), an enhanced branching mutant of rice, apical dominance can be observed, but the inhibitory effects of the apical meristem was reduced. D10 is a rice ortholog of MAX4/RMS1/DAD1 that encodes a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8 and is supposed to be involved in the synthesis of an unidentified inhibitor of shoot branching. D10 expression predominantly occurs in vascular cells in most organs. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that accumulation of D10 mRNA is induced by exogenous auxin. Moreover, D10 expression is upregulated in six branching mutants, d3, d10, d14, d17, d27 and high tillering dwarf (htd1). No such effects were found for D3 or HTD1, the MAX2 and MAX3 orthologs, respectively, of rice. These findings imply that D10 transcription might be a critical step in the regulation of the branching inhibitor pathway. In addition, we present observations that suggest that FINE CULM1 (FC1), a rice ortholog of teosinte branched 1 (tb1), possibly works independently of the branching inhibitor pathway.
PEER_stage2_10.1042%2FBJ20080568.pdf	Carotenoid oxygenases involved in plant branching catalyse a highly specific conserved apocarotenoid cleavage reaction	2008	Biochem J	Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg, Faculty of Biology, Institute of Biology II, Schaenzlestrasse 1, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.	Recent studies with the high-tillering mutants in rice (Oryza sativa), the max (more axillary growth) mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana and the rms (ramosus) mutants in pea (Pisum sativum) have indicated the presence of a novel plant hormone that inhibits branching in an auxin-dependent manner. The synthesis of this inhibitor is initiated by the two CCDs [carotenoid-cleaving (di)oxygenases] OsCCD7/OsCCD8b, MAX3/MAX4 and RMS5/RMS1 in rice, Arabidopsis and pea respectively. MAX3 and MAX4 are thought to catalyse the successive cleavage of a carotenoid substrate yielding an apocarotenoid that, possibly after further modification, inhibits the outgrowth of axillary buds. To elucidate the substrate specificity of OsCCD8b, MAX4 and RMS1, we investigated their activities in vitro using naturally accumulated carotenoids and synthetic apocarotenoid substrates, and in vivo using carotenoid-accumulating Escherichia coli strains. The results obtained suggest that these enzymes are highly specific, converting the C27 compounds beta-apo-10'-carotenal and its alcohol into beta-apo-13-carotenone in vitro. Our data suggest that the second cleavage step in the biosynthesis of the plant branching inhibitor is conserved in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species.
NA	A substitution mutation in OsCCD7 cosegregates with dwarf and increased tillering phenotype in rice.	2014	J Genet	National Research Centre on Plant Biotechnology, LBS Centre, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa Campus, New Delhi 110 012, India. rpsnrcpb@yahoo.co.in.	Dwarf plant height and tillering ability are two of the most important agronomic traits that determine the plant architecture, and have profound influence on grain yield in rice. To understand the molecular mechanism controlling these two traits, an EMS-induced recessive dwarf and increased tillering1 (dit1) mutant was characterized. The mutant showed proportionate reduction in each internode as compared to wild type revealing that it belonged to the category of dn-type of dwarf mutants. Besides, exogenous application of GA3 and 24-epibrassinolide, did not have any effect on the phenotype of the mutant. The gene was mapped on the long arm of chromosome 4, identified through positional candidate approach and verified by cosegregation analysis. It was found to encode carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase7 (CCD7) and identified as an allele of htd1. The mutant carried substitution of two nucleotides CC to AA in the sixth exon of the gene that resulted in substitution of serine by a stop codon in the mutant, and thus formation of a truncated protein, unlike amino acid substitution event in htd1. The new allele will facilitate further functional characterization of this gene, which may lead to unfolding of newer signalling pathways involving plant development and architecture.
NA	Knocking out of carotenoid catabolic genes in rice fails to boost carotenoid accumulation, but reveals a mutation in strigolactone biosynthesis.	2017	Plant Cell Rep	Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory for Plant Epigenetics, College of Life Sciences, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, China.	Targeted mutations in five carotenoid catabolism genes failed to boost carotenoid accumulation in rice seeds, but produced dwarf and high tillering mutants when OsCCD7 gene was knocked out. Carotenoids play an important role in human diet as a source of vitamin A. Rice is a major staple food in Asia, but does not accumulate carotenoids in the endosperm because of the low carotenoid biosynthesis or the degradation in metabolism. In this study, the CRISPR/Cas9 system was investigated in the targeted knockout of five rice carotenoid catabolic genes (OsCYP97A4, OsDSM2, OsCCD4a, OsCCD4b and OsCCD7) and in an effort to increase Î²-carotene accumulation in rice endosperm. Transgenic plants that expressed OsNLSCas9 and sgRNAs were generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Various knockout mutations were identified at the T0Â generation of the transgenic rice by TILLING and direct sequencing of the PCR products amplified from the target sites. Carotenoids were not accumulated in both mono-allelic and bi-allelic knockout mutations of the five genes. However, transgenic plants with homozygous or bi-allelic mutations to the OsCCD7 gene were extremely dwarfish with more tillers and lower seed setting than other transgenic or nontransgenic plants. This phenotype was similar to the previously reported ccd7 mutants, which are defective in the biosynthesis of strigolactone, a plant hormone that regulates branching in plants and tiller formation in rice.
NA	A Strigolactone Biosynthesis Gene Contributed to the Green Revolution in Rice.	2020	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China.	Plant architecture is a complex agronomic trait and a major factor of crop yield, which is affected by several important hormones. Strigolactones (SLs) are identified as a new class hormoneinhibiting branching in many plant species and have been shown to be involved in various developmental processes. Genetical<U+00A0>and chemical<U+00A0>modulation of the SL pathway is recognized as a promising approach to modify plant architecture. However, whether and how the genes involved in the SL pathway could be utilized in breeding still remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that a partial loss-of-function allele of the SL biosynthesis gene, HIGH TILLERING AND DWARF 1/DWARF17 (HTD1/D17), which encodes CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE 7 (CCD7), increases tiller number and improves grain yield in rice. We found that the HTD1 gene had been widely utilized and co-selected with Semidwarf 1 (SD1), both contributing to the improvement of plant architecture in modern rice varieties since the Green Revolution in the 1960s. Understanding how phytohormone pathway genes regulate plant architecture and how they have been utilized and selected in breeding will lay the foundation for developing the rational approaches toward improving crop yield.
NA	Characterization of dwarf and narrow leaf ( dnl-4) mutant in rice	2020	Plant Signal Behav	College of Life Science and Natural Resources, Dong-A University , Busan, Korea.	Height and leaf morphology are important agronomic traits of the major crop plant rice (Oryza sativa). In previous studies, the dwarf and narrow leaf genes (dnl1, dnl2 and dnl3) have identified in rice. Using the Ac/Ds knockout system, we found a new dwarf and narrow leaf (dnl) mutant and identified mutated gene. The dnl-4 mutant showed reduced plant height and leaf blade width compared to the wild type, and increased leaf inclination. The morphological defects of the mutant were caused by the suppressed expression of the DNL-4 gene, which encodes a pfkB carbohydrate kinase protein. These results suggest that DNL-4 expression is involved in modulating plant height and leaf growth. Furthermore, DNL-4 expression also affects productivity in rice: the dnl-4 mutant exhibited reduced panicle length and grain width compared with the wild type. To understand DNL-4 function in rice, we analyzed the expression levels of leaf growth-related genes, such as NAL1, NAL7, and CSLD4, in the dnl-4 mutant. Expression of NAL1 and NAL7 was downregulated in the dnl-4 mutant compared to the wild type. The observation that DNL-4 expression corresponded with that of NAL1 and NAL7 is consistent with the narrow leaf phenotype of the dnl-4 mutant. These results suggest that DNL-4 regulates plant height and leaf structure in rice.
