HKT2	salt	Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa	We also isolated two cDNAs homologous to Ni-OsHKT1 from salt-tolerant indica rice, cv Pokkali (Po-OsHKT1, Po-OsHKT2)
HKT2	salt	Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa	These results suggest that two isoforms of HKT transporters, a Na+ transporter (OsHKT1) and a Na+- and K+-coupled transporter (OsHKT2), may act harmoniously in the salt tolerant indica rice
