HAN1	domestication	Natural variation in the HAN1 gene confers chilling tolerance in rice and allowed adaptation to a temperate climate.	 Natural variants in HAN1 diverged between indica and japonica rice during domestication
HAN1	tolerance	Natural variation in the HAN1 gene confers chilling tolerance in rice and allowed adaptation to a temperate climate.	Natural variation in the HAN1 gene confers chilling tolerance in rice and allowed adaptation to a temperate climate.
HAN1	tolerance	Natural variation in the HAN1 gene confers chilling tolerance in rice and allowed adaptation to a temperate climate.	 A specific allele from temperate japonica rice, which gained a putative MYB cis-element in the promoter of HAN1 during the divergence of the two japonica ecotypes, enhances the chilling tolerance of temperate japonica rice and allows it to adapt to a temperate climate
HAN1	chilling	Natural variation in the HAN1 gene confers chilling tolerance in rice and allowed adaptation to a temperate climate.	Natural variation in the HAN1 gene confers chilling tolerance in rice and allowed adaptation to a temperate climate.
HAN1	chilling	Natural variation in the HAN1 gene confers chilling tolerance in rice and allowed adaptation to a temperate climate.	 HAN1 encodes an oxidase that catalyzes the conversion of biologically active jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) to the inactive form 12-hydroxy-JA-Ile (12OH-JA-Ile) and fine-tunes the JA-mediated chilling response

A specific allele from temperate japonica rice, which gained a putative MYB cis-element in the promoter of HAN1 during the divergence of the two japonica ecotypes, enhances the chilling tolerance of temperate japonica rice and allows it to adapt to a temperate climate
