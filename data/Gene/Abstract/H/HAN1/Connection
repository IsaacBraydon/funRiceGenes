HAN1	OsANN1	Calcium binding protein OsANN1 regulates rice blast disease resistance by inactivating jasmonic acid signaling.	 By yeast two-hybrid screening, we found that OsANN1 interacted with a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, HAN1 (&quot;HAN&quot; termed &quot;chilling&quot; in Chinese), which has been reported to catalyze the conversion of biologically active jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) to the inactive form 12-hydroxy-JA-Ile (12OH-JA-Ile)
HAN1	OsANN1	Calcium binding protein OsANN1 regulates rice blast disease resistance by inactivating jasmonic acid signaling.	 Genetic evidence showed that OsANN1 acts upstream of HAN1
HAN1	OsANN1	Calcium binding protein OsANN1 regulates rice blast disease resistance by inactivating jasmonic acid signaling.	 OsANN1 stabilizes HAN1 in planta, resulting in the inactivation of the endogenous biologically active JA-Ile
