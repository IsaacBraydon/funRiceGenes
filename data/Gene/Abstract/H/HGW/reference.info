To date, molecular factors controlling both heading date and grain weight have not been identified. Here we report the isolation of a hemizygous mutation, heading and grain weight (hgw), which delays heading and reduces grain weight in rice. Analysis of hgw mutant phenotypes indicate that the hemizygous hgw mutation decreases latitudinal cell number in the lemma and palea, both composing the spikelet hull that is known to determine the size and shape of brown grain. Molecular cloning and characterization of the HGW gene showed that it encodes a novel plant-specific ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain protein localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and functions as a key upstream regulator to promote expressions of heading date-and grain weight-related genes. Moreover, co-expression analysis in rice and Arabidopsis indicated that HGW and its Arabidopsis homolog are co-expressed with genes encoding various components of ubiquitination machinery, implying a fundamental role for the ubiquitination pathway in heading date and grain weight control.
NA	The Conserved Effector UvHrip1 interacts with OsHGW, and Infection of Ustilaginoidea virens Regulates Defense- and Heading Date-Related Signaling Pathway.	2020	Int J Mol Sci.

Ustilaginoidea virens, which causes rice false smut (RFS), is one of the most detrimental rice fungal diseases and poses a severe threat to rice production and quality. Effectors in U. virens often act as a group of essential virulence factors that play crucial roles in the interaction between host and the pathogen. Thus, the functions of individual effectors in U. virens need to be further explored. Here, we demonstrated a small secreted hypersensitive response-inducing protein (hrip), named UvHrip1, which was highly conserved in U. virens isolates. UvHrip1 was also proven to suppress necrosis-like defense symptoms in N. benthamiana induced by the oomycete elicitor INF1. The localization of UvHrip1 was mainly in the nuclei and cytoplasm via monitoring the UvHrip1-GFP fusion protein in rice cells. Furthermore, Y2H and BiFC assay demonstrated that UvHrip1 interacted with OsHGW, which is a critical regulator in heading date and grain weight signaling pathways in rice. Expression patterns of defense- and heading date-related genes, OsPR1#051 and OsMYB21, were down-regulated over U. virens infection in rice. Collectively, our data provide a theory for gaining an insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the UvHrip1 virulence function.
