HGW	lemma	The Rice HGW Gene Encodes a Ubiquitin-Associated (UBA) Domain Protein That Regulates Heading Date and Grain Weight	Analysis of hgw mutant phenotypes indicate that the hemizygous hgw mutation decreases latitudinal cell number in the lemma and palea, both composing the spikelet hull that is known to determine the size and shape of brown grain
HGW	grain weight	The Rice HGW Gene Encodes a Ubiquitin-Associated (UBA) Domain Protein That Regulates Heading Date and Grain Weight	Here we report the isolation of a hemizygous mutation, heading and grain weight (hgw), which delays heading and reduces grain weight in rice
HGW	grain weight	The Rice HGW Gene Encodes a Ubiquitin-Associated (UBA) Domain Protein That Regulates Heading Date and Grain Weight	Molecular cloning and characterization of the HGW gene showed that it encodes a novel plant-specific ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain protein localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and functions as a key upstream regulator to promote expressions of heading date-and grain weight-related genes
HGW	grain weight	The Rice HGW Gene Encodes a Ubiquitin-Associated (UBA) Domain Protein That Regulates Heading Date and Grain Weight	Moreover, co-expression analysis in rice and Arabidopsis indicated that HGW and its Arabidopsis homolog are co-expressed with genes encoding various components of ubiquitination machinery, implying a fundamental role for the ubiquitination pathway in heading date and grain weight control
