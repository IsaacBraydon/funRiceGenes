HTD12	root	HIGH-TILLERING AND DWARF 12 regulates photosynthesis and plant architecture by affecting carotenoid biosynthesis in rice	 In addition, compared to the wild type, htd12 had significantly lower levels of ent-2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol (epi-5DS), a native strigolactone (SL), in both roots and root exudates, resulting in an obvious increase in tiller number and decrease in plant height
HTD12	tiller	HIGH-TILLERING AND DWARF 12 regulates photosynthesis and plant architecture by affecting carotenoid biosynthesis in rice	 In addition, compared to the wild type, htd12 had significantly lower levels of ent-2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol (epi-5DS), a native strigolactone (SL), in both roots and root exudates, resulting in an obvious increase in tiller number and decrease in plant height
HTD12	photosynthesis	HIGH-TILLERING AND DWARF 12 regulates photosynthesis and plant architecture by affecting carotenoid biosynthesis in rice	 Sequence analysis showed that a single nucleotide transition from guanine (G) to adenine (A) in the 3' acceptor site between the 1 st intron and 2 nd exon of HTD12 alters its mRNA splicing in htd12 plants, resulting in a 49-amino acid deletion that affects carotenoid biosynthesis and photosynthesis in this mutant
HTD12	dwarf	HIGH-TILLERING AND DWARF 12 regulates photosynthesis and plant architecture by affecting carotenoid biosynthesis in rice	 Here, we identified the high-tillering and dwarf 12 (htd12) mutant and analyzed the effects of the HTD12 mutation on these important factors
HTD12	height	HIGH-TILLERING AND DWARF 12 regulates photosynthesis and plant architecture by affecting carotenoid biosynthesis in rice	 In addition, compared to the wild type, htd12 had significantly lower levels of ent-2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol (epi-5DS), a native strigolactone (SL), in both roots and root exudates, resulting in an obvious increase in tiller number and decrease in plant height
HTD12	plant height	HIGH-TILLERING AND DWARF 12 regulates photosynthesis and plant architecture by affecting carotenoid biosynthesis in rice	 In addition, compared to the wild type, htd12 had significantly lower levels of ent-2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol (epi-5DS), a native strigolactone (SL), in both roots and root exudates, resulting in an obvious increase in tiller number and decrease in plant height
HTD12	strigolactone	HIGH-TILLERING AND DWARF 12 regulates photosynthesis and plant architecture by affecting carotenoid biosynthesis in rice	 In addition, compared to the wild type, htd12 had significantly lower levels of ent-2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol (epi-5DS), a native strigolactone (SL), in both roots and root exudates, resulting in an obvious increase in tiller number and decrease in plant height
HTD12	tiller number	HIGH-TILLERING AND DWARF 12 regulates photosynthesis and plant architecture by affecting carotenoid biosynthesis in rice	 In addition, compared to the wild type, htd12 had significantly lower levels of ent-2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol (epi-5DS), a native strigolactone (SL), in both roots and root exudates, resulting in an obvious increase in tiller number and decrease in plant height
