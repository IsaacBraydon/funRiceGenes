HMGB1|OsHMGB1	 We determined that OsHMGB1 expression is induced by Pi starvation and encodes a nucleus-localized protein |  Phenotypic analysis of Oshmgb1 mutant and OsHMGB1 overexpression transgenic plants showed that OsHMGB1 positively regulates Pi homeostasis and plant growth |  Transcriptome deep sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing indicated that OsHMGB1 regulates the expression of a series of phosphate starvation-responsive (PSR) genes by binding to their promoters |  Indeed, OsHMGB1 occupancy positively correlated with genome-wide chromatin accessibility and gene expression levels |  Our results demonstrate that OsHMGB1 is a transcriptional facilitator that regulates the expression of a set of PSR genes to maintain Pi homeostasis in rice by increasing the chromatin accessibility, revealing a key epigenetic mechanism that fine-tune plant acclimation responses to Pi-limited environments	 Phenotypic analysis of Oshmgb1 mutant and OsHMGB1 overexpression transgenic plants showed that OsHMGB1 positively regulates Pi homeostasis and plant growth
