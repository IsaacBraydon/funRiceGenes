We analyzed the DNA-binding and DNA-bending properties of recombinant HMGB1 proteins based on a rice HMGB1 cDNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that rice HMGB1 can bind synthetic four-way junction (4H) DNA and DNA minicircles efficiently but the binding to 4H can be completed out by HMGA and histone H1. Conformational changes were detected by circular dichroism analysis with 4H DNA bound to various concentrations of HMGB1 or its truncated forms. T4 ligase-mediated circularization assays with short DNA fragments of 123 bp showed that the protein is capable of increasing DNA flexibility. The 123-bp DNA formed closed circular monomers efficiently in its presence, similar to that in an earlier study on maize HMG. Additionally, our results show for the first time that the basic N-terminal domain enhances the affinity of the plant HMGB1 protein for 4H DNA, while the acidic C-terminal domain has the converse effects.

We isolated a 918 bp long full-length rice HMGB1 cDNA, which has an open reading frame of 471 bp encoding 157 amino acids, with a central domain of high sequence similarity to the HMG-box domain of other plant HMGB1 proteins. RNA gel blot analysis indicated that rice HMGB1 gene is constitutively expressed in various tissues and organs. Southern hybridization and sequence analyses suggested that a single copy of the HMGB1 gene composed of seven exons and six introns exists in rice. We have also cloned a 1755 bp long 5' flanking region of the rice HMGB1 gene, which can be regarded as its promoter. 5' deletion analysis of this promoter indicated that positive cis-elements residing between -1400 and -1115 are important to enhance quantitative expression, whereas negative cis-elements between -1755 and -1400 and between -1115 and -351 inhibit expression.
