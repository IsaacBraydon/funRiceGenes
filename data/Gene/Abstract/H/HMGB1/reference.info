We analyzed the DNA-binding and DNA-bending properties of recombinant HMGB1 proteins based on a rice HMGB1 cDNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that rice HMGB1 can bind synthetic four-way junction (4H) DNA and DNA minicircles efficiently but the binding to 4H can be completed out by HMGA and histone H1. Conformational changes were detected by circular dichroism analysis with 4H DNA bound to various concentrations of HMGB1 or its truncated forms. T4 ligase-mediated circularization assays with short DNA fragments of 123 bp showed that the protein is capable of increasing DNA flexibility. The 123-bp DNA formed closed circular monomers efficiently in its presence, similar to that in an earlier study on maize HMG. Additionally, our results show for the first time that the basic N-terminal domain enhances the affinity of the plant HMGB1 protein for 4H DNA, while the acidic C-terminal domain has the converse effects.
1-s2.0-S037811190300605X-main.pdf	Cloning and characterization of rice HMGB1 gene	2003	Gene	Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, 10 Science Drive 4, Singapore 117543, Singapore.	We isolated a 918 bp long full-length rice HMGB1 cDNA, which has an open reading frame of 471 bp encoding 157 amino acids, with a central domain of high sequence similarity to the HMG-box domain of other plant HMGB1 proteins. RNA gel blot analysis indicated that rice HMGB1 gene is constitutively expressed in various tissues and organs. Southern hybridization and sequence analyses suggested that a single copy of the HMGB1 gene composed of seven exons and six introns exists in rice. We have also cloned a 1755 bp long 5' flanking region of the rice HMGB1 gene, which can be regarded as its promoter. 5' deletion analysis of this promoter indicated that positive cis-elements residing between -1400 and -1115 are important to enhance quantitative expression, whereas negative cis-elements between -1755 and -1400 and between -1115 and -351 inhibit expression.
NA	Rice chromatin protein OsHMGB1 is involved in phosphate homeostasis and plant growth by affecting chromatin accessibility.	2023	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Although phosphorus is one of the most important essential elements for plant growth and development, the epigenetic regulation of inorganic phosphate (Pi) signaling is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the biological function and mode of action of the high-mobility-group box 1 protein OsHMGB1 in rice (Oryza sativa), using molecular and genetic approaches. We determined that OsHMGB1 expression is induced by Pi starvation and encodes a nucleus-localized protein. Phenotypic analysis of Oshmgb1 mutant and OsHMGB1 overexpression transgenic plants showed that OsHMGB1 positively regulates Pi homeostasis and plant growth. Transcriptome deep sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing indicated that OsHMGB1 regulates the expression of a series of phosphate starvation-responsive (PSR) genes by binding to their promoters. Furthermore, an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin followed by sequencing revealed that OsHMGB1 is involved in maintaining chromatin accessibility. Indeed, OsHMGB1 occupancy positively correlated with genome-wide chromatin accessibility and gene expression levels. Our results demonstrate that OsHMGB1 is a transcriptional facilitator that regulates the expression of a set of PSR genes to maintain Pi homeostasis in rice by increasing the chromatin accessibility, revealing a key epigenetic mechanism that fine-tune plant acclimation responses to Pi-limited environments.
