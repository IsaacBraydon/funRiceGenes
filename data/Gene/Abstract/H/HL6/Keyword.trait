HL6|OsGL6	domestication	Hairy Leaf 6, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, interacts with OsWOX3B and regulates trichome formation in rice.	 Population genetic analysis indicated that HL6 was under negative selection during rice domestication
HL6|OsGL6	Kinase	OsGL6, a conserved AP2 domain protein, promotes leaf trichome initiation in rice.	 We found that OsGL6 interacted with serine/threonine protein kinase OSK3 (OSK3) or COP9 signalosome complex subunit 5a (CSN5) in yeast
