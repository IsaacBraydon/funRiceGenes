Trichome formation has been extensively studied as a mechanistic model for epidermal cell differentiation and cell morphogenesis in plants. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying trichome formation (i.e. initiation and elongation) in rice remain largely unknown. Here, we report an AP2/ERF transcription factor, Hairy Leaf 6 (HL6), which controls trichome formation in rice. Functional characterization of HL6 revealed that HL6 transcriptionally regulates trichome elongation in rice. Furthermore, the regulation of HL6 in trichome elongation is dependent on functional OsWOX3B, which encodes a homeodomain-containing protein that acts as a key regulator in trichome initiation. Using yeast two-hybrid assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation tests, we determined that HL6 interacts with OsWOX3B to regulate trichome formation and form a protein complex, enhancing the binding ability of HL6 with the auxin-related gene OsYUCCA5. Population genetic analysis indicated that HL6 was under negative selection during rice domestication. Our findings provide new insights in the molecular network of HL6 and OsWOX3B involved in the auxin-mediated pathway that regulates trichome formation in rice.
