NA	Hairy Leaf 6, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, interacts with OsWOX3B and regulates trichome formation in rice.	2017	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Wuhan 430070, China; College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Trichome formation has been extensively studied as a mechanistic model for epidermal cell differentiation and cell morphogenesis in plants. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying trichome formation (i.e. initiation and elongation) in rice remain largely unknown. Here, we report an AP2/ERF transcription factor, Hairy Leaf 6 (HL6), which controls trichome formation in rice. Functional characterization of HL6 revealed that HL6 transcriptionally regulates trichome elongation in rice. Furthermore, the regulation of HL6 in trichome elongation is dependent on functional OsWOX3B, which encodes a homeodomain-containing protein that acts as a key regulator in trichome initiation. Using yeast two-hybrid assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation tests, we determined that HL6 interacts with OsWOX3B to regulate trichome formation and form a protein complex, enhancing the binding ability of HL6 with the auxin-related gene OsYUCCA5. Population genetic analysis indicated that HL6 was under negative selection during rice domestication. Our findings provide new insights in the molecular network of HL6 and OsWOX3B involved in the auxin-mediated pathway that regulates trichome formation in rice.
NA	OsGL6, a conserved AP2 domain protein, promotes leaf trichome initiation in rice.	2019	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	College of Plant Protection, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, Fujian, 350002, China; Rice Research Institute, Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Fuzhou, 350019, China; State Key Laboratory of Ecological Pest Control for Fujian and Taiwan' Crops/Key Laboratory of Germplasm Innovation and Molecular Breeding of Hybrid Rice in South China/Fujian Engineering Laboratory of Crop Molecular Breeding/Fujian Key Laboratory of Rice Molecular Breeding/Fuzhou Branch, National Center of Rice Improvement of China/National Engineering Laboratory of Rice/South Base of National Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice of China, Fuzhou, 350003, China.	Trichomes are specialized epidermal cells that play crucial roles in resisting environmental stress and enhancing plant development. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the main genes controlling trichome formation have been consecutively identified. However, few genes like this were reported in rice. In this study, we identified the hairy phenotype of indica variety 75-1-127. This was used to construct a segregation population with a cross of hairless variety Minghui63 (MH63) to fine map the trichome formation genes. Genetic analysis indicated that hairy phenotype was controlled by a pair of dominant genes on chromosome 6, which was designated as GLABRA6 (OsGL6). OsGL6 was an allele of HL6 gene whose sequences containing rich variations in genomes. Compared to wild type, the overexpressing transgenic lines revealed that OsGL6 promoted trichome initiation. We found that OsGL6 interacted with serine/threonine protein kinase OSK3 (OSK3) or COP9 signalosome complex subunit 5a (CSN5) in yeast. These results provide potential information for understanding the molecular mechanism of trichome formation in rice.
