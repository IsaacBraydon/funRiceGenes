HYR	photosynthesis	Coordinated regulation of photosynthesis in rice increases yield and tolerance to environmental stress.	Coordinated regulation of photosynthesis in rice increases yield and tolerance to environmental stress.
HYR	yield	Coordinated regulation of photosynthesis in rice increases yield and tolerance to environmental stress.	Coordinated regulation of photosynthesis in rice increases yield and tolerance to environmental stress.
HYR	tolerance	Coordinated regulation of photosynthesis in rice increases yield and tolerance to environmental stress.	Coordinated regulation of photosynthesis in rice increases yield and tolerance to environmental stress.
HYR	stress tolerance	Coordinated regulation of photosynthesis in rice increases yield and tolerance to environmental stress.	Coordinated regulation of photosynthesis in rice increases yield and tolerance to environmental stress.
HYR	HIGHER YIELD RICE	Coordinated regulation of photosynthesis in rice increases yield and tolerance to environmental stress.	To study the regulation of photosynthesis, we developed a rice gene regulatory network and identified a transcription factor HYR (HIGHER YIELD RICE) associated with PCM, which on expression in rice enhances photosynthesis under multiple environmental conditions, determining a morpho-physiological programme leading to higher grain yield under normal, drought and high-temperature stress conditions.
