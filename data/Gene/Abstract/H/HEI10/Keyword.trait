HEI10	meiotic	The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers	 Mice HEI10(mei4) mutant displays no obvious defect other than meiotic failure from an absence of chiasmata| In this study, we characterize rice HEI10 by map-based cloning and explore its function during meiotic recombination| HEI10 protein displays a highly dynamic localization on the meiotic chromosomes| Together our results suggest that HEI10 is the homolog of budding yeast Zip3 and Caenorhabditis elegans ZHP-3, and may specifically promote class I CO formation through modification of various meiotic components|The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers
HEI10	meiotic	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	 OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10
HEI10	cell cycle	The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers	HEI10 was first described in human as a RING domain-containing protein that regulates cell cycle and cell invasion
