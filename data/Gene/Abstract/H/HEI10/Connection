HEI10	OsMSH5	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10
HEI10	OsMSH5	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	Furthermore, the residual chiasmata were shown to be the least frequent among the zmm mutants, including Osmer3, Oszip4, hei10, and Osmsh5
HEI10	OsMSH5	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	Taken together, we propose that OsMSH5 functions upstream of OsZIP4, OsMER3, and HEI10 in class I crossover formation
HEI10	MER3|RCK	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10

HEI10	ZYGO1	The F-box protein ZYGO1 mediates bouquet formation to promote homologous pairing, synapsis, and recombination in rice meiosis.	 Furthermore, crossover (CO) formation was disturbed, and foci of Human enhancer of invasion 10 (HEI10) were restricted to the partially-synapsed chromosome regions, indicating that CO reduction might be caused by the failure of full-length chromosome alignment in zygo1
HEI10	HEIP1|OsAGG1	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	 Here, through screening for HEI10-interacting proteins via a yeast two-hybrid system, we identify a CO protein HEI10 Interaction Protein 1 (HEIP1) in rice
HEI10	HEIP1|OsAGG1	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	 HEIP1 colocalizes with HEI10 in a dynamic fashion along the meiotic chromosomes and specially localizes onto crossover sites from late pachytene to diplotene
HEI10	HEIP1|OsAGG1	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	 Between these two proteins, HEI10 is required for the loading of HEIP1, but not vice versa
HEI10	OsATM	OsATM safeguards accurate repair of meiotic double-strand breaks in rice.	 Moreover, the removal of OsDMC1 from chromosomes in Osatm PMCs was delayed and the number of HEI10 foci (markers of interference-sensitive CO intermediates) decreased
HEI10	OsCLR1|DSNP1	The E3 ubiquitin ligase DESYNAPSIS1 regulates synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis.	 Accompanying the decreased foci of HEI10, ZIP4, and MER3 on meiotic chromosomes, the number of crossovers (COs) decreases dramatically in dsnp1 meiocytes
HEI10	HEIP1|OsAGG1	HEIP1 is required for efficient meiotic crossover implementation and is conserved from plants to humans.	 The HEI10 Interacting Protein 1 (HEIP1) was identified in rice and proposed to be a new, plant-specific member of the ZMM group
