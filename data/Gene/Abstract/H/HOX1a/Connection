CKI|EL1|Hd16	HAZ1|HOX1a	Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing EL1	 In addition, HOX1a suppresses the transcription of early flowering1 (EL1), a negative regulator of GA signaling, and further electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that HOX1a directly bound to the promoter region of EL1 to suppress its expression and stimulate GA signaling| These results demonstrate that HOX1a functions as a positive regulator of GA signaling by suppressing EL1, providing informative hints on the study of GA signaling|Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing EL1
