HAZ1|HOX1a	flower	Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing EL1	In addition, HOX1a suppresses the transcription of early flowering1 (EL1), a negative regulator of GA signaling, and further electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that HOX1a directly bound to the promoter region of EL1 to suppress its expression and stimulate GA signaling
HAZ1|HOX1a	gibberellin	Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing EL1	We here show that overexpression of rice homeobox gene HOX1a resulted in enhanced gibberellin (GA) response, indicating a positive effect of HOX1a in GA signaling
HAZ1|HOX1a	gibberellin	Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing EL1	Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing EL1
HAZ1|HOX1a	transcription factor	Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing EL1	HOX1a is induced by GA and encodes a homeobox transcription factor with transcription repression activity
HAZ1|HOX1a	transcription factor	Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing EL1	Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing EL1
HAZ1|HOX1a	 ga 	Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing EL1	We here show that overexpression of rice homeobox gene HOX1a resulted in enhanced gibberellin (GA) response, indicating a positive effect of HOX1a in GA signaling
