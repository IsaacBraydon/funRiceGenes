Homeobox genes that encode transcription factors play important roles in development and differentiation of both plant and animal systems. From a cDNA library of 3-day after-pollination (DAP) rice embryos we cloned a HAZ1 cDNA that encodes a protein with a PHD-finger domain and a homeodomain. A database search showed that HAZ1 was most similar in its entire amino acid sequence to Zmhox1a (52% identity) and Zmhox1b (50%), PHD-finger family homeodomain proteins of maize. Differing from Zmhox1, overexpression of HAZ1 brought no morphological change either in tobacco or in rice. In situ hybridization showed that HAZ1 was expressed at a higher level in the outer layers of a developing embryo than in the inner parts of the embryo at 3 DAP. At 4 and 5 DAPs, the expression of HAZ1 was concentrated at the ventral part of an embryo. These results indicate that HAZ1 marks outer layer cells of a globular embryo before any morphological differentiation is discerned in it. Radial axis differentiation marked by HAZ1 is then collapsed dynamically along with embryo morphogenesis, and HAZ1 later marks the ventral surface of the embryo.

Homeobox transcription factors are involved in various aspects of plant development, including maintenance of the biosynthesis and signaling pathways of different hormones. However, few direct targets of homeobox proteins have been identified. We here show that overexpression of rice homeobox gene HOX1a resulted in enhanced gibberellin (GA) response, indicating a positive effect of HOX1a in GA signaling. HOX1a is induced by GA and encodes a homeobox transcription factor with transcription repression activity. In addition, HOX1a suppresses the transcription of early flowering1 (EL1), a negative regulator of GA signaling, and further electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that HOX1a directly bound to the promoter region of EL1 to suppress its expression and stimulate GA signaling. These results demonstrate that HOX1a functions as a positive regulator of GA signaling by suppressing EL1, providing informative hints on the study of GA signaling.
