A late heading-time mutant line, HS276, which was induced by gamma-irradiation of seeds of the japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) variety Gimbozu, exhibits an extremely long basic vegetative growth phase (BVP). A genetic analysis using the F(2) population from the cross between HS276 and Gimbozu revealed that the late heading of HS276 is governed by a single recessive mutant gene. The subsequent analysis on heading responses of HS276 and Gimbozu to four photoperiods (12, 13, 14, and 15 h) and to the photoperiodic transfer treatment from a short photoperiod to a long photoperiod revealed that the mutant gene confers an extremely long BVP and increases photoperiod sensitivity under long photoperiod (14 and 15 h). The BVP durations of HS276 and Gimbozu were estimated at 30.1 and 16.0 days, respectively; the mutant gene, compared with its wild type allele, elongates the duration of BVP by 14 days. Linkage analysis showed that the mutant gene is located in the 129 kb region between the two INDEL markers, INDELAP0399_6 and INDELAP3487_2, on the distal part of the short arm of chromosome 6. None of the other BVP genes are located in this region; therefore, we declared this a newly detected mutant gene and designated it ef7. A recently established program to breed rice suitable for low latitudes, where short photoperiodic conditions continue throughout the year, aims to develop varieties with extremely long BVPs and weak photoperiod sensitivities; the mutant gene ef7, therefore, will be quite useful in these programs because it confers an extremely long BVP and little enhances photoperiod sensitivity under short photoperiod.
journal.pone.0043705.pdf	OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering	2012	PLoS One	Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.	Arabidopsis thaliana early flowering 3 (ELF3) as a zeitnehmer (time taker) is responsible for generation of circadian rhythm and regulation of photoperiodic flowering. There are two orthologs (OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2) of ELF3 in rice (Oryza sativa), but their roles have not yet been fully identified. Here, we performed a functional characterization of OsELF3-1 and revealed it plays a more predominant role than OsELF3-2 in rice heading. Our results suggest OsELF3-1 can affect rice circadian systems via positive regulation of OsLHY expression and negative regulation of OsPRR1, OsPRR37, OsPRR73 and OsPRR95 expression. In addition, OsELF3-1 is involved in blue light signaling by activating early heading date 1 (Ehd1) expression to promote rice flowering under short-day (SD) conditions. Moreover, OsELF3-1 suppresses a flowering repressor grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7) to indirectly accelerate flowering under long-day (LD) conditions. Taken together, our results indicate OsELF3-1 is essential for circadian regulation and photoperiodic flowering in rice.
Mol. Plant-2013-Yang-202-15.pdf	OsELF3 is involved in circadian clock regulation for promoting flowering under long-day conditions in rice	2013	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research-Wuhan, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Heading date is a critical trait that determines cropping seasons and regional adaptability in rice (Oryza sativa). Research efforts during the last decade have identified some important photoperiod pathway genes that are conserved between Arabidopsis and rice. In this study, we identified a novel gene, Oryza sativa ELF3 (OsELF3), which is a putative homolog of the ELF3 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. OsELF3 was required for the control of heading date under long-day conditions. Its Tos17-tagging mutants exhibited a delayed heading date phenotype only under long-day, but not short-day, conditions. OsELF3 was highly expressed in leaf blades, and the OsELF3 protein was localized in the nucleolus. An obvious diurnal rhythm of OsELF3 transcript level was observed, with a trough in the early day and a peak in the late night in wild-type plants. However, this expression pattern was disrupted in oself3 mutants. Further investigations showed that the expression of OsGI and Ghd7 was up-regulated in the oself3 mutant, indicating that OsELF3 acts as a negative regulator upstream of OsGI and Ghd7 in the flowering-time control under long-day conditions. The rhythmic expression of circadian clock-related genes, including some OsPRR members, was obviously affected in oself3 mutants. Our results indicated that OsELF3 acts as a floral activator in the long-day photoperiodic pathway via its crosstalk with the circadian clock in rice.
Plant Cell Physiol-2012-Matsubara-709-16.pdf	Natural variation in Hd17, a homolog of Arabidopsis ELF3 that is involved in rice photoperiodic flowering	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	Flowering time of rice depends strongly on photoperiodic responses. We previously identified a quantitative trait locus, Heading date 17 (Hd17), that is associated with a difference in flowering time between Japanese rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars. Here, we show that the difference may result from a single nucleotide polymorphism within a putative gene that encodes a homolog of the Arabidopsis EARLY FLOWERING 3 protein, which plays important roles in maintaining circadian rhythms. Our results demonstrate that natural variation in Hd17 may change the transcription level of a flowering repressor, Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7), suggesting that Hd17 is part of rice's photoperiodic flowering pathway.
Plant Cell Physiol-2012-Saito-717-28.pdf	Ef7 encodes an ELF3-like protein and promotes rice flowering by negatively regulating the floral repressor gene Ghd7 under both short- and long-day conditions	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.	Much progress has been made in our understanding of photoperiodic flowering of rice and the mechanisms underlying short-day (SD) promotion and long-day (LD) repression of floral induction. In this study, we identified and characterized the Ef7 gene, one of the rice orthologs of Arabidopsis EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3). The ef7 mutant HS276, which was induced by gamma-irradiation of the japonica rice cultivar 'Gimbozu', flowers late under both SD and LD conditions. Expression analyses of flowering time-related genes demonstrated that Ef7 negatively regulates the expression of Ghd7, which is a repressor of the photoperiodic control of rice flowering, and consequently up-regulates the expression of the downstream Ehd1 and FT-like genes under both SD and LD conditions. Genetic analyses with a non-functional Ghd7 allele provided further evidence that the delayed flowering of ef7 is mediated through the Ghd7 pathway. The analysis of light-induced expression of Ghd7 revealed that the ef7 mutant was more sensitive to red light than the wild-type plant, but the gate of Ghd7 expression was unchanged. Thus, our results show that Ef7 functions as a floral promoter by repressing Ghd7 expression under both SD and LD conditions.
NA	Mutation of Rice Early Flowering3.1 (OsELF3.1) delays leaf senescence in rice.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Department of Plant Science, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, 151-921, Republic of Korea.	In Arabidopsis, EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3) has pivotal roles in controlling circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering. In addition, ELF3 negatively regulates leaf senescence by repressing the transcription of PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) and PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR5 (PIF5); elf3 mutants senesce earlier and ELF3-overexpressing (ELF3-OX) plants senesce later than wild type (WT). Here, we show that in contrast to Arabidopsis ELF3, which represses senescence, the rice homolog OsELF3.1 promotes leaf senescence; oself3.1 mutants showed delayed senescence and OsELF3.1-OX plants senesced earlier under both dark-induced and natural senescence conditions. Microarray analysis revealed that in the senescing leaves, a number of senescence-associated genes, phytohormone-related genes, and NAC and WRKY family genes (OsNAP, ONAC106, and OsWRKY42) were differentially expressed in oself3.1 mutants compared with WT. Interestingly, we found that Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsELF3.1 show delayed leaf senescence, produce short petioles, and flower late in long days, just like Arabidopsis ELF3-OX plants. This demonstrates that the regulatory functions of ELF3 and OsELF3.1 are conserved between Arabidopsis and rice, but the downstream regulatory cascades have opposite effects.
NA	HAF1 Modulates Circadian Accumulation of OsELF3 Controlling Heading Date Under Long-day Conditions in Rice.	2018	Plant Cell	Huazhong Agricultural University CITY: Wuhan China [CN].	The ubiquitin 26S proteasome system (UPS) is critical for enabling plants to alter their proteomes to integrate internal and external signals for the photoperiodic induction of flowering. We previously demonstrated that HAF1, a C3HC4 RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, is essential to precisely modulate the timing of Heading Date1 accumulation and to ensure appropriate photoperiodic responses under short-day conditions in rice (Oryza sativa). However, how HAF1 mediates flowering under long-day conditions remains unknown. In this study, we show that OsELF3 (EARLY FLOWERING3) is the direct substrate of HAF1 for ubiquitination in vitro and in vivo. HAF1 is required for maintaining the circadian rhythm of OsELF3 accumulation during photoperiodic responses in rice. In addition, the haf1 oself3 double mutant headed as late as oself3 plants under long-day conditions. An amino acid variation (L558S) within the interaction domain of OsELF3 with HAF1 greatly contributes to the variation in heading date among japonica rice accessions. Japonica accessions carrying the OsELF3(L) type allele are found at higher latitudes, while varieties carrying the OsELF3(S) type allele are found at lower latitudes. Taken together, our findings suggest that HAF1 precisely modulates the diurnal rhythm of OsELF3 accumulation to ensure the appropriate heading date in rice.
NA	Genetic relationship between phytochromes and OsELF3-1 reveals the mode of regulation for the suppression of phytochrome signaling in rice.	2018	Plant Cell Physiol	National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, Institute of Crop Science, NARO (NICS), Kannondai 2-1-2, 305-8518 Tsukuba, JAPAN.	EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3) functions as a nighttime repressor required for sustaining circadian rhythms and coordinating growth and development in various plant species. The rice genome carries two ELF3 homologs, namely OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2. Previous studies have suggested that OsELF3-1 has a predominant role in controlling rice photoperiodic flowering, while also contributing to the transcriptional regulation of rice floral regulators expressed in the morning. However, OsELF3-1 has not been functionally characterized. Here, we observed that the oself3-1 mutation suppresses the photoperiod-insensitive early flowering of photoperiod sensitivity5 (se5), which is a chromophore-deficient rice mutant. Detailed analyses of the se5oself3-1 double mutant revealed the recovery of the phytochrome-dependent expression of Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7), a floral repressor, and Light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein (Lhcb) genes. Although the oself3-1 mutation recovered Ghd7 expression in the se5 background, there was a lack of Ghd7 expression in the phyAphyBphyC triple mutant background. These observations suggest OsELF3-1 represses Ghd7 expression by inhibiting the phytochrome signaling pathway. Comparative genome analyses indicated that OsELF3-1 was produced via gene duplication events in Oryza species, and that it is expressed throughout the day. A comparison between the oself3-1 mutant and transgenic rice lines in which OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2 are simultaneously silenced uncovered a role for OsELF3-1 in addition to the canonical ELF3 function as an evolutionarily conserved role for a nighttime repressor that regulates the rice circadian clock. Our study confirmed that an ELF3 paralog, OsELF3-1, had a unique role involving the suppression of phytochrome signaling.
NA	Clock component OsPRR73 positively regulates rice salt tolerance by modulating OsHKT2;1-mediated sodium homeostasis	2020	EMBO J	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	The roles of clock components in salt stress tolerance remain incompletely characterized in rice. Here, we show that, among OsPRR (Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator) family members, OsPRR73 specifically confers salt tolerance in rice. Notably, the grain size and yield of osprr73 null mutants were significantly decreased in the presence of salt stress, with accumulated higher level of reactive oxygen species and sodium ions. RNA sequencing and biochemical assays identified OsHKT2;1, encoding a plasma membrane-localized Na+ transporter, as a transcriptional target of OsPRR73 in mediating salt tolerance. Correspondingly, null mutants of OsHKT2;1 displayed an increased tolerance to salt stress. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays further identified HDAC10 as nuclear interactor of OsPRR73 and co-repressor of OsHKT2;1. Consistently, H3K9ac histone marks at OsHKT2;1 promoter regions were significantly reduced in osprr73 mutant. Together, our findings reveal that salt-induced OsPRR73 expression confers salt tolerance by recruiting HDAC10 to transcriptionally repress OsHKT2;1, thus reducing cellular Na+ accumulation. This exemplifies a new molecular link between clock components and salt stress tolerance in rice.
NA	Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant. In addition to serving as a model plant for molecular genetic studies of monocots, rice is a staple crop for about half of the world population. Heading date is a critical agronomic trait, and many genes controlling heading date have been cloned during the last two decades. The mechanism of flowering in rice from recognition of day length by leaves to floral activation in the shoot apical meristem has been extensively studied. In this review, we summarize current progress on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice with emphasis on post-translational modifications of key regulators, including Heading Date 1 (Hd1), Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Grain Number, Plant Height, and Heading Date7 (Ghd7). The contribution of heading date genes to heterosis and the expansion of rice cultivation areas from low-latitude to high-latitude regions are also discussed. To overcome limitations of diverse genetic backgrounds used in heading date studies and to gain a clearer understanding of flowering in rice, we propose a systematic collection of genetic resources in a common genetic background. Strategies in breeding adapted cultivars by rational design are also discussed.
NA	The transcriptional repressor OsPRR73 links circadian clock and photoperiod pathway to control heading date in rice	2020	Plant Cell Environ	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	The phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is triggered by internal and external signals that participate in circadian clock in plants. We identified a rice floral inhibitor OsPRR73 encoding a CONSTANS protein. Overexpression of OsPRR73 resulted in late heading under both long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) conditions. Knockout mutants led to early heading under LD conditions but no change under SD. OsPRR73 mRNA accumulated at noon and exhibited a robust oscillation under constant light (LL) and constant darkness (DD) conditions. OsPRR73 overexpression exerted negative feedback on endogenous OsPRR73 expression and altered diurnal expressions of key flowering genes and circadian clock genes. OsPRR73 bound to the promoters of the floral gene Ehd1 and the circadian gene OsLHY, and significantly suppressed their expression at dawn. In LL and DD, the oscillatory patterns of the circadian genes OsLHY, OsTOC1, OsGI and OsELF3 were varied in OsPRR73OX and osprr73 mutants. OsPRR73 expression was decreased in osphyb mutants, and overexpression of OsPRR73 complemented the early heading date phenotype of osphyb, indicating OsPRR73 works downstream of OsPhyB. Therefore, OsPRR73 is involved in a feedback loop of the rice clock and connects the photoperiod flowering pathway by binding to the Ehd1 promoter in rice.
NA	A clock regulatory module is required for salt tolerance and control of heading date in rice	2021	Plant Cell Environ	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	The circadian clock plays multiple roles in plant stress responses and developmental transition phases. Nevertheless, the underlying molecular mechanisms and individual clock components that coordinately regulate important agronomic traits of rice such as salt tolerance and heading date remain to be elucidated. Here, we identify a rice ternary repressive protein complex composed of OsELF4a, OsELF3-1 and OsLUX, which was designated as OsEC1 in analogy to a similar complex in Arabidopsis. OsELF4a physically interacts with OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2 in nucleus, whilst OsELF3-1 rather than OsELF3-2 strongly interacts with OsLUX, a Myb-domain containing transcriptional factor. Phenotypic analyses show a role for this complex in heading and salt tolerance. The loss-of-function mutants of OsEC1 exhibit lower survival rate under salt stress and late heading date. Transcriptomic profiling together with biochemical assays identified the GIGANTEA homologue OsGI as a direct transcriptional target of OsEC1. Notably, the osgi-101 mutant, generated by CRISPR/Cas9, is salt tolerant and exhibits early heading date in long day conditions. Together, our findings characterized a transcriptional module in rice composed by the OsEC1 repressing OsGI, which links the circadian clock with salt tolerance and control of heading date.
NA	mediated pathways in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2021	Plant Sci	Institute of Crop Science, Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Crop Germplasm, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China; Shandong (Linyi) Institute of Modern Agriculture, Zhejiang University, Shandong, 276034, China.	Flowering time (or heading date in crops) is a critical agronomic trait for rice reproduction and adaptation. The circadian clock is an endogenous oscillator that is involved in controlling photoperiodic flowering. The rice LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (OsLHY), the core oscillator component of circadian clock, is a homolog of the LHY/CCA1 in Arabidopsis. Here we showed that CRISPR/Cas9-engineered mutations in OsLHY caused late flowering in rice only under natural long-day (nLD) and short-day (nSD) conditions, but not artificial SD (10 h light/14 h dark) conditions. In the oslhy mutant, the diurnal expression of circadian clock-related genes was seriously affected under both LD and SD conditions. Furthermore, the expression of the flowering activators Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 was down-regulated and flowering repressors Hd1 and Ghd7 was up-regulated in the oslhy mutant under LD conditions. While the transcripts of flowering-related genes were not dramatically influenced under SD conditions. Dual-luciferase assays showed that OsLHY repressed the transcription of OsGI, Hd1, Ghd7, Hd3a, RFT1 and OsELF3, and activated the transcription of Ehd1. Moreover, the yeast one hybrid assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed that OsLHY directly repressed OsGI, RFT1 and OsELF3 by binding to their promoters, which is consistent with that in Arabidopsis. These results suggested that the OsLHY can promote rice flowering mainly through regulating Hd1 and Ehd1.
NA	The clock component OsLUX regulates rice heading through recruiting OsELF3-1 and OsELF4s to repress Hd1 and Ghd7.	2022	J Adv Res	China National Center for Rice Improvement and State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China; Rice Research Institute, Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.	INTRODUCTION: Circadian clocks coordinate internal physiology and external environmental factors to regulate cereals flowering, which is critical for reproductive growth and optimal yield determination. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to confirm the role of OsLUX in flowering time regulation in rice. Further research illustrates how the OsELF4s-OsELF3-1-OsLUX complex directly regulates flowering-related genes to mediate rice heading. METHODS: We identified a circadian gene OsLUX by the MutMap method. The transcription levels of flowering-related genes were evaluated in WT and oslux mutants. OsLUX forms OsEC (OsELF4s-OsELF3-1-OsLUX) complex were supported by yeast two-hybrid, pull down, BiFC, and luciferase complementation assays (LCA). The EMSA, Chip-qPCR, luciferase luminescence images, and relative LUC activity assays were performed to examine the targeted regulation of flowering genes by the OsEC (OsELF4s-OsELF3-1-OsLUX) complex. RESULTS: The circadian gene OsLUX encodes an MYB family transcription factor that functions as a vital circadian clock regulator and controls rice heading. Defect in OsLUX causes an extremely late heading phenotype under natural long-day and short-day conditions, and the function was further confirmed through genetic complementation, overexpression, and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout. OsLUX forms the OsEC (OsELF4s-OsELF3-1-OsLUX) complex by recruiting OsELF3-1 and OsELF4s, which were required to regulate rice heading. OsELF3-1 contributes to the translocation of OsLUX to the nucleus, and a compromised flowering phenotype results upon mutation of any component of the OsEC complex. The OsEC complex directly represses Hd1 and Ghd7 expression via binding to their promoter&#x27;s LBS (LUX binding site) element. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that the circadian gene OsLUX regulates rice heading by directly regulating rhythm oscillation and core flowering-time-related genes. We uncovered a mechanism by which the OsEC target suppresses the expression of Hd1 and Ghd7 directly to modulate photoperiodic flowering in rice. The OsEC (OsELF4s-OsELF3-1-OsLUX)-Hd1/Ghd7 regulatory module provides the genetic targets for crop improvement.
