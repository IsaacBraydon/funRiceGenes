A late heading-time mutant line, HS276, which was induced by gamma-irradiation of seeds of the japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) variety Gimbozu, exhibits an extremely long basic vegetative growth phase (BVP). A genetic analysis using the F(2) population from the cross between HS276 and Gimbozu revealed that the late heading of HS276 is governed by a single recessive mutant gene. The subsequent analysis on heading responses of HS276 and Gimbozu to four photoperiods (12, 13, 14, and 15 h) and to the photoperiodic transfer treatment from a short photoperiod to a long photoperiod revealed that the mutant gene confers an extremely long BVP and increases photoperiod sensitivity under long photoperiod (14 and 15 h). The BVP durations of HS276 and Gimbozu were estimated at 30.1 and 16.0 days, respectively; the mutant gene, compared with its wild type allele, elongates the duration of BVP by 14 days. Linkage analysis showed that the mutant gene is located in the 129 kb region between the two INDEL markers, INDELAP0399_6 and INDELAP3487_2, on the distal part of the short arm of chromosome 6. None of the other BVP genes are located in this region; therefore, we declared this a newly detected mutant gene and designated it ef7. A recently established program to breed rice suitable for low latitudes, where short photoperiodic conditions continue throughout the year, aims to develop varieties with extremely long BVPs and weak photoperiod sensitivities; the mutant gene ef7, therefore, will be quite useful in these programs because it confers an extremely long BVP and little enhances photoperiod sensitivity under short photoperiod.
journal.pone.0043705.pdf	OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering	2012	PLoS One	Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.	Arabidopsis thaliana early flowering 3 (ELF3) as a zeitnehmer (time taker) is responsible for generation of circadian rhythm and regulation of photoperiodic flowering. There are two orthologs (OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2) of ELF3 in rice (Oryza sativa), but their roles have not yet been fully identified. Here, we performed a functional characterization of OsELF3-1 and revealed it plays a more predominant role than OsELF3-2 in rice heading. Our results suggest OsELF3-1 can affect rice circadian systems via positive regulation of OsLHY expression and negative regulation of OsPRR1, OsPRR37, OsPRR73 and OsPRR95 expression. In addition, OsELF3-1 is involved in blue light signaling by activating early heading date 1 (Ehd1) expression to promote rice flowering under short-day (SD) conditions. Moreover, OsELF3-1 suppresses a flowering repressor grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7) to indirectly accelerate flowering under long-day (LD) conditions. Taken together, our results indicate OsELF3-1 is essential for circadian regulation and photoperiodic flowering in rice.
Mol. Plant-2013-Yang-202-15.pdf	OsELF3 is involved in circadian clock regulation for promoting flowering under long-day conditions in rice	2013	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research-Wuhan, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Heading date is a critical trait that determines cropping seasons and regional adaptability in rice (Oryza sativa). Research efforts during the last decade have identified some important photoperiod pathway genes that are conserved between Arabidopsis and rice. In this study, we identified a novel gene, Oryza sativa ELF3 (OsELF3), which is a putative homolog of the ELF3 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. OsELF3 was required for the control of heading date under long-day conditions. Its Tos17-tagging mutants exhibited a delayed heading date phenotype only under long-day, but not short-day, conditions. OsELF3 was highly expressed in leaf blades, and the OsELF3 protein was localized in the nucleolus. An obvious diurnal rhythm of OsELF3 transcript level was observed, with a trough in the early day and a peak in the late night in wild-type plants. However, this expression pattern was disrupted in oself3 mutants. Further investigations showed that the expression of OsGI and Ghd7 was up-regulated in the oself3 mutant, indicating that OsELF3 acts as a negative regulator upstream of OsGI and Ghd7 in the flowering-time control under long-day conditions. The rhythmic expression of circadian clock-related genes, including some OsPRR members, was obviously affected in oself3 mutants. Our results indicated that OsELF3 acts as a floral activator in the long-day photoperiodic pathway via its crosstalk with the circadian clock in rice.
Plant Cell Physiol-2012-Matsubara-709-16.pdf	Natural variation in Hd17, a homolog of Arabidopsis ELF3 that is involved in rice photoperiodic flowering	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	Flowering time of rice depends strongly on photoperiodic responses. We previously identified a quantitative trait locus, Heading date 17 (Hd17), that is associated with a difference in flowering time between Japanese rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars. Here, we show that the difference may result from a single nucleotide polymorphism within a putative gene that encodes a homolog of the Arabidopsis EARLY FLOWERING 3 protein, which plays important roles in maintaining circadian rhythms. Our results demonstrate that natural variation in Hd17 may change the transcription level of a flowering repressor, Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7), suggesting that Hd17 is part of rice's photoperiodic flowering pathway.
Plant Cell Physiol-2012-Saito-717-28.pdf	Ef7 encodes an ELF3-like protein and promotes rice flowering by negatively regulating the floral repressor gene Ghd7 under both short- and long-day conditions	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.	Much progress has been made in our understanding of photoperiodic flowering of rice and the mechanisms underlying short-day (SD) promotion and long-day (LD) repression of floral induction. In this study, we identified and characterized the Ef7 gene, one of the rice orthologs of Arabidopsis EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3). The ef7 mutant HS276, which was induced by gamma-irradiation of the japonica rice cultivar 'Gimbozu', flowers late under both SD and LD conditions. Expression analyses of flowering time-related genes demonstrated that Ef7 negatively regulates the expression of Ghd7, which is a repressor of the photoperiodic control of rice flowering, and consequently up-regulates the expression of the downstream Ehd1 and FT-like genes under both SD and LD conditions. Genetic analyses with a non-functional Ghd7 allele provided further evidence that the delayed flowering of ef7 is mediated through the Ghd7 pathway. The analysis of light-induced expression of Ghd7 revealed that the ef7 mutant was more sensitive to red light than the wild-type plant, but the gate of Ghd7 expression was unchanged. Thus, our results show that Ef7 functions as a floral promoter by repressing Ghd7 expression under both SD and LD conditions.
