Ehd1	Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering	In addition, OsELF3-1 is involved in blue light signaling by activating early heading date 1 (Ehd1) expression to promote rice flowering under short-day (SD) conditions
Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	OsPRR1	OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering	Our results suggest OsELF3-1 can affect rice circadian systems via positive regulation of OsLHY expression and negative regulation of OsPRR1, OsPRR37, OsPRR73 and OsPRR95 expression
Ghd7	Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering	Moreover, OsELF3-1 suppresses a flowering repressor grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7) to indirectly accelerate flowering under long-day (LD) conditions
Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering	There are two orthologs (OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2) of ELF3 in rice (Oryza sativa), but their roles have not yet been fully identified
Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering	Here, we performed a functional characterization of OsELF3-1 and revealed it plays a more predominant role than OsELF3-2 in rice heading
Ghd7	Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	Natural variation in Hd17, a homolog of Arabidopsis ELF3 that is involved in rice photoperiodic flowering	Our results demonstrate that natural variation in Hd17 may change the transcription level of a flowering repressor, Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7), suggesting that Hd17 is part of rice's photoperiodic flowering pathway

Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	OsHIP1|HAF1	HAF1 Modulates Circadian Accumulation of OsELF3 Controlling Heading Date Under Long-day Conditions in Rice.	 An amino acid variation (L558S) within the interaction domain of OsELF3 with HAF1 greatly contributes to the variation in heading date among japonica rice accessions
Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	OsHIP1|HAF1	HAF1 Modulates Circadian Accumulation of OsELF3 Controlling Heading Date Under Long-day Conditions in Rice.	 Taken together, our findings suggest that HAF1 precisely modulates the diurnal rhythm of OsELF3 accumulation to ensure the appropriate heading date in rice
