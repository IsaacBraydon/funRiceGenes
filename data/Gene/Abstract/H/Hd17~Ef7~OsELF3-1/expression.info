Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	 Detailed analyses of the se5oself3-1 double mutant revealed the recovery of the phytochrome-dependent expression of Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7), a floral repressor, and Light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein (Lhcb) genes |  Although the oself3-1 mutation recovered Ghd7 expression in the se5 background, there was a lack of Ghd7 expression in the phyAphyBphyC triple mutant background |  These observations suggest OsELF3-1 represses Ghd7 expression by inhibiting the phytochrome signaling pathway
