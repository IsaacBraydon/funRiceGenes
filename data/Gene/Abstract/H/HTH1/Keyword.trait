HTH1	pollen	HOTHEAD-Like HTH1 is Involved in Anther Cutin Biosynthesis and is Required for Pollen Fertility in Rice.	HOTHEAD-Like HTH1 is Involved in Anther Cutin Biosynthesis and is Required for Pollen Fertility in Rice.
HTH1	pollen	HOTHEAD-Like HTH1 is Involved in Anther Cutin Biosynthesis and is Required for Pollen Fertility in Rice.	 Rice plants with HTH1 suppression through CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) and RNA interference (RNAi) displayed defective anther wall and aborted pollen
