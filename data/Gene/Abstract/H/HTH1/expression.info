HTH1	 Rice plants with HTH1 suppression through CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) and RNA interference (RNAi) displayed defective anther wall and aborted pollen |  Disorganized cuticle layers in anthers and shriveled pollen grains were observed in HTH1-RNAi lines |  The total amounts of long-chain fatty acids and cutin monomers in anthers of HTH1-RNAi lines were significantly reduced compared with the wild type
