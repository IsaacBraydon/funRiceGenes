HTH5	 Overexpression of HTH5 increased the seed-setting rate of rice plants under heat stress at the heading stage, whereas suppression of HTH5 resulted in greater susceptibility to heat stress |  Moreover, we found that two SNPs located in the HTH5 promoter region are involved with its expression level and associated with heat tolerance diversity	 Overexpression of HTH5 increased the seed-setting rate of rice plants under heat stress at the heading stage, whereas suppression of HTH5 resulted in greater susceptibility to heat stress
