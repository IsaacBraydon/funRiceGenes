HTH5	tolerance	Natural variation of HTH5 from wild rice, Oryza rufipogon Griff., is involved in conferring high-temperature tolerance at the heading stage.	Natural variation of HTH5 from wild rice, Oryza rufipogon Griff., is involved in conferring high-temperature tolerance at the heading stage.
HTH5	tolerance	Natural variation of HTH5 from wild rice, Oryza rufipogon Griff., is involved in conferring high-temperature tolerance at the heading stage.	 Moreover, we found that two SNPs located in the HTH5 promoter region are involved with its expression level and associated with heat tolerance diversity
HTH5	tolerance	Natural variation of HTH5 from wild rice, Oryza rufipogon Griff., is involved in conferring high-temperature tolerance at the heading stage.	 These findings suggest that the novel gene HTH5 might have great potential value for heightening rice tolerance to heat stress to the on-going threat of global warming
HTH5	stress	Natural variation of HTH5 from wild rice, Oryza rufipogon Griff., is involved in conferring high-temperature tolerance at the heading stage.	 Overexpression of HTH5 increased the seed-setting rate of rice plants under heat stress at the heading stage, whereas suppression of HTH5 resulted in greater susceptibility to heat stress
HTH5	stress	Natural variation of HTH5 from wild rice, Oryza rufipogon Griff., is involved in conferring high-temperature tolerance at the heading stage.	 These findings suggest that the novel gene HTH5 might have great potential value for heightening rice tolerance to heat stress to the on-going threat of global warming
HTH5	reactive oxygen species	Natural variation of HTH5 from wild rice, Oryza rufipogon Griff., is involved in conferring high-temperature tolerance at the heading stage.	 Further investigation indicated that HTH5 reduces reactive oxygen species accumulation at high temperatures by increasing the heat-induced pyridoxal 5&#x27;-phosphate (PLP) content
HTH5	heat stress	Natural variation of HTH5 from wild rice, Oryza rufipogon Griff., is involved in conferring high-temperature tolerance at the heading stage.	 Overexpression of HTH5 increased the seed-setting rate of rice plants under heat stress at the heading stage, whereas suppression of HTH5 resulted in greater susceptibility to heat stress
