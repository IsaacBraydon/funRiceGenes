A genomic Southern blot analysis confirmed that HMGR genes are present in three copies in rice. Of the three, the HMGR 2 gene (Hmg2) obtained as a cDNA clone and its genomic clone had 4 exons and 3 introns, and encoded a 576 amino acid peptide containing an open reading frame of 1,728 bp with a calculated Mw. of 61,150. The structure of rice Hmg2 had common features, based on its nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence homologies, with other plant HMGR genes published to date. Rice Hmg2 transcripts were constitutively detected in all parts of the rice plant, except in lamina and their levels were high particularly in the leaf part of the dark-grown seedlings and mature flowers. Our result showed that mRNA levels of rice Hmg2 were strongly induced in seedlings and influorescence in the early development stage. Rice Hmg2 possibly has a housekeeping role involved in the sterol biosynthesis, among the possible roles of plant HMGR genes that have been suggested in other plants [Weissenborn et al. (1995)].
