HMG2	leaf	Molecular characterization of Hmg2 gene encoding a 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in rice	 Rice Hmg2 transcripts were constitutively detected in all parts of the rice plant, except in lamina and their levels were high particularly in the leaf part of the dark-grown seedlings and mature flowers
HMG2	seedling	Molecular characterization of Hmg2 gene encoding a 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in rice	 Rice Hmg2 transcripts were constitutively detected in all parts of the rice plant, except in lamina and their levels were high particularly in the leaf part of the dark-grown seedlings and mature flowers
HMG2	seedling	Molecular characterization of Hmg2 gene encoding a 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in rice	 Our result showed that mRNA levels of rice Hmg2 were strongly induced in seedlings and influorescence in the early development stage
HMG2	lamina	Molecular characterization of Hmg2 gene encoding a 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in rice	 Rice Hmg2 transcripts were constitutively detected in all parts of the rice plant, except in lamina and their levels were high particularly in the leaf part of the dark-grown seedlings and mature flowers
